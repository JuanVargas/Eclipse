In [[mathematics]], the '''axiom of choice''', or '''AC''', is an [[axiom]] of [[set theory]] stating that for every family &lt;math&gt;(S_i)_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; of nonempty sets there exists a family &lt;math&gt;(x_i)_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; of elements with &lt;math&gt;x_i \in S_i&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;i \in I&lt;/math&gt;. Informally put, the axiom of choice says that given any collection of bins, each containing at least one object, it is possible to make a selection of exactly one object from each bin. In many cases such a selection can be made without invoking the axiom of choice; this is in particular the case if the number of bins is finite, or if a selection rule is available: a distinguishing property that happens to hold for exactly one object in each bin. For example for any (even infinite) collection of pairs of shoes, one can pick out the left shoe to obtain an appropriate selection, but for an infinite collection of pairs of socks (assumed to have no distinguishing features), such a selection can only be obtained by invoking the axiom of choice.

The axiom of choice was formulated in 1904 by [[Ernst Zermelo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zermelo, 1904&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| first=Ernst| last=Zermelo| year=1904| url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/no_cache/en/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=28526 |format=reprint|title=Beweis, dass jede Menge wohlgeordnet werden kann| journal=Mathematische Annalen| volume=59| issue=4| pages=514–16|doi=10.1007/BF01445300}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although originally controversial, it is now used without reservation by most mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;Jech, 1977, p. 348''ff''; Martin-Löf 2008, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; One motivation for this use is that a number of important mathematical results, such as [[Tychonoff's theorem]], require the axiom of choice for their proofs. Contemporary set theorists also study axioms that are not compatible with the axiom of choice, such as the [[axiom of determinacy]]. Unlike the axiom of choice, these alternatives are not ordinarily proposed as axioms for mathematics, but only as principles in set theory with interesting consequences.

==Statement==
A [[choice function]] is a function ''f'', defined on a collection ''X'' of nonempty sets, such that for every set ''s'' in ''X'', ''f''(''s'') is an element of ''s''.  With this concept, the axiom can be stated:
:For any set ''X'' of nonempty sets, there exists a choice function ''f'' defined on ''X''.
Thus the negation of the axiom of choice states that there exists a set of nonempty sets which has no choice function.

Each choice function on a collection ''X'' of nonempty sets is an element of the [[Cartesian product]] of the sets in ''X''. This is not the most general situation of a Cartesian product of a [[indexed family|family]] of sets, where a same set can occur more than once as a factor; however, one can focus on elements of such a product that select the same element every time a given set appears as factor, and such elements correspond to an element of the Cartesian product of all ''distinct'' sets in the family. The axiom of choice asserts the existence of such elements; it is therefore equivalent to:

:Given any family of nonempty sets, their Cartesian product is a nonempty set.

===Variants===
There are many other equivalent statements of the axiom of choice. These are equivalent in the sense that, in the presence of other basic axioms of set theory, they imply the axiom of choice and are implied by it. 

One variation avoids the use of choice functions by, in effect, replacing each choice function with its range.
:Given any set ''X'' of [[pairwise disjoint]] non-empty sets, there exists at least one set ''C'' that contains exactly one element in common with each of the sets in ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;Herrlich, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another equivalent axiom only considers collections ''X'' that are essentially powersets of other sets:
:For any set A, the [[power set]] of A (with the empty set removed) has a choice function.
Authors who use this formulation often speak of the ''choice function on A'', but be advised that this is a slightly different notion of choice function.  Its domain is the powerset of ''A'' (with the empty set removed), and so makes sense for any set ''A'', whereas with the definition used elsewhere in this article, the domain of a choice function on a ''collection of sets'' is that collection, and so only makes sense for sets of sets.  With this alternate notion of choice function, the axiom of choice can be compactly stated as
:Every set has a choice function.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Suppes]], &quot;Axiomatic Set Theory&quot;, Dover, 1972 (1960), ISBN 0-486-61630-4, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;
which is equivalent to
:For any  set A there is a function ''f'' such that for any non-empty subset B of ''A'', ''f''(''B'') lies in ''B''.
The negation of the axiom can thus be expressed as:
:There is a set ''A'' such that for all functions ''f'' (on the set of non-empty subsets of ''A''), there is a ''B'' such that ''f''(''B'') does not lie in ''B''.

=== Restriction to finite sets ===

The statement of the axiom of choice does not specify whether the collection of nonempty sets is finite or infinite, and thus implies that every [[finite set|finite collection]] of nonempty sets has a choice function. However, that particular case is a theorem of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] without the axiom of choice (ZF); it is easily proved by [[mathematical induction]].&lt;ref&gt;Tourlakis (2003), pp. 209–210, 215–216.&lt;/ref&gt; In the even simpler case of a collection of ''one'' set, a choice function just corresponds to an element, so this instance of the axiom of choice says that every nonempty set has an element; this holds trivially. The axiom of choice can be seen as an asserting the generalization of this property, already evident for finite collections, to arbitrary collections.

==Usage==
Until the late 19th century, the axiom of choice was often used implicitly, although it had not yet been formally stated. For example, after having established that the set ''X'' contains only non-empty sets, a mathematician might have said &quot;let ''F(s)'' be one of the members of ''s'' for all ''s'' in ''X''.&quot;  In general, it is impossible to prove that ''F'' exists without the axiom of choice, but this seems to have gone unnoticed until [[Zermelo]].

Not every situation requires the axiom of choice. For finite sets ''X'', the axiom of choice follows from the other axioms of set theory. In that case it is equivalent to saying that if we have several (a finite number of) boxes, each containing at least one item, then we can choose exactly one item from each box. Clearly we can do this: We start at the first box, choose an item; go to the second box, choose an item; and so on. The number of boxes is finite, so eventually our choice procedure comes to an end. The result is an explicit choice function: a function that takes the first box to the first element we chose, the second box to the second element we chose, and so on. (A formal proof for all finite sets would use the principle of [[mathematical induction]] to prove &quot;for every natural number ''k'', every family of ''k'' nonempty sets has a choice function.&quot;) This method cannot, however, be used to show that every countable family of nonempty sets has a choice function, as is asserted by the [[axiom of countable choice]]. If the method is applied to an infinite sequence (''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''i''∈ω) of nonempty sets, a function is obtained at each finite stage, but there is no stage at which a choice function for the entire family is constructed, and no &quot;limiting&quot; choice function can be constructed, in general, in ZF without the axiom of choice.

==Examples==
The nature of the individual nonempty sets in the collection may make it possible to avoid the axiom of choice even for certain infinite collections. For example, suppose that each member of the collection ''X'' is nonempty subset of the natural numbers. Every such subset has a smallest element, so to specify our choice function we can simply say that it maps each set to the least element of that set. This gives us a definite choice of an element from each set, and makes it unnecessary to apply the axiom of choice.

The difficulty appears when there is no natural choice of elements from each set.  If we cannot make explicit choices, how do we know that our set exists?  For example, suppose that ''X'' is the set of all non-empty subsets of the [[real number]]s.  First we might try to proceed as if ''X'' were finite.  If we try to choose an element from each set, then, because ''X'' is infinite, our choice procedure will never come to an end, and consequently, we will never be able to produce a choice function for all of ''X''.  Next we might try specifying the least element from each set.  But some subsets of the real numbers do not have least elements. For example, the open interval (0,1) does not have a least element: if ''x'' is in (0,1), then so is ''x''/2, and ''x''/2 is always strictly smaller than ''x''.  So this attempt also fails.

To give a more convincing example, consider for instance the unit circle S, and the action on S by a group G consisting of all rational rotations. Namely, these are rotations by angles which are rational multiples of π. Here G is countable while S is uncountable. Hence S breaks up into uncountably many orbits under G. Using the axiom of choice, we could pick a single point from each orbit, obtaining an uncountable subset X of S with the property that all of its translates by G are disjoint from X. In other words, the circle gets partitioned into a countable collection of disjoint sets, which are all pairwise congruent. Now it is easy to convince oneself that the set X could not possibly be measurable for a countably additive measure. Hence one couldn't expect to find an algorithm to find a point in each orbit, without using the axiom of choice.  This example illuminates the fundamental difficulty better than the collection of open intervals. See [[non-measurable set#Example]] for more details.

The reason that we are able to choose least elements from subsets of the natural numbers is the fact that the natural numbers are [[well-order]]ed: every nonempty subset of the natural numbers has a unique least element under the natural ordering.  One might say, &quot;Even though the usual ordering of the real numbers does not work, it may be possible to find a different ordering of the real numbers which is a well-ordering.  Then our choice function can choose the least element of every set under our unusual ordering.&quot;  The problem then becomes that of constructing a well-ordering, which turns out to require the axiom of choice for its existence; every set can be well-ordered if and only if the axiom of choice holds.

==Nonconstructive aspects==

A proof requiring the axiom of choice is [[nonconstructive proof|nonconstructive]]: even though the proof establishes the existence of an object, it may be impossible to [[definable set|define]] the object in the language of set theory. For example, while the axiom of choice implies that there is a [[well-ordering]] of the real numbers, there are models of set theory with the axiom of choice in which no well-ordering of the reals is definable. As another example, a subset of the real numbers that is not [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue measurable]] can be proven to exist using the axiom of choice, but it is [[consistent]] that no such set is definable. 

The axiom of choice produces these intangibles (objects that are proven to exist by a nonconstructive proof, but cannot be explicitly constructed), which may conflict with some philosophical principles. Because there is no [[canonical]] well-ordering of all sets, a construction that relies on a well-ordering may not produce a canonical result, even if a canonical result is desired (as is often the case in [[category theory]]). In [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]], all existence proofs are required to be totally explicit. That is, one must be able to construct, in an explicit and canonical manner, anything that is proven to exist. This foundation rejects the full axiom of choice because it asserts the existence of an object without uniquely determining its structure. In fact the [[Diaconescu–Goodman–Myhill theorem]] shows how to derive the constructively unacceptable [[law of the excluded middle]], or a restricted form of it, in [[constructive set theory]] from the assumption of the axiom of choice. 

Another argument against the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of counterintuitive objects. One example of this is the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]] which says that it is possible to decompose (&quot;carve up&quot;) the 3-dimensional solid unit ball into finitely many pieces and, using only rotations and translations, reassemble the pieces into two solid balls each with the same volume as the original. The pieces in this decomposition, constructed using the axiom of choice, are [[non-measurable set]]s.

The majority of mathematicians accept the axiom of choice as a valid principle for proving new results in mathematics. The debate is interesting enough, however, that it is considered of note when a theorem in ZFC (ZF plus AC) is [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] (with just the ZF axioms) to the axiom of choice, and mathematicians look for results that require the axiom of choice to be false, though this type of deduction is less common than the type which requires the axiom of choice to be true.

It is possible to prove many theorems using neither the axiom of choice nor its negation; this is common in constructive mathematics. Such statements will be true in any [[model theory|model]] of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF), regardless of the truth or falsity of the axiom of choice in that particular model. The restriction to ZF renders any claim that relies on either the axiom of choice or its negation unprovable. For example, the Banach–Tarski paradox is neither provable nor disprovable from ZF alone: it is impossible to construct the required decomposition of the unit ball in ZF, but also impossible to prove there is no such decomposition. Similarly, all the statements listed below which require choice or some weaker version thereof for their proof are unprovable in ZF, but since each is provable in ZF plus the axiom of choice, there are models of ZF in which each statement is true.  Statements such as the Banach–Tarski paradox can be rephrased as conditional statements, for example, &quot;If AC holds, the decomposition in the Banach–Tarski paradox exists.&quot; Such conditional statements are provable in ZF when the original statements are provable from ZF and the axiom of choice.

==Independence==

Assuming ZF is consistent, [[Kurt Gödel]] showed that the ''negation'' of the axiom of choice is not a theorem of ZF by constructing an [[inner model]] (the [[constructible universe]]) which satisfies ZFC and thus showing that ZFC is consistent. Assuming ZF is consistent, [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] employed the technique of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]], developed for this purpose, to show that the axiom of choice itself is not a theorem of ZF by constructing a much more complex model which satisfies ZF¬C (ZF with the negation of AC added as axiom) and thus showing that ZF¬C is consistent. Together these results establish that the axiom of choice is [[Independence (mathematical logic)|logically independent]] of ZF. The assumption that ZF is consistent is harmless because adding another axiom to an already inconsistent system cannot make the situation worse. Because of independence, the decision whether to use of the axiom of choice (or its negation) in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory. The decision must be made on other grounds.

One argument given in favor of using the axiom of choice is that it is convenient to use it because it allows one to prove some simplifying propositions that otherwise could not be proved. Many theorems which are provable using choice are of an elegant general character: every ideal in a ring is contained in a maximal ideal, every vector space has a basis, and every product of compact spaces is compact. Without the axiom of choice, these theorems may not hold for mathematical objects of large cardinality.

The proof of the independence result also shows that a wide class of mathematical statements, including all statements that can be phrased in the language of [[Peano arithmetic]], are provable in ZF if and only if they are provable in ZFC.&lt;ref&gt;This is because arithmetical statements are [[absoluteness (mathematical logic)|absolute]] to the [[constructible universe]] ''L''. [[Shoenfield's absoluteness theorem]] gives a more general result.&lt;/ref&gt; Statements in this class include the statement that [[P = NP]], the [[Riemann hypothesis]], and many other unsolved mathematical problems. When one attempts to solve problems in this class, it makes no difference whether ZF or ZFC is employed if the only question is the existence of a proof. It is possible, however, that there is a shorter proof of a theorem from ZFC than from ZF.

The axiom of choice is not the only significant statement which is independent of ZF.  For example, the [[Continuum hypothesis#The generalized continuum hypothesis|generalized continuum hypothesis]] (GCH) is not only independent of ZF, but also independent of ZFC. However, ZF plus GCH implies AC, making GCH a strictly stronger claim than AC, even though they are both independent of ZF.

==Stronger axioms==
The [[axiom of constructibility]] and the [[Continuum hypothesis#The generalized continuum hypothesis|generalized continuum hypothesis]] both imply the axiom of choice, but are strictly stronger than it.

In class theories such as [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] and [[Morse–Kelley set theory]], there is a possible axiom called the [[axiom of global choice]] which is stronger than the axiom of choice for sets because it also applies to proper classes. And the axiom of global choice follows from the [[axiom of limitation of size]].

==Equivalents==
There are important statements that, assuming the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] but neither AC nor ¬AC, are equivalent to the axiom of choice.  The most important among them are [[Zorn's lemma]] and the [[well-ordering theorem]].  In fact, Zermelo initially introduced the axiom of choice in order to formalize his proof of the well-ordering theorem.

*[[Set theory]]
**[[Well-ordering theorem]]: Every set can be well-ordered. Consequently, every cardinal has an [[initial ordinal]].
**[[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]'s theorem: For every infinite set ''A'', there is a [[bijective map]] between the sets  ''A'' and ''A''×''A''.
**[[Trichotomy (mathematics)|Trichotomy]]: If two sets are given, then either they have the same cardinality, or one has a smaller cardinality than the other.
**The [[Cartesian product]] of any family of nonempty sets is nonempty.
**[[König's theorem (set theory)|König's theorem]]: Colloquially, the sum of a sequence of cardinals is strictly less than the product of a sequence of larger cardinals. (The reason for the term &quot;colloquially&quot;, is that the sum or product of a &quot;sequence&quot; of cardinals cannot be defined without some aspect of the axiom of choice.)
**Every [[surjective function]] has a [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|right inverse]].

*[[Order theory]]
**[[Zorn's lemma]]: Every non-empty partially ordered set in which every chain (i.e. totally ordered subset) has an upper bound contains at least one maximal element.
**[[Hausdorff maximal principle]]: In any partially ordered set, every totally ordered subset is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset. The restricted principle &quot;Every partially ordered set has a maximal totally ordered subset&quot; is also equivalent to AC over ZF.
**[[Tukey's lemma]]: Every non-empty collection of [[finite character]] has a maximal element with respect to inclusion.
**[[Antichain]] principle: Every partially ordered set has a maximal [[antichain]].

*[[Abstract algebra]]
**Every [[vector space]] has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blass|first=Andreas|title=Existence of bases implies the axiom of choice|journal=Contemporary mathematics|year=1984|volume=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Every unital [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] other than the trivial ring contains a [[maximal ideal]].
**For every non-empty set ''S'' there is a [[binary operation]] defined on ''S'' that makes it a [[Group (mathematics)|group]].&lt;ref&gt;[[András Hajnal|A. Hajnal]], A. Kertész: Some new algebraic equivalents of the axiom  of choice, ''Publ. Math. Debrecen'', '''19'''(1972),  339&amp;ndash;340, see also H. Rubin, J. Rubin, ''Equivalents of the axiom of choice, II'', North-Holland, 1985, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; (A [[cancellation property|cancellative]] binary operation is enough.)

*[[Functional analysis]]
**The closed unit ball of the dual of a [[normed vector space]] over the reals has an [[extreme point]].

*[[General topology]]
**[[Tychonoff's theorem]] stating that every [[product topology|product]] of [[Compact space|compact]] [[topological space]]s is compact.
**In the product topology, the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of a product of subsets is equal to the product of the closures.

*[[Mathematical logic]]
**If ''S'' is a set of sentences of [[first-order logic]] and ''B'' is a consistent subset of ''S'', then ''B'' is included in a set that is maximal among consistent subsets of ''S''.  The special case where ''S'' is the set of '''all''' first-order sentences in a given [[signature (logic)|signature]] is weaker, equivalent to the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]]; see the section &quot;Weaker forms&quot; below.

=== Category theory ===
There are several results in [[category theory]] which invoke the axiom of choice for their proof.  These results might be weaker than, equivalent to, or stronger than the axiom of choice, depending on the strength of the technical foundations.  For example, if one defines categories in terms of sets, that is, as sets of objects and morphisms (usually called a [[small category]]), or even locally small categories, whose hom-objects are sets, then there is no [[category of sets|category of all sets]], and so it is difficult for a category-theoretic formulation to apply to all sets.  On the other hand, other foundational descriptions of category theory are considerably stronger, and an identical category-theoretic statement of choice may be stronger than the standard formulation, à la class theory, mentioned above.

Examples of category-theoretic statements which require choice include:
*Every small [[category (mathematics)|category]] has a [[skeleton (category theory)|skeleton]].
*If two small categories are weakly equivalent, then they are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]].
*Every continuous functor on a small-complete category which satisfies the appropriate solution set condition has a [[adjoint functors|left-adjoint]] (the Freyd adjoint functor theorem).

==Weaker forms==
There are several weaker statements that are not equivalent to the axiom of choice, but are closely related. One example is the [[axiom of dependent choice]] (DC). A still weaker example is the [[axiom of countable choice]] (AC&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; or CC), which states that a choice function exists for any countable set of nonempty sets. These axioms are sufficient for many proofs in elementary [[mathematical analysis]], and are consistent with some principles, such as the Lebesgue measurability of all sets of reals, that are disprovable from the full axiom of choice.

Other choice axioms weaker than axiom of choice include the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]] and the [[Uniformization (set theory)|axiom of uniformization]].  The former is equivalent in ZF to the existence of an [[ultrafilter]] containing each given filter, proved by Tarski in 1930.

===Results requiring AC (or weaker forms) but weaker than it===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Basis (linear algebra)]] --&gt;
One of the most interesting aspects of the axiom of choice is the large number of places in mathematics that it shows up. Here are some statements that require the axiom of choice in the sense that they are not provable from ZF but are provable from ZFC (ZF plus AC).  Equivalently, these statements are true in all models of ZFC but false in some models of ZF.

*[[Set theory]]
**Any [[union (set theory)|union]] of countably many [[countable sets]] is itself countable.
**If the set ''A'' is [[infinite]], then there exists an [[injective function|injection]] from the [[natural number]]s '''N''' to ''A'' (see [[Dedekind infinite]]).

**The [[Hausdorff paradox]].
**The [[Banach–Tarski paradox]].
**The [[Lebesgue measure]] of a countable [[disjoint union]] of measurable sets is equal to the sum of the measures of the individual sets.

==Stronger forms of the negation of AC==
Now, consider stronger forms of the negation of AC.  For example, if we abbreviate by BP the claim that every set of real numbers has the [[property of Baire]], then BP is stronger than ¬AC, which asserts the nonexistence of any choice function on perhaps only a single set of nonempty sets.  Note that strengthened negations may be compatible with weakened forms of AC.  For example, ZF + DC&lt;ref&gt;[[Axiom of dependent choice]]&lt;/ref&gt; + BP is consistent, if ZF is.

It is also consistent with ZF + DC that every set of reals is [[Lebesgue measurable]]; however, this consistency result, due to [[Robert M. Solovay]], cannot be proved in ZFC itself, but requires a mild [[large cardinal]] assumption (the existence of an [[inaccessible cardinal]]). The much stronger [[axiom of determinacy]], or AD, implies that every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, has the property of Baire, and has the [[perfect set property]] (all three of these results are refuted by AC itself). ZF + DC + AD is consistent provided that a sufficiently strong large cardinal axiom is consistent (the existence of infinitely many [[Woodin cardinal]]s).

==Statements consistent with the negation of AC==
There are models of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory in which the axiom of choice is false.  We will abbreviate &quot;Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory plus the negation of the axiom of choice&quot; by ZF¬C.  For certain models of ZF¬C, it is possible to prove the negation of some standard facts.
Note that any model of ZF¬C is also a model of ZF, so for each of the following statements, there exists a model of ZF in which that statement is true.

*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which there is a function ''f'' from the real numbers to the real numbers such that ''f'' is not continuous at ''a'', but ''f'' is [[Sequential continuity|sequentially continuous]] at ''a'', i.e., for any sequence {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} converging to ''a'', lim&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; f(''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')=f(a).
*There exists a model of ZF¬C which has an infinite set of real numbers without a countably infinite subset.
*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which real numbers are a countable union of countable sets.&lt;ref&gt;Jech, Thomas (1973) &quot;The axiom of choice&quot;, ISBN 0-444-10484-4, CH. 10, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;
*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which there is a field with no algebraic closure.

*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which every set in R&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is [[measurable]].  Thus it is possible to exclude counterintuitive results like the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]] which are provable in ZFC.  Furthermore, this is possible whilst assuming the [[Axiom of dependent choice]], which is weaker than AC but sufficient to develop most of [[real analysis]].
*In all models of ZF¬C, the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] does not hold.

&quot;The Axiom of Choice is obviously true, the [[Well-ordering theorem|well-ordering principle]] obviously false, and who can tell about [[Zorn's lemma]]?&quot; —&amp;nbsp;[[Jerry Bona]]
:This is a joke: although the three are all mathematically equivalent, many mathematicians find the axiom of choice to be intuitive, the well-ordering principle to be counterintuitive, and Zorn's lemma to be too complex for any intuition.

&quot;The Axiom of Choice is necessary to select a set from an infinite number of socks, but not an infinite number of shoes.&quot; —&amp;nbsp;[[Bertrand Russell]]
:The observation here is that one can define a function to select from an infinite number of pairs of shoes by stating for example, to choose the left shoe.  Without the axiom of choice, one cannot assert that such a function exists for pairs of socks, because left and right socks are (presumably) indistinguishable from each other.

&quot;Tarski tried to publish his theorem [the equivalence between AC and 'every infinite set ''A'' has the same cardinality as ''A''x''A''', see above] in [[Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences|Comptes Rendus]], but [[Maurice René Fréchet|Fréchet]] and [[Henri Lebesgue|Lebesgue]] refused to present it. Fréchet wrote that an implication between two well known [true] propositions is not a new result, and Lebesgue wrote that an implication between two false propositions is of no interest&quot;.
:Polish-American mathematician [[Jan Mycielski]] relates this anecdote in a 2006 article in the Notices of the AMS.

&quot;The axiom gets its name not because mathematicians prefer it to other axioms.&quot; —&amp;nbsp;[[A. K. Dewdney]]
:This quote comes from the famous [[April Fools' Day]] article in the ''computer recreations'' column of the ''[[Scientific American]]'', April 1989.

'''Attila''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|æ|t|ɨ|l|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|t|ɪ|l|ə}}; ?–453), also known as '''Attila the Hun''', was the ruler of the [[Huns]] from 434 until his death in 453. He was leader of the [[Hunnic Empire]], which stretched from Germany to the [[Ural River]] and from the [[Danube]] River to the [[Baltic Sea]]. During his rule, he was one of the most fearsome enemies of the Western and Eastern [[Roman Empire]]. He invaded the [[Balkans]] twice and marched through [[Gaul]] (modern France) as far as [[Orléans]] before being defeated at the [[Battle of Châlons]]. He refrained from attacking either [[Constantinople]] or Rome.

==Appearance, character==
There is no surviving first-person account of Attila's appearance. There is, however, a possible second-hand source, provided by Jordanes, who cites a description given by [[Priscus]]. It suggests a person of [[Asian people|Asian]] features.&lt;ref&gt;Herwig Wolfram, ''The Roman Empire and its Germanic peoples'', University of California Press, 1997, ISBN 9780520085114, [http://books.google.com.tr/books?id=wZP4smCQJOMC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=eye-witness+description+of+Attila&amp;hl=tr&amp;ei=VWxRTOihOYHGvQOomuzUBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=description%20of%20Attila&amp;f=false. p. 143.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Translated by [[Charles Christopher Mierow]]. Chapter 35: Attila the Hun. http://www.romansonline.com/Src_Frame.asp?DocID=Gth_Goth_35&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Etymology of the name==
The origin of Attila's name is unclear. Pritsak considers it to mean &quot;universal ruler&quot; in a Turkic language related to Danube Bulgarian.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Άττίλα/Αίίϋα.95 In 1955 I showed that 'Αττίλας/Attila should be analyzed as a composite title consisting of *es 'great, old', *t4l· 'sea, ocean', and the suffix /a/. The stressed back syllabic til (= tlill) assimilated the front member es, so it became *as.96 The consonantic sequence s-t (aş til-) became, due to metathesis, t-s, which by assimilation resulted in tt.97 In 1981 I was able to establish a Danube-Bulgarian nominative-suffix /A/ from the consonantic stems.98 Recalling that Danube-Bulgarian was a Hunnic language, I can now add to the data in the article of 1955 the following: the Hunnic title attila is a nominative,(in /A/) form of attil- (&lt; *etsil &lt; *es til) with the meaning &quot;the oceanic, universal [ruler];&quot; cf. the title of the Pećeneg ruler Куря, i.e., Kür+ä,meaning &quot;universal&quot; (cf. no. 3).&quot; Pritsak, Omeljan. 1982 &quot;The Hunnic Language of the Attila Clan.&quot; ''Harvard Ukrainian Studies'', vol. 6, pp. 428-476.[http://140.247.132.248/huri/pdf/hus_volumes/vVI_n4_dec1982.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Maenchen-Helfen suggests an East Germanic origin and rejects a Turkic etymology: &quot;Attila is formed from Gothic or Gepidic atta, &quot;father,&quot; by means of the diminutive suffix -ila.&quot; He suggests that Pritsak's etymology is &quot;ingenious but for many reasons unacceptable&quot;. However, he suggests that these names were &quot;not the true names of the Hun princes and lords. What we have are Hunnic names in Germanic dress, modified to fit the Gothic tongue, or popular Gothic etymologies, or both. Mikkola thought Attila might go back to Turkish atlïg, &quot;famous&quot;; [127] Poucha finds in it Tokharian atär, &quot;hero.&quot; [128] The first etymology is too farfetched to be taken seriously, the second is nonsense.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The name has many variants in modern languages: Atli and Atle in Norse, Attila/Atilla/Etele in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (all the three name variants are used in Hungary; Attila is the most popular variant), Etzel in the German [[Nibelungenlied]], or Attila, Atila or Atilla in modern Turkish.

==Background==
{{Main|Huns}}
The Huns were a group of [[Eurasian nomads]], appearing from east of the [[Volga]], who migrated into Europe c. 370 and built up an enormous empire there. Their main military techniques were [[mounted archer]]y and [[javelin]] throwing. They were possibly the descendants of the [[Xiongnu]] who [[History of the Han Dynasty|had been northern neighbours]] of China three hundred years before&lt;ref name=&quot;DeGuignes1756&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last = De Guignes | first = Joseph | author-link = Joseph de Guignes | title = Histoire générale des Huns, des Turcs, des Mongols et des autres Tartares | year = 1756-1758}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be the first expansion of [[Turkic people]] across [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eliznik.org.uk/RomaniaHistory/trans-map/index.htm |title='&amp;#39;Transylvania through the age of migrations'&amp;#39; |publisher=Eliznik.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calise, J.M.P.

==Shared kingship==
[[File:450 roman-hunnic-empire 1764x1116.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Hunnic Empire]] (Orange)]]
The death of [[Rugila]] (also known as Rua or Ruga) in 434 left the sons of his brother [[Mundzuk]], Attila and [[Bleda]] (Buda), in control of the united Hun tribes. At the time of two brothers' accession, the Hun tribes were bargaining with Eastern Roman Emperor [[Theodosius II]]'s envoys for the return of several [[wikt:renegade|renegade]]s (possibly Hunnic nobles who disagreed with the brothers' assumption of leadership) who had taken refuge within the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].

The following year Attila and Bleda met with the imperial legation at Margus (present-day [[Pozarevac|Požarevac]]) and, all seated on horseback in the Hunnic manner,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Howarth | first = Patrick | title = Attila, King of the Huns | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing | year = 1995 | location = New York | pages = 191–92 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=0vt_4oJLGzAC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=horses%2Bhuns | isbn = 9780760700334}}&lt;/ref&gt; negotiated a successful [[treaty]]. The Romans agreed to not only return the fugitives, but to also double their previous [[tribute]] of 350 Roman pounds (ca. 115&amp;nbsp;kg) of gold, to open their markets to Hunnish traders, and to pay a ransom of eight ''[[solidus (coin)|solidi]]'' for each Roman taken prisoner by the Huns. The Huns, satisfied with the treaty, decamped from the Roman Empire and returned to their home in the Hungarian Great Plain, perhaps to consolidate and strengthen their empire. Theodosius used this opportunity to strengthen the [[walls of Constantinople]], building the city's first [[sea wall]], and to build up his border defenses along the [[Danube]].

The Huns remained out of Roman sight for the next few years while they invaded the [[Sassanid Empire]]. When defeated in [[Armenia]] by the Sassanids, the Huns abandoned their invasion and turned their attentions back to Europe. In 440 they reappeared in force on the borders of the Roman Empire, attacking the merchants at the market on the north bank of the Danube that had been established by the treaty. Crossing the Danube, they laid waste to the cities of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] and forts on the river, including (according to Priscus) [[Viminacium]], a city of [[Moesia]]. Their advance began at Margus, where they demanded that the Romans turn over a bishop who had retained property that Attila regarded as his. While the Romans discussed turning the Bishop over, he slipped away secretly to the Huns and betrayed the city to them.

While the Huns attacked city-states along the Danube, the [[Vandals]] led by [[Geiseric]] captured the Western Roman province of Africa and its capital of [[Carthage]]. Carthage was the richest province of the Western empire and a main source of food for Rome. The [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] [[Shah]] [[Yazdegerd II of Persia|Yazdegerd II]] invaded [[Armenia]] in 441. The Romans stripped the Balkan area of forces needed to defeat the Vandals in Africa which left Attila and Bleda a clear path through Illyricum into the Balkans, which they invaded in 441. The Hunnish army sacked Margus and Viminacium, and then took [[Singidunum]] (modern [[Belgrade]]) and [[Sirmium]]. During 442 Theodosius recalled his troops from [[Sicily]] and ordered a large issue of new coins to finance operations against the Huns. Believing he could defeat the Huns, he refused the Hunnish kings' demands.

Attila responded with a campaign in 443.&lt;ref&gt;Dupuy, R. Ernest and Trevor N. Dupuy, ''The Harper Encyclopedia of Military History '', 4th Edition, (HarperCollins Publishers, 1993), 189&lt;/ref&gt; Striking along the Danube, the Huns, equipped with new military weapons like the [[battering ram]]s and rolling siege towers, overran the military centres of [[Ratiara]] and successfully besieged Naissus (modern [[Niš]]).

Advancing along the [[Nišava|Nisava River]], the Huns next took [[Sofia|Serdica]], [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]], and [[Arcadiopolis]]. They encountered and destroyed a Roman army outside Constantinople but were stopped by the double walls of the Eastern capital. They defeated a second army near Callipolis (modern Gallipoli). Theodosius, stripped of his armed forces, admitted defeat, sending the [[magister militum|Magister militum per Orientem]] [[Anatolius (consul 440)|Anatolius]] to negotiate peace terms. The terms were harsher than the previous treaty: the Emperor agreed to hand over 6,000 Roman pounds (ca. 2000&amp;nbsp;kg) of gold as punishment for having disobeyed the terms of the treaty during the invasion; the yearly tribute was tripled, rising to 2,100 Roman pounds (ca. 700&amp;nbsp;kg) in gold; and the ransom for each Roman prisoner rose to 12 ''solidi''.

Their demands met for a time, the Hun kings withdrew into the interior of their empire. Following the Huns' withdrawal from Byzantium (probably around 445), Bleda died. Attila then took the throne for himself, becoming the sole ruler of the Huns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www29.homepage.villanova.edu/christopher.haas/embassy.htm |title=Priscus of Panium: fragments from the Embassy to Attila |publisher=9.homepage.villanova.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sole ruler==
[[Image:MorThanFeastofAttila.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Mór Than]]'s painting ''The Feast of Attila'', based on a fragment of [[Priscus]].]]
In 447 Attila again rode south into the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] through [[Moesia]]. The [[Roman military history|Roman army]] under the [[Goths|Gothic]] ''[[magister militum]]'' Arnegisclus met him in the [[Battle of the Utus]] and was defeated, though not without inflicting heavy losses. The Huns were left unopposed and rampaged through the Balkans as far as [[Thermopylae]]. Constantinople itself was saved by the [[Isaurian]] troops of the ''[[magister militum per Orientem]]'' [[Zeno (consul 448)|Zeno]] and protected by the intervention of the prefect [[Constantinus (consul 457)|Constantinus]], who organized the reconstruction of the walls that had been previously damaged by earthquakes, and, in some places, to construct a new line of fortification in front of the old. An account of this invasion survives:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The barbarian nation of the Huns, which was in [[Thrace]], became so great that more than a hundred cities were captured and Constantinople almost came into danger and most men fled from it. ... And there were so many murders and blood-lettings that the dead could not be numbered. Ay, for they took captive the churches and monasteries and slew the monks and maidens in great numbers. (Callinicus, in his ''Life of Saint Hypatius'')
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In the West==
In 450, Attila proclaimed his intent to attack the [[Visigoth]] kingdom of [[Toulouse]] by making an [[military alliance|alliance]] with Emperor [[Valentinian III]]. He had previously been on good terms with the Western Roman Empire and its influential general [[Flavius Aetius|Flavius Aëtius]]. Aëtius had spent a brief [[exile]] among the Huns in 433, and the troops Attila provided against the [[Goths]] and [[Bagaudae]] had helped earn him the largely honorary title of ''magister militum'' in the west. The gifts and diplomatic efforts of [[Geiseric]], who opposed and feared the Visigoths, may also have influenced Attila's plans.

However, Valentinian's sister was [[Justa Grata Honoria|Honoria]], who, in order to escape her forced betrothal to a [[Roman Senate|Roman senator]], had sent the Hunnish king a plea for help – and her engagement ring – in the spring of 450. Though Honoria may not have intended a proposal of marriage, Attila chose to interpret her message as such. He accepted, asking for half of the western Empire as dowry. When Valentinian discovered the plan, only the influence of his mother [[Galla Placidia]] convinced him to exile, rather than kill, Honoria. He also wrote to Attila strenuously denying the legitimacy of the supposed marriage proposal. Attila sent an emissary to [[Ravenna]] to proclaim that Honoria was innocent, that the proposal had been legitimate, and that he would come to claim what was rightfully his.

[[Image:Attila in Gaul 451CE.svg|left|thumb|250px|The general path of the Hun forces in the invasion of Gaul.]]

Attila interfered in a succession struggle after the death of a Frankish ruler. Attila supported the elder son, while Aëtius supported the younger.&lt;ref&gt;The location and identity of these kings is not known and subject to conjecture.&lt;/ref&gt; Attila gathered his [[vassal]]s—[[Gepids]], [[Ostrogoths]], [[Rugians]], [[Scirians]], [[Heruls]], [[Thuringians]], [[Alans]], [[Burgundians]], among others and began his march west. In 451, he arrived in [[Belgica]] with an army exaggerated by Jordanes to half a million strong. [[J.B. Bury]] believes that Attila's intent, by the time he marched west, was to extend his kingdom – already the strongest on the continent – across [[Gaul]] to the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[[J.B. Bury]], ''The Invasion of Europe by the Barbarians'', lecture IX [http://www.northvegr.org/lore/bury/017.php (e-text)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, he captured [[Metz]]. Other cities attacked can be determined by the [[hagiographic]] ''[[biography|vita]]e'' written to commemorate their bishops: [[Nicasius of Rheims|Nicasius]] was slaughtered before the altar of his church in [[Rheims]]; [[Servatus]] is alleged to have saved [[Tongeren]] with his prayers, as Saint [[Genevieve]] is to have saved Paris.&lt;ref&gt;The ''vitae'' are summarized in Thomas Hodgkin, ''Italy and Her Invaders'' (New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1967 reprint of the original 1880–89 edition), volume II pp. 128ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lupus of Troyes|Lupus]], bishop of [[Troyes]], is also credited with saving his city by meeting Attila in person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Catholic Online |url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=712 |title=St. Lupus – Saints &amp; Angels – Catholic Online |publisher=Catholic.org |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aëtius moved to oppose Attila, gathering troops from among the [[Franks]], the [[Burgundians]], and the [[Celts]]. A mission by [[Avitus]], and Attila's continued westward advance, convinced the Visigoth king [[Theodoric I]] (Theodorid) to ally with the Romans. The combined armies reached [[Orléans]] ahead of Attila,&lt;ref&gt;Later accounts of the battle site the Huns either already within the city or in the midst of storming it when the Roman-Visigoth army arrived; Jordanes mentions no such thing. See Bury, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; thus checking and turning back the Hunnish advance. Aëtius gave chase and caught the Huns at a place usually assumed to be near Catalaunum (modern [[Châlons-en-Champagne]]). The two armies clashed in the [[Battle of Châlons]], whose outcome is commonly considered to be a strategic victory for the Visigothic-Roman alliance. Theodoric was killed in the fighting and Aëtius failed to press his advantage, according to Edward Gibbon and Edward Creasy, because he feared the consequences of an overwhelming Visigothic triumph as much as he did a defeat. From Aëtius' point of view, the best outcome was what occurred: Theodoric died, Attila was in retreat and disarray, and the Romans had the benefit of appearing victorious.

==Invasion of Italy and death==
Attila returned in 452 to claim his marriage to Honoria anew, invading and ravaging Italy along the way. The city of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] was founded as a result of these attacks when the residents fled to small islands in the [[Venetian Lagoon]]. His army sacked numerous cities and [[razed Aquileia]] completely, leaving no trace of it behind. Legend has it he built a castle on top of a hill north of Aquileia to watch the city burn, thus founding the town of [[Udine]], where the castle can still be found. Aëtius, who lacked the strength to offer battle, managed to harass and slow Attila's advance with only a shadow force. Attila finally halted at the [[Po River|River Po]]. By this point disease and starvation may have broken out in Attila's camp, thus helping to stop his invasion.
[[Image:Leoattila-Raphael.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]'s ''The Meeting between Leo the Great and Attila'' depicts Leo, escorted by [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], meeting with the [[Hun]] king outside [[Rome]].]]

Emperor [[Valentinian III]] sent three envoys, the high civilian officers [[Gennadius Avienus]] and [[Trigetius]], as well as the Bishop of Rome [[Pope Leo I|Leo I]], who met Attila at [[Mincio]] in the vicinity of [[Mantua]], and obtained from him the promise that he would withdraw from Italy and negotiate peace with the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{ws|&quot;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Pope St. Leo I (the Great)|Pope St. Leo I (the Great)]]&quot; in the 1913 ''Catholic Encyclopedia''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prosper of Aquitaine]] gives a short, reliable description of the historic meeting, but gives all the credit of the successful negotiation to Leo. Priscus reports that superstitious fear of the fate of [[Alaric I|Alaric]]—who died shortly after sacking Rome in 410—gave him pause.

In reality, Italy had suffered from a terrible famine in 451 and her crops were faring little better in 452; Attila's devastating invasion of the plains of northern Italy this year did not improve the harvest.&lt;ref&gt;E.A. Thompson, The Huns, ''revised with an afterword by Peter Heather'', Blackwell Publishers, 1996. p.161&lt;/ref&gt; To advance on Rome would have required supplies which were not available in Italy, and taking the city would not have improved Attila's supply situation. Therefore, it was more profitable for Attila to conclude peace and retreat back to his homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson-Heather, pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, an East Roman force had crossed the Danube under the command of another officer also named Aetius—who had participated in the [[Council of Chalcedon]] the previous year—and proceeded to defeat the Huns who had been left behind by Attila to safeguard their home territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson-Heather, p.163&quot;&gt;Thompson-Heather, p.163&lt;/ref&gt; Attila, hence, faced heavy human and natural pressures to retire &quot;from Italy without ever setting foot south of the [[Po (river)|Po]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson-Heather, p.163&quot;/&gt; As [[Hydatius]] writes:&lt;ref&gt;Hydatius, Chron Min. ii pp.26ff&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|''The Huns, who had been plundering Italy and who had also stormed a number of cities, were victims of divine punishment, being visited with heaven-sent disasters: famine and some kind of disaster. In addition, they were slaughtered by auxiliaries sent by the Emperor [[Marcian]] and led by Aetius, at the same time, they were crushed in their [home] settlements....Thus crushed, they made peace with the Romans and all retired to their homes''.|Hydatius|Chron Min. ii pp.26ff}}

After Attila left Italy and returned to his palace across the Danube, he planned to strike at Constantinople again and reclaim the tribute which Marcian had stopped. (Marcian was the successor of Theodosius and had ceased paying tribute in late 450 while Attila was occupied in the west; multiple invasions by the Huns and others had left the Balkans with little to plunder). However, Attila died in the early months of 453. The conventional account, from Priscus, says that at a feast celebrating his latest marriage to the beautiful and young [[Ildico]] (if uncorrupted, the name suggests a [[Goths|Gothic]] origin)&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, The Huns, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; he suffered a severe [[Epistaxis|nosebleed]] and choked to death in a stupor. An alternative theory is that he succumbed to [[internal bleeding]] after heavy drinking or a condition called [[esophageal varices]], where dilated veins in the lower part of the [[esophagus]] [[rupture]] leading to death by hemorrhage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Man | first = Nigel | title = Attila| publisher = Thomas Dunne Books | year = 2006 | page = 264 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=hF5mpUTy1z0C&amp;pg=PA264&amp;lpg=PA264&amp;dq=esophageal+varices%2Battila | isbn = 9780312349394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another account of his death, first recorded 80 years after the events by the Roman chronicler [[Count Marcellinus]], reports that &quot;Attila, King of the Huns and ravager of the provinces of Europe, was pierced by the hand and blade of his wife.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcellinus Comes]], ''Chronicon'' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/marcellinus.html (e-text)], quoted in Hector Munro Chadwick: ''The Heroic Age'' (London, [[Cambridge University Press]], 1926), p. 39 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' and the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' also claim that King Atli (Attila) died at the hands of his wife, [[Gudrun]].&lt;ref&gt;''Volsunga Saga'', [http://www.northvegr.org/lore/volsunga/021.php Chapter 39]; ''Poetic Edda'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe35.htm Atlamol En Grönlenzku, The Greenland Ballad of Atli]&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars reject these accounts as no more than hearsay, preferring instead the account given by Attila's contemporary Priscus. Priscus' version, however, has recently come under renewed scrutiny by Michael A. Babcock.&lt;ref&gt;Babcock, Michael A. ''The Night Attila Died: Solving the Murder of Attila the Hun'', Berkley Books, 2005 ISBN 0-425-20272-0&lt;/ref&gt; Based on detailed [[philological]] analysis, Babcock concludes that the account of natural death, given by Priscus, was an ecclesiastical &quot;cover story&quot; and that Emperor Marcian (who ruled the Eastern Roman Empire from 450 to 457) was the political force behind Attila's death.

Jordanes says: &quot;The greatest of all warriors should be mourned with no feminine lamentations and with no tears, but with the blood of men.&quot; His horsemen galloped in circles around the silken tent where Attila lay in state, singing in his [[dirge]], according to [[Cassiodorus]] and Jordanes: &quot;Who can rate this as death, when none believes it calls for vengeance?&quot;

Then they celebrated a ''strava'' (lamentation) over his burial place with great feasting. Legend says that he was laid to rest in a triple coffin made of gold, silver, and iron, along with some of the spoils of his conquests. His men diverted a section of the river, buried the coffin under the riverbed, and then were killed to keep the exact location a secret.

His sons [[Ellac]] (his appointed successor), [[Dengizich]], and [[Ernakh]] fought over the division of his legacy, specifically which vassal kings would belong to which brother. As a consequence they were divided, defeated and scattered the following year in the [[Battle of Nedao]] by the Ostrogoths and the [[Gepids]] under [[Ardaric]] who had been Attila's most prized chieftain.

Attila's many children and relatives are known by name and some even by deeds, but soon valid genealogical sources all but dry up and there seems to be no verifiable way to trace Attila's descendants. This has not stopped many genealogists from attempting to reconstruct a [[descent from antiquity|valid line of descent]] for various medieval rulers. One of the most credible claims has been that of the khans of [[Bulgaria]] (see [[Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans]]). A popular, but ultimately unconfirmed, attempt tries to relate Attila to [[Charlemagne]].

Some histories and chronicles describe him as a great and noble king, and he plays major roles in three Norse [[sagas]]: ''[[Atlakviða]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe34.htm Atlakvitha en grönlenzka] Henry Adams Bellows' translation and commentary&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Volsunga saga|Völsungasaga]]'',&lt;ref&gt;R.

In modern Hungary and in Turkey &quot;Attila&quot; and its Turkish variation &quot;Atilla&quot; are commonly used as a male first name. In Hungary, several public places are named after Attila; for instance, in [[Budapest]] there are 10 Attila Streets, one of which is an important street behind the [[Buda Castle]]. When the [[Turkish Armed Forces]] invaded [[Cyprus]] in 1974, the operations were named after Attila (''Atilla I'' and ''Atilla II'').&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Wright,Thomas Edmund Farnsworth Wright, ''A dictionary of world history'', Oxford University Press, 2006, ISBN 9780199202478, p. 41.

[[File:Aegean Sea map.png|thumb|right|300px]]
[[File:Location Aegean Sea.png|thumb|right|300px]]

The '''Aegean Sea''' ({{lang-el|Αιγαίο Πέλαγος}}, ''Egeo Pelagos'' {{IPA-el|eˈʝeo ˈpelaɣos||Ell-Aigaio Pelagos.ogg}};  {{lang-tr|Ege Denizi}} or historically {{lang-tr|Adalar Denizi}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzkk.tsk.tr/turkce/BunlariBiliyormuydunuz/EgeDenizininOrjinalAdi.php Ege Denizinin Orijinal Adı Nedir?, Turkish Naval Force web site (in Turkish)] &lt;/ref&gt;) is an elongated embayment of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] located between the southern [[Balkans|Balkan]] and [[Anatolia]]n [[peninsula]]s, i.e., between the mainlands of [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]]. In the north, it is connected to the [[Marmara Sea]] and [[Black Sea]] by the [[Dardanelles]] and [[Bosporus]]. The [[Aegean Islands]] are within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including [[Crete]] and [[Rhodes]]. The [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean Region]] consists of nine provinces in southwestern Turkey, in part bordering on the Aegean sea.

The sea was traditionally known as '''''[[Archipelago]]''''' (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], ''Αρχιπέλαγος''), the general sense of which has since changed to refer to the Aegean Islands and, generally, to any island group because the Aegean Sea is remarkable for its large number of islands.

==Geography==
[[File:Aegean Sea map bathymetry-fr.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Topographic map|Topographical]] and [[Bathymetric chart|bathymetric]] map]]

The Aegean Sea covers about {{convert|214000|km2}} in area, and measures about {{convert|610|km}} longitudinally and {{convert|300|km}} latitudinally. The sea's maximum depth is {{convert|3543|m}}, east of Crete. The [[Aegean Islands]] are found within its waters, with the following islands delimiting the sea on the south (generally from west to east): [[Kythera]], [[Antikythera]], Crete, [[Kasos]], [[Karpathos]] and Rhodes.

The Aegean Islands, which almost all belong to Greece, can be simply divided into seven groups: 

#[[List of Aegean Islands#The North Aegean Islands|Northeastern Aegean Islands]]
#[[Euboea]]
#Northern [[Sporades]]
#[[Cyclades]]
#[[Saronic Islands]] (or ''[[Argo-Saronic Islands]]'')
#[[Dodecanese]] (or ''Southern Sporades''), with the exclusion of [[Kastelorizo]]
#[[Crete]]

The word ''[[archipelago]]'' was originally applied specifically to the Aegean Sea and its islands. Many of the Aegean Islands, or chains of islands, are actually extensions of the mountains on the mainland. One chain extends across the sea to [[Chios]], another extends across [[Euboea]] to [[Samos Island|Samos]], and a third extends across the [[Peloponnese]] and Crete to Rhodes, dividing the Aegean from the Mediterranean.

The bays and gulfs of the Aegean beginning and the South and moving clockwise include on Crete, the [[Mirabelli Gulf|Mirabelli]], [[Almyros Bay|Almyros]], [[Souda Bay|Souda]] and [[Gulf of Chania|Chania]] bays or gulfs, on the mainland the [[Myrtoan Sea]] to the west, the [[Saronic Gulf]] northwestward, the [[Petalies Gulf]] which connects with the [[Gulf of Euboea|South Euboic Sea]], the [[Pagasetic Gulf]] which connects with the [[Gulf of Euboea|North Euboic Sea]], the [[Thermian Gulf]] northwestward, the [[Chalkidiki]] Peninsula including the [[Cassandra Gulf|Cassandra]] and the [[Singitic Gulf]]s, northward the [[Strymonian Gulf]] and the [[Gulf of Kavala]] and the rest are in [[Turkey]]; [[Saros Gulf]], [[Edremit (District), Balıkesir|Edremit]] Gulf, Dikili Gulf, Çandarlı Gulf, [[İzmir]] Gulf, [[Kuşadası]] Gulf, [[Gulf of Gökova]], [[Güllük]] Gulf.

===Extent===
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Aegean Sea as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S23_1953.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrography===
[[File:Cliffs of Santorini.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The cliffs in Santorini Island, [[Greece]]]]
Aegean surface water circulates in a counter-clockwise gyre, with [[hypersaline]] Mediterranean water moving northward along the west coast of [[Turkey]], before being displaced by less dense [[Black Sea]] outflow. The dense [[Mediterranean]] water sinks below the Black Sea inflow to a depth of {{convert|23|-|30|m}}, then flows through the [[Dardanelles Strait]] and into the [[Sea of Marmara]] at velocities of 5–15&amp;nbsp;cm/s. The Black Sea outflow moves westward along the northern Aegean Sea, then flows southwards along the east coast of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Aksu, A. E., D. Yasar, et al. (1995). &quot;LATE GLACIAL-HOLOCENE PALEOCLIMATIC AND PALEOCEANOGRAPHIC EVOLUTION OF THE AEGEAN SEA – MICROPALEONTOLOGICAL AND STABLE ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE.&quot; Marine Micropaleontology 25(1): 1–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical oceanography of the Aegean Sea is controlled mainly by the regional climate, the fresh water discharge from major rivers draining southeastern Europe, and the seasonal variations in the Black Sea surface water outflow through the [[Dardanelles Strait]].

Analysis&lt;ref&gt;Yagar, D., 1994. Late glacial-Holocene evolution of the Aegean Sea. Ph.D. Thesis, Inst. Mar. Sci. Technol., Dokuz Eyltil Univ., 329 pp. (Unpubl.)&lt;/ref&gt; of the Aegean during 1991 and 1992 revealed 3 distinct water masses:

*'''Aegean Sea Surface Water''' – {{convert|40|-|50|m}} thick veneer, with summer temperatures of 21–26&amp;nbsp;°C and winter temperatures ranging from {{convert|10|°C}} in the north to {{convert|16|°C}} in the south.
*'''Aegean Sea Intermediate Water''' – Aegean Sea Intermediate Water extends from 40–50&amp;nbsp;m to {{convert|200|-|300|m}} with temperatures ranging from 11–18&amp;nbsp;°C.
*'''Aegean Sea Bottom Water''' – occurring at depths below 500–1000&amp;nbsp;m with a very uniform temperature (13–14&amp;nbsp;°C) and salinity (39.1–39.2%).

==Etymology==
In ancient times, there were various explanations for the name ''Aegean''. It was said to have been named after the Greek town of [[Aegae (Achaea)|Aegae]], or after [[Aegea]], a queen of the [[Amazons]] who died in the sea, or Aigaion, the &quot;sea goat&quot;, another name of [[Briareus]], one of the archaic [[Hecatonchires]], or, especially among the Athenians, [[Aegeus]], the father of [[Theseus]], who drowned himself in the sea when he thought his son had died.

A possible etymology is a derivation from the Greek word ''{{Polytonic|αἶγες}}'' &amp;ndash; ''aiges'' = &quot;''waves''&quot; ([[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] [[Alexandria|of Alexandria]]; metaphorical use of {{Polytonic|αἴξ}} (''aix'') &quot;goat&quot;), hence &quot;wavy sea&quot;, cf. also {{Polytonic|αἰγιαλός}} (aigialos = aiges ''(waves)'' + hals ''(sea)''),&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dai)gialo%2Fs αἰγιαλός] at [[LSI]]&lt;/ref&gt; hence meaning &quot;sea-shore&quot;.

==History==
[[File:Aegean Sea by Piri Reis.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Historic map of Aegean Sea by [[Piri Reis]]]]
The current coastline dates back to about 4000 BC.  Before that time, at the peak of the [[last ice age]] (c. 16,000 BC) sea levels everywhere [[sea level rise|were 130 metres lower]], and there were large well-watered coastal plains instead of much of the northern Aegean. When they were first occupied, the present-day islands including [[Milos]] with its important [[obsidian]] production were probably still connected to the mainland.  The present coastal arrangement appeared c. 7000 BC, with post-ice age sea levels continuing to rise for another 3,000 years after that.&lt;ref&gt;Tjeerd H. van Andel and Judith C. Shackleton, [http://www.jstor.org/pss/529681?cookieSet=1 Late Paleolithic and Mesolithic Coastlines of Greece and the Aegean], ''Journal of Field Archaeology'', Vol. 9, No. 4 (Winter, 1982), pp. 445–454&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent [[Bronze Age]] civilizations of [[Greece]] and the Aegean Sea have given rise to the general term ''[[Aegean civilization]]''. In ancient times, the sea was the birthplace of two ancient civilizations&amp;nbsp;– the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]] of Crete and the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean]] Civilization of the [[Peloponnese]].&lt;ref&gt;Tracey Cullen, ''Aegean Prehistory: A Review'' (American Journal of Archaeology. Supplement, 1); Oliver Dickinson, ''The Aegean Bronze Age'' (Cambridge World Archaeology).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aegeansea.jpg|thumb|left|]]
Later arose the city-states of [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]] among many others that constituted the [[Athenian Empire]] and [[Hellenic Civilization]]. Plato described the Greeks living round the Aegean &quot;like frogs around a pond&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The familiar phrase giving rise to the title ''Prehistorians Round the Pond: Reflections on Aegean Prehistory as a Discipline'', by John F. Cherry, Despina Margomenou, and Lauren E. Talalay.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aegean Sea was later invaded by the [[Persian Empire|Persians]] and the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], and inhabited by the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Bulgarians]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoeses]], the [[Seljuq Turks]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Aegean was the site of the original [[democracy|democracies]], and its seaways were the means of contact among several diverse civilizations of the Eastern Mediterranean.

==Economics and politics==

Many of the islands in the Aegean have safe harbours and bays. In ancient times, navigation through the sea was easier than travelling across the rough terrain of the Greek mainland (and to some extent the coastal areas of Anatolia). Many of the islands are [[Volcano|volcanic]], and [[marble]] and [[iron]] are mined on other islands. The larger islands have some fertile valleys and plains. Of the main islands in the Aegean Sea, two belong to [[Turkey]] – [[Bozcaada]] (Tenedos) and [[Gökçeada]] (Imbros); the rest belong to [[Greece]]. Between the two countries, there are [[Aegean dispute|political disputes]] over several aspects of political control over the Aegean space, including the size of territorial waters, air control and the [[delimitation]] of economic rights to the [[continental shelf]].

'''''A Clockwork Orange''''' is a 1962 [[dystopian novel|dystopian]] [[novella]] by [[Anthony Burgess]]. The novel contains an experiment in language: the characters often use an [[argot]] called &quot;[[Nadsat]]&quot;, derived from [[Russian language|Russian]].

In 1998, the [[Modern Library]] ranked ''A Clockwork Orange'' 65th on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]].

==Meaning of title==
Burgess gave more than one explanation for the origins of the title.  In a prefatory note to ''A Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music'', Burgess wrote that the title was a metaphor for &quot;...an organic entity, full of juice and sweetness and agreeable odour, being turned into an automaton.&quot;&lt;ref name=dexter/&gt;

In his essay, &quot;Clockwork Oranges,&quot; [[#References|²]] Burgess asserts that &quot;this title would be appropriate for a story about the application of [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlovian]] or mechanical laws to an organism which, like a fruit, was capable of colour and sweetness.&quot; This title alludes to the protagonist's positively conditioned responses to feelings of evil which prevent the exercise of his [[free will]].  To reverse this conditioning, the protagonist is subjected to a technique in which his emotional responses to violence are systematically paired with a negative stimulation in the form of nausea caused by an emetic medicine administered just before the presentation of films depicting violent, and &quot;ultra-violent&quot; situations.

==Plot summary==
===Part 1: Alex's world===

[[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]], a teenager living in near-future England, leads his gang on nightly orgies of opportunistic, random &quot;ultra-violence.&quot; Alex's friends (&quot;droogs&quot; in the novel's Anglo-Russified slang, [[Nadsat]]) are Dim, a slow-witted bruiser who is the gang's muscle; Georgie, an ambitious second-in-command; and Pete, who mostly plays along as the droogs indulge their taste for ultra-violence. Alex is characterized as a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] and a hardened juvenile delinquent; he is nonetheless intelligent and quick-witted, with sophisticated taste in music. He is particularly fond of [[Beethoven]], or &quot;Lovely Ludwig Van.&quot;

The novel begins with the droogs sitting in their favourite hangout, drinking drugged milk, called &quot;milk-plus&quot;, to hype themselves for the night's mayhem. They [[assault]] a scholar walking home from the library, stomp a panhandling derelict, scuffle with a rival gang, then rob a newsstand and leave its owners bloodied and unconscious. Joyriding through the countryside in a stolen car, they break into an isolated cottage and maul the young couple living there, beating the husband and [[rape|raping]] his wife. In a [[metafiction]]al touch, the husband is a writer working on a manuscript called &quot;A Clockwork Orange,&quot; and Alex contemptuously reads out a paragraph that states the novel's main theme before shredding the manuscript. Back at the milk bar, Alex punishes Dim for some crude behaviour, and strains within the gang become apparent. At home in his dreary flat, Alex plays [[classical music]] at top volume while fantasizing of even more orgiastic violence. 

Alex skips school the next day. Following an unexpected visit from P.R. Deltoid, his &quot;post-corrective advisor,&quot; Alex meets a pair of underage girls and takes them back to his parents' flat, where he administers them hard drugs and then rapes them. That evening, Alex finds his droogs in a mutinous mood. Georgie challenges Alex for leadership of the gang, demanding that they pull a &quot;man-sized&quot; job. Alex quells the rebellion by slashing Dim's hand and fighting with Georgie, then in a show of generosity takes them to a bar, where Alex insists on following through on Georgie's idea to burgle the home of a wealthy old woman. The break-in starts as farce and ends in murder as Alex kills the elderly woman. His escape is blocked by Dim, who leaves him disabled on the front step as the police arrive.

===Part 2: Ludovico's Technique===

Sentenced to prison for murder, Alex works in the prison library and gets taken under the wing of the prison chaplain, who mistakes Alex's [[Bible]] studies for stirrings of faith (Alex is actually reading Scripture for the violent passages). After Alex beats a troublesome cellmate to death, he is accepted into an experimental behaviour-modification treatment called the Ludovico Technique. The technique is a form of [[aversion therapy]] in which Alex is injected with a drug that makes him feel sick and is forced to watch graphically violent films, eventually conditioning him to suffer crippling bouts of nausea at the mere thought of violence. As an unintended consequence, the soundtrack to one of the films &amp;mdash; [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] &amp;mdash; renders Alex unable to listen to his beloved classical music.

The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated to a group of VIPs, who watch as Alex collapses before a whalloping bully, and abases himself before a scantily-clad young woman whose presence has aroused his predatory sexual inclinations. Though the prison chaplain accuses the state of stripping Alex of free will, the government officials on the scene are pleased with the results and Alex is released into society.

===Part 3: After prison===

Barred from returning home (his parents are now renting his room to a lodger), the defenseless Alex wanders the streets and accidentally encounters his former victims, all of whom are keen for revenge. The policemen who come to Alex's rescue turn out to be none other than Dim and former gang rival Billyboy. Dazed and bloodied, Alex collapses at the door of an isolated cottage, realising too late that it is the house he and his droogs invaded in the first half of the story. Because the gang wore masks during the assault, Alex goes unrecognised. The writer, whose name is revealed as F. Alexander, shelters Alex and questions him about the conditioning. During this sequence, it is revealed that Mrs. Alexander died from the injuries inflicted during the gang-rape, and her husband has decided to continue &quot;where her fragrant memory persists&quot; despite the horrid memories. Though Alexander, a critic of the government, hopes to use Alex as a symbol of state brutality, he begins to suspect the worst. One of Alexander's radical associates wrangles a semi-confession from Alex, who is then subjected to a relentless barrage of classical music, prompting him to attempt [[suicide]] by leaping from a high window. 

Alex wakes up in hospital, where he is courted by government officials anxious to counter the bad publicity created by his suicide attempt. With Alexander safely packed off to a [[mental institution]], Alex is offered a cushy job if he agrees to play ball. As photographers snap pictures, Alex daydreams of orgiastic violence and realises the Ludovico conditioning has been reversed: &quot;I was cured all right.&quot;

In the final chapter, Alex has a new trio of droogs, but he is beginning to outgrow his taste for violence. A chance encounter with his old droog Pete, now married and settled down, inspires Alex to seek a wife and family of his own. He contemplates the likelihood that any son of his will also be violent, a prospect Alex views fatalistically.

==Omission of the final chapter==

The book has three parts of seven chapters each. Burgess has stated that the total of 21 chapters was an intentional nod to the age of 21 being recognised as a milestone in human maturation. The 21st chapter was omitted from the editions published in the United States prior to 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Anthony (1986) ''A Clockwork Orange Resucked'' in &lt;u&gt;A Clockwork Orange&lt;/u&gt;, [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction to the updated American text (these newer editions include the missing 21st chapter), Burgess explains that when he first brought the book to an American publisher, he was told that U.S. audiences would never go for the final chapter, in which Alex sees the error of his ways, decides he has lost all energy for and thrill from violence and resolves to turn his life around (a slow-ripening but classic moment of [[Metanoia (psychology)|metanoia]] &amp;mdash; the moment at which one's protagonist realises that everything he thought he knew was wrong).

At the American publisher's insistence, Burgess allowed their editors to cut the redeeming final chapter from the U.S. version, so that the tale would end on a note of bleak despair, with Alex succumbing to his darker nature &amp;mdash; an ending which the publisher insisted would be 'more realistic' and appealing to a U.S. audience. The film adaptation, directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]], is based on the American edition of the book (which Burgess considered to be &quot;badly flawed&quot;). Kubrick called Chapter 21 &quot;an extra chapter&quot; and claimed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html The Kubrick Site: Kubrick's comments regarding 'A Clockwork Orange'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that he had not read the original version until he had virtually finished the screenplay, and that he had never given serious consideration to using it. In Kubrick's opinion, the final chapter was unconvincing and inconsistent with the book.

==Characters==

*'''[[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]]''': The novel's [[anti-hero]] and leader among his droogs. He often refers to himself as &quot;Your Humble Narrator.&quot; (Having seduced two girls in a music shop, Alex refers to himself as &quot;Alexander the Large&quot; while ravishing them; this was later the basis for Alex's claimed surname ''DeLarge'' in the 1971 film.)

*'''George''' or '''Georgie''': Effectively Alex's greedy second-in-command. Georgie attempts to undermine Alex's status as leader of the gang. He later dies from a botched robbery attempt during Alex's stay in prison.

*'''Pete''': The most rational and least violent member of the gang. He is the only one who doesn't take particular sides when the droogs fight among themselves. He later meets and marries a girl, renouncing his old ways and even losing his former speech patterns. A chance encounter with Pete in the final chapter influences Alex's wishes to reform and become a productive member of society.

*'''Dim''': An idiotic and thoroughly gormless member of the gang, persistently condescended to by Alex, but respected to some extent by his droogs for his formidable fighting abilities, his weapon of choice being a length of bike chain. He later becomes a [[police officer]], exacting his revenge on Alex for the abuse he once suffered under his command.

*'''P. R. Deltoid''': An [[Anal-retentive|anally retentive]] [[social worker]] assigned the task of keeping Alex on the straight and narrow. He seemingly has no clue about dealing with young people, and is devoid of empathy or understanding for his troublesome charge. Indeed, when Alex is arrested for murdering an old woman, and then ferociously beaten by several police officers, Deltoid simply spits on him.

*'''The prison chaplain''': The character who first questions whether or not forced goodness is really better than chosen wickedness. The only character who is truly concerned about Alex's welfare; he is not taken seriously by Alex, though. (He is nicknamed by Alex &quot;prison charlie&quot; or &quot;chaplin,&quot; a nod to [[Charlie Chaplin]].)

*'''Billyboy''': A rival of Alex's. Early on in the story, Alex and his droogs battle Billyboy and his droogs, which ends abruptly when the police arrive. Later, after Alex is released from prison, Billyboy (along with Dim, who like Billboy has become a police officer) rescue Alex from a mob, then subsequently beat him.

*'''The governor''': The man who decides to let Alex &quot;choose&quot; to be the first reformed by the Ludovico technique.

*'''Dr. Branom''': Brodsky's colleague and co-founder of the Ludovico technique. He appears friendly and almost paternal towards Alex at first, before forcing him into the theatre to be psychologically tortured.

*'''Dr. Brodsky''': A malevolent scientist and co-founder of the Ludovico technique. He seems much more passive than Branom, and says considerably less.

*'''F. Alexander''': An author who was in the process of typing his [[Magnum_Opus|magnum opus]] ''A Clockwork Orange'', when Alex and his droogs broke into his house, beat him and then brutally [[gang rape]]d his wife, which caused her subsequent death. He is left deeply scarred by these events, and when he encounters Alex two years later he uses him as a guinea pig in a sadistic experiment intended to prove the inefficiency of the Ludovico technique.

==Analysis==
===Title===
Burgess gave three possible origins for the title:

* That he had overheard the phrase &quot;as queer as a clockwork orange&quot; in a London pub in 1945 and assumed it was a Cockney expression.[[#References|¹]] In ''Clockwork Marmalade'', an essay published in the ''[[Listener]]'' in 1972, he said that he had heard the phrase several times since that occasion. However, no other record of the expression being used before 1962 has ever appeared.&lt;ref name=dexter&gt;{{Cite book | last = Dexter | first = Gary | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Why Not Catch-21?: The Stories Behind the Titles | publisher = Frances Lincoln Ltd. | year = 2008 | location = | pages = 200–203 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0711229252}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kingsley Amis]] notes in his ''Memoirs'' (1991) that no trace of it appears in [[Eric Partridge]]'s ''Dictionary of Historical Slang''.

* His second explanation was that it was a pun on the Malay word ''orang'', meaning &quot;man&quot;. The novel contains no other Malay words or links.&lt;ref name=dexter/&gt;

* In a prefatory note to ''A Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music'', he wrote that the title was a metaphor for &quot;...an organic entity, full of juice and sweetness and agreeable odour, being turned into an automaton.&quot;&lt;ref name=dexter/&gt; In his essay, &quot;Clockwork Oranges,&quot; [[#References|²]] Burgess asserts that &quot;this title would be appropriate for a story about the application of [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlovian]] or mechanical laws to an organism which, like a fruit, was capable of colour and sweetness.&quot; This title alludes to the protagonist's negatively conditioned responses to feelings of evil, which prevent the exercise of his [[free will]].

===Point of view===

''A Clockwork Orange'' is written using a narrative first-person singular perspective of a seemingly biased and [[unreliable narrator]]. The [[protagonist]], Alex, never justifies his actions in the narration, giving a sense that he is somewhat sincere; a narrator who, as unlikeable as he may attempt to seem, evokes pity from the reader by telling of his unending suffering, and later through his realisation that the cycle will never end. Alex's perspective is effective in that the way that he describes events is easy to relate to, even if the situations themselves are not.

===Use of slang===&lt;!--&quot;Ultra-violence&quot; redirects here, please update if renamed --&gt;

{{Main|Nadsat}}
The book, narrated by Alex, contains many words in a slang argot which Burgess invented for the book, called [[Nadsat]]. It is a mix of modified [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] words, [[rhyming slang]], derived Russian (like ''baboochka''), and words invented by Burgess himself. For instance, these terms have the following meanings in Nadsat: ''droog'' = friend; ''korova'' = cow; ''risp'' = shirt; ''golova'' ('gulliver') = head; ''malchick'' or ''malchickiwick'' = boy; ''soomka'' = sack or bag; ''Bog'' = God; ''khorosho'' ('horrorshow') = good; ''prestoopnick'' = criminal; ''rooka'' ('rooker') = hand; ''cal'' = crap; ''veck'' ('chelloveck') = man or guy; ''litso'' = face; ''malenky'' = little; and so on. 

One of Alex's doctors explains the language to a colleague as &quot;odd bits of old rhyming slang; a bit of [[Romani people|gypsy]] talk, too. But most of the roots are Slav propaganda. [[Subliminal message|Subliminal]] penetration.&quot; Some words are not derived from anything, but merely easy to guess, e.g. 'in-out, in-out' or 'the old in-out' means sexual intercourse. ''Cutter,'' however, means 'money,' because 'cutter' rhymes with 'bread-and-butter'; this is [[rhyming slang]], which is intended to be impenetrable to outsiders (especially eavesdropping policemen).

In the first edition of the book, no key was provided, and the reader was left to interpret the meaning from the context. In his appendix to the restored edition, Burgess explained that the slang would keep the book from seeming dated, and served to muffle &quot;the raw response of pornography&quot; from the acts of violence. Furthermore, in a novel where a form of [[brainwashing]] plays a role, the narrative itself brainwashes the reader into understanding Nadsat.

The term &quot;ultraviolence,&quot; referring to excessive and/or unjustified [[violence]], was [[Neologism|coined]] by Burgess in the book, which includes the phrase &quot;do the ultra-violent.&quot; The term's association with [[Aestheticization of violence|aesthetic violence]] has led to its use in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=AFP |title=Gruesome 'Saw 4' slashes through North American box-office |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gKh4MPBUr7_ZFvg7tyPFe1IXCAXw |id= |date=2007-10-29 |accessdate=2008-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Q&amp;A With 'Hostel' Director Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino - New York Magazine |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/features/15436/ |accessdate=2008-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ADV Announces New Gantz Collection, Final Guyver &amp; More: Nov 6 Releases |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-09-06/adv-announces-new-gantz-collection-final-guyver-and-more-nov-6-releases |accessdate=2008-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=&quot;Manhunt 2&quot;: Most Violent Game Yet?, Critics Say New Video Game Is Too Realistic; Players Must Torture, Kill - CBS News |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/30/eveningnews/eyeontech/main3433101.shtml |work= |author=CBS News |date= 30 October 2007|accessdate=2008-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Author's dismissal===

In 1985, Burgess published the book ''Flame into Being: The Life and Work of D. H. Lawrence'' (Heinemann, London), and while discussing ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' in the concluding chapter, he compared that novel's notoriety with ''A Clockwork Orange'': &quot;We all suffer from the popular desire to make the known notorious. The book I am best known for, or only known for, is a novel I am prepared to repudiate: written a quarter of a century ago, a [[mind game|''jeu d'esprit'']] knocked off for money in three weeks, it became known as the raw material for a film which seemed to glorify sex and violence. The film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the misunderstanding will pursue me till I die. I should not have written the book because of this danger of misinterpretation, and the same may be said of Lawrence and ''Lady Chatterley's Lover''.&quot;

==Adaptations==
===Cinema===
*The best known adaptation of the novel to other forms is the 1971 film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' by [[Stanley Kubrick]], starring [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Alex.
*A 1965 film by [[Andy Warhol]] entitled ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]'' was an adaptation of Burgess' novel.
*In 1983, Burgess said in an interview with [[Belgium|Belgian]] television, that in the '60s the [[Rolling Stones]] were interested in starring in a film adaption.
*McDowell's performance as Alex was one of [[Heath Ledger]]'s inspirations for his portrayal of [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] in ''[[The Dark Knight]]''.

===Television===

Excerpts from the first two chapters of the novel were dramatised and broadcast on [[BBC TV]]'s programme ''Tonight'', 1962 (now lost, believed wiped).

===Stage===

After Kubrick's film was released, Burgess wrote a ''Clockwork Orange'' stage play. In it, Dr. Branom defects from the psychiatric clinic when he grasps that the aversion therapy has destroyed Alex's ability to enjoy music. The play also restores the novel's original ending. 

In 1988, a [[Germany|German]] adaptation of ''Clockwork Orange'' at the intimate theatre of [[Bad Godesberg]] featured a musical score by the German [[punk rock]] band [[Die Toten Hosen]] which, combined with orchestral clips of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] and &quot;other dirty melodies&quot; (so stated by the subtitle), was released on the album ''[[Ein kleines bisschen Horrorschau]]''. The track ''[[Hier kommt Alex]]'' became one of the band's signature songs.

(photo: Peter Zuehlke) ]]
In February 1990, another musical version was produced at the Barbican Theatre in [[London]] by the Royal Shakespeare Company. Titled ''A Clockwork Orange: 2004'', it received mostly negative reviews, with John Peter of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' of London calling it &quot;only an intellectual ''[[Rocky Horror Show]]'',&quot; and John Gross of ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' calling it &quot;a clockwork lemon.&quot; Even Burgess himself, who wrote the script based on his novel, was disappointed. According to ''[[The Evening Standard]]'', he called the score, written by [[Bono]] and [[The Edge]] of the rock group [[U2 (band)|U2]], &quot;neo-wallpaper.&quot; Burgess had originally worked alongside the director of the production, Ron Daniels, and envisioned a musical score that was entirely classical. Unhappy with the decision to abandon that score, he heavily criticised the band's experimental mix of [[hip hop]], [[liturgy|liturgical]] and [[gothic music]]. Lise Hand of ''[[The Irish Independent]]'' reported The Edge as saying that Burgess' original conception was &quot;a score written by a novelist rather than a songwriter.&quot; Calling it &quot;meaningless glitz,&quot; Jane Edwardes of ''20/20 Magazine'' said that watching this production was &quot;like being invited to an expensive French Restaurant - and being served with a [[Big Mac]].&quot;

In 1994, Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater put on a production of A Clockwork Orange directed by Terry Kinney.  The American premiere of novelist Anthony Burgess' own adaptation of his &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; starred K. Todd Freeman as Alex.  The stage design featured an extremely tall wall that housed the musicians.

In 2001, UNI Theatre (Mississauga, Ontario) presented the [[Canada|Canadian]] premiere of the play under the direction of Terry Costa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mirateca.com/archives/archives/unitheatre19972001/default.aspx Mirateca Arts Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Godlight Theatre Company presented the New York Premiere adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'' at [[Manhattan Theatre Source]]. The production went on to play at the SoHo Playhouse (2002), Ensemble Studio Theatre (2004), 59E59 Theaters (2005) and the [[Edinburgh Fringe|Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] (2005). While at [[Edinburgh]], the production received rave reviews from the press while playing to sold-out audiences. The production was directed by Godlight's Artistic Director, Joe Tantalo.

In 2003, Los Angeles director [[Brad Mays]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bradmays.com/ Brad Mays]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[ARK Theatre Company]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arktheatre.org/ Ark Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; staged a [[multi-media]] adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bradmays.com/clockwork.html Production Photos from ''A Clockwork Orange,'' 2003, ARK Theatre Company, directed by Brad Mays]&lt;/ref&gt; which was named &quot;Pick Of The Week&quot; by the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' and nominated for three of the 2004 [[LA Weekly Theater Award]]s: Direction, Revival Production (of a 20th-century work), and Leading Female Performance.

In order to preserve the first-person narrative of the book, a pre-recorded video stream of Alex, &quot;your humble narrator,&quot; was projected onto the 40-inch monitor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bradmays.com/images/37.jpg Brad Mays (image)]&lt;/ref&gt; thereby freeing the onstage character during passages which would have been awkward or impossible to sustain in the breaking of the fourth wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bradmays.com/gallery/clockwork_orange.html Brad Mays Gallery: A Clockwork Orange]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''LA Weekly'', &quot;Mays' visceral, fast-paced multimedia show brings into stark relief the [[Freud]]ian struggle between the primal self and the civilized self for domination over the human spirit. The director deftly conveys the horror of violence by subjecting the audience to an onslaught of images of war, [[torture]] and [[hardcore pornography|hardcore porn]] projected on seven TV screens.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bradmays.com/reviews.html Brad Mays Reviews]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010 a live and improvised stage adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'' was performed by the comedy group [[BOOK CLUB]] at the [[I.O. West]] theater in [[Hollywood, California]].

===Music===
The Brazilian heavy metal group [[Sepultura]] used the plot of ''A Clockwork Orange'' for their concept album ''[[A-Lex]]''.  The name of the album is a pun on the main character's name; in [[Latin]], the expression ''a-lex'' means &quot;without law.&quot;

[[France|French]] punk rock band [[Berurier Noir]] used one of Burgess' main themes in their song &quot;[[Porcherie]]&quot; when they say &quot;Beethov' devient ultraviolence.&quot;

The [[Kottonmouth Kings]] used ''A Clockwork Orange'' for the theme for two videos [&quot;Stomp&quot; and &quot;Rampage&quot;] off of their latest album ''[[Long Live the Kings]]''.

'''Amsterdam''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|æ|m|s|t|ər|d|æ|m}}; Dutch {{IPA-nl|ˌɑmstərˈdɑm||Nl-Amsterdam.ogg}}) is the capital and largest city of the [[Netherlands]], with a population of 780,152 within city limits, an urban population of 1,209,419 and a metropolitan population of 2,158,592.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/visiting/touristinformation/aboutamsterdam/factsandfigures]&lt;/ref&gt; The city is in the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[North Holland]] in the west of the country. It comprises the northern part of the [[Randstad]], the [[List of metropolitan areas in Europe by population|sixth-largest]] metropolitan area in Europe, with a population of approximately 8.1&amp;nbsp;million according to larger estimates.

Its name is derived from ''Amstelredamme'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica Eleven&quot;&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]], Vol 1, p896-898.&lt;/ref&gt; indicative of the city's origin: a dam in the river [[Amstel]]. Settled as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most important ports in the world during the [[Dutch Golden Age]], a result of its innovative developments in trade. During that time, the city was the leading center for finance and diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521845359&amp;ss=exc Cambridge.org], Capitals of Capital -A History of International Financial Centres – 1780–2005, Youssef Cassis, ISBN 978-0521845359&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 19th and 20th centuries, [[Expansion of Amsterdam since the 19th century|the city expanded]], and many new neighbourhoods and suburbs were formed.
The 17th-century [[canals of Amsterdam]] (in Dutch: 'Grachtengordel'), located in the heart of Amsterdam, were added to the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]] in July 2010.

The city is the financial and cultural capital of the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;After Athens in 1888 and Florence in 1986, Amsterdam was in 1986 chosen as the [[European Capital of Culture]], confirming its eminent position in Europe and the Netherlands. See  [http://ec.europa.eu/culture/our-programmes-and-actions/doc443_en.htm EC.europa.eu] for an overview of the European cities and capitals of culture over the years.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many large Dutch institutions have their headquarters there, and 7 of the world's top 500 companies, including [[Philips]] and [[ING Group|ING]], are based in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/18/biz_2000global08_The-Global-2000-Netherlands_10Rank.html Forbes.com], [[Forbes Global 2000]] Largest Companies – Dutch rankings.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Amsterdam was ranked 13th globally on quality of living&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/features/quality_survey.html |title=Best cities in the world (Mercer) |publisher=City Mayors |date=26 May 2010 |accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Mercer, and previously ranked 3rd in innovation by 2thinknow in the Innovation Cities Index 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovation-cities.com/2thinknow-innovation-cities-global-256-index/ |title=2thinknow Innovation Cities Global 256 Index – worldwide innovation city rankings |publisher=Innovation-cities.com |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Amsterdam}}
The earliest recorded use of the name &quot;Amsterdam&quot; is from a certificate dated 27 October 1275, when the inhabitants, who had built a bridge with a dam across the [[Amstel]], were exempted from paying a [[toll bridge|bridge toll]] by Count [[Floris V, Count of Holland|Floris V]].&lt;ref name=&quot;language&quot;&gt;{{cite book

In October 2008, [[historical geography|historical geographer]] Chris de Bont suggested that the land around Amsterdam was being reclaimed as early as the late 10th century. This does not  necessarily mean that there was already a settlement then since [[land reclamation|reclamation of land]] may not have been for farming—it may have been for [[peat]], used as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/news/1801750/80/rss/%27Amsterdam_200_jaar_ouder_dan_aangenomen%27.html|title=Amsterdam 200 jaar ouder dan aangenomen|accessdate=22 October 2008|date=22 October 2008|publisher=Nu.nl|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 14th century on, Amsterdam flourished, largely because of trade with the [[Hanseatic League]]. In 1345, an alleged [[Blessed Sacrament|Eucharistic miracle]] in the [[Kalverstraat]] rendered the city an important place of pilgrimage until the [[Protestant Reformation|adoption of the Protestant faith]]. The ''[[Stille Omgang]]''—a silent [[procession]] in civil attire—is today a remnant of the rich pilgrimage history.&lt;ref name=&quot;stilleomgang&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In the 16th century, the Dutch rebelled against [[Philip II of Spain]] and his successors. The main reasons for the uprising were the imposition of new taxes, the tenth penny, and the [[religious persecution]] of [[Protestantism|Protestants]] by the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. The revolt escalated into the [[Eighty Years' War]], which ultimately led to Dutch independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;80yearswar&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The 17th century is considered Amsterdam's ''[[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age]]'', during which it became the wealthiest city in the world.&lt;ref&gt;E. Haverkamp-Bergmann, Rembrandt; The Night Watch (New Jersey: [[Princeton University Press]], 1982), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Ships sailed from Amsterdam to the [[Baltic Sea]], North America, and Africa, as well as present-day Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and Brazil, forming the basis of a worldwide trading network. Amsterdam's merchants had the largest share in both the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]]. These companies acquired overseas possessions that later became [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colonies]]. Amsterdam was Europe's most important point for the shipment of goods and was the leading [[Financial centre|Financial Centre]] of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncp.edu/home/rwb/Amsterdam_l.html Amsterdam in the 17th Century], The University of [[North Carolina]] at Pembroke&lt;/ref&gt; In 1602, the Amsterdam office of the Dutch East India Company became the world's first [[stock exchange]] by trading in its own shares.&lt;ref name=&quot;The oldest share&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Amsterdam lost over 10% of its population to [[plague (disease)|plague]] in 1623–1625, and again in 1635–1636, 1655, and 1664. Nevertheless, the population of Amsterdam rose in the 17th century (largely through immigration) from 50,000 to 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/351/351-012.htm Geography, climate, population, economy, society].

Amsterdam's prosperity declined during the 18th and early 19th centuries. The [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|wars]] of the [[Dutch Republic]] with [[Kingdom of England|England]] and France took their toll on Amsterdam. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Amsterdam's significance reached its lowest point, with Holland being absorbed into the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. However, the later establishment of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815 marked a turning point.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; New museums, a train station, and the [[Concertgebouw]] were built; in this same time, the [[Industrial Revolution]] reached the city. The [[Amsterdam–Rhine Canal|Amsterdam-Rhine Canal]] was dug to give Amsterdam a direct connection to the [[Rhine]], and the [[North Sea Canal]] was dug to give the port a shorter connection to the [[North Sea]]. Both projects dramatically improved commerce with the rest of Europe and the world. In 1906, [[Joseph Conrad]] gave a brief description of Amsterdam as seen from the seaside, in [[q:Joseph Conrad#The Mirror of the Sea (1906)|''The Mirror of the Sea'']]. Shortly before the First World War, the city began expanding, and new suburbs were built. Even though the Netherlands remained neutral in this war, Amsterdam suffered a food shortage, and heating fuel became scarce. The shortages sparked riots in which several people were killed. These riots are known as the ''Aardappeloproer'' (Potato rebellion). People started looting stores and warehouses in order to get supplies, mainly food.&lt;ref name=&quot;aardappeloproer&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[Nazi Germany|Germany]] [[Battle of the Netherlands|invaded the Netherlands]] on 10 May 1940 and took control of the country. Some Amsterdam citizens sheltered Jews, thereby exposing themselves and their families to the high risk of being imprisoned or sent to concentration camps. More than 100,000 Dutch Jews were deported to [[Nazi concentration camps]]. Perhaps the most-famous deportee was the young Jewish girl [[Anne Frank]], who died in the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=&quot;deportation&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Because of the war and other incidents of the 20th century, almost the entire city centre had fallen into disrepair. As society was changing, politicians and other influential figures made plans to redesign large parts of it. There was an increasing demand for office buildings and new roads as the automobile became available to most common people.&lt;ref name=&quot;stadsherstel&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Further plans were to build a new highway above the metro to connect the [[Amsterdam Centraal railway station|Central Station]] and city centre with other parts of the city.

The incorporated large-scale demolitions began in Amsterdam's formerly Jewish neighbourhood. Smaller streets, such as the ''Jodenbreestraat'', were widened and saw almost all of their houses demolished. During the destruction's peak, the [[Nieuwmarkt|''Nieuwmarktrellen'']] (Nieuwmarkt riots) broke out,&lt;ref name=&quot;metrostad&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; where people expressed their fury about the demolition caused by the restructuring of the city. As a result, the demolition was stopped, and the highway was never built, with only the metro being finished. Only a few streets remained widened. The new city hall was built on the almost completely demolished ''Waterlooplein''. Meanwhile, large private organisations, such as ''Stadsherstel Amsterdam'', were founded with the aim of restoring the entire city centre. Although the success of this struggle is visible today, efforts for further restoration are still ongoing.&lt;ref name=&quot;stadsherstel&quot; /&gt; The entire city centre has reattained its former splendor and, as a whole, is now a [[protected area]]. Many of its buildings have become monuments, and in July 2010 the ''Grachtengordel'' ([[Herengracht]], [[Keizersgracht]], and [[Prinsengracht]]) was added to the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]].&lt;ref name=&quot;unesco&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Geography==
[[File:Amsterdam 4.89943E 52.37109N.jpg|thumb|[[Satellite imagery|Satellite image]] of Amsterdam]]
Amsterdam is part of the province of [[North Holland|North-Holland]] and is located in the west of the Netherlands next to the provinces of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and [[Flevoland]]. The river [[Amstel]] terminates in the city centre and connects to a large number of canals that eventually terminate in the [[IJ (bay)|IJ]]. Amsterdam is situated 2 metres [[above mean sea level|above sea level]].&lt;ref name=&quot;elevation&quot; /&gt; The surrounding land is flat as it is formed of large [[polder]]s. To the southwest of the city lies a man-made forest called ''het [[Amsterdamse Bos]]''. Amsterdam is connected to the [[North Sea]] through the long [[North Sea Canal]].

Amsterdam is intensely urbanized, as is the [[Amsterdam Metropolitan Area|Amsterdam metropolitan area]] surrounding the city. Comprising 219.4 square kilometres of land, the [[city limits|city proper]] has 4,457 inhabitants per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 2,275 houses per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;density&quot;&gt;

===Climate===
Amsterdam has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), strongly influenced by its proximity to the North Sea to the west, with prevailing north-western winds and gales. Winter temperatures are cool to mild. Amsterdam, as well as most of the North-Holland province, lies in [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[Hardiness zone]] 9, the northernmost such occurrence in continental Europe. Frosts mainly occur during spells of easterly or northeasterly winds from the inner European continent, from Scandinavia, Russia, or even [[Siberia]]. Even then, because Amsterdam is surrounded on three sides by large bodies of water, as well as enjoying a significant [[Urban heat island|heat-island effect]], nights rarely fall below {{convert|-5|°C|0}}, while it could easily be {{convert|−12|°C|0}} in Hilversum, 25 kilometres southeast. Summers are moderately warm but rarely hot. The average daily high in August is {{convert|21.8|°C|1}}, and {{convert|30|°C}} or higher is only measured on average on 3 days, placing Amsterdam in AHS Heat Zone 2. Days with measurable [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] are common, on average 186 days per year. Amsterdam's average annual precipitation is {{convert|833|mm|in|1}}. Most of this precipitation is in the form of protracted drizzle or light rain, making cloudy and damp days common during the cooler months of October through March. Only the occasional [[European windstorm]] brings significant rain in a short period of time, requiring it to be pumped out to higher ground or to the seas around the city.

==Cityscape and architecture==
[[File:AmsterdamLuchtfotoBmz.jpg|thumb|right|A bird's-eye view of Amsterdam's city centre]]
Amsterdam fans out south from the [[Amsterdam Centraal railway station]]. The [[Damrak]] is the [[Main Street|main street]] and leads into the street [[Rokin]]. The oldest area of the town is known as ''[[de Wallen]]'' (the quays). It lies to the east of Damrak and contains the city's famous red light district. To the south of de Wallen is the old Jewish quarter of Waterlooplein. The 17th century [[canals of Amsterdam]], known as the ''Grachtengordel'', embraces the heart of the city where homes have interesting gables. Beyond the Grachtengordel are the former working class areas of [[Jordaan]] and de Pijp. The [[Museumplein]] with the city's major museums, the [[Vondelpark]], a 19th century park named after the Dutch writer [[Joost van den Vondel]], and [http://www.deplantageamsterdam.nl the Plantage neighbourhood], with the [[Artis|zoo]], are also located outside the Grachtengordel.

Several parts of the city and the surrounding urban area are [[polder]]s. This can be recognized by the suffix ''-meer'' which means ''lake'', as in [[Aalsmeer]], [[Bijlmermeer]], [[Haarlemmermeer]], and [[Watergraafsmeer]].

Known as the ''Grachtengordel'', three of the canals were mostly for residential development: the ''[[Herengracht]]'' (Gentlemen's or more accurately Patricians' Canal), ''[[Keizersgracht]]'' (Emperor's Canal), and ''[[Prinsengracht]]'' (Prince's Canal). The fourth and outermost canal is the ''Singelgracht'', which is often not mentioned on maps, because it is a collective name for all canals in the outer ring. The Singelgracht should not be confused with the oldest and most inner canal ''[[Singel (Amsterdam)|Singel]]''. The canals served the purposes of defense and [[water management]]. The defenses took the form of a moat and [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthen dikes]], with gates at transit points, but otherwise no masonry [[superstructure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:1885 NZVoorburgwal (Christiaan le Blansch).jpg|thumb|A [[woodcut]] (1885) of the Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal, a [[canal]] that is now filled in]]
Construction started in 1613 and proceeded from west to east, across the breadth of the layout, like a gigantic [[Windscreen wiper|windshield wiper]] as the historian [[Geert Mak]] calls it – and ''not'' from the centre outwards, as a popular myth has it. The canal construction in the southern sector was completed by 1656. Subsequently, the construction of residential buildings proceeded slowly. The eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the Amstel river and the IJ bay, has never been implemented. In the following centuries, the land was used for parks, senior citizens' homes, theaters, other public facilities, and waterways without much planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mak|first=G.|title=Een kleine geschiedenis van Amsterdam|publisher=Uitgeverij Atlas|year=1995|location=Amsterdam/Antwerp|isbn=90-450-1232-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
{{Main|Expansion of Amsterdam}}

After the development of Amsterdam's canals in the 17th century, the city did not grow beyond its borders for two centuries. During the 19th century, [[Samuel Sarphati]] devised a plan based on the grandeur of Paris and London at that time. The plan envisaged the construction of new houses, public buildings and streets just outside the ''grachtengordel''. The main aim of the plan, however, was to improve [[public health]]. Although the plan did not expand the city, it did produce some of the largest [[Building|public buildings]] to date, like the ''Paleis voor Volksvlijt''.&lt;ref name=&quot;joodsmuseum&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Following Sarphati, ''Van Niftrik'' and ''Kalff'' designed an entire ring of 19th century neighbourhoods surrounding the city’s centre, with the city preserving the ownership of all land outside the 17th century limit, thus firmly controlling development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/maps/plan_van_niftrik/index.en.html |title=Van Niftrik's plan at the Amsterdam City Archives |publisher=Stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl |date= |accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these neighbourhoods became home to the working class.&lt;ref name=&quot;oudzuid&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In response to overcrowding, two plans were designed at the beginning of the 20th century which were very different from anything Amsterdam had ever seen before: ''Plan Zuid'', designed by the architect [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|Berlage]], and ''West''. These plans involved the development of new neighbourhoods consisting of ''housing blocks'' for all social classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;archiefberlage&quot;&gt;{{cite web

After the Second World War, large new neighbourhoods were built in the western, southeastern, and northern parts of the city. These new neighbourhoods were built to relieve the city's shortage of living space and give people affordable houses with modern conveniences. The neighbourhoods consisted mainly of large housing blocks situated among green spaces, connected to wide roads, making the neighbourhoods easily accessible by [[Automobile|motor car]]. The western suburbs which were built in that period are collectively called the ''Westelijke Tuinsteden''.

Amsterdam has a rich [[History of architecture|architectural history]]. The oldest building in Amsterdam is the [[Oude Kerk]] (Old Church), at the heart of the Wallen, consecrated in 1306.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oude Kerk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oudekerk.nl/|title=Oude Kerk official website|accessdate=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest wooden building is ''[[Begijnhof, Amsterdam|het Houten Huys]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;houtenhuys&quot;&gt;{{cite web

It was constructed around 1425 and is one of only two existing wooden buildings. It is also one of the few examples of [[Gothic architecture]] in Amsterdam.
In the 16th century, wooden buildings were razed and replaced with brick ones. During this period, many buildings were constructed in the [[architectural style]] of the [[Renaissance]]. Buildings of this period are very recognizable with their stepped gable façades, which is the common Dutch Renaissance style. Amsterdam quickly developed its own [[Renaissance architecture]]. These buildings were built according to the principles of the architect [[Hendrick de Keyser]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dekeyser&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most striking buildings designed by Hendrick de Keyer is the [[Westerkerk]]. In the 17th century [[baroque architecture]] became very popular, as it was elsewhere in Europe. This roughly coincided with Amsterdam’s [[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age]]. The leading architects of this style in Amsterdam were [[Jacob van Campen]], [[Philips Vingboons|Philip Vingboons]] and [[Daniël Stalpaert|Daniel Stalpaert]].&lt;ref name=&quot;holclass&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Philip Vingboons designed splendid merchants' houses throughout the city. A famous building in [[baroque|baroque style]] in Amsterdam is the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Royal Palace]] on [[Dam Square]].  Throughout the 18th century, Amsterdam was heavily influenced by [[Culture of France|French culture]]. This is reflected in the architecture of that period. Around 1815, architects broke with the baroque style and started building in different neo-styles.&lt;ref name=&quot;neostijl&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Gothic style buildings date from that era and are therefore said to be built in a [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic]] style. At the end of the 19th century, the [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] or [[Art Nouveau]] style became popular and many new buildings were constructed in this architectural style. Since Amsterdam expanded rapidly during this period, new buildings adjacent to the city centre were also built in this style. The houses in the vicinity of the [[Museumplein|Museum Square]] in Amsterdam Oud-Zuid are an example of Jugendstil. The last style that was popular in Amsterdam before the [[Modern history|modern era]] was [[Art Deco]]. Amsterdam had its own version of the style, which was called the [[Amsterdam School|Amsterdamse School]]. Whole districts were built this style, such as the ''Rivierenbuurt''.&lt;ref name=&quot;aschool&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable feature of the façades of buildings designed in Amsterdamse School is that they are highly decorated and ornate, with oddly shaped windows and doors.

The old city centre is the focal point of all the architectural styles before the end of the 19th century.
Jugendstil and Art Deco are mostly found outside the city’s centre in the neighbourhoods built in the early
20th century, although there are also some striking examples of these styles in the city centre.
Most historic buildings in the city centre and nearby are houses, such as the famous merchants' houses lining the canals.

==Government==
The administration of the municipality of Amsterdam is divided into 15 boroughs or ''[[stadsdeel|stadsdelen]]''; the central one, Centrum, being circled by Westerpark, Bos en Lommer, De Baarsjes, [[Amsterdam Oud-West|Oud-West]], [[Amsterdam Oud-Zuid|Oud-Zuid]], [[Oost-Watergraafsmeer|Oost/Watergraafsmeer]], [[Zeeburg]] and [[Amsterdam-Noord]], with the six outer boroughs ([[Westpoort]], [[Geuzenveld-Slotermeer]], [[Osdorp]], [[Slotervaart]], [[Zuideramstel]], and [[Amsterdam Zuidoost|Zuidoost]]) creating a further encirclement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noord.amsterdam.nl/smartsite.dws?id=16213  |title=Stadsdeel Amsterdam-Noord: Who governs Amsterdam-Noord? |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=18 November 2007 |accessdate=10 October 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071118012332/http://www.noord.amsterdam.nl/smartsite.dws?id=16213 |archivedate = 18 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 May 2010, the number of boroughs was reduced to eight (Centrum, Noord, Oost, Zuid, West, Nieuw-West, Zuidoost, and Westpoort).

===Definitions===
[[File:Amsterdamse stadsdelen 2010.png|thumb|left|300px|The 8 boroughs of Amsterdam]]
&lt;!-- Needs area info! --&gt;
&quot;Amsterdam&quot; is usually understood to refer to the municipality of Amsterdam. Colloquially, some areas within the municipality, such as the village of [[Durgerdam]], may not be considered part of Amsterdam. [[Statistics Netherlands]] uses three other definitions of Amsterdam: metropolitan agglomeration Amsterdam (''Grootstedelijke Agglomeratie Amsterdam'', not to be confused with ''Grootstedelijk Gebied Amsterdam'', a synonym of ''Groot Amsterdam''), Greater Amsterdam (''Groot Amsterdam'', a [[COROP]] region) and the urban region Amsterdam (''Stadsgewest Amsterdam'').&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS&quot; /&gt; These definitions are not synonymous with the terms urban area and [[metropolitan area]], which are commonly used in [[List of countries where English is an official language|English speaking countries]] for the purpose of defining large conurbations. The Amsterdam Department for Research and Statistics uses a fourth conurbation, namely the [[City region]] Amsterdam. This region is similar to Greater Amsterdam but includes the municipalities [[Zaanstad]] and [[Wormerland]]. It excludes [[Graft-De Rijp]].

The smallest of these areas is the municipality, with a population of 742,981 in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSpopulation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/Table.asp?PA=70233ned&amp;D1=0-2,18-20&amp;D2=39,66,88,126,312&amp;D3=0&amp;D4=(l-11)-l&amp;DM=SLNL&amp;LA=nl
|title=Gemiddelde bevolking per regio naar leeftijd en geslacht|accessdate=4 October 2007|publisher=[[Statistics Netherlands]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metropolitan agglomeration had a population of 1,021,870 in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSpopulation&quot;/&gt; It includes the municipalities of Zaanstad, Wormerland, Oostzaan, Diemen and Amstelveen only, as well as the municipality of Amsterdam. Greater Amsterdam includes 15 municipalities,&lt;ref name=&quot;COROP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/NR/rdonlyres/F40C0A58-7E1E-4BD5-93B3-F050153117B3/0/2006cr.pdf|publisher=[[Statistics Netherlands]]|title=Indeling van Nederland in 40 COROP-gebieden|accessdate=4 October 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a population of 1,211,503 in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSpopulation&quot;/&gt; Though much larger in area, the population of this area is only slightly larger, because the definition excludes the relatively populous municipality of [[Zaanstad]]. The largest area by population, the [[Amsterdam Metropolitan Area]] (Dutch: Metropoolregio Amsterdam), has a population of 2,22&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSpopulation&quot;/&gt; It includes for instance Zaanstad, Wormerveer, Muiden, Abcoude, Haarlem, Almere and Lelystad but excludes Graft [[De Rijp]]. Amsterdam is part of the conglomerate metropolitan area [[Randstad]], with a total population of 6,659,300 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;randstad&quot;/&gt;

===City government===
{{Main|Government of Amsterdam}}
As with all Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is governed by a [[List of mayors of Amsterdam|mayor]], [[College van burgemeester en wethouders|aldermen]], and the [[City council|municipal council]]. However, unlike most other Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is subdivided into eight &quot;[[stadsdeel|stadsdelen]]&quot; (boroughs), a system that was implemented in the 1980s to improve local governance. The stadsdelen are responsible for many activities that had previously been run by the central city. The city had initially been divided into 15 stadsdelen. 14 of those had their own council, chosen by a popular election. The 15th, [[Westpoort]], covers the harbour of Amsterdam, had very few residents, and was governed by the central municipal council. Local decisions are made at borough level, and only affairs pertaining to the whole city, such as major infrastructure projects, are handled by the central city council.

===National government===
Amsterdam is the [[capital of the Netherlands]] in a technical legal sense. The present version of the [[Constitution of the Netherlands|Dutch constitution]] mentions &quot;Amsterdam&quot; and &quot;capital&quot; only in one place, chapter 2, article 32: The king's confirmation by oath and his coronation take place in &quot;the capital Amsterdam&quot; (&quot;''de hoofdstad Amsterdam''&quot;). Previous versions of the constitution spoke of &quot;the city of Amsterdam&quot; (&quot;''de stad Amsterdam''&quot;), without mention of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nl.wikisource.org/wiki/Nederlandse_grondwet |title=Previous versions of the constitution |language={{nl icon}} |publisher=Nl.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In any case, the seat of the [[Politics of the Netherlands|government]], [[States-General of the Netherlands|parliament]] and [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands|supreme court]] of the Netherlands is (and always has been, with the exception of a brief period between 1808 and 1810) located at [[The Hague]].  Foreign embassies are also in The Hague. The capital of North Holland is [[Haarlem]].

===Symbols===
{{Main|Coat of arms of Amsterdam|Flag of Amsterdam}}
[[File:Wapen van Amsterdam bewerkt.PNG|thumb|The [[coat of arms]] of Amsterdam]]
The coat of arms of Amsterdam is composed of several historical elements. First and centre are three [[Saltire|St Andrew's crosses]], aligned in a vertical band on the city's shield (although Amsterdam's [[patron saint]] was [[Saint Nicholas]]). These St Andrew's crosses can also be found on the cityshields of neighbours [[Amstelveen]] and [[Ouder-Amstel]]. This part of the coat of arms is the basis of the [[flag of Amsterdam]], flown by the city government, but also as [[civil ensign]] for ships registered in Amsterdam. Second is the [[Imperial Crown of Austria]]. In 1489, out of gratitude for services and loans, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] awarded Amsterdam the right to adorn its coat of arms with the [[King of the Romans|king's]] crown. Then, in 1508, this was replaced with Maximilian's [[imperial crown]] when he was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. In the early years of the 17th century, Maximilian's crown in Amsterdam's coat of arms was again replaced, this time with the crown of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolph II]], a crown that became the Imperial [[Austrian Crown Jewels|Crown of Austria]]. The lions date from the late 16th century, when city and province became part of the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]]. Last came the city's official motto: ''Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig'' (&quot;Heroic, Determined, Merciful&quot;), bestowed on the city in 1947 by [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], in recognition of the city's bravery during the Second World War.

==Economy==
[[File:ZuidasAmsterdamNederland2011.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The [[Zuidas]] district is the main [[Central business district|business district]] of Amsterdam and is still largely under construction. Many Dutch [[multinational corporation|multinationals]] have their headquarters here, like [[ABN AMRO|ABN Amro]] and [[AkzoNobel|Akzo Nobel]].]]

[[KPMG]] International's global headquarters is located in nearby Amstelveen, where many non-Dutch companies have settled as well due to the fact that surrounding communities allow full land ownership, contrary to Amsterdam's land-lease system.

Though many small offices are still located on the old canals, companies are increasingly relocating outside the city centre. The [[Zuidas]] (English: South Axis) has become the new financial and legal hub.&lt;ref name=&quot;zuidas&quot;&gt;{{cite web

There are three other smaller financial districts in Amsterdam. The first is the area surrounding [[Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station]], where several newspapers like [[De Telegraaf]] have their offices. Also, the municipal public transport company (''Gemeentelijk Vervoersbedrijf'') and the Dutch tax offices (''Belastingdienst'') are located there. The second [[Central business district|Financial District]] is the area surrounding [[Amsterdam Arena]]. The third is the area surrounding [[Amsterdam Amstel railway station]].

Amsterdam is one of the most popular [[tourist destination]]s in Europe, receiving more than 4.63&amp;nbsp;million international visitors annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;ams2009&quot; /&gt; The number of visitors has been growing steadily over the past decade. This can be attributed to an increasing number of European visitors. Two thirds of the hotels are located in the city's centre. Hotels with 4 or 5 stars contribute 42% of the total beds available and 41% of the overnight stays in Amsterdam. The room occupation rate was 78% in 2006, up from 70% in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;TourismReport&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/pdf/2008_toerisme_in_amsterdam.pdf |format=PDF |title=Toerisme in Amsterdam 2006/2007 |accessdate=22 May 2008|month=January | year=2007|author=Fedorova, T and Meijer, R|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of tourists (74%) originate from Europe. The largest group of non-European visitors come from the United States, accounting for 14% of the total.&lt;ref name=&quot;TourismReport&quot;/&gt; Certain years have a theme in Amsterdam to attract extra tourists. For example, the year 2006 was designated &quot;Rembrandt 400&quot;, to celebrate the 400th birthday of [[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]]. Some hotels offer special arrangements or activities during these years. The average number of guests per year staying at the four campsites around the city range from 12,000 to 65,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;TourismReport&quot;/&gt;

====Red light district====
{{Main|De Wallen}}
'''De Wallen''', also known as '''Walletjes''' or '''Rosse Buurt''', is a designated area for [[Prostitution and the law|legalized prostitution]] and is Amsterdam's largest and most well known [[red-light district]]. This neighborhood has become a famous tourist attraction. It consists of a network of roads and alleys containing several hundred small, one-room apartments rented by [[sex worker]]s who offer their services from behind a window or glass door, typically illuminated with red lights.

===Retail===
Shops in Amsterdam range from large [[department store]]s such as [[De Bijenkorf]] founded in 1870 and [[Maison de Bonneterie]] a Parisian style store founded in 1889, to small [[specialty store|specialty shops]]. Amsterdam's [[Upmarket|high-end]] shops are found in the streets ''Pieter Cornelisz Hooftstraat'' and ''Cornelis Schuytstraat'', which are located in the vicinity of the [[Vondelpark]]. One of Amsterdam's busiest high streets is the narrow, medieval ''Kalverstraat'' in the heart of the city. Another shopping area is the ''Negen Straatjes'': nine narrow streets within the ''Grachtengordel'', the concentric canal system of Amsterdam. The Negen Straatjes differ from other shopping districts with the presence of a large diversity of privately owned shops.

The city also features a large number of open-air markets such as the ''[[Albert Cuyp Market|Albert Cuypmarkt]]'', ''Westerstraat-markt'', ''Ten Katemarkt'', and ''[[Dappermarkt]]''. Some of these markets are held on a daily basis, like the Albert Cuypmarkt and the Dappermarkt. Others, like the Westerstraat-markt, are held on a weekly basis.

===Fashion===
Fashion brands like [[G-Star Raw|G-star]], Gsus, BlueBlood, Iris van Herpen, [[10 feet]] and [[Warmenhoven &amp; Venderbos]], and fashion designers like [[Mart Visser]], [[Viktor &amp; Rolf]], Sheila de Vries, [[Marlies Dekkers]] and [[Frans Molenaar]] are based in Amsterdam. [[Modeling agency|Modelling agencies]] [[Elite Model Management|Elite Models]], Touche models and Tony Jones have opened branches in Amsterdam. Supermodels [[Yfke Sturm]], [[Doutzen Kroes]] and [[Kim Noorda]] started their careers in Amsterdam. Amsterdam has its garment centre in the World Fashion Center. Buildings which formerly housed brothels in the red light district have been converted to ateliers for young fashion designers.

==Demographics==
In the 16th and 17th century non-Dutch immigrants to Amsterdam were mostly [[Huguenot]]s, [[Flemish people|Flemings]], [[Sephardi Jews]] and [[Westphalia]]ns. Huguenots came after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau (1685)|Edict of Fontainebleau]] in 1685, while the Flemish Protestants came during the [[Eighty Years' War]]. The Westphalians came to Amsterdam mostly for economic reasons – their influx continued through the 18th and 19th centuries. Before the Second World War, 10% of the city population was [[Jewish community of Amsterdam|Jewish]].

The first mass immigration in the 20th century were by people from Indonesia, who came to Amsterdam after the independence of the [[Dutch East Indies]] in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s [[Foreign worker|guest workers]] from Turkey, Morocco, Italy and Spain emigrated to Amsterdam. After the independence of Suriname in 1975, a large wave of [[Surinamese people|Surinamese]] settled in Amsterdam, mostly in the [[Bijlmermeer|Bijlmer]] area. Other immigrants, including refugees [[Right of asylum|asylum seekers]] and [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]], came from Europe, [[Americas|America]], Asia, and Africa. In the seventies and eighties, many 'old' Amsterdammers moved to 'new' cities like [[Almere]] and [[Purmerend]], prompted by the third [[Land use planning|planological]] bill of the Dutch government. This bill promoted suburbanisation and arranged for new developments in so called &quot;groeikernen&quot;, literally &quot;cores of growth&quot;. Young professionals and artists moved into neighbourhoods de Pijp and the [[Jordaan]] abandoned by these Amsterdammers. The non-Western immigrants settled mostly in the [[Public housing|social housing]] projects in Amsterdam-West and the Bijlmer. Today, people of non-Western origin make up approximately one-third of the population of Amsterdam, and more than 50% of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/bevolking/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2006/2006-1995-wm.htm?RefererType=Favorite |title=Half of young big-city dwellers have non-western background |publisher=Cbs.nl |date= |accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OS 4351&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In 1578 the previously Roman Catholic city of Amsterdam joined the revolt against Spanish rule, late in comparison to other major northern Dutch cities. In line with [[Protestantism|Protestant]] procedure of that time, all churches were converted to Protestant worship. [[Calvinism]] became the dominant religion, and although Catholicism was not forbidden and priests allowed to serve, the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|Catholic hierarchy]] was prohibited. This led to the establishment of ''schuilkerken'', covert churches, behind seemingly ordinary canal side house fronts. One example is the current debate centre [[de Rode Hoed]].
[[File:EsnogaAmsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Portuguese Synagogue (Amsterdam)|Amsterdam Esnoga]]]]
A large influx of foreigners of many religions came to 17th-century Amsterdam, in particular [[Sephardi Jews|Sefardic Jews]] from Spain and Portugal, [[Huguenot]]s from France, and Protestants from the [[Southern Netherlands]]. This led to the establishment of many non-Dutch-speaking religious churches. In 1603, the first notification was made of Jewish religious service. In 1639, the first synagogue was consecrated. The Jews came to call the town [[Jerusalem of the West]], a reference to their sense of belonging there.

As they became established in the city, other [[Christian denomination]]s used converted Catholic chapels to conduct their own services. The oldest English-language church congregation in the world outside the United Kingdom is found at the [[Begijnhof, Amsterdam|Begijnhof]]. Regular services there are still offered in English under the auspices of the Church of Scotland.&lt;ref name=&quot;englishchurch&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Huguenots accounted for nearly 20% of Amsterdam's inhabitants in 1700. Being Calvinists, they soon integrated into the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], though often retaining their own congregations. Some, commonly referred by the moniker 'Walloon', are recognizable today as they offer occasional services in French.

In the second half of the 17th century, Amsterdam experienced an influx of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]], Jews from [[Central Europe|Central and Eastern Europe]], which continued into the 19th century. Jews often fled the [[pogrom]]s in those areas. The first Ashkenazi who arrived in Amsterdam were [[refugee]]s from the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Chmielnicki Uprising]] in Poland and the [[Thirty Years' War|Thirty Years War]]. They not only founded their own synagogues, but had a strong influence on the 'Amsterdam dialect' adding a large [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] local vocabulary.

Despite an absence of an official Jewish [[ghetto]], most Jews preferred to live in the eastern part of the old medieval heart of the city. The main street of this Jewish neighborhood was the ''Jodenbreestraat''. The neighborhood comprised the ''Waterlooplein'' and the [[Nieuwmarkt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jodenbuurt Amsterdam&quot;&gt;{{cite web

This led to riots, and as a result the original plans for large-scale reconstruction were abandoned and the neighborhood was rebuilt with smaller-scale residence buildings on the basis of its original layout.

Catholic Churches in Amsterdam have been constructed since the restoration of the episcopal hierarchy in 1853. One of the principal architects behind the city's Catholic churches, [[Pierre Cuypers|Cuypers]], was also responsible for the Amsterdam Central Station and the [[Rijksmuseum]], which led to a refusal of Protestant King [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] to open 'that monastery'.
In 1924, [[Catholic Church|the Roman Catholic Church]] of the Netherlands hosted the [[Eucharistic Congress|International Eucharistic Congress]] in Amsterdam, and numerous Catholic [[prelate]]s visited the city, where festivities were held in churches and stadiums. Catholic processions on the public streets, however, were still forbidden under law at the time. Only in the 20th century was Amsterdam's relation to Catholicism normalized, but despite its far larger [[population size]], the [[Holy Orders|Catholic clergy]] chose to place its episcopal see of the city in the nearby provincial town of [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Diocese of Haarlem&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In recent times, religious demographics in Amsterdam have been changed by large-scale immigration from former colonies. Immigrants from Suriname have introduced [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Protestantism and [[Lutheranism]], from the Hernhutter variety; [[Hinduism]] has been introduced mainly from Suriname; and several distinct branches of [[Islam]] have been brought from various parts of the world. Islam is now the largest non-Christian religion in Amsterdam. The large community of Ghanaian and Nigerian immigrants have established African churches, often in parking garages in the [[Bijlmermeer|Bijlmer]] area, where many have settled. In addition, a broad array of other religious movements have established congregations, including [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Hinduism]].

Although the saying &quot;Leef en laat leven&quot; or &quot;Live and let live&quot; summarises the Dutch and especially the Amsterdam open and tolerant society, the increased influx of many races, religions, and cultures after the Second World War, has on a number of occasions strained [[social relation]]s.  With 176 different nationalities, Amsterdam is home to one of the widest varieties of nationalities of any city in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Quest, issue of march 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The immigrant share of the population in the city proper now counts about 50%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/tabel/7003/ Amsterdam in cijfers 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Public transport in Amsterdam mainly consists of (night)bus and tram lines operated by [[Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf]]. Regional buses, and some suburban buses, are operated by [[Connexxion]] and [[Arriva]]. Currently, there are 16 different tramlines. There are currently four [[Amsterdam Metro|metro]] lines, with a fifth line, the [[Amsterdam Metro|North/South line]], under construction. Three free ferries carry pedestrians and cyclists across the [[IJ (bay)|IJ]] to [[Amsterdam-Noord]], and two fare-charging ferries run east and west along the harbour. There are also water taxis, a water bus, a [[boat sharing]] operation, electric rental boats (Boaty) and canal cruises, that transport people along Amsterdam's waterways.

The [[A10 motorway (Netherlands)|A10 ringroad]] surrounding the city connects Amsterdam with the Dutch [[List of motorways in the Netherlands|national network of freeways]]. [[Interchange (road)|Interchanges]] on the A10 allow cars to enter the city by transferring to one of the 18 ''city roads'', numbered S101 through to S118. These city roads are regional roads without [[grade separation]], and sometimes without a [[central reservation]]. Most are accessible by cyclists. The S100 ''Centrumring'' is a smaller ringroad circumnavigating the city's centre.

The A3 road to [[Rotterdam]] was cancelled in 1970 in order to conserve the [[Groene Hart]]. Road [[A8 motorway (Netherlands)|A8]], leading north to [[Zaandam]] and the [[A10 motorway (Netherlands)|A10]] [[Beltway|Ringroad]] were opened between 1968 and 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;Autosnelweg 1970&quot;&gt;{{cite web

=== Cycling ===
{{main|Cycling in Amsterdam}}

Amsterdam is one of the most [[bicycle-friendly]] large cities in the world and is a centre of [[bicycle culture]] with good facilities for cyclists such as bike paths and [[Bicycle stand|bike racks]], and several guarded bike storage garages (Fietsenstalling) which can be used for a nominal fee. In 2006, there were about 465,000 bicycles in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Education==
[[File:GrimburgwalAmsterdam.jpg|thumb|[[University of Amsterdam]]]]
Amsterdam has two universities: the [[University of Amsterdam]] (Universiteit van Amsterdam), and the VU University Amsterdam ([[Vrije Universiteit]] or &quot;VU&quot; – often referred to, in English, as &quot;The Free&quot;). Other institutions for higher education include an [[art school]] – [[Gerrit Rietveld Academie]], the Hogeschool van Amsterdam, and the [[Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten]]. Amsterdam's [[International Institute of Social History]] is one of the world's largest documentary and research institutions concerning [[social history]], and especially the [[labor history (discipline)|history of the labour movement]]. Amsterdam's [[Hortus Botanicus (Amsterdam)|Hortus Botanicus]], founded in the early 17th century, is one of the oldest [[botanical garden]]s in the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hortus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dehortus.nl/Index.asp|title=Hortus Botanicus official website|publisher=© 2009 de Hortus|accessdate=10 June 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many old and rare specimens, among them the [[coffee|coffee plant]] that served as the parent for the entire coffee culture in Central and South America.&lt;ref name=&quot;he&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Amsterdam's [[primary education|primary schools]] base their teachings on particular pedagogic theories like the various [[Maria Montessori|Montessori]] schools. The biggest Montessori High School in Amsterdam is the [[Montessori Lyceum Amsterdam]]. Many schools, however, are based on religion. This used to be primarily Roman Catholicism and various Protestant denominations, but with the influx of Muslim immigrants there has been a rise in the number of Islamic schools. Jewish schools can be found in the southern suburbs of Amsterdam.

Amsterdam is noted for having five independent grammar schools (Dutch: gymnasia), the [[Vossius Gymnasium]], [[Barlaeus Gymnasium]], St. [[Ignatius Gymnasium]], [[Het 4e Gymnasium]] and the [[Cygnus Gymnasium]] where a classical curriculum including Latin and [[Ancient Greek|classical Greek]] is taught. Though believed until recently by many to be an anachronistic and elitist concept that would soon die out, the gymnasia have recently experienced a revival, leading to the formation of a fourth and fifth grammar school in which the three aforementioned schools participate. Most secondary schools in Amsterdam offer a variety of different levels of education in the same school. The city also has various colleges ranging from art and design to politics and economics which are mostly also available for students coming from other countries.

==Housing==
The housing market is heavily regulated.  In Amsterdam, 55% of existing housing and 80% of new housing is owned by Housing Associations, which are Government sponsored entities.

[[Squatting|Squat]] properties are common throughout Amsterdam, due to property law strongly favouring tenants. A number of these squats have become well known, such as [[OT301]], Vrankrijk (closed down by city government), and the Binnenpret, and several are now businesses, such as health clubs and licensed restaurants.

==Culture and entertainment==
[[File:RijksmuseumAmsterdamMuseumplein.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]]]]
During the later part of the 16th century Amsterdam's Rederijkerskamer ([[Chamber of rhetoric|Chamber of Rhetoric]]) organized contests between different Chambers in the reading of poetry and drama. In 1638, Amsterdam opened its first theatre. Ballet performances were given in this theatre as early as 1642. In the 18th century, French theatre became popular. While Amsterdam was under the influence of German music in the 19th century there were few national opera productions; the Hollandse Opera of Amsterdam was built in 1888 for the specific purpose of promoting Dutch opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=l_b2vIXHsUkC&amp;pg=PA541&amp;dq=Amsterdam+opera&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Amsterdam%20opera |title=A short history of opera|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2003|last=Grout|first=Donald Jay|page=541|accessdate=11 January 2010|coauthors=Hermine Weigel Williams |isbn=9780231119580 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, [[popular culture]] was centred around the Nes area in Amsterdam (mainly [[vaudeville]] and [[music hall|music-hall]]).{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The [[metronome]], one of the most important advances in [[Classical music|European classical music]], was invented here in 1812 by [[Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel]].

===Museums===
The most important museums of Amsterdam are located on ''het [[Museumplein]]'' (Museum Square), located at the southern side of the Rijksmuseum. It was created in the last quarter of the 19th century on the grounds of the former [[Expo (exhibition)|World Exposition]]. The northern part of the square is bordered by the very large Rijksmuseum. In front of the Rijksmuseum on the square itself is a long, rectangular, pond. This is transformed into an ice rink in winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;ijsbaan&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The western part of the square is bordered by the Van Gogh Museum, Stedelijk Museum, House of Bols Cocktail &amp; Genever Experience and Coster Diamonds. The southern border of the Museum Square is the Van Baerlestraat, which is a major thoroughfare in this part of Amsterdam. The Concertgebouw is situated across this street from the square. To the east of the square are situated a number of large houses, one of which contains the American consulate. A [[Multi-storey car park|parking garage]] can be found underneath the square, as well as a supermarket. ''Het Museumplein'' is covered almost entirely with a lawn, except for the northern part of the square which is covered with gravel. The current appearance of the square was realized in 1999, when the square was remodeled. The square itself is the most prominent site in Amsterdam for festivals and outdoor concerts, especially in the summer. Plans were made in 2008 to remodel the square again, because many inhabitants of Amsterdam are not happy with its current appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;museumpleinfacelift&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Rembrandt's masterpiece the [[Night Watch (painting)|Nightwatch]] is one of top pieces of art of the museum. It also houses paintings from artists like [[Bartholomeus van der Helst|Van der Helst]], [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Ferdinand Bol]], Albert Cuijp, Van Ruysdael and [[Paulus Potter]]. Aside from paintings, the collection consists of a large variety of [[Decorative arts|decorative art]]. This ranges from [[Delftware]] to giant [[dollhouse]]s from the 17th century. The architect of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|gothic revival]] building was P.J.H. Cuypers. At present, the museum is being expanded, renovated, and a new main entrance for the museum created.

[[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] lived in Amsterdam for a short while and there is a [http://www3.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp museum] dedicated to his work. The museum is housed in one of the few modern buildings in this area of Amsterdam. The building was designed by [[Gerrit Rietveld]]. This building is where the permanent collection is displayed. A new building was added to the museum in 1999. This building, known as the performance wing, was designed by Japanese architect [[Kisho Kurokawa]]. Its purpose is to house temporary exhibitions of the museum. Some of Van Gogh's most famous paintings, like the [[The Potato Eaters|Aardappeleters]] (''The Potato Eaters'') and ''Zonnenbloemen'', are present in the collection. The Van Gogh museum is the most visited museum in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name=&quot;vangogh1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Next to the Van Gogh museum stands the [[Stedelijk Museum]]. This is Amsterdam's largest museum concerning [[modern art]]. The museum opened its doors at around the same time the Museum Square was created. The permanent collection consists of works of art from artists like [[Piet Mondrian|Piet Mondriaan]], [[Karel Appel]], and [[Kazimir Malevich]]. This museum is also currently being renovated and expanded. The main entrance will be relocated from the Paulus Potterstraat to the Museum Square itself. It will be open again to public in the end of 2011.

Amsterdam contains many other museums throughout the city. They range from small museums such as the ''Verzetsmuseum'', the [[Anne Frank House]], and the [[Rembrandt House Museum|Rembrandthuis]], to the very large, like the [[Tropenmuseum]], [[Amsterdam Museum]], [[Hermitage Amsterdam]] and [[Joods Historisch Museum]].

===Performing arts===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}

====Pop, rock, and jazz====
The [[Heineken Music Hall]] is a concert hall located near the [[Amsterdam Arena|Amsterdam ArenA]]. Its main purpose is to serve as a podium for pop concerts for big audiences. Many famous international artists have performed there. Two other notable venues, [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] and the [[Melkweg]] are located near the [[Leidseplein]]. Both focus on broad programming, ranging from [[indie rock]] to [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], and other popular genres. Other more [[subculture|subculturally]] focused [[music venue]]s are [[OCCII]], [[OT301]], De Nieuwe Anita, Winston Kingdom and [[Zaal 100]].  [[Jazz]] has a strong following in Amsterdam, with the [[Bimhuis]] being the premier venue.

====Electronic Dance Music====

The [[Heineken Music Hall]] is also host to many [[Electronic Dance Music]] festivals, alongside many other venues. Amsterdam is home to [[Scantraxx]], which is one of the largest record labels that produces [[Hardstyle]] music, which is very popular in the Netherlands. [[Armin van Buuren]] and [[Tiesto]], some of the worlds leading [[Trance music|Trance]] DJ's hail from The Netherlands and perform frequently in Amsterdam. Each year in October, the city hosts the Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE) which is one of the leading electronic music conferences and one of the biggest club festivals for electronic music in the world. Another popular dance festival is 5daysoff, which takes place in the venues [[Paradiso]] and [[Melkweg]]. In summer time there are several big outdoor dance parties in or nearby Amsterdam, such as Awakenings, [[Dance Valley]], [[Mystery Land]], Loveland, A Day at the Park, Welcome to the Future, and Valtifest.

====Classical music====
[[File:Concert18.jpg|thumb|The ''Grote Zaal'' of the [[Concertgebouw]]]]
Amsterdam has a world-class symphony orchestra, the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]]. Their home is the [[Concertgebouw]], which is across the Van Baerlestraat from the Museum Square. It is considered by critics to be a [[List of concert halls|concert hall]] with some of the best [[acoustics]] in the world. The building contains three [[hall]]s, Grote Zaal, Kleine Zaal, and Spiegelzaal. Eight hundred concerts per year are performed there for approximately 850,000 patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tony Long |url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/04/dayintech_0411 |title=11 April 1888: Concertgebouw, Home of Nearly Perfect Acoustics, Opens |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera house of Amsterdam is situated adjacent to the city hall. Therefore, the two buildings combined are often called the [[Stopera]]. This word is derived from the Dutch words ''stadhuis'' (city hall) and opera. This huge modern complex, opened in 1986, lies in the former Jewish neighbourhood at ''Waterlooplein'' next to the river [[Amstel]]. The ''Stopera'' is the homebase of [[De Nederlandse Opera]], [[Dutch National Ballet|Het Nationale Ballet]] and the [[Holland Symfonia]].

[[Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ]] is a [[List of concert halls|concert hall]], which is situated in the [[IJ (bay)|IJ]] near the central station. Its concerts perform mostly [[20th-century classical music|modern classical music]]. Located adjacent to it, is the ''[[Bimhuis]]'', a concert hall for improvised and [[Jazz]] music.

====Theatre====
The main theatre building of Amsterdam is the [[Stadsschouwburg (Amsterdam)|Stadsschouwburg Amsterdam]] at the [[Leidseplein]]. It is the home base of the ''Toneelgroep Amsterdam''. The current building dates from 1894. Most plays are performed in the Grote Zaal (Great Hall). The normal programme of events encompasses all sorts of theatrical forms. The Stadsschouwburg is currently being renovated and expanded. The third theater space, to be operated jointly with next door [[Melkweg]], will open in late 2009 or early 2010.
Other theatres are: Royal Theatre Carré, Bellevue theatres, the Stopera ''de kleine komedie'' and the re-opened DeLaMar.

====Comedy and cabaret====
The Netherlands has a tradition of cabaret or ''kleinkunst'', which combines music, storytelling, commentary, theatre and comedy. Cabaret dates back to the 1930s and artists like [[Wim Kan]], [[Wim Sonneveld]] and [[Toon Hermans]] were pioneers of this form of art in the Netherlands. In Amsterdam is the Kleinkunstacademie (English: Cabaret Academy).

Contemporary popular artists are [[Youp van 't Hek]], [[Freek de Jonge]], [[Herman Finkers]], [[Hans Teeuwen]], [[Theo Maassen]], [[Herman van Veen]], [[Najib Amhali]], [[Raoul Heertje]], [[Jörgen Raymann]], [[De Vliegende Panters]] and [[Comedytrain]]. The English spoken comedy scene was established with the founding of [[Boom Chicago]] in 1993. They have their own theatre at Leidseplein.

===Nightlife===
Amsterdam is famous for its vibrant and diverse nightlife. The two main nightlife areas are the [[Leidseplein]] and the [[Rembrandtplein]].

Amsterdam has many [[Coffeehouse|cafes]]. They range from large and modern to small and cozy. The typical ''Bruine Kroeg'' (brown cafe) breathe a more old fashioned atmosphere with dimmed lights, candles, and somewhat older clientele. Most cafes have terraces in summertime. A common sight on the Leidseplein during summer is a square full of terraces packed with people drinking beer or wine.

Many restaurants can be found in Amsterdam as well. Since Amsterdam is a multicultural city, a lot of different ethnic restaurants can be found. Restaurants range from being rather luxurious and expensive to being ordinary and affordable.

Amsterdam also possesses many [[discothèque]]s. Most of these 'clubs' are situated near the Leidseplein and Rembrandtplein. The [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]], [[Melkweg]] and Sugar Factory are cultural centres, which turn into discothèques on some nights. Examples of discothèques near the Rembrandtplein are the Escape and Club Home. Also noteworthy are Panama, Hotel Arena (East), The Sand and The Powerzone.

The Reguliersdwarsstraat is the main street for the [[LGBT]] community and nightlife.

===Movie theaters===
Hollywood films are primarily featured at cinemas owned by [[Pathé|Pathe]]. [[Tuschinski]] is a heritage [[Art Deco|art deco]] building with a beautiful lobby and six screens. Theater One is an architectural treasure with comfortable seats, two balconies and recently restored ceilings. Pathe De Munt is modern and is located at [[Muntplein (Amsterdam)|the Muntplein]]. Pathe Arena is located a metro ride from the centre and includes an [[IMAX]] auditorium. Pathe City is scheduled to reopen in 2010. [[Art film]]s can be found at Tuschinski, and the independent The Movies, Cinecenter, Kriterion, Ketelhuis, Uitkijk, and the [[Netherlands Filmmuseum|Filmmuseum]].

===Festivals===
[[File:Koninginnedag2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Koninginnedag]] 2009 in Amsterdam]]

On Koninginnedag—held each year on  30 April—hundreds of thousands of people travel to Amsterdam to celebrate with the city's residents. The entire city becomes overcrowded with people buying products from the ''freemarket,'' or visiting one of the many music concerts.

The yearly Holland Festival attracts international artists and visitors from all over Europe. [[Amsterdam Gay Pride]] is a yearly local [[LGBT]] parade of boats in Amsterdam's canals, held on the first Saturday in August. The Gay Pride event is a frequent source of both criticism and praise.&lt;ref name=&quot;gaypride&quot;&gt;{{cite web

'''Audi AG''' ([[Xetra (trading system)|Xetra]]: [http://deutsche-boerse.com/dbag/dispatch/en/isg/gdb_navigation/home?module=InOverview_Equi&amp;wp=DE0006757008&amp;foldertype=_Equi&amp;wplist=DE0006757008&amp;active=overview&amp;wpbpl= NSU]) is a German manufacturer of a range of automobiles, from [[supermini]] to [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover SUVs]] in various [[Car body style|body styles]] and price ranges that are marketed under the '''Audi''' brand ({{IPA-de|ˈaʊdi}}), positioned as the premium brand within the [[Volkswagen Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneighturbo.com/audi/audi-selected-as-the-most-creative-premium-brand-in-horizont-ranking/ |title=Audi selected as the most creative premium brand in HORIZONT ranking, retrieved 29 January 2011 |publisher=Oneighturbo.com |date=2009-12-10 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is headquartered in [[Ingolstadt]], Germany, and has been a wholly owned (99.55%&lt;ref name=&quot;vw-holdings-2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Shareholdings in accordance with sections 285 and 313 of the HGB of Volkswagen AG and the Volkswagen Group as of December 31, 2009|url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/vwag/vwcorp/info_center/en/publications/2010/03/Anteilsbesitz.-bin.acq/qual-BinaryStorageItem.Single.File/Anteilsbesitz_2009_e.pdf|work=www.volkswagenag.com|publisher=Volkswagen AG |accessdate=11 December 2010|date=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) subsidiary of [[Volkswagen AG]] since 1966, following a phased purchase of its predecessor, [[Auto Union]], from its former owner, [[Daimler-Benz]]. Volkswagen relaunched the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the [[Audi F103]] series.

The company name is based on the surname of the founder [[August Horch]], his surname meaning ''listen'' in German—which, when translated into [[Latin]], becomes ''Audi''.

==Within Volkswagen Group==
The largest shareholder of Audi AG is Volkswagen AG, which holds over 99 percent of the share capital. Volkswagen AG includes the consolidated accounts of Audi AG in its own financial statements.  In recent years, the possibility of Audi being spun off or otherwise divested by Volkswagen has been mooted &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.motorauthority.com/blog/1028368_porsche-to-buy-audi-lamborghini-bugatti-and-bentley|title = motorauthority.com|accessdate = 15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2002 up to 2007, Audi headed the ''Audi Brand Group'', the Volkswagen Group's automotive sub-division, consisted of Audi together with [[SEAT]] and [[Lamborghini]], that was focused on more sporty values, with the marques' product vehicles and performance being under the higher responsibility of the Audi brand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20011203/ANE/112030837 Volkswagen's branding plan takes shape ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/vwag/gb2006/content/en/Divisions/Business_Lines_and_Markets.html |title=Volkswagen Group - Business lines and markets |publisher=Volkswagenag.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/vwag/gb2007/content/en/divisions/business_lines_and_markets.html |title=Volkswagen Group - Brands and business fields |publisher=Volkswagenag.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Birth of the company and its name===
[[File:Audi Typ E (1923).jpg|thumb|Audi Type E]]
On November 14, 1899, August Horch (1868–1951) established the company A. Horch &amp; Cie. in the Ehrenfeld district of Cologne, but because of dispute between him and the supervisory board, he had to leave the company.  A few years later, he established a second company, Horch Automobil-Werke GmbH.  The company traces its origins back to 1909 and [[August Horch]].  The first Audi automobile, the Audi Type A 10/{{Convert|22|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} Sport-Phaeton, was produced in 1910 in [[Zwickau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicle1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Brand family tree|url=http://www.audiusa.com/us/brand/en/about/main/history/brand_family_tree/brand_family_tree.html|publisher=audiusa com|accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Horch was forced out of the company he had founded.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicle2&quot;&gt;Audi website http://www.audiusa.com/us/brand/en/about/main/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;  He then started a new company in Zwickau and continued using the Horch brand.  His former partners sued him for [[trademark]] infringement, and the German Supreme Court (Reichsgericht in Berlin)&lt;ref&gt;Audi AG motion picture 1994: &quot;The Silver Arrows from Zwickau&quot;, running time approx. 49 mins.&lt;/ref&gt; finally determined that the Horch brand belonged to his former company.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicle2&quot;/&gt;

August Horch was barred from using his own [[family name]] in his new car business, so he called a meeting with his best business friends, Paul and Franz Fikentscher from Zwickau.  At the apartment of Franz Fikentscher, they discussed how to come up with a new name for the company.  During this meeting, Franz's son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room.  Several times he looked like he was on the verge of saying something but would just swallow his words and continue working, until he finally blurted out, &quot;Father&amp;nbsp;–  [[Audi alteram partem|''audiatur et altera pars'']]... wouldn't it be a good idea to call it ''audi'' instead of ''horch''?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;August Horch: &quot;Ich baute Autos - Vom Schmiedelehrling zum Autoindustriellen&quot;, Schützen-Verlag Berlin 1937&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Horch!&quot; in German means &quot;Hark!&quot; or &quot;hear&quot;, which is &quot;Audi&quot; in Latin. The idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The first Audi car, the Type B, 10/28PS was delivered early in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=Nick|title=The World guide to automobile manufacturers|year=1987|publisher=Facts on File Publications|isbn=9780816018444|first2=Brian|last2=Laban|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audi started with a 2612&amp;nbsp;[[Cubic centimetre|cc]] [[inline-four engine]] model{{Clarify|when and what model?|date=February 2009}} followed by a 3564&amp;nbsp;cc model, as well as 4680&amp;nbsp;cc and 5720&amp;nbsp;cc models.  These cars were successful even in sporting events. The first [[Straight 6|six cylinder]] model,{{Clarify|what model?|date=February 2009}} 4655&amp;nbsp;cc appeared in 1924.

August Horch left the Audi company in 1920 for a high position at the ministry of transport, but he was still involved with Audi as a member of the board of trustees. In September 1921, Audi became the first German car manufacturer to present a production car, the Audi Type K, with left-handed drive.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicle3&quot;&gt;Audi website http://www.audi.com/audi/com/en2/about_audi_ag/history/chronicle/chronicle_1915_1929.html&lt;/ref&gt; Left-hand drive spread and established dominance during the 1920s because it provided a better view of oncoming traffic, making overtaking safer.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicle3&quot;/&gt;

===Auto Union era===
{{Main|Auto Union}}

In August 1928 [[Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen|Jørgen Rasmussen]], the owner of [[Dampf-Kraft-Wagen]] (DKW), acquired the majority of shares in Audiwerke AG.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicle4&quot;&gt;Audi website http://www.audi.com/audi/com/en2/about_audi_ag/history/chronicle/chronicle_1930_1944.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Rasmussen bought the remains of the U.S. [[automobile manufacturer]] [[Rickenbacker (car)|Rickenbacker]], including the manufacturing equipment for eight cylinder engines. These engines were used in ''Audi Zwickau'' and ''Audi Dresden'' models that were launched in 1929. At the same time, six-cylinder and four-cylinder (licensed from [[Peugeot]]) models were manufactured. Audi cars of that era were luxurious cars equipped with special bodywork.

In 1932, Audi merged with [[Horch]], DKW, and [[Wanderer (car)|Wanderer]], to form [[Auto Union]]. It was during this period that the company offered the [[Audi Front]] that became the first European car to combine a six-cylinder engine with front-wheel drive. It used a powertrain shared with the Wanderer, but turned 180-degrees, so that the drive shaft faced the front.

Before World War II, Auto Union used the four interlinked rings that make up the Audi badge today, representing these four brands. This badge was used, however, only on Auto Union racing cars in that period while the member companies used their own names and emblems. The technological development became more and more concentrated and some Audi models were propelled by Horch or Wanderer built engines.

Reflecting the economic pressures of the time, Auto Union concentrated increasingly on smaller cars through the 1930s, so that by 1938 the company's DKW brand accounted for 17.9% of the German car market while Audi held only 0.1%.

===Post–World War II===
Like most German manufacturing, at the onset of World War II the Auto Union plants were retooled for military production, and were a target for allied bombing during the war, leaving them damaged.

Overrun by the [[Soviet Army]] in 1945, on the orders of the Soviet Union military administration the factories were dismantled as part of [[war reparations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicle5&quot;&gt;Audi website http://www.audi.com/audi/com/en2/about_audi_ag/history/chronicle/chronicle_1945_1959.html&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the company's entire assets were expropriated without compensation.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicle5&quot;/&gt; On 17 August 1948, Auto Union AG of Chemnitz was deleted from the commercial register.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicle4&quot;/&gt; These actions had the effect of liquidating Germany's Auto Union AG. The remains of the Audi plant of Zwickau became the [[Volkseigener Betrieb|VEB]] (for &quot;People Owned Enterprise&quot;) Automobilwerk Zwickau or AWZ (in English: Automobile Works Zwickau).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobilwerk_Zwickau|title = VEB Automobilwerk Zwickau | language = German |accessdate = 21 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former Audi factory in Zwickau restarted assembly of the pre-war-models in 1949. These DKW models were renamed to [[IFA F8]] and [[IFA F9]] and were similar to the West German versions. West and East German models were equipped with the traditional and renowned DKW two-stroke engines.

===New Auto Union===
A new West German headquartered Auto Union was launched in Ingolstadt, Bavaria with loans from the Bavarian state government and [[Marshall Plan]] aid.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicle6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audi.com/audi/com/en2/about_audi_ag/history/chronicle/chronicle_1945_1959.html |title=Audi Worldwide &gt; Home |publisher=Audi.com |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reformed company was launched 3 September 1949 and continued DKW's tradition of producing front-wheel drive vehicles with two-stroke engines.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicle5&quot;/&gt; This included production of a small but sturdy 125 cc [[motorcycle]] and a DKW delivery van, the DKW F 89 L at Ingolstadt.  The Ingolstadt site was large, consisting of an extensive complex of formerly military buildings which was suitable for administration as well as vehicle warehousing and distribution, but at this stage there was at Ingolstadt no dedicated plant suitable for mass production of automobiles:  for manufacturing the company's [[DKW F89|first post-war mass-market passenger car]] plant capacity  in [[Düsseldorf]] was rented from [[Rheinmetall|Rheinmetall-Borsig]].  It was only ten years later, after the company had attracted an investor that funds became available for construction of major car plant at the Ingolstadt head office site.

In 1958 [[Daimler-Benz]] took an 87% holding in the Auto Union company, and this was increased to a 100% holding in 1959. However, small two-stroke cars were not the focus of [[Daimler-Benz|the company's]] interests, and while the early 1960s saw major investment in new Mercedes models and in a state of the art factory for Auto Union's, the company's aging model range at this time did not benefit from the economic boom of the early 1960s to the same extent as competitor manufacturers such as [[Volkswagen]] and [[Opel]]. The decision to dispose of the Auto Union business was based on its lack of profitability.&lt;ref name=Motor197107&gt;{{cite journal| first=Charles | last=Bulmer (Ed)| title = The Audi-NSU Affair| journal = Motor| volume =| page =21|date = 24 July 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ironically, by the time they sold the business it also included a large new factory and near production-ready modern four-stroke engine, which would enable the Auto Union business, under a new owner and with the benefit of a rediscovered name, Audi.

In 1964 [[Volkswagen]] acquired a 50% holding in the business, which included the new factory in Ingolstadt and the trademark rights of the Auto Union. Eighteen months later, Volkswagen bought complete control of Ingolstadt, and by 1966 were using the spare capacity of the Ingolstadt plant to assemble an additional 60,000 [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen Beetles]] per year.&lt;ref name=Motor19710724&gt;{{cite journal| first=Philip |last=Turner| title = Turner's Travel [to Wolfsburg]| journal = Motor| volume =| pages = 28–30|date = 24 July 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two-stroke engines became less popular during the 1960s as customers were more attracted to the smoother four-stroke engines. In September 1965, the [[DKW F102]] was fitted with a four-stroke engine and a [[Facelift (automotive)|facelift]] for the car's front and rear. Volkswagen dumped the DKW brand because of its associations with two-stroke technology, and having classified the model internally as the [[Audi F103|F103]], sold it simply as the &quot;Audi.&quot; Later developments of the model were named for their horsepower ratings and sold as the Audi 60, 75, 80, and Super 90, selling until 1972.
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038791-0035, Wolfsburg, VW Autowerk.jpg|thumb|[[Audi 80]] [[assembly line]] in [[Wolfsburg]] as of 1973]]
In 1969, Auto Union merged with [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]], based in [[Neckarsulm]], near [[Stuttgart]]. In the 1950s, NSU had been the world's largest manufacturer of [[motorcycle]]s, but had moved on to produce small cars like the [[NSU Prinz]], the TT and TTS versions of which are still popular as vintage race cars. NSU then focused on new rotary engines based on the ideas of [[Felix Wankel]]. In 1967, the new [[NSU Ro 80]] was a car well ahead of its time in technical details such as aerodynamics, light weight, and safety. However, teething problems with the rotary engines put an end to the independence of NSU. The Neckarsulm plant is now used to produce the larger Audi models [[Audi A6|A6]] and [[Audi A8|A8]]. The Neckarsulm factory is also home of the [[quattro GmbH]], a subsidiary responsible for development and production of Audi high-performance models: the [[Audi R8 (road car)|R8]] and the '''&quot;RS&quot;''' model range.

The mid-sized car that NSU had been working on, the [[VW K70|K70]], was intended to slot between the rear-engined Prinz models and the futuristic [[NSU Ro 80]]. However, Volkswagen took the K70 for its own range, spelling the end of NSU as a separate brand.

===Modern era===
The new merged company was known as '''Audi NSU Auto Union AG''', and saw the emergence of Audi as a separate brand for the first time since the pre-war era. Volkswagen introduced the Audi brand to the United States for the 1970 model year.

The first new car of this regime was the [[Audi 100]] of 1968. This was soon joined by the [[Audi 80]]/Fox (which formed the basis for the 1973 [[Volkswagen Passat]]) in 1972 and the [[Audi 50]] (later rebadged as the [[Volkswagen Polo]]) in 1974. The Audi 50 was a seminal design because it was the first incarnation of the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf/Polo]] concept, one that led to a hugely successful world car.
[[File:Audi quattro.jpg|thumb|right|[[Audi Quattro]]]]

The Audi image at this time was a conservative one, and so, a proposal from chassis engineer [[Jörg Bensinger]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.worldcarfans.com/news.cfm/newsID/2050225.007/country/gcf/audi/audi-quattro-the-early-years
|title = Quattro, The early years
|accessdate = 2 November 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt; was accepted to develop the [[four-wheel drive]] technology in [[Volkswagen]]'s [[Iltis]] military vehicle for an Audi performance car and [[Rallying|rally]] racing car. The performance car, introduced in 1980, was named the &quot;[[Audi Quattro]]&quot;, a [[turbo]]charged coupé which was also the first German large-scale production vehicle to feature permanent [[all-wheel drive]] through a centre [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]]. Commonly referred to as the &quot;Ur-Quattro&quot; (the &quot;[[Proto-World language|Ur-]]&quot; prefix is a German [[augmentative]] used, in this case, to mean &quot;original&quot; and is also applied to the first generation of Audi's [[Audi S4|S4]] and [[Audi S6|S6]] Sport Saloons, as in &quot;UrS4&quot; and &quot;UrS6&quot;), few of these vehicles were produced (all hand-built by a single team), but the model was a great success in rallying. Prominent wins proved the viability of all-wheel drive racecars, and the Audi name became associated with advances in automotive technology.

In 1985, with the Auto Union and NSU brands effectively dead, the company's official name was now shortened to simply '''Audi AG'''.

In 1986, as the Passat-based [[Audi 80]] was beginning to develop a kind of &quot;grandfather's car&quot; image, the ''type 89'' was introduced. This completely new development sold extremely well. However, its modern and dynamic exterior belied the low performance of its base engine, and its base package was quite spartan (even the passenger-side mirror was an option.) In 1987, Audi put forward a new and very elegant [[Audi 90]], which had a much superior set of standard features. In the early 1990s, sales began to slump for the Audi 80 series, and some basic construction problems started to surface.

[[File:Audi R8 front.JPG|thumb|right|[[Audi R8 (road car)|Audi R8]]]]
In the early part of the 21st century, Audi set forth on a German racetrack to claim and maintain several World Records, such as Top Speed Endurance. This effort was in-line with the company's heritage from the 1930s racing era [[Silver Arrows]].

Through the early 1990s, Audi began to shift its target market upscale to compete against German automakers [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[BMW]]. This began with the release of the [[Audi V8]] in 1990. It was essentially a new engine fitted to the Audi 100/200, but with noticeable bodywork differences. Most obvious was the new grille that was now incorporated in the bonnet.

By 1991, Audi had the 4 cylinder [[Audi 80]], the 5 cylinder [[Audi 80|Audi 90]] and [[Audi 100]], the turbocharged [[Audi 100|Audi 200]] and the Audi V8. There was also a coupe version of the 80/90 with both 4 and 5 cylinder engines.

Although the five cylinder engine was a successful and robust powerplant, it was still a little too different for the target market. With the introduction of an all-new Audi 100 in 1992, Audi introduced a 2.8L [[V6 engine]]. This engine was also fitted to a face-lifted Audi 80 (all 80 and 90 models were now badged 80 except for the USA), giving this model a choice of 4, 5, and 6-cylinder engines, in [[Saloon]], [[Coupé]] and [[Cabriolet (automobile)|Cabriolet]] body styles.

The 5-cylinder was soon dropped as a major engine choice; however, a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] 230&amp;nbsp;hp (169&amp;nbsp;kW) version remained. The engine, initially fitted to the 200 quattro 20V of 1991, was a derivative of the engine fitted to the [[Audi Quattro#Audi Sport Quattro|Sport Quattro]]. It was fitted to the [[Audi Coupé]], and named the [[Audi S2|S2]] and also to the Audi 100 body, and named the [[Audi S4|S4]]. These two models were the beginning of the mass-produced [[Audi S models|S series]] of performance cars.

===Unintended Acceleration===
Sales fell after a series of recalls from 1982-1987 of [[Audi 5000]] models&lt;ref name=&quot;bus week&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Audi 1980s Scare May Mean Lost Generation for Toyota | journal = Business Week| date=4 February 2010|first=Andreas|last=Cremer|first2=Tom|last2=Lavell| url = http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-02-04/audi-s-1980s-scare-may-mean-lost-generation-for-toyota-sales.html| accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with reported incidents of [[sudden unintended acceleration]] linked to six deaths and 700 accidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;bus week&quot;/&gt;  At the time, NHTSA was investigating 50 car models from 20 manufacturers for sudden surges of power.&lt;ref name=&quot;renamed&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = A Hard Sell for Audi | newspaper = The New York Times|first=John|last=Holusha|date=24 July 1988 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/24/business/a-hard-sell-for-audi.html?scp=14&amp;sq=audi%20sudden%20acceleration&amp;st=cse | accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audi contended, prior to findings by outside investigators,&lt;ref name=&quot;renamed&quot;/&gt; that the problems were caused by driver error, specifically pedal misapplication.&lt;ref name=&quot;renamed&quot;/&gt;  Subsequently, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) concluded that the majority of unintended acceleration cases, including all the ones that prompted the ''60 Minutes'' report, were caused by driver error such as confusion of pedals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=highbeam com|work=The Washington Post|date=16 April  1989|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1185635.html | title=Unfair at Any Speed|first=Brock |last=Yates|accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CBS did not acknowledge the test results of involved government agencies, but did acknowledge the similar results of another study.&lt;ref name=&quot;huber&quot;/&gt;

With the series of recall campaigns, Audi made several modifications; the first adjusted the distance between the brake and accelerator pedal on automatic-transmission models.&lt;ref name=&quot;bus week&quot;/&gt;  Later repairs, of 250,000 cars dating back to 1978, added a device requiring the driver to press the brake pedal before shifting out of park.&lt;ref name=&quot;bus week&quot;/&gt;  A legacy of the Audi 5000 and other reported cased of sudden unintended acceleration are intricate [[gear stick]] patterns and brake [[interlock]] mechanisms to prevent inadvertent shifting into forward or reverse.

[[File:Audi aurangabad.jpg|thumb|right|Audi plant in [[Aurangabad]], [[India]]]]

Audi's sales grew strongly in the 2000s, with deliveries to customers increasing from 653,000 in 2000 to 1,003,000 in 2008. The largest sales increases came from [[Eastern Europe]] (+19.3%), Africa (+17.2%) and the Middle East (+58.5%). China in particular has become a key market, representing 108,000 out of 705,000 cars delivered in the first three quarters of 2009.  One factor for its popularity is China is that Audis have become the car of choice for purchase by the Chinese government for officials, and purchases by the government are responsible for 20% of its sales in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2010/10/20/audis-millionth-car-sale-shows-china-still-tops/ |title=China: Audi sells a million &amp;#124; beyondbrics &amp;#124; News and views on emerging markets from the Financial Times – FT.com |publisher=Blogs.ft.com |date=2010-10-20 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 2009, Audi's operating profit of €1.17-billion ($1.85-billion) made it the biggest contributor to parent Volkswagen Group's nine-month operating profit of €1.5-billion, while the other marques in Group such as Bentley and Seat had suffered considerable losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Canada |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/new-cars/auto-news/audis-a-game/article1377213/ |title=Audi's A game |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audi has 6 manufacturing plants around the world: [[Ingolstadt]], Germany since 1969, Neckarsulm, Germany since 1969, [[Györ]], Hungary, [[Changchun]], China since 1995, [[Brussels]], Belgium since 2007, [[Aurangabad]], India since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audi.com/com/brand/en/company/production_plants/aurangabad.html#source=http://www.audi.com/com/brand/en/company/production_plants.html&amp;container=page |title=Audi Worldwide &gt; Company &gt; Production plants &gt; Aurangabad |publisher=Audi.com |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
===Bodyshells===
Audi produces 100% [[Galvanisation|galvanised]] [[automobiles|cars]] to prevent [[corrosion]],&lt;ref&gt;Audi website http://www.audiusa.com/audi/us/en2/tools/glossary/chassis_body/corrosion_protection.html&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first mass-market vehicle to do so, following introduction of the process by [[Porsche]], c.1975. Along with other precautionary measures, the full-body [[zinc]] coating has proved to be very effective in preventing rust. The body's resulting durability even surpassed Audi's own expectations, causing the manufacturer to extend its original 10-year [[warranty]] against corrosion perforation to currently 12 years (except for aluminium bodies which don't rust).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Audi of America - http://www.audiusa.com |url=http://www.audiusa.com/audi/us/en2/tools/glossary/chassis_body/galvanised_body.html |title=Audi of America &gt; Glossary &gt; Chassis &amp; Body &gt; Galvanised body |publisher=Audiusa.com |date= |accessdate=27 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An all-[[aluminium]] car was brought forward by Audi, and in 1994 the [[Audi A8]] was launched, which introduced aluminium [[space frame]] technology (called ''Audi Space Frame''). Audi introduced a new series of vehicles in the mid-nineties and continues to new technology and high performance. Prior to that effort, Audi used examples of the Type 44 chassis fabricated out of aluminium as test-beds for the technique.

===Drive layout===
In all its post [[Volkswagen]]-era models, Audi has firmly refused to adopt the traditional [[rear-wheel drive]] layout favored by its two arch rivals [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[BMW]], favoring either [[front-wheel drive]] or [[four-wheel drive|all wheel drive]]. The majority of Audi's lineup in the United States features all wheel drive standard on most of its expensive vehicles (only the entry-level trims of the A4 and A6 are available with front-wheel drive), in contrast to [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[BMW]] whose lineup treats all-wheel drive as an option (BMW only started offering all-wheel drive on its 7 Series starting in the 2010 model year, while the Audi A8 has had all-wheel drive available/standard since the 1990s). Regarding high-performance variants, [[Audi S and RS models]] have always had all-wheel drive, unlike their direct rivals from [[BMW M]] and [[Mercedes-AMG]] which are rear-wheel drive only. 

For most of its lineup (excluding the A3, A1, and TT models), Audi has not adopted the transverse engine layout which is found in economy cars, since that would limit the type and power of engines that can be installed. In order to be able to mount powerful engines (such as a V8 engine in the [[Audi S4]] and [[Audi RS4]]), Audi has usually engineered its more expensive cars with a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally]] [[Front-engine design|front mounted engine]], in an &quot;overhung&quot; position, over the front wheels in front of the axle line. While this allows for the easy adoption of all wheel drive, it goes against the ideal 50:50 weight distribution (as do all front wheel drive cars).

Audi has recently applied the ''[[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]]'' badge to models such as the A3 and TT which do not use the [[Torsen]]-based system as in prior years with a mechanical centre differential, but with the Swedish [[Haldex Traction]] electro-mechanical clutch AWD system.

===Space frame===
Replacing the [[Audi V8]] in 1994, the [[Audi A8]] debuted with an aluminum [[space frame]] (the &quot;Audi Space Frame&quot; or ASF) which saves weight and improves torsion rigidity compared to a conventional steel frame. The weight reduction is somewhat offset by the [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] [[four-wheel drive]] system which is standard in most markets. Nonetheless, the A8 is usually the lightest all-wheel drive car in the full-size luxury segment, also having best-in-class fuel economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson |first=Thane |url=http://www.businessweek.com/lifestyle/content/oct2010/bw2010104_140585.htm |title=Review: 2011 Audi A8 |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=2010-10-05 |accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disadvantage of the aluminum frame is that it is very expensive to repair and requires a specialized aluminum bodyshop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/09q1/2007_audi_s8-long-term_road_test/sidebar_page_3]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Audi A2]], [[Audi TT]] and [[Audi R8 (road car)|Audi R8]] also use Audi Space Frame designs.

===Audi A2===
The [[Audi A2]] was a futuristic super mini born from the Al2 concept. It featured many features that gave Audi the cutting edge technology that it had lacked for years, like the aluminium space frame which was a first in production car design. In the A2 Audi further expanded their TDI technology through the use of frugal three cylinder engines. The A2 was extremely aerodynamic and was designed around a [[wind tunnel]]. The Audi A2 was criticised for its high price and was never really a sales success but it planted Audi as a cutting edge manufacturer. The model, a [[Mercedes-Benz A-Class]] competitor, sold relatively well in Europe. However, the A2 was discontinued in 2005 and Audi decided not to develop an immediate replacement.

===Audi A4===
The next major model change came in 1995 when the [[Audi A4]] replaced the [[Audi 80]]. The new nomenclature scheme was applied to the Audi 100 to become the [[Audi A6]] (with a minor facelift). This also meant the S4 became the [[Audi S6|S6]] and a new S4 was introduced in the A4 body. The S2 was discontinued. The [[Audi Cabriolet]] continued on (based on the Audi 80 platform) until 1999, gaining the engine upgrades along the way. A new [[Audi A3|A3]] [[hatchback]] model (sharing the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4]]'s platform) was introduced to the range in 1996, and the radical [[Audi TT]] [[coupé]] and [[roadster]] were debuted in 1998 based on the same underpinnings.

The engines available throughout the range were now a 1.4L, 1.6L and 1.8L 4 cylinder, 1.8L 4-cylinder turbo, 2.6L and 2.8L [[V6 engine|V6]], 2.2L turbo-charged 5 cylinder and the 4.2L [[V8 engine]]. The V6s were replaced by new 2.4L and 2.8L 30V V6s in 1998, with marked improvement in power, torque and smoothness. Further engines were added along the way, including a 3.7L V8 and 6.0L [[W12 engine]] for the A8.

===Direct-Shift Gearbox===
At the turn of the century, Volkswagen introduced the [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]] (DSG), a type of [[dual clutch transmission]].  It is an automated [[semi-automatic transmission]], drivable like a conventional [[automatic transmission]]. Based on the gearbox found in the Group B S1, the system includes dual electrohydraulically controlled [[clutch]]es instead of a [[torque converter]]. This is implemented in some [[Volkswagen Golf|VW Golfs]], [[Audi A3]] and [[Audi TT|TT]] models where DSG is called S-tronic.

===Fuel Stratified Injection===
New models of the A3, A4, A6 and A8 have been introduced, with the aging 1.8 litre engine now having been replaced by new [[Gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) engines. Nearly every petroleum burning model in the range now incorporates this fuel-saving technology.

===Electric technology===
Audi is planning an alliance with the Japanese electronic giant [[Sanyo]] to develop a pilot hybrid electric project for the [[Volkswagen Group]]. The alliance could result in Sanyo batteries and other electronic components being used in future models of the Volkswagen Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www6.lexisnexis.com/publisher/EndUser?Action=UserDisplayFullDocument&amp;orgId=101846&amp;topicId=103840033&amp;docId=l:788745336&lt;/ref&gt;

===LED daytime running lights===
[[File:LED DaytimeRunningLights.jpg|thumb|The DRL in a Audi A4 B8]]
Beginning in 2006, Audi has implemented white [[light-emitting diode|LED]] technology as [[daytime running light]]s in their products. The distinctive shape of the DRLs has become a trademark of sorts. LEDs were first introduced on the [[Audi S6]], and have since spread throughout the entire model range.

===Multi Media Interface===
Audi has recently started offering a computerised control system for its cars, called [[Multi Media Interface]] (MMI).  This came amid criticism of BMW's [[iDrive]] control.  It is essentially a rotating control knob and 'segment' buttons - designed to control all in-car entertainment devices (radio, CD changer, iPod, TV tuner), satellite navigation, heating and ventilation, and other car controls with a screen.  MMI was widely reported to be a considerable improvement on BMW's iDrive, although BMW has since made their iDrive more user-friendly.

MMI has been generally well-received, as it requires less menu-surfing with its segment buttons around a central knob, along with 'main function' direct access buttons - with shortcuts to the radio or phone functions.  The screen, either colour or monochrome, is mounted on the upright dashboard, and on the A4 (new), A5, A6, A8, and Q7, the controls are mounted horizontally.

An &quot;MMI-like&quot; system is also available on the A3, TT, A4 (B7), and R8 models - when equipped with the Audi Navigation System Plus (RNS-E) satellite navigation system.
==Engines==
In the 1980s, Audi, along with Volvo, was the champion of the [[Straight-5|inline 5]] cylinder, [[Engine displacement|2.1/2.2 L]] engine as a longer-lasting alternative to more traditional 6 cylinder engines. This engine was used not only in production cars but also in their race cars. The 2.1&amp;nbsp;L inline 5 cylinder engine was used as a base for the [[Rallying|rally cars]] in the 1980s, providing well over 400 [[horsepower]] (298&amp;nbsp;kW) after modification. Before 1990, there were engines produced with a displacement between 2.0&amp;nbsp;L and 2.3&amp;nbsp;L. This range of engine capacity allowed for both fuel economy and power.

[[Image:Volkswagen W12.jpg|thumb|[[Volkswagen Group]] W12 engine from the [[Volkswagen Phaeton|Volkswagen Phaeton W12]]]]

For the ultra-luxury version of its [[Audi A8]] fullsize luxury flagship sedan, the Audi A8L W12, Audi uses the [[Volkswagen Group]] [[list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines#W12|W12 engine]] instead of the conventional [[V12 engine]] favored by rivals Mercedes-Benz and BMW. The W12 engine configuration (also known as a &quot;WR12&quot;) is created by forming two imaginary narrow-angle 15° [[VR6 engine]]s at an angle of 72°, and the narrow angle of each set of cylinders allows just two [[overhead camshaft]]s to drive each pair of banks, so just four are needed in total.&lt;ref name=AutoZine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autozine.org/technical_school/engine/tech_engine_packaging.htm#W12|title=Volkswagen's VR6 and W-engines - W12|first=Mark|last=Wan|work=AutoZine.org|accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of the W12 engine is its compact packaging, allowing Audi to build a 12-cylinder sedan with all-wheel drive, whereas a conventional [[V12 engine]] could only have a rear-wheel drive configuration as it would have no space in the engine bay for a differential and other components required to power the front wheels. In fact, the 6.0L W12 in the Audi A8L W12 is actually a bit smaller by overall dimensions than the 4.2L V8 that powers the Audi A8 4.2 variants. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newcartestdrive.com/review-intro.cfm?Vehicle=2005_Audi_A8&amp;ReviewID=2934]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 Audi A8 debuted a revised 6.3 liter version of the W12 (WR12) engine with 500 PS.

==Motorsports==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}
Audi has competed in numerous forms of [[auto racing|motorsports]]. Audi's rich tradition in motorsport began with their former company [[Auto Union]] in the 1930s. In the 1990s, Audi dominated the Touring and Super Touring categories of motor racing after success in circuit racing in North America.

===Rallying===
[[File:Portugal 84 Audi Quattro A2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Röhrl]] with his Quattro A2 during the 1984 [[Rally Portugal]].]]
In 1980, Audi released the [[Audi Quattro|Quattro]], a [[four-wheel drive]] (4WD) [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] car that went on to win [[rally racing|rallies]] and races worldwide.  It is considered one of the most significant rally cars of all time, because it was one of the first to take advantage of the then-recently changed rules which allowed the use of four-wheel drive in competition racing.  Many critics doubted the viability of four-wheel drive racers, thinking them to be too heavy and complex, yet the Quattro was to become a successful car.  Leading its first rally it went off the road, however the rally world had been served notice 4WD was the future.  The Quattro went on to achieve much success in the [[World Rally Championship]].  It won the [[1983 World Rally Championship season|1983]] ([[Hannu Mikkola]]) and the [[1984 World Rally Championship season|1984]] ([[Stig Blomqvist]]) [[list of World Rally Championship Drivers' Champions|drivers' titles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Rally Championship for Drivers - Champions|work=RallyBase.nl|url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=championlist&amp;subchamptype=wcd|accessdate=30 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and brought Audi the [[list of World Rally Championship Constructors' Champions|manufacturers' title]] in [[1982 World Rally Championship season|1982]] and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Rally Championship for Manufacturers - Champions|work=RallyBase.nl|url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=championlist&amp;subchamptype=wrc|accessdate=30 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Audi Quattro - 2007 Rallye Deutschland (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Audi Quattro S1]] driven at the [[2007 Rallye Deutschland]]]]

In 1984, Audi launched the short-wheelbase [[Audi Quattro#Sport Quattro|Sport Quattro]] which dominated rally races in [[Monte Carlo Rally|Monte Carlo]] and [[Swedish Rally|Sweden]], with Audi taking all podium places, but succumbed to problems further into WRC contention.  In [[1985 World Rally Championship season|1985]], after another season mired in mediocre finishes, [[Walter Röhrl]] finished the season in his [[Audi Quattro#Sport Quattro S1|Sport Quattro S1]], and helped place Audi second in the manufacturers' points.  Audi also received rally honours in the Hong Kong to Beijing rally in that same year.  [[Michèle Mouton]], the only female driver to win a round of the World Rally Championship and a driver for Audi, took the Sport Quattro S1, now simply called the &quot;S1&quot;, and raced in the [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]].  The climb race pits a driver and car to drive up a 4,302&amp;nbsp;metre high mountain in [[Colorado]] and in 1985, Michèle Mouton set a new record of 11:25.39, and being the first woman to set a Pikes Peak record.  In [[1986 World Rally Championship season|1986]], Audi formally left international rally racing following an accident in [[Rally Portugal|Portugal]] involving driver [[Joaquim Santos]] in his [[Ford RS200]].  Santos swerved to avoid hitting spectators in the road, and left the track into the crowd of spectators on the side, killing three and injuring 30.  [[Bobby Unser]] used an Audi in that same year to claim a new record for the Pikes Peak Hill Climb at 11:09.22.

In 1987, Walter Röhrl claimed the title for Audi setting a new [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]] record of 10:47.85 in his Audi S1, which he had retired from the WRC two years earlier.  The Audi S1 employed Audi's time-tested [[straight-five engine|inline five cylinder]] turbocharged engine, with the final version generating {{convert|441|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quattro25&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audiusanews.com/newsrelease.do?id=211|title=25 Years of Audi Quattro|work=Audi AG|accessdate=31 March 2009|date=22 February 2005|publisher=Audi Of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The engine was mated to a six-speed gearbox and ran on Audi's famous four-wheel drive system.  All of Audi's top drivers drove this car; Hannu Mikkola, Stig Blomqvist, Walter Röhrl and Michèle Mouton.  This Audi S1 started the range of Audi [[Audi S and RS models#S|'S' cars]], which now represents an increased level of sports-performance equipment within the mainstream Audi model range.

===In the USA===
As Audi moved away from rallying and into circuit racing, they chose to move first into America with the [[Trans-Am Series|Trans-Am]] in 1988.

In 1989, Audi moved to [[International Motor Sports Association]] (IMSA) [[IMSA GT Championship|GTO]] with the [[Audi 80|Audi 90]], however as they avoided the two major endurance events (Daytona and Sebring) despite winning on a regular basis, they would lose out on the title.

===Touring cars===
In 1990, having completed their objective to market cars in North America, Audi returned to Europe, turning first to the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft]] (DTM) series with the [[Audi V8]], and then in 1993, being unwilling to build cars for the new formula, they turned their attention to the fast growing [[Super Touring]] series, which are a series of national championships.  Audi first entered in the [[French Supertouring Championship|French Supertourisme]] and [[Italian Superturismo Championship|Italian Superturismo]].  In the following year, Audi would switch to the German [[Super Tourenwagen Cup]] (known as STW), and then to [[British Touring Car Championship]] (BTCC) the year after that.

The [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), having difficulty regulating the [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] four wheel drive system, and the impact it had on the competitors, would eventually ban all four wheel drive cars from competing in 1998{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, but by then, Audi switched all their works efforts to [[sports car racing]].

By 2000, Audi would still compete in the US with their [[Audi RS4#B5|RS4]] for the [[SPEED World Challenge|SCCA Speed World GT Challenge]], through dealer/team [[Champion Racing]] competing against Corvettes, Vipers, and smaller BMWs (where it is one of the few series to permit 4WD cars).  In 2003, Champion Racing entered an [[Audi RS6#C5|RS6]].  Once again, the quattro four wheel drive was superior, and Champion Audi won the championship.  They returned in 2004 to defend their title, but a newcomer, Cadillac with the new Omega Chassis CTS-V, gave them a run for their money.  After four victories in a row, the Audis were sanctioned with several negative changes that deeply affected the car's performance.  Namely, added ballast weights, and Champion Audi deciding to go with different tyres, and reducing the boost pressure of the turbocharger.

In 2004, after years of competing with the [[Audi TT|TT-R]] in the revitalised DTM series, with privateer team Abt Racing/[[Christian Abt]] taking the 2002 title with [[Laurent Aïello]], Audi returned as a full factory effort to touring car racing by entering two factory supported [[Joest Racing]] [[Audi A4#Audi Sport A4 DTM|A4 DTM]] cars.

===Sports car racing===
[[File:Audi R10 1.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Audi R10 TDI]]]]
Starting in 1999, Audi built the [[Audi R8R]] (open-cockpit 'roadster' prototype) and the [[Audi R8C]] (closed-cockpit 'coupé' GT-prototype) to compete in [[sports car racing]], including the [[Le Mans Prototype]] LMP900 class at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]].  For the 2000 season, Audi focussed mainly on the new [[Audi R8 (race car)|Audi R8]], due to favourable rules for open-cockpit prototypes. However, most of the competitors (such as BMW, Toyota, Mercedes and Nissan) retired at the end of 1999.
The factory-supported [[Joest Racing]] team won at Le Mans three times in a row with the Audi R8 (2000–2002), as well as winning every race in the [[American Le Mans Series]] in its first year.  Audi also sold the car to customer teams such as [[Champion Racing]].

In 2003, two [[Bentley Speed 8]]s, with engines designed by Audi, and driven by Joest drivers ''loaned'' to the fellow [[Volkswagen Group]] company, competed in the GTP class, and finished the race in the top two positions, while the Champion Racing R8 finished third overall, and first in the LMP900 class.  Audi returned to the winner's podium at the 2004 race, with the top three finishers all driving R8s: Audi Sport Japan Team Goh finished first, Audi Sport UK Veloqx second, and Champion Racing third.

At the [[2005 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Champion Racing entered two R8s, along with an R8 from the Audi PlayStation Team [[Oreca]].  The R8s (which were built to old LMP900 regulations) received a narrower air inlet restrictor, reducing power, and an additional {{convert|50|kg|0|abbr=on}} of weight compared to the newer LMP1 chassis.  On average, the R8s were about 2–3&amp;nbsp;seconds off pace compared to the [[Pescarolo Sport|Pescarolo]]&amp;ndash;[[Judd (engine)|Judd]].  But with a team of excellent drivers and experience, both Champion R8s were able to take first and third, while the ORECA team took fourth.  The Champion team was also the first American team to win Le Mans since the Gulf Ford GT's in 1967.  This also ends the long era of the R8; however, its replacement for 2006, called the [[Audi R10 TDI]], was unveiled on 13 December 2005.

The R10 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]] employed many new and innovative features, the most notable being the the [[twin-turbo]]charged [[fuel injection#Direct injection|direct injection]] [[diesel engine]].  It was first raced in the [[2006 12 Hours of Sebring]] as a race-test in preparation for the [[2006 24 Hours of Le Mans]], which it later went on to win.  Audi has been on the forefront of sports car racing, claiming a historic win in the first ever diesel sports car at 12 Hours of Sebring (the car was developed with a Diesel engine due to ACO regolamentation that favor diesel engine).  As well as winning the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in 2006 making history, the R10 TDI has also shown its capabilities by beating the [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP]] in {{24hLM|2007}}, and beating Peugeot again in {{24hLM|2008}}, (however Peugeot won the 24h in 2009) and, in a podium clean-sweep by proving its reliability throughout the race (compared to all four 908 entries retired before the end of the race) while breaking a new distance record (set way back by the [[Porsche 917]]K of [[Martini Racing]] in {{24hLM|1971}}), in {{24hLM|2010}} with the [[Audi R15 TDI|R15 TDI Plus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.joest-racing.de/web/news/news.php?id=541&amp;sprache=e | title = Audi achieves record victory at Le Mans with new technology  | work = joest-racing.de; [[Audi Sport]] | publisher = Joest Racing | date = 2010-06-13 | accessdate = 2010-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
[[File:Audi Logo.svg|thumb|right|The old logo used by Audi until 2009]]

===Logos===
The Audi emblem is four overlapping rings that represent the four [[marque]]s of Auto Union. The Audi emblem symbolises the amalgamation of Audi with DKW, Horch and Wanderer: the first ring from the left represents Audi, the second represents DKW, third is Horch, and the fourth and last ring Wanderer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Its similarity to the Olympic rings caused the International Olympic Committee to sue Audi in International Trademark Court in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoevolution.com/news/audi-reveals-updated-logo-10315.html |title=Audi Reveals Updated Logo |accessdate=27 August 2009 |author=Alina Dumitrache |publisher=autoevolution.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of Audi's centennial celebration in 2009, the company updated the logo, changing the [[font]] to left-aligned Audi Type, and altering the shading for the overlapping rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wot.motortrend.com/6546262/marketing/audi-unveils-updated-logo-following-centennial-celebration/index.html |title=Audi Unveils Updated Logo Following Centennial Celebration |publisher=Wot.motortrend.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The logo was designed by Rayan Abdullah.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mosul-network.org/index.php?do=article&amp;id=18707&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slogans===
Audi's corporate [[tagline]] is ''[[Vorsprung durch Technik]]'', meaning ''&quot;Progress through Technology&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Eco-Culture | journal = Audi magazine | issue = 3/08 | page = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German-language tagline is used in many European countries, including the United Kingdom, and in other markets, such as Latin America, [[Oceania]] and parts of Asia including Japan. A few years ago, the North American tagline was ''&quot;Innovation through technology&quot;'', but in Canada the German tagline ''Vorsprung durch Technik'' was used in advertising. More recently, however, Audi has updated the tagline to &quot;Truth in Engineering&quot; in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Lavrinc, Damon.

===Multitronic campaign===
&lt;!--do noy change multitronic to uppercase, it is trademarked in all lowercase - Thank you--&gt;
In 2001, Audi promoted the new [[multitronic]] [[continuously variable transmission]] with television commercials throughout Europe, featuring an impersonator of musician and actor [[Elvis Presley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQo95oI4nXY |title=Audi Wackel-Elvis commercial (2001, British version) |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1czNu9pTzM |title=Audi Wackel-Elvis commercial (2001, German version) |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[prototypical]] dashboard figure - later named &quot;[[Wackel-Elvis]]&quot; (&quot;Wobble Elvis&quot; or &quot;Wobbly Elvis&quot;) - appeared in the commercials to demonstrate the smooth ride in an Audi equipped with the multitronic transmission. The dashboard figure was originally intended for use in the commercials only, but after they aired the demand for Wackel-Elvis fans grew among fans and the figure was mass produced in China and marketed by Audi in their factory outlet store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welt.de/print-welt/article456186/Wackel_Elvis_von_Audi_Fans_stehen_Schlange.html |title=Fans Waiting in Line for Release of Wackel-Elvis, 06 November 2001, '&amp;#39;Die Welt'&amp;#39; (German) |language={{de icon}} |publisher=Welt.de |date=2001-06-11 |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typography===
Audi Sans (based on [[Univers]] Extended) was originally created in 1997 by Ole Schäfer for [[MetaDesign]].

MetaDesign was later commissioned for a new corporate typeface called Audi Type, designed by Paul van der Laan and Pieter van Rosmalen of [[Bold Monday]]. The font began to appear in Audi's 2009 products and marketing materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boldmonday.com/en/audi |title=Bold Monday: Audi Type |publisher=boldmonday.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In video games===
In [[PlayStation Home]], the [[PlayStation 3]]'s online community-based service, Audi has supported Home by releasing a dedicated [[List of PlayStation Home Game Spaces#Non-gaming Company Spaces|Home space]] in the European version of Home. Audi is the first carmaker to develop a space for Home. On 17 December 2009, Audi released the Audi Space as two spaces; the Audi Home Terminal and the Audi Vertical Run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/audi-to-launch-playstation-download-game/3007770.article|title=Audi to launch PlayStation download game|date=10 December 2009|last=Fernandez|first=Joe|publisher=[[Marketing Week]]|accessdate=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Audi Home Terminal features an Audi TV channel delivering video content, an Internet Browser feature, and a view of a city. The Audi Vertical Run is where users can access the mini-game Vertical Run, a futuristic mini-game featuring Audi's e-tron concept. Players collect energy and race for the highest possible speeds and the fastest players earn a place in the Audi apartments located in a large tower in the centre of the Audi Space. In both the Home Terminal and Vertical Run spaces, there are teleports where users can teleport back and forth between the two spaces. Audi has stated that additional content will be added in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-10358137-48.html|title=Audi creates virtual Audi Space within PlayStation Home|publisher=[[CNET]] Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Most young people gain their first driving experience from video games&quot;, explains Kai Mensing, who is responsible for video games and virtual worlds in Online Marketing at Audi. &quot;With the Audi Space, we can bring this target group into contact with our brand in a highly emotion-packed and interactive environment, and demonstrate our 'Vorsprung durch Technik' with the virtual e-tron race.&quot; Kai Mensing's most recent statement on the Audi Space was that &quot;As a brand, Audi sees great value and potential in the experiences and level of interaction the world of gaming affords. PlayStation Home gives Audi the perfect environment to connect with gamers in an unexpected way and we made sure to push the platform to its limits with the new Audi Space.&quot;

===Audi TDI ===
As part of Audi's attempt to promote its Diesel technology in 2009, the company began Audi Mileage Marathon. The driving tour featured a fleet of 23 Audi TDI vehicles from 4 models ([[Audi Q7]] 3.0 TDI, [[Audi Q5]] 3.0 TDI, [[Audi A4]] 3.0 TDI, [[Audi A3]] Sportback 2.0 TDI with S tronic transmission) travelling across the American continent from New York to Los Angeles, passing major cities like Chicago, Dallas and Las Vegas during the 13 daily stages, as well as natural wonders including the Rocky Mountains, Death Valley and the Grand Canyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam |url=http://green.autoblog.com/2008/09/08/audi-to-kick-off-diesel-push-with-cross-country-mileage-marathon/ |title=Audi to kick off diesel push with cross country Mileage Marathon |publisher=Green.autoblog.com |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audi e-tron===
The next phase of technology Audi is developing is the [[Audi e-tron|e-tron]] electric drive powertrain system.  They have shown several concept cars {{as of|March 2010|lc=on}}, each with different levels of size and performance.  The original e-tron concept shown at the 2009 [[Frankfurt motor show]] is based on the platform of the R8 and has been scheduled for limited production.  Power is provided by electric motors at all four wheels.  The second concept was shown at the 2010 [[Detroit Motor Show]].  Power is provided by two electric motors at the rear axle.  This concept is also considered to be the direction for a future mid-engined gas powered 2 seat performance coupe.  The [[Audi A1]] e-tron concept, based on the Audi A1 production model, is a [[hybrid vehicle]] with a range extending [[Wankel rotary engine]] to provide power after the initial charge of the battery is depleted.  It is the only concept of the three to have range extending capability. The car is powered through the front wheels, always using electric power.

[[File:2006 Ojiya balloon festival 011.jpg|thumb|A hot air [[balloon (aircraft)]] in flight.]]

'''Aircraft''' are [[vehicles]] which are able to [[flight|fly]] by being supported by the [[air]], or in general, the [[atmosphere]] of a planet.&lt;!--English word &quot;aircraft&quot; is singular and plural with no &quot;s&quot;. See also the link to Wiktionary below.--&gt; An aircraft counters the force of gravity by using either [[Buoyancy|static lift]] or by using the [[Lift (force)|dynamic lift]] of an [[airfoil]], or in a few cases the downward thrust from [[jet engines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/aircraft dictionary.com definition of aircraft]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[rocket]]s and [[missile]]s also travel through the atmosphere, most are not considered aircraft because they use rocket thrust instead of aerodynamics as the primary means of lift. However, [[rocket planes]] and [[cruise missile]]s are considered aircraft because they rely on lift from the air. Another type of aircraft is the [[spaceplane]] which is an aircraft designed to fly up to extreme altitudes into space and land as a conventional aircraft. 

The [[human]] activity which surrounds aircraft is called ''[[aviation]]''. Manned aircraft are flown by an onboard [[aviator|pilot]]. [[Unmanned aerial vehicles]] may be [[remotely piloted vehicle|remotely controlled]] or self-controlled by onboard computers. [[Target drone]]s are an example of UAVs.  Aircraft may be classified by different criteria, such as lift type, propulsion, usage and others.

==History==
{{Main|Aviation history}}
{{See also|Timeline of aviation}}

The history of aircraft development divides broadly into five eras:
*[[List of early flying machines|Pioneers of flight]]
*[[World War I|First World War]]
*Inter-war, sometimes called the Golden Age
*[[World War II|Second World War]]
*Postwar era, also called the [[jet age]]

==Methods of lift==
===Lighter than air – aerostats===

[[Aerostat]]s use [[buoyancy]] to float in the air in much the same way that ships float on the water. They are characterized by one or more large gasbags or canopies, filled with a relatively low density gas such as [[helium]], [[hydrogen]] or [[hot air balloon|hot air]], which is less dense than the surrounding air. When the weight of this is added to the weight of the aircraft structure, it adds up to the same weight as the air that the craft displaces.

Small hot air balloons called [[Kongming lantern|sky lanterns]] date back to the 3rd century BC, and were only the second type of aircraft to fly, the first being [[kite]]s.

Originally, a [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] was any aerostat, while the term [[airship]] was used for large, powered aircraft designs – usually fixed-wing{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} – though none had yet been built. The advent of powered balloons, called dirigible balloons, and later of rigid hulls allowing a great increase in size, began to change the way these words were used. Huge powered aerostats, characterized by a [[rigid airship|rigid]] outer framework and separate aerodynamic skin surrounding the gas bags, were produced, the [[Zeppelin]]s being the largest and most famous. There were still no fixed-wing aircraft or non-rigid balloons large enough to be called airships, so &quot;airship&quot; came to be synonymous with these aircraft. Then several accidents, such as the [[Hindenburg disaster]] in 1937, led to the demise of these airships. Nowadays a &quot;balloon&quot; is an unpowered aerostat, whilst an &quot;airship&quot; is a powered one.

A powered, steerable aerostat is called a ''[[dirigible]]''. Sometimes this term is applied only to non-rigid balloons, and sometimes ''dirigible balloon'' is regarded as the definition of an airship (which may then be rigid or non-rigid). Non-rigid dirigibles are characterized by a moderately aerodynamic gasbag with stabilizing fins at the back. These soon became known as ''[[non-rigid airship|blimps]]''. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], this shape was widely adopted for tethered balloons; in windy weather, this both reduces the strain on the tether and stabilizes the balloon. The nickname ''blimp'' was adopted along with the shape. In modern times any small dirigible or airship is called a blimp, though a blimp may be unpowered as well as powered.

===Heavier than air – aerodynes===
Heavier-than-air aircraft must find some way to push air or gas downwards, so that a reaction occurs (by Newton's laws of motion) to push the aircraft upwards. This dynamic movement through the air is the origin of the term ''aerodyne''. There are two ways to produce dynamic upthrust: [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic lift]], and [[powered lift]] in the form of engine thrust.

Aerodynamic lift involving [[wing]]s is the most common, with [[fixed-wing aircraft]] being kept in the air by the forward movement of wings, and [[rotorcraft]] by spinning wing-shaped rotors sometimes called rotary wings. A wing is a flat, horizontal surface, usually shaped in cross-section as an [[airfoil|aerofoil]]. To fly, air must flow over the wing and generate [[Lift (force)|lift]]. A ''flexible wing'' is a wing made of fabric or thin sheet material, often stretched over a rigid frame. A ''[[kite]]'' is tethered to the ground and relies on the speed of the wind over its wings, which may be flexible or rigid, fixed or rotary.

With powered lift, the aircraft directs its engine thrust [[vertical direction|vertically]] downwards.

The [[Acronym and initialism|initialism]] ''[[VTOL]]'' ('''v'''ertical '''t'''ake''' o'''ff and '''l'''anding) is applied to aircraft that can take off and land vertically. Most are rotorcraft. Others, such as the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]] and [[F-35_Lightning_II#F-35B|F-35B]], take off and land vertically using powered lift and transfer to aerodynamic lift in steady flight. Similarly, ''[[STOL]]'' stands for '''s'''hort '''t'''ake '''o'''ff and '''l'''anding. Some VTOL aircraft often operate in a '''s'''hort '''t'''ake '''o'''ff/'''v'''ertical '''l'''anding mode known as [[STOVL]].

A pure [[rocket]] is not usually regarded as an aerodyne, because it does not depend on the air for its lift (and can even fly into space); however, many aerodynamic lift vehicles have been powered or assisted by rocket motors. Rocket-powered missiles which obtain aerodynamic lift at very high speed due to airflow over their bodies, are a marginal case.

====Fixed-wing====
[[File:Collection of military aircraft.jpg|thumb|[[NASA]] test aircraft]]
[[File:Giant planes comparison.svg|thumb|A size comparison of some of the largest fixed-wing aircraft. The Airbus A380-800 (largest airliner), the [[Boeing 747]][[Boeing 747-8|-8]], the [[Antonov An-225]] (aircraft with the greatest payload) and the [[Hughes H-4 Hercules|Hughes H-4 &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;]] (aircraft with greatest wingspan).]]

''Airplanes'' or ''aeroplanes'' are technically called ''[[fixed-wing aircraft]]''.

The forerunner of the fixed-wing aircraft is the [[kite]]. Whereas a fixed-wing aircraft relies on its forward speed to create airflow over the wings, a kite is tethered to the ground and relies on the [[wind]] blowing over its wings to provide lift. Kites were the first kind of aircraft to fly, and were invented in [[China]] around 500 BC. Much aerodynamic research was done with kites before test aircraft, wind tunnels and computer modelling programs became available.

The first heavier-than-air craft capable of controlled free flight were [[unpowered aircraft|gliders]].  A [[glider aircraft|glider]] designed by [[George Cayley|Cayley]] carried out the first true manned, controlled flight in 1853.

Besides the method of [[#Propulsion|propulsion]], fixed-wing aircraft are generally characterized by their [[wing configuration]]. The most important wing characteristics are:
*Number of wings – [[Monoplane]], [[biplane]], etc.
*Wing support – Braced or cantilever, rigid or flexible.
*Wing planform – including [[aspect ratio]], angle of [[swept wing|sweep]] and any variations along the span (including the important class of [[delta wing]]s).
*Location of the horizontal stabilizer, if any.
*[[Dihedral (aircraft)|Dihedral angle]] – positive, zero or negative (anhedral).

A [[variable geometry]] aircraft can change its wing configuration during flight.

A ''[[flying wing]]'' has no fuselage, though it may have small blisters or pods. The opposite of this is a ''[[lifting body]]'' which has no wings, though it may have small stabilising and control surfaces.

Most fixed-wing aircraft feature a tail unit or [[empennage]] incorporating vertical, and often horizontal, stabilising surfaces.

''[[Seaplane]]s'' are aircraft that land on water, and they fit into two broad classes:  [[Flying boat]]s are supported on the water by their [[fuselage]].  A [[float plane]]'s fuselage remains clear of the water at all times, the aircraft being supported by two or more floats attached to the fuselage and/or wings.  Some examples of both [[flying boat]]s and [[float plane]]s are [[amphibious aircraft|amphibious]], being able to take off from and alight on both land and water.

Some people consider [[wing-In-Ground effect vehicle|wing-in-ground-effect]] vehicles to be fixed-wing aircraft, others do not. These craft &quot;fly&quot; close to the surface of the ground or water. An example is the Russian [[ekranoplan]] (nicknamed the &quot;Caspian Sea Monster&quot;). [[Human-powered flight|Man-powered aircraft]] also rely on [[ground effect in aircraft|ground effect]] to remain airborne, but this is only because they are so underpowered—the airframe is theoretically capable of flying much higher.

====Rotorcraft====
[[File:P1010525x.jpg|thumb|[[Mil Mi-26]], the world's largest production helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military-today.com/helicopters/mil_mi26_halo.htm Mil Mi-26 Halo]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Rotorcraft}}

Rotorcraft, or rotary-wing aircraft, use a spinning rotor with aerofoil section blades (a ''rotary wing'') to provide lift. Types include [[helicopter]]s, [[autogyro]]s and various hybrids such as [[gyrodyne]]s and compound rotorcraft.

''[[Helicopter]]s'' have powered rotors. The rotor is driven (directly or indirectly) by an engine and pushes air downwards to create lift. By tilting the rotor forwards, the downwards flow is tilted backwards, producing thrust for forward flight.

[[File:FA 330 Line Drawing.jpg|thumb|left|upright|US-Recognition Manual (very likely copy of German drawing).]]
''[[Autogyro]]s'' or ''gyroplanes'' have unpowered rotors, with a separate power plant to provide thrust. The rotor is tilted backwards. As the autogyro moves forward, air blows upwards across the rotor, making it spin.(cf. [[Autorotation]]) This spinning dramatically increases the speed of airflow over the rotor, to provide lift. [[Juan de la Cierva]] (a Spanish civil engineer) used the product name ''autogiro'', and [[Bensen Aircraft|Bensen]] used ''gyrocopter''. ''Rotor kites'', such as the [[Focke Achgelis Fa 330]] are unpowered autogyros, which must be towed by a tether to give them forward ground speed or else be tether-anchored to a static anchor in a high-wind situation for kited flight.

''[[Gyrodyne]]s'' are a form of helicopter, where forward thrust is obtained from a separate propulsion device rather than from tilting the rotor. The definition of a 'gyrodyne' has changed over the years, sometimes including equivalent autogyro designs. The ''Heliplane'' is a similar idea.

''Compound rotorcraft'' have wings which provide some or all of the lift in forward flight. Compound helicopters and compound autogyros have been built, and some forms of gyroplane may be referred to as compound gyroplanes. They are nowadays classified as ''[[powered lift]]'' types and not as rotorcraft. ''[[Tiltrotor]]'' aircraft (such as the [[V-22 Osprey]]) have their rotors horizontal for vertical flight, and pivot the rotors vertically like a [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] for forward flight. The ''[[Coleopter]]'' had a cylindrical wing forming a duct around the rotor. On the ground it sat on its tail, and took off and landed vertically like a helicopter. The whole aircraft would then have tilted forward to fly as a propeller-driven fixed-wing aircraft using the duct as a wing (though this transition was never achieved in practice.)

Some rotorcraft have reaction-powered rotors with gas jets at the tips, but most have one or more lift rotors powered from engine-driven shafts.

====Other methods of lift====
[[File:X24B.jpg|thumb|X24B lifting body, specialized [[glider aircraft|glider]]]]

*A ''[[lifting body]]'' is the opposite of a [[flying wing]]. In this configuration the aircraft body is shaped to produce lift. If there are any wings, they are too small to provide significant lift and are used only for stability and control. Lifting bodies are not efficient: they suffer from high drag, and must also travel at high speed to generate enough lift to fly. Many of the research prototypes, such as the [[Martin-Marietta X-24]], which led up to the [[Space Shuttle]] were lifting bodies (though the shuttle itself is not), and some [[supersonic]] [[missile]]s obtain lift from the airflow over a tubular body.  The flat bodies of recent jet fighters also produce lift, as in the [[F-14 Tomcat]]'s &quot;pancake&quot;.
*''[[Powered lift]]'' types rely on engine-derived lift for vertical takeoff and landing ([[VTOL]]). Most types transition to fixed-wing lift for horizontal flight. Classes of powered lift types include [[VTOL]] jet aircraft (such as the Harrier jump-jet) and [[tiltrotors]] (such as the [[V-22 Osprey]]), among others. A few examples rely entirely on engine thrust to provide lift throughout the whole flight. There are few practical applications. Experimental designs have been built for personal fan-lift hover platforms and jetpacks or for [[VTOL]] research (for example the [[flying Bedstead|flying bedstead]]).
*The ''[[Flettner airplane]]'' has a spinning cylinder in place of a wing, relying on the [[Magnus effect]] to create lift.
*The ''[[FanWing]]'' is a recent innovation with some similarities to the Flettner rotor design. It uses a fixed wing with a cylindrical fan mounted spanwise just above. As the fan spins, it creates an airflow backwards over the upper surface of the wing, creating lift. The FanWing is (2010) in development in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Propulsion==
{{main|air propulsion}}

===Unpowered===
====Gliders====
{{Main|Glider aircraft}}
Heavier-than-air unpowered aircraft such as [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders]] (i.e. sailplanes), [[hang glider]]s and [[paraglider]]s, and other gliders usually do not employ propulsion once airborne. Take-off may be by launching forwards and downwards from a high location, or by pulling into the air on a tow-line, by a ground-based winch or vehicle, or by a powered &quot;tug&quot; aircraft. For a glider to maintain its forward air speed and lift, it must descend in relation to the air (but not necessarily in relation to the ground). Some gliders can 'soar'- gain height from updrafts such as thermal currents. The first practical, controllable example was designed and built by the British scientist and pioneer [[George Cayley]], who many recognise as the first aeronautical engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dee |first= Richard |authorlink= Richard Dee |coauthors= |title= The Man who Discovered Flight: George Cayley and the First Airplane |year= 2007|publisher= McClelland and Stewart|location= Toronto |isbn= 978-0-7710-2971-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Balloons====
{{Main|Balloon (aircraft)}}
Balloons drift with the wind, though normally the pilot can control the altitude, either by heating the air or by releasing ballast, giving some directional control (since the wind direction changes with altitude). A wing-shaped hybrid balloon can glide directionally when rising or falling; but a spherically shaped balloon does not have such directional control.

====Kites====
{{Main|kite}}
Kites are aircraft&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/guided.htm NASA's Beginners Guide to Aeronautics]&lt;/ref&gt; that are tethered to the ground or other object (fixed or mobile) that maintains tension in the tether or [[kite line]]; they rely on virtual or real wind blowing over and under them to generate lift and drag. Kytoons are balloon kites that are shaped and tethered to obtain kiting deflections, and can be lighter-than-air, neutrally buoyant, or heavier-than air.

===Powered===
====Propeller====
{{main|Propeller (aircraft)}}
[[File:WestCoastAirFloatplane.jpg|thumb|A [[turboprop]]-engined [[De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|DeHavilland Twin Otter]] adapted as a [[Seaplane|floatplane]]]]

A propeller or airscrew comprises a set of small, wing-like aerofoils set around a central hub which spins on an axis aligned in the direction of travel. Spinning the propeller creates aerodynamic lift, or ''thrust'', in a forward direction.

A ''tractor'' design mounts the propeller in front of the power source, while a ''pusher'' design mounts it behind. Although the pusher design allows cleaner airflow over the wing, tractor configuration is more common because it allows cleaner airflow to the propeller and provides a better [[weight distribution]].

A ''contra-prop'' arrangement has a second propeller close behind the first one on the same axis, which rotates in the opposite direction.

A variation on the propeller is to use many broad blades to create a fan. Such fans are traditionally surrounded by a ring-shaped fairing or duct, as ''ducted fans''.

Many kinds of power plant have been used to drive propellers.

The earliest designs used [[Human-powered flight|man power]] to give [[dirigible]] balloons some degree of control, and go back to [[Jean-Pierre Blanchard]] in 1784. Attempts to achieve heavier-than-air man-powered flight did not succeed fully until [[Paul MacCready]]'s [[Gossamer Condor]] in 1977.
[[File:Gossamer Albatross II.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gossamer Albatross]], a [[Human-powered flight|human-powered aircraft]]]]

The first powered flight was made in a [[steam aircraft|steam-powered]] dirigible by [[Henri Giffard]] in 1852. Attempts to marry a practical lightweight [[steam engine]] to a practical fixed-wing airframe did not succeed until much later, by which time the internal combustion engine was already dominant.

From the first controlled powered fixed-wing aircraft flight by the [[Wright brothers]] until [[World War II]], propellers turned by the [[Internal combustion engine|internal combustion piston engine]] were virtually the only type of propulsion system in use.  The piston engine is still used in the majority of smaller aircraft produced, since it is efficient at the lower altitudes and slower speeds suited to propellers.

Turbine engines need not be used as jets (see below), but may be geared to drive a propeller in the form of a [[turboprop]]. Modern helicopters also typically use turbine engines to power the rotor. Turbines provide more power for less weight than piston engines, and are better suited to small-to-medium size aircraft or larger, slow-flying types. Some turboprop designs (see below) mount the propeller directly on an engine turbine shaft, and are called [[propfan]]s.

Since the 1940s, propellers and propfans with swept tips or curved &quot;scimitar-shaped&quot; blades have been studied for use in high-speed applications so as to delay the onset of shockwaves, in similar manner to wing sweepback, where the blade tips approach the speed of sound. The [[Airbus A400M]] turboprop transport aircraft is expected to provide the first production example: note that it is not a propfan because the propellers are not mounted direct on the engine shaft but are driven through reduction gearing.

Other less common power sources include:
*Electric motors, often linked to solar panels to create a [[Electric aircraft|solar-powered aircraft]].
*Rubber bands, wound many times to store energy, are mostly used for flying models.

====Jet====
{{Main|Jet aircraft}}

[[Airbreathing jet engine]]s provide thrust by taking in air, burning it with fuel in a [[combustion chamber]], and accelerating the exhaust rearwards so that it ejects at high speed. The reaction against this acceleration provides the engine thrust.

[[File:Ba b777-200 g-ymmd arp.jpg|thumb|A [[jet engine|jet-engined]] [[Boeing 777]] taking off]]

Jet engines can provide much higher thrust than propellers, and are naturally efficient at higher altitudes, being able to operate above {{convert|40000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. They are also much more fuel-efficient at normal flight speeds than [[rocket]]s. Consequently, nearly all high-speed and high-altitude aircraft use jet engines.

The early [[turbojet]] and modern [[turbofan]] use a spinning turbine to create airflow for takeoff and to provide thrust. Many, mostly in military aviation, use [[afterburners]] which inject extra fuel into the exhaust.

Use of a turbine is not absolutely necessary: other designs include the crude [[pulse jet engine|pulse jet]], high-speed [[ramjet]] and the still-experimental supersonic-combustion ramjet or [[scramjet]]. These designs require an existing airflow to work and cannot work when stationary, so they must be launched by a catapult or rocket booster, or dropped from a mother ship.

The bypass turbofan engines of the [[SR-71 Blackbird|Lockheed SR-71]] were a hybrid design – the aircraft took off and landed in jet turbine configuration, and for high-speed flight the afterburner was lit and the turbine bypassed, to create a ramjet.

The [[motorjet]] was a very early design which used a piston engine in place of the combustion chamber, similar to a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] piston engine except that the thrust is derived from the turbine instead of the crankshaft. It was soon superseded by the turbojet and remained a curiosity.

====Helicopters====
[[File:IA Dhruv Berlin-08.jpg|thumb|[[HAL Dhruv]], a multi-role [[utility helicopter]].]]
{{Main|Helicopter}}

The rotor of a helicopter, may, like a propeller, be powered by a variety of methods such as an internal-combustion engine or jet turbine. Tip jets, fed by gases passing along hollow rotor blades from a centrally mounted engine, have been experimented with. Attempts have even been made to mount engines directly on the rotor tips.

Helicopters obtain forward propulsion by angling the rotor disc so that a proportion of its lift is directed forwards to provide thrust.

====Other methods of propulsion====
*''[[Rocket-powered aircraft]]'' have occasionally been experimented with, and the [[Messerschmitt Me 163|Messerschmitt ''Komet'']] fighter even saw action in the Second World War. Since then they have been restricted to rather specialised niches, such as the [[Bell X-1]] which broke the sound barrier or the [[North American X-15]] which traveled up into space where no oxygen is available for combustion (rockets carry their own oxidant). Rockets have more often been used as a supplement to the main powerplant, typically to assist takeoff of heavily loaded aircraft, but also in a few experimental designs such as the [[Saunders-Roe SR.53]] to provide a high-speed dash capability.
*The flapping-wing ''[[ornithopter]]'' is a category of its own. These designs may have potential, but no practical device has been created beyond research prototypes, simple toys, and a [[Ornithopter#Recent developments|model hawk]] used to freeze prey into stillness so that it can be captured.

==General construction==
===Airframe===
{{main|Airframe}}
[[File:Merlin Airframe Material.jpg|thumb|Airframe diagram for a [[AgustaWestland AW101]] [[helicopter]]]]
The '''airframe''' of an aircraft is its mechanical structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author =Ed Rouen | title=Airplane Names | publisher=San Diego Aerospace Museum | year=2005 | url=http://www.marchfield.org/rouen01.html }} Names and dates of more than 2,800 aircraft models produced since 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; which is typically considered to exclude the [[Air propulsion|propulsion system]]. [[Reliable system design|Airframe design]] is a field of [[engineering]] that combines [[aerodynamics]], [[Materials science|materials technology]] and [[manufacturing]] methods to achieve balances of performance, [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] and cost.

===Undercarriage===
{{main|Undercarriage}}
The '''undercarriage''' or '''landing gear''' in [[aviation]], is the structure that supports an aircraft on the ground and allows it to [[taxiing|taxi]], takeoff and land. Typically wheels are used, but skids, floats or a combination of these and other elements can be deployed, depending on the surface.

===Fuselage===
{{main|fuselage}}
[[File:737-700f.gif|thumb|250px|Fuselage of a [[Boeing 737]] shown in brown]]
The  '''fuselage''' (from the [[French language|French]] ''fuselé'' &quot;spindle-shaped&quot;) is an aircraft's main body section that holds crew and passengers or [[cargo]].  In single-engine aircraft it will usually contain an engine, although in some [[amphibious aircraft]] the single engine is mounted on a [[hardpoint|pylon]] attached to the fuselage which in turn is used as a floating [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]].  The fuselage also serves to position control and stabilization surfaces in specific relationships to lifting surfaces, required for aircraft stability and maneuverability.

===Wing configuration===
{{main|Wing configuration}}
Many different styles and arrangements of wings have and are used on heavier-than-air aircraft, and some lighter than air aircraft also have wings. The common wing configuration types have included [[monoplane]]s which has one wing each side, [[biplane]] which have 4 wings.

Wings also vary greatly in '''planform''' which is their shape viewed from above. Wings can be swept backwards or be delta wings and can have many other shapes.

===Aircraft engine===
{{main|aircraft engine}}
An '''aircraft engine''' is a power source for an aircraft. Aircraft engines are almost always either lightweight piston engines or [[gas turbine]]s. Powered aircraft have one or more engines.

===Propellant tanks===
[[Propellant]] (a chemical carried on board that is used to power the aircraft's flight), is usually a fuel and is kept in tanks around the vehicle. Most aircraft store the fuel predominantly in the wings, but may have additional [[fuel tank]]s elsewhere.

===Flight control surfaces===
{{main|flight control surfaces}}
Aircraft '''flight control surfaces''' allow a pilot to adjust and control the aircraft's flight [[Aircraft attitude|attitude]].

Development of an effective set of flight controls was a critical advance in the development of aircraft. Early efforts at fixed-wing aircraft design succeeded in generating sufficient lift to get the aircraft off the ground, but once aloft, the aircraft proved uncontrollable, often with disastrous results. The development of effective flight controls is what allowed stable flight.

===Empennage===

'''Empennage''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|ɑː|m|p|ɨ|ˈ|n|ɑː|ʒ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|m|p|ɨ|n|ɪ|dʒ}}) is an [[aviation]] term used to describe the [[tail]] section of an aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crane&quot;&gt;Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition'', page 194.

[[File:hornet moth dh87b g-adne arp.jpg|thumb|1936 [[De Havilland Hornet Moth]] cockpit]]
A '''cockpit''' or '''flight deck''' is the area, usually near the front of an aircraft, from which a pilot controls the aircraft. Most modern cockpits are enclosed, except on some small aircraft, and cockpits on large airliners are also physically separated from the cabin. From the cockpit an aircraft is controlled on the ground and in the air.

Cockpit as a term for the pilot's compartment in an aircraft first appeared in 1914. From about 1935 cockpit also came to be used informally to refer to the driver's seat of a [[automobile|car]], especially a high performance one, and this is official terminology in [[Formula One]].  The term is most likely related to the [[cockpit (sailing)|sailing term]] for the [[coxswain]]'s station in a [[Royal Navy]] ship, and later the location of the ship's rudder controls.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The cockpit of an aircraft contains [[flight instruments]] on an instrument panel, and the controls which enable the pilot to fly the aircraft. In most airliners, a door separates the cockpit from the passenger compartment. After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]], all major [[airline]]s fortified the cockpit against access by [[Aircraft hijacking|hijackers]]. 

On an airliner, the cockpit is usually referred to as the flight deck. This term derives from its use by the RAF for the separate, upper platform where the pilot and co-pilot sat in large [[flying boats]].

===Cabin===
{{main|Aircraft cabin}}
An '''aircraft cabin''' is the section of an aircraft in which any passengers travel, often just called the cabin. At cruising altitudes, if the surrounding atmosphere is too thin to breathe without an [[oxygen mask]], [[cabin pressurization]] adapts the cabin to [[atmospheric pressure]]s.

==Performance of aircraft==
===Flight envelope===
{{main|Flight envelope}}
In aerodynamics, the '''flight envelope''' or '''performance envelope''' of an aircraft refers to the capabilities of a design in terms of [[airspeed]] and [[Load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]] or altitude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?type=simple;c=ecfr;cc=ecfr;sid=a8f38006e777ba46ba8000f7c2fe6641;region=DIV1;q1=23.335;rgn=div8;view=text;idno=14;node=14%3A1.0.1.3.10.3.70.8 §23.333 Flight envelope]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access.gpo.gov/ecfr/graphics/pdfs/ec28se91.001.pdf Flight envelope - diagram]&lt;/ref&gt; The term is somewhat loosely applied, and can also refer to other measurements such as maneuverability. When a plane is pushed, for instance by diving it at high speeds, it is said to be flown &quot;outside the envelope&quot;, something considered rather dangerous.

Flight envelope is one of a number of related terms that are all used in a similar fashion. It is perhaps the most common term because it is the oldest, first being used in the early days of test flying. It is closely related to more modern terms known as '''extra power''' and a '''doghouse plot''' which are different ways of describing a flight envelope.

===Aircraft range===
{{main|range (aircraft)}}
[[File:Boeing 777-200LR banking over mountain.jpg|thumb|The [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200LR]] is the longest-range commercial airliner, capable of flights of more than halfway around the world.]]
The maximal total '''range''' is the distance an aircraft can fly between [[takeoff]] and [[landing]], as limited by fuel capacity in powered aircraft, or cross-country speed and environmental conditions in unpowered aircraft. 

'''Ferry range''' means the maximum range the aircraft can fly. This usually means maximum [[fuel]] load, optionally with extra fuel tanks and minimum equipment. It refers to transport of aircraft for use on remote location.

'''Combat range''' is the maximum range the aircraft can fly when carrying ordnance.

'''[[Combat radius]]''' is a related measure based on the maximum distance a warplane can travel from its base of operations, accomplish some objective, and return to its original airfield with minimal reserves.

The fuel time limit for powered aircraft is fixed by the fuel load and rate of consumption. When all fuel is consumed, the engines stop and the aircraft will lose its propulsion. For unpowered aircraft, the maximum flight time is variable, limited by available daylight hours, weather conditions, and pilot endurance.

The range can be seen as the cross-country ground speed multiplied by the maximum time in the air. The range equation will derived in this article for propeller and jet aircraft.

==Aircraft flight dynamics==
{{main|Flight dynamics (aircraft)}}
'''Flight dynamics''' is the science of air vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the [[angles of rotation]] in three [[dimensions]] about the vehicle's  [[center of mass]], known as ''pitch'', ''roll'' and ''yaw'' (quite different from their use as [[Tait-Bryan angles]]).

[[Aerospace engineer]]s develop [[control system]]s for a vehicle's orientation (attitude) about its [[center of mass]]. The control systems include actuators, which exert forces in various directions, and generate rotational forces or [[moment (physics)|moment]]s about the [[aerodynamic center]] of the aircraft, and thus rotate the aircraft in pitch, roll, or yaw.  For example, a [[pitching moment]] is a vertical force applied at a distance forward or aft from the aerodynamic center of the aircraft, causing the aircraft to pitch up or down.

Roll, pitch and yaw refer to rotations about the respective axes starting from a defined equilibrium state.  The equilibrium roll angle is known as wings level or zero bank angle, equivalent to a level [[Heeling (sailing)|heeling]] angle on a ship. Yaw is known as &quot;heading&quot;.  The equilibrium [[pitch angle (engineering)|pitch angle]] in submarine and airship parlance is known as &quot;trim&quot;, but in aircraft, this usually refers to [[angle of attack]], rather than orientation.  However, common usage ignores this distinction between equilibrium and dynamic cases.

The most common aeronautical convention defines the roll as acting about the longitudinal axis, positive with the starboard (right) wing down.  The yaw is about the vertical body axis, positive with the nose to starboard. Pitch is about an axis perpendicular to the longitudinal plane of symmetry, positive nose up.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

A [[fixed-wing aircraft]] increases or decreases the lift generated by the wings when it pitches nose up or down by increasing or decreasing the [[angle of attack]] (AOA). The roll angle is also known as bank angle on a fixed-wing aircraft, which usually &quot;banks&quot; to change the horizontal direction of flight. An aircraft is usually streamlined from nose to tail to reduce [[Drag (physics)|drag]] making it typically advantageous to keep the sideslip angle near zero, though there are instances when an aircraft may be deliberately &quot;sideslipped&quot; for example a [[Slip (aerodynamic)|slip]] in a fixed-wing aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Areas of use==
The major distinction in aircraft types is between [[military aircraft]], which includes not just combat types but many types of supporting aircraft, and [[civil aviation|civil aircraft]], which include all non-military types.
[[File:Gripen 3.jpg|thumb|[[Saab Gripen]], a [[Sweden|Swedish]] multi-role [[fighter aircraft]].]]

===Military===
{{Main|Military aircraft}}
A '''military aircraft''' is any [[Fixed-wing aircraft|fixed-wing]] or [[rotorcraft|rotary-wing]] aircraft that is operated by a legal or insurrectionary armed service of any type.&lt;ref name=&quot;gunston&quot; /&gt; Military aircraft can be either combat or non-combat:
* Combat aircraft are aircraft designed to destroy enemy equipment using its own armament.&lt;ref name=&quot;gunston&quot; /&gt;
* Non-Combat aircraft are aircraft not designed for combat as their primary function, but may carry weapons for self-defense. Mainly operating in support roles.

Combat aircraft divide broadly into [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] and [[bomber]]s, with several in-between types such as [[fighter-bomber]]s and [[ground-attack aircraft]] (including [[attack helicopter]]s).

Other supporting roles are carried out by specialist patrol, search and rescue, reconnaissance, observation, transport, training and [[Aerial refueling|tanker]] aircraft among others.

Many civil aircraft, both fixed-wing and rotary, have been produced in separate models for military use, such as the civil [[Douglas DC-3]] airliner, which became the military [[C-47 Skytrain|C-47]]/C-53/R4D transport in the U.S. military and the &quot;Dakota&quot; in the UK and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. Even the small fabric-covered two-seater [[Piper J-3|Piper J3 Cub]] had a military version, the L-4 liaison, observation and trainer aircraft. [[Military glider|Glider]]s and [[balloon]]s have also been used as military aircraft; for example, balloons were used for observation during the [[American Civil War]] and [[World War I]], and [[military glider]]s were used during [[World War II]] to land troops.

===Civil===
{{main|Civil aviation}}
Civil aircraft divide into ''commercial'' and ''general'' types, however there are some overlaps.

====Commercial====
{{main|Commercial aviation}}
Commercial aircraft include types designed for scheduled and charter airline flights, carrying both passengers and [[cargo]]. The larger passenger-carrying types are often referred to as airliners, the largest of which are [[wide-body aircraft]].  Some of the smaller types are also used in [[general aviation]], and some of the larger types are used as [[Air transports of heads of state and government|VIP aircraft]].

====General aviation====
{{main|General aviation}}
General aviation is a catch-all covering other kinds of private and commercial use, and involving a wide range of aircraft types such as [[Business jet|business jets (bizjets)]], [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainers]], [[Homebuilt aircraft|homebuilt]], [[Aerobatics|aerobatic types]], [[Air racing|racers]], [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders]], [[warbird]]s, [[Aerial firefighting|firefighters]], [[mEDEVAC|medical transports]], and [[cargo aircraft|cargo]] transports, to name a few. The vast majority of aircraft today are general aviation types.

Within general aviation, there is a further distinction between [[private aviation]] (where the pilot is not paid for time or expenses) and commercial aviation (where the pilot is paid by a client or employer). The aircraft used in private aviation are usually light passenger, business, or recreational types, and are usually owned or rented by the pilot. The same types may also be used for a wide range of commercial tasks, such as flight training, pipeline surveying, passenger and freight transport, policing, crop dusting, and medical evacuations.  However the larger, more complex aircraft are more likely to be found in the commercial sector.

For example, piston-powered propeller aircraft (single-engine or twin-engine) are common for both private and commercial general aviation, but for aircraft such as turboprops like the [[Beechcraft King Air]] and helicopters like the [[Bell 206|Bell JetRanger]], there are fewer private owners than commercial owners. Conventional business jets are most often flown by paid pilots, whereas the new generation of smaller jets are being produced for private pilots.

===Experimental===
{{main|Experimental aircraft}}
Experimental aircraft are one-off specials, built to explore some aspect of aircraft design and with no other useful purpose. The [[Bell X-1]] rocket plane, which first broke the sound barrier in level flight, is a famous example.

Hatfield (2003). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=mtxMN5NdmCsC&amp;pg=RA1-PA91&amp;lpg=RA1-PA91&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Heartland heroes: remembering World War II.]''&quot;. p.91.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The formal designation of &quot;experimental aircraft&quot; also includes other types which are &quot;not certified for commercial applications&quot;, including one-off modifications of existing aircraft such as the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft|modified Boeing 747]] which NASA uses to ferry the space shuttle from landing site to launch site, and aircraft [[Homebuilt aircraft|homebuilt]] by amateurs for their own personal use.

===Model===
{{main|Model aircraft}}
A model aircraft is a small unmanned type made to fly for fun, for static display, for aerodynamic research (cf [[Reynolds number]]) or for other purposes. A [[scale model]] is a replica of some larger design.

'''Alfred Bernhard Nobel''' ({{Pronunciation|sv-Alfred_Nobel.ogg}}) (21 October 1833 – 10 December 1896) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] chemist, engineer, innovator, and armaments manufacturer.  He is the [[inventor]] of [[dynamite]].  Nobel also owned [[Bofors]], which he had redirected from its previous role as primarily an iron and steel producer to a major manufacturer of cannon and other armaments. Nobel held 355 different patents, [[dynamite]] being the most famous. In his last will, he used his enormous fortune to institute the [[Nobel Prize]]s. The [[synthetic element]] [[nobelium]] was named after him.

==Personal background==
{{refimprove|date=November 2010}}
Alfred Nobel was the third son of [[Immanuel Nobel]] (1801–1872) and Andriette Ahlsell Nobel (1805–1889). Born in [[Stockholm]] on 21 October 1833, he went with his family to [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1842, where his father (who had invented modern [[plywood]]) started a &quot;[[naval mine|torpedo]]&quot; works. Alfred studied chemistry with Professor [[Nikolay Nikolaevich Zinin]]. When Alfred was 18, he went to the United States to study chemistry for four years and worked for a short period under [[John Ericsson]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlisle, Rodney (2004). [http://books.google.com/books?id=pDbQVE3IdTcC&amp;pg=PA256 ''Scientific American Inventions and Discoveries''], p. 256. John Wiley &amp; Songs, Inc., New Jersey. ISBN 0-471-24410-4.&lt;/ref&gt; who designed the American Civil War ironclad [[USS Monitor]].  In 1859, the factory was left to the care of the second son, [[Ludvig Nobel]] (1831–1888), who greatly improved the business. Alfred, returning to Sweden with his father after the bankruptcy of their family business, devoted himself to the study of [[explosives]], and especially to the safe manufacture and use of [[nitroglycerine]] (discovered in 1847 by [[Ascanio Sobrero]], one of his fellow students under [[Théophile-Jules Pelouze]] at the [[University of Torino]]). A big explosion occurred on the 3 September 1864 at their factory in [[Heleneborg]] in Stockholm, killing five people.  Among them was Alfred's younger brother [[Emil Oskar Nobel|Emil]].

Though Nobel remained unmarried, his biographers note that he had at least three loves. Nobel's first love was in Russia with a girl named Alexandra, who rejected his proposal. In 1876 [[Austria|Austro]]-[[Bohemia]]n [[Freifrau|Countess]] [[Bertha von Suttner|Bertha Kinsky]] became Alfred Nobel's secretary. But after only a brief stay she left him to marry her previous lover, Baron Arthur Gundaccar von Suttner. Though her personal contact with Alfred Nobel had been brief, she corresponded with him until his death in 1896, and it is believed that she was a major influence in his decision to include a peace prize among those prizes provided in his will. Bertha von Suttner was awarded the 1905 Nobel Peace prize, 'for her sincere peace activities'.

Nobel's third and long-lasting love was with a flower girl named Sofie Hess from Vienna. This liaison lasted for 18 years and in many of the exchanged letters, Nobel addressed his love as 'Madame Sofie Nobel'. After his death, according to his biographers – Evlanoff and Fluor, and Fant – Nobel's letters were locked within the Nobel Institute in Stockholm and became the best-kept secret of the time. They were released only in 1955, to be included with the biographical data of Nobel.

The foundations of the Nobel Prize were laid in 1895 when Alfred Nobel wrote his last will, leaving much of his wealth for its establishment. Since 1901, the prize has honored men and women for outstanding achievements in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and for work in peace.

Sri Kantha has suggested that 'the one personal trait of Nobel that helped him to sharpen his creativity include his talent for information access, via his multi-lingual skills. Despite the lack of formal secondary and tertiary level education, Nobel gained proficiency in six languages: Swedish, French, Russian, English, German and Italian. He also developed literary skills to write poetry in English.' His ''[[Nemesis (play)|Nemesis]]'', a prose tragedy in four acts about [[Beatrice Cenci]], partly inspired by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s ''[[The Cenci]]'', was printed while he was dying. The entire stock except for three copies was destroyed immediately after his death, being regarded as scandalous and blasphemous. The first surviving edition (bilingual Swedish–[[Esperanto]]) was published in Sweden in 2003. The play has been translated to [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] via the Esperanto version. In 2010 it was published in Russia as another bilingual ([[Russian language|Russian]]–Esperanto) edition.

Nobel was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1884, the same institution that would later select laureates for two of the Nobel prizes, and he received an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Uppsala University]] in 1893.

Alfred Nobel is buried in [[Norra begravningsplatsen]] in [[Stockholm]].

==Dynamite, ballistite, and gelignite==
{{Main|Dynamite|Gelignite|Ballistite}}

Nobel found that when [[nitroglycerin]] was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like ''kieselguhr'' (diatomaceous earth) it became safer and more convenient to handle, and this mixture he patented in 1867 as 'dynamite'. Nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year, at a quarry in Redhill, Surrey, England. In order to help reestablish his name and improve the image of his business from the earlier controversies associated with the dangerous explosives, Nobel had also considered naming the highly powerful substance &quot;Nobel's Safety Powder&quot;, but settled with Dynamite instead, referring to the Greek word for 'power'.

Nobel later on combined nitroglycerin with various nitrocellulose compounds, similar to collodion, but settled on a more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive, and obtained a transparent, jelly-like substance, which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite. 'Gelignite', or blasting gelatin, as it was named, was patented in 1876; and was followed by a host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of potassium nitrate and various other substances. Gelignite was more stable, transportable and conveniently formed to fit into bored holes, like those used in drilling and mining, than the previously used compounds and was adopted as the standard technology for mining in the Age of Engineering bringing Nobel a great amount of financial success, though at a significant cost to his health. An off-shoot of this research resulted in Nobel's invention of [[ballistite]], the precuser of many modern smokeless powder explosives and still used as a rocket propellant.

{{Main|Nobel Prize}}
In 1888 Alfred's brother Ludvig died while visiting [[Cannes]] and a French newspaper erroneously published Alfred's [[List of premature obituaries|obituary]].{{r|Brit1}} It condemned him for his invention of dynamite and is said to have brought about his decision to leave a better legacy after his death.{{r|Brit1}}{{r|HistC}} The obituary stated ''{{lang|fr|Le marchand de la mort est mort}}'' (&quot;The merchant of death is dead&quot;){{r|Brit1}} and went on to say, &quot;Dr. Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday.&quot;{{r|Nobel}} Alfred was disappointed with what he read and concerned with how he would be remembered. On 27 November 1895, at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris, Nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the [[Nobel Prize]]s, to be awarded annually without distinction of nationality. He died of a [[stroke]] on 10 December 1896 at [[Sanremo]], Italy. After taxes and bequests to individuals, Nobel's will gave 31,225,000 [[Swedish kronor]] (equivalent to about 1.8 billion kronor or 250 million US dollars in 2008) to fund the prizes.{{r|Fant 1991 327}}

The first three of these prizes are awarded for eminence [[Nobel Prize in Physics|in physical science]], [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|in chemistry]] and [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|in medical science or physiology]]; the fourth is [[Nobel Prize for Literature|for literary work]] &quot;in an ideal direction&quot; and [[Nobel Peace Prize|the fifth prize]] is to be given to the person or society that renders the greatest service to the cause of international [[wikt:fraternity|fraternity]], in the suppression or reduction of standing armies, or in the establishment or furtherance of [[peace]] congresses. There is no prize awarded for mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/science/nobel.asp |title=No Nobel Prize for Math |publisher=snopes.com |accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but see [[Abel Prize]].

The Formulation about the literary prize, &quot;in an ideal direction&quot; (''{{lang|sv|i idealisk riktning}}'' in Swedish), is cryptic and has caused much confusion. For many years, the Swedish Academy interpreted &quot;ideal&quot; as &quot;idealistic&quot; (''{{lang|sv|idealistisk}}'') and used it as a reason not to give the prize to important but less [[romanticism|Romantic]] authors, such as [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. This interpretation has since been revised, and the prize has been awarded to, for example, [[Dario Fo]] and [[José Saramago]], who definitely do not belong to the camp of literary idealism.{{Or|date=October 2009}}

There was also quite a lot of room for interpretation by the bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes, given that he had not consulted them before making the will. In his one-page testament, he stipulated that the money go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry. He had opened the door to technological awards, but had not left instructions on how to deal with the distinction between science and technology. Since the deciding bodies he had chosen were more concerned with the former, it is not surprising that the prizes went to scientists and not to engineers, technicians or other inventors.

In 2001, Alfred Nobel's great-grandnephew, Peter Nobel (b. 1931), asked the Bank of Sweden to differentiate its award to economists given &quot;in Alfred Nobel's memory&quot; from the five other awards. This has caused much controversy whether the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] is actually a &quot;Nobel Prize&quot; / &quot;Peace Prize&quot;.

&lt;!--The question of nationality is a contentious one in that Alexander Graham Bell has been variously claimed as Scottish, British, American and Canadian. Bell made a number of inventions as a British citizen, notably the telephone in 1876; however he did not become an American citizen until 1882. Therefore if nationality is to be described specifically ... Alexander Graham Bell—British inventor of the telephone, died as an American citizen in Canada. The wording in the lead paragraph was carefully crafted after input from many editors in order to accommodate the many diverse claims. It is recognized that in the last years of his life, Bell had American citizenship although he predominately lived in Canada at a summer residence. Please discuss any potentially divisive submissions prior to editing this section. A newer edit is presently being considered that will focus on his life's work and provide details on his nationality and citizenship in later sections. Please see the talk page to provide input on this change.--&gt;

'''Alexander Graham Bell''' (March 3, 1847&amp;nbsp;–  August 2, 1922) was an eminent [[scientist]], [[Innovation|inventor]], [[engineer]] and [[innovator]] who is credited with inventing the first practical [[telephone]].

Bell's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on [[elocution]] and [[speech]], and both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing Bell's life's work.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt; His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first [[United States patent law|U.S. patent]] for the telephone in 1876.{{#tag:ref|Quote: &quot;He thought he could harness the new [[Electronics|electronic technology]] by creating a machine with a transmitter and receiver that would send sounds telegraphically to help people hear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Black 1997, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; |group=N}}  In retrospect, Bell considered his most famous invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;&gt;MacLeod 1999, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other inventions marked Bell's later life, including groundbreaking work in [[Free-space optical communication|optical telecommunications]], [[hydrofoil]]s and [[aeronautics]]. In 1888, Alexander Graham Bell became one of the founding members of the [[National Geographic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/ &quot;National Geographic Mission.&quot;] ''nationalgeographic.com.'' Retrieved: July 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 2000, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==
Alexander Bell was born in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland on March 3, 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie 1975, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The family home was at 16 South Charlotte Street, and now has a commemorative marker at the doorstep, marking it as Alexander Graham Bell's birthplace. He had two brothers: Melville James Bell (1845–1870) and Edward Charles Bell (1848–1867). Both of his brothers died of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/bellhtml/belltime.html &quot;Time Line of Alexander Graham Bell.&quot;] ''memory.loc.goiv.'' Retrieved: July 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Professor [[Alexander Melville Bell]], and his mother was Eliza Grace (née Symonds).{{#tag:ref|&quot;Alexander M. Bell Dead. Father of Prof. A.G. Bell Developed [[Sign language|Sign Language]] for Mutes.&quot; ''[[New York Times]]'' Tuesday, August 8, 1905.|group=N}} Although he was born &quot;Alexander&quot;, at age 10, he made a plea to his father to have a [[middle name]] like his two brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fi.edu/case_files/bell/agb.html &quot;Call me Alexander Graham Bell.&quot;] ''fi.edu.'' Retrieved: July 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| Bell typically signed his name in full on his correspondence.|group=N}} For his 11th birthday, his father acquiesced and allowed him to adopt the middle name &quot;Graham&quot;, chosen out of admiration for Alexander Graham, a Canadian being treated by his father and boarder who had become a family friend.&lt;ref&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; To close relatives and friends he remained &quot;Aleck&quot; which his father continued to call him into later life.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First invention ===
As a child,  young Alexander displayed a natural curiosity about his world, resulting in gathering [[botany|botanical]] specimens as well as [[experiment]]ing even at an early age. His [[Friendship|best friend]] was Ben Herdman, a neighbor whose family operated a flour [[Gristmill|mill]], the scene of many forays. Young Aleck asked what needed to be done at the  mill. He was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12, Bell built a  homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes, creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce p. 16.&quot;&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In return, John Herdman gave both boys the run of a small workshop within which to &quot;invent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce p. 16.&quot;/&gt;

From his early years, Bell showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art, poetry and music that was encouraged by his mother. With no formal training, he mastered the [[piano]] and became the family's pianist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray p. 8&quot;&gt;Gray 2006, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being normally quiet and introspective, he reveled in mimicry and &quot;voice tricks&quot; akin to [[ventriloquism]] that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray p. 8&quot;/&gt; Bell was also deeply affected by his mother's gradual deafness, (she began to lose her hearing when he was 12) and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray p. 9&quot;&gt;Gray 2006, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly into his mother's forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackay p.25&quot;&gt;Mackay 1997, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell's preoccupation with his mother's deafness led him to study [[acoustics]].

His family was long associated with the teaching of [[elocution]]: his grandfather, Alexander Bell, in London, his uncle in [[Dublin]], and his father, in Edinburgh, were all elocutionists. His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his ''The Standard Elocutionist'' (1860),&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray p. 8&quot;/&gt; which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868. ''The Standard Elocutionist'' appeared in 168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone. In this treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct [[deaf-mute]]s (as they were then known) to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning. Aleck's father taught him and his brothers not only to write [[Visible Speech]] but also to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petrie p. 7&quot;&gt;Petrie 1975, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Aleck became so proficient that he became a part of his father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities in deciphering [[Latin]], [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] and even [[Sanskrit]] symbols.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petrie p. 7&quot;/&gt;

=== Education ===
As a young child, Bell, like his brothers, received his early schooling at home from his father. At an early age, however, he was enrolled at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]], Edinburgh, Scotland, which he left at age 15, completing only the first four forms.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay 1997, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; His school record was undistinguished, marked by [[absenteeism]] and lacklustre grades. His main interest remained in the sciences, especially biology, while he treated other school subjects with indifference, to the dismay of his demanding father.&lt;ref&gt;Gray 2006, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon leaving school, Bell travelled to London to live with his grandfather, Alexander Bell. During the year he spent with his grandfather, a love of learning was born, with long hours spent in serious discussion and study. The elder Bell took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction, the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself.&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; At age 16, Bell secured a position as a &quot;pupil-teacher&quot; of [[elocution]] and music, in Weston House Academy, at [[Elgin, Moray]], Scotland. Although he was enrolled as a student in Latin and Greek, he instructed classes himself in return for board and £10 per session.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he attended the [[University of Edinburgh]]; joining his older brother Melville who had enrolled there the previous year.

=== First experiments with sound ===
Bell's father encouraged Aleck's interest in speech and, in 1863, took his sons to see a unique [[automaton]], developed by Sir [[Charles Wheatstone]] based on the earlier work of [[Wolfgang von Kempelen|Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 25&quot;&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rudimentary &quot;mechanical man&quot; simulated a [[human voice]]. Aleck was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of von Kempelen's book, published in German, and had laboriously translated it, he and his older brother Melville built their own automaton head. Their father, highly interested in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a &quot;big prize&quot; if they were successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 25&quot;/&gt; While his brother constructed the [[throat]] and [[larynx]], Aleck tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull. His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could &quot;speak&quot;, albeit only a few words.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 25&quot;/&gt; The boys would carefully adjust the &quot;lips&quot; and when a [[bellows]] forced air through the [[Vertebrate trachea|windpipe]], a very recognizable &quot;Mama&quot; ensued, to the delight of neighbors who came to see the Bell invention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petrie pp. 7–9&quot;&gt;Petrie 1975, pp. 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intrigued by the results of the automaton, Bell continued to experiment with a live subject, the family's [[Skye Terrier]], &quot;Trouve&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie 1975, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; After he taught it to growl continuously, Aleck would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and [[Vocal folds|vocal cords]] to produce a crude-sounding &quot;Ow ah oo ga ma ma.&quot; With little convincing, visitors believed his dog could articulate &quot;How are you grandma?&quot; More indicative of his playful nature, his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a &quot;talking dog.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 30.&quot; &quot;&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of [[sound]], using [[tuning fork]]s to explore [[resonance]]. At the age of 19, he wrote a report on his work and sent it to [[philologist]] [[Alexander John Ellis|Alexander Ellis]], a colleague of his father (who would later be portrayed as Professor Henry Higgins in ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 30.&quot; &quot;&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in Germany. Dismayed to find that groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork &quot;[[Machine|contraption]]&quot;, he pored over the German scientist's book, ''Sensations of Tone''. Working from his own errant mistranslation of the original German edition, Aleck fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, reporting: ''&quot;Without knowing much about the subject, it seemed to me that if [[vowel]] sounds could be produced by [[electricity|electrical]] means so could [[consonant]]s, so could [[speech|articulate speech]]&quot;'', and also later remarking: ''&quot;I thought that Helmhotz had done it ... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity. It was a valuable blunder ... If I had been able to  read German in those days, I might never have commenced my experiments!&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;MacKenzie2008&quot;&gt;MacKenzie 2003, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Family tragedy ===
In 1865, when the Bell family moved to London,&lt;ref&gt;Micklos 2006, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell returned to Weston House as an assistant master and, in his spare hours, continued experiments on sound using a minimum of [[laboratory equipment]]. Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a [[telegraph]] wire from his room in Somerset College to that of a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout late 1867, his health faltered mainly through exhaustion. His younger brother, Edward &quot;Ted,&quot; was similarly bed-ridden, suffering from [[tuberculosis]]. While Bell recovered (by then referring to himself in correspondence as &quot;A.G. Bell&quot;) and served the next year as an instructor at [[Somerset College]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Somerset]], England, his brother's condition deteriorated. Edward would never recover. Upon his brother's death, Bell returned home in 1867. His older brother Melville had married and moved out. With aspirations to obtain a degree at the [[University College London]], Bell considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations, devoting his spare time at his family's residence to studying.

Helping his father in Visible Speech demonstrations and lectures brought Bell to Susanna E. Hull's [[private school]] for the deaf in [[South Kensington]], London. His first two pupils were &quot;deaf mute&quot; girls who made remarkable progress under his tutelage. While his older brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own elocution school, applying for a patent on an invention, and starting a family, Bell continued as a teacher. However, in May 1870, Melville died from complications due to tuberculosis, causing a family crisis. His father had also suffered a debilitating illness earlier in life and had been restored to health by a convalescence in  [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. Bell's parents embarked upon a long-planned move when they realized that their remaining son was also sickly. Acting decisively, Alexander Melville Bell asked Bell to arrange for the sale of all the family property,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The family pet was given to his brother's family.|group=N}} conclude all of his brother's affairs (Bell took over his last student, curing a pronounced lisp),&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; and join his father and mother in setting out for the &quot;[[New World]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref2&quot;&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Reluctantly, Bell also had to conclude a relationship with Marie Eccleston, who, he had surmised, was not prepared to leave England with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref2&quot;/&gt;

== Canada ==
In 1870, at age 23, Bell, his brother's widow, Caroline (Margaret Ottaway),&lt;ref&gt;Mackay 1997, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and his parents travelled on the SS ''Nestorian'' to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie 1975, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; After landing at [[Quebec City]], the Bells boarded a train to [[Montreal]] and later  to [[Paris, Ontario]], to stay with the Reverend Thomas Henderson, a family friend. After a brief stay with the Hendersons, the Bell family purchased a farm of {{convert|10.5|acre|m2}} at Tutelo Heights (now called Tutela Heights), near [[Brantford]], [[Ontario]]. The property consisted of an orchard, large farm house, stable, pigsty, hen-house and a [[carriage house]], which bordered the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackay 1997, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| The estate is today known as the &quot;Bell Homestead&quot;.|group=N}}

At the homestead, Bell set up his own workshop in the converted carriage house&lt;ref name = &quot;Wing p. 10&quot;/&gt; near to what he called his &quot;dreaming place&quot;, a large hollow nestled in trees at the back of the property above the river.&lt;ref&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his frail condition upon arriving in Canada, Bell found the climate and environs to his liking, and rapidly improved.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay 1997, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| Bell would later write that he had come to Canada a &quot;dying man&quot;.|group=N}} He continued his interest in the study of the human voice and when he discovered the [[Six Nations 40, Ontario|Six Nations Reserve]] across the river at [[Onondaga]], he learned the [[Mohawk language]] and translated its unwritten vocabulary into Visible Speech symbols. For his work, Bell was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donned a [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] headdress and danced traditional dances.&lt;ref&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Bell was thrilled at his recognition by the Six Nations Reserve and throughout his life would launch into a Mohawk war dance when he was excited.|group=N}}

After setting up his workshop, Bell continued experiments based on Helmholtz's work with electricity and sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wing p. 10&quot;&gt;Wing 1980, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; He designed a [[piano]], which, by means of electricity, could transmit its music at a distance. Once the family was settled in, both Bell and his father made plans to establish a teaching practice and in 1871, he accompanied his father to Montreal, where Melville was offered a position to teach his System of Visible Speech.

Subsequently, his father was invited by Sarah Fuller, principal of the [[Horace Mann|Boston School for Deaf Mutes]] (which continues today as the public [[Horace Mann School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing|Horace Mann School for the Deaf]]),&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], United States, to introduce the Visible Speech System by providing training for Fuller's instructors, but he declined the post, in favor of his son. Traveling to Boston in April 1871, Bell proved successful in training the school's instructors.&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently asked to repeat the program at the [[American School for the Deaf|American Asylum for Deaf-mutes]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and the [[Clarke School for the Deaf]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]].

Returning home to Brantford after six months abroad, Bell continued his experiments with his &quot;harmonic telegraph&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Graham Bell' 1979, p. 8&quot;&gt;''Alexander Graham Bell'' 1979, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|In later years, Bell described the invention of the telephone and linked it to his &quot;dreaming place&quot;.|group=N}}  The basic concept behind his device was that messages could be sent through a single wire if each message was transmitted at a different pitch, but work on both the transmitter and receiver was needed.&lt;ref name = &quot;Groundwater p. 39&quot;/&gt; Unsure of his future, he first contemplated returning to London to complete his studies, but decided to return to Boston as a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Petrina 1975, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  His father helped him set up his private practice by contacting [[Gardiner Greene Hubbard]], the president of the Clarke School for the Deaf for a recommendation. Teaching his father's system, in October 1872 Alexander Bell opened his &quot;School of Vocal Physiology and Mechanics of Speech&quot; in Boston, which attracted a large number of deaf pupils with his first class numbering 30 students.&lt;ref&gt;Petrel 1975, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;  While he was working as a private tutor, one of his most famous pupils was [[Helen Keller]], who came to him as a young child unable to see, hear, or speak.  She was later to say that Bell dedicated his life to the penetration of that &quot;inhuman silence which separates and estranges.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Petrie 1975, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several influential people of the time, including Bell, viewed deafness as something that ought to be eradicated, and also believed that with resources and effort they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of [[sign language]], thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-Branson&quot;&gt;Miller and Branson 2002, pp. 30–31, 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt; However in several schools children were mistreated, for example by having their hands tied behind their backs so they could not communicate by signing —the only language they knew— and were therefore forced to attempt oral communication. Due to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language Bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing [[Deaf culture]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

== Continuing experimentation ==
In the following year, Bell became professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at the [[Boston University]] School of Oratory. During this period, he alternated between Boston and Brantford, spending summers in his Canadian home. At Boston University, Bell was &quot;swept up&quot; by the excitement engendered by the many scientists and inventors residing in the city. He continued his research in sound and endeavored to find a way to transmit [[Note|musical notes]] and articulate speech, but although absorbed by his experiments, he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation. While days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes, Bell began to stay awake late into the night, running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his [[boarding house]]. Keeping up &quot;[[Night owl (person)|night owl]]&quot; hours, he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment. Bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking cover.&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Worse still, his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 39&quot;&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Boston in fall 1873, Bell made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound.
[[File:1876 Bell Speaking into Telephone.jpg|thumb|left|Bell speaking into prototype model of the telephone]]
Deciding to give up his lucrative private Boston practice, Bell only retained two students, six-year old &quot;Georgie&quot; Sanders, deaf from birth and 15-year old [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard|Mabel Hubbard]]. Each pupil would serve to play an important role in the next developments. George's father, Thomas Sanders, a wealthy businessman, offered Bell a place to stay at nearby [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] with Georgie's grandmother, complete with a room to &quot;experiment&quot;. Although the offer was made by George's mother and followed the year-long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse had moved to quarters next to Bell's boarding house, it was clear that Mr. Sanders was backing the proposal. The arrangement was for teacher and student to continue their work together with free room and board thrown in.&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Mabel was a bright, attractive girl who was ten years his junior but became the object of Bell's affection.

Mabel's exact age when she became deaf would later play a part in the debate on the effectiveness of [[Manualism and oralism|manual versus oral education for deaf children]], as children who are older at the onset of deafness retain greater vocalization skills and are thus more successful in oral education programs. Some of the debate centred on whether Mabel had to relearn oral speech from scratch, or whether she never lost it.|group=N}} she had learned to [[Lip reading|read lips]] but her father, Gardiner Greene Hubbard, Bell's [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]] and personal friend, wanted her to work directly with her teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn 1990, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Telephone ==
&lt;!--The question of authorship or claims to the invention of the telephone is discussed in the sub-article Invention of the Telephone. Although there remain disputes between various parties that were eventually resolved in litigation, this still remains a contentious issue. Before introducing any further controversial issues related to the invention of the telephone, please discuss on the talk page.--&gt;

{{Main|Invention of the telephone}}

By 1874, Bell's initial work on the harmonic telegraph had entered a formative stage with progress it made both at his new Boston &quot;laboratory&quot; (a rented facility) as well as at his family home in Canada a big success.{{#tag:ref| Quote: &quot;Brantford is justified in calling herself 'The Telephone City' because the telephone originated there. It was invented in Brantford at Tutela Heights in the summer of 1874.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Graham Bell' 1979, p. 8&quot;/&gt;|group=N}}
While working that summer in Brantford, Bell experimented with a &quot;[[phonautograph]]&quot;, a pen-like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on [[smoked glass]] by tracing their vibrations. Bell thought it might be possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews 1999, pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulatory currents back into sound.  But he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews 1999, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of [[Western Union]] President William Orton, had become &quot;the nervous system of commerce&quot;. Orton had contracted with inventors [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Elisha Gray]] to find a way to send multiple  [[telegraphy|telegraph]] messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieee.cincinnati.fuse.net/reiman/03_2005.htm &quot;A History of Electrical Engineering.&quot;] ''ieee.cincinnati.fuse.net''. Retrieved: December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; When Bell mentioned to Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi-reed device, the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell's experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Patent matters would be handled by Hubbard's [[patent attorney]], [[Anthony Pollok]].&lt;ref&gt;Evenson 2000, pp. 18–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1875, Bell and Pollok visited the famous scientist [[Joseph Henry]], who was then director of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and asked Henry's advice on the electrical multi-reed apparatus that Bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph. Henry replied that Bell had &quot;the germ of a great invention&quot;. When Bell said that he did not have the necessary knowledge, Henry replied, &quot;Get it!&quot; That declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying, even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments, nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas. However, a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and [[Thomas A. Watson]], an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of Charles Williams, changed all that.

With financial support from Sanders and Hubbard, Bell was able to hire Thomas Watson as his assistant and the two of them experimented with [[acoustic telegraphy]]. On 2 June 1875, Watson accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell, at the receiving end of the wire, heard the overtones of the reed; overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech. That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary, not multiple reeds.  This led to the &quot;[[gallows]]&quot; [[sound-powered telephone]], which was able to transmit indistinct, voice-like sounds, but not clear speech.

=== The race to the patent office ===
{{Main|Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy}}

In 1875, Bell developed an [[Acoustic Telegraph|acoustic telegraph]] and drew up a [[patent application]] for it. Since he had agreed to share U.S. profits with his investors Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders, Bell requested that an associate in Ontario, [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], attempt to patent it in Britain, instructing his lawyers to apply for a patent in the U.S. only after they received word from Britain (Britain would issue patents only for discoveries not previously patented elsewhere).&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pp. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--not in the right article- belongs in the Gray and Bell controversy---NPOV involved--[[File:Bell-gray-smoking-gun.png|thumb|Excerpts from Elisha Gray's patent caveat of February 14 and Alexander Graham Bell's lab notebook entry of March 8, note their similarity]]---&gt;
[[File:TelephonePatentDrawingBell.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander Graham Bell's telephone patent&lt;ref&gt;{{Patent|US|174465|Alexander Graham Bell: &quot;Improvement in Telegraphy&quot; filed on February 14, 1876, granted on March 7, 1876.}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing, 7 March 1876.]]

Meanwhile, [[Elisha Gray]] was also experimenting with acoustic telegraphy and thought of a way to transmit speech using a water transmitter. On February 14, 1876, Gray filed a [[Patent caveat|caveat]] with the U.S. Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter. That same morning, Bell's lawyer filed Bell's application with the [[patent office]]. There is considerable debate about who arrived first and Gray later challenged the primacy of Bell's patent. Bell was in Boston on February 14, 1876.

Bell's patent 174,465, was issued to Bell on March 7, 1876, by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]]. Bell's patent covered &quot;the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically ... by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound&quot;&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod 1999, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; {{#tag:ref|A copy of a draft of the patent application is shown, described as &quot;probably the most valuable patent ever.&quot;|group=N}}

Bell returned to Boston the same day and the next day resumed work, drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in Gray's patent caveat.

On March 10, 1876, three days after his patent was issued, Bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work, using a liquid transmitter similar to Gray's design. Vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water, varying the [[electrical resistance]] in the circuit. When Bell spoke the famous sentence &quot;Mr Watson—Come here—I want to see you&quot; into the liquid transmitter,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trr002.html &quot;Bell's Lab notebook I, pp. 40–41 (image 22).&quot;] ''loc.gov.'' Retrieved: July 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Watson, listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room, heard the words clearly.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod 1999, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Bell was, and still is, accused of stealing the telephone from Gray,&lt;ref&gt;Shulman 2008, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell used Gray's water transmitter design only after Bell's patent was granted and only as a [[proof of concept]] scientific experiment&lt;ref&gt;Evenson 2000, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible &quot;articulate speech&quot; (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;Evenson 2000, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; After March 1876, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;Evenson 2000, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of priority for the variable resistance feature of the telephone was raised by the Examiner before he approved Bell's patent application. He told Bell that his claim for the variable resistance feature was also described in Gray's caveat. Bell pointed to a variable resistance device in Bell's previous application in which Bell described a cup of mercury, not water. Bell had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on Feb 25, 1875, long before Elisha Gray described the water device. In addition, Gray abandoned his caveat, and because Gray did not contest Bell's priority, the Examiner approved Bell's patent on March 3, 1876. Gray had REinvented the variable resistance telephone, but Bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone.&lt;ref&gt;Evenson 2000, pages 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Patent clerk|patent examiner]], Zenas Fisk Wilber, later stated in a sworn affidavit {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}that he was an alcoholic who was much in debt to Bell's lawyer, [[Marcellus Bailey]], with whom he had served in the Civil War. He claimed he showed Gray's patent caveat to Bailey. Wilber also claimed (after Bell arrived in Washington D.C. from Boston) that he showed Gray's caveat to Bell and that Bell paid him $100. Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms, although in a letter to Gray, Bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details. Bell denied in a sworn affidavit that he ever gave Wilber any money.

=== Later developments ===
Continuing his experiments in Brantford, Bell brought home a working model of his telephone. On August 3, 1876, from the telegraph office in [[Mount Pleasant, Brampton, Ontario|Mount Pleasant]] five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) away from Brantford, Bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was ready. With curious onlookers packed into the office as witnesses, faint voices were heard replying. The following night, he amazed guests as well as his family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford, four miles (six km) distant along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences, and laid through a tunnel. This time, guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing. These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod 1999, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell and his partners, Hubbard and Sanders, offered to sell the patent outright to Western Union for $100,000. The president of Western Union balked, countering that the telephone was nothing but a toy. Two years later, he told colleagues that if he could get the patent for $25 million he would consider it a bargain. By then, the Bell company no longer wanted to sell the patent.&lt;ref&gt;Fenster, Julie M.

Bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures in order to introduce the new invention to the [[scientific community]] as well as the general public. Only one day after, his demonstration of an early telephone prototype at the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition]] in [[Philadelphia]] made the telephone the featured headline worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Webb 1991, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Influential visitors to the exhibition included [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II of Brazil]], and later Bell had the opportunity to demonstrate the invention personally to [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], a renowned Scottish scientist.  Later Bell demonstrated the invention to [[Queen Victoria]] who had requested a private audience at [[Osborne House]], her [[Isle of Wight]] home.  She called the demonstration &quot;most extraordinary&quot;. The enthusiasm surrounding Bell's public displays laid the groundwork for universal acceptance of the revolutionary device.&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1995, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bell Telephone Company]] was created in 1877, and by 1886, over 150,000 people in the U.S. owned telephones.  Bell company engineers made numerous other improvements to the telephone, which emerged as one of the most successful products ever. In 1879, the Bell company acquired Edison's patents for the [[carbon microphone]] from Western Union. This made the telephone practical for long distances and it was no longer necessary to shout to be heard at the receiving telephone.

In January 1915, Bell made the first ceremonial transcontinental [[telephone call]]. Calling from the [[AT&amp;T]] head office at 15 Dey Street in New York City, Bell was heard by [[Thomas A. Watson|Thomas Watson]] at 333 Grant Avenue in [[San Francisco]]. The ''New York Times'' reported:
{{quote|''On October 9, 1876, Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas A. Watson talked by telephone to each other over a two-mile  wire stretched between Cambridge and Boston.

Although the telephone appeared to be an &quot;instant&quot; success, it was not initially a profitable venture and Bell's main sources of income were from lectures until after 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn 1990, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; One unusual request exacted by his fiancée was that he use &quot;Alec&quot; rather than the family's earlier familiar name of &quot;Aleck.&quot; From 1876, he would sign his name &quot;Alec Bell.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mackay 1997, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|&quot;Mrs. A.G.

The Bell family home was located in Cambridge, Massachusetts until 1880 when Bell's father-in-law bought a house in Washington, D.C., and later in 1882 the in the same city for Bell's family, so that they could be with him while he attended to the numerous court cases involving patent disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Gray 2006, pp. 202–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell was a [[British subject]] throughout his early life in Scotland and later in Canada until 1882, when he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States.  In 1915, he characterized his status as: &quot;I am not one of those hyphenated Americans who claim allegiance to two countries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this declaration, Bell has been proudly claimed as a &quot;native son&quot; by all three countries he resided in: the United States, Canada and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pp. 471–472.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1885, a new summer retreat was contemplated. That summer, the Bells had a vacation on [[Cape Breton Island]] in [[Nova Scotia]], spending time at the small village of Baddeck.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethune&quot;&gt;Bethune 2009 p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Returning in 1886, Bell started building an estate on a point across from Baddeck, overlooking [[Bras d'Or Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;Bethune 2009, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1889, a large house, christened ''The Lodge'' was completed and two years later, a larger complex of buildings, including a new laboratory,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethune&quot; /&gt; were begun that the Bells would name [[Beinn Bhreagh]] (Gaelic: ''beautiful mountain'') after Alec's ancestral [[Scottish Highlands|Scottish highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Tulloch 2006, pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;  {{#tag:ref|Under the direction of the Boston architects, Cabot, Everett and Mead, a Nova Scotia  company, Rhodes, Curry and Company, carried out the actual construction.|group=N}}Bell would spend his final, and some of his most productive, years in residence in both Washington, D.C., where he and his family initially resided for most of the year, and at Beinn Bhreagh.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod 1999, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of his life, Bell and his family would alternate between the two homes, but ''Beinn Bhreagh'' would, over the next 30 years, become more than a summer home as Bell became so absorbed in his experiments that his annual stays lengthened. Both Mabel and Alec became immersed in the Baddeck community and were accepted by the villagers as &quot;their own&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethune&quot; /&gt; The Bells were still in residence at ''Beinn Bhreagh'' when the [[Halifax Explosion]] occurred on 6 December 1917.

== Later inventions ==
{{Commons|Alexander_Graham_Bell#Inventions|Bell's many inventions}}
Although Alexander Graham Bell is most often associated with the invention of the telephone, his interests were extremely varied. According to one of his biographers, [[Charlotte Gray (author)|Charlotte Gray]], Bell's work ranged ''&quot;unfettered across the scientific landscape&quot;'' and  he often went to bed voraciously reading the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', scouring it for new areas of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Gray 2006, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, four for the [[Photophone]], one for the [[phonograph]], five for aerial vehicles, four for &quot;hydroairplanes&quot; and two for [[selenium]] cells. Bell's inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing, the [[audiometer]] to detect minor hearing problems, a device to locate icebergs, investigations on how to separate salt from seawater, and work on finding [[alternative fuel]]s.

Bell worked extensively in [[medical research]] and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf. During his [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a [[magnetic field]] on a record as a means of reproducing sound. Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they were unable to develop a workable prototype. They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the [[tape recorder]], the [[hard disc]] and [[floppy disc]] drive and other [[magnetic medium|magnetic media]].

Bell's own home used a primitive form of [[air conditioning]], in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice. He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution. [[Methane]] gas, he reasoned, could be produced from the waste of farms and factories. At his Canadian estate in Nova Scotia, he experimented with [[composting toilet]]s and devices to capture water from the atmosphere. In a magazine interview published shortly before his death, he reflected on the possibility of using [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s to heat houses.

=== Metal detector ===
Bell is also credited with the invention of the [[metal detector]] in 1881. The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[James Garfield]]. The metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin's bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grosvenor and Wesson, p. 107&quot;&gt;Grosvenor and Wesson 1997, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  The president's surgeons, who were skeptical of the device, ignored Bell's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs. Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grosvenor and Wesson, p. 107&quot;/&gt; Bell gave a full account of his experiments in a paper read before the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) in August 1882.

=== Hydrofoils ===
{{Main|Hydrofoil}}
[[File:Bell HD-4.jpg|thumb|Bell HD-4 on a test run c. 1919]]
The March 1906 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article by American [[hydrofoil]] pioneer [[William E. Meacham]] explained the basic principle of [[hydrofoil]]s and [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplane]]s. Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement. Based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat. Bell and assistant [[Frederick W. Baldwin|Frederick W. &quot;Casey&quot; Baldwin]] began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor [[Enrico Forlanini]] and began testing models. This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft.

During his world tour of 1910–1911, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in France. They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over [[Lake Maggiore]]. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying. On returning to Baddeck, a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models, including the ''Dhonnas Beag'', the first self-propelled Bell-Baldwin hydrofoil.&lt;ref&gt;Boileau 2004, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental boats were essentially proof-of-concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial HD-4, powered by [[Renault]] engines.  A top speed of {{convert|54|mph|km/h}} was achieved, with the hydrofoil exhibiting rapid acceleration, good stability and steering along with the ability to take waves without difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;Boileau 2004, pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, Dr. Bell hired Walter Pinaud, a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pinaud's Yacht Yard in [[Westmount, Nova Scotia]] to work on the pontoons of the HD-4. Pinaud soon took over the boatyard at Bell Laboratories on Beinn Bhreagh, Bell's estate near [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia]]. Pinaud's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD-4. After the [[World War I|First World War]], work began again on the HD-4. Bell's report to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] permitted him to obtain two 350 [[horsepower]] (260&amp;nbsp;[[Watt|kW]]) engines in July 1919. On September 9, 1919, the HD-4 set a world marine speed record of 70.86 miles  per hour (114.04&amp;nbsp;km/h),&lt;ref&gt;Boileau 2004, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; a record which stood for ten years.

=== Aeronautics ===
{{Main|Aerial Experiment Association|AEA Silver Dart}}
[[File:AEA Silver Dart.jpg|thumb|AEA Silver Dart c.&amp;nbsp;1909]]

In 1891, Bell had begun experiments to develop motor-powered [[Aircraft|heavier-than-air aircraft]].
The AEA was first formed as Bell shared the vision to fly with his wife, who advised him to seek &quot;young&quot; help as Alexander was at the graceful age of 60.

In 1898, Bell experimented with [[tetrahedral]] [[box kite]]s and wings constructed of multiple compound [[tetrahedral kite]]s covered in silk. The tetrahedral wings were named ''Cygnet'' I, II and III, and were flown both unmanned and manned (''Cygnet I'' crashed during a flight carrying Selfridge) in the period from 1907–1912. Some of Bell's kites are on display at the [[Streets named after Alexander Graham Bell|Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ns1763.ca/victco/bellmusbbm.html &quot;Nova Scotia's Electric Scrapbook.&quot;] ''ns1763.ca''. Retrieved: December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell was a supporter of [[aerospace engineering]] research through the [[Aerial Experiment Association]] (AEA), officially formed at Baddeck, Nova Scotia, in October 1907 at the suggestion of his wife [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard|Mabel]] and with her financial support after the sale of some of her real estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillis&quot;&gt;Gillis, Rannie.

Retrieved:  June 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The AEA was headed by Bell and the founding members were four young men: American [[Glenn H. Curtiss]], a motorcycle manufacturer at the time and who held the title &quot;world's fastest man&quot;, having ridden his self-constructed motor bicycle around in the shortest time, and who was later awarded the [[Scientific American|Scientific American Trophy]] for the first official one-kilometre flight in the [[Western hemisphere]], and who later became a world-renowned airplane manufacturer; Lieutenant [[Thomas Selfridge]], an official observer from the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] and the only person in the army who believed aviation was the future; [[Frederick W. Baldwin]], the first Canadian and first British subject to pilot a public flight in [[Hammondsport, New York]], and [[J.A.D. McCurdy]] —Baldwin and McCurdy being new engineering graduates from the [[University of Toronto]].

The AEA's work progressed to heavier-than-air machines, applying their knowledge of kites to gliders. Moving to Hammondsport, the group then designed and built the [[AEA Red Wing|''Red Wing'']], framed in bamboo and covered in red silk and powered by a small [[Engine cooling|air-cooled]] engine.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 1977, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 12, 1908, over [[Keuka Lake]], the biplane lifted off on the first public flight in North America.{{#tag:ref|&quot;Selfridge Aerodrome Sails Steadily for {{convert|319|ft|m}}.&quot; ''[[Washington Post]]'' May 13, 1908.|group=N}} {{#tag:ref| At 25 to 30 Miles an Hour.

[[Hammondsport, New York]], March 12, 1908.|group=N}} The innovations that were incorporated into this design included a cockpit enclosure and [[Rudder|tail rudder]] (later variations on the original design would add ailerons as a means of control). One of the AEA's inventions, the [[aileron]], which was also created independently by [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]] and several others, was to become a standard component on all airplanes. The ''White Wing'' and ''June Bug'' were to follow and by the end of 1908, over 150 flights  without mishap had been accomplished. However, the AEA had depleted its initial reserves and only a [[Mabel_Gardiner_Hubbard#Support_to_aeronautical_research|$15,000 grant from Mrs. Bell]] allowed it to continue with experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 1977, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their final aircraft design, the [[AEA Silver Dart|''Silver Dart'']] embodied all of the advancements found in the earlier machines. On February 23, 1909, Bell was present as the ''Silver Dart'' flown by J.A.D. McCurdy from the frozen ice of Bras d'Or, made the first aircraft flight in Canada. Bell had worried that the flight was too dangerous and had arranged for a doctor to be on hand. With the successful flight, the AEA disbanded and the ''Silver Dart'' would revert to Baldwin and McCurdy who began the Canadian Aerodrome Company and would later demonstrate the aircraft to the [[Canadian Forces Land Force Command|Canadian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 1977, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eugenics ==
&lt;!--Bell's work with Eugenics is still considered contentious. Any submissions to this section should be documented in the &quot;talk page&quot; associated with this article.--&gt;
Bell was connected with the [[eugenics]] movement in the United States. In his lecture ''Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race'' presented to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] on 13 November 1883 he noted that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children and tentatively suggested that couples where both parties were deaf should not marry.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Alexander Graham. [http://saveourdeafschools.org/race.pdf &quot;Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race.&quot;] ''Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf'', 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was his hobby of livestock breeding which led to his appointment to biologist [[David Starr Jordan]]'s Committee on Eugenics, under the auspices of the [[American Breeders Association]]. The committee unequivocally extended the principle to man.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pp. 410–417.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1912 until 1918 he was the chairman of the board of scientific advisers to the [[Eugenics Record Office]] associated with [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] in New York, and regularly attended meetings. In 1921, he was the honorary president of the [[Second International Congress of Eugenics]] held under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York. Organisations such as these advocated passing laws (with success in some states) that established the [[compulsory sterilization]] of people deemed to be, as Bell called them, a &quot;defective variety of the human race&quot;. By the late 1930s, about half the states in the U.S. had eugenics laws, and the [[California]] laws were used as a model for eugenics laws in [[Nazi Germany]].

In partnership with [[Gardiner Greene Hubbard|Gardiner Hubbard]], Bell helped established the publication [[Science (journal)|Science]] during the early 1880s. In 1888, Bell was one of the founding members of the [[National Geographic Society]] and became its second president (1897–1904), and also became a Regent of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] (1898–1922). The French government conferred on him the decoration of the [[Légion d'honneur]] (Legion of Honor); the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in London awarded him the [[Albert Medal (RSA)|Albert Medal]] in 1902; and the [[University of Würzburg]], [[Bavaria]], granted him a Ph.D. He was awarded the [[Franklin Institute|Franklin Institute's]] [[Elliott Cresson Medal]] in 1912.

In 1940 the [[United States Postal Service|US Post Office]] issued a [[commemorative stamp]] honoring Bell in its [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States#Famous Americans Series of 1940|'Famous Americans Series']].  The First Day of Issue ceremony was held on October 28 in Boston, Massachusetts, the city where Bell spent considerable time on research and working with the deaf. The Bell stamp became very popular and sold out in little time. The stamp became, and remains to this day, the most valuable one of the series.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's United States Stamp catalogue&lt;/ref&gt;

The 150th anniversary of Bell's birth in 1997 was marked by a special issue of commemorative £1 [[banknote]]s from the [[Royal Bank of Scotland#Commemorative banknotes|Royal Bank of Scotland]]. The illustrations on the reverse of the note include Bell's face in profile, his signature, and objects from Bell's life and career: users of the telephone over the ages; an audio [[waveform|wave signal]]; a diagram of a telephone receiver; geometric shapes from engineering structures; representations of [[sign language]] and the [[phonetic alphabet]]; the [[geese]] which helped him to understand [[flight]]; and the [[sheep]] which he studied to understand [[genetics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;commemorative&quot;&gt;[http://www.rampantscotland.com/SCM/royalcomm.htm &quot;Royal Bank Commemorative Notes.&quot;] ''Rampant Scotland''.

On learning of Bell's death, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]] cabled Mrs. Bell, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;tt&gt;''[The Government expresses] to you our sense of the world's loss in the death of your distinguished husband. It will ever be a source of pride to our country that the great invention, with which his name is immortally associated, is a part of its history. On the behalf of the citizens of Canada, may I extend to you an expression of our combined gratitude and sympathy.&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bell's coffin was constructed of Beinn Bhreagh pine by his laboratory staff, lined with the same red silk fabric used in his tetrahedral kite experiments.  In order to help celebrate his life, his wife asked guests  not to wear black (the traditional funeral color) while attending his service, during which soloist Jean MacDonald sang a verse of [[Robert Louis Stevenson|Robert Louis Stevenson's]] 'Requiem':&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethune 119-120&quot;&gt;Bethune 2009, pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dig the grave and let me lie.&lt;br&gt;
''Glad did I live and gladly die&lt;br&gt;
''And I lay me down with a will.&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Anatolia composite NASA.png|thumb|300px|Composite satellite image of Turkey. Anatolia corresponds to the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey.]]

'''Anatolia''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ἀνατολή}} ''{{lang|gr-Latn|Anatolē}}'' — &quot;east&quot; or &quot;(sun)rise&quot;; also '''Asia Minor''', from {{Lang-el|Μικρὰ Ἀσία}} ''{{lang|gr-Latn|Mikrá Asía}}'' &quot;small Asia&quot;; in modern {{Lang-tr|Anadolu}}) is a geographic and historical term denoting the westernmost protrusion of [[Asia]], comprising the majority of the [[Republic of Turkey]]. The region is bounded by the [[Black Sea]] to the north, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to the northeast, the [[Armenian Highland]] to the east, [[Mesopotamia]] to the southeast, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south and the [[Aegean Sea]] to the west. Anatolia has been home to many civilizations throughout history, such as the [[Hittites]], [[Phrygia]]ns, [[Lydia]]ns, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Armenians]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Georgians]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Sultanate of Rûm|Anatolian Seljuks]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. As a result, Anatolia has been of interest to archaeologists.

Most of the interior of Anatolia consists of a high-altitude [[plateau]] that becomes increasingly mountainous as one moves east. The [[Sea of Marmara]] forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the [[Bosphorus]] and [[Dardanelles]] straits, and separates Anatolia from [[Thrace]] on the [[Europe]]an mainland. Anatolia is separated from the Armenian Highland to the east by the [[Euphrates]] river, and from [[Syria]] by the [[Orontes]] river.

The vast majority of the people residing in Anatolia are [[Turkish people|Turks]]. [[Kurds]], who constitute a major community in southeastern Anatolia, are the largest ethnic minority. [[Albanians]], [[Arabs]], [[Armenians]], [[Assyrians]], [[Bosnians]], [[Circassians]], [[Georgians]], [[Greeks]], [[Jews]], [[Laz people|Laz]] and a number of other ethnic groups also live in Anatolia in smaller numbers.

==Name==
{{details|Names of Anatolia}}
{{Mergefrom|Names of Anatolia|date=August 2009}}
The name ''Anatolia'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Aνατολή}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|anatolē}}'') meaning the &quot;East&quot; or more literally &quot;sunrise.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;etym&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%237638| title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise reference of this term has varied over time, perhaps originally referring only to the [[Ionians|Ionian]] colonies on the Asia Minor coast. In the [[Byzantine Empire]], ''[[Anatolikon]]'' was a [[thema|theme]] covering the western and central parts of Turkey's present-day [[Central Anatolia Region, Turkey|Central Anatolian Region]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;On the First Thema, Called Anatolikon. This theme is called Anatolikon, not because it is above and in the direction of the east where the sun rises, but because it lies East of Byzantium and Europe.&quot; Constantine VII Porphyogenitus, ''De Thematibus'', ed. A. Pertusi. [[Vatican Publishing House|Vatican]]: [[Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana]], 1952, pp. 59–61.{{Clarify|date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Haldon, &quot;Byzantium, a History&quot;, 2002. PAge 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical geography==
[[File:Turkey topo.jpg|thumb|300px|[[cartographic relief depiction|Relief map]] of [[Turkey]]]]

The Anatolian peninsula is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south, the [[Aegean Sea]] to the west, and the sea of Marmara to the northwest, which separates Anatolia from Thrace in Europe. To the east, Anatolia is bounded by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Armenian Highland and the Euphrates before that river bends to the southeast to enter [[Mesopotamia]]. To the southeast, Anatolia is bounded by the ranges that separate it from the Orontes valley in [[Greater Syria]] and the Mesopotamian plain. The northern coast of Anatolia stretches farther east than the central region, reaching all the way to the modern border with Georgia.

Anatolia's terrain is structurally complex. A central [[massif]] composed of uplifted blocks and downfolded [[Trough (geology)|troughs]], covered by recent [[Deposit (geology)|deposits]] and giving the appearance of a plateau with rough terrain, is wedged between two folded mountain ranges that converge in the east. True lowland is confined to a few narrow coastal strips along the Aegean, Mediterranean, and Black Sea coasts. Flat or gently sloping land is rare and largely confined to the deltas of the [[Kızıl River]], the coastal plains of [[Çukurova]] and the valley floors of the [[Gediz River]] and the [[Büyük Menderes River]] as well as some interior high plains in Anatolia, mainly around ''[[Lake Tuz|Tuz Gölü]]'' (Salt Lake) and the [[Konya]] Basin (''Konya Ovasi'').

==Regions==
===Black Sea Coast===
[[File:Pontic Panorama.jpg|thumb|300px|Panoramic view of the [[Pontic Mountains]]]]

The Black Sea coast is characterized by a range of steep mountains that extend along the entire length of the coast, separating it from the inland Anatolian plateau. In the west, the mountains tend to be low, with elevations from {{convert|1525|-|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but they rise in the easterly direction to heights greater than {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} south of Rize, reaching {{convert|3937|m|ft|abbr=on}} at the [[Kaçkar Mountains]] in the [[Pontic Alps]]. Lengthy, troughlike valleys and basins characterize the mountains. The southern slopes, facing the Anatolian Plateau, are mostly unwooded, but the northern slopes contain dense growths of both deciduous and evergreen trees. The higher slopes facing northwest tend to be densely forested.

The coast is rugged and rocky, with rivers that cascade through the gorges of the coastal ranges. A few larger rivers, those cutting back through the Pontic Alps, have tributaries that flow in broad, elevated basins. Access inland from the coast is limited to a few narrow valleys because mountain ridges. Because of these natural conditions, the Black Sea coast historically has been isolated from Anatolia.

===Marmara Region===
{{Main|Marmara Region, Turkey}}
[[File:View of Bursa from the hills of Mount Uludag.jpg|thumb|200px|View of [[Bursa]] from the hills near [[Uludağ]], the ancient [[Mysia]]n Olympus]]

The coast of Anatolia that borders the Sea of Marmara consists mainly of rolling plateau country well suited to agriculture. It receives about {{convert|52|cm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall annually.

Densely populated, this area includes the cities of [[Istanbul]] and Bursa, Turkey's fourth largest city. The Bosphorus, which links the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea, is about {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and averages {{convert|1.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} in width but narrows in places to less than {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. There are two suspension bridges over the Bosphorus, both its Asian and European banks rise steeply from the water and form a succession of cliffs, coves, and nearly landlocked bays. Most of the shores are densely wooded and are marked by numerous small towns and villages. The Dardanelles Strait, which links the Sea of Marmara and the Aegean Sea, is approximately {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and increases in width toward the south. Unlike the Bosphorus, the Dardanelles has fewer settlements along its shores.

The most important valleys are the [[İzmit|Kocaeli]] Valley, the [[Balıkesir Province|Balıkesir]] Ovası (Balıkesir Plain), the [[Bursa Province|Bursa]] Ovası (Bursa Plain), and the Plains of [[Troy]] (historically known as the [[Troad]].)

===Aegean Coast===
[[File:Oludeniz.jpg|thumb|200px|View of [[Ölüdeniz]] near [[Fethiye]]]]

Located on the west coast of Anatolia, the Aegean region has a fertile soil and a typically Mediterranean climate; with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The broad, cultivated lowland valleys contain about half of the country's richest farmlands.

The largest city in the Aegean Region of Turkey is [[İzmir]], which is also the country's third largest city and second largest port after Istanbul.

[[Olive]] and [[olive oil]] production is particularly important for the economy of the region. The seaside town of [[Ayvalık]] and numerous towns in the provinces of [[İzmir Province|İzmir]] and [[Aydın Province|Aydın]] are particularly famous for their olive oil and related products; such as soap and cosmetics.

The region is home to many famous ancient cities; places such as [[Pergamum]], [[Ephesus]], [[Miletus]], [[Halicarnassus]] (Bodrum), [[Smyrna]].

&lt;center&gt;{{wide image|BodrumPano.jpg|1000px|&lt;center&gt;Panoramic view of [[Bodrum]], ancient [[Halicarnassus]], the city of [[Herodotus]] and the home of the [[Mausoleum of Maussollos]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]&lt;/center&gt;}}&lt;/center&gt;

===Mediterranean Coast===
[[File:1362643.jpg|thumb|200px|Beaches and marina of [[Kemer]] near [[Antalya]] in the [[Turkish Riviera]]]]

Beginning in the west of [[Antalya province]], the south-facing Mediterranean coast of Turkey is separated from the interior by steep ranges, known as the Taurus mountains, that run along the entire length of the coast. The [[Taurus Mountains]] (''Toros Dağları'') are Anatolia's second chain of folded mountains. The south facing slopes rise steeply from the Mediterranean coastal plain, but slope very gently on the north side towards the Anatolian plateau. In the east, the Taurus mountains arc around the northern side of the Arabian Platform, before turning south and continuing as the ranges that define the [[Great Rift Valley]]. Between [[Adana]] and [[Antalya]], the Taurus Mountains rise sharply from the coast to high elevations, reaching altitudes of over {{convert|3700|m|ft|abbr=on}} north of Adana. The Taurus Mountains are more rugged and less dissected by rivers than the Pontus Mountains and historically have served as a barrier to human movement inland from the Mediterranean coast except where there are mountain passes such as the historic [[Cilician Gates]] (Gülek Pass), northwest of Adana.

Toward the east, the extensive plains around Adana, Turkey's fourth largest city, consist largely of reclaimed flood lands. In general, rivers have not cut valleys to the sea in the western part of the region. East of Adana, much of the coastal plain has limestone features such as collapsed caverns and sinkholes. Other than Adana, Antalya, and [[Mersin]], the Mediterranean coast has few major cities, although it has numerous farming villages.

&lt;center&gt;{{wide image|Alanya Panorama.jpg|1000px|&lt;center&gt;Panoramic view of [[Alanya]], inhabited since the Hittites and the medieval homeport of the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]] naval forces, famous today for its natural beauty and historic monuments&lt;/center&gt;}}&lt;/center&gt;

===Central Plateau===
[[File:View of Cappadocia edit.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Cappadocia]]]]

Stretching inland from the Aegean coastal plain, the Central Anatolian plateau occupies the area between the two zones of the folded coastal ranges in the north and south, extending east to the point where the two ranges converge. The plateau-like, semiarid highlands of Anatolia are considered the heartland of the country. The region varies in elevation from {{convert|600|-|1200|m|ft|abbr=on}} from west to east. The Anatolian plateau is interspersed with extinct volcanoes, the tallest of which is Mt. [[Erciyes]], rising to {{convert|3917|m|ft|abbr=on}} near [[Kayseri]].

Frequently interspersed throughout the folded mountains, and also situated on the Anatolian Plateau, are well-defined basins, which the Turks call &quot;ova&quot;. Some are no more than a widening of a stream valley; others, such as the Konya Ovasi, are large basins of inland drainage or are the result of limestone erosion. Most of the basins take their names from cities or towns located at their rims. Where a lake has formed within the basin, the water body is usually saline as a result of the internal drainage — the water has no outlet to the sea. The two largest basins on the plateau are the [[Konya]] Ovasi and the basin occupied by the large salt lake, [[Lake Tuz|Tuz Gölü]].

Forested areas are confined to the northwest and northeast of the plateau. Rain-fed cultivation is widespread, with wheat being the principal crop. Irrigated agriculture is restricted to the areas surrounding rivers and wherever sufficient underground water is available. Important irrigated crops include barley, corn, cotton, various fruits, grapes, opium poppies, sugar beets, roses, and tobacco. There also is extensive grazing throughout the plateau.

Central Anatolia receives little annual rainfall with an average precipitation of {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} per year. The driest part of the region is the semiarid center of the plateau which receives an average yearly precipitation of only {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}. However, actual rainfall from year to year is irregular and occasionally may be less than {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}}, leading to severe reductions in crop yields for both rain-fed and irrigated agriculture. Overgrazing has contributed to soil erosion on some parts of the plateau. During the summers, frequent dust storms blow a fine yellow powder across the plateau. Locusts occasionally ravage the eastern area in April and May. In general, the plateau experiences high temperatures and almost no rainfall in summer and cold weather with heavy snow in winter.

==Climate==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Anatolia has a varied range of climates. The central plateau is characterized by a continental climate, with hot summers and cold snowy winters. The south and west coasts enjoy a typical Mediterranean climate, with mild rainy winters, and warm dry summers. The Black sea and Marmara coasts have temperate oceanic climate, with cool foggy summers and much rainfall throughout the year.

==Ecoregions==
Anatolia's diverse topography and climate has fostered a similar diversity of plant and animal communities.

The mountains and coastal plain of northern Anatolia, with its humid and mild climate, is home to [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate broadleaf, mixed]] and [[temperate coniferous forest|coniferous]] forests. The central and eastern plateau, with its drier [[continental climate]], is home to deciduous forests and forest steppes. Western and southern Anatolia, which have a [[Mediterranean climate]], are home to [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] ecoregions.

==History==
{{Main|History of Anatolia}}

===Antiquity===
[[File:Anatolia Ancient Regions base.svg|right|thumb|300px|Ancient regions of Anatolia.]]

Eastern Anatolia contains the oldest monumental structures in the world. For example, the monumental structures at [[Göbekli Tepe]] were built by hunters and gatherers a thousand years before the development of agriculture. Eastern Anatolia is also a heart region for the [[Neolithic revolution]], one of the earliest areas in which humans domesticated plants and animals. Neolithic sites such as [[Çatalhöyük]], [[Çayönü]], [[Nevali Cori]] and [[Hacilar]] represent the world's oldest known agricultural villages.

The earliest historical records of Anatolia are from the [[Akkadian Empire]] under [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]] in the 24th century BC. The region was famous for exporting various raw materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman&quot;/&gt;
The [[Assyrian Empire]] claimed the resources, notably [[silver]]. One of the numerous Assyrian [[cuneiform]] records found in Anatolia at [[Kanesh]] uses an advanced system of trading computations and credit lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Charles|title= Egypt, Greece and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=0198721943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Akkadians and the Assyrians, whose Anatolian possessions were peripheral to their core lands in Mesopotamia, the [[Hittites]] were centered at [[Hattusa]] in north-central Anatolia. They were speakers of an [[Indo-European language]] known as the &quot;[[Nesili|language of Nesa]]&quot;. Originating from [[Kültepe|Nesa]], they conquered Hattusa in the 18th century BC, imposing themselves over a [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] speaking population. During the Late Bronze Age, they created an empire, the [[Hittite New Kingdom]], which reached its height in the 14th century BC. The empire included a large part of Anatolia, north-western Syria and upper Mesopotamia. After 1180 BC, the empire [[Bronze Age collapse|disintegrated]] into several independent &quot;[[Neo-Hittite]]&quot; states. Ancient Anatolia is subdivided by modern scholars into various regions named after the people that occupied them, such as [[Lydia]], [[Lycia]], [[Caria]], [[Mysia]], [[Bithynia]], [[Phrygia]], [[Galatia]], [[Lycaonia]], [[Pisidia]], [[Paphlagonia]], [[Cilicia]], and [[Cappadocia]].

Beginning with the [[Bronze Age]] Collapse at the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the west coast of Anatolia was settled by [[Ionian Greeks]]. Over several centuries, numerous [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[city states]] were established on the coasts of Anatolia. Greeks started Western philosophy on the western coast of Anatolia ([[Pre-Socratic philosophy]]). In the 6th century BC, most of Anatolia was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire. In the 4th century BC, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the peninsula. Following his death and the breakup of his empire, Anatolia was ruled by a series of Hellenistic kingdoms. Two hundred years later western and central Anatolia came under Roman control, but it continued to be strongly influenced by [[Hellenistic culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Manjakani]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century BC, the [[Armenian people|Armenians]] established the [[Kingdom of Armenia (Antiquity)|Armenian kingdom]] under [[Tigran]] who reigned throughout much of eastern Anatolia between the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]], Black and Mediterranean seas. Anatolia is known as the birthplace of [[coin]]age as a medium of exchange (some time in the 7th century BC), which flourished during the Greek and Roman eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=0415089921|last=Howgego|first=C. J.|title=Ancient History from Coins| year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaminorcoins.com Asia Minor Coins] - an index of Greek and Roman coins from Asia Minor (ancient Anatolia)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval and Rennaisance Periods===
[[File:Asia Minor ca 842 AD.svg|thumb|right|300px|Byzantine Anatolia and the Byzantine-Arab frontier zone in the mid-9th century]]
[[File:Anatolia1300.png|thumb|right|300px|Beyliks and other states around Anatolia, c. 1300.]]

After the division of the Roman Empire, Anatolia became part of the East Roman, or Byzantine Empire. Byzantine control was challenged by Arab raids starting in the 7th century (see [[Byzantine–Arab Wars]]), but in the 9th and 10th century a resurgent Byzantine Empire regained its lost territories and even expanded beyond its traditional borders, into Armenia and Syria. Following the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the Seljuk Turks swept across Anatolia and conquered it in its entirety by 1080. The [[Turkish language]] and Islamic religion were gradually introduced as a result of the Seljuk conquest, and this period marks the start of Anatolia's slow transition from predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking, to predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking. In the following century, the Byzantines managed to reassert their control in Western and Northern Anatolia. Control of Anatolia was then split between the Byzantine Empire and the Seljuk [[Sultanate of Rûm]], with the Byzantine holdings gradually being reduced. In 1255, the Mongols swept through central and eastern Anatolia, and would remain until 1335. The [[Ilkhanate]] garrison was stationed near [[Ankara]].&lt;ref&gt;H. M. Balyuzi-Muḥammad and the course of Islám, p.342&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Freely-Storm on Horseback: The Seljuk Warriors of Turkey, p.83&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 14th century, most of Anatolia was controlled by various [[Anatolian beyliks]]. The Turkmen Beyliks were under the control of the Mongols, at least nominally, through declining Seljuk Sultans.&lt;ref&gt;Mehmet Fuat Köprülü, Gary Leiser-The origins of the Ottoman empire, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Partner-God of battles: holy wars of Christianity and Islam, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; The Beyliks did not mint coins in the names of their own leaders while they remained under the suzerainty of the Ilkhanids.&lt;ref&gt;Osman's Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Osmanli]] ruler [[Osman I]] was the first Turkish ruler who minted coins in his own name in 1320's, for it bears the legend &quot;Minted by Osman son of Ertugul&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Artuk-Osmanli Beyliginin Kurucusu, 27f&lt;/ref&gt; Since the minting of coins was a prerogative accorded in Islamic practice only to be a [[sovereign]], it can be considered that Osmanli became independent of the Mongol Khans.&lt;ref&gt;Pamuk-A Monetary history, p.30-31&lt;/ref&gt;

After the decline of the Ilkhanate from 1335–1353, the [[Mongol Empire]]'s legacy in the region was the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] [[Eretna Dynasty]] that was overthrown by [[Kadi Burhan al-Din]] in 1381.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Edmund Bosworth-The new Islamic dynasties: a chronological and genealogical manual, p.234&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] leaders the Ottomans emerged as great power under Osman and his son [[Orhan I]]. [[Smyrna]] was conquered in 1330, and the last Byzantine possession, Philadélphia (modern [[Alaşehir]]), fell in 1390. The Anatolian beyliks were in turn absorbed into the rising [[Ottoman Empire]] during the 15th century. The Ottomans completed the conquest of the peninsula in 1517 with the taking of Halicarnassus (Bodrum) from the [[Knights of Saint John]].

With the beginning of the slow decline of the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century, and as a result of the expansionist policies of [[Czarist Russia]] in the [[Caucasus]], many Muslim nations and groups in that region, mainly [[Circassians]], [[Tatars]], [[Azeris]], [[Lezgian people|Lezgi]]s, [[Chechens]], and several [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] groups left their ancestral homelands and settled in Anatolia. As the Ottoman Empire further fragmented during the [[Balkan Wars]], much of the non-Christian populations of its former possessions, mainly the Balkan Muslims, flocked to Anatolia and were resettled in various locations, mostly in formerly Christian villages throughout Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;Justin McCarthy,&quot;Death and Exile: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ottoman Muslims, 1821-1922&quot;,1996,ISBN 0-87850-094-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Anatolia remained multi-ethnic until the early 20th century (see the [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]]). During [[World War I]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], the [[Greek genocide]] (especially in [[Pontus]]), and the [[Assyrian Genocide]] almost entirely removed the Armenian and [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] populations of Anatolia, as well as a large part of its ethnic Greek population. Following the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922]], all remaining ethnic Anatolian Greeks were forced out during the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. Since the foundation of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, Anatolia has become Turkey, its inhabitants being mainly Turks and Kurds (see [[demographics of Turkey]] and [[history of Turkey]]).

The [[Apple II series|Apple II]] was introduced on April 16, 1977 at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. It differed from its major rivals, the [[TRS-80]] and [[Commodore PET]], because it came with color graphics and an open [[computer architecture|architecture]]. While early models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5&amp;nbsp;1/4&amp;nbsp;inch [[floppy disk]] drive and interface, the [[Disk II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Apple II History Chapter 4 | url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04/ | author=Steven Weyhrich| date=April 21, 2002 | accessdate=August 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first &quot;[[killer application|killer app]]&quot; of the business world—the [[VisiCalc]] [[spreadsheet]] program.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemvc&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas. [http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/visicalc-origin-bricklin.html VisiCalc and the rise of the Apple II], ''Low End Mac'', September 22, 2006.

By the end of the 1970s, Apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line. The company introduced the ill-fated [[Apple III]] in May 1980 in an attempt to compete with [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]] in the business and corporate computing market.&lt;ref&gt;Coventry, Joshua.

Jobs and several Apple employees including [[Jef Raskin]] visited [[Xerox PARC]] in December 1979 to see the [[Xerox Alto]]. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000 shares (800,000 split-adjusted shares) of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2000/foth000918.htm|title=Fool.com: How Xerox Forfeited the PC War|work=The Motley Fool|author=Landley, Rob|date=September 18, 2000|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface ([[GUI]]), and development of a GUI began for the [[Apple Lisa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.worldofapple.com/archives/2006/03/30/apple-at-30-1976-to-1986/|title=Apple at 30&amp;nbsp;– 1976 to 1986 | World of Apple|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Apple went public, it generated more capital than any IPO since [[Ford Motor Company]] in 1956 and instantly created more millionaires (about 300) than any company in history.

Steve Jobs began working on the [[Apple Lisa]] in 1978 but in 1982 he was pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting, and took over Jef Raskin's low-cost-computer project, the [[Macintosh]]. A turf war broke out between Lisa's &quot;corporate shirts&quot; and Jobs' &quot;pirates&quot; over which product would ship first and save Apple. Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemlisa&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas.

The Mac was particularly powerful in this market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI.

[[File:Macintosh portable.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Macintosh Portable]] was Apple's first &quot;portable&quot; Macintosh computer, released in 1989.]]
Having learned several painful lessons after introducing the bulky [[Macintosh Portable]] in 1989, Apple introduced the [[PowerBook]] in 1991, which established the modern form factor and [[ergonomics|ergonomic]] layout of the laptop computer.&lt;ref name=&quot;lempb&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas.

Retrieved on March 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Macintosh Portable was designed to be just as powerful as a desktop Macintosh, but weighed 17&amp;nbsp;pounds with a 12-hour battery life. The same year, Apple introduced [[System 7]], a major upgrade to the operating system, which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for [[Mac OS]] until 2001.

The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemsculley&quot; /&gt; For some time, it appeared that Apple could do no wrong, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine ''[[MacLife|MacAddict]]'' named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the &quot;first golden age&quot; of the Macintosh.

Following the success of the [[Macintosh LC]], Apple introduced the [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] line, a low-end [[Macintosh Quadra|Quadra]] offering, and the ill-fated [[Performa]] line that was sold in several confusing configurations and software bundles to avoid competing with the various consumer outlets such as [[Sears]], [[Price Club]], and [[Wal-Mart]], the primary dealers for these models. The result was disastrous for Apple as consumers did not understand the difference between models.&lt;ref name=&quot;vawperforma&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Macintosh Performa|url=http://www.vectronicsappleworld.com/profiles/performa.html|publisher=Vectronics Apple World|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time Apple experimented with a number of other failed consumer targeted products including [[QuickTake|digital cameras]], [[PowerCD|portable CD audio players]], [[AppleDesign Powered Speakers|speakers]], [[Bandai Pippin|video consoles]], and [[Apple Interactive Television Box|TV appliances]]. Enormous resources were also invested in the problem-plagued [[Newton (platform)|Newton division]] based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Ultimately, all of this proved too-little-too-late for Apple as their market share and stock prices continued to slide.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Apple saw the [[Apple II series]] as too expensive to produce, while taking away sales from the low end Macintosh.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple2history11&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah11.html#11|title=Apple II History Chap 11|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Apple released the [[Macintosh LC]] with a single [[expansion slot]] for the [[Apple IIe Card]] to migrate Apple II users to the Macintosh platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple2history11&quot; /&gt; Apple stopped selling the [[Apple IIe]] in 1993.

[[File:Newton-IMG 0320 cleanup.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Newton (platform)|Newton]] was Apple's first foray into the [[personal digital assistant|PDA]] markets, as well as one of the first in the industry. Despite being a financial flop at the time of its release, it helped pave the way for the [[Palm Pilot]] and Apple's own [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] in the future.]]
By the early 1990s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh, such as the [[A/UX]]. Apple had also begun to experiment in providing a Mac-only online portal which they called [[eWorld]], developed in collaboration with [[America Online]] and designed as a Mac-friendly alternative to other online services such as [[CompuServe]]. The Macintosh platform was itself becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking, and several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware. In addition, Apple was facing competition from [[OS/2]] and [[UNIX]] vendors like [[Sun Microsystems]]. The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform, or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html|title=1990–1995: Hitting the Wall|accessdate=August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Apple allied with IBM and [[Motorola]] in the [[AIM alliance]]. The goal was to create a new computing platform (the [[PowerPC Reference Platform]]), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple's software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind, thus countering Microsoft. The same year, Apple introduced the [[Power Macintosh]], the first of many Apple computers to use IBM's [[PowerPC]] processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple-history.com/body.php?page=gallery&amp;model=6100&amp;performa=off&amp;sort=date&amp;order=ASC&amp;range=|title=Power Macintosh 6100|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event also saw the announcement of the [[iPhone]] and the [[Apple TV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MW2007&quot;&gt;[http://www.apple.com/hotnews/articles/2007/01/mwsf/ Apple&amp;nbsp;– Hot News&amp;nbsp;– Macworld 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Apple shares hit $97.80, an all-time high at that point.

In an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Steve Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without [[Digital rights management|DRM]] (which would allow tracks to be played on third-party players) if record labels would agree to drop the technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsMax&quot;&gt;[[Steve Jobs|Jobs, Steve]].

After years of speculation and multiple rumored &quot;leaks&quot; Apple announced a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the iPad on January 27, 2010. The iPad runs the same touch based operating system that the iPhone uses and many of the same iPhone apps are compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch even with very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the US and sold more than 300,000 units on that day and reaching 500,000 by the end of the first week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/04/05ipad.html| title=Apple Sells Over 300,000 iPads First Day| publisher=Apple Inc| accessdate=April 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May of the same year, Apple's [[market cap]] exceeded that of competitor [[Microsoft]] for the first time since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/10168684.stm|title=Apple passes Microsoft to be biggest tech company|date=May 27, 2010|accessdate=May 29, 2010|work=[[BBC News online]]|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple released the [[iPhone 4|fourth generation iPhone]], which introduced [[video calling]], [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]], and a new [[Electrical insulation|uninsulated]] [[stainless steel]] design, which acts as the phone's antenna. Because of this antenna implementation, some iPhone 4 users reported a reduction in signal strength when the phone is held in specific ways. After a large amount of media coverage including mainstream news organizations, Apple held a press conference where they offered buyers a free rubber 'bumper' case, which had been proven to eliminate the signal reduction issue.

=== Software ===
{{See also|List of Macintosh software}}
Apple develops its own [[operating system]] to run on Macs, [[Mac OS X]], the latest version being [[Mac OS X v10.6|Mac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard]]. Apple also independently develops computer software titles for its Mac OS X operating system. Much of the software Apple develops is bundled with its computers. An example of this is the consumer-oriented iLife software package that bundles [[iDVD]], [[iMovie]], [[iPhoto]], iTunes, [[GarageBand]], and [[iWeb]]. For presentation, page layout and word processing, [[iWork]] is available, which includes [[Keynote (software)|Keynote]], [[Pages]], and [[Numbers (software)|Numbers]]. iTunes, [[QuickTime]] media player, [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser, and [[Software Update]] are available as free downloads for both Mac OS X and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

Apple also offers a range of professional software titles. Their range of server software includes the operating system [[Mac OS X Server]]; [[Apple Remote Desktop]], a remote systems management application; [[WebObjects]], [[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition|Java EE]] Web [[application server]]; and [[Xsan]], a [[Storage Area Network]] file system. For the professional creative market, there is [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] for professional [[Raw image format|RAW]]-format [[photo]] processing; [[Final Cut Studio]], a video production suite; [[Logic Pro|Logic]], a comprehensive music toolkit and [[Shake (software)|Shake]], an advanced effects composition program.

Apple also offers online services with [[MobileMe]] (formerly [[.Mac]]) that bundles personal [[web page]]s, [[email]], [[social network service|Groups]], [[iDisk]], [[backup (backup software)|backup]], [[iSync]], and Learning Center online tutorials. MobileMe is a subscription-based internet suite that capitalizes on the ability to store personal data on an online server and thereby keep all web-connected devices in sync.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.apple.com/mobileme/features/|title=Apple.com&amp;nbsp;— MobileMe&amp;nbsp;— Features|accessdate=August 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Announced at MacWorld Expo 2009, [[iWork.com]] allows iWork users to upload documents for sharing and collaboration.

== Culture ==
=== Corporate ===

Apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of what a [[corporate culture]] should look like in organizational hierarchy (flat versus tall, casual versus formal attire, etc.). Other highly successful firms with similar cultural aspects from the same period include [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Microsoft]]. Originally, the company stood in opposition to staid competitors like [[IBM]] by default, thanks to the influence of its founders; Steve Jobs often walked around the office [[barefoot]] even after Apple was a [[Fortune 500]] company. By the time of the [[1984 (television commercial)|&quot;1984&quot; TV ad]], this trait had become a key way the company attempts to differentiate itself from its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deutschman|first=Alan|title=The once and future Steve Jobs|url=http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/|work=Salon.com|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the company has grown and been led by a series of chief executives, each with his own idea of what Apple should be, some of its original character has arguably been lost, but Apple still has a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably draws talented people into its employ, especially after Jobs' return. To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program, awarding individuals who made extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to [[personal computing]] while at the company. The Apple Fellowship has so far been awarded to a few individuals including [[Bill Atkinson]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzfeld&quot;&gt;[[Andy Hertzfeld|Hertzfeld, Andy]].

While this brand loyalty is considered unusual for any product, Apple appears not to have gone out of its way to create it. At one time, [[Apple evangelist]]s were actively engaged by the company, but this was after the phenomenon was already firmly established.

Mac users would meet at the European [[Apple Expo]] and the San Francisco [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo]] trade shows where Apple traditionally introduced new products each year to the industry and public until Apple pulled out of both events.

{{Comparison of Apple Inc. logos}}
Apple's first logo, Wayne, depicts [[Sir Isaac Newton]] sitting under an apple tree.

Almost immediately, though, this was replaced by [[Rob Janoff]]'s &quot;rainbow Apple&quot;, the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the &quot;bitten&quot; logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. While Jobs liked the logo, he insisted it be in color to humanize the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2003/09/60597|title=Wired News: Apple Doin' the Logo-Motion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zlok.net/blog/2009/03/29/i-invented-the-apple-logo/|title=ZLOK Logo Design Blog: I Invented&amp;nbsp;... the Apple Logo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple logo was designed with a bite so that it wouldn't be recognized as another fruit. The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the monitor could reproduce images in color.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativebits.org/interview/interview_rob_janoff_designer_apple_logo|title= Interview with Rob Janoff, designer of the Apple logo|first=Ivan|last=Raszl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to [[Alan Turing]], with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html |title=Logos that became legends: Icons from the world of advertising|work= The Independent |publisher=www.independent.co.uk |accessdate=September 14, 2009 | location=London | date=January 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://replay.web.archive.org/20050314132032/http://www.unisourcedesign.ca/en/archive_design_technology.html_1.html|title=Archived Interview with Rob Janoff | date=March 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the designer of the logo and the company deny that there is any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Leavitt|2007|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, with the roll-out of the new iMac, Apple discontinued the rainbow theme and began to use monochromatic themes, nearly identical in shape to its previous rainbow incarnation, on various products, packaging and advertising. An [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]]-themed version of the monochrome logo was used from 2001–2003, and a Glass-themed version has been used since 2003.

In the past, Apple Inc. has had trademark issues between themselves and [[Apple Corps|Apple Corps ltd.]], a multimedia company started by [[the Beatles]] in 1967, involving their name and logo. This resulted in a [[Apple Corps v Apple Computer|series of lawsuits]] and tension between the two companies. These issues finally ended with their most recent law suit in 2007.

Apple's first slogan, &quot;[[Byte]] into an Apple&quot;, was coined in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Apple Company| work = Operating System Documentation Project| publisher = Operating System Documentation Project| date = December 10, 2007| url = http://www.operating-system.org/betriebssystem/_english/fa-apple.htm| accessdate = August 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1997–2002, Apple used the slogan [[Think Different]] in [[advertising campaign]]s. The slogan had a lasting impact on their image and revived their popularity with the media and customers, and the grammar caused a bit of discussion (i.e. &quot;think&quot; is a verb, which is modified by adverbs; therefore the adverb &quot;differently&quot; should be used, not the adjective &quot;different&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.macrumors.com/archive/index.php/t-21668.html MacRumors.com. &quot;think different or think differently?&quot;] Retrieved November 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In 2006, the ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' reported that [[sweatshop]] conditions existed in some factories in China, where the contract manufacturers, [[Foxconn]] and [[Inventec]], operate the factories that produce the iPod.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |url=http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-401234/The-stark-reality-iPods-Chinese-factories.html |title=The Stark Reality of iPod's Chinese Factories |publisher=Mail Online |date=August 18, 2006 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article stated that one complex of factories that assembles the iPod (among other items), for instance, had over 200,000 workers that lived and worked in the factory, with employees regularly working more than 60 hours per week. The article also reported that workers made around $100 per month and were required to live on the premises and pay for rent and food from the company, which generally amounted to a little over half of workers' earnings.&lt;ref name=&quot;wpsweatshop&quot;&gt;{{Cite document |last=Musgrove |first=Mike |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/15/AR2006061501898.html |title=Sweatshop Conditions at IPod Factory Reported |publisher=The Washington Post |date=June 16, 2006 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |last=Kahney |first=Leander |url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2006/06/71138 |title=Judging Apple Sweatshop Charge |publisher=Wired |date=June 13, 2006 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: last=Jason |last=Dean |url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB118677584137994489.html?mod=blog |title=The Forbidden City of Terry Gou |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=August 11, 2007 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Joel|title=Where the Workers Who Made Your iPhone Sleep at Night|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/11/foxconn-photo-gallery/?pid=731&amp;viewall=true|publisher=Wired|accessdate=13 November 2010|date=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the allegations, Apple launched an investigation and worked with their [[manufacture]]rs to ensure that conditions were acceptable to Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |last=Morphy |first=Ericka |url=http://www.macnewsworld.com/story/61454.html |title=Apple, IT and the Specter of Sweatshop Labor |publisher=Mac New World |date=January 31, 2008 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding [[worker's rights]], slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply.

'''Aberdeenshire''' ({{lang-gd|Siorrachd Obar Dheathain}}, {{lang-sco|Aiberdeenshire}}) is one of the 32 [[unitary authority|unitary]] [[council areas]] in [[Scotland]] and a [[lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy area]]. 

The present day Aberdeenshire council area does not include the [[City of Aberdeen]], now a separate council area, from which its name derives. Together, the modern council area and the city formed historic Aberdeenshire - one of the [[counties of Scotland]] formerly used for local government purposes. Within these borders, the '''County of Aberdeen''' remains in existence as a [[registration county]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ros.gov.uk/pdfs/map.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Aberdeenshire Council is headquartered at Woodhill House, in [[Aberdeen]]; the only Scottish council whose headquarters are based outwith its area's border. Aberdeenshire borders [[Angus]] and [[Perth and Kinross]] to the south, and [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] and [[Moray]] to the west.

==History==
Aberdeenshire has a rich prehistoric and historic heritage.  It is the locus of a large number of [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] archaeological sites, including [[Longman Hill]], [[Kempstone Hill]], [[Catto Long Barrow]] and [[Cairn Lee]].  Since [[medieval]] times there have been a number of crossings of the [[Mounth]] (a spur of mountainous land that extends from the higher inland range to the [[North Sea]] slightly north of [[Stonehaven]]) through present day Aberdeenshire from the Scottish Lowlands to the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]].  Some of the most well known and historically important [[trackway]]s are the [[Causey Mounth]] and [[Elsick Mounth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[W. Douglas Simpson]], &quot;The Early Castles of Mar&quot;, Proceedings of the Society, 102, 10 December 1928&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18037 C.Michael Hogan, ''Elsick Mounth'', Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham]&lt;/ref&gt;

The present council area is named after the historic [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|county of Aberdeen]], which had different boundaries and was abolished in 1975 under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]].  It was replaced by [[Grampian Region|Grampian Regional Council]] and five district councils: [[Banff and Buchan]], [[Gordon, Scotland|Gordon]], [[Kincardine and Deeside]], [[Moray]] and the [[City of Aberdeen]].  Local government functions were shared between the two levels.  In 1996, under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], the Banff and Buchan district, Gordon district and Kincardine and Deeside district were merged to form the present Aberdeenshire council area, with the other two districts becoming autonomous council areas.

==Demographics==
The council area has a population of 226,871, representing 4.5% of Scotland's total, and a 20% increase since 1981, 50% since 1971. The ten largest towns in Aberdeenshire (with 2004 population estimates)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/index.html General Register Office for Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt; are:

*[[Peterhead]] (17,560)
*[[Fraserburgh]] (12,150)
*[[Inverurie]] (10,760)
*[[Stonehaven]] (10,160)
*[[Westhill, Aberdeenshire|Westhill]] (10,060)
*[[Ellon, Aberdeenshire|Ellon]] (9,540)
*[[Portlethen]] (6,770)
*[[Banchory]] (6,270)
*[[Turriff]] (5,500)
*[[Huntly]]  (4,460)

The population has a higher proportion of younger age groups than the rest of Scotland, reflecting employment-driven immigration in recent decades.

==Governance and politics==
{{Out of date|date=November 2010}}

The council has 68 [[councillor]]s, elected in 19 multi-member wards by [[Single Transferable Vote]]. The 2007 elections resulted in the following representation:

'''Aztlan Underground''' is a fusion band from [[Los Angeles]]. Since early 1989, [[Aztlan]] Underground has played [[Rapcore]]. Indigenous drums, flutes, and rattles are commonplace in its musical compositions.

This unique sound is the backdrop for the band's message of dignity for indigenous people, all of humanity, and Earth. Aztlan Underground has been cultivating a grass roots audience across the country, which has become a large and loyal underground following. Their music includes spoken word pieces and elements of punk, hip hop, rock, funk, jazz, and indigenous music, among others.

The artists are Chenek &quot;DJ Bean&quot; (turntables, samples and percussion), Yaotl (vocals, indigenous percussion), Joe &quot;Peps&quot; (bass, rattles), Alonzo Beas (guitars, synth), Caxo (drums, indigenous percussion), and Bulldog (vocals, flute).

Aztlan Underground appeared on television on [[Culture Clash]] on Fox in 1993, was part of ''Breaking Out'', a concert on pay per view in 1998, and was featured in the independent films ''Algun Dia'' and ''Frontierlandia''.

The band has been mentioned or featured in various newspapers and magazines: the [[Vancouver Sun]], [[Northshore News]] (Vancouver, Canada newspaper), [[New Times]] (Los Angeles weekly entertainment newspaper), BLU Magazine (underground hip hop magazine), [[BAM Magazine]] (Southern California), [[La Banda Elastica Magazine]], and the [[Los Angeles Times]] Calendar section. It is also the subject of a chapter in ''It's Not About A Salary'', by Brian Cross. They also opened for [[Rage Against the Machine]] in Mexico City.

It was nominated in the New Times 1998 &quot;Best Latin Influenced&quot; category, the BAM Magazine 1999 &quot;Best Rock en Español&quot; category, and the [[LA Weekly]] 1999 &quot;Best Hip Hop&quot; category.

Aztlan Underground were signed to a Basque record label in 1999 which enabled them to tour Spain extensively and perform in France and Portugal.

Other parts of the world that Aztlan Underground have performed include Canada, Australia, and Venezuela.

The band completed their third album and released it exclusively digital on August 29, 2009. The band is set to begin writing a new record this year.

Aztlan Underground were nominated for four Native American Music Award categories for the Nammys 2010. See Nammys.com

The '''American Civil War''' (1861–1865) was a [[civil war]] in the [[United States of America]]. Eleven [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[slave state]]s declared their [[secession]] from the United States and formed the [[Confederate States of America]], also known as &quot;the Confederacy&quot;. Led by [[Jefferson Davis]], the Confederacy fought for its independence from the United States. The U.S. federal government was supported by twenty mostly-Northern [[Free state (United States)|free states]] in which slavery already had been abolished, and by five slave states that became known as the [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]]. These twenty-five states, referred to as the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], had a much larger base of population and industry than the South. After four years of bloody, devastating warfare (mostly within the Southern states), the Confederacy surrendered and slavery was outlawed everywhere in the nation. The restoration of the Union, and the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction Era]] that followed, dealt with issues that remained unresolved for generations.

In the [[United States presidential election, 1860|presidential election of 1860]], the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], led by [[Abraham Lincoln]], had campaigned against the expansion of slavery beyond the states in which it already existed. The Republicans were strong advocates of nationalism and in their 1860 platform explicitly denounced threats of disunion as avowals of treason. After a Republican victory, but before the new administration took office on March 4, 1861, seven cotton states declared their [[Secession in the United States|secession]] and joined together to form the Confederate States of America. Both the outgoing administration of President [[James Buchanan]] and the incoming administration rejected the legality of secession, considering it rebellion. The other eight slave states rejected calls for secession at this point. No country in the world recognized the Confederacy.

Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation]] at [[Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]]. Lincoln responded by calling for a volunteer army from each state to recapture federal property. This led to declarations of secession by four more slave states. Both sides raised armies as the Union seized control of the border states early in the war and established a [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] that virtually ended cotton sales on which the South depended for its wealth, and blocked most imports. Land warfare in the East was inconclusive in 1861–62, as the Confederacy beat back Union efforts to capture its capital, Richmond, Virginia. In September 1862, Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] made ending slavery in the South a war goal,&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Williams, &quot;Doing Less and Doing More: The President and the Proclamation—Legally, Militarily and Politically,&quot; in Harold Holzer, ed. ''The Emancipation Proclamation'' (2006) pp. 74–5.
&lt;/ref&gt; and dissuaded the British from intervening.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Jones, ''Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: The Union and Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War'' (1999) p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confederate commander [[Robert E. Lee]] won battles in Virginia, but in 1863 his northward advance was turned back with heavy casualties after the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. To the west, the Union gained control of the [[Mississippi River]] after their [[Siege of Vicksburg|capture]] of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], thereby splitting the Confederacy in two. The Union was able to capitalize on its long-term advantages in men and [[materiel]] by 1864 when [[Ulysses S. Grant]] fought [[Overland Campaign|battles of attrition against Lee]], while Union general [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] captured [[Atlanta]]  and [[Sherman's March to the Sea|marched to the sea]]. Confederate resistance ended after Lee surrendered to Grant at [[Battle of Appomattox Courthouse|Appomattox Court House]] on April 9, 1865.

The American Civil War was one of the earliest true [[industrial warfare|industrial wars]]. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The practices of [[total war]], developed by Sherman in Georgia, and of [[trench warfare]] around Petersburg foreshadowed [[World War I]] in Europe. It remains the deadliest war in [[History of the United States|American history]], resulting in the deaths of 620,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties. Ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years of age died, as did 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=YpAuHGkuIe0C&amp;pg=PA&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Killing ground: photographs of the Civil War and the changing American landscape]''&quot;. John Huddleston (2002). [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]. ISBN 0-8018-6773-8
&lt;/ref&gt;
Victory for the North meant the end of the Confederacy and of [[slavery in the United States]], and strengthened the role of the federal government. The social, political, economic and racial [[Issues of the American Civil War|issues]] of the war decisively shaped the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction era that lasted to 1877]].

The [[Abolitionist movement]] in the United States had roots in the Declaration of Independence. Slavery was banned in the [[Northwest Territory]] with the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787. By 1804 all the Northern states had passed laws to gradually abolish slavery. Congress banned the African slave-trade in 1808, although slavery grew in new states in the deep south. The Union was divided along the [[Mason Dixon Line]] into the North (free of slaves), and the South, where slavery
remained legal.&lt;ref name=hart06&gt;{{cite book

Despite compromises in 1820 and 1850, the slavery issues exploded in the 1850s. Lincoln did not propose federal laws against slavery where it already existed, but he had, in his 1858 [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|House Divided Speech]], expressed a desire to &quot;arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Lincoln, House Divided Speech, Springfield, Illinois, June 16, 1858.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the political battle in the 1850s focused on the expansion of slavery into the newly created territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=F20ZsA5ZeeEC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=Prevent+%22any+of+our+friends+from+demoralizing+themselves%22 |title=Voices from the Gathering Storm: The Coming of the American Civil War |author=Glenn M.

Let either be done, &amp; immediately filibustering and extending slavery recommences. On that point hold firm, as with a chain of steel. – Abraham Lincoln to Elihu B. Washburne, December 13, 1860}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Let there be no compromise on the question of extending slavery. If there be, all our labor is lost, and, ere long, must be done again. The dangerous ground—that into which some of our friends have a hankering to run—is Pop. Sov. Have none of it. Stand firm. The tug has to come, &amp; better now, than any time hereafter. – Abraham Lincoln to Lyman Trumbull, December 10, 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; Both North and South assumed that if slavery could not expand, it would wither and die.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, ''Battle Cry of Freedom,'' pp. 241, 253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Declarations of Causes for: Georgia, Adopted on January 29, 1861; Mississippi, Adopted in 1861 (no exact date found); South Carolina, Adopted on December 24, 1860; Texas, Adopted on February 2, 1861.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New Heresy, Southern Punch, editor John Wilford Overall, September 19, 1864 is one of many references that indicate that the Republican hope of gradually ending slavery was the Southern fear. It said in part, &quot;Our doctrine is this: WE ARE FIGHTING FOR INDEPENDENCE THAT OUR GREAT AND NECESSARY DOMESTIC INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY SHALL BE PRESERVED.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Southern fears of losing control of the federal government to antislavery forces, and Northern resentment of the influence that [[the Slave Power]] already wielded in government, brought the crisis to a head in the late 1850s. Disagreements between [[Abolitionist]]s and others over the morality of slavery, the scope of democracy and the economic merits of [[Free Soil Party|free labor]] versus slave [[plantation]]s caused the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] and &quot;[[Know Nothing|Know-Nothing]]&quot; parties to collapse, and new ones to arise (the [[Free Soil Party]] in 1848, the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]] in 1854, the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union]] in 1860). In 1860, the last remaining national political party, the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]], split along sectional lines.

Northerners ranging from the abolitionist [[William Lloyd Garrison]] to the moderate Republican leader Lincoln&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln's Speech in Chicago, December 10, 1856 in which he said, &quot;We shall again be able not to declare, that 'all States as States, are equal,' nor yet that 'all citizens as citizens are equal,' but to renew the broader, better declaration, including both these and much more, that 'all men are created equal.'&quot;; Also, Lincoln's Letter to Henry L. Pierce, April 6, 1859.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized Jefferson's declaration that [[all men are created equal]]. Lincoln  mentioned this proposition many times, including his 1863 [[Gettysburg Address]].

Almost all the inter-regional crises involved slavery, starting with debates on the [[three-fifths compromise|three-fifths clause]] and a twenty-year extension of the [[African slave trade]] in the Constitutional Convention of 1787. The 1793 invention of the [[cotton gin]] by [[Eli Whitney]] increased by fiftyfold the quantity of cotton that could be processed in a day and greatly increased the demand for slave labor in the South.&lt;ref&gt;The People's Chronology, 1994 by James Trager.&lt;/ref&gt; There was controversy over adding the slave state of [[Missouri]] to the Union that led to the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820. A gag rule prevented discussion in Congress of petitions for ending slavery from 1835–1844, while [[Manifest Destiny]] became an argument for gaining new territories, where slavery could expand. The acquisition of [[Texas]] as a [[slave state]] in 1845 along with territories won as a result of the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–1848) resulted in the [[Compromise of 1850]].&lt;ref&gt;William E. Gienapp, &quot;The Crisis of American Democracy: The Political System and the Coming of the Civil War.&quot; in Boritt ed. ''Why the Civil War Came'' 79–123.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wilmot Proviso]] was an attempt by Northern politicians to exclude slavery from the territories conquered from Mexico. The extremely popular anti-slavery novel [[Uncle Tom's Cabin|''Uncle Tom’s Cabin'']] (1852) by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] greatly increased Northern opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, ''Battle Cry'' pp. 88–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Most of her slave owners are &quot;decent, honorable people, themselves victims&quot; of that institution. Much of her description was based on personal observation, and the descriptions of Southerners; she herself calls them and Legree representatives of different types of masters.;Gerson, ''Harriet Beecher Stowe'', p. 68; Stowe, ''Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin'' (1953) p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:John Brown, The Martyr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] being adored by an enslaved mother and child as he walks to his execution on December 2, 1859.]]
The 1854 [[Ostend Manifesto]] was an unsuccessful Southern attempt to annex [[Cuba]] as a slave state. The [[Second Party System]] broke down after passage of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] in 1854, which replaced the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery with [[popular sovereignty]], allowing the people of a territory to vote for or against slavery. The [[Bleeding Kansas]] controversy over the status of slavery in the [[Kansas Territory]] included massive vote fraud perpetrated by Missouri pro-slavery [[Border Ruffian]]s. Vote fraud led pro-South Presidents [[Franklin Pierce]] and [[James Buchanan]] to attempt to admit Kansas as a slave state. Buchanan supported the pro-slavery [[Lecompton Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;David Potter, The Impending Crisis, pp. 201–204, 299–327.&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence over the status of slavery in Kansas erupted with the [[Wakarusa War]],&lt;ref&gt;David Potter, The Impending Crisis, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sacking of Lawrence]],&lt;ref&gt;David Potter, The Impending Crisis, pp. 208–209.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Preston Brooks#Sumner assault|caning of Republican Charles Sumner by the Southerner Preston Brooks]],&lt;ref&gt;Fox Butterfield; ''All God's Children'' p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Potter, The Impending Crisis, pp. 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pottawatomie Massacre]],&lt;ref&gt;David Potter, The Impending Crisis, pp. 212–213.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Battle of Black Jack]], the [[Battle of Osawatomie]] and the [[Marais des Cygnes massacre]]. The 1857 Supreme Court [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott decision]] allowed slavery in the territories even where the majority opposed slavery, including Kansas.

The [[Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858]] included Northern Democratic leader [[Stephen A. Douglas]]' [[Freeport Doctrine]]. This doctrine was an argument for thwarting the Dred Scott decision that, along with Douglas' defeat of the Lecompton Constitution, divided the Democratic Party between North and South. Northern abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s raid at [[Harpers Ferry Armory]] was an attempt to incite [[slave insurrection]]s in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;David Potter, ''The Impending Crisis,'' pp. 356–384.&lt;/ref&gt; The North-South split in the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in 1860 due to the Southern demand for a slave code for the territories completed polarization of the nation between North and South.

Support for secession was strongly correlated to the number of plantations in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Lipset looked at the secessionist vote in each Southern state in 1860–61. In each state he divided the counties into high, medium or low proportion of slaves. He found that in the 181 high-slavery counties, the vote was 72% for secession. In the 205 low-slavery counties. the vote was only 37% for secession. (And in the 153 middle counties, the vote for secession was in the middle at 60%). Seymour Martin Lipset, ''Political Man: The Social Bases of Politics'' (Doubleday, 1960) p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;  States of the [[Deep South]], which had the greatest concentration of plantations, were the first to secede. The upper South slave states of [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Tennessee]] had fewer plantations and rejected secession until the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] crisis forced them to choose sides. Border states had fewer plantations still and never seceded.&lt;ref&gt;James M. McPherson, ''Battle Cry of Freedom'' 1988 p 242, 255, 282–83. Maps on p. 101 (The Southern Economy) and p. 236 (The Progress of Secession) are also relevant.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Potter, The Impending Crisis, pp. 503–505.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1860 the percentage of Southern families that owned slaves has been estimated to be 43 percent in the lower South, 36 percent in the upper South and 22 percent in the border states that fought mostly for the Union.&lt;ref&gt;James G. Randall and David Donald, '' Civil War and Reconstruction'' (1961) p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Half the owners had one to four slaves. A total of 8000 planters owned 50 or more slaves in 1850 and only 1800 planters owned 100 or more; of the latter, 85% lived in the lower South, as opposed to one percent in the border states.&lt;ref&gt;Randall and Donald, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1860 U.S. census, 393,975 individuals, representing 8 percent of all US families, owned 3,950,528 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil-war.net/pages/1860_census.html 1860 Census Results], The Civil War Home Page.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ninety-five percent of African-Americans lived in the South, comprising one third of the population there as opposed to one percent of the population of the North, chiefly in larger cities like New York and Philadelphia. Consequently, fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, ''Drawn with the Sword,'' p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court decision of 1857 in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' escalated the controversy. [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Roger B. Taney|Roger B. Taney's]] decision said that slaves were &quot;so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;David Potter, The Impending Crisis, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Taney then overturned the [[Missouri Compromise]], which banned slavery in territory north of the 36°30' parallel. He stated, &quot;[T]he Act of Congress which prohibited a citizen from holding and owning [enslaved persons] in the territory of the United States north of the line therein is not warranted by the Constitution and is therefore void.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roger B. Taney: Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857).&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats praised the ''Dred Scott'' decision, but Republicans branded it a &quot;willful perversion&quot; of the Constitution. They argued that if Scott could not legally file suit, the Supreme Court had no right to consider the Missouri Compromise's constitutionality. Lincoln warned that &quot;the next ''Dred Scott'' decision&quot;&lt;ref&gt;First Lincoln Douglas Debate at Ottawa, Illinois August 21, 1858.&lt;/ref&gt; could threaten Northern states with slavery.

Lincoln said, &quot;This question of Slavery was more important than any other; indeed, so much more important has it become that no other national question can even get a hearing just at present.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Lincoln, Speech at New Haven, Conn., March 6, 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; The slavery issue was related to sectional competition for control of the territories,&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Southern demand for a [[Slave codes|slave code]] for the territories was the issue used by Southern politicians to split the Democratic Party in two, which all but guaranteed the election of Lincoln and secession. When secession was an issue, South Carolina planter and state Senator John Townsend said that, &quot;our enemies are about to take possession of the Government, that they intend to rule us according to the caprices of their fanatical theories, and according to the declared purposes of abolishing slavery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Townsend, The Doom of Slavery in the Union, its Safety out of it, October 29, 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar opinions were expressed throughout the South in editorials, political speeches and declarations of reasons for secession. Even though Lincoln had no plans to outlaw slavery where it existed, whites throughout the South expressed fears for the future of slavery.

Southern concerns included not only economic loss but also fears of racial equality.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Potter, The Impending Crisis, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William C. Davis, Look Away, pp. 130–140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William W. Freehling, The Road to Disunion, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The Texas Declaration of Causes for Secession&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas12&quot;&gt;A Declaration of the Causes which Impel the State of Texas to Secede from the Federal Union, February 2, 1861 – [http://www2.tsl.state.tx.us/ref/abouttx/secession/2feb1861.html A declaration of the causes which impel the State of Texas to secede from the Federal Union.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AvalonProject&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Winkler |first=E |title=A Declaration of the Causes which Impel the State of Texas to Secede from the Federal Union. |publisher=Journal of the Secession Convention of Texas |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_texsec.asp |accessdate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that the non-slave-holding states were &quot;proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color&quot;, and that the African race &quot;were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race&quot;. Alabama secessionist [[Edmund Strother Dargan|E. S. Dargan]] warned that whites and free blacks could not live together; if slaves were emancipated and remained in the South, &quot;we ourselves would become the executioners of our own slaves. To this extent would the policy of our Northern enemies drive us; and thus would we not only be reduced to poverty, but what is still worse, we should be driven to crime, to the commission of sin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Speech of E. S. Dargan to the Secession Convention of Alabama, January 11, 1861, in [[s:E.S. Dargan on Secession|Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1830s, the US [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] refused to allow mail which carried abolition pamphlets to the South.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger ''Age of Jackson'', p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Northern teachers suspected of any tinge of [[abolitionism]] were expelled from the South, and abolitionist literature was banned. Southerners rejected the denials of Republicans that they were abolitionists.&lt;ref&gt;David Brion Davis, ''Inhuman Bondage'' (2006) p 197, 409; Stanley Harrold, ''The Abolitionists and the South, 1831–1861'' (1995) p. 62; Jane H. and William H. Pease, &quot;Confrontation and Abolition in the 1850s&quot; ''Journal of American History'' (1972) 58(4): 923–937.&lt;/ref&gt;
The North felt threatened as well, for as [[Eric Foner]] concludes, &quot;Northerners came to view slavery as the very antithesis of the good society, as well as a threat to their own fundamental values and interests.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner. ''Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party Before the Civil War'' (1970), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1850s, slaves left the [[border states (Civil War)|border states]] through sale, [[manumission]] and escape, and border states also had more free African-Americans and European immigrants than the lower South, which increased Southern fears that slavery was threatened with rapid extinction in this area.  Such fears greatly increased Southern efforts to make [[Kansas]] a slave state. By 1860, the number of white border state families owning slaves plunged to only 16 percent of the total. Slaves sold to lower South states were owned by a smaller number of wealthy slave owners as the price of slaves increased.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Freehling, The Road to Disunion: Secessionists Triumphant 1854–1861, pp. 9–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Lincoln agreed to the [[Corwin Amendment]], which would have protected slavery in existing states, secessionists claimed that such guarantees were meaningless. Besides the loss of Kansas to free soil Northerners, secessionists feared that the loss of slaves in the border states would lead to emancipation, and that upper South slave states might be the next dominoes to fall. They feared that Republicans would use patronage to incite slaves and antislavery Southern whites such as [[Hinton Rowan Helper]]. Then slavery in the lower South, like a &quot;scorpion encircled by fire, would sting itself to death.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Freehling&quot;&gt;William W. Freehling, The Road to Disunion, Secessionists Triumphant, pp. 269–462, p. 274 (The quote about slave states &quot;encircled by fire&quot; is from the ''New Orleans Delta'', May 13, 1860).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Chandra Manning, both [[Union Army|Union]] and [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] soldiers who did the actual fighting believed slavery to be the cause of the Civil War.  A majority of Confederate soldiers fought to protect slavery, which they viewed as an integral part of southern economy, [[culture]], and manhood.  Union soldiers believed the primary reason for the war was to bring [[emancipation]] to the slaves.  However, many Union soldiers did not fully endorse the idea of shedding their own blood for [[African American]] slaves, whom they viewed as inferior.  Manning's research involved reading military camp newspapers and personal correspondence between soldiers and families during the Civil War.  Manning stated that the primary debate in Confederate states over secession was not over state rights, but rather &quot;the power of the federal government to affect the institution of [[slavery]], specifically limiting it in newly added territories.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |last=Eskridge |first=Larry |title=After 150 years, we still ask: Why ‘this cruel war’?. |url=http://www.cantondailyledger.com/topstories/x1868081570/After-150-years-we-still-ask-Why-this-cruel-war |newspaper=Canton Daily Ledger |location=Canton, Illinois |date=Jan 29, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sectionalism===
[[Sectionalism]] refers to the different economies, social structure, customs and political values of the North and South.&lt;ref&gt;Charles S. Sydnor, ''The Development of Southern Sectionalism 1819–1848'' (1948)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Royal Russel, ''Economic Aspects of Southern Sectionalism, 1840–1861'' (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; It increased steadily between 1800 and 1860 as the North, which phased slavery out of existence, industrialized, urbanized and built prosperous farms, while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor, together with subsistence farming for the poor whites.  The South expanded into rich new lands in the Southwest (from Alabama to Texas).&lt;ref&gt;Adam Rothman, ''Slave Country: American Expansion and the Origins of the Deep South'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, slavery declined in the border states and could barely survive in cities and industrial areas (it was fading out in cities such as Baltimore, Louisville and St. Louis), so a South based on slavery was rural and non-industrial. On the other hand, as the demand for  cotton grew the price of slaves soared. Historians have debated whether economic differences between the industrial Northeast and the agricultural South helped cause the war. Most historians now disagree with the [[economic determinism]] of historian [[Charles A. Beard|Charles Beard]] in the 1920s and emphasize that Northern and Southern economies were largely complementary.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Stampp, ''The Imperiled Union: Essays on the Background of the Civil War'' (1981) p 198; Woodworth, ed. ''The American Civil War: A Handbook of Literature and Research'' (1996), 145 151 505 512 554 557 684; Richard Hofstadter, ''The Progressive Historians: Turner, Beard, Parrington'' (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

Fears of slave revolts and abolitionist propaganda made the South militantly hostile to abolitionism.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Eaton, ''Freedom of Thought in the Old South'' (1940)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Hope Franklin, ''The Militant South 1800–1861'' (1956).&lt;/ref&gt; Southerners complained that it was the North that was changing, and was prone to new &quot;isms&quot;, while the South remained true to historic [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]] of the Founding Fathers (many of whom owned slaves, including Washington, Jefferson and Madison). Lincoln said that Republicans were following the tradition of the framers of the Constitution (including the [[Northwest Ordinance]] and the [[Missouri Compromise]]) by preventing expansion of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Lincoln, Cooper Union Address, New York, February 27, 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of accepting slavery (in the guise of rejecting slave-owning bishops and missionaries) split the largest religious denominations (the [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Baptist]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] churches) into separate Northern and Southern denominations.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People'' (1972) pp 648–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Industrialization meant that seven European immigrants out of eight settled in the North. The movement of twice as many whites leaving the South for the North as vice versa contributed to the South's defensive-aggressive political behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;McPhersonExceptionalism&quot;&gt;James McPherson, &quot;Antebellum Southern Exceptionalism: A New Look at an Old Question,&quot; ''Civil War History'' 29 (September 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism and honor===
Nationalism was a powerful force in the early 19th century, with famous spokesmen like [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Daniel Webster]].  While practically all Northerners supported the Union, Southerners were split between those loyal to the entire United States (called &quot;unionists&quot;) and those loyal primarily to the southern region and then the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Potter, &quot;The Historian's Use of Nationalism and Vice Versa,&quot; ''American Historical Review,'' Vol. 67, No. 4 (July 1962), pp. 924–950 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1845246 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[C. Vann Woodward]] said of the latter group, &quot;A great slave society...had grown up and miraculously flourished in the heart of a thoroughly bourgeois and partly puritanical republic. It had renounced its bourgeois origins and elaborated and painfully rationalized its institutional, legal, metaphysical, and religious defenses....When the crisis came it chose to fight. It proved to be the death struggle of a society, which went down in ruins.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;C. Vann Woodward, ''American Counterpoint: Slavery and Racism in the North-South Dialogue'' (1971), p.281.&lt;/ref&gt; Insults to Southern national honor included ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1854)&lt;ref&gt;Bertram Wyatt-Brown, ''The Shaping of Southern Culture: Honor, Grace, and War, 1760s–1880s'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|John Brown]] in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Avery Craven, ''The Growth of Southern Nationalism, 1848–1861'' (1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

While the South moved toward a Southern nationalism, leaders in the North were also becoming more nationally-minded, and rejected any notion of splitting the Union. The Republican national platform of 1860 warned that disunion was treason and would not be tolerated:
:we denounce those threats of disunion...as denying the vital principles of a free government, and as an avowal of contemplated treason, which it is the imperative duty of an indignant people sternly to rebuke and forever silence.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Republican Platform of 1860,&quot; in Kirk H. Porter, and Donald Bruce Johnson, eds. ''National Party Platforms, 1840–1956,'' (University of Illinois Press, 1956) p.32&lt;/ref&gt;   The South ignored the warnings and did not realize how ardently the North would fight to hold the Union together.&lt;ref&gt;Susan-Mary Grant, ''North over South: Northern Nationalism and American Identity in the Antebellum Era'' (2000); Melinda Lawson, ''Patriot Fires: Forging a New American Nationalism in the Civil War North'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===States' rights===
{{Main|States' rights}}
Everyone agreed that states had certain rights—but did those rights carry over when a citizen left that state? The Southern position was that citizens of every state had the right to take their property anywhere in the U.S. and not have it taken away—specifically they could bring their slaves anywhere and they would remain slaves. Northerners rejected this &quot;right&quot; because it would violate the right of a free state to outlaw slavery within its borders.  Republicans committed to ending the expansion of slavery were among those opposed to any such right to bring slaves and slavery into the free states and territories.  The [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott]] Supreme Court decision of 1857 bolstered the Southern case within territories, and angered the North.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forrest McDonald 2002&quot;&gt;Forrest McDonald, ''States' Rights and the Union: Imperium in Imperio, 1776–1876'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly the South argued that each state had the right to secede—leave the Union—at any time, that the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] was a &quot;[[compact theory|compact]]&quot; or agreement among the states. Northerners (including President Buchanan) rejected that notion as opposed to the will of the Founding Fathers who said they were setting up a &quot;perpetual union&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forrest McDonald 2002&quot;/&gt; Historian James McPherson writes concerning states' rights and other non-slavery explanations:

{{quote|While one or more of these interpretations remain popular among the Sons of Confederate Veterans and other Southern heritage groups, few professional historians now subscribe to them. Of all these interpretations, the state's-rights argument is perhaps the weakest. It fails to ask the question, state's rights for what purpose? State's rights, or sovereignty, was always more a means than an end, an instrument to achieve a certain goal more than a principle.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, This Mighty Scourge, pp. 3–9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Slave power and free soil issues===
{{Main|Slave Power}}
Antislavery forces in the North identified the &quot;Slave Power&quot; as a direct threat to [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]]. They argued that rich slave owners were using political power to take control of the Presidency, Congress and the Supreme Court, thus threatening the rights of the citizens of the North.&lt;ref&gt;Before 1850, slave owners controlled the presidency for fifty years, the Speaker's chair for forty-one years, and the chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee that set tariffs for forty-two years, while 18 of 31 Supreme Court justices owned slaves. Leonard L. Richards, ''The Slave Power: The Free North and Southern Domination, 1780–1860'' (2000)  pp. 1–9&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Free soil&quot; was a Northern demand that the new lands opening up in the west be available to independent [[yeoman]] farmers and not be bought out by rich slave owners who would buy up the best land and work it with slaves, forcing the white farmers onto marginal lands. This was the basis of the [[Free Soil Party]] of 1848, and a main theme of the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party before the Civil War'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  Free Soilers and Republicans demanded a [[Homestead Act|homestead law]] that would give government land to settlers; it was defeated by Southerners who feared it would attract to the west European immigrants and poor Southern whites.&lt;ref&gt;Charles C. Bolton, ''Poor Whites of the Antebellum South: Tenants and Laborers in Central North Carolina and Northeast Mississippi'' (1993) p 67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tariffs===
{{Main|Tariffs in United States history}}

The [[Tariff of 1828]] was a high protective [[tariff]] or tax on imports passed by Congress in 1828. It was labeled the &quot;Tariff of Abominations&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/highlights.html?action=view&amp;intID=45], [[Office of the Clerk]] [http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/highlights.html?action=view&amp;intID=45]&lt;/ref&gt; by its southern detractors because of its effect on the Southern economy. The 1828 tariff was repealed after strong protests and threats of [[Nullification Crisis|nullification]] by South Carolina.

The Democrats in Congress, controlled by Southerners,  wrote the tariff laws in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, and kept reducing rates, so that the 1857 rates were the lowest since 1816.  The South had no complaints but the low rates angered Northern industrialists and factory workers, especially in Pennsylvania, who demanded protection for their growing iron industry.
The Whigs and Republicans favored high tariffs to stimulate industrial growth, and Republicans called for an increase in tariffs in the 1860 election. The increases were finally enacted in 1861 after Southerners resigned their seats in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Taussig, ''The Tariff History of the United States'' (1931), pp 115–61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hofstadter, &quot;The Tariff Issue on the Eve of the Civil War,&quot; ''The American Historical Review'' Vol. 44, No. 1 (Oct., 1938), pp.&amp;nbsp;50–55 [http://www.jstor.org/pss/1840850 full text in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians in recent decades have minimized the tariff issue, noting that few people in 1860–61 said it was of central importance to them.  Some secessionist documents do mention the tariff issue, though not nearly as often as the preservation of slavery.  However, a few [[libertarian]] economists place more importance on the tariff issue.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Thornton and Robert B. Ekelund, Jr., ''Tariffs, Blockades, and Inflation: The Economics of the Civil War'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election of Lincoln===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1860}}
The election of Lincoln in November 1860 was the final trigger for secession.&lt;ref&gt;David Potter, ''The Impending Crisis,'' p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts at compromise, including the &quot;[[Corwin Amendment]]&quot; and the &quot;[[Crittenden Compromise]]&quot;, failed.
Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction. The slave states, which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North. Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven slave states had declared their secession and joined together to form the Confederacy.

===Battle of Fort Sumter===
{{Main|Battle of Fort Sumter}}
The Lincoln Administration, just as the outgoing Buchanan administration before it, refused to turn over Ft. Sumter—located in the middle of the harbor of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Jefferson Davis ordered the surrender of the fort. Union Maj. Anderson gave a conditional reply which the Confederate government rejected, and Davis ordered Beauregard to attack the fort before a relief expedition could arrive. After a heavy bombardment on April 12–13, 1861 (with no intentional casualties), the fort surrendered. On April 15, Lincoln then called for 75,000 troops from the states to recapture the fort and other federal property.&lt;ref&gt;http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/lincoln-declares-war/&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than furnish troops and access for an attack on their fellow southern states, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas elected to join them in secession.  North and South the response to Ft. Sumter was an overwhelming demand for war to uphold national honor. Only Kentucky tried to remain neutral. Hundreds of thousands of young men across the land rushed to enlist.&lt;ref&gt;Maury Klein, ''Days of Defiance: Sumter, Secession, and the Coming of the Civil War'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secession of South Carolina===
South Carolina [[History of South Carolina#Antebellum South Carolina|did more to advance nullification and secession than any other Southern state]]. South Carolina adopted the &quot;[[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union]]&quot; on December 24, 1860. It argued for states' rights for slave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in the North in the form of opposition to the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution. All the alleged violations of the rights of Southern states were related to slavery.

===Secession winter===
Before Lincoln took office, seven states had declared their secession from the Union. They established a Southern government, the Confederate States of America on February 4, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; They took control of federal forts and other properties within their boundaries with little resistance from outgoing President [[James Buchanan]], whose term ended on March 4, 1861. Buchanan said that the [[Dred Scott decision]] was proof that the South had no reason for secession, and that the Union &quot;was intended to be perpetual&quot;, but that &quot;the power by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union&quot; was not among the &quot;enumerated powers granted to Congress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29501 President James Buchanan, Message of December 8, 1860 online].&lt;/ref&gt; One quarter of the U.S. Army—the entire garrison in Texas—was surrendered in February 1861 to state forces by its commanding general, [[David E. Twiggs]], who then joined the Confederacy.

As Southerners resigned their seats in the Senate and the House, Republicans were able to pass bills for projects that had been blocked by Southern Senators before the war, including the [[Morrill Tariff]], land grant colleges (the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morill Act]]), a [[Homestead Act]], a transcontinental railroad (the [[Pacific Railway Acts]]), the [[National Banking Act]] and the authorization of [[United States Note]]s by the Legal Tender Act of 1862. The [[Revenue Act of 1861]] introduced the [[income tax]] to help finance the war.

===The Confederacy===
{{Main|Confederate States of America}}
Seven [[Deep South]] cotton states seceded by February 1861, starting with [[South Carolina]], [[Mississippi]], [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Texas]]. These seven states formed the Confederate States of America (February 4, 1861), with [[Jefferson Davis]] as president, and a [[Confederate States Constitution|governmental structure]] closely modeled on the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].

Following the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack on Fort Sumter]], President Lincoln called for a volunteer army from each state. Within two months, four more Southern slave states declared their secession and joined the Confederacy: [[Virginia]], [[Arkansas]], [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]]. The northwestern portion of Virginia subsequently seceded from Virginia, joining the Union as the new state of [[West Virginia]] on June 20, 1863. By the end of 1861, [[Missouri]] and [[Kentucky]] were effectively under Union control, with Confederate state governments in exile.

===The Union states===
{{Main|Union (American Civil War)}}
Twenty-three states remained loyal to the Union: [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maine]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York]], [[Ohio]], [[Oregon]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Vermont]], and [[Wisconsin]]. During the war, [[Nevada]] and [[West Virginia]] joined as new states of the Union. [[Tennessee]] and [[Louisiana]] were returned to Union military control early in the war.

The territories of [[Colorado Territory|Colorado]], [[Dakota Territory|Dakota]], [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]], [[Nevada Territory|Nevada]], [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], [[Utah Territory|Utah]], and [[Washington Territory|Washington]] fought on the Union side. Several slave-holding [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes supported the Confederacy, giving the [[Indian Territory]] (now [[Oklahoma]]) a small, bloody civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Arrell. ''Oklahoma, a History of Five Centuries'' ([[University of Oklahoma]] Press, 1981) pg.&amp;nbsp;117–120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2008-01-28 | url=http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/unindtr.htm | title=United States Volunteers — Indian Troops| work=civilwararchive.com | accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/C/CI013.html| title=Civil War Refugees| work=[[Oklahoma Historical Society]]|publisher=[[Oklahoma State University]] | accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Border states===
{{Main|Border states (American Civil War)}}
The border states in the Union were [[West Virginia]] (which separated from Virginia and became a new state), and four of the five northernmost slave states ([[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[Missouri]], and [[Kentucky]]).

[[Maryland]] had numerous pro-Confederate officials who tolerated anti-Union [[Baltimore riot of 1861|rioting in Baltimore]] and the burning of bridges. Lincoln responded with [[martial law]] and sent in militia units from the North.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, ''Battle Cry,'' pp. 284–287.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Confederate government realized what was happening, Lincoln had seized firm control of Maryland and the District of Columbia, by arresting all the prominent secessionists and holding them without trial (they were later released).

In Missouri, an [[Missouri Constitutional Convention (1861-63)|elected convention]] on secession voted decisively to remain within the Union. When pro-Confederate Governor [[Claiborne Fox Jackson|Claiborne F. Jackson]] called out the state militia, it was attacked by federal forces under General [[Nathaniel Lyon]], who chased the governor and the rest of the State Guard to the southwestern corner of the state. (''See also: [[Missouri secession]]''). In the resulting vacuum, the convention on secession reconvened and took power as the Unionist provisional government of Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, ''The War for the Union'' (1959) 1:119-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Kentucky did not secede; for a time, it declared itself neutral. When Confederate forces entered the state in September 1861, neutrality ended and the state reaffirmed its Union status, while trying to maintain slavery. During a brief invasion by Confederate forces, Confederate sympathizers organized a secession convention, inaugurated a governor, and gained recognition from the Confederacy. The rebel government soon went into exile and never controlled Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, ''The War for the Union'' (1959) 1:129-36&lt;/ref&gt;

After Virginia's secession, a Unionist government in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]] asked 48 counties to vote on an ordinance to create a new state on October 24, 1861. A voter turnout of 34% approved the statehood bill (96% approving).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/History/statehood/statehood10.html |title=A State of Convenience, The Creation of West Virginia |publisher=West Virginia Archives &amp; History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of 24 secessionist counties&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Richard Orr, ''A House Divided, A Study of the Statehood Politics &amp; the Copperhead Movement in West Virginia'', Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1964, map on page 49&lt;/ref&gt;  in the state and the ensuing guerrilla war&lt;ref&gt;Weigley, Russell F., &quot;A Great Civil War, A Military and Political History 1861–1865'', Indiana Univ.

Over 10,000 military engagements took place during the war, 40% of them in Virginia and Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;Gabor Boritt, ed. ''War Comes Again'' (1995) p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Since separate articles deal with every major battle and many minor ones, this article only gives the broadest outline. For more information see [[List of American Civil War battles]] and [[Military leadership in the American Civil War]].

===The beginning of the war, 1861===
{{Details|Battle of Fort Sumter}}
Lincoln's victory in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|presidential election of 1860]] triggered South Carolina's declaration of secession from the Union. By February 1861, six more Southern states made similar declarations. On February 7, the seven states adopted a provisional constitution for the Confederate States of America and established their temporary capital at [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Alabama]]. A pre-war February [[Peace Conference of 1861]] met in Washington in a failed attempt at resolving the crisis. The remaining eight slave states rejected pleas to join the Confederacy. Confederate forces seized most of the federal forts within their boundaries. President Buchanan protested but made no military response apart from a failed attempt to resupply Fort Sumter using the ship ''[[Star of the West]]'', which was fired upon by South Carolina forces and turned back before it reached the fort.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, ''Battle Cry,'' pp. 234–266.
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, governors in Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania quietly began buying weapons and training militia units.

On March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln was sworn in as President. In his [[Inauguration|inaugural address]], he argued that the Constitution was a [[Preamble to the United States Constitution|''more perfect union'']] than the earlier [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]], that it was a binding contract, and called any secession &quot;legally void&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, Monday, March 4, 1861.
&lt;/ref&gt;
He stated he had no intent to invade Southern states, nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed, but that he would use force to maintain possession of federal property. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The South sent delegations to Washington and offered to pay for the federal properties and enter into a peace treaty with the United States. Lincoln rejected any negotiations with Confederate agents because he claimed the Confederacy was not a legitimate government, and that making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government.&lt;ref name=&quot;PotterNegotiations&quot;&gt;David Potter, The Impending Crisis, pp. 572–573.
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Secretary of State [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] engaged in unauthorized and indirect negotiations that failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;PotterNegotiations&quot;/&gt;

[[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia, [[Fort Sumter]] in Charleston, South Carolina, and [[Fort Pickens]], [[Fort Jefferson]], and [[Fort Zachary Taylor|Fort Taylor]], all in Florida, were the remaining Union-held forts in the Confederacy, and Lincoln was determined to hold them all. Under orders from Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]], troops controlled by the Confederate government under [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] bombarded Fort Sumter on April 12, forcing its capitulation. Northerners rallied behind Lincoln's call for all the states to send troops to recapture the forts and to preserve the Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilwarhome.com/lincolntroops.htm |title=Lincoln's Call for Troops}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
citing presidential powers given by the [[Militia Acts of 1792]]. With the scale of the rebellion apparently small so far, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers for 90&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom, p. 274.
&lt;/ref&gt;
For months before that, several Northern governors had discreetly readied their state militias; they began to move forces the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts in the Civil War, William Schouler, 1868 book republished by Digital Scanning Inc, 2003 – See the account at [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1582180016&amp;id=ub8cqVKoXwgC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;vq=baltimore&amp;dq=schouler+massachusetts+civil&amp;sig=g5za9rXjH9ttx1vzmWNN39F3YFQ].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Confederate sympathizers seized [[Liberty Arsenal]] in [[Liberty, Missouri]] on April 20, eight days after Fort Sumter.
On May 3, 1861, Lincoln called for an additional 42,034 volunteers for a period of three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=70123 |title=Proclamation 83 – Increasing the Size of the Army and Navy}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

:
Four states in the upper South (Tennessee, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Virginia), which had repeatedly rejected Confederate overtures, now refused to send forces against their neighbors, declared their secession, and joined the Confederacy. To reward Virginia, the Confederate capital was moved to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 276–307.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The city was the symbol of the Confederacy. Richmond was in a highly vulnerable location at the end of a tortuous Confederate supply line. Although Richmond was heavily fortified, supplies for the city would be reduced by Sherman's capture of [[Atlanta]] and cut off almost entirely when Grant besieged [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] and its railroads that supplied the Southern capital.

===Anaconda Plan and blockade, 1861===
{{Main|Union blockade}}
[[File:Scott-anaconda.jpg|thumb|300px|1861 cartoon of Scott's &quot;[[Anaconda Plan]]&quot;]]

[[Winfield Scott]], the commanding general of the U.S. Army, devised the [[Anaconda Plan]] to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Peskin, ''Winfield Scott and the profession of arms'' (2003) pp 249–52&lt;/ref&gt; His idea was that a [[Union blockade]] of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy; then the capture of the [[Mississippi River]] would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan in terms of a blockade to squeeze to death the Confederate economy, but overruled Scott's warnings that his new army was not ready for an offensive operation because public opinion demanded an immediate attack.&lt;ref&gt;.Timothy D. Johnson, ''Winfield Scott'' (1998) p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1861, Lincoln announced the Union blockade of all Southern ports; commercial ships could not get insurance and regular traffic ended.  The South blundered in embargoing cotton exports in 1861 before the blockade was effective; by the time they realized the mistake it was too late. &quot;King Cotton&quot; was dead, as the South could export less than 10% of its cotton.&lt;ref&gt;Dean B. Mahin, ''One war at a time: the international dimensions of the American Civil War'' (2000) ch 6&lt;/ref&gt;  British investors built small, fast [[blockade runner]]s that traded arms and luxuries brought in from [[Bermuda]], [[Cuba]] and the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]] in return for high-priced cotton and tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, ''Battle Cry,'' pp. 378–380.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the Union Navy seized a blockade runner the ship and cargo were sold and the proceeds given to the Navy sailors; the captured crewmen were mostly British and they were simply released.  The Southern economy nearly collapsed during the war.  Shortages of food and supplies were caused by the blockade, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, foraging by Northern armies, and the impressment of crops by Confederate armies. The standard of living fell even as large-scale printing of paper money caused inflation and distrust of the currency. By 1864 the internal food distribution had broken down, leaving cities without enough food and causing [[Southern Bread Riots|bread riots]] across the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;Heidler, 1651–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 8, 1862, the [[Confederate States Navy|Confederate Navy]] waged a fight against the [[United States Navy|Union Navy]] when the [[Ironclad warship|ironclad]] [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] attacked the blockade. Against wooden ships, she seemed unstoppable. The next day, however, she had to fight the new Union warship [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']] in the [[Battle of Hampton Roads|Battle of the Ironclads]].&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 373–377.&lt;/ref&gt; Their battle ended in a draw. The Confederacy lost the ''Virginia'' when the ship was scuttled to prevent capture, and the Union built many copies of ''Monitor''. Lacking the technology to build effective warships, the Confederacy attempted to obtain warships from Britain. The Union victory at the [[Second Battle of Fort Fisher]] in January 1865 closed the last useful Southern port and virtually ended blockade running.

===Conscription and desertion===
In the first year of the war, both sides had far more volunteers than they could effectively train and equip. After the initial enthusiasm faded, reliance on the cohort of young men who came of age every year and wanted to join was not enough. Both sides used a draft law—[[conscription]]—as a device to encourage or force volunteering; relatively few were actually drafted and served. The Confederacy passed a draft law in April 1862 for young men aged 18 to 35; overseers of slaves, government officials, and clergymen were exempt.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Burton Moore. ''Conscription and Conflict in the Confederacy'' (1924) [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=10517499 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Congress followed in July, authorizing a militia draft within a state when it could not meet its quota with volunteers. 

When the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect in January 1863, ex-slaves were energetically recruited by the states, and used to meet the state quotas. States and local communities offered higher and higher cash bonuses for white volunteers. Congress tightened the law in March 1863.  Men selected in the draft could provide substitutes or, until mid-1864, pay commutation money. Many eligibles pooled their money to cover the cost of anyone drafted.  Families used the substitute provision to select which man should go into the army and which should stay home. There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft, especially in Catholic areas. The great [[New York Draft Riots|draft riot in New York City in July 1863]] involved Irish immigrants who had been signed up as citizens to swell the machine vote, not realizing it made them liable for the draft.&lt;ref&gt;Barnet Schecter, ''The Devil's Own Work: The Civil War Draft Riots and the Fight to Reconstruct America'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the 168,649 men procured for the Union through the draft, 117,986 were substitutes, leaving only 50,663 who had their personal services conscripted.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Murdock, ''One million men: the Civil War draft in the North'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

North and South, the draft laws were highly unpopular.  An estimated 120,000 men evaded conscription in the North, many of them fleeing to Canada, and another 280,000 Northern soldiers deserted during the war,&lt;ref&gt;Mark Johnson, ''That body of brave men: the U.S. regular infantry and the Civil War in the West'' (2003) p 575
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C0CE0D91630E033A2575BC2A9639C94659ED7CF]&quot;Desertion No Bar to Pension&quot;, New York Times, May 28, 1894&lt;/ref&gt; along with at least 100,000 Southerners, or about 10% all together.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Weitz, ''More Damning than Slaughter: Desertion in the Confederate Army'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, desertion was a very common event in the 19th century; in the peacetime Army about 15% of the soldiers deserted every year.&lt;ref&gt;Edward M. Coffman, ''The Old Army: A Portrait of the American Army in Peacetime, 1784–1898'' (1986) p 193
&lt;/ref&gt; In the South, many men deserted temporarily to take care of their families, then returned to their units.&lt;ref&gt;Ella Lonn, ''Desertion during the Civil War'' (1928) pp205-6&lt;/ref&gt;  In the North, &quot;bounty jumpers&quot; enlisted to get the generous bonus, deserted, then went back to a second recruiting station under a different name to sign up again for a second bonus; 141 were caught and executed.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fantina, ''Desertion and the American soldier, 1776–2006'' (2006) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern theater 1861–1863===
{{Details|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War}}
[[File:CivilWarFifeandDrum.jpg|thumb|left|A Union Regimental Fife and Drum Corps]]

Because of the fierce resistance of a few initial Confederate forces at [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]], [[Virginia]], in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Irvin McDowell]] on the Confederate forces there was halted in the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], or ''First Manassas'',&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 339–345.&lt;/ref&gt; McDowell's troops were forced back to [[Washington, D.C.]], by the Confederates under the command of Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[P. G. T. Beauregard]]. It was in this battle that Confederate General [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas Jackson]] received the [[nickname]] of &quot;Stonewall&quot; because he stood like a stone wall against Union troops.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alarmed at the loss, and in an attempt to prevent more slave states from leaving the Union, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Crittenden-Johnson Resolution]] on July 25 of that year, which stated that the war was being fought to preserve the Union and not to end slavery.

Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] took command of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. [[Henry Wager Halleck|Henry W. Halleck]]), and the war began in earnest in 1862. Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] and [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], southeast of Richmond. Although McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the [[Peninsula Campaign]],&lt;ref&gt;Shelby Foote, The Civil War: Fort Sumter to Perryville, pp. 464–519.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Catton, Terrible Swift Sword, pp. 263–296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 424–427.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sherman Grant Sheridan 1937 Issue-3c.jpg|240px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Generals Sherman, Grant &amp; Sheridan&lt;/center&gt;&lt;center&gt;[[US Presidents on US postage stamps#Ulysses S. Grant|Issue of 1937]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Generals Lee and Jackson-1937 Issue-4c.jpg|thumb|240px|&lt;center&gt;Generals [[Robert E. Lee|Lee]] and [[Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson|Jackson]]&lt;/center&gt;&lt;center&gt;[[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States|Issue of 1937]]&lt;/center&gt;]] [[Joseph E. Johnston|Johnston]] halted his advance at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], then General [[Robert E. Lee]] and top subordinates [[James Longstreet]] and Stonewall Jackson&lt;ref name = &quot;ryywpm&quot;&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 538–544.&lt;/ref&gt; defeated McClellan in the [[Seven Days Battles]] and forced his retreat. The [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], which included the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], ended in yet another victory for the South.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 528–533.&lt;/ref&gt; McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope's]] Union [[Army of Virginia]], which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.

Emboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North. General Lee led 45,000 men of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] across the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the [[Battle of Antietam]]&lt;ref name = &quot;ryywpm&quot;/&gt; near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]], [[Maryland]], on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 543–545.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it. Antietam is considered a Union victory because it halted Lee's invasion of the North and provided an opportunity for Lincoln to announce his [[Emancipation Proclamation]].&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, p. 557–558.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the cautious McClellan failed to follow up on Antietam, he was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Burnside was soon defeated at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 571–574.&lt;/ref&gt; on December 13, 1862, when over 12 thousand Union soldiers were killed or wounded during repeated futile frontal assaults against Marye's Heights. After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]].[[File:Conf dead chancellorsville edit1.jpg|thumb|left|Confederate dead behind the stone wall of Marye's Heights, Fredericksburg, Virginia, killed during the Battle of Chancellorsville, May 1863]] Hooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army; despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one, he was humiliated in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]]&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 639–645.&lt;/ref&gt; in May 1863. He was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[George Meade]] during Lee's second invasion of the North, in June. Meade defeated Lee at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, ''Battle Cry,'' pp. 653–663.&lt;/ref&gt; (July 1 to July 3, 1863). This was the bloodiest battle of the war, and has been called the war's [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]]. [[Pickett's Charge]] on July 3 is often considered the [[high-water mark of the Confederacy]] because it signaled the collapse of serious Confederate threats of victory.   Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000).&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, ''Battle Cry of Freedom,'' p. 664.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat, and after Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln turned to the Western Theater for new leadership.  At the same time the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg surrendered, giving the Union control of the Mississippi River, permanently isolating the western Confederacy, and producing the new leader Lincoln needed, [[Ulysses S. Grant]].

===Western theater 1861–1863===
{{Details|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}
While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern Theater, they were defeated many times in the West. They were driven from Missouri early in the war as a result of the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 404–405.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonidas Polk]]'s invasion of [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]], [[Kentucky]] ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned that state against the Confederacy. [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and central [[Tennessee]] fell to the Union early in 1862, leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization.
[[File:Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Chickamauga was one of the deadliest battles in the Western Theater.]]
The [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] was opened to Union traffic to the southern border of Tennessee with the taking of [[Battle of Island Number Ten|Island No. 10]] and [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]], [[Missouri]], and then [[Memphis, Tennessee]].  In April 1862, the [[Union Navy]] captured [[New Orleans]]&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 418–420.&lt;/ref&gt; without a major fight, which allowed Union forces to begin moving up the Mississippi. Only the fortress city of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], [[Mississippi]], prevented Union control of the entire river.

General [[Braxton Bragg]]'s second Confederate invasion of Kentucky ended with a meaningless victory over Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]] at the [[Battle of Perryville]],&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 419–420.&lt;/ref&gt; although Bragg was forced to end his attempt at invading Kentucky and retreat due to lack of support for the Confederacy in that state. Bragg was narrowly defeated by Maj. Gen. [[William Rosecrans]] at the [[Battle of Stones River]]&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 480–483.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tennessee]].

The one clear Confederate victory in the West was the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]. Bragg, reinforced by Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]]'s corps (from Lee's army in the east), defeated Rosecrans, despite the heroic defensive stand of Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas]]. Rosecrans retreated to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], which Bragg then besieged.

The Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who won victories at Forts [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]] (by which the Union seized control of the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] Rivers); [[Battle of Shiloh|the Battle of Shiloh]];&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 405–413.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Siege of Vicksburg|Battle of Vicksburg]],&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 637–638.&lt;/ref&gt; which cemented Union control of the Mississippi River and is considered one of the [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning points]] of the war. Grant marched to the relief of Rosecrans and defeated Bragg at the [[Chattanooga Campaign|Third Battle of Chattanooga]],&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 677–680.&lt;/ref&gt; driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee and opening a route to Atlanta and the heart of the Confederacy.

===Trans-Mississippi theater 1861–1865===
{{Details|Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War}}
[[Guerrilla warfare|Guerrilla]] activity turned much of Missouri into a battleground. Missouri had, in total, the third-most battles of any state during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;MissFacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil War in Missouri Facts|url=http://home.usmo.com/~momollus/MOFACTS.HTM|year=1998|accessdate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other states of the west, though geographically isolated from the battles to the east, saw numerous small-scale military actions. Battles in the region served to secure [[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]], [[Indian Territory in the American Civil War|Indian Territory]], and [[New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War|New Mexico Territory]] for the Union. Confederate incursions into [[New Mexico territory]] were repulsed in 1862 and a Union campaign to secure [[Indian Territory]] succeeded in 1863. Late in the war, the Union's [[Red River Campaign]] was a failure. Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war, but was cut off from the rest of the Confederacy after the capture of Vicksburg in 1863 gave the Union control of the Mississippi River.

===Conquest of Virginia and end of war: 1864–1865===

At the beginning of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of [[total war]] and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would bring an end to the war.&lt;ref&gt;Mark E. Neely Jr.; &quot;Was the Civil War a Total War?&quot; ''Civil War History'', Vol. 50, 2004 pp 434+&lt;/ref&gt; This was total war not in terms of killing civilians but rather in terms of destroying homes, farms, and railroads. Grant devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the entire Confederacy from multiple directions. Generals George Meade and [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] were ordered to move against Lee near Richmond, General [[Franz Sigel]] (and later [[Philip Sheridan]]) were to [[Valley Campaigns of 1864|attack the Shenandoah Valley]], General Sherman was to capture [[Atlanta]] and march to the sea (the Atlantic Ocean), Generals [[George Crook]] and [[William W. Averell]] were to operate against railroad supply lines in [[West Virginia]], and Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel Prentice Banks|Nathaniel P. Banks]] was to capture [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]].

Union forces in the East attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles during that phase (&quot;Grant's [[Overland Campaign]]&quot;) of the Eastern campaign. Grant's [[attrition warfare|battles of attrition]] at the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]], and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 724–735.&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in heavy Union losses, but forced Lee's Confederates to fall back repeatedly. An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign|Bermuda Hundred]] river bend. Grant was tenacious and, despite astonishing losses (over 65,000 casualties in seven weeks),&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom, pp. 741–742.&lt;/ref&gt; kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. He pinned down the Confederate army in the [[Siege of Petersburg]], where the two armies engaged in [[trench warfare]] for over nine months.

Grant finally found a commander, General [[Philip Sheridan]], aggressive enough to prevail in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal A. Early]] in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the [[Shenandoah Valley]],&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 778–779.&lt;/ref&gt; a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.

Meanwhile, Sherman maneuvered from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[John Bell Hood]] along the way. The [[Battle of Atlanta|fall of Atlanta]] on September 2, 1864, guaranteed the reelection of Lincoln as president.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom, pp. 773–776.&lt;/ref&gt; Hood left the Atlanta area to swing around and menace Sherman's supply lines and invade Tennessee in the [[Franklin-Nashville Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 812–815.&lt;/ref&gt; Union Maj. Gen. [[John Schofield]] defeated Hood at the [[Battle of Franklin (1864)|Battle of Franklin]], and [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas]] dealt Hood a massive defeat at the [[Battle of Nashville]], effectively destroying Hood's army.

Leaving Atlanta, and his base of supplies, Sherman's army marched with an unknown destination, laying waste to about 20% of the farms in Georgia in his &quot;[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]&quot;. He reached the Atlantic Ocean at [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in December 1864. Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves; there were no major battles along the March. Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south,&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 825–830.&lt;/ref&gt; increasing the pressure on Lee's army.

Lee's army, thinned by desertion and casualties, was now much smaller than Grant's. Union forces won a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Five Forks]] on April 1, forcing Lee to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond. The Confederate capital fell&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 846–847.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[XXV Corps (Union Army)|Union XXV Corps]], composed of black troops. The remaining Confederate units fled west and after a defeat at [[Battle of Sayler's Creek|Sayler's Creek]], it became clear to Robert E. Lee that continued fighting against the United States was both tactically and logistically impossible.

On April 14, 1865, President Lincoln was [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|shot]] by [[John Wilkes Booth]], a Southern sympathizer.  Lincoln died early the next morning, and [[Andrew Johnson]] became president. Meanwhile, Confederate forces across the South surrendered as news of Lee's surrender reached them.&lt;ref&gt;Unaware of the surrender of Lee, on April 16 the last major battles of the war were fought at the [[Battle of Columbus, Georgia]] and the [[Battle of West Point]].

==Emancipation during the war==
{{Main|Slavery in the United States}}
At the beginning of the war, some Union commanders thought they were supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters. By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As one Congressman put it, the slaves &quot;...cannot be neutral. As laborers, if not as soldiers, they will be allies of the rebels, or of the Union.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, ''Battle Cry of Freedom'' p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt; The same Congressman—and his fellow Radical Republicans—put pressure on Lincoln to rapidly emancipate the slaves, whereas moderate Republicans came to accept gradual, compensated emancipation and colonization.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, ''Battle Cry'' pp. 355, 494–6, quote from [[George Washington Julian]] on 495.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] and some [[War Democrats]] opposed emancipation, although the latter eventually accepted it as part of [[total war]] needed to save the Union.  The [[Irish American|Irish Catholics]] generally opposed emancipation, and when the draft began in the summer of 1863 they launched [[New York Draft Riots|a major riot in New York City]] that was suppressed by the military, as well as much smaller protests in other cities.&lt;ref&gt;Barnet Schecter, ''The Devil's Own Work: The Civil War Draft Riots and the Fight to Reconstruct America'' (2007), ch 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Catholics in the North had volunteered to fight in 1861, sending thousands of soldiers to the front and taking high casualties, especially at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]]; their volunteering fell off after 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Craig A. Warren, &quot;'Oh, God, What a Pity!': The Irish Brigade at Fredericksburg and the Creation of Myth,&quot; ''Civil War History,'' Sept 2001, Vol. 47 Issue 3, pp 193–221&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861, Lincoln worried that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states, and that &quot;to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln's letter to O. H. Browning, September 22, 1861&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War [[Simon Cameron]] and Generals [[John C. Frémont]] (in Missouri) and [[David Hunter]] (in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida) to keep the loyalty of the border states and the War Democrats.

Lincoln warned the border states that a more radical type of emancipation would happen if his gradual plan based on compensated emancipation and voluntary colonization was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson in  Gabor S. Boritt, ed. ''Lincoln, the War President'' pp. 52–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the District of Columbia accepted Lincoln's gradual plan, which was enacted by Congress. When Lincoln told his cabinet about his proposed emancipation proclamation, Seward advised Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing it, as to do otherwise would seem like &quot;our last shriek on the retreat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen B. Oates, ''Abraham Lincoln: The Man Behind the Myths,'' p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1862 the [[Battle of Antietam]] provided this opportunity, and the subsequent [[War Governors' Conference]] added support for the proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;Images of America: Altoona, by Sr. Anne Francis Pulling, 2001, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln had already published a letter&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Greeley, August 22, 1862&lt;/ref&gt; encouraging the border states especially to accept emancipation as necessary to save the Union. Lincoln later said that slavery was &quot;somehow the cause of the war&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SecondInaugural&quot;&gt;Abraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural Address, March 4, 1865 – Here Lincoln states, &quot;One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln issued his preliminary [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on September 22, 1862, and his final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In his letter to Hodges, Lincoln explained his belief that &quot;If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong ... And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling ... I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln's Letter to A. G. Hodges, April 4, 1864&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Emancipation Proclamation was based on the President's war powers, it only included territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, The War that Never Goes Away&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln also played a leading role in getting Congress to vote for the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]],&lt;ref name=&quot;WhoFreed&quot;&gt;James McPherson, Drawn With the Sword, from the article Who Freed the Slaves?&lt;/ref&gt; which made emancipation universal and permanent.

Enslaved African Americans did not wait for Lincoln's action before escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines. From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in occupied areas like Nashville, Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations. In addition, approximately 180,000 or more African-American men served as soldiers and sailors with Union troops. Most of those were escaped slaves. Probably the most prominent of these African-American soldiers is the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]].
[[Image:Andersonvillesurvivor.jpg|thumb|upright|Union Army soldier on his release from [[Andersonville prison]] in May, 1865. After the war, Henry Wirz, the prison's commandant, was tried for war crimes by a military commission and executed.]]
Confederates enslaved captured black Union soldiers, and black soldiers especially were shot when trying to surrender at the [[Battle of Fort Pillow|Fort Pillow Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Catton, ''Never Call Retreat'', p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a breakdown of the [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Prisoner of war mail|prisoner and mail exchange program]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dce.k12.wi.us/historyday/Topics/CivilWar.htm |title=Civil War Topics |publisher=Dce.k12.wi.us |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the growth of prison camps such as [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Andersonville prison]] in Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/nov/12/book-review-blacks-labored-in-andersonville/ Blacks labored in Andersonville]&quot;. Washington Times. November 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; where almost 13,000 Union prisoners of war died of starvation and disease.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom, pp. 791–798.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the South's shortage of soldiers, most Southern leaders&amp;nbsp;— until 1865&amp;nbsp;— opposed enlisting slaves. They used them as laborers to support the war effort. As [[Howell Cobb]] said, &quot;If slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong.&quot; Confederate generals [[Patrick Cleburne]] and [[Robert E. Lee]] argued in favor of arming blacks late in the war, and [[Jefferson Davis]] was eventually persuaded to support plans for arming slaves to avoid military defeat. The Confederacy surrendered at [[Appomattox, Virginia|Appomattox]] before this plan could be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom, pp. 831–837.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[John D. Winters]], in ''The Civil War in Louisiana'' (1963), referred to the exhilaration of the slaves when the Union Army came through [[Louisiana]]: &quot;As the troops moved up to [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]], the Negroes crowded the roadsides to watch the passing army. They were 'all frantic with joy, some weeping, some blessing, and some dancing in the exuberance of their emotions.' All of the Negroes were attracted by the pageantry and excitement of the army. Others cheered because they anticipated the freedom to plunder and to do as they pleased now that the Federal troops were there.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[John D. Winters]], ''The Civil War in Louisiana'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1963, ISBN 0-8071-0834-0, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emancipation Proclamation&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 557–558, 563.&lt;/ref&gt; greatly reduced the Confederacy's hope of getting aid from Britain or France. Lincoln's moderate approach succeeded in getting border states, War Democrats and emancipated slaves fighting on the same side for the Union. The Union-controlled border states (Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia) were not covered by the Emancipation Proclamation. All abolished slavery on their own, except Kentucky and Delaware.&lt;ref name=&quot;SlavDela&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=SLAVERY in DELAWARE|url=http://www.slavenorth.com/delaware.htm|year=2003|accessdate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great majority of the 4&amp;nbsp;million slaves were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, as Union armies moved South. The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th amendment]],&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 840–842.&lt;/ref&gt; ratified December 6, 1865, finally made slavery illegal everywhere in the United States, thus freeing the remaining slaves—65,000 in Kentucky (as of 1865),&lt;ref&gt;Lowell Hayes Harrison and James C. Klotter, ''A New History of Kentucky'' (1997) p 235, the number in late 1865.&lt;/ref&gt; 1,800 in Delaware, and 18 in New Jersey as of 1860.&lt;ref&gt;U. S. Census of 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Stephen Oates said that many myths surround Lincoln: &quot;man of the people&quot;, &quot;true Christian&quot;, &quot;arch villain&quot; and racist. The belief that Lincoln was racist was caused by an incomplete picture of Lincoln, such as focusing on only selective quoting of statements Lincoln made to gain the support of the border states and Northern Democrats, and ignoring the many things he said against slavery, and the military and political context within which such statements were made. Oates said that Lincoln's letter to [[Horace Greeley]] has been &quot;persistently misunderstood and misrepresented&quot; for such reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen B. Oates, Abraham Lincoln: The Man Behind the Myths, 1984, Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blocking international intervention==
{{Main|Britain in the American Civil War|France in the American Civil War}}
The Confederacy's best hope was military intervention into the war by Britain and France against the Union.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, ''Battle Cry of Freedom,'' pp. 546–557.&lt;/ref&gt; The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] worked to block this, and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America (none ever did). In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war in order to get cotton. [[Cotton diplomacy]] proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 1860–62 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance. It was said that &quot;King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton&quot;, as US grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, ''Battle Cry'' p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Britain did face a cotton shortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, iron workers, and British ships to transport weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Nevins, ''War for the Union 1862–1863'', pp. 263–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]] proved particularly adept as [[ambassador|minister]] to Britain for the U.S. and Britain was reluctant to boldly challenge the blockade. The Confederacy purchased several warships from commercial ship builders in Britain. The most famous, the [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], did considerable damage and led to serious [[Alabama Claims|postwar disputes]]. However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for European politicians, especially in Britain (who had herself abolished slavery in her own colonies in 1834). War loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the [[Trent Affair]], involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of a [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Blockade mail|British mail steamer]] to seize two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two.

In 1862, the British considered mediation—though even such an offer would have risked war with the U.S. [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] reportedly read ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin|Uncle Tom’s Cabin]]'' three times when deciding on this.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen B. Oates, ''The Approaching Fury: Voices of the Storm 1820–1861,'' p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The Union victory in the [[Battle of Antietam]] caused them to delay this decision. The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] further reinforced the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's own [[French intervention in Mexico|seizure of Mexico]] ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris.

Historians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars emphasize that the Union held an insurmountable long-term advantage over the Confederacy in terms of industrial strength and population. Confederate actions, they argue, only delayed defeat. Civil War  historian [[Shelby Foote]] expressed this view succinctly: &quot;I think that the North fought that war with one hand behind its back...If there had been more Southern victories, and a lot more, the North simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back. I don't think the South ever had a chance to win that War.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ward 1990 p 272&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had succeeded in getting the support of the border states, War Democrats, emancipated slaves, Britain, and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] and their peace platform.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, ''Battle Cry,'' pp. 771–772.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln had found military leaders like Grant and Sherman who would press the Union's numerical advantage in battle over the Confederate Armies. Generals who did not shy from bloodshed won the war, and from the end of 1864 onward there was no hope for the South.

On the other hand, [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]] has argued that the North’s advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely, but not inevitable. Confederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies to win.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, Why did the Confederacy Lose?&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important were Lincoln's eloquence in rationalizing the national purpose and his skill in keeping the border states committed to the Union cause. Although Lincoln's approach to emancipation was slow, the Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarLeader&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Fehrenbacher|first=Don|title=Lincoln's Wartime Leadership: The First Hundred Days|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jala/9/fehrenbacher.html|year=2004|publisher=University of Illinois|accessdate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederate government failed in its attempt to get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly the United Kingdom and France.  Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities.  Lincoln's naval blockade was 95% effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly. The abundance of European cotton and the United Kingdom's hostility to the institution of slavery, along with Lincoln's Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades, severely decreased any chance that either the United Kingdom or France would enter the war.

The more industrialized economy of the North aided in the production of arms, munitions and supplies, as well as finances and transportation. The table shows the relative advantage of the Union over the Confederate States of America (CSA) at the start of the war. The advantages widened rapidly during the war, as the Northern economy grew, and Confederate territory shrank and its economy weakened. The Union population was 22&amp;nbsp;million and the South 9&amp;nbsp;million in 1861. The Southern population included more than 3.5&amp;nbsp;million slaves and about 5.5&amp;nbsp;million whites, thus leaving the South's white population outnumbered by a ratio of more than four to one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tread&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Crocker III |first=H. W. |title=Don't Tread on Me |publisher=Crown Forum |year=2006 |location=New York |page=162 |isbn=978-1-4000-5363-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disparity grew as the Union controlled an increasing amount of southern territory with garrisons, and cut off the trans-Mississippi part of the Confederacy. The Union at the start controlled over 80% of the shipyards, steamships, riverboats, and the Navy. It augmented these by a massive shipbuilding program. This enabled the Union to control the river systems and to blockade the entire southern coastline.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson 313–16, 392–3&lt;/ref&gt; Excellent railroad links between Union cities allowed for the quick and cheap movement of troops and supplies. Transportation was much slower and more difficult in the South, which was unable to augment its much smaller rail system, repair damage, or even perform routine maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Heidler, David Stephen, ed. Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History (2002), 1591–98&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of Davis to maintain positive and productive relationships with state governors (especially governor [[Joseph E. Brown]] of Georgia and governor [[Zebulon Baird Vance]] of North Carolina) damaged his ability to draw on regional resources.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson 432–44&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederacy's &quot;[[King Cotton]]&quot; misperception of the world economy led to bad diplomacy, such as the refusal to ship cotton before the blockade started.&lt;ref&gt;Heidler, David Stephen, ed. Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History (2002), 598–603&lt;/ref&gt;
The Emancipation Proclamation enabled African-Americans, both free blacks and escaped slaves, to join the Union Army. About 190,000 volunteered,&lt;ref name=&quot;SpartSchool&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Regiments|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USACWcolored.htm|accessdate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery. Emancipated slaves mostly handled garrison duties, and fought numerous battles in 1864–65.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Berlin et al., eds.

Slavery for the Confederacy's 3.5 million blacks effectively ended when Union armies arrived; they were nearly all freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Slaves in the border states and those located in some former Confederate territory occupied prior to the Emancipation Proclamation were freed by state action or (on December 18, 1865) by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]. The full restoration of the Union was the work of a highly contentious postwar era known as [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. The war produced about 1,030,000 casualties (3% of the population), including about 620,000 soldier deaths—two-thirds by disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;StatsWarCost&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Nofi|first=Al|title=Statistics on the War's Costs|publisher=Louisiana State University|date=2001-06-13|url=http://www.cwc.lsu.edu/other/stats/warcost.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070711050249/http://www.cwc.lsu.edu/other/stats/warcost.htm|archivedate=2007-07-11|accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war accounted for roughly as many American deaths as all American deaths in other U.S. wars combined.&lt;ref&gt;C.

July 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the use of [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] tactics, such as [[charge (warfare)|charging]]. With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels, [[Minié ball]]s and (near the end of the war for the [[Union army]]) repeating firearms such as the [[Spencer repeating rifle]], soldiers were mowed down when standing in lines in the open. This led to the adoption of [[trench warfare]], a style of fighting that defined the better part of [[World War I]].

The war destroyed much of the wealth that had existed in the South.  Income per person in the South dropped to less than 40% than that of the North, a condition which lasted until well into the 20th century.  Southern influence in the US federal government, previously considerable, was greatly diminished until the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Economist]]'', &quot;[http://www.economist.com/node/18486035?story_id=18486035 The Civil War:  Finally Passing]&quot;, 2 April 2011, pp. 23-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reconstruction====
{{Main|Reconstruction era of the United States}}
Reconstruction began during the war (and continued to 1877) in an effort to solve the issues caused by reunion, specifically the legal status of the 11 breakaway states, the Confederate leadership, and the freedmen. Northern leaders during the war agreed that victory would require more than the end of fighting. It had to encompass the two war goals: secession had to be repudiated and all forms of slavery had to be eliminated. Lincoln and the Radical Republicans disagreed sharply on the criteria for these goals. They also disagreed on the degree of federal control that should be imposed on the South, and the process by which Southern states should be reintegrated into the Union.  These disputes became central to the political debates after the Confederacy collapsed.

==Memory and historiography==
===1963 Gettysburg parade===
On November 19, 1963 a parade was held in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]], [[Pennsylvania]] in honor of President Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] given six months after the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Lincoln had given the address 100 years earlier during the Civil War in Gettysburg in 1863. The sedan [[motorcade]] parade followed the same route that President Lincoln and Gov. [[Andrew Gregg Curtin|Andrew G. Curtin]] took 100 years before. Former President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was there accompanied by Gov. [[William W. Scranton]]. The attendance at the 1963 commemoration was lower than the 20,000 to 30,000 persons who attended the original address by President Lincoln in 1863. Thousands of photographers attended the 1963 event while U.S. Airforce jets passed overhead. Also attending the event were the 28th Division of the Pennsylvania National Guard headed by Maj. Gen. Henry F. Fluck , the U.S. Marine Band, and the 3rd Infantry of the U.S. Army. The parade ended at the rear entrance into the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;The Gettysburg Times (Wednesday, November 20, 1963), ''Procession To Cemetery Was Similar To '63 Event'', pp. 1, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical views and perspectives===
The year 2011 will include the American Civil War's 150th anniversary. Many in the south are attempting to incorporate both [[African American]] and white perspectives. One African American, Benard Simelton, president of the [[Alabama]] [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], said celebrating the Civil War is like celebrating the &quot;[[Holocaust]]&quot;. In reference to slavery Simelton said that black &quot;rights were taken away&quot; and that blacks &quot;were treated as less than human beings.&quot; National Park historian Bob Sutton said that slavery was the &quot;principal cause&quot; of the war. Sutton also claimed that the issue of state rights was incorporated by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] as a justification for the war in order to get recognition from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Sutton went on to mention that during the 100th anniversary of the Civil War white southerners focused on the genius of southern generals, rather than slavery. In [[Virginia]] during the fall of 2010, a conference took place that addressed the slavery issue. During November 2010, black Civil War reenactors from around the country have participated in a parade at [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Civil War's 150th anniversary stirs debate on race |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g02LT3cnj71haIQ8NXfRM-jR69yQ?docId=17de1f3fa7fe4a6999feb41ff12de8a1 |author=Associated Press |location=Charles, South Carolina

===Civil War Photographs - a Library of Congress exhibition===
[http://myloc.gov/exhibitions/civilwarphotographs Civil War Photographs - a Library of Congress exhibition] This exhibition from the Library of Congress features Civil War-era ambrotype and tintype photographs of Union and Confederate soldiers. The collection’s detailed portraits document the soldier uniforms, weapons, musical instruments and other possessions and include significant representation of African American troops and the families of soldiers.

===Sesquicentennial - April 12, 2011===
The date marking 150 years after the fighting began at Fort Sumter came and went with little fanfare.  A Harris Poll given in late March and surveying some 2,566 adults suggested that Americans were still uniquely divided over the results and appropriate memorials to acknowledge the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/NewsRoom/HarrisPolls/tabid/447/mid/1508/articleId/739/ctl/ReadCustom%20Default/Default.aspx |title=150 Years Later Remembering the American Civil War |  last=Braverman | first=Samantha | publisher=Harris Interactive Polls | date=March 29, 2011 | accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a successful career as a [[Illustration|commercial illustrator]], Warhol became famous worldwide for his work as a painter, [[avant-garde]] filmmaker, record producer, author, and member of highly diverse social circles that included [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] street people, distinguished intellectuals, [[Hollywood]] celebrities and wealthy patrons.

Warhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective [[art exhibition|exhibitions]], books, and [[I Shot Andy Warhol|feature]] and documentary films. He coined the widely used expression &quot;[[15 minutes of fame]].&quot; In his hometown of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[The Andy Warhol Museum]] exists in memory of his life and artwork.

The highest price ever paid for a Warhol painting is [[United States dollar|$]]100 million for a 1963 canvas titled ''[[Eight Elvises]].'' The private transaction was reported in a 2009 article in ''The Economist'', which described Warhol as the &quot;[[bellwether]] of the art market.&quot; $100 million is a benchmark price that only [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Pierre-August Renoir]], [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] have achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14941229 |title=A special report on the art market: The Pop master's highs and lows |publisher=The Economist |date= November 26, 2009|accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood (1928–48)==

Andy Warhol was born in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] on August 6, 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://warholfoundation.org/legacy/biography.html |title=Andy Warhol: Biography |publisher=Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fourth child of Andrij Warhola (died 1942)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.warhola.com/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Warhola.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julia Warhola|Julia]] (née Zavacka, 1892–1972),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.warhola.com/andysmother.html |title=Mother |publisher=Warhola.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose first child was born in their homeland and died before their move to the U.S. His parents were working-class [[Rusyns]]&lt;ref&gt;Jane Daggett Dillenberger, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KemglT-1jSIC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Warhol+%22Rusyn%22+biography&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Hdg8TaXvF8WL4ga2g5nnCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Warhol%20%22Rusyn%22%20biography&amp;f=false Religious Art of Andy Warhol], Continuum International Publishing Group, 2001, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; (or [[Lemkos]]) emigrants from [[Miková|Mikó]] (now called Miková), located in today’s northeastern [[Slovakia]], part of the former [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Warhol's father immigrated to the US in 1914, and his mother joined him in 1921, after the death of Warhol's grandparents. Warhol's father worked in a coal mine. The family lived at 55 Beelen Street and later at 3252 Dawson Street in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bockris&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Victor |last=Bockris |authorlink=Victor Bockris |title=The life and death of Andy Warhol |publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City |year=1989 |pages=4–5 |isbn=0-553-05708-1 |oclc=19631216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family was [[Ruthenian Catholic Church|Byzantine Catholic]] and attended [[St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church (Pittsburgh)|St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church]]. Andy Warhol had two older brothers - Pavol (Paul), the oldest, was born in Slovakia; [[John Warhola|Ján]] was born in Pittsburgh. Pavol's son, [[James Warhola]], became a successful children's book illustrator.

In [[third grade]], Warhol had [[Chorea (disease)|chorea]], the nervous system disease that causes involuntary movements of the extremities, which is believed to be a complication of [[Rheumatic fever|scarlet fever]] and causes skin pigmentation blotchiness.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1991), p.16&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[hypochondriac]], developing a fear of hospitals and doctors. Often bed-ridden as a child, he became an outcast at school and bonded with his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Fred Lawrence |last=Guiles |title=Loner at the ball: the life of Andy Warhol |publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=London |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=0-593-01540-1 |oclc=19455278}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times when he was confined to bed, he drew, listened to the radio and collected pictures of movie stars around his bed. Warhol later described this period as very important in the development of his personality, skill-set and preferences. When Warhol was 13, his father died in an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/popart/Andy-Warhol.html |title=The Prince of Pop Art |publisher=Arthistoryarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial art (1949–61)==
Warhol showed early artistic talent and studied [[commercial art]] at the [[Carnegie Mellon College of Fine Arts|School of Fine Arts]] at [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (now [[Carnegie Mellon University]]).&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p.19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, he moved to New York City and began a career in magazine illustration and advertising. During the 1950s, he gained fame for his whimsical ink drawings of shoe advertisements. These were done in a loose, blotted-ink style, and figured in some of his earliest showings at the [[Bodley Gallery]] in New York. With the concurrent rapid expansion of the record industry and the introduction of the vinyl record, Hi-Fi, and stereophonic recordings, [[RCA Records]] hired Warhol, along with another freelance artist, Sid Maurer, to design album covers and promotional materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Andrew |last=Oldham |authorlink=Andrew Loog Oldham |coauthors=Simon Spence and Christine Ohlman |title=2Stoned |publisher=[[Secker and Warburg]] |location=London |year=2002 |page=137 |isbn=0-436-28015-9 |oclc=50215773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fine art (1952–67)==

He began exhibiting his work during the 1950s. He held exhibitions at the Hugo Gallery,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gagosian.com/artists/andy-warhol/ Warhol biography, Gagosian Gallery] Retrieved March 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bodley Gallery]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.susansheehangallery.com/artistworksdetail.php?id=9516&amp;artist=Andy_Warhol Bodley Gallery Warhol exhibition announcement] Retrieved March 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in New York City and in California his first one-man art-gallery exhibition &lt;ref name=&quot;An38&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Callie |last=Angell |title=Andy Warhol screen tests: the films of Andy Warhol: catalogue raisonné |publisher=[[Harry N.

Andy Warhol's first New York solo [[pop art]] exhibition was hosted at Eleanor Ward's [[Stable Gallery]] November 6–24, 1962. The exhibit included the works ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'', ''100 Soup Cans'', ''100 Coke Bottles'' and ''100 Dollar Bills''. At the [[Stable Gallery]] exhibit, the artist met for the first time poet [[John Giorno]] who would star in Warhol's first film, ''[[Sleep (film)|Sleep]]'', in 1963.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

It was during the 1960s that Warhol began to make paintings of iconic American products such as [[Campbell's Soup Cans]] and [[Coca-Cola]] bottles, as well as paintings of celebrities such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Troy Donahue]], [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]]. He founded &quot;[[The Factory]],&quot; his studio during these years, and gathered around himself a wide range of artists, writers, musicians, and underground celebrities. He began producing prints using the [[silkscreen]] method &lt;ref&gt;The silkscreen method is a stencil method of printmaking in which a design is imposed on a screen of silk or other fine mesh, with blank areas coated with an impermeable substance, and ink is forced through the mesh onto the printing surface. [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/silk-screen]&lt;/ref&gt; His work became popular and controversial.

Among the imagery tackled by Warhol were dollar bills, celebrities and brand name products. He also used as imagery for his paintings newspaper headlines or photographs of [[mushroom cloud]]s, [[electric chair]]s, and police dogs attacking [[civil rights movement|civil rights]] protesters. Warhol also used Coca Cola bottles as subject matter for paintings. He had this to say about Coca Cola:

{{quote|What's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coca-Cola, Liz Taylor drinks Coca-Cola, and just think, you can drink Coca-Cola, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the cokes are the same and all the cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Andy |last=Warhol |title=[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol|The philosophy of Andy Warhol: from A to B and back again]] |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=San Diego |year=1975 |page= |isbn=0-15-189050-1 |oclc=1121125}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] hosted a Symposium on pop art in December 1962 during which artists like Warhol were attacked for &quot;capitulating&quot; to consumerism. Critics were scandalized by Warhol's open embrace of market culture. This symposium set the tone for Warhol's reception. Throughout the decade it became more and more clear that there had been a profound change in the culture of the art world, and that Warhol was at the center of that shift.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

A pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit ''The American Supermarket'', a show held in Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery. The show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment, except that everything in it – from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc. – was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, among them the controversial (and like-minded) [[Billy Apple]], Mary Inman, and [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]]. Warhol's painting of a can of Campbell's soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for $6. The exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is (or of what is art and what is not).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:AppleAndWarhol72dpi.jpg|thumb|280px|Andy Warhol and fellow pop artist [[Billy Apple]] show their &quot;products&quot; during the 1964 show ''The American Supermarket''.]] --&gt;

As an advertisement illustrator in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; in the 1960s, however, this was particularly true. One of the most important collaborators during this period was [[Gerard Malanga]]. Malanga assisted the artist with producing silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at &quot;[[The Factory]],&quot; Warhol's [[aluminum foil]]-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included [[Freddie Herko]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Ronald Tavel]], [[Mary Woronov]], [[Billy Name]], and [[Brigid Berlin]] (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

During the '60s, Warhol also groomed a retinue of [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation &quot;[[Warhol Superstar|Superstars]]&quot;, including [[Nico]], [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Viva (Warhol superstar)|Viva]], [[Isabelle Collin Dufresne|Ultra Violet]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Jackie Curtis]] and [[Candy Darling]]. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some – like Berlin – remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer [[John Giorno]] and film-maker [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]], also appear in Warhol films of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse  range of artistic scenes during this time.

==Attempted murder (1968)==
On June 3, 1968, [[Valerie Solanas]] shot Warhol and art critic and curator [[Mario Amaya]] at Warhol's studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schaffner |first=Ingrid |authorlink=Ingrid Schaffner |title=The Essential Andy Warhol |publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams]] |location=New York City |page=79 |year=1999 |isbn=0-8109-5806-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the shooting, Solanas had been a marginal figure in the Factory scene. She authored the ''[[S.C.U.M. Manifesto]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Solanas&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Valerie |last=Solanas |authorlink=Valerie Solanas |title=[[SCUM Manifesto]] |publisher=Verso |location=London |origyear=1967 |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=1-85984-553-3 |oclc=53932627}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Separatist feminism|separatist feminist]] attack on males. Solanas appears in the 1968 Warhol film ''[[I, a Man]]''.  Earlier on the day of the attack, Solanas had been turned away from the Factory after asking for the return of a script she had given to Warhol. The script, apparently, had been misplaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jobey&quot;&gt;Jobey, Liz, &quot;Solanas and Son,&quot;  ''The Guardian'' (Manchester, England) August 24, 1996: page T10 and following.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amaya received only minor injuries and was released from the hospital later the same day. Warhol however, was seriously wounded by the attack and barely survived (surgeons opened his chest and [[Defibrillation|massaged his heart]] to help stimulate its movement again). He suffered physical effects for the rest of his life. The shooting had a profound effect on Warhol's life and art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harding&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harding |first=James |title=The Simplest Surrealist Act: Valerie Solanas and the (Re)Assertion of Avantgarde Priorities |journal=[[TDR (journal)|TDR/The Drama Review]] |volume=45 |issue=4 |month=Winter |year=2001 |pages=142–162 |doi=10.1162/105420401772990388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=popism287-295&gt;{{Cite book|first=Andy |last=Warhol |coauthors=Pat Hacket |title=POPism: the Warhol '60s |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=New York City |year=1980 |pages=287–295 |isbn=0-15-173095-4 |oclc=5673923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solanas was arrested the day after the assault. By way of explanation, she said that Warhol &quot;had too much control over my life.&quot; She was eventually sentenced to three years under the control of the [[New York City Department of Correction|Department of Corrections]]. After the shooting, the Factory scene became much more tightly controlled, and for many the &quot;Factory 60s&quot; ended.&lt;ref name=popism287-295/&gt; The shooting was mostly overshadowed in the media due to the assassination of [[Robert F. Kennedy]] two days later.

Warhol had this to say about the attack: &quot;Before I was shot, I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there&amp;nbsp;– I always suspected that I was watching TV instead of living life. People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen in life that's unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television&amp;nbsp;– you don't feel anything. Right when I was being shot and ever since, I knew that I was watching television. The channels switch, but it's all television.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;stiles1996&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Kristine |last=Stiles |authorlink=Kristine Stiles |coauthors=Peter Howard Selz |chapter=Warhol in His Own Words |title=Theories and documents of contemporary art: a sourcebook of artists' writings |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=1996 |page=345 |isbn=0-520-20251-1 |oclc=31738530}}

==1970s==
[[File:Jimmy Carter Andy Warhol 1977.jpg|thumb|Andy Warhol and [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1977]]

Compared to the success and scandal of Warhol's work in the 1960s, the 1970s were a much quieter decade, as Warhol became more entrepreneurial. According to [[Bob Colacello]], Warhol devoted much of his time to rounding up new, rich patrons for portrait commissions– including Shah of Iran [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], his wife Empress [[Farah Pahlavi]], his sister [[Princess Ashraf Pahlavi]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[John Lennon]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Brigitte Bardot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8188996.stm. | work=BBC News | title=Warhol's Jackson goes on display | date=August 7, 2009 | accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Warhol's famous portrait of Chinese Communist leader [[Mao Zedong]] was created in 1973. He also founded, with [[Gerard Malanga]], ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine, and published ''The Philosophy of Andy Warhol'' (1975). An idea expressed in the book: &quot;Making money is art, and working is art and good business is the best art.&quot;{{Cite quote|date=January 2009}}

Warhol used to socialize at various nightspots in New York City, including [[Max's Kansas City]]; and, later in the '70s, [[Studio 54]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maxskansascity.com/warhol/ |title=Andy Warhol Biography: From The Velvet Underground To Basquiat |date= |accessdate=2009-01-06}}{{Verify credibility|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was generally regarded as quiet, shy, and a meticulous observer. Art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] called him &quot;the white mole of [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Robert |last=Hughes |authorlink=Robert Hughes (critic) |title=Things I didn't know: a memoir |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |year=2006 |page= |isbn=1-4000-4444-8 |oclc=64208378}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s==
Warhol had a re-emergence of critical and financial success in the 1980s, partially due to his affiliation and friendships with a number of prolific younger artists, who were dominating the &quot;[[bull market]]&quot; of '80s New York art: [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[David Salle]] and other so-called [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-Expressionists]], as well as members of the [[Transavantgarde]] movement in Europe, including [[Francesco Clemente]] and [[Enzo Cucchi]].

During this time Warhol created the Michael Jackson painting signifying his success attributed to his best-selling album ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]''.

By this period, Warhol was being criticized for becoming merely a &quot;business artist&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;jpost&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|first=Michal |last=Lando |date=2008-04-08 |title=Reexamining Warhol's Jews |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1207486218796&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, reviewers disliked his exhibits of portraits of 1970s personalities and [[celebrities]], calling them superficial, facile and commercial, with no depth or indication of the significance of the subjects. They also criticized his 1980 exhibit of 10 portraits at the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in New York, entitled ''Jewish Geniuses'', which Warhol – who was uninterested in Judaism and Jews – had described in his diary as &quot;They're going to sell.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;jpost&quot;/&gt; In hindsight, however, some critics have come to view Warhol's superficiality and commerciality as &quot;the most brilliant mirror of our times,&quot; contending that &quot;Warhol had captured something irresistible about the [[zeitgeist]] of American culture in the 1970s.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;jpost&quot;/&gt;

Warhol also had an appreciation for intense [[Hollywood glamour]]. He once said: &quot;I love Los Angeles. I love Hollywood. They're so beautiful. Everything's plastic, but I love plastic. I want to be plastic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Victor |last=Bockris |authorlink=Victor Bockris |coauthors=[[Gerard Malanga]] |title=Up-tight: the Velvet Underground story |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |location=London |year=2002 |page=66 |isbn=0-7119-9170-7 |oclc=49906101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Warhol died in New York City at 6:32&amp;nbsp;a.m. on February 22, 1987. According to news reports, he had been making good recovery from a routine [[gallbladder]] surgery at [[New York Hospital]] before dying in his sleep from a sudden post-operative [[cardiac arrhythmia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DA1639F930A25757C0A961948260 |first=Robert O. |last=Boorstin |title=Hospital Asserts it Gave Warhol Adequate Care |date=1987-04-13 |accessdate=2009-01-02 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as he was afraid to enter hospitals and see doctors. His family sued the hospital for inadequate care, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and [[water intoxication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan |first=Ronald |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/05/nyregion/care-faulted-in-the-death-of-warhol.html |title=New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1991-12-05 |accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Warhol's grave.jpg|thumb|Warhol's grave&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|1459|accessdate=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery]]]]

Warhol's body was taken back to Pittsburgh by his brothers for burial. The wake was at Thomas P. Kunsak Funeral Home and was an open-coffin ceremony. The coffin was a solid bronze casket with gold plated rails and white upholstery. Warhol was dressed in a black cashmere suit, a paisley tie, a platinum wig, and sunglasses. He was posed holding a small prayer book and a red rose. The funeral liturgy was held at the [[Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church (Pittsburgh)|Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church]] on Pittsburgh's [[North Shore (Pittsburgh)|North Side]]. The eulogy was given by [[Monsignor]] Peter Tay. [[Yoko Ono]] also made an appearance. The coffin was covered with white roses and [[Asparagus densiflorus|asparagus ferns]]. After the liturgy, the coffin was driven to [[St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery]] in [[Bethel Park]], a south suburb of Pittsburgh.
[[File:Bratislava Venturska ulica1.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Andy Warhol in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]].|left]]
At the grave, the priest said a brief prayer and sprinkled holy water on the casket. Before the coffin was lowered, [[Paige Powell]] dropped a copy of ''Interview'' magazine, an ''Interview'' t-shirt, and a bottle of the [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estee Lauder]] perfume &quot;Beautiful&quot; into the grave. Warhol was buried next to his mother and father. A memorial service was held in Manhattan for Warhol on April 1, 1987, at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]].

Warhol's will dictated that his entire estate – with the exception of a few modest legacies to family members – would go to create a foundation dedicated to the &quot;advancement of the visual arts&quot;. Warhol had so many possessions that it took [[Sotheby's]] nine days to auction his estate after his death; the auction grossed more than US$20 million.

In 1987, in accordance with Warhol's will, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts began. The Foundation serves as the official Estate of Andy Warhol, but also has a mission &quot;to foster innovative artistic expression and the creative process&quot; and is &quot;focused primarily on supporting work of a challenging and often experimental nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;warholfoundation intro&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.warholfoundation.org/intro.htm |title=Introduction |publisher=The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts |accessdate=2009-01-02}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paintings===
{{Primary sources|section|date=February 2009}}

By the beginning of the 1960s, Warhol had become a very successful commercial illustrator. His detailed and elegant drawings for I. Miller shoes were particularly popular. They consisted mainly of &quot;blotted ink&quot; drawings (or [[monoprint]]s), a technique which he applied in much of his early art. Although many artists of this period worked in commercial art, most did so discreetly. Warhol was so successful, however, that his profile as an illustrator seemed to undermine his efforts to be taken seriously as an artist.

[[Pop art]] was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting; some of these pioneers, such as [[Roy Lichtenstein]], would later become synonymous with the movement. Warhol, who would become famous as the &quot;Pope of Pop&quot;, turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images taken from [[cartoons]] and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists (such as [[Willem de Kooning]]). Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bronwit Teller's window display. This was the same stage his Pop Art contemporaries [[Jasper Johns]], [[James Rosenquist]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] had also once graced.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Patrick S (1986). Andy Warhol's Art and Films. UMI Research Press. p.98. ISBN 0-8357-1733-X.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Warhol pared his image vocabulary down to the icon itself – to brand names, celebrities, dollar signs – and removed all traces of the artist's &quot;hand&quot; in the production of his paintings.

To him, part of defining a niche was defining his subject matter. Cartoons were already being used by Lichtenstein, typography by [[Jasper Johns]], and so on; Warhol wanted a distinguishing subject. His friends suggested he should paint the things he loved the most.  It was the gallerist Muriel Latow who came up with the ideas for both the soup cans and Warhol's dollar paintings. On 23 November 1961 Warhol wrote Latow a check for $50 which, according to the 2009 Warhol biography, ''Pop, The Genius of Warhol'', was payment for coming up with the idea of the soup cans as subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html |title=The Soup Cans - Andy Warhol |publisher=Warholstars.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For his first major exhibition Warhol painted his famous cans of Campbell's Soup, which he claimed to have had for lunch for most of his life. The work sold for $10,000 at an auction on November 17, 1971, at Sotheby's New York – a minimal amount for the artist whose paintings sell for over $6 million more recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artsalesindex.artinfo.com/artsalesindex/asi/lots/10388409  |title=Auction Results: Andy Warhol's ''Campbell's Soup Can'' |publisher=[[Louise Blouin Media]] |accessdate=2009-01-05}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He loved [[celebrity|celebrities]], so he painted them as well. From these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the hand-made from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used [[silk-screen]]ing; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Warhol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group 4 race version of the then elite supercar [[BMW M1]] for the fourth installment in the [[BMW Art Car Project]]. Unlike the three artists before him, Warhol declined the use of a small scale practice model, instead opting to immediately paint directly onto the full scale automobile. It was indicated that Warhol spent only a total of 23 minutes to paint the entire car.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2006/03/27-bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1/bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1.php&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=January 2011}}

Warhol produced both comic and serious works; his subject could be a soup can or an electric chair. Warhol used the same techniques– silkscreens, reproduced serially, and often painted with bright colors – whether he painted celebrities, everyday objects, or images of suicide, car crashes, and disasters, as in the 1962–63 ''Death and Disaster'' series. The ''Death and Disaster'' paintings included ''Red Car Crash'', ''Purple Jumping Man'', and ''Orange Disaster.''

The unifying element in Warhol's work is his deadpan [[Buster Keaton|Keatonesque]] style – artistically and personally affectless. This was mirrored by Warhol's own demeanor, as he often played &quot;dumb&quot; to the media, and refused to explain his work. The artist was famous for having said that all you need to know about him and his works is already there, &quot;Just look at the surface of my paintings and films and me, and there I am. There's nothing behind it.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=1625 |title=Andy Warhol (Getty Museum) |publisher=Getty.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Warhol autograph.jpg|thumb|222px|right|Autograph and sketch by Warhol]]
His [[Rorschach test|Rorschach inkblots]] are intended as pop comments on art and what art could be. His cow wallpaper (literally, wallpaper with a cow [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]) and his [[redox|oxidation]] paintings (canvases prepared with copper paint that was then oxidized with urine) are also noteworthy in this context. Equally noteworthy is the way these works – and their [[means of production]] – mirrored the atmosphere at Andy's New York &quot;Factory&quot;. [[Biographer]] Bob Colacello provides some details on Andy's &quot;piss paintings&quot;:

{{quote|Victor... was Andy's ghost pisser on the Oxidations. He would come to the Factory to urinate on canvases that had already been primed with copper-based paint by Andy or Ronnie Cutrone, a second ghost pisser much appreciated by Andy, who said that the vitamin B that Ronnie took made a prettier color when the acid in the urine turned the copper green. Did Andy ever use his own urine? My diary shows that when he first began the series, in December 1977, he did, and there were many others: boys who'd come to lunch and drink too much wine, and find it funny or even flattering to be asked to help Andy 'paint.' Andy always had a little extra bounce in his walk as he led them to his studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Bob |last=Colacello |authorlink=Bob Colacello |title=Holy terror: Andy Warhol close up |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=1990 |page=343 |isbn=0-06-016419-0 |oclc=21196706}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Warhol's first portrait of ''Basquiat'' (1982) is a black photosilkscreen over an oxidized copper &quot;piss painting&quot;.

After many years of silkscreen, oxidation, photography, etc., Warhol returned to painting with a brush in hand in a series of over 50 large collaborative works done with [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] between 1984 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Chiappini, Rudi (ed.) ''Jean-Michel Basquiat''. Museo d'Arte Moderna /Skira, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fairbrother, Trevor. &quot;Double Feature—Collaborative Paintings, Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat,&quot; ''Art in America'', September 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite negative criticism when these were first shown, Warhol called some of them &quot;masterpieces,&quot; and they were  influential for his later work.&lt;ref&gt;Fretz, Eric. ''Jean-Michel Basquiat: A Biography''. Greenwood Press, 2010. ISBN 978-0-313-38056-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the large collaborations with Basquiat can be seen in Warhol's ''The Last Supper'' cycle, his last and possibly his largest series, seen by some as &quot;arguably his greatest,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dillenberger2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Jane |last=Dillenberger |title=The Religious Art of Andy Warhol |publisher=Continuum |location=London |year=2001 |pages=10–11 |isbn=0-8264-1334-X |oclc=59540326}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by others as “wishy-washy, religiose” and “spiritless.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Haden-Guest, “Warhol's Last Supper” ArtNet 1999, http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/features/haden-guest/haden-guest8-3-99.asp&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the largest series of religious-themed works by any U.S. artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dillenberger2001&quot;/&gt;

At the time of his death, Warhol was working on ''[[Cars (painting)|Cars]]'', a series of paintings for [[Mercedes-Benz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/sep/01/arts.warhol|title=Warhol: Cars|date=2001-09-01|accessdate=2010-04-24|work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Maev | last=Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
Warhol worked across a wide range of media – painting, photography, drawing, and sculpture. In addition, he was a highly prolific filmmaker. Between 1963 and 1968, he made more than 60 films,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912238/|title=Andy Warhol Filmography|work=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate=September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus some 500 short black-and-white &quot;screen test&quot; portraits of Factory visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffner (1999), p.73&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most famous films, ''[[Sleep (film)|Sleep]]'', monitors poet [[John Giorno]] sleeping for six hours. The 35-minute film ''Blow Job'' is one continuous shot of the face of [[DeVeren Bookwalter]] supposedly receiving [[oral sex]] from filmmaker [[Willard Maas]], although the camera never tilts down to see this. Another, [[Empire (1964 film)|''Empire'' (1964)]], consists of eight hours of footage of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City at dusk. The film ''[[Eat (film)|Eat]]'' consists of a man eating a mushroom for 45 minutes. Warhol attended the 1962 premiere of the static composition by [[LaMonte Young]] called ''Trio for Strings'' and subsequently created his famous series of static films including ''Kiss'', ''Eat'', and ''Sleep'' (for which Young initially was commissioned to provide music). Uwe Husslein cites filmmaker [[Jonas Mekas]], who accompanied Warhol to the Trio premiere, and who claims Warhol's static films were directly inspired by the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Uwe |last=Husslein |title=Pop goes art: Andy Warhol &amp; Velvet Underground |publisher=Wuppertal |year=1990 |oclc=165575494}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Batman Dracula]]'' is a 1964 film that was produced and directed by Warhol, without the permission of [[DC Comics]]. It was screened only at his art exhibits. A fan of the Batman series, Warhol's movie was an &quot;homage&quot; to the series, and is considered the first appearance of a blatantly [[Camp (style)|campy]] Batman. The film was until recently thought to have been lost, until scenes from the picture were shown at some length in the 2006 documentary ''[[Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis]]''.

Warhol's 1965 film ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]'' is an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]' popular [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]''. Others record improvised encounters between Factory regulars such as [[Brigid Berlin]], [[Viva (Warhol Superstar)|Viva]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Candy Darling]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Nico]], and [[Jackie Curtis]]. Legendary underground artist [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] appears in the film ''Camp''.

His most popular and critically successful film was ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966). The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two [[16 mm film|16 mm]]-films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that &quot;story&quot; while it was lowered for the other. The multiplication of images evoked Warhol's seminal silk-screen works of the early 1960s.

Other important films include ''Bike Boy'', ''My Hustler'', and ''[[Lonesome Cowboys (1968 film)|Lonesome Cowboys]]'', a raunchy pseudo-[[Western (genre)|western]]. These and other titles document gay underground and camp culture, and continue to feature prominently in scholarship about sexuality and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Matthew |last=Tinkcom |title=Working like a homosexual: camp, capital, and cinema |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |location=Durham, North Carolina |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-8223-2862-3 |oclc=48098591}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Juan Antonio |last=Suárez |title=Bike boys, drag queens &amp; superstars: avant-garde, mass culture, and gay identities in the 1960s underground cinema |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=Bloomington, Indiana |year=1996 |pages= |isbn=0-253-32971-X |oclc=32548890}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Blue Movie]]'' – a film in which Warhol superstar Viva makes love and fools around in bed with a man for 33 minutes of the film's playing-time – was Warhol's last film as director. The film was at the time scandalous for its frank approach to a sexual encounter. For many years Viva refused to allow it to be screened. It was publicly screened in New York in 2005 for the first time in over thirty years.

After his June 3, 1968, shooting, a reclusive Warhol relinquished his personal involvement in filmmaking. His acolyte and assistant director, [[Paul Morrissey]], took over the film-making chores for the [[The Factory|Factory]] collective, steering Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie [[exploitation film|exploitation]] fare with ''[[Flesh (film)|Flesh]]'', ''[[Trash (film)|Trash]]'', and ''[[Heat (1972 film)|Heat]]''. All of these films, including the later ''[[Blood for Dracula|Andy Warhol's Dracula]]'' and ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein|Andy Warhol's Frankenstein]]'', were far more mainstream than anything Warhol as a director had attempted. These latter &quot;Warhol&quot; films starred [[Joe Dallesandro]] – more of a Morrissey star than a true [[Warhol superstar]].

In the early '70s, most of the films directed by Warhol were pulled out of circulation by Warhol and the people around him who ran his business. After Warhol's death, the films were slowly restored by the Whitney Museum and are occasionally projected at museums and film festivals. Few of the Warhol-directed films are available on video or DVD.

===Music===
In the mid 1960s, Warhol adopted the band [[the Velvet Underground]], making them a crucial element of the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] multimedia performance art show. Warhol, with [[Paul Morrissey]], acted as the band's manager, introducing them to [[Nico]] (who would perform with the band at Warhol's request). In 1966 he &quot;produced&quot; their first album ''[[The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico]]'', as well as providing its album art. His actual participation in the album's production amounted to simply paying for the studio time. After the band's first album, Warhol and band leader [[Lou Reed]] started to disagree more about the direction the band should take, and their artistic friendship ended.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  In 1989, after Warhol's death, Reed and [[John Cale]] re-united for the first time since 1972 to write, perform, record and release the concept album ''[[Songs for Drella]]'', a tribute to Warhol.

Warhol designed many album covers for various artists starting with the photographic cover of [[John Wallowitch]]'s debut album, ''This Is John Wallowitch!!!'' (1964). He designed the cover art for [[the Rolling Stones]] albums ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971) and ''[[Love You Live]]'' (1977), and the [[John Cale]] albums ''[[The Academy in Peril]]'' (1972) and ''[[Honi Soit (album)|Honi Soit]]'' in 1981. In 1975, Warhol was commissioned to do several portraits of [[Mick Jagger]], and in 1982 he designed the album cover for the [[Diana Ross]] album [[Silk Electric]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} One of his last works was a portrait of [[Aretha Franklin]] for the cover of her 1986 [[Music recording sales certification|gold album]] ''[[Aretha (1986 album)|Aretha]]'', which was done in the style of the ''Reigning Queens'' series he had completed the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bego | first = Mark | title = ''Aretha Franklin: The Queen of Soul'' | publisher = Da Capo Press | year = 2001 | page = 250 | isbn = 0306809354 | oclc = 46488152 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=ErKigdCXUwoC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;dq=warhol+album+cover+1986 | accessdate = 2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol strongly influenced the [[New Wave music|New Wave]]/[[punk rock]] band [[Devo]], as well as [[David Bowie]]. Bowie recorded a song called &quot;[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]&quot; for his 1971 album ''[[Hunky Dory]]''. Lou Reed wrote the song &quot;Andy's Chest&quot;, about [[Valerie Solanas]], the woman who shot Warhol, in 1968. He recorded it with the Velvet Underground, and this version was released on the [[VU (album)|VU]] album in 1985.

===Books and print===
Beginning in the early 1950s, Warhol produced several unbound portfolios of his work.

The first of several bound self-published books by Warhol was ''[[25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy]]'', printed in 1954 by Seymour Berlin on Arches brand watermarked paper using his blotted line technique for the lithographs. The original edition was limited to 190 numbered, hand colored copies, using Dr. Martin's ink washes. Most of these were given by Warhol as gifts to clients and friends. Copy #4, inscribed &quot;Jerry&quot; on the front cover and given to [[Geraldine Stutz]], was used for a facsimile printing in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=John |last=Russell |authorlink=John Russell (art critic) |date=1987-12-06 |title=Art |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DF133DF935A35751C1A961948260 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the original was auctioned in May 2006 for US $35,000 by [[Doyle New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doylenewyork.com/default.htm May 3, 2006 auction at [[Doyle New York]]]. Retrieved August 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other self-published books by Warhol include:
* ''A Gold Book''
* ''Wild Raspberries''
* ''Holy Cats''

After gaining fame, Warhol &quot;wrote&quot; several books that were commercially published:
* ''[[A, a novel|a, A Novel]]'' (1968, ISBN 0-8021-3553-6) is a literal transcription– containing spelling errors and phonetically written background noise and mumbling– of audio recordings of [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]] and several of Andy Warhol's friends hanging out at the Factory, talking, going out.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol|The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B &amp; Back Again)]]'' (1975, ISBN 0-15-671720-4)– according to Pat Hackett's introduction to ''The Andy Warhol Diaries'', Pat Hackett did the transcriptions and text for the book based on daily phone conversations, sometimes (when Warhol was traveling) using audio cassettes that Andy Warhol gave her. Said cassettes contained conversations with [[Brigid Berlin]] (also known as Brigid Polk) and former ''Interview'' magazine editor [[Bob Colacello]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]'' (1980, ISBN 0-15-672960-1), authored by Warhol and Pat Hackett is a retrospective view of the sixties and the role of pop art.
* ''[[The Andy Warhol Diaries]]'' (1989, ISBN 0-446-39138-7), edited by Pat Hackett, is a diary dictated by Warhol to Hackett in daily phone conversations. Warhol started the diary to keep track of his expenses after being audited, although it soon evolved to include his personal and cultural observations.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p.183&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol created the fashion magazine ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' that is still published today. The loopy title script on the cover is thought to be either his own handwriting or that of his mother, Julia Warhola, who would often do text work for his early commercial pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), pp.22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other media===
Although Andy Warhol is most known for his paintings and films, he authored works in many different media.
* '''Drawing:''' Warhol started his career as a commercial illustrator, producing drawings in &quot;blotted-ink&quot; style for advertisements and magazine articles. Best known of these early works are his drawings of shoes. Some of his personal drawings were self-published in small booklets, such as ''Yum, Yum, Yum'' (about food), ''Ho, Ho, Ho'' (about Christmas) and (of course) ''Shoes, Shoes, Shoes''. His most artistically acclaimed book of drawings is probably ''A Gold Book'', compiled of sensitive drawings of young men. ''A Gold Book'' is so named because of the [[gold leaf]] that decorates its pages.&lt;ref name=Bourdon51&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York City |year=1989 |page=51 |isbn=0-8109-1761-0 |oclc=19389231}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sculpture:''' Warhol's most famous sculpture is probably his ''[[Brillo|Brillo Boxes]]'', silkscreened ink on wood replicas of Brillo soap pad boxes (designed by [[James Harvey (artist)|James Harvey]]), part of a series of &quot;grocery carton&quot; sculptures that also included Heinz ketchup and Campbell's tomato juice cases.&lt;ref name = &quot;365 Takes&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Staff of The Andy Warhol Museum |title=Andy Warhol: 365 Takes |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York City |year=2004 |page=35 |isbn=0-500-23814-6 |oclc=56117613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous works include the ''Silver Clouds''– helium filled, silver mylar, pillow-shaped [[balloon]]s. A ''Silver Cloud'' was included in the traveling exhibition ''Air Art'' (1968–69) curated by [[Willoughby Sharp]]. ''Clouds'' was also adapted by Warhol for [[avant-garde]] choreographer Merce Cunningham's dance piece ''RainForest'' (1968).&lt;ref name=Bourdon231&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York City |year=1989 |page=231 |isbn=0-8109-1761-0 |oclc=19389231}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Audio:''' At one point Warhol carried a portable recorder with him wherever he went, taping everything everybody said and did. He referred to this device as his &quot;wife&quot;. Some of these tapes were the basis for his literary work. Another audio-work of Warhol's was his &quot;Invisible Sculpture&quot;, a presentation in which burglar alarms would go off when entering the room. Warhol's cooperation with the musicians of The Velvet Underground was driven by an expressed desire to become a music producer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
*'''Time Capsules:''' In 1973, Warhol began saving ephemera from his daily life– correspondence, newspapers, souvenirs, childhood objects, even used plane tickets and food– which was sealed in plain cardboard boxes dubbed Time Capsules. By the time of his death, the collection grew to include 600, individually dated &quot;capsules&quot;. The boxes are now housed at the Andy Warhol Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Staff of The Andy Warhol Museum |title=Andy Warhol: 365 Takes |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York City |year=2004 |page=157 |isbn=0-500-23814-6 |oclc=56117613}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Television:''' Andy Warhol dreamed of a television show that he wanted to call ''The Nothing Special'', a special about his favorite subject: Nothing. Later in his career he did create two cable television shows, ''Andy Warhol's TV'' in 1982 and ''[[Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes]]'' (based on his famous &quot;[[fifteen minutes of fame]]&quot; quotation) for MTV in 1986. Besides his own shows he regularly made guest appearances on other programs, including ''[[The Love Boat]]'' wherein a Midwestern wife ([[Marion Ross]]) fears Andy Warhol will reveal to her husband ([[Tom Bosley]], who starred alongside Ross in sitcom ''[[Happy Days]]'') her secret past as a Warhol superstar named Marina del Rey. Warhol also produced a TV commercial for [[Schrafft's]] Restaurants in New York City, for an ice cream dessert appropriately titled the &quot;Underground Sundae&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joedallesandro.com/sundae.htm |title=Underground Sundae |year=2005 |first=Michael |last=Ferguson |accessdate=2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Fashion:''' Warhol is quoted for having said: &quot;I'd rather buy a dress and put it up on the wall, than put a painting, wouldn't you?&quot;{{Cite quote|date=January 2009}} One of his most well-known Superstars, [[Edie Sedgwick]], aspired to be a fashion designer, and his good friend [[Halston]] was a famous one. Warhol's work in fashion includes silkscreened dresses, a short sub-career as a catwalk-model and books on fashion as well as paintings with fashion (shoes) as a subject.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* '''Performance Art:''' Warhol and his friends staged theatrical multimedia happenings at parties and public venues, combining music, film, slide projections and even Gerard Malanga in an [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]] outfit cracking a whip. The [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] in 1966 was the culmination of this area of his work.&lt;ref name=Bourdon221-225&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York City |year=1989 |pages=221–225 |isbn=0-8109-1761-0 |oclc=19389231}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  '''Theater:'''  Andy Warhol's PORK opened on May 5, 1971 at LaMama theater in New York for a two week run and was brought to the Roundhouse in London for a longer run in August, 1971.  Pork was based on tape-recorded conversations between Brigin Berlin and Andy during which Brigid would play for Andy tapes she had made of phone conversations between herself and her mother, socialite Honey Berlin.  The play featured [[Jayne County]] as &quot;Vulva&quot; and [[Cherry Vanilla]] as &quot;Amanda Pork&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 1974, Andy Warhol also produced the stage musical [[Man On The Moon (musical)|Man On The Moon]], which was written by [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]] of the [[Mamas and the Papas]].
* '''Photography:''' To produce his silkscreens, Warhol made photographs or had them made by his friends and assistants. These pictures were mostly taken with a specific model of [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] camera that Polaroid kept in production especially for Warhol. This photographic approach to painting and his snapshot method of taking pictures has had a great effect on artistic photography. Warhol was an accomplished photographer, and took an enormous amount of photographs of Factory visitors, friends.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* '''Computer:''' Warhol used [[Amiga]] computers to generate digital art, which he helped design and build with Amiga, Inc. He also displayed the difference between slow fill and fast fill on live TV with [[Debbie Harry]] as a model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/PDFs/amiga-ieeespectrum.pdf |title=Amiga: The Computer That Wouldn’t Die |year=2001 |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oqUd8utr14 video])

===Producer and product===
Warhol had assistance in producing his paintings. This is also true of his film-making and commercial enterprises.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

He founded the gossip magazine ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'', a stage for celebrities he &quot;endorsed&quot; and a business staffed by his friends. He collaborated with others on all of his books (some of which were written with Pat Hackett.) He adopted the young painter [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], and the band [[The Velvet Underground]], presenting them to the public as his latest interest, and collaborating with them. One might even say that he produced people (as in the Warholian &quot;Superstar&quot; and the Warholian portrait). He endorsed products, appeared in commercials, and made frequent celebrity guest appearances on television shows and in films (he appeared in everything from ''[[Love Boat]]'' to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and the [[Richard Pryor]] movie, ''Dynamite Chicken'').{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In this respect Warhol was a fan of &quot;Art Business&quot; and &quot;Business Art&quot;– he, in fact, wrote about his interest in thinking about art as business in ''The Philosophy of Andy Warhol from A to B and Back Again''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==Personal life==
===Sexuality===
It is thought that Warhol was [[homosexual]],&lt;ref&gt;(see biographers such as [[Victor Bockris]], [[Bob Colacello]],{{Cite book|first=Bob |last=Colacello |authorlink=Bob Colacello |title=Holy terror: Andy Warhol close up |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=1990 |page= |isbn=0-06-016419-0 |oclc=21196706}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} and art historian Richard Meyer{{Cite book|first=Richard |last=Meyer |title=Outlaw representation: censorship and homosexuality in twentieth-century American art |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |year=2002 |page= |isbn=0-19-510760-8 |oclc=44721027}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and quite likely a virgin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warhol at SVFC&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Religious Art of Andy Warhol |last=Dillinger |first=Jane Daggett |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]] |location=New York |isbn=9780826413345 |page= |pages=16–17 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=KemglT-1jSIC&amp;pg=PA16-IA7&amp;lpg=PA16-IA7&amp;dq=%22Andy+Warhol%22%2BVincent%2BFerrer&amp;q=%22Andy%20Warhol%22%2BVincent%2BFerrer |accessdate=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family maintains that he was not homosexual and was celibate. The question of how Warhol's sexuality influenced his work and shaped his relationship to the art world is a major subject of scholarship on the artist and is an issue that Warhol himself addressed in interviews, in conversation with his contemporaries, and in his publications (''e.g.'' ''Popism: The Warhol Sixties''). Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Many of his most famous works (portraits of [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Judy Garland]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and films like ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]],'' ''My Hustler'' and ''[[Lonesome Cowboys (1968 film)|Lonesome Cowboys]]'') draw from gay underground culture and/or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire. Many of his films premiered in gay porn theaters.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The first works that he submitted to a fine art gallery, homoerotic drawings of male nudes, were rejected for being too openly gay.&lt;ref name=lobel1996&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Michael |last=Lobel |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0425/is_n4_v55/ai_19101783 |title=Warhol's closet&amp;nbsp;— Andy Warhol&amp;nbsp;— We're Here: Gay and Lesbian Presence in Art and Art History |journal=[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]] |year=1966 |month=Winter |accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Popism'', furthermore, the artist recalls a conversation with the film maker [[Emile de Antonio]] about the difficulty Warhol had being accepted socially by the then more famous (but [[closeted]]) gay artists [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. De Antonio explained that Warhol was &quot;too swish and that upsets them.&quot; In response to this, Warhol writes, &quot;There was nothing I could say to that. It was all too true. So I decided I just wasn't going to care, because those were all the things that I didn't want to change anyway, that I didn't think I 'should' want to change... Other people could change their attitudes but not me&quot;.&lt;ref name=popism11-12&gt;{{Cite book|first=Andy |last=Warhol |coauthors=Pat Hacket |title=POPism: the Warhol '60s |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=New York City |year=1980 |pages=11–12 |isbn=0-15-173095-4 |oclc=5673923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Gavin |last=Butt |title=Between you and me: queer disclosures in the New York art world, 1948–1963 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, N.C |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-8223-3486-0 |oclc=57285910}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In exploring Warhol's biography, many turn to this period – the late 1950s and early 1960s – as a key moment in the development of his persona. Some have suggested that his frequent refusal to comment on his work, to speak about himself (confining himself in interviews to responses like &quot;Um, no&quot; and &quot;Um, yes&quot;, and often allowing others to speak for him) – and even the evolution of his pop style – can be traced to the years when Warhol was first dismissed by the inner circles of the New York art world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairbrother&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fairbrother |first=Trevor |chapter=Tomorrow's Man |title=Success Is a Job in New York: the Early Art and Business of Andy Warhol |editor=Donna De Salvo |location=New York City |publisher=Grey Art Gallery and Study Center |year=1989 |pages=55–74 |isbn=0-934349-05-3 |oclc=19826995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious beliefs===
[[File:WarholLastSup.gif|thumb|300px|Images of Jesus from ''The Last Supper'' cycle (1986). Warhol made almost 100 variations on the theme, which the Guggenheim  felt &quot;indicates an almost obsessive investment in the subject matter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Claudia |last=Schmuckli |url=http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/warhol/ |title=Andy Warhol: The Last Supper |publisher=[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]] |location=SoHo |year=1999 |accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Warhol was a practicing [[Ruthenian Catholic Church|Ruthenian Rite Catholic]]. He regularly volunteered at [[homeless shelter]]s in New York, particularly during the busier times of the year, and described himself as a religious person.&lt;ref name=godspy-Warhol&gt;{{Cite journal|first=James |last=Romaine |date=2003-11-12 |title=Transubstantiating the Culture: Andy Warhol's Secret |url=http://oldarchive.godspy.com/culture/Andy-Warhol-Transubstantiating-the-Culture.cfm.html |journal=[[Godspy]] |accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of Warhol's later works depicted religious subjects, including two series, ''Details of Renaissance Paintings'' (1984) and ''[[The Last Supper]]'' (1986). In addition, a body of religious-themed works was found posthumously in his estate.&lt;ref name=godspy-Warhol/&gt;

During his life, Warhol regularly attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and the priest at Warhol's church, [[Church of St. Vincent Ferrer (New York)|Saint Vincent Ferrer]], said that the artist went there almost daily,&lt;ref name=godspy-Warhol/&gt; although he was not observed taking communion or going to confession and sat or knelt in the pews at the back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warhol at SVFC&quot;/&gt;  The priest thought he was afraid of being recognized; Warhol said he was self-conscious about being seen in a [[Latin Rite]] church [[sign of the Cross|crossing himself]] &quot;in the Orthodox way&quot; (right to left instead of the reverse).&lt;ref name=&quot;Warhol at SVFC&quot;/&gt;

His art is noticeably influenced by the eastern Christian [[iconographic]] tradition which was so evident in his places of worship.&lt;ref name=godspy-Warhol/&gt;

Warhol's brother has described the artist as &quot;really religious, but he didn't want people to know about that because [it was] private&quot;. Despite the private nature of his faith, in Warhol's eulogy [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] depicted it as devout: &quot;To my certain knowledge, he was responsible for at least one conversion. He took considerable pride in financing his nephew's studies for the priesthood&quot;.&lt;ref name=godspy-Warhol/&gt;

==Dedicated museums==
Two museums are dedicated to Warhol. [[The Andy Warhol Museum]], one of the [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh]], is located at 117 Sandusky Street in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is the largest American art museum dedicated to a single artist, holding more than 12,000 works by the artist.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The other museum is the [[Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art]], established in 1991 by Warhol's brother [[John Warhola]], the Slovak Ministry of Culture, and the Warhol Foundation in New York. It is located in the small town of [[Medzilaborce]], Slovakia. Warhol's parents and his two eldest brothers were born 15 kilometres away in the village of [[Miková]]. The museum houses several originals donated mainly by the Andy Warhol Foundation in New York and also personal items donated by Warhol's relatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT Obit&quot;&gt;Grimes, William.

==Movies about Warhol==
;Dramatic portrayals

'''Alp Arslan''' (1029 – 15 December 1072) was the third sultan of the [[Seljuq dynasty]] and great-grandson of [[Seljuq]], the [[eponym]]ous founder of the dynasty. He assumed the name of ''Muhammad bin Da'ud Chaghri'' when he embraced [[Islam]], and for his military prowess, personal valour, and fighting skills he obtained the surname '''Alp Arslan''', which means &quot;Warrior Lion&quot; in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

==Career==
[[Image:AlpArslan.PNG|thumb|left|Alp Arslan led [[Seljuq Turks]]  to victory against the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in 1071.]]

He succeeded his father Chagri Begh as governor of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] in 1059. When his uncle [[Toghrül|Toğrül]] died he was succeeded by Suleiman, Alp Arslan's brother. Alp Arslan and his uncle [[Kutalmish]] both contested this succession. Alp Arslan defeated Kutalmish for the throne and succeeded on 27 April 1064 as sultan of [[Great Seljuq]], and thus became sole monarch of [[Iran|Persia]] from the river [[Oxus]] to the [[Tigris]].

In consolidating his empire and subduing contending factions he was ably assisted by [[Nizam ul-Mulk]], his [[vizier]], and one of the most eminent statesmen in early [[Muslim]] history.  With peace and security established in his dominions, he convoked an assembly of the states and declared his son [[Malik Shah I]] his heir and successor.  With the hope of capturing [[Caesarea Mazaca]], the capital of [[Cappadocia]], he placed himself at the head of the Turkish cavalry, crossed the [[Euphrates]] and entered and invaded the city. He then marched into [[Armenia]] and [[History of Georgia (country)|Georgia]], which he conquered in 1064.

==Byzantine struggle==
In 1068, en route to Syria, Alp Arslan Oush invaded the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Byzantine Emperors|Emperor]] [[Romanos IV]] Diogenes, assuming the command in person, met the invaders in [[Cilicia]]. In three arduous campaigns, the first two of which were conducted by the emperor himself while the third was directed by Manuel Comnenos (great-uncle  of Emperor [[Manuel Comnenus|Manuel Comnenos]]), the Turks were defeated in detail in 1070 and driven across the Euphrates. In 1071 Romanos again took the field and advanced with possibly 30,000 men, including a contingent of the [[Cuman]] Turks as well as contingents of [[Franks]] and [[Normans]], under [[Roussel de Bailleul|Ursel de Baieul]], into Armenia.

At [[Manzikert]], on the [[Murad Tchai]], north of [[Lake Van]], Diogenes was met by Alp Arslan. The sultan proposed terms of peace, which were rejected by the emperor, and the two forces met in the [[Battle of Manzikert]].  The [[Cuman]] mercenaries among the Byzantine forces immediately defected to the Turkish side; and, seeing this, &quot;the Western mercenaries rode off and took no part in the battle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The First Crusade|first= Steve|last= Runciman|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Byzantines were totally routed.

Emperor Romanos IV was himself taken prisoner and conducted into the presence of Alp Arslan, who treated him with generosity, and, terms of peace having been agreed to, dismissed him, loaded with presents and respectfully attended by a military guard. 

Alp Arslan's victories changed the balance in near Asia completely in favour of the [[Seljuq Turks]] and [[Sunnite|Sunni]] Muslims. While the Byzantine Empire was to continue for nearly another four centuries, and the Crusades would contest the issue for some time, the victory at Manzikert signalled the beginning of Turkish ascendancy in [[Anatolia]]. Most historians, including [[Edward Gibbon]], date the defeat at Manzikert as the beginning of the end of the Eastern Roman Empire. Certainly the entry of Turkic farmers following their horsemen ended the themes in Anatolia which had furnished the Empire with men and treasure.

==State organization==
[[File:BnF Fr232 fol323 Alp Arslan Romanus.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Alp Arslan humiliating Emperor [[Romanos IV]] after the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. From a 15th-century illustrated French translation of [[Boccacio]]'s ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium]].]]
Alp Arslan's strength lay in the military realm.  Domestic affairs were handled by his able vizier, [[Nizam al-Mulk]], the founder of the administrative organization which characterized and strengthened the sultanate during the reigns of Alp Arslan and his son, Malik Shah. Military [[fiefs]], governed by Seljuk princes, were established to provide support for the soldiery and to accommodate the nomadic Turks to the established Anatolian agricultural scene.  This type of military fiefdom enabled the nomadic Turks to draw on the resources of the sedentary Persians, Turks and other established cultures within the Seljuq realm, and allowed Alp Arslan to field a huge standing army, without depending on tribute from conquest to pay his soldiery.  He not only had enough food from his subjects to maintain his military, but the taxes collected from traders and merchants added to his coffers sufficiently to fund his continuous wars.

According to the poet [[Saadi Shirazi]]: ''Arslan possessed a fort, which raised at the height of [[Alwand]], from all were those within its walls, for its roads were a labyrinth, like the curls of a bride. From a learned traveler Arslan once inquired: &quot;Didst thou ever, in thy wanderings, see a fort as strong as this?&quot;. &quot;Splendid it is,&quot; was the travelers reply, &quot;but methinks not it confers much strength. Before thee, did not other kings possess it for a while, then pass away? After thee, will not other kings assume control, and eat the fruits of the tree of thy hope?&quot;''

''In the estimation of the wise, the world is a false gem that passes each moment from one hand to another.'' (the fort was sacked by the Mongols led by [[Hulagu]]).

[[Suleyman I of Rûm|Suleiman ibn Kutalmish]] was the son of the contender for Arslan's throne; he was appointed governor of the north-western provinces and assigned to completing invasion of Anatolia. An explanation for this choice can only be conjectured from [[Ibn al-Athir]]’s account of the battle between Alp-Arslan and [[Kutalmish]], in which he writes that Alp-Arslan wept for the latter's death and greatly mourned the loss of his kinsman.

==Death==
The dominion of Alp Arslan after Manzikert extended over much of western [[Asia]]. He soon prepared to march to the conquest of [[Turkestan]], the original seat of his ancestors. With a powerful army he advanced to the banks of the Oxus. Before he could pass the river with safety, however, it was necessary to subdue certain fortresses, one of which was for several days vigorously defended by the governor, [[Yussuf el-Harezmi]], a [[Khwarezmid Empire|Khwarezmian]].  He was, however, obliged to surrender and was carried a prisoner before the sultan, who condemned him to death.  Yussuf, in desperation, drew his dagger and rushed upon the sultan.  Alp Arslan, who took great pride in his reputation as the foremost archer of his time, motioned to his guards not to interfere and drew his bow, but his foot slipped, the arrow glanced aside and he received the assassin's dagger in his breast. Alp Arslan died four days later from this wound on 25 November 1072 in his 42nd year, and was taken to [[Merv]] to be buried next to his father [[Çağrı Bey]]. Upon his tomb lies the following inscription:

:'''“''O those who saw the sky-high grandeur of Alp Arslan, behold! He is under the black soil now''...”'''

As he lay dying, Alp Arslan whispered to his son that his vanity had killed him.  &quot;Alas,&quot; he is recorded to have said, &quot;surrounded by great warriors devoted to my cause, guarded night and day by them, I should have allowed them to do their job.  I had been warned against trying to protect myself, and against letting my courage get in the way of my good sense.  I forgot those warnings, and here I lie, dying in agony.  Remember well the lessons learned, and do not allow your vanity to overreach your good sense...&quot;

==Legacy==
Alp Arslan's conquest of Anatolia from the Byzantines is also seen as one of the pivotal precursors to the launch of the [[crusade]]s.

From 2002 to July 2008 under [[Renaming of Turkmen months and days of week, 2002|Turkmen calendar reform]], the month of August was named after Alp Arslan.

The '''American Film Institute''' is an independent [[non-profit organization]] created by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], which was established in 1967 when President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=History of AFI| url=http://www.afi.com/about/history.aspx| date=| accessdate=2011-04-12| publisher=afi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization describes itself as &quot;a national institute providing leadership in screen education and the recognition and celebration of excellence in the art of film, television and [[digital media]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=What is AFI?| url=http://www.afi.com/about/whatis.aspx| date=| publisher=afi.com| accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[AFI Conservatory]] focuses on training through hands-on experience with established artists. 

The American Film Institute operated the National Film Theatre in [[Washington D.C.]]'s [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] until 1998.  Prior to Kennedy Center, it screened films in the auditorium of the [[National Gallery of Art]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jenkins&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=Off With the Show| author=Mark Jenkins| date=8 October 2004| url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/29447/off-with-the-show| work=Washington City Paper| accessdate=2011-05-12| publisher=washingtoncitypaper.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2003, AFI re-opened the 1938 [[AFI Silver]] theatre in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] just north of Washington.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyer&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=A Dose of Art and Entertainment Revives a Suburb| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/realestate/commercial/13silver.html?ref=americanfilminstitute| author=Eugene L. Meyer| date=13 June 2007| work=New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The American Film Institute was founded in 1967 as a national arts organization to preserve the legacy of America’s film heritage, educate the next generation of filmmakers and honor the artists and their work. The National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities recommended creating AFI “to enrich and nurture the art of film in America” with initial funding from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] and the [[Ford Foundation]]. The original 22-member Board of Trustees included Chair [[Gregory Peck]] and Vice Chair [[Sidney Poitier]] as well as [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]], [[Jack Valenti]] and other representatives from the arts and academia.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

[[George Stevens, Jr.]], served as director from the institute's founding until 1980. He was followed by [[Jean Picker Firstenberg]] who held the position of President and CEO from 1980 to 2007. Bob Gazzale was named President and CEO in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; As a national nonprofit organization, the institute funds its efforts through foundation and government grants, contributions and sponsorships from large corporations and small companies, donations from individuals and its AFI membership program.

==AFI Conservatory==
The AFI Conservatory describes itself as a “world-renowned Conservatory where a dedicated group of working professionals from the film and television communities serve as mentors in a hands-on, production-based environment nurturing the talents of tomorrow's storytellers.” In a two-year program that emphasizes narrative storytelling and grants an MFA, Fellows specialize in one of six disciplines: Cinematography, Directing, Editing, Production Design, Producing and Screenwriting.

In 1969, the institute established the Center for Advanced Film Studies at Greystone, the Doheny Mansion in Beverly Hills, CA. The first class included filmmakers [[Terrence Malick]], [[David Lynch]], [[Caleb Deschanel]] and [[Paul Schrader]]. That program grew into the [[AFI Conservatory]], a fully accredited graduate film school, located in the hills above Hollywood, CA.

{{nihongo|'''Akira Kurosawa'''|黒澤 明 or 黒沢 明|Kurosawa Akira|extra=March 23, 1910 – September 6, 1998}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[film director]], [[film producer|producer]], [[screenwriter]] and [[film editing|editor]]. Regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema, Kurosawa directed 30 films&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;In 1946, Kurosawa co-directed, with Hideo Sekigawa and Kajiro Yamamoto, the feature ''[[Those Who Make Tomorrow]]'' (''Asu o tsukuru hitobito''); apparently, he was commanded to make this film by [[Toho]] studios, to which he was under contract at the time. (He claimed that the film was shot in only a week.) It was the only film he ever directed for which he did not receive sole credit and the only one that has never been released on home video in any form. The movie was later repudiated by Kurosawa and is often not counted with the 30 other films he made, though it is listed in some filmographies of the director. See Galbraith, pp. 65–67, and Kurosawa's [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] page.&lt;/ref&gt; in a career spanning 57 years. 

Kurosawa entered the [[Japanese film]] industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an [[assistant director]] and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director in 1943, during [[World War II]] with the popular [[action film]] ''[[Sanshiro Sugata]]'' (a.k.a. ''Judo Saga''). After the war, the critically acclaimed ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor [[Toshirō Mifune]] in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films. 

''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', which premiered in [[Tokyo]] in August [[1950 in film|1950]], and which also starred Mifune, became, on September 10, 1951, the surprise winner of the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] and was subsequently released in Europe and North America. The commercial and critical success of this film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry, which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese film artists. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Kurosawa directed approximately a film a year, including a number of highly regarded films such as ''[[Ikiru]]'' (1952), ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954) and ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961). After the mid-1960s, he became much less prolific, but his later work—including his final two epics, ''[[Kagemusha]]'' (1980) and ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'' (1985)—continued to win awards, including the [[Palme d'Or]] for ''Kagemusha'', though more often abroad than in Japan. 

In 1990, he accepted the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Honorary Award|Lifetime Achievement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:pumHme2SFiQJ:aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/ics-wpd/url.ashx%3Fid%3D062-25%26qn%3DAAspeeches+Kurosawa+site:http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us |title=Academy Award Acceptance Speech Database |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRiBBehTnZU |title=Akira Kurosawa Tribute with George Lucas, Steven Spielberg |date=2008-11-19 |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posthumously, he was named &quot;[[Asian of the Century]]&quot; in the &quot;Arts, Literature, and Culture&quot; category by ''[[AsianWeek]]'' magazine and [[CNN]], cited as &quot;one of the [five] people who contributed most to the betterment of Asia in the past 100 years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/features/aoc/aoc.kurosawa.html|title=ASIANOW – Asiaweek – Asian of the Century – Kurosawa Akira – 12/10/99 |accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
===Childhood and youth (1910–1935)===
Kurosawa was born on 23 March 1910 in Ōimachi in the [[Ōmori]] district of [[Tokyo]]. His father Isamu, a member of a former [[samurai]] family from the [[Akita Prefecture]], worked as the director of the Army's Physical Education Institute's [[Secondary education in Japan#Middle school|lower secondary school]], while his mother Shima came from a merchant's family living in [[Osaka]]. Akira was the eighth and youngest child of the moderately wealthy family, with two of his siblings already grown up at the time of his birth and one deceased, leaving Kurosawa to grow up with three sisters and a brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurosawa 1983 17&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to promoting physical exercise, Isamu Kurosawa was open to western traditions and saw theater and motion pictures as educationally valuable. He encouraged his children to watch films; young Akira viewed his first movies at the age of six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important formative influence was his [[Elementary schools in Japan|elementary school]] teacher Mr Tachikawa, whose progressive educational practices ignited in his young pupil first a love of drawing and then an interest in education in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the boy also studied [[calligraphy]] and [[Kendo]] swordsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ryounkaku before and after Great Kanto earthquake.JPG‎|thumb|upright|Tokyo's famous [[Ryōunkaku|Ryounkaku]], a twelve-story skyscraper designed by the Scottish engineer [[W. K. Burton]] and the tallest building in Japan at that time, before and after the [[1923 Great Kanto Earthquake]]. The building was razed shortly after the later photo was taken.|alt=Two photos side by side: the one to the left shows a 12-story building, the Ryounkaku skyscraper of the 1920s, looking new and imposing within its neighborhood; the one on the right shows the same building as a ruin, with the top gone and leaning to one side, amid an area of complete devastation.]]
Another major childhood influence was Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by four years. In the aftermath of the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]] of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heigo was academically gifted, but soon after failing to secure a place in Tokyo's foremost [[Secondary education in Japan#Upper secondary school|high school]], he began to detach himself from the rest of the family, preferring to concentrate on his interest in foreign literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurosawa 1983 17&quot;/&gt; In the late 1920s, Heigo became a [[benshi]] (silent film narrator) for Tokyo theaters showing foreign films, and quickly made a name for himself. Akira, who at this point planned to become a painter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; moved in with him, and the two brothers became inseparable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galbraith IV 2002 19&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Heigo, Akira devoured not only films but also theater and circus performances,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=72–74, 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; while exhibiting his paintings and working for the [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] Proletarian Artists' League. However, he was never able to make a living with his art, and, as he began to perceive most of the proletarian movement as &quot;putting unfulfilled political ideals directly onto the canvas,&quot; he lost his enthusiasm for painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increasing production of [[Sound film|talking pictures]] in the early 1930s, film narrators like Heigo began to lose work, and Akira moved back in with his parents. In July 1933, Heigo committed suicide. Kurosawa has commented on the lasting sense of loss he felt at his brother's death&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the chapter of his autobiography that describes it—written nearly half a century after the event—is titled, &quot;A Story I Don't Want to Tell.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;story&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only four months later, Kurosawa's eldest brother also died, leaving Akira, at age 23, the only one of the Kurosawa brothers still living, together with his three surviving sisters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galbraith IV 2002 19&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;story&quot;/&gt;

===Director in training (1935–1941)===
In 1935, the new film studio Photo Chemical Laboratories, known as P.C.L. (which later became the major studio, [[Toho]]), advertised for assistant directors. Although he had demonstrated no previous interest in film as a profession, Kurosawa submitted the required essay, which asked applicants to discuss the fundamental deficiencies of Japanese films and find ways to overcome them. His half-mocking view was that if the deficiencies were fundamental, there was no way to correct them. Kurosawa's essay earned him a call to take the follow-up exams, and director [[Kajirō Yamamoto]], who was among the examiners, took a liking to Kurosawa and insisted that the studio hire him. The 25-year-old Kurosawa joined P.C.L. in February 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=89–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his five years as an assistant director, Kurosawa worked under numerous directors, but by far the most important figure in his development was Kajiro Yamamoto. Of his 24 films as A.D., he worked on 17 under Yamamoto, many of them comedies featuring the popular actor [[Kenichi Enomoto]], known as &quot;Enoken.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=652–658 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yamamoto nurtured Kurosawa's talent, promoting him directly from third assistant director to chief assistant director after a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa's responsibilities increased, and he worked at tasks ranging from stage construction and film development to location scouting, script polishing, rehearsals, lighting, dubbing, editing and second-unit directing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodwin|1994|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last of Kurosawa's films as an assistant director, ''Horse'' (''Uma'', 1941), Kurosawa took over most of the production, as Yamamoto was occupied with the shooting of another film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important piece of advice Yamamoto gave Kurosawa was that a good director needed to master screenwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa soon realized that the potential earnings from his scripts were much higher than what he was paid as an assistant director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodwin|1994|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa would later write or co-write all of his own films. He also frequently wrote screenplays for other directors. This outside scriptwriting would serve Kurosawa as a lucrative sideline lasting well into the 1960s, long after he became world-famous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000041/#writer |title=Akira Kurosawa |accessdate=2010-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=658–707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime films and marriage (1942–1945)===
In the two years following the release of ''Horse'' in 1941, Kurosawa searched for a story he could use to launch his directing career. Towards the end of 1942, about a year after the beginning of Japan's war with the United States, novelist Tsuneo Tomita published his [[Musashi (novel)|Musashi Miyamoto]] inspired [[judo]] novel, ''Sanshiro Sugata'', the advertisements for which intrigued Kurosawa. He bought the book on its publication day, devoured it in one sitting, and immediately asked Toho to secure the film rights. Kurosawa's initial instinct proved correct as, within a few days, three other major Japanese studios also offered to buy the rights. Toho prevailed, and Kurosawa began pre-production on his debut work as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=121–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shooting of ''[[Sanshiro Sugata]]'' began on location in Yokohama in December 1942. Production proceeded smoothly, but getting the completed film past the censors was an entirely different matter. The censorship considered the work too &quot;British-American&quot; (an accusation tantamount, at that time, to a charge of treason), and it was only through the intervention of director [[Yasujiro Ozu]], who championed the film, that ''Sanshiro Sugata'' was finally accepted for release on March 25, 1943. (Kurosawa had just turned 33.) The movie became both a critical and commercial success. Nevertheless, the censorship office would later decide to cut out some 18 minutes of footage, much of which is now considered lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=43, 45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=124–128, 130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He next turned to the subject of wartime female factory workers in ''[[The Most Beautiful]]'', a propaganda film which he shot in a semi-documentary style in early 1944. In order to coax realistic performances from his actresses, the director had them live in a real factory during the shoot, eat the factory food and call each other by their character names. He would use similar methods with his performers throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=132–135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=46–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During production, the actress playing the leader of the factory workers, [[Yōko Yaguchi]], was chosen by her colleagues to present their demands to the director. She and Kurosawa were constantly at loggerheads, and it was through these arguments that the two, paradoxically, became close. They married on May 21, 1945, with Yaguchi two months pregnant (she never resumed her acting career), and the couple would remain together until her death in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=137–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=55–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would have two children: a son, Hisao, born December 20, 1945, who would serve as producer on some of his father's last projects, and [[Kazuko Kurosawa|Kazuko]], born April 29, 1954, who would become a costume designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=64, 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before his marriage, Kurosawa was pressured by the studio against his will to direct a sequel to his debut film. The often blatantly propagandistic ''[[Sanshiro Sugata Part II]]'', which premiered in May 1945, is generally considered one of his very weakest pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=135–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=51–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa decided to write the script for a film that would be both censor-friendly and less expensive to produce. ''[[The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail]]'', based on the Kabuki play ''[[Kanjinchō]]'' and starring the comedian Enoken, with whom Kurosawa had often worked during his assistant director days, was completed in September 1945. By this time, Japan had surrendered and the [[occupation of Japan]] had begun. The new American censors interpreted the values allegedly promoted in the picture as overly &quot;feudal&quot; and banned the work. (It would not be released until 1952, the year another Kurosawa film, ''Ikiru'', was also released.) Ironically, while in production, the film had already been savaged by Japanese wartime censors as too Western and &quot;democratic&quot; (they particularly disliked the comic porter played by Enoken), so the movie most probably would not have seen the light of day even if the war had continued beyond its completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=660–661}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|2001|pp=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First postwar works (1946–1950)===
The war now ended, Kurosawa, absorbing the democratic ideals of the Occupation, sought to make films that would establish a new respect towards the individual and the self. The first such film, ''[[No Regrets for Our Youth]]'' (1946), inspired by both the 1933 [[Takigawa incident]] and the [[Hotsumi Ozaki]] wartime spy case, criticized Japan's prewar regime for its political oppression. Atypically for the director, the heroic central character is a woman, Yukie ([[Setsuko Hara]]), born into upper-middle-class privilege, who comes to question her values in a time of political crisis. The original script had to be extensively rewritten and, because of its controversial theme (and because the protagonist was a woman), the completed work divided critics, but it nevertheless managed to win the approval of audiences, who turned variations on the film's title (&quot;No regrets for...&quot;) into something of a postwar [[catch phrase|catchphrase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=70–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=114–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His next film, ''[[One Wonderful Sunday]]'' premiered in July 1947 to mixed reviews. It is a relatively uncomplicated and sentimental love story dealing with an impoverished postwar couple trying to enjoy, within the devastation of postwar Tokyo, their one weekly day off. The movie bears the influence of [[Frank Capra]], [[D. W. Griffith]] and [[F. W. Murnau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=43–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=87–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another film released in 1947 with Kurosawa's involvement was the [[action film|action-adventure thriller]], ''[[Snow Trail]]'', directed by [[Senkichi Taniguchi]] from Kurosawa's screenplay. It marked the debut of the intense young actor Toshirō Mifune. It was Kurosawa who, with his mentor Yamamoto, had intervened to persuade Toho to sign Mifune, during an audition in which the young man greatly impressed Kurosawa, but managed to alienate most of the other judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=159–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drunken-Angel-1a.jpg|thumb|[[Toshirō Mifune]] electrified audiences as a rebellious but critically ill gangster in ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' (1948), considered Akira Kurosawa's breakthrough film.|alt=Photo of the very young Japanese actor, Toshiro Mifune in the late 1940s, facing left, his hair hanging over his forehead, with an intense and angry look on his face.]]
''[[Drunken Angel]]'' is often considered the director's first major work. Although the script, like all of Kurosawa's occupation-era works, had to go through forced rewrites due to American censorship, Kurosawa felt that this was the first film in which he was able to express himself freely. A grittily realistic story of a doctor who tries to save a gangster ([[yakuza]]) with [[tuberculosis]], it was also the director's first film with Toshirō Mifune, who would proceed to play either the main or a major characters in all but one (''Ikiru'') of the director's next 16 films. While Mifune was not cast as the protagonist in ''Drunken Angel'', his explosive performance as the gangster so dominates the drama that he shifted the focus from the title character, the alcoholic doctor played by [[Takashi Shimura]], who had already appeared in several Kurosawa movies. However, Kurosawa did not want to smother the young actor's immense vitality, and Mifune's rebellious character electrified audiences in much the way that [[Marlon Brando]]'s defiant stance would startle American film audiences a few years later. The film premiered in Tokyo in April 1948 to rave reviews and was chosen by the prestigious [[Kinema Junpo]] critics poll as the best film of its year, the first of three Kurosawa movies to be so honored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=161–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=94–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=47–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa, with producer Sōjirō Motoki and fellow directors and friends Kajiro Yamamoto, [[Mikio Naruse]] and [[Senkichi Taniguchi]], formed a new independent production unit called Film Art Association (Eiga Geijutsu Kyōkai). For this organization's debut work, and first film for [[Kadokawa Pictures|Daiei studios]], Kurosawa turned to a contemporary play by Kazuo Kikuta and, together with Taniguchi, adapted it for the screen. ''[[The Quiet Duel]]'' starred Toshirō Mifune as an idealistic young doctor struggling with [[syphilis]], a deliberate attempt by Kurosawa to break the actor away from being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as gangsters. Released in March 1949, it was a box office success, but is generally considered one of the director's lesser achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=54–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=100–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=140–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second film of 1949, also produced by Film Art Association and released by [[Shintōhō]], was ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]''. The most celebrated of Kurosawa's works from this period, it is a detective movie (perhaps the first important Japanese film in that genre) that explores the mood of Japan during its painful postwar recovery through the story of a young detective, played by Mifune, and his obsession over his handgun, stolen by a penniless young man who proceeds to use it to rob and murder. Adapted from an unpublished novel by Kurosawa in the style of a favorite writer of his, [[Georges Simenon]], it was the director's first collaboration with screenwriter Ryuzo Kikushima, who would later help to script eight other Kurosawa films. A famous, virtually wordless sequence, lasting over eight minutes, shows the detective, disguised as an impoverished veteran, wandering the streets in search of the gun thief; it employed actual documentary footage of war-ravaged Tokyo neighborhoods shot by Kurosawa's friend, [[Ishirō Honda]], the future director of ''Gojira'' (aka, ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=172–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=108–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=58–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Scandal (1950 film)|Scandal]]'', released by [[Shochiku]] in April 1950, was inspired by the director's personal experiences with, and anger towards, Japanese [[yellow journalism]]. The work is an ambitious mixture of courtroom drama and social problem film about free speech and personal responsibility, but even Kurosawa regarded the finished product as dramatically unfocused and unsatisfactory, and almost all critics agree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=177–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=65–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=118–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it would be Kurosawa's ''second'' film of 1950, ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', that would ultimately win him a whole new audience.

===International recognition (1950–1958)===
After finishing ''Scandal'', Kurosawa was approached by [[Kadokawa Pictures|Daiei studios]], which asked the director to make another film for them. Kurosawa picked a script by an aspiring young screenwriter, [[Shinobu Hashimoto]]. (They would eventually write nine films together.) It was based on [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]]'s experimental short story ''[[In a Grove]]'', which recounts the murder of a samurai and the rape of his wife from various different and conflicting points-of-view. Kurosawa saw potential in the script, and with Hashimoto's help, polished and expanded it and then pitched it to Daiei, who were happy to accept the project due to its low budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=127–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rashomon 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Machiko Kyo]] and Toshirō Mifune in a scene from ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' (1950). The film's innovative storytelling and novel approach to film acting, photography and editing amazed audiences throughout the world.|alt=A photo of two actors, Toshiro Mifune and Machiko Kyo, within a forest, in a scene from the 1950 Japanese film, ''Rashomon'': Ms. Kyo, a young and attractive woman, is seen in an 11th Century period kimono at left of frame, kneeling at Mifune's feet; Mifune, at right of frame, wearing the rough costume of a bandit of that period, is looking down at Ms. Kyo as she appears to plead with him.]]

Shooting of ''Rashomon'' began on July 7, 1950 and, after extensive location work in the primeval forest of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], wrapped on August 17. Just one week was spent in hurried post-production, hampered by a studio fire, and the finished film premiered at Tokyo's Imperial Theatre on August 25, expanding nationwide the following day. The movie was met by lukewarm reviews, with many critics puzzled by its unique theme and treatment, but it was nevertheless a moderate financial success for Daiei.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=180–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nogami|pp=82–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa's next film, for Shochiku, was ''[[The Idiot (film)|The Idiot]]'', an adaptation of the novel by the director's favorite writer, [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]. The filmmaker relocated the story from [[Russia]] to [[Hokkaido]], but it is otherwise very faithful to the original, a fact seen by many critics as detrimental to the work. A studio-mandated edit shortened it from Kurosawa's original cut of 265 minutes (nearly four-and-a-half hours) to just 166 minutes, making the resulting narrative exceedingly difficult to follow. It is widely considered today to be one of the director's least successful works. Contemporary reviews were very negative, but the film was a moderate success at the box office, largely because of the popularity of one of its stars, Setsuko Hara.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=144–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=135–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=190–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=81–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Kurosawa, ''Rashomon'' had been entered in the prestigious [[Venice Film Festival]], due to the efforts of Giuliana Stramigioli, a Japan-based representative of an Italian film company, who had seen and admired the movie and convinced Daiei to submit it. On September 10, 1951, ''Rashomon'' was awarded the festival's highest prize, the [[Golden Lion]], shocking not only Daiei but the international film world, which at the time was largely unaware of Japan's decades-old cinematic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Daiei very briefly exhibited a subtitled print of the film in Los Angeles, [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] purchased distribution rights to ''Rashomon'' in the United States. The company was taking a considerable gamble. It had put out only one prior subtitled film in the American market, and the only previous Japanese talkie commercially released in New York had been [[Mikio Naruse]]'s comedy, ''Wife! Be Like a Rose'', in 1937: a critical and box-office flop. However, ''Rashomon'''s commercial run, greatly helped by strong reviews from critics and even the columnist [[Ed Sullivan]], was very successful. (It earned $35,000 in its first three weeks at a single New York theater, an almost unheard-of sum at the time.) This success in turn led to a vogue in America for Japanese movies throughout the 1950s, replacing the enthusiasm for [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=137–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The film was also released, by other distributors, in France, West Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042876/releaseinfo |title=Rashômon (1950) – Release dates|accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Japanese filmmakers whose work, as a result, began to win festival prizes and commercial release in the West were Kenji Mizoguchi (''[[The Life of Oharu]]'', ''[[Ugetsu]]'', ''[[Sansho the Bailiff]]'') and, somewhat later, Yasujiro Ozu (''[[Tokyo Story]]'', ''[[An Autumn Afternoon]]'')—artists highly respected in Japan but, prior to this period, almost totally unknown in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|pp=35, 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later generations of Japanese filmmakers who would find acclaim outside Japan—from [[Nagisa Oshima]] and [[Shohei Imamura]] to [[Juzo Itami]], [[Takeshi Kitano]] and [[Takashi Miike]]—were able to pass through the door that Kurosawa was the very first to open.

His career boosted by his sudden international fame, Kurosawa, now reunited with his original film studio, Toho (which would go on to produce his next 11 films), set to work on his next project, ''[[Ikiru]]''. The movie stars Takashi Shimura as a cancer-ridden Tokyo bureaucrat, Watanabe, on a final quest for meaning before his death. For the screenplay, Kurosawa brought in Hashimoto as well as writer Hideo Oguni, who would go on to co-write 12 Kurosawa films. Despite the work's grim subject matter, the screenwriters took a satirical approach, which some have compared to the work of [[Berthold Brecht|Brecht]], to both the bureaucratic world of its hero and the U.S. cultural colonization of Japan. (American pop songs figure prominently in the film.) Because of this strategy, the filmmakers are usually credited with saving the picture from the kind of sentimentality common to dramas about characters with terminal illnesses. ''Ikiru'' opened in October 1952 to rave reviews—it won Kurosawa his second Kinema Junpo &quot;Best Film&quot; award—and enormous box office success. It remains the most acclaimed of all the artist's films set in the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=155–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=86–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=99–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1952, Kurosawa took his ''Ikiru'' screenwriters, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni, for a forty-five day secluded residence at an inn to create the screenplay for his next movie, ''[[Seven Samurai]]''. The [[ensemble cast|ensemble]] work was Kurosawa's first proper [[samurai cinema|samurai film]], the genre for which he would become most famous. The simple story, about a poor farming village in [[Sengoku period]] Japan that hires a group of samurai to defend it against an impending attack by bandits, was given a full epic treatment, with a huge cast (largely consisting of veterans of previous Kurosawa productions) and meticulously detailed action, stretching out to almost three-and-a-half hours of screen time.&lt;ref name=&quot;seven&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=170–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three months were spent in pre-production and a month in rehearsals. Shooting took up 148 days spread over almost a year, interrupted by production and financing troubles and Kurosawa's health problems. The film finally opened in April 1954, half a year behind its original release date and about three times over budget, making it at the time the most expensive Japanese film ever made. (However, by Hollywood standards, it was a quite modestly budgeted production, even for that time). The film received positive critical reaction and became a big hit, quickly making back the money invested in it and providing the studio with a product that they could, and did, market internationally—though with extensive edits. Over time—and with the theatrical and home video releases of the uncut version—its reputation has steadily grown. It is now regarded by some commentators as the greatest Japanese film ever made, and in 1979, a poll of Japanese film critics also voted it the best Japanese film ever made.&lt;ref name=&quot;seven&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=97–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Akira Kurosawa on the set.jpeg|thumb|Kurosawa on the set of ''Throne of Blood''|alt=Kurosawa, a tall, thin man in early middle age facing left, wearing modern clothes topped by a soft white cap, strolls through a foggy landscape, as behind him various actors in medieval Japanese garb appear on horseback or lying or sitting on the ground.]]
In 1954, nuclear tests in the Pacific were causing radioactive rainstorms in Japan (the only country ever to have been the victim of an atomic bombing), and one particular [[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|incident]] in March had exposed a Japanese fishing boat to [[nuclear fallout]], with disastrous results. It is in this anxious atmosphere that Kurosawa's next film, ''[[I Live in Fear|Record of a Living Being]]'', was conceived. The story concerned an elderly factory owner (Toshirō Mifune) so terrified of the prospect of a nuclear attack that he becomes determined to move his entire extended family (both legal and extra-marital) to what he imagines is the safety of a farm in Brazil. Production went much more smoothly than the director's previous film, but a few days before shooting ended, Kurosawa's composer, collaborator and close friend [[Fumio Hayasaka]] passed away (of tuberculosis) at the age of only 41. The film's score was finished by Hayasaka's student, [[Masaru Satō]], who would go on to score all of Kurosawa's next eight films. ''Record of a Living Being'' opened in November 1955 to mixed reviews and muted audience reaction, becoming the first Kurosawa film to lose money during its original theatrical run. Today, it is considered by many to be among the finest films dealing with the psychological effects of the global nuclear stalemate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=214–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodwin|1994|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=159–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa's next project, ''Throne of Blood'', a lavishly produced adaptation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]''—set, like ''Seven Samurai'', in the Sengoku Era—represented an ambitious transposition of the English work into an Asian context. Kurosawa instructed his leading actress, [[Isuzu Yamada]], to regard the work as if it were a cinematic version of a ''Japanese'' rather than a European literary classic. Appropriately, the acting of the players, particularly Yamada, draws heavily on the stylized techniques of the Noh theater. It was filmed in 1956 and released in January 1957 to a slightly less negative domestic response than had been the case with the director's previous film. Abroad, ''Throne of Blood'', regardless of the liberties it takes with its source material, quickly earned a place among the most celebrated Shakespeare adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=230–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=115–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa (WNET)|loc=bonus materials: Isuzu Yamada interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=142–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another adaptation of a classic European theatrical work followed almost immediately, with production of ''[[The Lower Depths (1957 film)|The Lower Depths]]'', based on a  [[The Lower Depths|play]] by [[Maxim Gorky]], taking place in May and June 1957.  In contrast to the gigantic scope and sweep of ''Throne of Blood'', ''The Lower Depths'' was shot on only two confined sets, the better to emphasize the restricted nature of the characters' lives. Though faithful to the play, this adaptation of Russian material to a completely Japanese setting—in this case, the late [[Tokugawa era|Edo period]]—unlike his earlier ''The Idiot'', was regarded as artistically successful. The film premiered in September 1957, receiving a mixed response similar to that of ''Throne of Blood''. However, some critics rank it among the director's most underrated works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=239–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=149–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|pp=171, 185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=125–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa's three consecutive movies after ''Seven Samurai'' had not managed to capture Japanese audiences in the way that that film had. The mood of the director's work had been growing increasingly pessimistic and dark, with the possibility of redemption through personal responsibility now very much questioned, particularly in ''Throne of Blood'' and ''The Lower Depths''. He recognized this,  and deliberately aimed for a more light-hearted and entertaining film for his next production, while switching to the new [[widescreen]] format that had been gaining popularity in Japan. The resulting film, ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'', is an [[Action film|action-adventure]] comedy-drama about a medieval princess, her loyal general and two peasants who all need to travel through enemy lines in order to reach their home region. Released in December 1958, ''The Hidden Fortress'' became an enormous box office success in Japan and was warmly received by critics. Today, the film is considered one of Kurosawa's most lightweight efforts, though it remains popular, not least because it is one of several major influences (as [[George Lucas]] himself has conceded) on Lucas' hugely popular 1977 [[space opera]], ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=253–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=134–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Star Wars|loc=George Lucas commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth of a company and the end of an era (1959–1965)===
Starting with ''Rashomon'', Kurosawa's productions had become increasingly large in scope and so had the director's budgets. Toho, concerned about this development, suggested that he might help finance his own works, therefore making the studio's potential losses smaller, while in turn allowing himself more artistic freedom as co-producer. Kurosawa agreed, and Kurosawa Production Company was established in April 1959, with Toho as majority shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite now risking his own money, Kurosawa chose a story more directly critical of the Japanese business and political elites than any of his previous works. ''[[The Bad Sleep Well]]'', based on a script by Kurosawa's nephew Mike Inoue, is a revenge drama about a young man who climbs the hierarchy of a corrupt Japanese company with the intention of exposing the men responsible for his father's death. Its theme proved topical: while the film was in production, mass demonstrations were held against the new [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|U.S.-Japan Security treaty]], which was seen by many Japanese, particularly the young, as threatening the country's democracy by giving too much power to corporations and politicians. The film opened in September 1960 to positive critical reaction and modest box office success. The 25-minute opening sequence, depicting a corporate wedding reception interrupted by reporters and police (who arrest an executive for corruption), is widely regarded as one of Kurosawa's most skillfully-executed set pieces, but the remainder of the film is often perceived as disappointing by comparison. The movie has also been criticized for employing the conventional Kurosawan hero to combat a social evil that cannot be resolved through the actions of individuals, however courageous or cunning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=140–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=286–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=175–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (''The Bodyguard''), Kurosawa Production's second film, centers on a masterless samurai, Sanjuro, who strolls into a 19th Century town ruled by two opposing violent factions and provokes them into destroying each other. The director used this work to play with many genre conventions, particularly the [[Western (genre)|Western]], while at the same time offering an unprecedentedly (for the Japanese screen) graphic portrayal of violence. Some commentators have seen the Sanjuro character in this film as a fantasy figure who magically reverses the historical triumph of the corrupt merchant class over the samurai class. Featuring [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] in his first major role in a Kurosawa movie, and with innovative photography by [[Kazuo Miyagawa]] (who shot ''Rashomon'') and Takao Saito, the film premiered in April 1961 and was an immense success at the box office, earning more than any previous Kurosawa film. Critical reaction was equally positive, and the film proved a major influence on its genre in Japan, ushering in a new era of ultra-violent samurai films, known as &quot;cruel films&quot; (''zankoku eiga''). The movie and its [[Black comedy|black comic]] tone were also widely imitated abroad—[[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was a virtual (unauthorized) scene-by-scene remake—but most agree that Kurosawa's original was superior to the imitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=301–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=289–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=147–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of ''Yojimbo'', Kurosawa found himself under pressure from Toho to create a sequel. Kurosawa turned to a script he had written before ''Yojimbo'', reworking it to include the hero of his previous film. ''[[Sanjuro]]'' was the first of three Kurosawa films to be adapted from the work of the writer [[Shūgorō Yamamoto]] (the others would be ''Red Beard'' and ''Dodeskaden''). It is lighter in tone and closer to a conventional period film than ''Yojimbo'', though its story of a power struggle within a samurai clan is portrayed with strongly comic undertones. The film opened on January 1, 1962, quickly surpassing ''Yojimbo'''s box office success and garnering positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=324–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=293–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=156–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa had meanwhile instructed Toho to purchase the film rights to ''King's Ransom'', a novel about a kidnapping written by American author and screenwriter [[Evan Hunter]], under his pseudonym of Ed McBain, as one of his [[87th Precinct]] series of crime books. The director intended to create a work condemning kidnapping, which he considered one of the very worst crimes. The suspense film, titled ''[[High and Low (1963 film)|High and Low]]'', was shot during the latter half of 1962 and released in March 1963. It broke Kurosawa's box office record (the third film in a row to do so), became the highest grossing Japanese film of the year and won glowing reviews. However, his triumph was somewhat tarnished when, ironically, the film was blamed for a wave of kidnappings which occurred in Japan about this time (he himself received kidnapping threats directed at his young daughter, Kazuko). Though not very well-known today, ''High and Low'' is nevertheless considered by many commentators to be among the director's strongest works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=341–361}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=163–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=188–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa quickly moved on to his next project, ''[[Red Beard]]''. Based on a short story collection by Shūgorō Yamamoto and incorporating elements from Dostoevsky's novel ''[[Humiliated and Insulted|The Insulted and Injured]]'', it is a period film, set in a mid-19th century clinic for the poor, in which Kurosawa's humanist themes receive perhaps their fullest statement. A conceited and materialistic, foreign-trained young doctor, Yasumoto, is forced to become an intern at the clinic under the stern tutelage of Doctor Niide, known as &quot;Akahige&quot; (&quot;Red Beard&quot;), played by Mifune. Although he resists Red Beard initially, Yasumoto comes to admire his wisdom and courage, and to perceive the patients at the clinic, whom he at first despised, as worthy of compassion and dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=372–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yūzō Kayama]], who plays Yasumoto, was an extremely popular film and music star at the time, particularly for his &quot;Young Guy&quot; (''Wakadaishō'') series of musical comedies, so signing him to appear in the film virtually guaranteed Kurosawa strong box-office. The shoot, the filmmaker's longest ever, lasted well over a year (after five months of pre-production), and wrapped in spring 1965, leaving the director, his crew and his actors exhausted. ''Red Beard'' premiered in April 1965, becoming the year's highest-grossing Japanese production and the third (and last) Kurosawa film to top the prestigious Kinema Jumpo yearly critics poll. It remains one of Kurosawa's best-known and most-loved works in his native country. Outside Japan, critics have been much more divided. Most commentators concede its technical merits and some praise it as among Kurosawa's best, while others insist that it lacks complexity and genuine narrative power, with still others claiming that it represents a retreat from the artist's previous commitment to social and political change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=374–389}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=171–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|pp=332–333}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=235–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film marked something of an end of an era for its creator. The director himself recognized this at the time of its release, telling critic Donald Richie that a cycle of some kind had just come to an end and that his future films and production methods would be different.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; His prediction proved quite accurate. Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawa's costly production methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Red Beard'' also marked the midway point, chronologically, in the artist's career. During his previous twenty-nine years in the film industry (which includes his five years as assistant director), he had directed twenty-three films, while during the remaining twenty-eight years, for many and complex reasons, he would complete only seven more. Also, for reasons never adequately explained, ''Red Beard'' would be his final film starring Toshirō Mifune. Yu Fujiki, an actor who worked on ''The Lower Depths'', observed, regarding the closeness of the two men on the set, &quot;Mr. Kurosawa's heart was in Mr. Mifune's body.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Richie has described the rapport between them as a unique &quot;symbiosis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa (WNET)|loc=Donald Richie interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all critics agree that the strongest period of Kurosawa's career was the one between 1950 and 1965—bookended by ''Rashomon'' and ''Red Beard''—and that it is not a coincidence that this phase corresponds almost exactly to the time that he and Mifune worked together.

===Hollywood detour (1966–1968)===
When Kurosawa's exclusive contract with Toho came to an end in 1966, the 56-year-old director was seriously contemplating change. Observing the troubled state of the domestic film industry, and having already received dozens of offers from abroad, the idea of working outside Japan appealed to him as never before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=440–441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his first foreign project, Kurosawa chose a story based on a [[Life (magazine)|Life magazine]] article. The [[Embassy Pictures]] action thriller, to be filmed in English and called simply ''Runaway Train'', would have been his first in color. But the language barrier proved a major problem, and the English version of the screenplay was not even finished by the time filming was to begin in autumn 1966. The shoot, which required snow, was moved to autumn 1967, then canceled in 1968. Almost twenty years later, another foreigner working in Hollywood, [[Andrei Konchalovsky]], would finally make ''[[Runaway Train (film)|Runaway Train]]'', though from a script totally different from Kurosawa's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=440–448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The director meanwhile had become involved in a much more ambitious Hollywood project. ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'', produced by [[20th Century Fox]] and Kurosawa Production, would be a portrayal of the Japanese attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] from both the American and the Japanese points-of-view, with Kurosawa helming the Japanese half and an English-speaking filmmaker directing the American half. He spent several months working on the script with Ryuzo Kikushima and Hideo Oguni, but very soon the project began to unravel. The director chosen to film the American sequences turned out not to be the prestigious English filmmaker [[David Lean]], as the producers had led Kurosawa to believe, but the much less celebrated special effects expert, [[Richard Fleischer]]. The budget was also cut, and the screen time allocated for the Japanese segment would now be no longer than 90 minutes—a major problem, considering that Kurosawa's script ran over four hours. After numerous revisions, a more or less finalized cut screenplay was agreed upon in May 1968. Shooting began in early December, but Kurosawa would last only a little over three weeks as director. He struggled to work with an unfamiliar crew and the requirements of a Hollywood production, while his working methods puzzled his American producers, who ultimately concluded that the director must be mentally ill. On Christmas Eve 1968, the Americans announced that Kurosawa had left the production due to &quot;fatigue,&quot; effectively firing him. (He was ultimately replaced, for the film's Japanese sequences, with two directors, [[Kinji Fukasaku]] and [[Toshio Masuda]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=448–468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tora! Tora! Tora!'', finally released to unenthusiastic reviews in September 1970, was, as Donald Richie put it, an &quot;almost unmitigated tragedy&quot; in Kurosawa's career. He had spent years of his life on a logistically nightmarish project to which he ultimately did not contribute a foot of film shot by himself. (He had his name removed from the credits, though the script used for the Japanese half was still his and his co-writers'.) He became estranged from his longtime collaborator, writer Ryuzo Kikushima, and never worked with him again. The project had inadvertently exposed corruption in his own production company (a situation reminiscent of his own movie, ''The Bad Sleep Well''). His very sanity had been called into question. Worst of all, the Japanese film industry—and perhaps the man himself—began to suspect that he would never make another film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa: The Last Emperor|loc=Donald Richie interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=458–471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A difficult decade (1969–1977)===
Knowing that his reputation was at stake following the much publicised ''Tora! Tora! Tora!'' debacle, Kurosawa moved quickly to a new project to prove he was still viable. To his aid came friends and famed directors [[Keisuke Kinoshita]], [[Masaki Kobayashi]] and [[Kon Ichikawa]], who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights (Yonki no kai). Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, it has been suggested that the real motivation for the other three directors was to make it easier for Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his way back into the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=437–474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yojimbo|loc=DVD featurette: ''It Is Wonderful to Create'' – Crew Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first project proposed and worked on was a period film to be called ''Dora-Heita'', but when this was deemed too expensive, attention shifted to ''[[Dodesukaden]]'', an adaptation of yet another Shūgorō Yamamoto work, again about the poor and destitute. The film was shot quickly (by Kurosawa's standards) in about nine weeks, with Kurosawa determined to show he was still capable of working quickly and efficiently within a limited budget. For his first work in color, the dynamic editing and complex compositions of his earlier pictures were set aside, with the artist focusing on the creation of a bold, almost surreal palette of primary colors, in order to reveal the toxic environment in which the characters live. It was released in Japan in October 1970, but though a minor critical success, it was greeted with audience indifference. The picture lost money and caused the Club of the Four Knights to dissolve. Initial reception abroad was somewhat more favorable, but ''Dodesukaden'' has since been typically considered an interesting experiment not comparable to the director's best work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=474–486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to secure funding for further work and allegedly suffering from health problems, Kurosawa apparently reached the breaking point: on December 22, 1971, he slit his wrists and throat multiple times. The suicide attempt proved unsuccessful and the director's health recovered fairly quickly, with Kurosawa now taking refuge in domestic life, uncertain if he would ever direct another film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=487–489, 522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1973, the Soviet studio [[Mosfilm]] approached the filmmaker to ask if he would be interested in working with them. Kurosawa proposed an adaptation of Russian explorer [[Vladimir Arsenyev]]'s autobiographical work ''[[Dersu Uzala]]''. The book, about a [[Nani people|Goldi]] hunter who lives in harmony with nature until destroyed by encroaching civilization, was one that he had wanted to make since the 1930s. In December 1973, the 63-year-old Kurosawa set off for the Soviet Union with four of his closest aides, beginning a year-and-a-half stay in the country. Shooting began in May 1974 in Siberia, with filming in exceedingly harsh natural conditions proving very difficult and demanding. The picture wrapped in April 1975, with a thoroughly exhausted and homesick Kurosawa returning to Japan and his family in June. ''[[Dersu Uzala (1975 film)|Dersu Uzala]]'' had its world premiere in Japan on August 2, 1975, and did well at the box office. While critical reception in Japan was muted, the film was better reviewed abroad,   winning the [[Moscow International Film Festival]]'s Golden Prize, as well as an [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. Today, critics remain divided over the film: some see it as an example of Kurosawa's alleged artistic decline, while others count it among his finest works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nogami|pp=127–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=518–522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although proposals for television projects were submitted to him, he had no interest in working outside the film world. Nevertheless, the hard-drinking director did agree to appear in a series of television ads for [[Suntory]] whiskey, which aired in 1976. While fearing that he might never be able to make another film, the director nevertheless continued working on various projects, writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations, intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he would never be able to film his stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=513–514, 522–523, 544–546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two epics (1978–1986)===
In 1977, American director [[George Lucas]] had released ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', a wildly successful [[science fiction]] film influenced by Kurosawa's ''The Hidden Fortress'', among other works. Lucas, like many other [[New Hollywood]] directors, revered Kurosawa and considered him a role model, and was shocked to discover that the Japanese filmmaker was unable to secure financing for any new work. The two met in San Francisco in July 1978 to discuss the project Kurosawa considered most financially viable: ''[[Kagemusha]]'', the epic story of a thief hired as the double of a medieval Japanese lord of a great clan. Lucas, enthralled by the screenplay and Kurosawa's illustrations, leveraged his influence over 20th Century Fox to coerce the studio that had fired Kurosawa just ten years earlier to produce ''Kagemusha'', then recruited fellow fan [[Francis Ford Coppola]] as co-producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucas&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production began the following April, with Kurosawa in high spirits. Shooting lasted from June 1979 through March 1980 and was plagued with problems, not the least of which was the firing of the original lead actor, [[Shintaro Katsu]]—creator of the very popular [[Zatoichi]] character—due to an incident in which the actor insisted, against the director's wishes, on videotaping his own performance. (He was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai, in his first of two consecutive leading roles in a Kurosawa movie.) The film was completed only a few weeks behind schedule and opened in Tokyo in April 1980. It quickly became a massive hit in Japan. The film was also a critical and box office success abroad, winning the coveted [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]] in May, though some critics, then and now, have faulted the film for its alleged coldness. Kurosawa spent much of the rest of the year in Europe and America promoting ''Kagemusha'', collecting awards and accolades, and exhibiting as art the drawings he had made to serve as storyboards for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=547–558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=204–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international success of ''Kagemusha'' allowed Kurosawa to proceed with his next project, ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'', another epic in a similar vein. The script, partly based on [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'', depicted a ruthless, bloodthirsty [[daimyo]] (warlord), played by Tatsuya Nakadai, who, after foolishly banishing his one loyal son, surrenders his kingdom to his other two sons, who then betray him, thus plunging the entire kingdom into war. As Japanese studios still felt wary about producing another film that would rank among the most expensive ever made in the country, international help was again needed. This time it came from French producer [[Serge Silberman]], who had produced [[Luis Buñuel]]'s final movies. Filming did not begin until December 1983 and lasted more than a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=569–576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ran storyboards.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A painting by Akira Kurosawa of the &quot;third castle&quot; scene in ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]''. Kurosawa used such paintings as [[storyboard]]s to assist his crew in the construction and filming of the scenes.|alt=A storyboard image painted by Kurosawa for the movie, ''Ran'': it depicts what appears to be a gate, behind which is a long flight of steps, around which are depicted various large structures in the style of 16th Century Japan.]]
In January 1985, production of ''Ran'' was halted as Kurosawa's 64-year-old wife Yōko fell ill. She died on February 1. Kurosawa returned to finish his film and ''Ran'' premiered at the Tokyo Film Festival on May 31, with a wide release the next day. The film was a moderate financial success in Japan, but a larger one abroad and, as he had done with ''Kagemusha'', Kurosawa embarked on a trip to Europe and America, where he attended the film's premieres in September and October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=576–583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ran'' won several awards in Japan, but was not quite as honored there as many of the director's best films of the 1950s and 1960s had been. The film world was shocked, however, when Japan passed over the film in favor of another as its official entry to compete for an Oscar nomination in the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Film]] category. Both the producer and Kurosawa himself attributed this to a misunderstanding: because of the Academy's arcane rules, no one was sure whether ''Ran'' qualified as a ''Japanese'' film, a ''French'' film (due to its financing), or both, so it was not submitted at all. In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director [[Sidney Lumet]] led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] that year ([[Sydney Pollack]] ultimately won the award for directing [[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]). ''Ran'''s costume designer, [[Emi Wada]], won the movie's only Oscar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089881/awards |title=Ran (1985) – Awards |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=582–586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kagemusha'' and ''Ran'', particularly the latter, are often considered to be among Kurosawa's finest works. After ''Ran'''s release, Kurosawa would point to it as his best film, a major change of attitude for the director who, when asked which of his works was his best, had always previously answered &quot;my next one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=580–586}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie1999|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final works and last years (1987–1998)===
For his next movie, Kurosawa chose a subject very different from any that he had ever filmed before. While some of his previous pictures (for example, ''Drunken Angel'' and ''Kagemusha'') had included brief dream sequences, ''[[Dreams (1990 film)|Dreams]]'' was to be entirely based upon the director's own dreams. Significantly, for the first time in over forty years, Kurosawa, for this deeply personal project, wrote the screenplay alone. Although its estimated budget was lower than the films immediately preceding it, Japanese studios were still unwilling to back one of his productions, so Kurosawa turned to another famous American fan, [[Steven Spielberg]], who convinced [[Warner Bros.]] to buy the international rights to the completed film. This made it easier for Kurosawa's son, Hisao, as co-producer and soon-to-be head of Kurosawa Production, to negotiate a loan in Japan that would cover the film's production costs. Shooting took more than eight months to complete, and ''Dreams'' premiered at Cannes in May 1990 to a polite but muted reception, similar to the reaction the picture would generate elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spielberg&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=604–608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa now turned to a more conventional story with ''[[Rhapsody in August]]''—the director's first film fully produced in Japan since ''Dodeskaden'' over twenty years before—which explored the scars of the nuclear bombing which destroyed Nagasaki at the very end of World War II. It was adapted from a Kiyoko Murata novel, but the film's references to the Nagasaki bombing came from the director rather than from the book. This was his only movie to include a role for an American movie star: Richard Gere, who plays a small role as the nephew of the elderly heroine. Shooting took place in early 1991, with the film opening on May 25 that year to a largely negative critical reaction, especially in the United States, where the director was accused of promulgating naïvely anti-American sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=612–618}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gere&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/01/movies/kurosawa-still-finding-unfamiliar-seas-to-sail.html |author=Weisman, Steven R.|title=Kurosawa Still Finding Unfamiliar Seas to Sail |accessdate=2010-08-29 | work=The New York Times | date=1990-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MADADAYO.JPG‎|thumb|upright|The Japanese theatrical poster, designed by Kurosawa himself, for the film that turned out to be his last: ''[[Madadayo]]'' (''Not Yet'') (1993)|alt=A poster for Kurosawa's last film, ''Madadayo'', hand-drawn by Kurosawa himself: the image shows the figure of an elderly man in a business suit, apparently dancing on a table, with a fan in each hand, surrounded by similarly attired men observing his dance; below this image are childish Japanese characters spelling out the title of the film.]]
Kurosawa wasted no time moving onto his next project: ''[[Madadayo]]'', or ''Not Yet''. Based on autobiographical essays by [[Hyakken Uchida]], the film follows the life of a Japanese professor of German through the Second World War and beyond. The narrative centers on yearly birthday celebrations with his former students, during which the protagonist declares his unwillingness to die just yet—a theme that was becoming increasingly relevant for the film's 81-year-old creator. Filming began in February 1992 and wrapped by the end of September. Its release on April 17, 1993, was greeted by an even more disappointed reaction than had been the case with his two preceding works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=622–627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa nevertheless continued to work. He wrote the original screenplays ''The Sea is Watching'' in 1993 and ''After the Rain'' in 1995. While putting finishing touches on the latter work in 1995, Kurosawa slipped and broke the base of his spine. Following the accident, he would be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, putting an end to any hopes of him directing another film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=636–639}}&lt;/ref&gt; His longtime wish—to die on the set while shooting a movie&lt;ref name=&quot;Gere&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;—was never to be fulfilled.

===Death and posthumous works===
Following his accident in 1995, Kurosawa's health began to deteriorate. While his mind remained sharp and lively, his body was giving up, and for the last half year of his life, the director was largely confined to bed, listening to music and watching television at home. On September 6, 1998, Kurosawa died of a [[stroke]] in [[Setagaya, Tokyo]], at the age of 88.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=639–640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Kurosawa's death, several posthumous works based on his unfilmed screenplays have been produced. ''[[After the Rain (film)|After the Rain]]'', directed by [[Takashi Koizumi]], was released in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=641–645}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181960 |title=After the Rain (1999) |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Sea is Watching'', directed by [[Kei Kumai]], premiered in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316829 |title=The Sea Is Watching (2002) |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A script created by the Yonki no Kai (&quot;Club of the Four Knights&quot;) (Kurosawa, Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi, and Kon Ichikawa), around the time that ''Dodeskaden'' was made, finally was filmed and released (in 2000) as ''Dora-Heita'', by the only surviving founding member of the club, Kon Ichikawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ff20000523a1.html |title=The samurai flick that got away |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; To coincide with the 100th anniversary of Kurosawa's birth, an unfinished documentary about the Noh theater that the filmmaker had started in the 1980s, ''[[Gendai no Noh|Gendai no No]]'', is scheduled to be completed and released in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1198401 |title=Gendai no No |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working methods, style and themes==
===Working methods===
All biographical sources, as well as the filmmaker’s own comments, confirm that Kurosawa was a completely “hands-on” director, passionately involved in every aspect of the filmmaking process. As one interviewer summarized, “he (co-)writes his scripts, oversees the design, rehearses the actors, sets up all the shots and then does the editing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|2008|loc=p. 131, reprinted from John Powers interview, [[L.A. Weekly]], 4/4/86, pp. 45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; His active participation extended from the initial concept to the editing and scoring of the final product.

====Script====
Kurosawa emphasized time and again that the screenplay was the absolute foundation of a successful film and that, though a mediocre director can sometimes make a passable film out of a ''good'' script, even an excellent director can never make a good film out of a ''bad'' script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the postwar period, he began the practice of collaborating with a rotating group of five screenwriters: Eijirō Hisaita, Ryuzo Kikushima, [[Shinobu Hashimoto]], Hideo Oguni, and Masato Ide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whichever members of this group happened to be working on a particular film would gather around a table, often at a hot-springs resort, where they would not be distracted by the outside world. (''Seven Samurai'', for example, was written in this fashion.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Seven Samurai|loc=DVD featurette: ''It Is Wonderful to Create''&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Seven Samurai|loc=DVD featurette: ''It Is Wonderful to Create''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often they all (except Oguni, who acted as “referee”) would work on exactly the same pages of the script, and Kurosawa would choose the best-written version from the different drafts of each particular scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa (WNET)|loc=bonus materials: Shinobu Hashimoto interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was adopted &quot;so that each contributor might function as a kind of foil, checking the dominance of any one person’s point-of-view.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the actual script, Kurosawa at this stage often produced extensive, fantastically detailed notes to elaborate his vision. For example, for ''Seven Samurai'', he created six notebooks in which he created (among many other things) detailed biographies of the samurai, including what they wore and ate, how they walked, talked and behaved when greeted, and even how each tied his shoes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Seven Samurai|loc=DVD featurette: ''It Is Wonderful to Create''&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 101 peasant characters in the film, he created a registry consisting of 23 families and instructed the performers playing these roles to live and work as these “families” for the duration of shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shooting====
For his early films, although they were consistently well photographed, Kurosawa generally used standard lenses and deep-focus photography. Beginning with ''Seven Samurai'' (1954), however, Kurosawa's cinematic technique changed drastically, through his extensive use in that film of [[Long focus lens|long lens]] and multiple cameras. The director claimed that he used these lenses and several cameras rolling at once to help the actors—allowing them to be photographed at some distance from the lens, and without any knowledge of which particular camera's image would be utilized in the final cut—making their performances much more natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In fact, Tatsuya Nakadai agreed that the multiple cameras greatly helped his performances with the director.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa (WNET)|loc=bonus materials: Tatsuya Nakadai interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; But these changes had a powerful effect as well on the look of the action scenes in that film, particularly the final battle in the rain. Says Stephen Prince: &quot;He can use the telephoto lenses to get under the horses, in between their hooves, to plunge us into the chaos of that battle in a visual way that is really quite unprecedented, both in Kurosawa’s own work and in the samurai genre as a whole.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Seven Samurai|loc=DVD featurette: ''Seven Samurai: Origins and Influences'', Stephen Prince commentary&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Seven Samurai|loc=DVD bonus featurette: ''Seven Samurai: Origins and Influences'', Stephen Prince commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''The Hidden Fortress'', Kurosawa began to utilize the [[widescreen]] ([[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]]) process for the first time in his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three techniques—long lenses, multiple cameras and widescreen—were in later works fully exploited, even in sequences with little or no overt action, such as the early scenes of ''High and Low'' that take place in the central character's home, in which they are employed to dramatize tensions and power relationships between the characters within a highly confined space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=190–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For all his films, but particularly for his ''[[jidaigeki]]'', Kurosawa insisted on absolute authenticity of sets, costumes and props. Numerous instances of his fanatical devotion to detail have been recorded, of which the following are only a few examples.

For ''Throne of Blood'', in the scene where Washizu (Mifune) is attacked with arrows by his own men, the director had archers shoot real arrows, hollowed out and running along wires, toward Toshirō Mifune from a distance of about ten feet, with the actor carefully following chalk marks on the ground to avoid being hit. (Some of the arrows missed him by an inch; the actor, who admitted that he was not merely ''acting'' terrified in the film, suffered nightmares afterward).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=233–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Red Beard'', to construct the gate for the clinic set, Kurosawa had his assistants dismantle rotten wood from old sets and then create the prop from scratch with this old wood, so the gate would look properly ravaged by time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa (WNET)|loc=bonus materials: Yoshirō Muraki interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same film, for teacups that appeared in the movie, he ordered his crew to pour fifty years’ worth of tea into the cups so they would appear appropriately stained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Ran'', art director [[Yoshirō Muraki]], constructing the &quot;third castle&quot; set under the director’s supervision, created the &quot;stones&quot; of that castle by having photographs taken of actual stones from a celebrated castle, then painting [[Styrofoam]] blocks to exactly resemble those stones and gluing them to the castle “wall” through a process known as “rough-stone piling,” which required months of work. Later, before shooting the famous scene in which the castle is attacked and set on fire, in order to prevent the Styrofoam “stones” from melting in the heat, the art department coated the surface with four layers of cement, then painted the colors of the ancient stones onto the cement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nogami|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Editing====
Kurosawa often remarked that he shot a film simply in order to have material to edit, because the editing of a picture was the most important and creatively interesting part of the process for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=229, 238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa’s creative team believed that the director’s skill with editing was his greatest talent. Said Hiroshi Nezu, a longtime production supervisor on his films, “Among ourselves, we think that he is Toho’s best director, that he is Japan’s best scenarist, and that he is the best editor in the world. He is most concerned with the flowing quality which a film must have... The Kurosawa film flows ''over'' the cut, as it were.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|pp=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The director’s frequent crew member Teruyo Nogami confirms this view. “Akira Kurosawa’s editing was exceptional, the inimitable work of a genius... No one was a match for him.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nogami|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed that Kurosawa carried in his head all the information about all shots filmed, and if, in the editing room, he asked for a piece of film and she handed him the wrong one, he would immediately recognize the error, though she had taken detailed notes on each shot and he had not. She compared his mind to a computer, which could do with edited segments of film what computers do today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa (WNET)|loc=bonus materials: Teruyo Nogami interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa’s habitual method—at variance with the standard Hollywood practice of editing a film only after all footage has been shot{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}—was to edit a film daily, bit by bit, during production. This helped particularly when he started using multiple cameras, which resulted in a large amount of film to assemble. “I always edit in the evening if we have a fair amount of footage in the can. After watching the rushes, I usually go to the editing room and work.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|2008|loc=p. 53, reprinted from Yoshi Shirai interview, Cinema, Spring 1972, pp. 14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this practice of editing as he went along, the post-production period for a Kurosawa film could be startlingly brief: ''Yojimbo'' had its Japanese premiere on April 20, 1961, ''four days'' after shooting concluded on April 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=308–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The &quot;Kurosawa-gumi&quot;====
Throughout his career, Kurosawa worked constantly with people drawn from the same pool of creative technicians, crew members and actors, popularly known as the &quot;Kurosawa-gumi&quot; (Kurosawa group). The following is a partial list of this group, divided by profession. This information is derived from the [[IMDB]] pages for Kurosawa’s films&lt;ref name=&quot;Akira Kurosawa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000041|title=Akira Kurosawa |accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stuart Galbraith’s IV’s filmography:&lt;ref name=&quot;filmog&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=651–751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Composers''': [[Fumio Hayasaka]] (''Drunken Angel'', ''Stray Dog'', ''Scandal'', ''Rashomon'', ''The Idiot'', ''Ikiru'', ''Seven Samurai'', ''Record of a Living Being''); [[Masaru Satō]] (''Throne of Blood'', ''The Lower Depths'', ''The Hidden Fortress'', ''The Bad Sleep Well'', ''Yojimbo'', ''Sanjuro'', ''High and Low'', ''Red Beard''); [[Tōru Takemitsu]] (''Dodeskaden'', ''Ran''); [[Shin-ichirō Ikebe]] (''Kagemusha'', ''Dreams'', ''Rhapsody in August'', ''Madadayo'').

===Style===
Virtually all commentators have noted Kurosawa’s bold, dynamic style, which many have compared to the traditional Hollywood style of narrative moviemaking, one that emphasizes, in the words of one such scholar, &quot;chronological, causal, linear and historical thinking.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desser|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it has also been claimed that, from his very first film, the director displayed a technique quite distinct from the seamless style of classic Hollywood. This technique involved a disruptive depiction of screen space through the use of numerous unrepeated camera setups, a disregard for the traditional 180-degree axis of action around which Hollywood scenes have usually been constructed, and an approach in which “narrative time becomes spatialized,” with fluid camera movement often replacing conventional editing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are some idiosyncratic aspects of the artist’s style.

====The axial cut====
In his films of the 1940s and 1950s, Kurosawa frequently employs the [[Axial cut|&quot;axial cut,&quot;]] in which the camera moves closer to, or further away from, the subject, not through the use of [[tracking shot]]s or [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolves]], but through a series of matched [[jump cut]]s. For example, in ''Sanshiro Sugata II'', the hero takes leave of the woman he loves, but then, after walking away a short distance, turns and bows to her, and then, after walking further, turns and bows once more. This sequence of shots is illustrated on film scholar [[David Bordwell]]'s blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/?p=6308 |title=Observations on Film Art: Kurosawa's Early Spring |accessdate=2010-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three shots are not connected in the film by camera movements or dissolves, but by a series of two jump cuts. The effect is to stress the duration of Sanshiro's departure.

In the opening sequence of ''Seven Samurai'' in the peasant village, the axial cut is used twice. When the villagers are outdoors, gathered in a circle, weeping and lamenting the imminent arrival of the bandits, they are glimpsed from above in extreme long shot, then, after the cut, in a much closer shot, then in an even closer shot at ground level as the dialogue begins. A few minutes later, when the villagers go to the mill to ask the village elder's advice, there is a long shot of the mill, with a slowly turning wheel in the river, then a closer shot of this wheel, and then a still closer shot of it. (As the mill is where the elder lives, these shots forge a mental association in the viewer's mind between that character and the mill.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seven Samurai|loc=Stephen Prince commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cutting on motion====
A number of scholars have pointed out Kurosawa’s tendency to “cut on motion”: that is, to edit a sequence of a character or characters in motion so that an action is depicted in two or more separate shots, rather than one uninterrupted shot. One scholar, as an example, describes a tense scene in ''Seven Samurai'' in which the samurai Shichirôji, who is standing, wishes to console the peasant Manzo, who is sitting on the ground, and he gets down on one knee to talk to him. Kurosawa chooses to film this simple action in two shots rather than one (cutting between the two only ''after'' the action of kneeling has begun) to fully convey Shichirôji’s humility. Numerous other instances of this device are evident in the movie. “Kurosawa [frequently] breaks up the action, fragments it, in order to create an emotional effect.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Mellentalk&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Seven Samurai|loc=DVD bonus featurette: ''Seven Samurai: Origins and Influences'', Joan Mellen commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The wipe====
A form of cinematic punctuation very strongly identified with Kurosawa is the [[Wipe (transition)|wipe]]. This is an effect created through an [[optical printer]], in which, when a scene ends, a line or bar appears to move across the screen, “wiping” away the image while simultaneously revealing the first image of the subsequent scene. As a transitional device, it is used as a substitute for the straight cut or the [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolve]] (though Kurosawa, of course, often used both of those devices as well). In his mature work, Kurosawa employed the wipe so frequently that it became a kind of signature. For example, one blogger has counted no less than 12 instances of the wipe in ''Drunken Angel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lewissaul.blogspot.com/2008/02/85-akira-kurosawa-yoidore-tenshi.html |title=Akira Kurosawa YOIDORE TENSHI |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of theories concerning the purpose of this device, which, as James Goodwin notes, was common in silent cinema but became considerably rarer in the more “realistic” sound cinema.&lt;ref name=&quot;wipe&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodwin1993|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodwin claims that the wipes in ''Rashomon'', for instance, fulfill one of three purposes: emphasizing motion in traveling shots, marking narrative shifts in the courtyard scenes and marking temporal ellipses between actions (e.g., between the end of one character’s testimony and the beginning of another’s).&lt;ref name=&quot;wipe&quot;/&gt; He also points out that in ''The Lower Depths'', in which Kurosawa completely avoided the use of wipes, the director cleverly manipulated people and props “in order to slide new visual images in and out of view much as a wipe cut does.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodwin1993|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An instance of the wipe used as a satirical device can be seen in ''Ikiru''. A group of women visit the local government office to petition the bureaucrats to turn a waste area into a children’s playground. The viewer is then shown a series of [[Point of view shot|point of view]] shots of various bureaucrats, connected by wipe transitions, each of whom refers the group to another department.  Nora Tennessen comments in her blog (which shows one example) that “the wipe technique makes [the sequence] funnier—images of bureaucrats are stacked like cards, each more punctilious than the last.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trixmcgovern.blogspot.com/2010/01/wipe-out-kurosawas-tricky-cuts.html |title=Trix McGovern, Girl Reporter: WIPE-OUT: Kurosawa's Tricky Cuts |author=Tennessen, Nora |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Image-sound counterpoint====
Kurosawa by all accounts always gave great attention to the soundtracks of his films (Teruyo Nogami’s memoir gives many such examples).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nogami|pp=183–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1940s, he began to employ music for what he called &quot;counterpoint&quot; to the emotional content of a scene, rather than merely to reinforce the emotion, as Hollywood traditionally did (and still does). The inspiration for this innovation came from a family tragedy. When news reached Kurosawa of his father's death in 1948, he wandered aimlessly through the streets of Tokyo. His sorrow was magnified rather than diminished when he suddenly heard the cheerful, vapid song &quot;The Cuckoo Waltz&quot;, and he hurried to escape from this &quot;awful music.&quot; He then told his composer, [[Fumio Hayasaka]], with whom he was working on ''Drunken Angel'', to use &quot;The Cuckoo Waltz&quot; as ironic accompaniment to the scene in which the dying gangster, Matsunaga, sinks to his lowest point in the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|pp=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ironic approach to music can also be found in ''Stray Dog'', a film released a year after ''Drunken Angel''. In the climactic scene, the detective Murakami is fighting furiously with the murderer Yusa in a muddy field. The sound of a Mozart piece is suddenly heard, played on the piano by a woman in a nearby house. As one commentator notes, &quot;In contrast to this scene of primitive violence, the serenity of the Mozart is, literally, other-worldly&quot; and &quot;the power of this elemental encounter is heightened by the music.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor was Kurosawa’s &quot;ironic&quot; use of the soundtrack limited to music. One critic observes that, in ''Seven Samurai'', &quot;During episodes of murder and mayhem, birds chirp in the background, as they do in the first scene when the farmers lament their seemingly hopeless fate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|pp=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recurring themes===
====The master–disciple relationship====
Many commentators have noted the frequent occurrence in Kurosawa’s work of the complex relationship between an older and a younger man, who serve each other as master and disciple, respectively. This theme was clearly an expression of the director's life experience. &quot;Kurosawa revered his teachers, in particular Kajiro Yamamoto, his mentor at Toho,&quot; according to Joan Mellen. &quot;The salutary image of an older person instructing the young evokes always in Kurosawa’s films high moments of pathos.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|pp=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic Tadao Sato considers the recurring character of the &quot;master&quot; to be a type of surrogate father, whose role it is to witness the young protagonist’s moral growth and approve of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sato|pp=126–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his very first film, ''Sanshiro Sugata'', after the [[Judo]] master Yano becomes the title character’s teacher and spiritual guide, &quot;the narrative [is] cast in the form of a chronicle studying the stages of the hero’s growing mastery and maturity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The master-pupil relationship in the films of the postwar era—as depicted in such works as ''Drunken Angel'', ''Stray Dog'', ''Seven Samurai'', ''Red Beard'' and ''Dersu Uzala''—involves very little direct instruction, but much learning through experience and example; Stephen Prince relates this tendency to the private and nonverbal nature of the concept of [[Zen]] enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of ''Kagemusha'', however, according to Prince, the meaning of this relationship has changed. A thief chosen to act as the double of a great lord continues his impersonation even after his master’s death: &quot;the relationship has become spectral and is generated from beyond the grave with the master maintaining a ghostly presence. Its end is death, not the renewal of commitment to the living that typified its outcome in earlier films.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the director's biographer, in his final film, ''Madadayo''—which deals with a teacher and his relationship with an entire group of ex-pupils—a sunnier vision of the theme emerges. &quot;The students hold an annual party for their professor, attended by dozens of former students, now adults of varying age... This extended sequence... expresses, as only Kurosawa can, the simple joys of student-teacher relationships, of kinship, of being alive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The heroic champion====
Kurosawa’s is a ''heroic'' cinema, a series of dramas (mostly) concerned with the deeds and fates of larger-than-life heroes. Stephen Prince has identified the emergence of the unique Kurosawa protagonist with the immediate post-World War II period. The goal of the [[Occupation of Japan|American Occupation]] to replace Japanese [[feudalism]] with [[individualism]] coincided with the director’s artistic and social agenda: &quot;Kurosawa welcomed the changed political climate and sought to fashion his own mature cinematic voice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese critic Tadao Sato concurs: &quot;With defeat in World War II, many Japanese... were dumbfounded to find that the government had lied to them and was neither just nor dependable. During this uncertain time Akira Kurosawa, in a series of first-rate films, sustained the people by his consistent assertion that the meaning of life is not dictated by the nation but something each individual should discover for himself through suffering.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sato|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filmmaker himself remarked that, during this period, &quot;I felt that without the establishment of the self as a positive value there could be no freedom and no democracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1983|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first such postwar hero was, atypically for the artist, a heroine—Yukie, played by Setsuko Hara, in ''No Regrets for Our Youth''. According to Prince, her &quot;desertion of family and class background to assist a poor village, her perseverance in the face of enormous obstacles, her assumption of responsibility for her own life and for the well-being of others, and her [[Existentialism|existential]] loneliness... are essential to Kurosawan heroism and make of Yukie the first coherent... example.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;existential loneliness&quot; is also exemplified by Dr. Sanada (Takashi Shimura) in ''Drunken Angel'': &quot;Kurosawa insists that his heroes take their stand, alone, against tradition and battle for a better world, even if the path there is not clear. Separation from a corrupt social system in order to alleviate human suffering, as Sanada does, is the only honorable course.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commentators regard ''Seven Samurai'' as the ultimate expression of the artist’s heroic ideal. Joan Mellen’s comments are typical of this view: &quot;Seven Samurai is above all a homage to the samurai class at its most noble... Samurai for Kurosawa represent the best of Japanese tradition and integrity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, it is because of, not in spite of, the chaotic times of civil war depicted in the film that the seven rise to greatness. &quot;Kurosawa locates the unexpected benefits no less than the tragedy of this historical moment. The upheaval forces samurai to channel the selflessness of their credo of loyal service into working for peasants.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this heroism is futile because &quot;there was already rising... a merchant class which would supplant the warrior aristocracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; So the courage and supreme skill of the central characters will not prevent the ultimate destruction of themselves or their class.

As Kurosawa’s career progressed he seemed to find it increasingly difficult to sustain the heroic ideal. As Prince notes, &quot;Kurosawa’s is an essentially tragic vision of life, and this sensibility... impedes his efforts to realize a socially committed mode of filmmaking.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the director’s ideal of heroism is subverted by history itself: &quot;When history is articulated as it is in ''Throne of Blood'', as a blind force... heroism ceases to be a problem or a reality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Prince, the filmmaker’s vision eventually became so bleak that he would come to view history merely as eternally recurring patterns of violence, within which the individual is depicted as not only unheroic, but utterly helpless (see &quot;[[#Cycles of violence|Cycles of violence]]&quot; below).

====Nature and weather====
Nature is a crucial element in Kurosawa’s films. According to Stephen Prince, &quot;Kurosawa’s sensibility, like that of many Japanese artists, is keenly sensitive to the subtleties and beauties of season and scenery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has never hesitated to exploit climate and weather as plot elements, to the point where they become &quot;active participants in the drama... The oppressive heat in ''Stray Dog'' and ''Record of a Living Being'' is omnipresent and becomes thematized as a signifier of a world disjointed by economic collapse and the atomic threat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director himself once said, &quot;I like hot summers, cold winters, heavy rains and snows, and I think most of my pictures show this. I like extremes because I find them most alive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind is also a powerful symbol: &quot;The persistent metaphor of Kurosawa’s work is that of wind, the winds of change, of fortune and adversity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The visually flamboyant [final] battle [of ''Yojimbo''] takes place in the main street, as huge clouds of dust swirl around the combatants... The winds that stir the dust... have brought firearms to the town along with the culture of the West, which will end the warrior tradition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is also difficult not to notice the importance of rain to Kurosawa: &quot;Rain in Kurosawa’s films is never treated neutrally. When it occurs... it is never a drizzle or a light mist but always a frenzied downpour, a driving storm.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|pp=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The final battle [in ''Seven Samurai''] is a supreme spiritual and physical struggle, and it is fought in a blinding rainstorm, which enables Kurosawa to visualize an ultimate fusion of social groups... but this climactic vision of classlessness, with typical Kurosawan ambivalence, has become a vision of horror. The battle is a vortex of swirling rain and mud... The ultimate fusion of social identity emerges as an expression of hellish chaos.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cycles of violence====
Beginning with ''Throne of Blood'' (1957), an obsession with historical cycles of inexorable savage violence—what Stephen Prince calls &quot;the countertradition to the committed, heroic mode of Kurosawa’s cinema&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;—first appears. According to Donald Richie, within the world of that film, &quot;Cause and effect is the only law. Freedom does not exist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richie|1999|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Prince claims that its events &quot;are inscribed in a cycle of time that infinitely repeats.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;circle&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; (He uses as evidence the fact that Washizu’s lord, unlike the kindly King Duncan of Shakespeare’s play, had murdered his own lord years before to seize power, and is then murdered in turn by Washizu (the Macbeth character) for the same reason.)&lt;ref name=&quot;circle&quot;/&gt; &quot;The fated quality to the action of [[Macbeth]]... was transposed by Kurosawa with a sharpened emphasis upon predetermined action and the crushing of human freedom beneath the laws of [[karma]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;circle&quot;/&gt;

Prince claims that Kurosawa’s last epics, ''Kagemusha'' and particularly ''Ran'', mark a major turning point in the director’s vision of the world. In ''Kagemusha'', &quot;where once [in the world of his films] the individual [hero] could grasp events tightly and demand that they conform to his or her impulses, now the self is but the epiphenomenon of a ruthless and bloody temporal process, ground to dust beneath the weight and force of history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following epic, ''Ran'', is “a relentless chronicle of base lust for power, betrayal of the father by his sons, and pervasive wars and murders.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ran&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical setting of the film is used as &quot;a commentary on what Kurosawa now perceives as the timelessness of human impulses toward violence and self-destruction.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ran&quot;/&gt; &quot;History has given way to a perception of life as a wheel of endless suffering, ever turning, ever repeating,&quot; which is compared in many instances in the screenplay with hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Kurosawa has found hell to be both the inevitable outcome of human behavior and the appropriate visualization of his own bitterness and disappointment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{main|Akira Kurosawa: Summary of criticisms}}
Despite the extraordinary acclaim that Kurosawa’s work has received in Japan and abroad, his films, as well as Kurosawa as an individual, have also been subject to considerable criticism, much of it harsh. Below are summarized some of the more common criticisms of the director, both those made generally and those that are primarily voiced in Japan.

===In general===
In the early to mid-1950s, a number of critics belonging to the French New Wave championed the films of the older Japanese master, Kenji Mizoguchi, at the expense of Kurosawa’s work. New Wave critic-filmmaker [[Jacques Rivette]], said: &quot;You can compare only what is comparable and that which aims high enough... [Mizoguchi] seems to be the only Japanese director who is completely Japanese and yet is also the only one that achieves a true universality, that of an individual.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/beauty_beneath_the_brutality_japanese_masters_mizoguchi_and_ozu_3225 |title=Beauty Beneath the Brutality: Japanese Masters Mizoguchi and Ozu |publisher=moviemaker.com |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to such French commentators, Mizoguchi seemed, of the two artists, the more authentically Japanese. But at least one film scholar has questioned the validity of this dichotomy between “Japanese” Mizoguchi and “Western” Kurosawa by pointing out that &quot;Mizo&quot; had been as influenced by Western cinema and Western culture in general as Kurosawa, and that this is reflected in his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism frequently directed at Kurosawa’s films is that the director’s preoccupation with ethical and moral themes led him at times to create what some commentators regard as [[Sentimentality|sentimental]] or naïve work. Speaking of the postwar “[[slice of life]]” drama ''One Wonderful Sunday'', for example, film scholar (and future politician) [[Audie Bock]] claimed that not even Kurosawa’s celebrated prowess as an editor could save one particular scene from bathos: “The last sequence... is an excruciating twelve minutes of the boy conducting an imaginary orchestra in an empty amphitheater while his girlfriend appeals directly to the camera for the viewer to join in. Angles and focal lengths change, details of leaves scattering in the wind are intercut, but nothing makes the scene go any faster.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some controversy exists about the extent to which Kurosawa's films of the Second World War period could be considered fascist [[propaganda]]. The cultural historian Peter B. High sees Kurosawa’s wartime cinema as part of the propagandistic trend of Japan at war and as an example of many of these wartime conventions. High refers to his second film, ''The Most Beautiful'', as a &quot;dark and gloomy rendition of the standard formulas of the [home front] genre.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|High|p=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another controversy centers on his alleged refusal to acknowledge Japan's wartime guilt. In one of Kurosawa’s last films, ''Rhapsody in August'', an elderly survivor of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic attack on Nagasaki]] is visited by her half-Japanese, half-American nephew, Clark ([[Richard Gere]]), who appears (at least to some viewers) to apologize, as an American, for the city’s wartime destruction. The ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Vincent Canby]] wrote about this film: &quot;A lot of people at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] were outraged that the film makes no mention of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] and Japan's atrocities in China... If Clark can apologize for bombing [[Nagasaki]], why can't Granny apologize for the raid on Pearl Harbor?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/20/movies/review-film-kurosawa-small-in-scale-and-blunt.html |title=Review/Film; Kurosawa, Small in Scale and Blunt |author=Canby, Vincent |publisher=nytimes.com |date=1991-12-20 |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of critics have reacted negatively to the female characters in Kurosawa’s movies. Joan Mellen, in her examination of this subject, has maintained that, by the time of ''Red Beard'' (1965), &quot;women in Kurosawa have become not only unreal and incapable of kindness, but totally bereft of autonomy, whether physical, intellectual, or emotional... Women at their best may only imitate the truths men discover.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|1976|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa scholar Stephen Prince concurs with Mellen's view, though less censoriously: &quot;Unlike a male-oriented director like [[Sam Peckinpah]], Kurosawa is not hostile to women, but his general lack of interest in them should be regarded as a major limitation of his work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Japan===
In Japan, both critics and other filmmakers have sometimes accused his work of elitism, because of his focus on exceptional, heroic individuals and groups of men. In her commentary on the deluxe DVD edition of ''Seven Samurai'', Joan Mellen maintains that certain shots of the samurai characters Kambei and Kyuzo, which to her reveal Kurosawa &quot;privileging&quot; these samurai, &quot;support the argument voiced by several Japanese critics that Kurosawa was an elitist... Kurosawa was hardly a progressive director, they argued, since his peasants could not discover among their own ranks leaders who might rescue the village. Instead, justifying the inequitable class structure of their society and ours, the peasants must rely on the aristocracy, the upper class, and in particular samurai, to ensure their survival... Kurosawa defended himself against this charge in his interview with me. 'I wanted to say that after everything the peasants were the stronger, closely clinging to the earth... It was the samurai who were weak because they were being blown by the winds of time.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mellentalk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|pp=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Kurosawa’s popularity with European and American audiences from the early 1950s onward, he has not escaped the charge of deliberately catering to the tastes of Westerners to achieve or maintain that popularity. Joan Mellen, recording the violently negative reaction (in the 1970s) of the [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] director [[Nagisa Oshima]] to Kurosawa and his work, states: &quot;That Kurosawa had brought Japanese film to a Western audience meant [to Oshima] that he must be [[pandering (politics)|pandering]] to Western values and politics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellen|2002|pp=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa always strongly denied pandering to Western tastes: “He has never catered to a foreign audience” writes Audie Bock, “and has condemned those who do.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bock|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa was often criticized by his countrymen for perceived &quot;arrogant&quot; behavior. It was in Japan that the (initially) disparaging nickname &quot;Kurosawa Tennō&quot;—&quot;The Emperor Kurosawa&quot;—was coined. &quot;Like [[Emperor of Japan|tennō]],&quot; Yoshimoto claimed, &quot;Kurosawa is said to cloister himself in his own small world, which is completely cut off from the everyday reality of the majority of Japanese. The nickname tennō is used in this sense to create an image of Kurosawa as a director who abuses his power solely for the purpose of self-indulgence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimoto|p=379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwide impact==
===Reputation among filmmakers===
Many celebrated directors have been influenced by Kurosawa and/or have expressed admiration for his work. The filmmakers cited below are grouped according to three categories: a) those who, like Kurosawa himself, established international critical reputations in the 1950s and early 1960s; b) the so-called &quot;[[New Hollywood]]&quot; directors, that is, American moviemakers who, for the most part, established their reputations in the early to mid-1970s; and c) other Asian directors.  

[[File:Robert Altman Cannes.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Robert Altman]] was so impressed that Kurosawa had his cinematographer on ''Rashomon'' shoot directly into the sun that he immediately began to incorporate such shots in his own television work.|alt=Photo of the director Robert Altman in his mid-60s, wearing a goatee, glasses, a wide-brimmed white hat and a jacket and looking directly into the camera.]]
[[Ingmar Bergman]] called his own film ''[[The Virgin Spring]]'' &quot;touristic, a lousy imitation of Kurosawa,&quot; and added, &quot;At that time my admiration for the Japanese cinema was at its height. I was almost a samurai myself!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ingmar Bergman Foundation |url=http://www.ingmarbergman.se/universe.asp?guid=2E2291EF-1288-4A78-9510-B00F0F1D4CDB |title=Ingmar Bergman on Akira Kurosawa |publisher=Ingmarbergman.se |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federico Fellini]] in an interview declared the director &quot;the greatest living example of all that an author of the cinema should be&quot;—despite admitting to having seen only one of his films, ''Seven Samurai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fellini|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Polanski]] in 1965 cited Kurosawa as one of his three favorite filmmakers (with Fellini and [[Orson Welles]]), singling out ''Seven Samurai'', ''Throne of Blood'' and ''The Hidden Fortress'' for praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morrison|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] considered the Japanese master's influence to be seminal: &quot;Kurosawa's movies and ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' of Fellini are the things that pushed me, sucked me into being a film director.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa: The Last Emperor|loc=Bernardo Bertolucci interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa's &quot;New Hollywood&quot; admirers have included [[Robert Altman]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Steven Spielberg]],&lt;ref name=&quot;news.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8ncVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=t-sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5882%2C1850102 |title=Filmmaker remembered as 'pictorial Shakespeare' |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard (via Google News Archive) |agency=The Associated Press |date=1998-09-07 |accessdate=2010-01-01}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Scorsese]],&lt;ref name=&quot;news.google.com&quot;/&gt; [[George Lucas]],&lt;ref name=anaheim&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anaheim.edu/content/view/758/720/ |title=Akira Kurosowa Memorial Tribute |publisher=Anaheim.edu |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Milius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Plume, Ken |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/401/401150p7.html |title=An Interview with John Milius – Movies Feature at IGN |publisher=Movies.ign.com |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Altman, when he first saw ''Rashomon'' (during the period when he worked regularly in television rather than feature films), was so impressed by its cinematographer's achievement of shooting several shots with the camera aimed directly at the sun—allegedly it was the first film in which this was done successfully—that he claims he was inspired the very next day to begin incorporating shots of the sun into his television work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashomon|loc=Robert Altman Introductory Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Coppola who said of Kurosawa, &quot;One thing that distinguishes [him] is that he didn't make one masterpiece or two masterpieces. He made, you know, ''eight'' masterpieces.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa: The Last Emperor|loc=Francis Ford Coppola interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Spielberg and Scorsese have praised the older man's role as teacher and role model—as a ''[[sensei]]'', to use the Japanese term. Spielberg has declared, &quot;I have learned more from him than from almost any other filmmaker on the face of the earth&quot;,&lt;ref name=anaheim/&gt; while Scorsese remarked, &quot;Let me say it simply: Akira Kurosawa was my master, and... the master of so many other filmmakers over the years.&quot;&lt;ref name=anaheim/&gt; As already noted above, several of these moviemakers were also instrumental in helping Kurosawa obtain financing for his late films: Lucas and Coppola served as co-producers on ''Kagemusha'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucas&quot; /&gt; while the Spielberg name, lent to the 1990 production, ''Dreams'', helped bring that picture to fruition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spielberg&quot; /&gt;

As the first Asian filmmaker to achieve international prominence, Kurosawa has naturally served as an inspiration for other Asian ''[[Auteur theory|auteurs]]''. Of ''Rashomon'', the most famous director of [[India]], [[Satyajit Ray]], said: &quot;The effect of the film on me [upon first seeing it in Calcutta in 1952] was electric. I saw it three times on consecutive days, and wondered each time if there was another film anywhere which gave such sustained and dazzling proof of a director's command over every aspect of film making.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ray|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Asian admirers include the Japanese actor and director [[Takeshi Kitano]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tirard|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hong Kong filmmaker [[John Woo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa: The Last Emperor|loc=John Woo interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/callingtheshots/john_woo.shtml |title=Movies – Calling the Shots No.10: John Woo |author=Pierce, Nev |publisher=BBC |date=2004-01-16 |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/15/movies/20080714201452&amp;sec=movies |title=Epic homecoming |author=Koay, Allan |publisher=Star-ecentral.com |date=2008-07-15 |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mainland China|mainland Chinese]] director [[Zhang Yimou]], who called Kurosawa &quot;the quintessential Asian director.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990823/kurosawa1.html |title=Time 100: Akira Kurosawa |publisher=Time.com |date=1999-08-23 |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Kurosawa Production Co., established in 1959, continues to oversee much of Kurosawa's legacy. The director's son, Hisao Kurosawa, is the current head of the company. Its American subsidiary, Kurosawa Enterprises, is located in Los Angeles. Rights to Kurosawa's works are held by Kurosawa Production and the film studios under which he worked, most notably [[Toho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toho.co.jp |title=Web Site |publisher=Toho Co, Ltd. |language={{ja icon}} |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa Production works closely with the Akira Kurosawa Foundation, established in December 2003 and also run by Hisao Kurosawa. The foundation organizes an annual [[Akira Kurosawa Memorial Short Film Competition|short film competition]] and spearheads Kurosawa-related projects, including a recently shelved one to build a memorial museum for the director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Money paid for building Akira Kurosawa museum to be returned |url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/arts/news/20100606p2g00m0dm035000c.html |newspaper=[[Mainichi Shimbun|The Mainichi Daily News]] |date=2010–06–06 |accessdate=2010–06–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the [[Kurosawa Film Studio]] was opened in Yokohama; two additional locations have since been launched in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurosawafilmstudio.com/info.html |title=Kurosawa Film Studio |publisher=Kurosawa Film Studio Co. Ltd. |language={{ja icon}} |accessdate=2009-08-29}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large collection of archive material, including scanned screenplays, photos and news articles, has been made available through the Akira Kurosawa Digital Archive, a Japanese website maintained by [[Ryukoku University]] Digital Archives Research Center in collaboration with Kurosawa Production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ss.i.ryukoku.ac.jp/pearl/pages/pearl/index.html# |title=bluesky |publisher=SGI Japan Ltd. | language={{ja icon}} |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anaheim University]]'s Akira Kurosawa School of Film]  was launched in spring 2009 with the backing of Kurosawa Production. It offers online programs in digital film making, with headquarters in Anaheim and a learning center in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anaheim.edu/content/view/748/718 |title=Anaheim University - Online MBA, Online Green MBA and Online TESOL programs – Online MFA in Digital Filmmaking |publisher=Anaheim University |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two film awards have also been named in Kurosawa's honor. The Akira Kurosawa Award for Lifetime Achievement in Film Directing is awarded during the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]], while the Akira Kurosawa Award is given during the [[Tokyo International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.sffs.org/awards_tributes/search.php?search_by=1&amp;searchfield=Akira+Kurosawa+Award&amp;x=16&amp;y=10 |title=FILMS: San Francisco Film Festival |publisher=San Francisco Film Society |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117994692.html?categoryId=3268&amp;cs=1 |author=Schilling, Mark |title=Mikhalkov given Kurosawa Award – Entertainment News, Tokyo Intl. Film Festival |publisher=Variety.com |accessdate=2009-08-29 | date=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Kurosawa's birth in 2010, a project called AK100 was launched in 2008. The AK100 Project aims to &quot;expose young people who are the representatives of the next generation, and all people everywhere, to the light and spirit of Akira Kurosawa and the wonderful world he created.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ak100wt.com/en |title=AK100 World Tour |publisher=AK100 World Tour team |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
