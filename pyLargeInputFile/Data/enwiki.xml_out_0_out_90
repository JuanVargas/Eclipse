===Motivation===
[[Black body]] radiators are the reference by which the whiteness of light sources is judged. A black body can be described by its color temperature, whose hues are depicted above. By analogy, nearly-Planckian light sources such as certain [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] or [[high-intensity discharge lamp]]s can be judged by their ''correlated'' color temperature (CCT); the color temperature of the Planckian radiator that best approximates them. The question is: what is the relationship between the light source's relative [[spectral power distribution]] and its correlated color temperature?

===Background===
[[Image:Judd's (r,g) diagram.svg|thumb|200px|Judd's (r,g) diagram. The concentric curves indicate the loci of constant [[colorfulness|purity]].]]

The even spacing of the isotherms on the locus implies that the mired scale is a better measure of perceptual color difference than the temperature scale.]]

The notion of using Planckian radiators as a yardstick against which to judge other light sources is not a new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Edward P.|last=Hyde|year=1911|quote=This existence of a color match is a consequence of there being approximately the same energy distribution in the visible spectra.|publisher=The American Physical Society|journal=Physical Review (Series I)|volume=32|pages=632–633|doi=10.1103/PhysRevSeriesI.32.632|title=A New Determination of the Selective Radiation from Tantalum (abstract)|issue=6|month=June}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, writing about &quot;grading of illuminants with reference to quality of color…the temperature of the source as an index of the quality of color&quot;, Priest essentially described CCT as we understand it today, going so far as to use the term ''apparent color temperature'', and astutely recognized three cases:&lt;ref name=priest&gt;{{cite journal|first=Irwin G.|last=Priest|title=The colorimetry and photometry of daylight ·and incandescent illuminants by the method of rotatory dispersion|journal=[[JOSA]]|volume=7|issue=12|pages=1175–1209|year=1923| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-7-12-1175| quote=''The color temperature of a source is the temperature at which a Planckian radiator would emit radiant energy competent to evoke a color of the same quality as that evoked  by the radiant energy from the source in question''. The color temperature is not necessarily the same as the 'true temperature' of the source; but this circumstance has no significance whatever in the use of the color temperature as a  means to the end of establishing a scale for the quality of the color of illuminants. For this purpose no knowledge of the temperature of the source nor indeed of its emissive properties is required. ''All that is involved in giving the color temperature of any illuminant is the affirmation that the color of the luminant is of the same quality as the color of a Planckian radiator at the given temperature''.|doi=10.1364/JOSA.7.001175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &quot;Those for which the spectral distribution of energy is such that the color can be matched ''only approximately'' by a stimulus of the Planckian form of spectral distribution.&quot;

Several important developments occurred in 1931. In chronological order:

# [[Raymond Davis, Jr.|Davis]] published a paper on ''correlated color temperature'' (his term). Referring to the [[Planckian locus]] on the r-g diagram, he defined the CCT as the average of the ''primary component temperatures'' (RGB CCTs), using [[trilinear coordinates]].&lt;ref name=davis&gt;{{cite journal|first=Raymond|last=Davis|authorlink=Raymond Davis, Jr.|title=A Correlated Color Temperature for Illuminants|journal=National Bureau of Standards Journal of Research|volume=7|comment=Research Paper 365|pages=659–681|year=1931|quote=The ideal correlated colour temperature of a light source is the absolute temperature at which the Planckian radiator emits radiant energy component to evoke a colour which, of all Planckian colours, most closely approximates the colour evoked by the source in question.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The CIE announced the [[XYZ color space]].
# Judd published a paper on the nature of &quot;[[just noticeable difference|least perceptible differences]]&quot; with respect to chromatic stimuli. By empirical means he determined that the difference in sensation, which he termed [[color difference|ΔE]] for a &quot;discriminatory step between colors…Empfindung&quot; (German for sensation) was proportional to the distance of the colors on the chromaticity diagram. Referring to the (r,g) chromaticity diagram depicted aside, he hypothesized that:&lt;ref name=judd&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chromaticity sensibility to stimulus differences|journal=[[JOSA]]|first=Deane B.|last=Judd|pages=72–108|volume=22|year=1931|issue=2| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?id=48631|doi=10.1364/JOSA.22.000072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::''K''Δ''E'' = |''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;| = max(|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|, |''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|)

These developments paved the way for the development of new chromaticity spaces that are more suited to the estimation of correlated color temperatures and chromaticity differences. Bridging the concepts of color difference and color temperature, Priest made the observation that the eye is sensitive to constant differences in ''reciprocal'' temperature:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A proposed scale for use in specifying the chromaticity of incandescent illuminants and various phases of daylight|first=Irwin G.|last=Priest|month=February|year=1933|journal=[[JOSA]]|volume=23|issue=2|url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-23-2-41|pages=42|doi=10.1364/JOSA.23.000041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A difference of one [[mired|micro-reciprocal-degree]] (μrd) is fairly representative of the doubtfully perceptible difference under the most favorable conditions of observation.}}

Priest proposed to use &quot;the scale of temperature as a scale for arranging the chromaticities of the several illuminants in a serial order.&quot;  Over the next few years, Judd published three more significant papers:

# The first verified the findings of Priest,&lt;ref name=priest/&gt; Davis,&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; and Judd,&lt;ref name=judd/&gt; with a paper on sensitivity to change in color temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Deane B.|last=Judd|month=January|year=1933|journal=[[JOSA]]|volume=23|issue=1| title=Sensibility to Color-Temperature Change as a Function of Temperature| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-23-1-7| quote=Regarding (Davis, 1931): This simpler statement of the spectral-centroid relation might have been deduced by combining two previous findings, one by Gibson (see footnote 10, p. 12) concerning a spectral-centroid relation between incident and transmitted light for daylight filters, the other by Langmuir and Orange (Trans. A.I.E.E., 32, 1944–1946 (1913)) concerning a similar relation involving reciprocal temperature. The mathematical analysis on which this latter finding is based was given later by Foote, Mohler and Fairchild, J. Wash. Acad. Sci. 7, 545–549 (1917), and Gage, Trans. I.E.S. 16, 428–429 (1921) also called attention to this relation.|doi=10.1364/JOSA.23.000007|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#&lt;p&gt;The second proposed a new chromaticity space, guided by a principle that has become the holy grail of color spaces: [[perceptual uniformity]] (chromaticity distance should be commensurate with perceptual difference). By means of a [[projective transformation]], Judd found a more ''uniform chromaticity space'' (UCS) in which to find the CCT. Judd determined the ''nearest color temperature'' by simply finding the nearest point on the [[Planckian locus]] to the chromaticity of the stimulus on [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s [[color triangle]], depicted aside. The [[transformation matrix]] he used to convert X,Y,Z tristimulus values to R,G,B coordinates was:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Maxwell Triangle Yielding Uniform Chromaticity Scales|journal=[[JOSA]]|first=Deane B.|last=Judd|volume=25|issue=1|year=1935|month=January|pages=24–35| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-25-1-24| quote=An important application of this coordinate system is its use in finding from any series of colors the one most resembling a neighboring color of the same brilliance, for example, the finding of the nearest color temperature for a neighboring non-Planckian stimulus.

[[Image:CIE 1960 UCS.png‎|thumb|250px|MacAdam's &quot;uniform chromaticity scale&quot; diagram; a simplification of Judd's UCS.]]

===Calculation===
Judd's idea of determining the nearest point to the Planckian locus on a uniform chromaticity space is current. In 1937, MacAdam suggested a &quot;modified uniform chromaticity scale diagram&quot;, based on certain simplifying geometrical considerations:&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Projective transformations of I.C.I. color specifications|first=David L.|last=MacAdam|journal=[[JOSA]]|year=1937|month=August|volume=27|issue=8|pages=294–299|url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-27-8-294|doi=10.1364/JOSA.27.000294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{4x}{-2x+12y+3}, \quad v = \frac{6y}{-2x+12y+3}&lt;/math&gt;

This (u,v) chromaticity space became the [[CIE 1960 color space]], which is still used to calculate the CCT (even though MacAdam did not devise it with this purpose in mind).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delta.dk/C1256ED600446B80/sysOakFil/i102/$File/I102%20Correlated%20Colour%20Temperature.pdf The CIE definition of correlated color temperature]&lt;/ref&gt; Using other chromaticity spaces, such as u'v', leads to non-standard results that may nevertheless be perceptually meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:Planckian-locus.png|550px|thumb|center|Close up of the [[CIE 1960 color space|CIE 1960 UCS]]. The isotherms are perpendicular to the Planckian locus, and are drawn to indicate the maximum distance from the locus that the CIE considers the correlated color temperature to be meaningful: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\Delta uv=\pm 0.05&lt;/math&gt;]]

The distance from the locus (i.e., degree of departure from a black body) is traditionally indicated in units of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\Delta uv&lt;/math&gt;; positive for points above the locus. This concept of distance has evolved to become [[color difference#Delta E|Delta E]], which continues to be used today.

====Robertson's method====
Before the advent of powerful, [[personal computer]]s, it was common to estimate the correlated color temperature by way of interpolation from look-up tables and charts.&lt;ref name=kelly/&gt; The most famous such method is Robertson's,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Computation of Correlated Color Temperature and Distribution Temperature|first=Alan R.|last=Robertson| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-58-11-1528|journal=[[JOSA]]|volume=58|issue=11|pages=1528–1535|year=1968|month=November|doi=10.1364/JOSA.58.001528}}&lt;/ref&gt; who took advantage of the relatively even spacing of the mired scale (see above) to calculate the CCT T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; using [[linear interpolation]] of the isotherm's mired values:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?Eqn_XYZ_to_T.html ANSI C implementation], Bruce Lindbloom&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Robertson's CCT computation method.svg|300px|thumb|Computation of the CCT T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; corresponding to the chromaticity coordinate &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (u_T,v_T)&lt;/math&gt; in the CIE 1960 UCS.]]

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{T_c}=\frac{1}{T_i}+\frac{\theta_1}{\theta_1+\theta_2} \left( \frac{1}{T_{i+1}} - \frac{1}{T_i} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; are the color temperatures of the look-up isotherms and i is chosen such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_i &lt; T_c &lt; T_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;. (Furthermore, the test chromaticity lies between the only two adjacent lines for which &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle d_i/d_{i+1}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;.)

If the isotherms are tight enough, one can assume &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\theta_1/\theta_2 \approx \sin \theta_1/\sin \theta_2&lt;/math&gt;, leading to

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{T_c}=\frac{1}{T_i}+\frac{d_i}{d_i-d_{i+1}} \left( \frac{1}{T_{i+1}} - \frac{1}{T_i} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The distance of the test point to the i'th isotherm is given by

&lt;math&gt;d_i=\frac{ (v_T-v_i)-m_i (u_T-u_i) }{\sqrt {1+m_i^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (u_i,v_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the chromaticity coordinate of the i'th isotherm on the Planckian locus and m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the isotherm's [[slope]]. Since it is perpendicular to the locus, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m_i=-1/l_i&lt;/math&gt; where l&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the slope of the locus at &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (u_i,v_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Precautions===
Although the CCT can be calculated for any chromaticity coordinate, the result is meaningful only if the light sources are nearly white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Determination of correlated color temperature based on a color-appearance model|first=Wolfgang|last=Walter|journal=Color Research &amp; Application|volume=17|issue=1|pages=24–30|month=February|year=1992|doi=10.1002/col.5080170107|quote=The concept of correlated color temperature is only useful for lamps with chromaticity points close to the blackbody…}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIE recommends that &quot;The concept of correlated color temperature should not be used if the chromaticity of the test source differs more than [&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\Delta_{uv} = 5 \times 10^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;] from the Planckian radiator.&quot;&lt;ref name=schanda&gt;{{cite book|title=Colorimetry: Understanding the CIE System|first=János|last=Schanda|publisher=[[Wiley Interscience]]|year=2007|chapter=3: CIE Colorimetry|page=37–46|isbn=978-0-470-04904-4|doi=10.1002/9780470175637.ch3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Beyond a certain value of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\Delta uv&lt;/math&gt;, a chromaticity co-ordinate may be equidistant to two points on the locus, causing ambiguity in the CCT.

===Approximation===
If a narrow range of color temperatures is considered—those encapsulating daylight being the most practical case—one can approximate the Planckian locus in order to calculate the CCT in terms of chromaticity coordinates. Following Kelly's observation that the isotherms intersect in the purple region near (''x''=0.325, ''y''=0.154),&lt;ref name=kelly&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Kenneth L.|year=1963|month=August|title=Lines of Constant Correlated Color Temperature Based on MacAdam’s (u,v) Uniform Chromaticity Transformation of the CIE Diagram|journal=JOSA|volume=53|issue=8|pages=999–1002| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-53-8-999|doi=10.1364/JOSA.53.000999}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCamy proposed this cubic approximation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Correlated color temperature as an explicit function of chromaticity coordinates|volume=17|issue=2|pages=142–144|journal=Color Research &amp; Application|first=Calvin S.|month=April|year=1992|last=McCamy| doi=10.1002/col.5080170211}} plus [[:DOI:10.1002/col.5080180222|erratum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

where ''n'' = (''x'' - ''x&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'')/(''y'' - ''y&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'') is the inverse slope line and (''x&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.3320, ''y&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.1858) is the &quot;epicenter&quot;; quite close to the intersection point mentioned by Kelly. The maximum absolute error for color temperatures ranging from 2856 (illuminant A) to 6504 ([[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]]) is under 2&amp;nbsp;K.

A more recent proposal, using exponential terms, considerably extends the applicable range by adding a second epicenter for high color temperatures:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Calculating Correlated Color Temperatures Across the Entire Gamut of Daylight and Skylight Chromaticities|first=Javier|last=Hernández-Andrés|journal=Applied Optics|volume=38|issue=27|pages=5703–5709|month=September 20|year=1999|doi=10.1364/AO.38.005703| url=http://www.nadn.navy.mil/Users/oceano/raylee/papers/RLee_AO_CCTpaper.pdf|pmid=18324081|last2=Lee|first2=RL|last3=Romero|first3=J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Color rendering index==
The [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] [[color rendering index]] (CRI) is a method to determine how well a light source's illumination of eight sample patches compares to the illumination provided by a reference source. Cited together, the CRI and CCT give a numerical estimate of what reference (ideal) light source best approximates a particular artificial light, and what the difference is.

==Spectral power distribution==
[[Image:Spectral Power Distributions.png|right|frame|Here is an example of how different an incandescent lamp's SPD graph is from that of a fluorescent lamp.]]

Light sources and illuminants may be characterized by their [[spectral power distribution]] (SPD). The relative SPD curves provided by many manufacturers may have been produced using 10-[[nanometre]] (nm) increments or more on their [[spectroradiometer]].&lt;ref&gt;Gretag's [http://www.xrite.com/documents/literature/gmb/en/200_spectrolino_manual_en.pdf SpectroLino] and X-Rite's [http://www.pictureline.com/images/pdf/L11-246%20CM%20CompetitCompr_03-17-08.pdf ColorMunki] have an optical resolution of 10 nm.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is what would seem to be a smoother (&quot;[[full-spectrum light|fuller spectrum]]&quot;) power distribution than the lamp actually has. Owing to their spiky distribution, much finer increments are advisable for taking measurements of fluorescent lights, and this requires more expensive equipment.

[[File:Dr. Seuss WikiWorld.png|right|thumb|300px|Example of a modern cartoon. The text was excerpted by cartoonist Greg Williams from the Wikipedia article [[Dr. Seuss]].]]
The word '''cartoon''' has various meanings, based on several very different forms of [[visual art]] and [[illustration]]. The artists who draw cartoons are known as [[cartoonists]].

The term has evolved over time. The original meaning was in fine art of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, where it referred to a preparatory [[drawing]] for a piece of art, such as a painting or [[tapestry]]. In the 19th century, it came to refer to humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers, and in the early 20th century it was sometimes used to refer to [[comic strip]]s.&lt;ref name=Becker&gt;Becker, Stephen. ''Comic Art in America''. Simon &amp; Schuster, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; In more modern usage, it commonly refers to [[animation|animated]] programs for television and other motion-picture media.

==Fine art==
{{Main|Modello}}
A cartoon (from the [[Italian language|Italian]] &quot;cartone&quot; and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word &quot;karton&quot;, meaning strong, heavy paper or pasteboard) is a full-size drawing made on sturdy [[paper]] as a study or ''[[modello]]'' for a [[painting]], [[stained glass]] or [[tapestry]]. Cartoons were typically used in the production of [[fresco]]es, to accurately link the component parts of the composition when painted on damp [[plaster]] over a series of days (''giornate'').
[[File:Edward Burne-Jones Daniel 1873.jpg|right|170px|thumb|Cartoon for stained glass window of [[Daniel]] by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], 1873.]]
Such cartoons often have pinpricks along the outlines of the design; a bag of soot was then patted or &quot;pounced&quot; over the cartoon, held against the wall to leave black dots on the plaster (&quot;pouncing&quot;). Cartoons by [[Painting|painter]]s, such as the [[Raphael Cartoons]] in London and examples by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], are highly prized in their own right. Tapestry cartoons, usually coloured, were followed by eye by the [[weaving|weavers]] on the [[loom]].&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;

==Print media==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Stoke-on-Trent]] --&gt;
[[File:SubstanceandShadow.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]]'s &quot;Cartoon no.1: Substance and Shadow&quot; (1843) satirized preparatory cartoons for frescoes in the Palace of Westminster, creating the modern meaning of &quot;cartoon&quot;.]]

In modern print media, a cartoon is a piece of art, usually humorous in intent. This usage dates from 1843 when ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' magazine applied the term to satirical drawings in its pages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Punch.co.uk|title=History of the Cartoon|url=http://punch.co.uk/cartoonhistory02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly sketches by John Leech. The first of these parodied the preparatory cartoons for grand historical frescoes in the then-new [[Palace of Westminster]]. The original title for these drawings was ''Mr Punch's face is the letter Q'' and the new title &quot;cartoon&quot; was intended to be ironic, a reference to the self-aggrandizing posturing of Westminster politicians.

Modern single-panel cartoons or [[gag cartoon]]s, found in magazines, generally consist of a single drawing with a typeset caption positioned beneath or (much less often) a [[speech balloon]]. Newspaper syndicates have also distributed single-panel gag cartoons by [[Mel Calman]], [[Bill Holman]], [[Gary Larson]], [[George Lichty]], [[Fred Neher]] and others.

Many consider ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' cartoonist [[Peter Arno]] the father of the modern gag cartoon (as did Arno himself). The roster of magazine gag cartoonists includes [[Charles Addams]], [[Charles Barsotti]] and [[Chon Day]]. [[Bill Hoest]], [[Jerry Marcus]] and [[Virgil Partch]] began as a magazine gag cartoonists and moved on to do syndicated [[comic strips]]. Noteworthy in the area of newspaper cartoon illustration is [[Richard Thompson (cartoonist)|Richard Thompson]], who illustrated numerous feature articles in ''[[The Washington Post]]''.

[[Editorial cartoons]] are found almost exclusively in news publications and news websites. Although they also employ humor, they are more serious in tone, commonly using [[irony]] or [[satire]]. The art usually acts as a visual metaphor to illustrate a point of view on current social and/or political topics. Editorial cartoons often include speech balloons and, sometimes, multiple panels. [[Editorial cartoonist]]s of note include [[Herblock]], [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]], [[Jeff MacNelly]], [[Mike Peters (cartoonist)|Mike Peters]] and [[Gerald Scarfe]].&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;

Comic strips, also known as &quot;cartoon strips&quot; in the United Kingdom, are found daily in newspapers worldwide, and are usually a short series of cartoon illustrations in sequence. In the [[United States]] they are not as commonly called &quot;cartoons&quot; themselves, but rather &quot;comics&quot; or &quot;[[Sunday comics|funnies]]&quot;. Nonetheless, the creators of comic strips—as well as [[comic book]]s and [[graphic novel]]s—are usually referred to as &quot;[[cartoonist]]s&quot;. Although humor is the most prevalent subject matter, adventure and drama are also represented in this medium. Noteworthy cartoonists of humor strips include [[Scott Adams]], [[Steve Bell (cartoonist)|Steve Bell]], [[Charles Schulz]], [[E. C. Segar]], [[Mort Walker]] and [[Bill Watterson]].&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;

==Books==
Books with cartoons are usually reprints of newspaper cartoons. On some occasions, new gag cartoons have been created for book publication, as was the case with ''Think Small'', a 1967 promotional book distributed as a giveaway by [[Volkswagen]] dealers. [[Bill Hoest]] and other cartoonists of that decade drew cartoons showing Volkswagens, and these were published along with humorous automotive essays by such humorists as [[H. Allen Smith]], [[Roger Price (comedy)|Roger Price]] and [[Jean Shepherd]]. The book's design juxtaposed each cartoon alongside a photograph of the cartoon's creator.

==Animation==
[[File:Animhorse.gif|right|thumb|200px|An [[animated cartoon]] horse, drawn by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos.]]
{{Main|Animated cartoon}}
Because of the stylistic similarities between comic strips and early animated movies, &quot;cartoon&quot; came to refer to [[animation]], and the word &quot;cartoon&quot; is currently used to refer to both animated cartoons and gag cartoons. While &quot;animation&quot; designates any style of illustrated images seen in rapid succession to give the impression of movement, the word &quot;cartoon&quot; is most often used in reference to TV programs and short films for children featuring [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] animals, [[superhero]]es, the adventures of child protagonists and related genres.

At the end of the 1980s, the word &quot;cartoon&quot; was shortened, and the word &quot;[[toon]]&quot; came into usage with the live action/animated feature ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (1988), followed two years later by the TV series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' (1990).

The '''Chief Minister of the Northern Territory''' is appointed by the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory of Australia|Administrator]], who in normal circumstances will appoint the head of whatever party holds the majority of seats in the legislature of the territory (in the [[Northern Territory]], the [[Legislative Assembly]]). However, in times of constitutional crisis the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory of Australia|Administrator]] can appoint someone else as Chief Minister. 

In [[Australia]], a [[Chief Minister]] is the [[head of government]] of a self-governing territory, while the head of government of a state is a [[Premiers of the Australian states|Premier]]. 

The incumbent Chief Minister of the Northern Territory is [[Paul Henderson (Australian politician)|Paul Henderson]], representing the [[Australian Labor Party]] since 2007.

'''Chemotherapy''' (sometimes '''cancer chemotherapy''') is the treatment of cancer with an '''antineoplastic''' drug or with a combination of such drugs into a [[chemotherapy regimen|standardized treatment regimen]].

Most commonly, chemotherapy acts by killing cells that divide rapidly, one of the main properties of most cancer cells. This means that it also harms cells that divide rapidly under normal circumstances: cells in the [[bone marrow]], [[digestive tract]] and [[hair follicle]]s; this results in the most common side effects of chemotherapy: [[myelosuppression]] (decreased production of blood cells, hence also [[immunosuppression]]), [[mucositis]] (inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract), and [[alopecia]] (hair loss).

Newer anticancer drugs act directly against abnormal proteins in cancer cells; this is termed  [[targeted therapy]] and is technically not chemotherapy.

==History==
{{See|History of cancer chemotherapy}}

The use of minerals and plant-based medicines are believed to date back to [[prehistoric medicine]].

The first use of drugs to treat cancer, however, was in the early 20th century, although it was not originally intended for that purpose. [[Mustard gas]] was used as a [[chemical warfare]] agent during [[World War I]] and was studied further during [[World War II]]. During a military operation in World War II, a group of people were accidentally exposed to mustard gas and were later found to have very low white blood cell counts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hirsch J |title=An anniversary for cancer chemotherapy |journal=JAMA |volume=296 |issue=12 |pages=1518–20 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=17003400 |doi=10.1001/jama.296.12.1518}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reasoned that an agent that damaged the rapidly growing white blood cells might have a similar effect on cancer. Therefore, in the 1940s, several patients with advanced lymphomas (cancers of certain white blood cells) were given the drug by vein, rather than by breathing the irritating gas. Their improvement, although temporary, was remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Goodman LS, Wintrobe MM, Dameshek W, Goodman MJ, Gilman A,

As a result, many other drugs have been developed to treat cancer, and drug development since then has exploded into a multibillion-dollar industry, although the principles and limitations of chemotherapy discovered by the early researchers still apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Joensuu H. | title = Systemic chemotherapy for cancer: from weapon to treatment| journal =  Lancet Oncol.| volume = 9| issue = 3 | pages = 304 | year = 2008| pmid=18308256 | doi = 10.1016/S1470-2045(08)70075-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

===The term chemotherapy===
The word &quot;chemotherapy&quot; without a modifier nowadays only refers to cancer treatment, but its historical meaning is broader. In the most simple sense, chemotherapy is the treatment of an ailment by [[chemicals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|two/000020054|chemotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially by killing micro-organisms. As such, the term has been used for non-[[Oncology|oncological]] use, such as the use of [[antibiotic]]s (''antibacterial chemotherapy''). In that sense, the first modern chemotherapeutic agent was [[arsphenamine]], an arsenic compound discovered in 1909 and used to treat [[syphilis]]. This was later followed by [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]] (sulfa drugs) and [[penicillin]]. Other uses of that have been termed chemotherapy are the treatment of [[autoimmune disease]]s such as [[multiple sclerosis]], [[dermatomyositis]], [[polymyositis]], [[lupus]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]] (See [[DMARD]]s) and the suppression of [[transplant rejection]]s (see [[immunosuppression]]).

==Principles==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
[[Cancer]] is the uncontrolled growth of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s coupled with [[malignant]] behavior: invasion and [[metastasis]].  Cancer is thought to be caused by the interaction between [[gene]]tic susceptibility and environmental toxins.

In the broad sense, most ''chemotherapeutic'' drugs work by impairing [[mitosis]] ([[cell division]]), effectively targeting [[fast-dividing cells]]. As these drugs cause damage to cells they are termed ''cytotoxic''. Some drugs cause cells to undergo [[apoptosis]] (so-called &quot;self programmed cell death&quot;).

Scientists have yet to identify specific features of malignant and immune cells that would make them uniquely targetable (barring some recent examples, such as the [[Philadelphia chromosome]] as targeted by [[imatinib]]). This means that other fast-dividing cells, such as those responsible for [[hair]] growth and for replacement of the [[intestine|intestinal]] [[epithelium]] (lining), are also often affected. However, some drugs have a better [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]] profile than others, enabling [[physician|doctors]] to adjust treatment regimens to the advantage of patients in certain situations.

As chemotherapy affects cell division, tumors with high ''growth fractions'' (such as [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] and the aggressive [[lymphoma]]s, including [[Hodgkin's disease]]) are more sensitive to chemotherapy, as a larger proportion of the targeted cells are undergoing [[cell division]] at any time.  Malignancies with slower growth rates, such as indolent lymphomas, tend to respond to chemotherapy much more modestly.

Drugs affect &quot;younger&quot; tumors (i.e., more differentiated) more effectively, because mechanisms regulating cell growth are usually still preserved. With succeeding generations of tumor cells, differentiation is typically lost, growth becomes less regulated, and tumors become less responsive to most chemotherapeutic agents. Near the center of some solid tumors, cell division has effectively ceased, making them insensitive to chemotherapy. Another problem with solid tumors is the fact that the chemotherapeutic agent often does not reach the core of the tumor. Solutions to this problem include [[radiation therapy]] (both [[sealed source radiotherapy|brachytherapy]] and [[external beam radiotherapy|teletherapy]]) and [[surgery]].

Over time, cancer cells become more resistant to chemotherapy treatments.  Recently, scientists have identified small pumps on the surface of cancer cells that actively move chemotherapy from inside the cell to the outside.  Research on [[p-glycoprotein]] and other such chemotherapy efflux pumps, is currently ongoing.  Medications to inhibit the function of [[p-glycoprotein]] are undergoing testing as of June, 2007 to enhance the [[wikt:efficacy|efficacy]] of chemotherapy.

==Treatment schemes==
{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}
There are a number of strategies in the administration of chemotherapeutic drugs used today. Chemotherapy may be given with a [[cure|curative]] intent or it may aim to prolong life or to [[Palliative care|palliate symptoms]].

''Combined modality chemotherapy'' is the use of drugs with other [[Cancer#Treatments|cancer treatments]], such as [[radiation therapy]] or [[surgery]]. Most cancers are now treated in this way. ''Combination chemotherapy'' is a similar practice that involves treating a patient with a number of different drugs simultaneously. The drugs differ in their mechanism and side effects. The biggest advantage is minimising the chances of resistance developing to any one agent.

In ''[[neoadjuvant]] chemotherapy'' (''preoperative'' treatment) initial chemotherapy is designed to shrink the primary tumour, thereby rendering local therapy (surgery or radiotherapy) less destructive or more effective.

''[[Adjuvant chemotherapy]]'' (''post''operative treatment) can be used when there is little evidence of cancer present, but there is risk of recurrence. This can help reduce chances of developing resistance if the tumour does develop. It is also useful in killing any cancerous cells which have spread to other parts of the body. This is often effective as the newly growing tumours are fast-dividing, and therefore very susceptible.

''Palliative chemotherapy'' is given without curative intent, but simply to decrease tumor load and increase life expectancy. For these regimens, a better toxicity profile is generally expected.

All chemotherapy regimens require that the patient be capable of undergoing the treatment. [[Performance status]] is often used as a measure to determine whether a patient can receive chemotherapy, or whether dose reduction is required.  Because only a fraction of the cells in a tumor die with each treatment ([[fractional kill]]), repeated doses must be administered to continue to reduce the size of the tumor.&lt;ref name=skeel&gt;{{cite book | last1=Skeel |first1= R.

==Types==
The majority of chemotherapeutic drugs can be divided in to [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agent]]s, [[antimetabolite]]s, [[anthracycline]]s, plant [[alkaloid]]s, [[topoisomerase]] inhibitors, and other antitumour agents.&lt;ref name=takimoto/&gt; All of these drugs affect [[cell division]] or [[DNA]] synthesis and function in some way.

Some newer agents do not directly interfere with DNA. These include [[monoclonal antibodies]] and the new [[tyrosine kinase]] inhibitors e.g. ''[[imatinib|imatinib mesylate]]'' (''Gleevec'' or ''Glivec''), which directly targets a molecular abnormality in certain types of cancer ([[chronic myelogenous leukemia]], [[gastrointestinal stromal tumor]]s). These are examples of [[targeted therapy|targeted therapies]].

In addition, some drugs that modulate tumor cell behaviour without directly attacking those cells may be used.  Hormone treatments fall into this category.

Where available, [[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System]] codes are provided for the major categories.

===Alkylating agents (L01A)===
{{Main|Alkylating antineoplastic agent}}

Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to alkylate many [[nucleophilic]] functional groups under conditions present in cells. [[Cisplatin]] and [[carboplatin]], as well as [[oxaliplatin]], are alkylating agents. They impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules.&lt;ref name=takimoto&gt;Takimoto CH, Calvo E. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter03/article/10165/1402628 &quot;Principles of Oncologic Pharmacotherapy&quot;] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other agents are [[mechlorethamine]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[chlorambucil]], [[ifosfamide]].&lt;ref name=takimoto/&gt; They work by chemically modifying a cell's DNA.

===Anti-metabolites (L01B)===
{{Main|Antimetabolite}}

[[Anti-metabolite]]s masquerade as [[purine]]s ((azathioprine, [[mercaptopurine]])) or [[pyrimidine]]s—which become the building blocks of DNA. They prevent these substances from becoming incorporated in to DNA during the &quot;S&quot; phase (of the [[cell cycle]]), stopping normal development and division. They also affect RNA synthesis. Due to their efficiency, these drugs are the most widely used cytostatics.

=== Plant alkaloids and terpenoids (L01C) ===
These [[alkaloid]]s are derived from [[plant]]s and block cell division by preventing [[microtubule]] function. Microtubules are vital for cell division, and, without them, cell division cannot occur.  The main examples are [[vinca alkaloid]]s and [[taxane]]s.

==== Vinca alkaloids (L01CA) ====
Vinca alkaloids bind to specific sites on tubulin, inhibiting the assembly of tubulin into microtubules ([[M phase]] of the [[cell cycle]]). They are derived from the [[Madagascar periwinkle]], ''Catharanthus roseus'' (formerly known as ''Vinca rosea''). The vinca alkaloids include:
* [[Vincristine]]
* [[Vinblastine]]
* [[Vinorelbine]]
* [[Vindesine]]

==== Podophyllotoxin (L01CB) ====
[[Podophyllotoxin]] is a plant-derived compound which is said to help with digestion as well as used to produce two other cytostatic drugs, [[etoposide]] and [[teniposide]]. They prevent the cell from entering the [[G1 phase]] (the start of DNA replication) and the replication of DNA (the [[S phase]]). The exact mechanism of its action is not yet known.

The substance has been primarily obtained from the [[American Mayapple]] (''Podophyllum peltatum''). Recently it has been discovered that a rare [[Himalayan Mayapple]] (''Podophyllum hexandrum'') contains it in a much greater quantity, but, as the plant is endangered, its supply is limited. Studies have been conducted to isolate the genes involved in the substance's production, so that it could be obtained [[genetic engineering|recombinantly]].

==== Taxanes (L01CD) ====
The prototype taxane is the [[natural product]] [[paclitaxel]], originally known as [[Taxol]] and first
derived from the bark of the [[Pacific Yew]] tree. [[Docetaxel]] is a semi-synthetic analogue of paclitaxel.  Taxanes enhance stability of microtubules, preventing the separation of [[chromosome]]s during [[anaphase]].

===Topoisomerase inhibitors (L01CB and L01XX) ===
[[Topoisomerase]]s are essential [[enzyme]]s that maintain the [[topology]] of DNA.  Inhibition of type I or type II topoisomerases interferes with both [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[DNA replication|replication]] of DNA by upsetting proper DNA [[supercoil]]ing.

* Some type I topoisomerase inhibitors include ''camptothecins'': [[irinotecan]] and [[topotecan]].

* Examples of type II inhibitors include [[amsacrine]], [[etoposide]], [[etoposide phosphate]], and [[teniposide]]. These are semisynthetic derivatives of [[epipodophyllotoxin]]s, alkaloids naturally occurring in the root of [[American Mayapple|American Mayapple (''Podophyllum peltatum'')]].

===Cytotoxic antibiotics (L01D)===

These include:
* [[actinomycin]] ({{ATC|L01|DA01}}).
* [[anthracycline]]s
** [[doxorubicin]] ({{ATC|L01|DB01}})
** [[daunorubicin]] ({{ATC|L01|DB02}})
** [[valrubicin]]
** [[idarubicin]]
** [[epirubicin]] ({{ATC|L01|DB03}}), which also inhibit [[topoisomerase]] II)
* other cytotoxic antibiotics
** [[bleomycin]] ({{ATC|L01|DC01}}). Bleomycin acts in unique way through [[oxidation]] of a DNA-bleomycin-Fe(II) complex and forming [[free radicals]], which induce damage and chromosomal aberrations.
** [[plicamycin]] ({{ATC|L01|DC02}})
** [[mitomycin]] ({{ATC|L01|DC03}})

==Newer and experimental approaches==
{{Main|Experimental cancer treatments}}

===Isolated infusion approaches ===
[[Isolated limb perfusion]] (often used in [[melanoma]]), or isolated infusion of chemotherapy into the liver or the lung have been used to treat some tumours.  The main purpose of these approaches is to deliver a very high dose of chemotherapy to tumor sites without causing overwhelming ''systemic'' damage. These approaches can help control solitary or limited metastases, but they are by definition ''not'' systemic, and, therefore, do not treat distributed metastases or [[micrometastasis|micrometastases]].

===Targeted delivery mechanisms===
Specially targeted delivery vehicles aim to increase effective levels of chemotherapy for tumor cells while reducing effective levels for other cells.  This should result in an increased tumor kill and/or reduced toxicity.

Specially targeted delivery vehicles have a differentially higher affinity for tumor cells by interacting with tumor-specific or tumour-associated antigens.

In addition to their targeting component, they also carry a payload - whether this is a traditional chemotherapeutic agent, or a radioisotope or an immune stimulating factor. Specially targeted delivery vehicles vary in their stability, selectivity, and choice of
target, but, in essence, they all aim to increase the maximum effective dose that can be delivered to the tumor cells.  Reduced systemic toxicity means that they can also be used in sicker patients, and that they can carry new chemotherapeutic agents that would have been far too toxic to deliver via traditional systemic approaches.

===Nanoparticles===
[[Nanoparticles]] have emerged as a useful vehicle for poorly soluble agents such as [[paclitaxel]]. [[Protein-bound paclitaxel]] (e.g., Abraxane) or nab-paclitaxel was approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in January 2005 for the treatment of refractory [[breast cancer]]. This formulation of paclitaxel uses human albumin as a vehicle and not the [[Cremophor]] vehicle used in Taxol. Nanoparticles made of magnetic material can also be used to concentrate agents at tumour sites using an externally applied magnetic field.

===Electrochemotherapy===
[[Electrochemotherapy]] is the combined treatment in which injection of a chemotherapeutic drug is followed by application of high voltage electric pulses locally to the tumor. The treatment enables the chemotherapeutic drugs, which otherwise cannot or hardly go through the membrane of cells (such as bleomycin and cisplatin), to enter the cancer cells. Hence greater effectiveness of antitumor treatment is achieved.
Clinical electrochemotherapy has been successfully used for treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors irrespective of their histological origin

BioMed Eng OnLine 9(1): 10.| year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dosage==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
Dosage of chemotherapy can be difficult: If the dose is too low, it will be ineffective against the tumor, whereas, at excessive doses, the toxicity (side effects, [[neutropenia]]) will be intolerable to the patient. This has led to the formation of detailed &quot;dosing schemes&quot; in most hospitals, which give guidance on the correct dose and adjustment in case of toxicity. In immunotherapy, they are in principle used in smaller dosages than in the treatment of malignant diseases.

In most cases, the dose is adjusted for the patient's [[body surface area]], a measure that correlates with blood volume. The BSA is usually calculated with a mathematical formula or a [[nomogram]], using a patient's weight and height, rather than by direct measurement.

==Delivery==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
Most chemotherapy is [[Route of administration|delivered]] [[intravenous]]ly, although a number of agents can be administered orally (e.g., [[melphalan]], [[busulfan]], [[capecitabine]]). In some cases, [[isolated limb perfusion]] (often used in [[melanoma]]), or isolated infusion of chemotherapy into the liver or the lung have been used.  The main purpose of these approaches is to deliver a very high dose of chemotherapy to tumour sites without causing overwhelming systemic damage.

Depending on the patient, the cancer, the stage of cancer, the type of chemotherapy, and the dosage, intravenous chemotherapy may be given on either an [[inpatient]] or an [[outpatient]] basis. For continuous, frequent or prolonged intravenous chemotherapy administration, various systems may be surgically inserted into the vasculature to maintain access. Commonly used systems are the [[Hickman line]], the [[Port-a-Cath]] or the [[PICC line]]. These have a lower infection risk, are much less prone to [[phlebitis]] or [[extravasation]], and abolish the need for repeated insertion of peripheral cannulae.

Harmful and lethal toxicity from chemotherapy limits the dosage of chemotherapy that can be given.  Some tumors can be destroyed by sufficiently high doses of chemotherapeutic agents.  However, these high doses cannot be given because they would be fatal to the patient.

==Adverse effects==

[[Chemotherapeutic]] techniques have a range of side effects that depend on the type of medications used.  The most common medications mainly affect the [[fast-dividing cells]] of the body, such as blood cells and the cells lining the mouth, stomach, and intestines.  Common [[adverse effect|side effects]] include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/MBC/content/MBC_2_2X_What_Are_Common_Side_Effects.asp?sitearea=MBC What are Common Side Effects?] from the [[American Cancer Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Depression of the [[immune system]], which can result in potentially fatal [[infection]]s.  Although patients are encouraged to wash their hands, avoid sick people, and to take other infection-reducing steps, about 85% of infections are due to naturally occurring microorganisms in the patient's own [[gastrointestinal tract]] (including [[oral cavity]]) and skin.&lt;ref name=&quot;internal_medicine_a05&quot;&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Huang | first1 = Elbert S. | title = Internal medicine: handbook for clinicians, resident survival guide | year = 2000 | publisher = Scrub Hill Press | location = Arlington, VA  | isbn = 978-0-9645467-5-2 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may manifest as systemic infections, such as [[sepsis]], or as localized outbreaks, such as [[Herpes simplex]], [[shingles]], or other members of the [[human herpes virus|Herpesviridea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HSV&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elad S, Zadik Y, Hewson I, ''et al.'' |title=A systematic review of viral infections associated with oral involvement in cancer patients: a spotlight on Herpesviridea |journal=Support Care Cancer |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=993-1006 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20544224 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g476114717852h80/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, chemotherapy treatments are postponed because the immune system is suppressed to a critically low level.
* [[Cancer-related fatigue|Fatigue]].  The treatment can be physically exhausting for the patient, who might already be very tired from cancer-related fatigue.  It may produce mild to severe [[anemia]].  Treatments to mitigate anemia include hormones to boost blood production ([[erythropoietin]]), iron supplements, and [[blood transfusion]]s.
* Tendency to bleed easily.  Medications that kill rapidly dividing cells or blood cells are likely to reduce the number of [[platelet]]s in the blood, which can result in [[Hematoma|bruises]] and [[Hemorrhage|bleeding]].  Extremely low platelet counts may be temporarily boosted through [[platelet transfusion]]s.  Sometimes, chemotherapy treatments are postponed to allow platelet counts to recover.
* Gastrointestinal distress.  [[Nausea]] and vomiting are common side effects of chemotherapeutic medications that kill fast-dividing cells.  This can also produce [[diarrhea]] or [[constipation]].  [[Malnutrition]] and [[dehydration]] can result when the patient doesn't eat or drink enough, or when the patient vomits frequently, because of gastrointestinal damage.  This can result in rapid weight loss, or occasionally in weight gain, if the patient eats too much in an effort to allay nausea or heartburn.  Weight gain can also be caused by some steroid medications.  These side effects can frequently be reduced or eliminated with [[antiemetic]] drugs.  Self-care measures, such as eating frequent small meals and drinking clear liquids or [[Ginger#Medicinal_use|ginger]] tea, are often recommended.  This is a temporary effect, and frequently resolves within a week of finishing treatment.
* [[Alopecia|Hair loss]].  Some medications that kill rapidly dividing cells cause dramatic hair loss; other medications may cause hair to thin.  These are temporary effects:  hair usually starts growing back a few weeks after the last treatment, sometimes with a tendency to curl that may be called a &quot;chemo perm&quot;.

Damage to specific organs may occur, with resultant symptoms:
* [[Cardiotoxicity]] (heart damage)
* [[Hepatotoxicity]] (liver damage)
* [[Nephrotoxicity]] (kidney damage)
* [[Ototoxicity]] (damage to the inner ear), producing [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]]
* [[Encephalopathy]] (brain dysfunction)

===Immunosuppression and myelosuppression===
Virtually all chemotherapeutic regimens can cause depression of the [[immune system]], often by paralysing the [[bone marrow]] and leading to a decrease of [[white blood cell]]s, [[red blood cell]]s, and [[platelet]]s. 
[[Anemia]] and [[trombocytopenia]] when they occur, are improved with [[blood transfusion]]. [[Neutropenia]] (a decrease of the [[neutrophil granulocyte]] count below 0.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/[[litre]]) can be improved with synthetic [[G-CSF]] ([[granulocyte]]-colony stimulating factor, e.g., [[filgrastim]], [[lenograstim]]). 

In very severe [[myelosuppression]], which occurs in some regimens, almost all the bone marrow [[stem cell]]s (cells that produce [[white blood cells|white]] and [[red blood cell]]s) are destroyed, meaning ''allogenic'' or ''[[autologous]]'' [[bone marrow transplant|bone marrow cell transplants]] are necessary. (In autologous BMTs, cells are removed from the patient before the treatment, multiplied and then re-injected afterwards; in ''allogenic'' BMTs the source is a donor.) However, some patients still develop diseases because of this interference with bone marrow.

In [[Japan]] the government has approved the use of some [[medicinal mushrooms]] like ''[[Trametes versicolor]]'', to counteract depression of the immune system in patients undergoing chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;psk&quot;&gt;http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3X_Coriolous_Versicolor.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nausea and vomiting===
Chemotherapy-induced [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] (CINV) is common with many treatments and some forms of cancer.  However, some chemotherapy regimens do not have this side effect, and very effective drugs to stop or noticeably reduce this adverse effect are available.

A class of drugs called [[5-HT3 receptor antagonist|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; antagonists]] are the most effective [[antiemetic]]s and constitute the single greatest advance in the management of nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer. These drugs block one or more of the nerve signals that cause nausea and vomiting.  During the first 24 hours after chemotherapy, the most effective approach appears to be blocking the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nerve signal. Approved 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitors include [[dolasetron]], [[granisetron]], and [[ondansetron]] (Zofran). The newest 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitor, [[palonosetron]], also prevents delayed nausea and vomiting, which occurs during the 2–5 days after treatment.  Since some patients have trouble swallowing pills, these drugs are often available by [[injection (medicine)|injection]], as [[orally disintegrating tablet]]s, or as [[transdermal patch]]s.

The [[substance P]] inhibitor [[aprepitant]], which became available in 2005, is also effective in controlling the nausea of cancer chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gralla R, de Wit R, Herrstedt J, Carides A, Ianus J, Guoguang-Ma J, Evans J, Horgan K |title=Antiemetic efficacy of the neurokinin-1 antagonist, aprepitant, plus a 5HT3 antagonist and a corticosteroid in patients receiving anthracyclines or cyclophosphamide in addition to high-dose cisplatin: analysis of combined data from two Phase III randomized clinical trials |journal=Cancer |volume=104 |issue=4 |pages=864–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15973669 | doi = 10.1002/cncr.21222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bmj.323.7303.16 | last1 = Tramer | first1 = MR | last2 = Carroll | first2 = D | last3 = Campbell | first3 = FA | last4 = Reynolds | first4 = DJ | last5 = Moore | first5 = RA | last6 = McQuay | first6 = HJ. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2001 | title = Cannabinoids for control of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting: quantitative [[systematic review]]. | url = | journal = [[British Medical Journal|BMJ]] | volume = 323 | issue = 7303| pages = 16–21 | pmid = 11440936 | pmc = 34325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and patient groups say that the use of [[cannabinoid]]s derived from [[Cannabis|marijuana]] during chemotherapy greatly reduces the associated nausea and vomiting, and enables the patient to eat. Some synthetic derivatives of the active substance in marijuana ([[Tetrahydrocannabinol]] or THC) such as [[Marinol]] may be practical for this application. Natural marijuana, known as [[medical cannabis]] is also used and recommended by some oncologists, though its use is regulated and not legal everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/marihuana/about-apropos/faq_e.html &quot;Frequently Asked Questions - Medical Marihuana&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary neoplasm===
Development of secondary neoplasia after successful chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy treatment can occur.  The most common [[secondary neoplasm]] is secondary acute myeloid leukemia, which develops primarily after treatment with alkylating agents
or topoisomerase inhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;U. Rüther, C. Nunnensiek, H.-J. Schmoll,''Secondary Neoplasias following Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy, and Immunosuppression'',Contributions to Oncology (Beiträge zur Onkologie); Vol 55, 2000, ISBN 380557116X&lt;/ref&gt;  Survivors of [[childhood cancer]] are more than 13 times as likely to get a [[secondary neoplasm]] during the 30 years after treatment than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.297.11.1207 | last1 = Hijiya | first1 = N | last2 = Hudson | first2 = MM | last3 = Lensing | first3 = S | year = 2007 | last4 = Zacher | first4 = M | last5 = Onciu | first5 = M | last6 = Behm | first6 = FG | last7 = Razzouk | first7 = BI | last8 = Ribeiro | first8 = RC | last9 = Rubnitz | first9 = JE | title = Cumulative Incidence of Secondary Neoplasms as a First Event After Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 11| pages = 1207–1215 | pmid = 17374815 | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all of this increase can be attributed to chemotherapy.

===Infertility===
Some types of chemotherapy are gonadotoxic and may cause [[infertility]].&lt;ref name=Brydoy&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brydøy M, Fosså SD, Dahl O, Bjøro T |title=Gonadal dysfunction and fertility problems in cancer survivors |journal=Acta Oncol |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=480–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17497315 |doi=10.1080/02841860601166958 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02841860601166958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating drugs such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil and chlormethine.&lt;ref name=Brydoy/&gt; Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin.&lt;ref name=Brydoy/&gt; On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycinand dactinomycin and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine and 5-fluoruracil.&lt;ref name=Brydoy/&gt;

Patients may choose between several methods of [[fertility preservation]] prior to chemotherapy, including [[cryopreservation]] of semen, ovarian tissue, oocytes or embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gurgan T, Salman C, Demirol A |title=Pregnancy and assisted reproduction techniques in men and women after cancer treatment |journal=Placenta |volume=29 Suppl  B |issue= |pages=152–9 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18790328 |doi=10.1016/j.placenta.2008.07.007 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As more than half of cancer patients are elderly, this adverse effect is only relevant for a minority of patients.

===Neurological adverse effects===
Reported are cytotoxic-induced [[neuropathy]] causing [[pain]]&lt;ref name=&quot;dental_pain&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zadik Y, Vainstein V, Heling I, ''et al.'' |title=Cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced odontalgia: a differential diagnosis for dental pain |journal=J Endod |volume=36 |issue=9 |pages=1588-92 |year=2010 |month=September |pmid=20728733 |url=http://www.jendodon.com/article/S0099-2399(10)00458-9/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[paralysis]]. Some patients report fatigue or non-specific neurocognitive problems, such as an inability to concentrate; this is sometimes called [[post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment]], referred to as &quot;chemo brain&quot; by patients' groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15169812&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tannock IF, Ahles TA, Ganz PA, Van Dam FS |title=Cognitive impairment associated with chemotherapy for cancer: report of a workshop |journal=J.

===Other side effects===
In particularly large tumors, such as large [[lymphoma]]s, some patients develop [[tumor lysis syndrome]] from the rapid breakdown of malignant cells. Although prophylaxis is available and is often initiated in patients with large tumors, this is a dangerous side effect that can lead to death if left untreated.

Less common side effects include red skin ([[erythema]]), dry skin, damaged fingernails, a dry mouth ([[xerostomia]]), [[water retention]], and [[sexual impotence]].  Some medications can trigger [[allergic]] or [[pseudoallergic]] reactions.

Specific chemotherapeutic agents are associated with organ-specific toxicities, including [[cardiovascular disease]] (e.g., [[doxorubicin]]), [[interstitial lung disease]] (e.g., [[bleomycin]]) and occasionally [[secondary neoplasm]] (e.g., [[MOPP (medicine)|MOPP]] therapy for Hodgkin's disease).

==Efficacy==

Chemotherapy is highly effective in some cancers, useless in others, and unnecessary in still others.

Taking all forms of cancer together, people who receive chemotherapy increase their odds of living five years after diagnosis by about two percentage points (e.g., from about 61% being alive after five years to about 63% of them being alive after five years).&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morgan G, Ward R, Barton M |title=The contribution of cytotoxic chemotherapy to 5-year survival in adult malignancies |journal=Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol) |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=549–60 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15630849 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this overall rate obscures the wide variation.  Cytotoxic chemotherapy produces much larger gains for some forms of cancer, including [[testicular cancer]] (about 40% of the men who live five years after diagnosis are alive because of chemotherapy), [[lymphoma]]s (about 13%), and [[cervical cancer]] (12%).&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  By contrast, chemotherapy is essentially useless in other cancers, including [[prostate cancer]], [[melanoma]] of the skin, [[multiple myeloma]], [[bladder cancer]], [[kidney cancer]], and [[pancreatic cancer]]:  people who receive chemotherapy for these conditions are just as likely to die within five years as people who do not.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  Chemotherapy only slightly improves survival for some of the most common forms of cancer, including [[breast cancer]]s (1.5%) and [[lung cancer]]s (1.5%).&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;

== Occupational precautions==
For the healthcare workers that are exposed to antineoplastic agents as part of their work practice, precautions should be taken to eliminate or reduce exposure as much as possible. There already is a limitation in cytotoxics dissolution in Australia and the United States to 20 dissolutions per pharmacist/nurse, since pharmacists that prepare these drugs or nurses that may prepare and/or administer them are the two occupational groups with the highest potential exposure to antineoplastic agents. In addition, physicians and operating room personnel may also be exposed through the treatment of patients. Hospital staff, such as shipping and receiving personnel, custodial workers, laundry workers, and waste handlers, all have potential exposure to these drugs during the course of their work. The increased use of antineoplastic agents in veterinary oncology also puts these workers at risk for exposure to these drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/antineoplastic/|title=NIOSH Occupational Exposure to Antineoplastic Agents |accessdate=2007-10-10|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other animals==
Chemotherapy is used in veterinary medicine similar to in human medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McKnight JA |title=Principles of chemotherapy |journal=Clin Tech Small Anim Pract |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=67–72 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12831063 |doi= 10.1053/svms.2003.36617|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of China}}
'''Chinese [[historiography]]''' refers to the study of methods and assumptions made in studying [[Chinese history]].  

==History of Chinese Historians==
Record of Chinese history dated back to the [[Shang Dynasty]].  The ''[[Classic of History]]'', one of the [[Five Classics]] of [[Chinese classic texts]] is one of the earliest narratives of China.  The ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', the official chronicle of the State of Lu covering the period from 722 BCE to 481 BCE, is among the earliest surviving Chinese historical texts to be arranged on [[annals|annalistic]] principles.  It is believed to be compiled by [[Confucius]].

The ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', attributed to [[Zuo Qiuming]] in the 5th century BC, is the earliest Chinese work of narrative history and covers the period from 722 BCE to 468 BCE.

''[[Zhan Guo Ce]]'' was a renowned ancient Chinese historical work and compilation of sporadic materials on the Warring States Period compiled between 3rd century to 1st century BCE.  Its author is unknown.

The first systematic Chinese historical text, ''[[Shiji]]'' or ''Records of the Grand Historian'', was written by [[Sima Qian]].  The book covers the period from the time of the Yellow Emperor until the author's own time.  Due to his highly praised work, Sima Qian is often regarded as the father of Chinese historiography.

''Records of the Grand Historian'' is the first among [[Twenty-Four Histories]], a collection of Chinese historical books covering a period of history from 3000 BCE to the [[Ming Dynasty]] in the 17th century.

''[[Shitong]]'' is the first Chinese work about historiography compiled by [[Liu Zhiji]] between 708 and 710. The book describes the general pattern of the past official dynastic historiography on structure, method, order of arrangement, sequence, caption and commentary back to the pre-Qin era.

''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', literally &quot;Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government&quot;, was a pioneering reference work in Chinese historiography. [[Emperor Yingzong of Song]] ordered [[Sima Guang]] and other scholars to begin compiling this universal history of China in 1065 and they presented it to his successor [[Emperor Shenzong of Song]] in 1084. It contains 294 volumes and about 3 million words (or Chinese characters). The book chronologically narrates the history of China from the Warring States period in 403 BCE to the beginning of the Song Dynasty in 959 CE.

''Zizhi Tongjian'' changed a tradition dating back almost 1,000 years to the Shiji; standard Chinese dynastic histories (collectively the Twenty-Four Histories) primarily divided chapters between annals (紀) of rulers and biographies (傳) of officials. In Chinese terms, the book changed the format of histories from biographical style (紀傳體) to chronological style (編年體), which is better suited for analysis and criticism.

As a tradition, rulers initiating new dynasties would order the scholars of the previous dynasty to compile its final history.

==Narratives and Interpretations of Chinese history==
===Dynastic Cycle===
China's traditionalist view of history sees the [[dynastic cycle|rise and fall of dynasties]] as passing the &quot;[[Mandate of Heaven]]&quot;.  In this view, a new dynasty is founded by a moral uprighteous founder.  Over time, the dynasty becomes morally corrupt and dissolute.  The immorality of the dynasty is reflected in natural disasters, rebellions, and foreign invasions.  Eventually, the dynasty becomes so weak as to allow its replacement by a new dynasty.  This theory became popular during the [[Zhou dynasty]].  It is not entirely cyclical because it claims the [[golden age]] has passed and history is gradually descending towards decadence.  

This theory also claims there can be only one rightful sovereign ruling [[all under heaven]] at a time but throughout Chinese history there have been many contentious and long periods of disunity where the question of legitimacy is moot; ''see also [[Imperial Seal of China]]''.  In fact, less than a third of China's history was the country under the rule of a single state.  Another problem arises if the dynasty falls even if it was virtuous.  The last ruler of a dynasty is always castigated as evil even if that was not the case.  The greatest weakness was the end of the cycle itself with the birth of the [[Republic of China]].  Notions of the Mandate of Heaven and divine [[monarchy]] were discarded, as shown in two unpopular and failed attempts to restore the imperial system by [[Yuan Shikai]] and [[Zhang Xun (Republic of China)|Zhang Xun]].

===Marxist Interpretations of Chinese history===
Most Chinese history that is published in the [[People's Republic of China]] is based on a [[Marxist historiography|Marxist interpretation of history]].
The Marxist view of history is that history is governed by universal laws and that according to these laws, a society moves through a series of stages with the transition between stages being driven by class struggle.  These stages are

* slave society
* feudal society
* capitalist society
* socialist society
* world communist society

The official historical view within the People's Republic of China associates each of
these stages with a particular era in Chinese history as well as making some subdivisions.

* slave society - [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] to [[Shang dynasty|Shang]]
* feudal society - decentralized feudalism - [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] to [[Sui dynasty|Sui]]
* feudal society - bureaucratic feudalism - [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] to [[Opium War]]
* feudal society - semicolonial era - Opium War to end of [[Qing dynasty]]
* capitalist society - [[History of the Republic of China|Republican era]]
* socialist society - [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] 1949 to ???
* socialist society - primary stage of socialism - 1978 to 2050 (?)
* world communist society - ?

Because of the strength of the [[Communist Party of China]] and the importance of the Marxist interpretation of history in legitimizing its rule, it is difficult for historians within the PRC to actively argue in favor of non-Marxist and anti-Marxist interpretations of history.  However, this political restriction is less confining than it may first appear in that the Marxist historical framework is surprisingly flexible, and a rather simple matter to modify an alternative historical theory to use language that at least does not challenge the Marxist interpretation of history.  

There are several problems associated with Marxist interpretation.  First, slavery existed throughout China's history and has never been the primary mode of production.  While the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] can be labelled as [[feudalism|feudal]], others were centralized states.  To account for the discrepancy, Chinese Marxists invented the term &quot;bureaucratic feudalism&quot;, which is an oxymoron.  The placement of the Tang as the beginning of the bureaucratic phase rests largely on the [[imperial examination]] system which finally overcame the [[nine-rank system]]; prior to this both systems were in use.  Some [[World systems theory|World-systems analysts]] contend capitalism first arose in [[Song dynasty]] China by following [[Kondratiev waves]] to their source.

There has been a gradual relaxation of Marxist interpretation from the 1980s onwards, which was accelerated after the [[Tiananmen Square protest of 1989]] and [[Revolutions of 1989]] have damaged Marxism's ideological legitimacy in the eyes of Chinese people.  In general, the modern scholarship emphasizes nationalism in the context of a Third World oppressed nation seeking modernization, mixed with a focus on present-life lite form of Confucian perspective.  The traditional Confucian or Taoist concept of mandate of Heaven is still considered taboo due to the still official Communist atheistic ideology.  Orthodox Marxist perspectives in historical researches are very rarely encountered in China these days apart from retired elderly Marxist historians.

===Three Stages of Revolution===
The [[Kuomintang]] issued their own theory of political stages based on [[Sun Yatsen]]'s proposal though it is limited only to recent history.

* military unification - 1923 to 1928 ([[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]])
* political tutelage - 1928 to 1947
* constitutional democracy - 1947 onward ([[Constitution of the Republic of China]])

The most obvious criticism is the near identical nature of &quot;political tutelage&quot; and &quot;constitutional democracy&quot; which consisted of one party rule until the 1990s.  [[Chen Shui-bian]] proposed his own [[Four-Stage Theory of the Republic of China]].

===Ethnic Inclusiveness===
Also sponsored by the PRC is the view that Chinese history should include all of China's ethnic groups past and present ([[Zhonghua Minzu]]), not just the history of the [[Han Chinese]].  China (including its internal vassals/tributaries) is viewed as a coherent state formed since [[time immemorial]] and exists as one legal entity even in periods of political disunity.   

The benefit of this theory is to show the contributions of non-Han to Chinese history. It allows once &quot;foreign&quot; dynasties like the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and the Manchu [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] as well as the Khitan [[Liao dynasty|Liao]], Jurchen [[Jin Dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] to be appreciated as part of the Chinese tapestry, allegedly helping reduce the alienation of ethnic minorities living in China. This theory also avoids &quot;Han centered&quot; analyses. For example, it denies [[Yue Fei]], a &quot;Han Chinese&quot; who fought for China against the Jurchens, a place as a &quot;hero of China&quot;.

Support for the inclusion of ethnic minorities' history in China's own history varies in accordance with separatist and nationalist politics. For example, the [[14th Dalai Lama]], long insistent on Tibet's history being separate from that of China's, conceded in 2005 that Tibet &quot;is a part&quot; of China's &quot;5000-year history&quot; as part of a new proposal for Tibetan autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Tibet-part-of-China-Dalai-Lama-agrees/2005/03/14/1110649129309.html|title=Tibet part of China, Dalai Lama agrees|first=Hamish|last=McDonald|date=2005-03-15|accessdate=2010-11-05|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; China's historical claims on [[Taiwan]] are denied by supporters of [[Taiwan independence]].{{fact|date=November 2010}} [[Korean nationalism|Korean nationalists]] have virulently reacted against China's application to [[UNESCO]] of [[Goguryeo tombs]] in Chinese territory: the absolute independence of [[Goguryeo]] is a central aspect of Korean identity, because according to Korean legend, it was comparatively independent from China and Japan, in contrast to subordinate states like the [[Joseon Dynasty]] and the [[Korean Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ou.edu/uschina/gries/articles/texts/Gries2005KoguryoEAIQ.pdf|title=The Koguryo Controversy, National Identity, and Sino-Korean Relations Today|author=Gries, Peter Hays|pages=3–17|year=2005|month=Winter|volume=22|number=4|journal=East Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The legacy of [[Genghis Khan]] has been contested between China, Mongolia, and Russia, all three states having significant numbers of ethnic [[Mongol]]s within their borders, and holding territory that was conquered by Khan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav111109.shtml|title=The Search for Genghis Khan: Genghis Khan's Lecay Being Reappraised in China, Russia|date=2009-08-10|accessdate=2010-11-05|publisher=EurasiaNet|first=Joshua|last=Kucera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese tradition since the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] (3rd century AD) that emperors of one dynasty would sponsor the writing of the official history of the immediately preceding dynasty has been cited in favor of an ethnically inclusive interpretation of history. The compilation of official histories usually involved monumental intellectual labor. The Yuan and Qing Dynasties, which might be thought &quot;foreign&quot; as their imperial families were not of the Han people, faithfully carried out the tradition, writing the official histories of Han-ruled Song and Ming Dynasties respectively.  Had the two &quot;non-Han&quot; imperial families not thought themselves as continuing the &quot;Mandate of Heaven&quot; of the Middle Kingdom—the cosmological center of their known world—it would be hard to explain why they retained the costly tradition. Thus, every non-Han dynasty saw itself as the legitimate holder of the &quot;Mandate of Heaven&quot;, which legitimized the dynastic cycle regardless of social or ethnic background as it was moral integrity and benevolent leadership that had been validating the &quot;Mandate of Heaven.&quot; By assuming the mantle of the legitimate dynasty, the ethnic groups that established such non-Han dynasties are thus regarded as having forfeited their right to remain politically distinct from China.

The ethnic inclusiveness theory is not limited to the PRC alone.  The [[Tongmenghui]] initially regarded the Manchus as non-Chinese occupiers.  They quickly realized that ethnic inclusiveness was needed if the new republic was to maintain control over the territories bequeathed by the Qing dynasty.  &quot;Han independence&quot; was therefore scrapped in favor of the [[Five Races Under One Union]] principle, which later developed into the theory of ''Zhonghua minzu''.  The [[Republic of China]] regime on [[Taiwan]] continues to claim a much larger territory encompassing Mongolia and [[Tannu Uriankhai]].

===Anti-Imperialist Narratives===
Closely related are anti-imperialist narratives.  While some
anti-imperialist narratives notably those of historians 
within the People's Republic of China as well as Western Marxist histories incorporate anti-imperialist narratives in their histories, many anti-imperialist narratives are non-Marxist or as in the case of the [[Kuomintang]] in the 1960s, actively anti-Marxist.

===Modernist Interpretations of Chinese history===
This view of Chinese history sees Chinese society in the 20th century as a traditional society seeking to become modern, usually with the implicit
assumption that Western society is the definition of modern society.

This view of Chinese history has its roots with British views of the orient 
of the early 19th century.  In this viewpoint, the societies of India, China,
and the Middle East were societies with glorious pasts but that they have
become trapped in a static past (''see'' [[Orientalism]]).  This view provided an implicit justification
of British colonialism with Britain assuming the &quot;white man's burden&quot; of
breaking these societies from their static past and bringing them into the
modern world.

By the mid 20th century, it was increasingly clear to historians that the
notion of &quot;changeless China&quot; was untenable.  A new concept, popularized by
[[John Fairbank]] was the notion of &quot;change within tradition&quot; which argued
that although China did change in the pre-modern period but that this change
existed within certain cultural traditions.

There are a number of criticisms of the modernist critique.  One centers
on the definition of &quot;traditional society.&quot;  The criticism is that the
idea of &quot;traditional society&quot; is simply a catch all term for early non-Western  
society and implies that all such societies are similar.  To use an analogy,
one could classify all animals into &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;non-fish&quot; but that classification would be hardly useful, and would imply that spiders are similar to mountain goats.

The notion of &quot;change within tradition&quot; also been subject to criticism.  The criticism is that the statement that &quot;China has not changed fundamentally&quot; is tautological, that one looks for things that have not changed and then define those as fundamental.  The trouble with doing this is that when one can do
this with anything that has lasted for an extended period of time resulting
in absurd statements such as &quot;England has not changed fundamentally in the 
past thousand years because the institution of the monarchy has existed
for this long.&quot;

In the opposite vein, [[Naito Torajiro]] argued that China reached &quot;modernity&quot; during its [[Mid-Imperial China|mid-Imperial period]], centuries before Europe.  He believed that the reform of the civil service into a meritocratic system and the disappearance of the ancient [[Chinese nobility]] from the bureaucracy constituted a modern society.  As noted above, some world-systems analysts such as [[Janet Abu-Lughod]] thought China invented capitalism during this period with the rise of a monied economy and the invention of paper currency.

The problems associated with this approach is the subjective use of &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;capitalist&quot;.  The old nobility had been in decline since the Qin dynasty.  While the exams were meritocratic, most examinees were of the [[Chinese gentry|gentry]] background.  Expertise in the [[Confucian classics]] did not guarantee competent bureaucrats who could manage public works or prepare a budget.  The early capitalists theory is also unsound in that merchants were at the bottom of the [[four occupations]] due to Confucianism's hostility to commerce.  The social goal was to invest in land and enter the gentry, ideas more similar to the [[physiocrats]] than that of [[Adam Smith]].

===Hydraulic Theory===
Derived from Marx and [[Max Weber]], [[Karl August Wittfogel]] argued that bureaucracy arose to manage irrigation systems.  Despotism was needed to force the people into building canals, dikes, and waterways to increase agriculture.  [[Yu the Great]], one of China's legendary founders, is mostly known for his control of the flood.  The [[hydraulic empire]] produces wealth from its stability and while dynasties may change, the structure remains intact until destroyed by modern powers.

Critics of Wittfogel's oriental despotism theory point out that water management was not a high priority when compared to taxes, rituals, and fighting off bandits.  The theory also has a strong [[oriental studies|orientalist]] bent which regards all Asian states as generally the same.

===Convergence Theory===
Convergence theory is a broad term which includes a viewpoint popular among non-Marxist Chinese intellectuals of the mid 20th century.  This includes 
[[Hu Shih]] and [[Ray Huang]]'s involution theory.  This view was that the past 150
years was a period in which Chinese and Western civilization were in the
process of convergence into a world civilization.  

This view is heavily influenced by [[modernization theory]], but is also strongly influenced by indigenous sources such as the notion of &quot;shijie datong&quot; or
the Great Unity.  It has tended to be less popular among more recent historians.  Among Western historians, it conflicts with the postmodern impulse which is skeptical of great narratives.  Among Chinese historians, convergence theory is in conflict with Chinese nationalism which includes a strong element of China as being unique.

===European conflict interpretations of Chinese history===
European conflict interpretations focus on interaction with Europe as the 
driving force behind recent Chinese history.  There are two variants, one focuses on Europe as the driving force behind China's quest for modernity, the other focuses on the effects of European colonialism.

One criticism of this view is that it ignores historical forces that do not involve Europe, such as indigenous economic forces.  One example of a blind
spot which is provided by this viewpoint is the influence of central Asian
policies on interactions with Europe in the [[Qing dynasty]].

===Post-modern interpretations of Chinese history===
Post-modern interpretations of Chinese history tend to reject the grand narratives of
other interpretations of history.  Instead of seeking a grand pattern of history, post-modern interpretations tend to focus on a small subset of Chinese history.

In attention rather than focusing on the political elites of China, post-modern historians look also at the daily lives of ordinary people.

==Issues in the study of Chinese history==
===Recent trends in Chinese historical scholarship===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
The late 20th century and early 21st century has seen a large number of studies of Chinese history that seek to challenge traditional paradigms.  The field is rapidly evolving, with much new scholarship.  Much of this new scholarship comes from the realization that there is much about Chinese history that is unknown or controversial.  To give one such controversy, it is an active topic of discussion whether the typical Chinese peasant in 1900 was seeing his life improve or decline.  In addition to the realization that there are major gaps in our knowledge of Chinese history is the equal realization that there are tremendous quantities of primary source material that have not yet been analyzed.

Recent Western scholarship of China has been heavily influenced by [[postmodernism]].  For example, current scholars of China tend to question the question, and look heavily at the assumptions within a question before attempting to answer it.  For example, one begins to answer the question &quot;Why did China not develop modern science and capitalism?&quot; by asking the question &quot;Why are we assuming that what China did develop was not modern science and capitalism?&quot;  This then brings up the question of what are the essential characteristics of modern science and capitalism, and whether it makes any sense at all to apply European concepts to Chinese history.

One example of the fruitfulness of questioning assumptions comes from questioning the assumption that &quot;China was weak in the 19th century&quot; and pointing out the fact that at the time in which China was supposedly weak, it managed to considerably extend its borders in [[Central Asia]].  This in turn has caused scholars to be more interested in Chinese policies and actions in Central Asia and has led to the realization that Central Asia affected Chinese policies toward Europe in a deep way.

Another trend in Western scholarship of China has been to move away from &quot;grand theories&quot; of history, toward an understanding of a narrow part of China.  A survey of papers on Chinese history in the early 21st century would reveal relatively little attempt to fit Chinese history into a master paradigm of history as was common in the 1950s.  Instead, early 21st century papers on Chinese history tend to be empirical studies of a small part of China which aim to reach a deep understanding of the socio-economics, politicaldynamics, or cultural dynamics of a small region such as a province or a village with little effort made to create a master narrative which would be generalizable to all of China.

Also, such current scholars attempt to assess source material more critically.  For example, for a long period it was assumed that Imperial China had no system of [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] because the law codes did not have explicit provisions for civil lawsuits.  However, more recent studies which use the records of civil magistrates suggest that China did in fact have a very well developed system of civil law, in which provisions of the criminal code were interpreted to allow civil causes of action.  Another example of the more critical view taken toward source material has been anti-merchant statements made by intellectuals in the mid-Qing dynasty.  Traditionally these have been interpreted as examples of government hostility toward commerce, but more recent studies, which use source material such as magistrate diaries and genealogical records, suggest that merchants in fact had a powerful impact on government policies and that the division between the world of the merchant and the world of the official was far more porous than traditionally believed.  In fact, there is a growing consensus that anti-merchant statements in the mid-Qing dynasty should be taken as evidence of a substantial erosion in the power and freedom of action of officials. 

Finally, current scholars have taken an increasing interest in the lives of common people and tapped documentary and historical evidence that was previously not analyzed.  Examples of these records include a large mass of governmental and family archives which have not yet been processed, economic records such as census records, price records, land surveys, and tax records.  In addition there are large numbers of cultural artifacts such as vernacular novels, how-to books, and children's books, which are in the process of being analyzed for clues as to how the average Chinese (if there was such as thing) lived.

In contrast, just as [[postmodernism]] has so far failed to take root in ethnic Chinese circles as opposed to a general sense of [[Chinese nationalist]] [[moral certainty]], much of ethnic Chinese scholarship of Chinese history remains largely modernist or even outright traditionalist in outlook. The legacies of the modernist school, such as historian [[Lo Hsiang-lin]] (1906–1978) and the traditionalist school, as represented by historian [[Chien Mu]] (1895–1990) remain strong in Chinese circles.  The more modernist works focus on imperial systems in China and employ scientific method to analyze epochs of Chinese dynasties from geographical, genealogical, and cultural artifacts, for example, from Carbon-14 dating and geographical records to correlate climates with cycles of calm and calamity in Chinese history.  The traditionalist school of scholarship resorts to official imperial records and colloquial history works and analyzes the different dynasties' rises and falls using a Confucian philosophy, albeit modified by an institutional administration perspective.  

From the beginning of Communist rule in 1949, until the 1980s, when China was in the early years of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reform]], the focus was largely on peasant life, as interpreted via the officially sanctioned Marxist theory of class struggle.  From the time of [[Deng Xiaoping]] onwards, there has been a drift of focus towards a Marxist-inspired, moderated by Conficianism, nationalist perspective, and consideration of China's contemporary international status became of paramount importance in historical studies.  The current focus tends to be on specifics of civilization in ancient China, and the general paradigm of how China has responded to the dual challenges of interactions with the outside world and modernization in the post-1700 era. Long abandoned as a research focus among most Western scholars due to postmodernism's influence, it remains the primary interest for most historians inside China.

The '''Communist Party of China''' ('''CPC'''), also known as the '''Chinese Communist Party''' ('''CCP'''), is the founding and [[Ruling party|ruling]] political party of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). Although nominally it exists alongside the [[United Front (PRC)|United Front]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcx.sagepub.com/cgi/rapidpdf/0097700409347982v1.pdf New Approaches to the Study of Political Order in China], by Donald Clarke, Modern China, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; in practice, the CPC is also the [[single-party state|only party]] of the PRC,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cdecon&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last = Goodman | first = David S.

The party was founded on July 1, 1921 in [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CT&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |last = |first = |authorlink = |coauthors = |title = China Information: The Communist Party of China (CPC)|work=[[China Today]] |location= |date = |url = http://www.chinatoday.com/org/cpc/ |format = |doi = |accessdate = October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a lengthy [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]], the party defeated its primary rival, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), and expanded into all of [[mainland China]] by 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;gk&quot;&gt;Gay, Kathlyn.

The party has fluctuated between periods of reform and political conservatism throughout its history.

The CPC is the world's largest [[political party]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/publication/14482/communist_party_of_china.html The Communist Party of China]&lt;/ref&gt; claiming nearly 78&amp;nbsp;million members&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-06/28/c_13372960.htm China's communist party members near 78 mln]&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of 2009 which constitutes about 5.6% of the total population of mainland China.

==Organization==
{{Ref improve section|date=January 2010}}
The party's organizational structure was destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]] and rebuilt afterwards by [[Deng Xiaoping]], who subsequently initiated &quot;[[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]]&quot; and brought all state apparatuses back under the rule of the CPC.

Theoretically, the party's highest body is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China]], which meets at least once every five years. The primary organization of power in the Communist Party which is detailed in the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|party constitution]] include:

* [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], which includes:
** The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], which is the highest ranking official within the Party and usually the Chinese [[Paramount leader]].
** The [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], consisting of 24 full members (including the members of the Politburo Standing Committee) and one alternate; see [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China#Current Members|current members of the Politburo]] for a complete list.
** The [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], which currently consists of nine members; see [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China#Current members|current members of the Politburo Standing Committee]] for a complete list.
** The [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|Secretariat]], the principal administrative mechanism of the CPC, headed by the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Central Committee]];
** The [[Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China|Central Military Commission]] (a parallel organization of the government institution of the same name);
* The [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China|Central Discipline Inspection Commission]], which is directly under the National Congress and on the same level with the Central Committee, charged with rooting out [[Political corruption|corruption]] and malfeasance among party cadres.

Other central organizations include:
* General Office&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/english/2006/Mar/161216.htm Images of GO CPC in Session]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Organization Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|Central Organization Department]];
* [[Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|Propaganda Department]]
* International Liaison Department; and
* [[United Front (China)|United Front]] Department
In addition, there are numerous commissions and leading groups, the most important of which are:
* [[Political and Legislative Affairs Committee of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|Central Political and Legislative Affairs Committee]]
* Work Committee for Organs under the Central Committee
* Work Committee for Central Government Organs
* Central Financial and Economic Leading Group
* Central Leading Group for Rural Work
* Central Leading Group for Party Building
* Central Foreign Affairs Leading Group
* Central Taiwan Affairs Leading Group
* Commission for Protection of Party Secrets
* Leading Group for State Security
* Party History Research Centre
* Party Research Centre
* [[Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Party School]]

Every five years, the Communist Party of China holds a National Congress. The latest happened on October 19, 2005. Formally, the Congress serves two functions: to approve changes to the Party constitution regarding policy and to elect a [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], about 300 strong. The Central Committee in turn elects the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]]. In practice, positions within the Central Committee and Politburo are determined before a Party Congress, and the main purpose of the Congress is to announce the party policies and vision for the direction of China in the following few years.

The party's central focus of power is the Politburo Standing Committee. The process for selecting Standing Committee members, as well as Politburo members, occurs behind the scenes in a process parallel to the National Congress. The new power structure is announced obliquely through the positioning of portraits in the ''[[People's Daily]]'', the official newspaper of the Party. The number of Standing Committee members varies and has tended to increase over time. The Committee was expanded to nine at the 16th Party National Congress in 2009.

There are two other key organs of political power in the People's Republic of China: the formal government and the [[People's Liberation Army]].

There are, in addition to decision-making roles, advisory committees, including the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]]. During the 1980s and 1990s there was a [[Central Advisory Commission]] established by [[Deng Xiaoping]] which consisted of senior retired leaders, but with their passing this has been abolished since 1990.

===Factions===
[[Image:Flag of the Chinese Communist Party.svg|200px|thumb|left|The flag of the Communist Party of China]]
Political scientists have identified two groupings within the Communist Party&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicagosociety.uchicago.edu/china/coverage/PoliticsPanel.pdf Uchicago.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;
leading to a structure which has been called &quot;one party, two [[Political faction|factions]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chinavitae.com/reference/conferencepapers/Li_Cheng.pdf Chinavitae.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The first is the &quot;elitist coalition&quot; or ''[[Shanghai clique]]'' which contains mainly officials who have risen from the more prosperous provinces. The second is the &quot;populist coalition&quot;, the core of which are the ''[[tuanpai]]'', or the &quot;Youth League faction&quot; which consists mainly of officials who have risen from the rural interior, through the [[Communist Youth League]]. Minor informal groupings include the reformist [[Qinghua clique]], and the derogatorily-termed [[Crown Prince Party]] of officials benefiting from [[nepotism]]. The interaction between the two main factions is largely complementary with each faction possessing a particular expertise and both committed to the continued rule of the Communist Party and not allowing intra-party factional politics threaten party unity. It has been noted that party and government positions have been assigned to create a very careful balance between these two groupings.

Within his &quot;one party, two factions&quot; model, Li Chen has noted that one should avoid labelling these two groupings with simplistic ideological labels, and that these two groupings do not act in a zero-sum, winner take all fashion. Neither group has the ability or will to dominate the other completely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/news_details.php?news_id=210 The Jamestown Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership===
The party was small at first, but grew intermittently through the 1920s. Twelve voting delegates were seated at the 1st [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|National Congress]] in 1921, as well as at the 2nd (in 1922), when they represented 195 party members. By 1923, the 420 members were represented by 30 delegates. The 1925 4th Congress had 20 delegates representing 994 members; then real growth kicked in. The 5th Congress (held in April–May 1927 as the [[KMT]] was cracking down on communists) comprised 80 voting delegates representing 57,968 members.

It was on October 3, 1928 6th Congress that the now-familiar ‘full’ and ‘alternate’ structure originated, with 84 and 34 delegates, respectively. Membership was estimated at 40,000. In 1945, the 7th Congress had 547 full and 208 alternate delegates representing 1.21&amp;nbsp;million members, a ratio of one representative per 1,600 members as compared to 1:725 in 1927.

After the Party defeated the Nationalists, participation at National Party Congresses became much less representative. Each of the 1026 full and 107 alternate members represented 9,470 party members (10.73&amp;nbsp;million in total) at the 1956 8th Congress. Subsequent congresses held the number of participants down despite membership growing to more than 60&amp;nbsp;million by 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cpcnews.cn/92277/6277861.html Press centre of the 17th CPC National Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of the Communist Party of China}}
The CPC has its origins in the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919, where radical political systems like [[Anarchism in China|anarchism]] and Communism gained traction among Chinese intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchism in the Chinese Revolution|first=Arif|last=Dirlik|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1993|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin opposed the Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang because he wanted to expand Soviet influence in the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=warlords+and+muslims&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KzhMe1dpqU&amp;sig=YUq2zwbyUFNCsO5Jnt2RTAKL0rc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SdobTNyIEYO8lQfuvYm1Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=fascist%20trotskyite%20plotters&amp;f=false|title=Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: a political history of Republican Sinkiang 1911-1949|author=Andrew D. W. Forbes|year=1986|publisher=CUP Archive|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0521255147|pages=151|pages=376|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPC's ideologies have significantly evolved since its founding and establishing political power in 1949. Mao's revolution that founded the PRC was nominally based on [[Marxism-Leninism]] with a rural focus based on China's social situations at the time. During the 1960s and 1970s, the CPC experienced a significant [[Sino-Soviet split|ideological breakdown]] with the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], and later, [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. Since then Mao's peasant revolutionary vision and so-called &quot;continued revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; stipulated that class enemies continued to exist even though the socialist revolution seemed to be complete, giving way to the ''[[Cultural Revolution]]''. This fusion of ideas became known officially as &quot;[[Maoism|Mao Zedong Thought]]&quot;, or Maoism outside of China. It represented a powerful branch of communism that existed in opposition to the [[Soviet Union]]'s &quot;[[Marxist revisionism]]&quot;.

Following the death of [[Mao Zedong]] in 1976, however, the CPC under the leadership of [[Deng Xiaoping]] moved towards ''[[Socialist market economy|Socialism with Chinese characteristics]]'' and instituted [[Chinese economic reform]]. In reversing some of Mao's &quot;extreme-leftist&quot; policies, Deng argued that a socialist country and the [[market economy]] model were not mutually exclusive. While asserting the political power of the Party itself, the change in policy generated significant economic growth. The ideology itself, however, came into conflict on both sides of the spectrum with Maoists as well as progressive liberals, culminating with other social factors to cause the [[1989 Tiananmen Square Protests]]. Deng's vision for economic success and a new socialist market model became entrenched in the Party constitution in 1997 as ''[[Deng Xiaoping Theory]]''.

The &quot;third generation&quot; of leadership under [[Jiang Zemin]], [[Zhu Rongji]], and associates largely continued Deng's progressive economic vision while overseeing the re-emergence of [[Chinese nationalism]] in the 1990s. Nationalist sentiment has seemingly also evolved to become informally the part of the Party's guiding doctrine. As part of Jiang's nominal legacy, the CPC ratified the ''[[Three Represents]]'' into the 2003 revision of the Party Constitution as a &quot;guiding ideology&quot;, encouraging the Party to represent &quot;advanced productive forces, the progressive course of China's culture, and the fundamental interests of the people.&quot; There are various interpretations of the ''Three Represents''. Most notably, the theory has legitimized the entry of private business owners and quasi-&quot;[[bourgeoisie]]&quot; elements into the party.

The insistent road of focusing almost exclusively on economic growth has led to a [[Social issues in the People's Republic of China|wide range of serious social problems]]. The CPC's &quot;fourth generation&quot; of leadership under [[Hu Jintao]] and [[Wen Jiabao]], after taking power in 2003, attempted reversing such a trend by bringing forth an integrated ideology that tackled both social and economic concerns. This new ideology was known as the creation of a [[Harmonious Society]] using the [[Scientific Development Concept]].

The degree of power the Party had on the state has gradually decreased as economic liberalizations progressed. The evolution of CPC ideology has gone through a number of defining changes that it no longer bears much resemblance to its founding principles. Some believe that the large amount of economic liberalization starting from the late 1970s to present, indicates that the CPC has transitioned to endorse economic [[neoliberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David. 2005.

Pp. 99 &quot;...influence of neoliberalism has spread rapidly in China&quot;, &quot;...neoliberalism had influenced not only college students but also economists and leading party cadres&quot;...&lt;/ref&gt; The CPC's current policies are fiercely rejected as [[capitalism|capitalist]] by most communists, especially [[anti-revisionist]]s, and by adherents of the [[Chinese New Left]] from within the PRC.

The Communist Party of China comprises a [[single-party state]] form of government; however, there are parties other than the CPC within China, which report to the [[United Front (China)|United Front Department of the Communist Party of China]] and do not act as opposition or independent parties. Since the 1980s, as its commitment to [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideology has appeared to wane, the party has begun to increasingly invoke [[Chinese nationalism]] as a legitimizing principle as opposed to the [[socialist]] construction for which the party was originally created.  The change from [[socialism]] to [[nationalism]] has pleased the CPC's former enemy, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), which has warmed its relations with the CPC since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;See [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political ideology and stances ==
=== Regional corruption and reform ===
The leaders of the Communist Party of China are aware that there are serious problems with political corruption within China and with maintaining the trust of the Chinese people because of it. However, attempts made in closed-door sessions at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 17th Communist Party of China's Central Committee in September 2009 to grapple with these problems produced inconclusive results, although a directive which requires disclosure of investments and property holdings by party and governmental officials was passed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/21/world/asia/21china.html &quot;Party’s Agenda in China Seems to Fall Flat&quot;] article by Michael Wines in ''[[The New York Times]]'' September 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with competing ideologies ===
{{Ref improve section|date=January 2010}}
{{POV-section|date=October 2010}}

[[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] argue that the party was doomed to its present character, that of petty-bourgeois nationalism in the 1920s, because of the near-annihilation of the workers' movement in the KMT betrayal of 1927, which was made possible by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] order that the Communists join with the KMT in a centrist coalition, effectively disarming it, which opportunity the KMT swiftly exploited to defeat the communist revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wsws.org/articles/2009/jan2009/lec3-j07.shtml ''The tragedy of the 1925-1927 Chinese Revolution: Part 3'' Article at a Trotskyist groupings website.]&lt;/ref&gt; This slaughter forced the tiny surviving Party to switch from a workers' union- to a peasant, guerilla-based organization, and to seek the aid of the most heterodox sources: from &quot;patriotic capitalists&quot; to the dreaded KMT itself, with which it openly sought to participate in a coalition government, even after the Japanese general surrender in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wsws.org/articles/2005/nov2005/chin-n29.shtml ''The death of China’s “red capitalist” and the 1949 revolution'' Article at a Trotskist groupings website.]&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese Trotskyists from [[Chen Duxiu]] onward have called for a [[political revolution]] against what they see as an opportunist, capitalist leadership of the CPC.

[[Marxist]]s also existed in the [[Kuomintang]] party. They viewed the Chinese revolution in different terms than the Communists, claiming that China already went past its feudal stage and in a stagnation period rather than in another mode of production. These Marxists in the Kuomintang opposed the Chinese communist party ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=usOMZjTWrJ0C&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=china+stagnated+feudalism+political&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AvO4TPjFE4T6lwfa5oWwDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=guomindang%20marxists&amp;f=false|title=Feudalism and non-European societies|author=T. J. Byres, Harbans Mukhia|year=1985|publisher=Psychology Press|location=|page=207|isbn=0714632457|pages=|accessdate=November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maoists]] and other '[[anti-revisionist]]s' viciously attack [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|the changes]] after [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, calling them the precise &quot;capitalist road&quot; Mao had pledged to fight during the early existence of the PRC. They do not hold any allegiance to the CPC. An example of a well-known group, until recently [[armed struggle|armed]], that looks to Mao's principles is the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] who the current CPC has publicly opposed. Also, some Maoist groupings attack even some of the shifts and changes that occurred while Mao was still alive and in leadership, like his 1972 welcoming of [[Richard Nixon]] (see ''[[lesser evil]]'' for more on this event). The [[Chinese New Left]], which encompasses these Maoists and other [[postmodernists]] is a current within China that seeks to &quot;revert China to the [[socialist]] road&quot; – i.e., to return China to the socialist system that existed before Deng Xiaoping's reforms.

Some of the opponents of the Party within the [[Chinese democracy movement]] have tended not to argue that a strong Chinese state is inherently bad, but rather that the Communist leadership is corrupt. The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] represented a controversial point in criticism of the Chinese Communist Party by Chinese students within China.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, L., Nathan, A. J., Link, P. &amp; Schell O. The Tiananmen Papers: The Chinese Leadership's Decision to Use Force Against Their Own People – In Their Own Words. PublicAffairs, 2002. ISBN 978-1586481223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another school of thought argues that the worst of the abuses took place decades ago, and that the current leaders were not only unconnected with them, but were actually victims of that era. They have also argued that, while the modern Communist Party may be flawed, it is comparatively better than previous regimes, with respect to improving the general standard of living, than any other government that has governed China in the past century and can be seen in a more favourable light compared with most governments of the [[developing nation]]s. As a result, the CPC has recently taken sweeping measures to regain support from the countryside, with limited success.

In addition, some scholars contend that China has never operated under a decentralized democratic regime in its several thousand years of history, and therefore it can be argued that the present political structure, albeit not up to [[Western world|Western]] moral or political standards, is the best possible option when compared to the alternatives. A sudden transition to [[democracy]], these experts contend, would result in the economic and political upheaval that occurred in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1990s, and that by focusing on economic growth, China is setting the stage for a more gradual but sustainable transition to a more politically liberal system. This group sees mainland China as being similar to Franco's [[Spain]] in the 1960s, and [[South Korea]] during the 1970s when South Korea was run by corrupt, authoritarian regimes. This school of thought also brings together some unlikely political allies. Not only do most intellectuals within the Chinese government follow this school of thinking, but it is also the common belief held amongst pro-[[free trade]] liberals in the West.

Many observers from both within and outside of China have argued that the CPC has taken gradual steps towards democracy and transparency, hence arguing that it is best to give it time and room to evolve into a better government that is more responsive to its people rather than forcing an abrupt change with all the deleterious effects such a loss of stability might entail.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Dali. Remaking the Chinese Leviathan. [[Stanford University Press]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other observers (like [[Minxin Pei]]) question whether these steps are genuine efforts towards democratic reform or disingenuous measures by the CPC to retain power.&lt;ref&gt;An, Alex and An, David, ''China Brief'', October 7, 2008.

In [[physics]], '''cryogenics''' is the study of the production of very low  [[temperature]] (below −150 °C, −238 °F or 123 K) and the behavior of materials at those temperatures. A person who studies elements under extremely cold temperature is called a cryogenicist. Rather than the relative temperature scales of [[Celsius]] and [[Fahrenheit]], cryogenicists use the absolute temperature scales.  These are [[Kelvin]] (SI units) or [[Rankine scale]] (Imperial &amp; US units).

== Definitions and distinctions ==
The terms ''cryogenics'', ''cryobiology'', or ''cryonics'' are frequently confused. Other new terms with the prefix ''cryo-'' have also been introduced.

; Cryogenics: The branches of physics and engineering that involve the study of very low temperatures, how to produce them, and how materials behave at those temperatures.

; [[Cryobiology]]: The branch of [[biology]] involving the study of the effects of low temperatures on [[organism]]s (most often for the purpose of achieving [[cryopreservation]]).

; [[Cryonics]]: The emerging [[medical technology]] of [[Cryopreservation|cryopreserving]] humans and animals with the intention of future revival. Researchers in the field seek to apply the results of many [[science]]s, including cryobiology, cryogenics, [[rheology]], [[emergency medicine]], etc.

; [[Cryoelectronics]]: The field of research regarding [[superconductivity]] at low temperatures.

; [[Cryotronics]]: The practical application of cryoelectronics.
== Etymology ==

The word ''cryogenics'' stems from [[Greek language|Greek]] and means &quot;the production of freezing cold&quot;; however the term is used today as a [[synonym]] for the low-temperature state. It is not well-defined at what point on the temperature scale [[refrigeration]] ends and cryogenics begins, but most scientists&lt;ref name=&quot;saturn&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Bilstein, Roger E.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; assume it starts at or below -240 [[Fahrenheit|°F]] (about -150 [[Celsius|°C]] or 123 [[Kelvin|K]]). The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] at [[Boulder, Colorado]] has chosen to consider the field of cryogenics as that involving temperatures below −180 °C (93.15 K). This is a logical dividing line, since the normal [[boiling point]]s of the so-called permanent [[gases]] (such as [[helium]], [[hydrogen]], [[neon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and normal [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]) lie below −180 °C while the [[Freon]] refrigerants, [[hydrogen sulfide]], and other common refrigerants have boiling points above −180 °C.

== Industrial application ==
[[Image:Cryogenic carbon steel socket weld globe valve.jpg|70px|right|thumb|Cryogenic valve]]
{{see|Timeline of low-temperature technology}}
[[Liquid air|Liquefied gases]], such as [[liquid nitrogen]] and [[liquid helium]], are used in many cryogenic applications. Liquid nitrogen is the most commonly used element in cryogenics and is legally purchasable around the world. Liquid helium is also commonly used and allows for the lowest attainable temperatures to be reached.

These liquids are held in either special containers known as [[Dewar flask]]s, which are generally about six feet tall (1.8 m) and three feet (91.5&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter, or giant tanks in larger commercial operations.  Dewar flasks are named after their inventor, [[James Dewar]], the man who first liquefied [[hydrogen]].  Museums typically display smaller [[vacuum flask]]s fitted in a protective casing. 

Cryogenic transfer pumps are the pumps used on [[LNG pier]]s to transfer [[Liquefied Natural Gas]] from [[LNG carrier|LNG Carriers]] to [[Storage tank|LNG storage tanks]], as are cryogenic valves.

=== Cryogenic processing ===

The field of cryogenics advanced during World War II when scientists found that metals frozen to low temperatures showed more resistance to wear.  Based on this theory of [[cryogenic hardening]], the commercial [[cryogenic processor|cryogenic processing]] industry was founded in 1966 by Ed Busch. With a background in the [[heat treatment|heat treating]] industry, Busch founded a company in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] called [[CryoTech]] in 1966. Though [[CryoTech]] later merged with [[300 Below]] to create the largest and oldest commercial cryogenics company in the world, they originally experimented with the possibility of increasing the life of metal tools to anywhere between 200%-400% of the original life expectancy using [[cryogenic tempering]] instead of heat treating. This evolved in the late 1990s into the treatment of other parts (that did more than just increase the life of a product) such as amplifier valves (improved sound quality), baseball bats (greater sweet spot), golf clubs (greater sweet spot), racing engines (greater performance under stress), firearms (less warping after continuous shooting), knives, razor blades, brake rotors and even pantyhose. The theory was based on how heat-treating metal works (the temperatures are lowered to room temperature from a high degree causing certain strength increases in the molecular structure to occur) and supposed that continuing the descent would allow for further strength increases. Using liquid nitrogen, CryoTech formulated the first early version of the [[cryogenic processor]]. Unfortunately for the newly born industry, the results were unstable, as components sometimes experienced [[thermal shock]] when they were cooled too quickly. Some components in early tests even shattered because of the ultra-low temperatures. In the late twentieth century, the field improved significantly with the rise of applied research, which coupled microprocessor based industrial controls to the [[cryogenic processor]] in order to create more stable results.

Cryogens, like liquid [[nitrogen]], are further used for specialty chilling and freezing applications.  Some chemical reactions, like those used to produce the active ingredients for the popular [[statin]] drugs, must occur at low temperatures of approximately −100 °C. Special cryogenic [[chemical reactor]]s are used to remove reaction heat and provide a low temperature environment.  The freezing of foods and biotechnology products, like [[vaccine]]s, requires nitrogen in blast freezing or immersion freezing systems. Certain soft or elastic materials become hard and [[brittleness|brittle]] at very low temperatures, which makes cryogenic [[mill (grinding)|milling]] ([[cryomilling]]) an option for some materials that cannot easily be milled at higher temperatures.

Cryogenic processing is not a substitute for heat treatment, but rather an extension of the heating - quenching - tempering cycle. Normally, when an item is quenched, the final temperature is ambient. The only reason for this is that most heat treaters do not have cooling equipment. There is nothing metallurgically significant about ambient temperature. The cryogenic process continues this action from ambient temperature down to {{convert|-320|°F|°R K °C|0}}.
In most instances the cryogenic cycle is followed by a heat tempering procedure. As all alloys do not have the same chemical constituents, the tempering procedure varies according to the material's chemical composition, thermal history and/or a tool's particular service application.

The entire process takes 3–4 days.

=== Fuels ===

Another use of cryogenics is [[cryogenic fuel]]s. Cryogenic fuels, mainly [[liquid hydrogen]], have been used as rocket fuels. [[Liquid oxygen]] is used as an [[Redox|oxidizer]] of hydrogen, but oxygen is not, strictly speaking, a fuel. For example, [[NASA]]'s workhorse [[space shuttle]] uses cryogenic hydrogen fuel as its primary means of getting into [[orbit]], as did all of the rockets built for the [[Soviet space program]] by [[Sergei Korolev]]. (This was a bone of contention between him and rival engine designer [[Valentin Glushko]], who felt that cryogenic fuels were impractical for large-scale rockets such as the ill-fated [[N-1 rocket]] spacecraft.)

Russian aircraft manufacturer [[Tupolev]] developed a version of its popular design [[Tu-154]] with a cryogenic fuel system, known as the [[Tu-155]]. The plane uses a fuel referred to as  [[liquefied natural gas]] or LNG, and made its first flight in 1989.

== Applications ==
Some applications of cryogenics:

* [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI)&lt;br/&gt;MRI is a method of imaging objects that uses a strong magnetic field to detect the relaxation of protons that have been perturbed by a radio-frequency pulse. This magnetic field is generated by electromagnets, and high field strengths can be achieved by using superconducting magnets. Traditionally, liquid helium is used to cool the coils because it has a boiling point of around 4 K at ambient pressure, and cheap metallic superconductors can be used for the coil wiring. So-called high-temperature superconducting compounds can be made to superconduct with the use of liquid nitrogen which boils at around 77 K.

* [[Electric power transmission]] in big cities&lt;br/&gt;It is difficult to transmit power by overhead cables in big cities, so underground cables are used. But underground cables get heated and the resistance of the wire increases leading to wastage of power. This can be solved by cryogenics. Liquefied gases are sprayed on the cables to keep them cool and reduce their resistance.

* [[Frozen food]]&lt;br/&gt;Cryogenic gases are used in transportation of large masses of frozen food. When very large quantities of food must be transported to regions like war fields, earthquake hit regions, etc., they must be stored for a long time. So cryogenic food freezing is used. Cryogenic food freezing is also helpful for large scale food processing industries.

* [[Blood banking]]&lt;br/&gt;Certain blood groups which are rare are stored at very low temperatures such as -165 degrees C.

== Production ==
Cryogenic cooling of devices and material is usually achieved via the use of [[liquid nitrogen]], [[liquid helium]], or a cryocompressor (which uses high pressure helium lines). Newer devices such as [[Pulse tube refrigerator|pulse cryocoolers]] and [[Stirling engine#Stirling cryocoolers|Stirling cryocoolers]] have been devised. The most recent development in cryogenics is the use of magnets as regenerators as well as refrigerators. These devices work on the principle known as the [[Magnetic refrigeration|magnetocaloric]] effect.

== Detectors ==

Cryogenic temperatures, usually well below 77 K (−196 °C) are required to operate [[cryogenic detectors]].

'''Ivan Simon Cary Elwes''' (born 26 October 1962), known professionally as '''Cary Elwes''', is an English actor, known for his performances in films such as ''[[Lady Jane (film)|Lady Jane]]'', ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]'', ''[[Hot Shots!]]'', ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'', ''[[Liar Liar]]'', ''[[Saw (film)|Saw]]'' and ''[[Saw 3D]]'', ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'', and ''[[Kiss the Girls (film)|Kiss the Girls]]''.

==Personal life==
Elwes was born in [[Westminster]], London, and is the third and youngest son of portrait-painter [[Dominick Elwes]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/37/Cary-Elwes.html Cary Elwes Biography (1962–)]&lt;/ref&gt; and interior designer [[Tessa Kennedy|Tessa Georgina Kennedy]], who is of [[Croats|Croatian]] and [[Anglo-Irish]] descent. His paternal grandfather is painter [[Simon Elwes]], whose father was the diplomat and [[tenor]] [[Gervase Elwes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/b/a/t/Robert-A-Battle/BOOK-0001/0000-0001.html Family Tree Maker's Genealogy Site: User Home Page Book: Cary Elwes: Title Page]&lt;/ref&gt; His brothers are [[Damian Elwes]], an artist, and [[Cassian Elwes]], a producer and agent. He is the stepson of [[Elliott Kastner]], an American film producer. He was raised Roman Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guthrie|first=Marisa|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2005/12/04/2005-12-04_the_spirit_moved_him.html|title=The spirit moved him|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|quote =Elwes, who grew up a Catholic,...|date=4 December 2005|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elwes attended [[Harrow School]] in London and [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in [[Bronxville, New York]], where he studied, among other acting-related subjects, [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist Film]]. While living in New York, Elwes studied acting at both the [[Actors' Studio]] and the [[Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In 1991, Elwes met photographer [[Lisa Marie Kurbikoff]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} They became engaged in 1997 and wed in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The couple have one daughter.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

One of his ancestors is [[John Elwes (politician)|John Elwes]], who is believed to be the inspiration for [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' (1843).&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecia.com.au/reviews/c/images/christmas-carol-production-notes.doc ''Disney's A Christmas Carol'' press notes], p. 6 (PDF). [http://www.webcitation.org/5tLrhTKfT WebCitation archive]. [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:uqqAzKJa3jUJ:thecia.com.au/reviews/c/images/christmas-carol-production-notes.doc HTML version]. &quot;Elwes has a unique connection to the story. The actor is actually related to the man believed to be the inspiration for Scrooge. 'John Elwes is an ancestor of mine who was a renowned miser,' says Elwes. 'He was a politician who changed his name from Meggot to Elwes in order to gain favour with his uncle, Sir Harvey Elwes, who he knew was going to die without an heir and he had tons of money. And it worked. He managed to get all Mr. Harvey Elwes' estates and proceeded to become one of the most famous misers in English history. He was renowned for never changing his clothes.{{'&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elwes played the role of Dick Wilkins in the [[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|2009 film adaptation]] of the novel.

==Career==
===Film===
Elwes made his acting debut in [[Marek Kanievska]]'s film ''[[Another Country (1984 film)|Another Country]]'' (where he played James Harcourt, a young and sentimental homosexual student from an English [[boarding school]]), with [[Rupert Everett]] and [[Colin Firth]]. The film, adapted from a play, was loosely based on the formative years of British spy [[Guy Burgess]], one of the [[Cambridge Five]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} He went on to play [[Guilford Dudley]] in the British film ''[[Lady Jane (film)|Lady Jane]]'', costarring [[Helena Bonham Carter]]. His performance in that film led director [[Rob Reiner]] to cast Elwes in another leading role, this time as the stable boy turned swashbuckler Westley in the comedy ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''.
[[File:Cary Elwes Saw 3D premiere cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Elwes attending the ''[[Saw 3D]]'' premiere on October 27, 2010.]]
He continued working steadily, varying between dramatic roles, as in ''[[The Bride (film)|The Bride]]'' (1985) with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Jennifer Beals]], to the [[Academy Award]]-winning ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'' (1989), and comedic roles, as in ''[[Hot Shots!]]'' (1991). In 1993, he starred as [[Robin Hood]] in [[Mel Brooks]]' comedy, ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]'' Elwes also appeared in such films as [[Francis Coppola]]'s adaptation of ''[[Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'', ''[[The Crush (1993 film)|The Crush]]'', ''[[Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book]]'', ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'', ''[[Liar Liar]]'', ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'', ''[[The Cat's Meow]]'' and ''[[Kiss the Girls (film)|Kiss the Girls]]''.

He was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance as Leon in ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]''.

==Personal life==

In his teens, he played drums and sang back-up with a local band called The Teen Tones, which later went on to tour with such acts as [[Bobby Darin]] and [[Gene Vincent]]. He graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in Beckley.He went on to West Virginia University and earned his degree in performing arts. He earned his master's degree in [[theater]] from [[The Catholic University of America]] (CUA) in [[Washington, D.C.]], where he met his first wife, actress [[Susan Sarandon]]; they divorced in 1979. Sarandon then married and divorced model Lisa Ann Cooper during the 1980s; they have three children, Stephanie, Alexis, and Michael Sarandon. He went on to marry actress and singer [[Joanna Gleason]] in 1994.

==Career==
After graduation, he toured with numerous improv companies and became heavily involved in [[Regional theatre in the United States|regional theatre]], making his professional debut in ''The Rose Tattoo'' in 1965. In 1968, Sarandon moved to [[New York]], where he landed his first television role as Dr. Tom Halverson on ''[[The Guiding Light]]'' (1969–1973). He appeared in the primetime TV movies ''The Satan Murders'' (1974) and ''[[Thursday's Game]]'' before landing the role of [[Al Pacino]]'s [[transsexual]] wife in ''Dog Day Afternoon'' (1975), a performance which earned him nominations for Best New Male Star of the Year at the [[Golden Globes]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. 

Sarandon appeared in ''[[The Rothschilds]]'' and ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], as well making regular appearances at numerous [[Shakespeare]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]] festivals in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. He also appeared in a series of television roles, some of which (such as ''A Tale of Two Cities'' in 1980) mirrored his affinity for the classics. He also took roles in horror films opposite the late [[Margaux Hemingway]] in the thriller ''[[Lipstick (film)|Lipstick]]'' (1976) and as a [[demon]] in the shocker ''[[The Sentinel (1977 film)|The Sentinel]]'' (1977). 

To avoid being [[Typecasting (acting)|type cast]] as villainous characters, Sarandon took on various roles in the years to come, portraying the [[Jesus Christ|title role]] in the [[made-for-television]] movie ''The Day Christ Died'' (1980). He received accolades for his portrayal of [[Sydney Carton]] in a made for television version of ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (1980), co-starred with [[Dennis Hopper]] in ''[[The Osterman Weekend (film)|The Osterman Weekend]]'' (1983), which was based on the [[Robert Ludlum]] novel of the same name, and co-starred with [[Goldie Hawn]] in ''[[Protocol (film)|Protocol]]'' (1984). These were followed by another mainstream success as the vampire-next-door in the teen horror film ''[[Fright Night]]'' (1985). 

He is best known in the film industry for his role as Prince Humperdinck in [[Rob Reiner]]'s 1987 film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', though he also has had supporting parts in some other successful films such as the original ''[[Child's Play]]'' (1988). In 1992, he played Joseph Curwen/Charles Dexter Ward in ''[[The Resurrected]]''. He also provided the voice of [[Jack Skellington]], the main character in [[Tim Burton]]'s [[animation|animated]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993), and has since reprised the role in many other subsequent productions, including the Disney/[[Square (company)|Square]] video games ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' and the [[Capcom]] sequel to the original film, ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge|Oogie's Revenge]]''. Sarandon also reprised his role as Jack Skellington for ''[[Halloween Screams]]'' and the [[Haunted Mansion Holiday]], a three-month overlay of the [[Haunted Mansion]] at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]], where Jack and his friends take over the Mansion in an attempt to take over Christmas, much as his character did in the film.

Sarandon would later find work on television again with a recurring role as Dr. Burke on [[NBC]]'s long-running medical drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''. 

In 1991 he performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the short-lived musical ''Nick and Nora'' (based on the ''[[The Thin Man (film)|Thin Man]]'' film) with [[Joanna Gleason]], the daughter of [[Monty Hall]]. Sarandon married Gleason in 1994. They have appeared together in a number of films, including ''[[Edie &amp; Pen]]'' (1996), ''[[American Perfekt]]'' (1997) and ''[[Let the Devil Wear Black]]'' (1999). In the 2000s he made guest appearances in quite a few TV series, notably as [[List of Charmed characters#The Necromancer|the Necromancer demon]], Armand, in ''[[Charmed]]'', and as superior court judge Barry Krumble in six episodes of ''[[Judging Amy]]''.

He returned to Broadway in 2006 playing Signor Naccarelli in the six-time [[Tony award]]-winning Broadway musical ''[[The Light in the Piazza (musical)|The Light in the Piazza]]'' at [[Lincoln Center]]. Most recently he appeared in ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' as Antoine de Guiche, alongside [[Kevin Kline]], [[Jennifer Garner]] and [[Daniel Sunjata]].

'''[[The Right Honourable|The Rt. Hon.]] Christopher Haden-Guest, 5th Baron Haden-Guest''' (born February 5, 1948), better known as '''Christopher Guest''', is an [[American people of the United States|American]] [[screenwriter]], [[composer]], [[musician]], [[film director|director]], [[actor]] and [[comedian]]. He is most widely known in [[Hollywood]] for having written, directed and starred in several [[improvisational theatre|improvisational]] &quot;[[mockumentary]]&quot; films that feature a [[repertory]]-like [[ensemble cast]], such as ''[[This is Spinal Tap]]''. In the [[United Kingdom]], he holds a Baronial [[British peerage|peerage]], and has publicly expressed a desire to see the [[House of Lords]] reformed as a democratically-elected chamber. Despite initial activity in the Lords, his career there was cut short by the [[House of Lords Act 1999]]. When using his title, he is normally [[Style (manner of address)|styled]] for short as Lord Haden-Guest.

==Early years==
Guest was born in [[New York City]], the son of [[Peter Haden-Guest, 4th Baron Haden-Guest|Peter Haden-Guest]], a [[British people|British]] [[United Nations]] diplomat who later became the 4th [[Baron Haden-Guest]], and his second wife, Jean Pauline Hindes, a former vice president of casting at [[CBS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ny times&quot;/&gt; Guest's maternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from [[Russia]]. His paternal grandfather, [[Leslie Haden-Guest, 1st Baron Haden-Guest|Leslie, Baron Haden-Guest]], was a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician who was a [[Conversion to Judaism|convert to Judaism]], and his paternal grandmother's father was [[Colonel (UK)|Colonel]] [[Albert Goldsmid]], a British officer who founded the [[Jewish Lads' and Girls' Brigade]] and the [[Maccabaeans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ny times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Witchel|first=Alex|coauthors=|title=The Shape-Shifter| pages=|publisher=The New York Times|date =2006-11-12|url =http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/magazine/12guest.html|accessdate =2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yar&gt;{{Cite book|last=Murray|first=William Henry|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Adam and Cain: symposium of old Bible history, Sumerian Empire, importance of blood of race, juggling juggernaut of the leaders of the Jews, the Gothic civilization of Adam and the ten commandments of his church|publisher=Murray|year=1952|location=|pages=|month=|url=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guest1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last =Rosen | first =Steven | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Want to spoof Purim and the Oscars?

Guest spent parts of his childhood in his father's native [[United Kingdom]]. He attended [[The High School of Music &amp; Art]] (New York City), studying classical music (clarinet). He later took up the [[mandolin]], became interested in [[country music]], and played guitar with [[Arlo Guthrie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Nowt so queer as folk | author = Richard Grant | date = January 10, 2004 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2004/jan/10/features.weekend | magazine = [[The Guardian]] Weekend }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guest later began performing with [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] bands until he took up [[rock and roll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Gross | first=Terry| url= http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14081515| title=Christopher Guest Plays with Parody | work=[[Fresh Air]], [[WHYY-FM|WHYY]]| publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]] |location=Philadelphia|date=September 14, 1989|accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1970s===
Guest began his career in theatre during the early 1970s with one his earliest professional performances being the role of Norman in [[Michael Weller]]'s ''[[Moonchildren]]'' for the play's American premiere at the [[Arena Stage]] in [[Washington D.C.]] in November 1971. Guest continued with the production when it moved to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1972. The following year he began making contributions to ''[[The National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'' for a variety of National Lampoon audio recordings. He both performed comic characters (Flash Bazbo-Space Explorer, Mr. Rogers, music critic Roger de Swans, and sleazy record company rep Ron Fields) and also wrote, arranged and performed numerous musical parodies (of Bob Dylan, James Taylor and others). He was featured alongside [[Chevy Chase]] and [[John Belushi]] in the [[Off-Broadway]] revue ''[[National Lampoon's Lemmings]]''. One of his earliest films includes a bit part as a uniformed police officer in ''[[Death Wish (film)|Death Wish]]'' starring [[Charles Bronson]].

Guest played a small role in the 1977 ''All In the Family'' episode &quot;[[List of All in the Family episodes#Season 8: 1977-1978|Mike and Gloria Meet]]&quot;, where in a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] sequence Mike and Gloria recall their first blind date, set up by Michael's college buddy Jim (Guest), who dated Gloria's girlfriend Debbie ([[Priscilla Lopez]]).

===1980s===
Along with [[Martin Short]], [[Billy Crystal]] and [[Harry Shearer]], Guest was hired as a one-year only cast member for the [[History of SNL:1980-1985#1984-1985 season|1984-85]] season on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Recurring characters on SNL played by Guest include Frankie, of Willie and Frankie (coworkers who recount in detail physically painful situations in which they have found themselves, remarking laconically &quot;I hate when that happens&quot;); Herb Minkman, a shady novelty toymaker with a brother named Al (played by Crystal); Rajeev Vindaloo, an eccentric foreign man in the same vein as [[Andy Kaufman]]'s Latka character from ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]''; and Senor Cosa, a Spanish ventriloquist often seen on the recurring spoof of ''The [[Joe Franklin]] Show ''. He also experimented behind the camera with pre-filmed sketches, notably directing a documentary-style short starring Shearer and Short as synchronized swimmers. In another short film from SNL, Guest and Crystal appear as retired Negro-League baseball players, &quot;The Rooster and the King&quot;.

He has appeared as [[Count Rugen]] in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', [[Charley Ford]] in ''[[The Long Riders]]'', Lord Cromer in ''[[Mrs Henderson Presents]]'' and Dr. Stone in ''[[A Few Good Men (film)|A Few Good Men]]''. He had a cameo role as Dylan, a smarmy pedestrian, in the 1986 [[musical film|musical]] [[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|remake]] of ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]''. As a co-writer and director, Guest made the Hollywood satire ''[[The Big Picture (film)|The Big Picture]]''.

Guest's biggest role of the first two decades of his career, however, is likely that of [[Nigel Tufnel]] in the 1984 [[mockumentary]] [[film]] ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''. Guest made his first appearance as Tufnel on the 1978 sketch comedy program ''The TV Show''.

Upon his father succeeding to the family [[British peerage|peerage]] in 1987, he was henceforth known as ''[[The Honourable|The Hon.]] Christopher Haden-Guest'' in full. This was his official [[Style (manner of address)|style]] and name until he himself inherited the [[baron]]y in 1996.

===1990–present===
The experience of having made ''Spinal Tap'' would directly inform the second phase of his career. Starting in 1996, Guest began writing, directing and acting in his own series of heavily [[Improvisational comedy|improvised]] films. Many of them would come to be definitive examples of what came to be known as &quot;mockumentaries&quot;.

His frequent writing partner is [[Eugene Levy]]. Together, Levy, Guest and a small band of other actors have formed a loose [[repertory]] group, which appear across several films. These include [[Catherine O'Hara]], [[Michael McKean]], [[Parker Posey]], [[Bob Balaban]], [[Jane Lynch]], [[John Michael Higgins]], Harry Shearer, [[Jennifer Coolidge]], [[Ed Begley, Jr.]] and [[Fred Willard]]. Guest and Levy write backgrounds for each of the characters and notecards for each specific scene, outlining the plot, and then leave it up to the actors to improvise the dialogue, which is supposed to result in a much more natural conversation than scripted dialogue would. Each of these movies also shares a hallmark plot development, where the movie leads up to some kind of a highly anticipated performance, or the outcome of a performance. This could reflect Guest's background in theater, and simply a kind of meta-commentary, as a real performance is of course what is being improvised for the duration. Notably, everyone who appears in these movies receives the same fee, and the same portion of profits.&lt;ref name = &quot;crose03&quot;/&gt;

Despite making a number of mockumentaries, Guest himself dislikes the term. He maintains that his intention is not to mock anyone, but to explore insular, perhaps obscure communities through his method of filmmaking. When pressed in a 2003 interview by [[Charlie Rose]], however, he could not provide a word to substitute for &quot;mockumentary&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;crose03&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2003/05/12/1/a-conversation-with-director-christopher-guest |last=Rose |first=Charlie |title=A conversation with director Christopher Guest |publisher=Charlie Rose LLC |date= May 12, 2003 |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a guest voice-over role in the animated comedy series ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' as SpongeBob's cousin, Stanley.

Guest appeared in the 2009 comedy ''[[The Invention of Lying]]''.

He is also currently a member of the musical group [[The Beyman Bros]], which he formed with his childhood friend [[David Nichtern]] and Spinal Tap's current keyboardist [[CJ Vanston]]. Their debut album ''Memories of Summer as a Child'' was released on January 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100007776 |title=Beyman Bros: The Thinking Person's Americana |last=Moon |first=Tom |date=February 2, 2009 |publisher=[[NPR]] |work=All Things Considered |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[United States Census Bureau]] paid $2.5 million to have a television commercial directed by Guest shown during television coverage of [[Super Bowl XLIV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/02/03/taxpayers-fork-million-single-census-ad-super-bowl/ |title=Taxpayers to Fork Out $2.5 Million for Single Census Ad During Super Bowl |date=February 3, 2010 |publisher=Fox News|accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peerage and heirs==
Guest became [[The Right Honourable|The Rt. Hon.]] [[Baron Haden-Guest|The 5th Baron Haden-Guest]], of [[Saling]], in the [[Essex|County of Essex]], when his father died in 1996. He succeeded upon the ineligibility of his older half-brother, [[Anthony Haden-Guest]], who was [[illegitimacy|born prior to the marriage of his parents]]. According to an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Guest attended the [[House of Lords]] regularly until the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] barred most hereditary peers from their seats. In the article Guest remarked:
{{quote|There's no question that the old system was unfair. I mean, why should you be born to this? But now it's all just sheer cronyism. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] can put in whoever he wants and bus them in to vote. The [[House of Lords|Upper House]] should be an elected body, it's that simple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] Weekend | title = Nowt so queer as folk |  author = Richard Grant | date = January 10, 2004 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2004/jan/10/features.weekend }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Personal life==
Guest married actress [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] in 1984 at the home of their mutual friend [[Rob Reiner]]. They have two [[adoption|adopted]] children: [[The Honourable|The Hon.]] Anne (born 1986) and The Hon. Thomas (born 1996). Because Guest's children are adopted, they cannot inherit the family barony under the terms of the [[letters patent]] that created it, though a 2004 [[Royal Warrant]] addressing the style of a peer's adopted children states that they can use [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy titles]]. The current [[heir presumptive]] to the barony is Guest's younger brother, the actor [[Nicholas Guest|The Hon. Nicholas Haden-Guest]].

==Off-stage demeanor==
Guest is sometimes off-putting in interviews and promotional appearances (having been described by reviewer Warren Etheredge as, &quot;rude, condescending and intolerable&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Dizon | first = Dristin | url = http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/166799_filmguy30.html | title = If it's happening in Seattle, you can bet movie lover Warren Etheredge is in the loop | publisher = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | date = March 30, 2007 |accessdate = 2007-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with people who have met him outside of the work environment because contrary to expectations of him as a comedian he often seems deadpan, even dour. Of this, Guest has said, &quot;People want me to be funny all the time. They think I'm being funny no matter what I say or do and that's not the case. I rarely joke unless I'm in front of a camera. It's not what I am in real life. It's what I do for a living.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hobson | first=Louis B| url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/G/Guest_Christopher/2000/10/10/pf-758773.html

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''C*-algebras''' (pronounced &quot;C-star&quot;) are an important area of research in [[functional analysis]], a branch of [[mathematics]].  The prototypical example of a C*-algebra is a [[complex number|complex]] [[algebra over a field|algebra]] ''A'' of [[linear operator]]s on a [[complex number|complex]] [[Hilbert space]] with two additional properties:

* ''A'' is a topologically [[closed set]] in the [[norm topology]] of operators.

* ''A'' is closed under the operation of taking [[adjoint of an operator|adjoint]]s of operators.

It is generally believed that C*-algebras were first considered primarily for their use in [[quantum mechanics]] to [[model (abstract)|model]] algebras of physical [[observable]]s.  This line of research began with [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]] and in a more mathematically developed form with [[Pascual Jordan]] around 1933.  Subsequently [[John von Neumann]] attempted to establish a general framework for these algebras which culminated in a series of papers on rings of operators.  These papers considered a special class of C*-algebras which are now known as [[von Neumann algebra]]s.

Around 1943, the work of [[Israel Gelfand]] and [[Mark Naimark]] yielded an  abstract characterisation of C*-algebras making no reference to operators.

C*-algebras are now an important tool in the theory of unitary representations of locally compact groups, and are also used in algebraic formulations of quantum mechanics. Another active area of research is the program to obtain classification, or to determine the extent of which classification is possible, for simple [[nuclear C*-algebra]]s.

== Abstract characterization ==

We begin with the abstract characterization of C*-algebras given in the 1943 paper by Gelfand and Naimark.

A C*-algebra, ''A'', is a [[Banach algebra]] over the field of [[complex number]]s, together with a [[Map (mathematics)|map]], * : ''A'' → ''A'', called an [[Semigroup with involution|involution]]. The image of an element ''x'' of ''A'' under the involution is written ''x''*. Involution has the following properties:

* For all ''x'', ''y'' in ''A'':

::&lt;math&gt; (x + y)^* = x^* + y^* \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; (x y)^* = y^* x^* \,&lt;/math&gt;

* For every λ in '''C''' and every ''x'' in ''A'':

::&lt;math&gt; (\lambda x)^* = \overline{\lambda} x^* .&lt;/math&gt;

* For all ''x'' in ''A''

::&lt;math&gt; (x^*)^* = x \,&lt;/math&gt;

* The '''C*–identity''' holds for   all ''x'' in ''A'':

::&lt;math&gt;  \|x^* x \| = \|x\|\|x^*\| .&lt;/math&gt;

:Note that the C* identity  is equivalent to: for   all ''x'' in ''A'':

::&lt;math&gt;  \|x x^* \| = \|x\|\|x^*\| .&lt;/math&gt;

This relation is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;  \|x x^* \| = \|x\|^2 &lt;/math&gt;, which is sometimes called the B*-identity. For history behind the names C*- and B*-algebras, see the [[#Some_history:_B.2A-algebras_and_C.2A-algebras|history]] section below.

The C*-identity is a very strong requirement. For instance, together with the [[spectral radius|spectral radius formula]], it implies the C*-norm is uniquely determined by the algebraic structure:

::&lt;math&gt; \|x\|^2 = \|x^* x\| = \sup\{|\lambda| : x^* x - \lambda \,1 \text{ is not invertible} \}.&lt;/math&gt;


A [[bounded linear map]], π : ''A'' → ''B'', between C*-algebras ''A'' and ''B'' is called a '''*-homomorphism''' if

* For ''x'' and ''y'' in ''A''

::&lt;math&gt; \pi(x y) = \pi(x) \pi(y) \,&lt;/math&gt;

* For ''x'' in ''A''

::&lt;math&gt; \pi(x^*) = \pi(x)^* \,&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of C*-algebras, any *-homomorphism π between C*-algebras is [[Short map|non-expansive]], i.e. bounded with norm ≤ 1. Furthermore, an injective *-homomorphism between C*-algebras is isometric. These are consequences of the C*-identity.

A bijective *-homomorphism π is called a '''C*-isomorphism''', in which case ''A'' and ''B'' are said to be '''isomorphic'''.

==Some history: B*-algebras and C*-algebras==
The term &lt;math&gt;B^*&lt;/math&gt;-algebra was introduced by C. E. Rickart in 1946 to describe [[Banach *-algebra]]s that satisfy the condition:

* &lt;math&gt;\lVert x x^* \rVert = \lVert x \rVert ^2&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the given &lt;math&gt;B^*&lt;/math&gt;-algebra. (B*-condition)

This condition automatically implies that the *-involution is [[isometry|isometric]], that is, &lt;math&gt;\lVert x \rVert = \lVert x^* \rVert&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;\lVert x x^* \rVert = \lVert x \rVert \lVert x^* \rVert&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore, a &lt;math&gt;B^*&lt;/math&gt;-algebra is also a &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;-algebra. Conversely, the &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;-condition implies the &lt;math&gt;B^*&lt;/math&gt;-condition. This is nontrivial, and can be proved without using the condition &lt;math&gt;\lVert x \rVert = \lVert x^* \rVert&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doran|Belfi|1986|pp=5&amp;ndash;6}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=6jNbsnJVjMoC&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt;
For these reasons, the term &lt;math&gt;B^*&lt;/math&gt;-algebra is rarely used in current terminology, and has been replaced by the term '&lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; algebra'.

The term &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;-algebra was introduced by I. E. Segal in 1947 to describe norm-closed subalgebras of &lt;math&gt;B(H)&lt;/math&gt;, namely, the space of bounded operators on some Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. 'C' stood for 'closed'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doran|Belfi|1986|p=6}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=6jNbsnJVjMoC&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segal|1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
=== Finite-dimensional C*-algebras ===

The algebra M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') of ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over '''C''' becomes a C*-algebra if we consider matrices as operators on the Euclidean space, '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and  use the [[operator norm]] ||.|| on matrices. The involution is given by the [[conjugate transpose]].  More generally, one can consider finite [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]]s of matrix algebras. In fact, all C*-algebras that are finite dimensional as vector spaces are of this form, up to isomorphism. The self-adjoint requirement means finite-dimensional C*-algebras are [[Semisimple algebra|semisimple]], from which fact one can deduce the following theorem of [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem|Artin–Wedderburn]] type:

'''Theorem'''.  A finite-dimensional C*-algebra, ''A'', is [[canonical]]ly isomorphic to a finite direct sum
:&lt;math&gt; A = \bigoplus_{e \in \min A } A e&lt;/math&gt;
where min ''A'' is the set of minimal nonzero self-adjoint central projections of ''A''.

Each C*-algebra, ''Ae'', is isomorphic (in a noncanonical way) to the full matrix algebra M&lt;sub&gt;dim(e)&lt;/sub&gt;('''C'''). The
finite family indexed on min ''A'' given by {dim(e)}&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;
is called the ''dimension vector'' of ''A''.  This vector uniquely determines the isomorphism class of a finite-dimensional C*-algebra. In the language of [[operator K-theory|K-theory]], this vector is the [[ordered group|positive cone]] of the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; group of ''A''.

An immediate generalization of finite dimensional C*-algebras are the [[approximately finite dimensional C*-algebra]]s.

=== C*-algebras of compact operators ===

Let ''H'' be a [[separable space|separable]] infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The algebra ''K''(''H'') of [[Compact operator on Hilbert space|compact operator]]s on ''H'' is a [[norm closed]] subalgebra of ''B''(''H''). It is also closed under involution; hence it is a  C*-algebra.

Concrete C*-algebras of compact operators admit a characterization similar to Wedderburn's theorem for finite dimensional C*-algebras.

'''Theorem.''' If ''A'' is a C*-subalgebra of ''K''(''H''), then there exists Hilbert spaces {''H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}&lt;sub&gt;''i'' ∈ ''I''&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''A'' is isomorphic to the following direct sum

:&lt;math&gt; \bigoplus_{i \in I } K(H_i),&lt;/math&gt;

where the (C*-)direct sum consists of elements (''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') of the Cartesian product Π ''K''(''H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') with ||''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''|| → 0.

Though ''K''(''H'')  does not have an identity element, a sequential [[approximate identity]] for ''K''(''H'') can be easily displayed. To be specific, ''H'' is isomorphic to the space  of square summable sequences ''l''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; we may assume that

:&lt;math&gt; H = \ell^2. \quad &lt;/math&gt;

For each natural number ''n'' let ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be the subspace of sequences of ''l''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which vanish for indices

:&lt;math&gt; k \geq n &lt;/math&gt;

and let

:&lt;math&gt; e_n \quad &lt;/math&gt;

be the orthogonal projection onto ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. The sequence {''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is an approximate identity for ''K''(''H'').

''K''(''H'') is a two-sided closed ideal of ''B''(''H''). For separable Hilbert spaces, it is the unique ideal. The [[quotient]] of ''B''(''H'') by ''K''(''H'') is the [[Calkin algebra]].

===C*-algebras of operators ===

The prototypical example of a C*-algebra is the algebra ''B(H)'' of bounded (equivalently continuous) [[linear operator]]s defined on a complex [[Hilbert space]] ''H''; here ''x''* denotes the [[adjoint operator]] of the operator ''x'' : ''H'' → ''H''. In fact, every C*-algebra, ''A'', is *-isomorphic to a norm-closed adjoint closed subalgebra of ''B(H)'' for a suitable Hilbert space, ''H''; this is the content of the [[Gelfand–Naimark theorem]].

=== Commutative C*-algebras ===

Let ''X'' be a [[locally compact]] Hausdorff space.  The space C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') of complex-valued continuous functions on ''X'' that ''vanish at infinity'' (defined in the article on [[locally compact|local compactness]]) form a commutative C*-algebra C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') under pointwise multiplication and addition. The involution is pointwise conjugation. C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') has a multiplicative unit element if and only if ''X'' is  compact.  As does any C*-algebra, C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') has an [[approximate identity]].
In the case of C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') this is immediate: consider the directed set of compact subsets of ''X'', and for each compact ''K'' let ''f&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;'' be a function of compact support which is identically 1 on ''K''.  Such functions exist by the [[Tietze extension theorem]] which applies to locally compact Hausdorff spaces. ''{f&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an approximate identity.

The [[Gelfand representation]] states that every commutative C*-algebra is *-isomorphic to the algebra C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), where ''X'' is the space of [[Character (mathematics)|characters]] equipped with the [[Weak topology|weak* topology]]. Furthermore if C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'') as C*-algebras, it follows that ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]]. This characterization is one of the motivations for the [[noncommutative topology]] and [[noncommutative geometry]] programs.

=== C*-enveloping algebra ===

Given a B*-algebra ''A'' with an [[approximate identity]], there is a unique (up to C*-isomorphism) C*-algebra '''E'''(''A'') and *-morphism π from ''A'' into '''E'''(''A'') which is [[universal morphism|universal]], that is, every other B*-morphism {{nowrap|π&amp;thinsp;'&amp;thinsp;: ''A'' → ''B''}} factors uniquely through π.  The algebra '''E'''(''A'') is called the '''C*-enveloping algebra''' of the B*-algebra&amp;nbsp;''A''.

Of particular importance is the C*-algebra of a [[locally compact group]] ''G''.  This is defined as the enveloping C*-algebra of the [[group algebra]] of ''G''.  The  C*-algebra of ''G''  provides context for general [[harmonic analysis]] of ''G'' in the case ''G'' is non-abelian.  In particular, the dual of a locally compact group is defined to be the primitive ideal space of the group C*-algebra.  See [[spectrum of a C*-algebra]].

=== von Neumann algebras ===

[[von Neumann algebra]]s, known as W* algebras before the 1960s, are a special kind of C*-algebra. They are required to be closed in the [[weak operator topology]], which is weaker than the norm topology. Their study is a specialized area of functional analysis.

== Properties of C*-algebras ==

C*-algebras have a large number of properties that are technically convenient. These properties can be established by  use the [[continuous functional calculus]] or by reduction to commutative  C*-algebras.  In the latter case, we can use the fact that the structure of these is completely determined by the [[Gelfand isomorphism]].

* The set of elements of a C*-algebra ''A'' of the form ''x''*''x'' forms a closed [[convex cone]].  This cone is identical to the elements of the form ''x'' ''x''*. Elements of this cone are called ''non-negative'' (or sometimes ''positive'', even though this terminology conflicts with its use for elements of '''R'''.)

* The set of self-adjoint elements of a C*-algebra ''A'' naturally has the structure of a [[partial order|partially ordered]] [[vector space]]; the ordering is usually denoted ≥. In this ordering, a self-adjoint element ''x'' of ''A'' satisfies ''x'' ≥ 0 if and only if the [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of ''x''  is non-negative. Two self-adjoint elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''A'' satisfy ''x'' ≥ ''y'' if ''x'' - ''y'' ≥ 0.

* Any C*-algebra ''A'' has an [[approximate identity]].  In fact, there is a directed family {''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;λ ∈ I&lt;/sub&gt; of self-adjoint elements of ''A'' such that

:: &lt;math&gt; x e_\lambda \rightarrow x &lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt; 0 \leq e_\lambda \leq e_\mu \leq 1\quad \mbox{ whenever } \lambda \leq \mu. &lt;/math&gt;

: In case ''A'' is separable, ''A'' has a sequential approximate identity. More generally, ''A'' will have a sequential approximate identity if and only if ''A'' contains a [[Hereditary C*-subalgebra|'''strictly positive element''']], i.e. a positive element ''h'' such that ''hAh'' is dense in ''A''.

* Using approximate identities, one can show that the algebraic [[quotient]] of a C*-algebra by a closed proper two-sided [[ideal]], with the natural norm, is a C*-algebra.

* Similarly, a closed two-sided ideal of a C*-algebra is itself a C*-algebra.

== Type for C*-algebras ==

A C*-algebra '''A''' is of type I if and only if for all non-degenerate representations π of '''A''' the von Neumann algebra π('''A''')&amp;prime;&amp;prime; (that is, the bicommutant of π('''A''')) is a type I von Neumann algebra. In fact it is sufficient to consider only factor representations, i.e. representations π for which π(A)&amp;prime;&amp;prime; is a factor.

A locally compact group is said to be of type I if and only if its [[group C^*-algebra|group C*-algebra]] is type I.

However, if a C*-algebra has non-type I representations, then by results of [[James Glimm]] it also has representations of type II and type III. Thus for C*-algebras and locally compact groups, it is only meaningful to speak of type I and non type I properties.

== C*-algebras and quantum field theory ==

In [[quantum field theory]], one typically describes a physical system with a C*-algebra ''A'' with unit element; the self-adjoint elements of ''A'' (elements ''x'' with ''x''* = ''x'') are thought of as the ''observables'', the measurable quantities, of the system. A ''state'' of the system is defined as a positive functional on ''A'' (a '''C'''-linear map φ : ''A'' → '''C''' with φ(''u''* ''u'') ≥ 0 for all ''u''∈''A'') such that φ(1) = 1. The expected value of the observable ''x'', if the system is in state φ, is then φ(''x'').

&lt;!--Paragraph 1/3: Introduction and geogrpahy:--&gt;
The '''London Borough of Croydon''' ({{audio|En-uk-LBCroydon.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a [[London borough]] in [[South London]], [[England]] and is part of [[Outer London]]. It covers an area of {{convert|87|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}} and is the largest London borough by population. It is the southernmost borough of [[London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;General info&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=1996|url=http://www.londononline.co.uk/boroughs/croydon/|title=London Borough of Croydon information|publisher=London Online|accessdate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its centre is the historic town of [[Croydon]] from which the borough takes its name. Croydon is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]], and from a small market town has expanded into one of the most populous areas on the fringe of London. Croydon is the civic centre of the borough and houses the largest office and retail centre in the south east of England outside [[Central London]]. The borough is now one of London's leading [[business]], [[financial]] and [[cultural]] centres, and its influence in [[entertainment]] and the [[arts]] contribute to its status as a major metropolitan centre.

&lt;!--Paragraph 2/3: History and governance:--&gt;
Formed in 1965 from the [[Coulsdon and Purley Urban District]] and the [[County Borough of Croydon]], the borough is now part of the local government association for Greater London, [[London Councils]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arms of Croydon Online&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/origins/arms.asp|title=The Arms of the London Borough of Croydon|publisher=Croydon Online|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The borough has a long history which is based mainly around [[Economy of Croydon|the economy of the area]]. The economic strength of Croydon dates back mainly to [[Croydon Airport]] which was a major factor in the development of Croydon as a business centre. Once London's main airport for all international flights to and from the capital, it was closed on 30 September 1959 due to the lack of expansion space needed for an airport to serve the growing city. It is now a Grade II [[listed building]] and tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=201233&amp;resourceID=5|title=Listed Buildings Online: Airport House|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=201234&amp;resourceID=5|title=Listed Buildings Online: Former Lodge To Croydon Airport Terminal|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croydon Council and its predecessor [[County Borough of Croydon|Croydon Corporation]] unsuccessfully applied for [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 1954, 2000 and 2002.

&lt;!--Paragraph 3/3: Places, landmarks and cultural institutions:--&gt;
The area is one of the hearts of culture in London and the South East of England. Institutions such as the [[Warehouse Theatre]] and the major arts and entertainment centre [[Fairfield Halls]] add to the vibrancy of the borough. The [[Croydon Clocktower]] was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1994 as an arts venue featuring a library, cinema and museum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croydon Town Hall&quot;/&gt; Since 2000, Croydon has been home to an annual summer festival celebrating the area's cultural diversity, regularly gathering audiences of over 50,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2010|url=http://www.croydonfestival.com/transport.html|title=Croydon Summer Festival|publisher=Croydon Festival|accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The borough is home to its own local TV station, ''Croydon TV''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CroydonTV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2011|url=http://www.croydontv.co.uk/|title=Croydon TV|publisher=Croydon TV|accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional [[the Football League|English Football league]] club [[Crystal Palace F.C.]] play at [[Selhurst Park]] in [[South Norwood]], a stadium they have been based in since 1924.

==History==
:'' For the history of the original town see [[Croydon#History|History of Croydon]]''
The London Borough of Croydon was formed in 1965 from the [[Coulsdon and Purley Urban District]] and the [[County Borough of Croydon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arms of Croydon Online&quot;/&gt; The name Croydon comes from Crogdene or Croindone, named by the [[Saxons]] in the 8th century when they settled here, although the area had been inhabited since prehistoric times.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Croydon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43053|title=Croydon: Introduction and Croydon Palace|publisher=British History Online|accessdate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought to derive from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''croeas deanas'', meaning &quot;the valley of the [[crocus]]es&quot;, indicating that, like [[Saffron Walden]] in [[Essex]], it was a centre for the collection of [[saffron]].

By the time of the Norman invasion Croydon had a church, a mill and around 365 inhabitants as recorded in the Domesday Book.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croyweb History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.croyweb.com/Basic/history.htm|title=Local history of Croydon|publisher=Croyweb|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Archbishop Lanfranc]] lived at [[Croydon Palace]] which still stands. Visitors included [[Thomas Beckett]] (another Archbishop), and royal figures such as [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] and [[Queen Elizabeth I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Croydon book&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Malden|first=H.E.|title=A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 4|year=1912|publisher=Victoria County History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croydon carried on through the ages as a prosperous market town, they produced charcoal, tanned leather, and ventured into brewing. Croydon was served by the [[Surrey Iron Railway]], the first public railway (horse drawn) in the world, in 1803, and by the [[Brighton Main Line|London to Brighton]] rail link in the mid-19th century, helping it to become the largest town in [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Croyweb History&quot;/&gt;

In the 20th century Croydon became known for industries such as metal working, car manufacture and its aerodrome, [[Croydon Airport]]. Starting out during [[World War I]] as an airfield for protection against [[Zeppelin]]s, an adjacent airfield was combined, and the new aerodrome opened on 29 March 1920. It became the largest in London, and was the main terminal for international air freight into the capital. It developed into one of the great airports of the world during the 1920s and 1930s, and welcomed the world's pioneer aviators in its heyday.&lt;ref name=&quot;Battle book&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cluett|first=Douglas|coauthors=Joanna Bogle, Bob Learmonth|title=Croydon Airport and The Battle for Britain|year=1984|location=London Borough of Sutton Libraries and Arts Services|isbn=0-907335-11-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British Airways Ltd]] used the airport for a short period after redirecting from [[RAF Northolt|Northolt Aerodrome]], and Croydon was the operating base for [[Imperial Airways]]. It was partly due to the airport that Croydon suffered heavy bomb damage during [[World War II]]. As aviation technology progressed, however, and [[aircraft]] became larger and more numerous, it was recognized in 1952 that the airport would be too small to cope with the ever-increasing volume of air traffic. The last scheduled flight departed on 30 September 1959. It was superseded as the main airport by both [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]] and [[London Gatwick Airport]] (see below). The air terminal, now known as Airport House, has been restored, and has a hotel and museum in it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croyweb History&quot;/&gt;

In the late 1950s and through the 1960s the council commercialized the centre of Croydon with massive development of office blocks and the [[Whitgift Centre]] which was formerly the biggest in town shopping centre in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;urbanization&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://usj.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/43/13/2399|title=Modernism vs Urban Renaissance: Negotiating Post-war Heritage in English City Centres|publisher=Urban Studies Journal|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre was officially opened in October 1970 by the [[Katharine, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]]. The original [[Whitgift School]] there had moved to Haling Park, South Croydon in the 1930s; the replacement school on the site, Whitgift Middle School, now the [[Trinity School of John Whitgift]], moved to Shirley Park in the 1960s when the buildings were demolished.

The borough council unsuccessfully applied for [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 1965, 2000 and again in 2002. If it had been successful it would have been the third local authority in [[Greater London]] to hold that status along with the ''[[City of London]]'' and the ''[[City of Westminster]]''. At present the London Borough of Croydon is the second most populous [[Local government district]] of England without city status, [[Kirklees]] being the first. Croydon's applications were refused as it was felt not to have an identity separate from the rest of Greater London. In 1965 it was described as &quot;...now just part of the London conurbation and almost indistinguishable from many of the other Greater London boroughs&quot; and in 2000 as having &quot;no particular identity of its own&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;beckett&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=City status in the British Isles, 1830–2002|series=Historical urban studies|author=Beckett, J V|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot|isbn=0-7546-5067-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croydon is currently going through a vigorous regeneration plan, called [[Croydon Vision 2020]]. This will change the [[urban planning]] of Central Croydon completely.

It is now governed by a [[cabinet-style council]] created in 2001. Croydon shares its [[London Assembly]] member with neighboring [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]]. It is a safe Conservative seat with the south of Croydon and parts of Sutton traditionally voting towards the Conservatives. The current Assembly Member is [[Steve O'Connell]] who was elected to the assembly in 2008 with a majority of 43%. Croydon is part of the [[London (European Parliament constituency)|London]] constituency in the [[European Parliament]]. Between 1979 and 1984 it formed part of the [[London South (European Parliament constituency)|London South]] constituency, followed by [[London South and Surrey East (European Parliament constituency)|London South and Surrey East]] between 1984 and 1999 before the adoption of [[proportional representation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/|title=David Boothroyd's United Kingdom Election Results|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics of Croydon Council===
{{further|[[Croydon local elections]]}}
The council consists of 70 councillors elected in 24 wards. From 1994 to 2006 the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] controlled the council. Thirty-seven Labour and 31 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] councillors were elected in the [[Croydon Council election, 2002|2002 elections]], plus a lone [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]], bolstered by a subsequent defection of a councillor who had originally been elected as a Conservative, defected to Labour, went back to the Conservatives and spent some time as an independent.

At the [[Croydon Council election 2006|2006 local elections]] the Conservatives regained control of the council after gaining 12 seats, taking ten seats from Labour in Addiscombe, Waddon, South Norwood and Upper Norwood together with the single Liberal Democrat seat in Coulsdon.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005 election&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydon.gov.uk/democracy/dande/elections/results/general|title=Results of the 2005 General Election held for Croydon Council|publisher=Croydon Council|accessdate=2007-10-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071027083047/http://www.croydon.gov.uk/democracy/dande/elections/results/general &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Map of wards in Croydon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.croydon.gov.uk/content/departments/570770/570872/wardmap.pdf|title=How the wards look|publisher=Croydon Council|accessdate=2007-09-20|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071026182529/http://www.croydon.gov.uk/content/departments/570770/570872/wardmap.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had seen 6% swings from Labour to Conservative in the two previous by-elections, each won by the incumbent party. Since the 2006 elections, a by-election in February 2007 saw a large swing back to Labour from the Conservatives. Since the election, a Labour councillor joined the Conservatives while a Conservative councillor became an independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croydonconservatives.com/news_search_results_detail.asp?StoryNo=949|title=Councillor defects to the Tory Group after a “lifetime” in the Labour Party|publisher=Croydon Conservatives|accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cllr Jonathan Driver, who became Mayor in 2008, died unexpectedly at the close of the year, causing a by-election in highly marginal Waddon which was successfully held by the Conservatives. The following election of May 2010 saw Labour regaining their lost seats in Addiscombe, South Norwood and Upper Norwood, but losing one seat to the Conservatives in New Addington. The current composition of the council is Conservatives 37, Labour 33.

The controlling majority group in the borough is the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. From February 2005 until May 2006 the Leader of Croydon Council was [[Labour Co-operative]] Councillor Tony Newman, succeeding Hugh Malyan. Mike Fisher, Conservative group leader since May 2005, was named as Council Leader following the Conservative victory. Croydon is a [[cabinet-style council]], and the Leader heads a ten-person cabinet, its members responsible for areas such as education or planning. There is a Shadow Cabinet drawn from the principal opposition party. A backbench cross-party scrutiny and overview committee is in place to hold the executive cabinet to account.

The borough is covered by three [[parliamentary constituencies]] for the Westminster Parliament, these are [[Croydon North (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon North]], [[Croydon Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon Central]] and [[Croydon South (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon South]]. There are 24 wards which represent Croydon Council.

===Civic history===
For much of its history, Croydon Council was controlled by the Conservative Party or conservative-leaning independents. Former Croydon councillors include former MPs [[Andrew Pelling]], [[Vivian Bendall]], [[David Congdon]], [[Geraint Davies (Labour politician)|Geraint Davies]] and [[Reg Prentice]], [[London Assembly]] member [[Valerie Shawcross]], [[Peter Spencer Bowness|Lord Bowness]], [[John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson of Lymington]] ([[Master of the Rolls]]) and [[H.T. Muggeridge]], MP and father of [[Malcolm Muggeridge]]. The first Mayor of the newly created [[County Borough]] was [[Jabez Balfour]], later a disgraced [[Member of Parliament]]. Former Conservative Director of Campaigning, [[Gavin Barwell]], was a Croydon councillor between 1998 and 2010 and since 2010 is the MP for Croydon Central.

Some 10,000 people work directly or indirectly for the council, in its main offices in Taberner House or in its schools, care homes, housing offices or work depots. The council is generally well-regarded, having made important improvements in education and social services. However, there have been concerns over benefits, leisure services and waste collection. Although the council has one of London's lower rates of council tax, there are inevitable claims that it is too high and that resources are wasted.

The [[Mayors in England|Mayor of Croydon]] for 2010-11 is Councillor Avril Slipper. The Leader is Cllr Mike Fisher and the Deputy Leaders are Cllr Tim Pollard and Cllr Dudley Mead. The Chief Executive since 7 July 2007 has been Jon Rouse.

===Government buildings===
[[File:CroydonTabHouse.jpg|thumb|left|Croydon Council's [[Taberner House]] offices]]
[[Croydon Clocktower|Croydon Town Hall]] on Katharine Street in [[Croydon|Central Croydon]] houses the committee rooms, the mayor's and other councillors' offices, electoral services and the arts and heritage services.

The present Town Hall is Croydon's third. The first town hall is thought to have been built in either 1566 or 1609.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croydon Town Hall&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/heritage/town_hall.asp|title=Katharine Street, Town Hall: Heritage Pages|publisher=Croydon Online|accessdate=2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was built in 1808 to serve the growing town but was demolished after the present town hall was erected in 1895.

The present town hall was designed by local architect Charles Henman&lt;ref name=&quot;Croydon Town Hall&quot;/&gt; and was officially opened by the Prince and [[Queen Alexandra|Princess of Wales]] on 19 May 1896. It was constructed in red brick, sourced from [[Wrotham]] in [[Kent]], with [[Portland stone]] dressings and green [[Westmoreland]] [[slate]]s for the roof. It also housed the court and most central council employees.

[[File:Croydon clocktower.jpg|thumb|Croydon's Victorian Town Hall]]

Parts, including the former court rooms, have been converted into the [[Museum of Croydon]] and exhibition galleries. The original public library is now a cinema, part of the [[Croydon Clocktower]]. The Braithwaite Hall is used for events and performances. The town hall was renovated in the mid-1990s and the imposing central staircase, long closed to the public and kept for councillors only, was re-opened in 1994. The civic complex, meanwhile, was substantially added to, with buildings across Mint Walk and the 19-floor Taberner House to house the rapidly expanding corporation's employees.

[[Ruskin House]] is the headquarters of Croydon's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], [[Trade Union]] and [[Co-operative Party|Co-operative]] movements and is itself a co-operative with shareholders from organisations across the three movements. In the 19th century, Croydon was a bustling commercial centre of London. It was said that, at the turn of the 20th century, approximately £10,000 was spent in Croydon's taverns and inns every week. For the early labour movement, then, it was natural to meet in the town's public houses, in this environment. However, the temperance movement was equally strong, and [[Georgina King Lewis]], a keen member of the [[Temperance movement|Croydon United Temperance Council]], took it upon herself to establish a dry centre for the labour movement. The first Ruskin House was highly successful, and there has been two more since.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruskin House&quot;&gt;This text was taken, with permission, from ''Ruskin House: A History'', M. Tiedemann &amp; E. Daisley. For more information see [[Talk:Ruskin House|here]] {{cite book|first=M. Tiedemann|coauthors=E. Daisley|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current house was officially opened in 1967 by the then Labour [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Harold Wilson]]. Today, Ruskin House continues to serve as the headquarters of the Trade Union, Labour and Co-operative movements in Croydon, hosting a range of meetings and being the base for several labour movement groups. Office tenants include the headquarters of the [[Communist Party of Britain]] and Croydon Labour Party. [[Geraint Davies (Labour politician)|Geraint Davies]], the MP for [[Croydon Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon Central]], had offices in the building, until he was defeated by [[Andrew Pelling]] and is now the Labour representative standing for [[Swansea West (UK Parliament constituency)|Swansea West]] in [[Wales]].

[[Taberner House]] was built between 1964 and 1967, designed by architect H. Thornley, with Allan Holt and Hugh Lea as borough engineers. Although the council had needed extra space since the 1920s, it was only with the imminent creation of the London Borough of Croydon that action was taken. The building is in classic 1960s style, praised at the time but subsequently much derided. It has its elegant upper slab block narrowing towards both ends, a formal device which has been compared to the famous [[Pirelli Tower]] in [[Milan]]. It was named after Ernest Taberner OBE, Town Clerk from 1937 to 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taberner House names&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/heritage/taberner_house.asp|title=Park Lane, Taberner House:Heritage Pages|publisher=Croydon Online|accessdate=2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taberner House houses most of the council's central employees and its 'one-stop shop' is the main location for the public to access information and services, particularly with respect to housing.

==Geography and climate==
The borough is in the deep south of London, with the [[M25 motorway|M25 orbital motorway]] stretching to the south of it, between Croydon and [[Tandridge (district)|Tandridge]]. In the north and east of Croydon the authority mainly borders the [[London Borough of Bromley]] and in the north west the boroughs of [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] and [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]]. The boroughs of [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]] and [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]] are located directly to the west. It is at the head of the [[River Wandle]], just to the north of a significant gap in the [[North Downs]]. It lies {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of London, and the earliest settlement may have been a Roman staging post on the London-Portslade road, although conclusive evidence has not yet been found. The main town centre houses a great variety of well-known stores on [[North End, Croydon|North End]] and two shopping centres. It was pedestrianised in 1989 to attract people back to the town centre. Another shopping centre called [[Park Place (Croydon)|Park Place]], was due to open in 2012 but has since been scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Croydon Council abandons agreement to build new shopping centre |first=Andrew |last=Worden |url=http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/news/Breaking-news-Croydon-Council-abandons-agreement-build-new-shopping-centre/article-985303-detail/article.html/ |newspaper=[[Croydon Advertiser]] |date=2009-05-12|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croydon is a gateway to the south from Central London, and therefore has a number of major roads running through it. [[Purley Way]] on the [[A23 road]] was built to by-pass Croydon town centre on which the A23 once did, is one of the busiest roads in the borough, and has been the site of several major retail developments including one of only 18 [[IKEA]] stores in the country, built on the site of the former power station.&lt;ref name=&quot;purleywayhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/places/purleyway.asp|title=History of the Purley Way retail district|publisher=Croydon Online|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It carries on to [[Brighton Road]] which is the main route running towards the south from [[South Croydon|Croydon]] to [[Purley, London|Purley]] and continues on the [[A23 road|A23]]. The centre of Croydon is very congested, and the urban planning has since become out of date and quite inadequate, due to the expansion of Croydon's main shopping area and office blocks. [[Wellesley Road]], is a [[dual carriageway]] that cuts through the centre of the town, and makes it hard to interchange between the civic centre's two railway stations. [[Croydon Vision 2020]] includes a plan for a more pedestrian-friendly replacement. It has also been named as one of the worst roads for cyclists in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;cycle names&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://crapcyclelanesofcroydon.blogspot.com/2007/05/jug-handle-wellesley-road.html|title=The &quot;jug handle&quot; - Wellesley Road|publisher=Crap Cycle Lanes of Croydon|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the [[Croydon Underpass]] beneath the junction of George Street and [[Wellesley Road]]/Park Lane during the early Sixties started, with the main aim to prevent traffic congestion on Park Lane, situated above the underpass. The [[Croydon Flyover]] on the other hand is situated near the underpass and next to [[Taberner House]]. It mainly leads traffic on to [[Duppas Hill]], towards [[Purley Way]] with the intention for easy links with [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] and [[Kingston upon Thames]] further afield. The major junction on the flyover is for [[Old Town, Croydon|Old Town]], which is also a large three-lane road.

Croydon covers an area of 86.52&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the 256th [[List of English districts by area|largest district in England]]. Croydon's physical features consist of many hills and rivers that are spread out across the borough and into the [[North Downs]], [[Surrey]] and the rest of South London. [[Addington Hills]] is a major [[floodplain]] in London for the [[Thames Valley]] and is recognised as a significant obstacle to the growth of London from its origins as a port on the north side of the river, to a large circular city. The [[Great North Wood]] is a former natural oak forest that covered the [[Sydenham|Sydenham Ridge]] and the southern reaches of the [[River Effra]] and its tributaries. The most notable tree, called Vicar's Oak, marked the boundary of four ancient parishes; [[Lambeth]], [[Camberwell]], Croydon and [[Bromley]]. John Aubrey&lt;ref&gt;John Aubrey ''Natural History and Antiquities of the County of Surrey'', 1718, vol. 2, p. 33,&lt;/ref&gt; referred to this &quot;ancient remarkable tree&quot; in the past tense as early as 1718, but according to JB Wilson,&lt;ref&gt;J.B.

===Architecture===
{{further|[[Architecture of Croydon]] and [[List of tallest buildings and structures in Croydon]]}}
The skyline of Croydon has significantly changed over the past 50 years. High rise buildings, mainly office blocks, now dominate the skyline. The most notable of these buildings include Croydon Council's headquarters [[Taberner House]], which has been compared to the famous [[Pirelli Tower]] of [[Milan]], and the [[Nestlé Tower]], the UK headquarters of [[Nestlé]].

In recent years, the development of [[Tall buildings in London|tall buildings]], such as the approved [[Croydon Vocational Tower]] and [[Wellesley Square]], has been encouraged in the [[London Plan]], which will lead to the erection of new skyscrapers over the next few years as London goes through a high-rise boom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London - Full Summary of Projects|publisher=Will Fox, SkyscraperCity.com|url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=46|accessdate=2006-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[No.1 Croydon]], formerly the NLA Tower, Britain's 88th tallest tower,&lt;ref name=&quot;NLA Tower&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/snuk_list.htm|title=Britain's Tallest 100 Buildings by Height|publisher=Sky Scraper News|accessdate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; close to [[East Croydon station]], is an example of 1970s architecture. The tower was originally nicknamed the ''Threepenny bit building'', as it resembles a stack of pre-decimalisation [[Threepence (British coin)|Threepence]] coins, which were 12-sided. Since [[Decimal Day|decimalisation]] it has gained the alternative nickname ''50 pence building'', based on the more familiar [[British fifty pence coin|50 pence coin]].

[[Lunar House]] is another high-rise building. Like other government office buildings on Wellesley Road, such as '''Apollo House''', the name of the building was inspired by the [[Project Apollo|US moon landings]] (In the Croydon suburb of New Addington there is a [[public house]], built during the same period, called ''The Man '''on''' the Moon'').

A new generation of buildings are being considered by the council as part of [[Croydon Vision 2020]], so that the borough doesn't lose its title of having the &quot;largest office space in the south east&quot;, excluding Central London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Croydon Gateway - Arrowcroft Scheme|publisher=Emporis|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/bu/nc/ne/?id=101018|accessdate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects such as [[Wellesley Square]], which will be a mix of residential and retail with an eye-catching colour design and [[100 George Street]] a proposed modern office block are incorporated in this vision.

Notable events that have happened to Croydon's skyline include the Millennium project to create the largest single urban lighting project ever. It was created for the buildings of Croydon to illuminate them for the third millennium. Not only did this project give new lighting to the buildings, but it provided an opportunity to project onto them images and words, mixing art and poetry with coloured light, and also displaying public information after dark. Apart from increasing night time activity in Croydon and thereby reducing the fear of crime, it helped to promote the sustainable use of older buildings by displaying them in a more positive way.&lt;ref name=&quot;skyline&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millennium.gov.uk/cgi-site/awards.cgi?action=detail&amp;id=38&amp;t=2|title=Croydon Skyline|accessdate=2007-10-12|publisher=Millennium Commission|year=2003|work=Croydon Skyline Millennium Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost 500,000 years ago, Mitcham Common formed part of the river bed of the River Thames.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitcham Common friends&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2008|url=http://www.mitchamcommon.org/about.html|title=About Mitcham Common|publisher=Mitcham Common Conservators|accessdate=2008-06-06}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BRIT School]] is a performing Arts &amp; Technology school, owned by the BRIT Trust (known for the [[BRIT Awards|BRIT Awards Music Ceremony]]). Famous former students include [[Kellie Shirley]], [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[Kate Nash]], [[Dane Bowers]], [[Katie Melua]] and [[Lyndon David-Hall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BRIT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2008|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article2184707.ece/|title=Croydon's little gem - The BRIT school|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Croydon Grants|Grants]] is an entertainment venue in the centre of Croydon which includes a [[Vue (cinema)|Vue cinema]] and the [[Tiger Tiger (nightclub)|Tiger Tiger]] nightclub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grantscentrecroydon.co.uk/|title=Croydon Grants website|publisher=Grants Centre Croydon|accessdate=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taberner House]] houses the main offices of [[Croydon Council]], and was built between 1964 and 1967. It has been compared to the [[Pirelli Tower]] in [[Milan]]. [[Surrey Street Market]] has a Royal Charter dating back to 1276 linking it to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The market is regularly used as a location for TV, film and advertising. [[Beanos]], a collectors' record store that has been in Croydon for over three decades, was once the largest second-hand record shop in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Plummer, Robert: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6214278.stm Record collectors' shop faces the music], ''[[BBC News]]'', 20 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Parish Church of St John the Baptist is a large church dating from the 15th century. It was largely destroyed by fire in 1867 and rebuilt by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]]. It is the burial place of six Archbishops of Canterbury with monuments to Archbishops Sheldon and Whitgift. [[BedZED]], Beddington Zero Energy Development, is on the outskirts of the borough.

==Transport==
{{Main|List of stations in the London Borough of Croydon|Tramlink}}
There are two main interchanges for all public transport modes ([[Inter-city rail|national]] and [[Commuter rail|local rail]], [[Tramlink|tram]], and [[Bus|local buses]]) at [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]] and [[East Croydon station]].

===National and international travel===
Croydon is linked into the national motorway network via the [[M23 motorway|M23]] and [[M25 motorway|M25]] orbital motorway. The M25 skirts the south of the borough, linking Croydon with other parts [[London]] and the surrounding counties; the M23 branches from the M25 close to Coulsdon, linking the town with the [[Southern England|South Coast]], [[Crawley]], [[Reigate]], and [[London Gatwick Airport]]. The [[A23 road|A23]] connects the borough with the motorways. The A23 is the major trunk road through Croydon, linking it with Central London, East Sussex, Horsham, and Littlehaven. The old London to Brighton road, passes through the west of the borough on [[Purley Way]], bypassing the commercial centre of Croydon which it once did.

[[File:East Croydon Railway Station - England - Station Frontage - Evening - 270404.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[East Croydon station]]]]

The [[Brighton Main Line]] [[Rail transport in Great Britain|railway route]] south from Croydon links the town to Sussex, Surrey, and Kent and to Central London to the north: providing direct services to Hastings, Southampton, Brighton, Portsmouth, Gatwick Airport, Bedford and Luton. The main station for all these services is [[East Croydon station]] in the centre of the town centre. [[East Croydon station]] is the largest and busiest station in Croydon, third busiest in London, excluding [[Travelcard Zone 1]]. The station at [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]] serves all trains travelling west except the fastest. There are also more regional stations scattered around the borough. Passenger rail services through Croydon are provided by [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]] and [[First Capital Connect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;national rail&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/system/galleries/download/print_maps/Nat_Rail_Passenger_Operators_2006.pdf|title=UK rail network map|accessdate=2008-05-25|publisher=[[National Rail]]|year=2006|work=National Rail website}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pilot scheme launched by the [[Strategic Rail Authority]], [[Transport for London]] and three train operators is designed to encourage more passengers to travel off-peak. In full partnership with the [[South London|South London Boroughs]] which includes Croydon, SWELTRAC, SELTRANS and the transport users group, the scheme promotes the advantages of off-peak travel following improvements to safety, travel connections and upgrading of station facilities. The [[Thameslink Programme]] (formerly known as Thameslink 2000), is a £3.5&amp;nbsp;billion major project to expand the [[Thameslink|Thameslink network]] from 51 to 172 [[train station|stations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=2413&amp;NewsAreaID=2&amp;SearchCategoryID=8|title=Good news for South London as £3.5BN Thameslink project clears major hurdle|date=2006-10-18|accessdate=2007-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; spreading northwards to [[Bedford]], [[Peterborough]], [[Cambridge]] and [[King's Lynn]] and southwards to [[Guildford]], [[Eastbourne]], [[Horsham]], [[Hove]] to [[Littlehampton]], [[East Grinstead]], [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] and [[Dartford]]. The project includes the lengthening of platforms, station remodelling, new railway infrastructure (e.g. viaduct) and additional rolling stock. When implemented, First Capital Connect services would call at other stations in the borough including Purley and Norwood Junction.

The closest international airport to Croydon is [[London Gatwick Airport]], which is located {{convert|19|mi|km}} from the town centre. Gatwick airport opened on August 1930 as an aerodrome and is a major international operational base for [[British Airways]], [[EasyJet]] and [[Virgin Atlantic Airways|Virgin Atlantic]]. It currently handles around 35 million passengers a year, making it London's second largest airport, and the second busiest airport in the United Kingdom after [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]]. [[London Heathrow Airport]], [[London City Airport]] and [[London Luton Airport]] all lie within a two hours' drive of Croydon. Gatwick and Luton Airports are connected to Croydon by [[Thameslink|frequent direct trains]], while Heathrow is accsesible by the [[London Buses route X26|route X26]] bus.

===Local travel===
The [[A23 road|A23]] and [[A22 road]]s are the major trunk roads through Croydon. These both run north-south, connecting to each other in [[Purley, London|Purley]]. The A22 connects Croydon, its starting point, to [[East Grinstead]], [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[Uckfield]], and [[Eastbourne]]. Other major roads generally radiate spoke-like from the city centre. [[Wellesley Road]] is an urban [[dual carriageway]] which cuts through the middle of the [[central business district]]. It was constructed in the 1960s as part of a planned ring road for Croydon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/indepth/croydonringroad/|title=CBRD - In Depth - Croydon Ring Road|accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes an [[Croydon Underpass|underpass]], which allows traffic to avoid going into the town centre.

The hilly topography of Croydon and the lack of underground services in that part of South London is a reason for the extensive suburban and inter-urban railway network. Croydon is in the commuter belt to London as part of suburbia. There are several busy local rail routes running along the borough's towns, connecting it with [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] and [[London Victoria]]. These local routes mainly run on the [[Brighton Main Line]] and [[Sutton &amp; Mole Valley Lines]]. As well as the main stations of East Croydon and West Croydon, there are several suburban stations at [[Norwood Junction railway station|Norwood Junction]], [[Purley railway station|Purley]], [[Coulsdon South railway station|Coulsdon South]] and [[Kenley railway station|Kenley]] and more.

[[File:Addington Village bus and tram station.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Tramlink]] at Addington Interchange]]
The light rail system ''[[Tramlink]]'' (Operated by [[Tramtrack Croydon]], a wholly owned subsidy of Transport for London),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx|title=TfL announces plans to take over Tramlink services|date=2008-03-17|accessdate=2008-05-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080412011803/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened in 2000, serves the borough and surrounding areas. Its network consists of three lines, from [[Elmers End]] to West Croydon, from [[Beckenham]] to West Croydon, and from [[New Addington]] to [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], with all three lines running via the Croydon loop on which it is centred on. It has been highly successful, environmentally-friendly and a reliable light rail system carrying around 22 million passengers a year. It is also the only tram system in London but there is another light rail system [[Docklands Light Railway|in the Docklands]]. It serves [[Mitcham]], [[Woodside, London|Woodside]], [[Addiscombe]] and the [[Purley Way]] retail and industrial area amongst others. An extension to [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] is currently being developed by Transport for London with the support of the council and the South London Partnership. This would improve public transport access to [[Upper Norwood]] and [[Crystal Palace Park]] and help to stimulate regeneration across the wider area. The extension could be in service by 2013. Other possible extensions include [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], a new park and ride close to the M25, [[Coulsdon]], [[Purley, London|Purley]], [[Kingston Upon Thames]], [[Tolworth]], [[Tooting]], [[Brixton]] for an interchange with the proposed [[Cross River Tram]], [[Bromley]] and [[Lewisham]] for an interchange with the Docklands Light Railway.

A sizeable bus infrastructure which is part of the [[London Buses]] network operates from a main hub at [[West Croydon station]]. The bus station at [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]] is undergoing a major re-development to make it more modern and future-proof. There are also plans to create a new bus terminal at [[Park Place (Croydon)|Park Place]] if the shopping centre is built. [[Addington Interchange]] is a regional bus terminal in [[Addington, London|Addington Village]] which has an interchange between [[Tramlink route 3|route three]] and bus services in the remote area. [[Arriva London]], part of [[Arriva]], is one of the largest bus operators to serve Croydon along with [[Metrobus (South East England)|Metrobus]], [[Selkent]], and [[Travel London|National Express London]]. Unlike other places in the country, London's transport infrastructure is regulated and therefore is not subject to price wars between different companies with TfL setting a standard price for bus services which is currently set at 90p with an [[Oyster card]]. Services include buses to Central London, Purley Way, Bromley, Lewisham and a number of other [[civic centre]]s in the south. [[London Buses route X26]], the longest route in London, provides services to Heathrow Airport via [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond]] and Sutton.

Although hilly, Croydon is compact and has few major trunk roads running through it. It is on one of the [[Connect2]] schemes which are part of the [[National Cycle Network]] route running around [[Croydon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustransconnect2.org.uk/schemes/project_detail.php?id=147|title=London - Croydon Park Links|year=2008|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[North Downs]], an area of outstanding natural beauty popular with both on- and off-road cyclists, is so close to Croydon that part of the park lies within the borough boundary, and there are routes into the park almost from the civic centre.

Following the extension of the [[East London Line]] in 2010, two stations in Croydon are now served by [[London Overground]] services; [[Norwood Junction]] and [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]]. Currently Croydon is one of only five London Boroughs not to have at least one [[London Underground]] station within its boundaries, and the closest tube station is in [[Morden tube station|Morden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;London Town&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.londontown.com/LondonStreets/the_croydon_flyover_44f.html|title = Local guide to The Croydon Flyover|publisher=LondonTown|accessdate=2007-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public services==
[[File:Cane Hill Asylum.jpg|thumb|[[Cane Hill]]]]
[[Home Office]] policing in Croydon is provided by the [[Metropolitan Police]]. The force's Croydon arm have their head offices for policing on [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] next to the [[Fairfield Halls]] and [[Croydon College]] in central Croydon. [[Public transport]] is co-ordinated by [[Transport for London]]. [[Fire service in the United Kingdom|Statutory emergency fire and rescue service]] is provided by the [[London Fire Brigade]], which has five stations in Croydon.&lt;ref name=&quot;London Fire Brigade&quot;/&gt;

===Health services===
[[NHS Croydon - Croydon Primary Care Trust]] is the body responsible for [[public health]] and for planning and funding health services in the borough. Croydon has 227 GPs in 64 practices, 156 dentists in 51 practices, 166 pharmacists and 70 optometrists in 28 practices.&lt;ref&gt;Primary care services in Croydon http://www.croydon.nhs.uk/aboutus/whoweare/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mayday University Hospital]], built on a {{convert|19|acre|m2|sing=on}} site in Thornton Heath at the west of Croydon's boundaries with [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]], is a large [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] hospital administrated by [[NHS Trust|Mayday Healthcare NHS Trust]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS Trust&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/downloads/primary_care_10_02.pdf|title=Strategic Health Authorities|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=2008-07-17|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080627171309/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/downloads/primary_care_10_02.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former names of the hospital include the Croydon Union Infirmary from 1885 to 1923 and the Mayday Road Hospital from 1923 to around 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayday Hospital&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2001|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/hospitalrecords/details.asp?id=168&amp;page=37|title=The National Archives:Mayday Hospital, Croydon|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a District General Hospital with a 24-hour [[Emergency department|accident and emergency]] department. [[NHS Direct]] has a regional centre based at the hospital. The [[NHS Trust]] also provides services at Purley War Memorial Hospital, in [[Purley, London|Purley]]. Croydon General Hospital was on London Road but services transferred to Mayday, as the size of this hospital was insufficient to cope with the growing population of the borough. Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Centre and the Emergency Minor Treatment Centre are other smaller hospitals operated by the Mayday in the borough. [[Cane Hill]] was a [[psychiatric hospital]] in Coulsdon.

===Waste management===
[[Waste management]] is co-ordinated by the [[local authority]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Waste management&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/waste/docs/wastestrat_all.pdf|title=Rethinking rubbish in London|publisher=[[Greater London Authority]]|accessdate=2008-07-11|format=PDF}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other [[waste disposal authorities in Greater London]], Croydon's rubbish is collected independently and isn't part of a waste authority unit.

Croydon has the joint best recycling rate in London, at 36%. Croydon's [[Distribution Network Operator]] for electricity is [[EDF Energy|EDF Energy Networks]]; there are no [[power station]]s in the borough. [[Thames Water]] manages Croydon's [[drinking water|drinking]] and [[waste water]]; water supplies being sourced from several local reservoirs, including [[Beckton]] and [[King George VI Reservoir|King George VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/cps/rde/xchg/SID-C56947C1-538A347A/corp/hs.xsl/2802.htm|title=Sustainable supplies for the future|publisher= Thames Water|author=Beckton Desalination Plant|year=2007|accessdate=2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1971, Croydon Corporation was responsible for water treatment in the borough.

===London Fire Brigade===
The borough of Croydon is 86.52&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;sq&lt;/sup&gt;, populating approximately 340,000 people. There are five fire stations within the borough; Addington (two pumping appliances), Croydon (two pumping appliances, incident response unit, fire rescue unit and a USAR appliance), Norbury (two pumping appliances), Purley (one pumping appliance) and Woodside (one pumping appliance). Purley has the largest station ground, but dealt with the fewest incidents during 2006/07.&lt;ref name=&quot;London Fire Brigade&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/media/Croydon.pdf|title=London Fire Brigade: Croydon Profile|publisher=London Fire Brigade|accessdate = 2008-05-20|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fire stations, as part of the Community Fire Safety scheme, visited 49 schools in 2006/2007.&lt;ref name = &quot;London Fire Brigade&quot;/&gt;

===Libraries===
The borough of Croydon has 14 libraries, a joint library and a mobile library. Many of the libraries where built a long time ago and therefore have become outdated, so the council started updating a few including [[Ashburton Library]] which moved from its former spot into the state-of-the-art [[Ashburton Learning Village]] complex which is on the former site of the old 'A Block' of [[Ashburton Community School]] which is now situated inside the centre. The library is now on one floor. This format was planned to be rolled out across all of the council's libraries but what was seen as costing too much.

[[South Norwood Library]], [[New Addington Library]], Shirley Library, Selsdon Library, Sanderstead Library, Purley Library, Coulsdon Library and Bradmore Green Library are examples of older council libraries. The main library is [[Croydon Central Library]] which holds many references, newspaper archives and a tourist information point (one of three in southeast [[London]]). [[Upper Norwood Library]] is a joint library with the [[London Borough of Lambeth]]. This means that both councils fund the library and its resources, but even though Lambeth have nearly doubled their funding for the library in the past several years Croydon has kept it the same,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tessa Jowell Labour campaign article&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.tessajowell.net/?PageId=4bd1346c-8ec2-36f4-ed45-ba76a9cef35eschoolType=all|title=Tessa Jowell joins campaign for joint funding of Upper Norwood Library|publisher=Labour Party|accessdate=2007-07-24}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; doubting the future of the library.

The predominant religion of the borough is [[Christianity]]. According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001]], the borough has over 215,124 Christians, mainly Protestants. This is the largest religious following in the borough followed by Islam with 17,642 Muslims resident. This is a small portion of the more than 600,000 Muslims in London as a whole. Over 48,615 Croydon residents are [[atheist]]s or non-religious.

There are more than 35 churches in the borough, with [[Croydon Parish Church]] being the main one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Churches in LB Croydon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2003|url=http://www.eden.co.uk/churches/croydon/index.html|title=Croydon Churches|publisher=Eden/National Church Database|accessdate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This church was founded in Saxon times, since there is a record of &quot;a priest of Croydon&quot; in 960, although the first record of a church building is in the [[Domesday Book]] (1086). In its final medieval form, the church was mainly a Perpendicular-style structure, but this was severely damaged by fire in 1867, following which only the tower, south porch and outer walls remained. Under the direction of Sir George Gilbert Scott the church was rebuilt, incorporating the remains and essentially following the design of the medieval building, and was reconsecrated in 1870.

Croydon has strong religious links, from a royal charter for [[Surrey Street Market]] dating back to 1276, to [[Croydon Palace]] which was the summer residence of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] for over 500 years. With visitors such as [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] and [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. The [[Bishop of Croydon]] is a position as a [[Bishop#Bishops in Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican churches|suffragan]] [[Bishop]] in the [[Anglican]] [[Anglican Diocese of Southwark|Diocese of Southwark]]. The current bishop is Rt Rev [[Nicholas Baines|Nicholas (Nick) Baines]].

==Sport and leisure==
{{further|[[Croydon parks and open spaces]]}}
The borough has been criticized in the past for not having enough leisure facilities, maintaining the position of Croydon as a three star borough.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croydon's three star borough rating&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://www.croydonconservatives.com/news_search_results_printer.asp?StoryNo=942|title=Three Star Croydon 'Improving Well'|publisher=Croydon Conservatives|accessdate=2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the moment only three leisure centres are open for public use and two of these are expected to be closed down in the near future, with plans for only one of them to be re-built. Thornton Heath's ageing sports centre was recently knocked down, and replaced by a newer more modern leisure centre. [[South Norwood Leisure Centre]] was closed down in early 2006 so that it could be knocked completely down and re-designed from scratch like Thornton Heath, which would cost around £10 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;South Norwood Pools close for demolition&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.londonpoolscampaign.com/discuss/msgReader$806|title=South Norwood Pools close|publisher=London Pools Campaign|accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Countrypark2.jpg|thumb|South Norwood Country Park]] In May 2006 the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] became in charge of Croydon and decided that doing this would cost too much money, so they came up with another idea of just re-furbishing the centre, although this decision did not come without controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;South Norwood Forum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/interactive/messageforum/view.php?threadid=829.com|title=Message Forum on South Norwood Pools|publisher=Croydon Guardian|accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leisure Centre petition&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/interactive/messageforum/view.php?threadid=829.com|title=Pool plans are approved despite 3,000 signature petition|publisher=Croydon Guardian|accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purley Pool is to close soon, but a new &quot;super-pool&quot; is planned in Coulsdon. The ageing New Addington Leisure Centre is also set to close but is to be re-built. A new leisure centre is also going to be built on the [[A23 road|A23]], southern end of [[Purley Way]] in [[Waddon]].

Fusion currently provides leisure services for the council, a contract previously held by Parkwood Leisure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parkwood Leisure&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/1703989.Charity_to_run_Croydon_s_leisure_services/|title=Parkwood Leisure - Home Page|publisher=[[Croydon Guardian]]|accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Football teams include [[Crystal Palace F.C.]], which plays at [[Selhurst Park]], in the [[nPower Championship]]. [[Coulsdon United F.C.]] (formerly [[Coulsdon Town F.C.]] before the merge with [[Salfords F.C.]]) are a team that currently play in the [[Combined Counties Football League|Combined Counties League]] Division One. [[Croydon Athletic F.C.]], whose local nickname is The Rams, is a football club based in [[Thornton Heath|Thornton Heath's]] Keith Tuckey Stadium and play in the [[Isthmian League]] Division One South, with [[Croydon F.C.]] who play at [[Croydon Sports Arena]] and [[Holmesdale F.C.|Holmesdale]], who were founded in [[South Norwood]] but currently playing on Oakley Road in [[Bromley]], currently in the [[Kent League]]. Non-football teams that play in Croydon are [[Streatham-Croydon RFC]], a historic [[rugby union]] club in [[Thornton Heath]] who play at Frant Road, as well as [[South London Storm Rugby League Club]], based at [[Streatham-Croydon RFC|Streatham's]] ground, who compete in the [[Rugby League Conference]].

==Culture==
[[File:Fairfield 07-12-19.JPG|Fairfield Halls in Central Croydon is the main entertainment venue in the borough|thumb|right]]
Croydon aims to become one of the hearts of culture in London and the South East of England. This has been proved with the dedication the council has shown to projects such as the proposed [[Croydon Arena]]. Although, despite the aim, it has also cut funding to the [[Warehouse Theatre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Warehouse Theatre&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/search/display.var.956329.0.the_warehouse_fights_council_cut.php|title=The Warehouse Theatre fights council cut plans|publisher=Croydon Guardian|accessdate=2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Croydon Council drew up a ''Public Art Strategy'', with a vision that is accessible and enhances people's enjoyment of their surroundings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Public Art&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydon.gov.uk/content/departments/570801/570935/artstrategy05-08.pdf|title=A Public Art Strategy for Croydon 2005-2008|publisher=Croydon Council|accessdate=2007-09-28|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071026182534/http://www.croydon.gov.uk/content/departments/570801/570935/artstrategy05-08.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public art strategy delivered a new event called ''Croydon's Summer Festival'' hosted in [[Croydon parks and open spaces|Lloyd Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydonfestival.com/transport.html|title=Where is Croydon's Summer Festival?|publisher=Croydon Festival|accessdate=2008-07-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080715214204/http://www.croydonfestival.com/transport.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival consists of two days of events.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/06/22/croydon_festival_feature.shtml|title=Croydon Summer Festival|publisher=[[BBC London]]|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is called ''Croydon's World Party'' which is a free one day event with three stages featuring world, jazz and dance music from the UK and internationally. The final days event is the ''Croydon Mela'', a day of music with a mix of traditional Asian culture and east meets western club beats across four stages as well as dozens of food stalls and a funfair. It has attracted crowds of over 50,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;crowds&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2008|url=http://www.efestivals.co.uk/festivals/croydon/2008/|title=Croydon Summer Festival 2008|publisher=eFestivals.co.uk|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stratergy also created a creative industries hub in [[Old Town, Croydon|Old Town]], ensure public art is included in developments such as [[Croydon College|College Green]] and [[Croydon Gateway]] and investigate the possibility of gallery space in the Cultural Quarter.

The Warehouse Theare is a professional producing theatre opened in 1977 with one hundred seats based in an oak-beamed former cement Victorian warehouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;warehousehistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2008|url=http://www.warehousetheatre.co.uk/history.html|title=The Early Years of the Warehouse Theatre|publisher=Warehouse Theatre|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been acclaimed for its commitment to new writing, led by its present director, [[Ted Craig]], including its annual [[International Playwriting Festival]], in partnership with the Extra Candoni Festival of [[Udine]] in Italy and Theatro Ena in Cyprus. Youth theatre is also important, with the resident Croydon Young Peoples' Theatre and including an annual collaboration with the Croydon-based [[Brit School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;warehousebrit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2008|url=http://www.warehousetheatre.co.uk/crypt.html|title=Croydon Young People's Theatre|publisher=Warehouse Theatre|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is on the Gateway site which is going through a regeneration project. Stanhope's plan for the site is to include a 200 seat theatre custom-designed by Foster + Partners in their Ruskin Square development surrounded by a large new park. This will be paid for in full by Stanhope at a cost approaching £5 million. The Board of the Warehouse Theatre believes that this is the best option for securing a fully funded, workable and unique building.&lt;ref name=&quot;wtstanhope&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/search/display.var.978268.0.gateway_plan_includes_warehouse.php|title=Gateway plan includes Warehouse|publisher=Croydon Guardian|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrowcroft's proposal is for an Arena-led scheme which initially didn't include the theatre. But this was changed to incorporate a replacement theatre as part of a condition of planning. It is proposed that it occupies one of the leisure units behind the Arena facing onto the plaza with a children's playground in front. The plan is to build a 200 seat theatre inside the leisure unit. The biggest problem with this scheme is that it would be built in one phase and requires the theatre to vacate the current theatre before the development begins. The theatre would then be without a home for a period of three years or more and would need a temporary location and additional funding to make this possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;newtheatre&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2008|url=http://www.warehousetheatre.co.uk/newtheatre.html|title=A Warehouse Theatre for the Future|publisher=Warehouse Theatre|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre will be launching its largest fundraising appeal in its 30 year history over the Autumn of 2008 to help it launch itself into the new building. Fundraising will be required for finishing touches to the new building, technical equipment, launch programme and a host of other vital expenditure to ensure the Warehouse Theatre is launched into its new future on a firm footing.

[[Fairfield Halls]], Arnhem Gallery and the [[Ashcroft Theatre]] show productions that are held throughout the year such as drama, ballet, opera and pantomimes and can be converted to show films. It also contains the Arnhem Gallery civic hall and an [[art gallery]]. Other cultural activities, including shopping and exhibitions, are [[Surrey Street Market]] which is mainly a meat and vegetables market near the main shopping environment of Croydon. The market has a Royal Charter dating back to 1276. [[Croydon Airport|Airport House]] is a newly refurbished conference and exhibition centre inside part of [[Croydon Airport]]. The [[Whitgift Centre]], the current main shopping centre in the borough is also one of the largest in-town shopping centres in the whole of [[Europe]]. [[Centrale]], a new shopping centre that houses many more familiar names, as well as Croydon's [[House of Fraser]]. [[North End, Croydon|North End]], the main shopping street, which holds both centres. [[Park Place (Croydon)|Park Place]], a shopping centre that is planned to be built in Central Croydon by [[Minerva plc|Minerva]]. Croydon Arena is a proposed arena for the Gateway site which if built would feature more commercial exhibitions and sporting events next to East Croydon station.

==Media==
There are three local newspapers which operate within the borough, each with considerable history in the area. The [[Croydon Advertiser]] began life in 1869,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashrare.com/newspaper_history.html Newspaper History] at Ash Rare Books, accessed 2006-08-14&lt;/ref&gt; and is the third-highest selling paid-for weekly newspaper in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newspapersoc.org.uk/Default.aspx?page=1556 Newspaper Society London circulation tables, July-December 2005] accessed 2006-08-09 {{Wayback | url=http://www.newspapersoc.org.uk/Default.aspx?page=1556 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; | date=20060526044657 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Advertiser is also Croydon's major paid-for weekly paper and is on sale every Friday in five geographical editions: Croydon; Sutton &amp; [[Epsom]]; Coulsdon &amp; Purley; New Addington; and [[Caterham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Trinity&quot;&gt;[http://www.trinitymirrorsouthern.com/titledetails.cfm?parentid=4&amp;groupid=26&amp;titleid=70 Trinity Mirror Southern series description] accessed 2006-08-09&lt;/ref&gt; The paper converted from a broadsheet to a compact (tabloid) format on 31 March 2006. It was bought by [[Northcliffe Media]] which is part of the [[Daily Mail and General Trust]] group on 6 July 2007. In 2008 it was given a new website as part of the ''This is'' network of brands across the United Kingdom. The [[Croydon Post]] is a free newspaper available across the borough and is operated by the Advertiser group. The circulation of the newspaper is notably more than the main title published by the Advertiser Group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croydon Post&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2008|url=http://www.abc.org.uk/cgi-bin/gen5?runprog=nav/abc&amp;noc=y|title=Circulation of Croydon Borough Post|publisher=ABC|accessdate=2008-05-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080430043820/http://www.abc.org.uk/cgi-bin/gen5?runprog=nav/abc&amp;noc=y &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Croydon Guardian]] is another local weekly paper, which is paid for at newsagents but free at Croydon Council libraries and via deliveries. The newspaper is published every Wednesday. The paper is owned by regional newspaper publisher [[Newsquest Media Group]] and is inside the South London arm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croydon Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/|title=Croydon Guardian local newspaper pages|publisher=Croydon Guardian|accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the best circulated local newspapers in London and has the highest circulation in Croydon with around one thousand more copies distributed than The Post.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croydon Guardian circulation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2008|url=http://www.abc.org.uk/cgi-bin/gen5?runprog=nav/abc&amp;noc=y|title=Circulation of the Croydon Guardian|publisher=ABC|accessdate=2008-05-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080430043820/http://www.abc.org.uk/cgi-bin/gen5?runprog=nav/abc&amp;noc=y &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The borough is served by the London regional versions of [[BBC London|BBC]] and [[Carlton Television|ITV]] coverage, from either the [[Crystal Palace transmitting station|Crystal Palace]] or [[Croydon transmitting station|Croydon transmitters]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Crystal Palace aerial transmission gallery&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://tx.mb21.co.uk/gallery/crystalpalace/index.php|title=The Transmission Gallery, Crystal Palace|publisher=mb21|accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crystal Palace aerial information&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0016652|title=Structure information of Crystal Palace Transmitter|publisher=Structurae|accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The London Borough of Croydon is twinned with the [[municipality]] of Arnhem which is located in the east of the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnhem Link&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/places/arnhem.asp|title=Croydon and Arnhem Link|publisher=Croydon Online|accessdate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Arnhem]] is one of the [[List of cities in the Netherlands with over 100,000 people|10 largest cities in the Netherlands]]. They have been twinned since 1946 after both towns had suffered extensive bomb damage during the recently ended war.

'''Chick Publications''' is an American publishing company founded and run by [[Jack T. Chick]] which produces and markets [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Protestant fundamentalist]] pamphlets, [[DVD]]s, [[Video CD|VCDs]], [[video]]s, [[book]]s, and [[poster]]s. Chick Publications' best-known products are [[Chick tract]]s, which are [[comics|comic]] [[tract (literature)|tract]]s that are available in nearly 100 languages.  Arguably all of its products promote and seek to win converts to Christian fundamentalism. While some tracts express views that are generally accepted within Christian theology, e.g. the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation of Christ]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0039/0039_01.asp Charlie's Ants]'', Jack Chick, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; other tracts have controversial views and criticisms against cultures, religions and theological concepts. The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] labels the organization as a [[hate group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Active U.S. Hate&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Overview==
The company's web site lists more than 150 comic tracts; all of them can be viewed online, but other materials can generally only be sampled.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.chick.com/catalog/tractlist.asp English Chick Cartoon Tracts]&quot;, Chick Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The site states that several hundred million tracts have been distributed worldwide, with some of them translated into almost 100 languages. However, for the majority of languages, only one tract is available: ''This Was Your Life''. This tract is unique in that, apart from the large number of languages it is published in, it also appears in six different artwork versions, depicting the major racial groups.

Like many other religious publishing organizations, Chick Publications does not distribute their tracts for free; they are normally purchased in bulk by the people handing them out.

[[Image:'love the jewish people' chick tract in restroom.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tract (literature)|Tract]] by [[Jack T. Chick]] entitled &quot;Love The Jewish People&quot; inside a [[public toilet|restroom stall]].]]

While Chick's tracts are meant to be handed out directly (for instance, he encourages Christians to give out anti-[[Halloween]] tracts along with Halloween candy&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.chick.com/seasonal/halloween/default.asp?FROM=Tracttips Halloween...witnessing doesn't get any easier]&quot;, Chick Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;), they are often distributed by leaving them in places where they will be found and read (for example, public restrooms), an appealing witnessing tool for shy Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;too-shy&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.chick.com/bc/1996/witnessingideas.asp I Am Too Shy To Talk To People]&quot;, ''Battle Cry'', September/October 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy is intended to reach those who are hostile to [[evangelism|evangelists]] and unlikely to accept an offered tract, by appealing instead to their curiosity.&lt;ref name=&quot;too-shy&quot; /&gt; The Chick Publications website claims that many people have been converted by encountering Chick Publication's comic tracts.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.chick.com/articles/testimonies/ What Happens To Chick Tracts AFTER You Pass Them Out?]&quot;, Chick Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chick Publications also publishes conventional non-graphical books on these same topics, by authors other than Chick. Many of these are also used as sources for Chick's tracts; notable sources include [[Alberto Rivera]], [[Rebecca Brown (Christian author)|Rebecca Brown]], [[Jeff Godwin]], [[Kent Hovind]], [[Charles Chiniquy]], [[William Schnoebelen]], [[John Todd (occultist)|John Todd]], [[Avro Manhattan]], and [[Alexander Hislop]].

Copies of Chick's tracts were requested by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] to be displayed among other examples of American religious culture.&lt;ref name=OfficialBio&gt;{{cite web

Chick Publications, and its founder and namesake [[Jack T. Chick]], have been regularly criticized for publishing strong opinions seen as negative such as opposition to [[Freemasonry]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.chick.com/information/religions/masonry Information on Masonry]&quot;, Chick Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.chick.com/information/religions/catholicism Information on Roman Catholicism]&quot;, Chick Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the products also oppose [[secular]]ized holidays such as [[Halloween]] and [[Thanksgiving]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1025/1025_01.asp The Missing Day]'', Jack Chick, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as several forms of entertainment such as [[role-playing game]]s and [[popular music]]. Defenders of the comics assert all his comics carry the same message: salvation through [[Jesus]].  Tracts typically follow the themes of punishment or redemption in the afterlife, or set up a confrontation between a Christian and non-Christian in order to spread a religious message. Many Chick tracts end with a non-Christian being converted to Christianity. Other endings provide a contrast between those who accept Jesus and those who reject Jesus; in some tracts, a convert receives entry to [[heaven]], while in other tracts, a non-believer is condemned to [[hell]].

Most Chick tracts end with a suggested prayer for the reader to pray to accept Christ.  In most of these tracts it is a standard [[sinner's prayer]] for [[salvation]]. In the tracts dealing with [[Catholicism]] or Islam, the prayer includes a clause to reject these religions. Included with the prayer are directions for converting to Christianity.&lt;!--Even though Catholics believe in Christ--&gt;

The graphics in Chick's tracts are often simple, but eye-catching. Some Christians consider them to be valuable [[evangelism|witnessing]] tools, due to the striking nature of the cartoons and their clear-cut messages.

== Claims ==
{{primarysources|section|date=May 2011}}
Chick's tracts and other publications make many controversial claims. Some are typical of conservative [[Protestant]] beliefs. For example, Chick claims that the theory of [[evolution]] is false,&lt;ref name=&quot;big-daddy&quot;&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0055/0055_01.asp Big Daddy?]'', Jack Chick, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[homosexuality]] is sinful,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/5003/5003_01.asp Sin City]'', Jack Chick, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[abortion]] is murder.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1009/1009_01.asp Who Murdered Clarice?]'', Jack Chick, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0077/0077_01.asp Baby Talk]'', Jack Chick, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others are controversial even within conservative Protestantism.  In particular, Chick's tracts make frequent reference to a vast [[Satanism|Satanic]] conspiracy controlling many of the world's organizations and institutions. Religions other than Protestantism, especially the Roman Catholic Church, are generally presented as instruments of [[Satan]]. Chick claims that the [[King James Version of the Bible]] is the [[King-James-Only Movement|only recorded word of God]], and all other editions are corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chick.com/information/general/statementoffaith.asp Statement of Faith]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chick.com/ask/articles/ans001.asp Why Shouldn't I just read the Greek and Hebrew?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chick.com/ask/articles/21centurykjv.asp What about the 21st Century King James Bible?]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian ecumenism]] is rejected as a ploy to corrupt true Christianity by encouraging acceptance of corrupted beliefs.

Chick's claims about Catholic, Masonic, Satanic, etc., conspiracies are based in large part on the testimony of people who claim to have been members of these groups before converting to [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Christianity, most prominently [[Alberto Rivera]], [[William Schnoebelen]], [[John Todd (occultist)|John Todd]], and [[Mike Warnke]]. The reliability of these sources is hotly disputed, as detailed in their individual articles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

=== Catholicism ===
A recurring theme in Chick's tracts is the role of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], which he presents as one of the most powerful and insidious branches of this conspiracy. According to Chick, the Catholic Church is the &quot;Great Whore&quot; referred to in the [[Book of Revelation]], and will bring about a Satanic [[New World Order (conspiracy)|New World Order]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0094/0094_01.asp The Last Generation]'', Jack Chick, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0030/0030_01.asp The Only Hope]'', Jack Chick, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; before it is destroyed by [[Jesus Christ]].

Drawing on the claims of Rivera and debunked authors like [[Charles Chiniquy]], Chick claims that the Catholic Church helped to mold [[Islam]] as a tool to lure people away from Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0062/0062_01.asp The Story Teller]'', Jack Chick, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; that it infiltrates and attempts to destroy or corrupt all other religions and churches,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/comics/0112/0112_allinone.asp Alberto]'' pp.17-20, Jack Chick, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; and that it uses various means including seduction, framing, and murder to silence its critics.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/comics/0112/0112_allinone.asp Alberto]'' pp.21-24, Jack Chick, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; He accuses Catholicism, specifically the [[Jesuits]], of instigating the [[American Civil War]], supporting the Confederate cause and seeking to undermine the Union. When that failed, they arranged the assassination of [[Abraham Lincoln]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/catalog/comics/0251.asp The Big Betrayal]'', Jack Chick, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; and created the [[Ku Klux Klan]], which happens to be anti-Catholic itself. According to Chick, the Catholic Church has also supported such ideologies as [[Nazism]] and [[Communism]] and used the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] to persecute opponents of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.chick.com/bc/1989/holocaustorinquisition.asp?FROM=Catholicpage Hitler's Death Camps -- Holocaust ... or Inquisition?]&quot;, ''Battle Cry'', January/February 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/books/153/153_06.asp Smokescreens]'' Chapter Six: Cover Up, Jack Chick, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that the Catholic Church keeps &quot;the name of every Protestant church member in the world&quot; in a &quot;big computer&quot; in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] for use in future persecutions.&lt;ref&gt;''Kiss the Protestants Good-bye'', Jack Chick, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''My name... in the Vatican?'' Jack Chick, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;Jesuits worked closely with Marx, Engels, Trotsky, Lenin, and Stalin&quot; to create Communism, and it was &quot;believed that soon . . . Communism would rise up as the new strong daughter of the Vatican.&quot; It was Rome that instigated the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] and the murder of the [[Nicholas II of Russia|czar]]’s family.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/comics/0114/godfathersindex.asp The Godfathers]'', Jack Chick, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; The Communist [[liberation theology]] movement also is a Vatican plot&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0053/0053_01.asp Fat Cats]'', Jack Chick, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of Papal condemnations, such as those from [[Pope John Paul II]], who, Chick claims, was in fact a good communist.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/comics/0117/theprophetindex.asp The Prophet]'', Jack Chick, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occultism ===
Chick publications present various forms of [[occult]]ism as part of a Satanic conspiracy. Most forms of [[fantasy]] and depictions of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], including [[Harry Potter]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/5012/5012_01.asp The Nervous Witch]'', Jack Chick, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0046/0046_01.asp Dark Dungeons]'', Jack Chick, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Halloween]] celebrations&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0011/0011_01.asp The Trick]'', Jack Chick, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; are portrayed as an attempt to draw children into [[witchcraft]].

For example, the tract ''Boo!''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0058/0058_01.asp Boo!]'', Jack Chick, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; is set on Halloween, Satan's supposed birthday. Satan kills people while dressed as a [[chainsaw]]-wielding maniac, clad in black and wearing a [[Jack-o'-lantern]] on his head. In the tract, Chick states that the [[Druids]] of the British Isles would take victims for their [[human sacrifice]]s by force on October 31 and leave a Jack-o'-lantern in exchange. In reality, [[Squash (plant)|squash]]es or [[pumpkins]] would not have been accessible to the Druids, since squashes came from the Americas and were not brought to the British Isles until nearly a thousand years after the time of the Druids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aces.uiuc.edu/news/stories/news3326.html Univ of Ill. Extension] retrieved April 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the Druids in this instance are seen holding an [[ankh]], which is actually an Ancient Egyptian symbol.

Many of the tracts also mention that [[Holy Communion]] is an Egyptian tradition, and portray the Egyptian people as worshiping wafers of unleavened bread as the god [[Osiris]], who is described as the sun.  In reality, Osiris was never a solar deity, but rather associated with fertility, agriculture, and death.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Criticism==
{{Original research|date=June 2009}}
Chick's critics (such as talkorigins.org, Hindu American Foundation, Catholic Answers, etc.) accuse him of misrepresentation &amp;mdash; for instance, the online version of Chick's tract ''Big Daddy'' mainly uses Kent Hovind as a reference &lt;ref name=&quot;big-daddy&quot; /&gt; despite the fact that Kent Hovind has no degrees from an accredited institution in the relevant fields, the thesis referred to is of very poor quality, and his claims are at odds with the published statements of experts in the field &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Catholic Answers web published a response to the claims of Chick Publications against Roman Catholics and a criticism of Chick Tracts in general called  The Nightmare World of Jack T. Chick&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.com/library/sr_chick_tracts.asp The Nightmare World of Jack T. Chick]&lt;/ref&gt; detailing the inaccuracies, factual errors, and the &quot;typical tactic in Chick tracts is to portray Catholics as being unpleasant or revolting in various ways&quot;.

The [[Hindu American Foundation]] put out electronic PDF paper called Hyperlink to Hinduphobia: Online Hatred, Extremism and Bigotry Against Hindus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduamericanfoundation.org/pdf/hate_report_2007.pdf Hyperlink to Hinduphobia: Online Hatred, Extremism and Bigotry Against Hindus]&lt;/ref&gt; which contains a section on Chick's site that ends with the statement &quot;Chick Publications promotes hatred not just against Hindus, but also towards Muslims, Catholics, and others as is evidenced by the following titles of their tracts: “Last Rites – When this Catholic dies, he learns that his church couldn't save him”; “The Little Bride – Protect children against being recruited as Muslims. Li'l Susy explains that only Jesus can save them”; and “Allah Had No Son – The Allah of Islam is not the God of creation”&quot;

Another common criticism is that Chick portrays a world full of paranoia and conspiracy where nothing is what it seems and nearly everything is a Satanic plot&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

He has also changed the content of other tracts such as ''The Last Generation'' and his book ''The Next Step'' to reflect his increasingly anti-Catholic beliefs{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}, and the content of ''That Crazy Guy!'' was changed after the rise of the [[AIDS]] crisis (the tract was originally about [[herpes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

One claim that used to pop up frequently in Chick's publications was that the Soviet Union would invade [[Israel]] under orders of the Pope, with [[East Germany]] aiding it. Tracts that used to contain this claim (like &quot;Escape&quot;) had it removed in later revisions. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} It can still be seen on Page 33 of &quot;The Godfathers.&quot;

Some of the criticism of Chick tracts has taken the form of parody tracts pointing out all the errors (logical and factual) in the originals. ''Big Daddy'' was satirized by ''Who's Your Daddy?'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facts4u.com/OffSite_Stored_Pages/wyd_files/wyd.htm ''Who's Your Daddy?'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''Somebody Loves You'' was satirized by ''Somebody Loves You?'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luciferianliberationfront.org/sly.html ''Somebody Loves You?'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Gun Slinger'' was satirized by  ''The Good, The Bad, and the Fundy''.&lt;ref&gt;The Jack T. Chick Parody Archive (defunct as of March 27 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  At least one satire website has claimed improper copyright claims by Chick Publications&lt;ref&gt;The Jack T. Chick Parody Archive (defunct as of March 27 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; to remove parody tracts despite the fact parodies and satires are exempt from copyright law per ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'', ''[[Leibovitz v. Paramount Pictures Corp.]]'', and ''[[Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin]]''.

==Defense==
Many [[fundamentalist]] Protestants, both past and present, agree with at least some of Chick Publications' more controversial claims.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Some reject Chick's Roman Catholic conspiracy theories but accept other claims promoted in his tracts (such as his view that a person must be saved so as to avoid [[eternal damnation]] in Hell), and so offer qualified agreement with Chick's beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Some anti-[[cult]] organizations view Chick's website and publications as a valuable source of material on groups they see as cults.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.missionresources.com/cult.html Information on Cults Resource Directory]&quot;, World Christian Resource Directory.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Chick claims that [[cartoon]]s are a more effective medium for witnessing than conventional text based tracts. Some of the characteristics often seen as failings of his tracts - for instance, their simplistic messages - can also be viewed as strengths, making them more appealing to readers who are unsympathetic to more conventional forms of evangelism. Some tracts go further, and use only words aimed at children, or tell their stories without words. Recently people in cartoons have been colored in to appeal more to black people.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.chick.com/newseries.asp?wpc=newseries.asp&amp;wpp=a New Series from Chick Publications]&quot;, Chick Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chick's more controversial claims are usually accompanied by supporting references to the [[Bible]] (always quoting the King James Version), other books (often also published by Chick), and historical facts; debate commonly focuses on the reliability of these sources and of Chick's representation of them.

== Cultural influence ==
Jack T. Chick's tracts have had an unintentional influence on pop culture. The Chick Tract Club was established for collectors of Chick's works. A website for parodies of his works (The Jack T. Chick Parody Archive) was on line. Kurt Kuersteiner, the author of ''The Unofficial Guide to the Art of Jack T. Chick'', has produced a [[Documentary film|documentary]] on Jack Chick and his works entitled ''God's Cartoonist: The Comic Crusade of Jack Chick''. Comedian [[David Cross]] (a self-professed [[atheist]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = David_Cross
  | publisher = celebrity atheist list
  | url =http://www.celebatheists.com/index.php?title=David_Cross
  | accessdate = June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) released a DVD of his comedy works entitled ''[[Let America Laugh]]'' with the chapters titled after Chick tracts (''This Was Your Life'', ''Who Cares?'', ''Is There Another Christ?'', ''Gomez Is Coming'', etc.).

'''Carme''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|ɑr|m|iː}} {{respell|KAR|mee}}; {{lang-el|Κάρμη}}) is a [[retrograde motion|retrograde]] [[irregular satellite|irregular]] [[natural satellite|satellite]] of [[Jupiter]]. It was discovered by [[Seth Barnes Nicholson]] at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] in  [[California]] in July 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson 1938&quot;/&gt; It is named after the mythological [[Carme (mythology)|Carme]], mother by [[Zeus]] of [[Britomartis]], a [[Crete|Cretan]] goddess.

Carme did not receive its present name until 1975;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/02800/02846.html IAUC 2846: ''Satellites of Jupiter''] 1974 October 7 (naming the moon)&lt;/ref&gt; before then, it was simply known as '''{{nowrap|Jupiter XI}}'''.

It gives its name to the [[Carme group]], made up of irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23 and 24 Gm and at an inclination of about 165°. Its orbital elements are as of January 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobson 2000&quot;/&gt; They are continuously changing due to [[Sun|solar]] and planetary perturbations.

In [[mathematics]], the '''commutator''' gives an indication of the extent to which a certain [[binary operation]] fails to be [[commutative]]. There are different definitions used in [[group theory]] and [[ring theory]].

==Group theory==
The '''commutator''' of two elements, ''g'' and ''h'', of a [[group (mathematics)|group]], ''G'', is the element
:[''g'', ''h''] = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''h''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''gh''.
It is equal to the group's identity if and only if ''g'' and ''h'' commute (i.e., if and only if ''gh'' = ''hg''). The [[subgroup]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; [[Generating set of a group|generated]] by all commutators is called the ''derived group'' or the ''[[commutator subgroup]]'' of ''G''. Note that one must consider the subgroup generated by the set of commutators because in general the set of commutators is not closed under the group operation. Commutators are used to define [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] and [[solvable group|solvable]] groups.

N.B. The above definition of the commutator is used by group theorists.  Many other mathematicians define the commutator as
:[''g'', ''h''] = ''ghg''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''h''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Identities===
Commutator identities are an important tool in [[group theory]], {{harv|McKay|2000|p=4}}. The expression ''a&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;'' denotes  ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''a x''.

# &lt;math&gt;x^y = x[x,y].\,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;[y,x] = [x,y]^{-1}.\,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;[x, z y] = [x, y]\cdot [x, z]^y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[x z, y] = [x, y]^z\cdot [z, y].&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;[x, y^{-1}] = [y, x]^{y^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[x^{-1}, y] = [y, x]^{x^{-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;[[x, y^{-1}], z]^y\cdot[[y, z^{-1}], x]^z\cdot[[z, x^{-1}], y]^x = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[[x,y],z^x]\cdot [[z,x],y^z]\cdot [[y,z],x^y]=1.&lt;/math&gt;

Identity 5 is also known as the ''Hall-Witt identity''. It is a group-theoretic analogue of the [[Jacobi identity]] for the ring-theoretic commutator (see next section).

N.B. The above definition of the conjugate of ''a'' by ''x'' is used by group theorists.  Many other mathematicians define the conjugate of ''a'' by ''x'' as ''xax&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''.  This is often written &lt;math&gt;{}^x a&lt;/math&gt;.  Similar identities hold for these conventions.

A wide range of identities are used that are true modulo certain subgroups.  These can be particularly useful in the study of [[solvable group]]s and [[nilpotent group]]s.  For instance, in any group second powers behave well

:&lt;math&gt; (xy)^2 = x^2y^2[y,x][[y,x],y].\,&lt;/math&gt;

If the [[derived subgroup]] is central, then

:&lt;math&gt;(xy)^n = x^n y^n [y,x]^{\binom{n}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Ring theory==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Lie algebra]] --&gt;
The '''commutator''' of two elements ''a'' and ''b'' of a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] or an [[associative algebra]] is defined by
:[''a'', ''b''] = ''ab'' &amp;minus; ''ba''.
It is zero if and only if ''a'' and ''b'' commute. In [[linear algebra]], if two endomorphisms of a space are represented by commuting matrices with respect to one basis, then they are so represented with respect to every basis.
By using the commutator as a [[Lie bracket]], every associative algebra can be turned into a [[Lie algebra]]. The commutator of two operators defined on a [[Hilbert space]] is an important concept in [[quantum mechanics]] since it measures how well the two [[observable]]s described by the operators can be measured simultaneously. The [[uncertainty principle]] is ultimately a [[theorem]] about these commutators via the [[Uncertainty relation|Robertson-Schrödinger relation]].

=== Identities ===
The commutator has the following properties:

''Lie-algebra relations:''
* &lt;math&gt;[A,A] = 0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;[A,B] = -[B,A]&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;[A,[B,C]] + [B,[C,A]] + [C,[A,B]] = 0&lt;/math&gt;
The second relation is called [[anticommutativity]], while the third is the [[Jacobi identity]].

''Additional relations:''
* &lt;math&gt; [A,BC] = [A,B]C + B[A,C]&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; [AB,C] = A[B,C] + [A,C]B&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; [ABC,D] = AB[C,D] + A[B,D]C + [A,D]BC&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; [AB,CD] = A[B,CD] +[A,CD]B = A[B,C]D + AC[B,D] +[A,C]DB + C[A,D]B&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; [[[A,B], C], D] + [[[B,C], D], A] + [[[C, D], A], B] + [[[D, A], B], C] = [[A, C], [B, D]]&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; [AB,C]=A\{B,C\}-\{A,C\}B&lt;/math&gt;, where {A,B}=AB+BA is the anticommutator defined below

If ''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'' is a fixed element of a ring &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle\mathfrak{R} &lt;/math&gt;, the first additional relation can also be interpreted as a [[Leibniz rule]] for the map  &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle D_A: R \rightarrow R &lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle B \mapsto  [A,B]&lt;/math&gt;. In other words: the map ''&lt;math&gt;D_A&lt;/math&gt;'' defines a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]] on the ring &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle\mathfrak{R} &lt;/math&gt;.

The following identity involving commutators, a special case of the [[Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula]], is also useful:

*&lt;math&gt; e^{A}Be^{-A}=B+[A,B]+\frac{1}{2!}[A,[A,B]]+\frac{1}{3!}[A,[A,[A,B]]]+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

==Graded rings and algebras==
When dealing with [[graded algebra]]s, the commutator is usually replaced by the '''graded commutator''', defined in homogeneous components as &lt;math&gt;\ [\omega,\eta]_{gr} := \omega\eta - (-1)^{\deg \omega \deg \eta} \eta\omega.&lt;/math&gt;

== Derivations ==
Especially if one deals with multiple commutators, another notation turns out to be useful involving the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad} (x)(y) = [x, y] . &lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt; {\rm ad} (x) &lt;/math&gt; is a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]] and &lt;math&gt; {\rm ad} &lt;/math&gt; is linear, ''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;{\rm ad} (x+y)={\rm ad} (x)+{\rm ad} (y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\rm ad} (\lambda x)=\lambda\,\operatorname{ad} (x)&lt;/math&gt;, and a [[Lie algebra]] homomorphism, ''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;{\rm ad} ([x, y])=[{\rm ad} (x), {\rm ad}(y)]&lt;/math&gt;, but it is '''not''' always an algebra homomorphism, ''i.e.'' the identity &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}(xy) = \operatorname{ad}(x)\operatorname{ad}(y) &lt;/math&gt; '''does not hold in general'''.

Examples:
* &lt;math&gt;{\rm ad} (x){\rm ad} (x)(y) = [x,[x,y]\,]&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;{\rm ad} (x){\rm ad} (a+b)(y) = [x,[a+b,y]\,].&lt;/math&gt;

==Anticommutator==
The '''anticommutator''' of two elements ''a'' and ''b'' of a ring or an associative algebra is defined by
:{''a'', ''b''} = ''ab'' + ''ba''.
The anticommutator is used less often than the commutator, but can be used for example to define [[Clifford algebra]]s and [[Jordan algebra]]s.

[[File:Cairn.JPG|right|thumb|200px|A cairn to mark the summit of a [[mountain]].]]
A '''cairn''' (from ''càrn'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]], ''carnedd'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], ''karn'' or ''carn'' in [[Cornish language|Cornish]], ''carn'' in [[Irish language|Irish]]) is a man-made pile of stones.  Cairns are found all over the world in [[Upland and lowland (freshwater ecology)|uplands]], on [[moorland]], on [[Summit (topography)|mountaintops]], near [[waterway]]s and on sea cliffs, and also in barren [[desert]] and [[tundra]] areas. They vary in size from small stone markers to entire artificial hills, and in complexity from loose, conical rock piles to delicately balanced sculptures and elaborate feats of [[megalith]]ic engineering. Cairns may be painted or otherwise decorated, e.g. for increased visibility or for religious reasons.

In modern times, cairns are often erected as landmarks, a use they have had since ancient times. Since [[prehistory]], they have also been built as [[Sepulchre|sepulchral]] monuments, or used for defensive, hunting, ceremonial, astronomical and other purposes.

==Modern cairns==
[[File:Lion's Head snow.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Line of cairns used to mark the way above the treeline on [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington, New Hampshire]]]]
Today, cairns are built for many purposes.  The most common use in [[North America]] and [[Northern Europe]] is to mark [[mountain bike]] and [[hiking trail]]s and other cross-country [[trail blazing]], especially in mountain regions at or above the [[tree line]]. For example, the extensive trail network maintained by the DNT, the Norwegian Trekking Association, extensively uses cairns in conjunction with T-painted rock faces to mark trails.  Other examples of these can be seen in the lava fields of [[Volcanoes National Park]] in [[Hawaii]] to mark several hikes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/hike_bc.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Placed at regular intervals, a series of cairns can be used to indicate a path across stony or barren terrain, even across [[glacier]]s. Such cairns are often placed at junctions or in places where the trail direction is not obvious, and may also be used to indicate an obscured danger, such as a sudden drop, or a noteworthy point such as the summit of a mountain.  Most trail cairns are small, a foot or less in height, but may be built taller so as to protrude through a layer of snow. Hikers passing by often add a stone, as a small bit of maintenance to counteract the erosive effects of severe weather. North American trail marks are sometimes called &quot;ducks&quot; or &quot;duckies&quot;, because they sometimes have a &quot;beak&quot; pointing in the direction of the route. The expression &quot;two rocks do not make a duck&quot; reminds hikers that just one rock resting upon another could be the result of accident or nature rather than intentional trail marking.

Coastal cairns, or &quot;sea marks&quot;, are also common in the northern latitudes, especially in the island-strewn waters of [[Scandinavia]] and eastern [[Canada]]. Often indicated on navigation charts, they may be painted white or lit as beacons for greater visibility offshore.

[[File:Isandlwanamassgrave.JPG|left|thumb|200px|One of many cairns marking British mass graves at the site of the [[Battle of Isandlwana]], [[South Africa]].]]Modern cairns may also be erected for historical or memorial commemoration or simply for decorative or artistic reasons.  One example is a series of many cairns marking [[United Kingdom|British]] soldiers' [[mass graves]] at the site of the [[Battle of Isandlwana]], [[South Africa]]. Another is the [[Matthew Flinders]] Cairn on the side of [[Arthur's Seat, Victoria|Arthur's Seat]], a small mountain on the shores of [[Port Phillip Bay]], [[Australia]]. A large cairn was built atop a hill next to the [[I-476]] highway in [[Radnor, Pennsylvania]], part of a series of large rock sculptures initiated in 1988 to symbolize the township's [[Wales|Welsh]] heritage and to beautify the visual imagery along the highway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radnor.com/department/division.asp?fDD=9-108 Radnor Township website], Gateway Enhancement Strategy.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are merely places where farmers have collected stones removed from a field. These can be seen in the [[Catskill Mountains]], [[North America]] where there is a strong Scottish heritage, and may also represent places where livestock were lost. In locales exhibiting fantastic rock formations, such as the [[Grand Canyon]], tourists often construct simple cairns in reverence of the larger counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. By contrast, cairns may have a strong aesthetic purpose, for example in the art of [[Andy Goldsworthy]].

===Europe and the Middle East===
[[File:Cairn Gavrinis exterieur.jpg|thumb|Cairn of the [[Neolithic]]-era [[passage grave]] on [[Gavrinis]] island, [[Brittany]].]]
The building of cairns for various purposes goes back into [[prehistory]] in Eurasia, ranging in size from small rock sculptures to substantial man-made hills of stone (some built on top of larger, natural hills). The latter are often relatively massive [[Bronze Age]] or earlier structures which, like [[kistvaens]] and [[dolmens]], frequently contain burials; they are comparable to [[Tumulus|tumuli]] ([[kurgan]]s), but of stone construction instead of [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]. ''Cairn'' originally could more broadly refer to various types of hills and natural stone piles, but today is used exclusively of artificial ones.

The word ''cairn'' derives from [[Scots language|Scots]] ''cairn'' (with the same meaning), in turn from [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''càrn'', which is essentially the same as the corresponding words in other native [[Celtic language]]s of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]], including [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''carn'' (modern ''carnedd''), [[Irish language|Irish]] ''carn'', and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''karn'' or ''carn''.  Cornwall (''Kernow'') itself may actually be named after the cairns that dot its landscape, such as Cornwall's highest point, [[Brown Willy Cairns|Brown Willy Summit Cairn]], a 5&amp;nbsp;m (16&amp;nbsp;ft) high and 24&amp;nbsp;m (79&amp;nbsp;ft) diameter mound atop [[Brown Willy]] hill in [[Bodmin Moor]], an area with many ancient cairns.  Burial cairns and other [[megaliths]] are the subject of a variety of legends and folklore throughout Britain and Ireland. In [[Scotland]], it is traditional to carry a stone up from the bottom of a hill to place on a cairn at its top. In such a fashion, cairns would grow ever larger. An old Scottish Gaelic blessing is ''Cuiridh mi clach air do chàrn'', &quot;I'll put a stone on your cairn&quot;.  Cairns in the region were also put to vital practical use. For example, [[Dún Aonghasa]], an all-stone [[Iron Age]] Irish [[hill fort]] on [[Inishmore]] in the [[Aran Islands]], is still surrounded by small cairns and strategically placed jutting rocks, used collectively as an alternative to [[Defensive wall|defensive earthworks]] because of the [[karst]] landscape's lack of soil.

In [[Scandinavia]], cairns have been used for centuries as trail and sea marks, among other purposes. In [[Iceland]], cairns were often used as markers along the numerous single-file roads or paths that crisscrossed the island; many of these ancient cairns are still standing, although the paths have disappeared. In [[Norse Greenland]], cairns were used as a hunting implement, a game-driving &quot;lane&quot;, used to direct reindeer towards a [[game jump]].&lt;ref&gt;Arneborg 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mythology of ancient Greece, cairns were associated with [[Hermes]], the god of overland travel. According to one legend, Hermes was put on trial by [[Hera]] for slaying her favorite servant, the monster [[Argus Panoptes|Argus]]. All of the other gods acted as a jury, and as a way of declaring their verdict they were given pebbles, and told to throw them at whichever person they deemed to be in the right, Hermes or Hera. Hermes argued so skillfully that he ended up buried under a heap of pebbles, and this was the first cairn.
In [[Croatia]], in areas of ancient [[Dalmatia]], such as [[Herzegovina]] and the [[Krajina]], they are known as ''gromila''.

In a legend of [[Portugal]], a cairn is called a ''moledro'', the stones of which are enchanted soldiers, and if one stone is taken from the pile and put under a pillow, in the morning a soldier will appear for a brief moment, then will change back to a stone and magically return to the pile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.continuitas.org/texts/morais_genetica.pdf A Genética e a Teoria da Continuidade Paleolítica aplicada à Lenda da Fundação de Portugal e Escócia Apenas Livros 2008 ISBN|978-989-618-180-2].&lt;/ref&gt;

Cairns are also common on the [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Corsica]]. 

===Africa===
[[File:Qableh3.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Cairn possibly marking a grave in the [[Qa’ableh, Somalia]] ruins.]]
Cairns, possibly indicating burials, are a common feature at [[Qa’ableh]], the site of ancient ruins not yet fully explored by [[Archaeology|archaeologists]], in the [[Sanaag]] region of northern [[Somalia]]. The area is believed to harbor the tombs of former kings from early periods of [[Somali people|Somali]] history, as evidenced by the many strange-looking burial structures and cairns that are found here.

In North Africa, Cairns are sometimes called ''kerkour''.

===Asia and the Pacific===
[[File:Cairns on Chandrashila Peak, Tungnath, Uttarakhand.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Cairn on ''[[Chandrashila]] Peak'', above [[Tungnath]], [[India]].{{clarify|date=March 2011|reason=Nothing about this appears in the text. Are these modern trail cairns or something else? If the former, we don't need three pics of the same kind of cairn in this article.}}]]
Starting in the [[Bronze Age]],{{clarify|date=March 2011|reason=WHERE?!? &quot;Asia&quot; is huge.}} burial [[cist]]s were sometimes interred into cairns, which would be situated in conspicuous positions, often on the skyline above the village of the deceased. The stones may have been thought to deter grave robbers and scavengers. A more sinister explanation is that they were to [[Revenant|stop the dead from rising]]. There remains is a [[Judaism|Jewish]] tradition of placing small stones on a person's grave, as a token of respect. [[Stupa]]s in India and [[Tibet]] probably started out in a similar fashion, although they now generally contain the ashes of a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] saint or [[lama]].

[[File:TallOvoo.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Mongolian ceremonial cairn (''[[ovoo]]'')]]A traditional and often decorated, heap-formed cairn called an ''[[ovoo]]'' is made in [[Mongolia]]. It primarily serves religious purposes, and finds use in both [[Tengriism|Tengriist]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ceremonies.

In [[Hawaii]], cairns are called by the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word ''ahu''.{{clarify|date=March 2011|reason=So what? Is this an ancient thing? If so, tell us about it and cite sources. If it's just the word for modern trail cairns on the volcanoes, then remove this entire paragraph since this isn't Wiktionary, and WP isn't here to provide translation services.}}

===The Americas===
[[File:Cairn5.JPG|thumb|left|300px|A cairn marking the peak of Bald Mountain, [[Adirondacks]].]]
Throughout what today are the [[continental United States]] and [[Canada]], cairns still mark [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]]' game-driving &quot;lanes&quot; leading to [[buffalo jump]]s, some of which may date to 12,000 years ago.

Natives of arctic North America (i.e. northern Canada, [[Alaska]] and indigenous [[Greenland]]) have built carefully constructed cairns and stone sculptures, called by names such as [[Inuksuk|''inuksuit'' and ''inunnguat'']], as landmarks and directional markers since [[European colonization of the Americas|before contact with Europeans]].  They are iconic of the region (an ''inuksuk'' even features on the flag of the Canadian far-northeastern territory, [[Nunavut]]), and are increasingly used as a symbol of Canadian national identity.

In North America, cairns are often [[petroforms]] in the shapes of turtles or other animals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Cairns have been used since [[pre-Columbian]] times throughout [[Latin America]] to mark trails. Even today in the [[Andes]] of [[South America]], the [[Quechuan]] peoples use cairns as religious shrines to the indigenous [[Inca]] goddess [[Pachamama]], often as part of a [[Synchretism|synchretic]] form of [[Roman Catholicism]].

==Cairns and anthropomorphism==
[[File:Inuksugalait Foxe-PI 2002-07-26.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''[[Inuksuit]]'' at the [[Inuksuk Point]] ([[Baffin Island]]), Canada]] 
Although the practice is not common in [[Modern English language|English]], cairns are sometimes referred to by their [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] qualities. In [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], a cairn is known as ''Steinmann'' and ''Steenman'' respectively, meaning literally &quot;stone man&quot;.  A form of the [[Inuit]] ''[[inuksuk]]'' is also meant to represent a human figure, and is called an ''inunguak'' (&quot;imitation of a person&quot;). In Italy, especially the [[Italian Alps]], a cairn is an ''ometto'', or a &quot;small man&quot;.

==Sea cairns==
[[File:Kummel Korpo 2009.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Sea mark]] in [[Finland|Finnish]] coastal waters.]]
Coastal cairns called [[sea mark]]s are also common in the northern latitudes, and are placed along shores and on islands and islets. Usually painted white for improved offshore visibility, they serve as navigation aids. In [[Scandinavia]] they are called ''kummel'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and ''kummeli'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and are indicated in navigation charts and maintained as part of the nautical marking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url= http://portal.fma.fi/portal/page/portal/589032C37AAC7314E040B40A0A016368 |title=Legend (INT Symbology) |format=PDF |location=[[Helsinki, Finland]] |publisher=Finnish Transport Agency and Finnish Transport Safety Agency (TraFi) |work=Merenkulku.fi}} Three-language key to reading Finnish navigation charts.&lt;/ref&gt; To increase visibility they are usually painted white.  Inversely, they are used on land as sea cliff warnings in rugged and hilly terrain in the foggy [[Faroe Islands]]. In the [[Maritimes|Canadian Maritimes]], cairns have been used as beacons like small [[lighthouse]]s to guide boats, as depicted in the novel ''[[The Shipping News]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], particularly in the area of [[abstract algebra]] known as [[group theory]], a '''characteristic subgroup''' is a [[subgroup]] that is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under all [[automorphism]]s of the parent [[group (mathematics)|group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Dummit | first1=David S. | last2=Foote | first2=Richard M. | title=Abstract Algebra | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | year=2004 | edition=3rd | isbn=0-471-43334-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lang | first=Serge | authorlink=Serge Lang | title=Algebra | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] | year=2002 | isbn=0-387-95385-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] is an automorphism, every characteristic subgroup is [[normal subgroup|normal]], though not every normal subgroup is characteristic.  Examples of characteristic subgroups include the [[commutator subgroup]] and the [[center of a group]].

== Definitions ==
A '''characteristic subgroup''' of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' is a [[subgroup]] ''H'' that is invariant under each [[automorphism]] of ''G''. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(H) = H&lt;/math&gt;
for every automorphism ''&amp;phi;'' of ''G'' (where ''&amp;phi;''(''H'') denotes the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of ''H'' under ''&amp;phi;'').

The statement &amp;ldquo;''H'' is a characteristic subgroup of ''G''&amp;rdquo; is written
:&lt;math&gt;H\;\mathrm{char}\;G.&lt;/math&gt;

== Characteristic vs. normal ==
If ''G'' is a group, and ''g'' is a fixed element of ''G'', then the conjugation map
:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto g x g^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
is an automorphism of ''G'' (known as an [[inner automorphism]]).  A subgroup of ''G'' that is invariant under all inner automorphisms is called [[normal subgroup|normal]].  Since a characteristic subgroup is invariant under all automorphisms, every characteristic subgroup is normal.

Not every normal subgroup is characteristic.  Here are several examples:
* Let ''H'' be a group, and let ''G'' be the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] ''H''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''H''.  Then the subgroups {1}&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''H'' and ''H''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;{1} are both normal, but neither is characteristic.  In particular, neither of these subgroups is invariant under the automorphism (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;(''y'',&amp;nbsp;''x'') that switches the two factors.
* For a concrete example of this, let ''V'' be the [[Klein four-group]] (which is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the direct product [[cyclic group|'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;[[cyclic group|'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]).  Since this group is [[abelian group|abelian]], every subgroup is normal; but every permutation of the three non-identity elements is an automorphism of ''V'', so the three subgroups of order 2 are not characteristic.Here &lt;math&gt; V=\left\{e,a,b,ab\right\}&lt;/math&gt; Consider H={e,a} and consider the automorphism &lt;math&gt; T(e)=e, T(a)=b, T(b)=a, T(ab)=ab &lt;/math&gt;.Then ''T(H)'' is not contained in ''H''.
* In the [[quaternion group]] of order 8, each of the cyclic subgroups of order 4 is normal, but none of these are characteristic.  However, the subgroup {1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1} is characteristic, since it is the only subgroup of order 2.
Note: If ''H'' is the unique subgroup of a group ''G'', then ''H'' is characteristic in ''G''.
* If ''n'' is even, the [[dihedral group]] of order 2''n'' has three subgroups of [[index of a subgroup|index]] two, all of which are normal.  One of these is the cyclic subgroup, which is characteristic.  The other two subgroups are dihedral; these are permuted by an [[outer automorphism group|outer automorphism]] of the parent group, and are therefore not characteristic.
* &quot;Normality&quot; is not transitive but Characteristic is transitive. If ''H'' Char ''K'' and ''K'' normal in ''G'' then ''H'' normal in ''G''.

== Comparison to other subgroup properties ==
=== Distinguished subgroups ===
A related concept is that of a '''distinguished subgroup'''. In this case the subgroup ''H'' is invariant under the applications of [[surjective]] [[endomorphism]]s. For a [[finite group]] this is the same, because surjectivity implies injectivity, but not for an infinite group: a surjective endomorphism is not necessarily an automorphism.

=== Fully invariant subgroups ===
For an even stronger constraint, a [[fully characteristic subgroup]] (also called a '''fully invariant subgroup''') ''H'' of a group ''G'' is a group remaining invariant under every endomorphism of ''G''; in other words, if ''f'' : ''G'' → ''G'' is any homomorphism, then ''f''(''H'') is a subgroup of ''H''.

=== Verbal subgroups ===
An even stronger constraint is [[verbal subgroup]], which is the image of a fully invariant subgroup of a [[free group]] under a [[homomorphism]].

=== Containments ===
Every subgroup that is fully characteristic is certainly distinguished and therefore characteristic; but a characteristic or even distinguished subgroup need not be fully characteristic.

The [[center of a group]] is easily seen to always be a distinguished subgroup, but it is not always fully characteristic.  The finite group of order 12, Sym(3) × '''Z'''/2'''Z''' has a homomorphism taking (''π'', ''y'') to ( (1,2)&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''0'') which takes the center 1 × '''Z'''/2'''Z''' into a subgroup of Sym(3) × 1, which meets the center only in the identity.

The relationship amongst these subgroup properties can be expressed as:

:[[subgroup]] ⇐ [[normal subgroup]] ⇐ '''characteristic subgroup''' ⇐ distinguished subgroup ⇐ [[fully characteristic subgroup]] ⇐ [[verbal subgroup]]

==Examples==
=== Finite example ===
Consider the group ''G'' = S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; × Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the group of order 12 which is the direct product of the [[symmetric group]] of order 6 and a [[cyclic group]] of order 2). The center of ''G'' is its second factor Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Note that the first factor S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; contains subgroups isomorphic to Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for instance {identity,(12)}; let ''f'': Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; be the morphism mapping Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto the indicated subgroup. Then the composition of the projection of ''G'' onto its second factor Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, followed by ''f'', followed by the inclusion of S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into ''G'' as its first factor, provides an endomorphism of ''G'' under which the image of the center Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not contained in the center, so here the center is not a fully characteristic subgroup of ''G''.

=== Cyclic groups ===
Every subgroup of a cyclic group is characteristic.

=== Subgroup functors ===
The [[derived subgroup]] (or commutator subgroup) of a group is a verbal subgroup.  The [[torsion subgroup]] of an [[abelian group]] is a fully invariant subgroup.

== Transitivity ==
The property of being characteristic or fully characteristic is [[transitivity (mathematics)|transitive]]; if ''H'' is a (fully) characteristic subgroup of ''K'', and ''K'' is a (fully) characteristic subgroup of ''G'', then ''H'' is a (fully) characteristic subgroup of ''G''.

Moreover, while it is not true that every normal subgroup of a normal subgroup is normal, it is true that every characteristic subgroup of a normal subgroup is normal. Similarly, while it is not true that every distinguished subgroup of a distinguished subgroup is distinguished, it is true that every fully characteristic subgroup of a distinguished subgroup is distinguished.

==Map on Aut and End==
If &lt;math&gt;H\,\mathrm{char}\,G.&lt;/math&gt;, then every automorphism of ''G'' induces an automorphism of the quotient group ''G/H'', which yields a map &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Aut}\,G \to \mbox{Aut}\, G/H&lt;/math&gt;.

If ''H'' is fully characteristic in ''G'', then analogously, every endomorphism of ''G'' induces an endomorphism of ''G/H'', which yields a map
&lt;math&gt;\mbox{End}\,G \to \mbox{End}\, G/H&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following '''list of cat breeds''' includes domestic [[cat breed]]s and [[Felid_hybrid#Domestic_Cat_.26_hybridization|domestic/wild hybrids]]. The list includes established breeds recognized by various [[cat registry| cat registries]], new and experimental breeds, distinct domestic population not being actively developed and lapsed breeds. 

Inconsistency in breed classification among registries means that an individual animal may be considered different breeds by different registries. For example, [[The International Cat Association]]'s Himalayan is considered a colorpoint version of the Persian by the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] while the CFA's Javanese is considered a color variation of the Balinese by TICA.

The [[Domestic shorthaired cat|domestic shorthair]] and [[Domestic longhaired cat|domestic longhair]] are not breeds but terms used in [[cat fancy]] to describe cats that do not belong to a particular breed.

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}

In [[law]], a '''class action''' or a '''representative action''' is a form of [[lawsuit]] in which a large group of people collectively bring a claim to court and/or in which a class of defendants is being sued. This form of collective lawsuit originated in the United States and is still predominantly a U.S. phenomenon, at least the U.S. variant of it. However, in several European countries with [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] different from the English [[common law]] principle (which is used by U.S. courts), changes have been made in recent years that allow consumer organizations to bring claims on behalf of large groups of consumers.

== U.S. federal class actions ==
In the United States federal courts, class actions are governed by [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] [http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule23.htm Rule 23] and 28 U.S.C.A. § 1332 (d).

Class action lawsuits may be brought in [[United States district court|federal court]] if the claim arises under federal law, or if the claim falls under 28 USCA § 1332 (d). Under § 1332 (d) (2) the federal district courts have original jurisdiction over any civil action where the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000 and either 
1. any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a State different from any defendant; 
2. any member of a class of plaintiffs is a foreign state or a citizen or subject of a foreign state and any defendant is a citizen of a State; or 
3. any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a State and any defendant is a foreign state or a citizen or subject of a foreign state.&lt;ref&gt;28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2)&lt;/ref&gt; Nationwide plaintiff classes are possible, but such suits must have a commonality of issues across state lines.  This may be difficult if the [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] in the various states lack significant commonalities. Large class actions brought in federal court frequently are consolidated for pre-trial purposes through the device of [[multidistrict litigation]] (MDL).{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} It is also possible to bring class action lawsuits under state law, and in some cases the court may extend its jurisdiction to all the members of the class, including out of state (or even internationally) as the key element is the jurisdiction that the court has over the defendant.

Typically, federal courts are thought to be more favorable for defendants, and state courts more favorable for plaintiffs. Many class action cases are filed initially in state court. The defendant will frequently try to [[removal jurisdiction|remove]] the case to federal court. The [[Class Action Fairness Act of 2005]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ002.109 Class Action Fairness Act Public Law 109-2, 119 Stat. 4]&lt;/ref&gt; increases defendants' ability to remove state cases to federal court by giving federal courts original jurisdiction for all class actions with damages exceeding $5,000,000, exclusive of interest and costs.&lt;ref&gt;28 U.S.C.A. § 1332(d)&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, however, that the Class Action Fairness Act contains carve-outs for, 'inter alia', shareholder class action lawsuits covered by the [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]] of 1995 and those concerning internal corporate governance issues (the latter typically being brought as shareholder derivative actions in the state courts of Delaware, the state of incorporation of most large corporations).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classactionprofessor.com/cafa-analysis.pdf William B. Rubenstein, &quot;Understanding the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005&quot; (briefing paper)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure for filing a class action is to file suit with one or several named plaintiffs on behalf of a proposed class. The proposed class must consist of a group of individuals or business entities that have suffered a common injury or injuries. Typically these cases result from an action on the part of a business or a particular product defect or policy that applied to all proposed class members in a typical manner. After the complaint is filed, the plaintiff must file a motion to have the class certified. In some cases class certification may require [[discovery (law)|discovery]] in order to determine its size and if the proposed class meets the standard for class certification.

Upon the motion to certify the class, the defendants may object to whether the issues are appropriately handled as a class action, to whether the named plaintiffs are sufficiently representative of the class, and to their relationship with the law firm or firms handling the case. The court will also examine the ability of the firm to prosecute the claim for the plaintiffs, and their resources for dealing with class actions.

[[Due process]] requires in most cases that notice describing the class action be sent, published, or broadcast to class members. As part of this notice procedure, there may have to be several notices, first a notice giving class members the opportunity to opt out of the class, i.e. if individuals wish to proceed with their own litigation they are entitled to do so, only to the extent that they give timely notice to the class counsel or the court that they are opting out. Second, if there is a settlement proposal, the court will usually direct the class counsel to send a settlement notice to all the members of the certified class, informing them of the details of the proposed settlement.

In federal [[civil procedure]] law, which has also been accepted by approximately 35 states (through adoption of state civil procedure rules similar to the federal rules), the class action must have certain definite characteristics: '''(1)''' the class must be so large as to make individual suits impractical, '''(2)''' there must be legal or factual claims in common '''(3)''' the claims or defenses must be typical of the plaintiffs or defendants, and '''(4)''' the representative parties must adequately protect the interests of the class. These four requirements are often summarized as CANT: commonality, adequacy, numerosity, and typicality. In many cases, the party seeking certification must also show '''(5)''' that common issues between the class and the defendants will predominate the proceedings, as opposed to individual fact-specific conflicts between class members and the defendants and '''(6)''' that the class action, instead of individual litigation, is a superior vehicle for resolution of the disputes at hand.

=== State class actions ===
Since 1938, many states have adopted rules similar to the FRCP. However, some states like [[California]] have civil procedure systems which deviate significantly from the federal rules; the [[California Codes]] provide for four separate types of class actions. As a result, there are two separate treatises devoted solely to the complex topic of California class actions.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Cohelan on California Class Actions'' and ''California Class Actions: Practice and Procedure'' by Elisabeth Cabraser et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Some states, such as Virginia, do not provide for any class actions, while others, such as New York, limit the types of claims that may be brought as class actions.

===History===

The ancestor of the class action was what modern observers call &quot;group litigation,&quot; which appears to have been quite common in medieval England from about 1200 onward.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen C. Yeazell, ''From Medieval Group Litigation to the Modern Class Action'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1987), 38.&lt;/ref&gt; These lawsuits involved groups of people either suing or being sued in actions at common law. These groups were usually based on existing societal structures like villages, towns, parishes, and guilds. What is striking about these early cases is that unlike modern courts, the medieval English courts ''never'' questioned the right of the actual plaintiffs to sue on behalf of a group or a few representatives to defend an entire group.&lt;ref&gt;Yeazell, 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As UCLA law professor Stephen Yeazell has pointed out, the most likely reason is that the abysmally poor transportation, communications, and administrative apparatus of medieval times made it impossible for the English sovereign to directly manage the entire country in terms of individuals; it was easier to structure society by imposing obligations upon groups which were enforced by the sporadic use of force.&lt;ref name=&quot;yeazell2&quot;&gt;Yeazell, 82–86.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, lawyers and judges who operated the king's system of justice in a society strictly organized into groups would ''not'' question the right of a group to sue or be sued because to do so would bring into question the entire group-oriented society in which they operated.&lt;ref name=&quot;yeazell2&quot; /&gt;

From 1400 to 1700, group litigation gradually switched from being the norm in England to the exception.&lt;ref&gt;Yeazell, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the concept of the [[corporation]] led to the wealthy supporters of the corporate form becoming suspicious of all unincorporated legal entities, which in turn led to the modern concept of the unincorporated or [[voluntary association]].&lt;ref&gt;Yeazell, 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; The tumultuous history of the [[Wars of the Roses]] and then the [[Star Chamber]] resulted in periods during which the common law courts were frequently paralyzed, and out of the confusion the [[Court of Chancery]] emerged with exclusive jurisdiction over group litigation.&lt;ref&gt;Yeazell, 125–132.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chancery cases on group litigation after 1700 were a totally incoherent mess, which Yeazell has explained by pointing to the trends towards fragmentation and individualism in English society during that period; the resulting societal pressures ultimately led to the [[Reform Act 1832]].&lt;ref&gt;Yeazell, 173–175.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem which confounded Chancery was the shift from representation based on the ''consent'' of a group to representation based on a common ''interest'', such as holding shares of a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;Yeazell, 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; Group litigation has struggled with the tension between consent and interest ever since. 

By 1850, Parliament had enacted several statutes on a case-by-case basis to deal with issues regularly faced by certain types of organizations, like joint-stock companies, and with the impetus for most types of group litigation removed, it went into a steep decline in English jurisprudence from which it never recovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;yeazell3&quot;&gt;Yeazell, 210–212.&lt;/ref&gt; It was further weakened by the fact that equity pleading in general was falling into disfavor, which culminated in the [[Judicature Acts]] of 1874 and 1875.&lt;ref name=&quot;yeazell3&quot; /&gt;  Group litigation was essentially dead in England after 1850.

Group litigation survived in the United States only thanks to the influence of Supreme Court Associate Justice [[Joseph Story]], who imported it in a rather mangled form into [[Law of the United States|U.S. law]] through summary discussions in his two equity treatises as well as his famous opinion in ''[[West v. Randall]]'' (1820). Although Story was highly intelligent and familiar with all the relevant English precedents, he merely summarized them in a confused fashion because he &quot;could not conceive of a modern function or a coherent theory for representative litigation: why?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Yeazell, 219.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like most Americans then and since, Story took individualism for granted; on that basis, he simply could not comprehend a rule that allowed a court to bind someone who had never been a party to litigation purportedly conducted on his behalf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yeazell, 220&quot;&gt;Yeazell, 220.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The oldest predecessor to the class action rule was Equity Rule 48, promulgated in 1833, which allowed for representative suits in situations where there were too many individual parties (which now forms the first requirement for class action litigation, numerosity).&lt;ref&gt;Deborah R. Hensler, Nicholas M. Pace, Bonita Dombey-Moore, Beth Giddens, Jennifer Gross, Erik K. Moller, ''Class Action Dilemmas: Pursuing Public Goals for Private Gain'' (Santa Monica: RAND, 2000), 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this rule did not allow such suits to bind similarly situated absent parties, which rendered the rule almost entirely useless and was a direct reflection of Story's inability to understand the old English Chancery precedents.&lt;ref&gt;Yeazell, 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Story's confusion was apparently typical of 19th century American lawyers, as even the legendary [[Christopher Columbus Langdell]] also could not understand the old cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yeazell, 220&quot;/&gt;

Within ten years, the Supreme Court interpreted Rule 48 in such a way so that it could apply to absent parties under certain circumstances, but only by ignoring the plain meaning of the rule.&lt;ref&gt;Yeazell, 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, Equity Rule 48 was replaced with Equity Rule 38 as part of a major restructuring of the Equity Rules, and when federal courts merged their legal and equitable procedural systems in 1938, Equity Rule 38 became Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 

A major revision of the FRCP in 1966 radically transformed Rule 23, made the opt-out class action the standard option, and gave birth to the modern class action. Entire treatises have been written since to summarize the huge mass of law that sprung up from the 1966 revision of Rule 23.&lt;ref&gt;Yeazell, 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as medieval group litigation bound all members of the group regardless of whether they all actually appeared in court, the modern class action binds ''all'' members of the class, with the exception of those who appear and object. 

The Advisory Committee that drafted the new Rule 23 in the mid-1960s was influenced by two major developments. First was the suggestion of Harry Kalven, Jr. and Maurice Rosenfeld in 1941 that class action litigation by individual shareholders on behalf of all shareholders of a company could effectively supplement direct government regulation of securities markets and other similar markets.&lt;ref&gt;Yeazell, 232.&lt;/ref&gt; The second development was the rise of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|African-American civil rights movement]], [[environmentalism]], and [[consumerism]].&lt;ref&gt;Yeazell, 240–244.&lt;/ref&gt; As expected, the groups behind these movements, as well as many others in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s all turned to class actions as a means for achieving their goals. For example, a 1978 environmental law treatise reprinted the ''entire'' text of Rule 23 and mentioned &quot;class actions&quot; 14 times in its index.&lt;ref&gt;Yeazell, 244–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, businesses targeted by class actions for inflicting massive aggregate harm have sought ways to avoid class actions altogether. In the 1990s, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a number of decisions which strengthened the &quot;federal policy favoring [[arbitration]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Giles2005&gt;Giles M. (2005). [http://michiganlawreview.org/archive/104/3/Gilles.pdf Opting Out of Liability]. ''Michigan Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, lawyers have added provisions to consumer [[standard form contract|contracts of adhesion]] called &quot;collective action waivers&quot;. In 1999 the [[National Arbitration Forum]] began advocating that such contracts should be drafted so as to force consumers to waive the right to a class action completely, and such provisions have become very popular among businesses.&lt;ref name=Giles2005/&gt; As of November 2007, the legal validity of contracts of adhesion with class action waivers is unclear, and courts have rendered mixed and sometimes contradictory opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Quarles RD. (2007). [http://www.alabar.org/publications/articles/Nov07/courts_disagree.pdf COURTS DISAGREE: Is Arbitration a “Class” Act?]. ''Alabama Lawyer''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Class action lawsuits may offer a number of advantages&lt;ref&gt;[[Association of Trial Lawyers of America]], [http://www.atla.org/pressroom/FACTS/classactions/classactions.aspx Class Action Press Kit]
&lt;/ref&gt; because they aggregate a large number of individualized claims into one representational [[lawsuit]].

First, aggregation can increase the efficiency of the legal process, and lower the costs of litigation.[http://classaction.findlaw.com/research/cohelan/sec0104.html] In cases with common questions of law and fact, aggregation of claims into a class action may avoid the necessity of repeating &quot;days of the same [[witnesses]], [[wikt:exhibit|exhibits]] and issues from [[trial (law)|trial]] to trial.&quot; ''Jenkins v. Raymark Indus. Inc.'', 782 F.2d 468, 473 (5th Cir. 1986) (granting certification of a class action involving [[asbestos]]).

Second, a class action may overcome &quot;the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights.&quot; ''[[Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor]]'', 521 U.S. 591, 617 (1997) (quoting ''Mace v. Van Ru Credit Corp.'', 109 F.3d 388, 344 (7th Cir. 1997)). &quot;A class action solves this problem by aggregating the relatively paltry potential recoveries into something worth someone’s (usually an attorney’s) labor.&quot; ''Amchem Prods., Inc.'', 521 U.S. at 617 (quoting ''Mace'', 109 F.3d at 344). In other words, a class action ensures that a [[defendant]] who engages in widespread harm{{ndash}} but does so minimally against each individual [[plaintiff]]{{ndash}} must compensate those individuals for their injuries. For example, thousands of shareholders of a public company may have losses too small to justify separate lawsuits, but a class action can be brought efficiently on behalf of all shareholders. Perhaps even more important than compensation is that class treatment of claims may be the only way to impose the costs of wrongdoing on the wrongdoer, thus deterring future wrongdoing.

Third, class action cases may be brought to purposely change behavior of a class of which the defendant is a member. [[Landeros v. Flood]] was a landmark case used to purposely change the behavior of doctors, and encourage them to report suspected child abuse. Otherwise, they would face the threat of civil action for damages in [[tort]] proximately flowing from the failure to report the suspected injuries. Previously, many physicians had remained reluctant to report cases of apparent child abuse, despite existing law that required it. 

Fourth, in &quot;limited fund&quot; cases, a class action ensures that all [[plaintiff]]s receive relief and that early-filing plaintiffs do not raid the fund (''i.e.'', the [[defendant]]) of all its [[asset]]s before other [[plaintiffs]] may be compensated. ''See'' ''Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp.'', 527 U.S. 815 (1999). A class action in such a situation centralizes all claims into one [[Venue (law)|venue]] where a court can equitably divide the assets amongst all the [[plaintiffs]] if they win the case.

Finally, a class action avoids the situation where different court rulings could create &quot;incompatible standards&quot; of conduct for the defendant to follow. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(A). For example, a court might certify a case for class treatment where a number of individual bond-holders sue to determine whether they may convert their [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] to [[common stock]]. Refusing to litigate the case in one [[trial (law)|trial]] could result in different outcomes and inconsistent standards of conduct for the [[defendant]] [[corporation]]. Thus, courts will generally allow a class action in such a situation. ''See, e.g., Van Gemert v. Boeing Co.'', 259 F. Supp. 125 (S.D.N.Y. 1966).

Whether a class action is superior to individual [[litigation]] depends on the case, and is determined by the judge's ruling on a motion for class certification. The Advisory Committee Note to Rule 23, for example, states that [[mass tort]]s are ordinarily &quot;not appropriate&quot; for class treatment. Class treatment may not improve the efficiency of a mass tort because the claims frequently involve individualized issues of law and fact that will have to be re-tried on an individual basis. ''See Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co.'', 84 F.3d 734 (5th Cir. 1996) (rejecting nationwide class action against tobacco companies). Mass torts also involve high individual damage awards; thus, the absence of class treatment will not impede the ability of individual claimants to seek justice. ''See id.'' Other cases, however, may be more conducive to class treatment.

The preamble to the [[Class Action Fairness Act of 2005]], passed by the United States Congress, found:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Class-action lawsuits are an important and valuable part of the legal system when they permit the fair and efficient resolution of legitimate claims of numerous parties by allowing the claims to be aggregated into a single action against a defendant that has allegedly caused harm. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticisms==
There are several criticisms of class action lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;*[[Richard Allen Epstein|Richard Epstein]], [http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cjr_4.htm &quot;Class Actions: The Need for a Hard Second Look&quot;]
*[[Michael Greve]], [http://www.aei.org/book/814 &quot;Harm-Less Lawsuits? What's Wrong with Consumer Class Actions&quot;]
*[[Jim Copland]], [http://www.pointoflaw.com/classactions/overview.php &quot;Class Actions&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The preamble to the Class Action Fairness Act stated that some abusive class actions harmed class members with legitimate claims and defendants that have acted responsibly; adversely affected interstate commerce; and undermined public respect for the country's judicial system.

Class members often receive little or no benefit from class actions. Examples cited for this include large fees for the attorneys, while leaving class members with coupons or other awards of little or no value; unjustified awards are made to certain plaintiffs at the expense of other class members; and confusing notices are published that prevent class members from being able to fully understand and effectively exercise their rights.

For example, in the United States, class lawsuits sometimes bind all class members with a low [[settlement (law)|settlement]]. These &quot;[[coupon settlement]]s&quot; (which usually allow the plaintiffs to receive minimal benefit such as a small check or a coupon for future services or products with the defendant company) are a way for a defendant to forestall major liability by precluding a large number of people from litigating their claims separately, to recover reasonable compensation for the damages. However, existing law requires judicial approval of all class action settlements, and in most cases class members are given a chance to opt out of class settlement, though class members, despite opt-out notices, may be unaware of their right to opt-out because they did not receive the notice, did not read it, or did not understand it.

The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 addresses these concerns. Coupon Settlements may be scrutinized by an independent expert before judicial approval in order to ensure that the settlement will be of value to the class members. 28 U.S.C.A. 1712(d). Further, if the action provides for settlement in coupons, the attorney must take a corresponding part of his fee in coupons. 28 U.S.C.A. 1712(a).

==Ethics==
Class action cases present significant ethical challenges. Defendants can hold reverse auctions and any of several parties can engage in collusive settlement discussions. Subclasses may have interests that diverge greatly from the class, but may be treated the same. Proposed settlements could offer some groups (such as former customers) much greater benefits than others.&lt;ref&gt;Ethical Issues In Class Action Settlements http://www.jamesholmeslaw.com/Seminar%20paper.pdf - Presented at an ABA conference on class actions in 2007. Excerpt: &quot;Competing cases can also provide opportunities for collusive settlement discussions and reverse auctions by defendants anxious to resolve their exposure at the most economic cost.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defendant class action==
Although normally plaintiffs are the class, defendant class actions are also possible. For example, in 2005, the Archdiocese of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] was sued as part of the Catholic priest sex-abuse scandal. All parishioners of the Archdiocese's churches were cited as a defendant class. This was done to include their assets (local churches) in any settlement.[http://www.archdpdx.org/bankruptcy/news/class-action-notice.html] Where both the plaintiffs and the defendants have been organized into court-approved classes, the action is called a bilateral class action.

==Mass actions==
In a class action, the plaintiff seeks court approval to litigate on behalf of a group of similarly-situated persons. Not every plaintiff looks for, or could obtain, such approval. As a procedural alternative, plaintiff's counsel may attempt to sign up every similarly-situated person that counsel can find as a client. Plaintiff's counsel can then join the claims of all of these persons in one complaint, a so-called &quot;mass action,&quot; hoping to have the same efficiencies and economic leverage as if a class had been certified. 

Because mass actions operate outside the detailed procedures laid out for class actions, they can pose special difficulties for both plaintiffs, defendants, and the court. For example, settlement of class actions follows a predictable path of negotiation with class counsel and representatives, court scrutiny, and notice. There may not be a way to uniformly settle all of the many claims brought via a mass action. Some states permit plaintiff's counsel to settle for all the mass action plaintiffs according to a majority vote, for example. Other states, such as New Jersey, require each plaintiff to approve the settlement of that plaintiff's own individual claims.

== Austria ==
The Austrian Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung – ZPO) does not provide for a special proceeding for complex class action litigation. However, Austrian consumer organizations (Verein für Konsumenteninformation/VKI and the Federal Chamber of Labour/Bundesarbeitskammer) have, in recent years, brought claims on behalf of hundreds or even thousands of consumers. This technique, soon labelled as “class action Austrian style”, allows for a significant reduction of overall costs. The Austrian Supreme Court, in a recent judgment, has confirmed the legal admissibility of these lawsuits under the condition that all claims are essentially based on the same grounds.

The Austrian Parliament has unanimously requested the Austrian Federal Minister for Justice to examine the possibility of new legislation providing for a cost-effective and appropriate way to deal with mass claims. Together with the Austrian Ministry for Social Security, Generations and Consumer Protection, the Justice Ministry opened the discussion with a conference held in Vienna in June, 2005. With the aid of a group of experts from many fields, the Justice Ministry began drafting the new law in September, 2005. With the individual positions varying greatly, a political consensus could not be reached.[http://eu2006.bmsg.gv.at/cms/eu2006/attachments/4/2/7/CH0604/CMS1133429025309/klauser.pdf].

== Canada ==
Provincial laws in Canada allow class actions. All provinces permit plaintiff classes and some permit defendant classes. [[Quebec]] was the first province to enact class proceedings legislation in 1978. [[Ontario]] was next with the Class Proceedings Act, 1992. As of 2008, 9 of 10 provinces have enacted comprehensive class actions legislation. In [[Prince Edward Island]], where no comprehensive legislation exists, following the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in ''Western Canadian Shopping Centres Inc. v. Dutton'', [2001] 2 S.C.R. 534, class actions may be advanced under a local rule of court. The Federal Court of Canada permits class actions under Part V.1. of the Federal Courts Rules.

Legislation in [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]], [[Ontario]], and [[Nova Scotia]] expressly or by judicial opinion have been read to allow for what are informally known as national &quot;opt-out&quot; class actions,whereby residents of other provinces may be included in the class definition and potentially be bound by the court's judgment on common issues unless they opt-out in a prescribed manner and time. Court rulings have determined that this permits a court in one province to include residents of other provinces in the class action on an &quot;opt-out&quot; basis. 

Recent judicial opinions have indicated that provincial legislative national opt-out powers should not be exercised to interfere with the ability of another province to certify a parallel class action for residents of other provinces. The first court to certify will generally exclude residents of provinces whose courts have certified a parallel class action. However, in the [[Vioxx]] litigation, two provincial courts recently certified overlapping class actions whereby Canadian residents are class members in two class actions in two provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario: ''Tiboni v. Merck Frosst Canada Ltd.'', [2008] O.J. No. 2996.  Saskatchewan: ''Wuttunee v. Merck Frosst Canada Ltd.'', 2008 SKQB 78&lt;/ref&gt; Both decisions are under appeal.

The largest class action suit to date in Canada was settled in 2005 after [[Nora Bernard]] initiated efforts that led to an estimated 79,000 survivors of Canada's [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school system]] suing the [[Canadian government]]. The settlement amounted to upwards of $5 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apmlawyers.com/news-54.htm ''Halifax Daily News'' article on Bernard in 2006] Archived at Arnold Pizzo McKiggan&lt;/ref&gt;

== France ==
Under French law, an association can represent the collective interests of consumers; however, each claimant must be individually named in the lawsuit. On January 4, 2005, President Chirac urged changes that would provide greater consumer protection. A draft bill was proposed in April 2006. Under the proposals the court will be able to decide whether to allow an action brought by an association on behalf of consumers (which must comprise at least two individuals) for goods purchased under a standard contract. After such an action is brought, the association would be entitled to identify additional consumers for a one-month period. The court would determine the damages that must be awarded to the consumers who have opted-in to the proceedings, with damages limited to 2000 Euros; [[contingent fee]]s for attorneys would be barred.[http://www.pointoflaw.com/archives/003184.php] The president of the French Supreme Court recently declared that &quot;class actions are inescapable.&quot; [http://www.acca.com/chapters/program/acce/classaction.pdf] Nevertheless, the bill was withdrawn in January 2007 at the request of Minister of Health [[Xavier Bertrand]].[http://www.businessinsurance.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?newsId=9387]

== Germany ==
On November 1, 2005, Germany enacted the “Act on Model Case Proceedings in Disputes under Capital Markets Law (Capital Markets Model Case Act)” allowing sample proceedings to be brought before the courts in litigation arising from mass capital markets transactions. It does not apply to any other civil law proceeding. It is not like class actions in the [[United States]]{{ndash}} it only applies to parties who have already filed suit and does not allow a claim to be brought in the name of an unknown group of claimants. The effects of the new law will be monitored over the next five years. It contains a ‘sunset clause’, and it will automatically cease to have effect on November 1, 2010, unless the legislature decides to prolong the law, or extend it to other mass civil case proceedings.

== Italy ==
Italy has class action legislation now. Consumer associations can file claims on behalf of groups of consumers to obtain judicial orders against corporations that cause injury or damage to consumers. These types of claims are increasing and Italian courts have recently allowed them against banks that continue to apply compound interest on retail clients’ current account overdrafts. The introduction of class actions is on the new government’s agenda. On the 19th of November 2007 the Senato della Repubblica passed a class action law in Finanziara 2008, a financial document for the economy management of the government. Now (from 10 December 2007), in order of Italian legislation system, the law is before the House and has to be passed also by the Camera dei Deputati, the second house of Italian Parliament, to become an effective law. More information [http://www.classactionitalia.com Class Action Italia]. In 2004, the Italian parliament considered the introduction of a type of class action lawsuit, specifically in the area of consumers’ law. To date, no such law has been enacted, however scholars demonstrated that class actions (azioni rappresentative) do not contrast with Italian principles of civil procedure. Class Action is regulated by [http://www.tedioli.com/Italian_class_action_text_english_version.pdf art. 140 bis] of the Italian consumers' code and will be in force from 1 July 2009.

== India ==
Decisions of the Indian Supreme Court in the 1980s loosened strict ''locus standi'' requirements to permit the filing of suits on behalf of rights deprived sections of society by public minded individuals or bodies. Although not strictly &quot;class action litigation&quot; as it is understood in American law, Public Interest Litigation arose out of the wide powers of judicial review granted to the Supreme Court of India and the various High Courts under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution of India respectively. The sort of remedies sought from courts in Public Interest Litigation go beyond mere award of damages to all affected groups and have sometimes (controversially) gone on to include Court monitoring of the implementation of legislation and even the framing of guidelines in the absence of Parliamentary legislation. 

However, this innovative jurisprudence did not help the victims of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy who were unable to fully prosecute a class action litigation (as understood in the American sense) against Union Carbide due to procedural rules that would make such litigation impossible to conclude and unwieldy to carry out. Instead, the Government of India exercised its right of parens patriae to appropriate all the claims of the victims and proceeded to litigate on their behalf, first in the New York courts and later, in the Indian courts. Ultimately, the matter was settled between the Union of India and Union Carbide (in a settlement overseen by the Supreme Court of India) for a sum of Rs. 760 crores (about 400 million dollars) as a complete settlement of all claims of all victims for all time to come. 

Public Interest Litigation has now broadened in scope to cover larger and larger groups of citizens who may be affected by Government inaction. Recent examples of this trend include the conversion of all public transport in the city of Delhi from Diesel engines to CNG engines on the basis of the orders of the Delhi High Court; the monitoring of forest use by the High Courts and the Supreme Court to ensure that there is no unjustified loss of forest cover; and the directions mandating the disclosure of assets of electoral candidates for the Houses of Parliament and State Assembly. 

However, of late, the Supreme Court has observed that the PIL has tended to become a means to gain publicity or obtain relief contrary to constitutionally valid legislation and policy. Observers point out that many High Courts and certain Supreme Court judges are reluctant to entertain PILs, even those filed by well known Non-Governmental Organizations and activists, citing concerns of balance of powers and the importance of democratic law making.

== Netherlands ==
Dutch law allows collective actions brought by associations on behalf of injured parties seeking a judicial declaration that the company is liable for the damage it has caused (section 3:305a Dutch Civil Code). Moreover, a settlement agreement with the association as one of the parties, can be declared binding for all injured parties by the Amsterdam Court of Appeal (section 7:907 Dutch Civil Code). The injured parties have an opt-out right.

== Spain ==
Spanish law allows nominated consumer associations to take action to protect the interests of consumers. A number of groups already have the power to bring collective or class actions: certain consumer associations, bodies legally constituted to defend the ‘collective interest’ and groups of injured parties. See [http://www.law.stanford.edu/display/images/dynamic/events_media/spain_national_report.pdf  Class Actions in Spain]

Recent changes to Spanish civil procedure rules include the introduction of a quasi-class action right for certain consumer associations to claim damages on behalf of unidentified classes of consumers. The rules require consumer associations to represent an adequate number of affected parties who have suffered the same harm. Also any judgment made by the Spanish court will list the individual beneficiaries or, if that is not possible, conditions that need to be fulfilled for a party to benefit from a judgment.

== Switzerland ==
Swiss law does not allow for any form of class action. When the [[Swiss Federal Council|government]] proposed a new [[Swiss Code of Civil Procedure|federal code of civil procedure]] in 2006, replacing the cantonal codes of civil procedure, it rejected the introduction of class actions, arguing that:
{{quote|[It] is alien to European legal thought to allow somebody to exercise rights on the behalf of a large number of people if these do not participate as parties in the action. ... Moreover, the ''class action'' is controversial even in its country of origin, the U.S., because it can result in significant procedural problems. ... Finally, the ''class action'' can be openly or discretely abused. The sums sued for are usually enormous, so that the respondent can be forced to concede, if they do not want to face sudden [[debt|huge indebtness]] and [[insolvency]] (so-called ''legal [[blackmail]]'').|&lt;ref&gt;Message to Parliament on the Swiss Code of Civil Procedure, [http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/ff/2006/index0_37.html Federal Journal 2006 p. 7221] et seq.

'''Contempt of court''' is a [[court order]] which, in the context of a court [[Trial (law)|trial]] or [[Hearing (law)|hearing]], declares a person or organization to have disobeyed or been disrespectful of the [[court]]'s authority. Often referred to simply as &quot;contempt,&quot; such as a person &quot;held in contempt,&quot; it is the [[judge]]'s strongest power to impose [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]] for acts which disrupt the court's normal process.

A finding of contempt of court may result from a failure to obey a lawful order of a court, showing disrespect for the judge, disruption of the proceedings through poor behaviour, or publication of material deemed likely to jeopardize a [[fair trial]].  A judge may impose sanctions such as a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] or [[jail]]  for someone found guilty of contempt of court.  Judges in [[common law]] systems usually have more extensive power to declare someone in contempt than judges in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems. The client or person must be proven to be guilty before he/she will be punished.

In civil cases involving disputes between private citizens, the behaviour resulting in the ruling is often directed at one of the parties involved rather than at the court directly.

A person found in contempt of court is called a &quot;contemnor.&quot;  To prove contempt, the prosecutor or complainant must prove the four elements of contempt:
 
*   Existence of a lawful order
*   The contemnor's knowledge of the order
*   The contemnor's ability to comply
*   The contemnor's failure to comply
 
==Australia==
In [[Australia]] a judge may impose a fine or jail. The latter is usually until such time as a person has performed a sincere act of contrition (i.e., purging the offense) or the order is no longer deemed necessary to the carriage of justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewsmanual.net/Resources/medialaw_in_australia_03.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
Criminal offences are found within the [[Criminal Code of Canada]] or other federal/provincial laws, with the exception that contempt of court is the only remaining [[common law offence]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/legal_compendium/Chapter22.asp A Compendium of Law and Judges]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contempt of Court includes the following behaviours:
* Fails to maintain a respectful attitude, remain silent or refrain from showing approval or disapproval of the proceeding
* Refuses or neglects to obey a subpoena
* Willfully disobeys a process or order of the Court
* Interfere with the orderly administration of justice or to impair the authority or dignity of the Court
* Officer of the Court fails to perform his or her duties
* Sheriff and/or bailiff does not execute a writ forthwith or does not make a return thereof

===Federal Courts===
''This section applies only to [[Federal Court of Appeal]] and [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]].''

Under Federal Court Rules, section 472, a person who is accused of Contempt needs to be first served with a contempt order and then appear in court to answer the charges. Convictions can only be made when proof beyond a reasonable doubt is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reports.fja.gc.ca/regles/partie12.html Federal Court Rules Chapter 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

If it's a matter of urgency or the contempt was done in front of a judge, that person can be punished immediately. Punishment can range from the person being imprisoned for a period of less than five years or until the person complies with the order or fine.

===Tax Court of Canada===
Under [[Tax Court of Canada]] Rules of ''Tax Court of Canada Act'', a person who is found to be in contempt may be imprisoned for a period of less than two years or fined. Similar procedures for serving an order first is also used at the Tax Court.

===Provincial Courts===
Different procedures exist for different provincial courts. For example, in [[British Columbia|BC]], [[Justice of Peace]] can only issue summon to the offender for Contempt, for which will be dealt with by a judge, even if the offence was done at the face of the Justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/P/96379_01.htm#section31 Provincial Court Act Jurisdiction of justice]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong==
Judges from the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]], [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]], [[District Court (Hong Kong)|District Courts]] along with members from the various tribunals and Coroner's Court all have the power to impose immediate punishments for contempt in the face of the court, derived from legislation or through [[common law]]:

* Insult a judge or justice, witness or [[officers of the court]]
* Interrupts the proceedings of the Court
* Interfere with the course of justice
* Misbehaves in court (i.e. use of [[mobile phone]] or recording devices without permission)
* [[Juror]] who leaves without permission of the court during proceedings
* Disobeying a judgment or court order
* Breach of undertaking
* Breach of a duty imposed upon a solicitor by rules of court

The use of insulting or threatening language in the [[magistrates' court (Hong Kong)|magistrates' courts]] or against a magistrate is in breach of HK Laws. Chap 227 ''Magistrates Ordinance'' Section 99 which states the magistrate can 'summarily sentence the offender to a fine at level 3 and to imprisonment for 6 months.

In addition, certain appeal boards are given the statutory authority for contempt by them (i.e. Residential Care Home, Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation, Air Pollution Control, etc). For contempt in front of these boards, the chairperson will certify the act of contempt to the [[Court of First Instance (Hong Kong)|Court of First Instance]] who will then proceed with a hearing and determine the punishment.

==England==
In [[England|English]] law (a [[common law]] jurisdiction) the law on contempt is partly set out in case law, and partly specified in the [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]]. Contempt may be a [[Crime|criminal]] or [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] offence. The maximum sentence for criminal contempt is two years.

Disorderly, contemptuous, or insolent behaviour toward the judge or magistrates while holding the court, tending to interrupt the due course of a trial or other judicial proceeding, may be prosecuted as &quot;direct&quot; contempt.  The term &quot;direct&quot; means that the court itself cites the person in contempt by describing the behaviour observed on the record.  Direct contempt is distinctly different from indirect contempt, wherein another individual  may file papers alleging contempt against a person who has willfully violated a lawful court order.

===Criminal contempt of court===
The [[Crown Court]] is a court of record under the [[Supreme Court Act 1981]] and accordingly has power to punish for contempt of its own motion. The Divisional Court has stated that this power applies in three circumstances:

# Contempt &quot;in the face of the court&quot; (not to be taken literally; the judge does not need to see it, provided it took place within the court precincts or relates to a case currently before that court);
# Disobedience of a court order; and
# Breaches of undertakings to the court.

Where it is necessary to act quickly the judge (even the trial judge) may act to sentence for contempt.

Where it is not necessary to be so urgent, or where indirect contempt has taken place the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] can intervene and the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] will institute criminal proceedings on his behalf before the Divisional Court of the [[Queen's Bench Division]] of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales]] (Criminal Division).

[[Magistrates' Court]]s are not courts of record, but nonetheless have powers granted under the [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]]. They may detain any person who insults the court or otherwise disrupts its proceedings until the end of the sitting.  Upon the contempt being either admitted or proved the judge or [[Justice of the peace|JP]] may imprison the offender for a maximum of one month, fine them up to [[Pound sterling|GBP]] £2,500, or do both.

It is contempt of court to bring an audio recording device or picture-taking device of any sort into an English court without the consent of the court.

It is not contempt of court (under section 10 of the Act) for a journalist to refuse to disclose his sources, unless the court has considered the evidence available and determined that the information is &quot;necessary in the interests of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or crime.&quot;

===Strict liability contempt===
Under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 it is criminal contempt of court to publish anything which creates a real risk that the course of justice in proceedings may be seriously impaired. It only applies where proceedings are active, and the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] has issued guidance as to when he believes this to be the case, and there is also statutory guidance. The clause prevents the newspapers and media from publishing material that is too extreme or sensationalist about a criminal case until the trial is over and the jury has given its verdict.

Section 2 of the Act limits the [[common law]] presumption that conduct may be treated as contempt regardless of intention: now only cases where there is a substantial risk of serious prejudice to a trial are affected.

===Civil contempt===
In civil proceedings there are two main ways in which contempt is committed:

# Failure to attend at court despite a [[subpoena]] requiring attendance. In respect of the High Court, historically a [[writ]] of [[latitat]] would have been issued, but now a [[bench warrant]] is issued, authorizing the [[tipstaff]] to arrange for the arrest of the individual, and imprisonment until the date and time the court appoints to next sit. In practice a groveling letter of apology to the court is sufficient to ward off this possibility, and in any event the warrant is generally 'backed for bail' i.e. [[bail]] will be granted once the arrest has been made and a location where the person can be found in future established.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
# Failure to comply with a court order. A copy of the order, with a &quot;penal notice&quot;—i.e. notice informing the recipient that if they do not comply they are subject to imprisonment—is served on the person concerned. If, after that, they breach the order, proceedings can be started and in theory the person involved can be sent to prison. In practice this rarely happens as the cost on the claiming of bringing these proceedings is significant and in practice imprisonment is rarely ordered as an apology or fine are usually considered appropriate.

==United States==
Under American [[jurisprudence]], acts of contempt are divided into civil, which is an equitable remedy, and criminal contempt that is a crime and requires trial by jury for imprisonment greater than six months. Civil contempt has been imposed with little or no constitutional rights by judges who claim &quot;inherent&quot; power to simply imprison citizens without trial for life until they die as in [[Bleak House]] written by [[Charles Dickens]]. The abuse of criminal contempt by Federal Judge [[James H. Peck]] who threw a lawyer in prison for writing an article in the newspaper critical of the judge contrary to the freedom of the press, led to an impeachment trial and a revision of the criminal contempt power restricting its use to events in the courtroom or nearby where otherwise a judge could act like a king. Criminal contempt is generally two types.

# '''Direct contempt''' is that which occurs in the presence of the presiding judge (''in facie curiae'') and may be dealt with summarily: the judge notifies the offending party that he or she has acted in a manner which disrupts the tribunal and prejudices the administration of justice. After giving the person the opportunity to respond, the judge may impose the sanction immediately.
# '''Indirect contempt''' occurs outside the immediate presence of the court and consists of disobedience of a court's prior order. Generally a party will be accused of indirect contempt by the party for whose benefit the order was entered. A person cited for indirect contempt is entitled to notice of the charge and an opportunity for hearing of the evidence of contempt and to present evidence in rebuttal.

Contempt of court in a [[civil suit]] is generally not considered to be a criminal offense, with the party benefiting from the order also holding responsibility for the enforcement of the order. However, some cases of civil contempt have been perceived as intending to harm the reputation of the plaintiff, or to a lesser degree, the judge or the court.

Sanctions for contempt may be criminal or civil. If a person is to be punished criminally, then the contempt must be proven beyond a [[Legal burden of proof|reasonable doubt]], but once the charge is proven, then punishment (such as a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] or, in more serious cases, imprisonment) is imposed unconditionally. This has been an unaddressed abuse of judicial power. Many judges read the law with blinders when it comes to restricting their own power. They cite the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] (ch. 20, 1 Stat. 73-93), §17 which reads:

* '''And be it further enacted, That all the said courts of the United States shall have power to grant new trials, in cases where there has been a trial by jury for reasons for which new trials have usually been granted in the courts of law; and shall have power to impose and administer all necessary oaths or affirmations, and to punish by fine or imprisonment, at the discretion of said courts, all contempts of authority in any cause or hearing before the same; and to make and establish all necessary rules for the orderly conducting business in the said courts, provided such rules are not repugnant to the laws of the United States.'''

Because §17 does not mention any duration for imprisonment, some judges prefer to read this in such a way as they can imprison you for life following the practice of the most notorious judge in Anglo-American Jurisprudence, Lord Chief Judge [[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys]], and his sentence of [[Titus Oates]] in a misdemeanor case of perjury. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin [[Scalia]], in the majority opinion in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 67 (2004), wrote that '''&quot;[The Framers of the Constitution] knew that judges, like other government officers, could not always be trusted to safeguard the rights of the people; the likes of the dread Lord Jeffreys were not yet too distant a memory.&quot;''' Justice [[Scalia]] also wrote the landmark decision on Cruel and Unusual Punishment in Harmelin v Michigan, 501 US 957 (1991) where he explained:

* '''&quot;At sentencing, Jeffreys complained that death was no longer available as a penalty, and lamented that &quot;a proportionable punishment of that crime can scarce by our law, as it now stands, be inflicted upon him.&quot; Second Trial of Titus Oates, 10 How.St.Tr. 1227, 1314 (K.B. 1685). The law would not stand in the way, however. The judges met, and, according to Jeffreys, were in unanimous agreement that &quot;crimes of this nature are left to be punished according to the discretion of this court, so far as that the judgment extend not to life or member.&quot; Ibid. Another justice taunted Oates that &quot;we have taken special care of you,&quot; id. at 1316. The court then decreed that he should pay a fine of &quot;1000 marks upon each Indictment,&quot; that he should be &quot;stript of [his] Canonical Habits,&quot; that he should stand in the pillory annually at certain specified times and places, that, on May 20, he should be whipped by &quot;the common hangman&quot; &quot;from Aldgate to Newgate,&quot; that he should be similarly whipped on May 22 &quot;from Newgate to Tyburn,&quot; and that he should be imprisoned for life. Ibid. &quot;The judges, as they believed, sentenced Oates to be scourged to death.&quot; 2 T. Macaulay, History of England 204 (1899) (hereinafter Macaulay).&quot; id./970'''

Those judges who prefer to read §17 as unlimited power commit the same offense against the people as did Lord Jeffreys, who inspired the Eighth Amendment prohibition against the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment. Justice [[Scalia]] in the Harmelin decision explained that a cruel and unusual punishment  '''is &quot;out of [the Judges'] Power,&quot; &quot;contrary to Law and ancient practice,&quot; without &quot;Precedents&quot; or &quot;express Law to warrant,&quot; &quot;unusual,&quot; &quot;illegal,&quot; or imposed by &quot;Pretence to a discretionary Power.&quot;''' While §17 does not mention the penalty, §9 does, which judges ignore like Lord Jeffreys because it limits their power:

* '''§9. And be it further enacted, That the district courts shall have, exclusively of the courts of the several States, cognizance of all crimes and offences that shall be cognizable under the authority of the United States, committed within their respective districts, or upon the high seas; where no other punishment than whipping, not exceeding thirty stripes, a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months, is to be inflicted ...'''

For years, judges refused to afford those they threw in prison under criminal contempt any rights at all, adopting the expansive powers of Lord Jeffreys. Finally, criminal contempt was recognized to be a crime only in Gompers v Buck Stove &amp; Range, 211 US 418 (1911). The right to trial by jury was not established until the 1960s, Cheff v Schnackenberg, 384 US 373 (1966) and Bloom v Illinois, 391 US 191 (1968). Yet to this day, judges claim Jeffrey's mantle by acknowledging they have to give a trial by jury to imprison a citizen beyond 6 months, but they reserve the discretion to sentence someone to die in prison without any restraint or limitation claiming this is an inherited power from England. They ignore §9 and the fact that criminal contempt is still a misdemeanor. That means, the term of imprisonment cannot exceed one year pursuant to 18 USC §3559. Even later contempt statutes such as 18 USC §1509 state there is a limit of one year for refusing to comply with a judicial order. Restraining judicial power has been a problem for centuries. In 1859, [[John Stuart Mill]] wrote in his celebrated work, [[On Liberty]], '''&quot;let us not flatter ourselves that we are yet free from the stain of legal persecution.&quot;''' The same remains true today and it get much worse under the civil label.

The civil sanction for contempt (which is typically incarceration in the custody of the [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] or similar court officer) is limited in its imposition for so long as the disobedience to the court's order continues: once the party complies with the court's order, the sanction is lifted. The imposed party is said to &quot;hold the keys&quot; to his or her own cell, thus conventional [[due process of law|due process]] is not required. The [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] for civil contempt, however, is a preponderance of the evidence,where a judge simply claims he believes it is more likely than not, and punitive sanctions (punishment) can only be imposed after due process meaning a jury trial to imprison beyond 6 months. Some judges circumvent that by creating multiple contempts (counts) out of the same disobedience and then impose 6 months for each count.

In civil contempt, there is still no right to trial by jury eliminating the right of the people to determine guilty, the foundation of a democracy, and where the Supreme Court has held that the title to assets is a jury question, Grupo Mexicano v Alliance Bond Fund, 527 US 308 (1999), judges still deny that right and under civil contempt and order people thrown in prison claiming they determine some asset must be turned over denying due process of law. In Maggio v Zeitz, 333 US 56 (1948) it was held a turnover order can only be ordered for restitution where a disputed title must be submitted to jury. When turnover orders were first being created by judges during the Great Depression, the Second Circuit ruled '''&quot;We would hold that a turnover proceeding may not, via a fiction, be substituted for a criminal prosecution so as to deprive a man of a basic constitutional right, the right of trial by jury.&quot;''' In re Luma Camera Service, 157 F2d 951, 953-954 (2d Cir 1946). Today, most judges will ignore the right to trial by jury and imprison citizens indefinitely still with no rights whatsoever under the civil label.

In civil contempt cases there is no [[Proportionality (law)|principle of proportionality]]. In ''[[Chadwick v. Janecka]]'' (3d Cir. 2002), a U.S. court of appeals held that [[H. Beatty Chadwick]] could be held indefinitely under federal law, for his failure to produce US$ 2.5 mill. as state court ordered in a civil divorce trial. Chadwick had been imprisoned for nine years at that time and continued to be held in prison until 2009, when a state court set him free after 14 years, making him the longest person imprisoned on a contempt charge to date.  The civil contempt power claimed by judges has now eliminated the freedom of the press as [[Judith Miller (journalist)]] of the New York Times was imprisoned for 3 months until she agreed to reveal her sources involving the disclosing of Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA agent commonly known as the [[Plame Affair]]. The serious abuse of the contempt power means that events such as the [[Watergate]] scandal that exposed President [[Richard Nixon]] could not take place today for a journalist could not refuse to reveal a source eliminating investigative reporting for today there could no longer be a &quot;[[Deep Throat]]&quot; informant.

There is serious disagreement among judges as to the extent of their power. Justice Antonin Gregory [[Scalia]] wrote the '''&quot;prosecution of individuals who disregard court orders (except orders necessary to protect the courts' ability to function) is not an exercise of '[t]he judicial power of the United States.'&quot;''' Young v US ex rel Vuitton, 481 US 787, 815 (1987). One of the most respected Jurists is Judge [[Richard Posner]] warned that there is the danger of abuse and that '''&quot;criminal punishment [can be] masquerading as civil contempt&quot;''' and made clear that civil contempt is just an equity remedy and '''not''' the &quot;inherent&quot; power of courts of self-defense that is limited to criminal contempt. Matter of Grand Jury Proceedings Empanelled May 1988, 894 F2d 881, 885 (7th Cir 1989). Nonetheless, Judge [[John M. Walker]] in Armstrong v Guccione, 470 F3d 89 (2d Cir 2006) held Martin Armstrong in prison for more than 7 years on civil contempt and denied any right to a trial by jury or a lawyer claiming '''&quot;inherent&quot;''' power, but the contempt was vacated when it appeared the Supreme Court was about the review the case.

==In use today==
Contempt of court is essentially seen as a form of disturbance that may impede the functionality of the court.  The judge may impose fines and or jail time upon any person committing contempt of court.  The person is usually let out upon his agreement to fulfill the wishes of the court.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, G.

The judge will make use of warnings in most any situation that may lead to a person being charged with contempt.  It is relatively rare that a person is charged for contempt without first receiving at least one warning from the judge.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, G. (2008). Contempt of Court.

[http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?typed=contempt&amp;type=1&amp;submit1.x=0&amp;submit1.y=0&amp;submit1=Look+up]&lt;/ref&gt; Constructive contempt, also called consequential contempt is when a person fails to fulfill the will of the court as it applies to outside obligations of the person.  In most cases, constructive contempt is considered to be in the realm of civil contempt because of its passive nature.

Indirect contempt is something that is associated with civil and constructive contempt and involves a failure to follow court orders. Criminal contempt includes anything that could be called a disturbance such as repeatedly talking out of turn, bringing forth previously banned evidence, or harassment of any other party in the courtroom.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, G.

'''Corroborating evidence''' (in &quot;'''corroboration'''&quot;) is evidence that tends to support a proposition that is already supported by some evidence, therefore confirming the proposition. For example, W, a witness, testifies that she saw X drove his automobile into a green car.  Meanwhile Y, another witness, testifies that when he examined X's car, later that day, he noticed green paint on its fender. Or there can be corroborating evidence related to a certain source, such as what makes an author think a certain way due to the evidence that was supplied by witnesses or objects.

For more information on this type of reasoning, see: [[Casuistry]].

Another type of corroborating evidence comes from using the [[Baconian method]], i.e. the  [[method of agreement]], [[Mill's Methods#Method of difference|method of difference]], and [[method of concomitant variations]].

These methods are followed in [[experimental design]]. They were codified by [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]], and developed further by [[John Stuart Mill]] and consist of controlling several [[variables]], in turn, to establish which variables are [[causality|causally]] connected. These principles are widely used intuitively in various kinds of proofs, demonstrations and investigations, in addition to being fundamental to experimental design.

In law, corroboration refers to the requirement in some jurisdictions, such as in [[Scots Law|Scotland]], that any evidence adduced be backed up by at least one other source.

Corroboration is not needed in certain instances. For example, there are certain statutory exceptions. In the Education (Scotland) Act, it is only necessary to produce a register as proof of lack of attendance. No further evidence is needed.

{{Evidence law}}
In [[law]], '''cross-examination''' is the interrogation of a [[witness]] called by one's opponent.  It is preceded by [[direct examination]] (in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Scotland]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] known as [[examination-in-chief]]) and may be followed by a [[Redirect examination|redirect]] ([[re-examination]] in [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Pakistan]]).

== Variations by Jurisdiction ==
In the [[United States federal courts]], a cross-examining [[lawyer|attorney]] is typically not permitted to ask questions which do not pertain to the testimony offered during direct examination, but most [[State court (United States)|state courts]] do permit a lawyer to cross-examine a witness on matters not raised during direct examination.  Similarly, courts in England, Australia, and Canada allow a cross-examiner to exceed the scope of direct examination.

Since a witness called by the opposing party is presumed to be [[hostile witness|hostile]], cross-examination does permit [[leading question]]s. A witness called by the direct examiner, on the other hand, may only be treated as hostile by that examiner after being permitted to do so by the judge, at the request of that examiner and as a result of the witness being openly antagonistic and/or prejudiced against the opposing party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/lawreview/issues/232/ehrhardt.html Ehrhardt, Charles W. and Stephanie J. Young, &quot;Using Leading Questions During Direct Examination,&quot; (Florida State University Law Review, 1996). (accessed November 26, 2008).]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main purposes of cross-examination are to elicit favorable facts from the witness, or to impeach the credibility of the testifying witness to lessen the weight of unfavorable testimony. Cross-examination frequently produces critical evidence in [[trial]]s, especially if a witness contradicts previous testimony. The advocate [[Edward Marshall-Hall]] built his career on cross-examination which often involved histrionic outbursts designed to sway jurors. Most experienced and skilled cross-examiners however, refrain from caustic or abrasive cross-examination so as to avoid alienating jurors. [[John Mortimer]], [[Queen's Counsel]], observed that &quot;cross-examination&quot; was not the art of examining crossly.  Indeed the good cross-examiner gets a witness to assert to a series of linked propositions culminating in one that undermines that witnesses' evidence rather than pursuing an antagonistic approach.

== The Art of Cross-Examination ==
Cross-examination is considered an essential component of a [[jury trial]] due to the impact it has on the opinions of the judge and jury.
Few lawyers practice trial law or complex [[litigation]] and typically refer such cases to those who have the time, resources and experience to handle a complex trial and the commitment involved to complete a trial successfully. Few attorneys get the practice necessary to develop the techniques needed to do an effective job cross-examining a witness. It is sometimes referred to as an art form, due to the need for an attorney to know precisely how to elicit the testimony from the opposing witness that will help, not hinder their client's case. Typically a cross-examiner must not only be effective at getting the [[witness]] to reveal the truth, but in most cases to reveal confusion as to the facts such as time, dates, people, places, wording etc. More often than not a cross-examiner will also attempt to undermine the credibility of a witness if he will not be perceived to be a bull (such as discrediting a very elderly person or young child). The cross-examiner often needs to discredit a potentially biased or damaging witness in the eyes of the jury without appearing to be doing so in an unfair way. Typically the cross-examiner must appear friendly, talk softly and sincerely to relax the guarded witness. They typically begin repeating similar basic questions in a variety of different ways to get different responses which will then be used against the witness as misstatements of fact later when the attorney wants to make their point. If it is too obvious the questions are too clearly repetitive and making the witness nervous, the other attorney may accuse the cross examiner of [[badgering the witness]]. There is a fine line between badgering and getting the witness to restate facts differently that is typically pursued. The less the witness says, and the slower the witness speaks, the more control they can maintain under the pressure of a crafty opponent. The key for a witness is to understand the facts that they believe to be the case and not add additional thoughts to those facts, less they be used to undermine the actual facts. Sticking to the brief known facts is key for the witness, making it difficult for the cross-examiner to make the witness appear confused, biased or deceitful. The cross examiner will assume the witness has been told that and begin asking supporting questions about where the witness was, what time it was, what the witness saw, what they said.. and sooner or later upon asking again the witness may use a different word that will give the cross-examiner a chance to ask the question again doubtfully and pointedly implying contradiction. The witness will try typically to explain and clarify which sometimes reveals weakness in the witness's statements of fact. Other times the witness is just being truthful but undermined for the purpose of casting doubt to the jury and or judge.

There is a measure of drama that cross-examination adds to any trial due to the challenging of the statements made by a witness. In the 1903 book titled ''The Art of Cross-Examination'' by [[Francis L. Wellmann]] much effort is devoted to highlighting components of cross-examination and the impact on trials of the past century. An example of an inflammtory way a question will be asked by a cross-examiner to a witness he was trying to undermine would be .. &quot; What is your recollection toDAY?&quot; implying it was stated differently yesterday. Simply the accent of syllables can leave a bewildered jury believing they must put their guard up with a witness - or in some cases the cross-examiner if they are not careful. The book freely uses accenting in its dialogue to give the reader such insight as to how cross-examiners rattle witnesses to obtain their desired effect for the jury.

== Affecting The Outcome of Jury Trials ==
Cross-examination is a key component in a trial. The opinions by a jury or judge are often changed during cross examination if doubt is cast on the witness. In other times a credible witness affirms the belief in their original statements or in some cases enhances the judges or juries belief. Though the closing argument is often considered the deciding moment of a trial, effective cross-examination wins trials.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.relentlessdefense.com/relentless-criminal-cross-examination.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically during an attorney's [[closing argument]] they will repeat any admissions made by witnesses that favor their case. Indeed, in the United States, cross-examination is seen as a core part of the entire [[adversarial system]] of justice, in that it &quot;is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Davis v. Alaska'', {{ussc|415|308|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another key component affecting a trial outcome is the [[jury selection]], in which attorneys will attempt to include jurors from whom they feel they can get a favorable response or at the least unbiased fair decision. So while there are many factors effecting the outcome of a trial, the cross-examination of a witness will often have an impact on an open minded unbiased jury searching for the certainty of facts with which to base their decision upon.

==Biography==
D'Abancourt was [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s last [[List of Defence Ministers of France|minister of war]] (July 1792), and organised the defence of the [[Tuileries Palace]] during the [[10th of August (French Revolution)|10th of August attack]]. Ordered by the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] to send away the [[Swiss guard]]s, he refused, and was arrested for treason to the nation and sent to [[Orléans]] to be tried.

At the end of August the Assembly ordered Abancourt and the other prisoners at Orléans to be transferred to [[Paris]] with an escort commanded by [[Claude Fournier]] ''l'Americain''. At [[Versailles]], they learned of the [[September Massacres]] in Paris. Abancourt and his fellow-prisoners were murdered in cold blood in [[9 September massacres|massacres]] on 9 September 1792, and Fournier was unjustly charged with complicity in the crime.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Weiss|Weiss, Charles]].

The '''[[Curtiss-Wright|Curtiss]] P-40 Warhawk''' was an [[United States|American]] single-engine, single-seat, all-metal [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] and [[ground attack aircraft]] that first flew in 1938. It was used by the air forces of 28 nations, including those of most [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] during [[World War II]], and remained in front line service until the end of the war. It was the third most produced American fighter ever, after the [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51]] and [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]]; by November 1944, when production of the P-40 ceased, 13,738 had been built,&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;Murphy and McNiece 2009, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; all at [[Curtiss-Wright|Curtiss-Wright Corporation]]'s main production facility at [[Buffalo, New York]].

The P-40 design was a modification of the previous Curtiss [[P-36 Hawk|P-36]]; this reduced development time and enabled a rapid entry into production and operational service.

'''Warhawk''' was the name the [[United States Army Air Corps]] adopted for all models, making it the official name in the United States for all P-40s. The [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet]] air forces used the name '''Tomahawk''' for models equivalent to the P-40B and P-40C, and the name '''Kittyhawk''' for models equivalent to the P-40D and all later variants.

The P-40's lack of a [[supercharger|two-stage supercharger]] made it inferior to ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' fighters such as the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] or the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] in high altitude combat and it was rarely used in operations in [[Western Front (World War II)|Northwest Europe]]. Between 1941 and 1944, however, the P-40 played a critical role with [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air forces in three major theaters: [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific]] and [[Second Sino-Japanese War|China]]. It also had a significant role in the [[Middle East Campaign|Middle East]], [[South-East Asian Theatre of World War II|Southeast Asia]], [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Europe]], [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Alaska]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]]. The P-40's high altitude performance was not as critical in those theaters, where it served as an [[air supremacy]] fighter, bomber escort and [[fighter bomber]].

P-40s first saw combat with the British Commonwealth squadrons of the [[Desert Air Force]] (DAF) in the Middle East and North African campaigns, during June 1941.&lt;ref name = &quot;nijbrw&quot;&gt;Alexander 2006, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;lmnsbs&quot;&gt;Brown 1983, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Air Force]]'s [[No. 112 Squadron RAF|No. 112 Squadron]] was among the first to operate Tomahawks, in [[North Africa]], and the unit was the first to feature the &quot;shark mouth&quot; logo,&lt;ref name=Crawford&gt;Crawford 1977, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; copying similar markings on some ''Luftwaffe'' [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] twin-engine fighters.&lt;ref name=Crawford/&gt; {{#tag:ref|Inspired by 112 Squadron's usage of them in North Africa, and by the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s even earlier use of it, both via Allied wartime newspaper and magazine article images, the &quot;shark mouth&quot; logo's usage on the sides of the P-40's nose was most famously used on those used by the [[Flying Tigers]] in [[China]].  The Bf 110s were from ''II Gruppe/[[Zerstörergeschwader 26]]''. Shilling, an AVG pilot indicated, &quot;I was looking through a British magazine one day and saw a photo of a Messerschmitt-110 with a shark face on it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flyingtigerline.org/memoriam/schilling_erik.htm Erik Shilling&amp;mdash; ''Off on his Last Flight''.] Retrieved: 28 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}}
 
In theatres where high altitude performance was less important, the P-40 proved an effective fighter. Although it gained a post-war reputation as a mediocre design, suitable only for [[close air support]], more recent research including scrutiny of the records of individual Allied squadrons indicates that the P-40 performed surprisingly well as an [[air superiority]] fighter, at times suffering severe losses, but also taking a very heavy toll on enemy aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;P40Zero&quot;/&gt; The P-40 offered the additional advantage of low cost, which kept it in production as a ground attack fighter long after it was obsolete in air superiority.

As of 2008, 19 P-40s were airworthy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warbirdalley.com/p40.htm &quot;Curtiss P-40 Warhawk.&quot;] ''Warbird Alley.'' Retrieved: 18 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and development==
[[Image:Xp 40.jpg|right|thumb|An XP-40, ''11 MD'', which was used for test purposes by the [[Air Force Materiel Command|Materiel Division]] of the U.S. Army Air Corps]]

The prototype XP-40,flying for the first time in October 1938, was the 10th production Curtiss [[P-36 Hawk]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Famous Fighters&quot;&gt;Green 1957&lt;/ref&gt; with its [[Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830]] (Twin Wasp) 14-cylinder air-cooled [[radial engine]] replaced by a liquid-cooled, supercharged [[Allison V-1710]] [[V12 engine|V-12]] engine. The V-12 engine offered as much power as a radial engine but had smaller, more aerodynamic frontal area and therefore did not have as much drag as aircraft with radial engines. &lt;!---this statement is uncited and appears to be original research rather than an accepted fact---However, the fuselage was sized for a radial engine, and thus was significantly wider than aircraft designed from the outset for liquid-cooled engines (a fact often commented on by British pilots who were familiar with Hurricanes and Spitfires).----&gt;

===Performance characteristics===
[[Image:00910460 023.jpg|left|thumb|A three-quarter view of a P-40B, X-804 (''39-184'') in flight. This aircraft served with an advanced training unit at [[Luke Air Force Base|Luke Field]], Arizona.]]
The P-40 had good agility, especially at high speed and medium to low altitude. It was one of the tightest-turning [[monoplane]] fighters of the war,&lt;ref name=&quot;Flying&quot;&gt;Hingam 2004&lt;/ref&gt; although at lower speeds it could not out-turn the extremely maneuverable [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] fighters such as the [[A6M Zero]] and [[Nakajima Ki-43]] &quot;Oscar&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;P40Zero&quot;&gt;Masell, Patrick. [http://www.chuckhawks.com/p-40_vs_zero.htm &quot;The P-40 and the Zero.&quot;] ''Naval Aviation and Military History'', 2002. Retrieved: 7 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Allison V-1710 engines produced about {{convert|1040|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at sea level and at {{convert|14000|ft|m|abbr=on}}: not powerful by the standards of the time and the early P-40 variants' top speeds were unimpressive. Also, the single-stage, single-speed [[supercharger]] meant that the P-40 could not compete with contemporary designs as a high altitude fighter. Later versions, with {{convert|1200|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Allisons or [[Packard V-1650|Packard Merlin]] engines were more capable. Climb performance was fair to poor, depending on the subtype.&lt;ref name=&quot;P40Zero&quot;/&gt; Dive acceleration was good and dive speed was excellent.&lt;ref name=&quot;P40Zero&quot;/&gt; The highest-scoring P-40 [[Flying Ace|ace]], [[Clive Caldwell]] ([[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]]), who claimed 22 of his 28½ kills in the type, said that the P-40 had &quot;almost no vices&quot;, although &quot;it was a little difficult to control in terminal velocity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander 2006, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Caldwell added that the P-40 was &quot;faster downhill than almost any other aeroplane with a propeller.&quot; 

The P-40 tolerated harsh conditions in the widest possible variety of climates. It was a semi-[[modular]] design and thus easy to maintain in the field. It lacked innovations of the time, such as boosted [[aileron]]s or automatic [[High-lift device|leading edge slats]], but it had a strong structure including a five-[[Spar (aviation)|spar]] wing, which enabled P-40s to survive some midair collisions: both accidental impacts and intentional [[Ramming#Air warfare|ramming attacks]] against enemy aircraft were occasionally recorded as victories by the [[Desert Air Force]] and [[Soviet Air Forces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Romanenko&quot;&gt;Romanenko, Valeriy and James F. Gebhardt. [http://lend-lease.airforce.ru/english/articles/romanenko/p-40/index.htm &quot;The P-40 in Soviet Aviation&quot;] ''Lend-lease on airforce.ru''. Retrieved: 7 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Caldwell said P-40s &quot;would take a tremendous amount of punishment, violent aerobatics as well as enemy action.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander p.21&quot;/&gt; Operational range was good by early war standards, and was almost double that of the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] or [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], although it was inferior to the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]], [[Nakajima Ki-43]] and [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]].
[[Image:Kittyhawkdamaged.jpg|thumb|left|Evidence of the P-40's durability: in 1944 [[Flying Officer|F/O]] T. R. Jacklin (pictured) flew this [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF]] P-40N-5 more than {{convert|200|mi|0|abbr=on}} after the loss of the port aileron and 25% of its wing area, to a direct hit from an [[artillery shell]]. {{#tag:ref|The fighter was repaired and served out the war.|group=N}}]]

Caldwell found the P-40C Tomahawk's armament of two .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns firing through the prop and two .303 [[Browning machine gun]]s in each wing to be inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander p.21&quot;&gt;Alexander 2006, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; This was rectified with the P-40E Kittyhawk, which had three .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) guns in each wing, although Caldwell preferred the Tomahawk in other respects. It had armour around the engine and the cockpit, which enabled it to withstand considerable damage. This was one of the characteristics that allowed Allied pilots in Asia and the Pacific to attack Japanese fighters head on, rather than try to out-turn and out-climb their opponents. Late-model P-40s were regarded as well armored. Visibility was adequate, although hampered by an overly complex windscreen frame, and completely blocked to the rear in early models due to the raised turtledeck. Poor ground visibility and the relatively narrow landing gear track led to many losses due to accidents on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;P40Zero&quot;/&gt;

==Operational history==
In April 1939, the U.S. Army Air Corps, witnessing the new sleek, high speed, in-line-engined fighters of the European air forces, placed the largest single fighter order it had ever made for fighters: 524 P-40s.

===French Air Force===
An early order came from the French ''[[French Air Force|Armée de l'Air]]'', which was already operating P-36s. The ''Armée de l'Air'' ordered 140 as the '''Hawk 81A-1''' but the French military had been defeated before the aircraft had left the factory, consequently, the aircraft were diverted to British and Commonwealth service (as the Tomahawk I), in some cases complete with metric flight instruments. In late 1942, as French forces in North Africa split from the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] to side with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], U.S. forces transferred P-40Fs to the ''GC II/5'', a squadron that was historically associated with the [[Lafayette Escadrille]]. GC II/5 used its P-40Fs and Ls in combat in [[Tunisia]] and, later, for patrol duty off the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean coast]] until mid-1944 when they were replaced by [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|Republic Thunderbolt P-47Ds]].

====Deployment====
In all, 18 [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) squadrons, as well as four [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF), three [[South African Air Force]] (SAAF), and two [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) squadrons serving with RAF formations, used P-40s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafweb.org/aircraftM-T.htm &quot;Aircraft of the RAF (M - T).&quot;] ''rafweb.org,'' 2007. Retrieved: 6 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafweb.org/aircraftE-L.htm rafweb.org, 2007, &quot;Aircraft of the RAF (E - L).&quot;] ''rafweb.org,'' 2007. Retrieved: 6 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The first units to convert were [[Hawker Hurricane]] squadrons of the [[Desert Air Force]] (DAF), in early 1941. The first Tomahawks delivered came without armor, bulletproof windscreens or [[self-sealing fuel tank]]s. These were installed in subsequent shipments. The British pilots found that when landing the P-40, it was advisable to perform a &quot;wheels&quot; landing (i.e. touching down on the mains first) rather than a &quot;three-point&quot; landing used with their British aircraft. This was due to the P-40's rear-folding mainwheels, which were more prone to collapse when heavily loaded. Testing showed the aircraft did not have adequate performance for use in [[North-West Europe|Northwest Europe]] in high-altitude combat due to the effective service ceiling limitation. 

RAF Spitfires used in the theater operated at heights around {{convert|30000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, while the Allison engine, with its single-stage, low altitude rated supercharger, worked best at {{convert|15000|ft|m|abbr=on}} or lower. When the Tomahawk was used by Allied units based in the UK from August 1941, this limitation relegated the Tomahawk to low-level reconnaissance and only one squadron, [[No. 414 Squadron RCAF]] was used in the fighter role. Subsequently, the British [[Air Ministry]] deemed the P-40 completely unsuitable for the theater. P-40 squadrons from mid-1942 re-equipped with aircraft such as Mustangs.

The Tomahawk was superseded in North Africa by the more powerful Kittyhawk (&quot;D&quot;-mark onwards) types from early 1942, though some Tomahawks remained in service until 1943. Kittyhawks included many major improvements, and were the DAF's air superiority fighter for the critical first few months of 1942, until &quot;[[Tropics|tropicalised]]&quot; [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]s were available.

DAF units received nearly 330 [[Packard V-1650|Packard V-1650 Merlin]]-powered P-40Fs, called Kittyhawk IIs, most of which went to the USAAF, and the majority of the 700 &quot;lightweight&quot; L models, also powered by the Packard Merlin, in which the armament was reduced to four .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) Brownings (Kittyhawk IIA). The DAF also received some 21 of the later P-40K and the majority of the 600 P-40Ms built; these were known as Kittyhawk IIIs. The &quot;lightweight&quot; P-40Ns (Kittyhawk IV) arrived from early 1943 and were used mostly in the fighter-bomber role. {{#tag:ref| Late P-40Fs, as well as the majority of the Ks, Ls and the P-40Ms had lengthened rear fuselages; the F/Ls had no carburettor airscoop on the upper engine cowlings.&lt;ref&gt;Green and Swanborough 1977, pp. 57–59.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}}

From July 1942 until mid-1943, elements of the [[57th Wing|US 57th Fighter Group]] (57th FG) were attached to DAF P-40 units. The British government also donated 23 P-40s to the Soviet Union.

====Combat performance====
Tomahawks and Kittyhawks would bear the brunt of ''Luftwaffe'' and ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' fighter attacks during the [[North African campaign]]. The P-40s were considered superior to the Hurricane, which they replaced as the primary fighter of the Desert Air Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;P40Zero&quot;/&gt; {{Quote box| width=30%

''I had deliberately decided that any deficiency the Kittyhawk had was offset by aggression. And I'd done a little bit of boxing – I beat much better opponents simply by going for [them]. And I decided to use that in the air. And it paid off.''

According to some sources {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} the P-40 initially proved quite effective against Axis aircraft and contributed to a slight shift of momentum in the Allied favor. The gradual replacement of Hurricanes by the Tomahawks and Kittyhawks led to the ''Luftwaffe'' accelerating retirement of the Bf 109E and introducing the newer Bf 109F; these were to be flown by the veteran pilots of elite ''Luftwaffe'' units, such as [[Jagdgeschwader 27|''Jagdgeschwader'' 27]] (JG27), in North Africa.

The P-40 was generally considered roughly equal or slightly superior to the Bf 109 at low altitude, but inferior at high altitude, particularly against the Bf 109F.&lt;ref&gt;Pentland 1974, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Most air combat in North Africa took place well below {{convert|16000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, thus negating much of the Bf 109's superiority. The P-40 usually had an edge over Bf 109 in horizontal maneuverability, dive speed and structural strength, was roughly equal in firepower, but was slightly inferior in speed and outclassed in rate of climb and operational ceiling.&lt;ref name=&quot;P40Zero&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scutts 1994, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The P-40 was generally superior to early Italian fighter types, such as the [[Fiat G.50]] and the [[Macchi C.200]]. Its performance against the [[Macchi C.202|Macchi C.202 ''Folgore'']] elicited varying opinions. Some observers consider the Macchi C.202 superior.&lt;ref name= &quot;Gunston p. 226.&quot;&gt;Gunston 1984, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Clive Caldwell, who scored victories against them in his P-40, felt that the ''Folgore'' would have been superior to both the P-40 and the Bf 109 except that its armament of only two or four machine guns was inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;Ethell and Christy 1979, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Other observers considered the two equally matched, or favored the ''Folgore'' in aerobatic performance, such as turning radius. Aviation historian [[Walter J. Boyne]] wrote that over Africa, the P-40 and the ''Folgore'' were &quot;equivalent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Boyne 2002, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snedden 1997, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glancey 2006, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Against its lack of high altitude performance the P-40 was considered to be a stable gun platform, and its rugged construction meant that it was able to operate from rough front line airstrips with a good rate of serviceability.&lt;ref&gt;Pentland 1974, pp. 8, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest victory claims by P-40 pilots include [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] aircraft, during the 1941 [[Syria-Lebanon campaign]], against [[Dewoitine D.520]]s, a type often considered to be the best French fighter used during World War II.&lt;ref name = &quot;nijbrw&quot;/&gt; The P-40 was deadly against Axis bombers in the theater, as well as against the [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110]] twin-engine fighter.

In June 1941, Caldwell, who was serving at the time with [[No. 250 Squadron RAF]] in [[Egypt]], and flying as [[flying Officer|F/O]] Jack Hamlyn's wingman, recorded in his log book that he was involved in the first air combat victory for the P-40. This was a [[CANT Z.1007]] bomber on 6 June.&lt;ref name = &quot;nijbrw&quot;/&gt; The claim was not officially recognized, as the crash of the CANT was not witnessed. The first official victory occurred on 8 June, when Hamlyn and [[Flight Sergeant|Flt Sgt]] Tom Paxton destroyed a CANT Z.1007 from ''211&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; Squadriglia'' of the ''Regia Aeronautica'', over [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name = &quot;lmnsbs&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:P03372.011 kittybomber.jpg|thumb|left|North Africa, c. 1943. A P-40 &quot;Kittybomber&quot; of [[No. 450 Squadron RAAF]], loaded with six {{convert|250|lb|abbr=on}} bombs (Photographer: William Hadfield)]]

Several days later, the Tomahawk was in action over Syria with [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF]], which claimed 19 aerial victories over Vichy French aircraft during June and July 1941, for the loss of one P-40 (as well as one lost to ground fire).&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1983, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some DAF units initially failed to use P-40s according to its strengths and/or utilised outdated defensive tactics, such as the [[Lufbery circle]]. However, the superior climb rate of the Bf 109 enabled fast, swooping attacks, neutralizing the advantages offered by conventional defensive tactics. Various new formations were tried by Tomahawk units in 1941-42, including: &quot;fluid pairs&quot; (similar to the German ''rotte''); one or two &quot;weavers&quot; at the back of a squadron in formation, and whole squadrons bobbing and weaving in loose formations.&lt;ref name= &quot;Brown P. 26-29&quot;&gt;Brown 1983, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Werner Schröer]], who would be credited with destroying 114 Allied aircraft in only 197 combat missions, referred to the latter formation as &quot;bunches of grapes&quot;, because he found them so easy to pick off.&lt;ref name= &quot;Brown P. 26-29&quot;/&gt; The leading German ''expert'' in North Africa, [[Hans-Joachim Marseille]], [[Confirmation and overclaiming of aerial victories|claimed]] as many as 101 P-40s during his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwii_ace_stories_marseille&quot;&gt;,Ratuszynski, Wilhelm. [http://www.elknet.pl/acestory/aces.htm &quot;Hans-Joachim Marseille: Desert Eagle.&quot;] ''World War II Ace Stories''. Retrieved: 8 March 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 26 May 1942, all Kittyhawk units operated primarily as fighter-bomber units,&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1983, pp. 257–258.&lt;/ref&gt; giving rise to the nickname &quot;Kittybomber&quot;. As a result of this change in role, and because DAF P-40 squadrons were frequently used in bomber escort and close air support missions, they suffered relatively high attrition rates; many Desert Air Force P-40 pilots were caught flying low and slow by marauding Bf 109s.

Caldwell believed that [[Operational Conversion Unit|Operational Training Unit]]s did not properly prepare pilots for air combat in the P-40, and as a commander, stressed the importance of training novice pilots properly.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander 2006, pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, competent pilots who used the P-40's strengths were effective against the best of the ''Luftwaffe'' and ''Regia Aeronautica''.&lt;ref name=&quot;P40Zero&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;P40RAF&quot;/&gt; At least 46 British Commonwealth pilots achieved ace status flying the P-40. For example, on one occasion in August 1941, Caldwell was attacked by two Bf 109s, one of them piloted by German Ace [[Werner Schröer]]. Although Caldwell was wounded three times, and his Tomahawk was hit by more than 100 {{convert|7.92|mm|in|abbr=on}} bullets and five [[MG 151 cannon|20 mm cannon]] shells, during this combat Caldwell shot down Schröer's wingman and returned to base. Some sources also claim that in December 1941, Caldwell killed a prominent German ''Experte'', [[Erbo Graf von Kageneck|Erbo von Kageneck]] (69 kills) while flying a P-40. {{#tag:ref|Kageneck's brother, August Graf von Kageneck, who corresponded with Caldwell after the war, was among those who believed that Caldwell shot down Erbo.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander 2006, pp. 224–228.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} Caldwell's victories in North Africa included 10 Bf 109s and two [[Macchi C.202]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwii_ace_stories_caldwell&quot;&gt;Dragicevic, George.

===Chinese Air Force Flying Tigers (American Volunteer Group)===

The [[Flying Tigers]], known officially as the 1st American Volunteer Group, were a unit of the [[Chinese Air Force]], recruited from U.S. aviators. From late 1941, the P-40B was used by the Flying Tigers. They were divided into three pursuit squadrons, the &quot;Adam &amp; Eves&quot;, the &quot;Panda Bears&quot; and the &quot;Hell's Angels&quot;. 

Compared to opposing Japanese fighters, the P-40B's strengths were that it was sturdy, well armed, faster in a dive and possessed an excellent rate of roll. While the P-40s could not match the maneuverability of the Japanese Army air arm's [[Nakajima Ki-27]]s and [[Nakajima Ki-43|Ki-43s]], nor the much more famous [[Mitsubishi A6M|Zero naval fighter]] in a slow speed turning dogfight, at higher speeds the P-40s were more than a match. AVG leader [[Claire Chennault]] trained his pilots to use the P-40's particular performance advantages. The P-40 had a higher dive speed than any Japanese fighter aircraft of the early war years, for example, and could be used to exploit so-called &quot;boom-and-zoom&quot; tactics. The AVG was highly successful, and its feats were widely-published, to boost sagging public morale at home, by an active cadre of international journalists. According to their official records, in just 6 1/2 months, the Flying Tigers destroyed 297 enemy aircraft for the loss of just four of their own (in air-to-air combat).

===United States Army Air Forces===
[[Image:Aleutian P-40E.jpg|thumb|right|P-40K 42-10256 in Aleutian &quot;Tiger&quot; markings.]]
A total of 15 entire USAAF pursuit/fighter [[group (air force unit)|group]]s (FG), along with other pursuit/fighter [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s and a few [[tactical reconnaissance]] (TR) units, operated the P-40 during 1941–45.&lt;ref name=&quot;P40CBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;P40MTO2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;P40PTO&quot;/&gt;

As was also the case with the [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]], many USAAF officers considered the P-40 inadequate, and it was gradually replaced by the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]], the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] and the [[North American P-51 Mustang]]. However, the bulk of the fighter operations by the USAAF in 1942–43 were borne by the P-40 and the P-39. In the Pacific, these two fighters, along with the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy's]] [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]], contributed more than any other U.S. types to breaking Japanese air power during this critical period.

====Pacific theaters====
[[Image:P-40-flightline-201024.jpg|thumb|right| By mid-1943, the USAAF was phasing out the P-40F (pictured); the two nearest aircraft, &quot;White 116&quot; and &quot;White 111&quot; were flown by the aces 1Lt Henry E. Matson and 1Lt Jack Bade, 44th FS, at the time part of [[AirSols]], on [[Guadalcanal]].]]

The P-40 was the main USAAF fighter aircraft in the [[South West Pacific theater of World War II|South West Pacific]] and [[Pacific Ocean Area|Pacific Ocean theater]]s during 1941–42.

In the first major battles, at [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] and in [[battle of the Philippines (1941–42)|the Philippines]], USAAF P-40 squadrons suffered crippling losses on the ground and in the air to Japanese fighters such as the [[Nakajima Ki-43|Ki-43 Oscar]] and [[A6M Zero]].

However, in the [[Netherlands East Indies campaign|Dutch East Indies campaign]], the [[17th Fighter Squadron|17th Pursuit Squadron]] (Provisional), formed from USAAF pilots evacuated from the Philippines, claimed 49 Japanese aircraft destroyed, for the loss of 17 P-40s.&lt;ref name=&quot;P40PTO&quot;&gt;Molesworth 2003&lt;/ref&gt; And in the [[Solomon Islands campaign|Solomon Islands]] and [[New Guinea Campaign]]s, as well as the [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|air defense of Australia]], improved tactics and training allowed the USAAF to more effectively utilize the strengths of the P-40.

Due to aircraft fatigue, scarcity of spare parts and replacement problems, the US [[Fifth Air Force]] and [[Royal Australian Air Force]] created a joint P-40 management and replacement pool on 30 July 1942 and many P-40s went back and forth between both air forces.&lt;ref&gt;Birkett, Gordon. [http://www.adf-serials.com/research/Supp2-P40.pdf &quot;USAAF/RAAF P40E/E-1 Operations in Australia Supplementary #2&quot;.] ''adf-serials.com'', 2005. Retrieved: 1 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[49th Fighter Group]] was in action in the Pacific from the beginning of the war. [[Robert DeHaven]] scored 10 kills (from 14 kills overall) in the P-40 with the 49th FG. He compared the P-40 favorably with the P-38:
:&quot;If you flew wisely, the P-40 was a very capable aircraft. [It] could outturn a P-38, a fact that some pilots didn't realise when they made the transition between the two aircraft. [...] The real problem with it was lack of range. As we pushed the Japanese back, P-40 pilots were slowly left out of the war. So when I moved to P-38s, an excellent aircraft, I did not [believe] that the P-40 was an inferior fighter, but because I knew the P-38 would allow us to reach the enemy. I was a fighter pilot and that was what I was supposed to do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Acepilots&quot;&gt;[http://www.acepilots.com/usaaf_pto_aces.html#DeHaven &quot;PTO/CBI Pilots of WWII&quot;.] ''Acepilots.com'', 2005. Retrieved: 7 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8th, 15th, 18th, 24th, 49th, 343rd and 347th PGs/FGs, flew P-40s in the Pacific theaters, between 1941 and 1945, with most units converting to P-38s during 1943-44. In 1945, the 71st Reconnaissance Group employed them as armed [[forward air controllers]] during ground operations in the Philippines until it received delivery of P-51s.&lt;ref name=&quot;P40PTO&quot;/&gt; They claimed 655 aerial victories.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, with sufficient altitude the P-40 could actually turn with the A6M and other Japanese fighters, using a combination of nose-down vertical turn with a bank turn, a technique known as a [[low yo-yo]]. Robert DeHaven describes how this tactic was used in the 49th Fighter group:
:[Y]ou could fight a Jap on even terms, but you had to make him fight your way. He could outturn you at slow speed. You could outturn him at high speed. When you got into a turning fight with him, you dropped your nose down so you kept your airspeed up, you could outturn him. At low speed he could outroll you because of those big ailerons ... on the Zero. If your speed was up over 275, you could outroll [a Zero]. His big ailerons didn't have the strength to make high speed rolls... You could push things, too. Because ... [i]f you decided to go home, you could go home. He couldn't because you could outrun him. [...] That left you in control of the fight.

====China-Burma-India theater====
USAAF and Chinese P-40 pilots performed well in this theater, scoring high [[Confirmation and overclaiming of aerial victories|kill ratios]] against Japanese types such as the Ki-43, [[Nakajima Ki-44]] &quot;Tojo&quot; and the Zero. The P-40 remained in use in the CBI until 1944, and was reportedly preferred over the P-51 Mustang by some US pilots flying in China.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

The American Volunteer Group (Flying Tigers) was integrated into the USAAF as the [[23rd Fighter Group]] in June 1942. The unit continued to fly newer model P-40s until the end of the war, racking up a high kill-to-loss ratio.&lt;ref name=&quot;P40CBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;23FG&quot;&gt;Pike, John. [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/usaf/23fg.htm  &quot;23rd Fighter Group Official Website.&quot;] ''GlobalSecurity'', 21 August 2005. Retrieved: 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Units arriving in the China-Burma-India theater after the AVG in the 10th and 14th air forces continued to perform well with the P-40, [[Confirmation and overclaiming of aerial victories|claiming]] 973 kills in the theater, or 64.8 percent of all enemy aircraft shot down. Aviation historian Carl Molesworth stated that &quot;...the P-40 simply dominated the skies over Burma and China. They were able to establish air superiority over free China, northern Burma and the Assam valley of India in 1942, and they never relinquished it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;P40CBI&quot;/&gt;

In addition to the 23rd FG, the 3rd, 5th, 51st and 80th FGs, along with the 10th TRS, operated the P-40 in the CBI {{#tag:ref|Although part of the US 14th AF, the P-40s of 3rd and 5th FGs of the Chinese American Composite Wing were flown by both American and Chinese pilots.&lt;ref name=&quot;P40CBI&quot;/&gt;|group=N}} In addition to its role as a fighter aircraft, CBI P-40 pilots used the aircraft very effectively as a fighter-bomber. The [[80th Flying Training Wing|80th Fighter Group]] in particular used its so-called ''B-40'' (P-40s carrying 1,000-pound high explosive bombs) to destroy Japanese-held bridges and kill bridge repair crews, sometimes demolishing their target with a single bomb.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Playing Large Part In Burma Fighting Against Japs&quot;. ''CBI Roundup'', Vol. II, No. 32, 20 April 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; At least 40 U.S. pilots reached ace status while flying the P-40 in the CBI.

====Europe and Mediterranean theaters====
[[Image:Curtiss P-40 Warhawk USAF.JPG|thumb|Top to Bottom: P-40 F/L, P-40K Warhawk]]
On 14 August 1942, the first confirmed victory by a USAAF unit over a German aircraft in World War II was achieved by a P-40C pilot. 2nd Lt Joseph D. Shaffer, of the 33rd Fighter Squadron, intercepted a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]]C-3 that overflew his base at [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]]. Shaffer damaged the Fw 200, which was finished off by a P-38F.

Warhawks were used extensively in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] (MTO) by USAAF units, including the [[33rd Fighter Group|33rd]], [[57th Wing|57th]], [[58th Fighter Group|58th]], [[79th Fighter Group|79th]], [[324th Fighter Group|324th]] and [[325th Fighter Group]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;P40MTO2&quot;&gt;Molesworth 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

While the P-40 suffered heavy loses in the MTO, many USAAF P-40 units achieved high kill-to-loss ratios against Axis aircraft. For example, the 324th FG scored better than a 2:1 ratio in the MTO.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flying&quot;&gt;Higham 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In all, 23 U.S. pilots became aces in the MTO while flying the P-40, most of them during the first half of 1943.&lt;ref name = &quot;P40MTO2&quot;/&gt; As in the Pacific, success in combat depended in part on experience and effective tactics.

Individual pilots from the 57th FG were the first USAAF P-40 pilots to see action in the MTO, while attached to Desert Air Force Kittyhawk squadrons, from July 1942. The 57th was also the main unit involved in the &quot;Palm Sunday Massacre&quot;, on 18 April 1943. De-coded [[Ultra (World War II intelligence)|Ultra]] signals had given away a plan for a large formation of German [[Junkers Ju 52]] transports to cross the Mediterranean, escorted by German and Italian fighters. Between 1630 and 1830 hours, all wings of the Group were engaged in an intensive effort against the enemy air transports. Of the four Kittyhawk Wings, three had left the patrol area before a convoy of a 100 plus enemy transports were sighted by 57 Group, who tallied 74 aircraft destroyed. 57 Group was last in the area, and intercepted the Ju 52s escorted by large numbers of [[Bf 109]]s, [[Bf 110]]s and [[Macchi C.202]]s. In all, they claimed 58 Ju 52s, 14 Bf 109s and two Bf 110s destroyed with a number of others probably destroyed and damaged. Between 20–40 of the E/A were seen to land on the beaches around [[Cap Bon]] in order to avoid being shot down. Six Allied fighters were lost, five of them P-40s. 

On 22 April, in [[Operation Flax]], a similar force of P-40s attacked a formation of 14 [[Messerschmitt Me 323]] ''Gigant'' (&quot;Giant&quot;) six-engine transports, covered by seven Bf 109s from II./JG 27. All the transports were shot down, for a loss of three P-40s destroyed. The 57th FG was equipped with the Curtiss fighter until early 1944, during which time they were credited with at least 140 air-to-air kills.&lt;ref name= &quot;Weal p. 91&quot;&gt;Weal 2003, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1943, 75 P-40Ls were transported on the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Ranger|CV-4|6}}. On 23 February, during [[Operation Torch]], the pilots of the 58th FG flew these P-40s off ''Ranger'' to land at newly-captured Vichy French airfield, Cazas, near [[Casablanca]], in [[French Morocco]]. The aircraft resupplied the 33rd FG and the pilots were reassigned.&lt;ref&gt;USAAF General Orders; USAAF History of the 58th FG. [Sic. These need checking.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 325th FG (known as the &quot;Checkertail Clan&quot;) flew P-40s in the MTO. The 325th was credited with at least 133 air-to-air kills in April–October 1943, of which 95 were Bf 109s and 26 were Macchi C.202s, for the loss of 17 P-40s in combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;P40MTO2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;325MTO2&quot;&gt;Cathcart, Carol.

Retrieved: 25 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; An anecdote concerning the 325th FG, indicates what could happen if Bf 109 pilots made the mistake of trying to out-turn the P-40. 325th FG historian Carol Cathcart wrote: &quot;on 30 July, 20 P-40s of the 317th [Fighter Squadron] ... took off on a fighter sweep ... over [[Sardinia]]. As they turned to fly south over the west part of the island, they were attacked near [[Sassari]]... The attacking force consisted of 25 to 30 Bf 109s and Macchi C.202s... In the brief, intense battle that occurred ... [the 317th claimed] 21 enemy aircraft.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;325MTO317&quot;&gt;Cathcart, Carol.

Retrieved: 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Cathcart states that Lt. Robert Sederberg who assisted a comrade being attacked by five Bf 109s, destroyed at least one German aircraft, and may have shot down as many as five. Sederberg was shot down in the dogfight and became a prisoner of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;325MTO317&quot;/&gt;

A famous [[African American]] unit, the [[Tuskegee Airmen|99th FS]], better known as the &quot;Tuskegee Airmen&quot; or &quot;Redtails&quot;, flew P-40s in stateside training and for their initial eight months in the MTO. On 9 June 1943, they became the first African American fighter pilots to engage enemy aircraft, over [[Pantelleria]], Italy. A single [[Focke Wulf Fw 190]] was reported damaged by Lieutenant Willie Ashley Jr. On 2 July the squadron claimed its first verified kill; a Fw 190 destroyed by Captain Charles Hall. The 99th would continue to score with P-40s until February 1944, when they were assigned P-39s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1356 &quot;Tuskegee Airmen.&quot;] ''National Museum of the USAF''.

Retrieved: 19 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The much-lightened P-40L was most heavily used in the MTO, primarily by U.S. pilots. Many US pilots stripped down their P-40s even further to improve performance, often removing two or more of the wing guns from the P-40F/L.

===Royal Australian Air Force===
[[Image:AWM 026647 P-40 Milne.jpg|thumb|right|A P-40E-1 piloted by the ace [[Keith Truscott|Keith &quot;Bluey&quot; Truscott]], commander of [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF]], taxis along [[Marsden Matting]] at [[Milne Bay]], [[New Guinea]] in September 1942.]]
The Kittyhawk was the main fighter used by the RAAF in World War II, in greater numbers than the Spitfire. Two RAAF squadrons serving with the Desert Air Force, [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No. 3]] and [[No. 450 Squadron RAAF|No. 450 Squadron]]s, were the first Australian units to be assigned P-40s. Other RAAF pilots served with RAF or SAAF P-40 squadrons in the theater.

Many RAAF pilots achieved high scores in the P-40. At least five reached &quot;double ace&quot; status: Clive Caldwell, [[Nicky Barr]], [[John Lloyd Waddy|John Waddy]], [[Bob Whittle]] (11 kills each) and [[Bobby Gibbes]] (10 kills) in the Middle East, North African and/or [[New Guinea campaign]]s. In all, 18 RAAF pilots became aces while flying P-40s.&lt;ref name=&quot;P40RAF&quot;/&gt;

Nicky Barr, like many Australian pilots, considered the P-40 a reliable mount: &quot;The Kittyhawk became, to me, a friend. It was quite capable of getting you out of trouble more often than not. It was a real warhorse.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicky Barr quiet Soldier&quot;&gt;Barr, Nicky. [http://www.abc.net.au/austory/transcripts/s513633.htm  &quot;Interview Transcript.&quot;] ''ABC Australia''. Retrieved: 8 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as the heaviest fighting in North Africa, the [[Pacific War]] was also in its early stages, and RAAF units in Australia were completely lacking in suitable fighter aircraft. Spitfire production was being absorbed by the war in Europe; P-38s were trialled, but were difficult to obtain; Mustangs had not yet reached squadrons anywhere, and Australia's tiny and inexperienced aircraft industry was geared towards larger aircraft. USAAF P-40s and their pilots originally intended for the [[United States Far East Air Force|U.S. Far East Air Force]] in the Philippines, but diverted to Australia as a result of Japanese naval activity were the first suitable fighter aircraft to arrive in substantial numbers. By mid-1942, the RAAF was able to obtain some USAAF replacement shipments; the P-40 was given the RAAF designation A-29.
[[Image:P02808.001 P-40 Black Magic.jpg|thumb|P-40N-15 &quot;Black Magic&quot;, &lt;br /&gt;[[No. 78 Squadron RAAF]] &lt;br /&gt;[[Flight Lieutenant|F/L]] Denis Baker scored the RAAF's last aerial victory [[New Guinea campaign|over New Guinea]] in this fighter on 10 June 1944. It was later flown by [[Warrant Officer|W/O]] [[Len Waters]]. Note the dark blue tip on the [[Vertical stabilizer|tailfin]] used to identify [[No. 78 Squadron RAAF|78 Squadron]].]]

RAAF Kittyhawks played a crucial role in the [[South West Pacific theater of World War II|South West Pacific theater]]. They fought on the front line as fighters during the critical early years of the Pacific War, and the durability and bomb-carrying abilities (1,000&amp;nbsp;lb/454&amp;nbsp;kg) of the P-40 also made it ideal for the ground attack role. For example, [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|75]], and [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|76]] Squadrons played a critical role during the [[Battle of Milne Bay]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2australia.gov.au/asfaras/milnebay.html &quot;Australia's War 1939-1945&quot;.] ''Official Australian Government, Department of Veterans Affairs''. Retrieved: 8 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pentland 1974, pp. 27–39.&lt;/ref&gt; fending off Japanese aircraft and providing effective close air support for the Australian infantry, negating the initial Japanese advantage in light tanks and sea power.

The RAAF units which made the most use of Kittyhawks in the South West Pacific were: 75, 76, [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77]], [[No. 78 Squadron RAAF|78]], [[No. 80 Squadron RAAF|80]], [[No. 82 Squadron RAAF|82]], [[No. 84 Squadron RAAF|84]] and [[No. 86 Squadron RAAF|86]] Squadrons. These squadrons saw action mostly in the New Guinea and [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo campaigns]].

Late in 1945, RAAF fighter squadrons in the South West Pacific began converting to P-51Ds. However, Kittyhawks were in use with the RAAF until the end of the war, in Borneo. In all, the RAAF acquired 841 Kittyhawks (not counting the British-ordered examples used in North Africa), including 163 P-40E, 42 P-40K, 90 P-40 M and 553 P-40N models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defence.gov.au/RAAF/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A29.htm RAAF Museum, 2007, &quot;A29 Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk.&quot;] ''defence.gov.au''. Retrieved: 1 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the RAAF ordered 67 Kittyhawks for use by [[No. 120 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron]] (a joint Australian-[[Netherlands|Dutch]] unit in the South West Pacific). The P-40 was retired by the RAAF in 1947.

===Royal Canadian Air Force===
A total of 13 [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] units operated the P-40 in the North West European or Alaskan theaters. 

In mid-May 1940, Canadian and US officers watched comparative tests of a XP-40 and a Spitfire, at [[Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport|RCAF Uplands]], Ottawa. While the Spitfire was considered to have performed better, it was not available for use in Canada and the P-40 was ordered to meet home air defense requirements. In all, eight Home War Establishment Squadrons were equipped with the Kittyhawk: 72 Kittyhawk I, 12 Kittyhawk Ia, 15 Kittyhawk III and 35 Kittyhawk IV aircraft, for a total of 134 aircraft. These aircraft were mostly diverted from RAF Lend-Lease orders for service in Canada. The P-40 Kittyhawks were obtained in lieu of 144 P-39 Airacobras originally allocated to Canada but reassigned to the RAF.

However, before any home units received the P-40, three RCAF [[Article XV squadron]]s operated Tomahawk aircraft from bases in the United Kingdom. No. 403 Squadron RCAF, a fighter unit, used the Tomahawk Mk II briefly before converting to Spitfires. Two [[Close air support|Army Co-operation]] (close air support) squadrons: 400 and 414 Sqns trained with Tomahawks, before converting to Mustang Mk. I aircraft and a fighter/reconnaissance role. Of these, only No. 400 Squadron used Tomahawks operationally, conducting a number of armed sweeps over France in the late 1941. RCAF pilots also flew Tomahawks or Kittyhawks with other British Commonwealth units based in North Africa, the Mediterranean, South East Asia and (in at least one case) the South West Pacific.{{#tag:ref|After being evacuated from Singapore to Australia in 1942, F/L Thomas W. Watson RCAF served for a period with with No. 77 Squadron RAAF.|group=N}}

In 1942, the Imperial Japanese Navy [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|occupied two islands]], [[Attu]] and [[Kiska]], in the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutians]], off [[Alaska]]. RCAF home defense P-40 squadrons saw combat over the Aleutians, assisting the USAAF. The RCAF initially sent 111 Squadron, flying the Kittyhawk I, to the US base on [[Adak Airport|Adak]] island. During the drawn-out campaign, 12 Canadian Kittyhawks operated on a rotational basis from a new, more advanced base on [[Amchitka]],{{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Kiska]]. 14 and 111 Sqns took &quot;turn-about&quot; at the base. During a major attack on Japanese positions at Kiska on 25 September 1942, Squadron Leader [[Ken Boomer]] shot down a [[Nakajima A6M2-N]] (&quot;Rufe&quot;) seaplane. The RCAF also purchased 12 P-40Ks directly from the USAAF while in the Aleutians. After the Japanese threat diminished, these two RCAF squadrons returned to Canada and eventually transferred to England without their Kittyhawks. 

In January 1943, a further Article XV unit, 430 Squadron was formed at [[RAF Hartford Bridge]], England and trained on obsolete Tomahawk IIA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/1w-1e/sqns-escs/page-eng.asp?id=394 Canadian Forces, &quot;430 Squadron &amp;ndash; History.&quot;] ''airforce.forces.gc''.

Retrieved: 3 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron converted to the Mustang I before commencing operations in mid-1943.

In early 1945 pilots from No. 133 Squadron RCAF, operating the P-40N out of [[Victoria International Airport|RCAF Patricia Bay]], (Victoria, BC), intercepted and destroyed two Japanese [[fire balloon|balloon-bomb]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks of the RCAF&quot;/&gt; which were designed to cause wildfires on the North American mainland. On 21 February, Pilot Officer E. E. Maxwell shot down a balloon, which landed on [[Sumas Mountain]] in Washington State. On 10 March, Pilot Officer J. 0. Patten destroyed a balloon near [[Saltspring Island]], BC. The last interception took place on 20 April 1945 when Pilot Officer P.V. Brodeur from 135 Squadron out of [[Abbotsford, British Columbia]] shot down a balloon over Vedder Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;Coyle 2002, pp. 214–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCAF units that operated P-40s were, in order of conversion: [[No. 403 Squadron RCAF|403 Squadron]] (March 1941), [[No. 400 Squadron RCAF|400 Squadron]] (April 1941&amp;ndash;September 1942), [[No. 414 Squadron RCAF|414 Squadron]] (August 1941&amp;ndash;September 1942), [[No. 111 Squadron RCAF|111 Squadron]] (Kittyhawk I, IV, November 1941&amp;ndash;December 1943 and P-40K, September 1942&amp;ndash;July 1943), [[No. 118 Squadron RCAF|118 Squadron]] (Kittyhawk I, November 1941&amp;ndash;October 1943), [[No. 14 Squadron RCAF|14 Squadron]] (January 1942&amp;ndash;September 1943), [[No. 132 Squadron RCAF|132 Squadron]] (Kittyhawk IA &amp; III, April 1942&amp;ndash;September 1944), [[No. 130 Squadron RCAF|130 Squadron]] (Kittyhawk I, May 1942&amp;ndash;October 1942), [[No. 430 Squadron RCAF|430 Squadron]] (January 1943&amp;ndash;February 1943), [[No. 163 Squadron RCAF|163 Squadron]] (Kittyhawk I &amp; III, October 1943&amp;ndash;March 1944), [[No. 133 Squadron RCAF|133 Squadron]] (Kittyhawk I, March 1944&amp;ndash;July 1945) and [[No. 135 Squadron RCAF|135 Squadron]] (Kittyhawk IV, May 1944&amp;ndash;September 1945).

The &quot;Wildcat&quot; emblem was applied by a US unit which previously used the aircraft. Fisken kept it, while adding &quot;[[Wairarapa]]&quot;, after his home region.]]
Some [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] (RNZAF) pilots and [[New Zealand]]ers in other air forces flew British P-40s while serving with DAF squadrons in North Africa and Italy, including the ace [[Jerry Westenra]].

A total of 301 P-40s were allocated to the RNZAF under [[Lend-Lease]], for use in the Pacific Theater, although four of these were lost in transit. The aircraft equipped [[14 Squadron RNZAF|14 Squadron]], [[No. 15 Squadron RNZAF|15 Squadron]], [[No. 16 Squadron RNZAF|16 Squadron]], [[No. 17 Squadron RNZAF|17 Squadron]], [[No. 18 Squadron RNZAF|18 Squadron]], [[No. 19 Squadron RNZAF|19 Squadron]] and [[No. 20 Squadron RNZAF|20 Squadron]].

RNZAF P-40 squadrons were successful in air combat against the Japanese between 1942 and 1944. Their pilots claimed 100 aerial victories in P-40s, whilst losing 20 aircraft in combat{{#tag:ref|In total, the RNZAF claimed 106 victories in the Pacific: three by [[No. 488 Squadron RNZAF|488(NZ) Sqn]] in [[Singapore]] and [[British Malaya|Malaya]] (all confirmed), three by [[Lockheed Hudson]]s (one confirmed) and the remaining 102 by P-40 pilots.

The overwhelming majority of RNZAF P-40 victories were scored against Japanese fighters, mostly Zeroes. Other victories included [[Aichi D3A]] &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers. The only confirmed twin engine claim, a [[Mitsubishi Ki-21|Ki-21]] &quot;Sally&quot; (misidentified as a [[Mitsubishi G4M|G4M]] &quot;Betty&quot;) fell to Fisken in July 1943.&lt;ref name= &quot;Chris Rudge 2003&quot;/&gt;

From late 1943 and 1944, RNZAF P-40s were increasingly used against ground targets, including the innovative use of naval depth charges as improvised high-capacity bombs. The last front line RNZAF P-40s were replaced by [[Vought F4U Corsair]]s in 1944. The P-40s were relegated to use as advanced pilot trainers.&lt;ref&gt;Horn 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mossong, Peter.

The remaining RNZAF P-40s, excluding the 20 shot down and 154 written off, were mostly scrapped at [[Hamilton International Airport|Rukuhia]] in 1948.

===Soviet Union===
The Soviet [[Soviet Air Forces|''Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily'']] (VVS; &quot;Military Air Forces&quot;) and [[Soviet Naval Aviation|''Morskaya Aviatsiya'']] (MA; &quot;Naval Air Service&quot;) also referred to P-40s as Tomahawks and Kittyhawks. In fact, the Curtiss P-40 Tomahawk/Kittyhawk was the first Allied fighter supplied to the USSR under the Lend-Lease agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon p. 435&quot;&gt;Gordon 2008, p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt;
Their units used 2,097 &lt;ref&gt;Hardesty 1991, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; 146 Tomahawks were shipped from Great Britain and 49 more arrived from the US, many of them coming incomplete, lacking machine guns and even the lower half of the engine cowling. In late September 1941, the first 48 P-40s were assembled and checked in USSR.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon pp. 436-437&quot;&gt;Gordon 2008, pp 436-437.&lt;/ref&gt; Test flights showed some manufacturing defects: generator and oil pump gears and generator shafts failed repeatedly, which led to emergency landings. The test report indicated that the Tomahawk was inferior to Soviet “M-105P-powered production fighters in speed and rate of climb. However, it has good short field performance, horizontal manoeuvrability, range and endurance”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon p. 437&quot;&gt;Gordon 2008, p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, Tomahawks and Kittyhawks were used against the Germans. The 126th IAP fighting on the Western and Kalinin fronts were the first unit to receive the P-40. The regiment entered action on 12 October 1941. By 15 November 1941, that unit had shot down 17 German aircraft. However, Lt (SG) Smirnov noted that the P-40 armament was sufficient for strafing enemy lines but rather ineffective in aerial combat. Another pilot, S.G. Ridnyy (Hero of Soviet Union), remarked that he had to shoot half the ammunition at 50–100 meters (164–339&amp;nbsp;ft) to shoot down an enemy aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon p. 437&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:P-40 B Tomahawk NMNA.jpg|thumb|left|Hawk 81A-3/Tomahawk IIb ''AK255'', at the US [[National Museum of Naval Aviation]], is shown in the colors of the Flying Tigers, but never actually served with them; it began life with the RAF and was later transferred to the Soviet Union.]]
In January 1942, some 198 aircraft sorties were flown (334 flying hours) and 11 aerial engagements were conducted, in which five Bf 109s, one Ju 88, and one He 111 were downed. These statistics reveal a surprising fact: it turns out that the Tomahawk was fully capable of successful air combat with a Bf 109. The reports of pilots about the circumstances of the engagements confirm this fact. On 18 January 1942, Lieutenants S. V. Levin and I. P. Levsha (in pair) fought an engagement with seven Bf 109s and shot down two of them without loss. On 22 January, a flight of three aircraft led by Lieutenant E. E. Lozov engaged 13 enemy aircraft and shot down two Bf 109Es, again without loss. Altogether, in January, two Tomahawks were lost; one downed by German antiaircraft artillery and one lost to Messerschmitts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romanenko&quot;/&gt;

The Soviets stripped down their P-40s significantly for combat, in many cases removing the wing guns altogether in P-40B/C types, for example. Soviet Air Force reports state that they liked the range and fuel capacity of the P-40 which were superior to most of the Soviet fighters, though they still preferred the P-39. Soviet pilot Nikolai G. Golodnikov recalled: &quot;The cockpit was vast and high. At first it felt unpleasant to sit waist-high in glass, as the edge of the fuselage was almost at waist level. But the bullet-proof glass and armoured seat were strong and visibility was good. The radio was also good. It was powerful, reliable, but only on HF (high frequency). The American radios did not have hand microphones but throat microphones. These were good throat mikes: small, light and comfortable.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;Drabkin p. 129&quot;&gt;Drabkin 2007, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest complaint of some Soviet airmen was its poor climb rate and problems with maintenance, especially with burning out the engines. &lt;!-- statement already made; is there need to repeat it?---Tomahawks' Allison engine was regarded as &quot;not very good but powerful as such&quot;. When pushed to full RPMs, towards maximum output, it would begin to &quot;make metal dust&quot;. &lt;ref name= &quot;Drabkin p. 130&quot;&gt;Drabkin 2007, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;----&gt; VVS pilots usually flew the P-40 at War Emergency Power settings while in combat, this would bring the acceleration and speed performance closer to that of their German rivals, but could burn out engines in a matter of weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romanenko&quot;/&gt; They also had difficulty with the more demanding requirements for fuel quality and oil purity of the Allison engines. A fair number of burnt out P-40s were re-engined with Soviet Klimov engines but these performed relatively poorly and were relegated to rear area use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romanenko&quot;/&gt;

|quote=''Actually, the P-40 could engage all Messerschmitts on equal terms, almost to the end of 1943. If you take into consideration all the characteristics of the P-40, then the Tomahawk was equal to the Bf 109F and the Kittyhawk was slightly better. Its speed and vertical and horizontal manoeuvre were good and fully competitive with enemy aircraft. Acceleration rate was a bit low, but when you got used to the engine, it was OK.

The P-40 saw the most front line use in Soviet hands in 1942 and early 1943. It was used in the northern sectors and played a significant role in the [[Siege of Leningrad|defense of Leningrad]]. The most numerically important types were P-40B/C, P-40E and P-40K/M. By the time the better P-40F and N types became available, production of superior Soviet fighters had increased sufficiently so that the P-40 was replaced in most Soviet Air Force units by the [[Lavochkin La-5]] and various later Yakovlev types. In spring 1943, Lt D.I. Koval of the 45th IAP gained ace status on the North-Caucasian front, shooting down six German aircraft flying a P-40. Some Soviet P-40 squadrons had good combat records. They provided close air support as well as air-to-air capability while Soviet pilots became aces on the P-40, not as many as on the P-39 Airacobra, which was the most numerous Lend Lease fighter used by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romanenko&quot;/&gt; However Soviet commanders considered the Kittyhawk to significantly outclass the Hurricane, although it was “not in the same league as the Yak-1”.&lt;ref name= &quot;Drabkin p. 130.&quot;&gt;Drabkin 2007, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon p. 437-438&quot;&gt;Gordon 2008, pp. 437–438.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
The [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] captured some P-40s and later operated a number in [[Burma]]. The Japanese appear to have had as many as 10 flyable P-40Es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.j-aircraft.com/captured/capturedby/p40warhawk/captured_p40.htm &quot;Japanese Captured P-40.&quot;] ''J-Aircraft.com''. Retrieved: 19 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief period in 1943, a few of them were actually used operationally by 2 ''Hiko Chutai'', 50 ''Hiko Sentai'' (2nd Air Squadron, 50th Air Regiment) in the defense of [[Rangoon]]. Testimony of this is given by [[Yasuhiko Kuroe]], a member of the 64 ''Hiko Sentai''. In his memoirs, he says one Japanese-operated P-40 was shot down in error by a friendly [[Mitsubishi Ki-21]] &quot;Sally&quot; over Rangoon.

===Other nations===
The P-40 was used by over two dozen countries during and after the war. The P-40 was used by [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Egypt]], [[Finland]] and [[Turkey]]. The last P-40s in military service, used by the [[Brazilian Air Force]] (FAB), were retired in 1958.

In the air war over Finland, several Soviet P-40s were shot down or had to crash-land due to other reasons. The Finns, short of good aircraft, collected these and managed to repair one P-40M, P-40M-10-CU 43-5925, &quot;white 23&quot;, which received [[Finnish Air Force]] serial number KH-51 (KH denoting &quot;Kittyhawk&quot;, as the British designation of this type was Kittyhawk III). This aircraft was attached to an operational squadron HLeLv 32 of the [[Finnish Air Force]], but lack of spares kept it on the ground, with the exception of a few evaluation flights.

==Variants and development stages==
[[Image:00910460 060.jpg|thumb|A USAAF Curtiss P-40K-10-CU, serial number 42-9985, c. 1943]]
{{See also|Curtiss P-40 variants}}
;XP-40
:The original Curtis XP-40, ordered July 1937, was converted from the 10th P-36A by replacing the radial engine with a new Allison V-1710-19 engine.  It flew for the first time in October 1938.
This new liquid-cooled engine fighter had a casling radiator mounted under the rear fuselage
but the prototype XP-40 was later modified and the radiator was moved forward under the engine.
;P-40
:The P-40 (Curtiss Model 81A-1) was the first production variant, 199 built.
;P-40A
:One P-40 was modified with a camera installation in the rear fuselage and re-designated P-40A.
*Revised versions of the P-40 soon followed: the '''P-40B''' or '''Tomahawk IIA''' had extra .30in&amp;nbsp;in (7.62&amp;nbsp;mm) U.S., or [[.303 British|.303 in]] (7.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns in the wings and a partially protected fuel system; the '''P-40C''' or '''Tomahawk IIB''' added underbelly drop tank and bomb shackles, self-sealing fuel tanks and other minor revisions, but the extra weight did have a negative impact on aircraft performance. (All versions of the P-40 had a relatively low power-to-weight ratio compared to contemporary fighters.)
*Only a small number of '''P-40D''' or '''Kittyhawk Mk I'''s were made, less than 50. With a new, larger Allison engine, slightly narrower fuselage, redesigned canopy, and improved cockpit, the P-40D eliminated the nose-mounted .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) guns and instead had a pair of .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) guns in each wing. The distinctive chin airscoop grew larger in order to adequately cool the large Allison engine.
*Retrospective designation for a single prototype. The '''P-40A''' was a single camera-carrying aircraft.
*The '''P-40E''' or '''P-40E-1''' was similar in most respects to the P-40D, except for a slightly more powerful engine and an extra .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) gun in each wing, bringing the total to six. Some aircraft also had small underwing bomb shackles. Supplied to the Commonwealth air forces as the '''Kittyhawk Mk IA'''. The P-40E was the variant that bore the brunt of air-to-air combat by the type in the key period of early to mid 1942, for example with the first US squadrons to replace the AVG in China (the AVG was already transitioning to this type from the P-40B/C), the type used by the Australians at Milne Bay, by the New Zealand squadrons during most of their air to air combat, and by the RAF/Commonwealth in North Africa as the Kittyhawk IA.

Selected aviation cadets were given transition training in these fighters before receiving their pilot's wings, 1943.]]
*'''P-40F''' and '''P-40L''', which both featured [[Packard V-1650|Packard V-1650 Merlin]] engine in place of the normal Allison, and thus did not have the [[carburetor]] scoop on top of the nose. Performance for these models at higher altitudes was better than their Allison-engined cousins. The L in some cases also featured a fillet in front of the [[vertical stabilizer]], or a stretched fuselage to compensate for the higher torque. The P-40L was sometimes nicknamed &quot;[[Gypsy Rose Lee]]&quot;, after a famous stripper of the era, due to its stripped-down condition. Supplied to the Commonwealth air forces under the designation '''Kittyhawk Mk II''', a total of 330 Mk IIs were supplied to the RAF under Lend-Lease. The first 230 aircraft are sometimes known as the '''Kittyhawk Mk IIA'''. The P-40F/L was extensively used by U.S. fighter groups operating in the Mediterranian Theater.
*'''P-40G''' : 43 P-40 aircraft fitted with the wings of the Tomahawk Mk IIA. A total of 16 aircraft were supplied to the Soviet Union, and the rest to the US Army Air Force. It was later redesignated '''RP-40G'''.
*'''P-40K''', an Allison-engined P-40L, with the nosetop scoop retained and the Allison configured scoop and cowl flaps. Supplied to the Commonwealth air forces as the '''Kittyhawk Mk III''', it was widely used by US units in the CBI.
*'''P-40M''', version generally similar to the P-40K, with a stretched fuselage like the P-40L and powered by an Allison V-1710-81 engine giving better performance at altitude (compared to previous Allison versions). It had some detail improvements and it was characterized by two small air scoops just before the exhaust pipes. Most of them were supplied to Allied countries (mainly UK and USSR), while some others remained in the USA for advanced training. It was also supplied to the Commonwealth air forces as the '''Kittyhawk Mk. III'''.
*'''P-40N''' (manufactured 1943–44), the final production model. The P-40N featured a stretched rear fuselage to counter the torque of the larger, late-war Allison engine, and the rear deck of the cockpit behind the pilot was cut down at a moderate slant to improve rearward visibility. A great deal of work was also done to try and eliminate excess weight to improve the Warhawk's climb rate. Early N production blocks dropped a .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) gun from each wing, bringing the total back to four; later production blocks reintroduced it after complaints from units in the field. Supplied to Commonwealth air forces as the '''Kittyhawk Mk IV'''. A total of 553 P-40Ns were acquired by the Royal Australian Air Force, making it the variant most commonly used by the RAAF. Subvariants of the P-40N ranged widely in specialization from stripped down four-gun &quot;hot rods&quot; which could reach the highest top speeds of any production variant of the P-40 (up to 380&amp;nbsp;mph), to overweight types with all the extras intended for fighter-bombing or even training missions.
[[Image:Curtiss P-40N.jpg|thumb|right|Curtiss P-40N Warhawk &quot;Little Jeanne&quot; in flight]]
*'''P-40P''' : The designation of 1,500 aircraft ordered with V-1650-1 engines, but actually built as the P-40N with V-1710-81 engines.
*'''XP-40Q''' with a 4-bladed prop, cut-down rear fuselage and [[bubble canopy]], supercharger, squared-off wingtips and tail surfaces, and improved engine with two-speed supercharger was tested, but its performance was not enough of an improvement to merit production when compared to the contemporary late model '''P-47D'''s and '''P-51D'''s pouring off production lines. The XP-40Q was, however, the fastest of the P-40 series with a top speed of {{convert|422|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} as a result of the introduction of a high altitude supercharger gear. (No P-40 model with a single-speed supercharger could even approach {{convert|400|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}) With the end of hostilities in Europe, the P-40 came to the end of its front line service.
*'''P-40R''' : The designation of P-40F and P-40L aircraft, converted into training aircraft in 1944.
*'''RP-40''' : Some American P-40s were converted into reconnaissance aircraft.
*'''TP-40''' : Some P-40s were converted into two-seat trainers.
*'''Twin P-40''' : Probably the most unusual variant, it was a P-40C outfitted in 1942 with a pair of 1,300&amp;nbsp;hp (969&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Packard V-1650|Packard V-1650-1 Merlin]] engines mounted atop the wings, over the main landing gear.&lt;ref&gt;Donald 1997, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|a statement of belief|the American rock band|Creed (band)|other uses|Creed (disambiguation)}}
[[Image:Nicaea icon.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] depicting [[Constantine I and Christianity|Emperor Constantine]] (center) and the Fathers of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) as holding the Niceno–Constantinopolitan Creed of 381]]
A '''creed''' is a statement of [[belief]]—usually [[religious belief]] or [[faith]]—often recited as part of a religious service. The word derives from the {{lang-la|[[credo]]}} for &quot;I believe&quot; (because the Latin translation of the [[Apostles' Creed]] and the [[Nicene Creed]] both begin with this word). A creed is sometimes referred to as a ''symbol'' ({{lang-el|σύμβολο[ν]}}, ''sýmbolo[n]''), signifying a &quot;token&quot; by which persons of like beliefs might recognize each other.

One of the most widely used creeds in [[Christianity]] is the [[Nicene Creed]], first formulated in AD 325 at the [[First Council of Nicaea]]. It was based on Christian understanding of the [[Canonical gospels]], the letters of the [[New Testament]] and to a lesser extent the [[Old Testament]]. Affirmation of this creed, which describes the [[Trinity]], is generally taken as a fundamental test of [[orthodoxy]] for most [[Christian denominations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm Johnson, Phillip R. &quot;The Nicene Creed.&quot;] Accessed 17 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Apostles' Creed]] is also broadly accepted. Some Christian denominations and other groups have rejected the [[Creed#Christians without creeds|authority of those creeds]].

Whether Judaism is creedal has been a point of some controversy. Though some say Judaism is noncreedal in nature, others say it recognizes a single creed, the [[Shema Yisrael|Shema]] which begins: &quot;Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God, the LORD is one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;A quote of {{bibleverse||Deut|6:4|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muslim]]s declare the [[shahada]], or testimony: &quot;I bear witness that there is no god but God, and that Muhammad is His messenger.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamiclearningmaterials.com/shahada.html &quot;Proclaiming the Shahada is the First Step Into Islam.&quot;] Islamic Learning Materials. Accessed: 17 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms &quot;creed&quot; and &quot;faith&quot; are sometimes used to mean religion. Where &quot;creed&quot; appears alongside &quot;religion&quot; or &quot;faith,&quot; it can also refer to a person's political or social beliefs, for example The [[American's Creed]]. 

[[Pope Paul VI]] published on June 30, 1968 a profession of faith or creed, called the [[Credo of the People of God]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19680630_credo_en.html ''Solemni hac liturgia (Credo of the People of God)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian creed==
From [[Early Christianity]] sub streams of Christianity evolved, each with their own beliefs.

Some prominent groups as identified by Professor Bellinzoni, are: 
* [[Pauline Christianity]]
* [[Johannine Christianity]]
* [[Gnosticism|Gnostic Christianity]] and
* [[Jewish Christianity]]
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wells.edu/whatsnew/wnspch25.htm The Early Christian Community: From Diversity to Unity to Orthodoxy], lecture delivered February 25, 2000 to the Wells College Faculty Club by Arthur J. Bellinzoni, Professor of Religion, [[Wells College]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apostles' Creed===
{{Main|Apostles' Creed}}
The [[Apostles' Creed]] is widely used by most [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] for both [[liturgy|liturgical]] and [[catechetical]] purposes, most visibly by liturgical Churches of Western tradition, including the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Lutheranism]], the [[Anglican Communion]], and [[Western Orthodoxy]]. It is also used by [[Presbyterian]]s, [[Methodist]]s, and [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].

===Nicene Creed===
{{Main|Nicene Creed}}
The [[Nicene Creed]] reflects the concerns of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 which had as their chief purpose to establish what Christians believed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm Kiefer, James E. &quot;The Nicene Creed.&quot;] Accessed 17 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===A creed as a denial of heresies===
In an atmosphere of increasingly complicated theological controversy, orthodox belief might become more complicated in outline. In the decade before 594, [[Gregory of Tours|Gregory, bishop of Tours]] set out to write a &quot;History of the Franks.&quot; In Gaul, a part of Europe that had been recently beset with both royal [[Arian]]s and pagans (until the conversion of [[Clovis I|Clovis]]), Gregory prefaced his history with a declaration of his faith, &quot;so that my reader may have no doubt that I am Catholic for they are.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Book I.i&lt;/ref&gt; The confession is in many phrases, each of which refutes a specific Christian heresy. Thus Gregory's creed presents, in the negative, a virtual litany of heresies:

{{Quote|I believe, then, in God the Father omnipotent. I believe in Jesus Christ his only Son, our Lord God, born of the Father, not created. [I believe] that he has always been with the Father, not only since time began but before all time. For the Father could not have been so named unless he had a son; and there could be no son without a father. But as for those who say: &quot;There was a time when he was not,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;There was a time when he (the Holy Spirit) was not&quot; was a leading belief of the Arian heresy at the time.&lt;/ref&gt; I reject them with curses, and call men to witness that they are separated from the church. I believe that the word of the Father by which all things were made was Christ. I believe that this word was made flesh and by its suffering the world was redeemed, and I believe that humanity, not deity, was subject to the suffering. I believe that he rose again on the third day, that he freed sinful man, that he ascended to heaven, that he sits on the right hand of the Father, that he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;and the Son&quot; was instituted by the Catholic Church after the Nicene Council, but rejected by the other 4 Christian Churches at the time, referred to as the [[filoque]]&lt;/ref&gt; that it is not inferior and is not of later origin, but is God, equal and always co­eternal with the Father and the Son, consubstantial in its nature, equal in omnipotence, equally eternal in its essence, and that it has never existed apart from the Father and the Son and is not inferior to the Father and the Son. I believe that this holy Trinity exists with separation of persons, and one person is that of the Father, another that the Son, another that of the Holy Spirit. And in this Trinity confess that there is one Deity, one power, one essence. I believe that the blessed Mary was a virgin after the birth as she was a virgin before. I believe that the soul is immortal but that nevertheless it has no part in deity. And I faithfully believe all things that were established at by the three hundred and eighteen bishops. But as to the end of the world I hold beliefs which I learned from our forefathers, that Antichrist will come first. An Antichrist will first propose circumcision, asserting that he is Christ; next he will place his statue in the temple at Jerusalem to be worshipped, just as we read that the Lord said: &quot;You shall see the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place.&quot; But the Lord himself declared that that day is hidden from all men, saying; &quot;But of that day and that hour knoweth no one not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father alone.&quot; Moreover we shall here make answer to the heretics [note: the Arians] who attack us, asserting that the Son is inferior to the Father since he is ignorant of this day. Let them learn then that Son here is the name applied to the Christian people, of whom God says: &quot;I shall be to them a father and they shall be to me for sons.&quot; For if he had spoken these words of the only­ begotten Son he would never have given the angels first place. For he uses these words: &quot;Not even the angels in heaven nor the Son&quot;, showing that he spoke these words not of the only-begotten but of the people of adoption. But our end is Christ himself, who will graciously bestow eternal life on us if we turn to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gregory-hist.html#book3 Gregory of Tours (539-594): History of the Franks: Books I-X &quot;IN CHRIST'S NAME HERE BEGINS THE FIRST BOOK OF THE HISTORIES.&quot;] Medieval Sourcebook&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Christians without creeds===
{{Main|Free Christian}}
Some Christian denominations, and particularly those descending from the [[Radical Reformation]], do not profess a creed. The Quakers, formally known as the [[Religious Society of Friends]], find no need for creedal formulations of faith. The [[Church of the Brethren]] also espouses no creed, referring to the New Testament, as their &quot;rule of faith and practice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Harold S.: [http://www.brfwitness.org/?p=88 &quot;Forward&quot;], &quot;Basic Beliefs Within the Church of the Brethren&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] contrast &quot;memorizing or repeating creeds&quot; with acting to &quot;do what Jesus said&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Creeds—Any Place in True Worship?&quot;, ''Awake!'', October 8, 1985, ©Watch Tower, page 23, &quot;The opening words of a creed invariably are, “I believe” or, “We believe.” This expression is translated from the Latin word “credo,” from which comes the word “creed.” ...What do we learn from Jesus’ words? That it is valueless in God’s eyes for one merely to repeat what one claims to believe. ...Thus, rather than memorizing or repeating creeds, we must do what Jesus said&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalists]], who practice probably the most liberal of all religions, do not share a creed.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, Bill. &quot;Leading the Unitarian Universalist Association, a faith without a creed.&quot; ''St. Petersburg Times.'' Apr 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Many evangelical Protestants similarly reject creeds as definitive statements faith, even while agreeing with some creeds' substance. The [[Baptists]] have been non-creedal &quot;in that they have not sought to establish binding authoritative confessions of faith on one another&quot;.&lt;ref name=Avis&gt;Avis, Paul (2002) ''The Christian Church: An Introduction to the Major Traditions'', SPCK, London, ISBN 0-281-05246-8 paperback&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.111}} While many Baptists are not opposed to the ancient creeds, they regard them as &quot;not so final that they cannot be revised and re-expressed. At best, creeds have a penultimacy about them and, of themselves, could never be the basis of Christian fellowship&quot;.&lt;ref name=Avis/&gt;{{rp|p.112}} Moreover, Baptist &quot;confessions of faith&quot; have often had a clause such as this from the First London (Particular) Baptist Confession (Revised edition, 1646):
{{quote|Also we confess that we now know but in part and that are ignorant of many things which we desire to and seek to know: and if any shall do us that friendly part to show us from the Word of God that we see not, we shall have cause to be thankful to God and to them.}}

Similar reservations about the use of creeds can be found in the [[Restoration Movement]] and its descendants, the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]], the [[Churches of Christ]], and the [[Independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ]].

Some religious leaders in traditional creedal Churches have also come to question the utility of creeds. Bishop [[John Shelby Spong]], retired [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] Bishop of Newark, has written that dogmas and creeds were merely &quot;a stage in our development&quot; and &quot;part of our religious childhood.&quot; In his book, ''Sins of the Scripture'', Spong claims that &quot;Jesus seemed to understand that no one can finally fit the holy God into his or her creeds or doctrines. That is idolatry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Many people said (the Apostles Creed), but they understood what it was saying and what they meant by that quite differently. No matter how hard they tried, they could not close out this perennial debate. They cannot establish a consensus and they could not agree on the meaning of that phrase which had been once &quot;delivered to the saints.&quot; It did not occur to these people that the task they were trying to accomplish was not a human possibility, that the mystery of God, including the God they believed they had met in Jesus, could not be reduced to human words and human concepts or captured inside human creeds. Nor did they understand that the tighter and more specific their words became, the less they would achieve the task of unifying the church. All creeds have ever done is to define those who are outside, who were not true believers; and thus their primarily achievement has been to set up eternal conflict between the &quot;ins&quot; and the &quot;outs,&quot; a conflict that has repeatedly degenerated into the darkest sort of Christian behavior, including imperialism, torture, persecution, death and war.&lt;ref&gt;Spong, John S. ''The sins of Scripture.'' HarperCollins, 2005. ISBN 9780060762056, p.226&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Jewish creed==
{{see also|Jewish principles of faith}}
Whether [[Judaism]] is creedal in character has generated some controversy. [[Rabbi]] [[Milton Steinberg]] wrote that &quot;By its nature Judaism is averse to formal creeds which of necessity limit and restrain thought&quot; and asserted in his book ''Basic Judaism'' (1947) that &quot;Judaism has never arrived at a creed.&quot; The 1976 Centenary Platform of the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]], an organization of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] rabbis agrees that &quot;Judaism emphasizes action rather than creed as the primary expression of a religious life.&quot;

Others, however, characterize the [[Shema Yisrael]]{{Bibleref2c|Deut.|6:4}} as a creedal statement in strict [[monotheism]] embodied in a single prayer. &quot;Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One&quot; ({{lang-he|שמע ישראל אדני אלהינו אדני אחד}}; [[Romanization of Hebrew|transliterated]] ''Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad''.) It is recited twice daily by all observant Jews, once when waking up, and once when going to bed.

==Islamic creed==
{{Main|Islamic creed#Six articles of belief|Principles of the Religion#Articles of faith}}
The [[Islam]]ic creed is the [[Shahadah]], the proclamation لا اله الا الله محمد رسول الله (''lâ ilâha illallâh, Muḥammadur rasûlullâh'' – &quot;There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger.&quot;) Taking this creed is one of the [[five pillars of Islam]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''[[Aelianus Tacticus]], Greek military writer of the 2nd century, resident at Rome, is sometimes confused with Claudius Aelianus.''

'''Claudius Aelianus''' (ca. 175 – ca. 235), often seen as just '''Aelian''', born at [[Praeneste]], was a Roman author and teacher of [[rhetoric]] who flourished under [[Septimius Severus]] and probably outlived [[Elagabalus]], who died in 222. He spoke [[Greek language|Greek]] so perfectly that he was called &quot;honey-tongued&quot; (''meliglossos''); Roman-born, he preferred Greek authors, and wrote in a slightly archaizing Greek himself.

His two chief works are valuable for the numerous quotations from the works of earlier authors, which are otherwise lost, and for the surprising lore, which offers unexpected glimpses into the Greco-Roman world-view. 

==''De Natura Animalium (Περὶ Ζῴων Ἰδιότητος)''==
''On the Nature of Animals,'' (&quot;On the Characteristics of Animals&quot; is an alternative title; usually cited, though, by its Latin title), is a curious collection, in 17&amp;nbsp;books, of brief stories of natural history, sometimes selected with an eye to conveying allegorical moral lessons, sometimes because they are just so astonishing:
:&quot;The Beaver is an amphibious creature: by day it lives hidden in rivers, but at night it roams the land, feeding itself with anything that it can find. Now it understands the reason why hunters come after it with such eagerness and impetuosity, and it puts down its head and with its teeth cuts off its testicles and throws them in their path, as a prudent man who, falling into the hands of robbers, sacrifices all that he is carrying, to save his life, and forfeits his possessions by way of ransom. If however it has already saved its life by self-castration and is again pursued, then it stands up and reveals that it offers no ground for their eager pursuit, and releases the hunters from all further exertions, for they esteem its flesh less. Often however Beavers with testicles intact, after escaping as far away as possible, have drawn in the coveted part, and with great skill and ingenuity tricked their pursuers, pretending that they no longer possessed what they were keeping in concealment.&quot;

The [[Loeb Classical Library]] introduction characterizes the book as
:&quot;an appealing collection of facts and fables about the animal kingdom that invites the reader to ponder contrasts between human and animal behavior.&quot;

Aelian's anecdotes on animals rarely depend on direct observation: they are almost entirely taken from written sources, often [[Pliny the Elder]], but also other authors and works now lost, to whom he is thus a valuable witness.&lt;ref&gt;The third volume of the Loeb Classical Library translation gives a gazetteer of authors cited by Aelian.&lt;/ref&gt; He is more attentive to marine life than might be expected, though, and this seems to reflect first-hand personal interest; he often quotes &quot;fishermen&quot;. At times he strikes the modern reader as thoroughly credulous, but at others he specifically states that he is merely reporting what is told by others, and even that he does not believe them. Aelian's work is one of the sources of medieval natural history and of the [[Bestiary|bestiaries]] of the Middle Ages; in some ways an allegory of the moral world, an [[Emblem]] Book. 

The text as it has come down to us is badly mangled and garbled and replete with later interpolations.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Aelian's text, riddled as it is with corrupt passages and packed with interpretations,provides ample scope for reckless emendation,&quot; D. E. Eichholz observed, reviewing Sholfield's Loeb Library translation in ''The Classical Review'' 1960:219, and praising the translator for restrait in this direction.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conrad Gessner]] (or Gesner), the Swiss scientist and natural historian of the Renaissance, made a Latin translation of Aelian's work, to give it a wider European audience. An English translation by A. F. Scholfield has been published in the [[Loeb Classical Library]], 3 vols. (19[ ]-59).

==''Varia Historia (Ποικίλη Ἱστορία)''==
[[File:Claudius Aelianus Varia Historia 1668 Title page.jpg|right|thumb|Title page of ''Varia Historia'', from the 1668 edition by Tanaquil Faber]]
''Various History'' &amp;mdash; for the most part preserved only in an abridged form &amp;mdash; is Aelian's other well-known work, a miscellany of anecdotes and biographical sketches, lists, pithy maxims, and descriptions of natural wonders and strange local customs, in 14&amp;nbsp;books, with many surprises for the cultural historian and the [[mythographer]], anecdotes about the famous Greek philosophers, poets, historians, and playwrights and myths instructively retold. The emphasis is on ''various'' moralizing tales about heroes and rulers, athletes and wise men; reports about food and drink, different styles in dress or lovers, local habits in giving gifts or entertainments, or in religious beliefs and death customs; and comments on Greek painting. Aelian gives an account of [[fly fishing]], using [[Artificial fly|lures]] of red wool and feathers, of lacquerwork, [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] worship &amp;mdash; Essentially the ''Various History'' is a Classical &quot;[[magazine]]&quot; in the original senses of that word. He is not perfectly trustworthy in details, and his agenda is always to inculcate culturally &quot;correct&quot; [[Stoicism|Stoic]] opinions{{Fact|date=October 2007}}, perhaps so that his readers will not feel guilty, but [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] found survivals of archaic rites mentioned by Aelian very illuminating in her ''Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion'' (1903, 1922).

The first printing was in 1545. The standard modern text is Mervin R. Dilts's, of 1974. 

Two English translations of the ''Various History,''  by Fleming (1576) and Stanley (1665) made Aelian's miscellany available to English readers, but after 1665 no English translation appeared, until three English translations appeared almost simultaneously: James G. DeVoto, ''Claudius Aelianus: Ποιϰίλης Ἱοτορίας (&quot;Varia Historia&quot;)'' Chicago, 1995; Diane Ostrom Johnson, ''An English Translation of Claudius Aelianus' &quot;Varia Historia&quot;'', 1997; and N. G. Wilson, ''Aelian: Historical Miscellany'' in the [[Loeb Classical Library]].

==Other works==
Considerable fragments of two other works, ''On Providence'' and ''Divine Manifestations'', are preserved in the early medieval encyclopedia, the ''[[Suda]].''  Twenty &quot;letters from a farmer&quot; after the manner of [[Alciphron]] are also attributed to him. The letters are invented compositions to a fictitious correspondent, which are a device for vignettes of agricultural and rural life, set in Attica, though mellifluous Aelian once boasted that he had never been outside Italy, never been aboard a ship (which is at variance, though, with his own statement, ''de Natura Animalium'' XI.40, that he had seen the bull [[Serapis]] with his own eyes). Thus conclusions about actual agriculture in the ''Letters'' are as likely to evoke [[Latium]] as [[Attica]]. The fragments have been edited in 1998 by D. Domingo-Foraste, but are not available in English. The ''Letters'' are available in the Loeb Classical Library, translated by Allen Rogers Benner and Francis H. Fobes (1949).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:François Boucher 012.jpg|thumb|250px|In ''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and Callisto'' by [[François Boucher]], [[Zeus]] takes the form of [[Artemis]]/[[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] ([[Pushkin Museum]], [[Moscow]])]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Callisto''' or '''Kallisto''' ({{lang-el|Καλλιστώ}} {{IPA-el|kallisˈtɔː|}}) was a [[nymph]] of [[Artemis]]. Transformed into a bear and [[Catasterismi|set among the stars]], she was the bear-mother of the [[Arcadia]]ns, through her son [[Arcas]].

==Myth==
As a follower of Artemis,  Callisto, who [[Hesiod]] said&lt;ref&gt;In his lost ''Astronomy'', quoted in ''[[Catasterismi]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; was the daughter of [[Lycaon (mythology)|Lycaon]], king of [[Arcadia]],&lt;ref&gt;Other writers gave her a mortal genealogy as the daughter of one or the other of Lycaon's sons: Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; took a vow to remain a virgin, as did all the nymphs of Artemis. But to have her, Zeus disguised himself, Ovid says, as Artemis (Diana) herself, in order to lure her into his embrace. Callisto was then turned into a [[bear]], as Hesiod had told it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''...but afterwards, when she was already with child, was seen bathing and so discovered. Upon this, the goddess was enraged and changed her into a beast. Thus she became a bear and gave birth to a son called [[Arcas]].''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Either Artemis &quot;slew Kallisto with a shot of her silver bow,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Homer#Works ascribed to Homer| Homerica, The Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]'', 316 ff (trans. Hugh G. Evelyn-White).&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps urged by the wrath of [[Hera]],&lt;ref&gt;This was the version current in Greece when Pausanias visited in the second century CE ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], VIII.35.8).&lt;/ref&gt; or, later, Arcas, the eponym of [[Arcadia]], nearly killed his bear-mother, when she had wandered into the [[Temenos|forbidden precinct]] of Zeus. In every case, Zeus placed them both in the sky as the [[constellation]]s [[Ursa Major]], called ''Arktos'' (αρκτος), the &quot;Bear&quot;, by Greeks, and [[Ursa Minor]].

According to [[Ovid]],&lt;ref&gt;Ovid. ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''. Book II, Lines 405-531; Ovid narrates the myth also in ''[[Fasti]]'', book II.&lt;/ref&gt; it was [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (the Roman Zeus) who took the form of Artemis/[[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] so that he might evade his wife [[Juno (mythology)|Juno’s]] detection, forcing himself upon Callisto while she was separated from Diana and the other nymphs.&lt;ref&gt;The transformation of Zeus, with its [[lesbian]] overtones, was rendered as comedy in a lost work by the Attic Amphis ([http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Kallisto.html Theoi Project - Kallisto]).&lt;/ref&gt; Her pregnant condition was discovered some months later while bathing with Diana and her fellow nymphs. Upon this, Diana was enraged and expelled Callisto from the group, and subsequently she gave birth to [[Arcas]]. Juno then took the opportunity to avenge her wounded pride and transformed the nymph into a bear. Sixteen years later Callisto, still a bear, encountered her son Arcas hunting in the forest. Just as Arcas was about to kill his own mother with his javelin, Jupiter averted the tragedy by placing mother and son amongst the stars as [[Ursa Major]] and [[Ursa Minor|Minor]], respectively. Juno, enraged that her attempt at revenge had been frustrated, appealed to [[Oceanus]] that the two might never meet his waters, thus providing a poetic explanation for their [[circumpolar star|circumpolar]] positions.

The stars of Ursa Major were all circumpolar in Athens of 400 BCE, and all but the stars in the Great Bear's left foot were circumpolar in Ovid's Rome, in the first century CE. Now, however, due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]], the feet of the Great Bear constellation do sink below the horizon from Rome and especially from Athens — so Ursa Major gets to cool her feet and legs in the sea, in spite of Ovid; however, Ursa Minor (Arcas) does remain completely above the horizon, even from latitudes as far south as Honolulu and Hong Kong. 

==Origin of the myth==

[[Image:Tizian 015.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]]'s ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'' (1559) portrays the moment when Callisto's pregnancy is discovered ([[National Gallery of Scotland]]).]]
[[Aeschylus]]' tragedy ''Callisto'' is lost.

The name ''Kalliste'' (Καλλίστη), &quot;most beautiful&quot;, may be recognized as an epithet of the goddess herself, though none of the inscriptions at Athens that record priests of ''Artemis Kalliste'' (Άρτεμις Καλλίστη), date before the third century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Geagan. &quot;The Athenian Constitution After Sulla&quot; (''Hesperia Supplements'' '''12''' 1967:72, 95).&lt;/ref&gt; Artemis Kalliste was worshipped in Athens in a shrine which lay outside the Dipylon gate, by the side of the road to the [[Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Klio: Beiträge zur alten Geschichte'' (Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin Institut für Griechisch-Römische Altertumskunde) 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; W. S. Ferguson suggested&lt;ref&gt;In ''Klio'' '''7''' (1907:213f).&lt;/ref&gt; that Artemis Soteira and Artemis Kalliste were joined in a common cult administered by a single priest. The bearlike character of Artemis herself was a feature of the [[Brauronia]]. 

The myth in ''[[Catasterismi]]'' may be derived from the fact that a set of constellations appear close together in the sky, in and near the [[Zodiac]] sign of [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], namely Ursa Minor, Ursa Major, [[Boötes]], and [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]]. The [[Boötes|constellation Boötes]], was explicitly identified in the Hesiodic ''Astronomia'' (Αστρονομία)&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Astronomia'', fragment 3, preserved as a quote in a commentary on [[Aratus]].&lt;/ref&gt; as Arcas, the &quot;Bear-warden&quot; (''Arktophylax''; Αρκτοφύλαξ):&lt;ref&gt;Thus Hesiod is quoted, though Boötes, Βοώτης, from his very name, is a ''cow'' (βοως) herdsman.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''He is Arkas the son of Kallisto and Zeus, and he lived in the country about Lykaion. After Zeus had seduced Kallisto, Lykaon, pretending not to know of the matter, entertained Zeus, as Hesiod says, and set before him on the table the babe [Arkas] which he had cut up.''&lt;ref&gt;The episode is a doublet of the serving up of [[Pelops]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], a '''cookie''' is a small, flat-baked treat, usually containing [[fat]], flour, eggs and sugar. In most English-speaking countries outside [[North America]], the most common word for this is '''[[biscuit]]'''; in many regions both terms are used, while in others the two words have different meanings. A '''cookie''' is a plain [[bun]] in Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026125/cookie cookie - Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; while in the United States a '''biscuit''' is a kind of [[quick bread]] similar to a [[Scone (bread)|scone]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], a cookie is referred to as a baked biscuit most commonly containing [[chocolate chips]].

==Etymology==
Its name derives from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''koekje'' or (informal) ''koekie'' which means ''little cake,'' and arrived in the [[English language]] through the Dutch in North America.

==Description==
[[File:Různé druhy cukroví (2).jpg|thumb|right|A dish full of cookies]]
Cookies are most commonly baked until crisp or just long enough that they remain soft, but some kinds of cookies are not baked at all. Cookies are made in a wide variety of styles, using an array of ingredients including sugars, [[spice]]s, chocolate, [[butter]], [[peanut butter]], [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s or dried [[fruit]]s. The softness of the cookie may depend on how long it is baked. 

A general theory of cookies may be formulated this way. Despite its descent from cakes and other sweetened breads, the cookie in almost all its forms has abandoned water as a medium for cohesion. Water in cakes serves to make the base (in the case of cakes called &quot;batter&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', Tenth Edition. Merriam-Webster, Inc.: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;) as thin as possible, which allows the bubbles – responsible for a cake's fluffiness – to form better. In the cookie, the agent of cohesion has become some form of oil. Oils, whether they be in the form of butter, egg yolks, vegetable oils or lard are much more viscous than water and evaporate freely at a much higher temperature than water. Thus a cake made with butter or eggs instead of water is far denser after removal from the oven.

Oils in baked cakes do not behave as soda tends to in the finished result. Rather than evaporating and thickening the mixture, they remain, saturating the bubbles of escaped gases from what little water there might have been in the eggs, if added, and the [[carbon dioxide]] released by heating the baking powder. This saturation produces the most texturally attractive feature of the cookie, and indeed all fried foods: crispness saturated with a moisture (namely oil) that does not sink into it.

==History==
[[File:Koekjestrommel open.jpg|thumb|left|Cookies packed in a tin for shipment]]
Cookie-like hard wafers have existed for as long as baking is documented, in part because they deal with travel very well, but they were usually not sweet enough to be considered cookies by modern standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcookies.html http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcookies.html] ''Foodtimeline.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

Cookies appear to have their origins in 7th century [[Persia]], shortly after the use of sugar became relatively common in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/CookieHistory.htm http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/CookieHistory.htm] ''Whatscookingamerica.net''&lt;/ref&gt; They spread to Europe through the [[Muslim]] conquest of [[Spain]]. By the 14th century, they were common in all levels of society, throughout Europe, from royal cuisine to street vendors. 

With global travel becoming widespread at that time, cookies made a natural travel companion, a modernized equivalent of the travel cakes used throughout history. One of the most popular early cookies, which traveled especially well and became known on every continent by similar names, was the [[Jumble (cookie)|jumble]], a relatively hard cookie made largely from nuts, sweetener, and water. 

Cookies came to America in the early English settlement (the 17th century), although the name &quot;koekje&quot; arrived with the Dutch. This became Anglicized to &quot;cookie&quot; or '''cooky'''. Among the popular early American cookies were the [[macaroon]], [[gingerbread cookie]]s, and of course jumbles of various types.

The most common modern cookie, given its style by the creaming of butter and sugar, was not common until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ochef.com/25.htm http://www.ochef.com/25.htm] ''Ochef.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification of cookies==
[[Image:Christmas Cookies Plateful.JPG|right|thumb|A variety of cookies, including [[gingerbread men]] and drop and molded cookies]]
[[Image:Cookie Cake.JPG|right|thumb|150px|A cookie cake is a large cookie that can be decorated with icing similar to other [[cakes]].]] 
[[File:Nice biscuit.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A [[Nice biscuit]] from Britain]] 
Cookies are broadly classified according to how they are formed, including at least these categories:
* ''Drop cookies'' are made from a relatively soft dough that is dropped by spoonfuls onto the baking sheet. During baking, the mounds of dough spread and flatten. [[Chocolate chip]] cookies (Toll House cookies), [[oatmeal]] (or oatmeal raisin) cookies and [[rock cake]]s are popular examples of drop cookies.
* ''Refrigerator cookies'' (also known as ''icebox cookies'') are made from a stiff dough that is refrigerated to become even stiffer. The dough is typically shaped into cylinders which are sliced into round cookies before baking.
* ''Molded cookies'' are also made from a stiffer dough that is molded into balls or cookie shapes by hand before baking. [[Snickerdoodle]]s and [[peanut butter cookies]] are examples of molded cookies.
* ''Rolled cookies'' are made from a stiffer dough that is rolled out and cut into shapes with a [[cookie cutter]]. [[Gingerbread man|Gingerbread men]] are an example.
* ''Pressed cookies'' are made from a soft dough that is extruded from a [[cookie press]] into various decorative shapes before baking. [[Spritzgebäck]] are an example of a pressed cookie.
* ''Bar cookies'' consist of batter or other ingredients that are poured or pressed into a pan (sometimes in multiple layers), and cut into cookie-sized pieces after baking. [[Chocolate brownies|Brownies]] are an example of a batter-type bar cookie, while [[Rice Krispie treats]] are a bar cookie that doesn't require baking, perhaps similar to a [[cereal]] bar. In [[British English]], bar cookies are known as &quot;tray bakes&quot;.
* ''Sandwich cookies'' are rolled or pressed cookies that are assembled as a [[sandwich]] with a sweet filling. Fillings may be with [[marshmallow]], [[jam]], or [[icing (food)|icing]]. The [[Oreo]] cookie, made of two chocolate cookies with a [[vanilla]] icing filling is an example.
Cookies also may be decorated with an icing, especially [[chocolate]], and closely resemble a type of [[confectionery]].

==Biscuits (cookies) in the United Kingdom==

A basic biscuit (cookie) recipe includes [[flour]], [[shortening]] (often [[lard]]), [[baking powder]] or [[sodium bicarbonate|soda]], [[milk]] ([[buttermilk]] or sweet milk) and sugar. Common savory variations involve substituting [[sugar]] with an ingredient such as cheese or other dairy products. [[Shortbread]] is a popular biscuit in the UK.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|the scripting language|the term &quot;CGI&quot; in computer graphics|Computer-generated imagery}}

The '''Common Gateway Interface''' ('''CGI''') is a standard (see RFC 3875: ''CGI Version 1.1'') that defines how [[web server]] software can delegate the generation of [[web page]]s to a stand-alone application, an executable file.  Such applications are known as ''CGI scripts''; they can be written in any programming language, although [[scripting language]]s are often used.

==Technical overview==
&lt;!-- Please do not remove or change this Copyvio message until the issue is settled --&gt;
{{Nobots}}
{{Copyviocore

&lt;!-- Do not use the &quot;Copyviocore&quot; template directly; the above line is generated by &quot;subst:Copyvio|url&quot; --&gt;
The common gateway interface (CGI) is a [[Technical standard|standard]] way for a [[Web server]] to pass a Web user's request to an application program and to receive data back to forward to the user. When the user requests a Web page (for example, by clicking on a hyperlink or entering a Web site address), the server sends back the requested page. However, when a user fills out a [[Form (web)|form]] on a Web page and sends it in, it usually needs to be processed by an application program. The Web server typically passes the form information to a small application program that processes the data and may send back a confirmation message. This method or convention for passing data back and forth between the server and the application is called the common gateway interface (CGI).

If you are creating a Web site and want a CGI application to get control, you specify the name of the application in the uniform resource locator ([[URL]]) that you code in an [[HTML]] file. This URL can be specified as part of the [[HTML element#Forms|forms tags]] if you are creating a form. For example, you might code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;form method=&quot;POST&quot; action=&quot;http://www.mybiz.com/cgi-bin/formprog.pl&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

and the server at &quot;mybiz.com&quot; would pass control to the CGI application called &quot;formprog.pl&quot; to record the entered data and return a confirmation message. (The &quot;.pl&quot; indicates a program written in [[Perl]] but other languages could have been used.)

The common gateway interface provides a consistent way for data to be passed from the user's request to the application program and back to the user. This means that the person who writes the application program can make sure it gets used no matter which operating system the server uses ([[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[Macintosh]], [[UNIX]], [[OS/390]], or others). It's simply a basic way for information to be passed from the Web server about your request to the application program and back again.
&lt;/div&gt;
==More details==
A web server that supports CGI can be configured to interpret a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] that it serves as a reference to CGI scripts. A common convention is to have a &lt;tt&gt;cgi-bin/&lt;/tt&gt; [[folder (computing)|directory]] at the base of the directory tree and treat all executable files within it as CGI scripts. Another popular convention is to use [[filename extension]]s; for instance, if CGI scripts are consistently given the extension &lt;tt&gt;.cgi&lt;/tt&gt;, the web server can be configured to interpret all such files as CGI scripts.

=== Input data ===
{{section-links|fr=Variables d'environnement CGI}}
Data is passed into the program using [[environment variables]]. This is in contrast to typical execution, where [[command-line argument]]s are used. In the case of [[HTTP#Request_methods|HTTP PUT or POSTs]], the user-submitted data is provided to the program via the [[standard input]].

The following environment variables are passed to a CGI program:
*'''Server specific variables:'''
**&lt;tt&gt;SERVER_SOFTWARE&lt;/tt&gt; — &lt;var&gt;name&lt;/var&gt;/&lt;var&gt;version&lt;/var&gt; of [[HTTP server]].
**&lt;tt&gt;SERVER_NAME&lt;/tt&gt; — [[host name]] of the server, may be [[dot-decimal notation|dot-decimal]] IP address.
**&lt;tt&gt;GATEWAY_INTERFACE&lt;/tt&gt; — CGI/&lt;var&gt;version&lt;/var&gt;.
*'''Request specific variables:'''
**&lt;tt&gt;SERVER_PROTOCOL&lt;/tt&gt; — HTTP/&lt;var&gt;version&lt;/var&gt;.
**&lt;tt&gt;SERVER_PORT&lt;/tt&gt; — [[TCP port]] (decimal).
**&lt;tt&gt;REQUEST_METHOD&lt;/tt&gt; — name of HTTP method (see above).
**&lt;tt&gt;PATH_INFO&lt;/tt&gt; — path suffix, if appended to URL after program name and a slash.
**&lt;tt&gt;PATH_TRANSLATED&lt;/tt&gt; — corresponding [[full path]] as supposed by server, if &lt;tt&gt;PATH_INFO&lt;/tt&gt; is present.
**&lt;tt&gt;SCRIPT_NAME&lt;/tt&gt; — relative path to the program, like &lt;tt&gt;/cgi-bin/script.cgi&lt;/tt&gt;.
**&lt;tt&gt;QUERY_STRING&lt;/tt&gt; — the part of URL after [[question mark|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#FFFFCC; padding: 2px&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;]] character. May be composed of *&lt;var&gt;name&lt;/var&gt;=&lt;var&gt;value&lt;/var&gt; pairs separated with [[ampersand]]s (such as &lt;var&gt;var1&lt;/var&gt;=&lt;var&gt;val1&lt;/var&gt;'''&amp;amp;'''&lt;var&gt;var2&lt;/var&gt;=&lt;var&gt;val2&lt;/var&gt;…) when used to submit [[form (web)|form]] data transferred via GET method as defined by HTML [[application/x-www-form-urlencoded]].
**&lt;tt&gt;REMOTE_HOST&lt;/tt&gt; — host name of the client, unset if server did not perform such lookup.
**&lt;tt&gt;REMOTE_ADDR&lt;/tt&gt; — [[IP address]] of the client (dot-decimal).
**&lt;tt&gt;AUTH_TYPE&lt;/tt&gt; — identification type, if applicable.
**&lt;tt&gt;REMOTE_USER&lt;/tt&gt; used for certain &lt;tt&gt;AUTH_TYPE&lt;/tt&gt;s.
**&lt;tt&gt;REMOTE_IDENT&lt;/tt&gt; — see [[ident]], only if server performed such lookup.
**&lt;tt&gt;CONTENT_TYPE&lt;/tt&gt; — [[MIME type]] of input data if PUT or POST method are used, as provided via HTTP header.
**&lt;tt&gt;CONTENT_LENGTH&lt;/tt&gt; — similarly, size of input data (decimal, in [[octet (computing)|octets]]) if provided via HTTP header.
**Variables passed by user agent (&lt;tt&gt;HTTP_ACCEPT&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;HTTP_USER_AGENT&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;HTTP_COOKIE&lt;/tt&gt; and possibly others) contain values of corresponding [[HTTP headers]] and therefore have the same sense.

=== Output format ===
The program returns the result to the web server in the form of standard output, prefixed by a header and a [[blank line]].

The header is encoded in the same way as an [[List of HTTP headers|HTTP header]] and must include the [[MIME type]] of the document returned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/primer.html CGI Primer]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headers are generally forwarded with the response back to the user, supplemented by the web server.

==Example==
An example of a CGI program is one implementing a [[wiki]]. The user agent requests the name of an entry; the server retrieves the source of that entry's page (if one exists), transforms it into [[HTML]], and sends the result.

==History==
In 1993, the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW) was small but booming. WWW software developers and web site developers kept in touch on the www-talk mailing list, so it was there that a standard for calling command line executables was agreed upon. Specifically mentioned in RFC 3875&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3875.txt RFC3875: The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Version 1.1]&lt;/ref&gt; are the following contributors:
* [[Rob McCool]] (author of the [[NCSA httpd]] [[HTTP server|web server]])
* John Franks (author of the GN web server)
* Ari Luotonen (the developer of the [[CERN httpd]] web server)
* Tony Sanders (author of the Plexus web server)
* George Phillips (web server maintainer at the [[University of British Columbia]])
The [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications|NCSA]] team wrote the specification,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q4/0485.html ''Server Scripts'', by Rob McCool, ''www-talk'' mailing list, Sun, 14 Nov 1993 19:24:47 -0600]&lt;/ref&gt; however, NCSA no longer hosts this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/ ''The Common Gateway Interface''] {{Dead link|date=May 2010}}at NCSA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/CGI/ CGI: Common Gateway Interface] at w3.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The other web server developers adopted it, and it has been a standard for web servers ever since. Since its initial adoption an effort was mounted to get it published more formally which resulted in RFC 3875.

==Drawbacks==

Calling a command generally means the invocation of a newly created [[computer process|process]].  Starting up the process can take up much more time and memory than the actual work of generating the output, especially when the program still needs to be [[interpret]]ed or [[compiler|compiled]].
If the command is called often, the resulting workload can quickly overwhelm the web server.

The [[computational overhead|overhead]] involved in interpretation may be reduced by using compiled CGI programs, such as those in [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]], rather than using [[Perl]] or other scripting languages.  The overhead involved in process creation can be reduced by solutions such as [[FastCGI]], or by running the application code entirely within the web server using extension modules such as [[mod_perl]].

===Alternatives===
Several approaches can be adopted for remedying this:

* The popular Web servers developed their own extension mechanisms that allows third-party software to run inside the web server itself, e.g. [[Apache modules]], Netscape [[Netscape Server Application Programming Interface|NSAPI]] [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s, [[Internet Information Services|IIS]] [[Internet Server Application Programming Interface|ISAPI]] plug-ins.
* [[Simple Common Gateway Interface]] or SCGI
* [[FastCGI]] allows a single, long-running process to handle more than one user request while keeping close to the CGI programming model, retaining the simplicity while eliminating the overhead of creating a new process for each request. Unlike converting an application to a web server plug-in, FastCGI applications remain independent of the web server.
* Replacement of the architecture for dynamic websites can also be used. This is the approach taken by solutions including [[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition]] (a.k.a. Java EE), which runs Java code in a Java servlet container in order to serve dynamic content and optionally static content. This approach replaces the overhead of generating and destroying processes with the much lower overhead of generating and destroying [[Thread (computer science)|threads]], and also exposes the programmer to the library that comes with [[Java Platform, Standard Edition]] that the version of Java EE in use is based on.

The optimal configuration for any web application depends on application-specific details, amount of traffic, and complexity of the transaction; these tradeoffs need to be analyzed to determine the best implementation for a given task and time budget.

The '''Choctaw''' (alternatively spelt as '''Chahta''', '''Chactas''', '''Chato''', '''Tchakta''', '''Chocktaw''', and '''Chactaw''') are a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people originally from the [[Southeastern United States]] ([[Mississippi]], [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], and [[Louisiana]]). The [[Choctaw language]] belongs to the [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean linguistic]] group.

&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the Choctaw were known as one of the &quot;[[Five Civilized Tribes]]&quot; because they adopted and integrated numerous cultural and technological practices of their [[European American]] colonial neighbors. The [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]] and the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]] are the two primary Choctaw associations today, although smaller Choctaw groups are located in Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas.

During the [[American Revolution]], most Choctaw supported the [[Thirteen Colonies]]' bid for independence from the [[British Empire|British Crown]]. The Choctaw and the United States agreed to nine treaties. The last three treaties (Treaty of Doak's Stand, Washington City, and Dancing Rabbit) were designed to [[Forced migration|deracinate]] most Choctaw west of the [[Mississippi River]].

[[Andrew Jackson|U.S. President Andrew Jackson]] made the Choctaw exile a model of [[Indian removal]] making them the first Native Americans to travel on the [[Trail of Tears]]. The Choctaw were exiled (to the area now called Oklahoma) because the U.S. desired to expand territory available for settlement to European Americans,&lt;ref name=Jackson_PBS&gt;

====Descent from the moundbuilders====
[[Image:Chromesun kincaid site 01.jpg|left|265px|thumb|Painting by Herb Roe depicting the Mississippian-culture [[Kincaid Site]] in Illinois, c.1300 CE.]]

Contemporary historian [[Patricia Galloway]] argues from fragmentary [[archaeological]] and cartographic evidence that the Choctaw did not exist as a unified people before the 17th century. Only then did various southeastern peoples, remnants of [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]], [[Plaquemine culture|Plaquemine]], and other [[Mississippian culture]]s, coalesce to form a self-consciously Choctaw people.&lt;ref name=GALLOWAY&gt;{{Cite book|authorlink=Patricia Galloway| last=Galloway|first=Patricia|title= Choctaw Genesis, 1500-1700 (Indians of the Southeast)|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|page=|isbn=0803270704|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The homeland of the Choctaw, or of the peoples from whom the Choctaw nation arose, included the area of ''[[Nanih Waiya]]'', an [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork mound]] in present-day [[Winston County, Mississippi]], which they considered [[sacred ground]]. Based on dating of surface artifacts, the mound was likely constructed and first occupied by [[indigenous peoples]] about 0-300 [[Common Era|CE]], in the [[Middle Woodland]] period. The original site was bounded on three sides by an earthwork circular enclosure, about ten feet high and encompassing a square mile. Occupation of ''Nanih Waiya'' and several smaller nearby mounds likely continued through 700 CE, the Late [[Woodland Period]]. The smaller mounds may also have been built by later cultures. As they have been lost to cultivation since the late 19th century and the area has not been excavated, theories have been speculation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/archeology/cg/vol1_num1/mother.htm Ken Carleton, &quot;Nanih Waiya: Mother Mound of the Choctaw&quot;], ''The Delta Endangered'', Spring 1996, Vol.1 (1), NPS Archeology Program, accessed 16 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

While the mound continued to be a ceremonial center and object of veneration, scholars do not believe it was occupied during the [[Mississippian culture]] period. From the 17th century on, the Choctaw revered this site as the center of their origin stories, which also included stories of migration to this site from west of the great river (believed to refer to the Mississippi River.)&lt;ref name=&quot;nps.gov&quot;&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/archeology/cg/vol1_num1/mother.htm Ken Carleton, &quot;Nanih Waiya: Mother Mound of the Choctaw&quot;], ''The Delta Endangered'', Spring 1996, Vol.1 (1), NPS Archeology Program, ''Common Ground'', accessed 16 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Histoire de La Louisiane'' (Paris, 1758), French explorer [[Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz]] recounted that &quot;...when I asked them from whence the Chat-kas [sic] came, to express the suddenness of their appearance they replied that they had come out from under the earth.&quot; American scholars took this account as intended to explain the Choctaws' immediate appearance, and not a literal creation account.

The Choctaw ancestors were likely part of the [[Mississippian culture]] in the [[Mississippi embayment|Mississippi river valley]]. They were preceded by other moundbuilding cultures, of which people of one of the earliest built ''Nanih Waiya''. Scholars believe the mound was contemporary with such earthworks as Igomar Mound in Mississippi and [[Pinson Mounds]] in [[Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nps.gov&quot;/&gt;

The Mississippian culture was a Native American culture that flourished in what is now the Midwestern, Eastern, and Southeastern United States from 800 to 1500 C.E. When the [[Spain|Spanish]] made their first forays inland in the 16th century from the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, they encountered some chiefdoms of the Mississippians, but others were already in decline, or had disappeared.&lt;ref name=north_ga&gt;

De Soto had the best-equipped militia at the time. His well-known successes attracted people to his expedition in a quest for untold riches in the New World. As the brutalities of the de Soto expedition became known, ancestors to the Choctaw rose in defense. This battle, known as the [[Chief Tuskaloosa#Battle of Mabila|Battle of ''Mabila'']], was a turning point for the de Soto venture. The battle &quot;broke the back&quot; of the campaign, and they never fully recovered.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

{{quote|Hernando de Soto, leading his well-equipped Spanish fortune hunters, made contact with the Choctaws in the year 1540.

In true conquistador style, he took as hostage a chief named Chief Tuskaloosa, demanding of him carriers and women. The carriers he got at once. The women, Tuscaloosa said, would be waiting in Mabila (Mobile). The chief neglected to mention that he had also summoned his warriors to be waiting in Mabila. On October 18, 1540, de Soto entered the town and received a gracious welcome. The Choctaws feasted with him, danced for him, then attacked him.

The archaeological record for this period between 1567 and 1699 is not complete or well-studied. It appears that some Mississippian settlements were abandoned well before the 17th century. Similarities in pottery coloring and burials suggest the following scenario for the emergence of the distinctive Choctaw society.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The Choctaw region, generally located between the [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] bluffs to the south and the [[Yazoo River|Yazoo]] basin to the north, was slowly occupied by Burial Urn people from the [[Bottle Creek Indian Mounds]] area in the [[Mobile, Alabama]] delta, along with remnants of the [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]] chiefdom that had collapsed some years before. Facing severe depopulation, they fled westward, where they combined with the [[Plaquemines]] and a group of “prairie people” living near the area. When this occurred is not clear. In the space of several generations, they created a new society which became known as Choctaw (albeit with a strong Mississippian background).{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

During the [[American Revolution]], Choctaws divided over whether to support Britain or Spain. Chief Franchimastabé led a Choctaw war party with British forces against American rebels in Natchez.

Early in 1811, ''[[Tecumseh]]'' attempted to recover lands from U.S. settlers. Tecumseh met the Choctaws to persuade them to join the alliance. ''[[Pushmataha]]'', considered by historians to be the greatest Choctaw leader, countered Tecumseh's influence. As chief for the Six Towns district, Pushmataha strongly resisted such a plan, arguing that the Choctaw and their neighbors the [[Chickasaw]] had always lived in peace with European-Americans, had learned valuable skills and technologies, and had received honest treatment and fair trade.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The joint Choctaw-Chickasaw council then voted against alliance with Tecumseh. On Tecumseh's departure, Pushmataha accused him of [[tyranny]] over his own [[Shawnee]] tribe and other tribes.

&lt;/ref&gt; Pushmataha arrived at [[St. Stephens, Alabama]] in mid-1813 with an offer of alliance and recruitment. He was escorted to [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] to speak with General Flournoy, then commanding the district. Flournoy initially declined Pushmataha's offer, offending the chief. However, Flournoy's staff quickly convinced him to reverse his decision. A courier with a message accepting the offer of alliance caught up with Pushmataha at St. Stephens.&lt;ref name=lossing&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After observing that the officers and their wives would promenade along the [[Alabama River]], Pushmataha summoned his own wife to St. Stephens.

&lt;/ref&gt; With this victory, Choctaws began to volunteer in greater numbers from the other two districts of the tribe. By February 1814, a larger band of Choctaws under Pushmataha had joined General [[Andrew Jackson]]'s force for the sweeping of the Creek territories near [[Pensacola, Florida]]. Many Choctaws departed from Jackson's main force after the final defeat of the Creek at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]]. By the [[Battle of New Orleans]], only a few Choctaws remained with the army; however, they were the only Native American tribe represented in the battle.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The convention began on October 10 with a talk by &quot;Sharp Knife&quot;, the nickname of Jackson, to more than 500 Choctaws.

There are but few beavers, and the honey and fruit are rare things.&quot; Jackson resorted to threats, which pressured the Choctaws to sign the Doak's Stand treaty.

On September 27, 1830, the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] was signed.

By the treaty, the Choctaws signed away their remaining traditional homelands, opening them up for European-American settlement.

In the 1840s, the Choctaw chief [[Greenwood LeFlore]] stayed in Mississippi after the signing of Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek and became an American citizen, a successful businessman, and a state politician. He was a [[Mississippi]] representative and [[Mississippi Senate|senator]], a fixture of Mississippi high society, and a personal friend of [[Jefferson Davis]]. He represented his county in the house for two terms and served as a senator for one term. Some of the elite used [[Latin language]], an indulgence used by some politicians. LeFlore, in defense of his heritage, spoke in the [[Choctaw language]] and asked the Senate floor which was better understood, Latin or Choctaw.&lt;ref&gt;Kidwell (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Midway through the [[Great Irish Famine|Great Irish Famine (1845&amp;ndash;1849)]], a group of Choctaws collected $710 (although many articles say the original amount was $170 after a misprint in Angi Debo's ''The Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Nation'') and sent it to help starving Irish men, women and children. &quot;It had been just 16 years since the Choctaw people had experienced the Trail of Tears, and they had faced starvation ... It was an amazing gesture. By today's standards, it might be a million dollars&quot; according to Judy Allen, editor of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma's newspaper, ''Bishinik'', based at the Oklahoma Choctaw tribal headquarters in Durant, Oklahoma. To mark the 150th anniversary, eight Irish people retraced the Trail of Tears &lt;ref name=&quot;famine&quot; /&gt; In the late 20th century, Irish President [[Mary Robinson]] extolled the donation in a public commemoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/michael/www/choctaw/robinson.html|title=President of Ireland Mary Robinson Addresses the Choctaw People|accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], [[Albert Pike]] was appointed as Confederate envoy to Native Americans. In this capacity he negotiated several treaties, including the [[Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws]] in July 1861. The treaty covered sixty-four terms, covering many subjects like Choctaw and Chickasaw nation sovereignty, [[Confederate States of America]] citizenship possibilities, and a entitled delegate in the House of Representatives of the Confederate States of America.&lt;ref name=choctaw_ok_statehood&gt;

Some Choctaws identified with the Southern cause and a few owned slaves. In addition, they well remembered and resented the Indian removals from thirty years earlier and poor service they received from the federal government. The main reason the Choctaw Nation agreed to sign the treaty, however, was for protection from regional tribes.

[[New Orleans]] at that time was in the hands of the Federal Gen. [[B.F. Butler]]. Without notice a reconnoitering party of the enemy raided the camp, and captured over two dozen Indians and several noncommissioned white officers and carried them to New Orleans. All the officers and several of the Indians escaped and returned to the Newton County camp; but all the balance of the captured Indians were carried to New York, and were daily paraded in the public parks as curiosities for the sport of sight-seers.&lt;ref name=choctaw_confederate /&gt;

From about 1865 to 1918, Mississippi Choctaws were largely ignored by governmental, health, and educational services and fell into obscurity.  In the aftermath of the Civil War, their issues were pushed aside in the struggle between defeated Confederates, freedmen and Union sympathizers.  Records about the Mississippi Choctaw during this period are non-existent. They had no legal recourse, and were often bullied and intimidated by local whites.&lt;ref name=howard_and_Levine&gt;

Following Reconstruction and conservative Democrats' regaining power in the late 1870s, white state legislators passed laws establishing [[Jim Crow laws]] and legal segregation by race.

At the turn of the 20th century, only 1,253 Choctaw Indians remained in Mississippi. &quot;The beginning of the 20th century found Mississippi Choctaws struggling to overcome poverty, discrimination, and lack of opportunity.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/choctaw_hert.html Deborah Boykin, &quot;choctaw Heritage of Louisiana and Mississippi&quot;], Louisiana Folklife Program, 2000, accessed 25 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

After a US Congressional investigation discovered their poor living conditions, in 1918 the US [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) established the Choctaw Agency. Under [[Racial segregation|segregation]], few schools were open to Choctaw children, who were included with other non-whites. The Choctaw agency was based in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], a center of several Indian communities. It set up elementary schools and worked to address the poor health conditions of the Choctaw, building a hospital in Philadelphia for tribal members.&lt;ref name=&quot;mshistory.k12.ms.us&quot;&gt;[http://mshistory.k12.ms.us/articles/10/choctaw-indians-in-the-21st-century  Deborah Boykin, &quot;Choctaw Indians in the 21st Century&quot;], Mississippi History Now, accessed 25 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Frank McKinley was the first superintendent. Prior to McKinley's arrival, the Choctaws had grouped themselves in six communities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Because the state remained dependent on agriculture, despite the declining price of cotton, most landless men earned a living by becoming [[sharecroppers]]. The women created and sold traditional hand-woven baskets. Choctaw sharecropping declined in the 1950s after farming mechanization had become more prevalent.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

&lt;/ref&gt; In post-war treaties, the US government also acquired land in the western part of the territory and access rights for railroads to be built across Indian Territory. Choctaw chief Allen Wright suggested ''Oklahoma'' (red man, a portmanteau of the choctaw words okla &quot;man&quot; and humma &quot;red&quot;) as the name of the newly ceded territory. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The improved transportation afforded by the railroads drew large-scale mining and timber operations. These added to tribal receipts. The railroads and industries also attracted European-American settlers, including new immigrants to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kidwell 2007&quot;&gt;Kidwell (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing the struggle over land and assimilation, the US proposed the end to the tribal lands held in common, and allotment of lands to tribal members in [[severalty]] (individually). This would also enable new settlers to buy land from those Native Americans who wished to sell. The US government set up the [[Dawes Commission]] to manage the land allotment policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kidwell 2007&quot;/&gt;

Beginning in 1894, the Dawes Commission was established to register Choctaw and other families of the Indian Territory, so that the former tribal lands could be properly distributed among them. The final list included 18,981 citizens of the Choctaw Nation, 1,639 Mississippi Choctaw, and 5,994 former slaves, most held by Choctaws in the Indian/Oklahoma Territory. (At the same time, the Dawes Commission registered members of the other Five Civilized Tribes.) Following completion of the land allotments, the US proposed to end tribal governments of the Five Civilized Tribes and admit the territories as a state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kidwell 2007&quot; /&gt;

====Territory transition to Oklahoma statehood (1889)====
{{See|Indian Territory|Oklahoma Territory}}

[[Image:Choctaw Senate.jpg|left|275px|thumb|Choctaw Nation senate in 1898. Oklahoma Historical Society.]]

The establishment of Oklahoma Territory following the Civil War was a required land cession by the Five Civilized Tribes, who had supported the Confederacy. The government used its railroad access to the Oklahoma Territory to stimulate development there. The Indian Appropriations Bill of 1889 included an amendment by Illinois Representative [[William McKendree Springer]], that authorized President [[Benjamin Harrison]] to open the two million acres (8,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of Oklahoma Territory for settlement, resulting in the [[Land Run of 1889]]. The Choctaw Nation was overwhelmed with new settlers and could not regulate their activities. In the late 19th century Choctaws suffered almost daily from violent crimes, murders, thefts and assaults from whites and from other Choctaws. Intense factionalism divided the traditionalistic &quot;Nationalists&quot; and pro-assimilation &quot;Progressives,&quot; who fought for control.&lt;ref&gt;Devon Abbott Mihesuah, ''Choctaw Crime and Punishment, 1884-1907'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the Five Civilized Tribes met at the [[Sequoyah Convention]] to counter proposed dissolution of their governments by creating an alternate [[State of Sequoyah]]. Although they took a thoroughly developed proposal to Washington, DC, seeking approval, there was political opposition from eastern states' representatives. President Theodore Roosevelt ruled that the Oklahoma and Indian territories would be merged to be admitted as one state, Oklahoma. Nonetheless, many of the Native American representatives from the Sequoyah Convention participated in the new state convention. Its constitution was based on many elements of the one developed for the State of Sequoyah.&lt;ref name=choctaw_ok_statehood /&gt;

In 1906 the U.S. dissolved the governments of the Five Civilized Tribes in an attempt to assimilate the tribes as citizens of the United States. This action was part of continuing negotiations by Native Americans and European Americans over the best proposals for the future. The Choctaw Nation continued to protect resources not stipulated in treaty or law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kidwell 2007&quot;/&gt; On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was admitted to the union as the 46th state.

===World War I (1918)===
[[Image:ChoctawCoders.jpg|right|thumb|Choctaws in training in World War I for coded radio &amp; telephone transmissions.]]

In the closing days of [[World War I]], a group of Choctaws serving in the [[U.S. Army]] used their native language as the basis for secret communication among Americans, as Germans could not understand it. They are now called the [[Choctaw Code Talkers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ctalk&quot;&gt;

14 Choctaw Indian men in the Army's 36th Division trained to use their language for military communications. Their communications, which could not be understood by Germans, helped the [[American Expeditionary Force]] win several key battles in the [[Meuse-Argonne Campaign]] in [[France]], during the last big German offensive of the war. Within 24 hours after the US Army starting using their Choctaw speakers, the tide of the battle had turned. In less than 72 hours the Germans were retreating and the Allies were on full attack.&lt;ref name=choctaw_code /&gt; The 14 Choctaw Code Talkers were Albert Billy, Mitchell Bobb, Victor Brown, Ben Caterby, James Edwards, Tobias Frazer, Ben Hampton, Solomon Louis, Pete Maytubby, Jeff Nelson, Joseph Oklahombi, Robert Taylor, Calvin Wilson, and Walter Veach.&lt;ref name=choctaw_code&gt;

More than 70 years passed before the contributions of the Choctaw Code talkers were fully recognized. On November 3, 1989, in recognition of the important role the Choctaw Code Talkers played during World War I, the French government presented the ''Chevalier de L'Ordre National du Mérite'' (the Knight of the National Order of Merit) to the Choctaws Code Talkers. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Reorganization (1934)===

During the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt Administration]], officials began numerous initiatives to alleviate some of the social and economic conditions in the South. The 1933 ''Special Narrative Report'' described the dismal state of welfare of Mississippi Choctaws, whose population by 1930 had declined to 1,665 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;john_swanton&quot;/&gt; [[John Collier]], the US Commissioner for Indian Affairs (now BIA), used the report as instrumental support in a proposal to re-organize the Mississippi Choctaw as the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]]. This enabled them to establish their own tribal government, as well as to have a beneficial relationship with the federal government.

In 1934, President Franklin Roosevelt signed into law the [[Indian Reorganization Act of 1934|Indian Reorganization Act]]. This law proved critical for survival of the Mississippi Choctaw. Baxter York, Emmett York, and Joe Chitto worked on gaining recognition for the Choctaw.&lt;ref name=brescia_era&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; They realized that the only way to gain recognition was to adopt a constitution.&lt;ref name=brescia_era /&gt; A rival organization, the Mississippi Choctaw Indian Federation, opposed tribal recognition because of fears of dominance by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA). They disbanded after leaders of the opposition were moved to another jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=brescia_era /&gt; The first Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians tribal council members were Baxter and Emmett York with Joe Chitto as the first chairperson.&lt;ref name=brescia_era /&gt;

With the tribe's adoption of government, in 1944 the Secretary of the Interior declared that {{convert|18000|acre|km2}} would be held in trust for the Choctaw of Mississippi. Lands in [[Neshoba County, Mississippi|Neshoba]] and surrounding counties were set aside as a federal [[Indian reservation]]. Eight communities were included in the reservation land: [[Bogue Chitto, Mississippi|Bogue Chitto]], Bogue Homa, [[Conehatta, Mississippi|Conehatta]], Crystal Ridge, [[Pearl River, Mississippi|Pearl River]], [[Red Water, Mississippi|Red Water]], [[Tucker, Mississippi|Tucker]], and [[Standing Pine, Mississippi|Standing Pine]].

Under the Indian Reorganization Act, the Mississippi Choctaws re-organized on April 20, 1945 as the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. This gave them some independence from the state government, which continued with its system of racial segregation under the Democratic Party.

===World War II (1941)===
{{See|Native Americans and World War II}}

[[World War II]] was a significant turning point for Choctaws and Native Americans in general. Although the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] stated Mississippi Choctaws had U.S. citizenship, they had become associated with &quot;colored people&quot; as non-white in a state that had imposed racial segregation under [[Jim Crow laws]]. State services for Native Americans were non-existent. The state was poor and still dependent on agriculture. In its system of segregation, services for minorities were consistently underfunded. The state constitution and voter registration rules dating from the turn of the 20th century kept most Native Americans from voting, serving on juries or being eligible for any local offices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen Edward Cresswell 2006, p.124&quot;/&gt;

A Mississippi Choctaw veteran stated, &quot;Indians were not supposed to go in the military back then ... the military was mainly for whites. My category was white instead of Indian. I don't know why they did that. Even though Indians weren't citizens of this country, couldn't register to vote, didn't have a draft card or anything, they took us anyway.&quot;&lt;ref name=choctaw_world_war_2&gt;

After World War II, pressure in Congress mounted to reduce Washington's authority on Native American lands and liquidate the government's responsibilities to them. In 1953 the House of Representatives passed Resolution 108, proposing an end to federal services for 13 tribes deemed ready to handle their own affairs. The same year, Public Law 280 transferred jurisdiction over tribal lands to state and local governments in five states. Within a decade Congress terminated federal services to more than sixty groups despite intense opposition by Indians. Congress settled on a policy to [[Indian termination policy|terminate]] tribes as quickly as possible. Out of concern for the isolation of many Native Americans in rural areas, the federal government created relocation programs to cities to try to expand their employment opportunities. Indian policy experts hoped to expedite assimilation of Native Americans to the larger American society, which was becoming urban.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kidwell 2007&quot;/&gt;

President [[John F. Kennedy]] halted further termination in 1961 and decided against implementing additional terminations. He did enact some of the last terminations in process, such as with the [[Ponca]]. Both presidents [[Lyndon Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]] repudiated termination of the federal government's relationship with Native American tribes. In 1959, the Choctaw Termination Act was passed.&lt;ref name=indian_termination&gt;{{Cite web

The Choctaw people continued to struggle economically due to bigotry, cultural isolation, and lack of jobs. The Choctaws, who for 150 years had been neither white nor black, were &quot;left where they had always been&quot;-- in poverty.&lt;ref name=campbell /&gt; [[Will Campbell]], a Baptist minister and Civil Rights activist, witnessed the destitution of the Choctaw. He would later write, &quot;the thing I remember the most ... was the depressing sight of the Choctaws, their shanties along the country roads, grown men lounging on the dirt streets of their villages in demeaning idleness, sometimes drinking from a common bottle, sharing a roll-your-own cigarette, their half-clad children a picture of hurting that would never end.&quot;&lt;ref name=campbell /&gt; With reorganization and establishment of tribal government, however, over the next decades they took control of &quot;schools, health care facilities, legal and judicial systems, and social service programs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/choctaw_hert.html Deborah Boykin, &quot;Choctaw Heritage of Louisiana and Mississippi&quot;], Louisiana Folklife Program, 2000, accessed 26 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Choctaws witnessed the social forces that brought [[Freedom Summer]] and it after effects to their ancient homeland. The Civil Rights Era produced significant social change for the Choctaws in Mississippi, as their civil rights were also enhanced. Prior to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], most jobs were given to whites, then blacks.&lt;ref name=campbell /&gt; [[Donna Ladd]] wrote that a Choctaw, now in her 40s, remembers &quot;as a little girl, she thought that a 'white only' sign in a local store meant she could only order white, or vanilla, ice cream.

The recommendations of this administration represent an historic step forward in Indian policy.

Soon after this, Congress passed the landmark [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975]], completing a 15-year period of federal policy reform with regard to American Indian tribes. The legislation included means by which tribes could negotiate contracts with the BIA to manage more of their own education and social service programs. In addition, it provided direct grants to help tribes develop plans for assuming responsibility. It also provided for Indian parents' involvement on school boards.&lt;ref name=&quot;William C.

Beginning in 1979 the tribal council worked on a variety of economic development initiatives, first geared toward attracting industry to the reservation. They had many people available to work, natural resources and no taxes. Industries have included automotive parts, greeting cards, direct mail and printing, and plastic-molding. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians is one of the state's largest employers, running 19 businesses and employing 7,800 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;mshistory.k12.ms.us&quot;/&gt;

Starting with New Hampshire in 1963, numerous state governments began to operate lotteries and other gambling to raise money for government services. In 1987 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that [[federally recognized tribes]] could operate gaming facilities on reservation land free from state regulation. In 1988 the U.S. Congress enacted the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] (IGRA). It set the terms for Native American tribes to operate [[casino]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;William C. Canby pp. 23-33&quot;/&gt;

After years of waiting under the [[Ray Mabus]] administration, Mississippi Governor [[Kirk Fordice]] in 1992 gave permission for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians to develop Class III gaming. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians (MBCI) has one of the largest casino resorts in the nation; it is located in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]]. The Silver Star Casino opened its doors in 1994. The Golden Moon Casino opened in 2002. The casinos are collectively known as the [[Pearl River Resort]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]] has its own gaming operations: the [[Choctaw Casino Resort]] and [[Choctaw Casino Bingo]], popular gaming destinations in [[Durant, Oklahoma|Durant]]. Near the Oklahoma-Texas border, they serve residents of Southern Oklahoma and North Texas. The largest regional population base from which they draw is the [[Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

After nearly two hundred years, the Choctaw have retaken control of the ancient site of [[Nanih Waiya]]. For years protected as a Mississippi state park, ''Nanih Waiya'' was returned to the Choctaw in 2006, under Mississippi Legislature State Bill 2803.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Jack Abramoff's Introduction to Indian lobbying===

{{See|Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal}}

[[Image:Abramoff SIAC 20040929 2.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Video capture from video of Senate Indian Affairs Committee Hearing on 'Lobbying Practices Involving Indian Tribes' on September 29, 2004 as found at indian.senate.gov]]

In the second half of the 1990s, Abramoff was employed by Preston Gates Ellis &amp; Rouvelas Meeds LLP, the lobbying arm of [[Preston Gates &amp; Ellis]] LLP law firm based in Seattle, WA. In 1995, Abramoff began representing Native American tribes with gambling interests, starting with the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]]. 

The Choctaw originally had lobbied the federal government directly, but beginning in 1994, they found that many of the congressional members who were respondent to their issues had either retired or were defeated in the &quot;[[Republican Revolution]]&quot; of the [[United States House elections, 1994|1994 elections]]. Nell Rogers, the tribe's specialist on legislative affairs, had a friend who was familiar with Abramoff's father and Abramoff's work as a Republican activist. The tribe contacted Preston Gates, and soon after hired the firm and Abramoff.

One of Abramoff's first acts was to defeat a Congressional bill, that sought to use the unrelated business income tax (UBIT) to tax Native American casinos, sponsored by Reps. [[William Reynolds Archer, Jr.|Bill Archer]] (R-TX) and [[Ernest Istook]] (R-OK). Since the matter involved taxation, Abramoff enlisted help from his College Republican acquaintance [[Grover Norquist]], and his [[Americans for Tax Reform]] (ATR). The bill was eventually defeated in 1996 in the Senate, due in part to grassroots work by ATR, for which the Choctaw paid $60,000.

According to ''Washington Business Forward'', a lobbying trade magazine, &quot;[[Tom DeLay|&lt;nowiki&gt;[Tom DeLay]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] was a major factor in those victories, and the fight helped cement the alliance between the two men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizforward.com/wdc/issues/2002-11/government/abramoff/ www.bizforward.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Purporting to represent Native Americans before Congress and state governments in this new field, [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal|Jack Abramoff]] and [[Michael Scanlon]] used fraudulent means to gain profits of $15 million in payment from the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. Congressional hearings were held and charges were brought against Abramoff and Scanlon.&lt;ref name=gimme_five&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 3, 2006, Abramoff pled guilty to three felony counts &amp;mdash; conspiracy, fraud, and tax evasion &amp;mdash; involving charges stemming principally from his lobbying activities in Washington on behalf of Native American tribes. In addition, Abramoff and other defendants must make restitution of at least $25 million that was defrauded from clients, most notably the Native American tribes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5081540 NPR&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See|MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians}}

For generations Choctaw Indians lived in Mobile and Washington Counties in southwestern Alabama.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} These Indians traced their lineage to two groups of Choctaw that settled the area in the early 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The first group had been allies of the Red Sticks during the Creek War of 1813-14 and hid in the remote swamps after their defeat.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The second group arrived in the 1830s, when they hid rather than be removed to the western Indian Territories.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} These two groups merged and lived in relative isolation from white contact for several decades.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Over the years, the MOWA (for Mobile and Washington) faced discrimination, persecution, and debt peonage because of their racial status, which in the eyes of the federal government was undocumented and ambiguous.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Despite achieving official recognition as a Native American tribe by the state of Alabama, the MOWA Choctaw were still fighting for federal recognition in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Anderson Matte, &quot;Extinction by Reclassification: the MOWA Choctaws of South Alabama and Their Struggle for Federal Recognition,&quot; ''Alabama Review'' 2006 59(3): 163-204,&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

[[Image:Tullockchishko.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Tullockchishko'', Drinks the Juice of the Stones, was the greatest of all Choctaw stickball players, 1834.]]

After the fall of the Mississippian Culture, Choctaw culture would be established and greatly evolve over the centuries, combining mostly [[European-American]] influences; however, interaction with [[Spain]], [[France]], and [[England]] greatly shaped it as well. They were known for their rapid incorporation of modernity, developing a written language, transitioning to [[yeoman]] farming methods, and accepting [[European-American]]s and [[African-American]]s into their society. The Choctaw also practiced [[Head Flattening]], but the practice eventually fell out of favor. In mid-summer the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians celebrate their culture during the [[Choctaw Indian Fair]] with ball games, dancing, cooking and entertainment.&lt;ref name=choctawFairSummer&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clans===
Within the Choctaws were two distinct Moieties: Imoklashas (elders) and Inhulalatas (youth). Each moiety had several clans or Iskas, it is estimated there were about 12 Iskas altogether. Identity was established first by Moiety and Iska, so a Choctaw identified himself first as Imoklasha or Inhulata and second as Choctaw. Children belonged to the Iska of their mother meaning they are [[matrilineal]]. The following were some major districts:&lt;ref name=choctawClansJen&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; When disputes arose between Choctaw communities, stickball provided a civil way to settle issues. The stickball games would involve as few as twenty or as many as 300 players. The goal posts could be from a few hundred feet apart to a few miles. Goal posts were sometimes located within each opposing team's village. A Jesuit priest referenced stickball in 1729, and George Catlin painted the subject. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians continue to practice the sport.

[[Chunkey]] was a game that consisted of a stone-shaped disk that was about 1&amp;ndash;2&amp;nbsp;inches in length.&lt;ref name=john_swanton_chunkey&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The disk was thrown down a {{convert|200|ft|m|sing=on}} corridor so that it could roll past the players at great speed. As the disk rolled down the corridor, players would throw wooden shafts at it. The object of the game was to strike the disk or prevent your opponents from hitting it.&lt;ref name=john_swanton_chunkey /&gt;

Other games included corn, cane, and moccasin games.&lt;ref name=john_swanton_games&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The corn game included five to seven kernels of corn. One side was blackened and the other side white. Points were assigned for each color. One point was awarded for the black side and 5-7 points for the white side. There were usually only two players.&lt;ref name=john_swanton_games /&gt;

===Language===
{{Main|Choctaw language}}

The Choctaw language is a member of the [[Muskogean]] family and was well known among the frontiersmen, such as U.S. President Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison, of the early 19th century. The language is closely related to [[Chickasaw]], and some linguists consider the two dialects a single language. The Choctaw language is the essence of tribal culture, tradition, and identity.&lt;ref name=living_tradition&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Many Choctaw adults learned to speak the language before speaking English. The language is a part of daily life on the Mississippi Choctaw reservation. The following table is an example of Choctaw text and its translation:

===Religion===
{{Main|Choctaw mythology}}

The Choctaws believed in a good spirit and an evil spirit. They may have been sun, or ''Hushtahli'', worshippers. The historian Swanton wrote, &quot;[T]he Choctaws anciently regarded the sun as a deity ... the sun was ascribed the power of life and death. He was represented as looking down upon the earth, and as long as he kept his flaming eye fixed on any one, the person was safe ... fire, as the most striking representation of the sun, was considered as possessing intelligence, and as acting in concert with the sun ... [having] constant intercourse with the sun ...&quot;&lt;ref name=john_swanton /&gt; The word ''nanpisa'' (the one who sees) expressed the reverence the Choctaw had for the sun.&lt;ref name=john_swanton_religion&gt;

{{quote|Anthropologist theorize that the Mississippian ancestors of the Choctaw placed the sun at the center of their cosmological system. Mid-eighteenth-century Choctaws did view the sun as a being endowed with life.  Choctaw diplomats, for example, spoke only on sunny days.  If the day of a conference were cloudy or rainy, Choctaws delayed the meeting, usually on the pretext that they needed more time to discuss particulars, until the sun returned.  The sun made sure that all talks were honest.

[[Image:Choctaw group.png|255px|right|thumb|Mississippi Choctaw group wearing traditional garb, c. 1908.]]

Prayers may have been introduced by missionaries; however, Choctaw prophets were known to have addressed the sun. Swanton wrote, &quot;an old Choctaw informed Wright that before the arrival of the missionaries, they had no conception of prayer. However, he adds, 'I have indeed heard it asserted by some, that anciently their hopaii, or prophets, on some occasions were accustomed to address the sun ...'&quot;&lt;ref name=john_swanton /&gt;

===Traditional clothing===
The colorful dresses worn by today's Choctaw are made by hand and adapted from the 19th century European-American designs. Choctaws today wear Choctaw clothing mainly for special events. Choctaw elders, especially the Choctaw women, dress in their traditional garb every day. Choctaw dresses are trimmed by full diamond, half diamond or circle and crosses that represent stickball sticks.&lt;ref name=choctaw_dress&gt;

Land was the most valuable asset, which the Native Americans held in collective stewardship. The United States systematically obtained Choctaw land for conventional European-American settlement through treaties, legislation, and threats of warfare. Although the Choctaw made treaties with Great Britain, France, Spain, and the Confederate States of America; the nation signed only nine treaties with the United States.&lt;ref name=treaties&gt;

==Influential leaders==
{{See|List of Choctaw chiefs}}
*[[Chief Tuscaloosa|Tuscaloosa]] (?-d. October 1540) retaliated against Hernando de Soto at the Battle of Mabilia. The battle was the first major conflict in North America between Native Americans and Europeans.
*[[Franchimastabe]] (d. 19th c.) was a transitional benefactor and a contemporary of Taboca. To some Americans he was the &quot;leading chief of the Choctaws.&quot; He led a war party with British forces against American rebels.
*[[Taboca]] (d. 19th c.) was a traditional &quot;prophet-chief&quot; who led a delegation starting in October 1785 to Hopewell, South Carolina.
*[[Apuckshunubbee]] (ca. 1740–1824) was chief of the Okla Falaya (Tall People) district in old Choctaw nation. He died in Kentucky on his way to Washington D.C. to conduct negotiations.
*[[Pushmataha]] (Apushmataha) (1760s–December 24, 1824) was a chief in old Choctaw nation. He negotiated treaties with the United States and fought on the American's side in the War of 1812. He died in Washington D.C. and is buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington D.C.
*[[Mosholatubbee]] (1770–1836) was a chief in the Choctaw nation before the removal and after. He went to Washington D.C. to negotiate for the tribe in 1824 and was the only major leader to return. In the summer of 1830, he ran for a seat in the Congress of the United States to represent the state of Mississippi.
*[[Greenwood LeFlore]] (June 3, 1800–August 31, 1865) was a District Chief of the Choctaws in Mississippi. He was an influential state representative and senator in Mississippi.

*[[Peter Pitchlynn]] (January 30, 1806–January 17, 1881) was a highly influential leader during the removal era and long after. He represented the Choctaws in Washington D.C. for some years and is buried in the Congressional Cemetery. [[Charles Dickens]] described him &quot;as stately and complete a gentleman of nature's making as ever I beheld.&quot;
*[[Phillip Martin]] (March 13, 1926–February 4, 2010) was the Chief of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians from 1979–2007 and worked in tribal government for over fifty years. He encouraged outside investment and reduced unemployment to nearly 0% on the reservation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[chemical physics]] and [[physical chemistry]], '''chemical affinity''' is the electronic property by which dissimilar [[chemical species]] are capable of forming [[chemical compounds]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Chemical_affinity Chemical Affinity] - Britannica 1911&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemical affinity can also refer to the tendency of an [[atom]] or compound to combine by [[chemical reaction]] with atoms or compounds of unlike composition.  

According to chemistry historian Henry Leicester, the influential 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Reactions'' by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Merle Randall]] led to the replacement of the term &quot;affinity&quot; by the term &quot;[[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]&quot; in much of the English-speaking world.

==Modern conceptions==
In modern terms, we relate affinity to the phenomenon whereby certain atoms or molecules have the tendency to aggregate or bond.  For example, in the 1919 book ''Chemistry of Human Life'' physician George W. Carey states that, &quot;Health depends on a proper amount of iron phosphate Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the blood, for the molecules of this salt have chemical affinity for oxygen and carry it to all parts of the organism.&quot; In this antiquated context, chemical affinity is sometimes found synonymous with the term &quot;magnetic attraction&quot;.  Many writings, up until about 1925, also refer to a &quot;law of chemical affinity&quot;.

[[Ilya Prigogine]] summarized the concept of affinity, saying,
{{cquote|All chemical reactions drive the system to a state of [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] in which the ''affinities'' of the reactions vanish.}}

==Thermodynamics==
In 1923, the Belgian mathematician and physicist [[Théophile de Donder]] derived a relation between affinity ''A'' and the [[Gibbs free energy]] ''G'' of a [[chemical reaction]].  Through a series of derivations, de Donder showed that if we consider a mixture of [[chemical species]] with the possibility of chemical reaction, it can be proven that the following relation holds:

:&lt;math&gt; A = -\Delta_rG \,&lt;/math&gt;   

With the writings of [[Théophile de Donder]] as precedent, [[Ilya Prigogine]] and Defay in ''Chemical Thermodynamics'' (1954) defined chemical affinity (denoted by ''A'') as a function of the increments in uncompensated heat of reaction and reaction progress variable (denoted by ''dQ''' and ''dξ'', respectively):

:&lt;math&gt;A  = \frac{dQ'}{d \xi}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

This definition is useful for quantifying the factors responsible both for the state of equilibrium systems (where {{nowrap|1=''A'' = 0}}), and for changes of state of non-equilibrium systems (where {{nowrap|1=''A'' ≠ 0''}}).

The present [[IUPAC]] definition is that affinity is the negative partial derivative of Gibbs energy with respect to extent of reaction at constant pressure and temperature.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.IUPAC.org IUPAC Green Book and Gold Book in .pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; That is,
:&lt;math&gt;A = -\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial \xi}\right)_{P,T}.&lt;/math&gt;
It follows that affinity is positive for spontaneous reactions.

== History ==
&quot;Chemical affinity&quot;, historically, refers to the &quot;[[electromagnetic force|force]]&quot; that causes [[chemical reaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]]. (1831). ''A System of Chemistry'', vol. 1. p.31 (chemical affinity is described as an &quot;unknown force&quot;). 7th ed., 2 vols.&lt;/ref&gt;  A broad definition, used generally throughout history, is that chemical affinity is that whereby substances enter into or resist decomposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levere&quot; &gt;{{cite book | last = Levere | first = Trevor, H. | title = Affinity and Matter – Elements of Chemical Philosophy 1800-1865 | publisher = Gordon and Breach Science Publishers | year = 1971 | isbn = 2881245838}}&lt;/ref&gt; .
 
The term ''affinity'' has been used figuratively since c. 1600 in discussions of structural relationships in chemistry, [[philology]], etc., and reference to &quot;natural attraction&quot; is from 1616. 

The idea of ''affinity'' is extremely old.  Many attempts have been made at identifying its origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levere&quot; /&gt;  The majority of such attempts, however, except in a general manner, end in futility since &quot;affinities&quot; lie at the basis of all [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], thereby pre-dating [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;Malthauf, R. P. (1966). The Origins of Chemistry. Pg. 299. London.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Physical chemistry]], however, was one of the first branches of science to study and formulate a &quot;theory of affinity&quot;.  The name ''affinitas'' was first used in the sense of chemical relation by German philosopher [[Albertus Magnus]] near the year 1250.  Later, those as [[Robert Boyle]], [[John Mayow]], [[Johann Glauber]], [[Isaac Newton]], and [[Georg Stahl]] put forward ideas on elective affinity in attempts to explain how [[heat]] is evolved during [[combustion reactions]].&lt;ref&gt;Partington, J.R. (1937). ''A Short History of Chemistry.'' New York: Dover Publications, Inc. ISBN 0-486-65977-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern term chemical affinity is a somewhat modified variation of its eighteenth-century precursor &quot;elective affinity&quot; or elective attractions, a coinage of the Swedish chemist [[Torbern Olof Bergman]] from his book ''De attractionibus electivis'' (1775).  [[Antoine Lavoisier]], in his famed 1789 ''[[Traité Élémentaire de Chimie]] (Elements of Chemistry)'', refers to Bergmann’s work and discusses the concept of elective affinities or attractions.  

[[Goethe]] used the concept in his novel [[Elective Affinities]], (1809)

===Geoffroy's 1718 affinity table===
The first-ever ''affinity table'', which was based on [[displacement reaction]]s, was published in 1718 by the French chemist [[Étienne François Geoffroy]].  Geoffroy's name is best known in connection with these tables of &quot;affinities&quot; (''tables des rapports''), which were first presented to the [[French Academy]] in 1718 and 1720, as shown below: 

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Affinity-table.jpg|500px|center|thumb|Geoffroy's '''Affinity Table''' (1718): At the head of the column is a substance with which all the substances below can combine, where each column below the header is ranked by degrees of &quot;'''affinity'''&quot;. ]]
&lt;/center&gt;

These were lists, prepared by collating observations on the actions of substances one upon another, showing the varying degrees of affinity exhibited by analogous bodies for different [[reagent]]s, and they retained their vogue for the rest of the century, until displaced by the profounder conceptions introduced by [[Claude Louis Berthollet|Claude Berthollet]].

'''Comet Hale–Bopp''' ([[Astronomical naming conventions#Comets|formally designated]] '''C/1995&amp;nbsp;O1''') was arguably the most widely observed [[comet]] of the 20th century, and one of the brightest seen for many [[decade]]s. It was visible to the [[naked eye]] for a record 18&amp;nbsp;months, twice as long as the previous record holder, the [[Great Comet of 1811]].

Hale–Bopp was discovered on July 23, 1995, at a great distance from the [[Sun]], raising expectations that the comet would brighten considerably by the time it passed close to Earth. Although predicting the brightness of comets with any degree of accuracy is very difficult, Hale–Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed [[perihelion]] on April 1, 1997. The comet was dubbed the [[Great comet|Great Comet]] of 1997.

== Discovery ==
The comet was discovered in 1995 by two independent observers, [[Alan Hale (astronomer)|Alan Hale]] and [[Thomas Bopp]], both in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The comets of 1995 | last = Shanklin |first = Jonathan D. | journal = Journal of the British Astronomical Association | year= 2000 | volume =110 |issue = 6 |pages= 311 |bibcode = 2000JBAA..110..311S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hale had spent many hundreds of hours searching for comets without success, and was tracking known comets from his driveway in [[New Mexico]] when he chanced upon Hale–Bopp just after midnight. The comet had an [[apparent magnitude]] of 10.5 and lay near the [[globular cluster]] [[Globular Cluster M70|M70]] in the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Circ6187&quot; /&gt; Hale first established that there was no other [[deep-sky object]] near M70, and then consulted a directory of known comets, finding that none were known to be in this area of the sky. Once he had established that the object was moving relative to the background stars, he [[email]]ed the [[Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams]], the clearing house for astronomical discoveries.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeDiscovery&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Comet of the decade Part II| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986055,00.html | work = Time | date=March 17, 1997 | first = Michael D. | last = Lemonick | accessdate=2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bopp did not own a [[telescope]]. He was out with friends near [[Stanfield, Arizona]] observing star clusters and [[galaxy|galaxies]] when he chanced across the comet while at the eyepiece of his friend's telescope. He realized he might have spotted something new when, like Hale, he checked his star maps to determine if any other deep-sky objects were known to be near M70, and found that there were none. He alerted the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams through a [[Western Union]] telegram. Brian Marsden, who had run the bureau since 1968, laughed, &quot;Nobody sends telegrams anymore. I mean, by the time that telegram got here, Alan Hale had already e-mailed us three times with updated coordinates.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NatGeo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/space/solar-system/comets-age.html | title = The Age of Comets | first = William  | month = December | year = 1997 | last = Newcott | work = [[National Geographic Society]] | accessdate = 7 December 2009 | quote = &quot;Nobody sends telegrams anymore...&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following morning, it was confirmed that this was a new comet, and it was named Comet Hale–Bopp, with the designation C/1995&amp;nbsp;O1.

The comet may have been observed by ancient Egyptians during the reign of pharaoh [[Pepi I]] (2332–2283).

== Early observation ==
Hale–Bopp's orbital position was calculated as 7.2&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical units]] (AU) from the Sun, placing it between [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] and by far the greatest distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) | url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/mpec/J95/J95P01.html | last=Marsden | first= B.

Its great distance and surprising activity indicated that Comet Hale–Bopp might become very bright indeed when it reached perihelion in 1997. However, comet scientists were wary – comets can be extremely unpredictable, and many have large outbursts at great distance only to diminish in brightness later. [[Comet Kohoutek]] in 1973 had been touted as a 'comet of the century' and turned out to be unspectacular.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeDiscovery&quot;/&gt;

== Perihelion ==
Hale–Bopp became visible to the [[naked eye]] in May 1996, and although its rate of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kidger2004&quot;/&gt; scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright. It was too closely aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with [[light pollution|light-polluted]] skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Comet Holds Clues to Birth of Time | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E6DF1639F93AA35750C0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 | last = Browne | first = Malcolm R. | date = March 9, 1997 | work = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Comet-Hale-Bopp-29-03-1997 hires adj.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The comet became a spectacular sight in early 1997.]]

The [[Internet]] was a growing phenomenon at the time, and numerous websites that tracked the comet's progress and provided daily images from around the world became extremely popular. The Internet played a large role in encouraging the unprecedented public interest in comet Hale–Bopp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= The Trail of Hale-Bopp | url= http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-trail-of-hale-bopp | work= Scientific American | date= 1997-03-17 | accessdate =2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the comet approached the Sun, it continued to brighten, shining at 2nd&amp;nbsp;magnitude in February, and showing a growing pair of tails, the blue gas tail pointing straight away from the Sun and the yellowish dust tail curving away along its orbit. On March 9, a [[Solar eclipse of March 9, 1997|solar eclipse]] in [[China]], [[Mongolia]] and eastern [[Siberia]] allowed observers there to see the comet in the daytime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The total solar eclipse of 1997 March 9 | last = McGee | first= H.

As it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997 the comet developed into a spectacular sight.

== After perihelion ==
After its perihelion passage, the comet moved into the southern celestial hemisphere, and its show was over as far as most of the northern hemisphere was concerned. The comet was much less impressive to [[southern hemisphere]] observers than it had been in the northern hemisphere, but southerners were able to see the comet gradually fade from view during the second half of 1997. The last naked-eye observations were reported in December 1997, which meant that the comet had remained visible without aid for 569&amp;nbsp;days, or about 18 and a half months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kidger2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kidger| first = M.R. | year=2004 | journal = Earth, Moon, and Planets | volume = 78 | issue=1–3 | pages = 169–177 | title = The Visual Light Curve Of C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) From Discovery To Late 1997 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/h72381014307x661/ | doi=10.1023/A:1006228113533 | last2 = Hurst | first2 = G. | last3 = James | first3 = N.|bibcode = 1997EM&amp;P...78..169K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous record had been set by the [[Great Comet of 1811]], which was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kidger2004&quot;/&gt;

The comet continued to fade as it receded, but is still being tracked by astronomers.

Over many orbits, the cumulative effect of gravitational perturbations on comets with high orbital [[inclination]]s and small perihelion distances is generally to reduce the perihelion distance to very small values. Hale–Bopp has about a 15%&amp;nbsp;chance of eventually becoming a [[sungrazing comet]] through this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Orbit Determination and Evolution of Comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) | bibcode=1996MNRAS.281..916B | last=Bailey | first=M.

It has been calculated that the previous visit by Hale–Bopp occurred in July 2215&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marsden1997&quot; /&gt; The comet may have presented a similar sight to people then, as the estimated closest approach to Earth was 1.4&amp;nbsp;AU, but no records of it have survived.

Comet Hale–Bopp was observed intensively by [[astronomy|astronomers]] during its perihelion passage, and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations. The dust production rate of the comet was very high (up to 2.0{{e|6}} kg/s),&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewitt1999&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title= Particulate Mass Loss from Comet Hale-Bopp | bibcode = 1999AJ....117.1056J | journal = The Astronomical Journal | volume = 117 | issue = 2 | pages = 1056–1062 | last=Jewitt | first = David | year=1999 | doi=10.1086/300743 | last2= Matthews | first2= Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may have made the inner coma [[Optical thickness|optically thick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fernández | first= Yanga R. | title = The Inner Coma and Nucleus of Comet Hale-Bopp: Results from a Stellar Occultation | bibcode = 1999Icar..140..205F | year = 1999 | journal = Icarus | volume = 140 | issue = 1 | pages = 205–220 | doi = 10.1006/icar.1999.6127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the properties of the dust grains—high temperature, high [[albedo]] and strong 10&amp;nbsp;μm silicate emission feature—the astronomers concluded the dust grains are smaller than observed in any other comet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Observations of Unusually Small Dust Grains in the Coma of Comet Hale-Bopp C/1995 O1 | bibcode = 2001ApJ...549..635M | last = Mason | first=C.

It is also to be noted that the comet Hale–Bopp showed highest ever linear polarization detected for any comet. Such polarization is the result of solar radiation getting scattered by the dust particles in the coma of the comet and depends on the nature of the grains. It further confirms that the dust grains in the coma of comet Hale–Bopp were smaller than inferred in any other comet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Polarimetric observations of the comet Hale-Bopp | bibcode = 1998A&amp;AS..129..489G | last = Ganesh | first=S. | journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement | year=1998 | volume = 129 | issue = 5 | pages = 489–493 | doi = 10.1051/aas:1998201 | last2 = Joshi | first2 = U.

=== Sodium tail ===
One of the most remarkable discoveries was that the comet had a third type of tail. In addition to the well-known gas and dust tails, Hale–Bopp also exhibited a faint [[sodium]] tail, only visible with powerful instruments with dedicated filters. Sodium emission had been previously observed in other comets, but had not been shown to come from a tail. Hale-Bopp's sodium tail consisted of [[electric charge|neutral atoms]] (not [[ion]]s), and extended to some 50 million kilometres in length.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cremonese1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | journal = The Astrophysical Journal Letters | volume = 490 | issue = 2 | pages =L199–L202 | year = 1997 | doi =  10.1086/311040 | title = Neutral Sodium from Comet Hale-Bopp: A Third Type of Tail | author1 = Cremonese, G | author2 = Boehnhardt, H | author3 = Crovisier, J | author4 = Rauer, H | author5 = Fitzsimmons, A | author6 = Fulle, M | author7 = Licandro, J | author8 = Pollacco, D | author9 = Tozzi, G. P | bibcode=1997ApJ...490L.199C|arxiv = astro-ph/9710022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The source of the sodium appeared to be the inner [[coma (cometary)|coma]], although not necessarily the [[comet nucleus|nucleus]]. There are several possible mechanisms for generating a source of sodium atoms, including collisions between dust grains surrounding the nucleus, and 'sputtering' of sodium from dust grains by [[ultraviolet]] light. It is not yet established which mechanism is primarily responsible for creating Hale-Bopp's sodium tail, and the narrow&lt;ref name=&quot;Cremonese1997&quot; /&gt; and diffuse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wilson |first=J. K.| title=Three tails of comet Hale-Bopp | bibcode = 1998GeoRL..25..225W | journal=Geophysical Research Letters | volume=25 | issue=3 | pages=225–228 | doi=10.1029/97GL03704 | year=1998 | last2=Baumgardner | first2=J. | last3=Mendillo | first3=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; components of the tail may have different origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=G. | last=Cremonese | title=Sodium In Comets | bibcode=1997EM&amp;P...79..209C | journal=Earth, Moon, and Planets | volume=79 | issue=1 | pages=209–220 | year=1997 | doi=10.1023/A:1006245619568 | last2=Fulle | first2=Marco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the comet's dust tail roughly followed the path of the comet's orbit and the gas tail pointed almost directly away from the Sun, the sodium tail appeared to lie between the two. This implies that the sodium atoms are driven away from the comet's head by [[radiation pressure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cremonese1997&quot; /&gt;

=== Deuterium abundance ===
The abundance of [[deuterium]] in Comet Hale–Bopp in the form of [[heavy water]] was found to be about twice that of Earth's [[ocean]]s. If Hale-Bopp's deuterium abundance is typical of all comets, this implies that although cometary impacts are thought to be the source of a significant amount of the water on Earth, they cannot be the only source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cometwater&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Cometary Deuterium | journal = Space Science Reviews | volume = 90 | issue = 1–2 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1023/A:1005269208310 | pages = 33–43 | first = Roland | last = Meier | last2 = Owen | first2 = Tobias C.|bibcode = 1999SSRv...90...33M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deuterium was also detected in many other [[hydrogen]] compounds in the comet. The ratio of deuterium to normal hydrogen was found to vary from compound to compound, which astronomers believe suggests that cometary ices were formed in [[interstellar cloud]]s, rather than in the [[solar nebula]]. Theoretical modelling of ice formation in interstellar clouds suggests that Comet Hale–Bopp formed at temperatures of around 25–45&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cometwater&quot;/&gt;

=== Organics ===
Spectroscopic observations of Hale–Bopp revealed the presence of many [[organic chemistry|organic chemicals]], several of which had never been detected in comets before. These complex molecules may exist within the cometary nucleus, or might be synthesised by reactions in the comet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cometorganic&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Organic synthesis in the coma of Comet Hale–Bopp?| journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society| volume = 320 | issue = 4 | year = 2002| doi = 10.1046/j.1365-8711.2001.04208.x | pages = L61–L64  | first = S.

=== Detection of argon ===
Hale–Bopp was the first comet where the [[noble gas]] [[argon]] was detected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Argon&quot; /&gt; Noble gases are chemically inert and highly [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]], and since different noble elements have different sublimation temperatures, they can be used for probing the temperature histories of the cometary ices. [[Krypton]] has a sublimation temperature of 16–20&amp;nbsp;K and was found to be depleted more than 25 times relative to the solar abundance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Detection of Soft X-rays and a Sensitive Search for Noble Gases in Comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1) | bibcode=1997Sci...277.1488K | last=Krasnopolsky | first=Vladimir A. | year = 1997 | journal=Science | volume=277 | pages=1488–1491 | doi=10.1126/science.277.5331.1488 | pmid=9278508 | issue=5331 | last2=Mumma | first2=MJ | last3=Abbott | first3=M | last4=Flynn | first4=BC | last5=Meech | first5=KJ | last6=Yeomans | first6=DK | last7=Feldman | first7=PD | last8=Cosmovici | first8=CB}}&lt;/ref&gt; while argon with its higher sublimation temperature was enriched relative to the solar abundance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Argon&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Discovery of Argon in Comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) | bibcode=2000ApJ...544L.169S | last=Stern | first=S. A. | year=2000 | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=544 | issue=2 | pages = L169–L172 | doi=10.1086/317312 | last2=Slater | first2=D. C. | last3=Festou | first3=M.

F. | last7=Wilkinson | first7=E.|arxiv = astro-ph/0011327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together these observations indicate that the interior of Hale-Bopp has always been colder than 35–40&amp;nbsp;K, but has at some point been warmer than 20&amp;nbsp;K. Unless the solar nebula was much colder and richer in argon than generally believed, this suggests that the comet was formed beyond Neptune in the [[Kuiper belt]] region and then migrated outward to the [[Oort cloud]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Argon&quot; /&gt;

=== Rotation ===
[[File:Comet Hale-Bopp Death Valley.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Comet Hale-Bopp over [[Zabriskie Point]], [[Death Valley]], USA]]

Comet Hale–Bopp's activity and outgassing were not spread uniformly over its nucleus, but instead came from several specific jets. Observations of the material streaming away from these jets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/anim30.html |title=Bergeron Comet Hale-Bopp Animation |accessdate=2008-10-14 |work=Stardust|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed astronomers to measure the rotation period of the comet, which was found to be about 11 hours 46 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement Series |volume = 136 | issue = 2 |pages =245–256 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1051/aas:1999213 | title = Dust continuum imaging of C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp): Rotation period and dust outflow velocity | author1 = Warell, J | author2 = Lagerkvist, C.-I | author3 = Lagerros, J. S. V|bibcode = 1999A&amp;AS..136..245W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Binary nucleus question ===
In 1999 a paper was published that hypothesised the existence of a binary [[comet nucleus|nucleus]] to fully explain the observed pattern of Comet Hale–Bopp's dust emission. The paper was based on theoretical analysis, and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus, but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30&amp;nbsp;km, with the main nucleus being about 70&amp;nbsp;km across, and would orbit in about three days at a distance of about 180&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Detection of a Satellite Orbiting The Nucleus of Comet Hale–Bopp (C/1995 O1) | journal = Earth, Moon, and Planets | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1023/A:1006230712665 | pages = 155–163
| first = Z. | last = Sekanina|bibcode = 1997EM&amp;P...77..155S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The findings of this paper were disputed by observational astronomers, as even with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] images of the comet revealed no trace of a double nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=McCarthy | first=D. W. | title=Comet Hale–Bopp in outburst: Imaging the dynamics of icy particles with HST/NICMOS | bibcode=2007Icar..189..184M | year=2007 | journal=Icarus | volume = 189 | issue = 1 | pages = 184–195| doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2007.01.019| last2=Stolovy| first2=S| last3=Campins| first3=H| last4=Larson| first4=S| last5=Samarasinha| first5=N| last6=Kern| first6=S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Weaver | first=H. A.| title = Post-Perihelion HST Observations of Comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1) | bibcode=1999Icar..141....1W | year=1999 | journal=Icarus | volume=141 | issue =1 | doi=10.1006/icar.1999.6159 | pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, while comets have been observed to break up before,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sekanina | first = Z. | title = The problem of split comets revisited | bibcode = 1997A&amp;A...318L...5S | journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics Letters | year = 1997 | volume = 318 | pages = L5–L8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; no case has previously been found of a stable binary nucleus. Given the very small mass of cometary nuclei, the orbit of a binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the gravity of the Sun and [[planet]]s.

Observations using [[adaptive optics]] in late 1997 and early 1998 were claimed to show a double peak in the brightness of the nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Marchis | first = F. | journal = Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | year = 1999 |
title = Adaptive optics observations of the innermost coma of C/1995 O1. Are there a &quot;Hale&quot; and a &quot;Bopp&quot; in comet Hale-Bopp? | url = http://aa.springer.de/papers/9349003/2300985.pdf |format=PDF| volume = 349 | pages = 985–995|bibcode = 1999A&amp;A...349..985M }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fernandez2002&quot; /&gt;

== UFO claims ==
In November 1996 amateur astronomer Chuck Shramek of [[Houston, Texas]] took a [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] image of the comet, which showed a fuzzy, slightly elongated object nearby. When his computer sky-viewing program did not identify the star, Shramek called the [[Art Bell]] radio program [[Coast to Coast AM]] to announce that he had discovered a &quot;Saturn-like object&quot; following Hale–Bopp. [[unidentified flying object|UFO]] enthusiasts, such as [[remote viewing]] proponent [[Courtney Brown (researcher)|Courtney Brown]], soon concluded that there was an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[spacecraft]] following the comet.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The man who spread the myth | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986171,00.html | work=Time| date=April 14, 1997 | first = Leon | last = Jaroff | coauthors = Willwerth, James | accessdate=2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several astronomers, including Alan Hale,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Hale-Bopp Comet Madness | first = Alan | last = Hale | journal = Skeptical Inquirer | year = 1997 | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 25–28 | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/hale-bopp_comet_madness/}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed the object was simply an 8.5-magnitude [[star]], SAO141894, which did not appear on Shramek's computer program because the user preferences were set incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Great Comets|first=Robert|last= Burnham|coauthors= Levy, David H. |year=2000 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=978-0-521-64600-0 | pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Art Bell even claimed to have obtained an image of the object from an anonymous astrophysicist who was about to confirm its discovery. However, astronomers [[Olivier Hainaut]] and [[David J. Tholen]] of the [[University of Hawaii]] stated that the alleged photo was an altered copy of one of their own comet images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |date=January 15, 1997 | title=Fraudulent use of a IfA/UH picture |url=http://www.sc.eso.org/~ohainaut/Hale_Bopp/hb_ufo_tholen.html | publisher=European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere |accessdate=2008-10-14|  first = David J. | last = Tholen |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930225155/http://www.sc.eso.org/~ohainaut/Hale_Bopp/hb_ufo_tholen.html |archivedate = September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months later, in March 1997, the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]] cult chose the appearance of the comet as a signal for their mass [[cult suicide]]. They claimed they were leaving their earthly bodies to travel to the spaceship following the comet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Heaven's Gate: The End | first = Wendy Gale | last = Robinson | journal = Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | url = http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol3/issue3/robinson.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancy Lieder]], a self-proclaimed [[contactee]] who claims to receive messages from aliens through an implant in her brain, stated that Hale–Bopp was a fiction designed to distract the population from the coming arrival of &quot;Nibiru&quot; or &quot;Planet X&quot;, a giant planet whose close passage would disrupt the Earth's rotation, causing global cataclysm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Comets Breed Fear, Fascination and Web Sites|author=George Johnson|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/28/us/comets-breed-fear-fascination-and-web-sites.html?sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=2009-09-27 | work=The New York Times | date=1997-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lieder's original date for the apocalypse, May 2003, has now passed, the imminent arrival of Nibiru is still predicted by various conspiracy websites, most of whom tie it to the [[2012 phenomenon]].&lt;ref name=myth&gt;{{cite web|title=The Myth of Nibiru and the End of the World in 2012|author=David Morrison|publisher=Skepical Enquirer|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/2008-05/morrison.html|accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Credit: [[ESO]]]]Its lengthy period of visibility and extensive coverage in the media meant that Hale–Bopp was probably the most-observed comet in history, making a far greater impact on the general public than the return of [[Comet Halley|Halley's Comet]] in 1986, and certainly seen by a greater number of people than witnessed any of Halley's previous appearances.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Indus.A2002274.0610.1km.jpg|thumb|250px|Cholistan Desert]]

'''Cholistan Desert''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|صحرائے چولستان}}}},  also locally known as ''Rohi'') sprawls thirty kilometers from [[Bahawalpur]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]] and covers an area of 26,300&amp;nbsp;km². It adjoins the [[Thar Desert]] extending over to [[Sindh]] and into [[India]].

The word Cholistan is derived from the Turkish word Chol, which means Desert. Cholistan thus means Land of the Desert.  The people of Cholistan lead a semi-nomadic life, moving from one place to another in search of water and fodder for their animals. The dry bed of the [[Hakra River]] runs through the area, along which many settlements of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] have been found.

The Desert also has an Annual Jeep Rally, known as Cholistan Desert Jeep Rally. It is the biggest motor sports event in Pakistan.

==Culture and traditions==
===Local Dialect===
The language of Cholistan also reflects a number of features of its historical and geographical background. The [[Saraiki]] language is an Indo-Aryan language of the [[Lahnda languages]] group, and is spoken in Cholistan as well as in a large part of central Pakistan. Though once a considered a dialect of Punjabi, it is no more a neglected language and is considered a separate language now. Khwaja Ghulam Farid was a Sufi poet, who through his mystical writings and poetry not only developed the language, but also gave it a boost. The language suffered a great loss when Saraiki-speaking Hindus migrated to India during the Partition, and were replaced by Urdu speaking Muslim refugees from India. However, the majority of refugees settled in the cities and  very few settled in rural Cholistan. Many Hindu Saraikis moved to the safety of the neighboring Hindu states of Bikaner and Jaisalmer during Partition.

===Arts and crafts===
In a harsh and barren land where rainfall is very sparse and unreliable, Cholistanis rely mainly on their livestock of sheep, goats, and camel. However in cold nights of winter they huddle indoor and engage themselves in various arts and crafts such as textiles, weaving, leatherwork, and pottery.

===Local crafts===
As mentioned above, the Indus Valley has always been occupied by the wandering nomadic tribes, who are fond of isolated areas, as such areas allow them to lead life free of foreign intrusion, enabling them to establish their own individual and unique cultures. Cholistan till the era of Mughal rule had also been isolated from outside influence. During the rule of Mughal Emperor Akbar, it became a proper productive unit. The entire area was ruled by a host of kings who securely guarded their frontiers. The rulers were the great patrons of art, and the various crafts underwent a simultaneous and parallel development, influencing each other.  Mesons, stone carvers, artisans, artists, and designers started rebuilding the old cities and new sites, and with that flourished new courts, paintings, weaving, and pottery. The fields of architecture, sculpture, terra cotta, and pottery developed greatly in this phase.

===Livestock===
The backbone of Cholistan economy is cattle breeding. It has the major importance for satisfying the area's major needs for cottage industry as well as milk meat and fat. Because of the nomadic way of life the main wealth of the people are their cattle that are bred for sale, milked or shorn for their wool. Moreover, isolated as they were, they had to depend upon themselves for all their needs like food, clothing, and all the items of daily use. So all their crafts initially stemmed from necessity but later on they started exporting their goods to the other places as well. The estimated number of livestock in the desert areas is 1.6 million.

===Cotton and wool products===
Cholistan produces very superior type of carpet wool as compared to that produced in other parts of Pakistan. From this wool they knit beautiful carpets, rugs and other woolen items. This includes blankets, which is also a local necessity for the desert is not just a land of dust and heat, but winter nights here are very cold, usually below freezing points. Khes and pattu are also manufactured with wool or cotton. Khes is a form of blanket with a field of black white and pattu has a white ground base. Cholistanis now sell the wool for it brings maximum profit.

===Textiles===
It may be mentioned that cotton textiles have always been a hallmark of craft of Indus valley civilization. Various kinds of khaddar-cloth are made for local consumption, and fine khaddar bedclothes and coarse lungies are woven here. A beautiful cloth called Sufi is also woven of silk and cotton, or with cotton wrap and silk wool. Gargas are made with numerous patterns and color, having complicated embroidery, mirror, and patchwork. Ajrak is another specialty of Cholistan. It is a special and delicate printing technique on both sides of the cloth in indigo blue and red patterns covering the base cloth. Cotton turbans and shawls are also made here. Chunri is another form of dopattas, having innumerable colors and patterns like dots, squares, and circles on it.

===Camel products===
Camels are highly valued by the desert dwellers. Camels are not only useful for transportation and loading purposes, but its skin and wool are also quite worthwhile. Camel wool is spun and woven into beautiful woolen blankets known as falsies and into stylish and durable rugs. The camel's leather is also utilized in making kuppies, goblets, and expensive lampshades.

===Leatherwork===
Leatherwork is another important local cottage industry due to the large number of livestock here. Other than the products mentioned above, Khusa (shoes) is a specialty of this area. Cholistani khusas are very famous for the quality of workmanship, variety, and richness of designs especially when stitched and embroidered with golden or brightly colored threads.

===Jewellery===
The Cholistanis are fond of jewellery and have a craze for gold. The chief ornaments made and worn by them are Nath-nose gay, Katmala-necklace Kangan-bracelet, Pazeb- anklets, and Chandanhar etc., Gold and silver bangles are also made and worn with pride. The locals are experts in enamel works, and it is done on buttons of all sorts, earrings, bangles, and rings etc.

===Love for colors===
The great desert though considered to be colorless and drab, is not wholly devoid of color. Its green portion plays the role of &quot;color belt&quot; especially after rains when vegetation growth is at its peak. Adding to that the locals always wear brightly colored clothes mostly consisting of brilliant reds, blazing oranges shocking pinks, and startling yellows and greens. Even the cloth trappings of their bullocks and camels are richly colored and highly textured.

==Terra Cotta==
The Indus Civilization was the earliest center of ceramics, and thus the pottery of Cholistan has a long history. Local soil is very fine, thus most suitable for making pottery. The fineness of the earth can be observed on the Kacha houses which are actually plastered with mud but look like white cemented. The chief Cholistani ceramic articles are their surahies, piyalas, and glasses, remarkable for their lightness and fine finishing. 

In the early times only the art of pottery and terracotta developed, but from the seventh century onwards, a large number of temples and images were also built on account of the intensified religious passions and the accumulation of wealth in cities. The building activity reached to such an extent that some cities actually became city temples. In fact the area particularly came to be known for its forts, villas, palaces, havelis, gateways, fortifications, and city walls.

'''Causantín''' or '''Constantín mac Cináeda''' ([[Scottish Gaelic|Modern Gaelic]] ''Còiseam mac Choinnich'') (died 877) was a [[list of Kings of the Picts|king of the Picts]]. He is often known as '''Constantine I''', in reference to his place in modern lists of [[kings of Scots]], though contemporary sources described Constantín only as a Pictish king. A son of [[Cináed mac Ailpín]] (&quot;Kenneth MacAlpin&quot;), he succeeded his uncle [[Domnall mac Ailpín]] as Pictish king following the latter's death on 13 April 862. It is likely that Constantín's (Constantine I) reign witnessed increased activity by [[Vikings]], based in [[Ireland]] and [[Northumbria]], in northern [[Great Britain|Britain]] and he died fighting one such invasion.

==Sources==
Very few records of ninth century events in northern Britain survive. The main local source from the period is the ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]'', a list of kings from Cináed mac Ailpín (died 858) to [[Cináed mac Maíl Coluim]] (died 995). The list survives in the [[Poppleton Manuscript]], a thirteenth century compilation. Originally simply a list of kings with reign lengths, the other details contained in the Poppleton Manuscript version were added from the tenth century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 87&amp;ndash;93; Dumville, &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, later king lists survive.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Kings and Kingship'', reproduces these lists and discusses their origins, further discussed by Broun, ''Irish origins''.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[genealogical]] records of the descendants of Cináed mac Ailpín may date from the end of the tenth century, but their value lies more in their context, and the information they provide about the interests of those for whom they were compiled, than in the unreliable claims they contain.&lt;ref&gt;Broun, ''Irish Identity'', pp. 133&amp;ndash;164; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 220&amp;ndash;221.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pictish king-lists originally ended with this Constantín, who was reckoned the seventieth and last king of the Picts.&lt;ref&gt;Broun, ''Irish Identity'', p. 168&amp;ndash;169; Anderson, ''Kings and Kingship'', p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

For narrative history the principal sources are the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and the Irish annals. While [[Scandinavia]]n [[sagas]] describe events in 9th century Britain, their value as sources of historical narrative, rather than documents of social history, is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 277&amp;ndash;285; Ó Corrain, &quot;Vikings in Scotland and Ireland&quot;...&lt;/ref&gt; If the sources for north-eastern Britain, the lands of the kingdom of [[Northumbria]] and the former Pictland, are limited and late, those for the areas on the [[Irish Sea]] and [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coasts&amp;mdash;the modern regions of north-west England and all of northern and western Scotland&amp;mdash;are non-existent, and [[archaeology]] and [[toponymy]] are of primary importance.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages and names==
Writing a century before Constantín was born, [[Bede]] recorded five languages in Britain. [[Latin]], the common language of the church, [[Old English language|Old English]], the language of the Angles and Saxons, [[Irish language|Irish]], spoken on the western coasts of Britain and in Ireland, [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]], ancestor of the [[Welsh language]], spoken in large parts of western Britain, and [[Pictish language|Pictish]], spoken in northern Britain. By the ninth century a sixth language, [[Old Norse]], had arrived with the Vikings.

==Amlaíb and Ímar==
Viking activity in northern Britain appears to have reached a peak during Constantín's reign. Viking armies were led by a small group of men who may have been kinsmen. Among those noted by the Irish annals, the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' are [[Ívarr]]&amp;mdash;Ímar in Irish sources&amp;mdash;who was active from [[East Anglia]] to Ireland, Halfdán&amp;mdash;Albdann in Irish, Healfdene in Old English&amp;mdash; and [[Amlaíb Conung|Amlaíb]] or Óláfr. As well as these leaders, various others related to them appear in the surviving record.&lt;ref&gt;Downham, Smyth, Woolf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Viking activity in Britain increased in 865 when the [[Great Heathen Army]], probably a part of the forces which had been active in [[Francia]], landed in East Anglia.&lt;ref&gt;Check Nelson.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, having obtained tribute from the East Anglian King [[Edmund the Martyr|Edmund]], the Great Army moved north, seizing [[York]], chief city of the Northumbrians.&lt;ref&gt;Downham, Keynes, Woolf.&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Army defeated an attack on York by the two rivals for the Northumbrian throne, [[Osberht of Northumbria|Osberht]] and [[Ælla of Northumbria|Ælla]], who had put aside their differences in the face of a common enemy. Both would-be kings were killed in the failed assault, probably on 21 March 867. Following this, the leaders of the Great Army are said to have installed one [[Ecgberht I of Northumbria|Ecgberht]] as king of the Northumbrians.&lt;ref&gt;Downham, Higham, Keynes, O Corrain, Smyth, Woolf.&lt;/ref&gt; Their next target was [[Mercia]] where King [[Burgred of Mercia|Burgred]], aided by his brother-in-law King [[Æthelred of Wessex]], drove them off.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes ...&lt;/ref&gt;

While the kingdoms of East Anglia, Mercia and Northumbria were under attack, other Viking armies were active in the far north. Amlaíb and [[Auisle]] (Ásl or Auðgísl), said to be his brother, brought an army to Fortriu and obtained tribute and hostages in 866. Historians disagree as to whether the army returned to Ireland in 866, 867 or even in 869.&lt;ref&gt;Downham, O Corrain, Smyth, Woolf, AU 866.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Late sources of uncertain reliability state that Auisle was killed by Amlaíb in 867 in a dispute over Amlaíb's wife, the daughter of Cináed. It is unclear whether, if accurate, this woman should be identified as a daughter of Cináed mac Ailpín, and thus Constantín's sister, or as a daughter of [[Cináed mac Conaing]], [[king of Brega]].&lt;ref&gt;Downham, ??, FAA.&lt;/ref&gt; While Amlaíb and Auisle were in north Britain, the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' record that [[Áed Findliath]], [[High King of Ireland]], took advantage of their absence to destroy the [[longphort]]s along the northern coasts of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne? O Corrain? AU 866.4&lt;/ref&gt; Áed Findliath was married to Constantín's sister Máel Muire. She later married Áed's successor [[Flann Sinna]]. Her death is recorded in 913.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, AU 913.1, Byrne p. 857, poss. same as Amlaíb's wife.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 870, Amlaíb and Ívarr attacked [[Dumbarton Rock]], where the [[River Leven, Dunbartonshire|River Leven]] meets the [[River Clyde]], the chief place of the kingdom of [[Alt Clut]], south-western neighbour of Pictland. The siege lasted four months before the fortress fell to the Vikings who returned to Ireland with many prisoners, &quot;Angles, Britons and Picts&quot;, in 871. Archaeological evidence suggests that Dumbarton Rock was largely abandoned and that [[Govan]] replaced it as the chief place of the kingdom of Strathclyde, as Alt Clut was later known.&lt;ref&gt;AU 870.6, AU 871.2, Woolf, Downham, Smyth.&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Artgal of Alt Clut]] did not long survive these events, being killed &quot;at the instigation&quot; of Constantín son of Cináed two years later. Artgal's son and successor [[Run of Alt Clut|Run]] was married to a sister of Constantín.&lt;ref&gt;AU 872.5, Smyth, Woolf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amlaíb disappears from Irish annals after his return to Ireland in 871. According to the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' he was killed by Constantín either in 871 or 872 when he returned to Pictland to collect further tribute.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Downham.&lt;/ref&gt; His ally Ívarr died in 873.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Downham, AU 873.3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last days of the Pictish kingdom==
In 875, the Chronicle and the Annals of Ulster again report a Viking army in Pictland. A battle, fought near [[Dollar, Clackmannanshire|Dollar]], was a heavy defeat for the Picts; the Annals of Ulster say that &quot;a great slaughter of the Picts resulted&quot;. Although there is agreement that Constantín was killed fighting Vikings in 877, it is not clear where this happened. Some believe he was beheaded on a Fife beach, following a battle at Fife Ness, near Crail. [[William Forbes Skene]] read the Chronicle as placing Constantín's death at Inverdovat (by [[Newport-on-Tay]]), which appears to match the [[Prophecy of Berchán]]. The account in the [[Chronicle of Melrose]] names the place as the &quot;Black Cave&quot; and [[John of Fordun]] calls it the &quot;Black Den&quot;. Constantín was buried on [[Iona]].

==Aftermath==
Constantín's son [[Donald II of Scotland|Domnall]] and his descendants represented the main line of the [[kings of Alba]] and later [[Scotland]].

Co-emperor alongside his brothers, his short reign saw the beginnings of conflict emerge between the sons of [[Constantine the Great]], and his attempt to exert his perceived rights of [[primogeniture]] ended up causing his death in a failed invasion of [[Italy]] in 340.

==Career==
[[File:Campidoglio, Roma - Costantino II cesare dettaglio.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Statue of emperor Constantine II as caesar on top of the Cordonata (the monumental ladder climbing up to [[Piazza del Campidoglio]]), in Rome.]]
The eldest, possibly illegitimate,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 223&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus 2:20:2&lt;/ref&gt; son of [[Constantine the Great]], he was born at [[Arles]] in February, 317,&lt;ref&gt;Victor, 41:4&lt;/ref&gt; and raised as a Christian. On March 1 317, Constantine was made [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]],&lt;ref&gt;Victor, 41:6&lt;/ref&gt; and at the age of seven in 323, took part in his father's campaign against the [[Sarmatia]]ns.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;DiMaio, ''Constantine II (337–340 A.D.)''&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of ten he became commander of [[Gaul]], after the death of his half-brother [[Crispus]]. An inscription dating to 330 records the title of ''Alamannicus'', so it is probable that his generals won a victory over the [[Alamanni]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;  His military career continued when Constantine I chose his son field commander during the 332 campaign against the [[Goths]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 129&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of his father in 337, Constantine II initially became emperor jointly with his brothers [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Eutropius, 10:9&quot;&gt;Eutropius, 10:9&lt;/ref&gt; with the empire divided between them and their cousins, the ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]s'' [[Dalmatius]] and [[Hannibalianus]].&lt;ref&gt;Victor, 41:20&lt;/ref&gt;  This arrangement barely survived Constantine I’s death, with the sons of Constantine arranging the slaughter of most of the family of Constantine I at the hands of the army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;&gt;Gibbon, Ch. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the three brothers gathered together in [[Pannonia]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; and there on September 9, 337,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 223&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt; divided the Roman world between themselves. Constantine, proclaimed ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]'' by the troops&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 223&quot;/&gt; received [[Gaul]], [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] and [[Hispania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 129&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Impero Romano da maggio a settembre 337.png|thumb|left|Division of the Roman Empire among the Caesars appointed by [[Constantine I]]: from left to right, the territories of Constantine II, [[Constans I]], [[Dalmatius]] and [[Constantius II]]. After the death of Constantine I (May 337), this was the formal division of the Empire, until Dalmatius was killed and his territory divided between Constans and Constantius.]]

He was soon involved in the struggle between the different Christian streams that was rupturing the unity of the [[Christian Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;  The Western portion of the empire, under the influence of the [[Pope]]s in [[Rome]] leaned towards [[Catholicism]] and against [[Arianism]], and through their intercession they convinced Constantine to free [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]], allowing him to return to [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;A. H. M. Jones, &quot;The Later Roman Empire&quot; (Baltimore, 1986), pg. 114&lt;/ref&gt; This action aggravated Constantius II, who was a committed supporter of Arianism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 129&quot;/&gt;

At first, he was the guardian of his younger brother Constans, whose portion was [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]], [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]]. Constantine soon complained that he had not received the amount of territory that was his due, stemming from his position as the eldest of Constantine’s sons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt;  Annoyed that Constans had received [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] after the death of Dalmatius, Constantine demanded that Constans hand over the African provinces, which, in order to maintain a fragile peace, he agreed to do.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:21&quot;&gt;Victor, 41:21&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon however, they began quarrelling over which parts of the African provinces belonged to [[Carthage]], and thus Constantine, and that which belonged to [[Italy]], and therefore Constans.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 2:41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional complications also arose when Constans came of age, and Constantine, who had grown used to dominating his younger brother, would not relinquish the guardianship. Therefore in 340 he marched into Italy at the head of his troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:21&quot;/&gt; Constans, at that time in [[Dacia]], detached and sent a select and disciplined body of his Illyrian troops, stating that he would follow them in person with the remainder of his forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt;  Constantine was engaged in military operations around [[Aquileia]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Eutropius, 10:9&quot;/&gt; and he was killed in an ambush in [[Cervignano del Friuli]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:21&quot;/&gt;  Constans took control of his deceased brother's realm.

'''Constantine, son of Áed''' ([[Middle Irish|Medieval Gaelic]]: ''Constantín mac Áeda''; [[Scottish Gaelic language|Modern Gaelic]]: ''Còiseam mac Aoidh'', known in most modern regnal lists as '''Constantine II'''; before&amp;nbsp;879–952) was an early [[King of Scotland]], known then by the Gaelic name ''Alba''. The [[Kingdom of Alba]], a name which first appears in Constantine's lifetime, was in northern [[Great Britain]]. The core of the kingdom was formed by the lands around the [[River Tay]]. Its southern limit was the [[River Forth]], northwards it extended towards the [[Moray Firth]] and perhaps to [[Caithness]], while its western limits are uncertain. Constantine's grandfather [[Kenneth I of Scotland]] (Cináed mac Ailpín, died 858) was the first of the family recorded as a king, but as [[king of the Picts]]. This change of title, from king of the Picts to king of Alba, is part of a broader transformation of [[Pictland]] and the [[origins of the Kingdom of Alba]] are traced to Constantine's lifetime. 

His reign, like those of his predecessors, was dominated by the actions of [[Viking]] rulers in the [[British Isles]], particularly the [[Uí Ímair]] (&quot;the grandsons of Ímar&quot;, or [[Ivar the Boneless]]). During Constantine's reign the rulers of the southern kingdoms of [[Wessex]] and [[Mercia]], later the [[Kingdom of England]], extended their authority northwards into the disputed kingdoms of [[Northumbria]]. At first allied with the southern rulers against the Vikings, Constantine in time came into conflict with them. King [[Athelstan of England|Æthelstan]] was successful in securing Constantine's submission in 927 and 934, but the two again fought when Constantine, allied with the [[Strathclyde Britons]] and the Viking king of [[Dublin]], invaded Æthelstan's kingdom in 937, only to be defeated at the great [[battle of Brunanburh]]. In 943 Constantine abdicated the throne and retired to the [[Céli Dé]] (Culdee) monastery of [[St Andrews]] where he died in 952. He was succeeded by his predecessor's son [[Malcolm I of Scotland|Malcolm&amp;nbsp;I]] (Máel Coluim mac Domnaill).

Constantine's reign of 43 years, exceeded in Scotland only by that of King [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]] before the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, is believed to have played a defining part in the [[gaelicisation]] of Pictland, in which his patronage of the Irish Céli Dé monastic reformers was a significant factor. During his reign the words &quot;Scots&quot; and &quot;Scotland&quot; ({{lang-ang|Scottas, Scotland}}) are first used to mean part of what is now [[Scotland]]. The earliest evidence for the ecclesiastical and administrative institutions which would last until the [[Davidian Revolution]] also appears at this time.

==Sources==
Compared to neighbouring [[Ireland]] and [[Anglo-Saxon England]], few records of 9th- and 10th-century events in Scotland survive. The main local source from the period is the ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]'', a list of kings from Kenneth MacAlpin (died 858) to [[Kenneth II of Scotland|Kenneth&amp;nbsp;II]] (Cináed mac Maíl Coluim, died 995). The list survives in the [[Poppleton Manuscript]], a 13th-century compilation. Originally simply a list of kings with reign lengths, the other details contained in the Poppleton Manuscript version were added in the 10th and 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 87–93; Dumville, &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, later king lists survive.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Kings and Kingship'', reproduces these lists and discusses their origins.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[genealogical]] records of the descendants of Kenneth MacAlpin may date from the end of the 10th century, but their value lies more in their context, and the information they provide about the interests of those for whom they were compiled, than in the unreliable claims they contain.&lt;ref&gt;Broun, ''Irish Identity'', pp. 133–164; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 220–221.&lt;/ref&gt;

For narrative history the principal sources are the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and the [[Irish annals]]. The evidence from [[charter]]s created in the [[Kingdom of England]] provides occasional insight into events in northern Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 2–3, 87–88, and 357–359.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Scandinavia]]n [[sagas]] describe events in 10th-century Britain, their value as sources of historical narrative, rather than documents of social history, is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 277–285; Ó Corrain, &quot;Vikings in Scotland and Ireland&quot;; Sawyer and Sawyer, ''Medieval Scandinavia'', pp. 21–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Mainland European sources rarely concern themselves with affairs in Britain, and even less commonly with events in northern Britain, but the life of Saint [[Cathróe of Metz]], a work of [[hagiography]] written in Germany at the end of the 10th century, provides plausible details of the saint's early life in north Britain.&lt;ref&gt;MacQuarrie, ''Saints of Scotland'', pp. 199–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the sources for north-eastern Britain, the lands of the kingdom of [[Northumbria]] and the former Pictland, are limited and late, those for the areas on the [[Irish Sea]] and Atlantic coasts—the modern regions of north-west England and all of northern and western Scotland—are non-existent, and [[archaeology]] and [[toponymy]] are of primary importance.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pictland from Constantín mac Fergusa to Constantine I==
{{main|Origins of the Kingdom of Alba}}
[[Image:Early Alpinid kings.svg|280px|thumb|Recorded relationships within the early [[House of Alpin]]]]

The dominant kingdom in eastern Scotland before the [[Viking Age]] was the northern [[Pictish]] kingdom of [[Fortriu]] on the shores of the [[Moray Firth]]. By the 9th century, the [[Gaels]] of [[Dál Riata]] (Dalriada) were subject to the kings of Fortriu of the family of [[Constantín of the Picts|Constantín mac Fergusa]] (Constantine son of Fergus). Constantín's family dominated Fortriu after 789 and perhaps, if Constantín was a kinsman of [[Óengus I of the Picts]] (Óengus son of Fergus), from around 730. The dominance of Fortriu came to an end in 839 with a defeat by Viking armies reported by the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' in which King [[Uen of the Picts|Uen]] of Fortriu and his brother Bran, Constantín's nephews, together with the king of Dál Riata, [[Áed mac Boanta]], &quot;and others almost innumerable&quot; were killed.&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 838.&lt;/ref&gt; These deaths led to a period of instability lasting a decade as several families attempted to establish their dominance in Pictland. By around 848 [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Kenneth MacAlpin]] had emerged as the winner.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 57–67 and 93–98; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 180–185; Duncan, ''Kingship of the Scots'', pp. 8–10; Bannerman, &quot;Scottish takeover&quot;; Foster, ''Picts, Gaels and Scots'', pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later [[national myth]] made Kenneth MacAlpin the creator of the [[kingdom of Scotland]], the founding of which was dated from 843, the year in which he was said to have destroyed the Picts and inaugurated a new era. The historical record for 9th century Scotland is meagre, but the Irish annals and the 10th-century ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' agree that Kenneth was a Pictish king, and call him &quot;king of the Picts&quot; at his death. The same style is used of Kenneth's brother [[Donald I of Scotland|Donald&amp;nbsp;I]] (Domnall mac Ailpín) and sons [[Constantine I of Scotland|Constantine&amp;nbsp;I]] (Constantín mac Cináeda) and [[Áed of Scotland|Áed]] (Áed mac Cináeda).&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 93–117 and 320–322; Broun, &quot;Dunkeld&quot;; Duncan, ''Kingship of the Scots'', pp. 13–14; Herbert, &quot;''Ri Éirenn, Ri Alban''&quot;; Dumville, &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The kingdom ruled by Kenneth's descendants—older works used the name [[House of Alpin]] to describe them but descent from Kenneth was the defining factor, Irish sources referring to ''Clann Cináeda meic Ailpín'' (&quot;the Clan of Kenneth MacAlpin&quot;) &lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 220–221 and 256–257; Broun, ''Irish Identity'', pp. 173–174&lt;/ref&gt;—lay to the south of the previously dominant kingdom of Fortriu, centred in the lands around the [[River Tay]]. The extent of Kenneth's nameless kingdom is uncertain, but it certainly extended from the [[Firth of Forth]] in the south to the [[Mounth]] in the north. Whether it extended beyond the mountainous spine of north Britain—[[Druim Alban]]—is unclear. The core of the kingdom was similar to the old counties of [[Kincardineshire|Mearns]], [[Forfarshire|Forfar]], [[Perthshire|Perth]], [[Fife]], and [[Kinross-shire|Kinross]]. Among the chief ecclesiastical centres named in the records are [[Dunkeld]], probably seat of the bishop of the kingdom, and ''Cell Rígmonaid'' (modern [[St Andrews]]).&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 98–101; Driscoll, ''Alba'' pp. 33–51; Foster, ''Picts, Gaels and Scots'', pp. 8 fig. 1, 39 fig. 24., and 110–111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth's son Constantine died in 876, probably killed fighting against a Viking army which had come north from Northumbria in 874. According to the king lists, he was counted the 70th and last king of the Picts in later times.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 106–116; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 72–75, s.a. 875. For Constantine as the last Pictish king, the original count being 66 kings, see Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 124–126; Broun, ''Irish Identity'', pp. 168–169; Anderson, ''Kings and Kingship'', pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dotted line marked A represents the southern boundary of the [[Kingdom of Alba]], [[circa|c.]] 890–950. The dotted line marked B represents the southern boundary of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], c. 925–945.]]

In 899 [[Alfred the Great]], king of [[Wessex]], died leaving his son [[Edward the Elder]] as ruler of Britain south of the [[River Thames]] and his daughter [[Æthelflæd]] and son-in-law [[Æthelred, ealdorman of Mercia|Æthelred]] ruling the western, English part of [[Mercia]]. The situation in the Danish kingdoms of eastern Britain is less clear. King [[Eohric of East Anglia|Eohric]] was probably ruling in [[East Anglia]], but no dates can reliably be assigned to the successors of [[Guthfrith, King of York|Guthfrith of York]] in Northumbria. It is known that Guthfrith was succeeded by Sigurd and Cnut, although whether these men ruled jointly or one after the other is uncertain. Northumbria may have been divided by this time between the Viking kings in York and the local rulers, perhaps represented by [[Eadulf I of Bernicia|Eadulf]], based at [[Bamburgh]] who controlled the lands from the [[River Tyne]] or [[River Tees]] to the Forth in the north.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, &quot;Rulers of the English&quot;, pp. 504–505; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 138–139; Blair, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 75–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland, [[Flann Sinna]], married to Constantine's aunt Máel Muire, was dominant. The years around 900 represented a period of weakness among the Vikings and [[Norse-Gaels]] of [[Dublin]]. They are reported to have been divided between two rival leaders. In 894 one group left Dublin, perhaps settling on the Irish Sea coast of Britain between the [[River Mersey]] and the [[Firth of Clyde]]. The remaining Dubliners were expelled in 902 by Flann Sinna's son-in-law [[Cerball mac Muirecáin]], and soon afterwards appeared in western and northern Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Annals of Ulster, s.a. 893 and 902; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp 131 and 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the south-west of Constantine's lands lay the [[kingdom of Strathclyde]]. This extended north into the [[Lennox (district)|Lennox]], east to the River Forth, and south into the [[Southern Uplands]]. In 900 it was probably ruled by King [[Dyfnwal I of Strathclyde|Dyfnwal]].&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 153–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation of the Gaelic kingdoms of [[Dál Riata]] in western Scotland is uncertain. No kings are known by name after Áed mac Boanta. The [[Francia|Frankish]] ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'' may record the conquest of the [[Inner Hebrides]], the seaward part of Dál Riata, by Northmen in 849.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, pp. 99–100 and 286–289; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these, the arrival of new groups of Vikings from northern and western Europe was still commonplace. Whether there were Viking or Norse-Gael kingdoms in the [[Western Isles]] or the [[Northern Isles]] at this time is debated.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 275–311, especially 286–289; Ó Corrain, &quot;Vikings in Scotland and Ireland&quot;; Crawford, ''Scandinavian Scotland'', pp. 39–62; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 141–174.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[Áed of Scotland|Áed]], Constantine's father, succeeded Constantine's uncle and namesake [[Constantine I of Scotland|Constantine&amp;nbsp;I]] in 876 but was killed in 878. Áed's short reign is glossed as being of no importance by most king lists. Although the date of his birth is nowhere recorded, Constantine&amp;nbsp;II cannot have been born any later than the year after his father's death, that is 879. His name may suggest that he was born rather earlier, during the reign of his uncle Constantine&amp;nbsp;I.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 116–117, 124, and 166, note 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Áed's death there is a two decade gap until the death of [[Donald II of Scotland|Donald&amp;nbsp;II]] (Domnall mac Constantín) in 900 during which nothing is reported in the Irish annals.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 358–358 and 395; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; The entry for the reign between Áed and Donald&amp;nbsp;II is corrupt in the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'', and in this case the ''Chronicle'' is at variance with every other king list.&lt;ref&gt;On this, note Dumville's comments regarding [[damnatio memoriae]], Dumville, &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;, p. 75; see also Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 117–121.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Chronicle'', Áed was followed by [[Eochaid of Scotland|Eochaid]], a grandson of Kenneth MacAlpin, who is somehow connected with [[Giric of Scotland|Giric]], but all other lists say that Giric ruled after Áed and make great claims for him.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Kings and Kingship'', pp. 251–252, 254, 263, 267, 274, 283, and 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Giric is not known to have been a kinsman of Kenneth's, although it has been suggested that he was related to him by marriage. The major changes in Pictland which began at about this time have been associated by [[Alex Woolf]] and [[Archie Duncan]] with Giric's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, pp. 11–16; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 117–121, 137–138, and 320–322. For an alternative view of all this, see Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 215–218.&lt;/ref&gt;

Woolf suggests that Constantine and his cousin Donald may have passed Giric's reign in exile in Ireland where their aunt Máel Muire was wife of two successive [[High Kings of Ireland]], [[Áed Findliath]] and [[Flann Sinna]].&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 122–125.&lt;/ref&gt; Giric died in 889. If he had been in exile, Constantine may have returned to Pictland where his cousin Donald&amp;nbsp;II became king. Donald's reputation is suggested by the [[epithet]] ''dasachtach'', a word used of violent madmen and mad bulls, attached to him in the 11th-century writings of [[Flann Mainistrech]], echoed by the his description in the ''[[Prophecy of Berchan]]'' as &quot;the rough one who will think relics and psalms of little worth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. cxlix and 397–398.&lt;/ref&gt; Wars with the Viking kings in Britain and Ireland continued during Donald's reign and he was probably killed fighting yet more Vikings at [[Dunnottar]] in the Mearns in 900. Constantine succeeded him as king.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, p. 125; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 395–398. The account of the conquest of the [[kingdom of Strathclyde]] in Domnall's time given by, for example, Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 217–218, is rejected by Duncan, ''Kingship of the Scots'', p. 40, and Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 152–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vikings and bishops==
[[Image:Monymusk Reliquary.jpg|thumb|The cult of Saint [[Columba]] and its relics were associated with victory in battle. The ''Cathbuaid'', Columba's [[crozier]] or staff, has been lost but the 8th-century ''Breccbennach'' or [[Monymusk Reliquary]] shown here, which held relics of Columba, is known to have been carried into battle from the reign of King [[William I of Scotland|William&amp;nbsp;I]] onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, ''The Conversion of Britain'', pp. 190–191; Alcock, ''Kings and Warriors'', pp. 327–329; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', p.136. See also the [[Cathach of St. Columba]], a 7th-century [[psalter]] to which similar powers were attributed.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The earliest event recorded in the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' in Constantine's reign is an attack by Vikings and the plundering of Dunkeld &quot;and all Albania&quot; in his third year. This is the first use of the word Albania, the [[Latin]] form of the [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] ''Alba'', in the ''Chronicle'' which until then describes the lands ruled by the descendants of Cináed as Pictavia.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 122–126; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 444–446, where Albania is translated as Scotland; Broun, &quot;Dunkeld&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

These Northmen may have been some of those who were driven out of [[Dublin]] in 902, but could also have been the same group who had defeated Domnall in 900. The ''Chronicle'' states that the Northmen were killed in ''Srath Erenn'', which is confirmed by the ''Annals of Ulster'' which records the death of Ímar grandson of Ímar and many others at the hands of the men of Fortriu in 904. This Ímar was the first of the [[Uí Ímair]], that is the grandsons of Ímar, to be reported; three more grandsons of Ímar appear later in Constantín's reign. The ''[[Fragmentary Annals of Ireland]]'' contain an account of the battle, and this attributes the defeat of the Norsemen to the intercession of Saint [[Columba]] following fasting and prayer. An entry in the ''[[Chronicon Scotorum]]'' under the year 904 may possibly contain a corrupted reference to this battle.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 127–128 and 130–131; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 398, 399, and 444–446; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 902, 904; ''Chronicon Scotorum'', s.a. 902, 904; ''Fragmentary Annals'', FA 429.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next event reported by the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' is dated to 906. This records that:&lt;blockquote&gt;King Constantine and Bishop [[Cellach I of Cennrígmonaid|Cellach]] met at the ''Hill of Belief'' near the royal city of [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] and pledged themselves that the laws and disciplines of the faith, and the laws of churches and gospels, should be kept ''pariter cum Scottis''.&lt;ref&gt;After Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The meaning of this entry, and its significance, have been the subject of debate.

[[Image:Moot hill.jpg|thumb|left|The [[moot hill]] at Scone, perhaps the ''Hill of Belief'' of 906&lt;ref&gt;Bannerman, &quot;Scottish Takeover&quot;, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The phrase ''pariter cum Scottis'' in the [[Latin]] text of the ''Chronicle'' has been translated in several ways. [[William Forbes Skene]] and [[Alan Orr Anderson]] proposed that it should be read as &quot;in conformity with the customs of the Gaels&quot;, relating it to the claims in the king lists that Giric liberated the church from secular oppression and adopted Irish customs.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 445, note 1; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 135. This version is followed by Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been read as &quot;together with the Gaels&quot;, suggesting either public participation or the presence of Gaels from the western coasts as well as the people of the east coast.&lt;ref&gt;Driscoll, p. 37, translates the phrase in this way; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 135–136.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it is suggested that it was the ceremony which followed &quot;the custom of the Gaels&quot; and not the agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 136; see also Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that this gathering agreed to uphold Irish laws governing the church has suggested that it was an important step in the [[gaelicisation]] of the lands east of Druim Alban.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 188–189, writes that &quot;it marks the final triumph of the Gaelic order over the old Pictish order&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have proposed that the ceremony in some way endorsed Constantine's kingship, prefiguring later royal inaugurations at Scone.&lt;ref&gt;Driscoll, ''Alba'', p. 37; Duncan, ''Kingship of the Scots'', pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, if Bishop Cellach was appointed by Giric, it may be that the gathering was intended to heal a rift between king and church.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return of the Uí Ímair==
Following the events at Scone, there is little of substance reported for a decade. A story in the ''Fragmentary Annals of Ireland'', perhaps referring to events some time after 911, claims that Queen Æthelflæd, who ruled in Mercia, allied with the Irish and northern rulers against the Norsemen on the Irish sea coasts of Northumbria. The ''Annals of Ulster'' record the defeat of an Irish fleet from the kingdom of [[Ulaid]] by Vikings &quot;on the coast of England&quot; at about this time.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, ''Kingdom of Northumbria'', pp. 185–186; ''Fragmentary Annals of Ireland'', FA 429; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 913.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this period the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' reports the death of [[Cormac mac Cuilennáin]], [[king of Munster]], in the eighth year of Constantine's reign.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Annals of Ulster'' states that Cormac died on {{Nowrap|13 September}} 908; Woolf, pp. 127–129.&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by an undated entry which was formerly read as &quot;In his time Domnall [i.e. Dyfnwal], king of the [Strathclyde] Britons died, and Domnall son of Áed was elected&quot;. This was thought to record the election of a brother of Constantine named Domnall to the kingship of the Britons of Strathclyde and was seen as early evidence of the domination of Strathclyde by the kings of Alba. The entry in question is now read as &quot;... Dynfwal&amp;nbsp;... and Domnall son Áed [[king of Ailech]] died&quot;, this [[Domnall Dabaill|Domnall]] being a son of [[Áed Findliath]] who died on {{Nowrap|21 March}} 915.&lt;ref&gt;Domnall's death is recorded by the ''Annals of Ulster''. For the re-reading by Benjamin Hudson, see Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 127–129 and 152–157; Dumville, &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;, p. 77. Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 222–223, is typical of the interpretation found in older works. The phrase in question reads &quot;''et Dunenaldus filius Ede elig&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;''&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the deaths of Flann Sinna and [[Niall Glúndub]] are recorded.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Annals of Ulster'' record the death of Flann on {{Nowrap|25 May}} 916 and that of Niall on {{Nowrap|14 September}} 919; Woolf, pp. 127–129.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are more reports of Viking fleets in the [[Irish Sea]] from 914 onwards. By 916 fleets under [[Sihtric Cáech]] and [[Ragnall ua Ímair|Ragnall]], said to be grandsons of Ímar (that is, they belonged to the same [[Uí Ímair]] kindred as the Ímar who was killed in 904), were very active in Ireland. Sihtric inflicted a heavy defeat on the armies of [[Leinster]] and retook Dublin in 917.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, &quot;Sihtric Cáech&quot;; Hart &quot;Ragnall&quot;; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 138–141; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 914–917.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Ragnall appears to have returned across the Irish sea intent on establishing himself as king at [[York]].&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 142; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 918.&lt;/ref&gt; The only precisely dated event in the summer of 918 is the death of Queen Æthelflæd on {{Nowrap|12 June}} 918 at [[Tamworth]]. Æthelflæd had been negotiating with the Northumbrians to obtain their submission, but her death put an end to this and her successor, her brother [[Edward the Elder]], was occupied with securing control of Mercia.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, ''Kingdom of Northumbria'', pp. 186–188; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 105, Ms. C, s.a. 918, 919.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dere Street.JPG|thumb|[[Dere Street]]; Corbridge is just south of [[Hadrian's Wall]] in the centre of the map]]

The northern part of Northumbria, and perhaps the whole kingdom, had probably been ruled by [[Ealdred I of Bernicia|Ealdred]] son of [[Eadulf I of Bernicia|Eadulf]] since 913.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, &quot;Rulers of the English&quot;; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 138–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with Ragnall's invasion, Ealdred came north seeking assistance from Constantine. The two advanced south to face Ragnall, and this led to a battle somewhere on the banks of the [[River Tyne]], probably at [[Corbridge]] where [[Dere Street]] crosses the river. The [[Second Battle of Corbridge]] appears to have been indecisive; the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' is alone in giving Constantine the victory.&lt;ref&gt;There is disagreement as to whether there was one battle at Corbridge in the 910s or two. The ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 918, the ''Fragmentary Annals of Ireland'', and the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'', report only one battle. The idea that there were two rests on the ''[[Historia de Sancto Cuthberto]]'', for which see Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', p. 64. The question is discussed by Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 142–144; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 332–333.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report of the battle in the ''Annals of Ulster'' says that none of the kings or [[mormaer]]s among the men of Alba were killed. This is the first surviving use of the word mormaer; other than the knowledge that Constantine's kingdom had its own bishop or bishops and royal villas, this is the only hint to the institutions of the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;For Mormaers, see Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp 342–350; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 219–220. For the later institutions of the kingdom of Alba, see {{citation |last=Barrow |first=G. W. S. |authorlink=G. W. S. Barrow |title=The Kingdom of the Scots. Government, Church and Society from the eleventh to the fourteenth century |edition=2nd |year=2003 |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=0-7486-1803-1 |pages=1–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Corbridge, Ragnall enjoyed only a short respite. In the south, Alfred's son Edward had rapidly secured control of Mercia and had a [[burh]] constructed at [[Bakewell]] in the [[Peak District]] from which his armies could easily strike north. An army from Dublin led by Ragnall's kinsman Sihtric struck at north-western Mercia in 919, but in 920 or 921 Edward met with Ragnall and other kings. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' states that these king &quot;chose Edward as father and lord&quot;. Among the other kings present were Constantine, Ealdred son of Eadwulf, and the king of Strathclyde, either [[Dyfnwal II of Strathclyde|Dyfnwal&amp;nbsp;II]] or, more probably, [[Owen I of Strathclyde|Owen&amp;nbsp;I]]. Here, again, a new term appears in the record, the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' for the first time using the word ''scottas'', from which Scots derives, to describe the inhabitants of Constantine's kingdom in its report of these events.&lt;ref&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 333–335; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 104, Ms. A, s.a. 924; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 145–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward died in 924. His realms appear to have been divided with the West Saxons recognising [[Ælfweard of Wessex|Ælfweard]] while the Mercians chose [[Æthelstan]] who had been raised at Æthelflæd's court. Ælfweard died within weeks of his father and Æthelstan was inaugurated as king of all of Edward's lands in 925.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, &quot;Rulers of the English&quot;, p. 514; Miller, &quot;Æthelstan&quot;; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Æthelstan==
By 926 Sihtric had evidently acknowledged Æthelstan as over-king, adopting Christianity and marrying a sister of Æthelstan at Tamworth. Within the year he may have abandoned his new faith and repudiated his wife, but before Æthelstan and he could fight, Sihtric died suddenly in 927. His kinsman, perhaps brother, [[Gofraid ua Ímair|Gofraid]], who had remained as his deputy in [[Dublin]], came from Ireland to take power in York, but failed. Æthelstan moved quickly, seizing much of Northumbria. In less than a decade, the kingdom of the English had become by far the greatest power in Britain and Ireland, perhaps stretching as far north as the [[Firth of Forth]].&lt;ref&gt;Higham, ''Kingdom of Northumbria'', pp. 186–190; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 339–340; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp.148–151; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 105 and 107, Ms. D, s.a. 925, 926, Ms. E, F, s.a. 927.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John of Worcester]]'s chronicle suggests that Æthelstan faced opposition from Constantine, from Owain of Strathclyde, and from the Welsh kings. [[William of Malmesbury]] writes that Gofraid, together with Sihtric's young son [[Olaf Cuaran]] fled north and received refuge from Constantine, which led to war with Æthelstan. A meeting at [[Eamont Bridge]] on {{Nowrap|12 July}} 927 was sealed by an agreement that Constantine, Owen of Strathclyde, [[Hywel Dda]], and Ealdred would &quot;renounce all idolatry&quot;: that is, they would not ally with the Viking kings. William states that Æthelstan stood godfather to a son of Constantine, probably [[Indulf of Scotland|Indulf]] (Ildulb mac Constantín), during the conference.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', pp. 66–67; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p.107, Ms. D, s.a. 926; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 339–340; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp 150–152 and 192–193; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 201–202; Miller, &quot;Æthelstan&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Æthelstan followed up his advances in the north by securing the recognition of the Welsh kings.&lt;ref&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 340–341.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next seven years, the record of events in the north is blank. Æthelstan's court was attended by the Welsh kings, but not by Constantine or Owen of Strathclyde. This absence of record means that Æthelstan's reasons for marching north against Constantine in 934 are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 161–165. The previous year had seen the death of Æthelstan's brother [[Edwin, son of Edward the Elder|Edwin]], perhaps drowned on the king's orders; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 107, Ms. E, s.a. 933 and note 11; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 355–356. The following year Gofraid died and was succeeded by his son Amlaíb, Constantine's son-in-law; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 934. Finally, the ''Annals of Clonmacnoise'' report the death of &quot;Adulf mcEtulfe, king of the North Saxons&quot; in the same year as Æthelstan's campaign; Woolf suggests that this may represent Ealdred, or some other son of Eadulf, ruling in Northumbria.&lt;/ref&gt;

Æthelstan's campaign is reported by in brief by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', and later chroniclers such as John of Worcester, William of Malmesbury, [[Henry of Huntingdon]], and [[Symeon of Durham]] add detail to that bald account. Æthelstan's army began gathering at [[Winchester]] by {{Nowrap|28 May}} 934, and reached [[Nottingham]] by {{Nowrap|7 June}}. He was accompanied by many leaders, including the Welsh kings Hywel Dda, Idwal Foel, and [[Morgan ab Owain]]. From Mercia the army went north, stopping at [[Chester-le-Street]], before resuming the march accompanied by a fleet of ships. Owen of Strathclyde was defeated and Symeon states that the army went as far north as Dunnottar and Fortriu, while the fleet is said to have raided [[Caithness]], by which a much larger area, including [[Sutherland]], is probably intended. It is unlikely that Constantine's personal authority extended so far north, and while the attacks may have been directed at his allies, they may also have been simple looting expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 107, Ms. D, s.a. 934; Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', pp. 67–69; Miller, &quot;Æthelstan&quot;; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 342; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 160–166; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Annals of Clonmacnoise]]'' state that &quot;the Scottish men compelled [Æthelstan] to return without any great victory&quot;, while Henry of Huntingdon claims that the English faced no opposition. A negotiated settlement may have ended matters: according to John of Worcester, a son of Constantine was given as a hostage to Æthelstan and Constantín himself accompanied the English king on his return south. He witnessed a charter with Æthelstan at [[Buckingham]] on {{Nowrap|13 September}} 934 in which he is described as ''subregulus'', that is a king acknowledging Æthelstan's overlordship.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 426; Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', pp. 67–69; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 166–168; {{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&amp;type=charter&amp;id=426 |title=Charter S 426 |last=Miller |first=Sean |work=Anglo-Saxons.net |accessdate=2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Constantine was again in England at Æthelstan's court, this time at [[Cirencester]] where he appears as a witness, appearing as the first of several subject kings, followed by Owen of Strathclyde and Hywel Dda, who subscribed to the diploma.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 166–168; only a part of this charter survives, see {{cite web |url=http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/kemble/pelteret/Lsp/Lsp%2011.htm |accessdate=2007-11-28 |title=Charter S 1792 |work=Anglo-Saxon Charters Website }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Christmas]] of 935, Owen of Strathclyde was once more at Æthelstan's court along with the Welsh kings, but Constantine was not. His return to England less than two years later would be in very different circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brunanburh and after==
Following his disappearance from Æthelstan's court after 935, there is no further report of Constantine until 937. In that year, together with Owen of Strathclyde and [[Olaf III Guthfrithson|Olaf Guthfrithson]] of Dublin, Constantine invaded England. The resulting [[battle of Brunanburh]]—''Dún Brunde''—is reported in the ''Annals of Ulster'' as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;a great battle, lamentable and terrible was cruelly fought&amp;nbsp;... in which fell uncounted thousands of the Northmen.&amp;nbsp;... And on the other side, a multitude of Saxons fell; but Æthelstan, the king of the Saxons, obtained a great victory.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 428–429; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 937.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The battle was remembered in England a generation later as &quot;the Great Battle&quot;. When reporting the battle, the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' abandons its usual terse style in favour of a heroic poem vaunting the great victory. In this the &quot;hoary&quot; Constantine, by now around 60 years of age, is said to have lost a son in the battle, a claim which the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' confirms. The ''Annals of Clonmacnoise'' give his name as Cellach. For all its fame, the site of the battle is uncertain and several sites have been advanced, with [[Bromborough]] on the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] the most favoured location.&lt;ref&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 106–110, Ms. A, s.a. 937; Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', pp. 69–73; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 429; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', 168–173; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp 203–204; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 342–343; Scragg, &quot;''Battle of Brunanburh''&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brunanburh, for all that it had been a famous and bloody battle, settled nothing. On {{Nowrap|27 October}} 939 Æthelstan, the &quot;pillar of the dignity of the western world&quot; in the words of the ''Annals of Ulster'', died at [[Malmesbury]]. He was succeeded by his brother [[Edmund I of England|Edmund]], then aged 18. Æthelstan's empire, seemingly made safe by the victory of Brunanburh, collapsed in little more than a year from his death when Amlaíb returned from Ireland and seized Northumbria and the Mercian Danelaw. Edmund spent the remainder of Constantín's reign rebuilding the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 174; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 356–359; Higham, ''Kingdom of Northumbria'', p. 193; Blair, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 87–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Constantine's last years as king there is only the meagre record of the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba''. The death of Æthelstan is reported, as are two others. The first of these, in 938, is that of [[Dubacan of Angus|Dubacan]], [[mormaer of Angus]] or son of the mormaer. Unlike the report of 918, on this occasion the title mormaer is attached to a geographical area, but it is unknown whether the Angus of 938 was in any way similar to the later mormaerdom or earldom.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 175 and 211–212.&lt;/ref&gt; The second death, entered with that of Æthelstan, is that of Eochaid mac Ailpín, who may, from his name, have been a kinsman of Constantín.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abdication and posterity==
By the early 940s Constantine was an old man, perhaps more than 70 years of age. The kingdom of Alba was too new to be said to have a customary rule of succession, but Pictish and Irish precedents favoured an adult successor descended from Kenneth MacAlpin. Constantine's surviving son [[Indulf of Scotland|Indulf]], probably baptised in 927, would have been too young to be a serious candidate for the kingship in the early 940s, and the obvious heir was Constantine's nephew, [[Malcolm I of Scotland|Malcolm&amp;nbsp;I]]. As Malcolm was born no later than 901, by the 940s he was no longer a young man, and may have been impatient. Willingly or not—the 11th-century ''[[Prophecy of Berchán]]'', a verse history in the form of a supposed prophecy, states that it was not a voluntary decision—Constantine abdicated in 943 and entered a monastery, leaving the kingdom to Malcolm.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 175; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 444–448; Broun, &quot;Constantine&amp;nbsp;II&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his retirement may have been involuntary, the ''Life'' of [[Cathróe of Metz]] and the ''Prophecy of Berchán'' portray Constantine as a devout king. The monastery which Constantine retired to, and where he is said to have been [[abbot]], was probably that of [[St Andrews]]. This had been refounded in his reign and given to the reforming [[Céli Dé]] (Culdee) movement. The Céli Dé were subsequently to be entrusted with many monasteries throughout the kingdom of Alba until replaced in the 12th century by new orders imported from France.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 431–444; Broun, &quot;Constantine&amp;nbsp;II&quot;; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 175; MacQuarrie, ''Saints of Scotland'', pp. 199–210. The ''Prophecy of Berchán'' describes Constantine's &quot;fair, long reign&quot; as a time &quot;with fruit upon slender branches, with ale, with music, with good cheer; with corn, with milk, with nimble cattle; with pride, with fortune, with [worth]&quot;; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 447–448.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven years later the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' says:&lt;blockquote&gt;[Malcolm&amp;nbsp;I] plundered the English as far as the [[river Tees]], and he seized a multitude of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, as I have said.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 452–453.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 178–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine's death in 952 is recorded by the Irish annals, who enter it among ecclesiastics. His son Indulf would become king on Malcolm's death. The last of Constantine's certain descendants to be king in Alba was a great-grandson, [[Constantine III of Scotland|Constantine&amp;nbsp;III]] (Constantín mac Cuiléin). Another son had died at Brunanburh, and, according to John of Worcester, Amlaíb mac Gofraid was married to a daughter of Constantine. It is possible that Constantine had other children, but like the name of his wife, or wives, this has not been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 171, 175, and 177; Duncan, ''Kingship of the Scots'', p. 345, table A; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

The kingdom which began to appear in Constantine's reign continued in much the same form until the [[Davidian Revolution]] in the 12th century. As with his ecclestiastical reforms, his political legacy was the creation of a new form of Scottish kingship that lasted for two centuries after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Broun, &quot;Constantine&amp;nbsp;II&quot;. The nature of that kingdom is, however, still a matter of debate, see Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 342–350; {{citation |last=Grant |first=Alexander |contribution=The Construction of the Early Scottish State |title=The Medieval State: Essays presented to James Campbell |editor-last=Maddicott |editor-first=J.

'''Constantine the Great''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Valerius Aurelius Constantinus Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Constantine's official imperial title was &lt;small&gt;IMPERATOR CAESAR FLAVIVS CONSTANTINVS PIVS FELIX INVICTVS AVGVSTVS&lt;/small&gt;, ''Imperator Caesar Flavius Constantine Augustus, the pious, the fortunate, the undefeated''. After 312, he added &lt;small&gt;MAXIMVS&lt;/small&gt; (&quot;the greatest&quot;), and after 325 replaced (&quot;undefeated&quot;) with &lt;small&gt;VICTOR&lt;/small&gt;, as ''invictus'' reminded many of [[Sol Invictus]], the Sun God.&lt;/ref&gt; c. 27 February 272&lt;ref name=birthdate&gt;Birth dates vary but most modern historians use c. 272&quot;. Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 59.&lt;/ref&gt; – 22 May 337), also known as '''Constantine I''' or '''Saint Constantine''',&lt;ref&gt;Among [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Byzantine Catholic]] Christians. The [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] liturgical calendar, observed by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic Churches of Byzantine rite]], lists both Constantine and his mother [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]] as saints. Although he is not included in the [[Latin Rite|Latin Church's]] list of saints, which does recognise several other Constantines as saints, he is revered under the title &quot;The Great&quot; for his contributions to [[Christianity]].&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Roman Emperor]] from 306 to 337. Well known for being the first Roman emperor to [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|convert]] to [[Christianity]],{{#tag:ref|With the possible exception of [[Philip the Arab]] (r. 244–49).

The foremost general of his time, Constantine defeated the emperors [[Maxentius]] and [[Licinius]] during civil wars. He also fought successfully against the [[Franks]], [[Alamanni]], [[Visigoths]], and [[Sarmatians]] during his reign – even resettling parts of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]] which had been abandoned during the previous century. Constantine also transformed the ancient Greek colony of [[Byzantium]] into a new imperial residence, [[Constantinople]], which would be the capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] for over one thousand years. He is hence often considered the first in the line of [[Byzantine emperors]].

== Sources==
As the emperor who used his government to [[Constantine I and Christianity|empower Christianity]] throughout the [[Roman Empire]] and moved the capital to the banks of the [[Bosporus]], Constantine was a ruler of major historical importance, but he has always been a controversial figure.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The fluctuations in Constantine's reputation reflect the nature of the ancient sources for his reign. These are abundant and detailed,&lt;ref&gt;Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 14; Cameron, 90–91; Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; but have been strongly influenced by the official propaganda of the period,&lt;ref&gt;Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 23–25; Cameron, 90–91; Southern, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; and are often one-sided.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 90; Southern, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no surviving histories or biographies dealing with Constantine's life and rule.&lt;ref&gt;Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 14; Corcoran, ''Empire of the Tetrarchs'', 1; Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest replacement is [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s ''Vita Constantini'', a work that is a mixture of [[eulogy]] and [[hagiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 265–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Written between 335 and circa 339,&lt;ref&gt;Drake, &quot;What Eusebius Knew,&quot; 21.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Vita'' extols Constantine's moral and religious virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.11; Odahl, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Vita'' creates a contentiously positive image of Constantine,&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Introduction&quot; (CC), 5; Storch, 145–55.&lt;/ref&gt; and modern historians have frequently challenged its reliability.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 265–71; Cameron, 90–92; Cameron and Hall, 4–6; Elliott, &quot;Eusebian Frauds in the &quot;Vita Constantini&quot;&quot;, 162–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The fullest secular life of Constantine is the anonymous ''Origo Constantini''.&lt;ref&gt;Lieu and Montserrat, 39; Odahl, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; A work of uncertain date,&lt;ref&gt;Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 26; Lieu and Montserrat, 40; Odahl, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Origo'' focuses on military and political events, to the neglect of cultural and religious matters.&lt;ref&gt;Lieu and Montserrat, 40; Odahl, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[epitome]]s of [[Aurelius Victor]] (''De Caesaribus''), [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] (''Breviarium''), [[Festus (historian)|Festus]] (''Breviarium''), and the anonymous author of the ''[[Epitome de Caesaribus]]'' offer compressed secular political and military histories of the period. Although not Christian, the epitomes paint a favorable image of Constantine, but omit reference to Constantine's religious policies.&lt;ref&gt;Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 27–28; Lieu and Montserrat, 2–6; Odahl, 6–7; Warmington, 166–67.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'', a collection of [[panegyric]]s from the late third and early fourth centuries, provide valuable information on the politics and ideology of the tetrarchic period and the early life of Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 24; Odahl, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary architecture, like the [[Arch of Constantine]] in Rome and palaces in [[Gamzigrad]] and [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]],&lt;ref&gt;Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 20–21; Johnson, &quot;Architecture of Empire&quot; (CC), 288–91; Odahl, 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epigraphy|epigraphic]] remains, and the [[coin]]age of the era complement the literary sources.&lt;ref&gt;Bleckmann, &quot;Sources for the History of Constantine&quot; (CC), 17–21; Odahl, 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Constantian Dynasty, the children of Constantius.png|thumb|left|Constantine's parents and siblings. Dates in square brackets indicate the possession of minor titles, like &quot;[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]&quot;.]]

Constantine, named Flavius Valerius Constantinus, was born in the military city of Naissus, [[Moesia]], in present-day [[Niš]], [[Serbia]], on the [[February 27|27th of February]] of an uncertain year,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3, 39–42; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 17; Odahl, 15; Pohlsander, &quot;Constantine I&quot;; Southern, 169, 341.&lt;/ref&gt; probably near 272.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 39–42; Elliott, &quot;Constantine's Conversion,&quot; 425–6; Elliott, &quot;Eusebian Frauds,&quot; 163; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 17; Jones, 13–14; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 59; Odahl, 16; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 14; Rodgers, 238; Wright, 495, 507.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Constantius Chlorus|Flavius Constantius]], a native of Moesia (later [[Dacia ripensis|Dacia Ripensis]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;CTCR&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 59–60; Odahl, 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius was a tolerant and politically skilled man.&lt;ref&gt;''Panegyrici Latini'' 8(5), 9(4); Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 8.7; Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.13.3; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 13, 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine probably spent little time with his father.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius was an officer in the Roman army in 272, part of the Emperor [[Aurelian]]'s imperial bodyguard. Constantius advanced through the ranks, earning the [[Roman governor|governorship]] of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] from Emperor [[Diocletian]], another of Aurelian's companions from [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]], in 284 or 285.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTCR&quot;/&gt; Constantine's mother was [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]], It is uncertain whether she was legally married to Constantius or merely his concubine.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 39–40; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 17; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 59, 83; Odahl, 16; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 285, Diocletian declared [[Maximian]], another colleague from [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]], his [[co-emperor]]. Each emperor would have his own court, his own military and administrative faculties, and each would rule with a separate [[praetorian prefect]] as chief lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8–14; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot; (CC), 41–54; Odahl, 46–50; Treadgold, 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximian ruled in the West, from his capitals at [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]], [[Italy]]) or Augusta Treverorum ([[Trier]], [[Germany]]), while Diocletian ruled in the East, from [[Nicomedia]] ([[İzmit]], [[Turkey]]). The division was merely pragmatic: the Empire was called &quot;indivisible&quot; in official panegyric,&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, 70; Potter, 283; Williams, 49, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; and both emperors could move freely throughout the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 283; Williams, 49, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In 288, Maximian appointed Constantius to serve as his praetorian prefect in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]]. Constantius left Helena to marry Maximian's stepdaughter [[Flavia Maximiana Theodora|Theodora]] in 288 or 289.&lt;ref name=&quot;marriage&quot;&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 20; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 59–60; Odahl, 47, 299; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Diocletian divided the Empire again in 293, appointing two [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]s (junior emperors) to rule over further subdivisions of East and West. Each would be subordinate to their respective [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] (senior emperor) but would act with supreme authority in his assigned lands. This system would later be called the [[Tetrarchy]]. Diocletian's first appointee for the office of Caesar was Constantius; his second was [[Galerius]], a native of Felix Romuliana. According to Lactantius, Galerius was a brutal, animalistic man. Although he shared the paganism of Rome's aristocracy, he seemed to them an alien figure, a semi-barbarian.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 7.1; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 13, 290.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March, Constantius was promoted to the office of Caesar, and dispatched to Gaul to fight the rebels [[Carausius]] and [[Allectus]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3, 8; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot; (CC), 40–41; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 20; Odahl, 46–47; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 8–9, 14; Treadgold, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of meritocratic overtones, the Tetrarchy retained vestiges of hereditary privilege,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8–9; Corcoran, &quot;Before Constantine&quot; (CC), 42–43, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and Constantine became the prime candidate for future appointment as Caesar as soon as his father took the position. Constantine left the Balkans for the court of Diocletian, where he lived as his father's heir presumptive.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 59–60; Odahl, 56–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the East===
Constantine received a formal education at Diocletian's court, where he learned Latin literature, Greek, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 73–74; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 60; Odahl, 72, 301.&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural environment in Nicomedia was open, fluid and socially mobile, and Constantine could mix with intellectuals both pagan and Christian. He may have attended the lectures of Lactantius, a Christian scholar of Latin in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 47, 73–74; Fowden, &quot;Between Pagans and Christians,&quot; 175–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Diocletian did not completely trust Constantius — none of the Tetrarchs fully trusted their colleagues — Constantine was held as something of a hostage, a tool to ensure Constantius' best behaviour. Constantine was nonetheless a prominent member of the court: he fought for Diocletian and Galerius in Asia, and served in a variety of [[tribune|tribunates]]; he campaigned against barbarians on the Danube in 296, and fought the Persians under Diocletian in Syria (297) and under Galerius in Mesopotamia (298–99).&lt;ref&gt;Constantine, ''Oratio ad Sanctorum Coetum'', 16.2; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 29–30; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 60; Odahl, 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; By late 305, he had become a tribune of the first order, a ''tribunus ordinis primi''.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 29; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 61; Odahl, 72–74, 306; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15. Contra: J. Moreau, ''Lactance: &quot;De la mort des persécuteurs&quot;'', ''Sources Chrétiennes'' 39 (1954): 313; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine had returned to Nicomedia from the eastern front by the spring of 303, in time to witness the beginnings of Diocletian's &quot;[[Diocletianic Persecution|Great Persecution]]&quot;, the most severe [[Persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians]] in Roman history.&lt;ref&gt;Constantine, ''Oratio ad Sanctorum Coetum'' 25; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 30; Odahl, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 302, Diocletian and Galerius sent a messenger to the [[oracle]] of [[Apollo]] at [[Didyma]] with an inquiry about Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 10.6–11; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 21; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 35–36; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 24; Odahl, 67; Potter, 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine could recall his presence at the palace when the messenger returned, when Diocletian accepted his court's demands for universal persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 2.49–52; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 21; Odahl, 67, 73, 304; Potter, 338.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 February 303, Diocletian ordered the destruction of Nicomedia's new church, condemned its scriptures to the flame, and had its treasures seized. In the months that followed, churches and scriptures were destroyed, Christians were deprived of official ranks, and priests were imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 22–25; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 24–30; Odahl, 67–69; Potter, 337.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is unlikely that Constantine played any role in the persecution.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; In his later writings he would attempt to present himself as an opponent of Diocletian's &quot;sanguinary edicts&quot; against the &quot;worshippers of God&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Oratio ad Sanctorum Coetum'' 25; Odahl, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; but nothing indicates that he opposed it effectively at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, &quot;The Impact of Constantine on Christianity&quot; (CC), 126; Elliott, &quot;Constantine's Conversion,&quot; 425–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no contemporary Christian challenged Constantine for his inaction during the persecutions, it remained a political liability throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, &quot;The Impact of Constantine on Christianity&quot; (CC), 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 305, Diocletian, as a result of a debilitating sickness taken in the winter of 304–5, announced his resignation. In a parallel ceremony in Milan, Maximian did the same.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25–27; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 60; Odahl, 69–72; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15; Potter, 341–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Lactantius states that Galerius manipulated the weakened Diocletian into resigning, and forced him to accept Galerius' allies in the imperial succession. According to Lactantius, the crowd listening to Diocletian's resignation speech believed, until the very last moment, that Diocletian would choose Constantine and [[Maxentius]] (Maximian's son) as his successors.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 19.2–6; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 26; Potter, 342.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not to be: Constantius and Galerius were promoted to Augusti, while [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] and [[Maximinus|Maximin]] were appointed their Caesars respectively. Constantine and Maxentius were ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 60–61; Odahl, 72–74; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the ancient sources detail plots that Galerius made on Constantine's life in the months following Diocletian's abdication. They assert that Galerius assigned Constantine to lead an advance unit in a cavalry charge through a swamp on the middle [[Danube]], made him enter into single combat with a lion, and attempted to kill him in hunts and wars. Constantine always emerged victorious: the lion emerged from the contest in a poorer condition than Constantine; Constantine returned to Nicomedia from the Danube with a Sarmatian captive to drop at Galerius' feet.&lt;ref&gt;''Origo'' 4; Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 24.3–9; Praxagoras fr. 1.2; Aurelius Victor 40.2–3; ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' 41.2; Zosimus 2.8.3; Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.21; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 61; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 32; Odahl, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; It is uncertain how much these tales can be trusted.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the West===
Constantine recognized the implicit danger in remaining at Galerius' court, where he was held as a virtual hostage. His career depended on being rescued by his father in the west. Constantius was quick to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late spring or early summer of 305, Constantius requested leave for his son, to help him campaign in Britain. After a long evening of drinking, Galerius granted the request. Constantine's later propaganda describes how Constantine fled the court in the night, before Galerius could change his mind. He rode from [[Cursus publicus|post-house]] to post-house at high speed, [[hamstringing]] every horse in his wake.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 39–40; Lenski, &quot;Reign of Constantine&quot; (CC), 61; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 32; Odahl, 77; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15–16; Potter, 344–5; Southern, 169–70, 341.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Galerius awoke the following morning, Constantine had fled too far to be caught.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine joined his father in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], at Bononia ([[Boulogne-su
