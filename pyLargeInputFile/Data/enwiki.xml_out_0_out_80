{{Optical disc authoring}}
The '''Compact Disc''' (also known as a '''CD''') is an [[optical disc]] used to store [[data (computing)|digital data]]. It was originally developed to store and playback sound recordings exclusively, but later expanded to encompass data storage ([[CD-ROM]]), write-once audio and data storage ([[CD-R]]), rewritable media ([[CD-RW]]), Video Compact Discs ([[VCD]]), Super Video Compact Discs ([[SVCD]]), PhotoCD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced CD. Audio CDs and audio [[CD player]]s have been commercially available since October 1982.

Standard CDs have a diameter of {{convert|120|mm|in}} and can hold up to 80 minutes of uncompressed audio (700&amp;nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] of data). The [[Mini CD]] has various diameters ranging from {{convert|60|to|80|mm|in}}; they are sometimes used for CD singles, storing up to 24 minutes of audio or delivering [[device driver]]s.

CD-ROMs and CD-Rs remain widely used technologies in the [[computer industry]]. The CD and its extensions are successful: in 2004, worldwide sales of CD audio, CD-ROM, and CD-R reached about 30 billion discs. By 2007, 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950845.stm |title=Compact Disc Hits 25th birthday |publisher=''[[BBC News]]'' |date=2007-08-17 |accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compact Discs are increasingly being replaced or supplemented by other forms of digital distribution and storage, such as downloading and [[flash drives]], with audio CD sales dropping nearly 50% from their peak in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/business/media/31bestbuy.html | work=The New York Times | title=As CD Sales Wane, Music Retailers Diversify | first=Joseph | last=Plambeck | date=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Confusing|section|date=January 2010}}
The Compact Disc is a spin-off of [[Laserdisc]] technology. [[Sony]] first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in September 1976. In September 1978 they demonstrated an optical digital audio disc with a 150 minute playing time, and with specifications of 44,056&amp;nbsp;Hz sampling rate, 16-bit linear resolution, [[Cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon coding|cross-interleaved]] [[error correction]] code, that were similar to those of the Compact Disc introduced in 1982. Technical details of Sony's digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd [[Audio Engineering Society|AES]] Convention, held on March 13–16, 1979, in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name=SonyHistorical&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2912 | title = A Long Play Digital Audio Disc System | author =  | publisher = AES | date =  | accessdate = 2009-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 8, 1979 [[Philips]] publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called &quot;Philips Introduce Compact Disc&quot;&lt;ref name=BBC6950933&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950933.stm | title = How the CD Was Developed | author =  | publisher = ''[[BBC News]]'' | date = 2007-08-17 | accessdate = 2007-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Eindhoven]], [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=PhilipsHistorical&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philipsmuseumeindhoven.nl/phe/products/e_cd.htm | title = Philips Compact Disc | author =  | publisher = Philips | date =  | accessdate = 2009-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 6, 2009, Philips received an IEEE Milestone with the following citation: &quot;On 8 March 1979, N.V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken demonstrated for the international press a Compact Disc Audio Player. The demonstration showed that it is possible by using digital optical recording and playback to reproduce audio signals with superb stereo quality. This research at Philips established the technical standard for digital optical recording systems.&quot;&lt;ref name=IEEE_CD_Milestone&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Compact_Disc_Audio_Player,_1979 | title = IEEE CD Milestone | author =  | publisher = IEEE Global History Network | date =  | accessdate = 2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony executive [[Norio Ohga]], who later became the CEO and chairman of Sony, was convinced of the format's commercial potential, and pushed further development despite widespread skepticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohgaobituary&quot;&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1979, [[Sony]] and [[Philips Consumer Electronics]] (Philips) set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. Led by [[Kees Schouhamer Immink]] and [[Toshitada Doi]], the research pushed forward [[laser]] and [[optical disc]] technology that began independently by Philips and Sony in 1977 and 1975, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC6950933&quot; /&gt; After a year of experimentation and discussion, the taskforce produced the ''[[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Red Book]]'', the Compact Disc standard. Philips contributed the general [[manufacturing]] [[Industrial process|process]], based on video [[Laserdisc]] technology. Philips also contributed [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] (EFM), which offers both a long playing time and a high resilience against disc defects such as scratches and fingerprints, while Sony contributed the [[error-correction]] method, [[Cross-Interleaved Reed-Solomon Coding|CIRC]]. The ''Compact Disc Story'',&lt;ref name=Immink&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.exp-math.uni-essen.de/~immink/pdf/cdstory.htm | title = The CD Story | author = Kees A.

The first test CD was pressed in [[Langenhagen]] near [[Hannover]], [[Germany]], by the Polydor Pressing Operations plant. The disc contained a recording of [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''Eine Alpensinfonie'' (in [[English language|English]], ''[[An Alpine Symphony]]''), played by the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] and conducted by [[Herbert von Karajan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url = http://www.research.philips.com/newscenter/dossier/optrec/firstcds.html | title = Optical Recording | publisher = Royal Philips Electronics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first public demonstration was on the [[BBC]] television program ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' when [[The Bee Gees]]' album ''[[Living Eyes (Bee Gees album)|Living Eyes]]'' (1981) was played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bilyeu|first = Melinda|coauthors = Hector Cook, Andrew Môn Hughes |publisher = Omnibus Press| location = |year = 2004| isbn = 9781844490578| title = The Bee Gees:tales of the brothers Gibb| page = 519}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1982 the real pressing was ready to begin in the new factory, not far from the place where [[Emil Berliner]] had produced his first gramophone record 93 years earlier. By now, Deutsche Grammophon, Berliner's company and the publisher of the Strauss recording, had become a part of PolyGram. The first CD to be manufactured at the new factory was ''[[The Visitors (ABBA album)|The Visitors]]'' (1981) by [[ABBA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=7304|title=And 25 Years Ago Philips Introduced the CD|publisher=''GeekZone''|accessdate=2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first album to be ''released'' on CD was [[Billy Joel|Billy Joel's]] ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]'', that reached the market alongside Sony's [[Compact Disc player|CD player]] CDP-101 on October 1, 1982 in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-20/h5.html|title=Sony History: A Great Invention 100 Years On|publisher=[[Sony]]|accessdate=2008-11-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080802133849/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-20/h5.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early the following year on March 2, 1983 CD players and discs (16 titles from CBS Records) were released in the United States and other markets. This event is often seen as the &quot;Big Bang&quot; of the digital audio revolution. The new audio disc was enthusiastically received, especially in the early-adopting [[European classical music|classical music]] and [[audiophile]] communities and its handling quality received particular praise. As the price of players gradually came down, the CD began to gain popularity in the larger popular and rock music markets. The first artist to sell a million copies on CD was Dire Straits, with its 1985 album ''[[Brothers in Arms (Dire Straits album)|Brothers in Arms]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The first major artist to have his entire catalogue converted to CD was [[David Bowie]], whose 15 studio albums were made available by [[RCA Records]] in February 1985, along with four Greatest Hits albums.&lt;ref&gt;The New Schwann Record &amp; Tape Guide Volume 37 No. 2 February 1985&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, 400 million CDs were manufactured by 50 pressing plants around the world.&lt;ref&gt;MAC Audio News. No. 178, November 1989. pp 19-21 Glenn Baddeley. ''November 1989 News Update''. Melbourne Audio Club Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CD was planned to be the successor of the [[gramophone record]] for playing music, rather than primarily as a data storage medium. From its origins as a musical format, CDs have grown to encompass other applications. In June 1985, the computer readable [[CD-ROM]] (read-only memory) and, in 1990, [[CD-R]]ecordable were introduced, also developed by both Sony and Philips.&lt;ref&gt;The world's first CD-R was made by the Japanese firm [[Taiyo Yuden|Taiyo Yuden Co., Ltd.]] in 1988 as part of the joint Philips-Sony development effort.&lt;/ref&gt; The CD's compact format has largely replaced the audio [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] player in new automobile applications, and recordable CDs are an alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without defects introduced in compression used in other digital recording methods. Other newer video formats such as DVD and Blu-ray have used the same form factor as CDs, and video players can usually play audio CDs as well. With the advent of the [[MP3]] in the 2000s, the sales of CDs has dropped in seven out of the last eight years. In 2008, large label CD sales dropped 20%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Ethan|last= Smith|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Music Sales Decline for Seventh Time in Eight Years: Digital Downloads Can't Offset 20% Plunge in CD Sales |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123075988836646491.html?mod=rss_whats_news_technology&amp;mg=com-wsj |work= |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=January 2, 2009 |accessdate=4 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although independent and DIY music sales may be tracking better according to figures released March 30, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiemusicstop.wordpress.com/2009/04/01/cd-baby-payouts-surge/ |title=CD Baby Payouts Surge « Indie Music Stop |publisher=Indiemusicstop.wordpress.com |date=2009-03-30 |accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A layer of lacquer protects the shiny layer.&lt;br /&gt;D. Artwork is [[screen printed]] on the top of the disc.&lt;br /&gt;E. A laser beam reads the CD and is reflected back to a sensor, which converts it into electronic data]]

A CD is made from {{convert|1.2|mm|in}} thick, [[polycarbonate]] plastic and weighs 15–20&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cd-testing.com/#i17|title=Q. How Do You Calculate Moment of Inertia?|accessdate=2009-08-19|quote=a typical disc with ... weight of 15 grams ... maximum allowed weight (20g)}}{{Dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the center outward, components are: the center spindle hole (15&amp;nbsp;mm), the first-transition area (clamping ring), the clamping area (stacking ring), the second-transition area (mirror band), the program (data) area, and the rim. The inner program area occupies a radius from 25 to 58&amp;nbsp;mm

A thin layer of aluminium or, more rarely, gold is applied to the surface making it reflective. The metal is protected by a film of lacquer normally [[spin coated]] directly on the reflective layer. The label is printed on the lacquer layer, usually by [[screen printing]] or [[offset printing]].

CD data are stored as a series of tiny indentations known as &quot;pits&quot;, encoded in a spiral track moulded into the top of the polycarbonate layer. The areas between pits are known as &quot;lands&quot;. Each pit is approximately 100&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] deep by 500&amp;nbsp;nm wide, and varies from 850&amp;nbsp;nm to 3.5&amp;nbsp;[[Micrometre|µm]] in length. The distance between the tracks, the pitch, is 1.6&amp;nbsp;µm.

Scanning velocity is 1.2–1.4&amp;nbsp;m/s ([[constant linear velocity]])&amp;nbsp;– equivalent to approximately 500 rpm at the inside of the disc, and approximately 200 rpm at the outside edge. (A disc played from beginning to end slows down during playback.)

The program area is 86.05&amp;nbsp;cm² and the length of the recordable spiral is (86.05&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;1.6&amp;nbsp;µm)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5.38&amp;nbsp;km. With a scanning speed of 1.2&amp;nbsp;m/s, the playing time is 74 minutes, or 650&amp;nbsp;MB of data on a CD-ROM. A disc with data packed slightly more densely is tolerated by most players (though some old ones fail). Using a linear velocity of 1.2&amp;nbsp;m/s and a track pitch of 1.5&amp;nbsp;µm yields a playing time of 80 minutes, or a data capacity of 700&amp;nbsp;MB. Even higher capacities on non-standard discs (up to 99 minutes) are available at least as recordables, but generally the tighter the tracks are squeezed, the worse the compatibility.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

A CD is read by focusing a 780&amp;nbsp;nm [[wavelength]] ([[near infrared]]) [[semiconductor laser]] through the bottom of the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected. By measuring the intensity change with a [[photodiode]], the data can be read from the disc.

The pits and lands themselves do not directly represent the zeros and ones of [[binary data]]. Instead, [[non-return-to-zero, inverted]] encoding is used: a change from pit to land or land to pit indicates a one, while no change indicates a series of zeros. There must be at least two and no more than ten zeros between each one, which is defined by the length of the pit. This in turn is decoded by reversing the [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the [[Cross-Interleaved Reed-Solomon Coding]], finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc.

CDs are susceptible to damage from both normal use and environmental exposure. Pits are much closer to the label side of a disc, enabling defects and contaminants on the clear side to be out of focus during playback. Consequently, CDs are more likely to suffer damage on the label side of the disk. Scratches on the clear side can be repaired by refilling them with similar refractive plastic, or by careful polishing.

The digital data on a CD begins at the center of the disc and proceeds toward the edge, which allows adaptation to the different size formats available. Standard CDs are available in two sizes. By far, the most common is {{convert|120|mm|in}} in diameter, with a 74- or 80-minute audio capacity and a 650 or 700&amp;nbsp;MB data capacity. This capacity was reportedly specified by Sony executive [[Norio Ohga]] so as to be able to contain the entirety of [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] on one disc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohgaobituary&quot;/&gt;This diameter has been adopted by subsequent formats, including [[Super Audio CD]], [[DVD]], [[HD DVD]], and [[Blu-ray Disc]]. 80&amp;nbsp;mm discs (&quot;[[Mini CD]]s&quot;) were originally designed for CD [[single (music)|singles]] and can hold up to 24 minutes of music or 210&amp;nbsp;MB of data but never became popular.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Today, nearly every single is released on a 120&amp;nbsp;mm CD, called a [[Maxi single]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;!--these assertions are not supported, let alone referenced, in [[Mini CD]], [[CD single]] or [[Maxi single]]--&gt;

Novelty CDs are also available in numerous shapes and sizes, and are used chiefly for marketing. A common variant is the &quot;business card&quot; CD, a single with portions removed at the top and bottom making the disk resemble a business card.

== Logical formats ==
=== Audio CD ===
{{Main|Red Book (CD standard)}}
The logical format of an audio CD (officially Compact Disc Digital Audio or CD-DA) is described in a document produced by the format's joint creators, Sony and Philips in 1980. The document is known colloquially as the &quot;[[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Red Book]]&quot; after the color of its cover. The format is a two-channel 16-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] encoding at a [[44.1 kHz|44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz]] [[sampling rate]] per channel. [[Four-channel Compact Disc Digital Audio|Four-channel sound]] is an allowable option within the Red Book format, but has never been implemented. [[Monaural]] audio has no existing standard on a Red Book CD; mono-source material is usually presented as two identical channels on a 'stereo' track.

==== 44.1 kHz sample rate ====
{{details|44.1 kHz}}
The selection of the sample rate was based primarily on the need to reproduce the audible frequency range of 20&amp;nbsp;Hz – 20&amp;nbsp;kHz. The [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]] states that a sampling rate of more than twice the maximum frequency of the signal to be recorded is needed, resulting in a required rate of at least 40&amp;nbsp;kHz. The exact sampling rate of 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz was inherited from a method of converting digital audio into an analog video signal for storage on [[U-matic|U-matic video tape]], which was the most affordable way to transfer data from the recording studio to the CD manufacturer at the time the CD specification was being developed. The device that converts an analog audio signal into PCM audio, which in turn is changed into an analog video signal is called a [[PCM adaptor]]. This technology could store six samples (three samples per stereo channel) in a single horizontal line. A standard [[NTSC]] video signal has 245 usable lines per field, and 59.94 fields/s, which works out to be 44,056 samples/s/stereo channel. Similarly, [[PAL]] has 294 lines and 50 fields, which gives 44,100 samples/s/stereo channel. This system could store 14-bit samples with some error correction, or 16-bit samples with almost no error correction.

There was a long debate over the use of 14-bit (Philips) or 16-bit (Sony) [[Quantization (sound processing)|quantization]], and 44,056 or 44,100 samples/s (Sony) or approximately 44,000 samples/s (Philips). When the Sony/Philips task force designed the Compact Disc, Philips had already developed a 14-bit [[Digital-to-analog converter|D/A converter]], but Sony insisted on 16-bit. In the end, 16 bits and 44.1 kilosamples per second prevailed. Philips found a way to produce 16-bit quality using its 14-bit DAC by using four times [[oversampling]].

==== Storage capacity and playing time ====
The partners aimed at a playing time of 60&amp;nbsp;minutes with a disc diameter of 100&amp;nbsp;mm (Sony) or 115&amp;nbsp;mm (Philips).&lt;ref name=Immink2/&gt; Sony vice-president [[Norio Ohga]] suggested extending the capacity to 74 minutes to accommodate [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]]'s recording of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony Number Nine]]'' from the 1951 [[Bayreuth Festival]].&lt;ref name=PhilBeet&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.marantzphilips.nl/The_cd_laser | title = Beethoven's Ninth Symphony of Greater Importance than Technology | author = Philips | accessdate = 2007-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aes.org/historical/store/oralhistory/?code=OHP-016-DVD | title = AES Oral History Project: Kees A.Schouhamer Immink | author = AES | accessdate = 2008-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The additional 14-minute playing time subsequently required changing to a 120&amp;nbsp;mm disc. Kees Immink, Philips' chief engineer, however, denies this, claiming that the increase was motivated by technical considerations, and that even after the increase in size, the Furtwängler recording would not have fit on one of the earliest CDs.&lt;ref name=Immink /&gt;&lt;ref name=Immink2 /&gt; According to a ''[[Sunday Tribune]]'' interview,&lt;ref name=&quot;ferguscassidy&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ferguscassidy.ie/ethos-23-Oct-2005.html | title = Great Lengths | last = Cassidy | first = Fergus | format = reprint | publisher = ''[[Sunday Tribune]]'' | date = 2005-10-23| accessdate = 2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the story is slightly more involved. In 1979, Philips owned [[PolyGram]], one of the world's largest distributors of music. PolyGram had set up a large experimental CD plant in Hannover, Germany, which could produce huge numbers of CDs having, of course, a diameter of 115&amp;nbsp;mm. Sony did not yet have such a facility. If Sony had agreed on the 115-mm disc, Philips would have had a significant competitive edge in the market. Sony decided that something had to be done. The long playing time of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony imposed by [[Norio Ohga|Ohga]] was used to push Philips to accept 120&amp;nbsp;mm, so that Philips' PolyGram lost its edge on disc fabrication.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferguscassidy&quot;/&gt;

The 74-minute playing time of a CD, which was longer than the 20&amp;nbsp;minutes per side&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffmann|first=Frank|coauthors=Ferstler, Howard|title=Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound|publisher=''[[CRC Press]]''|year=2005|page=1289|isbn=041593835X, 9780415938358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldmark, Peter. ''Maverick inventor; My Turbulent Years at CBS.'' New York: Saturday Review Press, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; typical of long-playing (LP) vinyl albums, was often used to the CD's advantage during the early years when CDs and LPs vied for commercial sales. CDs would often be released with one or more bonus tracks, enticing consumers to buy the CD for the extra material. However, attempts to combine double LPs onto one CD occasionally resulted in the opposite situation in which the CD would actually offer fewer tracks than the equivalent LP.

Playing times beyond 74&amp;nbsp;minutes are achieved by decreasing track pitch beyond the original red book standard. Most players can accommodate the more closely spaced data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdrfaq.org/faq03.html#S3-8 |title=CD-Recordable FAQ |author=Andy McFadden |date=2010-01-09 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian Thielemann]]'s live [[Deutsche Grammophon]] recording of [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner's]] [[Symphony No. 5 (Bruckner)|Fifth]] with the [[Munich Philharmonic]] in 2004 clocks at 82:34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audaud.com/article.php?ArticleID=410|title=BRUCKNER: Symphony No. 5 in B flat major - Munich Philharmonic/Christian Thielemann - DGG|publisher=audaud.com|accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kirov Orchestra]] recording of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''The Nutcracker'' conducted by [[Valery Gergiev]] and released by Philips/PolyGram Records (catalogue number 462 114) on October 20, 1998, clocks at 81:14.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Disc two of ''Gold'' (Deutche Grammophon/Universal Classics 477 743) by [[Herbert von Karajan]] clocks in at 81:21.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The [[Mission of Burma]] compilation album ''Mission of Burma'', released in 1988 by [[Rykodisc]], previously held the record at 80:08.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Mission-Of-Burma-Mission-Of-Burma/release/1129709|title=Mission of Burma 1988 Rykodisc compilation information|publisher=discogs.com|accessdate=2011-01-18|quote=This Rykodisc release was the first compact disc to contain 80 minutes of music; 78 minutes had previously been the longest length possible to encode on a CD.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Data structure ====
The smallest entity in a CD is called a ''frame'', which consists of 33 bytes and contains six complete 16-bit stereo samples (two bytes × two channels × six samples = 24 bytes). The other nine bytes consist of eight CIRC error-correction bytes and one [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] byte, used for control and display. Each byte is translated into a 14-bit word using eight-to-fourteen modulation, which alternates with three-bit merging words. In total there are 33 × (14 + 3) = 561 bits. A 27-bit unique synchronization word is added, so that the number of bits in a frame totals 588 (which are decoded to only 192 bits music).

These 588-bit frames are in turn grouped into sectors. Each sector contains 98 frames, totaling 98 × 24 = 2352 bytes of music. The CD is played at a speed of 75 sectors per second, which results in 176,400 bytes per second. Divided by two channels and two bytes per sample, this results in a sample rate of 44,100 samples per second.

For CD-ROM data discs, the physical frame and sector sizes are the same. Since error concealment cannot be applied to non-audio data in case the CIRC error correction fails to recover the user data, a third layer of error correction is defined, reducing the payload to 2048 bytes per sector for the Mode-1 CD-ROM format. To increase the data-rate for [[Video CD]], Mode-2 CD-ROM, the third layer has been omitted, increasing the payload to 2336 user-available bytes per sector, only 16 bytes (for synchronization and header data) less than available in Red-Book audio.

===== &quot;Frame&quot; =====
For the Red Book stereo audio CD, the time format is commonly measured in minutes, seconds and frames (mm:ss:ff), where one frame corresponds to one sector, or 1/75th of a second of stereo sound. In this context, the term ''frame'' is erroneously applied in editing applications and does not denote the physical frame described above. In editing and extracting, the frame is the smallest addressable time interval for an audio CD, meaning that track start and end positions can only be defined in 1/75 second steps.

===== Logical structure =====
The largest entity on a CD is called a track. A CD can contain up to 99 tracks (including a data track for [[mixed mode]] discs). Each track can in turn have up to 100 indexes, though players which handle this feature are rarely found outside of [[pro audio]], particularly radio broadcasting. The vast majority of songs are recorded under index 1, with the [[pre-gap]] being index 0. Sometimes [[hidden track]]s are placed at the end of the last track of the disc, often using index 2 or 3. This is also the case with some discs offering &quot;101 sound effects&quot;, with 100 and 101 being indexed as two and three on track 99. The index, if used, is occasionally put on the track listing as a decimal part of the track number, such as 99.2 or 99.3. ([[Information Society (band)|Information Society]]'s ''[[Hack (album)|Hack]]'' was one of very few CD releases to do this, following a release with an equally obscure CD+G feature.) The track and index structure of the CD carried forward to the DVD as title and chapter, respectively.

===== Manufacturing tolerances =====
Current manufacturing processes allow an audio CD to contain up to 80 minutes (variable from one replication plant to another) without requiring the content creator to sign a waiver releasing the plant owner from responsibility if the CD produced is marginally or entirely unreadable by some playback equipment. Thus, in current practice, maximum CD playing time has crept higher by reducing minimum engineering tolerances; by and large, this has not unacceptably reduced reliability.

==== CD-Text ====
{{Main|CD-Text}}
CD-Text is an extension of the Red Book specification for audio CD that allows for storage of additional text information (e.g., album name, song name, artist) on a standards-compliant audio CD. The information is stored either in the [[optical disc authoring#Lead-In|lead-in area]] of the CD, where there is roughly five kilobytes of space available, or in the [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R to W on the disc, which can store about 31 megabytes.

==== CD + Graphics ====
{{Main|CD+G}}
Compact Disc + Graphics (CD+G) is a special audio Compact Disc that contains graphics data in addition to the audio data on the disc. The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player, but when played on a special CD+G player, can output a graphics signal (typically, the CD+G player is hooked up to a television set or a computer monitor); these graphics are almost exclusively used to display lyrics on a television set for [[karaoke]] performers to sing along with. The CD+G format takes advantage of the channels R through W. These six bits store the graphics information.

===== CD + Extended Graphics =====
{{Main|Compact Disc + Extended Graphics}}
Compact Disc + Extended Graphics (CD+EG, also known as CD+XG) is an improved variant of the [[#CD + Graphics|Compact Disc + Graphics]] (CD+G) format. Like CD+G, CD+EG utilizes basic CD-ROM features to display text and video information in addition to the music being played. This extra data is stored in [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R-W. Very few, if any, CD+EG discs have been published.

=== Super Audio CD ===
{{Main|Super Audio CD}}
Super Audio CD (SACD) is a high-resolution read-only [[optical disc|optical]] [[audio storage|audio disc]] format that provides much [[high fidelity|higher fidelity]] digital audio reproduction than the Red Book. Introduced in 1999, it was developed by Sony and Philips, the same companies that created the Red Book. SACD was in a [[format war]] with [[DVD-Audio]], but neither has replaced audio CDs.

In contrast to DVD-Audio, the SACD format has the feature of being able to produce hybrid discs; these discs contain the SACD audio stream as well as a standard audio CD layer which is playable in standard CD players, thus making them [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]].

=== CD-MIDI ===
CD-[[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] is a format used to store music-performance data which upon playback is performed by electronic instruments that synthesize the audio. Hence, unlike Red Book, these recordings are not audio.

=== CD-ROM ===
{{Main|CD-ROM}}
For the first few years of its existence, the Compact Disc was a medium used purely for audio. However, in 1985 the [[Yellow Book (CD-ROM standards)|Yellow Book]] CD-ROM standard was established by Sony and Philips, which defined a non-volatile optical data [[computer storage|computer data storage]] medium using the same physical format as audio Compact Discs, readable by a computer with a CD-ROM drive.

=== Video CD (VCD) ===
{{Main|Video CD}}
Video CD (VCD, View CD, and Compact Disc digital video) is a standard [[digital]] format for storing video media on a CD. VCDs are playable in dedicated VCD players, most modern [[DVD-Video]] players, personal computers, and some video game consoles.

The VCD standard was created in 1993 by Sony, Philips, [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]], and [[JVC]] and is referred to as the [[White Book (CD standard)|White Book]] standard.

Overall picture quality is intended to be comparable to [[VHS]] video. Poorly compressed VCD video can sometimes be lower quality than VHS video, but VCD exhibits block artifacts rather than analog noise, and does not deteriorate further with each use, which may be preferable.

352x240 (or [[Source Input Format|SIF]]) resolution was chosen because it is half the vertical, and half the horizontal resolution of NTSC video. 352x288 is similarly one quarter PAL/SECAM resolution. This approximates the (overall) resolution of an analog VHS tape, which, although it has double the number of (vertical) scan lines, has a much lower horizontal resolution.

==== Super Video CD ====
{{Main|Super Video CD}}
Super Video CD (Super Video Compact Disc or SVCD) is a format used for storing video media on standard Compact Discs. SVCD was intended as a successor to VCD and an alternative to DVD-Video, and falls somewhere between both in terms of technical capability and picture quality.

SVCD has two-thirds the [[display resolution|resolution]] of DVD, and over 2.7 times the resolution of VCD. One CD-R disc can hold up to 60 minutes of standard quality SVCD-format video. While no specific limit on SVCD video length is mandated by the specification, one must lower the video bit rate, and therefore quality, in order to accommodate very long videos. It is usually difficult to fit much more than 100 minutes of video onto one SVCD without incurring significant quality loss, and many hardware players are unable to play video with an instantaneous bit rate lower than 300 to 600 [[kilobits]] per second.

=== Photo CD ===
{{Main|Photo CD}}
Photo CD is a system designed by [[Kodak]] for digitizing and storing photos on a CD. Launched in 1992, the discs were designed to hold nearly 100 high quality images, scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding. Photo CD discs are defined in the [[Rainbow Books|Beige Book]] and conform to the [[CD-ROM]] XA and CD-i Bridge specifications as well. They are intended to play on CD-i players, Photo CD players and any computer with the suitable software irrespective of the [[operating system]]. The images can also be printed out on photographic paper with a special Kodak machine. This format is not to be confused with Kodak [[Picture CD]], which is a consumer product in CD-ROM format.

==== CD-i ====
{{Main|Green Book (CD-interactive standard)}}
The Philips &quot;Green Book&quot; specifies the standard for interactive multimedia Compact Discs designed for [[CD-i]] players. This format is unusual because it hides the initial tracks which contains the software and data files used by CD-i players by omitting the tracks from the disc's TOC (table of contents). This causes [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|audio CD]] players to skip the CD-i data tracks. This is different from the [[CD-i Ready]] format, which puts CD-i software and data into the [[Pregap#Computer data in pregap|pregap]] of track 1. CDi was the leading format of its time but was supplanted by the politics of competition. Philips Interactive Media lead the way in producing breakthrough titles, including the first interactive coloring book, Sesame Street Disc and children's programs, Groliers and Comptoms encyclopedias and many more pathbreaking programs.

=== Enhanced CD ===
{{Main|Enhanced CD}}
Enhanced CD, also known as CD Extra and CD Plus, is a [[certification mark]] of the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for various technologies that combine audio and computer data for use in both Compact Disc and [[CD-ROM]] players.

The primary data formats for Enhanced Compact Disc's are [[Mixed Mode CD|mixed mode]] ([[Yellow Book (CD-ROM standards)|Yellow Book]]/[[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Red Book]]), [[CD-i]], hidden track, and multisession ([[Blue Book specification|Blue Book]]).

=== VinylDisc ===
{{Main|VinylDisc}}
VinylDisc is the hybrid of a standard Audio CD and the [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]]. The vinyl layer on the disc's label side can hold approximately three minutes of music.

== Manufacture ==
{{Main|CD manufacturing}}
Replicated CDs are mass-produced initially using a hydraulic press. Small granules of heated raw polycarbonate plastic are fed into the press. A screw forces the liquefied plastic into the mold cavity. The mold closes with a metal stamper in contact with the disc surface. The plastic is allowed to cool and harden. Once opened, the disc substrate is removed from the mold by a robotic arm, and a 15&amp;nbsp;mm diameter center hole (called a stacking ring) is created. The time it takes to &quot;stamp&quot; one CD, is usually 2 to 3 seconds.

This method produces the clear plastic blank part of the disc. After a metallic reflecting layer (usually aluminum, but sometimes gold or other metal) is applied to the clear blank substrate, the disc goes under a UV light for curing and it is ready to go to press. To prepare to press a CD, a glass master is made, using a high-powered laser on a device similar to a CD writer. The glass master is a positive image of the desired CD surface (with the desired microscopic pits and lands). After testing, it is used to make a die by pressing it against a metal disc.

The die is a negative image of the glass master: typically, several are made, depending on the number of pressing mills that are to make the CD. The die then goes into a press and the physical image is transferred to the blank CD, leaving a final positive image on the disc. A small amount of lacquer is applied as a ring around the center of the disc, and rapid spinning spreads it evenly over the surface. Edge protection lacquer is applied before the disc is finished. The disc can then be printed and packed.

Manufactured CDs that are sold in stores are sealed via a process called &quot;polywrapping&quot; or shrink wrapping.

== Recordable CD ==
[[File:Compact disc.jpg|thumb|700 [[Megabyte|MB]] CD-R next to a [[mechanical pencil]]]]
{{Main|CD-R}}
Recordable Compact Discs, [[CD-R]]s, are injection molded with a &quot;blank&quot; data spiral. A photosensitive dye is then applied, after which the discs are metalized and lacquer-coated. The write laser of the [[CD recorder]] changes the color of the dye to allow the read laser of a standard [[CD player]] to see the data, just as it would with a standard stamped disc. The resulting discs can be read by most CD-ROM drives and played in most audio CD players.

CD-R recordings are designed to be permanent. Over time the dye's physical characteristics may change, however, causing read errors and data loss until the reading device cannot recover with error correction methods. The design life is from 20 to 100 years, depending on the quality of the discs, the quality of the writing drive, and storage conditions. However, testing has demonstrated such degradation of some discs in as little as 18 months under normal storage conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cdfreaks.com/news/CD-Recordable-discs-unreadable-in-less-than-two-years.html | title = CD-R Unreadable in Less Than Two Years | publisher = cdfreaks.com | accessdate = 2007-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pc-active.nl/toonArtikel.asp?artikelID=508 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050204065340/http://www.pc-active.nl/toonArtikel.asp?artikelID=508 | archivedate = 2005-02-04 | title = CD-R ROT | publisher = PC-Active.com via archive.org | accessdate = 2007-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This failure is known as [[CD rot]]. CD-Rs follow the [[Rainbow Books|Orange Book]] standard.

=== Recordable audio CD ===
The recordable audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder. These consumer audio CD recorders use SCMS ([[Serial Copy Management System]]), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the AHRA ([[Audio Home Recording Act]]). The Recordable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-R due to (a) lower volume and (b) a 3% [[Audio Home Recording Act#AHRA royalties|AHRA royalty]] used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.&lt;ref name=&quot;McFadden&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cdrfaq.org/ | title = CD-Recordable FAQ | author = Andy McFadden | date = 2007-08-08 | accessdate = 2007-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High-capacity recordable CD ===
A higher density recording format that can hold:

* 98.5 minutes of audio on a 12&amp;nbsp;cm disc (compared to about 80 minutes for Red Book audio).
* 30 minutes of audio on an 8&amp;nbsp;cm disc (compared to about 24 minutes for Red Book audio).

== ReWritable CD ==
{{Main|CD-RW}}
[[CD-RW]] is a re-recordable medium that uses a metallic alloy instead of a dye. The write laser in this case is used to heat and alter the properties (amorphous vs. crystalline) of the alloy, and hence change its reflectivity. A CD-RW does not have as great a difference in reflectivity as a pressed CD or a CD-R, and so many earlier CD audio players ''cannot'' read CD-RW discs, although ''most'' later CD audio players and stand-alone [[DVD]] players can. CD-RWs follow the [[Rainbow Books|Orange Book]] standard.

=== High-speed ReWritable CD ===
Due to technical limitations, the original ReWritable CD could be written no faster than 4x speed. High Speed ReWritable CD has a different design that permits writing at speeds ranging from 4x to 12x.

Original CD-RW drives can only write to original ReWritable CDs. High Speed CD-RW drives can typically write to both original ReWritable CD discs and High Speed ReWritable CD discs. Both types of CD-RW discs can be read in most CD drives.

Higher speed CD-RW discs, Ultra Speed (16x to 24x write speed) and Ultra Speed+ (32x write speed), are now available.

=== ReWritable Audio CD ===
The ReWritable Audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder, which won't (without modification) accept standard CD-RW discs. These consumer audio CD recorders use the [[Serial Copy Management System]] (SCMS), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the United States' [[Audio Home Recording Act]] (AHRA). The ReWritable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-RW due to (a) lower volume and (b) a 3% [[Audio Home Recording Act#AHRA royalties|AHRA royalty]] used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.&lt;ref name=&quot;McFadden&quot;/&gt;

== Copy protection ==
{{Main|CD/DVD copy protection}}
The Red Book audio specification, except for a simple 'anti-copy' bit in the subcode, does not include any [[copy protection]] mechanism. Starting in early 2002, attempts were made by record companies to market &quot;copy-protected&quot; non-standard Compact Discs, which cannot be ripped, or copied, to hard drives or easily converted to MP3s. One major drawback to these copy-protected discs is that most will not play on either computer CD-ROM drives, or some standalone CD players that use CD-ROM mechanisms. Philips has stated that such discs are not permitted to bear the trademarked ''Compact Disc Digital Audio'' logo because they violate the Red Book specifications. Numerous copy-protection systems have been countered by readily available, often free, software.

'''Charles Farrar Browne''' (April 26, 1834 – March 6, 1867) was a [[United States]] [[humor]] writer, better known under his ''[[pen name|nom de plume]]'', '''Artemus Ward'''. At birth, his surname was &quot;Brown.&quot; He added the &quot;e&quot; after he became famous.&lt;ref name=&quot;MAGDE&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Maine League of Historical Societies and Museums |editor=Doris A. Isaacson |title=Maine: A Guide 'Down East' |year=1970 |publisher=Courier-Gazette, Inc. |location=Rockland, Me | pages = 400–401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Browne was born in [[Waterford, Maine]]. He began life as a compositor and occasional contributor to the daily and weekly journals. In 1858, he published in ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]) the first of the &quot;Artemus Ward&quot; series, which, in a collected form, achieved great popularity in both America and [[England]]. In 1860, he became editor of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine, historical)|Vanity Fair]]'', a humorous New York weekly, which proved a failure. About the same time, he began to appear as a lecturer and, by his droll and eccentric humor, attracted large audiences.

&quot;Artemus Ward&quot; was the favorite author of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Before presenting &quot;[[The Emancipation Proclamation]]&quot; to his Cabinet, Lincoln read to them the latest episode, &quot;Outrage in Utiky&quot;, also known as ''High-Handed Outrage at Utica''. 

Ward is also said to have inspired [[Mark Twain]] when Ward performed in [[Virginia City]], [[Nevada]]. Legend has it that, following Ward's stage performance, he, Mark Twain, and [[Dan De Quille]] were taking a drunken rooftop tour of Virginia City until a town constable threatened to blast all three of them with a [[shotgun]] loaded with [[rock salt]].

In 1866, Ward visited England, where he became exceedingly popular both as a lecturer and as a contributor to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''. In the spring of the following year, Ward's health gave way and he died of [[tuberculosis]] at Southampton on March 6, 1867.

After initially being buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], Ward's remains were removed to the United States on May 20, 1868.

'''Caelum''' is a faint [[constellation]] in the southern sky, introduced in the 18th century by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]]. Its name means &quot;the [[chisel]]&quot; in [[Latin]], and it was formerly known as '''Cæla Sculptoris''', &quot;the sculptor's chisel&quot;. It is the eighth smallest constellation, with an area just less than that of [[Corona Australis]].

== Notable features ==
{{See also|List of stars in Caelum}}
Caelum is a faint constellation, having no star brighter than fourth magnitude.  Its brightest star is the magnitude 4.45 [[Alpha Caeli|α Caeli]].   

A small telescope splits [[Gamma Caeli|γ Caeli]] into a magnitude 4.5 red giant and a magnitude 6.34 white giant.  Larger telescopes are needed to see several [[New General Catalog|NGC]] objects, all galaxies, but none brighter than magnitude 11.5 or larger than 3 arcminutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seds.org/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/caelum.html Caelum at SEDS.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most notable galaxies are NGC 1571, NGC 1679 and IC 2106.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wingmakers.co.nz/universe/constellations/Caelum.html Caelum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Namesakes==
[[USS Caelum (AK-106)]] was a [[United States Navy]] ship named after the constellation.

The '''clarinet''' is a [[musical instrument]] of [[woodwind]] type. The name derives from adding the suffix ''-et'' (meaning ''little'') to the Italian word ''clarino'' (meaning a type of [[trumpet]]), as the first clarinets had a strident tone similar to that of a trumpet. The instrument has an approximately cylindrical [[bore (wind instruments)|bore]], and uses a [[Single-reed instrument|single reed]]. In [[jazz]] contexts, it has sometimes been informally referred to as the &quot;licorice stick.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/licorice+stick Definition of Clarinet ] at the Free Dictionary by Farlex. Retrieved April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarinets comprise a [[Family (musical instruments)|family]] of instruments of differing sizes and pitches. The [[clarinet family]] is the largest such woodwind family, with more than a dozen types, ranging from the (extremely rare) [[subcontrabass clarinet|BBB♭ octo-contrabass]] to the [[A-flat clarinet|A♭ soprano (piccolo clarinet)]]. Of these, many are rare or obsolete (there is only one BBB♭ octo-contrabass clarinet in existence, for example), and music written for them is usually played on the common types. The unmodified word ''clarinet'' usually refers to the B{{music|flat}} [[soprano clarinet]], by far the most commonly played clarinet.

A person who plays the clarinet is called a [[clarinetist]] or clarinettist. [[Johann Christoph Denner]] invented the clarinet in [[Germany]] around the turn of the 18th century by adding a [[register key]] to the earlier [[chalumeau]]. Over time, additional keywork and airtight pads were added to improve tone and playability. Today, the clarinet is used in jazz and [[Classical music|classical]] ensembles, in [[Chamber music|chamber]] groups, and as a [[Solo (music)|solo]] instrument.
&lt;!-- Please don't touch the next two lines, they're for formatting --&gt;

== Characteristics ==
=== Tone ===
The [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] bore is primarily responsible for the clarinet's distinctive [[timbre]], which varies between its three main [[register (music)|registers]], known as the chalumeau, clarino, and altissimo. The tone quality can vary greatly with the musician, the music, the instrument, the mouthpiece, and the reed. The differences in instruments and geographical isolation of players in different countries led to the development, from the last part of the 18th century onwards, of several different schools of clarinet playing. The most prominent were the German/Viennese traditions and the French school. The latter was centered on the clarinetists of the [[Conservatoire de Paris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;&gt;Lawson, Colin James. ''The Cambridge companion to the clarinet''. Cambridge University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of recorded music has made examples of different styles of clarinet playing available. The modern clarinetist has a diverse palette of &quot;acceptable&quot; tone qualities to choose from.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt;

[[File:clarinette basse.jpg|thumb|Bass clarinet|100px]]
The A clarinet and B{{music|flat}} clarinet have nearly the same bore, and use the same mouthpiece.&lt;ref name=&quot;pino&quot;/&gt; Orchestral players using the A and B{{music|flat}} instruments in the same concert use the same mouthpiece (and often the same barrel) for both (see 'usage' below). The A and the B{{music|flat}} instruments have nearly identical tonal quality, although the A typically has a slightly warmer sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;pino&quot;/&gt; The tone of the [[E-flat clarinet|E{{music|flat}} clarinet]] is brighter than that of the lower clarinets and can be heard even through loud orchestral textures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~emrich/chapter7.html|title=The Clarinet of the Twenty-First Century|last=Richards|first=E. Michael|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bass clarinet]] has a characteristically deep, mellow sound,&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt; while the [[alto clarinet]] is similar in tone to the bass and the [[Basset-horn|basset horn]] has a tone quality comparable to the A clarinet.

=== Range ===
{{Main|clarinet family|E-flat clarinet|soprano clarinet|alto clarinet|bass clarinet|basset-horn|contra-alto clarinet|contrabass clarinet}}
Clarinets have the largest pitch range of common woodwinds.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Alfred. &quot;The Composer and the College Band&quot;. ''Music Educators Journal'', Vol. '''48''', No. 1 (September–October 1961), pp.&amp;nbsp;51–53&lt;/ref&gt; The intricate [[key (instrument)|key]] organization that makes this range possible can make the playability of some passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet’s written range is defined by the keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allow a low E on the common B{{music|flat}} clarinet. The lowest [[Pitch (music)#Concert pitch|concert pitch]] depends on the [[transposing instrument|transposition]] of the instrument in question.

Nearly all [[soprano clarinet|soprano]] and [[piccolo clarinet]]s have keywork enabling them to play the E below middle C (E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in [[scientific pitch notation]]) as their lowest written note, though some B{{music|flat}} clarinets go down to E{{music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to enable them to match the range of the A clarinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/922164|last=Cockshott|first=Gerald|coauthors=D. K. Dent, Morrison C. Boyd and E. J.

&lt;!-- [[Image:Range clarinet.png|left|thumb|250px|Written range of soprano clarinets.]] --&gt;
Most alto and bass clarinets have an extra key to allow a (written) E{{music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Modern professional-quality bass clarinets generally have additional keywork to written C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Shigeru Yamaryo. Yamaha Corporation. Key mechanism for a bass clarinet.

Defining the top end of a clarinet’s range is difficult, since many advanced players can produce notes well above the highest notes commonly found in method books. The G two octaves above G&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is usually the highest note clarinetists encounter in classical repertoire.&lt;ref name=&quot;lowry&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowry|first=Robert|title=Practical Hints on Playing the B-Flat Clarinet|publisher=Alfred Publishing|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The C above that (C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; i.e. resting on the fifth ledger line above the treble staff) is attainable by advanced players and is shown on many [[fingering]] charts,&lt;ref name=&quot;lowry&quot; /&gt; and fingerings as high as E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ridenour|first=Thomas|title=Clarinet Fingerings|year=2000|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of a clarinet can be divided into three distinct registers. The lowest register, consisting of the notes up to the written B{{music|flat}} above middle C (B{{music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), is known as the ''[[chalumeau]]'' register (named after the instrument that was the clarinet's immediate predecessor). The middle register is termed the ''clarino'' (sometimes ''clarion'') register&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The chalumeau register is rich and dark. The clarino register is brighter and sweet, like a trumpet heard from afar (&quot;clarino&quot; means trumpet). The altissimo register can be piercing and sometimes shrill.

Most modern, inexpensive instruments are made of plastic resin, such as [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jenkins&quot; /&gt; These materials are sometimes called &quot;resonite&quot;, which is [[The Selmer Company|Selmer]]'s [[trademark]] name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early twentieth century, until plastic instruments supplanted them;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silver-clarinet.com/|title=The Silver Clarinet Story|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets, and for the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt; Ivory was used for a few 18th century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well.&lt;ref name=&quot;hoeprich&quot;/&gt;

[[Mouthpiece (woodwind)|Mouthpieces]] are generally made of hard rubber, although some inexpensive mouthpieces may be made of plastic.&lt;ref name=&quot;pino&quot;/&gt; Other materials such as crystal/glass, wood, ivory, and metal have also been used.&lt;ref name=&quot;pino&quot;/&gt; [[Ligature (musical instrument)|Ligatures]] are often made out of metal and plated in nickel, silver or gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;pino&quot;/&gt; Other ligature materials include wire, wire mesh, plastic, [[naugahyde]], string, or leather.&lt;ref name=&quot;pinksterboer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinksterboer|first=Hugo|title=Tipbook Clarinet|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2001|isbn=1858287537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reed ===
The instrument uses a single [[reed (instrument)|reed]] made from the cane of ''[[Arundo donax]]'', a type of grass.&lt;ref&gt;Obataya E, Norimoto M. &quot;Acoustic properties of a reed (''Arundo donax'' L.) used for the vibrating plate of a clarinet&quot;. ''J. Acoust. Soc. Am.'' Volume '''106''', Issue 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;1106–1110 (August 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Reeds may also be manufactured from synthetic materials. The [[ligature (musical instrument)|ligature]] fastens the reed to the mouthpiece. When air is blown through the opening between the reed and the mouthpiece facing, the reed vibrates and produces the instrument's sound.

Basic reed measurements are as follows: tip, {{convert|12|mm|in}} wide; lay, {{convert|15|mm|in}} long (distance from the place where the reed touches the mouthpiece to the tip); gap, {{convert|1|mm|in}} (distance between the underside of the reed tip and the mouthpiece). Adjustment to these measurements is one method of affecting tone color.&lt;ref&gt;Baines, Anthony. ''Woodwind instruments and their history''. Dover Publications, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most clarinetists buy manufactured reeds, although many make adjustments to these reeds and some make their own reeds from cane &quot;blanks&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;intravaia&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3344436|last=Intravaia|first=Lawrence J|coauthors=Robert S.

This numbering system is not standardized — reeds with the same hardness number often vary in hardness across manufacturers and models.&lt;ref name=&quot;pinksterboer&quot;/&gt; Reed and mouthpiece characteristics work together to determine ease of playability, pitch stability, and tonal characteristics.&lt;ref name=&quot;pinksterboer&quot;/&gt;

=== Components of a modern soprano clarinet ===
&lt;!-- [[Image:Clarinet.jpg|thumb|640px|center|A concert B{{music|flat}} Clarinet (Boehm system)]] --&gt;
Note: A [[Boehm system (clarinet)|Boehm system]] soprano clarinet is shown in the photos illustrating this section. However, all modern clarinets have similar components.

[[Image:Selmer-clarinet-mouthpiece-reed-and-vandoren-ligature.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Clarinet [[Reed (music)|reed]], [[Mouthpiece (woodwind)|mouthpiece]], and [[Ligature (musical instrument)|ligature]]]]
The ''[[Reed (music)|reed]]'' is attached to the ''[[Mouthpiece (woodwind)|mouthpiece]]'' by the ''[[Ligature (musical instrument)|ligature]]'', and the top half-inch or so of this assembly is held in the player’s mouth.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt; German clarinetists often wrap a string around the mouthpiece and reed instead of using a ligature.&lt;ref name=&quot;pino&quot;/&gt; The formation of the mouth around the mouthpiece and reed is called the ''[[embouchure]]''.
{{listen|filename=ClarinetReed.ogg|title=Bb Clarinet reed and mouthpiece.|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

The reed is on the underside of the mouthpiece, pressing against the player's lower lip, while the top teeth normally contact the top of the mouthpiece (some players roll the upper lip under the top teeth to form what is called a ‘double-lip’ embouchure).&lt;ref name=&quot;pino&quot;&gt;Pino D. ''The clarinet and clarinet playing''. Dover Publications, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Adjustments in the strength and shape of the embouchure change the tone and intonation (tuning). It is not uncommon for clarinetists to employ methods to relieve the pressure on the upper teeth and inner lower lip by attaching pads to the top of the mouthpiece or putting (temporary) padding on the front lower teeth, commonly from folded paper.&lt;ref name=&quot;pino&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Buffet-R13-Clarinet-barrel.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Barrel of a B{{music|flat}} soprano Clarinet]]
Next is the short ''barrel''; this part of the instrument may be extended to fine-tune the clarinet. As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made by pulling out the barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an [[orchestra]]). Some performers use a plastic barrel with a thumbwheel that enables the barrel length to be altered. On basset horns and lower clarinets, the barrel is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.

[[Image:Buffet-R13-Clarinet-upper-joint.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Upper Joint of a Boehm-System Clarinet]]
The main body of most clarinets is divided into the ''upper joint'', the holes and most keys of which are operated by the left hand, and the ''lower joint'' with holes and most keys operated by the right hand. Some clarinets have a single joint: on some basset horns and larger clarinets the two joints are held together with a screw clamp and are usually not disassembled for storage. The left thumb operates both a ''tone hole'' and the ''register key''. On some models of clarinet, such as many [[Albert system]] clarinets and increasingly some higher-end Boehm system clarinets, the register key is a 'wraparound' key, with the key on the back of the clarinet and the pad on the front. Advocates of the wraparound register key say it improves sound, and it is harder for moisture to accumulate in the tube beneath the pad.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The bore&quot;. http://www.the-clarinets.net/clarinet-bore.html. Accessed 2009-7-2. {{Wayback|url=http://www.the-clarinets.net/clarinet-bore.html|date =20080804090450|bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of a modern soprano clarinet is equipped with numerous ''[[tone hole]]s'' of which seven (six front, one back) are covered with the fingertips, and the rest are opened or closed using a set of keys. These tone holes allow every note of the chromatic scale to be produced. On alto and larger clarinets and a few soprano clarinets, some or all finger holes are replaced by key-covered holes. The most common system of keys was named the Boehm System by its designer [[Hyacinthe Klosé]] in honour of [[flute]] designer [[Theobald Boehm]], but it is not the same as the [[Boehm System]] used on flutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridley&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/842134|last=Ridley|first=E.A.K.|date=September 1986|title=Birth of the 'Boehm' Clarinet|journal=The Galpin Society Journal|volume=39|pages=68–76|jstor=842134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other main system of keys is called the [[Oehler system]] and is used mostly in Germany and Austria (see [[clarinet#History|History]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt; The related Albert system is used by some [[jazz]], [[klezmer]], and eastern European folk musicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt; The Albert and Oehler systems are both based on the early [[Ivan Mueller|Mueller system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Buffet-R13-Clarinet-lower-joint.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Lower Joint of a Boehm-System Clarinet]]

The cluster of keys at the bottom of the upper joint (protruding slightly beyond the cork of the joint) are known as the ''trill keys'' and are operated by the right hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;pinksterboer&quot;/&gt; These give the player alternative fingerings that make it easy to play ornaments and [[trill (music)|trills]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pinksterboer&quot;/&gt; The entire weight of the smaller clarinets is supported by the right thumb behind the lower joint on what is called the ''thumb-rest''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horvath|first=Janet|date=September 2001|title=An Orchestra Musician's Perspective on 20 Years of Performing Arts Medicine|journal=Medical Problems of Performing Artists|volume=16|issue=3|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basset horns and larger clarinets are supported with a neck strap or a floor peg.

[[Image:Buffet-R13-Clarinet-bell.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Bell of a B{{music|flat}} soprano clarinet]]
Finally, the flared end is known as the ''bell''. Contrary to popular belief, the bell does not amplify the sound; rather, it improves the uniformity of the instrument's tone for the lowest notes in each register.&lt;ref name=&quot;physics&quot;&gt;&quot;Clarinet acoustics: an introduction&quot;. University of New South Wales. http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/clarinetacoustics.html. Retrieved 2009-7-2.&lt;/ref&gt; For the other notes the sound is produced almost entirely at the tone holes and the bell is irrelevant.&lt;ref name=&quot;physics&quot;/&gt; On [[Basset-horn|basset horns]] and larger clarinets, the bell curves up and forward and is usually made of metal.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt;

=== Boehm Keywork and sample fingerings of a modern soprano clarinet ===

Theobald Boehm did not directly invent the key system of the clarinet. Boehm was a flautist who created the key system that is now used for the Transverse Flute. Klosé and Buffet applied Boehm's system to the Clarinet. Although the credit goes to those people, Boehm's name was given to that key system.

The current Boehm key system consists of generally 6 rings, on the thumb, 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th holes, a register key just above the thumb hole, easily accessible with the thumb. Above the 1st hole, there is a key that lifts two covers creating the note A in the throat register (high part of low register) of the clarinet. A key at the side of the instrument at the same height as the A key lifts only one of the two covers, producing G# a semitone lower. The A key can be used in conjunction solely with the register key to produce A#/Bb.

== Acoustics ==
[[File:Emission clarinette.png|thumb|300 px|Vibration of the air column in the soprano clarinet&lt;ref&gt;Synthesis of [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/clarinetacoustics.html#Clarinet acoustics] University of New South Wales.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Sound]] is a [[wave]] that propagates through the air as a result of a local variation in [[air pressure]]. The production of sound by a clarinet follows these steps:&lt;ref name=&quot;physics&quot;&gt;[http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/clarinetacoustics.html#pipe Acoustics of the Clarinet] University of New South Wales.&lt;/ref&gt;

# The air in the bore of the instrument is at normal atmospheric pressure and moves towards the bell (or the first open hole). The minuscule space between the mouthpiece and the reed allows only a small amount of air to enter the instrument. This creates a low-pressure area in the mouthpiece. The difference in pressure between the two sides of the reed increases, causing the reed to press against the mouthpiece.
# The wave of low-pressure air moves down the bore and arrives at the first open hole.
# The outside air, at normal atmospheric pressure, is sucked in by the low pressure inside. The air that was previously leaving the clarinet through the hole changes direction quickly and enters the bore.
# The incoming air normalizes the pressure within the bore, starting at the open hole and moving back towards the mouthpiece.
# Once all the air in the bore is at atmospheric pressure (moving towards the mouthpiece), the difference in pressure between the two sides of the reed decreases and the reed returns to its original position.
# The moving column of air is stopped by the sudden collision with the pressurized air coming from the player's mouth. A wave of high-pressure air moves towards the first open hole.
# When the high-pressure air arrives at the open hole, the air coming into the bore abruptly changes direction and goes out through the hole.
# The high pressure normalizes and the cycle restarts.

The cycle repeats at a constant frequency and emits a note related to that frequency. For example, [[A440 (pitch standard)|A4]] (440 [[Hertz|Hz]]) is produced when the cycle repeats 440 times per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wam.hr/Arhiva/US/Cavanagh_440Hz.pdf|title=A brief history of the establishment of international standard pitch a=440 hertz|last=Cavanagh|first=Lynn|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bore of the soprano clarinet is cylindrical for most of the tube with an inner bore diameter between {{convert|14|and|15.5|mm|in}}, but there is a subtle [[hourglass]] shape, with the thinnest part below the junction between the upper and lower joint.&lt;ref name=&quot;baines&quot;&gt;Baines, Anthony. ''Woodwind instruments and their history''. W.W. Norton &amp; Co, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction is {{convert|1|to|3|mm|in}} depending on the maker. This hourglass shape, although not visible to the naked eye, helps to correct the pitch/scale discrepancy between the chalumeau and clarino registers (perfect 12th).&lt;ref name=&quot;baines&quot;/&gt; The diameter of the bore affects characteristics such as available harmonics, timbre, and stability of pitch (the extent to which a note can be 'bent' in the manner required in jazz and other styles of music). The bell at the bottom of the instrument flares out to improve the tone of the lowest notes.

Most modern clarinets have &quot;undercut&quot; tone holes to improve intonation and the sound. Undercutting means [[chamfer]]ing the bottom edge of tone holes inside the bore. Acoustically, this makes the tone hole function as if it were larger, but its main function is to allow the air column to follow the curve up through the tone hole (surface tension) instead of &quot;blowing past&quot; it under the increased velocity of the upper registers.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Lee. &quot;Fundamentals of Acoustical Design of the Soprano Clarinet&quot;. Music Educators Journal, Vol. 54, No. 6 (Feb., 1968), pp. 113–115&lt;/ref&gt;

The fixed reed and fairly uniform diameter of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical [[stopped pipe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;physics&quot;/&gt; [[Recorder]]s use a tapered internal bore to overblow at the 8th (octave) when its thumb/register hole is pinched open while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows on the 12th. Adjusting the angle of the bore taper controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics).&lt;ref name=&quot;physics&quot;/&gt; Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes the harmonic timbre or voice of the instrument because this changes the speed of reed vibrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;physics&quot;/&gt; Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of the reed vibrate as possible, making the sound fuller, warmer, and potentially louder.

Covering or uncovering the tone holes varies the length of the pipe, changing the [[acoustic resonance|resonant frequencies]] of the enclosed air column and hence the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of the sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;physics&quot;/&gt; A clarinetist moves between the chalumeau and clarino registers through use of the [[register key]], or speaker key: clarinetists call the change from chalumeau register to clarino register &quot;the break&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pinksterboer&quot;/&gt; The register key, when pressed, cancels the fundamental frequency scale and forces the clarinet to produce the next dominant harmonic scale a [[interval (music)|twelfth]] higher, and when using at least fingers 1-2-3 1-2, taking off the first finger on the left hand, acts as another register key, and doesn't overblow a [[interval (music)|twelfth]], but instead a [[interval (music)|sixth]]. The clarinet is therefore said to [[overblow]] at the twelfth, and when moving to the altissimo register, a sixth. By contrast, nearly all other woodwind instruments overblow at the octave, or like the [[Ocarina]] and [[Tonette]], do not overblow at all (the [[Rackett]] or Sausage Bassoon is the next most common Western instrument that overblows at the twelfth). A clarinet must have holes and keys for nineteen notes (a chromatic octave and a half, from bottom E to B{{music|flat}}) in its lowest register to play the chromatic scale. This overblowing behavior explains the clarinet's great range and complex fingering system. The fifth and seventh harmonics are also available, sounding a further sixth and fourth (a flat, diminished fifth) higher respectively; these are the notes of the altissimo register.&lt;ref name=&quot;physics&quot;/&gt; This is also why the inner &quot;waist&quot; measurement is so critical to these harmonic frequencies.

The highest notes on a clarinet can have a shrill piercing quality and can be difficult to tune accurately.&lt;ref name=&quot;pino&quot;/&gt; Different instruments often play differently in this respect due to the sensitivity of the bore and reed measurements. Using alternate fingerings and adjusting the embouchure helps correct the pitch of these higher notes.

Since approximately 1850, clarinets have been nominally tuned according to [[12-tone equal temperament]]. Older clarinets were nominally tuned to [[meantone]]. A skilled performer can use his or her [[embouchure]] to considerably alter the tuning of individual notes or to produce [[vibrato]], a pulsating change of pitch often employed in [[jazz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drushler|first=P|year=1978|title=The clarinet vibrato|journal=Woodwind Anthology|location=Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vibrato is rare in classical or concert band literature; however, certain clarinetists, such as [[Richard Stoltzman]], do use vibrato in classical music. Special fingerings may be used to play [[quarter tone]]s and other [[Microtonal music|microtonal]] intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:Clarinet 4 key anon Bate.jpg|right|thumb|100px|4-key boxwood clarinet, ca. 1760.]]

=== Lineage ===
The clarinet has its roots in the early [[single-reed instrument]]s or [[Hornpipe (musical instrument)|hornpipes]] used in the [[Middle East]] and [[Europe]] since the [[Middle Ages]], such as the [[albogue]], [[alboka]], and [[double clarinet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt;

The modern clarinet developed from a [[Baroque music|Baroque]] instrument called the [[chalumeau]]. This instrument was similar to a [[recorder]], but with a [[Single-reed instrument|single-reed]] mouthpiece and a cylindrical bore.&lt;ref name=&quot;karp&quot; /&gt; Lacking a [[register key]], it was played mainly in its fundamental register, with a limited range of about one and a half octaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;karp&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/earlyj/14.4.545|last=Karp|first=Cary|year=1986|title=The early history of the clarinet and chalumeau|journal=Early Music|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=14|issue=4|pages=545–551}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had eight finger holes, like a recorder, and two keys for its two highest notes.&lt;ref name=&quot;karp&quot; /&gt; At this time, contrary to modern practice, the reed was placed in contact with the upper lip.&lt;ref name=&quot;karp&quot; /&gt;

Around the turn of the 18th century, the chalumeau was modified by converting one of its keys into a register key to produce the first clarinet. This development is usually attributed to German instrument maker [[Johann Christoph Denner]], though some have suggested his son Jacob Denner was the inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeprich, T Eric. &quot;A Three-Key Clarinet by J.C. Denner&quot;. ''The Galpin Society Journal'', Vol. 34, (Mar., 1981), pp. 21–32&lt;/ref&gt; This instrument played well in the middle register with a loud, shrill sound, so it was given the name ''clarinetto'' meaning &quot;little trumpet&quot; (from ''clarino'' + ''-etto''). Early clarinets did not play well in the lower register, so chalumeaux continued to be made to play the low notes.&lt;ref name=&quot;karp&quot; /&gt; As clarinets improved, the chalumeau fell into disuse and these notes became known as the ''chalumeau register''. The original Denner clarinets had two keys, and could play a [[chromatic scale]], but various makers added more keys to get improved tuning, easier fingerings, and a slightly larger range.&lt;ref name=&quot;karp&quot; /&gt; The classical clarinet of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] day typically had eight finger holes and five keys.

Clarinets were soon accepted into orchestras. Later models had a mellower tone than the originals. Mozart (d. 1791) liked the sound of the clarinet (he considered its tone the closest in quality to the human voice) and wrote numerous pieces for the instrument.,&lt;ref name=&quot;hacker&quot;&gt;Hacker, Alan. &quot;Mozart and the Basset Clarinet&quot;. ''The Musical Times'', Vol. '''110''', No. 1514 (Apr., 1969), pp.&amp;nbsp;359–362.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the time of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] (c. 1800–1820), the clarinet was a standard fixture in the orchestra.

=== Pads ===
The next major development in the history of clarinet was the invention of the modern pad. Early clarinets covered the tone holes with [[felt]] pads.&lt;ref name=&quot;bray&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hem.passagen.se/eriahl/history.htm|title=The clarinet history|last=Bray|first=Erin|date=2004-11-16|work=The clarinet family|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these leaked air, the pads had to be kept to a minimum, so the clarinet was severely restricted in what notes could be played with good tone.&lt;ref name=&quot;bray&quot;/&gt; In 1812, [[Iwan Müller]], a Russian-born clarinetist and inventor, developed a new type of pad that was covered in [[leather]] or [[Gas bladder|fish bladder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jl&quot;/&gt; This was completely airtight, so the number of keys could be increased enormously. He designed a new type of clarinet with seven finger holes and thirteen keys.&lt;ref name=&quot;jl&quot;&gt;[http://www.jlpublishing.com/ClarinetHistory.htm Clarinet History, 1812].&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the clarinet to play in any key with near-equal ease. Over the course of the 19th century, many enhancements were made to Mueller's clarinet, such as the [[Albert system]] and the Baermann system, all keeping the same basic design.

=== Arrangement of keys and holes ===
{{Main|Albert system|Boehm system (clarinet)|Oehler system}}
[[Image:Clarinets german.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[Oehler system]] clarinets use additional tone holes to correct intonation (patent C♯, low E-F correction, fork-F/B♭ correction and fork B♭ correction)]]
The final development in the modern design of the clarinet used in most of the world today was introduced by [[Hyacinthe Klosé]] in 1839.&lt;ref name=&quot;boehm&quot;&gt;Ridley, EAK. &quot;Birth of the 'Boehm' Clarinet&quot;. ''The Galpin Society Journal'', Vol. '''39''', (Sep., 1986), pp.&amp;nbsp;68–76&lt;/ref&gt; He devised a different arrangement of keys and finger holes, which allow simpler fingering. It was inspired by the [[Boehm System]] developed for flutes by [[Theobald Boehm]]. Klosé was so impressed by Boehm's invention that he named his own system for clarinets the [[Boehm system (clarinet)|Boehm system]], although it is different from the one used on flutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;boehm&quot;/&gt; This new system was slow to gain popularity because it meant the player had to relearn how to play the instrument. To ease this transition, Klose wrote a series of exercises for the clarinet, designed to teach his fingering system. Gradually it became the standard, and today the Boehm system is used everywhere in the world except Germany and Austria. These countries still use a direct descendant of the Mueller clarinet known as the [[Oehler system]] clarinet.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt; Also, some contemporary Dixieland and Klezmer players continue to use [[Albert system]] clarinets, as the simpler fingering system can allow for easier slurring of notes.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt; At one time the reed was held on using string, but now the practice exists primarily in Germany and Austria.

The modern [[orchestra]]l standard of using soprano clarinets in both B{{music|flat}} and A has to do partly with the history of the instrument, and partly with acoustics, aesthetics and economics. Before about 1800, due to the lack of airtight pads ''(see [[#History|History]])'', practical woodwinds could have only a few keys to control accidentals (notes outside their diatonic home scales).&lt;ref name=&quot;bray&quot;/&gt; The low (chalumeau) register of the clarinet spans a twelfth (an octave plus a perfect fifth), so the clarinet needs keys to produce all nineteen notes in that range.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt; This involves more keywork than is necessary on instruments that &quot;overblow&quot; at the octave — [[oboes]], [[flutes]], [[bassoon]]s, and [[saxophones]], for example, which need only twelve notes before overblowing.

Clarinets with few keys cannot therefore easily play chromatically, limiting any such instrument to a few closely related key signatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;longyear&quot; /&gt; For example, an eighteenth-century clarinet in C could be played in F, C, and G (and their relative minors) with good intonation, but with progressive difficulty and poorer intonation as the key moved away from this range.&lt;ref name=&quot;longyear&quot;&gt;Longyear, RM. &quot;Clarinet Sonorities in Early Romantic Music&quot;. The Musical Times, Vol. 124, No. 1682 (Apr., 1983), pp. 224–226&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, for octave-overblowing instruments, an instrument in C with few keys could much more readily be played in any key.

This problem was overcome by using three clarinets — in A, B{{music|flat}} and C — so that early 19th century music, which rarely strayed into the remote keys (five or six sharps or flats), could be played as follows: music in 5 to 2 sharps (B major to D major concert pitch) on A clarinet (D major to F major for the player), music in 1 sharp to 1 flat (G to F) on C clarinet, and music in 2 flats to 4 flats (B{{music|flat}} to A{{music|flat}}) on the B{{music|flat}} clarinet (C to B{{music|flat}} for the player). Difficult key signatures and numerous accidentals were thus largely avoided.

With the invention of the airtight pad, and as key technology improved and more keys were added to woodwinds, the need for clarinets in multiple musical keys was reduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt; However, the use of multiple instruments in different keys persisted, with the three instruments in C, B{{music|flat}} and A all used as specified by the composer.

The lower-pitched clarinets sound more &quot;mellow&quot; (less bright), and the C clarinet — being the highest and therefore brightest of the three — fell out of favour as the other two clarinets could cover its range and their sound was considered better.&lt;ref name=&quot;longyear&quot;/&gt; While the clarinet in C began to fall out of general use around 1850, some composers continued to write C parts after this date, e.g. [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s [[Symphony in C (Bizet)|Symphony in C]] (1855), [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Symphony No. 2 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 2]] (1872), [[Bedřich Smetana|Smetana]]'s ''[[Vltava]]'' (1874), [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Symphony No.&amp;nbsp;4]] (1885), and [[Richard Strauss]] deliberately reintroduced it to take advantage of its brighter tone, as in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' (1911).&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt;

While technical improvements and an equal-tempered scale reduced the need for two clarinets, the technical difficulty of playing in remote keys persisted and the A has thus remained a standard orchestral instrument.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt; In addition, by the late 19th century the orchestral clarinet repertoire contained so much music for clarinet in A that the disuse of this instrument was not practical.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt; Attempts were made to standardise to the B{{music|flat}} instrument between 1930 and 1950 (e.g. tutors recommended learning the routine transposition of orchestral A parts on the B{{music|flat}} clarinet, including solos written for A clarinet, and some manufacturers provided a low E{{music|flat}} on the B{{music|flat}} to match the range of the A), but this failed in the orchestral sphere.

Similarly there have been E{{music|flat}} and D instruments in the upper soprano range, B{{music|flat}}, A, and C instruments in the bass range, and so forth; but over time the E{{music|flat}} and B{{music|flat}} instruments have become predominant.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt;

The B{{music|flat}} instrument continues to be dominant in wind ensemble music and in jazz, with both B{{music|flat}} and C instruments used in some ethnic traditions, such as [[klezmer]] music.

=== Classical music ===
[[Image:R13-A-and-Bb-Clarinets-in-case.png|left|thumb|200px|A pair of Boehm-System Soprano Clarinets — one in B{{music|flat}} and one in A.]]
In [[classical music]], clarinets are part of standard [[orchestra]]l instrumentation, which frequently includes two clarinetists playing individual parts — each player is usually equipped with a pair of standard clarinets in B{{music|flat}} and A (see above) and clarinet parts commonly alternate between B{{music|flat}} and A instruments several times over the course of a piece or even, less commonly, of a movement (e.g. 1st movement Brahms 3rd symphony).&lt;ref name=&quot;anatomy&quot;&gt;Del Mar, Norman. ''Anatomy of the Orchestra''. University of California Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Clarinet sections grew larger during the last few decades of the 19th century, often employing a third clarinetist, an E{{music|flat}} or a bass clarinet. In the 20th century, composers such as [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Olivier Messiaen]] enlarged the clarinet section on occasion to up to nine players, employing many different clarinets including the E{{music|flat}} or D soprano clarinets, [[Basset-horn|basset horn]], [[alto clarinet]], [[bass clarinet]] and/or [[contrabass clarinet]].

This practice of using a variety of clarinets to achieve coloristic variety was common in [[20th century classical music|20th century music]] and continues today. However, many clarinetists and conductors prefer to play parts originally written for obscure instruments on B{{music|flat}} or E{{music|flat}} clarinets, which are often of better quality and more prevalent and accessible.&lt;ref name=&quot;anatomy&quot;/&gt;

The clarinet is widely used as a solo instrument. The relatively late evolution of the clarinet (when compared to other orchestral woodwinds) has left solo repertoire from the [[Classical music era|Classical]] period and later, but few works from the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt; Many [[clarinet concerto]]s have been written to showcase the instrument, with the concerti by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Aaron Copland|Copland]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] being well known.

Many works of [[chamber music]] have also been written for the clarinet. Common combinations are:

=== Concert bands ===
In [[concert band|wind bands]], clarinets are a central part of the instrumentation, occupying the same space (and often playing the same notes) in bands that the strings do in orchestras. Bands usually include several B{{music|flat}} clarinets, divided into sections each consisting of two or three clarinetists playing the same part. There is almost always an E{{music|flat}} clarinet part and a bass clarinet part, usually doubled.&lt;ref name=&quot;erickson&quot;&gt;Erickson, Frank. ''Arranging for the Concert Band''. Alfred Publishing, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Alto, contra-alto, and contrabass clarinets are sometimes used as well, and, rarely, a piccolo A{{music|flat}} clarinet.&lt;ref name=&quot;erickson&quot;/&gt;

=== Jazz ===
[[Image:DrMichaelWhiteStAug.jpg|right|thumb|[[Michael White (clarinetist)|Dr Michael White]] (front right) plays clarinet at a jazz funeral in Treme, [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].]]

The clarinet was a central instrument in early jazz starting in the 1910s and remained popular in the United States through the [[big band]] era into the 1940s.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt; [[Larry Shields]], [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]], [[Jimmie Noone]] and [[Sidney Bechet]] were influential in early jazz. The B{{music|flat}} soprano was the most common instrument, but a few early jazz musicians such as [[Louis Nelson Delisle]] and [[Alcide Nunez]] preferred the C soprano, and many New Orleans jazz brass bands have used E{{music|flat}} soprano.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt;

Swing clarinetists such as [[Benny Goodman]], [[Artie Shaw]], and [[Woody Herman]] led successful and [[popular music|popular]] big bands and smaller groups from the 1930s onward.&lt;ref&gt;Schuller, Gunther. ''The swing era''. Oxford University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; With the decline of the big bands' popularity in the late 1940s, the clarinet faded from its prominent position in jazz, though a few players ([[John Carter (jazz musician)|John Carter]], [[Buddy DeFranco]], [[Eric Dolphy]], [[Jimmy Giuffre]], [[Perry Robinson]], [[Theo Jorgensmann]] and others) used clarinet in [[bebop]] and [[free jazz]]. The clarinet's place in the jazz ensemble was usurped by the [[saxophone]], which projects a more powerful sound and uses a less complicated fingering system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/05/arts/john-carter-s-case-for-the-clarinet.html John Carter's Case For The Clarinet] by Robert Palmer, Published: July 5, 1981, New York Times. Retrieved April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s and 1960s, Britain underwent a surge in the popularity of [[Trad jazz|traditional jazz]]. During this period, a British clarinetist named [[Acker Bilk]] became popular, founding his own ensemble in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaufman|first=Will|coauthors=Heidi Slettedahl Macpherson|title=Britain and the Americas|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005|isbn=1851094318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilk had a string of successful records, including the popular &quot;[[Stranger on the Shore]]&quot;.

In the U.S., the instrument has seen something of a resurgence since the 1980s, with [[Eddie Daniels]], [[Don Byron]], and [[Marty Ehrlich]] and others playing the clarinet in more contemporary contexts.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt; The instrument remains common in [[Dixieland]] music; [[Pete Fountain]] is one of the best known performers in this genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.experienceneworleans.com/pete.html|title=A Closer Walk with Pete Fountain|last=Compagno|first=Nick|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Wilber]], active since the 1950s, is a more eclectic jazz clarinetist, playing in several classic jazz styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilber|first=Bob|title=Music Was Not Enough|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988|isbn=0333444183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filmmaker [[Woody Allen]] is a notable jazz clarinet enthusiast, and performs New Orleans-style jazz regularly with his quartet in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woodyallenband.com |title=New Orleans Trombone, Jerry Zigmont - Jazz Trombone, Eddy Davis &amp; His New Orleans Jazz Band featuring Woody Allen, Cafe Carlyle, Woody Allen Band |accessdate=2008-01-17 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; - [[Jean-Christian Michel]], French composer and clarinetist has initiated a jazz-classical cross-over on the clarinet with the drummer [[Kenny Clarke]].

=== Other genres ===
In [[rock music|rock]] the clarinet is used very rarely.

Clarinets also feature prominently in [[klezmer]] music, which entails a distinctive style of playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/768201|last=Slobin|first=Mark|year=1984|title=Klezmer Music: An American Ethnic Genre|journal=[[Yearbook for Traditional Music]]|publisher=International Council for Traditional Music|volume=16|pages=34–41|jstor=768201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of quarter-tones requires a different embouchure.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt; Some klezmer musicians prefer Albert system clarinets.&lt;ref name=&quot;hoeprich&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoeprich|first=Eric|title=The Clarinet|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2008|isbn=0300102828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular [[Brazil]]ian music styles of [[choro]] and [[samba]] use the clarinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Livingston-Isenhour|first=Tamara Elena|coauthors=Thomas George Caracas Garcia|title=Choro|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2005|isbn=0253345413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent contemporary players include Paulo Moura, Naylor 'Proveta' Azevedo, Paulo Sérgio dos Santos and [[Paquito D'Rivera]].

The clarinet is prominent in Bulgarian wedding music, an offshoot of Roma/Romani traditional music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowlett|first=M|title=The Clarinet in Bulgarian Wedding Music|publisher=Florida State University|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivo Papazov]] is a well-known clarinetist in this genre. In [[Moravia]]n [[Hammered dulcimer|dulcimer]] bands, the clarinet is usually the only wind instrument among string instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Broughton|first=Simon|coauthors=Mark Ellingham, Richard Trillo, Orla Duane, Vanessa Dowell|title=World Music|publisher=Rough Guides|year=1999|isbn=185828113X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Former Yugoslav [[Republic of Macedonia]], old-town folk music -called chalgija (&quot;чалгија&quot;), the clarinet has the most important role in wedding music; clarinet solos mark the high point of dancing euphoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEIkphIDuYM|title=Tale Ognenovski and Chalgiite MRTV - Nevestinsko oro|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most renowned Macedonian clarinet players is [[Tale Ognenovski]], who gained worldwide fame for his virtuosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taleognenovski.com.mk/|title=Tale Ognenovski, Musical Genius, Clarinetist And Composer|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greece]] the clarinet (usually referred to as &quot;κλαρίνο&quot; - &quot;clarino&quot;) is prominent in traditional music, especially in central, northwest and northern Greece ([[Thessaly]], [[Epirus (periphery)|Epirus]] and Macedonia).&lt;ref name=&quot;pappas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekfolkmusicanddance.com/instrumentation.php|title=Greek Folk Instrument Groups|last=Pappas|first=John|year=1998|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The double-reed [[zurna]] was the dominant woodwind instrument before the clarinet arrived in the country, although many Greeks regard the clarinet as a native instrument.&lt;ref name=&quot;hoeprich&quot;/&gt; Traditional dance music, wedding music and laments include a clarinet soloist and quite often improvisations.&lt;ref name=&quot;pappas&quot;/&gt; Petroloukas Chalkias is a famous clarinetist in this genre.

The instrument is equally famous in [[Turkey]], especially the soprano clarinet in G. The soprano clarinet crossed via Turkey to [[Arabic music]], where it is widely used in [[Arabic pop]], especially if the intention of the arranger is to imitate the Turkish style.&lt;ref name=&quot;hoeprich&quot;/&gt;

=== Groups of clarinets ===
[[Image:Clarinette metal CAlt CBas.jpg|thumb|Contrabass and contra-alto clarinets]]
Groups of clarinets playing together have become increasingly popular among clarinet enthusiasts in recent years. Common forms are:
* [[Clarinet choir]], which features a large number of clarinets playing together, usually involves a range of different members of the clarinet family (see [[clarinet#Extended family of clarinets|Extended family of clarinets]]). The homogeneity of tone across the different members of the clarinet family produces an effect with some similarities to a human [[choir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3343790|last=Weerts|first=Richard|title=The Clarinet Choir|journal=Journal of Research in Music Education|publisher=MENC|volume=12|issue=3|pages=227–230|year=1964|jstor=3343790}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clarinet quartet, usually three B{{music|flat}} sopranos and one B{{music|flat}} bass, or two B{{music|flat}}, an E{{music|flat}} Alto Clarinet, and a B{{music|flat}} Bass Clarinet, or sometimes four B{{music|flat}} sopranos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3386973|last=Seay|first=Albert E.|date=September–October 1948|title=Modern Composers and the Wind Ensemble|journal=Music Educators Journal|publisher=MENC|volume=35|issue=1|pages=27–28|jstor=3386973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarinet choirs and quartets often play arrangements of both classical and popular music, in addition to a body of literature specially written for a combination of clarinets by composers such as [[Arnold Cooke]], [[Alfred Uhl]], [[Daniel Theaker]], [[Lucien Caillet]] and [[Václav Nelhýbel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarinetinstitute.com/CI%20Quartet%20Project.htm|title=Clarinet Quartet Project|publisher=Clarinet Institute|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extended family of clarinets ==
{{Main|Clarinet family}}
There is a [[family (musical instruments)|family]] of many differently pitched clarinet types, some of which are very rare. The following are the most important sizes, from highest to lowest:

'''Chojnów''' {{IPAc-pl|AUD|Pl-Chojnów.ogg|'|h|o|j|n|u|f}} ({{lang-de|Haynau}}) is a small town in [[Legnica County]], [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship]], in south-western [[Poland]]. It is located on the Skora river, a tributary of the [[Kaczawa]] at an average altitude of {{m to ft|170|abbr=y}} above sea level. Chojnów is the administrative seat of the rural [[gmina]] called [[Gmina Chojnów]], although the town is not part of its territory and forms a separate urban gmina. As of 2006 it had 14,389 inhabitants. 

Chojnów is located {{km to mi|18|abbr=y}} west of [[Legnica]], {{km to mi|26|abbr=y}} east from [[Bolesławiec]] and {{km to mi|18|abbr=y}} north of [[Złotoryja]], {{km to mi|5|abbr=y}} from the [[A4 autostrada (Poland)|A4 motorway]]. It has railroad connections to Bolesławiec and Legnica.

==History==
The settlement of ''Haynow'' was mentioned in a 1272 deed. It was already called a ''civitas'' in a 1288 document issued by the [[Silesian Piasts|Piast]] duke [[Henry V, Duke of Legnica|Henry V of Legnica]], and officially received [[town privileges]] in 1333.

After World War II and the implementation of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] in 1945, the town passed to the [[People's Republic of Poland|Republic of Poland]]. The [[Germans|German]] population was [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|expelled]] from the region.

==Chojnów today==
Chojnów is an industrial and agricultural town. Among local products are: paper, agricultural machinery, chains, metal furniture for hospitals, equipment for the meat industry, beer, wine, leather clothing, and clothing for infants, children and adults. The local government-run weekly newspaper is [[Gazeta Chojnowska]], which has been published since 1992.

Among the interesting monuments of Chojnów are the 13th century castle of the [[Duchy of Legnica|Dukes of Legnica]] (currently used as a museum), two old churches, the ''Baszta Tkaczy'' (''Weavers' Tower'') and preserved fragments of city walls. 

The biggest green area in Chojnów is small forest ''Park Piastowski'' (''Piast's Park''), named after the Polish [[Piast dynasty]]. Wild animals that can be found in the Chojnów area are roe-deer (''sarna'', [[Capreolus capraea]] ?), [[fox]]es, [[rabbit]]s and wild domestic animals, especially cats.

Every year in the first days of June, the ''Days of Chojnów'' (''Dni Chojnowa'') are celebrated. The Whole-Poland bike race ''Masters'' has been organized yearly in Chojnów for the past few years.

'''Canes Venatici''' is one of the 88 official modern [[constellation]]s.  It is a small northern constellation that was created by [[Johannes Hevelius]] in the 17th century. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;[[hunting dog]]s&quot;, and the constellation is often depicted in illustrations as representing the dogs of [[Boötes]] the Herdsman, a neighboring constellation.

==History==

The stars of Canes Venatici are not bright. In classical times, they were included by [[Ptolemy]] within the constellation [[Ursa Major]] in his [[star catalogue]].  α CVn was Ptolemy's &quot;28th of Ursa Major&quot;, and β CVn was his &quot;29th of Ursa Major&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In the [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], the identification of these stars with the dogs of Boötes arose through a mistranslation.  Some of Boötes' stars were traditionally described as representing the [[Club (weapon)|club]] ([[Greek language|Greek]], Κολλοροβος) of Boötes. When the Greek astronomer Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' was translated from Greek to [[Arabic]], the translator [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq|Johannitius]] (following [[Al Biruni|Alberuni]]) did not know the Greek word and rendered it as the nearest-looking Arabic word, writing العصى ذات الكلاب in ordinary unvowelled Arabic text &quot;''al-`aşā dhāt al-kullāb''&quot;, which means &quot;the spearshaft having a hook&quot;. When the Arabic text was translated into [[Latin]], the translator [[Gerard of Cremona]] (probably in Spain) mistook the Arabic word كلاب for ''kilāb'' (the plural of  كلب ''kalb''), meaning &quot;dogs&quot;, writing ''hastile habens canes'' (&quot;spearshaft having dogs&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Allen (1963). p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Canes Venatici.gif|left|200px|thumb|Canes Venatici depicted in Hevelius' star atlas.]]

These spurious dogs floated about the astronomical literature until [[Johannes Hevelius|Hevelius]] decided to specify their presence in the sky by making them a separate constellation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/canesvenatici.htm Star Tales: Canes Venatici]&lt;/ref&gt; Hevelius chose the name ''Asterion'' (from the Greek 'αστέριον, meaning the &quot;little star&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Notable features==
===Stars===
Canes Venatici contains no bright stars, α and β CVn being only of 3rd and 4th [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] respectively.
The constellation's brightest [[star]] is [[Cor Caroli]] (α² CVn), named by Sir [[Charles Scarborough]] in memory of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], the deposed king of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;According to R. H. Allen (''Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning''), the star was named by Halley for Charles II &quot;at the suggestion of the court physician Sir Charles Scarborough, who said it had shone with special brilliance on the eve of the king's return to London, May 29, 1660&quot;. According to Deborah J. Warner (''The Sky Explored: Celestial Cartography 1500-1800''), it was originally named &quot;Cor Caroli Regis Martyris&quot; (&quot;The Heart of King Charles the Martyr&quot;) for Charles I. According to Robert Burnham, Jr. (''Burnham's Celestial Handbook'', Volume 1), &quot;the attribution of the name to Halley appears in a report published by [[Johann Elert Bode|J. E. Bode]] at Berlin in 1801, but seems to have no other verification&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is of [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 2.90.

[[La Superba]] (Y CVn) is a [[semiregular variable star]] that varies between magnitudes 4.7 and 6.2 over a period of around 158 days.  It is a [[carbon star]] and is famous for being deep red. [[AM Canum Venaticorum|AM CVn]], a very blue star of magnitude 14, is the prototype of a special class of [[cataclysmic variable star]]s, in which the companion star is a [[white dwarf]], rather than a [[main sequence star]]. [[RS Canum Venaticorum|RS CVn]] is the prototype of a [[RS Canum Venaticorum variable|special class of binary stars]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://simbad3.u-strasbg.fr/sim-id.pl?protocol=html&amp;Ident=RS+CVn SIMBAD Query Result: RS CVn -- Variable of RS CVn type] on the SIMBAD database&lt;/ref&gt; of [[chromosphere|chromospherically]] active and optically [[variable star|variable]] components.

===Deep sky objects===
Canes Venatici contains five [[Messier object]]s, including four [[galaxy|galaxies]]. One of the more significant galaxies in Canes Venatici is the [[Whirlpool Galaxy]] (M51, NGC 5194) and [[NGC 5195]], a small barred [[spiral galaxy]] that is seen face on. This was the first galaxy recognised as having a spiral structure, this structure being first observed by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]] in 1845.

Other notable spiral galaxies in Canes Venatici are the [[Sunflower Galaxy]] (M63, NGC 5055), [[Messier 94]] (NGC 4736), and [[Messier 106]] (NGC 4258).

[[Messier 3]] (NGC 5272) is a [[globular cluster]].  It is 18' in diameter, and at magnitude 6.3 is bright enough to be seen with [[binoculars]].

'''Chamaeleon''' is a small [[constellation]] in the southern sky. It is named after the [[chameleon]], a form of [[lizard]]. It was first defined in the sixteenth century. In [[Australia]] it is sometimes unofficially called &quot;the Frying Pan&quot; when finding south by the stars.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==History==
Chamaeleon was one of twelve constellations created by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]]. It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in [[Amsterdam]] by Plancius and [[Jodocus Hondius]]. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.

This constellation were classified in ''[[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|The Southern Asterisms]]'' (近南極星區, ''Jìnnánjíxīngōu'') as ''[[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|Little Dipper]]'' (小斗, ''Xiǎodǒu'') by [[Xu Guangqi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060728.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 28 日]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable features==
In 1999, a nearby [[open cluster]] was discovered centered on the star [[Eta Chamaeleontis|η Chamaeleontis]]. The cluster, known as either
the [[Eta Chamaeleontis cluster]] or Mamajek 1, is 8 million years old, and lies 316 [[light years]] from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Luhman, K.L. &amp; Steeghs, D. 2004, ApJ, 609, 917&lt;/ref&gt;

The constellation contains a number of [[molecular clouds]] (the Chamaeleon dark clouds) that are forming low-mass [[T Tauri star]]s. The cloud complex lies some 400 to 600 [[light years]] from Earth, and contains tens of thousands of solar masses of gas and dust. The most prominent cluster of T Tauri stars and young B-type stars are in the Chamaeleon I cloud, and are associated with the reflection nebula [[IC 2631]].

==Chamaeleon complex==

The Chamaeleon complex is a large star forming region (SFR) that includes the Chamaeleon I, Chamaeleon II, and Chamaeleon III dark clouds. It occupies nearly all of the constellation and overlaps into [[Apus (constellation)|Apus]], [[Musca (constellation)|Musca]], and [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]]. The mean density of X-ray sources is about one source per square degree.&lt;ref name=Alcala&gt;{{ cite journal |author=Alcala JM, Krautter J, Schmitt JHMM, Covino E, Wichmann R, Mundt R |title=A study of the Chamaeleon star forming region from the ROSAT all-sky survey.

'''Cholesterol''' is a waxy [[steroid]] of fat that is manufactured in the liver or intestines. It is used to produce hormones and cell membranes and is transported in the [[blood plasma]] of all [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cholesterol&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Emma Leah | title = Cholesterol | journal = Lipidomics Gateway | year = 2009 | month = May | doi = 10.1038/lipidmaps.2009.3 | url = http://www.lipidmaps.org/update/2009/090501/full/lipidmaps.2009.3.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an essential structural component of mammalian cell membranes. It is required to establish proper [[membrane permeability]] and [[membrane fluidity|fluidity]]. In addition cholesterol is an important component for the [[biosynthesis|manufacture]] of [[bile acid]]s, [[steroid hormone]]s, and [[Vitamin D]]. Cholesterol is the principal [[sterol]] synthesized by animals; however, small quantities can be synthesized in [[eukaryote]]s such as [[plant]]s and [[fungus|fungi]]. It is almost completely absent among [[prokaryote]]s including bacteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14660793&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pearson A, Budin M, Brocks JJ | title = Phylogenetic and biochemical evidence for sterol synthesis in the bacterium Gemmata obscuriglobus | journal = Proc.

The name cholesterol originates from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''chole-'' ([[bile]]) and ''stereos'' (solid), and the [[chemical]] [[suffix]] ''-ol'' for an alcohol.  [[François Poulletier de la Salle]] first identified cholesterol in solid form in [[gallstone]]s, in 1769. However, it was only in 1815 that chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul|Eugène Chevreul]] named the compound &quot;cholesterine&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9478044&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Olson RE | title = Discovery of the lipoproteins, their role in fat transport and their significance as risk factors | journal = J.

== Physiology ==
Since cholesterol is essential for all animal life, it is primarily synthesized from simpler substances within the body. However, high levels in blood circulation, depending on how it is transported within [[lipoproteins]], are strongly associated with progression of [[atherosclerosis]]. For a person of about 68&amp;nbsp;kg (150 pounds), typical total body cholesterol synthesis is about 1 g (1,000&amp;nbsp;mg) per day, and total body content is about 35 g. Typical daily additional dietary intake in the United States is 200–300&amp;nbsp;mg. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The body compensates for cholesterol intake by reducing the amount synthesized.

Cholesterol is recycled. It is excreted by the liver via the bile into the digestive tract. Typically about 50% of the excreted cholesterol is reabsorbed by the small bowel back into the bloodstream. [[Phytosterols]] can compete with cholesterol reabsorption in the intestinal tract, thus reducing cholesterol reabsorption.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17218830&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=John S, Sorokin AV, Thompson PD |title=Phytosterols and vascular disease |journal=Curr. Opin. Lipidol. |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=35–40 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17218830 |doi=10.1097/MOL.0b013e328011e9e3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Function ===

Cholesterol is required to build and maintain [[Cell membrane|membranes]]; it modulates [[membrane fluidity]] over the range of physiological temperatures. The [[hydroxyl]] group on cholesterol interacts with the [[Polar molecules|polar]] head groups of the [[lipid bilayer|membrane]] [[phospholipid]]s and [[sphingolipid]]s, while the bulky [[steroid]] and the [[hydrocarbon]] chain are embedded in the membrane, alongside the [[Polar_molecules#Non-polar_molecules|nonpolar]] [[Fatty acid|fatty acid chain]] of the other lipids. In this structural role, cholesterol reduces the permeability of the plasma membrane to protons (positive [[hydrogen]] ions) and [[sodium ion]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haines_2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Haines TH | title = Do sterols reduce proton and sodium leaks through lipid bilayers? | journal = Prog. Lipid Res. | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 299–324 | year = 2001 | month = July | pmid = 11412894 | doi = 10.1016/S0163-7827(01)00009-1 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the cell membrane, cholesterol also functions in intracellular transport, cell signaling and nerve conduction.  Cholesterol is essential for the structure and function of invaginated [[caveolae]] and [[clathrin]]-coated pits, including caveola-dependent and clathrin-dependent [[endocytosis]]. The role of cholesterol in such endocytosis can be investigated by using [[methyl beta cyclodextrin]] (MβCD) to remove cholesterol from the plasma membrane.  Recently, cholesterol has also been implicated in cell signaling processes, assisting in the formation of [[lipid rafts]] in the [[plasma membrane]].  In many neurons, a [[myelin]] sheath, rich in cholesterol, since it is derived from compacted layers of [[Schwann cell]] membrane, provides insulation for more efficient conduction of impulses.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-7817-5056-3&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Pawlina, Wojciech; Ross, Michael W. | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Histology: a text and atlas: with correlated cell and molecular biology | edition = | language = | publisher = Lippincott Wiliams &amp; Wilkins | location = Philadelphia | year = 2006 | origyear = | pages = 230 | quote = | isbn = 0-7817-5056-3 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within cells, cholesterol is the precursor molecule in several biochemical pathways.  In the liver, cholesterol is converted to [[bile]], which is then stored in the [[gallbladder]].  Bile contains bile salts, which solubilize fats in the digestive tract and aid in the intestinal absorption of fat molecules as well as the fat-soluble vitamins, [[Vitamin A]], [[Vitamin D]], [[Vitamin E]], and [[Vitamin K]].  Cholesterol is an important precursor molecule for the synthesis of Vitamin D and the [[steroid hormones]], including the [[adrenal gland]] hormones [[cortisol]] and [[aldosterone]] as well as the sex hormones [[progesterone]], [[estrogen]]s, and [[testosterone]], and their derivatives.

Some research indicates that cholesterol may act as an [[antioxidant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_1991&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smith LL | title = Another cholesterol hypothesis: cholesterol as antioxidant | journal = Free Radic. Biol. Med. | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–61 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1937129 | doi = 10.1016/0891-5849(91)90187-8 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dietary sources ===

[[Animal fat]]s are complex mixtures of [[triglyceride]]s, with lesser amounts of [[phospholipid]]s and cholesterol. As a consequence, all foods containing animal fat contain cholesterol to varying extents.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-9531949-5-7&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Christie, William | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Lipid analysis: isolation, separation, identification, and structural analysis of lipids | edition = | language = | publisher = Oily Press | location = Ayr, Scotland | year = 2003 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-9531949-5-7 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major dietary sources of cholesterol include [[cheese]], [[egg yolk]]s, [[beef]], [[pork]], [[poultry]], and [[shrimp]].&lt;ref name=USDA/&gt;

Human [[breast milk]] also contains significant quantities of cholesterol.&lt;ref name=ajcn-breastmilk&gt;{{cite journal | author=Jensen RG, Hagerty MM, McMahon  KE | title=Lipids of human milk and infant formulas: a review | journal=Am J Clin Nutr | date=1 June 1978| pages=990–1016 | volume=31  | pmid=352132 | url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/31/6/990 | format=PDF | issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of cholesterol present in plant-based food sources is generally much lower than animal based sources.&lt;ref name=USDA&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 21 | publisher = United States Department of Agriculture | url = http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/Data/SR21/nutrlist/sr21w601.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate = 2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Behrman_2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Behrman EJ,  Gopalan V | title = Cholesterol and Plants  | journal = J. Chem. Educ. | year = 2005 | month = December | volume = 82 | issue = 12 | pages = 1791 | doi = 10.1021/ed082p1791}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, plant products such as [[flax seed]]s and [[peanut]]s contain cholesterol-like compounds called [[phytosterols]], which are suggested to help lower [[blood serum|serum]] cholesterol levels.&lt;ref name=ostlund2003&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ostlund RE, Racette, SB, and Stenson WF | title=Inhibition of cholesterol absorption by phytosterol-replete wheat germ compared with phytosterol-depleted wheat germ | journal=Am J Clin Nutr | year=2003 | pages=1385–1589 | volume=77 | issue=6 |pmid=12791614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Total fat intake, especially [[saturated fat]] and [[trans fat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 66 | page = 1006S–1010S | title = &quot;Health effects of ''trans'' fatty acids&quot; (review article) | accessdate = 2009-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; plays a larger role in blood cholesterol than intake of cholesterol itself.  Saturated fat is present in full fat dairy products, animal fats, several types of oil and chocolate. Trans fats are typically derived from the partial hydrogenation of unsaturated fats, and do not occur in significant amounts in nature. Trans fat is most often encountered in margarine and hydrogenated vegetable fat, and consequently in many fast foods, snack foods, and fried or baked goods.

A change in diet in addition to other lifestyle modifications may help reduce blood cholesterol.  Avoiding animal products may decrease the cholesterol levels in the body not only by reducing the quantity of cholesterol consumed but also by reducing the quantity of cholesterol synthesized. Those wishing to reduce their cholesterol through a change in diet should aim to consume less than 7% of their daily energy needs {metric units  [[Joules]] (J) or (kJ), pre-[[SI]] [[calorie]]s (Cal) or (kcal)} from animal fat and fewer than 200&amp;nbsp;mg of cholesterol per day.&lt;ref name=DGA&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Dietary Guidlines for Americans 2005 | publisher = United States Department of Agriculture | url =http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2005/document/pdf/DGA2005.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate = 2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synthesis ===

All animal cells manufacture cholesterol with relative production rates varying by cell type and organ function. About 20–25% of total daily cholesterol production occurs in the [[liver]]; other sites of higher synthesis rates include the [[intestines]], [[adrenal gland]]s, and [[reproductive organ]]s.  Synthesis within the body starts with one molecule of [[acetyl CoA]] and one molecule of [[acetoacetyl-CoA]], which are dehydrated to form [[3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA]] ([[HMG-CoA]]).  This molecule is then reduced to [[mevalonate]] by the enzyme [[HMG-CoA reductase]].  This step is the regulated, rate-limiting and irreversible step in cholesterol synthesis and is the site of action for the [[statins|statin]] drugs (HMG-CoA reductase competitive inhibitors).

Mevalonate is then converted to 3-isopentenyl pyrophosphate in three reactions that require [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].  This molecule is decarboxylated to [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]], which is a key metabolite for various biological reactions.  Three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate condense to form [[farnesyl pyrophosphate]] through the action of geranyl transferase.  Two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate then condense to form [[squalene]] by the action of [[squalene synthase]] in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]].  Oxidosqualene cyclase then cyclizes squalene to form [[lanosterol]].  Finally, lanosterol is then converted to cholesterol.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-7167-2009-4&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Rhodes, Carl; Stryer, Lubert; Tasker, Roy | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Biochemistry | edition = 4th | language = | publisher = W.H.

[[Konrad Bloch]] and [[Feodor Lynen]] shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1964 for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of cholesterol and [[fatty acid metabolism]].

=== Regulation of cholesterol synthesis ===

Biosynthesis of cholesterol is directly regulated by the cholesterol levels present, though the [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] mechanisms involved are only partly understood. A higher intake from food leads to a net decrease in endogenous production, whereas lower intake from food has the opposite effect. The main regulatory mechanism is the sensing of [[intracellular]] cholesterol in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] by the [[protein]] [[sterol regulatory element binding protein|SREBP]] (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and 2).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17666007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Espenshade PJ, Hughes AL | title = Regulation of sterol synthesis in eukaryotes | journal = Annu. Rev. Genet. | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 401–27 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17666007 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.41.110306.130315 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of cholesterol, SREBP is bound to two other proteins: SCAP (SREBP-cleavage-activating protein) and [[Insig1]]. When cholesterol levels fall, Insig-1 dissociates from the SREBP-SCAP complex, allowing the complex to migrate to the [[Golgi apparatus]], where SREBP is cleaved by S1P and S2P (site-1 and -2 protease), two enzymes that are activated by SCAP when cholesterol levels are low. The cleaved SREBP then migrates to the nucleus and acts as a [[transcription factor]] to bind to the [[Sterol regulatory element|SRE]] (sterol regulatory element), which stimulates the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of many genes. Among these are the low-density lipoprotein ([[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]]) receptor and [[HMG-CoA reductase]]. The former scavenges circulating LDL from the bloodstream, whereas HMG-CoA reductase leads to an increase of endogenous production of cholesterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Brown MS, Goldstein JL | title=The SREBP pathway: regulation of cholesterol metabolism by proteolysis of a membrane-bound transcription factor | year=1997 | journal=Cell | volume=89 | pages=331–40 | pmid=9150132 | doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80213-5 | url= | issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A large part of this signaling pathway was clarified by Dr. [[Michael S. Brown]] and Dr. [[Joseph L. Goldstein]] in the 1970s. In 1985, they received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their work. Their subsequent work shows how the SREBP pathway regulates expression of many genes that control lipid formation and metabolism and body fuel allocation.

Cholesterol synthesis can be turned off when cholesterol levels are high, as well.  HMG CoA reductase contains both a cytosolic domain (responsible for its catalytic function) and a membrane domain.  The membrane domain functions to sense signals for its degradation.  Increasing concentrations of cholesterol (and other sterols) cause a change in this domain's oligomerization state, which makes it more susceptible to destruction by the [[proteosome]].  This enzyme's activity can also be reduced by phosphorylation by an AMP-activated protein [[kinase]].  Because this kinase is activated by AMP, which is produced when ATP is hydrolyzed, it follows that cholesterol synthesis is halted when ATP levels are low.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-7167-4955-6&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Tymoczko, John L.; Stryer Berg Tymoczko; Stryer, Lubert; Berg, Jeremy Mark | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Biochemistry | edition = | language = | publisher = W.H.

=== Plasma transport and regulation of absorption ===
{{See also|Blood lipids}}

Cholesterol is only slightly soluble in [[water]]; it can dissolve and travel in the water-based bloodstream at exceedingly small concentrations. Since cholesterol is insoluble in blood, it is transported in the circulatory system within [[lipoprotein]]s, complex discoidal particles which have an exterior composed of [[amphiphile|amphiphilic]] proteins and lipids whose outward-facing surfaces are water-soluble and inward-facing surfaces are lipid-soluble; [[triglycerides]] and cholesterol esters are carried internally. Phospholipids and cholesterol, being amphipathic, are transported in the surface monolayer of the lipoprotein particle.

In addition to providing a soluble means for transporting cholesterol through the blood, lipoproteins have cell-targeting signals that direct the lipids they carry to certain tissues. For this reason, there are several types of lipoproteins within blood called, in order of increasing density, [[chylomicron]]s, [[very-low-density lipoprotein]] (VLDL), [[intermediate-density lipoprotein]] (IDL), [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL), and [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL).   The more cholesterol and less protein a lipoprotein has the less dense it is.  The cholesterol within all the various lipoproteins is identical, although some cholesterol is carried as the &quot;free&quot; alcohol and some is carried as fatty acyl esters referred to as cholesterol esters. However, the different lipoproteins contain [[apolipoproteins]], which serve as ligands for specific receptors on cell membranes.  In this way, the lipoprotein particles are molecular addresses that determine the start- and endpoints for cholesterol transport.

Chylomicrons, the least dense type of cholesterol transport molecules, contain [[apolipoprotein B-48]], [[apolipoprotein C]], and [[apolipoprotein E]] in their shells.  Chylomicrons are the transporters that carry fats from the intestine to muscle and other tissues that need fatty acids for energy or fat production.  Cholesterol which is not used by muscles remains in more cholesterol-rich chylomicron remnants, which are taken up from the bloodstream by the liver.

VLDL molecules are produced by the liver and contain excess triacylglycerol and cholesterol that is not required by the liver for synthesis of bile acids.  These molecules contain [[apolipoprotein B100]] and apolipoprotein E in their shell.  During transport in the bloodstream, the blood vessel cleave and absorb more triacylglycerol from IDL molecules, which contain an even higher percentage of cholesterol.  The IDL molecules have two possible fates:  Half are into metabolism by [[HTGL]], taken up by the LDL receptor on the liver cell surfaces and the other half continue to lose triacylglycerols in the bloodstream until they form LDL molecules, which have the highest percentage of cholesterol within them.

LDL molecules, therefore, are the major carriers of cholesterol in the blood, and each one contains approximately 1,500 molecules of cholesterol ester.  The shell of the LDL molecule contains just one molecule of apolipoprotein B100, which is recognized by the [[LDL receptor]] in peripheral tissues.  Upon binding of apolipoprotein B100, many LDL receptors become localized in [[clathrin]]-coated pits.  Both the LDL and its receptor are internalized by [[endocytosis]] to form a vesicle within the cell.  The vesicle then fuses with a [[lysosome]], which has an enzyme called [[Lysosomal lipase|lysosomal acid lipase]] that hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters.  Now within the cell, the cholesterol can be used for membrane biosynthesis or esterified and stored within the cell, so as to not interfere with cell membranes.

Synthesis of the LDL receptor is regulated by [[SREBP]], the same regulatory protein as was used to control synthesis of cholesterol de novo in response to cholesterol presence in the cell.  When the cell has abundant cholesterol, LDL receptor synthesis is blocked so that new cholesterol in the form of LDL molecules cannot be taken up.  On the converse, more LDL receptors are made when the cell is deficient in cholesterol.  When this system is deregulated, many LDL molecules appear in the blood without receptors on the peripheral tissues.  These LDL molecules are oxidized and taken up by [[macrophages]], which become engorged and form foam cells.  These cells often become trapped in the walls of blood vessels and contribute to [[atheroma|artherosclerotic plaque]] formation.  Differences in cholesterol homeostasis affect the development of early atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20976107&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weingärtner O, Pinsdorf T, Rogacev KS, Blömer L, Grenner Y, Gräber S, Ulrich C, Girndt M, Böhm M, Fliser D, Laufs U, Lütjohann D, Heine GH | title = The relationships of markers of cholesterol homeostasis with carotid intima-media thickness | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = e13467 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20976107 | pmc = 2956704 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013467 | url = | issn = | editor1-last = Federici | editor1-first = Massimo }}&lt;/ref&gt; These plaques are the main causes of heart attacks, strokes, and other serious medical problems, leading to the association of so-called LDL cholesterol (actually a [[lipoprotein]]) with &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-7167-4955-6&quot;/&gt;

=== Metabolism, recycling and excretion ===

Cholesterol is susceptible to oxidation and easily forms oxygenated derivatives known as [[oxysterol]]s.  Three different mechanisms can form these; autoxidation, secondary oxidation to lipid peroxidation, and cholesterol metabolizing enzyme oxidation. A great interest in oxysterols arose when it was shown they exert inhibitory actions on cholesterol biosynthesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid663671&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kandutsch AA, Chen HW, Heiniger HJ | title = Biological activity of some oxygenated sterols | journal = Science | volume = 201 | issue = 4355 | pages = 498–501 | year = 1978 | month = August | pmid = 663671 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This finding became known as the “oxysterol hypothesis”.

=== Hypercholesterolemia ===

{{Main|hypercholesterolemia|lipid hypothesis}}
According to the [[lipid hypothesis]], abnormal cholesterol levels ([[hypercholesterolemia]])—that is, higher concentrations of LDL and lower concentrations of functional HDL—are strongly associated with [[cardiovascular disease]] because these promote [[atheroma]] development in arteries ([[atherosclerosis]]). This disease process leads to [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), [[stroke]], and [[peripheral vascular disease]]. Since higher blood LDL, especially higher LDL particle concentrations and smaller LDL particle size, contribute to this process more than the cholesterol content of the LDL particles,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18375431&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brunzell JD, Davidson M, Furberg CD, Goldberg RB, Howard BV, Stein JH, Witztum JL | title = Lipoprotein management in patients with cardiometabolic risk: consensus statement from the American Diabetes Association and the American College of Cardiology Foundation | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 811–22 | year = 2008 | month = April | pmid = 18375431 | doi = 10.2337/dc08-9018 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; LDL particles are often termed &quot;bad cholesterol&quot; because they have been linked to atheroma formation. On the other hand, high concentrations of functional HDL, which can remove cholesterol from cells and atheroma, offer protection and are sometimes referred to as &quot;good cholesterol&quot;. These balances are mostly genetically determined but can be changed by body build, [[medication]]s, food choices, and other factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12957096&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Durrington P | title = Dyslipidaemia | journal = Lancet | volume = 362 | issue = 9385 | pages = 717–31 | year = 2003 | month = August | pmid = 12957096 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14234-1 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions with elevated concentrations of oxidized LDL particles, especially &quot;small dense LDL&quot; (sdLDL) particles, are associated with [[atheroma]] formation in the walls of [[artery|arteries]], a condition known as ''[[atherosclerosis]]'', which is the principal cause of [[coronary heart disease]] and other forms of [[cardiovascular disease]]. In contrast, HDL particles (especially large HDL) have been identified as a mechanism by which cholesterol and inflammatory mediators can be removed from atheroma. Increased concentrations of HDL correlate with lower rates of atheroma progressions and even regression. A 2007 study pooling data on almost 900,000 subjects in 61 cohorts demonstrated that blood total cholesterol levels have an exponential effect on cardiovascular and total mortality, with the association more pronounced in younger subjects. Still, because cardiovascular disease is relatively rare in the younger population, the impact of high cholesterol on health is still larger in older people.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18061058&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lewington S, Whitlock G, Clarke R, Sherliker P, Emberson J, Halsey J, Qizilbash N, Peto R, Collins R | title = Blood cholesterol and vascular mortality by age, sex, and blood pressure: a meta-analysis of individual data from 61 prospective studies with 55,000 vascular deaths | journal = Lancet | volume = 370 | issue = 9602 | pages = 1829–39 | year = 2007 | month = December | pmid = 18061058 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61778-4 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as today's testing methods determine LDL (&quot;bad&quot;) and HDL (&quot;good&quot;) cholesterol separately, this simplistic view has become somewhat outdated. The desirable LDL level is considered to be less than 100&amp;nbsp;mg/dL (2.6 [[Mole (unit)|mmol]]/L),&lt;ref name=AHA&gt;[http://www.americanheart.org/cholesterol/about.jsp &quot;About cholesterol&quot;] – American Heart Association&lt;/ref&gt; although a newer upper limit of 70&amp;nbsp;mg/dL (1.8&amp;nbsp;mmol/L) can be considered in higher risk individuals based on some of the above-mentioned trials. A ratio of total cholesterol to HDL—another useful measure—of far less than 5:1 is thought to be healthier. Of note, typical LDL values for children before [[fatty streaks]] begin to develop is 35&amp;nbsp;mg/dL.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Total cholesterol is defined as the sum of HDL, LDL, and VLDL.  Usually, only the total, HDL, and triglycerides are measured.  For cost reasons, the VLDL is usually estimated as one-fifth of the triglycerides and the LDL is estimated using the Friedewald formula (or a [[LDL#Measurement_of_LDL|variant]]): estimated LDL = [total cholesterol] − [total HDL] − [estimated VLDL]. VLDL can be calculated by dividing total triglycerides by 5.  Direct LDL measures are used when triglycerides exceed 400&amp;nbsp;mg/dL.  The estimated VLDL and LDL have more error when triglycerides are above 400&amp;nbsp;mg/dL.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2297909&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Warnick GR, Knopp RH, Fitzpatrick V, Branson L | title = Estimating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by the Friedewald equation is adequate for classifying patients on the basis of nationally recommended cutpoints | journal = Clin.

Given the well-recognized role of cholesterol in cardiovascular disease, it is surprising that some studies have shown an inverse correlation between cholesterol levels and mortality. A 2009 study of patients with acute coronary syndromes found an association of hypercholesterolemia with better mortality outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|19645040}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Framingham Heart Study]], in subjects over 50 years of age they found an 11% increase overall and 14% increase in CVD mortality per 1&amp;nbsp;mg/dL per year drop in total cholesterol levels. The researchers attributed this phenomenon to the fact that people with severe chronic diseases or cancer tend to have below-normal cholesterol levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3560398&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Anderson KM, Castelli WP, Levy D | title = Cholesterol and mortality. 30 years of follow-up from the Framingham study | journal = JAMA | volume = 257 | issue = 16 | pages = 2176–80 | year = 1987 | month = April | pmid = 3560398 | doi = 10.1001/jama.257.16.2176| url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation is not supported by the Vorarlberg Health Monitoring and Promotion Programme, in which men of all ages and women over 50 with very low cholesterol were increasingly likely to die of cancer, liver diseases, and mental diseases.

=== Hypocholesterolemia ===

Abnormally low levels of cholesterol are termed ''[[hypocholesterolemia]]''. Research into the causes of this state is relatively limited, but some studies suggest a link with [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[cancer]], and [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. In general, the low cholesterol levels seem to be a consequence of an underlying illness, rather than a cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18061058&quot;/&gt;

=== Cholesterol testing ===
{{Globalize| section report US measures, whereas the measure in many places is mmol/L, into which they need to be converted, therefore the section|date=October 2009}}

A blood sample after 12-hour fasting is taken by a doctor or a home cholesterol-monitoring device to determine a [[lipid profile|lipoprotein profile]]. This measures total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, and triglycerides. It is recommended to test cholesterol at least every 5 years if a person has total cholesterol of 200&amp;nbsp;mg/dL or more, or if a man over age 45 or a woman over age 50 has HDL (good) cholesterol less than 40&amp;nbsp;mg/dL, or there are other risk factors for heart disease and stroke. (In different countries measurements are given in mg/dL or mmol/L; 1&amp;nbsp;mmol/L is 38.665&amp;nbsp;mg/dL.)

== Cholesteric liquid crystals ==

Some cholesterol derivatives, (among other simple cholesteric lipids) are known to generate the [[liquid crystal]]line ''cholesteric phase''. The cholesteric phase is in fact a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[Liquid crystal|nematic phase]], and changes colour when its temperature changes. This makes cholesterol derivatives useful for indicating temperature in [[liquid crystal display]] [[thermometer]]s and in temperature-sensitive paints.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{For|a non-technical introduction to the topic|Introduction to genetics}}
A '''chromosome''' is an organized structure of [[DNA]] and [[protein]] found in [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. It is a single piece of coiled DNA containing many [[gene]]s, [[regulatory sequence|regulatory elements]] and other [[genetic sequence|nucleotide sequences]]. Chromosomes also contain DNA-bound proteins, which serve to package the DNA and control its functions.

(2) [[Centromere]]&amp;nbsp;– the point where the two chromatids touch, and where the microtubules attach. (3) Short arm. (4) Long foot.]]

Chromosomes vary widely between different [[organism]]s. The DNA molecule may be circular or linear, and can be composed of 100,000 to 10,000,000,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paux E, Sourdille P, Salse J, ''et al.'' |title=A Physical Map of the 1-Gigabase Bread Wheat Chromosome 3B |journal=Science |volume=322 |issue=5898 |pages=101–104 |year=2008 |doi=10.1126/science.1161847 |pmid=18832645}}&lt;/ref&gt;    [[nucleotides]] in a long chain. Typically, [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells (cells with nuclei) have large linear chromosomes and [[prokaryotic]] cells (cells without defined nuclei) have smaller circular chromosomes, although there are many exceptions to this rule. Also, cells may contain more than one type of chromosome; for example, [[mitochondria]] in most [[eukaryotes]] and [[chloroplasts]] in plants have their own small chromosomes.

In eukaryotes, nuclear chromosomes are packaged by proteins into a condensed structure called [[chromatin]]. This allows the very long DNA molecules to fit into the [[cell nucleus]]. The structure of chromosomes and chromatin varies through the [[cell cycle]]. Chromosomes are the essential unit for cellular division and must be replicated, divided, and passed successfully to their daughter cells so as to ensure the genetic diversity and survival of their [[offspring|progeny]]. Chromosomes may exist as either duplicated or unduplicated. Unduplicated chromosomes are single linear strands, whereas duplicated chromosomes (copied during [[S phase|synthesis phase]]) contain two copies joined by a [[centromere]].

Compaction of the duplicated chromosomes during [[mitosis]] and [[meiosis]] results in the classic four-arm structure (pictured to the right). Chromosomal recombination plays a vital role in genetic diversity. If these structures are manipulated incorrectly, through processes known as chromosomal instability and translocation, the cell may undergo [[mitotic catastrophe]] and die, or it may unexpectedly evade [[apoptosis]] leading to the progression of [[cancer]].

In practice &quot;chromosome&quot; is a rather loosely defined term. In prokaryotes and [[viruses]], the term [[genophore]] is more appropriate when no chromatin is present. However, a large body of work uses the term chromosome regardless of chromatin content. In prokaryotes, DNA is usually arranged as a circle, which is tightly coiled in on itself, sometimes accompanied by one or more smaller, circular DNA molecules called [[plasmids]]. These small circular genomes are also found in mitochondria and chloroplasts, reflecting their bacterial origins. The simplest genophores are found in viruses: these DNA or [[RNA]] molecules are short linear or circular genophores that often lack structural proteins.

The word ''chromosome'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{polytonic|χρῶμα}} (''chroma'', colour) and {{polytonic|σῶμα}} (''soma'', body) due to their property of being very strongly stained by particular [[dye]]s.

== History ==

In a series of experiments beginning in the mid-1880s, [[Theodor Boveri]] gave the definitive demonstration that chromosomes are the [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]]s of [[heredity]]. His two principles were the ''continuity'' of chromosomes and the ''individuality'' of chromosomes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}{{explain}} It is the second of these principles that was so original.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}   [[Wilhelm Roux]] suggested that each chromosome carries a different [[genetic load]].  Boveri was able to test and confirm this hypothesis. Aided by the rediscovery at the start of the 1900s of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s earlier work, Boveri was able to point out the connection between the rules of inheritance and the behaviour of the chromosomes. Boveri influenced two generations of American cytologists: [[Edmund Beecher Wilson]], [[Walter Sutton]] and [[Theophilus Painter]] were all influenced by Boveri (Wilson and Painter actually worked with him).

In his famous textbook ''The Cell in Development and Heredity'', Wilson linked together the independent work of Boveri and Sutton (both around 1902) by naming the chromosome theory of inheritance the &quot;[[Boveri-Sutton Chromosome Theory|Sutton-Boveri Theory]]&quot; (the names are sometimes reversed).&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.B. (1925). ''The Cell in Development and Heredity'', Ed. 3. Macmillan, New York. p. 923.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Mayr]] remarks that the theory was hotly contested by some famous geneticists: [[William Bateson]], [[Wilhelm Johannsen]], [[Richard Goldschmidt]] and [[T.H. Morgan]], all of a rather dogmatic turn-of-mind. Eventually, complete proof came from chromosome maps in Morgan's own lab.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, E. (1982). ''The growth of biological thought''. Harvard. p. 749.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In eukaryotes ==
{{See also|Eukaryotic chromosome fine structure}}
[[Eukaryotes]] ([[cell (biology)|cells]] with nuclei such as those found in plants, yeast, and animals) possess multiple large linear chromosomes contained in the cell's nucleus. Each chromosome has one [[centromere]], with one or two arms projecting from the centromere, although, under most circumstances, these arms are not visible as such. In addition, most eukaryotes have a small circular [[mitochondria]]l [[Mitochondrial DNA|genome]], and some eukaryotes may have additional small circular or linear [[cytoplasm]]ic chromosomes.

In the nuclear chromosomes of [[eukaryote]]s, the uncondensed DNA exists in a semi-ordered structure, where it is wrapped around [[histone]]s (structural [[protein]]s), forming a composite material called [[chromatin]].

=== Chromatin ===
{{Main|Chromatin}}
Chromatin is the complex of DNA and protein found in the [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] nucleus, which packages chromosomes. The structure of chromatin varies significantly between different stages of the [[cell cycle]], according to the requirements of the DNA.

==== Interphase chromatin ====
During [[interphase]] (the period of the [[cell cycle]] where the cell is not dividing), two types of [[chromatin]] can be distinguished:
* [[Euchromatin]], which consists of DNA that is active, e.g., being expressed as protein.
* [[Heterochromatin]], which consists of mostly inactive DNA. It seems to serve structural purposes during the chromosomal stages. Heterochromatin can be further distinguished into two types:
** ''Constitutive heterochromatin'', which is never expressed. It is located around the centromere and usually contains [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive sequences]].
** ''Facultative heterochromatin'', which is sometimes expressed.

Individual chromosomes cannot be distinguished at this stage&amp;nbsp;– they appear in the nucleus as a homogeneous tangled mix of DNA and protein.

==== Metaphase chromatin and division ====
{{see also|mitosis|meiosis}}
&lt;!-- too many pictures! [[Image:ChickenChromosomesBMC Genomics5-56Fig4.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Chicken chromosomes during [[metaphase]], with highlighted [[locus (genetics)|genetic loci]]]] --&gt;
[[File:HumanChromosomesChromomycinA3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Human chromosomes during [[metaphase]].]]
In the early stages of mitosis or meiosis (cell division), the chromatin strands become more and more condensed. They cease to function as accessible genetic material ([[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] stops) and become a compact transportable form. This compact form makes the individual chromosomes visible, and they form the classic four arm structure, a pair of sister [[chromatids]] attached to each other at the [[centromere]]. The shorter arms are called ''p arms'' (from the [[French language|French]] ''petit'', small) and the longer arms are called ''q arms'' (''q'' follows ''p'' in the Latin alphabet). This is the only natural context in which individual chromosomes are visible with an optical [[microscope]].

During divisions, long [[microtubule]]s attach to the centromere and the two opposite ends of the cell. The microtubules then pull the chromatids apart, so that each daughter cell inherits one set of chromatids. Once the cells have divided, the chromatids are uncoiled and can function again as chromatin. In spite of their appearance, chromosomes are structurally highly condensed, which enables these giant DNA structures to be contained within a cell nucleus (Fig. 2).

The self-assembled microtubules form the spindle, which attaches to chromosomes at specialized structures called [[kinetochores]], one of which is present on each sister [[chromatid]]. A special DNA base sequence in the region of the kinetochores provides, along with special proteins, longer-lasting attachment in this region.


=== In humans ===

Chromosomes can be divided into two types—autosomes, and sex chromosomes. Certain genetic traits are linked to your sex, and are passed on through the sex chromosomes. The autosomes contain the rest of the genetic hereditary information. All act in the same way during cell division. Human cells have 23 pairs of large linear nuclear chromosomes, (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes) giving a total of 46 per cell. In addition to these, human cells have many hundreds of copies of the [[mitochondrial genome]]. [[DNA sequencing|Sequencing]] of the human genome has provided a great deal of information about each of the chromosomes. Below is a table compiling statistics for the chromosomes, based on the [[Sanger Institute]]'s human genome information in the [[Vertebrate and Genome Annotation Project|Vertebrate Genome Annotation (VEGA) database]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Homo_sapiens/index.html Vega.sanger.ad.uk], all data in this table was derived from this database, November 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Number of genes is an estimate as it is in part based on [[gene prediction]]s. Total chromosome length is an estimate as well, based on the estimated size of unsequenced [[heterochromatin]] regions.

== In prokaryotes ==
The prokaryotes&amp;nbsp;– [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]&amp;nbsp;– typically have a single [[Circular bacterial chromosome|circular chromosome]], but many variations do exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thanbichler M, Shapiro L |title=Chromosome organization and segregation in bacteria |journal=J. Struct. Biol. |volume=156 |issue=2 |pages=292–303 |year=2006 |pmid=16860572 |doi=10.1016/j.jsb.2006.05.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most bacteria have a single circular chromosome that can range in size from only 160,000 [[base pair]]s in the [[endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] bacterium ''[[Candidatus Carsonella ruddii]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nakabachi A, Yamashita A, Toh H, Ishikawa H, Dunbar H, Moran N, Hattori M |title=The 160-kilobase genome of the bacterial endosymbiont Carsonella |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5797 |pages=267 |year=2006 |pmid=17038615 |doi=10.1126/science.1134196}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 12,200,000 base pairs in the soil-dwelling bacterium ''[[Sorangium cellulosum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pradella S, Hans A, Spröer C, Reichenbach H, Gerth K, Beyer S |title=Characterisation, genome size and genetic manipulation of the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum So ce56 |journal=Arch Microbiol |volume=178 |issue=6 |pages=484–92 |year=2002 |pmid=12420170 | doi = 10.1007/s00203-002-0479-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spirochaete]]s of the [[genus]] ''Borrelia'' are a notable exception to this arrangement, with bacteria such as ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'', the cause of [[Lyme disease]], containing a single linear chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hinnebusch J, Tilly K |title=Linear plasmids and chromosomes in bacteria |journal=Mol Microbiol |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=917–22 |year=1993|pmid = 7934868 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.1993.tb00963.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structure in sequences ===
Prokaryotic chromosomes have less sequence-based structure than eukaryotes. Bacteria typically have a single point (the [[origin of replication]]) from which replication starts, whereas some archaea contain multiple replication origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kelman LM, Kelman Z |title=Multiple origins of replication in archaea |journal=Trends Microbiol. |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=399–401 |year=2004 |pmid=15337158 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2004.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genes in prokaryotes are often organized in [[operons]], and do not usually contain [[intron]]s, unlike eukaryotes.

=== DNA packaging ===
[[Prokaryote]]s do not possess nuclei. Instead, their DNA is organized into a structure called the [[nucleoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thanbichler M, Wang SC, Shapiro L |title=The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure |journal=J. Cell. Biochem. |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=506–21 |year=2005 |pmid=15988757 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20519}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nucleoid is a distinct structure and occupies a defined region of the bacterial cell. This structure is, however, dynamic and is maintained and remodeled by the actions of a range of histone-like proteins, which associate with the bacterial chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sandman K, Pereira SL, Reeve JN |title=Diversity of prokaryotic chromosomal proteins and the origin of the nucleosome |journal=Cell. Mol.

Bacterial chromosomes tend to be tethered to the [[plasma membrane]] of the bacteria. In molecular biology application, this allows for its isolation from plasmid DNA by centrifugation of lysed bacteria and pelleting of the membranes (and the attached DNA).

Prokaryotic chromosomes and plasmids are, like eukaryotic DNA, generally [[Mechanical properties of DNA#Supercoiled DNA|supercoiled]]. The DNA must first be released into its relaxed state for access for [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]], regulation, and [[DNA replication|replication]].

== Number of chromosomes in various organisms ==
{{main|List of number of chromosomes of various organisms}}

=== Eukaryotes ===
These tables give the total number of chromosomes (including sex chromosomes) in a cell nucleus. For example, human cells are [[diploid]] and have 22 different types of [[autosome]], each present as two copies, and two [[sex chromosomes]]. This gives 46 chromosomes in total. Other organisms have more than two copies of their chromosomes, such as [[Common wheat|bread wheat]], which is ''hexaploid'' and has six copies of seven different chromosomes&amp;nbsp;– 42 chromosomes in total.

Normal members of a particular eukaryotic [[species]] all have the same number of nuclear chromosomes (see the table). Other eukaryotic chromosomes, i.e., mitochondrial and plasmid-like small chromosomes, are much more variable in number, and there may be thousands of copies per cell.

[[File:PLoSBiol3.5.Fig1bNucleus46Chromosomes.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The 23 human chromosome territories during [[prometaphase]] in [[fibroblast]] cells.]]

[[Asexual reproduction|Asexually reproducing]] species have one set of chromosomes, which are the same in all body cells. However, asexual species can be either haploid or diploid.

[[sexual reproduction|Sexually reproducing]] species have [[somatic cell]]s (body cells), which are [[ploidy#Diploid|diploid]] [2n] having two sets of chromosomes, one from the mother and one from the father. [[Gamete]]s, reproductive cells, are [[ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]] [n]: They have one set of chromosomes. Gametes are produced by [[meiosis]] of a diploid [[germ line]] cell. During meiosis, the matching chromosomes of father and mother can exchange small parts of themselves ([[Chromosomal crossover|crossover]]), and thus create new chromosomes that are not inherited solely from either parent. When a male and a female gamete merge ([[fertilization]]), a new diploid organism is formed.

Some animal and plant species are [[polyploid]] [Xn]: They have more than two sets of [[homologous chromosome]]s. Plants important in agriculture such as [[tobacco]] or [[wheat]] are often polyploid, compared to their ancestral species. Wheat has a haploid number of seven chromosomes, still seen in some [[cultivar]]s as well as the wild progenitors. The more-common [[pasta]] and [[bread]] wheats are polyploid, having 28 (tetraploid) and 42 (hexaploid) chromosomes, compared to the 14 (diploid) chromosomes in the wild wheat.&lt;ref&gt;Sakamura, T. (1918), ''Kurze Mitteilung uber die Chromosomenzahlen und die Verwandtschaftsverhaltnisse der Triticum-Arten''. Bot. Mag., 32: 151-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prokaryotes ===
[[Prokaryote]] [[species]] generally have one copy of each major chromosome, but most cells can easily survive with multiple copies.&lt;ref&gt;Charlebois R.L. (ed) 1999. ''Organization of the prokaryote genome''. ASM Press, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[Buchnera (proteobacteria)|Buchnera]]'', a [[symbiosis|symbiont]] of [[aphid]]s has multiple copies of its chromosome, ranging from 10–400 copies per cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Komaki K, Ishikawa H |title=Genomic copy number of intracellular bacterial symbionts of aphids varies in response to developmental stage and morph of their host |journal=Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=253–8 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10732993 |doi=10.1016/S0965-1748(99)00125-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some large bacteria, such as ''[[Epulopiscium fishelsoni]]'' up to 100,000 copies of the chromosome can be present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mendell JE, Clements KD, Choat JH, Angert ER |title=Extreme polyploidy in a large bacterium |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=105 |issue=18 |pages=6730–4 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18445653 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0707522105 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18445653 |pmc=2373351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasmids and plasmid-like small chromosomes are, as in eukaryotes, very variable in copy number. The number of plasmids in the cell is almost entirely determined by the rate of division of the plasmid&amp;nbsp;– fast division causes high copy number, and vice versa.

== Karyotype ==
{{main|Karyotype}}
[[File:NHGRI human male karyotype.png|thumb|right|200px|'''Figure 3''': Karyogram of a human male]]
In general, the '''karyotype''' is the characteristic chromosome complement of a [[eukaryote]] [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=White, M. J. D. |title=The chromosomes |publisher=Chapman and Hall, distributed by Halsted Press, New York |location=London |year=1973 |pages=28 |isbn=0-412-11930-7 |edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of [[cytogenetics]].

Although the [[DNA replication|replication]] and [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[DNA]] is highly standardized in [[eukaryotes]], ''the same cannot be said for their karyotypes'', which are often highly variable. There may be variation between species in chromosome number and in detailed organization.
In some cases, there is significant variation within species. Often there is:
:1. variation between the two sexes
:2. variation between the [[germ-line]] and [[soma]] (between [[gametes]] and the rest of the body)
:3. variation between members of a population, due to [[polymorphism (biology)|balanced genetic polymorphism]]
:4. [[allopatric speciation|geographical variation]] between [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]]
:5. [[mosaic (genetics)|mosaics]] or otherwise abnormal individuals.
Also, variation in karyotype may occur during development from the fertilised egg.

The technique of determining the karyotype is usually called ''karyotyping''. Cells can be locked part-way through division (in metaphase) [[in vitro]] (in a reaction vial) with [[colchicine]]. These cells are then stained, photographed, and arranged into a ''karyogram'', with the set of chromosomes arranged, autosomes in order of length, and sex chromosomes (here X/Y) at the end: Fig. 3.

Like many sexually reproducing species, humans have special [[XY sex-determination system|gonosomes]] (sex chromosomes, in contrast to [[autosome]]s). These are XX in females and XY in males. &lt;!--- Irrelevant in this section:&quot;In females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactive and can be seen under a microscope as [[Barr body|Barr bodies]].&quot;---&gt;

=== Historical note ===
Investigation into the human karyotype took many years to settle the most basic question. How many chromosomes does a normal [[diploid]] human cell contain? In 1912, [[Hans von Winiwarter]] reported 47 chromosomes in [[spermatogonia]] and 48 in [[oogonia]], concluding an [[XO sex-determination system|XX/XO]] [[Sex-determination system|sex determination mechanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=von Winiwarter H |title=Études sur la spermatogenese humaine |journal=Arch. Biologie |volume=27 |issue=93 |pages=147–9 |year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theophilus Painter|Painter]] in 1922 was not certain whether the diploid number of man is 46 or 48, at first favouring 46.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Painter TS |title=The spermatogenesis of man |journal=Anat. Res. |volume=23 |issue= |pages=129 |year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; He revised his opinion later from 46 to 48, and he correctly insisted on humans having an [[XY sex-determination system|XX/XY]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Painter TS |title=Studies in mammalian spermatogenesis II. The spermatogenesis of man |journal=J. Exp. Zoology |volume=37 |issue= |pages=291–336 |year=1923 |doi=10.1002/jez.1400370303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New techniques were needed to definitively solve the problem:
:1. Using cells in culture
:2. Pretreating cells in a [[Tonicity#Hypotonicity|hypotonic solution]], which swells them and spreads the chromosomes
:3. Arresting [[mitosis]] in [[metaphase]] by a solution of [[colchicine]]
:4. Squashing the preparation on the slide forcing the chromosomes into a single plane
:5. Cutting up a photomicrograph and arranging the result into an indisputable karyogram.

It took until the mid-1950s for it to become generally accepted that the human karyotype include only 46 chromosomes. Considering the techniques of Winiwarter and Painter, their results were quite remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1601-5223.1956.tb03010.x |author=Tjio JH, Levan A |title=The chromosome number of man |journal=Hereditas |volume=42 |issue= |pages=1–6 |year=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hsu T.C. ''Human and mammalian cytogenetics: a historical perspective''. Springer-Verlag, N.Y. p10: &quot;It's amazing that he [Painter] even came close!&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Chimpanzees (the closest living relatives to modern humans) have 48 chromosomes.

Chromosomal aberrations are disruptions in the normal chromosomal content of a cell and are a major cause of genetic conditions in humans, such as [[Down syndrome]]. Some chromosome abnormalities do not cause disease in carriers, such as [[translocations]], or [[chromosomal inversions]], although they may lead to a higher chance of birthing a child with a chromosome disorder. Abnormal numbers of chromosomes or chromosome sets, [[aneuploidy]], may be lethal or give rise to genetic disorders. [[Genetic counseling]] is offered for families that may carry a chromosome rearrangement.

The gain or loss of DNA from chromosomes can lead to a variety of [[genetic disorders]]. Human examples include:
* [[Cri du chat]], which is caused by the [[Genetic deletion|deletion]] of part of the short arm of chromosome 5. &quot;Cri du chat&quot; means &quot;cry of the cat&quot; in French, and the condition was so-named because affected babies make high-pitched cries that sound like those of a cat. Affected individuals have wide-set eyes, a small head and jaw, moderate to severe mental health issues, and are very short.
* [[Down syndrome]], usually is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 ([[trisomy 21]]). Characteristics include decreased muscle tone, stockier build, asymmetrical skull, slanting eyes and mild to moderate developmental disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Kenneth R.|title=Biology|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|year=2000|edition=5th |pages=194–5|chapter=9-3|isbn=0-13-436265-9|accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Edwards syndrome]], which is the second-most-common trisomy; Down syndrome is the most common. It is a trisomy of chromosome 18. Symptoms include motor retardation, developmental disability and numerous congenital anomalies causing serious health problems. Ninety percent die in infancy; however, those that live past their first birthday usually are quite healthy thereafter. They have a characteristic clenched hands and overlapping fingers.
* [[Idic15]], abbreviation for Isodicentric 15 on chromosome 15; also called the following names due to various researches, but they all mean the same; IDIC(15), Inverted duplication 15, extra Marker, Inv dup 15, partial tetrasomy 15
* [[Jacobsen syndrome]], also called the terminal 11q deletion disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.11q.org European Chromosome 11 Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very rare disorder. Those affected have normal intelligence or mild developmental disability, with poor expressive language skills. Most have a bleeding disorder called [[Paris-Trousseau syndrome]].
* [[Klinefelter's syndrome]] (XXY). Men with Klinefelter syndrome are usually sterile, and tend to have longer arms and legs and to be taller than their peers. Boys with the syndrome are often shy and quiet, and have a higher incidence of [[speech delay]] and [[dyslexia]]. During puberty, without testosterone treatment, some of them may develop [[gynecomastia]].
* [[Patau Syndrome]], also called D-Syndrome or trisomy-13. Symptoms are somewhat similar to those of trisomy-18, but they do not have the characteristic hand shape.
* [[Small supernumerary marker chromosome]]. This means there is an extra, abnormal chromosome. Features depend on the origin of the extra genetic material. [[Cat-eye syndrome]] and [[Isodicentric 15|isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome]] (or Idic15) are both caused by a supernumerary marker chromosome, as is [[Pallister-Killian syndrome]].
* [[Triple-X syndrome]] (XXX). XXX girls tend to be tall and thin. They have a higher incidence of dyslexia.
* [[Turner syndrome]] (X instead of XX or XY). In Turner syndrome, female sexual characteristics are present but underdeveloped. People with Turner syndrome often have a short stature, low hairline, abnormal eye features and bone development and a &quot;caved-in&quot; appearance to the chest.
* [[XYY syndrome]]. XYY boys are usually taller than their siblings. Like XXY boys and XXX girls, they are somewhat more likely to have learning difficulties.
* [[Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome]], which is caused by partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4. It is characterized by severe growth retardation and severe to profound mental health issues.

Chromosomal mutations produce changes in whole chromosomes (more than one gene) or in the number of chromosomes present.
* Deletion&amp;nbsp;– loss of part of a chromosome
* Duplication&amp;nbsp;– extra copies of a part of a chromosome
* Inversion&amp;nbsp;– reverse the direction of a part of a chromosome
* Translocation&amp;nbsp;– part of a chromosome breaks off and attaches to another chromosome
Most mutations are neutral&amp;nbsp;– have little or no effect. Chromosomal aberrations are the changes in the structure of chromosomes. It has a great role in evolution.

[[Image:CoA fam ITA colonna.png|right|thumb|Arms of the Colonna family.]]

The '''Colonna family''' was a powerful [[Italian nobility|Italian noble]] family in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] [[Rome]], supplying one [[Pope]] and many other [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] and political leaders. Their family is notable for their bitter feud with the [[Orsini family]] over influence in Rome until it was stopped by [[Papal Bull]] in 1511; in 1571 the Chiefs of both families married nieces of [[Pope Sixtus V]].

==Family history==
====Early history====

According to tradition, the Colonna are a branch of the [[Counts of Tusculum]] — by Peter (1099–1151) son of [[Gregory III, Count of Tusculum|Gregory III]], called Peter &quot;de Columna&quot; from his property, the Columna Castle, in Colonna, Alban Hills.

The first [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] from the family was appointed in 1206 when [[Giovanni Colonna di Carbognano]] was made [[Cardinal Deacon]] of SS. Cosma e Damiano.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Maleczek, ''Papst und Kardinalskolleg von 1191 bis 1216'', Vienna 1984, p. 154-155&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, cardinal [[Giovanni di San Paolo]] (elevated in 1193) was identified as member of the Colonna family and therefore its first representative in the [[College of Cardinals]], but modern scholars have established that this was based on the false information from the beginning of 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Helene Tillmann, &quot;Ricerche sull'origine dei membri del collegio cardenalizio nel XII secolo. II/2. Identificazione dei cardinali del secolo XII di provenienza Romana&quot;, Rivista di Storia della Chiesa in Italia, 1975, p. 401-402&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time a rivalry began with the pro-papal Orsini family, leaders of the Guelph faction. This reinforced the pro-Emperor Ghibelline course that the Colonna family followed throughout the period of conflict between the Papacy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. 

In 1297, Cardinal Jacopo ([[Giacomo Colonna]]) disinherited his brothers Ottone, Matteo, and Landolfo of their lands. The latter three appealed to [[Pope Boniface VIII]] who ordered Jacopo to return the land, and furthermore hand over the family's strongholds of Colonna, [[Palestrina]], and other towns to the [[Papacy]]. Jacopo refused; in May, Boniface removed him from the [[College of Cardinals]] and excommunicated him and his followers for four generations. 

The Colonna family (aside from the three brothers allied with the Pope) declared that Boniface had been elected illegally following the unprecedented [[papal abdication|abdication]] of [[Pope Celestine V]] three years previously. The dispute lead to open warfare, and in September Boniface appointed Landolfo to the command of his army, to put down the revolt of Landolfo's own Colonna relatives. This he did, and by the end of 1298 [[Colonna]], [[Palestrina]], and other towns had been captured and razed to the ground. The family's lands were distributed among Landolfo and his loyal brothers; the rest of the family fled Italy.

Family enmity with Pope Boniface VIII led to destruction of the fortress at Palestrina and to the seizure of the Pope at [[Anagni]] by [[Sciarra Colonna]] in 1303. Sciarra, apparently, smacked the Pope publicily in his face.  It was he who, in old age, crowned [[Louis IV of Bavaria]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1328. In honor of this event, the Colonna family was granted the privilege of using the imperial pointed crown on top of their coat of arms.

The family remained at the centre of civic and religious life throughout the late Middle Ages. In 1248, after having dedicated her entire life to serving God and the poor, Margherita Colonna died. A member of the Franciscan Order, she was beatified by Pope [[Pius IX]] in 1848.

====From the 14th century====

In the 14th century, the family sponsored the decoration of the Church of [[San Giovanni]], most notably the floor mosaics.  In 1314, Cardinal [[Egidio Colonna]] died at [[Avignon]], now in [[France]], where the Popes had withdrawn. An Augustinian, he had studied theology in Paris under St. [[Thomas of Aquinas]] to become one of the most authoritative thinkers of his time, and tutor to French king [[Philip IV the Fair]], (1268 - 29 November 1314).  The celebrated poet [[Petrarch]], was a great friend of the family, often living in Rome as a guest of the family. He composed a number of sonnets for special occasions within the Colonna family, including &quot;Colonna the Glorious, the great Latin name upon which all our hopes rest&quot;.

[[Vittoria Colonna]] became famous in the sixteenth century as a poet and a figure in literate circles. 

In 1627 [[Anna Colonna]], daughter of [[Filippo I Colonna|Don Filippo Colonna]], married [[Taddeo Barberini]] of the [[Barberini]]; nephew of [[Pope Urban VIII]]. 

In 1728, the Carbognano branch (Colonna di Sciarra) of the Colonna family added the name [[Barberini]] to its family name &lt;ref&gt;[http://worldroots.com/foundation/families/taddeobarberinidesc.htm Worldroots - Barberini]&lt;/ref&gt; when Giulio Cesare Colonna di Sciarra married Cornelia Barberini, daughter of the last male Barberini to hold the name and grand-daughter of [[Don Maffeo Barberini|Maffeo Barberini]] (son of [[Taddeo Barberini]]).

====Later history====

The Colonna family have been [[Prince Assistants to the Papal Throne]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chivalricorders.org/vatican/pplcourt.htm Article by Guy de Stair Sainty on Papal Court]&lt;/ref&gt; since 1710, though their papal princely title only dates from 1854. 

The family residence in Rome, the [[Palazzo Colonna]], is open to the public every Saturday morning.

The main 'Colonna di Paliano' family is represented today by Prince Marcantonio Colonna di Paliano, Prince and Duke of Paliano (b. 1948), whose heir is Don Giovanni Andrea Colonna di Paliano (b. 1975), and by Don Prospero Colonna di Paliano, Prince of Avella (b. 1956), whose heir is Don Filippo Colonna di Paliano (b. 1995).  

The 'Colonna di Stigliano' line is represented by Don Prospero Colonna di Stigliano, Prince of Stigliano (b. 1938), whose heir is his nephew Don Stefano Colonna di Stigliano (b. 1975).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/realm/gotha/gotha/colonna.html Theroff's Gotha, with references to current, legitimate members of the princely family&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ceuta''' ({{IPA-es|ˈθeu̯ta}}, {{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;سبتة&lt;/big&gt;}}) is a {{convert|18.5|km2}} [[autonomous cities of Spain|autonomous city of Spain]] and an [[exclave]] located on the north coast of North Africa surrounded by [[Morocco]].  Separated from the [[Iberian peninsula]] by the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], Ceuta lies on the border of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Ceuta along with the other Spanish exclave [[Melilla]] are the only Spanish territories located in mainland [[Africa]].  It was regarded as a part of [[Cadiz (province)|Cadiz province]] prior to 14 March 1995, when the city's [[Statute of Autonomy]] was passed.

Ceuta (like Melilla) was a [[free port]] before Spain joined the [[European Union]]. As of 2008 it has a population of 75,276. Its population consists of [[Christian]]s, [[Muslim]]s (chiefly [[Berber people|Berber]]), and small minorities of [[Jew]]s and [[Hindu]]s. Both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Riff language|Riff Berber]] are widely spoken. Spanish is the official language, while there have been calls to recognize [[Berber languages|Berber]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lukor.com/not-esp/locales/0412/03150841.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morocco]] claims Ceuta, along with Melilla and a [[Plazas de soberanía|number of Mediterranean islands]] which border it.

==History==
[[File:Moat of Royal Wall At Ceuta 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Moat of the Royal Wall of Ceuta]] 
Ceuta's location has made it an important commercial trade and military way-point for many cultures, beginning with the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] in the 5th century BC, who called the city '''''Abyla'''''. It was not until the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] took control of the region in AD 42 that the port city, then named '''''Septa''''', assumed an almost exclusive military purpose. It changed hands again approximately 400 years later, when [[Vandal]] tribes ousted the Romans. It then fell into the hands of the [[Visigoths]], and finally become an [[Hispania#Byzantine reconquest|outpost]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]].

Around 710, as [[Muslim]] armies approached the city, its Byzantine governor, [[Julian, count of Ceuta|Julian]] (described as ''King of the [[Ghomara]]'') changed his allegiance, and exhorted the Muslims to invade the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Under the leadership of [[Berber people|Berber]] General [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]], the Muslims used Ceuta as a [[staging area|staging ground]] for an assault on [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Iberian Peninsula. After Julian's death, the Arabs took direct control of the city, something that the indigenous Berber tribes resented. They destroyed Ceuta during the [[Kharijite]] rebellion led by Maysara al-Haqir in 740. 

Ceuta lay in ruins until it was resettled in the 9th century by Mâjakas, chief of the Majkasa Berber tribe, who started the short-lived [[Banu Isam]] dynasty. His great-grandson would briefly ally his tribe with the [[Idrisid]]s, but the Banu Isam rule ended in 931 when he abdicated in favor of the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliph of Cordoba]], [[Abd ar-Rahman III]]. Ceuta reverted to [[Hispanic]] [[Andalus]]ian rule in 927, along with [[Melilla]], and later [[Tangier]], in 951.

Chaos ensued with the fall of the Umayyad caliphate in 1031, but eventually Ceuta and the rest of Muslim Spain fell into the hands of successive North African dynasties. Starting in 1084, the [[Almoravid]] [[Berbers]] ruled the region until 1147, when the [[Almohad]]s who conquered the land and ruled, apart from [[Ibn Hud]]'s rebellion of 1232, until the [[Tunisia]]n [[Hafsid]]s established their control. The Hafsids' influence in the west rapidly waned, and Ceuta's inhabitants eventually expelled them in 1249. After this, a period of political instability persisted, under competing interests from the [[Kingdom of Fez]] and the [[Kingdom of Granada]]. The [[Kingdom of Fez]] finally conquered the region in 1387, with assistance from the [[Crown of Aragon]].

In 1415, during the [[Battle of Ceuta]], the city was captured by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] during the reign of [[John I of Portugal]]. The King of Spain, [[Phillip II of Spain|Phillip II]], [[Struggle for the throne of Portugal|seized the Portuguese throne]] in 1580 and held it for 60 years ([[Iberian Union]]). During this time Ceuta gained many residents of Spanish origin.&lt;ref name=Griffinh&gt;{{cite book |author= Griffin, H | year=2010 |title=[http://www.miragebooks.co.uk/ceuta Ceuta Mini Guide] | publisher=Mirage | isbn= 978-0-9543335-3-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Ceuta became the only city of the [[Portuguese Empire]] that sided with Spain when Portugal regained its independence in 1640 and [[Portuguese Restoration War|war broke out between the two countries]].

The formal allegiance of Ceuta to Spain was recognized by the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Treaty of Lisbon]] by which, on January 1, 1668, King [[Afonso VI of Portugal]] formally ceded Ceuta to [[Carlos II of Spain]]. However, the originally Portuguese flag and [[coat of arms]] of Ceuta remained unchanged and the modern-day Ceuta flag features the configuration of the [[Flag of Portugal#Portuguese shield|Portuguese shield]]. The flag's background is also the same as that of the flag of [[Lisbon]].

When Spain recognized the independence of [[Spanish Morocco]] in 1956, Ceuta and the other ''[[plazas de soberanía]]'' remained under Spanish rule as they were considered integral parts of the Spanish state - which Morocco strongly disputed. Culturally, modern Ceuta is part of the Spanish region of [[Andalusia]]. Indeed, it was attached to the [[province of Cádiz]] until 1925 — the Spanish coast being only 20&amp;nbsp;km away. It is a cosmopolitan city, with a large ethnic [[Berber people|Berber]] Muslim minority as well as [[Sephardic]] [[Jewish]] and [[Hindu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Resistir/monte/Renegado/elpepuesp/20090322elpepinac_9/Tes |title=Resistir en el monte del Renegado · ELPAÍS.com|publisher=Elpais.com|date=2009-03-22 |accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; minorities.

On November 5, 2007, King [[Juan Carlos I]] visited the city, sparking great enthusiasm from the local population and protests from the Moroccan government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.periodistadigital.com/infordeus.php/2007/11/06/p125486 |title=Ceuta y Melilla son España, dice Juan Carlos I; Sebta y Melilia son nuestras, responde Mohamed VI|publisher=Blogs.periodistadigital.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the first time a Spanish head of state had visited Ceuta in 80 years.

Ceuta (and Melilla) have declared the [[Muslim holiday]] of [[Eid al-Adha]] or Feast of the Sacrifice, as an official [[public holiday]] from 2010 onwards. It is the first time a non-Christian [[religious festival]] is officially celebrated in Spain since the [[Reconquista]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://spainforvisitors.com/module-News-display-sid-310.htm Muslim Holiday in Ceuta and Melilla]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qppstudio.net/bankholidays2010/spain.htm Public Holidays and Bank Holidays for Spain]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecclesiastical history===
The Catholic [[Diocese of Ceuta]] existed from 1417 to 1879. It was  a [[suffragan]] of the [[Patriarchate of Lisbon]] until 1675, with the end of the [[Iberian Union]], when Ceuta chose to remain linked to the [[king of Spain]]. Since then it was a [[suffragan]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seville|archbishopric of Seville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David M. Cheney |url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dc206.html |title='&amp;#39;Catholic Hierarchy'&amp;#39; page |publisher=Catholic-hierarchy.org|date=|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Diocese of Tanger]] was suppressed and incorporated to that of Ceuta in 1570.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14736a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Tingis |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-07-01 |accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851, upon the signature of the [[Concordat of 1851|concordat]] between the [[Holy See]] and [[Spain]], the diocese of Ceuta was agreed to be suppressed, being combined into the [[diocese of Cádiz y Ceuta]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03131b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Cadiz |publisher=Newadvent.org|date=1908-11-01|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (up to then [[diocese of Cádiz y Algeciras]]), whose bishop usually was the [[apostolic administrator]] of Ceuta. The agreement was not implemented until 1879.

==Geography==
Ceuta is dominated by [[Monte Anyera]], a hill along its western frontier with Morocco. The mountain is guarded by a [[Spanish army|Spanish]] fort. 

[[Monte Hacho]] on the [[Peninsula de Almina]] overlooking the port is one of the possible locations for the southern [[Pillars of Hercules]], of Greek legend (the other possibility being [[Jebel Musa (Morocco)|Jebel Musa]]).

[[File:Ceuta (neutral).PNG|thumb|200px|left|Map of Ceuta (Perejil islet is just off the coast, to the left of the image)]]
Ceuta is known officially in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as '''Ciudad Autónoma de Ceuta''' (''{{en|Autonomous City of Ceuta}}''), with a rank between a standard Spanish city and an [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]]. Ceuta is part of the territory of the [[European Union]]. The city was a [[free port]] before Spain joined the European Union in 1986. Now it has a low-tax system within the European Monetary System.  As of 2006, its population was 75,861.

Ceuta is subdivided into 63 ''barriadas'' (''{{en|neighborhoods}}''), such as Barriada de Berizu, Barriada de P. Alfonso, Barriada del Sarchal, and El Hacho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpueblodeceuta.es/200708/20070819/200708195101.html |title=elpueblodeceuta.es |publisher=elpueblodeceuta.es |date=|accessdate=2009-06-17}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planetware.com/i/map/MAR/ceuta-map.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codigo-postal.info/ceuta/ceuta?page=7 |title=Códigos postales de Ceuta en Ceuta |publisher=Codigo-postal.info |date= |accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status===
Since 1995, Ceuta is, along with Melilla, one of the two [[Autonomous community#autonomous cities|autonomous cities]] of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo1-1995.html |title=Ley Orgánica 1/1995, de 13 de marzo, Estatuto de Autonomía de Ceuta|publisher=Noticias.juridicas.com|date=|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The government of [[Morocco]] has repeatedly called for Spain to transfer the sovereignty of Ceuta and [[Melilla]], along with uninhabited islets such as the islands of Alhucemas, Velez and the [[Perejil island]], drawing comparisons with Spain's territorial claim to [[Gibraltar]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} In both cases, the national governments and local populations of the disputed territories reject these claims by a large majority. The Spanish position states that both Ceuta and Melilla are integral parts of the Spanish state, and have been since the 15th century, centuries prior to [[Morocco]]'s independence from France in 1956, whereas Gibraltar, being a [[British Overseas Territory]], is not and never has been part of the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jun/12/worlddispatch.gibraltar |title=A rocky relationship &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2003-06-12|accessdate=2009-06-17 | location=London | first=Giles | last=Tremlett}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morocco denies these claims and maintains that the Spanish presence in Ceuta and the other ''presidios'' on its coast is a remnant of the colonial past which should be ended. However, the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]] do not consider those Spanish territories to be colonies, whereas it does declare Gibraltar as a non-[[Decolonization|decolonized]] territory.

Ceuta and the Spanish Sovereign Territories: Spanish and Moroccan |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the economy of the city depends heavily on its port (now in expansion) and its industrial and retail centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceuta.es/servlet/ContentServer?idioma=es_es&amp;mD=true&amp;pagename=CeutaTur%2FInformacionViajero%2FInformacionViajeroDetalle&amp;cid=1113994915129&amp;mC=true&amp;idP=1111055969345&amp;idA=1113994915129|General |title=Economic Data of Ceunta, de ceutna digital |publisher=Ceuta.es |date= |accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ceuta Heliport]] is now used to connect the city to mainland Spain by air.

Along with Melilla, Ceuta is the main link to and from the ''[[plazas de soberanía]]'', especially the [[Islas Chafarinas]], occupied by Spain during the 19th century.

==Transport==
The city receives high numbers of ferries each day, most from Spain.  Occasionally, cruise ships stop by.  Most all dock within an easy walk of downtown shops and restaurants.

Ceuta is a smaller city than others in Spain. There is a bus service throughout the city which does not pass into neighbouring Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikitravel.org/en/Ceuta#Get_around |title=Ceuta travel guide |publisher=Wikitravel|date=2010-03-06|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceuta has a regular helicopter service from [[Ceuta Heliport]] to mainland Spain. Ferries cross from Algeciras in [[Andalucia]] in the south of Spain.

A '''carcinogen''' is any substance, [[radionuclide]], or [[radiation]] that is an agent directly involved in causing [[cancer]]. This may be due to the ability to damage the [[genome]] or to the disruption of cellular [[metabolic]] processes. Several radioactive substances are considered carcinogens, but their carcinogenic activity is attributed to the radiation, for example [[gamma ray]]s and [[alpha particle]]s, which they emit. Common examples of carcinogens are inhaled [[asbestos]], certain [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], and [[tobacco]] smoke.
[[Cancer]] is a disease in which damaged cells do not undergo [[programmed cell death]]. Carcinogens may increase the risk of cancer by altering cellular metabolism or damaging [[DNA]] directly in [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, which interferes with [[biology|biological]] processes, and induces the uncontrolled, malignant division, ultimately leading to the formation of tumors. Usually DNA damage, if too severe to repair, leads to [[programmed cell death]], but if the programmed cell death pathway is damaged, then the cell cannot prevent itself from becoming a cancer cell.

There are many natural carcinogens. [[Aflatoxin]] B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which is produced by the [[fungus]] ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' growing on stored [[cereal|grain]]s, [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s and [[peanut butter]], is an example of a potent, naturally-occurring [[microbe|microbial]] carcinogen. Certain viruses such as [[Hepatitis B]] and [[human papilloma virus]]es have been found to cause cancer in humans. The first one shown to cause cancer in animals is [[Rous sarcoma virus]], discovered in 1910 by [[Peyton Rous]].

[[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds]], [[benzene]], [[kepone]], [[1,2-Dibromoethane|EDB]], [[asbestos]], and the waste rock of [[oil shale]] mining have all been classified as carcinogenic.&lt;ref name=&quot;roc&quot;/&gt; As far back as the 1930s, [[Industry|industrial]] smoke and [[tobacco]] smoke were identified as sources of dozens of carcinogens, including [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]], tobacco-specific [[nitrosamine]]s such as [[N-Nitrosonornicotine|nitrosonornicotine]], and reactive [[aldehyde]]s such as [[formaldehyde]]&amp;mdash;which is also a hazard in [[embalming]] and making [[plastic]]s. [[Vinyl chloride]], from which [[PVC]] is manufactured, is a carcinogen and thus a hazard in PVC production.

[[Co-carcinogen]]s are chemicals that do not necessarily cause cancer on their own, but promote the activity of other carcinogens in causing cancer.

After the carcinogen enters the body, the body makes an attempt to eliminate it through a process called [[biotransformation]]. The purpose of these reactions is to make the carcinogen more [[water-soluble]] so that it can be removed from the body. But these reactions can also convert a less toxic carcinogen into a more toxic carcinogen.

DNA is nucleophilic, therefore soluble carbon electrophiles are carcinogenic, because DNA [[nucleophilic attack|attacks]] them. For example, some [[alkene]]s are [[Toxication|toxicated]] by human enzymes to produce an [[Electrophile|electrophilic]] epoxide. DNA attacks the epoxide, and is bound permanently to it. This is the mechanism behind the carcinogenity of [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]] in tobacco smoke, other aromatics, aflatoxin and mustard gas.

==Radiation==

[[CERCLA]] identifies all [[radionuclide]]s as carcinogens, although the nature of the emitted [[Radioactive decay|radiation]] ([[alpha particle|alpha]], [[beta particle|beta]], [[gamma ray|gamma]], or [[Neutron radiation|neutron]] and the radioactive strength), its consequent capacity to cause [[ionization]] in tissues, and the magnitude of radiation exposure, determine the potential hazard. Carcinogenicity of radiation depends of the type of radiation, type of exposure, and penetration. For example, [[alpha particle|alpha radiation]] has low penetration and is not a hazard outside the body, but emitters are carcinogenic when inhaled or ingested.

For example, [[Thorotrast]], a (incidentally-radioactive) [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] previously used as a [[Radiocontrast|contrast]] medium in [[x-ray]] diagnostics, is a potent human carcinogen known because of its retention within various [[organ (biology)|organ]]s and persistent emission of alpha particles. [[Marie Curie]], one of the pioneers of radioactivity, died of cancer caused by radiation exposure during her experiments.

Not all types of electromagnetic radiation are in fact carcinogenic. Low-energy waves on the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] are generally not, including [[radio waves]], [[microwave radiation]], [[infrared radiation]] and [[visible light]]. Higher-energy radiation, including [[ultraviolet radiation]] (present in [[sunlight]]), x-rays, and [[gamma radiation]], generally ''is'' carcinogenic, if received in sufficient doses.

Low level ionizing radiation may induce irreparable DNA damage (leading to replicational and transcriptional errors needed for neoplasia or may trigger viral interactions) leading to pre-mature aging and [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;Acharya, PVN; The Effect of Ionizing Radiation on the Formation of Age-Correlated Oligo Deoxyribo Nucleo Phospheryl Peptides in Mammalian Cells; 10th International Congress of Gerontology, Jerusalem. Abstract No. 1; January 1975. Work done while employed by Dept. of Pathology, University of Wisconsin, Madison.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acharya, PVN; Implicatons of The Action of Low Level Ionizing Radiation on the Inducement of Irreparable DNA Damage Leading to Mammalian Aging and Chemical Carcinogenesis.; 10th International Congress of Biochemistry, Hamburg, Germany. Abstract No. 01-1-079; July 1976.

April 1977. Work conducted at Industrial Safety Institute and Behavioral Cybernetics Laboratory, University of Wisconsin, Madison.&lt;/ref&gt;

Substances or [[Food irradiation|foods]] irradiated with electrons or electromagnetic radiation (such as microwave, X-ray or gamma) are not carcinogenic.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In contrast, non-electromagnetic [[neutron radiation]] produced inside nuclear reactors can produce secondary radiation through [[nuclear transmutation]].

==Carcinogens in prepared food==
{{See also|Cooking#Potential harmful health effects|Raw foodism}}
Cooking food at high temperatures, for example [[grilling]] or [[barbecuing]] meats, can lead to the formation of minute quantities of many potent carcinogens that are comparable to those found in cigarette smoke (i.e., [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wei Zheng, Deborah R Gustafson, Rashmi Sinha, James R Cerhan, ''et al.'' &quot;Well-done meat intake and the risk of breast cancer.&quot; ''Journal of the National Cancer Institute''. Oxford: Nov 18, 1998.Vol. 90, Iss. 22; pg. 1724, 6 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt; Charring of food resembles [[coking]] and tobacco [[pyrolysis]], and produces similar carcinogens. There are several carcinogenic pyrolysis products, such as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, which are converted by human [[enzyme]]s into [[epoxide]]s, which attach permanently to DNA. Pre-cooking meats in a [[microwave oven]] for 2–3 minutes before grilling shortens the time on the hot pan, and removes heterocyclic amine (HCA) precursors, which can help minimize the formation of these carcinogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/heterocyclic-amines |title=National Cancer Institute, 2004 analysis and recommendations |publisher=Cancer.gov |date=2004-09-15 |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports from the [[Food Standards Agency]] have found that the known animal carcinogen [[acrylamide]] is generated in fried or overheated [[carbohydrate]] foods (such as [[french fries]] and [[potato chips]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Acrylamide |url= http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/acrylamide_branch/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies are underway at the [[US Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] and [[Europe]]an regulatory agencies to assess its potential risk to humans.

==Carcinogens in cigarettes==
{{Main|Tobacco and health}}
[[Tobacco smoke]] contains over 4000 chemical compounds, many of which are carcinogenic or otherwise toxic. One of these is a compound marketed as a rat poison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quitsmoking.about.com/cs/nicotineinhaler/g/carbonmonoxide.htm |title=Definition of Carbon Monoxide - Carbon Monoxide in Cigarette Smoke |publisher=Quitsmoking.about.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circadian disruption==
&quot;Shiftwork that involves circadian disruption&quot; was listed, in 2007, as a probable carcinogen by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer. (IARC Press release No. 180).&lt;ref name=&quot;IARC180&quot;&gt;{{Cite

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Circadian disruption by exposure to light at night suppresses the production of the hormone [[melatonin]] which leads to reduction in cellular immune defense and surveillance necessary for protection from development of cancers. Melatonin also seems to have a direct protective effect against cancer, possibly in part because of its strong [[antioxidant]] properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;psy.ohio-state.edu&quot;&gt;Navara KJ, Nelson RJ (2007) [http://www.psy.ohio-state.edu/nelson/documents/JPinealRes2007.pdf The dark side of light light at night: physiological, epidemiological, and ecological consequences].

==Mechanisms of carcinogenicity==
Carcinogens can be classified as genotoxic or nongenotoxic. [[Genotoxin]]s cause irreversible genetic damage or mutations by binding to [[DNA]]. Genotoxins include chemical agents like [[N-nitroso-N-methylurea]] (NMU) or non-chemical agents such as [[ultraviolet light]] and [[ionizing radiation]]. Certain viruses can also act as carcinogens by interacting with DNA.

Nongenotoxins do not directly affect DNA but act in other ways to promote growth. These include hormones and some organic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=The Gale Encyclopedia of Cancer: A guide to Cancer and its Treatments, Second Edition.

=== International Agency for Research on Cancer ===
The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) is an intergovernmental agency established in 1965, which forms part of the [[World Health Organization]] of the [[United Nations]]. It is based in [[Lyon]], [[France]]. Since 1971 it has published a series of ''Monographs on the Evaluation                          of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ |title=IARC Monographs |publisher=Monographs.iarc.fr |date= |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; that have been highly influential in the classification of possible carcinogens.
* [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1]]: the agent (mixture) is definitely carcinogenic to humans. The exposure circumstance entails exposures that are carcinogenic to humans.
* [[List of IARC Group 2A carcinogens|Group 2A]]: the agent (mixture) is probably carcinogenic to humans. The exposure circumstance entails exposures that are probably carcinogenic to humans.

=== Globally Harmonized System ===
The [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS) is a [[United Nations]] initiative to attempt to harmonize the different systems of assessing chemical risk which currently exist (as of March 2009) around the world. It classifies carcinogens into two categories, of which the first may be divided again into subcategories if so desired by the competent regulatory authority:
*Category 1: known or presumed to have carcinogenic potential for humans
**Category 1A: the assessment is based primarily on human evidence
**Category 1B: the assessment is based primarily on animal evidence
*Category 2: suspected human carcinogens

=== U.S. National Toxicology Program ===
The National Toxicology Program of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] is mandated to produce a biennial ''Report on Carcinogens''.&lt;ref&gt;Section 301(b)(4) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by Section 262, Pub.&amp;nbsp;L. 95–622.&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2009, the latest edition was the 11th report (2005).&lt;ref name=&quot;roc&quot;&gt;[http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/index.cfm?objectid=32BA9724-F1F6-975E-7FCE50709CB4C932 ''Report on Carcinogens, Eleventh Edition'']; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Toxicology Program (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; It classifies carcinogens into two groups:
*Known to be a human carcinogen
*Reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen

=== American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists ===
The [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] (ACGIH) is a private organization best known for its publication of [[threshold limit value]]s (TLVs) for occupational exposure and monographs on workplace chemical hazards. It assesses carcinogenicity as part of wider assessment of the occupational hazards of chemicals.
*Group A1: Confirmed human carcinogen
*Group A2: Suspected human carcinogen
*Group A3: Confirmed animal carcinogen with unknown relevance to humans
*Group A4: Not classifiable as a human carcinogen
*Group A5: Not suspected as a human carcinogen

=== European Union ===
The European Union classification of carcinogens is contained in the [[Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC)|Dangerous Substances Directive]] and the [[Dangerous Preparations Directive]]. It consists of three categories:
*Category 1: Substances known to be carcinogenic to humans.
*Category 2: Substances which should be regarded as if they are carcinogenic to humans.
*Category 3: Substances which cause concern for humans, owing to possible carcinogenic effects but in respect of which the available information is not adequate for making a satisfactory assessment.
This assessment scheme is being phased out in favor of the GHS scheme (see above), to which it is very close in category definitions.

=== Safe Work Australia ===
Under a previous name, the NOHSC, in 1999 [[Safe Work Australia]] published the Approved Criteria for Classifying Hazardous Substances [NOHSC:1008(1999)].&lt;ref name=&quot;Safe Work Australia3&quot;&gt;[http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/AboutSafeWorkAustralia/WhatWeDo/Publications/Documents/504/Approved_Criteria_classifying_Hazardous_Substances_NOHSC1008_1999_2nd_Edition.pdf Safe Work Australia ], NOHSC. (1999). Approved criteria for classifying hazardous substances [NOHSC:1008(1999)] Section 4.76..http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/AboutSafeWorkAustralia/WhatWeDo/Publications/Documents/504/Approved_Criteria_classifying_Hazardous_Substances_NOHSC1008_1999_2nd_Edition.pdf. Last accessed 21/05/2011
&lt;/ref&gt;  
Section 4.76 of this document outlines the criteria for classifying carcinogens as approved by the Australian government. This classification consists of three categories:
* Category 1: Substances known to be carcinogenic to humans.
* Category 2: Substances that should be regarded as if they were carcinogenic to humans.
* Category 3: Substances that have possible carcinogenic effects in humans but about which there is insufficient information to make an assessment.

==Procarcinogen== &lt;!--Procarcinogen redirects here--&gt;
A procarcinogen is a [[precursor]] to a carcinogen. One example is [[nitrites]] when taken in by the diet. They are not carcinogenic themselves, but turn into [[nitrosamines]] in the body, which are carcinogenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lactospore.com/glossary.htm |title=Web definitions for Procarcinogen |publisher=Lactospore.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Camouflaged-sniper.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A camouflaged [[sniper]], an example of [[military camouflage]]]]

'''Camouflage''' is a method of [[crypsis]] (hiding). It allows an otherwise visible [[organism]] or object to remain unnoticed, by blending with its environment. Examples include a [[tiger]]'s stripes, the [[battledress]] of a modern [[soldier]] and a [[butterfly]] camouflaging itself as a [[leaf]]. The [[theory of camouflage]] covers the various [[strategies]] which are used to achieve this effect.

==In nature==
{{Further|[[Crypsis]]|[[Antipredator adaptation]]}}
Cryptic coloration is the most common form of camouflage, found to some extent in the majority of species. The simplest way is for an animal to be of a color similar to its surroundings. Examples include the &quot;earth tones&quot; of [[deer]], [[squirrel]]s, or [[mole (animal)|moles]] (to match trees or dirt), or the combination of blue skin and white underbelly of [[shark]]s via [[countershading]] (which makes them difficult to detect from both above and below). More complex patterns can be seen in animals such as [[lizard]]s, [[moth]]s, and [[frog]]s, among many others.

The type of camouflage a species will develop depends on several factors:
*The environment in which it lives. This is usually the most important factor.
*The [[physiology]] and [[ethology|behavior]] of an animal. Animals with [[fur]] need camouflage different from those with [[feather]]s or [[scale (zoology)|scales]]. Likewise, animals who live in groups use different camouflage techniques than those that are solitary.
*If the animal is preyed upon then the behavior or characteristics of its predator can influence how the camouflage develops. If the predator has [[Monochromacy|achromatic]] vision, for example, then the animal will not need to match the color of its surroundings.

Animals produce colors in two ways:
*[[Chromatophore|Biochromes]]: natural microscopic [[pigment]]s that absorb certain [[wavelength]]s of light and reflect others, creating a visible color that is targeted towards its primary predator.
*Microscopic physical structures, which act like [[prism (optics)|prism]]s to reflect and scatter light to produce a color that is different from the skin, such as the [[transparency (optics)|translucent]] fur of the [[Polar Bear|polar bear]], which actually has black skin.

[[File:Protective Mimicry Among Insects crop.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Protective [[mimicry]] among [[insect]]s]]
Cryptic coloration can change as well. This can be due to just a changing of the seasons, or it can be in response to more rapid environmental changes. For example, the [[Arctic fox]] has a white coat in winter, and a brown coat in summer. [[Mammal]]s and [[bird]]s require a new fur coat and new set of feathers respectively, but some animals, such as [[cuttlefish]], have deeper-level pigment cells, called [[chromatophore]]s, that they can control. Other animals such as certain [[fish]] species or the [[nudibranch]] can actually change their skin coloration by changing their diet. However, the most well-known creature that changes color, the [[chameleon]], usually does not do so for camouflage purposes, but instead to express its mood.

Beyond colors, skin patterns are often helpful in cryptic coloration as well. The [[Cornsweet illusion]] describes visual perception as occurring through contrasts of outlines. One recognizes a dog, for example, not by its color as much as by its shape. Often what matters most for good cryptic coloration is to break up the outline of a creature's body. This can be seen in common domestic pets such as [[tabby cat]]s, but striping overall in other animals such as [[tiger]]s and [[zebra]]s help them blend into their environment, the jungle and the grasslands respectively. The latter two provide an interesting example, as one's initial impression might be that their coloration does not match their surroundings at all, but tigers' prey are usually color blind to a certain extent such that they cannot tell the difference between orange and green, and zebras' main predators, [[lion]]s, are color blind. In the case of zebras, the stripes also blend together so that a herd of zebras looks like one large mass, making it difficult for a lion to pick out any individual zebra. This same concept is used by many striped fish species as well. Among birds, the white &quot;chinstraps&quot; of [[Canada geese]] make a flock in tall grass appear more like sticks and less like birds' heads.

In nature, there is a strong evolutionary pressure for animals to blend into their environment or conceal their shape; for prey animals to avoid predators and for predators to be able to sneak up on prey. Natural camouflage is one method that animals use to meet these. There are a number of methods of doing so. One is for the animal to blend in with its surroundings, while another is for the animal to disguise itself as something uninteresting or something dangerous.
[[File:Hooded Grasshopper (Teratodus monticollis) W IMG 0525.jpg|thumb|250px|Hooded grasshopper]]
There is a permanent co-evolution of the [[sensory]] abilities of animals for whom it is beneficial to be able to detect the camouflaged animal, and the [[crypsis|cryptic]] characteristics of the concealing species. Different aspects of crypsis and sensory abilities may be more or less pronounced in given predator-prey pairs of species.

Some cryptic animals also simulate natural movement, e.g., of a leaf in the wind. This is called procryptic behaviour or habit. Other animals attach or attract natural materials to their body for concealment. A few animals have chromatic response, changing color in changing environments, either seasonally ([[ermine]], [[snowshoe hare]]) or far more rapidly with [[chromatophore]]s in their integument (the [[cephalopod]] family). Some animals, notably in aquatic environments, also take steps to camouflage the odours they create that may attract predators.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Some herd animals adopt a similar pattern to make it difficult to distinguish a single animal. Examples include stripes on zebras and the reflective scales on fish.

==In military==

{{main|Military camouflage}}

Camouflage was not in wide use in early western civilization based warfare. 18th and 19th century armies tended to use bright colors and bold, impressive designs. These were intended to daunt the enemy, attract recruits, foster [[unit cohesion]], or allow easier identification of units in the [[fog of war]] common to the battlefield before the invention of smokeless gun powder. [[Jäger (military)|Jäger]] riflemen in the 18th century were the first to adopt colors in relatively drab shades of green or grey. Major armies retained their bright colors until convinced otherwise. In [[1857]], the [[British Army|British]] in [[British Raj|India]] were forced by casualties{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} to dye their white hot-weather uniforms to neutral tones, initially a muddy tan called [[khaki (color)|khaki]] (from the [[Urdu]] word for 'dust'). This was only a temporary measure.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} It was not until after the [[Second Boer War]] that, in 1902, the &quot;home service&quot; (i.e. non-tropical) field uniforms of the entire British army were standardised using a darker shade of khaki serge.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Other armies, such as those of the [[United States Army|United States]], [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Russia]], [[Italian Army|Italy]], and [[German Army|Germany]] followed suit either with khaki, grey, blue-grey or other colors more suitable for their environments.

Camouflage netting, natural materials, disruptive color patterns, and paint with special infrared, thermal, and radar qualities have also been used on military vehicles, ships, aircraft, installations and buildings. A striking example of this is the [[dazzle camouflage]] used on ships during WW I. [[Ghillie suit]]s are worn by [[sniper]]s and their spotters to take camouflage to a higher level, combining not just colors, but twigs, leaves and other foliage to break up the human silhouette and to replace the printed patterns of their uniform with colors and materials from their immediate environment so as to remain inconspicuous even while being directly observed through [[binoculars]] or from above by aircraft.

A new development are pixelated patterns of so called [[digital camouflage]], like [[ACUPAT]], [[MARPAT]] and [[CADPAT]].

==Non-military applications==

[[File:Wuzhen Xizha 2009-17.jpg|thumb|[[Radio masts and towers|Communications tower]], camouflaged as a slim tree]]
[[Hunting|Hunters]] often use camouflage clothing that is visually tailored to the game they are hunting. The most striking example of this is the [[blaze orange]] camouflage, which makes the hunter obvious to humans but relies on the fact that most large game animals, such as [[deer]], are [[dichromat]]s, and perceive the orange as a dull color. On the other hand, [[optical brightener|optical brighteners]], commonly used in laundry detergents to make the laundered items appear brighter, are visible to many game animals; using these will cause what appears to the human eye to be cryptically colored clothing to stand out against the background, when viewed by an animal with ultraviolet-sensitive eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atsko.com/articles/hunting/how-game-animals-see-smell.html |title=How Game Animals See and Smell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several different types of hunting camouflage.  The use of each one is dependent upon the area in which the hunter is going to hunt.  It can range in appearance from a mossy oak pattern to a sage brush pattern for hunters of large mammals.  Waterfowl hunters can have camouflage that resembles swamp reeds.

A '''clock''' is an instrument used to indicate, keep, and co-ordinate [[time]]. The word ''clock'' is derived ultimately (via [[Dutch language|Dutch]], Northern French, and [[Medieval Latin]]) from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] words ''clagan'' and ''clocca'' meaning &quot;[[Bell (instrument)|bell]]&quot;. A silent instrument missing such a mechanism has traditionally been known as a '''timepiece'''.&lt;ref&gt;see Baillie et al., p. 307; Palmer, 
p. 19; Zea &amp; Cheney, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; In general usage today a &quot;clock&quot; refers to any device for measuring and displaying the time. [[Watch]]es and other timepieces that can be carried on one's person are often distinguished from clocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=14263&amp;dict=CALD |accessdate=2009-09-16 |quote=a device for measuring and showing time, which is usually found in or on a building and is not worn by a person}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clock is one of the oldest human [[invention]]s, meeting the need to consistently measure intervals of time shorter than the natural units: the [[day]]; the [[lunar month]]; and the [[year]].  Devices operating on several different physical processes have been used over the millennia, culminating in the clocks of today.

==Sundials and other devices==

The [[sundial]], which measures the time of day by using the sun, was widely used in [[Ancient history|ancient times]]. A well-constructed sundial can measure local [[solar time]] with reasonable accuracy, and sundials continued to be used to monitor the performance of clocks until the [[modern era]]. However, its practical limitations—it requires the sun to shine and does not work at all during the night—encouraged the use of other techniques for measuring time.
	
[[Candle clocks]], and sticks of incense that burn down at approximately predictable speeds have also been used to estimate the passing of time. In an [[hourglass]], fine [[sand]] pours through a tiny hole at a constant rate and indicates a predetermined passage of an arbitrary period of time.

==Water clocks==

{{Main|Water clock}}
[[File:SuSongClock1.JPG|thumb|right|A [[scale model]] of [[Su Song]]'s [[Astronomical]] Clock Tower, built in 11th century [[Kaifeng]], [[China]]. It was driven by a large [[waterwheel]], [[chain drive]], and [[escapement]] mechanism.]]
Water clocks, also known as clepsydrae (sg: ''clepsydra''), along with the sundials, are possibly the oldest time-measuring instruments, with the only exceptions being the vertical [[gnomon]] and the day-counting [[tally stick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1984|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given their great antiquity, where and when they first existed are not known and perhaps unknowable. The bowl-shaped outflow is the simplest form of a water clock and is  known to have existed in [[Babylon]] and in [[Egypt]] around the 16th century BC. Other regions of the world, including [[India]] and [[China]], also have early evidence of water clocks, but the earliest dates are less certain. Some authors, however, write about water clocks appearing as early as 4000 BC in these regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cowan|1958|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] astronomer, [[Andronicus of Cyrrhus]], supervised the construction of the [[Tower of the Winds]] in Athens in the 1st century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sailingissues.com/yachting-guide/tower-of-winds-1.html Tower of the Winds - Athens]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] civilizations are credited for initially advancing water clock design to include complex [[gear]]ing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcytech.org/java/clock/clock_history.html The History of Clocks]&lt;/ref&gt; which was connected to fanciful [[automaton|automata]] and also resulted in improved accuracy. These advances were passed on through [[Byzantium]] and [[Islamic]] times, eventually making their way back to [[Europe]]. Independently, the Chinese developed their own advanced water clocks（钟）in 725 A.D., passing their ideas on to [[Korea]] and [[Japan]].

[[File:Clock of al Jazari before 1206.jpg|thumb|left|Automatic clock of [[al-Jazari]], 12th century.]]
Some water clock designs were developed independently and some knowledge was transferred through the spread of trade. [[Pre-modern]] societies do not have the same precise timekeeping requirements that exist in modern [[industrialism|industrial]] societies, where every hour of work or rest is monitored, and work may start or finish at any time regardless of external conditions.  Instead, water clocks in ancient societies were used mainly for [[astrology|astrological]] reasons. These early water clocks were calibrated with a [[sundial]].  While never reaching the level of accuracy of a modern timepiece, the water clock was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for millennia, until it was replaced by the more accurate [[pendulum clock]] in 17th century Europe.

Islamic civilization is credited with further advancing the accuracy of clocks with elaborate engineering. In 797 (or possibly 801), the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]] of [[Baghdad]], [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented [[Charlemagne]] with an [[Asian Elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]] together with a &quot;particularly elaborate example&quot; of a water&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = James | first = Peter | title = Ancient Inventions | year = 1995 | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-345-40102-6 | page = 126 | publisher = Ballantine Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  clock.

[[File:Al-jazari elephant clock.png|thumb|right|200px|An [[elephant clock]] in a manuscript by [[Al-Jazari]] (1206 AD) from ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn al-Razzaz Al-Jazari]] (ed. 1974), ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices''. Translated and annotated by [[Donald Routledge Hill]], Dordrecht/[[D. Reidel]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]In the 13th century, [[Al-Jazari]], an engineer who worked for [[Artuqid]] king of Diyar-Bakr, [[Nasir al-Din]], made numerous clocks of all shapes and sizes. The book described 50 mechanical devices in 6 categories, including water clocks.  The most reputed clocks included [[Elephant clock|the Elephant]], Scribe and [[Castle clock]]s, all of which have been successfully reconstructed.  As well as telling the time, these grand clocks were symbols of status, grandeur and wealth of the Urtuq State.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Early mechanical clocks==

None of the first clocks survive from 13th century Europe, but various mentions in church records reveal some of the early history of the clock.

The word ''horologia'' (from the Greek ὡρα, hour, and λέγειν, to tell) was used to describe all these devices, but the use of this word (still used in several [[Romance languages]]) for all timekeepers conceals from us the true nature of the mechanisms. For example, there is a record that in 1176 [[Cathédrale Saint-Étienne de Sens|Sens Cathedral]] installed a ‘horologe’{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} but the mechanism used is unknown. According to [[Jocelin of Brakelond]], in 1198 during a fire at the abbey of St Edmundsbury (now [[Bury St Edmunds]]), the monks 'ran to the clock' to fetch water, indicating that their water clock had a reservoir large enough to help extinguish the occasional fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Chronicle of Jocelin of Brakelond, Monk of St. Edmundsbury: A Picture of Monastic and Social Life on the XIIth Century | year=1910 | location=London | publisher=Chatto and Windus.  Translated and edited by L. C. Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A new mechanism===

The word ''clock'' (from the Latin word ''clocca'', &quot;bell&quot;), which gradually supersedes &quot;horologe&quot;, suggests that it was the sound of bells which also characterized the prototype mechanical clocks that appeared during the 13th century in [[Europe]].

Outside of Europe, the [[escapement]] mechanism had been known and used in medieval China, as the [[Song Dynasty]] horologist and engineer [[Su Song]] (1020–1101) incorporated it into his astronomical clock-tower of [[Kaifeng]] in 1088.&lt;ref&gt;History of Song 宋史, Vol. 340&lt;/ref&gt; However, his astronomical clock and rotating [[armillary sphere]] still relied on the use of flowing water (i.e. [[hydraulics]]), while European clockworks of the following centuries shed this old habit for a more efficient driving power of weights, in addition to the escapement mechanism.

A mercury clock, described in the ''Libros del saber'', a Spanish work from AD 1277 consisting of translations and paraphrases of Arabic works, is sometimes quoted as evidence for Muslim knowledge of a mechanical clock. The first mercury powered automata clock was invented by Ibn Khalafa al-Muradi&lt;ref name=Leonardo&gt;{{cite web|title=The Book of Secrets is coming to the world after a thousand years: Automata existed already in the eleventh century!|author=[[Mario Taddei]]|publisher=Leonardo3|url=http://www.leonardo3.net/leonardo/qma/img/Press_release_Secrets_UK.pdf|accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Arabic Mechanical Engineering: Survey of the Historical sources|author=[[Donald Routledge Hill]]|journal=[[Arabic Sciences and Philosophy: A Historical Journal]]|year=1991|volume=1|pages=167–186 [173]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|doi=10.1017/S0957423900001478|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Between 1280 and 1320, there is an increase in the number of references to clocks and horologes in church records, and this probably indicates that a new type of clock mechanism had been devised. Existing clock mechanisms that used [[Hydropower|water power]] were being adapted to take their driving power from falling weights. This power was controlled by some form of oscillating mechanism, probably derived from existing bell-ringing or alarm devices. This controlled release of power - the [[escapement]] - marks the beginning of the true mechanical clock.
 
These mechanical clocks were intended for two main purposes: for signalling and notification (e.g. the timing of services and public events), and for modeling the [[solar system]]. The former purpose is administrative, the latter arises naturally given the scholarly interest in astronomy, science, astrology, and how these subjects integrated with the religious philosophy of the time. The [[astrolabe]] was used both by astronomers and astrologers, and it was natural to apply a clockwork drive to the rotating plate to produce a working model of the solar system.

Simple clocks intended mainly for notification were installed in towers, and did not always require faces or hands. They would have announced the [[canonical hours]] or intervals between set times of prayer. Canonical hours varied in length as the times of sunrise and sunset shifted. The more sophisticated astronomical clocks would have had moving dials or hands, and would have shown the time in various time systems, including [[hour|Italian hours]], canonical hours, and time as measured by astronomers at the time. Both styles of clock started acquiring extravagant features such as [[automata]].

In 1283, a large clock was installed at [[Dunstable Priory]]; its location above the [[rood screen]] suggests that it was not a water clock {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. In 1292, [[Canterbury Cathedral]] installed a 'great horloge'. Over the next 30 years there are brief mentions of clocks at a number of ecclesiastical institutions in England, Italy, and France. In 1322, a new clock was installed in [[Norwich]], an expensive replacement for an earlier clock installed in 1273. This had a large (2 metre) astronomical dial with automata and bells. The costs of the installation included the full-time employment of two [[clockkeeper]]s for two years {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}.

===Early astronomical clocks===

[[File:Abbot Richard Wallingford.jpg|thumb|right|[[Richard of Wallingford]] pointing to a clock, his gift to [[St Albans Abbey]]]]
Besides the Chinese astronomical clock of Su Song in 1088 mentioned above, in Europe there were the clocks constructed by [[Richard of Wallingford]] in [[St Albans]] by 1336, and by Giovanni [[de Dondi]] in [[Padua, Italy|Padua]] from 1348 to 1364. They no longer exist, but detailed descriptions of their design and construction survive,{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} and modern reproductions have been made. They illustrate how quickly the theory of the mechanical clock had been translated into practical constructions, and also that one of the many impulses to their development had been the desire of astronomers to investigate celestial phenomena.

Wallingford's clock had a large astrolabe-type dial, showing the sun, the moon's age, phase, and node, a star map, and possibly the planets. In addition, it had a wheel of fortune and an indicator of the state of the tide at [[London Bridge]]. Bells rang every hour, the number of strokes indicating the time.

Dondi's clock was a seven-sided construction, 1 metre high, with dials showing the time of day, including minutes, the motions of all the known planets, an automatic calendar of fixed and [[Moveable feast|movable feasts]], and an eclipse prediction hand rotating once every 18 years.

It is not known how accurate or reliable these clocks would have been. They were probably adjusted manually every day to compensate for errors caused by wear and imprecise manufacture.

Water clocks are sometimes still used today, and can be examined in places such as ancient castles and museums.

The [[Salisbury cathedral clock|Salisbury Cathedral clock]], built in 1386, is considered to be the world's oldest surviving mechanical clock that strikes the hours.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Charles, et al. ''Oxford History of Technology: volume II, from the Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution'' (OUP 1957)pg 650-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later developments===
[[File:Henlein_Taschenuhr.jpg|thumb|One of the first pocket watches, called &quot;Nuremberg Egg&quot;, made arround 1510 and attributed to Peter Henlein, (Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg)]]
Clockmakers developed their art in various ways. Building smaller clocks was a technical challenge, as was improving accuracy and reliability. Clocks could be impressive showpieces to demonstrate skilled craftsmanship, or less expensive, mass-produced items for domestic use. The escapement in particular was an important factor affecting the clock's accuracy, so many different mechanisms were tried.

Spring-driven clocks appeared during the 15th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Usher|first=Abbot Payson|title=A History of Mechanical Inventions|year=1988|publisher=Courier Dover|isbn=048625593X|url=http://books.google.com/?id=xuDDqqa8FlwC&amp;pg=PA305|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Lynn Jr.|title=Medieval Technology and Social Change|publisher=Oxford Univ.

Wilsonisbn=0824209583|page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The earliest existing spring driven clock is the chamber clock given to Peter the Good, Duke of Burgundy, around 1430, now in the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot; /&gt; Spring power presented clockmakers with a new problem; how to keep the clock [[movement (clockwork)|movement]] running at a constant rate as the spring ran down.  This resulted in the invention of the ''stackfreed'' and the [[fusee]] in the 15th century, and many other innovations, down to the invention of the modern ''going [[barrel (horology)|barrel]]'' in 1760.

Early clock dials did not use minutes and seconds.  A clock with a dial indicating minutes was illustrated in a 1475 manuscript by Paulus Almanus,&lt;ref name=haencyc&gt;p. 529, &quot;Time and timekeeping instruments&quot;, ''History of astronomy: an encyclopedia'', John Lankford, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997, ISBN 081530322X.&lt;/ref&gt; and some 15th-century clocks in [[Germany]] indicated minutes and seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=xuDDqqa8FlwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+mechanical+inventions,+Abbott+Payson+Usher#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=209|title=A history of mechanical inventions |first=Abbott Payson|last=Usher|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1988|isbn=048625593X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An early record of a second hand on a clock dates back to about 1560, on a clock now in the Fremersdorf collection.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} However, this clock could not have been accurate, and the second hand was probably for indicating that the clock was working.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, clockmaking flourished, particularly in the metalworking towns of [[Nuremberg]] and [[Augsburg]], and in [[Blois]], France. Some of the more basic table clocks have only one time-keeping hand, with the dial between the hour markers being divided into four equal parts making the clocks readable to the nearest 15 minutes. Other clocks were exhibitions of craftsmanship and skill, incorporating astronomical indicators and musical movements. The [[escapement#Cross-beat escapement|cross-beat escapement]] was invented in 1584 by [[Jost Bürgi]], who also developed the [[remontoire]].  Bürgi's clocks were a great improvement in accuracy as they were correct to within a minute a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor = Lance Day and Ian McNeil | title = Biographical dictionary of the history of technology | publisher = [[Routledge]] (Routledge Reference) | year = 1996 | page = 116 | isbn =0-415-06042-7 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=nqAOAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage}}

These clocks helped the 16th-century astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] to observe astronomical events with much greater precision than before.

A mechanical weight-driven [[astronomical clock]] with a verge-and-foliot escapement, a striking train of gears, an alarm, and a representation of the moon's phases was described by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] engineer [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]] in his book, ''The Brightest Stars for the Construction of Mechanical Clocks'' (''Al-Kawākib al-durriyya fī wadh' al-bankāmat al-dawriyya''), published in 1556-1559.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Y al-Hassan &amp; Donald R. Hill: “Islamic Technology”, Cambridge 1986, ISBN 0-521-422396, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly to earlier 15th-century European alarm clocks,&lt;ref&gt;p. 249, ''The Grove encyclopedia of decorative arts'', Gordon Campbell, vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2006, ISBN 0195189485.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://national-clockshop-directory.com/Clock-Dictionary/m-main.htm &quot;Monastic Alarm Clocks, Italian&quot;], entry, Clock Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; it was capable of sounding at a specified time, achieved by placing a peg on the dial wheel. At the requested time, the peg activated a ringing device.  The clock had three [[Clock face|dials]] which indicated hours, degrees and minutes.  He later made an observational clock for the [[Istanbul observatory of Taqi al-Din]] (1577–1580), describing it as &quot;a mechanical clock with three dials which show the hours, the minutes, and the seconds.&quot; This was an important innovation in 16th-century practical astronomy, as at the start of the century clocks were not accurate enough to be used for astronomical purposes.&lt;ref name=Tekeli&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Sevim|last=Tekeli|title=Taqi al-Din|year=1997|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]]|isbn=0792340663|url=http://www.springer.com/philosophy/philosophy+of+sciences/book/978-1-4020-4425-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Musée du temps Besançon 3.jpg|thumb|French [[rococo]] bracket clocks, (Museum of Time, Besançon)]]

The next development in accuracy occurred after 1656 with the invention of the [[pendulum clock]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] had the idea to use a swinging bob to regulate the motion of a time telling device earlier in the 17th century.  [[Christiaan Huygens]], however, is usually credited as the inventor.  He determined the mathematical formula that related pendulum length to time  (99.38&amp;nbsp;cm or 39.13&amp;nbsp;inches for the one second movement) and had the first pendulum-driven clock made.  In 1670, the English clockmaker William Clement created the [[anchor escapement]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} an improvement over Huygens' crown escapement {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. Within just one generation, [[minute]] hands and then [[second]] hands were added.

A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship. Many European governments offered a large [[longitude prize|prize]] for anyone that could determine longitude accurately; for example, Great Britain offered 20,000 pounds, equivalent to millions of dollars today. The reward was eventually claimed in 1761 by [[John Harrison]], who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks. His [[John Harrison#The longitude watches|H5]] clock was in error by less than 5 seconds over 10 weeks.&lt;ref name=gould&gt;{{cite book|author=Gould, Rupert T.|authorlink=Rupert Gould|title=The Marine Chronometer. Its History and Development|location=London|publisher=J. D. Potter|pages=66|year=1923|isbn=0-907462-05-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The excitement over the pendulum clock had attracted the attention of designers resulting in a proliferation of clock forms. Notably, the [[longcase clock]] (also known as the ''grandfather clock'') was created to house the pendulum and works. The English clockmaker William Clement is also credited with developing this form in 1670 or 1671. It was also at this time that clock cases began to be made of wood and [[clock face]]s to utilize [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] as well as hand-painted ceramics.[[File:Horloge-republicaine1.jpg|thumb|right|French decimal clock from the time of the [[French Revolution]]]]

On November 17, 1797, [[Eli Terry]] received his first [[patent]] for a clock. Terry is known as the founder of the American clock-making industry.

[[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]], Scottish clockmaker, patented the [[electric clock]] in 1840. The electric clock's mainspring is wound either with an [[electric motor]] or with an [[electro-magnet]] and armature. In 1841, he first patented the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] pendulum.

The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all. Time in these cases is measured in several ways, such as by the vibration of a [[tuning fork]], the behaviour of [[quartz]] crystals, or the quantum vibrations of atoms.  Even mechanical clocks have since come to be largely powered by batteries, removing the need for winding.

==How clocks work==
The invention of the mechanical clock in the 13th century initiated a change in timekeeping methods from [[Continuous function|continuous]] processes, such as the motion of the [[gnomon]]'s shadow on a [[sundial]] or the flow of liquid in a [[water clock]], to repetitive [[oscillatory]] processes, like the swing of a [[pendulum]] or the vibration of a [[quartz crystal]], which were more accurate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cipolla&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cipolla|first=Carlo M.|title=Clocks and Culture, 1300 to 1700|year=2004|publisher=W.W.

Although the methods they use vary, all oscillating clocks, mechanical and digital and atomic, work similarly and can be divided into analogous parts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jespersen&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jespersen|first=James|coauthors=Fitz-Randolph, Jane; Robb, John|title=From Sundials to Atomic Clocks: Understanding Time and Frequency|publisher=Courier Dover|year=1999|location=New York|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=clock+resonance+pendulum|isbn=0486409139|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How clocks work|work=InDepthInfo|publisher=W.

Attached to the oscillator is a ''controller'' device, which sustains the oscillator's motion by replacing the energy it loses to [[friction]], and converts its oscillations into a series of pulses.  The pulses are then added up in a chain of some type of ''counter''s to express the time in convenient units, usually seconds, minutes, hours, etc.  Then finally some kind of ''indicator'' displays the result in a human-readable form.

Since clocks must run continuously, there is often a small secondary power source to keep the clock going temporarily during interruptions in the main power.  In old mechanical clocks, a ''[[maintaining power]] spring'' kept the clock turning while the [[mainspring]] was being wound.  In [[quartz clock]]s that use AC power, a small [[backup battery]] is often included to keep the clock running if it is unplugged temporarily from the wall.

===Oscillator===
The timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s repetitively at a precisely constant [[frequency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Marrison&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marrison|first=Warren|title=The Evolution of the Quartz Crystal Clock|journal=Bell System Technical Journal|volume=27|pages=510–588|publisher=American Telephone and Telegraph Co.|year=1948|url=http://www.ieee-uffc.org/fcmain.asp?page=marrison|accessdate=2008-06-04|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In mechanical clocks, this is either a [[pendulum]] or a [[balance wheel]].
*In some early electronic clocks and watches such as the [[Accutron]], it is a [[tuning fork]].
*In [[quartz clock]]s and watches, it is a [[quartz crystal]].
*In [[atomic clock]]s, it is the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s.
*In early mechanical clocks before 1657, it was a crude balance wheel or [[foliot]] which was not a harmonic oscillator because it lacked a [[balance spring]].  As a result they were very inaccurate, with errors of perhaps an hour a day.&lt;ref&gt;Milham, 1945, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;
The advantage of a harmonic oscillator over other forms of oscillator is that it employs [[resonance]] to vibrate at a precise natural [[resonant frequency]] or 'beat' dependent only on its physical characteristics, and resists vibrating at other rates.  The possible precision achievable by a harmonic oscillator is measured by a parameter called its [[Q factor|Q]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality factor, Q|work=Glossary|publisher=Time and Frequency Division, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)|year=2008|url=http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|accessdate=2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;sig=iBunChocEtJoeKS5p5IgJ1oyl4U Jespersen 1999, p.47-50]&lt;/ref&gt; or quality factor, which increases (other things being equal) with its resonant frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riehle|first=Fritz|title=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|publisher=Wiley VCH Verlag &amp; Co.|year=2004|location=Germany|page=9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=WZ34pQV-DXMC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Q+linewidth+%22split+the+line%22|isbn=3527402306}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is why there has been a long term trend toward higher frequency oscillators in clocks.  Balance wheels and pendulums always include a means of adjusting the rate of the timepiece.  Quartz timepieces sometimes include a rate screw that adjusts a [[capacitor]] for that purpose.  Atomic clocks are [[Standard (technical)|primary standards]], and their rate cannot be adjusted.

====Synchronized or slave clocks====
Some clocks rely for their accuracy on an external oscillator; that is, they are automatically [[Synchronization|synchronized]] to a more accurate clock:
*[[Slave clock]]s, used in large institutions and schools from the 1860s to the 1970s, kept time with a pendulum, but were wired to a [[master clock]] in the building, and periodically received a signal to synchronize them with the master, often on the hour.&lt;ref&gt;Milham, 1945, p.325-328&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions without pendulums were triggered by a pulse from the master clock and certain sequences used to force rapid synchronization following a power failure.
*[[Electric clock|Synchronous electric clocks]] don't have an internal oscillator, but rely on the 50 or 60 [[Hz]] oscillation of the [[Mains power|AC power line]], which is synchronized by the utility to a precision oscillator.  This drives a [[synchronous motor]] in the clock which rotates once for every cycle of the line voltage, and drives the gear train.
*Computer [[real time clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but are periodically (usually weekly) synchronized over the internet to atomic clocks ([[UTC]]), using a system called [[Network Time Protocol]].
*[[Radio clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but are periodically (often daily) synchronized to atomic clocks ([[UTC]]) with time signals from government radio stations like [[WWV]], [[WWVB]], [[CHU]], [[DCF77]] and the [[GPS]] system.

===Controller===
This has the dual function of keeping the oscillator running by giving it 'pushes' to replace the energy lost to [[friction]], and converting its vibrations into a series of pulses that serve to measure the time.
*In mechanical clocks, this is the [[escapement]], which gives precise pushes to the swinging pendulum or balance wheel, and releases one gear tooth of the ''escape wheel'' at each swing, allowing all the clock's wheels to move forward a fixed amount with each swing.
*In electronic clocks this is an [[Electronic oscillator|electronic oscillator circuit]] that gives the vibrating quartz crystal or tuning fork tiny 'pushes', and generates a series of electrical pulses, one for each vibration of the crystal, which is called the [[clock signal]].
*In [[atomic clock]]s the controller is an evacuated [[microwave]] [[Cavity resonator|cavity]] attached to a microwave [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] controlled by a [[microprocessor]].  A thin gas of [[cesium]] atoms is released into the cavity where they are exposed to [[microwaves]].  A laser measures how many atoms have absorbed the microwaves, and an electronic [[feedback]] control system called a [[phase locked loop]] tunes the microwave oscillator until it is at the exact frequency that causes the atoms to vibrate and absorb the microwaves.  Then the microwave signal is divided by [[digital counter]]s to become the [[clock signal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;sig=r7PLMbI4rhAgfGkfBS-MCJEBkVs Jespersen 1999, p.52-62]&lt;/ref&gt;
In mechanical clocks, the low [[Q factor|Q]] of the balance wheel or pendulum oscillator made them very sensitive to the disturbing effect of the impulses of the escapement, so the escapement had a great effect on the accuracy of the clock, and many escapement designs were tried.  The higher Q of resonators in electronic clocks makes them relatively insensitive to the disturbing effects of the drive power, so the driving oscillator circuit is a much less critical component.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marrison&quot; /&gt;

===Counter chain===
This counts the pulses and adds them up to get traditional time units of [[second]]s, [[minute]]s, [[hour]]s, etc.  It usually has a provision for ''setting'' the clock by manually entering the correct time into the counter.
*In mechanical clocks this is done mechanically by a [[gear train]], known as the [[wheel train (horology)|wheel train]].  The gear train also has a second function; to transmit mechanical power from the power source to run the oscillator.  There is a friction coupling called the 'cannon pinion' between the gears driving the hands and the rest of the clock, allowing the hands to be turned by a knob on the back to set the time.&lt;ref&gt;Milham, 1945, p.113&lt;/ref&gt;
*In digital clocks a series of [[integrated circuit]] [[counter]]s or dividers add the pulses up [[digital]]ly, using [[binary numeral system|binary]] logic.  Often pushbuttons on the case allow the hour and minute counters to be incremented and decremented to set the time.

===Indicator===
This displays the count of seconds, minutes, hours, etc. in a human readable form.
*The earliest mechanical clocks in the 13th century didn't have a visual indicator and signalled the time [[wikt:audible|audibly]] by striking [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s.  Many clocks to this day are [[striking clock]]s which strike the hour.
*[[Analog clock]]s, including almost all mechanical and some electronic clocks, have a traditional dial or [[clock face]], that displays the time in [[Analog signal|analog]] form with moving hour and minute hand. In [[quartz clock]]s with analog faces, a 1 [[Hertz|Hz]] signal from the counters actuates a [[stepper motor]] which moves the second hand forward at each pulse, and the minute and hour hands are moved by gears from the shaft of the second hand.
*[[Digital clock]]s display the time in periodically changing [[numerical digit|digit]]s on a digital [[display device|display]].
*[[Talking clock]]s and the [[speaking clock]] services provided by telephone companies speak the time audibly, using either recorded or digitally [[Voice synthesis|synthesized voices]].

==Types==
Clocks can be classified by the type of time display, as well as by the method of timekeeping.

===Time display methods===
====Analog clocks====
{{See also|Clock face}}
[[File:Picadillycircuslinearclock.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A linear clock at [[London]]'s [[Piccadilly Circus tube station]]. The 24 hour band moves across the static map, keeping pace with the apparent movement of the sun above ground, and a pointer fixed on London points to the current time]]

Analog clocks usually indicate time using angles. The most common [[clock face]] uses a fixed numbered dial or dials and moving hand or hands. It usually has a circular scale of 12 [[hour]]s, which can also serve as a scale of 60 [[minute]]s, and 60 [[seconds]] if the clock has a second hand.  Many other styles and designs have been used throughout the years, including dials divided into 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours.  The only other widely used clock face today is the [[24 hour analog dial]], because of the use of [[24 hour time]] in [[military]] organizations and timetables.  The [[10-hour clock]] was briefly popular during the [[French Revolution]], when the [[metric system]] was applied to time measurement, and an Italian 6 hour clock was developed in the 18th century, presumably to save power (a clock or watch striking 24 times uses more power).

Another type of analog clock is the [[sundial]], which tracks the sun continuously, registering the time by the shadow position of its [[gnomon]]. Sundials use some or part of the 24 hour analog dial.  There also exist clocks which use a digital display despite having an analog mechanism—these are commonly referred to as [[flip clock]]s.

Alternative systems have been proposed. For example, the Twelve o'clock indicates the current hour using one of twelve colors, and indicates the minute by showing a proportion of a circular disk, similar to a [[Lunar phase|moon phase]].

====Digital clocks====
[[File:KanazawaStationClock.jpg|thumb|right|Digital clock outside [[Kanazawa Station]] displaying the time by controlling valves on a fountain]]
[[File:Digital-clock-radio-basic hf.jpg|thumb|Basic digital clock radio]]
[[File:Android home.png|thumb|[[Cell phone]] display including a clock]]
[[File:RailwayStationClock.jpg|thumb|right|A typical [[Deutsche Bahn]] [[Train station]] clock]]
[[Image:Harrison's Chronometer H5.JPG|thumb|[[John Harrison]]'s Chronometer H5]]

Digital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numeric display formats are commonly used on [[digital]] clocks:

* the [[24-hour notation]] with hours ranging 00–23;
* the [[12-hour notation]] with AM/PM indicator, with hours indicated as 12AM, followed by 1AM–11AM, followed by 12PM, followed by 1PM–11PM (a notation mostly used in the United States and Canada).

Most digital clocks use an [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] display; many other display technologies are used as well ([[cathode ray tube]]s, [[nixie tube]]s, etc.). After a reset, battery change or power failure, digital clocks without a backup [[battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[capacitor]] either start counting from 12:00, or
stay at 12:00, often with blinking digits indicating that time needs to be set.  Some newer clocks will actually reset themselves based on radio or Internet [[time server]]s that are tuned to national [[atomic clock]]s.  Since the advent of digital clocks in the 1960s, the use of analogue clocks has declined significantly.

====Auditory clocks====
{{Main|Talking clock}}
For convenience, distance, telephony or blindness, auditory clocks present the time as sounds. The sound is either spoken [[natural language]], (e.g. &quot;The time is twelve thirty-five&quot;), or as auditory codes (e.g. number of sequential bell rings on the hour represents the number of the hour like the bell [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]]). Most telecommunication companies also provide a [[Speaking clock]] service as well.

==Purposes==
Clocks are in homes, offices and many other places; smaller ones ([[watch]]es) are carried on the wrist; larger ones are in public places, e.g. a [[train station]] or [[Church (building)|church]]. A small clock is often shown in a corner of [[computer display]]s, [[mobile phone]]s and many [[MP3 player]]s.

The purpose of a clock is not always to ''display'' the time. It may also be used to ''control'' a device according to time, e.g. an alarm clock, a [[VCR]], or a [[Time bomb (explosive)|time bomb]] (see: [[counter]]). However, in this context, it is more appropriate to refer to it as a [[timer]] or trigger mechanism rather than strictly as a clock.

[[Computer]]s depend on an accurate internal [[clock signal]] to allow synchronized processing. (A few research projects are developing CPUs based on [[asynchronous circuit]]s.) Some computers also maintain time and date for all manner of operations whether these be for alarms, event initiation, or just to display the time of day. The internal computer clock is generally kept running by a small battery. Many computers will still function even if the internal clock battery is dead, but the computer clock will need to be reset each time the computer is restarted, since once power is lost, time is also lost.

===Ideal clocks===
An [[ideal clock]] is a scientific principle that measures the ratio of the duration of natural processes, and thus will give the time measure for use in physical theories.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Therefore, to define an ideal clock in terms of any physical theory would be circular. An ideal clock is more appropriately defined in relationship to the set of all physical processes.

This leads to the following definitions:
*A clock is a recurrent process and a [[counter]].
*A good clock is one which, when used to measure other recurrent processes, finds many of them to be periodic.
*An ideal clock is a clock (i.e., recurrent process) that makes the most other recurrent processes periodic.

The recurrent, periodic process (e.g. a [[metronome]]) is an [[oscillator]] and typically generates a ''clock signal''. Sometimes that signal alone is (confusingly) called &quot;the clock&quot;, but sometimes &quot;the clock&quot; includes the counter, its indicator, and everything else supporting it.

This definition can be further improved by the consideration of successive levels of smaller and smaller error tolerances. While not all physical processes can be surveyed, the definition should be based on the set of physical processes which includes all individual physical processes which are proposed for consideration. Since atoms are so numerous and since, within current measurement tolerances they all beat in a manner such that if one is chosen as periodic then the others are all deemed to be periodic also, it follows that [[atomic clock]]s represent ideal clocks to within present measurement tolerances and in relation to all presently known physical processes. However, they are not so designated by fiat. Rather, they are designated as the current ideal clock because they are currently the best instantiation of the definition.

===Navigation===
[[Navigation]] by ships and planes depends on the ability to measure [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. Latitude is fairly easy to determine through [[celestial navigation]], but the measurement of [[longitude]] requires accurate measurement of time. This need was a major motivation for the development of accurate mechanical clocks. [[John Harrison]] created the first highly accurate [[marine chronometer]] in the mid-18th century. The [[Noon gun]] in [[Cape Town]] still fires an accurate signal to allow ships to check their [[marine chronometer|chronometers]].

Use of an [[atomic clock]] in radio signal producing [[satellite]]s is fundamental to the operation of [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] (Global Positioning System) navigation devices.

==Seismology==
In determining the location of an [[earthquake]], the arrival time of several types of [[seismic wave]] at a minimum of four dispersed observers is dependent upon each observer recording wave [[arrival time]]s according to a common clock.

'''Charles Proteus Steinmetz''' (April 9, 1865 – October 26, 1923) was a [[German-American]] [[mathematician]] and [[electrical engineer]]. He fostered the development of [[alternating current]] that made possible the expansion of the electric power industry in the United States, formulating mathematical theories for engineers. He made ground-breaking discoveries in the understanding of [[hysteresis]] that enabled engineers to design better electric motors for use in industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/139.html Invent Now | Hall of Fame | Search | Inventor Profile&lt;!--bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.invent.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Steinmetz was born as '''Carl August Rudolph Steinmetz''' to Carl Heinrich Steinmetz in [[Breslau]], [[Province of Silesia]]. Steinmetz suffered from [[dwarfism]], [[Kyphosis|hunchback]], and [[Hip dysplasia (human)|hip dysplasia]], as did his father and grandfather. Steinmetz attended Johannes [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] and astonished his teachers with his proficiency in mathematics and physics.
===Socialist activities===
Following the Gymnasium Steinmetz went on to the [[University of Breslau]] to begin work on his undergraduate degree in 1883. He was on the verge of finishing his Doctorate in 1888 when he came under investigation by the German police for activities on behalf of a [[socialist]] university group and articles he had written for a local socialist newspaper.

As socialist meetings and press had been banned in Germany, Steinmetz fled to [[Zürich]] in 1888 to escape possible arrest.  Faced with an expiring visa, he emigrated to the United States in 1889.

[[Cornell University]] Professor Ronald R. Kline, the author of ''Steinmetz: Engineer and Socialist'', contends that other factors were more directly involved in Steinmetz's decision to leave his homeland, such as the fact that he was in arrears with his tuition at the University of Breslau and that life at home with his father, stepmother, and their daughters was full of tension.

Despite his earlier efforts and interest in socialism, by 1922 Steinmetz concluded that socialism would never work in the United States because the country lacked a &quot;powerful, centralized government of competent men, remaining continuously in office&quot; and because &quot;only a small percentage of Americans accept this viewpoint today.&quot; ref&gt;http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=1512 Retrieved May-31-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in science==
Shortly after arriving in the US, Steinmetz went to work for [[Rudolf Eickemeyer]] in [[Yonkers, New York]], and published in the field of [[magnetic hysteresis]]. Eickemeyer's firm developed [[transformer]]s for use in the transmission of [[electrical]] power among many other mechanical and electrical devices. In 1893 Eickemeyer's company, along with all of his patents and designs, was bought by the newly formed [[General Electric]] Company.

===Forger of thunderbolts===
One of Steinmetz's great research projects was centered with the phenomena of lightning.  He undertook a systematic study of it, resulting in experiments of man-made lightning in the laboratory; this work was published. Steinmetz was called the &quot;forger of thunderbolts&quot;, being the first to create artificial lightning in his GE football field-sized laboratory and high towers, using 120,000 volt generators. He erected a lightning tower to attract lightning and studied the patterns and effects of lightning hits on tree bark and in a broken mirror—resulting in several theories and ideas (like the effect of lightning on plant growth and ac electric poles).

==Later years==
Steinmetz served as president of the [[Board of Education]] of Schenectady, and as president of the Schenectady [[city council]]. He was president of the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] (AIEE) from 1901 to 1902, as well as the first vice-president of the International Association of Municipal Electricians (IAME)—which later became the [[International Municipal Signal Association]] (IMSA)—from 1913 until his death. Steinmetz wrote 13 books and 60 articles, not all about science. He was an honorary member and advisor to the fraternity [[Phi Gamma Delta]] at Union (whose chapter house there was one of the first electrified houses ever). 

Steinmetz died on October 26, 1923 and was buried in [[Vale Cemetery]], [[Schenectady]].

==Legacy==
His connection to Union College is celebrated with the annual Steinmetz Symposium,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.union.edu/Academics/Steinmetz/]&lt;/ref&gt; a day-long event in which Union undergraduates give presentations on research they have done. Steinmetz Hall, which houses the [[Union College]] computer center, is named after him.

Steinmetz was portrayed in 1959 by the [[actor]] [[Rod Steiger]] in the [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] [[anthology series]], ''[[The Joseph Cotten Show]]''. The episode centered on his socialist activities in Germany.

A brilliant general, he lost only one battle in his career, (the [[Battle of Cologne]]). He is a founding figure of the [[Middle Ages]], often credited with a seminal role in the development of [[feudalism]] and [[knighthood]], and laying the groundwork for the [[Carolingian Empire]].&lt;ref name=Fouracre&gt;Fouracre, John. “The Age of Charles Martel''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;deMartelly, Louis. [http://www.amazon.com/dp/1434360377]. &quot;Charles Martel and the Lance of Destiny.&quot; Author Solutions (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the father of [[Pepin the Short]] and grandfather of [[Charlemagne]].

==Birth and youth==
Martel was born in [[Herstal]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, the illegitimate son of duke [[Pepin of Herstal|Pepin II]] and his concubine [[Alpaida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Charles Martel}}&lt;/ref&gt; In German-speaking countries he is known as '''Karl Martell'''. Alpaida also bore Pepin another son, [[Childebrand]].

==Contesting for power==
[[File:Francia at the death of Pepin of Heristal, 714.jpg|thumb|right|The Frankish kingdoms at the time of the death of Pepin of Heristal. Note that Aquitaine (yellow) was outside of Arnulfing authority and Neustria and Burgundy (pink) were united in opposition to further Arnulfing dominance of the highest offices. Only Austrasia (green) supported an Arnulfing mayor, first Theudoald then Charles. Note that the German duchies to the east of the Rhine were ''de facto'' outside of Frankish suzerainty at this time.]]
In December 714, [[Pepin of Heristal]] died. Prior to his death, he had, at his wife Plectrude's urging, designated [[Theudoald]], his grandson by their son [[Grimoald II|Grimoald]], his heir in the entire realm. This was immediately opposed by the nobles because Theudoald was a child of only eight years of age. To prevent Charles using this unrest to his own advantage, Plectrude had him imprisoned in [[Cologne]], the city which was destined to be her capital. This prevented an uprising on his behalf in [[Austrasia]], but not in [[Neustria]].

===Civil war of 715-718===
In 715, the Neustrian noblesse proclaimed [[Ragenfrid]] [[List of Mayors of the Palaces|mayor of their palace]] on behalf of, and apparently with the support of, [[Dagobert III]], the youngest of which, who in theory had the legal authority to select a mayor, though by this time the [[Merovingian]] dynasty had lost most such powers.

The Austrasians were not to be left supporting a woman and her young son for long. Before the end of the year, Charles Martel had escaped from prison and been acclaimed mayor by the nobles of that kingdom. The Neustrians had been attacking Austrasia and the nobles were waiting for a strong man to lead them against their invading countrymen. That year, Dagobert died and the Neustrians proclaimed [[Chilperic II]] king without the support of the rest of the Frankish people.

In 717, Chilperic and Ragenfrid together led an army into Austrasia. The Neustrians allied with another invading force under [[Radbod, King of the Frisians]] and met Charles in battle near Cologne, which was still held by Plectrude. Charles had little time to gather men, or prepare, and the result was the only defeat of his life. According to Strauss and Gustave, Martel fought a brilliant battle, but realized he could not prevail because he was outnumbered so badly, and retreated. In fact, he fled the field as soon as he realized he did not have the time or the men to prevail, retreating to the mountains of the [[Eifel]] to gather men, and train them. The king and his mayor then turned to besiege their other rival in the city and took it and the treasury, and received the recognition of both Chilperic as king and Ragenfrid as mayor. Plectrude surrendered on Theudoald's behalf.

===Military genius===
At this juncture, however, events turned in favor of Charles. Having made the proper preparations, he fell upon the triumphant army near [[Malmedy]] as it was returning to its own province, and, in the ensuing [[Battle of Amblève]], routed it. The few troops who were not killed or captured fled. Several things were notable about this battle, in which Charles set the pattern for the remainder of his military career: first, he appeared ''where'' his enemies least expected him, while they were marching triumphantly home and far outnumbered him. He also attacked ''when'' least expected, at midday, when armies of that era traditionally were resting. Finally, he attacked them ''how'' they least expected it, by feigning a retreat to draw his opponents into a trap. The feigned retreat, next to unknown in Western Europe at that time - it was a traditionally eastern tactic — required both extraordinary discipline on the part of the troops and exact timing on the part of their commander. Charles, in this battle, had begun demonstrating the military genius that would mark his rule. The result was an unbroken victory streak that lasted until his death.

In Spring 717, Charles returned to Neustria with an army and confirmed his supremacy with a victory at the [[Battle of Vincy]], near [[Cambrai]]. He chased the fleeing king and mayor to [[Paris]], before turning back to deal with Plectrude and Cologne. He took her city and dispersed her adherents. However, he allowed both Plectrude and the young Theudoald to live and treated them with kindness&amp;mdash;unusual for those [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], when mercy to a former jailer, or a potential rival, was rare. On this success, he proclaimed [[Clotaire IV]] king of [[Austrasia]] in opposition to Chilperic and deposed the [[archbishop of Rheims]], [[Rigobert]], replacing him with [[Milo (bishop)|Milo]], a lifelong supporter.

==Consolidation of power==
After subjugating all [[Austrasia]], he marched against [[Redbad, King of the Frisians|Radbod]] and pushed him back into his territory, even forcing the concession of [[West Frisia]] (later [[Holland]]). He also sent the [[Saxons]] back over the [[Weser]] and thus secured his borders&amp;mdash;in the name of the new king Clotaire, of course.
In 718, Chilperic responded to Charles' new ascendancy by making an alliance with [[Odo the Great]] (or Eudes, as he is sometimes known), the [[duke of Aquitaine]], who had made himself independent during the civil war in 715, but was again defeated, at the [[Battle of Soissons (718)|Battle of Soissons]], by Charles. The king fled with his ducal ally to the land south of the [[Loire]] and Ragenfrid fled to [[Angers]]. Soon Clotaire IV died and Odo gave up on Chilperic and, in exchange for recognising his dukedom, surrendered the king to Charles, who recognised his kingship over all the Franks in return for legitimate royal affirmation of his mayoralty, likewise over all the kingdoms (718).

[[File:The Saracen Army outside Paris, 730-32 AD.png|266px|thumb|The Saracen Army outside Paris, 730-32, in a early nineteenth-century depiction by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]]

===Foreign wars from 718-732===
The ensuing years were full of strife. Between 718 and 723, Charles secured his power through a series of victories: he won the loyalty of several important bishops and abbots (by donating lands and money for the foundation of abbeys such as [[Echternach]]), he subjugated [[Bavaria]] and [[Alemannia]], and he defeated the pagan [[Saxons]].

Having unified the Franks under his banner, Charles was determined to punish the Saxons who had invaded Austrasia. Therefore, late in 718, he laid waste their country to the banks of the [[Weser]], the [[Lippe]], and the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]]. He defeated them in the [[Teutoburg Forest]]. In 719, Charles seized [[West Frisia]] without any great resistance on the part of the [[Frisians]], who had been subjects of the Franks but had seized control upon the death of Pippin. Although Charles did not trust the pagans, their ruler, [[Adgillis II|Aldegisel]], accepted Christianity, and Charles sent [[Willibrord]], [[bishop of Utrecht]], the famous &quot;Apostle to the Frisians&quot; to convert the people. Charles also did much to support Winfrid, later [[Saint Boniface]], the &quot;Apostle of the Germans.&quot;

When Chilperic II died the following year (720), Charles appointed as his successor the son of Dagobert III, [[Theuderic IV]], who was still a minor, and who occupied the throne from 720 to 737. Charles was now appointing the kings whom he supposedly served, ''rois fainéants'' who were mere puppets in his hands; by the end of his reign they were so useless that he didn't even bother appointing one. At this time, Charles again marched against the Saxons. Then the Neustrians rebelled under Ragenfrid, who had left the county of Anjou. They were easily defeated (724), but Ragenfrid gave up his sons as hostages in turn for keeping his county. This ended the civil wars of Charles' reign.

The next six years were devoted in their entirety to assuring Frankish authority over the dependent Germanic tribes. Between 720 and 723, Charles was fighting in Bavaria, where the [[Agilolfing]] dukes had gradually evolved into independent rulers, recently in alliance with [[Liutprand the Lombard]]. He forced the [[Alemanni]] to accompany him, and Duke [[Hugbert of Bavaria|Hugbert]] submitted to Frankish suzerainty. In 725 and 728, he again entered Bavaria and the ties of lordship seemed strong. From his first campaign, he brought back the Agilolfing princess Swanachild, who apparently became his concubine. In 730, he marched against [[Lantfrid]], duke of Alemannia, who had also become independent, and killed him in battle. He forced the Alemanni capitulation to Frankish suzerainty and did not appoint a successor to Lantfrid. Thus, southern Germany once more became part of the Frankish kingdom, as had northern Germany during the first years of the reign.

But by 731, his own realm secure, Charles began to prepare exclusively for the coming storm from the south and west.

In 721, the [[emir of Córdoba]] had built up a strong army from [[Morocco]], [[Yemen]], and [[Syria]] to conquer [[Aquitaine]], the large duchy in the southwest of Gaul, nominally under Frankish sovereignty, but in practice almost independent in the hands of the [[Odo the Great]], the [[Duke of Aquitaine]], since the Merovingian kings had lost power. The invading Muslims besieged the city of Toulouse, then Aquitaine's most important city, and Odo (also called Eudes, or Eudo) immediately left to find help. He returned three months later just before the city was about to surrender and defeated the Muslim invaders on June 9, 721, at what is now known as the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]]. This critical defeat was essentially the result of a classic enveloping movement by Odo's forces. (After Odo originally fled, the Muslims became overconfident and, instead of maintaining strong outer defenses around their siege camp and continuous scouting, they did neither.) Thus, when Odo returned, he was able to launch a near complete surprise attack on the besieging force, scattering it at the first attack, and slaughtering units caught resting or that fled without weapons or armour.

Due to the situation in Iberia, Martel believed he needed a virtually fulltime army—one he could train intensely—as a core of veteran Franks who would be augmented with the usual conscripts called up in time of war. (During the [[Early Middle Ages]], troops were only available after the crops had been planted and before harvesting time.) To train the kind of infantry that could withstand the Muslim heavy cavalry, Charles needed them year-round, and he needed to pay them so their families could buy the food they would have otherwise grown. To obtain money he seized church lands and property, and used the funds to pay his soldiers. The same Charles who had secured the support of the ''ecclesia'' by donating land, seized some of it back between 724 and 732. Of course, Church officials were enraged, and, for a time, it looked as though Charles might even be excommunicated for his actions. But then came a significant invasion.

===Eve of Tours===
Historian [[Paul K. Davis]] said in ''[[100 Decisive Battles]]'' &quot;Having defeated Eudes, he turned to the Rhine to strengthen his northeastern borders - but in 725 was diverted south with the activity of the Muslims in Acquitane.&quot; Martel then concentrated his attention to the Umayyads, virtually for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Davis1999, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, 12 years later, when he had thrice rescued Gaul from Umayyad invasions, [[Antonio Santosuosso]] noted when he destroyed an Umayyad army sent to reinforce the invasion forces of the 735 campaigns, &quot;Charles Martel again came to the rescue.&quot;&lt;ref name=Santosuosso&gt;Santosuosso, Anthony . ''Barbarians, Marauders, and Infidels''2004&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that Charles Martel could have pursued the wars against the Saxons&amp;mdash;but he was determined to prepare for what he thought was a greater danger.

It is also vital to note that the Muslims were not aware, at that time, of the true strength of the Franks, or the fact that they were building a real army instead of the typical barbarian hordes that had dominated Europe after Rome's fall. The Arab Chronicles, the history of that age, show that Arab awareness of the Franks as a growing military power came only after the Battle of Tours when the Caliph expressed shock at his army's catastrophic defeat.

===Lead-up and importance===
{{Quote|It was under one of their ablest and most renowned commanders, with a veteran army, and with every apparent advantage of time, place, and circumstance, that the Arabs made their great effort at the conquest of Europe north of the Pyrenees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standin.se/fifteen07a.htm Poke's Fifteen Decisive Battles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
|[[Edward Shepherd Creasy]]|''[[The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World]]''}}

The [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]]n [[emirate]] had previously invaded [[Gaul]] and had been stopped in its northward sweep at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]], in 721. The hero of that less celebrated event had been Odo the Great, Duke of Aquitaine, who was not the progenitor of a race of kings and patron of chroniclers. It has previously been explained how Odo defeated the invading Muslims, but when they returned, things were far different. The arrival in the interim of a new [[emir of Cordoba]], [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]], who brought with him a huge force of Arabs and [[Berber people|Berber]] horsemen, triggered a far greater invasion. Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi had been at Toulouse, and the Arab Chronicles make clear he had strongly opposed the Emir's decision not to secure outer defenses against a relief force, which allowed Odo and his relief force to attack with impunity before the Islamic cavalry could assemble or mount. Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi had no intention of permitting such a disaster again. This time the Umayyad horsemen were ready for battle, and the results were horrific for the [[Aquitani]]ans. Odo, hero of Toulouse, was badly defeated in the Muslim invasion of 732 at the battle prior to the Muslim sacking of [[Bordeaux]], and when he gathered a second army, at the [[Battle of the River Garonne]]&amp;mdash;Western chroniclers state, &quot;God alone knows the number of the slain&quot;&amp;mdash; and the city of Bordeaux was sacked and looted. Odo fled to Charles, seeking help. Charles agreed to come to Odo's rescue, provided Odo acknowledged Charles and his house as his overlords, which Odo did formally at once. Charles was pragmatic; while most commanders would never use their enemies in battle, Odo and his remaining Aquitanian nobles formed the right flank of Charles's forces at Tours.

The [[Battle of Tours]] earned Charles the [[cognomen]] &quot;Martel&quot; ('Hammer') {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, for the merciless way he hammered his enemies. Many historians, including [[Edward Shepherd Creasy|Sir Edward Creasy]], believe that had he failed at Tours, [[Islam]] would probably have overrun [[Gaul]], and perhaps the remainder of Western Europe. [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] made clear his belief that the Umayyad armies would have conquered from Rome to the Rhine, and even England, having the English Channel for protection, with ease, had Martel not prevailed. Creasy said &quot;the great victory won by Charles Martel ... gave a decisive check to the career of Arab conquest in Western Europe, rescued Christendom from Islam, [and] preserved the relics of ancient and the germs of modern civilization.&quot; Gibbon's belief that the fate of Christianity hinged on this battle is echoed by other historians including [[John B. Bury]], and was very popular for most of modern historiography. It fell somewhat out of style in the 20th century, when historians such as [[Bernard Lewis]] contended that Arabs had little intention of occupying northern France. More recently, however, many historians have tended once again to view the Battle of Tours as a very significant event in the history of Europe and Christianity. Equally, many, such as [[William Watson]], still believe this battle was one of macrohistorical world-changing importance, if they do not go so far as Gibbon does rhetorically.

In the modern era, [[Matthew Bennett]] and his co-authors of ''&quot;Fighting Techniques of the Medieval World&quot;'', published in 2005, argue that &quot;few battles are remembered 1,000 years after they are fought ... but the Battle of Poitiers, (Tours) is an exception ... Charles Martel turned back a Muslim raid that had it been allowed to continue, might have conquered Gaul.&quot; Michael Grant, author of &quot;''History of Rome''&quot;, grants the Battle of Tours such importance that he lists it in the macrohistorical dates of the Roman era.

It is important to note however that modern Western historians, military historians, and writers, essentially fall into three camps. The first, those who believe Gibbon was right in his assessment that Martel saved Christianity and Western civilization by this battle are typified by Bennett, Paul Davis, Robert Martin, and educationalist [[Dexter B. Wakefield]] who writes in ''An Islamic Europe.''

{{quote|A Muslim France? Historically, it nearly happened. But as a result of Martel’s fierce opposition, which ended Muslim advances and set the stage for centuries of war thereafter, Islam moved no farther into Europe. European schoolchildren learn about the Battle of Tours in much the same way that American students learn about Valley Forge and Gettysburg.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomorrowsworld.org/cgi-bin/tw/tw-mag.cgi?category=Magazine42&amp;item=1149293702 An Islamic Europe?], ''Tomorrow's World'', Volume 8, No 3. ; [http://www.lcg.org/cgi-bin/tw/magazine/tw-mag.cgi?category=Magazine42&amp;item=1149293702 An Islamic Europe?]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The second camp of contemporary historians believe that a failure by Martel at Tours could have been a disaster, destroying what would become Western civilization after the [[Renaissance]]. Certainly all historians agree that no power would have remained in Europe able to halt Islamic expansion had the Franks failed. [[William E. Watson]], one of the most respected historians of this era, strongly supports Tours as a macrohistorical event, but distances himself from the rhetoric of Gibbon and Drubeck, writing, for example, of the battle's importance in Frankish, and world, history in 1993:

{{quote|There is clearly some justification for ranking Tours-Poitiers among the most significant events in Frankish history when one considers the result of the battle in light of the remarkable record of the successful establishment by Muslims of Islamic political and cultural dominance along the entire eastern and southern rim of the former Christian, Roman world. The rapid Muslim conquest of Palestine, Syria, Egypt and the North African coast all the way to Morocco in the seventh century resulted in the permanent imposition by force of Islamic culture onto a previously Christian and largely non-Arab base. The Visigothic kingdom fell to Muslim conquerors in a single battle on the Rio Barbate in 711, and the Hispanic Christian population took seven long centuries to regain control of the Iberian Peninsula. The Reconquista, of course, was completed in 1492, only months before Columbus received official backing for his fateful voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Had Charles Martel suffered at Tours-Poitiers the fate of King Roderick at the Rio Barbate, it is doubtful that a &quot;do-nothing&quot; sovereign of the Merovingian realm could have later succeeded where his talented major domus had failed. Indeed, as Charles was the progenitor of the Carolingian line of Frankish rulers and grandfather of Charlemagne, one can even say with a degree of certainty that the subsequent history of the West would have proceeded along vastly different currents had ‘Abd ar-Rahman been victorious at Tours-Poitiers in 732.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, William, E. (1993). [http://www.deremilitari.org/resources/articles/watson2.htm The Battle of Tours-Poitiers Revisited]. ''Providence: Studies in Western Civilization'' v.2 n.1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The final camp of Western historians believe that the importance of the battle is dramatically overstated. This view is typified by Alessandro Barbero, who writes, &quot;Today, historians tend to play down the significance of the battle of Poitiers, pointing out that the purpose of the Arab force defeated by Charles Martel was not to conquer the Frankish kingdom, but simply to pillage the wealthy monastery of St-Martin of Tours&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barbero, 2004, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Tomaž Mastnak writes:

{{quote|Modern historians have constructed a myth presenting this victory as having saved Christian Europe from the Muslims. Edward Gibbon, for example, called Charles Martel the savior of Christendom and the battle near Poitiers an encounter that changed the history of the world... This myth has survived well into our own times... Contemporaries of the battle, however, did not overstate its significance. The continuators of Fredegar's chronicle, who probably wrote in the mid-eighth century, pictured the battle as just one of many military encounters between Christians and Saracens - moreover, as only one in a series of wars fought by Frankish princes for booty and territory... One of Fredegar's continuators presented the battle of Poitiers as what it really was: an episode in the struggle between Christian princes as the Carolingians strove to bring Aquitaine under their rule.&lt;ref&gt;Mastnak, 2002, pp. 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, it is vital to note, when assessing Charles Martel's life, that even those historians who dispute the significance of this one battle as the event that saved Christianity, do not dispute that Martel himself had a huge effect on Western European history. Modern military historian [[Victor Davis Hanson]] acknowledges the debate on this battle, citing historians both for and against its macrohistorical placement:
{{quote|Recent scholars have suggested Poitiers, so poorly recorded in contemporary sources, was a mere raid and thus a construct of western myth-making or that a Muslim victory might have been preferable to continued Frankish dominance. What is clear is that Poitiers marked a general continuance of the successful defense of Europe, (from the Muslims). Flush from the victory at Tours, Charles Martel went on to clear southern France from Islamic attackers for decades, unify the warring kingdoms into the foundations of the Carolingian Empire, and ensure ready and reliable troops from local estates.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Victor Davis, 2001, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==After Tours==
In the subsequent decade, Charles led the Frankish army against the eastern duchies, Bavaria and Alemannia, and the southern duchies, [[Aquitaine]] and [[Provence]]. He dealt with the ongoing conflict with the [[Frisia]]ns and [[Saxons]] to his northeast with some success, but full conquest of the Saxons and their incorporation into the Frankish empire would wait for his grandson Charlemagne, primarily because Martel concentrated the bulk of his efforts against Muslim expansion.

So instead of concentrating on conquest to his east, he continued expanding Frankish authority in the west, and denying the Emirate of Córdoba a foothold in Europe beyond Al-Andalus. After his victory at Tours, Martel continued on in campaigns in 736 and 737 to drive other Muslim armies from bases in Gaul after they again attempted to get a foothold in Europe beyond Al-Andalus.

===Wars from 732-737===
Between his victory of 732 and 735, Charles reorganized the kingdom of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], replacing the counts and dukes with his loyal supporters, thus strengthening his hold on power. He was forced, by the ventures of [[Radbod, King of the Frisians|Radbod]], [[rulers of Frisia|duke of the Frisians]] (719-734), son of the Duke Aldegisel who had accepted the [[missionary|missionaries]] Willibrord and Boniface, to invade independence-minded Frisia again in 734. In that year, he slew the duke, who had expelled the Christian missionaries, in the [[battle of the Boarn]] and so wholly subjugated the populace (he destroyed every pagan shrine) that the people were peaceful for twenty years after.

The dynamic changed in 735 because of the death of Odo the Great, who had been forced to acknowledge, albeit reservedly, the suzerainty of Charles in 719. Though Charles wished to unite the duchy directly to himself and went there to elicit the proper homage of the Aquitainians, the nobility proclaimed Odo's son, [[Hunald of Aquitaine]], whose dukedom Charles recognised when the Umayyads invaded Provence the next year, and who equally was forced to acknowledge Charles as overlord as he had no hope of holding off the Muslims alone.

This naval Arab invasion was headed by Abdul Rahman's son. It landed in [[Narbonne]] in 736 and moved at once to reinforce [[Arles]] and move inland. Charles temporarily put the conflict with Hunold on hold, and descended on the Provençal strongholds of the Umayyads. In 736, he retook [[Montfrin]] and [[Avignon]], and Arles and [[Aix-en-Provence]] with the help of [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards]]. [[Nîmes]], [[Agde]], and [[Béziers]], held by Islam since 725, fell to him and their fortresses were destroyed. He crushed one Umayyad army at Arles, as that force sallied out of the city, and then took the city itself by a direct and brutal frontal attack, and burned it to the ground to prevent its use again as a stronghold for Umayyad expansion. He then moved swiftly and defeated a mighty host outside of Narbonnea at the River Berre, but failed to take the city. Military historians believe he could have taken it, had he chosen to tie up all his resources to do so&amp;mdash;but he believed his life was coming to a close, and he had much work to do to prepare for his sons to take control of the Frankish realm. A direct frontal assault, such as took Arles, using rope ladders and rams, plus a few catapults, simply was not sufficient to take Narbonne without horrific loss of life for the Franks, troops Martel felt he could not lose. Nor could he spare years to starve the city into submission, years he needed to set up the administration of an empire his heirs would reign over. He left Narbonne therefore, isolated and surrounded, and his son would return to liberate it for Christianity.

Notable about these campaigns was Charles' incorporation, for the first time, of heavy cavalry with stirrups to augment his [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]]. His ability to coordinate infantry and cavalry veterans was unequaled in that era and enabled him to face superior numbers of invaders, and to decisively defeat them again and again. Some historians believe the Battle against the main Muslim force at the River Berre, near Narbonne, in particular was as important a victory for Christian Europe as Tours. In ''Barbarians, Marauders, and Infidels'', [[Antonio Santosuosso]], Professor Emeritus of History at the [[University of Western Ontario]], and considered an expert historian in the era in dispute, puts forth an interesting modern opinion on Martel, Tours, and the subsequent campaigns against Rahman's son in 736-737. Santosuosso presents a compelling case that these later defeats of invading Muslim armies were at least as important as Tours in their defence of Western Christendom and the preservation of [[Christian monasticism#Western Monasticism|Western monasticism]], the monasteries of which were the centers of learning which ultimately led Europe out of her [[Middle Ages]]. He also makes a compelling argument, after studying the Arab histories of the period, that these were clearly armies of invasion, sent by the Caliph not just to avenge Tours, but to begin the conquest of Christian Europe and bring it into the Caliphate.

Further, unlike his father at Tours, Rahman's son in 736-737 knew that the Franks were a real power, and that Martel personally was a force to be reckoned with. He had no intention of allowing Martel to catch him unawares and dictate the time and place of battle, as his father had, and concentrated instead on seizing a substantial portion of the coastal plains around [[Narbonne]] in 736 and heavily reinforced [[Arles]] as he advanced inland. They planned from there to move from city to city, fortifying as they went, and if Martel wished to stop them from making a permanent enclave for expansion of the Caliphate, he would have to come to them, in the open, where, he, unlike his father, would dictate the place of battle. All worked as he had planned, until Martel arrived, albeit more swiftly than the Moors believed he could call up his entire army. Unfortunately for Rahman's son, however, he had overestimated the time it would take Martel to develop heavy cavalry equal to that of the Muslims. The Caliphate believed it would take a generation, but Martel managed it in five short years. Prepared to face the Frankish phalanx, the Muslims were totally unprepared to face a mixed force of heavy cavalry and infantry in a phalanx. Thus, Charles again championed Christianity and halted Muslim expansion into Europe, as the window was closing on Islamic ability to do so. These defeats, plus those at the hands of Leo in Anatolia, were the last great attempt at expansion by the Umayyad Caliphate before the destruction of the dynasty at the [[Battle of the Zab]], and the rending of the Caliphate forever, especially the utter destruction of the Umayyad army at River Berre near Narbonne in 737.

===Interregnum===
In 737, at the tail end of his campaigning in Provence and [[Septimania]], the king, Theuderic IV, died. Martel, titling himself ''maior domus'' and ''princeps et dux Francorum'', did not appoint a new king and nobody acclaimed one. The throne lay vacant until Martel's death. As the historian [[Charles Oman]] says (''The Dark Ages'', pg 297), &quot;he cared not for name or style so long as the real power was in his hands.&quot;

Gibbon has said Martel was &quot;content with the titles of Mayor or Duke of the Franks, but he deserved to become the father of a line of kings,&quot; which he did. Gibbon also says of him, &quot;in the public danger, he was summoned by the voice of his country.&quot;

The interregnum, the final four years of Charles' life, was more peaceful than most of it had been and much of his time was now spent on administrative and organisational plans to create a more efficient state. Though, in 738, he compelled the Saxons of [[Westphalia]] to do him homage and pay tribute, and in 739 checked an uprising in Provence, the rebels being under the leadership of Maurontus. Charles set about integrating the outlying realms of his empire into the Frankish church. He erected four dioceses in Bavaria ([[Bishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]], [[Diocese of Regensburg|Regensburg]], [[Bishopric of Freising|Freising]], and [[Diocese of Passau|Passau]]) and gave them Boniface as [[archbishop]] and [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] over all Germany east of the Rhine, with his seat at [[Mainz]]. Boniface had been under his protection from 723 on; indeed the saint himself explained to his old friend, Daniel of Winchester, that without it he could neither administer his church, defend his clergy, nor prevent idolatry. It was Boniface who had defended Charles most stoutly for his deeds in seizing ecclesiastical lands to pay his army in the days leading to Tours, as one doing what he must to defend Christianity. In 739, [[Pope Gregory III]] begged Charles for his aid against Liutprand, but Charles was loath to fight his onetime ally and ignored the Papal plea. Nonetheless, the Papal applications for Frankish protection showed how far Martel had come from the days he was tottering on excommunication, and set the stage for his son and grandson to rearrange Italian political boundaries to suit the Papacy, and protect it.

==Death==
[[File:Charles Martel Saint Denis.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Charles Martel, [[Basilique Saint-Denis]].]]
[[File:Tomb of Charles Martel, Basilica of St. Denis, St. Denis France.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Charles Martel, [[Basilique Saint-Denis]].]]
Charles Martel died on October 22, 741, at [[Quierzy-sur-Oise]] in what is today the [[Aisne]] ''[[Départements of France|département]]'' in the [[Picardy]] region of France. He was buried at [[Saint Denis Basilica]] in [[Paris]]. His territories were divided among his adult sons a year earlier: to [[Carloman, son of Charles Martel|Carloman]] he gave Austrasia and Alemannia (with Bavaria as a vassal), to [[Pippin the Younger]] Neustria and Burgundy (with Aquitaine as a vassal), and to [[Grifo]] nothing, though some sources indicate he intended to give him a strip of land between Neustria and Austrasia.

Gibbon called him &quot;the hero of the age&quot; and declared &quot;Christendom ... delivered ... by the genius and good fortune of one man, Charles Martel.&quot;

==Legacy==
At the beginning of Charles Martel's career, he had many internal opponents and felt the need to appoint his own kingly claimant, Clotaire IV. By his end, however, the dynamics of rulership in Francia had changed, no hallowed Meroving was needed, neither for defence nor legitimacy: Charles divided his realm between his sons without opposition (though he ignored his young son [[Bernhard, son of Charles Martel|Bernard]]). In between, he strengthened the Frankish state by consistently defeating, through superior generalship, the host of hostile foreign nations which beset it on all sides, including the non-Christian Saxons, which his grandson Charlemagne would fully subdue, and Moors, which he halted on a path of continental domination.

Though he never cared about titles, his son [[Pippin the Younger|Pippin]] did, and finally asked the [[Pope]] &quot;who should be King, he who has the title, or he who has the power?&quot; The Pope, highly dependent on Frankish armies for his independence from Lombard and [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] power (the [[Byzantine Emperor]] still considered himself to be the only legitimate &quot;[[Roman Emperor]]&quot;, and thus, ruler of all of the provinces of the [[Roman Empire|ancient empire]], whether recognised or not), declared for &quot;he who had the power&quot; and immediately crowned Pippin.

Decades later, in 800, Pippin's son [[Charlemagne]] was crowned emperor by the Pope, further extending the principle by delegitimising the nominal authority of the Byzantine Emperor in the Italian peninsula (which had, by then, shrunk to encompass little more than [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]] at best) and ancient Roman Gaul, including the Iberian outposts Charlemagne had established in the ''[[Marca Hispanica]]'' across the [[Pyrenees]], what today forms [[Catalonia]]. In short, though the Byzantine Emperor claimed authority over all the old [[Roman Empire]], as the legitimate &quot;Roman&quot; Emperor, it was simply not reality. The bulk of the [[Western Roman Empire]] had come under Carolingian rule, the Byzantine Emperor having had almost no authority in the West since the sixth century, though Charlemagne, a consummate politician, preferred to avoid an open breach with Constantinople. An institution unique in history was being born: the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Though the sardonic [[Voltaire]] ridiculed its nomenclature, saying that the Holy Roman Empire was &quot;neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire,&quot; it constituted an enormous political power for a time, especially under the [[Saxon Dynasty|Saxon]] and [[Salian Dynasty|Salian dynasties]] and, to a lesser, extent, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]]. It lasted until 1806, by which time it was a nonentity. Though his grandson became its first emperor, the &quot;empire&quot; such as it was, was largely born during the reign of Charles Martel.

Charles was that rarest of commodities in the Middle Ages: a brilliant strategic general, who also was a tactical commander ''par excellence'', able in the heat of battle to adapt his plans to his foe's forces and movement &amp;mdash; and amazingly, to defeat them repeatedly, especially when, as at Tours, they were far superior in men and weaponry, and at Berre and Narbonne, when they were superior in numbers of fighting men. Charles had the last quality which defines genuine greatness in a military commander: he foresaw the dangers of his foes, and prepared for them with care; he used ground, time, place, and fierce loyalty of his troops to offset his foe's superior weaponry and tactics; third, he adapted, again and again, to the enemy on the battlefield, shifting to compensate for the unforeseen and unforeseeable.

Gibbon, whose tribute to Martel has been noted, was not alone among the great mid era historians in fervently praising Martel; Thomas Arnold ranks the victory of Charles Martel even higher than the victory of [[Arminius]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in its impact on all of modern history:

{{quote|Charles Martel's victory at Tours was among those signal deliverances which have affected for centuries the happiness of mankind.|History of the later Roman Commonwealth, vol ii. p. 317.}}

German historians are especially ardent in their praise of Martel and in their belief that he saved Europe and Christianity from then all-conquering Islam, praising him also for driving back the ferocious Saxon barbarians on his borders. Schlegel speaks of this &quot;mighty victory&quot; in terms of fervent gratitude, and tells how &quot; the arm of Charles Martel saved and delivered the Christian nations of the West from the deadly grasp of all-destroying Islam&quot;, and Ranke points out,
{{quote|as one of the most important epochs in the history of the world, the commencement of the eighth century, when on the one side Mohammedanism threatened to overspread Italy and Gaul, and on the other the ancient idolatry of Saxony and Friesland once more forced its way across the Rhine. In this peril of Christian institutions, a youthful prince of Germanic race, Karl Martell, arose as their champion, maintained them with all the energy which the necessity for self-defence calls forth, and finally extended them into new regions.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}}}

In 1922 and 1923, Belgian historian [[Henri Pirenne]] published a series of papers, known collectively as the &quot;Pirenne Thesis&quot;, which remain influential to this day. Pirenne held that the Roman Empire continued, in the Frankish realms, up until the time of the [[History of Islam|Arab conquests]] in the 7th century. These conquests disrupted Mediterranean trade routes leading to a decline in the European economy. Such continued disruption would have meant complete disaster except for Charles Martel's halting of Islamic expansion into Europe from 732 on. What he managed to preserve led to the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], named after him.

Professor Santosuosso&lt;ref name= Santosuosso&gt;Santosuosso, Antonio. ''Barbarians, Marauders, and Infidels''&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps sums up Martel best when he talks about his coming to the rescue of his Christian allies in Provence, and driving the Muslims back into the Iberian Peninsula forever in the mid and late 730s:
{{quote|After assembling forces at Saragossa the Muslims entered French territory in 735, crossed the River Rhone and captured and looted Arles. From there they struck into the heart of Provence, ending with the capture of Avignon, despite strong resistance. Islamic forces remained in French territory for about four years, carrying raids to Lyon, Burgundy, and Piedmont. Again Charles Martel came to the rescue, reconquering most of the lost territories in two campaigns in 736 and 739, except for the city of Narbonne, which finally fell in 759. The second (Muslim) expedition was probably more dangerous than the first to Poitiers. Yet its failure (at Martel's hands) put an end to any serious Muslim expedition across the Pyrenees (forever).{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}}}

In the Netherlands, a vital part of the Carolingian Empire, and elsewhere in the [[Low Countries]], he is considered a hero. In France and Germany, he is revered as a hero of epic proportions.

Skilled as an administrator and ruler, Martel organized what would become the medieval European government: a system of fiefdoms, loyal to barons, counts, dukes and ultimately the King, or in his case, simply ''maior domus'' and ''princeps et dux Francorum''. (&quot;First or Dominant Mayor and Prince of the Franks&quot;) His close coordination of church with state began the medieval pattern for such government. He created what would become the first western standing army since the fall of Rome by his maintaining a core of loyal veterans around which he organized the normal feudal levies. In essence, he changed Europe from a horde of barbarians fighting with one another, to an organized state.

===Beginning of the ''Reconquista''===
Although it took another two decades for the Franks to drive all the Arab garrisons out of [[Septimania]] and across the [[Pyrenees]], Charles Martel's halt of the invasion of French soil turned the tide of Islamic advances, and the unification of the Frankish kingdoms under Martel, his son Pippin the Younger, and his grandson Charlemagne created a western power which prevented the Emirate of Córdoba from expanding over the Pyrenees. Martel, who in 732 was on the verge of excommunication, instead was recognised by the Church as its paramount defender. [[Pope Gregory II]] wrote him more than once, asking his protection and aid,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/g2-martellet.html Medieval Sourcebook: Pope Gregory II - Appeal to Charles Martel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and he remained, till his death, fixated on stopping the Muslims.

Martel's son [[Pippin the Younger]] kept his father's promise and returned and took Narbonne by siege in 759. His grandson, [[Charlemagne]], actually established the ''[[Marca Hispanica]]'' across the Pyrenees in part of what today is Catalonia, reconquering [[Girona]] in 785 and [[Barcelona]] in 801. Carolingians called this region of modern-day Spain &quot;The Moorish Marches&quot;, and saw it as more than a simple check on the Muslims in Hispania.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} It formed a permanent buffer zone against Islam and became the basis, along with the efforts of [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelayo]] (Latin: Pelagius) and his descendants, for the [[Reconquista]].

==Military legacy==
===Heavy infantry and permanent army===
[[Victor Davis Hanson]] argues that Charles Martel launched &quot;the thousand year struggle&quot; between [[Europe]]an [[heavy infantry]] and [[Muslim]] [[cavalry]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 2001, p. 141-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, Martel is also the father of heavy cavalry in Europe, as he integrated heavy armoured cavalry into his forces. This creation of a real army would continue all through his reign, and that of his son, Pepin the Short, until his Grandson, Charlemagne, would possess the world's largest and finest army since the peak of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Bennett, Michael. ''Fighting Techniques of the Medieval World''&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, the Muslims used infantry - indeed, at the Battle of Toulouse most of their forces were light infantry. It was not till Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi brought a huge force of Arab and Berber cavalry with him when he assumed the emirate of Al-Andulus that the Muslim forces became primarily cavalry.

Martel's army was known primarily for being the first standing permanent army since Rome's fall in 476, &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt; and for the core of tough, seasoned heavy infantry who stood so stoutly at Tours. The Frankish infantry wore as much as 70 pounds of armour, including their heavy wooden shields with an iron boss. Standing close together, and well disciplined, they were unbreakable at Tours.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 2001, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Martel had taken the money and property he had seized from the church and paid local nobles to supply trained ready infantry year round. This was the core of veterans who served with him on a permanent basis, and as Hanson says, &quot;provided a steady supply of dependable troops year around.&quot;  While other Germanic cultures, such as the Visigoths or Vandals, had a proud martial tradition, and the Franks themselves had an annual muster of military aged men, such tribes were only able to field armies around planting and harvest. It was Martel's creation of a system whereby he could call on troops year round that gave the Carolingians the first standing and permanent army since Rome's fall in the west.

And, first and foremost, Charles Martel will always be remembered for his victory at Tours. Creasy argues that the Martel victory &quot;preserved the relics of ancient and the germs of modern civilizations.&quot; Gibbon called those eight days in 732, the week leading up to Tours, and the battle itself, &quot;the events that rescued our ancestors of Britain, and our neighbors of Gaul [France], from the civil and religious yoke of the Koran.&quot; Paul Akers, in his editorial on Charles Martel, says for those who value life and freedom &quot;you might spare a minute sometime today, and every October, to say a silent 'thank you' to a gang of half-savage Germans and especially to their leader, Charles 'The Hammer' Martel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2005/102005/10302005/141401/index_html Fredericksburg.com - Why Islam didn't conquer the world I vs. From the plains of medieval France to the modern Mideast, militant Muslims test Christians and Jews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his vision of what would be necessary for him to withstand a larger force and superior technology (the Muslim horsemen had adopted the armour and accoutrements of heavy cavalry from the Sassanid Warrior Class, which made the first knights possible), he, daring not to send his few horsemen against the Islamic cavalry, used his army to fight in a formation used by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] to withstand superior numbers and weapons by discipline, courage, and a willingness to die for their cause: a phalanx. He had trained a core of his men year round, using mostly Church funds, and some had been with him since his earliest days after his father's death. It was this hard core of disciplined veterans that won the day for him at Tours. Hanson emphasizes that Martel's greatest accomplishment as a General may have been his ability to keep his troops under control. This absolute iron discipline saved his infantry from the fate of so many infantrymen - such as the Saxons at Hastings - who broke formation and were slaughtered piecemeal. After using this infantry force by itself at Tours, he studied the foe's forces and further adapted to them, initially using stirrups and saddles recovered from the foe's dead horses, and armour from the dead horsemen.

The defeats Martel inflicted on the Muslims were vital in that the split in the Islamic world left the [[Caliphate]] unable to mount an all out attack on Europe via its Iberian stronghold after 750. His ability to meet this challenge, until the Muslims self-destructed, is considered by most historians to be of [[macrohistorical]] importance, and is why [[Dante]] writes of him in Heaven as one of the &quot;Defenders of the Faith.&quot; 

[[H. G. Wells]] says of Charles Martel's decisive defeat of the Muslims in his &quot;Short History of the World:
{{quote|The Muslim when they crossed the Pyrenees in 720 found this Frankish kingdom under the practical rule of Charles Martel, the Mayor of the Palace of a degenerate descendant of Clovis, and experienced the decisive defeat of Poitiers (732) at his hands. This Charles Martel was practically overlord of Europe north of the Alps from the Pyrenees to Hungary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/86/45.html 45. The Development of Latin Christendom. Wells, H.G. 1922. A Short History of the World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[John H. Haaren]] says in “''Famous Men of the Middle Ages''”
{{quote|The battle of Tours, or Poitiers, as it should be called, is regarded as one of the decisive battles of the world. It decided that Christians, and not Moslems, should be the ruling power in Europe. Charles Martel is especially celebrated as the hero of this battle.}}

Just as his grandson, Charlemagne, would become famous for his swift and unexpected movements in his campaigns, Charles was legendary for never doing what his enemies forecast he would do. It was this ability to do the unforeseen, and move far faster than his opponents believed he could, that characterized the military career of Charles Martel.

It is notable that the Northmen did not begin their European raids until after the death of Martel's grandson, Charlemagne. They had the naval capacity to begin those raids at least three generations earlier, but chose not to challenge Martel, his son Pippin, or his grandson, Charlemagne. This was probably fortunate for Martel, who despite his enormous gifts, would probably not have been able to repel the Vikings in addition to the Muslims, Saxons, and everyone else he defeated. However, it is notable that again, despite the ability to do so, (the Danes had constructed defenses to defend from counterattacks by land, and had the ability to launch their wholesale sea raids as early as Martel's reign), they chose not to challenge Charles Martel.

==Conclusion==
J.M. Roberts says of Charles Martel in his note on the Carolingians on page 315 of his 1993 ''History of the World'':
::It (the Carolingian line) produced Charles Martel, the soldier who turned the Arabs back at Tours, and the supporter of Saint Boniface, the Evangelizer of Germany. This is a considerable double mark to have left on the history of Europe.&quot;

Gibbon perhaps summarized Charles Martel's legacy most eloquently: &quot;in a laborious administration of 24 years he had restored and supported the dignity of the throne..by the activity of a warrior who in the same campaign could display his banner on the Elbe, the Rhone, and shores of the ocean.&quot;

==Family and children==
Charles Martel married twice:

His first wife was [[Rotrude of Treves]], (690–724) (daughter of [[Leudwinus]], Bishop of [[Trier]]). They had the following children:
*[[Hiltrud]] (d. 754), married [[Odilo of Bavaria|Odilo I]], [[Duke of Bavaria]]
*[[Carolman, son of Charles Martel|Carloman]]
* Landrade (Landres), married [[Sigrand, Count of Hesbania]]
* Auda, Aldana, or Alane, married [[Thierry IV|Thierry IV, Count of Autun and Toulouse]]
*[[Pepin the Short]]

His second wife was [[Swanachild|Swanhild]]. They had the following child:
*[[Grifo]]

Charles Martel also had a mistress, [[Ruodhaid]]. They had the following children:
*[[Bernhard, son of Charles Martel|Bernard]] (b. before 732–787)
*[[Hieronymus, son of Charles Martel|Hieronymus]]
*[[Remigius of Rouen|Remigius]], [[archbishop of Rouen]] (d. 771)

Colonel '''Charles Edward''' (&quot;'''Chuck'''&quot;) '''Jones''' (November 4, 1952 &amp;ndash; September 11, 2001) was a United States Air Force officer, a [[computer programmer]], and an astronaut in the USAF [[Manned Spaceflight Engineer Program]].

==Biography==
Jones was born in [[Clinton, Indiana|Clinton]], [[Indiana]].  He graduated from [[Wichita High School East]] in 1970 and earned a bachelor of science in astronautical engineering from the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in 1974. He entered the USAF Manned Spaceflight Engineer program in 1982, and was scheduled to fly on mission [[Cancelled Shuttle missions|STS-71-B]] in December 1986, but the mission was cancelled after the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'' Disaster]] in January 1986. He left the Manned Spaceflight Engineer program in 1987.

He was killed at the age of 48 in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|attacks of September 11, 2001]], aboard [[American Airlines Flight 11]]. He had been living as a retired [[US Air Force]] Colonel in [[Bedford, Massachusetts|Bedford]], [[Massachusetts]], at the time of his death. He was survived by his wife Jeanette.

[[File:Bridge from dental porcelain.jpg|thumb|right|Fixed partial [[denture]], or &quot;bridge&quot;]]

A '''ceramic''' is an [[inorganic]], [[nonmetal|nonmetallic]] [[solid]] prepared by the action of [[heat]] and subsequent cooling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctioa.org/index.cfm?pi=GL&amp;gaction=list&amp;grp=C Ceramic Tile and Stone Standards]&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramic materials may have a [[crystalline]] or partly crystalline structure, or may be [[amorphous]] (e.g., a [[glass]]). Because most common ceramics are crystalline, the definition of ceramic is often restricted to inorganic crystalline materials, as opposed to the noncrystalline glasses.

The earliest ceramics were [[pottery]] objects made from [[clay]], either by itself or mixed with other materials, hardened in fire. Later ceramics were glazed and fired to create a colored, smooth surface. Ceramics now include domestic, industrial and building products and [[ceramic art|art objects]]. In the 20th century, new [[ceramic materials]] were developed for use in advanced [[ceramic engineering]]; for example, in [[semiconductor]]s. 

The word &quot;ceramic&quot; comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word κεραμικός (''keramikos''), &quot;of pottery&quot; or &quot;for pottery&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkeramiko%2Fs κεραμικός], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; from κέραμος (''keramos''), &quot;potter's clay, tile, pottery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dke%2Framos κέραμος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest mention on the root &quot;ceram-&quot; is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''ke-ra-me-we'', &quot;workers of ceramics&quot;, written in [[Linear b]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=383 Palaeolexicon], Word study tool of ancient languages&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Ceramic&quot; may be used as an adjective describing a material, product or process; or as a singular noun, or, more commonly, as a plural noun, &quot;ceramics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of ceramic products==
For convenience, ceramic products are usually divided into four sectors; these are shown below with some examples:
*'''Structural''', including [[brick]]s, [[pipe (material)|pipe]]s, [[Flooring|floor]] and [[roof tile]]s
*'''[[refractory|Refractories]]''', such as [[kiln]] linings, gas fire radiants, [[steel]] and glass making crucibles
*'''Whitewares''', including [[tableware]], wall tiles, pottery products and sanitary ware
*'''Technical''', is also known as engineering, advanced, special, and in Japan, fine ceramics. Such items include tiles used in the [[Space Shuttle program]], gas burner [[nozzle]]s, [[Ballistic vest|ballistic protection]], [[nuclear fuel]] uranium oxide pellets, [[Implant (medicine)|biomedical implants]], coatings of [[jet engine]] [[turbine]] blades, [[missile]] nose cones, [[bearing (mechanical)]]. Frequently, the raw materials do not include clays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newi.ac.uk/buckleyc/ceramics.htm ''Introduction To Ceramics, American Ceramic Society'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of whiteware ceramics===
*[[Earthenware]], which is often made from clay, [[quartz]] and [[feldspar]].
*[[Stoneware]]
*[[Porcelain]], which is often made from [[kaolin]]
*[[Bone china]]

===Classification of technical ceramics===
Technical ceramics can also be classified into three distinct material categories: 
* [[Oxide]]s: [[alumina]], [[beryllia]], [[ceria]], [[zirconia]]
* Nonoxides: [[carbide]], [[boride]], [[nitride]], [[silicide]]
* [[Composite material]]s: particulate reinforced, [[Ceramic Matrix Composite|fiber reinforced]], combinations of [[oxide]]s and nonoxides.

Each one of these classes can develop unique material properties because ceramics tend to be crystalline.

==Other applications of ceramics==
*Knife blades: the blade of a [[ceramic knife]] will stay sharp for much longer than that of a steel knife, although it is more brittle and can be snapped by dropping it on a hard surface.

*Vehicle [[Disc brake|ceramic brake discs]] are resistant to abrasion at high temperatures.

*Advanced [[Composite_armour|composite ceramic and metal matrices]] have been designed for most modern [[armoured fighting vehicles]] because they offer superior penetrating resistance against [[Shaped_charge|shaped charges]] such as [[High_explosive_anti-tank|high explosive antitank]] (HEAT) rounds and [[Kinetic_energy_penetrator|kinetic energy penetrators]].

*Ceramics such as [[alumina]] and [[boron carbide]] have been used in [[bulletproof vest|ballistic armored vests]] to repel large-calibre [[rifle]] fire. Such plates are known commonly as small arms protective inserts (SAPIs). Similar material is used to protect [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpits]] of some military airplanes, because of the low weight of the material.

*Ceramic balls can be used to replace steel in [[ball bearings]]. Their higher hardness means they are much less susceptible to wear and can offer more than triple lifetimes. They also deform less under load, meaning they have less contact with the bearing retainer walls and can roll faster. In very high speed applications, heat from [[friction]] during rolling can cause problems for metal bearings, which are reduced by the use of ceramics. Ceramics are also more chemically resistant and can be used in wet environments where steel bearings would rust. In some cases, their electricity-insulating properties may also be valuable in bearings. The two major drawbacks to using ceramics are a significantly higher cost and susceptibility to damage under shock loads. 

*In the early 1980s, [[Toyota]] researched production of an [[adiabatic]] [[internal combustion engine|engine]] using ceramic components in the hot gas area. The ceramics would have allowed temperatures of over 3000°F (1650°C). The expected advantages would have lighter materials, no or reduced cooling system, and hence a major weight reduction. The expected increase of [[fuel efficiency]] of the engine (caused by the higher temperature, as shown by [[Carnot heat engine|Carnot's]] theorem) could not be verified experimentally; it was found that the heat transfer on the hot ceramic cylinder walls is higher than the transfer to a cooler metal wall. Obviously the cooler gas film on the metal surface works as a [[thermal insulator]]. Thus, despite all of these desirable properties, such engines have not succeeded in production because of costs for the ceramic components and the limited advantages. (Small imperfections in the ceramic material with its low [[fracture toughness]] lead to cracks, which can lead to potentially dangerous equipment failure.) Such engines are possible in laboratory settings, but mass production is not feasible with current technology. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009|reason=Where are any other references to Toyota's work?}}

*Work is being done in developing ceramic parts for [[gas turbine]] [[heat engine|engines]]. Currently, even blades made of [[superalloy|advanced metal alloys]] used in the engines' hot section require cooling and careful limiting of operating temperatures. Turbine engines made with ceramics could operate more efficiently, giving aircraft greater range and payload for a set amount of fuel.

*Recent advances have been made in ceramics which include bioceramics, such as dental implants and synthetic bones. [[Hydroxyapatite]], the natural mineral component of bone, has been made synthetically from a number of biological and chemical sources and can be formed into ceramic materials. Orthopedic implants coated with these materials bond readily to bone and other tissues in the body without rejection or inflammatory reactions so are of great interest for gene delivery and [[tissue engineering]] scaffolds. Most hydroxyapatite ceramics are very porous and lack mechanical strength, and are used to coat metal orthopedic devices to aid in forming a bond to bone or as bone fillers. They are also used as fillers for orthopedic plastic screws to aid in reducing the inflammation and increase absorption of these plastic materials. Work is being done to make strong, fully dense nano crystalline hydroxyapatite ceramic materials for orthopedic weight bearing devices, replacing foreign metal and plastic orthopedic materials with a synthetic, but naturally occurring, bone mineral. Ultimately, these ceramic materials may be used as bone replacements or with the incorporation of protein collagens, synthetic bones.

*High-tech ceramic is used in watchmaking for producing watch cases. The material is valued by watchmakers for its light weight, scratch resistance, durability and smooth touch. [[IWC]] is one of the brands that initiated the use of ceramic in watchmaking. The case of the IWC 2007 Top Gun edition of the Pilot's Watch [[double chronograph]] is crafted in black ceramic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://watches.infoniac.com/index.php?page=post&amp;id=62 Ceramic in Watchmaking]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of ceramic materials==
[[Image:Ceramic fractured SEM.TIF|right|thumb|A low magnification [[Scanning Electron Microscope|SEM micrograph]] of an advanced ceramic material, the properties of ceramics make fracturing an important inspection method.]]

A ceramic material is often understood as restricted to inorganic &quot;crystalline&quot; oxide material. It is solid and inert. Ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression, weak in [[shear stress|shearing]] and tension. They withstand chemical erosion that occurs in other materials subjected to acidic or caustic environments. Ceramics generally can withstand very high temperatures, such as temperatures that range from 1,000 °C to 1,600 °C (1,800 °F to 3,000 °F). Exceptions include inorganic materials that do not include oxygen, such as [[silicon carbide]] or [[silicon nitride]]. A [[glass]] is often not understood as a ceramic because of its [[amorphous]] (noncrystalline) character. However, glass making involves several steps of the ceramic process and its mechanical properties are similar to ceramic materials.

Traditional ceramic raw materials include clay minerals such as kaolinite, whereas more recent materials include aluminium oxide, more commonly known as alumina. The modern ceramic materials, which are classified as advanced ceramics, include silicon carbide and [[tungsten carbide]]. Both are valued for their abrasion resistance, and hence find use in applications such as the wear plates of crushing equipment in mining operations. Advanced ceramics are also used in the medicine, electrical and electronics industries.

===Crystalline ceramics===
Crystalline ceramic materials are not amenable to a great range of processing. Methods for dealing with them tend to fall into one of two categories – either make the ceramic in the desired shape, by reaction ''in situ'', or by &quot;forming&quot; powders into the desired shape, and then [[sintering]] to form a solid body. [[Ceramic forming techniques]] include shaping by hand (sometimes including a rotation process called &quot;throwing&quot;), [[Slipcasting|slip casting]], [[tape casting]] (used for making very thin ceramic capacitors, e.g.), [[injection molding]], dry pressing, and other variations. Details of these processes are described in the two books listed below. A few methods use a hybrid between the two approaches.

===Noncrystalline ceramics===
Noncrystalline ceramics, being [[glass]]es, tend to be formed from melts. The glass is shaped when either fully molten, by casting, or when in a state of toffee-like viscosity, by methods such as blowing to a mold. If later heat treatments cause this glass to become partly crystalline, the resulting material is known as a [[glass-ceramic]], widely used as [[cooktop]].

The '''Wu Xing''', or the '''Five Movements''', '''Five Phases''' or '''Five Steps/Stages''', are chiefly an ancient mnemonic device, in many traditional Chinese fields.

It is sometimes translated as '''Five Elements''', but the Wu Xing are chiefly an ancient mnemonic device, hence the preferred translation of &quot;movements&quot;, &quot;phases&quot; or &quot;steps&quot; over &quot;elements&quot;. By the same token, ''Mu'' is thought of as &quot;Tree&quot; rather than &quot;Wood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite media
|title      = 千古中医之张仲景. Wood and Metal were often replaced with air
|publisher  = [[Lecture Room]], CCTV-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five elements are:
*[[Tree (Wu Xing)|Wood]]  (Chinese: [[wiktionary:木|木]], pinyin: mù)
*[[Fire (Wu Xing)|Fire]]  (Chinese: [[wiktionary:火|火]], pinyin: huǒ)
*[[Earth (Wu Xing)|Earth]] (Chinese: [[wiktionary:土|土]], pinyin: tǔ)
*[[Metal (Wu Xing)|Metal]] (Chinese: [[wiktionary:金|金]], pinyin: jīn)
*[[Water (Wu Xing)|Water]] (Chinese: [[wiktionary:水|水]], pinyin: shuǐ)

The system of five phases was used for describing interactions and relationships between phenomena. It was employed as a device in many fields of early Chinese thought, including seemingly disparate fields such as geomancy or [[Feng shui]], [[Chinese astrology|astrology]], [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[music]], [[military strategy]] and [[martial arts]].

The system is still used as a reference in some forms of [[complementary and alternative medicine]] and martial arts.  Some{{Who|date=November 2010}} claim the original foundation of these are the concept of the [[Cardinal direction#Far East|Five Cardinal Points]].

==Cycles==
[[File:Wuxing en.svg|thumb|right|The Interactions of Wu Xing: The creation cycle (black, circle shaped arrows) and the overcoming cycle (white, star shaped arrows).]]
The doctrine of five phases describes two cycles, a generating or creation (生, ''shēng'') cycle, also known as &quot;mother-son&quot;, and an overcoming or destruction (剋/克, ''kè'') cycle, also known as &quot;grandfather-nephew&quot;, of interactions between the phases.

===Generating===

The common memory jogs, which help to remind in what order the phases are:

*Wood feeds Fire;
*Fire creates Earth (ash);
*Earth bears Metal;
*Metal carries Water (as in a bucket or tap, or water condenses on metal);
*Water nourishes Wood.

Also:

*Wood absorbs Water;
*Water rusts Metal;
*Metal breaks up Earth;
*Earth smothers Fire;
*Fire burns wood.

Other common words for this cycle include &quot;begets&quot;, &quot;engenders&quot; and &quot;mothers.&quot;

===Overcoming===

*Wood parts Earth (such as roots; or, Trees can prevent soil erosion);
*Earth absorbs  (or muddies) Water (or Earth dam control the water);
*Water quenches Fire;
*Fire melts Metal;
*Metal chops Wood.

This cycle might also be called &quot;controls&quot;, &quot;restrains&quot; or &quot;fathers&quot;.

==Cosmology and ''feng shui''==
[[File:FiveElementsCycleBalanceImbalance.jpg|thumb|right|Another illustration of the cycle.]]
:''Main article: [[Feng shui|Feng Shui]]
According to Wu Xing theory, the structure of the cosmos mirrors the five phases. Each phase has a complex series of associations with different aspects of nature, as can be seen in the following table. In the ancient Chinese form of [[geomancy]] known as Feng Shui practitioners all based their art and system on the five phases (Wu Xing). All of these phases are represented within the Ba gua.  Associated with these phases are colors, seasons and shapes; all of which are interacting with each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northernshaolinacademy.com/new/docs/FiveElementsChart.xls Chinese Five Elements Chart] Information on the Chinese Five Elements from Northern Shaolin Academy in Microsoft Excel 2003 Format&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on a particular directional energy flow from one phase to the next, the interaction can be expansive, destructive, or exhaustive.  With proper knowledge of such aspect of energy flow will enable the Feng Shui practitioner to apply certain cures or rearrangement of energy in a way they believe to be beneficial for the receiver of the Feng Shui &quot;Treatment.&quot;

==Chinese medicine==

[[File:FiveElementsDiurnalCycle.jpg|thumb|right|Five Chinese Elements - Diurnal Cycle]]
{{Main|Traditional Chinese medicine}}
The interdependence of [[Zang Fu]] networks in the body was noted to be a circle of five things, and so mapped by the Chinese doctors onto the five phases.  For instance, the Liver (Wood phase) is said to be the &quot;mother&quot; of the heart (Fire phase), and the Kidneys (Water phase) the mother of the Liver.  The key observation was things like kidney deficiency affecting the function of the liver.  In this case, the &quot;mother&quot; is weak, and cannot support the child.  However, the Kidneys control the heart along the Ke cycle, so the Kidneys are said to restrain the heart.  Many of these interactions can nowadays be linked to Western physiological pathways (such as Kidney pH affecting heart activity).{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}

The key thing to keep in mind with the Chinese medical application of the five elements is that it is only a model, and it is known to have exceptions.

The citation order of the Five Phases, i.e., the order in which they are cited in the Bo Hu Tong and other Han dynasty texts, is Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. The organs are most effectively treated, according to theory, in the following four-hour periods throughout the day, beginning with the 3 a.m. to 7 a. m. period:  Metal organs (see the list below), Earth organs, Fire&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; organs, Water organs, Fire&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the &quot;non-empirical&quot; Pericardium and Triple Burner organs), and Wood organs, which is the reverse  of the citation order (plus an extra use of Fire and the non-empirical organs to take care of the sixth four-hour period of the day).  These two orders are further related to the sequence of the planets going outward from the sun (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, or Water, Metal, Fire, Wood, and Earth) by a star diagram similar to the one shown above.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.wfu.edu/~moran/z_GIF_images/5_xing_citation_order.gif  5 Xing in Citation Order].&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence of the five elements (Traditional Chinese medicine)：promotion, inhibition, Cheng (bullying), Wu (insult).

(Notes:
*The Chinese word 青 ''qīng'', has many meanings, including green, [[Azure (color)|azure]], [[cyan]], and black. It refers to green in Wu Xing.
*In most modern music, various seven note or five note scales (e.g., the major scale) are defined by selecting seven or five frequencies from the set of twelve semi-tones in the [[Equal tempered]] tuning. The Chinese &quot;lǜ&quot; tuning is closest to the ancient Greek tuning of Pythagoras. See [[Chinese musicology]].)

==Martial arts==
===Taijiquan===
{{Main|Tai chi chuan}}
Taijiquan uses the five elements to designate different directions, positions or footwork patterns. Either forward, backward, left, right and centre, or three steps forward (attack) and two steps back (retreat).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wu|first=Kung-tsao|title=Wu Family T'ai Chi Ch'uan (吳家太極拳)|publisher=Chien-ch’uan T’ai-chi Ch’uan Association|date=1980, 2006|isbn=0-9780499-0-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Five Steps (五步 wǔ bù):'''
:'''Chin Pu''' (進步 jìn bù) - Forward step.
:'''T'ui Pu''' (退步 tùi bù) - Backward step.
:'''Tsuo Ku''' (左顧 (simpl.: 左顾) zǔo gù) - Left step.
:'''You P'an''' (右盼 yòu pàn) - Right step.
:'''Chung Ting''' (中定 zhōng dìng) - The central position, balance, equilibrium.

===Xingyiquan===
{{Main|Xingyiquan}}
Xingyiquan uses the five elements to metaphorically represent five different states of combat.

==Tea site==
There are spring, summer, fall, and winter teas. [[Perennial Tea Ceremony]] (Perennial, literally means four steps or sequences that are linked together and each one represents a season of the year). The tea ceremony includes four tea settings(茶席) and a tea master(司茶), below are the four settings:

:earth, center incense, yellow, up and down
:wood,  春風(Spring Wind), green, east
:fire,  夏露(Summer Dew), red, south
:metal, 秋籟(Fall Sounds), white, west
:water, 冬陽(Winter Sunshine) black, north

Each tea setting is arranged and stands for the four directions (north, south, east, and west). A vase of the seasons flowers are put on tea table. Some times if four tea masters are include then five chairs are arranged per each tea setting, making a total of twenty plus the 4 tea masters equalling 24, which symbolizes the 24 solar terms of the Chinese calendar, and represents that nature continues or is perennial.

The '''Church of Christ, Scientist''' was founded in 1879 in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States|USA]], by [[Mary Baker Eddy]]. She was the author of the book ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]].'' [[Christian Science]] teaches that the &quot;allness&quot; of God denies the reality of sin, sickness, death, and the material world. Accounts of healing through prayer are common within the church and adherents traditionally refuse medical treatment. The church, headquartered in Boston, has a worldwide membership of about 85,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/cr_sci.htm The Church Of Christ, Scientist (Christian Science)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The church was founded by [[Mary Baker Eddy]] in 1879 following a personal [[healing]] in 1866, which she claimed resulted from reading the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2006-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She called this experience &quot;[[Isaac Newton#Newton's apple|the falling apple]]&quot; that led to her discovery of Christian Science. She was convinced that: &quot;The divine [[Holy Spirit|Spirit]] had wrought the miracle&amp;nbsp;— a miracle which later I found to be in perfect scientific accord with divine law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Prose Works other than Science and Health|Ret 24]]&lt;/ref&gt; She spent the next three years investigating the law of [[God]] according to the Bible, especially in the words and works of [[Jesus]]. The Bible and Eddy's textbook on Christian healing, ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]]'', are together the church's key [[doctrine|doctrinal]] sources and have been ordained as the church's &quot;dual impersonal [[pastor]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Baker Eddy. ''Manual of the Mother Church,'' 89th Edition, page 58, Article XV &quot;The Christian Science Pastor&quot; Ordination. Section 1. First copyrighted 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Church of Christ, Scientist, is widely known for its publications, especially ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', a [[Day|daily]] [[newspaper]] published internationally in print and on the [[Internet]]. [[Skeptics]] consider the religion to be controversial due to adherents' reliance on [[healing]] through [[prayer]] and their rejection of [[modern medicine|medicine]]. There have also been periodic tensions with both mainstream and fundamentalist [[Christian]]s, who think the religion is aligned with [[Gnosticism]] or is a cult, and fault it for departing from traditional Christian doctrine. Of particular issue is the deity of Jesus, which Christian Science denies; and a view that Christian Science does teach, that God is not the creator of finite (material) existence and its concomitant suffering, sin and death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gottschalk Resuming&quot;&gt;Stephen Gottschalk.

The Church of Christ, Scientist is sometimes confused with the [[Church of Scientology]], an unrelated organization founded about 75 years after Christian Science. It is also sometimes confused with [[Religious Science]], a recent denomination in line with the [[New Thought]] tradition.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

The seal of Christian Science is a [[cross and crown]] with the words, &quot;Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons,&quot; and is a registered trademark of the church.

==Theology and healing==
===Origins and early development===
In February 1866, [[Mary Baker Eddy]] (known at the time as Mary Glover) was healed of an injury &quot;that neither medicine nor surgery could reach...&quot; (Ret 24:12)&lt;!-- Source: http://www.marybakereddylibrary.org/marybakereddy/retrospection.jhtml?reference=ret%2024&amp;marks=false --&gt;. According to her personal accounts, when she appeared to be near death, she called out for her Bible. She turned it to [[Book of Matthew|Matthew]] 9:2, which tells the story of Jesus healing a man who was sick with [[palsy]], and after pondering the meaning of the passage, found herself suddenly well and able to get up. In her autobiography, ''Retrospection and Introspection,'' she wrote:
::''Even to the homeopathic physician who attended me, and rejoiced in my recovery, I could not then explain the ''modus'' of my relief. I could only assure him that the divine Spirit had wrought the miracle—a miracle which later I found to be in perfect scientific accord with divine law.'' (Retrospection and Introspection, page 24)

She referred to this event as her &quot;Great Discovery&quot;, the &quot;falling apple&quot; that led to her &quot;discovery how to be well&quot; herself (ibid.) (Later, she gave it the name of &quot;[[Christian Science]]&quot; stating that she &quot;...named it ''Christian'', because it is compassionate, helpful, and spiritual.&quot; (ibid).) Not knowing how it had occurred, she spent the next three years studying the Bible, experimenting and [[prayer|praying]] to discover if the experience was repeatable and if there were knowable laws that governed it. She claimed that she was able to heal others and began to be called out to the bedsides of those whom the medical faculty had not been able to help. A [[physician|doctor]] attending a severe case in [[New Hampshire]] is said to have witnessed her healing one of his patients and asked if she could explain her system. At the time, she said only that [[God]] did it. But he urged her to write about it and soon she began her main work explaining her system of Christian healing, ''Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures''.

Soon others began to ask her to teach her healing method and she claimed that her students were able to approximate her ability to heal. The readers of her book gathered into an organization and gradually developed into a church, with Mary Baker Eddy as its [[pastor]].

===Theology===
In ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]]'', Eddy argues that given the absolute goodness and perfection of [[God]], sin, disease, and death were not created by Him, and therefore cannot be truly real. She bases this reading on Genesis 1, calling that the true record of creation in contrast to Genesis 2, the false record of creation obscuring the true (which occurred when &quot;a mist went up from the face of the ground&quot;). Rather than being [[ontology|ontologically]] real, in Christian Science evil and its manifestations are instead terrible lies about God and His creation. This, it contends, is what Jesus meant when he said that &quot;the devil is a liar and the father of it&quot; (John 8:44). The demand for Christians, therefore, is to &quot;unmask&quot; the devil's lies through Christ, revealing the true and eternal perfection of God's creation. Eddy therefore called evil &quot;error&quot; and felt it could be remedied through a better spiritual understanding of one's relationship to God. She contended that this understanding was what enabled the biblical [[Jesus]] to heal and accords with the Scripture: &quot;We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.&quot; (I John 4:6)

This teaching is the foundation of the Christian Science principle that disease&amp;nbsp;– and any other adversity&amp;nbsp;– can be cured through prayerful efforts, made possible only by God's grace, to fully understand this spiritual relationship. It is encapsulated in ''Science and Health'' as &quot;The [[Scientific Statement of Being]]&quot;. It is read aloud in churches and Sunday schools at the end of every Sunday service:
::''There is no life, truth, intelligence, nor substance in matter. All is infinite Mind and its infinite manifestation, for God is All-in-all. Spirit is immortal Truth; matter is mortal error. Spirit is the real and eternal; matter is the unreal and temporal. Spirit is God, and man is His image and likeness. Therefore man is not material; he is spiritual.''&lt;ref&gt;Mary Baker Eddy. ''Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures'', 1910 edition, published by Trustees under the will of Mary Baker G. Eddy, page 468 ASIN 0007FAPN0&lt;/ref&gt;

(In the church, the passage from I John 3:1–3 and a biblical benediction are also read.)

This belief in the unreality of imperfection, stemming from the allness of God, Spirit, is the basis of Christian Scientists' characteristic reliance on [[faith healing|prayer]] in place of traditional medical care, often with the aid of [[Christian Science Practitioner|Christian Science practitioners]].

Christian Science practitioners are listed in the [[Christian Science Journal]], with the permission of the church's [[Christian Science Board of Directors|Board of Directors]], their only form of official recognition by the church and among the Christian Science laity. (Some &quot;unlisted&quot; practitioners maintain active practices as well, but they do so without the acceditation that a ''Journal'' listing brings. Additionally, medical insurance plans that cover Christian Science treatment generally only cover treatment provided by Journal-listed practitioners).

Practitioners treat patients, in Christian Science parlance, through prayer. Such treatment often, though not always, is for health-related problems, and a practitioner's patient may request help for personal problems as well, such as relationships, problems of employment or housing and so on. Practitioners generally charge a fee for their services. Christian Scientists believe that through scientific study of the inspired word of the Bible, especially Jesus' words and works, one can learn to heal. Healing is understood not as an end in itself, but a natural result of drawing closer to God. Healing sin is particularly important. Eddy called this the &quot;emphatic purpose&quot; of Christian Science, writing that it is also sometimes more difficult than healing sickness, because &quot;while mortals love to sin, they do not love to be sick.&quot; (Rudimental Divine Science, page 2)

Christian Scientists celebrate the sacraments of [[baptism]] and [[eucharist]] in an entirely non-material way. &quot;Our baptism,&quot; wrote Eddy, &quot;is purification from all error...Our Eucharist is spiritual communion with the one God. Our bread, 'which cometh down from heaven,' is Truth. Our cup is the cross. Our wine the inspiration of Love, the draught the Master drank and commended to his followers&quot;. (''Science and Health,'' page 35) There are no rituals in the Christian Science church, but at the communion service, held twice a year, those in attendance are invited to kneel for silent prayer, followed by the audible repetition of the Lord's Prayer. The communion service is not held at The Mother Church.&lt;ref&gt;''Church Manual,'' page 61, Article XVIII, Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage is not a sacrament of the Christian Science church, but the church's by-laws require a legal, religious ceremony for marriage: &quot;If a Christian Scientist is to be married, the ceremony shall be performed by a clergyman who is legally authorized.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Church Manual,'' page 49, Article IX, Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christ Jesus is both &quot;Wayshower&quot; and savior in Christian Science theology. Eddy distinguished between the corporeal Jesus, the human man in the flesh (the Son of Man), and the incorporeal Christ (the Son of God). According to Christian Science, Christ is &quot;the divine manifestation of God, which comes to the flesh to destroy incarnate error.&quot; (''Science and Health,'' page 583) This incorporeal Christ is the &quot;spiritual selfhood&quot; (or spiritual identity) of Jesus (Science and Health 38). In Eddy's Message to The Mother Church for 1901, in the section titled &quot;Christ Is One and Divine&quot;, she writes:

::''The Christ was Jesus' spiritual selfhood; therefore Christ existed prior to Jesus, who said, &quot;Before Abraham was, I am.&quot; Jesus, the only immaculate, was born of a virgin mother, and Christian Science explains that mystic saying of the Master as to his dual personality, or the spiritual and material Christ Jesus, called in Scripture the Son of God and the Son of man&amp;nbsp;— explains it as referring to his eternal spiritual selfhood and his temporal manhood.'' (Message for 1901, page 8)

This accords with a basic plank in the platform of Christian Science:

::''The invisible Christ was imperceptible to the so-called personal senses, whereas Jesus appeared as a bodily existence. This dual personality of the unseen and the seen, the spiritual and material, the eternal Christ and the corporeal Jesus manifest in flesh, continued until the Master's ascension, when the human, material concept, or Jesus, disappeared, while the spiritual self, or Christ, continues to exist in the eternal order of divine Science, taking away the sins of the world, as the Christ has always done, even before the human Jesus was incarnate to mortal eyes.&quot; (Science and Health, page 334)

Christian Science teaches that Christ Jesus was sent by God and that his history is factual, including the virgin birth, the crucifixion, the resurrection, and the ascension.&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Health,'' page 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his special status due to the virgin birth and his pure, unselfish nature, Jesus voluntarily faced his struggle in Gethsemane, death, resurrection, and ascension to show humanity that no phase of mortal existence was beyond God's redeeming love. Eddy wrote: &quot;Jesus of Nazareth taught and demonstrated man's oneness with the Father, and for this we owe him endless homage&quot;. (Science and Health, page 18)

::''Jesus could have withdrawn himself from his enemies. He had power to lay down a human sense of life for his spiritual identity in the likeness of the divine; but he allowed men to attempt the destruction of the mortal body in order that he might furnish the proof of immortal life. Nothing could kill this Life of man. Jesus could give his temporal life into his enemies' hands; but when his earth-mission was accomplished, his spiritual life, indestructible and eternal, was found forever the same.'' (Science and Health, page 51)

Christian Science teaches that we are not Christians until we &quot;go and do likewise,&quot; until we in some degree &quot;come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ,&quot; as it says in the Scriptures (Ephesians 4:13). We never become Christ, but we are called upon to become fully Christly or Christ-like, to emulate our Master's great words and works in some measure. This was Eddy's understanding of Jesus' saying: &quot;He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto my Father&quot; (John 14:12). No one's ministry, however, can equal that of Christ Jesus in Christian Science. Eddy even stipulated in her Church Manual that &quot;careless comparison or irreverent reference to Christ Jesus is abnormal in a Christian Scientist and is prohibited.&quot; (''Church Manual,'' page 41) She also wrote: &quot;The cardinal points of Christian Science cannot be lost sight of, namely&amp;nbsp;— one God, supreme, infinite, and one Christ Jesus.&quot; (Miscellany 339)

Christian Scientists are [[Trinitarianism|trinitarian]], but in an unorthodox way. One plank of the platform of Christian Science says:

::''Life, Truth, and Love constitute the triune Person called God,&amp;nbsp;— that is, the triply divine Principle, Love. They represent a trinity in unity, three in one,&amp;nbsp;— the same in essence, though multi-form in office: God the Father-Mother; Christ the spiritual idea of sonship; divine Science or the Holy Comforter. These three express in divine Science the threefold, essential nature of the infinite. They also indicate the divine Principle of scientific being, the intelligent relation of God to man and the universe.'' (Science and Health, page 331)

Eddy calls God &quot;Father-Mother,&quot; signifying not an androgynous God but a God &quot;without body, parts or passions,&quot; as in the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], who nevertheless functions both to govern and comfort. She calls the Holy Ghost &quot;divine Science or the Holy Comforter,&quot; the spiritual law of God operating as the Holy Ghost in the world. She sent her students a definition of the Trinity (circa 1898), which read in part: &quot;Jesus in the flesh was the prophet or wayshower to Life, Truth, and Love, and out of the flesh Jesus was the Christ, the spiritual idea, or image and likeness of God.&quot; (Christian Science Journal, July 1915, p.&amp;nbsp;192). This statement reflects Mrs. Eddy's doctrine regarding the uniqueness, unity, and individuality of Christ Jesus' eternal, spiritual identity.

===Spiritual healing in the material world===
Christian Science's focus on spiritual healing led to some measure of stir in the theological realm at first. Under the influence of the Enlightenment, many mainstream denominations had relegated spiritual healing to the realm of a one-time [[dispensationalism|dispensation]] rather than a modern practice. During the religion's early days of rapid growth, the teachings were frequently attacked from the pulpit and press.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tomlinson&quot;&gt;Rev. Irving C. Tomlinson. ''Twelve Years with Mary Baker Eddy'' (1945)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Kimball. &quot;Facts and Fictions about Christian Science.&quot; Lecture delivered April 8, 1898, from ''Lectures and Articles on Christian Science'' (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Science and Legislation.'' (1909) Chapter: Editorial Comments (a collection of quotes from magazines and newspapers around the US).&lt;/ref&gt;

While reliance on prayer is central to Christian Science, Christian Scientists are not officially required to refuse medicine. Orthodox practitioners treating a patient who decides to switch to medical care will typically resign the case because combining methods is discouraged. Such efforts are even referred to as &quot;mental quackery.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''Science and Health'' page 458&lt;/ref&gt; Prayer and matter-based medicine are described as being essentially incompatible. &quot;The flesh and Spirit can no more unite in action, than good can coincide with evil. It is not wise to take a halting and half-way position or to expect to work equally with Spirit and matter, Truth and error.&quot; (Science and Health, page 167)

Nonetheless, Eddy said a person may accept certain temporary aid from a doctor if he is in pain &quot;so violent,&quot; he is unable to pray for himself. (''Science and Health,'' page 464) She also made it clear that people were not to be prevented from seeking whatever help they feel will help them.
:: ''If patients fail to experience the healing power of Christian Science, and think they can be benefited by certain ordinary physical methods of medical treatment, then the Mind-physician should give up such cases, and leave invalids free to resort to whatever other systems they fancy will afford relief.'' (Science and Health, page 443)

Christian Science teaches that spiritual healing is a natural result of studying Jesus' teachings&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Health,'' page xi&lt;/ref&gt; and that he proved his teachings by healing. Christian Scientists are instructed to follow Jesus' example and heal as well, as the words in the registered trademark of the [[Cross and Crown]] indicate.

The Church claims to have over 50,000 testimonies of healing through Christian Science treatment alone. While most of these testimonies represent ailments neither diagnosed nor treated by medical professionals, the Church does require three other people to vouch for any testimony published in its official organ, the ''[[Christian Science Journal]].''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spirituality.com/journal/testimony_guidelines.jhtml &quot;Guidelines for submitting testimonies&quot;] ''Christian Science Journal'' web site&lt;/ref&gt; However, some{{Who|date=July 2008}} critics of the Church complain that the verification guidelines are not strict enough. The Church also has a number of statements regarding diagnosed conditions accompanied by legal affidavits of authenticity signed by medical practitioners who witnessed a non-medical healing. Historian and journalist [[Robert Peel (Christian Science)|Robert Peel]], who was a Christian Scientist, chronicles examples of these accounts, quoting from the affidavits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peel-Spiritual Healing&quot; /&gt;

Christian Scientists may take an intensive two-week &quot;Primary&quot; class from an authorized Christian Science teacher.&lt;ref&gt;''Church Manual,'' page 92, Article XXX, Section 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who wish to become &quot;Journal-listed&quot; (accredited) practitioners, devoting themselves full-time to the public practice of healing, must first have Primary class instruction. When they have a proven record of healing, they may submit their names for publication in the directory of practitioners and teachers in the ''Christian Science Journal.'' A practitioner who has been listed for at least three years' may apply for &quot;Normal&quot; class instruction, given just once every three years.&lt;ref&gt;''Church Manual,'' page 89, Article XXIX, Section 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Church Manual,'' page 84, Article XXVi, Section 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who receive a certificate are authorized to teach.&lt;ref&gt;''Church Manual, page 85, Article XXVI, Section 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Primary and Normal classes are based on the Bible and the writings of Mary Baker Eddy. The Primary class focuses on the chapter, &quot;Recapitulation&quot; in ''Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures''. This chapter uses the Socratic method of teaching and contains the &quot;Scientific Statement of Being&quot;. The &quot;Normal&quot; class focuses on the platform of Christian Science, contained on pages 330-340 of ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures|Science and Health]].''&lt;ref&gt;''Church Manual, page 86, Article XXVII, Section 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical studies of spiritual healing==
The medical community (and others) have taken some interest in spirituality and healing. The [[Harvard Medical School]] Department of Continuing Education continues to offer a course titled &quot;Spirituality and Healing in Medicine; The Importance of the Integration of Mind/Body Practices and Prayer&quot; which The Mother Church has supported. In addition, some studies on the effectiveness of prayer on recovering heart attack patients have shown a small benefit to prayer or other spiritual treatment in recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1097/00007611-198807000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note that the patients in these studies received some form of spiritual healing (i.e. not Christian Science 'treatment') ''in addition to'', not instead of, conventional medical care. Later studies (again not involving Christian Science treatment) with larger numbers of heart patients showed prayer has no effect on recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12082681/ Power of prayer flunks an unusual test - Heart health - MSNBC.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

[[File:ChristianScienceChurch.jpg|thumb|right|The First Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, from another perspective]]
'''[[The First Church of Christ, Scientist (Boston, Massachusetts)|The First Church of Christ, Scientist]]''' is the legal title of The [[Mother Church]] and administrative headquarters of the Christian Science Church. The complex is located in a {{convert|14|acre|m2|sing=on}} plaza alongside Huntington Avenue in the [[Back Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|Back Bay]] neighborhood of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].

The church itself was built in 1894, and an annex larger in footprint than the original structure was added in 1906. It boasts one of the world's largest [[pipe organ]]s, built by the [[Aeolian-Skinner|Aeolian-Skinner Company]] of Boston. The [[Mary Baker Eddy Library|Mary Baker Eddy Library for the Betterment of Humanity]] is housed in an 11-story structure originally built for The Christian Science Publishing Society constructed between 1932 and 1934, and the present plaza was constructed in the late 1960s and early 1970s to include a 28 story administration building, a [[colonnade]], and a [[reflecting pool]] with fountain, designed by Araldo Cossutta of [[I. M. Pei]] and Partners (now Pei Cobb Freed).

Branch churches of The Mother Church may take the title of '''First Church of Christ, Scientist'''; Second; but the article '''The''' must not be used, presumably to concede the primacy of the Boston [[Mother Church]].

An international daily newspaper, the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', founded by Eddy in 1908 and winner of seven [[Pulitzer prize]]s, is published by the church through the [[Christian Science Publishing Society]].

Branch Christian Science churches and Christian Science societies are subordinate to the Mother Church, but are self-governed. They have their own by-laws, bank accounts, assets and officers, but in order to be recognised must abide by the by-laws in the ''[[Manual of The Mother Church]]''. Church services are regulated by the ''Manual,'' the set of by-laws written by Eddy, that establishes the church organization and explains the duties and responsibilities of members, officers, practitioners, teachers and nurses; and establishes rules for discipline and other aspects of church business.

===Board of Directors===

[[File:Christian Science Mother Church, Boston, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|right|The Mother Church, [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].]]
The Christian Science Board of Directors is a five-person executive entity created by [[Mary Baker Eddy]] to conduct the business of the [[Christian Science|Christian Science Church]] under the terms defined in the by-laws of the ''[[Manual of The Mother Church|Church Manual]]''. Its functions and restrictions are defined by the ''Manual.''

The Board (occasionally CSBD or the BoD for short) also includes functions defined by a Deed of Trust written by Eddy (one of several, in fact) under which it consisted of four persons, though she later expanded the Board to five persons, thus in effect leaving one of its members out of Deed functions. This later bore on a dispute during the 1920s, known as the Great Litigation in CS circles, pivoting on whether the CSBD could remove trustees of the [[Christian Science Publishing Society]] or whether the CSPS trustees were established independently.

While Eddy's Manual established limited executive functions under the rule of law in place of a traditional hierarchy, the controversial 1991 publication of a book by [[Bliss Knapp]] led the then Board of Directors to make the unusual affidavit during a suit over Knapp's estate that neither acts by it violating the ''Manual,'' nor acts refraining from required action, constituted violations of the ''Manual.'' A traditionally-minded minority held that the Board's act in publishing Knapp's book constituted a fundamental violation of several by-laws and its legal trust, automatically mandating the offending Board members' resignations under Article I, Section 9.

Another minority believed that Eddy intended various requirements for her consent (in their view, &quot;estoppels&quot;) to effect the church's dissolution on her passing, since they could no longer be followed literally. Ironically, one of the stronger arguments against this position came from an individual highly respected by their theological quarter, [[Bliss Knapp]], who claimed that Eddy understood through her lawyer that these consent clauses would not hinder normal operation after her decease.

===Services===

Churches worldwide hold a one-hour service each Sunday, consisting of hymns, prayer, and currently, readings from the ''[[King James Version]]'' (KJV) of the Bible (although there is no requirement that this version of the Bible be used) and ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]]''. These readings are the weekly Lesson-Sermon, which is read aloud at all Sunday services in all Christian Science churches worldwide, and is studied by individuals at home throughout the preceding week. The Lesson, as it is informally called, is compiled by a committee at The Mother Church, and is usually made up of six sections, each of which consists of passages from the Bible (read by the Second Reader) and passages from ''Science and Health'' (read by the First Reader).

Eddy selected 26 subjects for the Lesson-Sermon. These Lessons run in continuous rotation in the order she established, hence each subject is studied twice a year. In years in which there are 53 Sundays, the topic &quot;Christ Jesus&quot; occurs a third time, in December. In addition, there is a special, shortened Lesson-Sermon for Thanksgiving Day.

* ''See'' [[List of Christian Science tenets, prayers, and statements]] for the complete list of subjects.

Because there are no clergy in the church, branch church Sunday services are conducted by two Readers: the First Reader, who reads passages from Science and Health, and the Second Reader, who reads passages from the Bible. First Readers determine the beginning &quot;scriptural selection&quot;, hymns to be sung on Sundays, and the benediction. The vast majority of the service is the reading of the weekly Bible lesson supplied by Boston, and order of service set out by the Manual. To be elected the First Reader in one's branch church is one of the highest and most important positions the lay Christian Scientist can aspire to.

Churches also hold a one-hour Wednesday evening testimony meeting, with similar readings, after which, those in attendance are invited to share accounts of healing through prayer. At these services, the First Reader reads passages from the Bible and Science and Health. They may choose alternate Bible translations at these services (i.e. [[Phillips New Testament in Modern English|Phillips]]).

Branch churches also sponsor annual public talks (called lectures) given by speakers selected annually by the Board of Lectureship in Boston.

==Recent problems==
===Broadcasting===
Beginning in the mid-1980s, church executives undertook a controversial and ambitious foray into electronic broadcast media. The first significant effort was to create a weekly half-hour syndicated television program, The Christian Science Monitor Reports. &quot;Monitor Reports&quot; was anchored in its first season by newspaper veteran Rob Nelson. He was replaced in the second by the ''Christian Science Monitor'''s former Moscow correspondent, David Willis. The program was usually broadcast by independent stations&amp;nbsp;— often at odd hours.

In 1988, Monitor Reports was supplanted by a nightly half-hour news show, World Monitor, which was broadcast by the [[Discovery Channel]]. The program was anchored by veteran journalist [[John Hart (journalist)|John Hart]]. The Church then purchased a Boston [[cable TV]] station for elaborate in-house programming production. In parallel, the church purchased a [[shortwave radio]] station and syndicated radio production to [[National Public Radio]]. However, revenues fell far short of optimistic predictions by church managers, who had ignored early warnings by members and media experts.

In October 1991, after a series of conflicts over the boundaries between Christian Science teachings and his journalistic independence, John Hart resigned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-09-02/features/1992246098_1_world-monitor-non-church-christian-science-church &quot;Ex-anchor cites interference at Monitor&quot;] ''The Baltimore Sun'' September 2, 1992. Accessed Feb. 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Monitor Channel went off the air in June 1992. Most of the other operations closed in well under a decade. Public accounts in both the mainstream and trade media reported that the church lost approximately $250 million on these ventures.

The hundreds of millions lost on broadcasting brought the church to the brink of bankruptcy. However, with the 1991 publication of ''[[The Destiny of The Mother Church]]'' by the late [[Bliss Knapp]], the church secured a $90 million bequest from the Knapp trust. The trust dictated that the book be published as &quot;Authorized Literature,&quot; with neither modification nor comment. Historically, the church had censured Knapp for deviating at several points from Eddy's teaching, and had refused to publish the work. The church's archivist, fired in anticipation of the book's publication, wrote to branch churches to inform them of the book's history. Many Christian Scientists thought the book violated the church's [[Manual of The Mother Church|by-laws]], and the editors of the church's religious periodicals and several other church employees resigned in protest. Alternate beneficiaries subsequently sued to contest the church's claim it had complied fully with the will's terms, and the church ultimately received only half of the original sum.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Steinfels. [http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/29/us/fiscal-and-spiritual-rifts-shake-christian-scientists.html?pagewanted=1 &quot;Fiscal and Spiritual Rifts Shake Christian Scientists&quot;] ''New York Times'' (February 29, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/pr/93/931216Arc3005.html Press release] Stanford University. December 16, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

The fallout of the broadcasting debacle also sparked a minor revolt among some prominent church members. In late 1993, a group of Christian Scientists filed suit against the Board of Directors, alleging a willful disregard for the [[Manual of The Mother Church|Manual of the Mother Church]] in its financial dealings. The suit was thrown out by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in 1997, but a lingering discontent with the church's financial matters persists to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appellate.net/briefs/weaverbrief.pdf Appellate Brief No. SJC-07156]&lt;/ref&gt; (PDF)

===Membership decline and financial setbacks===
In spite of its early meteoric rise, church membership has declined sharply over the past eight decades, according to the church's treasurer J. Edward Odegaard.&lt;ref&gt;''The Christian Science Journal'' November, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Church is prohibited by the [[Manual of The Mother Church|Manual]] from publishing membership figures, the number of branch churches in the United States has fallen steadily since World War II. Dr. Stephen Barrett has reported that since 1971, the number of practitioners and teachers in the United States listed in the Christian Science Journal has fallen from nearly 5,000 to just over 300 and the number of churches in the United States has fallen from about 1,800 to about 900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/cs.html Christian Science Statistics: Practitioners, Teachers, and Churches in the United States]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the Boston Globe reported that the church is considering consolidating Boston operations into fewer buildings and leasing out space in buildings it owns. Church official Philip G. Davis noted that the administration and Colonnade buildings have not been fully used for many years and that vacancy increased after staff reductions last year. The church posted an $8 million financial loss in fiscal 2003, and in 2004 cut 125 jobs, a quarter of the staff, at [[The Christian Science Monitor]]. Davis said however that &quot;the financial situation right now is excellent&quot; that the church is not facing financial problems.&lt;ref&gt;''Boston Globe'' October 13, 2005 p. A1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and criticisms==
From the moment [[Mark Twain]] published his 1907 attack on Christian Science, the Church, and Mary Baker Eddy, herself,&lt;ref name=TwainCS&gt;{{cite book

Twain aimed much of his ridicule at the idea of healing through prayer&amp;nbsp;— particularly when practiced remotely. However, according to his biographer, [[Albert Bigelow Paine|Albert Paine]], Twain seemed to quarrel more with what he saw as Mary Baker Eddy's [[cult of personality]] than with the actual ideas of Christian Science saying:

:&quot;Clemens never had any quarrel with the theory of Christian Science or mental healing, or with any of the empiric practices. He acknowledged good in all of them, and he welcomed most of them in preference to materia medica. ... His quarrel with Mrs. Eddy lay in the belief that she herself, as he expressed it, was &quot;a very unsound Christian Scientist.&quot;
:: 'I believe she has a serious malady—self-edification—and that it will be well to have one of the experts demonstrate over her. [But he added]: Closely examined, painstakingly studied, she is easily the most interesting person on the planet, and in several ways as easily the most extraordinary woman that was ever born upon it.{{Single double}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paine&quot; /&gt;

Later, Twain seemed to reverse his stance towards Eddy as Paine quoted Twain as saying: &quot;... Christian Science is humanity's boon. ... [Mary Baker Eddy] has organized and made available a healing principle that for two thousand years has never been employed, except as the merest kind of guesswork. She is the benefactor of the age.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paine&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

Twain also expressed grave doubts about the authorship of [[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]], showing through [[content analysis]] that the quality of the writing was much better than any of Eddy's previous or subsequent work (for example her autobiography and her later writings in the [[Christian Science Journal]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;That she wrote the Autobiography, and that preface, and the Poems, and the Plague-spot Bacilli, we are not permitted to doubt. Indeed we know that she wrote them.  But the very certainty that she wrote these things compels in us a doubt that she wrote Science and Health.&lt;ref name=TwainCS /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, the most publicized controversies are still over the issue of medicine. While church members point out that followers are free to choose to seek conventional medical treatment, most rely exclusively on healing by prayer. Christian Scientists distinguish their method from “[[faith healing]].” To a Christian Scientist, “faith healing” is something that relies merely on blind faith in miraculous cures. Christian Scientists see themselves as practicing a well-defined process with a proven track record&lt;ref name=&quot;Peel-Spiritual Healing&quot;&gt;Robert Peel. &quot;Spiritual Healing in a Scientific Age'' (1987) ISBN 978-0-06-066484-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Century of Christian Science Healing'' (1966) ISBN 978-0-87510-067-8&lt;/ref&gt; by means of the spiritualization of thought through prayer aimed at shedding the false beliefs of the mortal mind that manifest themselves as physical ailments.

This issue is most controversial regarding children. In a number of nationally publicized cases in the early 1990s, prosecutors charged parents belonging to the Christian Science church with [[murder]] or [[manslaughter]] after their children died of likely curable ailments without being medically treated. The best-known of these was the [[Twitchell Case]] in Massachusetts, in which parents David and Ginger Twitchell were convicted in 1990 of involuntary manslaughter in the death of their two-year-old son Robyn, who succumbed to a bowel obstruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1990Aug06&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

Such cases are also controversial inside the Church. Many members believe that the parents involved received poor guidance from church leaders, while others contend that the process of healing through Christian Science was not done correctly.

Since the episodes with regard to The Monitor Channel and the Bliss Knapp book, the church has at times been accused of attempting to silence dissenters by methods such as delisting them as practitioners in the Christian Science Journal, or excommunicating them. Some dissenting groups continue to solicit support among current members of the church.{{Who|date=July 2008}}

There have also been tensions over theological and religious concerns. While members of the Christian Science church claim their religion is based in, reconcilable with, and part of Christianity (being based on the teachings of Jesus), there are [[Chalcedonian Christianity|orthodox Christian]] theologians and others who disagree. These critics{{Who|date=October 2008}} state that Mary Baker Eddy's interpretation of Christian scripture diverges too greatly from basic tenets of Christianity. They often cite Christian Science's views on the nature/existence of evil or sin, the divinity and resurrection of Jesus, the Trinity, and a few other matters as demonstrating that it cannot be considered a [[Christian denomination]]. In response, Christian Scientists say that Jesus never claimed to be God and even implicitly denied it in {{bibleverse||Matthew|19:16–17}}.

* ''Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery''; ''Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Trial''; and ''Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Authority'' comprise the three-volume biography of Eddy favored by Christian Scientists. It was written by Christian Scientist, scholar and longtime Mother Church employee Robert Peel. It is the church's de facto &quot;official biography&quot; of Eddy, though it was not published by the church.
* ''The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science'' by [[Willa Cather]] and Georgine Milmine (1909) began as a famous Muckraking magazine series 1907–08. Scholars who are not Christian Scientists rely on it, but church members strongly disfavor it. It was reprinted by the [[University of Nebraska Press]] in 1993.

It is bordered by [[Rhode Island]] to the east, [[Massachusetts]] to the north, the state of [[New York]] to the west, and by the [[Long Island Sound]] to the south.

Named for the [[Connecticut River]], the major U.S. river that approximately bisects the state, Connecticut's capital city is [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. The [[Knowledge Corridor]] surrounding Hartford and [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], the latter of which lies only 5 miles north of the Connecticut state line, constitute New England's second most populous metropolitan region (with approximately 1.8 million residents and 110,000 university students.) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.westernmassedc.com/Data__Demographics/knowledgecorridor/&lt;/ref&gt; Southwestern Connecticut is considered part of the [[New York metropolitan area]]; three of Connecticut's eight counties are in the [[New York metropolitan area#Components of the metropolitan area|New York City combined statistical area]], commonly called the ''[[Tri-State area (NY-NJ-CT)|Tri-State area]]''. Connecticut's center of population is in [[Cheshire, Connecticut|Cheshire]], [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/INFO/COP/ct_links.htm|title= State of Connecticut Center of Population - From ngs.noaa.gov|accessdate=2009-01-30 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkvhYPB |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connecticut is the 29th [[List of U.S. states by population|most populous state]], with 3.5 million residents, and is ranked 48th [[List of U.S. states by area|in size by area]], making it the 4th [[List of U.S. states by population density|most densely populated state]]. Called the ''[[Connecticut#Constitutional history|Constitution State]]'', ''[[Nutmeg]] State'', and &quot;The Land of Steady Habits&quot;,&lt;ref name=SOTS/&gt; Connecticut was influential in the development of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] of the United States.

Connecticut's first European settlers were [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] and established a small, short-lived settlement in present-day Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and [[Connecticut River|Connecticut]] rivers, called ''[[Fort Hoop|Huys de Goede Hoop]]''. Initially, half of Connecticut was a part of the Dutch colony, [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River|Delaware]] rivers.

The first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the [[English people|English]]. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers overland from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded what would become the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. Both the Connecticut and New Haven Colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first [[constitution]]s in North America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a [[royal charter]], making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This colony was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that revolted against British rule in the [[American Revolution]].

The Connecticut River, Thames River, and ports along the Long Island Sound have given the state a strong [[wiktionary:Maritime|maritime]] tradition, which continues today. Connecticut's other traditional industry is financial services; for example, [[insurance]] companies in Hartford and [[hedge funds]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield county]]. As of the 2010 Census, Connecticut features the highest [[per capita]] income, [[Human Development Index]] (0.962), and [[Household income in the United States|median household income]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=29 November 2005| title=Highest wages in East, lowest in South| publisher=USA Today| url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2005-11-29-wage_x.htm | first1=Stephen | last1=Ohlemacher | accessdate=2010-04-30|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkvtVNF |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=18 March 2000| title=Census 2000| publisher= United States Census Bureau| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-_box_head_nbr=GCT-P14&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&amp;-format=US-9|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkweQ74 |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=17 July 2008| title=US slips down development index| publisher=BBC| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7511426.stm|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkxLjnC |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Connecticut is a wealthy state by most measures, the income gap between its urban and suburban areas is striking, with several of Connecticut's cities ranking among the nation's poorest and most dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/09/nyregion/09income.html | work=The New York Times | title=Income Gap in Connecticut Is Growing Fastest, Study Finds | date=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://os.cqpress.com/citycrime/2010/City_crime_rate_2010-2011_hightolow.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Connecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York State]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital is [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], and other major cities (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]] and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.
[[File:Approaching Summit Again.JPG|left|thumb|155px|Bear Mountain, highest peak in Connecticut.]]

The highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42° 3' N; 73° 29' W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The state's most populous metropolitan region, the [[Knowledge Corridor]], lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in the southeastern [[New London County]], it features beaches and maritime activities.

Although Connecticut has a long maritime history, and a reputation based on that history, Connecticut has no direct access to the sea. The jurisdiction of New York actually extends east at [[Fishers Island]], where New York shares a sea border with [[Rhode Island]] dividing [[Narragansett Bay]]. Although Connecticut has easy access to the Atlantic, between [[Long Island Sound]] and [[Block Island Sound]], Connecticut has no direct ocean coast.

Connecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns center around a &quot;[[village green|green]]&quot;, such as the Litchfield Green, Simsbury Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in the state), and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[Church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or &quot;[[inne]]&quot;, several [[colonial house]]s, and so on, establishing a scenic historic appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and [[tourism]].

Connecticut consists of [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]]. [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of [[Quercus|oaks]], [[Carya|hickories]], and [[Acer (genus)|maple]] cover much of the state.&lt;ref name = &quot;ecoregions&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author = Olson, D.

The northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the distinctive Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately 2.5&amp;nbsp;mile (4.0&amp;nbsp;km) square detour into Connecticut. The actual origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which was finally concluded in 1804, when southern Southwick, (whose residents sought to leave Massachusetts), was split in half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf | title=The Southwick Jog|format=PDF|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5p1plFeFC |archivedate = 2010-04-16|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm|title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog| publisher=Connecticut State Library|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkzcI4A |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southwestern border of Connecticut, where it abuts New York State, is marked by a [[panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] and part of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm| title=Connecticut's &quot;Panhandle&quot;| publisher=Connecticut State Library|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKl03gYx |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scoville Memorial Libraries collection began in 1771, when Richard Smith, owner of a local blast furnace, used community contributions to buy 200 books in London. Patrons could borrow and return books on the third Monday of every third month. Fees were collected for damages, the most common being &quot;greasing&quot; by wax dripped from the candles by which the patrons read.

===Climate===
Interior portions of Connecticut have a [[humid continental climate]], while other parts, especially the Connecticut shoreline (southern four counties), have a [[humid subtropical climate]] with seasonal extremes tempered by proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. The city of Bridgeport (on Long Island Sound), like most other areas in [[Tri-State Region|metropolitan New York]], has a humid subtropical climate under the Koppen Climate Classification system. Hartford (35&amp;nbsp;miles inland) has a humid continental climate. Consistent with its coastal reputation, Connecticut is a moderately sunny state, averaging between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm|title=united states annual sunshine map|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winters are generally considered to be cold, with average temperatures ranging from 31&amp;nbsp;°F (−1&amp;nbsp;°C) in the maritime influenced southeast to 23&amp;nbsp;°F (−5&amp;nbsp;°C) in the northwest in January. The average yearly snowfall is about 25–100&quot; (64–254&amp;nbsp;cm) across the state, with higher totals in the northwest. Spring has variable temperatures with frequent rainfall. Summer is hot and humid throughout the state, with average highs in New London of 81&amp;nbsp;°F (27&amp;nbsp;°C) and 87&amp;nbsp;°F (31&amp;nbsp;°C) in Windsor Locks. Fall months are mild and bring colorful foliage across the state in October and November. During hurricane season, tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region. Thunderstorms are most frequent during the summer, occurring on average 30 times annually. These storms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;tornadoes&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif| title=Annual average number of tornadoes| publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center| accessdate=2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connecticut's warmest temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the coldest temperature is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943 and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&amp;state=CT|title=All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ctcolony.png|thumb|right|400px|A map of the Connecticut, New Haven, and Saybrook colonies.]]

The name of the state is an Anglicized version of the Algonquian word &quot;quinatucquet&quot;, meaning &quot;upon the long river&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Project&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Federal Writers' Project|title=Connecticut: A Guide to Its Roads, Lore and People|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CPYfSsQ-WE4C&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=23 September 2010|publisher=US History Publishers|isbn=978-1-60354-007-0|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Connecticut region was inhabited by the [[Mohegan]] tribe prior to European colonization. The first European explorer in Connecticut was the Dutch explorer [[Adriaen Block]]. After he explored this region in 1614, Dutch fur traders sailed up the Connecticut River (then known by the Dutch as Versche Rivier—&quot; Fresh River&quot;) and built a fort at Dutch Point in what is present-day Hartford, which they called &quot;House of Hope&quot; ({{lang-nl|Huis van Hoop}}).

[[John Winthrop the Younger|John Winthrop]], then of Massachusetts, received permission to create a new colony at [[Saybrook Colony|Old Saybrook]] at the mouth of the Connecticut River in 1635. This was the first of three distinct colonies that later would be combined to make up Connecticut. Saybrook Colony was a direct challenge to Dutch claims. The colony was not more than a small outpost and never matured. In 1644, the Saybrook Colony merged itself into the Connecticut Colony.

The first English settlers came in 1633 and settled at Windsor, and then at Wethersfield the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cslib.org/earlysettlers.htm |title=Early Settlers of Connecticut – Connecticut State Library |publisher=Cslib.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the main body of settlers came in one large group in 1636. The settlers were [[Puritan]]s from Massachusetts, led by [[Thomas Hooker]]. Hooker had been prominent in England and was a professor of theology at Cambridge. He was also an important political writer and made a significant contribution to Constitutional theory. He broke with the political leadership in Massachusetts, and, just as [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] created a new polity in [[Rhode Island]], Hooker and his cohort did the same and established the [[Connecticut Colony]] at Hartford in 1636. This was the second of the three colonies.

The third colony was founded in March 1638. [[New Haven Colony]] (originally known as the Quinnipiack Colony) was established by [[John Davenport (clergyman)|John Davenport]], [[Theophilus Eaton]], and others at New Haven. The New Haven Colony had its own constitution, &quot;The Fundamental Agreement of the New Haven Colony&quot;, which was signed on June 4, 1639.

Because the Dutch were outnumbered by the flood of English settlers from Massachusetts, they left their fort in 1654.

Neither the establishment of the Connecticut Colony or the Quinnipiack Colony was carried out with the sanction of the English Crown, and they were independent political entities. They naturally were presumptively English, but in a legal sense, they were only secessionist outposts of Massachusetts Bay. In 1662, Winthrop took advantage of this void in political affairs and obtained in England the charter by which the colonies of Connecticut and Quinnipiack were united. Although Winthrop's charter favored the Connecticut colony, New Haven remained a seat of government with Hartford until after the American Revolution.

Winthrop was very politically astute and secured the charter from the newly restored [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who granted the most liberal political terms.

Historically important colonial settlements included:
:[[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]] (1633)
:[[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]] (1634)
:[[Deep River, Connecticut|Saybrook]] (1635)
:[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] (1636)
:[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] (1638)
:[[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]] (1639)
:[[Guilford, Connecticut|Guilford]] (1639)
:[[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]] (1639)
:[[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]] (1639)
:[[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]] (1640)
:[[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] (1641)
:[[New London, Connecticut|New London]] (1646)

Its first constitution, the &quot;[[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]]&quot;, was adopted on January 14, 1639, while its [[Connecticut Constitution|current constitution]], the third for Connecticut, was adopted in 1965. Connecticut is the fifth of the original 13 states. The original constitutions influenced the US Constitution as one of the leading authors was [[Roger Sherman]] of New Haven.

The western boundaries of Connecticut have been subject to change over time. According to the Hartford Treaty with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], signed on September 19, 1650, but never ratified by the British, the western boundary of Connecticut ran north from [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich Bay]] for a distance of 20&amp;nbsp;miles&lt;ref name=&quot;BOWEN&quot;&gt;Bowen, Clarence Winthrop: ''Boundary Disputes of Connecticut'': [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]: 1882.

This agreement was observed by both sides until war erupted between England and The Netherlands in 1652. No other limits were found. Conflict over uncertain colonial limits continued until the [[Duke of York]] captured [[New Netherland]] in 1664.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BOWEN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FLICK&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, Connecticut's original Charter in 1662 granted it all the land to the &quot;South Sea&quot;, i.e. the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Callison, LCITS |url=http://www.law.ou.edu/ushistory/colony.shtml |title=Connecticut Colony Charter of 1662 |publisher=Law.ou.edu |date=2006-03-14 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctheritage.org/encyclopedia/topicalsurveys/migration.htm Migration from Connecticut] By Barbara Lacey, Connecticut's Heritage Gateway website.&lt;/ref&gt; Most colonial royal grants were for long east-west strips. Connecticut took its grant seriously, and established a ninth county between the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] and [[Delaware River]]s, named [[Westmoreland County, Connecticut|Westmoreland County]]. This resulted in the brief [[Pennamite Wars]] with [[Pennsylvania]].

Connecticut's lands also extended across northern Ohio, called the [[Western Reserve]] lands. The Western Reserve section was settled largely by people from Connecticut, and they brought Connecticut place names to Ohio. Agreements with Pennsylvania and New York extinguished the land claims by Connecticut within its neighbors, and the Western Reserve lands were relinquished to the federal government, which brought the state to its present boundaries.

[[File:Connecticut population map.png|right|thumb|200px|Connecticut Population Density Map.]]

As of 2005, Connecticut has an estimated population of 3,510,297,&lt;ref name=stateest&gt;{{cite web |date=June 21, 2006 | url = http://www.census.gov/popest/states/tables/NST-EST2005-01.csv | title = Annual Estimates of the Population for the United States and States, and for Puerto Rico: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2005|format = [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] | work = 2005 Population Estimates | publisher = U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division | accessdate =2006-11-17|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr524oZs |archivedate = 2010-01-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an increase of 11,331, or 0.3%, from the prior year and an increase of 104,695, or 3.1%, since the year 2000. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 67,427 people (that is 222,222 births minus 154,795 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 41,718 people into the state. [[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 75,991 people, and [[Human migration|migration]] within the country produced a net loss of 34,273 people. Based on the 2005 estimates, Connecticut moves from the 29th most populous state to 30th.&lt;ref name=stateest/&gt;

6.6% of its population was reported as being under 5 years old, 24.7% under 18 years old, and 13.8% were 65 years of age or older. Females made up approximately 51.6% of the population, with 48.4% male.

In 1790, 97% of the population in Connecticut was classified as &quot;rural&quot;. The first census in which less than half the population was classified as rural was 1890. In the 2000 census, it was only 12.3%. Most of western and southern Connecticut (particularly the [[Gold Coast (Connecticut)|Gold Coast]]) is strongly associated with New York City; this area is the most affluent and populous region of the state. Eastern Connecticut is more culturally influenced by the greater New England area, including the cities of Boston and Providence.

The [[center of population]] of Connecticut is located in the town of [[Cheshire, Connecticut|Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Population and Population Centers by State – 2000 | publisher = United States Census Bureau | accessdate = 2008-12-04 | url = http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mqyj8Y7G |archivedate = 2010-01-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connecticut has large [[Italian American]], [[Irish American]] and [[English American]] populations, as well as [[German American]] and [[Portuguese American]] populations, second highest percentage of any state, behind Rhode Island (19.3%). [[Italian American|Italian]] is the largest ancestry group in five of the state's counties, while the [[Irish American|Irish]] are the largest group in Tolland county, [[French Canadians]] the largest group in Windham county. [[African Americans]] and [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanics]] (mostly [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Ricans]]) are numerous in the urban areas of the state. Like Ohio and New York, Connecticut is also known for its relatively large [[Hungarian American]] population, the majority of which live in and around [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Naugatuck, Connecticut|Naugatuck]] and [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. Connecticut also has a sizable [[Polish American]] population, with [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]] containing the largest [[Polish American]] population in the state.

More recent immigrant populations include those from [[India]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], Mexico, [[Brazil]], [[Guatemala]], [[Panama]], [[Jamaica]], [[Haiti]], [[Cape Verde]] and former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] countries.

[[Jewish American|Jewish congregations]] had 108,280 (3.2%) members in 2000;&lt;ref name=&quot;thearda.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/state/20_2000.asp The Association of Religion Data Archives] Maps &amp; Reports – State Membership Report / Kansas / Denominational Groups, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish population is concentrated in the towns near Long Island Sound between [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], in [[Greater New Haven]] and in [[Greater Hartford]], especially the suburb of [[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]]. According to the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]], the largest Christian denominations, by number of adherents, in 2000 were: the [[Catholic Church]], with 1,372,562; the [[United Church of Christ]], with 124,770; and the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]], with 73,550.&lt;ref name=&quot;thearda.com&quot;/&gt;

Recent [[immigration]] has brought other non-Christian religions to the state, but the numbers of adherents of other religions are still low.

Connecticut is also home to New England's largest Protestant Church: [[The First Cathedral]] in [[Bloomfield, Connecticut]] located in [[Hartford County]].

Hartford is seat to the Roman Catholic [[Archdiocese of Hartford]], which is sovereign over the [[Diocese of Bridgeport]] and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Norwich|Diocese of Norwich]].}

The total [[gross state product]] for 2006 was $204 billion. The [[per capita income]] for 2007 was $54,117, ranking first among the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.courant.com/news/custom/topnews/hcu-ctrichstate,0,6885224.story|title=CT Named Richest State| publisher=The Hartford Courant |date=2008-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, a great disparity in incomes throughout the state; although New Canaan has one of the highest per capita incomes in America, Hartford is one of the ten cities with the lowest per capita incomes in America. As with Bridgeport, New Haven and other cities in the state, Hartford is surrounded by wealthier suburbs.

[[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]] is the wealthiest town in Connecticut, with a per capita income of $85,459. [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Weston, Connecticut|Weston]], [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]] also have per capita incomes over $65,000. [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] is the poorest municipality in Connecticut, with a per capita income of $13,428 in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTincome2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ct.gov/ecd/lib/ecd/economic_data/income/2000_median_hh,_family_&amp;_per_cap_income.xls |title=Connecticut per capita income, median household income, and median family income at State, County and Town level: Census 2000 data |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other lower-income and blue-collar towns, mostly parts of towns, in the eastern part of the State.

===Taxation===
Prior to 1991, Connecticut had an investment-only [[income tax]] system. Income from employment was untaxed, but income from investments was taxed at 13%, the highest rate in the [[United States|U.S.]], with no deductions allowed for costs of producing the investment income, such as interest on borrowing.

In 1991, under Governor [[Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.]], an Independent, the system was changed to one in which the taxes on employment income and investment income were equalized at a maximum rate of 4%. Since then, [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], has become the headquarters for a large number of America's largest [[hedge fund]]s. As of 2009, the income tax rates on Connecticut individuals are divided into three tax brackets of 3%, 5% and 6.5%.&lt;ref name=inctax&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ct.gov/drs/lib/drs/forms/2009forms/incometax/ct-1040booklet.pdf |title=Connecticut income tax instructions |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uCmk84cj |archivedate = 2010-11-13|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; All [[wage]]s of Connecticut residents are subject to the state's income tax, even if earned outside the state. However, in those cases, Connecticut income tax must be withheld only to the extent the Connecticut tax exceeds the amount withheld by the other jurisdiction. Since New York and Massachusetts have higher tax rates than Connecticut, this effectively means that Connecticut residents that work in those states have no Connecticut income tax withheld. Connecticut permits a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions, but since residents who work in other states are still subject to Connecticut income taxation, they may owe taxes if the jurisdictional credit does not fully offset the Connecticut tax amount.

Connecticut levies a 6% state [[sales tax]] on the retail sale, lease, or rental of most goods. Some items and services in general are not subject to sales and use taxes unless specifically enumerated as taxable by [[statute]]. Specifically, clothing under $50 is excluded from sales tax. There are no additional sales taxes imposed by local jurisdictions. During the summer, there is one week during which sales tax on certain items and quantities of clothing is not imposed in order to assist those with children returning to school.

All real and personal property located within the state of Connecticut is taxable unless specifically exempted by statute. All assessments are at 70% of [[fair market value]]. Another 20% of the value may be taxed by the local government though. The maximum property tax credit is $500 per return and any excess may not be refunded or carried forward.&lt;ref name=inctax/&gt; Connecticut does not levy an intangible personal [[property tax]]. According to the [[Tax Foundation]], the 2010 Census data shows Connecticut residents paying the 2nd highest average property taxes in the nation with only New Jersey ahead of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/09/30/pf/taxes/highest_property_taxes/index.htm?source=cnn_bin&amp;hpt=Sbin|title=Highest property taxes in the nation, accessdate=2010-09-30 | work=CNN | first=Les|last=Christie|date=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industries===
The [[Agriculture|agricultural]] produce of the state includes [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery stock]]; [[egg (food)|eggs]]; [[clams]] and [[lobster]] ([[shellfish]]); [[dairy product]]s; [[cattle]]; and [[Types of tobacco#Shade_tobacco|tobacco]]. Its industrial output includes [[transport]]ation equipment, especially [[helicopter]]s, [[aircraft]] parts, and [[nuclear submarine]]s; heavy industrial machinery and electrical equipment; military weaponry; fabricated metal products; [[chemical]] and [[pharmaceutical]] products; and [[Measuring instrument|scientific instruments]].

Due to the prominence of the aircraft industry in the state, Connecticut has an official state aircraft, the [[F4U Corsair]], and an official Connecticut Aviation Pioneer, [[Igor Sikorsky]]. The state officially recognizes aircraft designer [[Gustav Whitehead]] as &quot;Father of Connecticut Aviation&quot; for his research into powered flight in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] in 1901, two years before the [[Wright brothers]] at [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = O'Dwyer | first = Maj.

==Transportation==
[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|300px|right|thumb|Map of Connecticut showing major highways.]]

===Roads===
The [[Interstate highway]]s in the state are [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|I-95]] (the [[Connecticut Turnpike]]) running southwest to northeast along the coast, [[Interstate 84 (east)|I-84]] running southwest to northeast in the center of the state, [[I-91]] running north to south in the center of the state, and [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut)|I-395]] running north to south near the eastern border of the state. The other major highways in Connecticut are the [[Merritt Parkway]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], which together form [[Route 15 (Connecticut)|State Route 15]], running from the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] in [[New York State]] parallel to I-95 before turning north of [[New Haven]] and running parallel to I-91, finally becoming a surface road in [[Berlin, Connecticut]]. Route 15 and I-95 were originally [[toll road]]s; they relied on a system of [[toll plaza]]s at which all traffic stopped and paid fixed tolls. A series of terrible crashes at these plazas eventually contributed to the decision to remove the tolls in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycroads.com/roads/ct-turnpike/ Connecticut Turnpike (I-95)] nycroads.com&lt;/ref&gt; Other major arteries in the state include [[U.S. Route 7]] in the west running parallel to the NY border, [[Route 8 (Connecticut)|State Route 8]] farther east near the industrial city of Waterbury and running north-south along the Naugatuck River Valley nearly parallel with U.S. 7, and [[Route 9 (Connecticut)|State Route 9]] in the east. See [[List of State Routes in Connecticut]] for an overview of the state's highway system.

Between New Haven and the New York City, I-95 is one of the most congested highways in the United States. Many people now drive longer distances to work in the New York City area. This strains the three lanes of traffic capacity, resulting in lengthy [[rush hour]] delays. Frequently, the congestion spills over to clog the parallel Merritt Parkway. The state has encouraged traffic reduction schemes, including rail use and [[ride-sharing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctrides.com/ |title=ctrides.com |publisher=ctrides.com |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connecticut also has a very active bicycling community, with one of the highest rates of bicycling ownership and use in the United States. New Haven's cycling community, organized in a local advocacy group called [[ElmCityCycling]], is particularly active. According to the U.S. Census 2006 American Community Survey, New Haven has the highest percentage of commuters who bicycle to work of any major metropolitan center on the East Coast.

===Public transportation===
[[File:Metro-North train 1567 enters Stamford.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A [[Metro-North Railroad]] [[New Haven Line]] train at [[Stamford Transportation Center|Stamford]].]]

====Rail====
Southwestern Connecticut is served by MTA's [[Metro-North Railroad]] [[New Haven Line]], providing commuter service to New York City and New Haven, with branches servicing [[New Canaan Branch|New Canaan]], [[Danbury Branch|Danbury]], and [[Waterbury Branch|Waterbury]]. Connecticut lies along [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]] which features frequent [[Northeast Regional]] and [[Acela Express]] service. Towns between New Haven and New London are also served by the [[Shore Line East]] commuter line. Operation of commuter trains from New Haven to Springfield on Amtrak's [[New Haven-Springfield Line]] is under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephanie |last=Reitz |title=Conn. looks into building rail line from Springfield to New Haven |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/07/30/conn_looks_into_building_rail_line_from_springfield_to_new_haven/ |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=2006-07-30 |accessdate=2007-01-29}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhhsrail.com/ |title=NHHS Rail |publisher=NHHS Rail |date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amtrak also operates a shuttle service between New Haven and [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], servicing Hartford and other towns on the corridor.

====Bus====
Statewide [[bus]] service is supplied by [[Connecticut Transit]], owned by the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]], with smaller municipal authorities providing local service. Bus networks are an important part of the transportation system in Connecticut, especially in urban areas like Hartford, Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport and New Haven. A three-year construction project to build a [[bus rapid transit|BRT]] [[New Britain–Hartford Busway|busway from New Britain to Hartford]] began in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New Britain-to-Hartford ‘Busway’ Receives Final Federal Design Approval |publisher=State of Connecticut |date=2006-10-31 |url=http://www.ct.gov/governorrell/cwp/view.asp?Q=326626&amp;A=2425 |accessdate=2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctrapidtransit.com/ct_schedule.asp |title=New Britain-Hartford Rapid Transit Project Schedule |publisher=Ctrapidtransit.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Air====
[[Bradley International Airport]] is located in [[Windsor Locks]], 15&amp;nbsp;miles (24&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. Regional air service is provided at [[Tweed New Haven Regional Airport]]. Larger civil airports include [[Danbury Municipal Airport]] and [[Waterbury-Oxford Airport]] in western Connecticut. [[Sikorsky Memorial Airport]] is located in Stratford and mostly services cargo, helicopter and private aviation. The [[Westchester County Airport]] in [[Harrison, New York]] serves much of southwestern Connecticut.

===Constitutional history===
{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}
Connecticut is known as the &quot;Constitution State&quot;. While the origin on this title is uncertain, the nickname is assumed to refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638–39. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal [[government]] written by a representative body in Connecticut. The government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of [[Connecticut Constitutional History]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.

Separate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.
Another possible source of the nickname &quot;constitution state&quot; comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution.

===Executive===
The governor heads the executive branch. [[Dan Malloy]] is the current [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]] and [[Nancy Wyman]] it is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]], both are Democrats. Malloy, the former mayor of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], won the [[Connecticut gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 general election]] for Governor, and was sworn in on January 5, 2011. From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. Connecticut was the first state in the United States to elect a woman as governor without electing her husband first, [[Ella Grasso]] in 1974.

There are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, Developmental Services, Education, Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Information Technology, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Safety, Public Utility Control, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs. In addition to these departments, there are other independent bureaus, offices and commissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ct.gov/ctportal/cwp/view.asp?a=843&amp;q=246450| title=Connecticut's Executive Branch of Government| publisher=ct.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, there are four other executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters: Secretary of the State, Treasurer, Comptroller and Attorney General. All executive officers are elected to four year terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;/&gt;

===Legislative===
The [[legislature]] is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;/&gt; Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Senators and representatives, all of whom must be at least 18 years of age, are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, except when absent from the chamber, when the [[President pro tempore]] presides. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] presides over the House; [[Chris Donovan]] is the current Speaker of the House of Connecticut.

Connecticut's U.S. senators are [[Richard Blumenthal]] (Democrat) and [[Joseph I. Lieberman]] ([[Connecticut for Lieberman]], [[Independent Democrat]]) who is part of the Democratic Caucus. Connecticut currently has five [[U.S. Congressional Delegations from Connecticut|representatives in the U.S. House]], all of whom are Democrats. Connecticut and [[Vermont]] remain the only two states with Independent Senators.

===Judicial===
The highest [[court]] of Connecticut's judicial branch is the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]], headed by the Chief Justice of Connecticut. The Supreme Court is responsible for deciding on the constitutionality of the law or cases as they relate to the law. Its proceedings are similar to those of the United States Supreme Court, with no testimony given by witnesses, and the lawyers of the two sides each present oral arguments no longer than thirty minutes. Following a court proceeding, the court may take several months to arrive at a judgment. The current [[Chief Justice]] is [[Chase T. Rogers]].

In 1818, the court became a separate entity, independent of the legislative and executive branches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jud.state.ct.us/ystday/history.html History of the Connecticut Courts]. Last retrieved 2007-02-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Appellate Court is a lesser state-wide court and the Superior Courts are lower courts that resemble county courts of other states.

===Local government===

Connecticut has 169 [[New England town|towns]], which serve as the fundamental local political subdivision of the state; the entire state is divided into towns.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;/&gt; Connecticut shares a local form of government with the rest of [[New England]] called the [[New England town]]. There are also 21 cities,&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;/&gt; most of which are coterminous with their namesake towns and have a merged city-town government. There are two exceptions: [[Groton (city), Connecticut|City of Groton]], which is a subsection of the [[Groton (town), Connecticut|Town of Groton]] and the City of [[Winsted, Connecticut|Winsted]] in the Town of [[Winchester, Connecticut|Winchester]]. There are also nine incorporated [[Borough (Connecticut)|boroughs]] which may provide additional services to a section of town.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cslib.org/boroughcity.htm Connecticut's Boroughs and Cities].

Unlike most other states, Connecticut does not have [[County (United States)|county]] government. Connecticut county governments were mostly eliminated in 1960, with the exception of [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriffs]] elected in each county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/RegisterManual/SectionVI/SecVICounty.htm |title= Connecticut State Register and Manual: Counties |accessdate=2006-11-07| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061010172922/http://www.sots.ct.gov/RegisterManual/SectionVI/SecVICounty.htm| archivedate = October 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the county sheriff was abolished and replaced with the [[Connecticut State Marshal|state marshal]] system, which has districts that follow the old county territories. The judicial system is divided, at the trial court level, into judicial districts which largely follow the old county lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jud.ct.gov/directory/directory/location/Default.htm |title=State of Connecticut Judicial Branch |publisher=Jud.ct.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[list of Connecticut counties|eight counties]] are still widely used for purely geographical and statistical purposes, such as [[Weather forecasting|weather reports]], and census reporting.

The state is divided into 15 [[Administrative divisions of Connecticut#Regions|planning regions]] defined by the state Office of Planning and Management.&lt;ref name=&quot;OPM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Enter your Company or Top-Level Office |url=http://www.ct.gov/opm/cwp/view.asp?a=2985&amp;q=383124 |title=Regional Planning Coordination at the CT Office of Planning and Management |publisher=Ct.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Intragovernmental Policy Division of this Office coordinates regional planning with the administrative bodies of these regions. Each region has an administrative body known as either a regional council of governments, a regional council of elected officials, or a regional planning agency. The regions are established for the purpose of planning &quot;coordination of regional and state planning activities; redesignation of logical planning regions and promotion of the continuation of regional planning organizations within the state; and provision for technical aid and the administration of financial assistance to regional planning organizations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OPM&quot;/&gt;

===Same-sex marriage===

Currently, Connecticut leans strongly towards the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. However, Connecticut has a high percentage of voters who are not registered with a major party. As of 2004, 33.7% of registered voters were registered Democratic, 22.0% were registered Republican, and 44.0% were unaffiliated with any party, with 0.2% registered with a minor party&lt;!-- editor's note: figures do not add up to 100% due to rounding errors --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sots.ct.gov/ElectionsServices/election_results/statistics/enrolhst.pdf Party Enrollment in Connecticut]. Connecticut Office of the Secretary of State. Last retrieved 2007-02-22. {{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Connecticut towns show a marked preference for moderate candidates of either party. The state's Republican-leaning areas are the rural [[Litchfield County, Connecticut|Litchfield County]] and adjoining towns in the west of [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford County]], the industrial towns of the [[Naugatuck River Valley]], and some of the affluent [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] towns near the New York border.

The suburban towns of [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]] and [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] in Fairfield County are considered the most Republican areas in the state. [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], a wealthy town a few miles to the east, is often considered one of the most loyally-Democratic, liberal towns in Fairfield County. The historically Republican-leaning wealthy town of [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]] voted in the majority for [[Barack Obama]] in the 2008 Presidential Election. [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], two larger, affluent communities in Fairfield County, have in many elections favored moderate Republicans including former Governor [[John G. Rowland]] and former Congressman [[Chris Shays]], however they have favored Democrats in recent US presidential election years, with Shays being defeated by Democrat [[Jim Himes]] in the 2008 election.

[[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] has a Democratic registration edge, but usually favors conservative candidates in both parties. In [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] unaffiliated voters outnumber voters registered with either major party. Other smaller cities including [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] and [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]] favor Democratic candidates.

In July, 2009 the Connecticut legislature overrode a veto by Governor [[M. Jodi Rell]] to pass [[SustiNet]], the first significant public-option health care reform legislation in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarp.org/states/ct/advocacy/articles/in_historic_vote_legislature_overrides_sustinet_veto.html ]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, Democrats controlled all five federal congressional seats. The remaining Republican, [[Chris Shays]], lost his seat to Democrat Jim Himes in the Congressional Election in 2008. [[Joseph Lieberman]] and [[Richard Blumenthal]] are Connecticut's [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]]. The junior Blumenthal is a Democrat while the senior Lieberman serves as an [[Independent Democrat]] caucusing with Senate Democrats after his victory on the [[Connecticut for Lieberman]] ballot line in the 2006 general election.

Lieberman's predecessor, [[Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.]], was the last Connecticut Republican to serve as Senator. Weicker was known as a liberal Republican. He broke with President [[Richard Nixon]] during [[Watergate Scandal|Watergate]] and successfully ran for governor in 1990 as an independent, creating [[A Connecticut Party]] as his election vehicle. Before Weicker, the last [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to represent Connecticut in the Senate was [[Prescott Bush]], the father of former President [[George H.W. Bush]] and the grandfather of former President [[George W. Bush]]. He served from 1953–1963.

{{See also|Professional ice hockey in Connecticut}}
Connecticut has been the home to multiple teams in the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|big four sports leagues]], though currently hosts none. Connecticut's longest-tenured and only modern full-time &quot;big four&quot; franchise were the [[Hartford Whalers]] of the [[National Hockey League]], who played in Hartford from 1979 to 1997 at the [[Hartford Civic Center]]. Their departure to [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], over disputes with the state over the construction of a new arena, caused great controversy and resentment. The former Whalers are now known as the [[Carolina Hurricanes]].

Connecticut has hosted teams from the other big four leagues at various times. The [[Hartford Dark Blues]] joined the [[National League]] for one season in 1876, becoming the state's first and only [[major league baseball]] franchise. In 1926, Hartford had a franchise in the [[National Football League]] known as the [[Hartford Blues]]. The NFL would return to Connecticut from 1973-1974 when New Haven hosted the [[New York Giants]] at [[Yale Bowl]] while [[Giants Stadium]] was under construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryNYG&quot;&gt;[http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/nyg/nygiants.html History of the New York Giants], www.sportsecyclopedia.com. Retrieved September 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1975 to 1995, the [[Boston Celtics]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] played a number of home games at the Hartford Civic Center.
[[File:Yale-Harvard-Game.jpg|285px|right|thumb|Yale Bowl during &quot;[[Harvard-Yale football games (The Game)|The Game]]&quot; between Yale and [[Harvard]]. The Bowl was also the home of the [[NFL]]'s [[New York Giants]] from 1973-1974.]]

The [[Connecticut Sun]] of the [[WNBA]] currently play at the [[Mohegan Sun Arena]] in [[Uncasville]]. From 1996 to 1998, Connecticut was home to another professional woman's basketball team, [[American Basketball League (1996–1998)|American Basketball League]] franchise the [[New England Blizzard]], who played at the Hartford Civic Center

The [[UConn Huskies]] play [[NCAA Division I]] sports and are popular in the state. Both the [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|men's basketball]] and [[Connecticut Huskies women's basketball|women's basketball teams]] have won multiple national championships, including in 2004, when UConn became the first school in NCAA Division I history to have its men's and women's basketball programs win the national title in the same year. The [[UConn Huskies football team]] has played in the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] since 2002, and has played in four bowl games since. Other Connecticut universities which feature Division I sports teams include [[Yale Bulldogs|Yale University]], [[Quinnipiac Bobcats|Quinnipiac University]], [[Fairfield Stags|Fairfield University]], [[Central Connecticut State University]], [[Sacred Heart University]], and the [[Hartford Hawks|University of Hartford]]. Several [[United States Coast Guard Academy#Athletics|United States Coast Guard Academy]] teams compete in Division I as well.

New Haven biannually hosts &quot;[[Harvard-Yale football games (The Game)|The Game]]&quot; between Yale and [[Harvard]], the country's second-oldest college football rivalry. Yale alum [[Walter Camp]], deemed the &quot;Father of American Football,&quot; helped develop modern football while living in New Haven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegefootball.org/famer_selected.php?id=88004 College Football Hall of Fame || Famer Search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartford has hosted two [[Arena Football League]] franchises, in the [[Connecticut Coyotes]] from 1995–1996 and the [[New England Sea Wolves]] from 1999–2000, both playing at the Civic Center. Hartford is currently home to the [[Hartford Colonials]] of the [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]].

Connecticut is a battleground between fans of the [[New York Yankees]], [[Boston Red Sox]], and [[New York Mets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/18/sports/baseball/18fans.html?ei=5088&amp;en=6f3f651e40bd2179&amp;ex=1313553600&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | title=Where Do Rivals Draw the Line? | first=John | last=Branch | date=2006-08-18 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Mets and Red Sox, split allegiances among fans of both teams in the state during the [[1986 World Series]] led to an article in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' to coin the phrase &quot;Red Sox Nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball Border War; In Milford Conn., Geography Brings Sox and Mets Fans|date=October 20, 1986|first=Nathan|last=Cobb|newspaper=Boston Globe|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state hosts several major sporting events. Since 1952, a [[PGA Tour]] golf tournament has been played in the Hartford area. Originally called the &quot;Insurance City Open&quot; and later the &quot;Greater Hartford Open,&quot; the event is now known as the [[Travelers Championship]]. The [[Pilot Pen Tennis]] tournament is held annually in the [[Cullman-Heyman Tennis Center]] at Yale University in New Haven. [[Lime Rock Park]] is a motorsport track home of [[American Le Mans Series]], Grand-Am [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] and [[NASCAR Camping World East Series]] races.

The [[Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference (CIAC)]] is the state's sanctioning body for high school sports.

The '''Northern Territory Country Liberal Party''' (CLP) is a [[Northern Territory]] political party&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registered_parties/ntclp.htm NT Country Liberal Party], ''Current Register of Political Parties'' [[Australian Electoral Commission]], 29 May 2009. Retrieved 17 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; affiliated with both the [[National Party of Australia|National]] (formerly &quot;Country&quot;) and [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] parties. It is a member of the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clp.org.au/ |title=Country Liberal Party |publisher=Clp.org.au |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CLP dominated the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] from its establishment in 1978 to 2001, but lost Government in 2001 and was reduced to four parliamentary members in 2005. At the 9 August 2008 [[Northern Territory general election, 2008|Legislative Assembly general election]] it gained a significant swing, gaining 11 out of the 25 [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] seats.

[[Australian Senate|Senator]] [[Nigel Scullion]] and [[Division of Solomon|Solomon]] [[Australian House of Representatives|MP]] [[Natasha Griggs]] are the CLP's only two representatives in federal parliament. Scullion is the deputy leader of the National Party and sits with the National Party in the Senate.

==History==
{{update|date=November 2010}}

The Country Liberal Party (CLP) was established in the [[Northern Territory]] in 1974. The territory  [[Country Party]] members first contested the [[Australian federal election, 1919|1919 federal election]], with an established federal Country Party contesting the [[Australian federal election, 1922|1922 federal election]]. The 1922 election saw the main anti-Labor party, the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] deprived of a majority, and were required to form a coalition in order to command a majority on the floor of parliament. The price for such support was the resignation of Nationalist (ex-Labor) Prime Minister, [[Billy Hughes]], who was replaced by [[Stanley Bruce]].

In 1966, the Country Party was established in the territory, while the Liberal Party was small. In recognition of this, the local Liberals supported the Country Party candidate for the sole NT seat from 1969 to 1972. An alliance had formed, primarily against the conservatives' arch-rivals the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP).

After the [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974 federal election]] and subsequent [[Joint Sitting, Australian parliament, 1974|Joint Sitting of parliament]], legislation was passed to create a [[unicameral]] [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]], as well as members with full voting rights at a federal level. The local Country and Liberal Party members decided to form an independent &quot;Country Liberal Party&quot; (CLP) to field candidates for the Legislative Council in 1974.

Northern Territory Self-Government occurred on 1 July 1978.

In 1979, the CLP formally affiliated with both the then-National Country Party and Liberal Party. These affiliations remain to this day, and relations with both parties are close. However, the CLP has had no major opportunities to sway the actions of either.

Both the Nationals and Liberals receive Country Liberal Party delegations, and the party president has full voting rights with the National Party and observer status with the Liberal Party. The party also directs its federal members and senators as to which of the two other parties they should sit with in the parliamentary chamber. The CLP vote is often tabulated together with either of its coalition partners in many election results tables, or included within a single Coalition vote.

==The CLP in Northern Territory Politics==
The CLP has contested Northern Territory Legislative Assembly elections since 1974. General elections were held in  [[Northern Territory general election, 1974|1974]], [[Northern Territory general election, 1977|1977]], [[Northern Territory general election, 1980|1980]], [[Northern Territory general election, 1983|1983]], [[Northern Territory general election, 1987|1987]],  [[Northern Territory general election, 1990|1990]], [[Northern Territory general election, 1994|1994]], [[Northern Territory general election, 1997|1997]], [[Northern Territory general election, 2001|2001]], [[Northern Territory general election, 2005|2005]] and [[Northern Territory general election, 2008|2008]].

The CLP won control of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly at every election until 2001, when the ALP won. The loss marked a major turning point in Northern Territory politics, a result which was exacerbated when, at the [[Northern Territory general election, 2005|2005 NT election]], the ALP won a second landslide victory, reducing the once-dominant party to a total of just four members in the Legislative Assembly.

The Legislative Assembly general election held on 9 August 2008 saw the CLP reverse its earlier election losses, increasing its representation from four to 11 members.

The CLP has also contested many Legislative Assembly [[List of Northern Territory by-elections|by-elections]].

'''Canon law''' is the body of laws and regulations made or adopted by ecclesiastical authority, for the government of the Christian organization and its members. It is the internal [[ecclesiastical]] law governing the [[Catholic Church]] (both [[Latin Rite]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]), the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches, and the [[Anglican Communion]] of churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09056a.htm|title=Canon law|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way that such church law is [[legislative power|legislated]], interpreted and at times [[court|adjudicated]] varies widely among these three bodies of churches. In all three traditions, a canon was initially a rule adopted by a [[ecumenical council|council]]; these canons formed the foundation of canon law. Etymology: [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kanon'' / κανών, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] Qanon / قانون, [[Hebrew]] kaneh / קנה, &quot;straight&quot;; a rule, code, standard, or measure; the root meaning in all these languages, including [[Latin]], is &quot;reed.&quot;  

==Canons of the Apostles==
{{main|Canons of the Apostles}}
The ''Apostolic Canons''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03279a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Apostolic Canons|publisher=New Advent|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Ecclesiastical Canons of the Same Holy Apostles''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/ecf/007/0070471.htm|title=The Ecclesiastical Canons of the Same Holy Apostles|publisher=Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol VII|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a collection of ancient ecclesiastical decrees (eighty-five in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]], fifty in the [[Roman Catholicism|Western]] Church) concerning the government and discipline of the [[Early Christian]] Church, incorporated with the [[Apostolic Constitutions]] which are part of the [[Ante-Nicene Fathers]]

==Catholic Church==
{{Canon Law}}{{main|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}
[[File:Extract from Burchard of Worms' Decretum.jpg |thumb|left|300px|Image of pages from ''Burchard of Worms' Decretum'', the 11th c. book of Canon Law.]]

The [[Catholic Church]] has the oldest continuously functioning legal system in [[Western world| Western Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://canonlaw.info Canon Law @Canonlaw.info]&lt;/ref&gt; predating the common and European [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] traditions.  What began with rules (&quot;canons&quot;) adopted by the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] at the [[Council of Jerusalem]] in the 1st century has blossomed into a highly complex and original legal system encapsulating not just norms of the [[New Testament]], but some elements of the [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] ([[Old Testament]]), [[Roman law|Roman]], [[Visigoths|Visigothic]], [[Saxon people|Saxon]], and [[Celt]]ic legal traditions spanning thousands of years of human experience.   

In the Roman Church, positive ecclesiastical laws, based upon either immutable divine and [[natural law]], or changeable circumstantial and merely [[positive law]], derive formal authority and promulgation from the pope, who as [[Supreme Pontiff]] possesses the totality of legislative, executive, and judicial power in his person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P16.HTM Canon 331], [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual subject material of the canons is not just doctrinal or moral in nature, but indeed all-encompassing of the human condition.

In the [[Early Christianity|early Church]], the first canons were decreed by [[bishop]]s united in &quot;[[Ecumenical councils|Ecumenical]]&quot; councils (the Emperor summoning all of the known world's bishops to attend with at least the acknowledgement of the [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]]) or &quot;local&quot; councils (bishops of a region or territory).  Over time, these canons were supplemented with [[decretal]]s of the Bishops of Rome, which were responses to doubts or problems according to the maxim, &quot;''Roma locuta est, causa finita est''&quot; (&quot;Rome has spoken, case is closed&quot;).  

Later, they were gathered together into collections, both unofficial and official.  The first truly systematic collection was assembled by the [[Camaldolese]] monk [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] in the 11th century, commonly known as the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'' (&quot;Gratian's Decree&quot;).  [[Pope]] [[Gregory IX]] is credited with promulgating the first official collection of canons called the ''Decretalia Gregorii Noni'' or ''Liber Extra'' (1234).  This was followed by the ''Liber Sextus'' (1298) of [[Boniface VIII]], the ''Clementines'' (1317) of [[Clement V]], the ''[[Extravagantes Joannis XXII]]'' and the ''[[Extravagantes Communes]]'', all of which followed the same structure as the Liber Extra.  All these collections, with the [[Decretum Gratiani]], are together referred to as the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]''. After the completion of the ''Corpus Juris Canonici'', subsequent [[papal]] legislation was published in periodic volumes called ''[[Bullarium|Bullaria]]''.

By the 19th Century, this body of legislation included some 10,000 norms. Many these were difficult to reconcile with one another due to changes in circumstances and practice.  This situation impelled [[Pope St. Pius X]] to order the creation of the first [[Code of Canon Law]], a single volume of clearly stated laws.  Under the aegis of the Cardinal [[Pietro Gasparri]], the Commission for the Codification of Canon Law was completed under [[Benedict XV]], who promulgated the Code, effective in 1918.  The work having been begun by [[Pius X]], it was sometimes called the &quot;Pio-Benedictine Code&quot; but more often the 1917 Code.  In its preparation, centuries of material was examined, scrutinized for authenticity by leading experts, and harmonized as much as possible with opposing canons and even other Codes, from the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex of Justinian]] to the [[Napoleonic Code]].
[[File:CIC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cover of the ''1917 Code of Canon Law '' .]]
[[Pope John XXIII]] initially called for a [[Synod]] of the Diocese of Rome, an [[Ecumenical Council]], and an updating to the 1917 Code.  After the [[Second Vatican Council|Second Ecumenical Council]] of the Vatican (Vatican II) closed in 1965, it became apparent that the Code would need to be revised in light of the documents and theology of Vatican II.  After multiple drafts and many years of discussion, [[Pope John Paul II]] promulgated the revised [[Code of Canon Law]] (CIC) in 1983. Containing 1752 canons, it is the law currently binding on the Latin (western) Roman Church.

The canon law of the Eastern Catholic Churches, which had developed some different disciplines and practices, underwent its own process of codification, resulting in the [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]] promulgated in 1990 by [[Pope John Paul II]].
The institutions and practices of canon law paralleled the legal development of much of Europe, and consequently both modern [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] and [[Common law]] bear the influences of canon law.  Edson Luiz Sampel, a Brazilian expert in canon law, says that canon law is contained in the genesis of various institutes of civil law, such as the law in continental Europe and Latin American countries. Sampel explains that canon law has significant influence in contemporary society.

Currently, all Latin-Rite Catholic seminary students are expected to take courses in canon law (c. 252.3).  Some ecclesiastical officials are required to have the doctorate ([[JCD]]) or at least the licentiate ([[Licentiate of Canon Law|JCL]]) in canon law in order to fulfill their functions:  Judicial Vicars (c. 1419.1), Judges (c. 1421.3), Promoters of Justice (c. 1435), Defenders of the Bond (c. 1435).  In addition, [[Vicars General]] and Episcopal Vicars are to be doctors or at least licensed in canon law or theology (c. 478.1), and canonical advocates must either have the doctorate or be truly expert in canon law (c. 1483).  Ordinarily, Bishops are to have advanced degrees in sacred scripture, theology, or canon law (c. 378.1.5). St. [[Raymond of Penyafort]] (1175-1275), a Spanish Dominican priest, is the patron saint of canonists, due to his important contributions to the science of Canon Law.

== Orthodox Churches ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[New Testament]] --&gt;

The Greek-speaking Orthodox have collected canons and commentaries upon them in a work known as the ''Pēdálion'' (Greek: Πηδάλιον, &quot;Rudder&quot;), so named because it is meant to &quot;steer&quot; the Church. The Orthodox Christian tradition in general treats its canons more as guidelines than as laws, the [[economy (Eastern Orthodox Church)|bishops adjusting them]] to cultural and other local circumstances. Some Orthodox canon scholars point out that, had the [[Ecumenical Councils]] (which deliberated in Greek) meant for the canons to be used as laws, they would have called them ''nómoi/νόμοι'' (laws) rather than ''kanónes/κανόνες'' (rules), but almost all Orthodox conform to them. The dogmatic decisions of the Councils, though, are to be obeyed rather than to be treated as guidelines, since they are essential for the Church's unity.

== Anglican Communion ==
{{main|Canon law (Anglican Communion)}}

In the [[Church of England]], the [[ecclesiastical court]]s that formerly decided many matters such as disputes relating to marriage, divorce, wills, and defamation, still have jurisdiction of certain church-related matters (e.g., discipline of clergy, alteration of church property, and issues related to churchyards).  Their separate status dates back to the 12th century when the [[Normans]] split them off from the mixed secular/religious county and local courts used by the Saxons. In contrast to the other [[court]]s of England the law used in ecclesiastical matters is at least partially a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, not [[common law]], although heavily governed by parliamentary statutes.  Since the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], ecclesiastical courts in England have been royal courts.  The teaching of canon law at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge was abrogated by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]; thereafter practitioners in the [[ecclesiastical courts]] were trained in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], receiving a [[Doctor of Civil Law]] (D.C.L.) degree from Oxford, or an [[Doctor of Laws|LL.D.]] from Cambridge.  Such lawyers (called &quot;doctors&quot; and &quot;civilians&quot;) were centred at &quot;[[Doctors' Commons|Doctors Commons]]&quot;, a few streets south of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]], where they monopolized [[probate]], matrimonial, and [[Admiralty law|admiralty]] cases until their jurisdiction was removed to the [[common law]] courts in the mid-19th century.  (Admiralty law was also based on civil law instead of common law, thus was handled by the civilians too.)
[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] repealed Canon Law in 1638 after uprisings of [[Covenanter]]s confronting the Bishops of Aberdeen following the convention at [[Muchalls Castle]] and other revolts across [[Scotland]] earlier that year.

Other churches in the [[Anglican Communion]] around the world (e.g., the [[Episcopal Church in the United States]], and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]]) still function under their own private systems of canon law.

==Presbyterian and Reformed Churches==
{{main|Presbyterian polity}}
In Presbyterian and Reformed Churches, canon law is known as &quot;practice and procedure&quot; or  &quot;church order,&quot; and includes the church's laws respecting its government, discipline, legal practice and worship.

==Lutheranism==   
The [[Book of Concord]] is the historic [[doctrinal statement]] of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]], consisting of ten [[creed|credal]] documents recognized as authoritative in [[Lutheranism]] since the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;F. Bente, ed. and trans., ''Concordia Triglotta'', (St. Louis: [[Concordia Publishing House]], 1921), p. i&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Book of Concord is a confessional document (stating orthodox belief) rather than a book of ecclesiastical rules or discipline, like canon law.  Each Lutheran national church establishes its own system of church order and discipline, though these are referred to as &quot;canons.&quot;

==The United Methodist Church==

The [[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)|Book of Discipline]] contains the laws, rules, policies and guidelines for The United Methodist Church.  Its last edition was published in 2008.

'''Saint Columbanus''' (540&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 23 November 615; {{lang-ga|'''Columban'''}}, meaning ''the white dove''.) was an [[Irish missionary]] notable for founding a number of [[monastery|monasteries]] on the European continent from around 590 in the [[Franks|Frankish]] and [[Lombards|Lombard]] kingdoms, most notably [[Luxeuil Abbey|Luxeuil]] (in present-day France) and [[Bobbio Abbey|Bobbio]] (Italy), and stands as an exemplar of Irish missionary activity in early medieval Europe.

He spread among the Franks a [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic]] monastic rule and Celtic penitential practices for those repenting of sins, which emphasized private confession to a priest, followed by penances levied by the priest in reparation for the sin. He is also one of the earliest identifiable [[Hiberno-Latin]] writers.

St. Columbanus is the patron saint of motorcyclists and is the favored saint of the [[Columban Fathers]], a missionary society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://columban.org Official website of the Columban Fathers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Columbanus (the Latinised form of Columbán)was born in [[Nobber]], [[County Meath]], [[Ireland]], in the year [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]] died, and from childhood was well instructed. His name may be looked on as the diminutive of &quot;Colm&quot; (a dove), or as Colm (Colum) Bán meaning the 'white dove'.He was handsome and prepossessing in appearance. Young Colum's striking looks exposed him to the shameless temptations of several of his countrywomen, so that he had to struggle with his own temptations. At last he went to see a religious woman, who advised him thus: &quot;Twelve years ago I fled from the world, and shut myself up in this cell. Hast thou forgotten [[Samson]], [[David (biblical king)|David]] and [[Solomon]], all led astray by the love of women? There is no safety for thee, young man, except in flight.&quot;
He thereupon decided to act upon this advice and retire from the world.

He encountered opposition, especially from his mother, who strove to detain him by casting herself before him on the threshold of the door. But conquering the feelings of nature, he passed over her prostrate form and left his home forever. His first master was Sinell, Abbot of [[Cluaninis]] in [[Lough Erne]]. The Irish words &quot;Cluan Innish&quot;, which mean &quot;meadow and island&quot;, have been contracted to &quot;Cleenish&quot;, where the remains of the monastery can be seen at [[Bellanaleck]], [[County Fermanagh]]. Under Sinell's instruction, Columbanus composed a commentary on the [[Psalms]] (for another identification, see [[Mo Sinu moccu Min]]).

He then moved to the celebrated monastery of [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] on the coast of Down, which at that time had for its abbot [[St. Comgall]]. There Columbanus embraced the monastic state, and for many years led a life conspicuous for fervour, regularity and learning. At about the age of 40 he seemed to hear incessantly the voice of God bidding him to preach the [[Gospel]] in foreign lands. At first his abbot declined to let him go, but at length he consented.

Columbanus set sail with twelve companions; their names are believed to be [[St. Attala]], Columbanus the Younger, Cummain, Domgal ([[Deicolus]]?), Eogain, [[Eunan]], [[St. Gall]], Gurgano, Libran, Lua, Sigisbert and Waldoleno (Strokes, &quot;Apennines&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;112). This little band passed over to Britain, landing probably on the Scottish coast. Some contend they may have landed in and crossed [[Cornwall]] enroute to [[Brittany]]. They remained only a short time in England and then crossed over to France, where they arrived probably in 585. The landing site of Columbanus is marked by a shrine at Carnac in Brittany. At once, they began their apostolic mission.

Wherever they went, the people were struck by their modesty, patience and humility. France at that period was in sore need of such a band of monks and preachers. Owing partly to the incursions of barbarians, and partly due to the remissness of the clergy, vice and impiety were prevalent.

He and his followers soon made their way to the court of [[Gontram, King of Burgundy]]. [[Jonas]] calls it the court of Sigisbert, King of Austrasia and Burgundy, but this is manifestly a blunder, for Sigisbert had been slain in 575. The fame of Columbanus had preceded him. Gontram gave him a gracious reception, inviting him to remain in his kingdom. The saint complied, and selected for his abode the half-ruined Roman fortress at [[Annegray]] in the solitudes of the [[Vosges]] mountains.

Here the abbot and his monks led the simplest of lives, their food often consisting of nothing but forest herbs, berries, and the bark of young trees. The fame of Columbanus's sanctity drew crowds to his monastery. Many, both nobles and rustics, asked to be admitted into the community. Sick persons came to be cured through their prayers. But Columbanus loved solitude. Often he would withdraw to a cave seven miles distant, with a single companion who acted as messenger between himself and his brethren.

After a few years, the ever-increasing number of his disciples obliged him to build another monastery. Columbanus accordingly obtained from King Gontram the Gallo-Roman castle named &quot;Luxovium&quot; ([[Luxeuil-les-Bains|Luxeuil]]), some eight miles distant from Annegray. It was in a wild district, thickly covered with pine forests and brushwood. This foundation of the celebrated [[Luxeuil Abbey]] took place in 590.

But these two monasteries did not suffice for the numbers who came, and a third had to be erected at [[Fontaines]]. The superiors of these houses always remained subordinate to Columbanus. It is said that at this time he instituted a perpetual service of praise, known as ''[[laus perennis]]'', by which choir succeeded choir, both day and night (Montalembert, Monks of the West II, 405). He wrote his Rule for these flourishing communities, which embodied the customs of Bangor and other Celtic monasteries.

For nearly 20 years Columbanus resided in France and, during that time, observed the unreformed [[paschal computation]]. But a dispute arose. The Frankish bishops were not well disposed towards this stranger abbot, because of his ever-increasing influence, and at last they showed their hostility. They objected to his [[Celtic Easter]] and his exclusion of men as well as women from the precincts of his monasteries.

The councils of [[Gaul]] held in the first half of the sixth century had given to bishops absolute authority over religious communities, even going so far as to order the abbots to appear periodically before their respective bishops to receive reproof or advice, as might be considered necessary. These enactments, being contrary to the custom of the Celtic monasteries, were readily rejected by Columbanus. In 602 the bishops assembled to judge him. He did not appear, lest, as he tells us, &quot;he might contend in words&quot;, but instead addressed a letter to the prelates in which he speaks with a strange mixture of freedom, reverence, and charity. In it he admonishes them to hold synods more frequently, and advises that they pay attention to matters equally important with that of the date of Easter.

As to his paschal cycle he says: &quot;I am not the author of this divergence. I came as a poor stranger into these parts for the cause of Christ, Our Saviour. One thing alone I ask of you, holy Fathers, permit me to live in silence in these forests, near the bones of 17 of my brethren now dead.&quot; When the Frankish bishops still insisted the abbot was wrong in obedience to St. Patrick's canon, he laid the question before the Pope [[St. Gregory I]]. He dispatched two letters to that pontiff, but they never reached him, &quot;through Satan's intervention&quot;.

The third letter is extant, but no trace of an answer appears in St. Gregory's correspondence, owing probably to the fact that the pope died in 604, about the time it reached Rome. In this letter he defended the Celtic custom with considerable freedom but the tone is affectionate. He prays &quot;the holy Pope, his Father&quot;, to direct towards him &quot;the strong support of his authority, to transmit the verdict of his favour&quot;. Moreover, he apologizes &quot;for presuming to argue, as it were, with him who sits in the chair of Peter, Apostle and Bearer of the Keys&quot;.

He directed another epistle to Pope [[Boniface IV]], in which he prays that, if it be not contrary to the Faith, he confirm the tradition of his elders, so that by the papal decision (''judicium'') he and his monks may be enabled to follow the rites of their ancestors. Before Pope Boniface's answer (which has been lost) was given, Columbanus was outside the jurisdiction of the Frankish bishops. As we hear no further accusation on the Easter question—not even in those brought against his successor at Luxeuil Abbey, [[Eustasius of Luxeuil]] in 624—it would appear that after Columbanus had moved to Italy, he gave up the Celtic Easter (cf. Acta SS. O.S.B., II, p.&amp;nbsp;7).

In addition to the Easter question, Columbanus had to wage war against vice in the royal household. The young [[Theuderic II|Theodoric]], to whose kingdom Luxeuil belonged, was living a life of debauchery. He was completely in the hands of his grandmother, Queen Brunehault (Brunehild). On the death of King Gontram, the succession passed to his nephew, [[Childebert II]], son of Brunehault. At his death the latter left two sons, [[Theodebert II]] and Thierry II, both minors. Theodebert succeeded to Austrasia, Thierry to Burgundy, but Brunehault constituted herself their guardian, and held in her own power the governments of the two kingdoms.

As she advanced in years she sacrificed everything to the passion of sovereignty, she encouraged Thierry in the practice of concubinage in order that there might be no rival queen. Thierry, however, had a veneration for Columbanus, and often visited him. On these occasions the saint admonished and rebuked him, but in vain. Brunehault became enraged with Columbanus, stirred up the bishops and nobles to find fault with his Rules regarding monastic enclosure. Finally, Thierry and his party went to Luxeuil and ordered the abbot to conform to the usages of the country. Columbanus refused, whereupon he was taken prisoner to [[Count of Besançon|Besançon]] to await further orders.

Taking advantage of the absence of restraint, he speedily returned to his monastery. On hearing this, Thierry and Brunehault sent soldiers to drive him back to Ireland. None but Irish monks were to accompany him. Accordingly, he was hurried to [[Nevers]], made to embark on the [[Loire]], and thus proceed to Nantes. At [[Tours]] he visited the tomb of [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]] and sent a message to Thierry predicting that, within three years, he and his children would perish. At Nantes, before the embarkation, he addressed a letter to his monks, full of affection. It is a memorial of the love and tenderness which existed in that otherwise austere and passionate soul.

In it he desires all to obey Attala, whom he requests to abide with the community unless strife should arise on the Easter question. His letter concludes thus &quot;They come to tell me the ship is ready. The end of my parchment compels me to finish my letter. Love is not orderly; it is this which has made it confused. Farewell, dear hearts of mine; pray for me that I may live in God.&quot; As soon as they set sail, such a storm arose that ship was driven ashore. The captain would have nothing more to do with these holy men; they were thus free to go where they pleased. Columbanus made his way to the friendly King Clothaire at [[Soissons]] in Neustria where he was gladly welcomed. Clothaire in vain pressed him to remain in his territory.

Columbanus left Neustria in 611 for the court of King Theodebert of [[Austrasia]]. At [[Metz]] he received an honourable welcome, and then proceeding to [[Mainz]], he embarked upon the Rhine in order to reach the Suevi and Alamanni, to whom he wished to preach the Gospel. Ascending the river and its tributaries, the [[Aar]] and the [[Limmat]], he came to the [[Lake of Zürich]]. [[Tuggen]] was chosen as a centre from which to evangelize, but the work was not successful.

Instead of producing fruit, the zeal of Columbanus only excited persecution. In despair he resolved to pass on by way of Arbon to Bregenz on Lake Constance, where there were still some traces of Christianity. Here the saint found an [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] dedicated to St. Aurelia, into which the people had brought three brass images of their tutelary deities. He commanded [[Saint Gall]], who knew the language, to preach to the inhabitants, and many were converted. The images were destroyed, and Columbanus blessed the little church, placing the relics of St. Aurelia beneath the altar. A monastery was erected, and the brethren forthwith observed their regular life.

Columbanus is reported to have performed a miracle in [[Bregenz]]: The townpeople had placed a large vessel in the town center, filled with beer. They told Columbanus it was intended as a sacrifice to their god [[Wodan]] (''Illi aiunt se Deo suo Vodano nomine''), whom they identified with Roman [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. Angrily, Columbanus breathed on the vessel, which broke asunder with a loud noise, spilling the beer. After about a year, in consequence of another rising against the community, Columbanus resolved to cross the Alps into Italy. An additional reason for his departure was the fact that the arms of Thierry had prevailed against Theodebert, and thus the country on the banks of the Upper Rhine had become the property of his enemy.

On his arrival at [[Milan]] in 612, Columbanus met with a kindly welcome from [[Lombards|Lombard]] King [[Agilulf]] and Queen [[Theodelinda]]. He immediately began to confute the [[Arianism|Arians]] and wrote a treatise against their teaching, which has been lost. At the request of the king, he wrote a letter to Pope Boniface on the debated subject of &quot;The Three Chapters&quot;. These writings were considered to favour [[Nestorianism]].

Pope [[St. Gregory]], however, tolerated in Lombardy those persons who defended them, among whom was King Agilulf. Columbanus would probably have taken no active part in this matter had not the king pressed him so to do. But on this occasion his zeal certainly outran his knowledge. The letter opens with all apology that a &quot;foolish Scot&quot; should be charged to write for a Lombard king. He acquaints the pope with the imputations brought against him, and he is particularly severe with the memory of [[Pope Vigilius]].

He entreats the pontiff to prove his orthodoxy and assemble a council. He says that his freedom of speech accords with the usage of his country. &quot;Doubtless&quot;, Montalembert remarks, &quot;some of the expressions which he employs should be now regarded as disrespectful and justly rejected. But in those young and vigorous times, faith and austerity could be more indulgent&quot; (II, 440).

On the other hand, the letter expresses the most affectionate and impassioned devotion to the Holy See. The whole, however, may be judged from this fragment: &quot;We Irish, though dwelling at the far ends of the earth, are all disciples of St. Peter and St. Paul... Neither heretic, nor Jew, nor schismatic has ever been among us; but the Catholic Faith, Just as it was first delivered to us by yourselves, the successors of the Apostles, is held by us unchanged... we are bound [''devincti''] to the Chair of Peter, and although Rome is great and renowned, through that Chair alone is she looked on as great and illustrious among us ... On account of the two Apostles of Christ, you [the pope] are almost celestial, and Rome is the head of the whole world, and of the Churches&quot;.

If zeal for orthodoxy caused him to overstep the limits of discretion, his real attitude towards Rome is sufficiently clear. He declares the pope to be: &quot;his Lord and Father in Christ&quot;, &quot;The Chosen Watchman&quot;, &quot;The Prelate most dear to all the Faithful&quot;, &quot;The most beautiful Head of all the Churches of the whole of Europe&quot;, &quot;Pastor of Pastors&quot;, &quot;The Highest&quot;, &quot;The First&quot;, &quot;The First Pastor, set higher than all mortals&quot;, &quot;Raised near into all the Celestial Beings&quot;, &quot;Prince of the Leaders&quot;, &quot;His Father&quot;, &quot;His immediate Patron&quot;, &quot;The Steersman&quot;, &quot;The Pilot of the Spiritual Ship&quot; (Allnatt, &quot;Cathedra Petri&quot;, 106).

But it was necessary that, in Italy, Columbanus should have a settled abode, so the king gave him a tract of land called [[Bobbio]], between Milan and [[Genoa]], near the River [[Trebbia]], situated in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]. On his way there he taught the Faith in the town of [[Mombrione]], which is called San Colombano to this day. Padre della Torre considers that the saint made two journeys into Italy, which were confounded by Jonas.

On the first occasion he went to Rome and received from Pope Gregory many sacred relics (Stokes, Apennines, 132). This may possibly explain the traditional spot in St. Peter's, where St. Gregory and St. Columba are supposed to have met (Moran, Irish SS. in Great Britain, 105). At Bobbio the saint repaired the half-ruined church of St. Peter, and erected his celebrated [[Bobbio Abbey|abbey]], which for centuries was stronghold of orthodoxy in Northern Italy. Thither came Clothaire's messengers inviting the aged abbot to return, now that his enemies were dead. But he could not go.

He sent a request that the king would always protect his dear monks at Luxeuil. He prepared for death by retiring to his cave on the mountain-side overlooking the [[Trebbia]], where, according to a tradition, he had dedicated an oratory to Our Lady (Montalembert, &quot;Monks of the West&quot;, II, 444). He died at Bobbio (in part the model for the great monastery in [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'') in 615.

Among his principal miracles are: (1) procuring of food for a sick monk and curing the wife of his benefactor; (2) escape from hurt when surrounded by wolves; (3) obedience of a bear which evacuated a cave at his biddings; (4) producing a spring of water near his cave; (5) repletion of the Luxeuil granary when empty; (6) multiplication of bread and beer for his community; (7) curing of the sick monks, who rose from their beds at his request to reap the harvest; (8) giving sight to a blind man at Orleans; (9) destruction by his breath of a cauldron of beer prepared for a pagan festival; (10) taming a bear, and yoking it to a plough.

==Columbanus' monastic rule==
[[Image:SaintColumbanus.jpg|thumb|150px|St. Columbanus. Fresco in the abbey of [[Brugnato]].]]

The [[Monastic Rule]] of St. Columbanus is much shorter than [[Rule of St. Benedict|that of St. Benedict]], consisting of only ten chapters. The first six of these treat of obedience, silence, food, poverty, humility, and chastity. In these there is much in common with the Benedictine code, except that the fasting is more rigorous.

Chapter VII deals with the [[Choir Offices]]. Sunday [[Matins]] in winter consisted of seventy-five [[psalms]] and twenty-five [[antiphons]]-- three psalms to each antiphon. In spring and autumn these were reduced to thirty-six, and in summer to twenty-four, fewer were said on week days. The day hours consisted of [[Terce]], [[Sext]], [[None (liturgy)|None]] and [[Vespers]]. Three psalms were said at each of these Offices, except Vespers, when twelve psalms were said.

Chapter X regulates [[penance]]s (often corporal) for offences, and it is here that the Rule of St. Columbanus differs so widely from that of St. Benedict. Stripes or fasts were enjoined for the smallest faults. The habit of the monks consisted of a tunic of undyed wool, over which was worn the [[cuculla]], or cowl, of the same material. A great deal of time was devoted to various kinds of [[manual labour]], not unlike the life in monasteries of other rules.

The Rule of St. Columbanus was approved of by the [[Synod of Mâcon|Council of Mâcon]] in 627, but it was destined before the close of the century to be superseded by that of St. Benedict. For several centuries in some of the greater monasteries the two rules were observed conjointly.

==Other writings==
A number of works by Columbanus survive, including a monastic rule (the ''Regula monachorum''), a number of letters, and some poetry (see ''[[Columcille the Scribe]]''). These provide some of the earliest evidence for Irish knowledge of Latin.
In addition, Columbanus created the Communal Rule which is &quot;very evident of his time&quot;

==Legacy and veneration==
Like other men, Columbanus was not faultless. In the cause of God he was impetuous and even head-strong, for by nature he was eager, passionate, and dauntless. These qualities were both the source of his power and the cause of mistakes. But his virtues were very remarkable. He shared with other saints a great love for God's creatures. As he walked in the woods, the birds would alight upon his shoulder that he might caress them and the squirrels would run down from the trees and nestle in the folds of his cowl.

The fascination of his saintly personality drew numerous communities around him. That he possessed real affection for others is abundantly manifest in his letter to his brethren. Archbishop Healy eulogises him thus: &quot;A man more holy, more chaste, more self-denying, a man with loftier aims and purer heart than Columbanus was never born in the Island of Saints&quot; (Ireland's Ancient Schools, 378).

Regarding his attitude towards the Holy See, although with Celtic warmth and flow of words he could defend mere custom, there is nothing in his strongest expressions which implies that, in matters of faith, he for a moment doubted Rome's supreme authority. His influence in Europe was due to the conversions he effected and to the rule that he composed. What gave rise to his apostolate? Possibly the restless energy of the Celtic character, which, not finding sufficient scope in Ireland, directed itself in the cause of Christ to foreign lands. It may be that the example and success of St. Columba in Caledonia stimulated him to similar exertions. The example, however, of Columbanus in the sixth century stands out as the prototype of missionary enterprise towards the countries of Europe, so eagerly followed up from England and Ireland by such men as Saints [[Saint Kilian|Killian]], [[Vergilius of Salzburg|Virgilius]], [[Donatus of Fiesole|Donatus]], [[Wilfrid]], [[Willibrord]], [[Saint Suitbert|Swithbert]], [[Boniface]], and [[Ursicinus of Saint-Ursanne]].

If Columbanus's abbey at [[Bobbio]] in Italy became a citadel of faith and learning, [[Luxeuil]] in France became the nursery of saints and apostles. From its walls went forth men who carried his rule, together with the Gospel, into France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. There are said to have been sixty-three such apostles (Stokes, Forests of France, 254). These disciples of Columbanus are accredited with founding over one hundred different monasteries (ib., 74). The canton and town still bearing the name of [[St. Gall]] testify how well one disciple succeeded.

==Veneration==
[[Image:Basilica di San Colombano - Bobbio.jpg|thumb|200px|The basilica of San Colombano.]]

His body has been preserved in the abbey church at [[Bobbio]], and many miracles are said to have been wrought there through his intercession. In 1482 the relics were placed in a new shrine and laid beneath the altar of the crypt, where they are still venerated; the altar and shrine needing to be restored, and for this end in 1907 an appeal was made by Cardinal Logue, and there was every prospect of the work being speedily accomplished. The sacristy at Bobbio possesses a portion of the skull of the saint, his knife, wooden cup, bell, and an ancient water vessel, formerly containing sacred relics and said to have been given to him by St. Gregory. According to certain authorities, twelve teeth of the saint were taken from the tomb in the fifteenth century and kept in the treasury, but these have now disappeared (Stokes, Apennines, p.&amp;nbsp;183).

St. Columbanus is named in the [[Roman Martyrology]] on 23 November, but his feast is kept by the Benedictines and throughout Ireland on 24 November.

The Vatican has officially endorsed St. Columbanus as the patron saint of motorcyclists.

In art St. Columbanus is represented bearded bearing the monastic [[cowl]], he holds in his hand a book with an Irish [[satchel (bag)|satchel]], and stands in the midst of wolves. Sometimes he is depicted in the attitude of taming a bear, or with sun-beams over his head (Husenheth, &quot;Emblems&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;33).

==Sources and external links==
*The main source for Columbanus's life is recorded by [[Jonas of Bobbio]], an Italian monk who entered the monastery in Bobbio in 618, three years after the saint's death; Jonas wrote the life c. 643. This author lived during the abbacy of [[Attala (abbot)|Attala]], Columbanus's immediate successor, and his informants had been companions of the saint. [[Mabillon]] in the second volume of his &quot;Acta Sanctorum O.S.B.&quot; gives the life in full, together with an appendix on the miracles of the saint, written by an anonymous member of the Bobbio community.

The city of '''Concord''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|ɒ|n|.|k|ər|d}}) is the [[capital city|capital]] of the state of [[New Hampshire]] in the United States. It is also the [[county seat]] of [[Merrimack County, New Hampshire|Merrimack County]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], its population was 42,695.&lt;ref&gt;United States Census Bureau, [http://factfinder2.census.gov/main.html American FactFinder], 2010 Census figures. Retrieved March 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concord includes the villages of [[Penacook, New Hampshire|Penacook]], East Concord and West Concord. The city is home to the [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]], New Hampshire's only [[law school]]; [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]], a private [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]]; [[New Hampshire Technical Institute]], a two-year [[community college]]; and the Granite State Symphony Orchestra.

==History==
[[File:Downtownconcordnh.jpg|thumb|left|Downtown in 2005]]
The land was originally settled thousands of years ago by [[Abenaki]] Native Americans called the [[Pennacook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyford|first=James|coauthors=Amos Hadley, Howard F. Hill, Benjamin A. Kimball, Lyman D. Stevens, and John M. Mitchell|title=History of Concord, N.H.|publisher=The Rumford Press|year=1903|location=Concord, N.H.|pages=65|url=http://www.onconcord.com/books/lyford/lyford_vol1/LyfordV1chapt1.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribe fished for [[Fish migration|migrating]] [[salmon]], [[sturgeon]] and [[alewife|alewives]] with nets strung across the rapids of the [[Merrimack River]]. The stream was also the transportation route for their [[birch bark]] canoes, which could travel from [[Lake Winnipesaukee]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The broad sweep of the Merrimack River valley [[floodplain]] provided good soil for farming [[bean]]s, [[gourd]]s, [[pumpkin]]s, [[melon]]s and [[maize]].

On January 17, 1725, the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], which then held jurisdiction over New Hampshire, granted it as the Plantation of Penacook.&lt;ref&gt;Lyford et al., p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; It was settled between 1725 and 1727 by Captain Ebenezer Eastman and others from [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]]. On February 9, 1734, the town was incorporated as Rumford,&lt;ref&gt;Lyford et al., p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; from which [[Benjamin Thompson|Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford]] would take his title. It was renamed Concord in 1765 by Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] following a bitter boundary dispute between Rumford and the town of [[Bow, New Hampshire|Bow]]; the city name was meant to reflect the new concord, or harmony, between the disputant towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Jacob|title=Annals of the Town of Concord|publisher=Jacob B. Moore|year=1824|location=Concord, N.H.|pages=31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens displaced by the resulting border adjustment were given land elsewhere as compensation. In 1779, New Pennacook Plantation was granted to Timothy Walker, Jr. and his associates at what would be incorporated in 1800 as [[Rumford, Maine]], the site of Pennacook Falls.

Concord grew in prominence throughout the 18th century, and some of its earliest houses survive at the northern end of Main Street. In the years following the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], Concord's central geographical location made it a logical choice for the state capital, particularly after Samuel Blodget in 1807 opened a [[canal]] and [[lock (water transport)|lock]] system to allow vessels passage around the [[Amoskeag Falls]] downriver, connecting Concord with [[Boston]] by way of the [[Middlesex Canal]]. In 1808, Concord was named the official seat of state government,&lt;ref&gt;Lyford et al., p. 324–326&lt;/ref&gt; its 1819 [[New Hampshire State House|State House]] the oldest capitol in which legislative branches meet in their original chambers. The city would become noted for [[furniture]]-making and [[granite]] [[quarry]]ing. In 1828, Lewis Downing joined J. Stephens Abbot to form Abbot-Downing Coaches.&lt;ref&gt;Lyford et al., p. 339–340&lt;/ref&gt; Their most famous [[Stagecoaches#Concord stagecoaches|coach]] was the Concord Coach, modeled after the [[coronation]] coach of [[George II of England|King George III]]. In the 19th century, Concord became a hub for the [[railroad]] industry, with Penacook a [[textile]] manufacturing center using [[hydropower|water power]] from the [[Contoocook River]]. Today, the city is a center for health care and several [[insurance company|insurance companies]]. It is also home to Concord Litho, one of the largest independently owned commercial [[printing]] companies in the country.

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Concord 102WP.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Aerial view of downtown Concord (looking east)]]
Concord is located at {{coord|43|12|24|N|71|32|17|W|type:city}} (43.2070, −71.5371).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://msrmaps.com/map.aspx?t=2&amp;s=12&amp;lon=-71.538056&amp;lat=43.206667&amp;w=600&amp;h=400 | title = Topo Map: Concord, New Hampshire, United States 01 July 1985 | work = [[The National Map]] | publisher = [[U.S. Geological Survey]] | accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|67.5|sqmi}}. {{convert|64.3|sqmi|abbr=on}} of it is land and {{convert|3.2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of it is water, comprising 4.78% of the city. Concord is drained by the [[Merrimack River]]. [[Penacook Lake]] is in the west. The highest point in Concord is {{convert|860|ft}} above sea level on Oak Hill, just west of the hill's {{convert|970|ft|adj=on}} summit in neighboring [[Loudon, New Hampshire|Loudon]].

Concord lies fully within the Merrimack River [[Drainage basin|watershed]],&lt;ref name=watershed&gt;{{cite book |title=Water Use in New Hampshire: An Activities Guide for Teachers |url=http://nh.water.usgs.gov/Publications/nh.intro.html |last=Foster |first=Debra H. |coauthors=Batorfalvy, Tatianna N.; and Medalie, Laura |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Geological Survey |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is centered on the river, which runs from northwest to southeast through the city. Downtown is located on a low terrace to the west of the river, with residential neighborhoods climbing hills to the west and extending southwards towards the town of Bow. To the east of the Merrimack, atop a {{convert|100|ft|adj=on}} bluff, is a flat, sandy plain known as Concord Heights, which has seen most of the city's commercial development since 1960. The eastern boundary of Concord (with the town of [[Pembroke, New Hampshire|Pembroke]]) is formed by the [[Soucook River]], a tributary of the Merrimack. The [[Turkey River (New Hampshire)|Turkey River]] winds through the southwestern quarter of the city, passing through the campus of St. Paul's School before entering the Merrimack River in Bow. In the northern part of the city, the [[Contoocook River]] enters the Merrimack at the village of Penacook. Other village centers in the city include West Concord (actually north of downtown, on the west side of the Merrimack) and East Concord (also north of downtown, but on the east side of the Merrimack).

The city's neighboring communities are [[Bow, New Hampshire|Bow]] to the south, Pembroke to the southeast, Loudon to the northeast, [[Canterbury, New Hampshire|Canterbury]], [[Boscawen, New Hampshire|Boscawen]], and [[Webster, New Hampshire|Webster]] to the north, and [[Hopkinton, New Hampshire|Hopkinton]] to the west.

[[Interstate 89]] and [[Interstate 93]] are the two main Interstate highways serving Concord, and join just south of the city limits. Interstate 89 links Concord with [[Lebanon, New Hampshire|Lebanon]] and the state of [[Vermont]] to the northwest, while Interstate 93 connects the city to [[Plymouth, New Hampshire|Plymouth]], [[Littleton, New Hampshire|Littleton]], and the White Mountains to the north and [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] to the south. [[Interstate 393]] is a spur highway leading east from Concord and merging with [[U.S. Route 4]] as a direct route to New Hampshire's [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|seacoast]]. North-south [[U.S. Route 3]] serves as Concord's Main Street, while [[U.S. Route 202]] and [[New Hampshire Route 9]] cross the city from east to west.

Concord, as with much of New England, is within the [[humid continental climate]] zone ([[Koppen climate classification|Koppen]] ''Dfb''), with long, cold, snowy winters, very warm (and at times humid) summers, and relatively brief autumns and springs. In winter, successive storms deliver light to moderate snowfall amounts, contributing to the relatively reliable snow cover. The dampness is compounded by frequent (occurring 20 times per year) plunges to {{convert|0|°F|0}} at night, though thaws are frequent, with a few days per winter above {{convert|50|°F}}.&lt;ref name = NCDC /&gt; Summer can bring stretches of humid conditions as well as thunderstorms, but rarely extended periods of {{convert|90|°F|0}} or above, with 11 days breaching that mark.&lt;ref name = NCDC /&gt; Freezes begin early (late Sept) and cease late (late May) in the season, and even summer nights are crisp.&lt;ref name = NCDC /&gt;

Monthly daily means range from {{convert|20.1|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|70.0|°F|1}} in July. Temperature extremes have ranged from {{convert|−37|°F|0}} in February 1943 to {{convert|102|°F|0}} in July 1966.

===Air quality===
According to [http://scorecard.org Scorecard.org], Merrimack County ranked in 2002 among the top 10% dirtiest in terms of air pollution, with a total release of {{convert|2830473|lb}} of toxins, compared to {{convert|543|lb}} in neighboring [[Belknap County, New Hampshire|Belknap County]]. The top chemical pollutant release was [[hydrochloric acid]] at {{convert|2300000|lb}}, followed by [[sulfuric acid]] with {{convert|340000|lb}} released.  The majority of toxins, {{convert|2746211|lb}}, were released in the neighboring town of [[Bow, New Hampshire|Bow]] at the Merrimack Station power plant.

The [http://des.nh.gov/ New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services] has put an air quality forecast page on their website. In comparing scorecard.org and the [http://www2.des.state.nh.us/airdata/air_quality_forecast.asp NHDES pollutant forecast], there has been an improvement in air quality from 2002 to 2011.

[[File:Concordcapitolsign.jpg|thumb|left|Capitol sign in 2005]]

Concord has many landmarks and other tourist attractions.

The [[New Hampshire State House]], designed by architect Stuart Park and constructed between 1815 and 1818, is the oldest state house in which the legislature meets in its original chambers.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The building was remodeled in 1866, and the third story and west wing were added in 1910.

Located directly across from the State House is the [[Eagle Hotel (Concord, New Hampshire)|Eagle Hotel]], which has been a downtown landmark for nearly 150&amp;nbsp;years. Presidents [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[Rutherford Hayes]], and [[Benjamin Harrison]] all dined here, and [[Franklin Pierce]] spent the night here before departing for his inauguration. Other well-known guests included [[Jefferson Davis]], [[Charles Lindbergh]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Richard Nixon]], and [[Thomas Dewey]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The hotel closed its doors in 1961.

South from there on Main Street is Phenix Hall, which is the building that replaced &quot;Old&quot; Phenix Hall, which burned in 1893. Both the old and new buildings featured multi-purpose auditoriums used for political speeches, theater productions, and fairs. [[Abraham Lincoln]] spoke at the old hall in 1860; [[Theodore Roosevelt]] spoke at the new hall in 1912.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

North on Main Street is the Walker-Woodman House, the oldest standing house in Concord.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} It was built for the Rev. Timothy Walker on North Main Street between 1733 and 1735.

On the north end of Main Street is the Pierce Manse, where President Franklin Pierce lived in Concord before and following his presidency.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The mid-1830s [[Greek Revival]] house was moved from Montgomery Street to North Main Street in 1971 to prevent its demolition.

Beaver Meadow Golf Course, located in the northern part of Concord, is the oldest [[golf course]] in the state of New Hampshire.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The '''Chlorophyceae''' are one of the classes of [[green alga]]e, distinguished mainly on the basis of ultrastructural morphology.  For example the chlorophycean CW [[clade]], and chlorophycean DO clade, are defined by the arrangement of their [[flagella]]. Members of the CW clade have flagella that are displaced in a &quot;clockwise&quot; (CW, 1–7 o'clock) direction e.g. [[Chlamydomonadales]].  Members of the DO clade have flagella that are &quot;directly opposed&quot; (DO, 12–6 o'clock) e.g. [[Sphaeropleales]]. They are usually green due to the dominance of pigments [[chlorophyll a]] and [[chlorophyll b]].The [[chloroplast]] may be [[discoid]], plate-like, [[reticulate]], cup-shaped, [[spiral]] or [[ribbon shaped]] in different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called [[Pyrenoid]]s located in the chloroplast.Pyrenoids contain protein besides [[starch]].Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets.Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made up of an inner layer of [[cellulose]] and outer layer of [[pectose]].
 

They share many similarities with the higher plants, including the presence of asymmetrical flagellated cells, the breakdown of the nuclear envelope at mitosis, and the presence of phytochromes, flavonoids, and the chemical precursors to the cuticle.&lt;ref&gt;Raven, Evert and Eichhorn. ''The Biology of Plants'' 7th edition, pg. 335. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following orders are typically recognised:

* [[Dunaliellales]] (e.g. ''[[Dunaliella]]'')
* [[Volvocales]] (e.g. ''[[Volvox]]'', ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'')
* [[Chlorococcales]] (e.g. ''[[Nannochloris]]'')
* [[Oedogoniales]] (e.g. ''[[Oedogonium]]'')
* [[Sphaeropleales]]
* [[Chaetophorales]]
* [[Microsporales]]
* [[Tetrasporales]] (e.g. ''[[Tetraspora]]'')

In older classifications, the term Chlorophyceae is sometimes used to apply to all the green algae except the [[Charales]], and the internal division is considerably different.

'''Coercion''' ({{IPA-en|koʊˈɜrʃən|pron}}) is the practice of forcing another party to behave in an involuntary manner (whether through action or inaction) by use of [[threat]]s, rewards, or [[intimidation]] or some other form of pressure or force. In law, coercion is codified as the [[duress]] crime. Such actions are used as leverage, to force the victim to act in the desired way. Coercion may involve the actual infliction of physical pain/injury or psychological harm in order to enhance the [[credibility]] of a threat. The threat of further harm may lead to the [[co-operation|cooperation]] or [[obedience]] of the person being coerced. [[Torture]] is one of the most extreme examples of coercion i.e. severe pain is inflicted until the victim provides the desired information.

==Overview==
Any person’s set of feasible choices is obtained from the combination of two elements: the ''initial endowment'' (the perceived initial state of the world, which the chosen actions are going to affect) and the ''transformation rules'' (which state how any chosen action will change the initial endowment, according to the person’s perception).

This follows that coercion could take place by purposely manipulating either the transformation rules or the initial endowment (or both is maximised). Yet, the purpose of coercion is to substitute one’s aims to those of the victim. For this reason, many social philosophers have considered coercion as the polar opposite to [[Political freedom|freedom]].

Various forms of coercion are distinguished: first on the basis of the ''kind of injury'' threatened, second according to its ''aims'' and ''scope'', and finally according to its ''effects'', from which its legal, social, and ethical implications mostly depend.

===Physical===
Physical coercion is the most commonly considered form of coercion, where the content of the conditional threat is the use of force against a victim, their dear ones or property. An often used example is &quot;putting a gun to someone's head&quot; ('''at gunpoint''') or putting a &quot;knife under the throat&quot; ('''at knifepoint''' or cut-throat) to compel action. These are so common that they are also used as metaphors for other forms of coercion.

Armed forces in many countries use [[firing squad]]s to maintain [[discipline]] and intimidate the masses, or opposition, into submission or silent compliance. However, there also are nonphysical forms of coercion, where the threatened injury does not immediately imply the use of force. Byman and Waxman (2000) define coercion as &quot;the use of threatened force, including the limited use of actual force to back up the threat, to induce an adversary to behave differently than it otherwise would.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Byman, Daniel L.; Waxman, Matthew C.: ''Kosovo and the Great Air Power Debate'', ''[[International Security]], Vol. 24, No. 4 (Spring, 2000), pp. 5-38.&lt;/ref&gt; However, coercion does not necessarily amount to destruction.

===Psychological===
In psychological coercion, the threatened injury regards the victim’s relationships with other people. The most obvious example is  ''[[blackmail]]'', where the threat consists of the dissemination of damaging information. However, many other types are possible e.g. so-called &quot;[[emotional blackmail]]&quot;, which typically involves threats of rejection from or disapproval by a peer-group, or creating feelings of guilt/obligation via a display of anger or hurt by someone whom the victim loves or respects. Another example is [[coercive persuasion]]. Government agencies may use highly intimidating methods during investigations e.g. the threat of harsh legal penalties. The usual incentive to cooperate is some form of [[plea bargain]] i.e. an offer to drop or reduce criminal charges against a suspect in return for full cooperation.

Psychological coercion – along with the other varieties - was extensively and systematically used by the government of the [[People’s Republic of China]] during the “Thought Reform” campaign of 1951-1952. The process – carried out partly at “revolutionary universities” and partly within prisons – was investigated and reported upon by [[Robert Jay Lifton]], then Research Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University: see Lifton (1961). The techniques used by the Chinese authorities included a technique derived from standard [[group psychotherapy]], which was aimed at forcing the victims (who were generally intellectuals) to produce detailed and sincere ideological “confessions”. For instance, a professor of [[formal logic]] called Chin Yueh-lin – who was then regarded as China’s leading authority on his subject – was induced to write: “The new philosophy [of [[Marxism-Leninism]]], being scientific, is the supreme truth”. [Lifton (1961) p.&amp;nbsp;545].

====Usage====
Some people {{who|date=February 2011}} speak of '''cultural coercion''' when the fear of falling out with the group may force people into wearing a certain style of dress, publicly reciting a [[creed]] or a pledge of allegiance which they find ethically reprehensible or starting to smoke when they would have preferred not to etc. Within the definitional framework adopted here, all such things amount to (psychological) coercion if and only if the fear of falling out with the group is the result of ''purposeful'' threats by someone. See [[Peer pressure]], [[Sociology of religion]], [[Pledge of Allegiance]].

Some people include [[deception]] in their definition of (psychological) coercion. Yet deception does not generally involve ''any'' threat at all, as it works by creating a mere ''false perception'' by the victim of his or her ''given'' transformation rules. Although its effects may sometimes be very similar to those of a conditional threat, it may hence be useful to treat deception as separate phenomenon.

==Aims==

===Predatory===
The purely selfish kinds of coercion are a form of predatory behaviour by the coercing party, whose aim is to narrow down the scope of other people’s actions so as to make them instrumental to its own personal interests. According to many{{who|date=November 2010}} social philosophers, this sort of predatory behaviour will become the prevailing one{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. According to [[cynics|others]] it has been the prevailing one for millennia.

===Pedagogic and thought===
At the other extreme of the spectrum one finds attempts to use coercion altruistically, as a pedagogical device to improve – in some supposedly objective sense – the way other people ''think'', with particular regard to their basic attitudes and values. Pedagogic coercion may be applied within a strictly educational context, and it is then mostly directed towards children. In this article, however, attention will focus on ''thought coercion'', i.e. the attempt to use coercion to affect the basic values of grown-up people in general.

In all forms of ''thought coercion'' the immediate objective is to force other people to act ''as if'' their basic choice rules were identical to those of the coercing party. However, this mere conformity of “outward” behaviour is but a first step. The true and final aim of thought coercion is to induce a change in the victim’s objective function itself, i.e. the basic set of values and rules by which the victim determines his or her own choice among the alternatives of ''any'' feasible set. Thought coercion is thus generally meant to be only ''temporary''. Once the desired change in values has been brought about, the victim is expected to conform spontaneously, without any need for further coercion.

Whether and under what conditions this final aim can in fact be stably achieved is a difficult question, and it will be considered in the section devoted to the effects of coercion. Here it is necessary to point out that, whatever its effectiveness, thought coercion has in fact been used very extensively throughout history.

====Ideological====
''Ideological coercion'' is the use of thought coercion in the attempt to modify people’s [[social philosophy|social]] and [[political philosophy]]. This is of course quite different from plain propaganda, or even the simple persecution of political opponents, because its objective is to force individual ideological conversions. Unlike religious coercion, it is a quite recent phenomenon, confined to some of the [[totalitarian]] regimes of the twentieth century.

The most notable example of ideological coercion was the already mentioned Chinese “Thought Reform” campaign of 1951-52, which was unique due to both thoroughness and number of people involved. Yet, it must be noted that Chinese authorities found it necessary to follow that up with a new, albeit slightly milder, campaign as part of the [[Maoist]] “Cultural Revolution” of 1966-1968.

Starting from the political purges in the [[Soviet Union]] during the Thirties, similar “brainwashing” techniques were intermittently and less systematically used by most [[Stalinist]] regimes of the twentieth century. By contrast, the [[Fascist]] and [[Nazism|Nazi]] regimes of [[Italy]] and [[Germany]] tended to confine their coercive activities to purely [[political]] aims, without any serious attempt to force the ideological conversion of their opponents. The use of (physical) ideological coercion was however theorised by some Fascist philosophers, like [[Giovanni Gentile]] and Jared Harfield.{{citeneeded|date=February 2011}}

===Disciplinary===
Somewhere in the middle between predatory and pedagogic coercion one finds the forms of coercion that are used as the main coordination tools of command systems. These are organisations that use coercion to enforce on their members patterns of division of labour aimed at reaching the organisation’s goals, which for a variety of reasons may not always be consistent with each member’s personal aims. The most typical example of a command system is a military organisation, which is typically called a government, but any large production team may easily fall into this category.

Through the punishment system of disciplinary coercion, each individual member is typically forced into altruistic behaviour in the interest of the whole group. This kind of coercion is predatory, is thought coercion, but may often be accepted in advance by the members of the group.

==Scope==
The scope of coercion has to do with who uses a conditional threat against whom. It is closely linked with some of the other aspects already surveyed above, and may be of paramount importance in determining coercion’s effects and implications.

===Specific===
Specific or ''personal'' coercion is the most commonly considered kind. It takes place when the conditional threat is decided upon by one particular individual or small group, and/or directed against some other individual or small group. All forms of predatory and thought coercion fall into this category.

===Unspecific===
Under unspecific or ''impersonal'' coercion the conditional threats come from well-known and socially accepted general rules and – rather than any individual or sub-group – and are directed against anybody in the stated conditions, according to clearly stated principles of due process. In practice, the narrowing down of individual choice may be here principally aimed at reducing the incidence of specific coercion, rather than forcing on everybody some special sub-set of positive goals. More generally, unspecific coercion may be the form taken by disciplinary coercion, and this appears to be in fact the case within the most effective command systems of the modern world.

Unspecific coercion is thus the same thing as the [[rule of law]] in its widest sense. This must not however be confused with the ''monopoly of coercion by the State''. First, State coercion may very easily be arbitrary – indeed technically very ''specific'', according to the above definition. Second, there are well-documented historical examples of (small) societies that have practiced unspecific coercion ''without'' the help of State institutions – like [[Iceland]] in the early [[Middle Ages]]. The identification between State and law is but a special ''normative'' principle introduced by (public) Roman law, which according to some, like [[Maitland]], was for this very reason to be treated as the quintessential “law of tyranny”. Inspired by the “general will”, it should be entitled to enforcement by revolutionary coercion on the will of all. Later on, during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, this French revolutionary principle – though not of course its specific way to identify the “general will” – percolated into first [[Socialist]] and then [[Fascist]] political thinking.

===Ethical effects regarding freedom===
To most people {{who|date=February 2011}}, the ethical implications of individual predatory coercion are straightforward. In recent times, some have attempted to extend a similar ethical judgment to non-predatory forms of coercion by individuals. Thus, for instance, the [[Taking Children Seriously]] movement has criticised pedagogic coercion by adults, including parents, on children, holding that it is possible and desirable to act with a child in such a way that all activities are consensual.

The ethical standing of wider forms of supposedly “altruistic” specific coercion – like political and thought coercion – is however much more controversial, along lines relating to the assumed relationship between coercion and [[Free will|freedom]], which is often regarded as an ethical value in itself.

====Negation of freedom====
The Whig-liberal tradition has led to the well-known notion of (negative) freedom as lack of specific coercion. According to this view, any form of specific coercion is then unethical in itself as an injury to freedom, quite apart from its damaging effects on social progress. Indeed, the ethical value of (negative) freedom is grounded on the idea that conscience cannot be coerced, and is thus the ultimate standard of morality.

The '''client–server model''' of computing is a [[distributed application]] structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called [[server (computing)|server]]s, and service requesters, called [[client (computing)|client]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://java.sun.com/developer/Books/jdbc/ch07.pdf|publisher=Sun Microsystem|title=Distributed Application Architecture|accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often clients and servers communicate over a [[computer network]] on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A server machine is a host that is running one or more server programs which share their resources with clients. A client does not share any of its resources, but requests a server's content or service function. Clients therefore initiate communication sessions with servers which await incoming requests.

==Description==
The ''client–server'' characteristic describes the relationship of cooperating programs in an application. The server component provides a function or service to one or many clients, which initiate requests for such services.

''Functions'' such as email exchange, web access and database access, are built on the client–server model.  Users accessing banking services from their computer use a web browser client to send a request to a web server at a bank. That program may in turn forward the request to its own database client program that sends a request to a database server at another ba&lt;!-- Comment --&gt;nk computer to retrieve the account information. The balance is returned to the bank database client, which in turn serves it back to the web browser client displaying the results to the user.
The client–server model has become one of the central ideas of [[network computing]]. Many business applications being written today use the client–server model. So do the Internet's main application protocols, such as [[HTTP]], [[SMTP]], [[Telnet]], and [[Domain Name System|DNS]]. 

The interaction between client and server is often described using [[sequence diagram]]s. Sequence diagrams are standardized in the [[Unified Modeling Language]].

Specific types of clients include [[web browser]]s, [[email client]]s, and [[online chat]] clients.

Specific types of servers include [[web server]]s, [[ftp server]]s, [[application server]]s, [[database server]]s, [[name server]]s, [[mail server]]s, [[file server]]s, [[print server]]s, and [[terminal server]]s.  Most [[web service]]s are also types of servers.

==Comparison to peer-to-peer architecture== 
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
{{Citation style|date=April 2011}}

[[Peer-to-peer]] networks involve two or more computers pooling individual resources such as disk drives, CD-ROMs and printers. These shared resources are available to every computer in the network. Each computer acts as both the client and the server which means all the computers on the network are equals, that is where the term peer-to-peer comes from. While a client-server network involves multiple clients connecting to a single, central server.The file server on a client-server network is a high capacity, high speed computer with a large hard disk capacity.

In the peer to peer network, a software applications can be installed on the single computer and shared by every computer in the network. They are also cheaper to set up because most desktop operating systems have the software required for the network installed by default.On the other hand client-server model works with any size or physical layout of LAN and doesn't tend to slow down with a heavy use.

Peer-to-peer networks are typically less secure than a client-server networks because security is handled by the individual computers, not on the network as a whole. The resources of the computers in the network can become overburdened as they have to support not only the workstation user, but also the requests from network users. It is also difficult to provide systemwide services because the desktop operating system typically used in this type of network is incapable of hosting the service.Where the client-server networks have a higher initial setup cost. It is possible to set up a server on a desktop computer, but it is recommended that businesses invest in enterprise-class hardware and software. They also require a greater level of expertise to configure and manage the server hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;Book: Computers are your future&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peer to Peer vs. Client/Server Networks&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
* In most cases, a client–server architecture enables the roles and responsibilities of a computing system to be distributed among several independent computers that are known to each other only through a network. This creates an additional advantage to this architecture: greater ease of maintenance. For example, it is possible to replace, repair, upgrade, or even relocate a server while its clients remain both unaware and unaffected by that change.
* All data is stored on the servers, which generally have far greater security controls than most clients.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  Servers can better control access and resources, to guarantee that only those clients with the appropriate permissions may access and change data.
* Since [[data storage]] is centralized, updates to that data are far easier to administer in comparison to a [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] paradigm. In the latter, data updates may need to be distributed and applied to each peer in the network, which is time-consuming as there can be thousands or even millions of peers.
* Many mature client–server technologies are already available which were designed to ensure security, friendliness of the user interface, and ease of use.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
* It functions with multiple different clients of different capabilities.

==Disadvantages==
* As the number of simultaneous client requests to a given server increases, the server can become overloaded.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Contrast that to a P2P network, where its aggregated bandwidth actually increases as nodes are added,&lt;!--but not on a single network, comparing apples and oranges here--&gt; since the P2P network's overall bandwidth can be roughly computed as the sum of the bandwidths of every node in that network.
* The client–server paradigm lacks the robustness&lt;!--how is robustness defined? --&gt; of a good P2P network.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Under client–server, should a critical server fail, clients’ requests cannot be fulfilled.  In P2P networks, resources are usually distributed among many nodes.  Even if one or more nodes depart and abandon a downloading file, for example, the remaining nodes should still have the data needed to complete the download.

'''County Dublin''' ({{lang-ga|Contae Átha Cliath}}) is one of the thirty-two traditional [[counties of Ireland]]. The county contains the city of [[Dublin]], the [[Capital city|capital]] of the [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and is located on the east coast of Ireland in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Leinster]]. 

County Dublin was one of the first of the parts of Ireland to be shired  by [[King John of England]] following the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]. The population of the county is 1,187,176 according to the 2006 census, making it the most populous county in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beyond2020.cso.ie/Census/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=75467 Census 2006 - Population of each province, county and city]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, County Dublin was dissolved and the area divided into the modern administrative counties of [[Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown]], [[Fingal]] and [[South Dublin]]. Today, these areas collectively make up the [[Dublin Region]]&lt;ref name=&quot;r1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZSI394Y1993.html|title=Local Government Act, 1991 (Regional Authorities) (Establishment) Order, 1993|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|ga|Réigiúin Átha Cliath}}'') and come under the remit of the Dublin Regional Authority. While administration of the county has been split and the county dissolved from a political-administrative perspective, the county persists as an entity in other categories such as geography studies, postal and census services, [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] teams, and as an entity with which people continue to identify.

==Dissolution==

The area held formal [[county]] status until its dissolution as such in 1994, with Section 9 Part 1(a) of the ''Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993'' stating that as of 1 January 1994 &quot;the county shall cease to exist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Act of the Oireachtas]]: [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA31Y1993S9.html Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993 (Section 9 Part 1(a))]&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, and in response to a European Council report highlighting Ireland as the most centralised country in the [[European Union]], it was decided that a single County Dublin was unmanageable and undemocratic from a [[local government]] perspective. The county was formally abolished and replaced with [[Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown]], [[Fingal]], and [[South Dublin]], each with its own county seat. 

In discussing the legislation to dissolve Dublin County Council, [[Avril Doyle]], a [[Teachta Dála]], said, &quot;The Bill before us today effectively abolishes County Dublin, and as one born and bred in these parts of Ireland I find it rather strange that we in this House are abolishing County Dublin. I am not sure whether Dubliners realise that that is what we are about today, but in effect that is the case.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dáil Éireann]]: [http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0435/D.0435.199311030007.html Parliamentary Debates (3 November, 1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the legal status of the Dublin region, the term &quot;County Dublin&quot; is still in common usage. Many organisations and sporting teams continue to organise on a &quot;County Dublin&quot; or &quot;Dublin Region&quot; basis. The region formerly known as &quot;County Dublin&quot; is now defined in legislation solely as the &quot;Dublin Region&quot; under the ''Local Government Act, 1991 (Regional Authorities) (Establishment) Order, 1993'',&lt;ref name=&quot;r1&quot; /&gt; and this is the terminology officially used by the four Dublin administrative councils in press releases concerning the former county area. The term ''[[Greater Dublin Area]]'', which might consist of some or all of the Dublin Region along with counties of [[County Kildare|Kildare]], [[County Meath|Meath]] and [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]], has no legal standing.

The latest [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]] &quot;Discovery Series&quot; (Third Edition 2005) 1:50,000 map of the Dublin Region, Sheet 50, shows the boundaries of the city and three surrounding counties of the region. Extremities of the Dublin Region, in the north and south of the region, appear in other sheets of the series, 43 and 56 respectively.

==Local government==
[[Image:Map of the Dublin Region2.PNG|thumb|200px|right|Dublin Region]]
[[Dublin City Council]] has existed for centuries (previously ''Dublin Corporation'') as a [[county borough]]. [[Dublin County Council]] was abolished in 1994 and was replaced by three new county councils. Thus in summary the [[Local government|local authority]] divisions within the Dublin Region are the following:

===Mayor===
In May 2009, [[John Gormley]], the [[Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government]], announced plans to have a directly-elected &quot;Mayor of Dublin&quot; from 2010, whose powers would be similar to those of the [[Mayor of London]], and whose authority would extend to all four local authority areas within the historic county of Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/dublin-to-get-first-directly-elected-mayor-by-next-year-1736938.html |title=Dublin to get first directly elected mayor by next year |last=Molony |first=Senan |date=13 May 2009 |work=[[Irish Independent]] |accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mayor would chair the [[Dublin Transport Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''cosmological argument''' is an [[argument]] for the existence of a [[Primum movens|First Cause]] (or instead, an [[Uncaused cause]]) to the universe, and by extension is often used as an argument for the existence of an &quot;unconditioned&quot; or &quot;supreme&quot; being, usually then identified as [[God]]. It is traditionally known as an '''argument from universal causation''', an '''argument from first cause''', the '''causal argument''' or the '''argument from existence'''. Whichever term is employed, there are three basic variants of the argument, each with subtle yet important distinctions: the arguments from ''[[Causality|in causa (causality)]]'', ''[[Essence|in esse (essentiality)]]'', ''[[Becoming (philosophy)|in fieri (becoming)]]'', and the argument from [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]].

The basic premise of all of these is that something caused the Universe to exist, and this First Cause must be God. It has been used by various theologians and philosophers over the centuries, from the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to the medieval [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] and beyond. It is also applied by the [[Spiritist doctrine]] as the main argument for the existence of God.

[[Image:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], depicted here in [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]'', both developed first cause arguments.]]

[[Plato]] (c. 427–347 BC) and [[Aristotle]] (c. 384–322 BC) both posited first cause arguments, though each had certain notable caveats. Plato posited a basic argument in ''[[The Laws]]'' (Book X), in which he argued that motion in the world and the [[Cosmos]] was &quot;imparted motion&quot; that required some kind of &quot;self-originated motion&quot; to set it in motion and to maintain that motion.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cosmological Argument for the Existence of God&quot;, in ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967), Vol. 2, p232 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato posited a &quot;[[demiurge]]&quot; of supreme wisdom and intelligence as the creator of the Cosmos in his work ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''. 

Aristotle argued against the idea of a first cause, often confused with the idea of a &quot;[[Primum movens|prime mover]]&quot; or &quot;[[unmoved mover]]&quot; ({{Polytonic|πρῶτον κινοῦν ἀκίνητον}} or ''primus motor'') in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' VIII, 4–6; ''Metaphysics'' XII, 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's famous argument was contrary to the [[atomism|atomist's]] depiction of a non-eternal cosmos which, he argued, would require an [[four causes|efficient]] first cause, a notion that Aristotle took to demonstrate a critical flaw in their reasoning. However, a non-eternal cosmos, with both a beginning and an end, would later come to reflect the prevalent theological beliefs in medieval Europe. By simply denying that an efficient first cause is problematic, being easily explained as the creative action of an omnipotent God, medieval theologians re-purposed and enhanced Aristotle's argument, as if the intention had been to prove God's existence. Like Plato, Aristotle believed in an eternal [[cosmos]] with no beginning and no end (which in turn follows [[Parmenides]]' famous statement that &quot;[[nothing comes from nothing]]&quot;). In what he called &quot;first philosophy&quot; or metaphysics, Aristotle ''did'' intend a theological correspondence between the prime mover and deity (presumably [[Zeus]]), functionally however, he provided an explanation for the apparent motion of the &quot;[[fixed stars]]&quot; (now understood as the daily rotation of the Earth). According to his theses, immaterial unmoved movers are eternal unchangeable beings that constantly think about thinking, but being immaterial, they're incapable of interacting with the cosmos and have no knowledge of what transpires therein. From an &quot;aspiration or desire&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cosmological Argument for the Existence of God&quot;, in ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967), Vol. 2, p233 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[celestial spheres]], ''imitate'' that purely intellectual activity as best they can, by [[uniform circular motion]]. The unmoved movers ''inspiring'' the [[classical planets|planetary]] spheres are no different in kind from the prime mover, they merely suffer a dependency of relation to the prime mover. Correspondingly, the motions of the planets are subordinate to the motion inspired by the prime mover in the sphere of fixed stars. Aristotle's natural theology admitted no creation or capriciousness from the immortal [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], but maintained a defense against dangerous charges of impiety.

Plotinus, a third-century Platonist, taught that the One transcendent absolute caused the universe to exist simply as a consequence of its existence - &quot;creatio ex deo.&quot; His disciple Proclus stated 'The One is God'.

Centuries later, the [[Islamic]] [[philosopher]] [[Avicenna]] (c. 980–1037) inquired into the question of [[being]], in which he distinguished between [[essence]] (''Mahiat'') and [[existence]] (''Wujud''). He argued that the fact of existence could not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves could not originate and interact with the movement of the Universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Thus, he reasoned that existence must be due to an [[Causality|agent cause]] that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must coexist with its effect and be an existing thing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Islam in Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= | authorlink= | title=Islam |year=2007| encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica Online | accessdate=2007-11-27|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Duncan, writes that &quot;it was first formulated by a Greek-speaking Syriac Christian neo-Platonist, [[John Philoponus]].&quot; Who &quot;claims to find a contradiction between the Greek pagan insistence on the eternity of the world and the Aristotelian rejection of the existence of any actual infinite.&quot; Referring to the argument as the &quot;'[[Kalam]]' cosmological argument&quot;, Duncan asserts that it &quot;received its fullest articulation at the hands of [medieval] Muslim and Jewish exponents of ''Kalam'' (&quot;the use of reason by believers to justify the basic metaphysical presupposions of the faith).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, S., ''Analytic philosophy of religion: its history since 1955'', Humanities-Ebooks, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (c. 1225–1274 ), a [[theologian]] in [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]], adapted the argument he found in his reading of Aristotle and Avicenna to form one of the most influential versions of the cosmological argument.&lt;ref&gt;Scott David Foutz, [http://www.quodlibet.net/aqu5ways.shtml An Examination of Thomas Aquinas' Cosmological Arguments as found in the Five Ways], ''Quodlibet Online Journal of Christian Theology and Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; His conception of First Cause was the idea that the Universe must have been caused by something that was itself uncaused, which he asserted was [[God]].

Many other philosophers and theologians have posited cosmological arguments both before and since Aquinas. The versions sampled in the following sections are representative of the most common derivations of the argument.

== Argument ==
A version of the cosmological argument could be stated as follows:

# Every finite and [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] being has a cause.
# A [[Causality|causal]] loop cannot exist.
# A [[Causality|causal]] chain cannot be of infinite length.
# Therefore, a First Cause (or something that is not an effect) must exist.

According to the argument, the existence of the Universe requires an explanation, and the creation of the Universe by a First Cause, generally assumed to be God, is that explanation.

In light of the [[Big Bang theory]], a stylized version of argument has emerged (sometimes called the [[Kalam cosmological argument]], the following form of which was set forth by [[William Lane Craig]]&lt;ref&gt;Craig, William L. &quot;The Existence of God and the Beginning of the Universe.&quot; ''Truth Journal''. Leadership University. 22 Jun. 2008 &lt;http://www.leaderu.com/truth/3truth11.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;):

# Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
# The Universe began to exist.
# Therefore, the Universe had a cause.

=== Argument from contingency ===

In the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] era, [[Aquinas]] formulated the &quot;argument from [[contingency]]&quot;, following [[Aristotle]] in claiming that there must be something to explain why the Universe exists. Since the Universe could, under different circumstances, conceivably ''not'' exist (contingency), its existence must have a cause – not merely another contingent thing, but something that exists by [[Causality#Necessary_and_sufficient_causes|necessity]] (something that ''must'' exist in order for anything else to exist).&lt;ref&gt;''Summa Theologiae, I :'' 2,3&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, even if the Universe has always existed, it still owes its existence to an [[Primum movens|Uncaused Cause]],&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas was an ardent student of Aristotle's works, a significant number of which had only recently been translated into Latin by [[Ibn-Rushd]], also known as [[Averroes]].&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas further said: &quot;...and this we understand to be God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Summa Theologiae, I : '' 2,3&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas's argument from contingency allows for the possibility of a Universe that has no beginning in time. It is a form of argument from universal [[Causality|causation]]. Aquinas observed that, in nature, there were things with contingent existences. Since it is possible for such things not to exist, there must be some time at which these things did not in fact exist. Thus, according to Aquinas, there must have been a time when nothing existed. If this is so, there would exist nothing that could bring anything into existence. Contingent beings, therefore, are insufficient to account for the existence of contingent beings: there must exist a ''[[Causality#Necessary_and_sufficient_causes|necessary]]'' being whose non-existence is an impossibility, and from which the existence of all contingent beings is derived.

The German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] made a similar argument with his [[principle of sufficient reason]] in 1714. &quot;There can be found no fact that is true or existent, or any true proposition,&quot; he wrote, &quot;without there being a sufficient reason for its being so and not otherwise, although we cannot know these reasons in most cases.&quot; He formulated the cosmological argument succinctly: &quot;Why is there something rather than nothing?  The sufficient reason [...] is found in a substance which [...] is a necessary being bearing the reason for its existence within itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Monadologie'' (1714). [[Nicholas Rescher]], trans., 1991. ''The Monadology: An Edition for Students''. Uni. of Pittsburg Press. [http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdf/leibmon.pdf Jonathan Bennett's translation.] [http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/philos/classics/leibniz/monad.htm Latta's translation.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''In esse'' and ''in fieri'' ===

The difference between the arguments from causation ''[[Becoming (philosophy)|in fieri]]'' and ''[[Essence|in esse]]'' is a fairly important one. ''In fieri'' is generally translated as &quot;becoming&quot;, while ''in esse'' is generally translated as &quot;in essence&quot;. ''In fieri'', the process of becoming, is similar to building a house. Once it is built, the builder walks away, and it stands on its own accord. (It may require occasional maintenance, but that is beyond the scope of the first cause argument.)

''In esse'' (essence) is more akin to the light from a candle or the liquid in a vessel. George Hayward Joyce, [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], explained that &quot;...where the light of the candle is dependent on the candle's continued existence, not only does a candle produce light in a room in the first instance, but its continued presence is necessary if the illumination is to continue. If it is removed, the light ceases. Again, a liquid receives its shape from the vessel in which it is contained; but were the pressure of the containing sides withdrawn, it would not retain its form for an instant.&quot; This form of the argument is far more difficult to separate from a purely first cause argument than is the example of the house's maintenance above, because here the First Cause is insufficient without the candle's or vessel's continued existence.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, George Hayward (1922) ''Principles of Natural Theology''. NY: Longmans Green.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]' argument is ''in esse'', while [[Aquinas]]' argument is both ''in fieri'' and ''in esse''. This distinction is an excellent example of the difference between a [[deistic]] view (Leibniz) and a [[theistic]] view (Aquinas). As a general trend, the modern slants on the cosmological argument, including the [[Kalam cosmological argument|Kalam argument]], tend to lean very strongly towards an ''in fieri'' argument.

== Objections and counterarguments ==
{{see also|Münchhausen Trilemma}}
=== What caused the First Cause? ===
{{The Works of Aristotle}}
One objection to the argument is that it leaves open the question of why the First Cause is unique in that it does not require a cause. Proponents argue that the First Cause is exempt from having a cause, while opponents argue that this is [[special pleading]] or otherwise untrue.&lt;ref name=reichenbach&gt;Reichenbach, Bruce, &quot;Cosmological Argument&quot;, ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2006 Edition)'', Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2006/entries/cosmological-argument/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with arguing for the First Cause's exemption is that it raises the question of why the First Cause is indeed exempt.&lt;ref name=cline&gt;Cline, Austin. &quot;Cosmological Argument: Does the Universe Require a First Cause?&quot; ''About.com: Agnosticism/Atheism''. 20 Jun. 2008 &lt;http://atheism.about.com/od/argumentsforgod/a/cosmological.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, the premise of [[causality]] has been arrived at via ''[[a posteriori]]'' ([[Inductive reasoning|inductive]]) reasoning, which is dependent on experience. [[David Hume]] highlighted this [[problem of induction]] and argued that [[Causality|causal relations]] were not true ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' ([[Deductive reasoning|deductively]]). However as to whether inductive or deductive reasoning is more valuable still remains a matter of debate, with the general conclusion being that neither is prominent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/dedind.php&lt;/ref&gt; Even though causality applies to the known world, it does not necessarily apply to the universe at large. In other words, it is unwise to draw conclusions from an extrapolation of causality beyond experience.&lt;ref name=reichenbach/&gt;

=== Identity of a First Cause ===
An objection against the theist implication of the proposition is that even if one accepts the argument as a proof of a First Cause, it does not identify that First Cause with God. The argument does not go on to ascribe to the First Cause some of the basic attributes commonly associated with, for instance, a [[theistic]] God, such as [[immanence]] or [[omnibenevolence]].&lt;ref name=cline/&gt; Rather, it simply argues that a First Cause (e.g. the [[Big Bang]], God, or an unarticulated First Cause) must exist.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, William L. &quot;Initial Arguments: A Defense of the Cosmological Argument for the Existence of God.&quot; ''Leadership University''. 20 Jun. 2008 &lt;http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/craig-smith1.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, even if one chooses to accept God as the First Cause, there is an argument that God's continued interaction with the Universe is not required. This is the foundation for beliefs such as [[deism]] that accept that a god created the Universe, but then ceased to have any further interaction with it.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;deism.&quot; ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition''. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. ''Answers.com'' 20 Jun. 2008. http://www.answers.com/topic/deism&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Existence of causal loops ===

A causal loop is a form of [[predestination paradox]] arising where travel backwards in time is deemed a possibility. A sufficiently powerful entity in such a world would have the capacity to travel backwards in time to a point before its own existence, and to then create itself, thereby initiating everything which follows from it.

The usual reason which is given to refute the possibility of a causal loop is it requires that the loop as a whole be its own cause. [[Richard Hanley]] argues that causal loops are not logically, physically, or epistemically impossible: &quot;[In timed systems,] the only possibly objectionable feature that all causal loops share is that coincidence is required to explain them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hanley, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/v436qxx802383534 No End in Sight: Causal Loops in Philosophy, Physics and Fiction], ''Synthese''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Existence of infinite causal chains ===
{{see also|Infinite universe theory}}
[[David Hume]] and later [[Paul Edwards]] have invoked a similar principle in their criticisms of the cosmological argument. Rowe has called the principle the Hume-Edwards principle:&lt;ref&gt;Alexander R. Pruss, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/q134n458307w0125 The Hume-Edwards Principle and the Cosmological Argument], ''International Journal for Philosophy of Religion''&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|If the existence of every member of a set is explained, the existence of that set is thereby explained.}}

Nevertheless, David E. White argues that the notion of an [[infinite regress|infinite causal regress]] providing a proper explanation is fallacious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=David E.|title=An argument for God's existence|journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m4t816n217704nxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore Demea states that even if the succession of causes is infinite, the whole chain still requires a cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calvert|first=Brian|title=Another problem about Part IX of Hume's Dialogues|journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r5x5g687h06571w6}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain this, suppose there exists a causal chain of infinite contingent beings. If one asks the question, &quot;Why are there any contingent beings at all?&quot;, it won’t help to be told that &quot;There are contingent beings because other contingent beings caused them.&quot;  That answer would just presuppose additional contingent beings. An adequate explanation of why some contingent beings exist would invoke a different sort of being, a necessary being that is ''not'' contingent.&lt;ref&gt;http://personal.stthomas.edu/mwrota/InfiniteRegress4%20Final.doc&lt;/ref&gt; A response might suppose each individual is contingent but the infinite chain as a whole is not; or the whole infinite causal chain to be its own cause.

The [[infinite universe theory|IUT]] claims that the physical world is governed by an infinite universal causality.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientificphilosophy.com/Downloads/IUT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Severinsen argues that there is an &quot;infinite&quot; and complex causal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Severinsen|first=Morten|title=Principles Behind Definitions of Diseases – a Criticism of the Principle of Disease Mechanism and the Development of a Pragmatic Alternative|journal=Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/hm2t476u01543017|quote=This implies that there is an &quot;infinite&quot; and complex causal structure behind each disease, and that the disease mechanism would have to encompass the whole structure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; White tried to introduce an argument “without appeal to the principle of sufficient reason and without denying the possibility of an infinite causal regress”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=David E.|title=An argument for God's existence|journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m4t816n217704nxv|quote=My intention is to show that a cosmological argument for God's existence (not that of a first cause simpliciter) can be constructed without appeal to the principle of sufficient reason and without denying the possibility of an infinite causal regress.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Thomas Aquinas’ argument from contingency applies even if the universe had no beginning, but it would still have to be sustained in being at any particular moment by God. According to Aquinas, the universe cannot, at any particular moment, be causing itself. Even if causes and effects in the universe looped back on themselves, they would still, at any particular moment, be contingent and thus would have to be caused by God. They could not be causing themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Feser, Aquinas, Oneworld Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific positions ==

{{See also|Stochastics}}

The cosmological argument is mostly dismissed in the scientific field due to its highly speculative nature. The theory is said to assume many aspects of how the universe came to be without scientific analysis, rather a monotheistic religious outlook. Most scientists argue that &quot;God&quot; is not a scientifically proven cause, considering current acceptable evidence does not verify a deity’s existence.

It is argued that a challenge to the cosmological argument is the nature of time, &quot;One finds that time just disappears from the [[Wheeler–DeWitt equation]]&quot;{{uncited quote|date=April 2010}} - [[Carlo Rovelli]]. The [[Big Bang theory]] states that it is the point in which all [[dimension]]s came into existence, the start of both [[space]] and [[time]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sciam&quot;&gt;(J. Richard Gott III, James E. Gunn, David N. Schramm, and Beatrice M. Tinsley, &quot;Will the Universe Expand Forever?&quot; Scientific American [March 1976], p. 65)&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the question &quot;What was there before the Universe?&quot; makes no sense; the concept of &quot;before&quot; becomes meaningless when considering a situation without time.&lt;ref name=&quot;sciam&quot; /&gt; This has been put forward by J. Richard Gott III, James E. Gunn, David N. Schramm, and Beatrice M. Tinsley, who said that asking what occurred before the Big Bang is like asking what is north of the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sciam&quot; /&gt; However, some cosmologists and physicists do attempt to investigate what could have occurred before the Big Bang, using such scenarios as the collision of [[Membrane (M-Theory)|membrane]]s to give a cause for the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;Britt, Robert R. &quot;'Brane-Storm' Challenges Part of Big Bang Theory.&quot; ''Space.com''. 18 Apr. 2001. 21 Jun. 2008 &lt;http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/bigbang_alternative_010413-3.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Clutchdisc.jpg|thumb|right|Single, dry, clutch friction disc. The [[Spline (mechanical)|splined]] hub is attached to the disc with springs to damp chatter.]]

A '''clutch''' is a [[machine|mechanical device]] which provides for the [[power transmission|transmission of power]] (and therefore usually motion) from one component (the driving member) to another (the driven member). The opposite component of the clutch is the [[brake]].

Clutches are used whenever the ability to limit the transmission of power or motion needs to be controlled either in amount or over time (e.g. electric screwdrivers limit how much torque is transmitted through use of a clutch; clutches control whether automobiles transmit engine power to the wheels).

In the simplest application clutches are employed in devices which have two rotating shafts. In these devices one shaft is typically attached to a motor or other power unit (the driving member) while the other shaft (the driven member) provides output power for work to be done. In a [[drill]] for instance, one shaft is driven by a motor and the other drives a drill chuck. The clutch connects the two shafts so that they may be locked together and spin at the same speed (engaged), locked together but spinning at different speeds (slipping), or unlocked and spinning at different speeds (disengaged).

The rest of this article is dedicated to discussions surrounding types of clutches, their applications, and similarities and differences of such.

==Friction Clutches==
Friction clutches are by far the most well-known type of clutches.
;Materials
Various materials have been used for the disc friction facings, including asbestos in the past. Modern clutches typically use a [[Organic|compound organic]] resin with copper wire facing or a [[ceramic]] material. A typical coefficient of friction used on a friction disc surface is 0.35ų for organic and 0.25ų for ceramic. Ceramic materials are typically used in heavy applications such as trucks carrying large loads or racing, though the harder ceramic materials increase [[flywheel]] and pressure plate wear.
;Push/Pull

Friction disk clutches generally are classified as &quot;Push Type&quot; or &quot;Pull Type&quot; depending on the location of the pressure plate fulcrum points. In a pull type clutch, the action of pressing the pedal pulls the release bearing, pulling on the diaphragm spring and disengaging the vehicle drive. The opposite is true with a push type, the release bearing is pushed into the clutch disengaging the vehicle drive. In this instance, the release bearing can be known as a thrust bearing (as per the image above).

;Pads
Clutch pads are attached to the frictional pads, part of the clutch. They are most commonly made of rubber but have been known to be made of [[asbestos]]. Clutch pads usually last about 100,000 miles (160,000 km) depending on how vigorously the car is driven.

;Dampers
In addition to the damped disc centres which reduce driveline vibration, pre-dampers may be used to reduce gear rattle at idle by changing the natural frequency of the disc. These weaker springs are compressed solely by the radial vibrations from an idling engine. They are fully compressed and no longer in use once drive is taken up by the main damper springs.

;Load
Mercedes truck examples:
A clamp load of 33KN (33,000N) is normal for a single plate 430.  The 400 Twin application offers a clamp load of a mere 23KN (23,000N). Bursts speeds are typically around 5,000rpm with the weakest point being the facing rivet.

;Manufacturing
Modern clutch development focuses its attention on the simplification of the overall assembly and/or manufacturing method.  For example drive straps are now commonly employed to transfer torque as well as lift the pressure plate upon disengagement of vehicle drive. With regards to the manufacture of diaphragm springs, heat treatment is crucial. Laser welding is becoming more common as a method of attaching the drive plate to the disc ring with the laser typically being between 2-3KW and a feed rate 1m/minute.

===Multiple plate clutch===
This type of clutch has several driving members interleaved or &quot;stacked&quot; with several driven members.  It is used in race cars including [[Formula One|F1]], [[IndyCar]], [[World Rally Championship|World Rally]] and even most club racing,  [[motorcycle]]s, [[automatic transmission]]s and in some [[diesel locomotive]]s with mechanical transmissions.  It is also used in some electronically controlled all-wheel drive systems.

===Wet vs. dry===
A &quot;wet clutch&quot; is immersed in a cooling [[lubricating fluid]] which also keeps the surfaces clean and gives smoother performance and longer life.  Wet clutches, however, tend to lose some energy to the liquid. Since the surfaces of a wet clutch can be slippery (as with a motorcycle clutch bathed in engine oil), stacking multiple clutch disks can compensate for the lower [[coefficient of friction]] and so eliminate slippage under power when fully engaged.

The [[Hele-Shaw clutch]] was a wet clutch that relied entirely on viscous effects, rather than on friction.

A &quot;dry clutch&quot;, as the name implies, is not bathed in fluid and should be, literally, dry.

===Centrifugal===
A [[centrifugal clutch]] is used in some vehicles (e.g. [[Mopeds]]) and also in other applications where the speed of the engine defines the state of the clutch, for example, in a [[chainsaw]]. This clutch system employs [[centrifugal]] force to automatically engage the clutch when the engine [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] rises above a threshold and to automatically disengage the clutch when the engine rpm falls low enough. The system involves a clutch shoe or shoes attached to the driven shaft, rotating inside a clutch bell attached to the output shaft. The shoe(s) are held inwards by springs until [[centrifugal]] force overcomes the spring tension and the shoe(s) make contact with the bell, driving the output. In the case of a chainsaw this allows the chain to remain stationary whilst the engine is idling; once the throttle is pressed and the engine speed rises, the centrifugal clutch engages and the cutting chain moves. See [[Saxomat]] and [[Variomatic]].

===Cone clutch===
Distinguished by conical friction surfaces. The cone's taper means that a given amount of movement of the actuator makes the surfaces approach (or recede) much more slowly than in a disc clutch. As well, a given amount of actuating force created more pressure on the mating surfaces.

===Torque limiter===
Also known as a slip clutch or ''safety clutch'', this device allows a rotating shaft to slip when higher than normal resistance is encountered on a machine. An example of a safety clutch is the one mounted on the driving shaft of a large grass mower. The clutch will yield if the blades hit a rock, stump, or other immobile object. Motor-driven mechanical calculators had these between the drive motor and gear train, to limit damage when the mechanism jammed, as motors used in such calculators had high stall torque and were capable of causing damage to the mechanism if torque wasn't limited.
*Carefully-designed types disengage, but continue to transmit torque, in such tools as controlled-torque screwdrivers.
*Many safety clutches are ''not'' friction clutches, but belong to the &quot;interference clutch&quot; family, of which the [[dog clutch]] (see below) is the best-known.

==Major Types of Clutches by Application==
===Vehicular (General)===
There are different designs of vehicle clutch but most are based on one or more [[friction]] discs pressed tightly together or against a [[flywheel]] using [[spring (device)|springs]]. The friction material varies in composition depending on many considerations such as whether the clutch is &quot;dry&quot; or &quot;wet&quot;. Friction discs once contained [[asbestos]] but this has been largely eliminated. Clutches found in heavy duty applications such as trucks and competition cars use ceramic clutches that have a greatly increased friction coefficient. However, these have a &quot;grabby&quot; action generally considered unsuitable for passenger cars. The spring [[pressure]] is released when the clutch pedal is depressed thus either pushing or pulling the diaphragm of the pressure plate, depending on type.  However, raising the engine speed too high while engaging the clutch will cause excessive clutch plate wear. Engaging the clutch abruptly when the engine is turning at high speed causes a harsh, jerky start.  This kind of start is necessary and desirable in [[drag racing]] and other competitions, where speed is more important than comfort.

====Automobile Powertrain====
[[Image:PilotShaftGuideTool.jpg|thumb|right|This plastic pilot shaft guide tool is used to align the clutch disk as the spring-loaded pressure plate is installed. The transmission's drive splines and pilot shaft have a complementary shape. A number of such devices fit various makes and models of drivetrains.]]

In a modern [[automobile|car]] with a [[manual transmission]] the clutch is operated by the left-most [[Automobile pedal|pedal]] using a [[hydraulic]] or [[cable]] connection from the pedal to the clutch mechanism. On older cars the clutch might be operated by a mechanical linkage.  Even though the clutch may physically be located very close to the pedal, such remote means of actuation  are necessary to eliminate the effect of vibrations and slight engine movement, engine mountings being flexible by design.  With a rigid mechanical linkage, smooth engagement would be near-impossible because engine movement inevitably occurs as the drive is &quot;taken up.&quot;  No pressure on the pedal means that the clutch plates are engaged (driving), while pressing the pedal disengages the clutch plates, allowing the driver to shift [[gear]]s or coast.

====Motorcycles====
Motorcycles typically employ a wet clutch with the clutch riding in the same oil as the transmission. These clutches are usually made up of a stack of alternating plain steel and friction plates. Some of the plates have lugs on their inner diameters locking them to the engine crankshaft, while the other plates have lugs on their outer diameters that lock them to a basket which turns the transmission input shaft. The plates are forced together by a set of coil springs or a diaphragm spring plate when the clutch is engaged.

On most [[motorcycle]]s the clutch is operated by the clutch lever located on the left handlebar.  No pressure on the lever means that the clutch plates are engaged (driving), while pulling the lever back towards the rider will disengage the clutch plates through cable or hydraulic actuation, allowing the rider to shift gears or coast.

Racing motorcycles often use [[slipper clutch]]es to eliminate the effects of [[engine braking]] which, being applied only to the rear wheel, can lead to instability.

====Automobile Non-powertrain====
There are other clutches found in a car. For example, a belt-driven engine cooling fan may have a clutch that is heat-activated.  The driving and driven members are separated by a silicone-based fluid and a valve controlled by a bimetallic spring. When the temperature is low, the spring winds and closes the valve, which allows the fan to spin at about 20% to 30% of the [[crankshaft|shaft]] speed. As the temperature of the spring rises, it unwinds and opens the valve, allowing fluid past the valve which allows the fan to spin at about 60% to 90% of shaft speed.

Other clutches such as for an [[air conditioning]] compressor electronically engaged clutches using magnetic force to couple the driving member to the driven member.

==Other general clutches and example applications==
* Belt clutch: Used on agricultural equipment and some piston-engine-driven helicopters. Engine power is transmitted via a set of [[Belt (mechanical)#Vee belts|vee-belts]] that are slack when the engine is idling, but by means of a tensioner pulley can be tightened to increase friction between the belts and the sheaves.
* [[Dog clutch]]: Utilized in automobile manual transmissions mentioned above. Positive engagement, non-slip. Typically used where slipping is not acceptable. Partial engagement under any significant load tends to be destructive.
* [[Fluid coupling|Hydraulic clutch]]: The driving and driven members are not in physical contact; coupling is hydrodynamic.
* [[Electromagnetic clutch]]: Typically a clutch that is engaged by an electromagnet that is an integral part of the clutch assembly. However, magnetic particle clutches have magnetically influenced particles contained in a chamber between driving and driven members which upon application of [[direct current]] causes the particles to clump together and adhere to the operating surfaces. Engagement and slippage are notably smooth.
* Overrunning clutch or [[freewheel]]: If some external force makes the driven member rotate faster than the driver, the clutch effectively disengages. Examples include:
** Borg-Warner [[overdrive]] transmissions in cars
** Typical bicycles have these so that the rider can stop pedaling and coast
** An oscillating member where this clutch can then convert the oscillations into intermittent linear or rotational motion of the complimentary member; others use ratchets with the pawl mounted on a moving member
** The winding knob of a camera employs a (silent) wrap-spring type as a clutch in winding and as a brake in preventing it from being turned backwards.
** The rotor drive train in helicopters uses a freewheeling clutch to disengage the rotors from the engine in the event of engine failure, allowing the craft to safely descend by autorotation.
*Wrap-spring clutches: These have a helical spring wound with square-cross-section wire. In simple form the spring is fastened at one end to the driven member; its other end is unattached. The spring fits closely around a cylindrical driving member. If the driving member rotates in the direction that would unwind the spring the spring expands minutely and slips although with some drag. Rotating the driving member the other way makes the spring wrap itself tightly around the driving surface and the clutch locks up.

===Specialty clutches and applications===
{{Wikify|date=April 2011}}
* Single-revolution clutch: When inactive it is disengaged and the driven member is stationary. When &quot;tripped&quot;, it locks up solidly (typically in milliseconds or tens of ms) and rotates the driven member just one full turn. If the trip mechanism is operated when the clutch would otherwise disengage the clutch remains engaged. Variants include half-revolution (and other fractional-revolution) types. These were an essential part of printing telegraphs such as the Teletype page printers, as well as electric typewriters, notably the IBM Selectric. They were also found in motor-driven mechanical calculators; the Marchant had several of them. They are also used in farm machinery and industry. Typically, these were a variety of dog clutch.

Single-revolution clutches in teleprinters were of this type. Basically the spring was kept expanded (details below) and mostly out of contact with the driving sleeve, but nevertheless close to it. One end of the spring was attached to a sleeve surrounding the spring. The other end of the spring was attached to the driven member inside which the drive shaft could rotate freely. The sleeve had a projecting tooth, like a ratchet tooth. A spring-loaded pawl pressed against the sleeve and kept it from rotating. The wrap spring's torque kept the sleeve's tooth pressing against the pawl. To engage the clutch, an electromagnet attracted the pawl away from the sleeve. The wrap spring's torque rotated the sleeve which permitted the spring to contract and wrap tightly around the driving sleeve. Load torque tightened the wrap so it did not slip once engaged. If the pawl were held away from the sleeve the clutch would continue to drive the load without slipping. When the clutch was to disengage power was disconnected from the electromagnet and the pawl moved close to the sleeve. When the sleeve's tooth contacted the pawl the sleeve and the load's inertia unwrapped the spring to disengage the clutch. Considering that the drive motors in some of these (such as teleprinters for news wire services) ran 24 hours a day for years the spring could not be allowed to stay in close contact with the driving cylinder; wear would be excessive. The other end of the spring was fastened to a thick disc attached to the driven member. When the clutch locked up the driven mechanism coasted and its inertia rotated the disc until a tooth on it engaged a pawl that kept it from reversing. Together with the restraint at the other end of the spring created by the trip pawl and sleeve tooth, this kept the spring expanded to minimize contact with the driving cylinder. These clutches were lubricated with conventional oil, but the wrap was so effective that the lubricant did not defeat the grip. These clutches had long operating lives cycling for tens, maybe hundreds of millions of cycles without need of maintenance other than occasional lubrication with recommended oil.
*&quot;Cascaded-Pawl&quot; single-revolution clutches: These superseded wrap-spring single-revolution clutches in page printers, such as [[teleprinter]]s, including the Teletype Model 28 and its successors, using the same design principles. As well, the [[IBM Selectric typewriter]] had several of them. These were typically disc-shaped assemblies mounted on the drive shaft. Inside the hollow disc-shaped housing were two or three freely-floating pawls arranged so that when the clutch was tripped, the load torque on the first pawl to engage created force to keep the second pawl engaged, which in turn kept the third one engaged. The clutch did not slip once locked up. This sequence happened quite fast, on the order of milliseconds. The first pawl had a projection that engaged a trip lever. If the lever engaged the pawl, the clutch was disengaged. When the trip lever moved out of the way the first pawl engaged, creating the cascaded lockup just described. As the clutch rotated it would stay locked up if the trip lever were out of the way, but if the trip lever engaged the clutch would quickly unlock.

*&quot;Kickback&quot; clutch-brakes: These mechanisms were found in some types of synchronous-motor-driven electric clocks. Many different types of synchronous clock motors were used, including the pre-World War II Hammond manual-start clocks. Some types of self-starting synchronous motors always started when power was applied, but in detail, their behavior was chaotic and they were equally likely to start rotating in the wrong direction. Coupled to the rotor by one (or possibly two) stages of reduction gearing was a wrap-spring clutch-brake. The spring did not rotate. One end was fixed; the other was free. It rode freely but closely on the rotating member, part of the clock's gear train. The clutch-brake locked up when rotated backwards, but also had some spring action. The inertia of the rotor going backwards engaged the clutch and &quot;wound&quot; the spring. As it &quot;unwound&quot;, it re-started the motor in the correct direction. Some designs had no explicit spring as such; it was simply a compliant mechanism. The mechanism was lubricated; wear did not seem to be a problem.

'''Cow tipping''' or '''cow pushing''' is the purported activity of sneaking up on a sleeping, upright [[Cattle|cow]] and pushing it over for fun. As cattle do not sleep standing up, cow tipping is a myth.&lt;ref name=Cow1/&gt;

==Myth and reality==
According to the myth, cattle can easily be pushed over without much force because they are slow-moving, slow-witted and weak-legged, have a high center of gravity and sleep standing up. However, numerous publications have debunked cow-tipping as a myth. Cattle only doze while standing up, instead of sleeping, and are easily disturbed.&lt;ref name = Cow1&gt;{{cite news|last = Malvern|first = Jack|title = Cow-tipping myth hasn't got a leg to stand on|publisher = Times Online|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1858246,00.html|accessdate = 2006-10-28 | location=London | date=November 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, they represent over half a ton of weight that would easily resist lesser force. A variety of calculations have been performed to determine if cow tipping is physically possible.&lt;ref name = Cow1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Semke|first = Matt|title = The Statics of Cow Tipping|publisher = UNL College of Engineering and Mechanics Course Project|url = http://emweb.unl.edu/Mechanics-Pages/Matt-Semke/The%20Statics%20of%20Cow%20Tipping.htm|accessdate = 2007-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study led by Margo Lillie, a doctor of [[zoology]] at the [[University of British Columbia]], concludes that cow tipping by a single person is impossible. Her calculations found that it would take at least two people to apply enough force to push over a cow if the cow does not react and reorient its footing. If the cow does react, it would take at least four people to push it over. Professor Lillie noted that, contrary to the myth, cattle are well aware of their surroundings (they have excellent senses of smell and hearing) and are very difficult to sneak up on.&lt;ref name = Cow1/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Debunk&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last = Colebourn|first = John|title = Debunking rural myth of cow tipping: It's udder nonsense, academics contend|newspaper = Montreal Gazette|pages = A10|date = November 9, 2005|url=|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=FrontPage&amp;articleID=465&amp;month=11&amp;day=9&amp;year=2005 Cow-tipping a mooo-yth?] by Ian Denomme, The Gazette (Western Daily Student Newspaper), November 9, 2005.

The British media outlet ''[[Times Online]]'' has posted a detailed illustration of the force necessary to push over a cow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.thetimes.co.uk/TGD/picture/0,,242244,00.jpg Happy Torque - Force Required to Tip over a cow] at the Time Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses, on the other hand, regularly sleep standing up, due to a locking mechanism of their [[stifle joint]], a trait cows do not possess.

==History==
[[Julius Caesar]] and [[Pliny]] record a belief that European [[moose]] had no knee joints and could not get up if they fell over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Harper &amp; brothers | last = Caesar | first = Julius | coauthors = Aulus Hirtius | title = Caesar's Commentaries on the Gallic and civil wars | chapter = XXVII | page = 154 | year = 1879 | isbn = 0217452876 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10657/pg10657.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pliny the Elder, The Natural History (eds.

In 1255, [[Louis IX of France]] [[Sandwich, Kent#History|gave an elephant]] to [[Henry III of England]] for his [[menagerie]] in the [[Tower of London]]. Drawn from life by the historian [[Matthew Paris]] for his [[Chronica Majora]], it can be seen in his [[bestiary]] at [[Parker Library]] of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], with an accompanying text revealing that at the time, Europeans believed that elephants did not have [[knee]]s and so were unable to get up if they fell over. The bestiary contains a drawing depicting an elephant on its back being dragged along the ground by another elephant, with a caption stating that elephants lacked knees.&lt;ref&gt;Willene B.

==News==
In April 2008, four men in [[Naples, Florida]], who were arrested for damaging a gate to a communications tower in an open field, told police deputies that they had gone into the field and tipped over a cow. However, police stated this was impossible because there were no cattle within several miles of the field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2008/apr/22/cow-tipping-excuse-doesnt-fly-4-arrested/ 'Cow tipping' excuse doesn't fly; 4 arrested], Naples Daily News, April 22, 2008 (retrieved on January 12, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
Cow-tipping has appeared in a variety of media and entertainment. In the popular computer role-playing game series ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'', and other games such as ''[[Ultima Online]]'' and ''[[Asheron's Call]]'', players can push over cattle. In the 2006 animated movie ''[[Barnyard (film)|Barnyard]]'', a group of tough talking cattle from New Jersey go &quot;boy-tipping&quot; in response to similar behavior against cattle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.aol.com/video-detail/barnyard-the-original-party-animals-cow-tippingboy-tipping/1630119529 AOL Video Home &gt;Barnyard: The Original Party Animals - Cow Tipping] at AOL.com.&lt;/ref&gt; In another 2006 animation movie, ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', characters go &quot;tractor-tippin'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317219/quotes IMDB Memorable quotes for Cars (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1994 episode of the popular animated television series ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'', the two titular characters, after watching a milk ad on television, set out to tip over a cow, only to result in [[Beavis]] being crushed when the cow falls on him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/beavis-and-butthead/cow-tipping/episode/58212/summary.html Beavis and Butthead], Season 4, episode 2, Cow Tipping, first aired March 15, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Cow-tipping is also featured in the 1989 black comedy ''[[Heathers]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Larew |first=John L. |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1990/11/8/cow-tipping-is-a-load-of-bull/ |title=Cow-Tipping is a Load of Bull &amp;#124; The Harvard Crimson |publisher=Thecrimson.com |date=1990-11-08 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the 1995 [[Chris Farley]]-[[David Spade]] comedy film ''[[Tommy Boy]]''.

''The Official Cow-Tippers Handbook'' by Red McCoy and Duke Rightious is another example of how this urban legend has seeped into popular culture.

[[File:Solomon Ajax and Cassandra.jpg|thumb|right|''Ajax and Cassandra'' by [[Solomon Joseph Solomon]], 1886.]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Cassandra''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Κασσάνδρα}}, also {{lang|grc|Κασάνδρα, Κεσάνδρα,  Κατάνδρα}},&lt;ref&gt;[[Hjalmar Frisk]] (1970) notes &quot;unexplained etymology&quot;, citing &quot;various hypotheses&quot; found in  Schulze ''Kleine Schriften'' (1966), 698, Hoffmann ''Glotta'' 28, 52, Sturtevant ''Class. Phil.'' 21, 248f., J. Davreux ''La légende de la prophétesse Cassandre'' (Paris 1942) 90ff., Carnoy ''Les ét. class.'' 22, 344.&lt;/ref&gt;  also known as '''Alexandra'''&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lycophron]]'s poem ''Alexandra'', which was about Cassandra.&lt;/ref&gt;) was the daughter of King [[Priam]] and Queen [[Hecuba]] of [[Troy]].  Her beauty caused [[Apollo]] to grant her the gift of [[prophecy]]. In an alternative version, she spent a night at Apollo's temple, at which time the temple snakes licked her ears clean so that she was able to hear the future (this is a recurring theme in Greek mythology, though sometimes it brings an ability to understand the language of animals rather than an ability to know the future).&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Melampus]]; Athena cleaned the ears of [[Tiresias]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when she did not return his love, Apollo placed a curse on her so that no one would ever believe her predictions. She is a figure both of the [[Epic Cycle|epic tradition]] and of [[Greek tragedy|tragedy]], where her combination of deep understanding and powerlessness exemplify the tragic condition of humankind.

== History ==
Apollo's cursed gift became a source of endless pain and frustration.  In some versions of the myth, this is symbolized by the god spitting into her mouth; in other Greek versions, this act was sufficient to remove the gift so recently given by Apollo, but Cassandra's case varies.  From [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[The Oresteia|Agamemnon]]'', it appears that she has made a promise to Apollo to become his consort, but broke it, thus incurring his wrath: though she has retained the power of foresight, no one will believe her predictions.   

While Cassandra foresaw the destruction of Troy (she warned the Trojans about the [[Trojan Horse]], the death of [[Agamemnon]], and her own demise), she was unable to do anything to forestall these tragedies since no one believed her.  &lt;!--Her family believed she was mad, and according to some versions, kept her locked up.  In versions where she was [[incarcerate]]d, this was typically portrayed as driving her truly insane, although in versions where she was not, she is usually viewed as remaining simply misunderstood: not in Classical sources: move to relevant modern variants if you like--&gt;
[[Coroebus]] and [[Othronus]] came to the aid of Troy out of love for Cassandra.  Cassandra was also the first to see the body of her brother [[Hector]] being brought back to the city.

At the fall of Troy, she sought shelter in the temple of [[Athena]], where she was violently abducted and [[rape]]d by [[Ajax the Lesser]].  Cassandra was then taken as a [[concubine]] by King [[Agamemnon]] of [[Mycenae]]. Unbeknownst to Agamemnon, while he was away at war, his wife, [[Clytemnestra]], had begun an affair with [[Aegisthus]]. &lt;!--Upon Agamemnon and Cassandra's arrival in Mycenae, Clytemnestra asked her husband to walk across a [[purple]] (some versions say red) tapestry, a sign of [[hubris]].  He initially refused, fearing the wrath of the gods, but gave in, ignoring Cassandra's warnings. By walking on the tapestries, he was committing sacrilege.--&gt;  Clytemnestra and Aegisthus then murdered both Agamemnon and Cassandra. Some sources mention that Cassandra and Agamemnon had twin boys, Teledamus and Pelops, both of whom were killed by Aegisthus.
&lt;!--CAN WE GET A REFERENCE?[[Telephos]], the son of Heracles, loved Cassandra{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} but she scorned him and instead helped him seduce her sister [[Laodice]].--&gt;

==In Aeschylus' ''Agamemnon''==

[[Image:Aias Kassandra Louvre G458.jpg|thumb|150px|Ajax taking Cassandra, tondo of a [[red-figure]] [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] by the [[Kodros Painter]], ca. 440-430 BC, [[Louvre]]]]

In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia|Agamemnon]]'', the king, treading the scarlet cloth laid down for him, walks offstage to his sure death at line 972. After the chorus's ode of foreboding, time is suspended in Cassandra's &quot;[[mad scene]]&quot;, which does nothing to advance the action in any way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Seth L. |last=Schein |title=The Cassandra Scene in Aeschylus' 'Agamemnon' |journal=Greece &amp; Rome |series=Second Series |volume=29 |issue=1 |year=1982 |pages=11–16 |doi=10.1017/S0017383500028278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been onstage, silent and ignored. Her madness that is unleashed now is not the physical torment of other characters in [[Greek tragedy]], such as in [[Euripides]]' ''Heracles'' or [[Sophocles]]' ''Ajax'',&lt;ref&gt;Or descriptions of madness, such as that of Heracles in ''[[The Women of Trachis]]'' or [[Io (mythology)|Io]] in ''Prometheus Bound'', two further familiar examples cited by Schein 1982:11.&lt;/ref&gt; but she speaks, disconnectedly and transcendent, in the grip of her psychic possession by Apollo,&lt;ref&gt;The chorus find her to be &quot;crazed in mind and transported by a god&quot; (''Agamemnon'', 1140).&lt;/ref&gt; witnessing events past and future. &quot;She evokes the same awe, horror and pity as do [[schizophrenics]]&quot;, an observer&lt;ref&gt;Schein 1982:12&lt;/ref&gt; has noted, &quot;who often combine deep, true insight with utter helplessness, and who retreat into madness.&quot; Eduard Fraenkel remarked&lt;ref&gt;Fraenkel, ''Kleine Beiträge zur klassische Philologie'' , vol. I (Rome) 1964, 344-48, 375-87, noted in Schein 1982:11 note 6&lt;/ref&gt; on the powerful contrasts between declaimed and sung dialogue in this scene. The frightened and respectful chorus are unable to comprehend her. She goes to her inevitable offstage murder by [[Clytemnestra]] with full knowledge of what is to befall her.&lt;ref&gt;Analyses of the Cassandra scene are in [[Bernard Knox]]  ''Word and Action: Eassays on the Ancient theatre'' (Baltimore and London: Penguin) 1979:42-55; and more briefly, in Anne Lebeck, ''The Oresteia: A study in language and structure'' (Washington) 1971:52-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern adaptations ==
A modern psychological perspective on Cassandra is presented by [[Eric Shanower]] in ''[[Age of Bronze (comics)|Age of Bronze: Sacrifice]]''. In this version, Cassandra, as a child, is assaulted by a priest of [[Apollo]].

A similar situation occurred in [[Lindsay Clarke]]'s novel ''The Return from Troy'' (presented as a reawakened memory), where a priest of Apollo forced himself upon Cassandra and was stopped only when she spat in his mouth. When the priest used his benevolent reputation to convince Priam that he was innocent of her wild claims, Cassandra subsequently went insane.

The myth of Cassandra is also retold by German author [[Christa Wolf]] in ''[[Cassandra (novel)|Kassandra]]''. She retells the story from the point of view of Cassandra at the moment of her death and uses the myth as an allegory for both the unheard voice of the woman writer and the oppression and strict censorship laws of [[East Germany]].

[[File:Trojan women cassandra.jpg|thumb|left||Karen Tiegren (Cassandra)  in [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Trojan Women]],'' directed by [[Brad Mays]] at the [[ARK Theatre Company]] in [[Los Angeles]], 2003]]

Author [[William Faulkner]], in his novel ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'', writes of Rosa Coldfield, a principal character in the Sutpen Dynasty/Tragedy, and how her &quot;childhood ... consisted of a Cassandra-like listening beyond closed doors&quot;, alluding to both mythological concerns that (1) Cassandra was locked away, or behind closed doors (as with Rosa's youth), and (2) that Cassandra's prophecies were true, yet fated to be ignored (as with Rosa's premonitions about Thomas Sutpen and his desire to forge a dynasty).

The author [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] wrote a historical novel called ''[[The Firebrand]]'', which presents a story from Cassandra's point of view.
Marcus Sedgwick's novel ''The Foreshadowing'' features a [[protagonist]] named Alexandra who has the gift of foresight, though she sees mainly others' pain and death.

In Clemence McLaren's ''Inside the Walls of Troy'', Cassandra has a strong friendship with Queen Helen of Sparta when she came to Troy with Prince Paris. Cassandra essentially hates Helen but gives in to her unbearable joy and happiness and becomes Helen's &quot;confidante&quot;. At the end of the story instead of Cassandra being raped and taken as Agamemnon's &quot;battle-prize&quot;, she simply joins her two sisters, Polyxena and Laodice, at the temple of Athena. The rest of her story is left untold.

In [[David Gemmell]]'s Troy trilogy, Cassandra is credited with opening the mind of exiled Egyptian prince Gershom (Moses) to his own gift of prophecy. Cassandra got her gift after suffering from 'brain-fever' as a young child, and dies in the [[Minoan eruption|volcanic eruption of Thera]].

In the section ''Cassandra'' of ''Suggestions for Thought to Searchers after Religious Truth'', [[Florence Nightingale]] protests the over-feminization of women into near helplessness, such as what Nightingale saw in her mother's and older sister's lethargic lifestyle despite their education. The work also reflects her fear of her ideas being ineffective, as were Cassandra's.

In ''[[Hercules: The Animated Series]]'' (presented by Disney), [[Hercules]] befriends [[Icarus]] and Cassandra at his local high school.

In [[Hector Berlioz]]’s opera ''[[Les Troyens]]'' (1863), based on Virgil's ''[[The Aeneid]]'', Cassandra commits suicide with other Trojan women as Troy falls, rather than being raped by Ajax. She dies with the word “Italy” on her lips, presaging (in prophetess mode) her cousin [[Aeneas]]’s eventual founding of Rome.

In the TV series ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]'', [[Angela Patrelli]] compares herself to Cassandra in Season 3, Episode 21 when she states: &quot;I was Cassandra, screaming that the sky was falling, but when they looked up, there wasn't a cloud in sight.&quot;

===In popular culture===
In more modern literature, Cassandra has often served as a model for [[tragedy]] and [[romance (genre)|romance]], and has given rise to the archetypal character of someone whose prophetic insight is obscured by insanity, turning their revelations into riddles or disjointed statements that are not fully comprehended until after the fact. Some mythologies of the Arthurian Legends have [[Merlin]] living backwards, therefore telling of the future, that nobody believes. [[Magician Humphrey]] from the [[Xanth]] book series reads answer from the Book of Answers, telling the clients the answers to their questions in obscure riddles. 

Notable examples are: 
*the character of [[River Tam]] from the [[science fiction]] TV series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''; 
*the character Cassandra in the TV series ''[[The X-Files]]'' (an alien abductee that nobody took seriously); 
*the character Cassandra (Cassie) Newton in the TV series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''; 
*the character of James Cole from the [[science fiction]] movie ''[[12 Monkeys]]''; 
*the character of Jack Godell in the 1979 film &quot;[[The China Syndrome]]&quot;; and 
*the science fiction short story &quot;[[Cassandra (short story)|Cassandra]]&quot; by [[C. J. Cherryh]]. 
*the character Cassandra in the sci-fi television series [[Red Dwarf]], a supercomputer who could predict the future.

In ''[[Scream 2]]'', Neve Campbell's character Sidney is attacked during a rehearsal of a stage performance of Cassandra where she plays the lead. This mirrors a frequently tragic theme of Sidney's character that she often warns those around her of the danger the killer poses but is frequently ignored. 

The character of Fiver in ''Watership Down'' can be considered as a classical allusion to Cassandra. Also in the Secret Circle series of teen books by L.J. Smith, the main character Cassandra (Cassie) Blake is told by her grandmother she has &quot;the sight&quot; but not even her own kind can believe it sometimes.

The 1976 disaster movie ''[[The Cassandra Crossing]]'' features a dis-used railroad bridge called the &quot;Cassandra Crossing&quot;. It is mentioned in the film that because of the name, the people who lived under it moved away, in fear that it would collapse. Later on in the film, a train carrying a plague travels along the bridge and it collapses, killing thousands of people.

===In music===
Metalcore band Fear Before (formerly Fear Before the March of Flames) recorded a song titled &quot;Taking Cassandra to the End of the World Party&quot; which has a Cassandra predicting the future but no one believes her. 

Heavy Metal group [[Blind Guardian]] recorded a song titled &quot;And Then There Was Silence&quot; about Cassandra and the fall of Troy.

Pop group [[ABBA]] recorded a song titled &quot;Cassandra&quot; about her. 

Singer-songwriter Al Stewart's song entitled [http://www.alstewart.com/publicfiles/LYRICS_helenandcassandra.htm 'Helen and Cassandra'] dramatically portrays the enigma of Cassandra's plight, knowing the future yet not being believed.

[[Gothic Metal]] pioneers [[Theatre of Tragedy]] recorded a songed titled &quot;[[Cassandra (song)|Cassandra]]&quot; on their album [[Aégis]]. The song was the first and only single off the album.

Singer-songwriter Ismael Serrano recorded a song called &quot;Cassandra&quot; comparing Cassandra's history with people claiming for peace who weren't listened.

Singer-songwriter Leni Ward produced a track called Cassandra, on her album Hope, which was about how Cassandra was right but how she never listened to her advise.

===The columnist &quot;Cassandra&quot;===
&quot;Cassandra&quot; has been a long-running opinion-page feature in the British tabloid the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{for|other uses|Couplet (disambiguation)}}

A '''couplet''' is a pair of lines of [[Meter (poetry)|meter]] in poetry. It usually consists of two lines that rhyme and have the same meter.
While traditionally couplets rhyme, not all do.  A poem may use white space to mark out couplets if they do not rhyme. Couplets with a meter of [[iambic pentameter]] are called ''[[heroic couplet]]s''. The [[Poetic epigram]] is also in the couplet form. Couplets can also appear in more complex rhyme schemes. For example, [[Shakespearean]] [[sonnet]]s end with a couplet.

Rhyming couplets are one of the simplest rhyme schemes in poetry. [[Chaucer]]'s [[The Canterbury Tales]] are written in rhyming couplets. [[John Dryden]] in the 17th century and [[Alexander Pope]] in the 18th century were both well known for their writing in heroic couplets.

Because the rhyme comes so quickly in rhyming couplets, it tends to call attention to itself. Good rhyming couplets tend to &quot;snap&quot; as both the rhyme and the idea come to a quick close in two lines. Here are some examples of rhyming couplets where the sense as well as the sound &quot;rhymes&quot;:

:: True wit is nature to advantage dress'd;
:: What oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd.
:: &amp;mdash; Alexander Pope

:: Whether or not we find what we are seeking
:: is idle, biologically speaking.
:: &amp;mdash; [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] (at the end of a sonnet)

On the other hand, because rhyming couplets have such a predictable rhyme scheme, they can feel artificial and plodding. Here is a Pope parody of the predictable rhymes of his era:
:: Where-e'er you find &quot;the cooling western breeze,&quot;
:: In the next line, it &quot;whispers through the trees;&quot;
:: If crystal streams &quot;with pleasing murmurs creep,&quot;
:: The reader's threatened (not in vain) with &quot;sleep.&quot;

==Couplets in Chinese poetry==
Chinese couplets known as [[duilian]] or &quot;contrapuntal couplets&quot; may be seen on doorways in Chinese communities worldwide. Couplets displayed as part of the [[Chinese New Year]] festival, on the first morning of the New Year, are called ''chunlian''. These are usually purchased at a market a few days before and glued to the doorframe. The text of the couplets is often traditional and contains hopes for prosperity. Other chunlian reflect more recent concerns. For example, the [[CCTV New Year's Gala]] usually promotes couplets reflecting current political themes in [[mainland China]].

Some Chinese couplets may consists as simple as two lines of four [[Chinese character|characters]] each.  Couplets are read from top to bottom where the first line starts from the right.

==Couplets in Indian poetry==
Rhyming couplets are also used in other poetic traditions, including non-Western ones. [[Kural]]s, which are a subclass of the [[Venpa]] class of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] poetry, are couplets. [[Tirukkural]] is a popular book written in [[Kural|Kural Venpa]] form. In Hindi, there are other kinds of couplets as well, including: [[Doha (poetry)|Doha]], Sortha, [[Chaupai (poetry)|Chaupai]], Chhand etc. 

Hindi poets such as [[Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana|Rahim]], [[Kabir]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Bihari (poet)|Bihari]], [[Surdas]] and many more were pioneers in this form.

==Couplets in hip-hop music==
Couplets are the most common type of [[rhyme scheme]] in [[old school rap]]&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Adam, 2009, ''[[Book of Rhymes]]: The Poetics of Hip-Hop'', Basic Civitas Books, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and are still commonly used in today's [[hip-hop music]] and [[rapping]],&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; though more complex [[rhyme scheme]]s have progressively become more frequently employed.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Adam, 2009, ''[[Book of Rhymes]]: The Poetics of Hip-Hop'', Basic Civitas Books, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
'''School Lunch'''

Burgers, prunes, and warm spaghetti

To eat this stuff I'm not ready

'''Thin'''

Scrawny, slender, skinny, slight

Your plump friends tell you you're too light

'''Weird'''

Bizarre, strange, and spooky things

Books and stories by Stephen King

'''Outlaw'''

Pirate, bandit, thief or crook

At them the judge should throw the book

'''Math'''

Boring, dull, uninteresting, tiresome

These are some reasons I'm so dumb

'''Charlotte Brontë''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|r|ɒ|n|t|i}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Bront%C3%AB American Heritage and Collins dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Bront%C3%AB Columbia Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; 21 April 1816 &amp;ndash; 31 March 1855) was an English novelist and poet, the eldest of the three [[Brontë]] sisters, whose novels are [[English literature]] standards. She wrote ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' under the pen name '''Currer Bell.'''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Charlotte Brontë: A Brief Biography. Victorian Web. &lt;http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/bronte/cbronte/brontbio.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Charlotte was born in [[thornton, West Yorkshire|Thornton]], [[Yorkshire]] in 1816, the third of six children, to [[Maria Branwell|Maria]] (née Branwell) and her husband [[Patrick Brontë]] (formerly surnamed Brunty or Prunty), an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Anglican]] [[clergyman]]. In 1820, the [[Brontë|family]] moved a few miles to [[Haworth]], where Patrick had been appointed [[Perpetual curate|Perpetual Curate]]. Mrs. Brontë died of cancer on 15 September 1821, leaving five daughters and a son to be taken care of by her aunt Elizabeth Branwell. In August 1824, Charlotte was sent with three of her sisters, [[Emily Brontë|Emily]], Maria, and Elizabeth, to the Clergy Daughters' School at [[Cowan Bridge]] in [[Lancashire]] (which she would describe as Lowood School in ''[[Jane Eyre]]''). Its poor conditions, Charlotte maintained, permanently affected her health and physical development and hastened the deaths of her two elder sisters, Maria (born 1814) and Elizabeth (born 1815), who died of [[tuberculosis]] in June 1825. Soon after their father removed them from the school.&lt;ref name=&quot;fraser&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Fraser|first=Rebecca|title=Charlotte Brontë: A Writer's Life| publisher =Pegasus Books LLC|location=45 Wall Street, Suite 1021 New York, NY 10005|year=2008|edition=2|isbn=978-1-933648-88-0|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At home in [[Haworth Parsonage]]&amp;mdash;a small rectory close to the graveyard of a bleak, windswept village on the Yorkshire moors&amp;mdash;Charlotte acted as &quot;the motherly friend and guardian of her younger sisters&quot;.  She and the other surviving children&amp;mdash; [[Branwell Brontë|Branwell]], [[Emily Brontë|Emily]], and [[Anne Brontë|Anne]] — began chronicling the lives and struggles of the inhabitants of their imaginary kingdoms. Charlotte and Branwell wrote Byronic stories about their country — Angria — and Emily and Anne wrote articles and poems about theirs — Gondal. The sagas were elaborate and convoluted (and still exist in partial manuscripts) and provided them with an obsessive interest during childhood and early adolescence, which prepared them for their literary vocations in adulthood.

Charlotte continued her education at Roe Head, [[Mirfield]], from 1831 to 32, where she met her lifelong friends and correspondents, [[Ellen Nussey]] and Mary Taylor.&lt;ref name=&quot;fraser&quot;/&gt; During this period, she wrote her novella ''The Green Dwarf'' (1833) under the name of Wellesley. Charlotte returned as a teacher from 1835 to 1838. In 1839, she took up the first of many positions as governess to various families in [[Yorkshire]], a career she pursued until 1841.

Politically a [[Tory]], she preached tolerance rather than revolution.  She held high moral principles, and, despite her shyness in company, she was always prepared to argue her beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newstatesman.com/200305050048 | date = 5 May 2003 | publisher = New Statesman |title=Michele Roberts on Charlotte Bronte, the gourmet|accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Brontë.org.uk | url = http://www.bronte.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=106&amp;Itemid=116|title=Charlotte Brontë |accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1842 she and Emily travelled to [[Brussels]] to enroll in a boarding school run by [[Constantin Heger]] (1809&amp;ndash;96) and his wife Claire Zoé Parent Heger (1814&amp;ndash;91). In return for board and tuition, Charlotte taught English and Emily taught music. Their time at the boarding school was cut short when Elizabeth Branwell, their aunt who joined the family after the death of their mother to look after the children, died of internal obstruction in October 1842. Charlotte returned alone to Brussels in January 1843 to take up a teaching post at the boarding school. Her second stay at the boarding school was not a happy one; she became lonely, homesick and deeply attached to [[Constantin Heger]]. She finally returned to Haworth in January 1844 and later used her time at the boarding school as the inspiration for some of ''[[The Professor (novel)|The Professor]]'' and ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]''.

In May 1846, Charlotte, Emily, and Anne published a joint collection of poetry under the assumed names of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. Although only two copies were sold, the sisters continued writing for publication and began their first novels. Charlotte used &quot;Currer Bell&quot; when she published her first two novels. Of this, Brontë later wrote:

{{quote| Averse to personal publicity, we veiled our own names under those of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell; the ambiguous choice being dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine, while we did not like to declare ourselves women, because—without at that time suspecting that our mode of writing and thinking was not what is called 'feminine' — we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice; we had noticed how critics sometimes use for their chastisement the weapon of personality, and for their reward, a flattery, which is not true praise.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Biographical Notice of Ellis And Acton Bell&quot;, from the preface to the 1910 edition of ''Wuthering Heights''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Indeed, her novels were deemed coarse by the critics.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Rebecca. ''Charlotte Bronte: A Writer's Life''. New York: Pegasus, 2008, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; There was speculation about the identity of Currer Bell, and whether Bell was a man or a woman.

[[File:Jane Eyre title page.jpg|thumb|Title page of the first edition of ''[[Jane Eyre]]'']]
Charlotte's brother, Branwell, the only son of the family, died of [[chronic bronchitis]] and [[marasmus]] exacerbated by heavy drinking in September 1848, although Charlotte believed his death was due to [[tuberculosis]]. Branwell was also a suspected &quot;[[opium]] eater&quot;, (i.e. a [[laudanum]] addict). Emily and Anne both died of pulmonary tuberculosis in December 1848 and May 1849, respectively.

Charlotte and her father were now left alone together. In view of the enormous success of ''[[Jane Eyre (novel)|Jane Eyre]]'', she was persuaded by her publisher to visit [[London]] occasionally, where she revealed her true identity and began to move in a more exalted social circle, becoming friends with [[Harriet Martineau]], [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and [[G. H. Lewes]]. Her book had sparked a movement in regards to [[feminism]] in literature. The main character, [[Jane Eyre (character)|Jane Eyre]], in her novel ''Jane Eyre'', was a parallel to herself, a woman who was strong. However, she never left Haworth for more than a few weeks at a time as she did not want to leave her aging father's side.

Thackeray’s daughter, the writer  [[Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie]] recalled a visit to her father by Charlotte Brontë:

{{quote|…two gentlemen come in, leading a tiny, delicate, serious, little lady, with fair straight hair, and steady eyes. She may be a little over thirty; she is dressed in a little ''barège'' dress with a pattern of faint green moss. She enters in mittens, in silence, in seriousness; our hearts are beating with wild excitement. This then is the authoress, the unknown power whose books have set all London talking, reading, speculating; some people even say our father wrote the books – the wonderful books…  The moment is so breathless that dinner comes as a relief to the solemnity of the occasion, and we all smile as my father stoops to offer his arm; for, genius though she may be, Miss Brontë can barely reach his elbow. My own personal impressions are that she is somewhat grave and stern, specially to forward little girls who wish to chatter…  Every one waited for the brilliant conversation which never began at all. Miss Brontë retired to the sofa in the study, and murmured a low word now and then to our kind governess… the conversation grew dimmer and more dim, the ladies sat round still expectant, my father was too much perturbed by the gloom and the silence to be able to cope with it at all… after Miss Brontë had left, I was surprised to see my father opening the front door with his hat on. He put his fingers to his lips, walked out into the darkness, and shut the door quietly behind him… long afterwards… Mrs. Procter asked me if I knew what had happened… It was one of the dullest evenings [Mrs Procter] had ever spent in her life… the ladies who had all come expecting so much delightful conversation, and the gloom and the constraint, and how finally, overwhelmed by the situation, my father had quietly left the room, left the house, and gone off to his club.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie. Chapters from Some Memoirs. cited in Sutherland, James (ed.) ''The Oxford Book of Literary Ancedotes''. OUP, 1975. ISBN 0198121393.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In June 1854, Charlotte married Arthur Bell Nicholls, her father's [[curate]] and, in the opinion of many scholars, the model for several of her literary characters such as ''Jane Eyre's'' Rochester and St. John. She became pregnant soon after the marriage. Her health declined rapidly during this time, and according to Gaskell, her earliest biographer, she was attacked by &quot;sensations of perpetual nausea and ever-recurring faintness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/LIVING/worklife/09/25/mf.plot.twists/ | title = Real life plot twists of famous authors | publisher = CNN | date = 25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlotte died, along with her unborn child, on 31 March 1855, at the young age of 38. Her death certificate gives the cause of death as [[phthisis]] (tuberculosis), but many biographers suggest she may have died from dehydration and malnourishment, caused by excessive vomiting from severe [[morning sickness]] or [[hyperemesis gravidarum]]. There is also evidence to suggest that Charlotte died from [[typhus]] she may have caught from Tabitha Ackroyd, the Brontë household's oldest servant, who died shortly before her. Charlotte was interred in the family vault in The Church of St. Michael and All Angels, Haworth, West Yorkshire, England.

''[[The Life of Charlotte Brontë]]'', the posthumous biography of Charlotte Brontë by Gaskell, was the first of many biographies about Charlotte to be published. Though frank in places, Gaskell suppressed details of Charlotte's love for Heger, a married man, as being too much of an affront to contemporary morals and as a possible source of distress to Charlotte's still-living friends, father and husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Lane | year = 1853 | pages = 178–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gaskell also provided doubtful and inaccurate information about Patrick Brontë, claiming, for example, that he did not allow his children to eat meat.  This is refuted by one of Emily Brontë's diary papers, in which she describes the preparation of meat and potatoes for dinner at the parsonage, as [[Juliet Barker]] points out in her recent biography, ''The Brontës''.

Posthumously, her first-written novel was published in 1857, the fragment she worked on in her last years in 1860 (twice completed by recent authors, the more famous version being ''[[Emma Brown]]: A Novel from the Unfinished Manuscript by Charlotte Brontë'' by [[Clare Boylan]], 2003), and much Angria material over the ensuing decades.

'''Charles Walter Stansby Williams''' (20 September 1886 – 15 May 1945) was a British poet, novelist, theologian, literary critic, and member of the [[Inklings]].

== Biography ==
Williams was born in London in 1886, the only son of Richard and Mary Williams of Islington. He had one sister, Edith, born in 1889. Educated at [[St Albans School (Hertfordshire)|St Albans School]], [[Hertfordshire]], Williams was awarded a scholarship to [[University College London]], but was forced to leave in 1904 without taking a degree because his family lacked the financial resources to support him. In the same year he began work in a [[Methodist]] Bookroom. Williams was hired by [[Oxford University Press]] as a proofreading assistant in 1908 before quickly climbing to the position of editor. He continued to work at OUP in various positions of increasing responsibility until his death in 1945. One of his greatest editorial achievements was the publication of the first major English-language edition of the works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]].&lt;ref&gt;See - From A Publisher’s Point Of View: Charles Williams’s Role In Publishing Kierkegaard In English -- online&lt;/ref&gt;

Although chiefly remembered as a novelist, Williams also published poetry, works of literary criticism, theology, drama, history, biography, and a voluminous number of book reviews. Some of his best known novels are ''War in Heaven'' (1930), ''[[Descent into Hell]]'' (1937), and ''All Hallows' Eve'' (1945). [[T. S. Eliot]], who wrote an introduction for the last of these, described Williams’s novels as &quot;supernatural thrillers&quot; because they explore the sacramental intersection of the physical with the spiritual while also examining the ways in which power, even spiritual power, can corrupt as well as sanctify. All of Williams’ fantasies, unlike those of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and most of those of [[C. S. Lewis]], are set in the contemporary world. More recent writers of fantasy novels with contemporary settings, notably [[Tim Powers]], cite Williams as a model and inspiration. [[W. H. Auden]], one of Williams’ greatest admirers, reportedly re-read Williams’s extraordinary and highly unconventional history of the church, ''Descent of the Dove'' (1939), every year. Williams’s study of Dante entitled ''The Figure of Beatrice'' (1944) was very highly regarded at its time of publication and continues to be consulted by [[Dante]] scholars today. Williams, however, regarded his most important work to be his extremely dense and complex [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] poetry, of which two books were published, ''Taliessin through Logres'' (1938) and ''The Region of the Summer Stars'' (1944), and more remained unfinished at his death. Some of Williams’ best essays were collected and published in [[Anne Ridler]]'s ''Image of the City and Other Essays'' in 1958.

Williams gathered many followers and disciples during his lifetime. He was, for a period, a member of the Salvator Mundi Temple of the [[Fellowship of the Rosy Cross]]. He met fellow Anglican [[Evelyn Underhill]] (who was affiliated with a similar group, the [[Order of the Golden Dawn]]) in 1937 and was later to write the introduction to her published ''Letters'' in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~dcandmkw/spirit/eucw%20-%20int.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also formed master-disciple relationships with young women throughout his lifetime. The best known (though probably not the most significant) of these occurred in the early 1940s with Lois Lang Sims. Lang Sims, whom Williams referred to as Lalage, published a series of letters that Williams wrote to her during this period in a volume entitled ''Letters to Lalage'' (1989). Though Williams married his first sweetheart, Florence Conway, in 1917, he continually struggled to reconcile a lifelong (though probably unconsummated) love affair with Phyllis Jones (who joined the [[Oxford University Press]] in 1924 as librarian) with his Christian faith (he was an unswerving and devoted member of the [[Church of England]], reputedly with a tolerance of the scepticism of others and a firm belief in the necessity of a &quot;doubting Thomas&quot; in any apostolic body).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Although Williams attracted the attention and admiration of some of the most notable writers of his day, including [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[W. H. Auden]], his greatest admirer was probably [[C. S. Lewis]], whose novel ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' was at the time regarded as entirely inspired by Williams's novels. Williams came to know Lewis after reading Lewis’s recently published study ''[[The Allegory of Love]]''; he was so impressed he jotted down a letter of congratulations and dropped it in the mail. Coincidentally, Lewis had just finished reading Williams’s novel ''[[The Place of the Lion]]'' and had written a similar note of congratulations. The letters crossed in the mail and led to an enduring and fruitful friendship. When [[World War II]] broke out in 1939, [[Oxford University Press]] moved its offices from [[London]] to [[Oxford]]. Although Williams was reluctant to leave his beloved city, this move did allow him to participate regularly in Lewis’s literary society known as the [[Inklings]]. In this setting Williams was able to read (and improve) his final published novel, ''All Hallows' Eve'', as well as to hear [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] read some of his early drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' aloud to the group. In addition to meeting in Lewis’ rooms at Oxford, they also regularly met at [[The Eagle and Child]] pub in Oxford (better known by its nickname &quot;The Bird and Baby&quot;). During this time Williams also gave lectures at [[Oxford]] on [[John Milton]] and received an honorary M.A. degree. Williams is buried in [[Holywell Cemetery]], Oxford: his headstone bears the word &quot;poet&quot;.

== Williams’s novels ==
* ''War in Heaven'' (1930) — The [[Holy Grail]] surfaces in an obscure country parish and becomes variously a sacramental object to protect or a vessel of power to exploit.
* ''Many Dimensions'' (1931) — An evil antiquarian illegally purchases the fabled Stone of Suleiman (Williams uses this Muslim form rather than the more familiar [[King Solomon]]) from its Islamic guardian in [[Baghdad]] and returns to England to discover not only that the Stone can multiply itself infinitely without diminishing the original, but that it also allows its possessor to transcend the barriers of space and time.
* ''[[The Place of the Lion]]'' (1931) — [[Platonism|Platonic]] [[archetypes]] begin to appear around an English country town, wreaking havoc and drawing to the surface the spiritual strengths and flaws of individual characters.
* ''Shadows of Ecstasy'' (1931) — A humanistic adept has discovered that by focusing his energies inward he can extend his life almost indefinitely. He undertakes an experiment using African lore to die and resurrect his own body thereby assuring his immortality. His followers begin a revolutionary movement to destroy European civilization.
* ''The Greater Trumps'' (1932) — The original [[Tarot]] is used to unlock enormous metaphysical powers by allowing the possessors to see across space and time, create matter, and raise powerful natural storms.
* ''[[Descent into Hell]]'' (1937) — Generally thought to be Williams’s best novel, ''Descent'' deals with various forms of selfishness, and how the cycle of sin brings about the necessity for redemptive acts. In it, an academic becomes so far removed from the world that he fetishizes a woman to the extent that his perversion takes the form of a [[succubus]]. Characters include a [[doppelgänger]] and the ghost of a suicidal [[Victorian era|Victorian]] builder. It is illustrative of Williams’s belief in the replacement of sin and substitutional love.
* ''All Hallows' Eve'' (1945) — Opens with a discussion between the ghosts of two dead women wandering about London. Ultimately explores the meaning of human suffering and empathy by dissolving the barrier between the living and the dead through both black magic and divine love.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Apium graveolens''''' is a plant species in the family [[Apiaceae]] commonly known as '''celery''' (var. ''dulce'') or '''[[celeriac]]''' (var. ''rapaceum'') depending on whether the [[petiole (botany)|petiole]]s (stalks) or [[root]]s are eaten.

==Etymology==
First attested in English 1664, the word ''celery'' derives from the [[French language|French]] ''céleri'', in turn from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''seleri'', the plural of ''selero'', which comes from [[Late Latin]] ''selinon'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dselinon selinon], 
Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] σέλινον (''selinon''), &quot;parsley&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dse%2Flinon σέλινον], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=celery Etymonline], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest attested form of the word is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''se-ri-no'', written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ Palaeolexicon], Word study tool of ancient languages&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ancient Greek colony of [[Selinunte|Selinous]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Σελινοῦς, ''Selinoūs''), on [[Sicily]], was named after wild parsley that grew abundantly there; Selinountian coins depicted a parsley leaf as the symbol of the city.

==Taxonomy==
Celery was described by [[Carl von Linné]] in Volume One of his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753.&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} {{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Species Plantarum: Tomus I | publisher=Holmiae. (Laurentii Salvii). | year=1753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closely related ''[[Apium bermejoi]]'' from the island of [[Minorca]] is one of the rarest plants in Europe, with fewer than 100 individuals left.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN Redlist: {{IUCNlink|61608|Apium bermejo}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
{{nutritional value | name=Celery, raw | water=95 g | kJ=57 | protein=0.7 g | fat=0.2 g | carbs=3 g | sugars=1.4 g | fibre=1.6 g | vitC_mg=3 | source_usda=1 }}
''Apium graveolens'' is used around the world as a vegetable, either for the crisp petiole (leaf stalk) or the fleshy toproot.

In temperate countries celery is also grown for its seeds. Actually very small fruit, these &quot;seeds&quot; yield a valuable [[Essential oil|volatile oil]] used in the perfume and pharmaceutical industries. They also contain an [[organic compound]] called [[apiol]]. Celery seeds can be used as flavouring or spice, either as whole seeds or ground and mixed with salt, as [[celery salt]]. Celery salt can also be made from an extract of the roots. Celery salt is used as a seasoning, in cocktails (notably to enhance the flavour of [[Bloody Mary (cocktail)|Bloody Mary]] cocktails), on the [[Chicago-style hot dog]], and in [[Old Bay Seasoning]]. 

Celery, onions, and bell peppers are the [[holy trinity (cuisine)|holy trinity]] of [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Louisiana Creole]] and [[Cajun cuisine]]. Celery, onions, and carrots make up the French [[mirepoix (cuisine)|mirepoix]], often used as a base for sauces and soups. Celery is a staple in many soups, such as chicken noodle soup.

===Medicine===
[[Image:Celery seed.jpg|right|thumb|Celery seeds]]
[[Image:Celery cross section.jpg|thumb|left|Cross-section of a Pascal celery rib.]]
The use of celery seed in pills for relieving pain was described by [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] ca. 30 AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Celsus/home.html Celsus, ''de Medicina'', Thayer translation]&lt;/ref&gt; Celery seeds contain a compound called 3-N-butyl-phthalide that has been demonstrated to lower blood pressure in rats.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Thought to be an [[aphrodisiac]] by some people because it is thought to contain [[androsterone]], a metabolic product of [[testosterone]]. However, this is a misunderstanding of [[androstenone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shapefit.com/celery-pheromones.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bergapten]] in the seeds can increase photosensitivity, so the use of [[essential oil]] externally in bright sunshine should be avoided.  However, this is a potentially useful action in [[psoriasis]], with caution, and celery along with other [[umbellifers]] is one of the vegetables to be included in the diet as a source of [[psoralens]] for this purpose according to herbalists.  It should also be noted that this may constitute a risk factor in skin cancer.  The oil and large doses of seeds should be avoided during pregnancy, as they can act as a uterine stimulant. Seeds intended for cultivation are not suitable for eating as they are often treated with fungicides.

A common use for the seeds is as a &quot;blood purifier&quot; and it is sometimes taken for [[arthritis]].

===Nutrition===
Celery is used in [[weight-loss]] diets, where it provides low-calorie [[dietary fibre]] bulk. Celery seeds are also a great source of calcium, and are regarded as a good alternative to animal products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soystache.com/calcium.htm Calcium sources]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allergies==
Celery is among a small group of foods (headed by [[peanut]]s) that appear to provoke the most severe allergic reactions; for people with celery allergy, exposure can cause potentially fatal [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic shock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8337856&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Celery root&amp;mdash;commonly eaten as [[celeriac]], or put into drinks&amp;mdash;is known to contain more allergen than the stalk. Seeds contain the highest levels of allergen content.

An allergic reaction also may be triggered by eating foods that have been processed with machines that have previously processed celery, making avoiding such foods difficult. In contrast with peanut allergy being most prevalent in the US, celery allergy is most prevalent in [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12958180&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Union]], foods that contain or may contain celery, even in trace amounts, have to be clearly marked as such.

==History==
Daniel Zohary and Maria Hopf&lt;ref&gt;D. Zohary and M. Hopf, ''Domestication of Plants in the Old World'', (3rd ed. 2000) p.202.&lt;/ref&gt; note that celery leaves and [[inflorescence]]s were part of the garlands found in the tomb of pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]] (died 1323 BC), and celery [[mericarp]]s dated to the 7th century BC were recovered in the [[Heraion of Samos]]. However, they note &quot;since ''A. graveolens'' grows wild in these areas it is hard to decide whether these remains represent wild or cultivated forms.&quot; Only by classical times is it certain that celery was cultivated.

M. Fragiska mentions an archeological find of celery dating to the 9th century BC, at [[Kastanas]]; however, the literary evidence for [[ancient Greece]] is far more abundant. In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', the horses of the [[Myrmidons]] graze on wild celery that grows in the marshes of [[Troy]], and in ''[[Odyssey]]'' there is mention of the meadows of violet and wild celery surrounding the cave of [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]].&lt;ref name=Fragiska&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Fragiska, M. | year = 2005 | title = Wild and Cultivated Vegetables, Herbs and Spices in Greek Antiquity | url =  | journal = Environmental Archaeology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 73–82 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural depictions===
[[File:Celery (apium).jpg|thumb|''[[Apium]]'' illustration from Barbarus Apuleius' ''Herbarium'', circa 1400.]]
A [[Chthonic|chthonian]] symbol among the ancient Greeks, celery was said to have sprouted from the blood of [[Cabeiri|Kadmilos]], father of the [[Cabeiri]], chthonian divinities celebrated in [[Samothrace]], [[Lemnos]] and [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]]. The spicy odour and dark leaf colour encouraged this association with the cult of death. In classical Greece celery leaves were used as garlands for the dead, and the wreaths of the winners at the [[Isthmian Games]] were first made of celery before being replaced by crowns made of [[pine]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny's Natural History|Pliny, ''Natural History'']] XIX.46.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] the garland worn by the winners of the sacred [[Nemean Games]] was also made of celery.&lt;ref name=Fragiska/&gt;  &lt;!--is this needed?Celery is eaten at the end of each adventure by [[the Wonder Pets]] in the American animated children's television series.--&gt;

The name ''celery'' retraces the plant's route of successive adoption in European cooking, as the English ''celery'' (1664)  is derived from the French ''céleri'' coming from the [[Lombard language|Lombard term]], ''seleri'', from the Latin ''selinon'', borrowed from Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'', ''s.v.'' &quot;Celery&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Celery's Mediterranean origins are still commemorated in the French expression ''céleri d'Italie''.

Celery's surprisingly late arrival in the English kitchen is an end-product of the long tradition of seed selection needed to reduce the sap's bitterness and increase its sugars. By 1699 [[John Evelyn]] could recommend it in his ''Acetaria. A Discourse of [[Salad|Sallets]]'': &quot;Sellery, apium Italicum, (and of the Petroseline Family) was formerly a stranger with us (nor very long since in Italy) is an hot and more generous sort of Macedonian [[Parsley|Persley]] or Smallage...and for its high and grateful Taste is ever plac'd in the middle of the Grand [[Salad|Sallet]], at our Great Mens tables, and Praetors feasts, as the Grace of the whole Board&quot;.

==Cultivation==

[[Image:Céleri-rave-fendu.jpg|thumb|left|Celery root, or [[Celeriac]], is also used as a vegetable.]]

''Apium graveolens'' grows to 1&amp;nbsp;m tall. The leaves are pinnate to bipinnate leaves with rhombic leaflets 3&amp;ndash;6&amp;nbsp;cm long and 2&amp;ndash;4&amp;nbsp;cm broad. The flowers are creamy-white, 2&amp;ndash;3&amp;nbsp;mm diameter, produced in dense compound [[umbel]]s. The seeds are broad ovoid to globose, 1.5&amp;ndash;2&amp;nbsp;mm long and wide.  

In North America, commercial production of celery is dominated by the varieties called Pascal celery.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. de Vilmorin (1950) ''Pascal celery and its origin'' Journal of the New York Botanical Garden'' ''' 51''' pp 39-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Gardeners can grow a range of [[cultivar]]s, many of which differ little from the wild species, mainly in having stouter leaf stems. They are ranged under two classes, white and red; the white cultivars being generally the best flavoured, and the most crisp and tender.
The stalks grow in tight straight parallel bunches, and are typically marketed fresh that way, without roots and just a little green leaf remaining.

The wild form of celery is known as ''smallage''. It has a furrowed stalk with wedge-shaped leaves, the whole plant having a coarse, earthy taste, and a distinctive smell. The stalks are not usually eaten (except in soups or stews in [[French cuisine]]), but the leaves may be used in salads, and its seeds are those sold as a spice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/pages/smallage | title=Smallage | publisher=Practically Edible: The World's Biggest Food Encyclopedia | accessdate=2009-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; With cultivation and blanching, the stalks lose their acidic qualities and assume the mild, sweetish, aromatic taste particular to celery as a salad plant. 

The plants are raised from seed, sown either in a hot bed or in the open garden according to the season of the year, and after one or two thinnings out and transplantings they are, on attaining a height of 15&amp;ndash;20&amp;nbsp;cm, planted out in deep trenches for convenience of blanching, which is effected by earthing up to exclude light from the stems. 

In the past, celery was grown as a vegetable for winter and early spring; it was perceived as a cleansing [[Medication#For nutrition|tonic]], welcomed to counter the salt-sickness of a winter diet. By the 19th century the season for celery had been extended, to last from the beginning of September to late in April.&lt;ref&gt;William Robinson and W. P. Thomson, ''The Vegetable Garden'' (3rd ed., 1920), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harvesting and storage==
Harvesting occurs when the average size of celery in a field is marketable; due to extremely uniform crop growth, fields are harvested only once.  [[Petiole (botany)|Petiole]]s and leaves are removed and harvested celery are packed by size and quality (determined by color, shape, straightness and thickness of petiole, stalk and midrib length and absence of disease, cracks, splits, insect damage and rot). Under optimal conditions, celery can be stored for up to seven weeks between {{convert|0|to|2|C|F}}. Inner stalks may continue growing if kept at temperatures above {{convert|0|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Freshly cut petioles of celery are prone to decay, which can be prevented or reduced through the use of sharp blades during processing, gentle handling, and proper sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://postharvest.ucdavis.edu/Produce/ProduceFacts/Veg/celery.shtml | title =  Celery: Recommendations for Maintaining Postharvest Quality | publisher = Post-harvest technology research and information center | accessdate = 2008-03-04 | last = Cantwell | first = M | coauthors = Suslow, T.  | date = 2002-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cut pieces of celery last only a few hours before they turn brown, and few American restaurants include it in green salads because it cannot be prepared far enough ahead of time. In the past, restaurants used to store it in a container of water with powdered vegetable preservative; however, the [[sulfites]] in the preservative caused allergic reactions in some people.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman D, Schwan K. How Does Aspirin Find a Headache?  HarperCollins 2005, ISBN 0060740949, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1986, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned the use of sulfites on fruits and vegetables intended to be eaten raw.&lt;ref&gt;Fortin ND.

'''Celestines''' are a [[Roman Catholic]] [[monasticism|monastic]] [[Order (religious)|order]], a branch of the [[Benedictine]]s, founded in 1244.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Between Church and State: The Lives of Four French Prelates in the Late Middle Ages|first1=Bernard|first2=Arthur |last2=Goldhammer|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year= 1991|isbn=0226310329}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the foundation of the new rule, they were called [[Hermit]]s of St Damiano, or Moronites (or Murronites), and did not assume the appellation of Celestines until after the election of their founder to the [[Papacy]] as [[Pope Celestine V|Celestine V]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16019a.htm|title=Celestine Order}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fame of the holy life and the austerities practised by the hermit in his solitude on the Mountain of Majella, near [[Sulmona]], attracted many visitors, several of whom were moved to remain and share his mode of life. They built a small [[convent]] on the spot inhabited by the holy hermit, which became too small for the accommodation of those who came to share their life of privations. Peter of Morone, their founder built a number of other small [[Oratory (worship)|oratories]] in that neighborhood.

==Founding==
This happened about the year 1254. A new religious community was formed, and Peter of Morone gave them a rule formulated in accordance with his own practices. In 1264 the new institution was approved by [[Pope Urban IV|Urban IV]]. The founder, having heard that it was probable that [[Pope Gregory X]], then holding a council at [[Lyon]], would suppress all such new orders as had been founded since the [[Lateran Council]], having commanded that such institutions should not be further multiplied, went to Lyon. There he  succeeded in persuading Gregory to approve his new order, making it a branch of the Benedictines and following the [[Rule of St Benedict|rule of Saint Benedict]], but adding to it additional severities and privations. Gregory took it under the Papal protection, assured to it the possession of all property it might acquire, and endowed it with exemption from the authority of the ordinary. Nothing more was needed to ensure the rapid spread of the new association and Peter the hermit of Morone lived to see himself &quot;Superior-General&quot; to thirty-six [[monastery|monasteries]] and more than six hundred [[monk]]s. Peter, however, cannot be accused of ambition or the lust of power when a monastic superior, any more than when he insisted on divesting himself of the Papacy, to which he was subsequently raised. 

As soon as he had seen his new order thus consolidated he gave up the government of it to a certain Robert, and retired once again to a still more remote solitude to give himself up more entirely to solitary penance and prayer. Shortly afterwards, in a chapter of the order held in 1293, the original monastery of Majella being judged to be too desolate and exposed to too rigorous a climate, it was decided that the monastery which had been founded in Sulmtona should be the headquarters of the order and the residence of the General-Superior, as it has continued to be to the present day. The next year Peter of Morrone, having been, despite his reluctance, elected Pope by the name of Celestine V, the order he had founded took the name of Celestines. The hermit Pope found time in the few short months of his Papacy to confirm the rule of the order, which he had himself composed, and to confer on the society a variety of special graces and privileges. In the only creation of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s promoted by him, among the twelve raised to the purple, there were two monks of his order. He found time also to visit personally the great Benedictine monastery on [[Monte Cassino]], where he succeeded in persuading the monks to accept his more rigorous rule. He sent fifty monks of his order to introduce it, who remained, however, for only a few months.

After the death of the founder the order was favoured and privileged by [[Pope Benedict XI|Benedict XI]], and rapidly spread through [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Flanders]], and [[France]], where they were received by [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]] in 1300. Subsequently the French Celestines, with the consent of the Italian superiors of the order, and of [[Pope Martin V]] in 1427, obtained the privilege of making new constitutions for themselves, which they did in the 17th century in a series of regulations accepted by the provincial chapter in 1667. At that time the French congregation of the order was composed of twenty-one monasteries, the head of which was that of [[Paris]], and was governed by a Provincial with the authority of General. [[Pope Paul V|Paul V]] was a notable benefactor of the order. But in consequence of later political changes and events the order has been dissolved.

==Description of order==
According to their special constitutions the Celestines were bound to say [[matins]] in the [[choir]] at two o'clock in the morning, and always to abstain from eating meat, save in illness. The distinct rules of their order with regard to [[fasting]] are numerous, but not more severe than those of similar congregations, though much more so than is required by the old Benedictine rule. In reading their minute directions for divers degrees of abstinence on various days, it is impossible to avoid being struck by the conviction that the great object of the framers of these rules was the general purpose of ensuring an [[asceticism|ascetic]] mode of life.

The Celestines wore a white [[wool]]len [[cassock]] bound with a [[linen]] band, and a [[leather]]n [[girdle]] of the same colour, with a [[scapular]] unattached to the body of the dress, and a black [[hood (headgear)|hood]]. It was not permitted to them to wear any shirt save of [[serge]]. Their dress in short was very like that of the [[Cistercians]]. But it is a tradition in the order that in the time of the founder they wore a coarse brown cloth. The church and monastery of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] originally belonged to the Celestines in [[Rome]]; but they were turned out of it by [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]] to make way for [[Franciscan]]s, receiving from the Pope in exchange the Church of [[St Eusebius of Vercelli]] with the adjacent mansion for a monastery.

The '''Cessna Aircraft Company''' is an airplane manufacturing corporation headquartered in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]], [[USA]]. Their main products are [[general aviation]] [[aircraft]]. Although they are the most well-known for their small, piston-powered aircraft, they also produce business jets. The company is a subsidiary of the U.S. conglomerate [[Textron]].

==History==
The company traces its history to June 1911, when [[Clyde Cessna]], a farmer in Rago, [[Kansas]], built a wood-and-fabric plane and became the first person to build and fly an aircraft between the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Cessna started his aircraft ventures in [[Enid, Oklahoma]], testing many of his early planes on the salt flats. When bankers in Enid refused to lend him more money to build his planes, he moved to [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enidnews.com/localnews/local_story_025012803.html Article in &quot;Enid News&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cessna Aircraft was formed in 1927 when Clyde Cessna and Victor Roos became partners in the Cessna-Roos Aircraft Company. In the same year, the [[Secretary of State]] approved a name change to Cessna Aircraft Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1927-1939.html History of Cessna 1927]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cessna DC-6]] earned certification on [[October 29]], 1929, sharing this day in history with the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1927-1939.html History of Cessna from 1929]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cessna Aircraft Company closed its doors from 1932 until 1934 due to the state of the economy. In 1934, [[Dwane Wallace]], with the help of his brother Dwight, took control of the company and began the process of building it into what would become a global success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips&quot;&gt;Phillips, Edward H: ''Wings of Cessna, Model 120 to the Citation III'', Flying Books, 1986. ISBN 0-911139-05-2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, [[Cessna CR-3]] custom racer took its first flight. The plane won the 1933 American Air Race in Chicago and later set a new world speed record for engines smaller than 500 cubic inches by averaging {{convert|237|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1927-1939.html History of Cessna 1933]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, the [[Cessna C-37]] was introduced as Cessna's first seaplane when equipped with Edo floats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1927-1939.html History of Cessna 1937]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1940, the U.S. Army gave Cessna their largest order to date, when they ordered 33 specially equipped [[Cessna T-50]]s. Later this same year, the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] placed an additional order for 180 T-50s. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1940-1949.html History of Cessna 1940]&lt;/ref&gt; 1946 saw Cessna return to commercial production with the release of the [[Cessna 120|Model 120]] and [[Cessna 140|Model 140]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1940-1949.html History of Cessna 1946]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 the [[Cessna 140|Model 140]] was named by the US Flight Instructors Association, as the &quot;Outstanding Plane of the Year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1940-1949.html History of Cessna 1948]&lt;/ref&gt;

1955 saw Cessna's first helicopter, the [[Cessna CH-1]], receive [[FAA]] [[Type certificate |type certification]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1950-1959.html History of Cessna 1955]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Cessna released the [[Cessna 172]] which went on to become the most produced airplane in history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1950-1959.html History of Cessna 1956]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Cessna affiliated itself with [[Reims Aviation]] of [[Reims, France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1960-1969.html History of Cessna 1960]&lt;/ref&gt; 1963 saw Cessna produce its 50,000 airplane, a Cessna 172.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1960-1969.html history of Cessna 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; Cessna's first business jet, the [[Cessna Citation I]] performed its maiden flight on September 15, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1960-1969.html History of Cessna 1969]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Cessna produced its 100,000 single engine airplane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1970-1979.html History of Cessna 1975]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Cessna became a wholly owned subsidiary of [[General Dynamics|General Dynamic Corporation]]. Production of the [[Cessna Caravan]] began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1980-1989.html History of Cessna 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, General Dynamics announced the sale of Cessna to [[Textron Inc]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cessna.com/CessnaHistory/His/History-1990-1999.html History of Cessna 1992]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 2007, Textron announced that Cessna had purchased the bankrupt [[Columbia Aircraft]] company for [[United States dollar|US$]]26.4M and would continue production of the Columbia 350 and 400 as the [[Cessna 350]] and [[Cessna 400]] at the Columbia factory in [[Bend, Oregon|Bend]], [[Oregon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Textron&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://investor.textron.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=110047&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1081833&amp;highlight=|title = Textron's Cessna Aircraft Company to Acquire Assets of Columbia Aircraft|accessdate = 2007-11-28|last = Textron|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = November}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Chinese production controversy===
On 27 November 2007 Cessna announced the new [[Cessna 162]] would be made in the [[People's Republic of China]] by [[Shenyang Aircraft Corporation]], which is a subsidiary of China Aviation Industry Corporation I (AVIC I), a Chinese [[Government-owned corporation|government-owned]] consortium of aircraft manufacturers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Textron2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://investor.textron.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=110047&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1081831&amp;highlight=|title = Cessna Chooses China's Shenyang Aircraft Corporation as Manufacturing Partner for Model 162 SkyCatcher|accessdate = 2007-11-28|last = Textron|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = November}}&lt;/ref&gt; By manufacturing the aircraft in China, Cessna reports it saved [[USD]]$71,000 in production costs ''per'' aircraft, or about 40% of the cost. A second reason cited for moving production to Shenyang Aircraft Corporation was Cessna had no plant capacity available in the USA at the time.&lt;ref name = &quot;wrtvdo&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|author = Russ Niles
|accessdate = 2007-11-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cessna received a high degree of negative feedback from 162 customers and potential customers regarding this decision. Complaints centered on the recent problems with Chinese production of other consumer products, China's human rights record, exporting of jobs, and China's less than friendly political relationship with the USA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aniello&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cessnaskycatcher.com/home/124.html |title = Making the case for building the SkyCatcher in China|accessdate = 2008-01-03|last = Aniello|first = Tom|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = December |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080106070032/http://www.cessnaskycatcher.com/home/124.html |archivedate = 2008-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The backlash surprised Cessna and resulted in a company public relations campaign to try to explain the decision from a business perspective and assure customers that quality of the aircraft will not be compromised.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grady02&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/RemosAircraft_Germany_Expanding_ChallengesCessna_196872-1.html|title = Germany's Remos Aircraft Expanding, Challenges Cessna|accessdate = 2008-01-03|last = Grady|first = Mary|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = January}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction to the explanations and assurances has been overwhelmingly negative, although a small number of customers have applauded the production in China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aniello&quot;/&gt;

In early 2009 the company attracted further criticism for continuing plans to build the 162 in China while laying off large numbers of workers in the USA.&lt;ref name=&quot;AvWeb02Feb09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/eletter/archives/avflash/1307-full.html|title = Cessna Layoffs Continue |accessdate = 2009-02-02|last = AvWeb Staff|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = January}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008-10 economic crisis===
The company's business suffered notably during the [[late-2000s recession]], laying off more than half its workforce between January 2009 and September 2010.

On 4 November 2008 Cessna's parent company, [[Textron]], indicated that [[Cessna Citation|Citation]] production would be reduced from the original 2009 target of 535 &quot;due to continued softening in the global economic environment&quot; and that this would result in an undetermined number of lay-offs at Cessna.&lt;ref name=&quot;AvWeb04Nov08&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebbiz/news/CessnaSlowsCitationProduction_CitingGlobalEconomy_199121-1.html|title = Cessna Slows Citation Production, Citing Global Economy |accessdate = 2008-11-06|last = Grady|first = Mary F.|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = November}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2008, at the [[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association|AOPA]] Expo, CEO [[Jack J. Pelton|Jack Pelton]] indicated that Cessna sales of aircraft to individual buyers had fallen but piston and turboprop sales to business had not. &quot;While the economic slowdown has created a difficult business environment, we are encouraged by brisk activity from new and existing propeller fleet operators placing almost 200 orders for 2009 production aircraft,&quot; Pelton stated.&lt;ref name=&quot;AvWeb08Nov08&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/news/aopa/AOPAExpo2008_CessnaAircraft_BuyersMarket_199162-1.html|title = It's a Buyer's Market|accessdate = 2008-11-08|last = Niles|first = Russ|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = November}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KWCH04Nov08&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.kwch.com/Global/story.asp?S=9292651&amp;nav=menu486_2_3|title = Cessna Announces Possible Layoffs|accessdate = 2008-11-04|last = Durden|first = Chris|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = November}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2008, Cessna announced that a total of 665 jobs would be cut at its [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] and [[Bend, Oregon]] plants starting in January 2009. The Cessna factory at [[Independence, Kansas]], which builds the Cessna piston-engined aircraft and the [[Cessna Mustang]], was not forecast to see any lay-offs, but one third of the workforce at the former [[Columbia Aircraft]] facility in Bend was laid off. This included 165 of the 460 employees who built the [[Cessna 350]] and [[Cessna 400|400]]. The remaining 500 jobs were eliminated at the main Cessna Wichita plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;AvWeb13Nov08&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/EclipseAviation_Misses_Payroll_TVreport_199202-1.html|title = Eclipse Misses Payroll: TV Report  |accessdate = 2008-11-13|last = Niles|first = Russ|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = November}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009 the company announced 2,000 additional layoffs, bringing the total to 4,600. The job cuts included 120 at the Bend, Oregon facility reducing the plant that built the Cessna 350 and 400 to fewer than half the number of workers that it had when Cessna bought it. Other cuts included 200 at the Independence, Kansas plant that builds the single-engined Cessnas and the Mustang, reducing that facility to 1,300 workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;AvWeb31Jan09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/cessna_layoff_wichita_textron_pelton_199682-1.html|title = Cessna Layoffs Continue |accessdate = 2009-02-02|last = Pew|first = Glenn|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = January}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 April 2009 the company announced that it was suspending the [[Cessna Citation Columbus|Citation Columbus]] program and closing the Bend, Oregon facility. The Columbus program was finally cancelled in early July 2009. The company said &quot;Upon additional analysis of the business jet market related to this product offering, we decided to formally cancel further development of the Citation Columbus&quot;. With the 350 and 400 production moving to Kansas, the company indicated that it would lay off 1,600 more workers, including the remaining 150 employees at the Bend plant and up to 700 workers from the Columbus program.&lt;ref name=&quot;AvWeb29Apr09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaWillSuspendColumbusProgramAndCloseBendFactory_200284-1.html|title = Cessna Will Suspend Columbus Program, Close Bend Factory|accessdate = 2009-04-30|last = Grady|first = Mary|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AvWeb14Jul09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaCancelsExtraLargeColumbusJetProgram_200720-1.html|title = Goodbye, Columbus -- Cessna Cancels Extra-Large Jet Program |accessdate = 2009-07-16|last = Grady|first = Mary|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = July}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early June 2009 Cessna announced that it would lay-off an additional 700 salaried employees, bringing the total number of lay-offs to 7600 or more than half the company's workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;AvWeb05Jun09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/cessna_layoff_wichita_columbus_mustang_200511-1.html|title = More Layoffs At Cessna|accessdate = 2009-06-08|last = Pew|first = Glenn|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = June}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009 the company announced that it will close its three [[Columbus, Georgia]] manufacturing facilities between June 2010 and December 2011. The closures will include the new {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility that was opened in August 2008 at a cost of US$25M, plus the McCauley Propeller plant. These closures will result in total job losses of 600 in Georgia. Some of the work will be relocated to Cessna's Independence, Kansas or Mexican facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;AvWeb11Dec09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/cessna_columbus_mccauley_jobs_cut_wichita_mexico_201673-1.html|title = Cessna Closing Plants, Cutting Jobs|accessdate = 2009-12-14|last = Pew|first = Glenn|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = Deecmber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cessna's parent company Textron posted a loss of US$8M in the first quarter of 2010, largely driven by continuing low sales at Cessna, which were down 44%. Cessna's workforce remained 50% laid-off and CEO Jack Pelton stated that he expected the recovery to be long and slow.&lt;ref name=&quot;AvWeb27Apr10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebbiz/news/CessnaDeclinesSapsTextron_202461-1.html|title = Cessna Declines Sap Textron Revenues|accessdate = 28 April 2010|last = Niles|first = Russ|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010 Cessna CEO Jack Pelton announced a further 700 lay-offs, bringing the total to 8,000 jobs lost. Pelton indicated this round of layoffs was due to a &quot;stalled [and] lackluster economy&quot; and noted that while the number of orders cancelled for jets has been decreasing new orders have not met expectations. Pelton added &quot;our strategy is to defend and protect our current markets while investing in products and services to secure our future, but we can do this only if we succeed in restructuring our processes and reducing our costs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AvWeb22Sep10&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaToCut700Jobs_203322-1.html|title = Cessna To Cut 700 Jobs|accessdate = 23 September 2010|last = Grady|first = Mary|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = September}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011===
On 2 May 2011 CEO [[Jack Pelton]] retired. The company will seek a new CEO with Textron CEO [[Scott C. Donnelly]] running Cessna until a replacement is found.&lt;ref name=&quot;AvWeb02May11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/PeltonRetiresFromCessna_204581-1.html|title = Pelton Retires From Cessna|accessdate = 3 May 2011|last = Grady|first = Mary|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = May| work = AvWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing Initiatives==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cessna 172]] --&gt;
Cessna has always had an active marketing department. This was especially notable during the 1950s and 1960s. During this period, the marketing department followed the lead of Detroit automobile manufacturers and came up with many marketing slogans and [[buzzwords]] to describe Cessna’s product line in an attempt to place their products ahead of the competition.

Other manufacturers and the aviation press widely ridiculed and spoofed many of these marketing terms but between Cessna’s designers producing a product the flying public wanted and the work of the marketing department, Cessna built and sold more aircraft than any other manufacturer during the boom years of the 1960s and 1970s.

[[Image:Cessna150BC-FOTK02.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cessna 150]]s produced before 1964, such as this 1962 Cessna 150B, lacked the later Omni-Vision rear window]]
[[Image:Cessna 150E (C-GFAU).jpg|thumb|right|A 1965 Cessna 150E. The 1964 model 150D and the 150E introduced Omni-Vision rear windows on the Model 150]]

===Marketing buzzwords===
Cessna marketing buzzwords included:
*'''Para-Lift Flaps''' – these were the large fowler [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] Cessna introduced on the [[Cessna 170|170]]B in 1952, replacing the narrow chord plain flaps then in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke&quot;&gt;Clarke, Bill: ''Cessna 150 and 152'' first edition, pages 5–17. TAB Books, 1987. ISBN 0-8306-9002-0&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Land-O-Matic''' – In 1956, Cessna introduced sprung-steel [[tricycle landing gear]] on the 172. The marketing department chose “Land-O-Matic” to imply that these aircraft were much easier to land and take off than the preceding [[conventional landing gear]] equipped Cessna 170. They even went as far as to say pilots could do “drive-up take-offs and drive-in landings”, implying that flying these aircraft was as easy as driving a car. In later years some Cessna models had their steel sprung landing gear replaced with steel tube gear legs. The [[Cessna 206|206]] retains the original spring steel landing gear today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke&quot; /&gt;
*'''Omni-Vision''' – This referred to the rear windows on some Cessna singles, starting with the [[Cessna 182|182]] and [[Cessna 210|210]] in 1962, the [[Cessna 172|172]] in 1963 and the [[Cessna 150|150]] in 1964. The term was intended to make the pilot feel visibility was improved on the notably poor-visibility Cessna line. The introduction of the rear window caused in most models a loss of cruise speed due to the extra drag, while not adding any useful visibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke&quot; /&gt;
*'''Cushioned power''' – This was to announce the introduction of rubber mounts on the cowling of the 1967 model 150, in addition to the rubber mounts isolating the engine from the cabin.
*'''Omni-Flash''' - This referred to the flashing beacon on the tip of the fin that could be seen all around.
*'''Open-View''' – This referred to the removal of the top section of the control wheel in 1967 models. These had been rectangular, they now became “ram’s horn” shaped, thus not blocking the instrument panel as much.
*'''Quick-Scan''' – Cessna introduced a new instrument panel layout in the 1960s and this buzzword was to indicate Cessna’s panels were ahead of the competition.
*'''Nav-O-Matic''' - This was the name of the Cessna autopilot system, which implied the system was relatively simple.
*'''Camber-Lift''' - This marketing name was used to describe Cessna aircraft wings starting in 1972 when the aerodynamics designers at Cessna added a slightly drooped [[leading edge]] to the standard [[NACA airfoil|NACA 2412]] [[airfoil]] used on most of the light aircraft fleet. Writer Joe Christy described the name as &quot;stupid&quot; and added &quot;Is there any other kind [of lift]?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ChristyJ&quot;&gt;Christy, Joe: ''The Complete Guide to the Single Engine Cessnas - Third Edition'', page 119. TAB Books, 1979. ISBN 0-8306-2268-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in Europe==
[[Image:Andrzej Milosz and Czeslaw Milosz.jpg|thumb|right|Czesław Miłosz ''(right)'' with brother Andrzej Miłosz at [[PEN Club]] World Congress, Warsaw, May 1999]]
Czesław Miłosz was born on June 30, 1911 in the village of Szetejnie ({{lang-lt|Šeteniai}}), [[Kovno Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Kėdainiai district municipality|Kėdainiai district]], [[Kaunas County]], [[Lithuania]]) on the border between two Lithuanian historical regions of [[Samogitia]] and [[Aukštaitija]] in central Lithuania. He was a son of Aleksander Miłosz (d.1959), a civil engineer, and Weronika, née Kunat (d.1945), descendant of the [[Lithuanian nobility|Siručiai noble family]]. Miłosz was fluent in Polish, Lithuanian, Russian, English and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Czeslaw Milosz, Poet and Nobelist Who Wrote of Modern Cruelties, Dies at 93| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E5DC123FF936A2575BC0A9629C8B63| accessdate=March 17, 2008 | work=The New York Times | first=Raymond H. | last=Anderson | date=August 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, [[Andrzej Miłosz]] (1917–2002), a Polish journalist, translator of literature and of film subtitles into Polish, was a documentary-film producer who created Polish documentaries about his brother. 

Miłosz was raised [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] in rural Lithuania and emphasized his identity with the multi-ethnic [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], a stance that led to ongoing controversies; he refused to categorically identify himself as either a Pole or a Lithuanian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/czeslawmilosz.htm

Miłosz memorialised his Lithuanian childhood in a 1955 novel, ''The Issa Valley'', and in the 1959 memoir ''Native Realm''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CZESLAW MILOSZ 1911-2004|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/08/15/MNGA988H5M1.DTL|accessdate=March 20, 2008 | first=Rona | last=Marech}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from [[Sigismund Augustus]] ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' in [[Vilnius]], he studied law at [[Vilnius University|Stefan Batory University]] and in 1931 he travelled to Paris, where he was influenced by his distant cousin [[Oscar Milosz]], a French poet of Lithuanian descent and a [[Swedenborgian]]. His first volume of poetry was published in 1934. After receiving his law degree that year, he again spent a year in Paris on a fellowship. Upon returning, he worked as a commentator at Radio Wilno, but was dismissed, an action described as stemming from either his leftist views or for views overly sympathetic to Lithuania.&lt;ref name=uc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[The Economist]]|url=http://www.economist.com/node/3104407|date=2004-08-14|title=Czeslaw Milosz, a Polish émigré poet, died on August 14th, aged 93|accessdate=2011-04-06|quote=In pre-war Poland Mr Milosz felt stifled by the prevailing Catholic-nationalist ethos; he was sacked from a Polish radio station for being too pro-Lithuanian.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miłosz wrote all his poetry, fiction and essays in Polish and translated the Old Testament ''[[Psalms]]'' into Polish.

Miłosz spent World War II in [[Warsaw]], under Nazi Germany's &quot;[[General Government]]&quot;. Here he attended [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground lectures]] by Polish philosopher and historian of philosophy and [[aesthetics]], [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]]. He did not participate in the [[Warsaw Uprising]] since he resided outside Warsaw proper. After World War II, Miłosz served as cultural attaché of the communist [[People's Republic of Poland]] in [[Paris]]. In 1951 he defected and obtained political asylum in France. In 1953 he received the Prix Littéraire Européen (European Literary Prize).

==Life in the United States==
[[File:Czeslaw Milosz 1998 by Kubik.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Czesław Miłosz 1998]]
In 1960 Miłosz emigrated to the United States, and in 1970 he became a U.S. citizen. In 1961 he began a professorship in Polish literature in the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. In 1978 he received the [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]]. He retired that same year, but continued teaching at Berkeley. Milosz' personal attitude about living in Berkeley is sensitively portrayed in his poem, &quot;A Magic Mountain,&quot; contained in a collection of translated poems entitled ''Bells in Winter'', published by Ecco Press (1985).  Having grown up in the cold climates of Eastern Europe, Milosz was especially struck by the lack of seasonal weather in Berkeley and by some of the brilliant refugees from around the world who became his friends at the university.

In 1980 Miłosz received the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. Since his works had been banned in Poland by the communist government, this was the first time that many Poles became aware of him.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} When the [[Iron Curtain]] fell, Miłosz was able to return to Poland, at first to visit and later to live part-time in [[Kraków]]. He divided his time between his home in Berkeley and an apartment in Kraków. In 1989, he received the U.S. [[National Medal of Arts]] and an honorary doctorate from [[Harvard University]]. During this period in Poland, his work was silenced by government-censored media. 

Miłosz's 1953 book ''[[The Captive Mind]]'' is a study about how intellectuals behave under a repressive regime, a work which he himself later translated into English. Miłosz observed that those who became [[dissident]]s were not necessarily those with the strongest minds, but rather those with the weakest stomachs; the mind can rationalize anything, he said, but the stomach can take only so much. Through the [[Cold War]], the book was often cited by US conservative commentators such as [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]].

==Death and legacy==
Miłosz died in 2004 at his Kraków home, aged 93. His first wife, Janina (née Dłuska), whom he had married in 1944, predeceased him in 1986.  They had two sons, Anthony (b. 1947) and John Peter (b.1951 ). His second wife, Carol Thigpen, an American-born historian, died in 2002. Miłosz's body was entombed at [[Kraków]]'s historic [[Skałka|Skałka Roman Catholic Church]], one of the last to be commemorated there.

Miłosz is honoured at Israel's [[Yad Vashem]] memorial to the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], as one of the &quot;[[Righteous among the Nations]]&quot;. A poem by Miłosz appears on a [[Gdańsk]] memorial to protesting shipyard workers who had been killed by government security forces in 1970. His books and poems have been translated by many hands, including [[Jane Zielonko]], [[Peter Dale Scott]], [[Robert Pinsky]] and [[Robert Hass]].

[[File:Male Lion and Cub Chitwa South Africa Luca Galuzzi 2004.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Lion]]s are voracious carnivores; they require up to seven kilograms (15 lbs) of [[meat]] per day. A major component of their diet is the flesh of large [[mammal]]s, like this [[African buffalo]].]]
A '''carnivore''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|ɑr|n|ɪ|v|ɔər}}), meaning 'meat eater' ([[Latin]] ''carne'' meaning 'flesh' and ''vorare'' meaning 'to devour'), is an [[organism]] that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] consisting mainly or exclusively of [[animal]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], whether through [[predation]] or [[scavenger|scavenging]].&lt;ref&gt;Nutrient Requirements: Carnivores. Duane E. Ullrey. Encyclopedia of Animal Science.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;&gt;Mammals: Carnivores. Duane E. Ullrey. Encyclopedia of Animal Science.&lt;/ref&gt; Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are considered [[wikt:obligate|obligate]] carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are considered [[wikt:facultative|facultative]] carnivores.&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;/&gt; [[Omnivore]]s also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore, or an omnivore from a facultative herbivore, for that matter.&lt;ref&gt;Mammals: Omnivores. Duane E. Ullrey. Encyclopedia of Animal Science.&lt;/ref&gt; A carnivore that sits at the top of the [[foodchain]] is an [[apex predator]].

Plants that capture and digest insects are called [[carnivorous plants]]. Similarly, [[fungi]] that capture microscopic animals are often called [[carnivorous fungi]].

==Classification==
[[File:VFT ne1.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Venus flytrap]], a well known [[carnivorous plant]]]]
Carnivores that eat [[insect]]s and similar invertebrates primarily or exclusively are called [[insectivore]]s, while those that eat [[fish]] primarily or exclusively are called [[piscivore]]s. Large [[piscivore]] amphibians were the first vertebrates to conquer land, they evolved 400 million years ago. Insectivores evolved next and predators of other vertebrates after that.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. &amp; Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word &quot;carnivore&quot; sometimes refers to the [[mammal]]ian Order [[Carnivora]], but this is somewhat misleading.  Although many Carnivora fit the definition of being exclusively meat eaters, not all do. For example, most species of [[bear]]s are [[omnivore|omnivorous]], except for the [[giant panda]], which is almost exclusively herbivorous, and the carnivorous [[polar bear]]. In addition, many carnivorous species are not members of Carnivora.

Outside the animal kingdom, there are several genera containing [[carnivorous plant]]s and several phyla containing [[carnivorous fungus|carnivorous fungi]]. The former are predominantly insectivores, while the latter prey mostly on microscopic [[invertebrate]]s, such as [[nematode]]s, [[amoeba]] and [[springtail]]s.

===Obligate carnivores===
[[File:Tigre d'Asie à robe blanche.jpg|thumb|right|This white [[Bengal tiger]]'s sharp [[teeth]] and strong jaws are the classical physical traits expected from carnivorous mammalian [[predator]]s]]
Obligate or true carnivores depend solely on the nutrients found in animal flesh for their survival. While they may consume small amounts of plant material, they lack the [[physiology]] required for the efficient [[digestion]] of vegetable matter and, in fact, some carnivorous mammals eat vegetation specifically as an [[emetic]]. The [[domestic cat]] is a prime example of an obligate carnivore, as are all of the other [[Felidae|felids]]. The ability to produce synthetic forms of nutrients such as [[taurine]] in the lab has allowed feed manufacturers to formulate foods for carnivores (zoo animals and pets) with varying amounts of plant material.

The diet of a [[hypercarnivore]] consists of more than 70% meat, that of a [[mesocarnivore]] 50-70%, and that of a [[hypocarnivore]] less than 30%, with the balance consisting of non-animal foods, which may include [[fungi]], [[fruit]]s, and other plant material.

== Characteristics of carnivores ==
Characteristics commonly associated with carnivores include organs for capturing and disarticulating prey (teeth and claws serve these functions in many vertebrates) and status as a [[predator]]. In truth, these assumptions may be misleading, as some carnivores do not hunt and are [[scavengers]] (though most hunting carnivores will scavenge when the opportunity exists). Thus they do not have the characteristics associated with hunting carnivores. Carnivores have comparatively short digestive systems, as they are not required to break down tough cellulose found in plants.
Carnivores will also generally possess eyes that face forward, affording binocular vision and depth perception necessary to pounce on prey, as contrasted to the usual herbivore arrangement of eyes set on opposite sides of the head, sacrificing binocular vision for a nearly 360 degree field of vision as a defense against predators.

==Prehistoric carnivores==
The first vertebrate carnivores were fish, and then amphibians that lived moved on to land. Early [[tetrapods]] were large amphibious [[piscivores]]. While amphibians continued to feed
on fish and later insects, reptiles began exploring two new food types, tetrapods (carnivory), and
later, plants (herbivory). Carnivory was a natural transition from insectivory for medium and large tetrapods, requiring minimal adaptation (in contrast, a complex set of adaptations was necessary for feeding on highly fibrous plant materials).&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. &amp; Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prehistoric mammals of the crown-clade [[Carnivoramorpha]] (Carnivora and [[Miacoidea]] without [[Creodonta]]), along with the early order Creodonta, and some mammals of the even earlier order [[Cimolesta]], were true carnivores. The earliest carnivorous mammal is considered{{By whom|date=April 2011}} to be the ''[[Cimolestes]]'' that existed during the Late Cretaceous and [[Tertiary]] [[Period (geology)|Period]]s in North America about 65 million years ago.
