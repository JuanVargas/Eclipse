===Components of a television system===
A typical analog television receiver is based around the block diagram shown below:

[[Image:TV-block-diagram.svg|alt=block diagram of a television receiver showing tuner, intermediate frequency amplifier. A demodulator separates sound from video. Video is directed to the CRT and to the synchronizing circuits.]]

===Sync Separator===
[[Image:Videosignal porch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Portion of a [[PAL]] videosignal. From left to right: end of a video line, [[front porch]], horizontal sync pulse, [[back porch]] with [[color burst]], and beginning of next line]] 	
[[Image:Videosignal vsync.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Beginning of the frame, showing several scan lines; the terminal part of the vertical sync pulse is at the left]] 	
[[Image:Videosignal frame.jpg|right|250px|thumb|PAL videosignal frames. Left to right: frame with scan lines (overlapping together, horizontal sync pulses show as the doubled straight horizontal lines), vertical blanking interval with vertical sync (shows as brightness increase of the bottom part of the signal in almost the leftmost part of the vertical blanking interval), entire frame, another VBI with VSYNC, beginning of third frame]]	
Image synchronization is achieved by transmitting negative-going pulses; in a composite video signal of 1 volt amplitude, these are approximately 0.3&amp;nbsp;V below the [[Black level|&quot;black level&quot;]]. The ''horizontal sync'' signal is a single short pulse which indicates the start of every line. Two timing intervals are defined - the ''front porch'' between the end of displayed video and the start of the sync pulse, and the ''back porch'' after the sync pulse and before displayed video. These and the sync pulse itself are called the ''horizontal blanking'' (or ''retrace'') ''interval'' and represent the time that the electron beam in the CRT is returning to the start of the next display line.	
The ''vertical sync'' signal is a series of much longer pulses, indicating the start of a new field. The sync pulses occupy the whole of line interval of a number of lines at the beginning and end of a scan; no picture information is transmitted during vertical retrace. The pulse sequence is designed to allow horizontal sync to continue during vertical retrace; it also indicates whether each field represents even or odd lines in interlaced systems (depending on whether it begins at the start of a horizontal line, or mid-way through).	
In the TV receiver, a ''sync separator'' circuit detects the sync voltage levels and sorts the pulses into horizontal and vertical sync.	
Loss of horizontal synchronization usually resulted in an unwatchable picture; loss of vertical synchronization would produce an image rolling up or down the screen.

=== Timebase circuits===
{{see|Oscilloscope}}
In an analog receiver with a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] display sync pulses are fed to horizontal and vertical ''timebase'' amplifier circuits. These generate modified [[sawtooth]] and [[parabola]] current waveforms to scan the electron beam in a [[linear]] way. The waveform shapes are necessary to make up for the distance variations from the electron beam source and the screen surface. Each beam direction switching circuit is reset by the appropriate sync timing pulse. These waveforms are fed to the horizontal and vertical ''scan coils'' wrapped around the CRT tube. These coils produce a [[magnetic field]] proportional to the changing current, and this deflects the electron beam across the screen. In the 1950s, television receiver timebase supply was derived directly from the mains supply. A simple circuit consisted of a [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] voltage dropper [[resistance]] and a [[rectifier]] [[valve]] ([[tube]]) or [[semiconductor]] [[diode]]. This avoided the cost of a large high voltage mains supply (50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) [[transformer]]. This type of circuit was used for [[thermionic valve]] ([[tube]]) technology. It was inefficient and produced a lot of heat which led to premature failures in the circuitry. In the 1960s, [[semiconductor]] technology was introdued into timebase circuits. During the late 1960s in the [[U.K.]], [[synchronous]], (with the scan line rate), power generation was introduced into [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] receiver designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldtellys.co.uk/otpsupps.html|title=TACKLING THE POWER SUPPLY|work=Publication date - unknown|publisher=Old Tellys.co.uk|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These had very complex circuits in which faults were difficult to trace, but had very efficient use of power. In the early 1970s [[Alternating current|AC]] mains (50&amp;nbsp;Hz), and line timebase (15,625&amp;nbsp;Hz), [[thyristor]] based switching circuits were introduced. In the U.K. use of the simple (50&amp;nbsp;Hz) types of power circuits were discontinued. The reason for design changes arose from the electricity supply contamination problems arising from [[EMI]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkemc.co.uk/conferences/emcYork2003/potm/2004-01_SMPS-and-SELC.pdf|title=AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE EMC EMISSIONS FROM SWITCHED MODE POWER SUPPLIES AND SIMILAR SWITCHED ELECTRONIC LOAD CONTOLLERS OPERATING AT VARIOUS LOADING CONDITIONS - Page 2,line 3 |work=Publication date - January 2001|publisher=York EMC.co.uk|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supply loading issues due to energy being taken from only the positive half cycle of the mains supply waveform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkemc.co.uk/conferences/emcYork2003/potm/2004-01_SMPS-and-SELC.pdf|title=REVIEW OF PRIMARY FREQUENCY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS ON THE GB POWER SYSTEM AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF INCREASe IN RENEWABLE GENERATION - Impact of railway electrification systems on other electrical systems and civil infrastructures within and outside the railway environment.-section 3.2,page 15 |work=October 2006|publisher=Bura.Brunel.ac.uk|accessdate=24thf November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CRT flyback power supply design and operation principles===
{{see|Extra high tension}}

Most of the receiver's circuitry (at least in [[transistor]]- or [[integrated circuit|IC]]-based designs) operates from a comparatively low-voltage [[direct-current|DC]] power supply. However, the [[anode]] connection for a [[cathode-ray tube]] requires a very high voltage (typically 10-30&amp;nbsp;kV) for correct operation.

This voltage is not directly produced by the main [[power supply]] circuitry; instead the receiver makes use of the circuitry used for horizontal scanning. [[Direct current]] (DC), is switched though the line output transformer, and [[alternating current]] ([AC]) is induced into the scan coils. At the end of each horizontal scan line the [[magnetic field]] which has built up in both transformer and scan coils by the current, is a source of latent electromagnetic energy. This stored collapsing magnetic field energy can be captured. The reverse flow, short duration, (about 10% of the line scan time) current from both the line output transformer and the horizontal scan coil is discharged again into the [[transformer|primary winding]] of the [[flyback transformer]] by the use of a rectifier which blocks this negative reverse [[electromotive force|emf]]. A small value [[capacitor]] is connected across the scan switching device. This tunes the circuit [[inductance]]s to [[resonate]] at a much higher [[frequency]]. This slows down (lengthens) the flyback time from the extremely rapid decay rate that would result if they were electrically isolated during this short period. One of the secondary windings on the flyback transformer then feeds this brief high voltage pulse to a [[Cockcroft]] design [[voltage multiplier]]. This produces the required [[extra high tension|EHT]] supply. A [[flyback converter]] is a power supply circuit operating on similar principles.

Typical modern design incorporates the flyback transformer and rectifier circuitry into a single unit with a captive output lead, (known as a diode split line output transformer),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miniwatt.info/mullard_tn77.pdf|title=Technical note 77 - Diode Split for E.H.T. generation|work=Publication date - 1976|publisher=Mullard|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that all high-voltage parts are enclosed. Earlier designs used a separate line output transformer and a well insulated high voltage multiplier unit. The high frequency (15&amp;nbsp;kHz or so) of the horizontal scanning allows reasonably small components to be used.

{{Refimprove|date=April 2010}}

An '''adhesive''', or '''glue''', is a [[mixture]] in a [[liquid]] or semi-liquid state that [[adhesion|adheres]] or bonds items together. Adhesives may come from either natural or [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] sources. The types of materials that can be bonded are vast but they are especially useful for bonding thin materials. Adhesives [[Curing (chemistry)|cure]] (harden) by either evaporating a solvent or by chemical reactions that occur between two or more constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Todd|Allen|Alting|1994|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lau|Wong|Lee|Lee|2002|p=1.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adhesives are advantageous for joining thin or dissimilar materials, minimizing weight, and when a vibration dampening joint is needed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sintef.no/content/page1____5411.aspx accessed (06-28-2010)&lt;/ref&gt; A disadvantage to adhesives is that they do not form an instantaneous joint, unlike most other joining processes, because the adhesive needs time to cure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gluguru.com/About%20Bonding.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known date for a simple glue is 200,000 BC&lt;ref name=&quot;Mazza&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2006.01.006 |title=A new Palaeolithic discovery: tar-hafted stone tools in a European Mid-Pleistocene bone-bearing bed |year=2006 |author=Mazza, P |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |volume=33 |pages=1310 |last2=Martini |first2=F |last3=Sala |first3=B |last4=Magi |first4=M |last5=Colombini |first5=M |last6=Giachi |first6=G |last7=Landucci |first7=F |last8=Lemorini |first8=C |last9=Modugno |first9=F}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for a compound glue 70,000 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadley&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19433786 |year=2009 |month=Jun |author=Wadley, L; Hodgskiss, T; Grant, M |title=From the Cover: Implications for complex cognition from the hafting of tools with compound adhesives in the Middle Stone Age, South Africa. |volume=106 |issue=24 |pages=9590–4 |issn=0027-8424 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0900957106 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |pmc=2700998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The oldest known adhesive, dated to approximately 200,000 BC, is from spear stone flakes glued to a wood with birch-bark-tar, which was found in central Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mazza&quot;/&gt;  The use of compound glues to haft stone spears into wood dates back to round 70,000 BC. Evidence for this has been found in [[Sibudu Cave]], South Africa and the compound glues used were made from plant gum and red [[ochre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadley&quot;/&gt; The [[Ötzi the Iceman|Tyrolean Iceman]] had weapons fixed together with the aid of birch-bark-tar glue.&lt;ref&gt;Sauter F, Jordis U, Graf A, Werther W, Varmuzahttp K. (2000). [http://www.arkat-usa.org/get-file.php?fileid=19868 Studies in organic archaeometry I: identification of the prehistoric adhesive used by the “Tyrolean Iceman” tofix his weapons]. ARKIVOC, 1:[5] 735-747&lt;/ref&gt; 

6000-year-old ceramics show evidence of adhesives based upon [[animal glue]]s made by [[rendering (food processing)|rendering]] animal products such as horse teeth.  During the times of [[Babylon]]ia, tar-like glue was used for gluing statues. The [[Egyptians]] made much use of [[animal glue]]s to adhere furniture, [[ivory]], and [[papyrus]]. The [[Mongols]] also used adhesives to make their short bows, and the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the eastern United States used a mixture of [[spruce]] gum and fat as adhesives to fashion waterproof seams in their [[birch bark|birchbark]] [[canoe]]s.

In [[middle Ages|medieval]] Europe, egg whites were used as glue to decorate [[parchment]]s with [[Metal leaf|gold leaf]]. The first actual glue factory was founded in Holland in the early 18th century. In the 1750s, the English introduced fish glue. As the modern world evolved, several other patented materials, such as bones, starch, fish skins and [[isinglass]], and [[casein]], were introduced as alternative materials for glue manufacture. Modern glues have improved flexibility, toughness, curing rate, and chemical resistance.

In the late 19th century in Switzerland, [[casein]] was first used as a [[wood glue]].  Today, it is seen to be used to glue [[grocery bag]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot;&gt;[http://www.ccmr.cornell.edu/education/ask/index.html?quid=160 CCMR - Ask A Scientist!]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{Seealso|List of glues}}

Adhesives are typically organized by the method of adhesion. These are then organized into reactive and non-reactive adhesives, which refers to if the adhesive [[chemical reaction|chemically reacts]] to harden. Alternatively they can be organized by whether the raw stock is of natural, or synthetic origin, or by their starting [[phase (matter)|physical phase]].

===Non-reactive adhesives===
====Drying adhesives====
There are two types of adhesives that harden by drying: ''solvent based adhesives'' and ''polymer dispersion adhesives'', also known as ''emulsion adhesives''.

Solvent based adhesives are a mixture of ingredients (typically [[polymer]]s) dissolved in a [[solvent]]. White glue, contact adhesives and [[rubber cement]]s are members of the ''drying adhesive'' family. As the solvent evaporates, the adhesive hardens. Depending on the chemical composition of the adhesive, they will adhere to different materials to greater or lesser degrees. 

Polymer dispersion adhesives are milky-white dispersions often based on [[polyvinyl acetate]] (PVAc). Used extensively in the woodworking and packaging industries. Also used with fabrics and fabric-based components, and in engineered products such as loudspeaker cones.

====Pressure sensitive adhesives====
{{sync|Pressure sensitive adhesive}}
{{Main|Pressure sensitive adhesive}}

''Pressure sensitive adhesives'' (PSA) form a bond by the application of light pressure to marry the adhesive with the adherend.  They are designed with a balance between flow and resistance to flow.  The bond forms because the adhesive is soft enough to flow (i.e. &quot;wet&quot;) the adherend.  The bond has strength because the adhesive is hard enough to resist flow when stress is applied to the bond.  Once the adhesive and the adherend are in close proximity, molecular interactions, such as [[van der Waals force]]s, become involved in the bond, contributing significantly to its ultimate strength.

PSAs are designed for either permanent or removable applications.  Examples of permanent applications include safety labels for power equipment, foil tape for HVAC duct work, automotive interior trim assembly, and sound/vibration damping films. Some high performance permanent PSAs exhibit high adhesion values and can support kilograms of weight per square centimeter of contact area, even at elevated temperature.  Permanent PSAs may be initially removable (for example to recover mislabeled goods) and build adhesion to a permanent bond after several hours or days.

Removable adhesives are designed to form a temporary bond, and ideally can be removed after months or years without leaving residue on the adherend.  Removable adhesives are used in applications such as surface protection films, masking tapes, bookmark and note papers, price marking labels, promotional graphics materials, and for skin contact (wound care dressings, EKG electrodes, athletic tape, analgesic and transdermal drug patches, etc.).  Some removable adhesives are designed to repeatedly stick and unstick. They have low adhesion and generally can not support much weight.  

Pressure sensitive adhesives are manufactured with either a liquid carrier or in 100% solid form.  Articles are made from liquid PSAs by coating the adhesive and drying off the solvent or water carrier.  They may be further heated to initiate a [[cross-link]]ing reaction and increase [[molecular mass|molecular weight]].  100% solid PSAs may be low viscosity polymers that are coated and then reacted with radiation to increase molecular weight and form the adhesive; or they may be high viscosity materials that are heated to reduce viscosity enough to allow coating, and then cooled to their final form. Major raw material for PSA's are [[acrylate]] based polymers.

====Contact adhesives====
''Contact adhesives'' are used in strong bonds with high shear-resistance like [[laminate]]s, such as bonding [[Formica (plastic)|Formica]] to a wooden counter, and in [[footwear]], as in attaching outsoles to uppers.

[[Natural rubber]] and [[polychloroprene]] (Neoprene) are commonly used contact adhesives.  Both of these elastomers undergo [[strain crystallization]]. 

Contact adhesives must be applied to both surfaces and allowed some time to dry before the two surfaces are pushed together. Some contact adhesives require as long as 24 hours to dry before the surfaces are to be held together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thistothat.com/glue/contact.shtml Information about contact adhesive]&lt;/ref&gt; Once the surfaces are pushed together, the bond forms very quickly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://composite.about.com/library/glossary/c/bldef-c1257.htm Definition of ''contact adhesive'' on About.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually not necessary to apply pressure for a long time, so there is less need for [[Clamp (tool)|clamps]].

====Hot adhesives====
[[Image:MVC-013F.jpg|right|thumbnail|200px|A glue gun, an example of a hot adhesive]]
{{Main|Hot melt adhesive}}

''Hot adhesives'', also known as ''hot melt adhesives'', are simply [[thermoplastic]]s applied in molten form (in the 65-180 C range) which solidify on cooling to form strong bonds between a wide range of materials. [[Ethylene-vinyl acetate]] based hot-melts are particularly popular for crafts because of their ease of use and the wide range of common materials they can join. A glue gun (shown at right) is one method of applying hot adhesives. The glue gun melts the solid adhesive then allows the liquid to pass through its barrel onto the material, where it solidifies.

Thermoplastic glue may have been invented around 1940 by [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] as a solution to water-based adhesives commonly used in packaging at that time failing in humid climates, causing packages to open and become damaged.

===Reactive adhesives===
====Multi-part adhesives====
''Multi-component adhesives'' harden by mixing two or more components which chemically react. This reaction causes polymers to cross-link into acrylics, urethanes, and epoxies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

There are several commercial combinations of multi - component adhesives in use in industry. Some of these combinations are:
* Polyester resin - polyurethane resin
* Polyols - polyurethane resin
* Acrylic polymers - polyurethane resins

The individual components of a multi-component adhesive are not adhesive by nature. The individual components react with each other after being mixed and show full adhesion only on curing. The multi-component resins can be either solvent-based or solvent-less. The solvents present in the adhesives are a medium for the polyester or the polyurethane resin. The solvent is dried during the curing process.

====One-part adhesives====
''One-part adhesives'' harden via a chemical reaction with an external energy source, such as [[radiation]], [[heat]], and [[moisture]].

''Ultraviolet'' (UV) ''light curing adhesives'', also known as ''light curing materials'' (LCM), have become popular within the manufacturing sector due to their rapid curing time and strong bond strength. Light curing adhesives can cure in as little as a second and many formulations can bond dissimilar substrates (materials) and withstand harsh temperatures. These qualities make UV curing adhesives essential to the manufacturing of items in many industrial markets such as electronics, telecommunications, medical, aerospace, glass, and optical. Unlike traditional adhesives, UV light curing adhesives not only bond materials together but they can also be used to seal and coat products.  They are generally acrylic based.

''Heat curing adhesives'' consist of a pre-made mixture of two or more components.  When heat is applied the components react and cross-link. This type of adhesive includes epoxies, urethanes, and [[polyimide]]s.

''Moisture curing adhesives'' cure when they react with moisture present on the substrate surface or in the air. This type of adhesive includes cyanoacrylates and urethanes.

===Natural adhesives===
''Natural adhesives'' are made from organic sources such as vegetable matter, [[starch]] ([[dextrin]]), natural resins or from animals e.g. casein or [[animal glue]]. They are often referred to as [[bioadhesives]]. One example is a simple paste made by cooking flour in water. Animal glues are traditionally used in bookbinding, wood joining, and many other areas but now are largely replaced by synthetic glues. Casein are mainly used in glass bottle labelling. Starch based adhesives are used in [[corrugated board]] production and [[paper bag|paper sack]] production, paper tube winding, wall paper adhesives. Another form of natural adhesive is blood [[albumen]] (made from protein component of blood), which is used in the [[plywood]] industry. [[Animal glue]] remains the preferred glue of the [[luthier]]. Casein based glues are made by [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitating]] casein from [[milk]] [[protein]] using the [[acetic acid]] from [[vinegar]]. This forms [[curd]]s, which are neutralized with a [[base (chemistry)|base]], such as [[sodium bicarbonate]] (baking soda), to cause them to unclump and become a thicker plastic-like substance.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot;/&gt;

===Synthetic adhesives===
''Synthetic adhesives'' are based on [[elastomer]]s, [[thermoplastics]], [[emulsion]]s, and [[Thermosetting plastic|thermosets]]. Examples of thermosetting adhesives are: [[epoxy]], [[polyurethane]], [[cyanoacrylate]] and [[Acrylic resin|acrylic]] polymers. See also [[post-it notes]].

==Application==
Applicators of different adhesives are designed according to the adhesive being used and the size of the area to which the adhesive will be applied. The adhesive is applied to either one or both of the materials being bonded.  The pieces are aligned and pressure is added to aid in adhesion and rid the bond of air bubbles.

Common ways of applying an adhesive include brushes, rollers, using films or pellets, spray guns and applicator guns (''e.g.'', [[caulk gun]]). All of these can be done manually or can be automated into a machine.

==Mechanisms of adhesion==
{{Main|Adhesion}}

Adhesion, the attachment between adhesive and substrate may occur either by mechanical means, in which the adhesive works its way into small pores of the substrate, or by one of several chemical mechanisms. The strength of adhesion depends on many factors, including the means by which it occurs.

In some cases, an actual [[chemical bond]] occurs between adhesive and substrate. In others, electrostatic forces, as in static electricity, hold the substances together. A third mechanism involves the van der Waals forces that develop between molecules. A fourth means involves the moisture-aided diffusion of the glue into the substrate, followed by hardening.

== Failure of the adhesive joint ==
[[Image:adhesive2.svg|thumbnail|550px|Failure of the adhesive joint can occur in different locations]]

There are several factors that could contribute to the failure of two adhered surfaces. Sunlight and heat may weaken the adhesive. Solvents can deteriorate or dissolve adhesive. Physical stresses may also cause the separation of surfaces. When subjected to loading, debonding may occur at different locations in the adhesive joint. The major fracture types are the following:

=== Cohesive fracture ===
''Cohesive fracture'' is obtained if a crack propagates in the bulk polymer which constitutes the adhesive. In this case the surfaces of both adherents after debonding will be covered by fractured adhesive. The crack may propagate in the centre of the layer or near an interface. For this last case, the cohesive fracture can be said to be “cohesive near the interface”. Most quality control standards consider a good adhesive bond to be cohesive.

=== Interfacial fracture ===
The fracture is ''adhesive'' or ''interfacial'' when debonding occurs between the adhesive and the adherent. In most cases, the occurrence of interfacial fracture for a given adhesive goes along with a smaller fracture toughness. The interfacial character of a fracture surface is usually to identify the precise location of the crack path in the interphase.

=== Other types of fracture ===
Other types of fracture include:

* The ''mixed'' type, which occurs if the crack propagates at some spots in a cohesive and in others in an interfacial manner. Mixed fracture surfaces can be characterised by a certain percentage of adhesive and cohesive areas.
* The ''alternating crack path'' type which occurs if the cracks jumps from one interface to the other. This type of fracture appears in the presence of tensile pre-stresses in the adhesive layer.
* Fracture can also occur in the adherent if the adhesive is tougher than the adherent. In this case the adhesive remains intact and is still bonded to one substrate and remnants of the other. For example, when one removes a price label, adhesive usually remains on the label and the surface. This is cohesive failure. If, however, a layer of paper remains stuck to the surface, the adhesive has not failed. Another example is when someone tries to pull apart [[Oreo]] cookies and all the filling remains on one side; this is an adhesive failure, rather than a cohesive failure.

== Design of adhesive joints ==
[[Image:fracture modes v2.svg|thumbnail|350px|Modes of failure]]

As a general design rule, the material properties of the object need to be greater than the forces anticipated during its use.  (i.e. geometry, loads, etc.). The engineering work will consist of having a good model to evaluate the function. For most adhesive joints, this can be achieved using [[fracture mechanics]]. Concepts such as the [[stress concentration]] factor and the [[strain energy release rate]] can be used to predict failure. In such models, the behavior of the adhesive layer itself is neglected and only the adherents are considered.

Failure will also very much depend on the opening ''mode'' of the joint.
* ''Mode I'' is an opening or tensile mode where the loadings are normal to the crack.
* ''Mode II'' is a sliding or in-plane shear mode where the crack surfaces slide over one another in direction perpendicular to the leading edge of the crack. This is typically the mode for which the adhesive exhibits the highest resistance to fracture.
* ''Mode III'' is a tearing or antiplane shear mode.

As the loads are usually fixed, an acceptable design will result from combination of a material selection procedure and geometry modifications, if possible. In adhesively bonded structures, the global geometry and loads are fixed by structural considerations and the design procedure focuses on the material properties of the adhesive and on local changes on the geometry.

Increasing the joint resistance is usually obtained by designing its geometry so that:
* The bonded zone is large
* It is mainly loaded in mode II
* Stable crack propagation will follow the appearance of a local failure.

== Testing the resistance of the adhesive ==
[[Image:tests.jpg|thumbnail|450px|Testing devices]]

A wide range of testing devices have been devised to evaluate the fracture resistance of bonded structures in pure mode I, pure mode II or in mixed mode. Most of these devices are beam type specimens. We will very shortly review the most popular:

* ''Double cantilever beam tests'' (DCB) measure the mode I fracture resistance of adhesives in a fracture mechanics framework. These tests consist in opening an assembly of two beams by applying a force at the ends of the two beams. The test is unstable (i.e. the crack propagates along the entire specimen once a critical load is attained) and a modified version of this test characterised by a non constant inertia was proposed called the ''tapered double cantilever beam'' (TDCB) specimen.
* ''Peel tests'' measure the fracture resistance of a thin layer bonded on a thick substrate or of two layers bonded together. They consist in measuring the force needed for tearing an adherent layer from a substrate or for tearing two adherent layers one from another. Whereas the structure is not symmetrical, various mode mixities can be introduced in these tests. This is one of the more common methods of evaluating paper strength in library and archival [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]]. 
* ''Wedge tests'' measure the mode I dominated fracture resistance of adhesives used to bond thin plates. These tests consist in inserting a wedge in between two bonded plates. A critical energy release rate can be derived from the crack length during testing. This test is a mode I test but some mode II component can be introduced by bonding plates of different thicknesses.
* ''Mixed-mode delaminating beam tests'' (MMDB) consist in a bonded bilayer with two starting cracks loaded on four points. The test presents roughly the same amount of mode I and mode II with a slight dependence on the ratio of the two layer thicknesses.
* ''End notch flexure tests'' consist in two bonded beams built-in on one side and loaded by a force on the other. As no normal opening is allowed, this device allows testing in essentially mode II condition.
* ''Crack lap shear tests'' (CLS) are application-oriented fracture resistance tests. They consist in two plates bonded on a limited length and loaded in tension on both ends. The test can be either symmetrical or dis-symmetrical. In the first case two cracks can be initiated and in the second only one crack can propagate.

As well as his Academy Award, Hopkins has also won three [[BAFTA Award]]s, two [[Emmy Award|Emmys]], a [[Golden Globe]] and a [[Cecil B. DeMille Award]].

Hopkins was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in 1993 for services to the arts.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot; /&gt; He received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2003, and was made a Fellow of the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;daily&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;baft&quot; /&gt;

==Early life==
Hopkins was born in [[Margam]], [[Port Talbot]], [[Wales]], the son of Muriel Anne (née Yeats) and Richard Arthur Hopkins, a baker.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;&gt;Stated in interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt; His schooldays were unproductive; he found that he would rather immerse himself in art, such as painting and drawing, or playing the piano, than attend to his studies. In 1949, to instill discipline, his parents insisted he attend [[West Monmouth School|Jones' West Monmouth Boys' School]] in [[Pontypool]], [[Wales]]. He remained there for five terms and was then educated at [[Cowbridge Grammar School]] in the [[Vale of Glamorgan]], [[Wales]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cowbridge&quot;&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1252033/Anthony-Hopkins.html Anthony Hopkins: My life in pictures] ''[[Daily Mail]]'' Retrieved 6 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins was influenced and encouraged to become an actor by Welsh compatriot [[Richard Burton]] (who was also born at [[Neath Port Talbot]]), whom he met briefly at the age of 15. To that end, he enrolled at the [[Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama]] in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]], from which he graduated in 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot; /&gt; After two years in the [[British Army]] doing his [[national service]], he moved to [[London]] where he trained at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RADA&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/1998/dec/05/features A dark and stormy knight] ''[[The Guardian]]'' Retrieved 6 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Roles===

Hopkins made his first professional stage appearance in the [[Palace Theatre, Swansea]] in 1960 with Swansea Little Theatre's production of ''Have A Cigarette''.

In 1965, after several years in repertory, he was spotted by [[Laurence Olivier|Sir Laurence Olivier]], who invited him to join the [[Royal National Theatre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot;&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/nationaltreasures/2193352/Sir-Anthony-Hopkins-portrait.html Sir Anthony Hopkins portrait] ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' Retrieved Thursday 6 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins became Olivier's [[understudy]], and filled in when Olivier was struck with [[appendicitis]] during a production of [[August Strindberg]]'s ''The Dance of Death''. Olivier later noted in his memoir, ''Confessions of an Actor'', that, &quot;A new young actor in the company of exceptional promise named Anthony Hopkins was understudying me and walked away with the part of Edgar like a cat with a mouse between its teeth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;falk&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Quentin | last=Falk | year=2004 | title=Anthony Hopkins: The Biography | edition=4th | publisher=Virgin Books | isbn=0-7535-0999-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his success at the National, Hopkins tired of repeating the same roles nightly and yearned to be in films. He made his small-screen debut in a 1967 [[BBC]] broadcast of ''[[A Flea in Her Ear]]''. In 1968, he got his break in ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' playing [[Richard I]], along with [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], and future [[James Bond]] star [[Timothy Dalton]], who played [[Philip II of France]].

Although Hopkins continued in theatre (most notably at the National Theatre as Lambert Le Roux in ''[[Pravda (play)|Pravda]]'' by [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]] and [[Howard Brenton]] and as Antony in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' opposite [[Judi Dench]] as well as in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'', directed by [[John Dexter]]) he gradually moved away from it to become more established as a television and film actor. His [[Pierre Bezukhov]] for the BBC [[War and Peace (TV series)|War and Peace]] (1972) was particularly memorable. He has since gone on to enjoy a long career, winning many plaudits and awards for his performances. Hopkins was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1987, and a [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/film/pages/actors-anthony-hopkins.shtml BBC - Wales - Arts - Top 10 Welsh actors: Anthony Hopkins] ''[[BBC]]'' Retrieved 2 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-02-23/news/9303184625_1_actor-anthony-hopkins-knighted-serial-killer Actor Anthony Hopkins Knighted By Queen Elizabeth] ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' (23 February 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Hopkins was awarded an honorary fellowship from the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HNRY&quot; /&gt; Hopkins received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;daily&quot;&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/happy-birthday-sir-anthony-hopkins/story-fn6ccwsa-1225978951467 Happy birthday Sir Anthony Hopkins] ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' (Sydney). Retrieved 5 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins has stated that his role as [[Burt Munro]], whom he portrayed in his 2005 film ''[[The World's Fastest Indian]]'', was his favourite. He also asserted that Munro was the easiest role that he had played because both men have a similar outlook on life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/films_movies_actors/the_worlds_fastest_indian.htm| publisher=Solarnavigator.net | title=''The World's Fastest Indian| accessdate=21 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Hopkins was the recipient of the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]] for lifetime achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4444884.stm Lifetime honour for Sir Anthony] ''[[BBC News]]'' (17 November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he received the [[BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;baft&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7191143.stm Bafta Film Awards 2008: The winners] ''[[BBC News]]'' (10 February 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting style===
[[File:I Rossellini A Hopkins.jpg|right|thumb|[[Isabella Rossellini]] and Anthony Hopkins in [[Berlin]] to shoot scenes for ''[[The Innocent (1993 film)|The Innocent]]'' (1993).]]

Hopkins is renowned for his preparation for roles. He has indicated in interviews that once he has committed to a project, he will go over his lines as many times as is needed (sometimes upwards of 200) until the lines sound natural to him, so that he can &quot;do it without thinking&quot;. This leads to an almost casual style of delivery that belies the amount of groundwork done beforehand. While it can allow for some careful improvisation, it has also brought him into conflict with the occasional director who departs from the script, or demands what the actor views as an excessive number of takes. Hopkins has stated that after he is finished with a scene, he simply discards the lines, not remembering them later on. This is unlike others who usually remember their lines from a film even years later.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anthony Hopkins: Lecter and Me&quot;&amp;nbsp;— ''Red Dragon'' DVD interview&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Attenborough]], who has directed Hopkins on five occasions, found himself going to great lengths during the filming of ''[[Shadowlands (film)|Shadowlands]]'' (1993) to accommodate the differing approaches of his two stars (Hopkins and [[Debra Winger]]), who shared many scenes. Whereas Hopkins, preferring the spontaneity of a fresh take, liked to keep rehearsals to a minimum, Winger rehearsed continuously. To allow for this, Attenborough stood in for Hopkins during Winger's rehearsals, only bringing him in for the last one before a take. The director praised Hopkins for &quot;this extraordinary ability to make you believe when you hear him that it is the very first time he has ever said that line. It's an incredible gift.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;falk&quot; /&gt;

Renowned for his ability to remember lines, Hopkins keeps his memory supple by learning things by heart such as poetry, and Shakespeare. In [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', Hopkins astounded the crew with his memorisation of a seven-page courtroom speech, delivering it in one go. An overawed Spielberg couldn't bring himself to call him Tony, and insisted on addressing him as Sir Anthony throughout the shoot.&lt;ref name=&quot;RADA&quot; /&gt;

In addition, Hopkins is a gifted [[Impressionist (entertainment)|mimic]], adept at turning his native Welsh accent into whatever is required by a character. He duplicated the voice of his late mentor, Laurence Olivier, for additional scenes in ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' in its 1991 restoration. His interview on the 1998 relaunch edition of the British TV talk show ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' featured an [[impersonation]] of comedian [[Tommy Cooper]]. Hopkins has said acting &quot;like a submarine&quot; has helped him to deliver credible performances in his thriller movies. He said, &quot;It's very difficult for an actor to avoid, you want to show a bit. But I think the less one shows the better.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8512396.stm |title=Sir Anthony Hopkins acts 'like a submarine' |publisher=BBC News |date=12 February 2010 |accessdate=7 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hannibal Lecter===
Perhaps Hopkins' most famous role is as the cannibalistic [[serial killer]] [[Hannibal Lecter]] in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', for which he won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] in 1991, opposite [[Jodie Foster]] as [[Clarice Starling]], who won for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The film won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. It is one of the shortest lead performances to win an Oscar, as Hopkins only appears on screen for little over 16 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;cowbridge&quot; /&gt; Hopkins reprised his role as Lecter twice in ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001) and ''[[Red Dragon (film)|Red Dragon]]'' (2002). His original portrayal of the character in ''The Silence of the Lambs'' has been labelled by the [[American Film Institute]] as the number-one film villain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/handv.aspx| publisher=AFI.com | title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains| accessdate=21 May 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070507035737/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/handv.aspx &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 7 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time he was offered the role, Hopkins was making a return to the London stage, performing in ''[[M. Butterfly]]''. He had come back to Britain after living for a number of years in Hollywood, having all but given up on a career there, saying, &quot;Well that part of my life's over; it's a chapter closed. I suppose I'll just have to settle for being a respectable actor poncing around the West End and doing respectable BBC work for the rest of my life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;falk&quot; /&gt;

Hopkins played the iconic villain in adaptations of the first three of the Lecter novels by [[Thomas Harris]]. The author was reportedly very pleased with Hopkins' portrayal of his antagonist. However, Hopkins stated that ''Red Dragon'' would feature his final performance as the character, and that he would not reprise even a narrative role in the latest addition to the series, ''[[Hannibal Rising (film)|Hannibal Rising]]''.

==Personal life==
[[File:AnthonyHopkins10TIFF.jpg|thumb|upright|Hopkins at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]].]]

As of 2007, Hopkins resides in [[Los Angeles]]. He had moved to the [[United States]] once before during the 1970s to pursue his film career, but returned to [[London]] in the late 1980s. However, he decided to return to the U.S. following his 1990s success. Retaining his British citizenship, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen on 12 April 2000, and celebrated with a 3,000-mile road trip across the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;HNRY&quot;&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/anthony-hopkins/pages/biography.shtml BBC - Wales - Arts - Anthony Hopkins biography] ''[[BBC]]'' Retrieved 2 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins has been married three times. His first two wives were Petronella Barker (1967–1972) and Jennifer Lynton (1973–2002). He is now married to [[Colombia]]n-born [[Stella Arroyave]]. He has a daughter from his first marriage, [[Abigail Hopkins (singer)|Abigail Hopkins]] (b. 20 August 1968), who is an actress and singer.

He has offered his support to various charities and appeals, notably becoming President of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust's]] [[Snowdonia]] Appeal, raising funds for the preservation of the [[Snowdonia National Park]] in [[North Wales]], and to aid the Trust's efforts to purchase parts of [[Snowdon]]. A book celebrating these efforts, ''Anthony Hopkins' Snowdonia,'' was published together with Graham Nobles. Hopkins has been a patron of the [[YMCA]] centre in his hometown of [[Port Talbot]], [[South Wales]] for more than 20 years, having first joined the YMCA in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-10683793 Drama returns to YMCA where Sir Anthony Hopkins started] ''[[BBC Wales]]'' (20 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins also takes time to support other various [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] groups. He was a Guest of Honour at a Gala Fundraiser for Women in Recovery, Inc., a [[Venice, California]]-based non-profit organization offering rehabilitation assistance to women in recovery from [[substance abuse]]. Although he resides in [[Malibu, California]] he is also a volunteer teacher at the Ruskin School of Acting in [[Santa Monica, California]].

Hopkins has attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Close |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/1998/dec/05/features |title=Unlimited: A dark and stormy knight |work= The Guardian |date= 5 December 1998|accessdate=17 October 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; since suddenly stopping drinking in 1975. As stated to [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] in October 2010, Hopkins is a [[vegetarian]]. In 2008, he embarked on a weight loss program, and by 2010, he had lost 80 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.motleyhealth.com/celeb/silence-of-the-lamb-chop-anthony-hopkins-loses-70-pounds |title=Silence of the Lamb Chops&amp;nbsp;– Anthony Hopkins Loses 80 Pounds |work= Motley Health |accessdate=11 November 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins is a prominent member of environmental protection group [[Greenpeace]] and as of early 2008 featured in a television advertisement campaign, voicing concerns about [[Japan]]'s continuing annual [[Whaling in Japan|whale hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/resources/videos/whales/sir-anthony-hopkins-speaks-out |title=Green Peace anti-whaling video |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date=17 March 2003 |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins has been a patron of [[RAPt]] (Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust) since its early days and helped open their first intensive drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit at [[Downview (HM Prison)]] in 1992.

He is an admirer of the comedian [[Tommy Cooper]]. On 23 February 2008, as patron of the Tommy Cooper Society, the actor unveiled a commemorative statue in the entertainer's home town of [[Caerphilly]], South Wales. For the ceremony, Hopkins donned Cooper's trademark [[fez (clothing)|fez]] and performed a comic routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7260219.stm |title=Tommy Cooper statue is unveiled |publisher=BBC News |date=23 February 2008 |accessdate=17 October 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first screenplay, an experimental drama called ''[[Slipstream (2007 film)|Slipstream]]'', which he also directed and scored, premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 2007.

Hopkins is a fan of the BBC sitcom ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', and once remarked in an interview how he would love to appear in the series. Writer [[John Sullivan (writer)|John Sullivan]] saw the interview, and with Hopkins in mind created the character [[List of Only Fools and Horses characters#The Driscoll Brothers|Danny Driscoll]], a local villain. However, filming of the new series coincided with the filming of ''The Silence of the Lambs'', making Hopkins unavailable. The role instead went to [[Roy Marsden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Clark, Steve | title=The Only Fools and Horses Story| publisher=BBC Books| year=1998| isbn=0-563-38445-X | page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ardal O'Hanlon''' (born 8 October 1965) is an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[comedian]] and [[actor]], best known for his roles in television [[situation comedy|sitcoms]] as [[Father Dougal McGuire]] in ''[[Father Ted]]'' and George Sunday in ''[[My Hero (TV series)|My Hero]]''.

==Biography==
===Early life===
O'Hanlon was born in 1965 in [[Carrickmacross]], [[Monaghan]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the son of [[Rory O'Hanlon]], an Irish politician and doctor, and has five siblings. RTÉ's ''Who do you think you are?'' programme on Monday 6 October 2008 examined Ardal's family tree. He discovered that his paternal grandfather, Michael O'Hanlon, a [[University College Dublin|UCD]] medicine student, had joined the [[Irish Republican Army]] during the [[Irish War of Independence]] and was a member of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]'s squad which assassinated British secret service agents on the morning of [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]]. Details of his grandfather's activities survive in [[University College Dublin|UCD]] Archives, as well as [[Blackrock College]]. It also transpired that on his mother's side he was a close relative of [[Peter Fenelon Collier]], the founder of ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' and ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]''.

O'Hanlon was schooled in [[Blackrock College]] in Dublin and graduated, in 1987, from the [[National Institute for Higher Education]], [[Dublin]] (now [[Dublin City University]]) with a degree in Communications Studies.

===Career===
Together with Kevin Gildea and Barry Murphy, Ardal O'Hanlon founded the International Comedy Cellar, upstairs in the International Bar on Dublin's South Wicklow Street. Dublin had no comedy scene at the time. As a stand up, O'Hanlon won the [[Hackney Empire New Act of the Year]] competition in 1994. For a time he was the presenter of ''The Stand Up Show''.

He was spotted by [[Graham Linehan]], who was to cast him as Father Dougal McGuire in ''[[Father Ted]]'' (1995-98). In 1995, he appeared (as Father Dougal) in a [[Channel 4]] [[Television ident|ident]] (&quot;Hello, you're watching.... television&quot;), and during [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] on BBC1. This was followed by the award winning short comedy film ''[[Flying Saucer Rock'n'Roll]]''.

O'Hanlon moved into straight acting alongside [[Emma Fielding]] and [[Beth Goddard]] in the [[ITV]] comedy-drama ''Big Bad World'', which aired for two series in summer 1999 and winter 2001. He also played a minor role in ''[[The Butcher Boy]]'' as Joe's (Francie's best friend) father, and appeared in an episode of the original ''[[Whose Line is it Anyway?]]''.

In 2000, O'Hanlon starred in the comedy series ''[[My Hero (TV series)|My Hero]]'', in which he played a very naive superhero from the planet Ultron. His character juggled world-saving heroics with life in suburbia. He stayed in the role until early 2005 and was replaced by [[James Dreyfus]] for series 6 in 2006.

He also provided the voice of the lead character in two Christmas television cartoon specials of ''[[Robbie the Reindeer]]''. He appeared in the 2005 [[BBC One]] sitcom ''[[Blessed (television)|Blessed]]'', written by [[Ben Elton]]; at the 2005 British Comedy Awards, it was publicly slated by [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]], albeit in jest.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Towards the end of 2005, he played an eccentric Scottish character, Coconut Tam, in the family-based film, ''[[The Adventures of Greyfriars Bobby]]''.

In 2006, O'Hanlon wrote and presented an [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTE]] television series called ''Leagues Apart'', which saw him investigate the biggest and most passionate football rivalries in a number of European countries. Included were Roma vs Lazio in [[Italy]], Barcelona vs Real Madrid in [[Spain]], and Galatasaray vs Fenerbahce in [[Turkey]]. He followed this with another RTÉ show, ''[[So You Want To Be Taoiseach]]?'' in 2007. It was a political series where O'Hanlon gave tongue-in-cheek advice on how to go about becoming [[Taoiseach]] of Ireland. Both programmes went some way towards freeing O'Hanlon from his association with the character of Dougal in the minds of Irish audiences.

He appeared in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode &quot;[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]&quot;, broadcast on 14 April 2007, in which he played a feline alien named Thomas Kincade Brannigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6478495.stm|title=Fans mad for Doctor's new companion|date=2007-03-22|accessdate=2007-04-03|publisher=BBC News|author=Masters, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Hanlon appears in Series 3 of the TV show ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'', playing Naomi Campbell's Politics teacher named Kieran, who attempted to kiss her. He then went on to form a relationship with Naomi's mother. O'Hanlon plays the lead role in [[Ireland|Irish]] [[comedy]] [[television programme]] ''[[Val Falvey, TD]]'' on [[RTE One]]. He has recently performed in the Edinburgh Fringe.

In February 2011, O'Hanlon returned to the [[Gate Theatre]], Dublin starring in the Irish premiere of Christopher Hampton's [[God of Carnage]] along side [[Maura Tierney]].

O'Hanlon has written a [[novel]], ''[[The Talk of the Town (novel)|The Talk of the Town]]'' (known in the United States as ''Knick Knack Paddy Whack''), which was published in 1998. The novel is about a teenage boy, Patrick Scully, and his friends.

==Personal life==
O'Hanlon is married to Melanie, whom he met as a teenager, and with whom he has three children.
He is a Supporter of [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]].

'''Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.''' ('''AMD'''; {{nyse|AMD}}) is an American multinational [[semiconductor industry|semiconductor]] company based in [[Sunnyvale, California]], that develops [[Central processing unit|computer processors]] and related technologies for commercial and consumer markets. Its main products include [[microprocessors]], [[motherboard]] [[chipset]]s, [[embedded processor]]s and [[Graphics processing unit|graphics processors]] for [[server (computing)|server]]s, [[workstation]]s and personal computers, and processor technologies for [[handheld device]]s, [[digital television]], [[automobiles]], [[game console]]s, and other [[embedded systems]] applications. AMD's main manufacturing facilities are in [[Malaysia]] and [[Germany]] (now owned by [[GlobalFoundries]]).

AMD is the second-largest global supplier of microprocessors based on the [[x86 architecture]] and also one of the largest supplier of graphics processing units. It also owns 8.6% of [[Spansion]], a supplier of non-volatile [[flash memory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMD 10k sec filing&quot;/&gt; In 2010, AMD ranked twelfth among [[Worldwide Top 20 Semiconductor Sales Leaders|semiconductor manufacturers]] in terms of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isuppli.com/News/Pages/Semiconductor-Market-Declines-Less-Than-Expected-Samsung-Shines-in-2009.aspx|title=Semiconductor market declines less than expected |publisher=iSuppli|date=November 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate history==
[[Image:Amdheadquarters.jpg|thumb|right|250px|AMD headquarters in [[Sunnyvale, California]]]]
[[Image:AMDmarkham5.jpg|thumb|right|250px|AMD Markham in Canada, formerly ATI headquarters]]
[[Image:AMD Austin campus.JPG|thumb|right|250px|AMD's [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED-certified]] Lone Star campus in [[Austin, Texas]]]]

Advanced Micro Devices was founded on May 1, 1969, by a group of former executives from [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], including [[Jerry Sanders (businessman)|Jerry Sanders III]], [[Edwin Turney|Ed Turney]], John Carey, Sven Simonsen, [[Jack Gifford (Businessman)|Jack Gifford]] and three members from Gifford's team, Frank Botte, Jim Giles, and Larry Stenger. The company began as a producer of logic chips, then entered the [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] chip business in 1975. That same year, it introduced a [[reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] clone of the [[Intel 8080]] [[microprocessor]]. During this period, AMD also designed and produced a series of [[bit-slice]] processor elements ([[Am2900]], Am29116, Am293xx) which were used in various minicomputer designs.

During this time, AMD attempted to embrace the perceived shift towards [[RISC]] with their own [[Am29000|AMD 29K processor]], and also attempted to diversify into graphics and audio devices as well as EPROM memory. It had some success in the mid-1980s with the AMD7910 and AMD7911 &quot;World Chip&quot; [[frequency-shift keying|FSK]] modem, one of the first multistandard devices that covered both Bell and CCITT tones at up to 1200 baud half duplex or 300/300 full duplex. The AMD 29K survived as an [[embedded processor]] and AMD spinoff Spansion continues to make industry leading [[flash memory]].  AMD decided to switch gears and concentrate solely on Intel-compatible microprocessors and flash memory, placing them in direct competition with Intel for x86 compatible processors and their flash memory secondary markets.

AMD announced a [[merger]] with [[ATI Technologies]] on July 24, 2006. AMD paid $4.3&amp;nbsp;billion in cash and 58&amp;nbsp;million shares of its [[stock]] for a total of US$5.4&amp;nbsp;billion. The merger completed on October 25, 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/October2006/25/c4187.html |title=AMD Completes ATI Acquisition and Creates Processing Powerhouse |publisher=NewsWire |date=October 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ATI is now part of AMD.

It was reported in December 2006 that AMD, along with its main rival in the graphics industry [[Nvidia]], received subpoenas from the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] regarding possible [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] violations in the graphics card industry, including the act of fixing prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9584_22-6140041.html |title=Justice Dept. subpoenas AMD, NVIDIA|work=New York Times |date=December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, AMD announced plans to spin off manufacturing operations in the form of a multibillion-dollar joint venture with Advanced Technology Investment Co., an investment company formed by the government of Abu Dhabi. The new venture is called [[GlobalFoundries|GlobalFoundries Inc.]]. This will allow AMD to focus solely on chip design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/technology/07chip.html?bl&amp;ex=1223611200&amp;en=6c2c0d7539595be6&amp;ei=5087%0A | work=The New York Times | title=A.M.D. to Split Into Two Operations | first=Ashlee | last=Vance | date=October 7, 2008 | accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IBM PC and the x86 architecture===
{{Main|Am286|Am386|Am486|Am5x86}}
In February 1982, AMD signed a contract with [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], becoming a licensed second-source manufacturer of [[Intel 8086|8086]] and [[Intel 8088|8088]] processors. [[IBM]] wanted to use the Intel 8088 in its [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]], but IBM's policy at the time was to require at least two sources for its chips. AMD later produced the [[Am286]] under the same arrangement, but Intel canceled the agreement in 1986 and refused to convey technical details of the [[Intel 80386|i386]] part. AMD challenged Intel's decision to cancel the agreement and won in arbitration, but Intel disputed this decision. A long legal dispute followed, ending in 1994 when the [[Supreme Court of California]] sided with AMD. Subsequent legal disputes centered on whether AMD had legal rights to use derivatives of Intel's [[microcode]]. In the face of uncertainty, AMD was forced to develop [[clean room design]]ed versions of Intel code.

In 1991, AMD released the [[Am386]], its clone of the Intel 386 processor. It took less than a year for the company to sell a million units. Later, the [[Am486]] was used by a number of large [[original equipment manufacturer]]s, including [[Compaq]], and proved popular. Another Am486-based product, the [[Am5x86]], continued AMD's success as a low-price alternative. However, as product cycles shortened in the PC industry, the process of reverse engineering Intel's products became an ever less viable strategy for AMD.

AMD's first in-house x86 processor was the [[AMD K5|K5]] which was launched in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;CPU-INFO K5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpu-info.com/index2.php?mainid=html/cpu/amdk5.php |title=AMD K5 |accessdate=July 11, 2007 |publisher=CPU-INFO.COM }}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;K&quot; was a reference to [[Kryptonite]], which from comic book lore, was the only substance (radioactive pieces of his home planet) which could harm Superman, a clear reference to Intel, which dominated in the market at the time, as &quot;Superman&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes-Chip-Names&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Arik | last=Hesseldahl | coauthors= | title=Why Cool Chip Code Names Die | date=July 6, 2000 |work=Forbes Inc | url =http://www.forbes.com/2000/07/06/mu2.html | pages = | accessdate = July 14, 2007 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The numeral &quot;5&quot; refers to the fifth processor generation, which Intel introduced as Pentium because the US Trademark and Patent Office ruled that mere numbers could not be trademarked.

In 1996, AMD purchased [[NexGen]] specifically for the rights to their Nx series of x86-compatible processors. AMD gave the NexGen design team their own building, left them alone, and gave them time and money to rework the Nx686. The result was the [[AMD K6|K6]] processor, introduced in 1997. Although the K6 was based on [[Socket 7]], variants such as K6-2/450 were faster than Intel's Pentium II (sixth generation processor).

The K7 was AMD's seventh generation x86 processor, making its debut on June 23, 1999, under the brand name Athlon. Unlike previous AMD processors, it could not be used on the same motherboards as Intels' due to licensing issues surrounding Intel's [[Slot 1]] connector, and instead used a [[Slot A]] connector, referenced to the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] processor bus.  The [[Duron]] was a lower cost and limited version of the Athlon (64KB instead of 256KB L2 cache) in a 462-pin socketed PGA(socket A) or soldered directly on to the motherboard. [[Sempron]] was released as a lower cost Athlon XP replacing Duron in the [[socket A]] PGA era and since migrated upward to all new sockets up to [[AM3]].

On October 9, 2001 the Athlon XP was released, followed by the Athlon XP with 512KB L2 Cache on February 10, 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;The AMD Athlon XP Processor with 512KB L2 Cache&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Jack | last=Huynh | coauthors= | title=The AMD Athlon XP Processor with 512KB L2 Cache | date=February 10, 2003 | publisher=AMD | url =http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/white_papers_and_tech_docs/26485A_AthlXPwp_2-20.pdf |format=PDF| work=amd.com | pages = | accessdate = October 2, 2007 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The K8 was a major revision of the K7 architecture, with the most notable features being the addition of a [[x86-64|64-bit]] extension to the x86 instruction set (officially called AMD64), the incorporation of an on-chip memory controller, and the implementation of an extremely high performance point-to-point interconnect called [[HyperTransport]], as part of the [[Direct Connect Architecture]]. The technology was initially launched as the [[Opteron]] server-oriented processor.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Wasson. &quot;[http://www.techreport.com/reviews/2003q3/workstation/index.x?pg=1 Workstation platforms compared]&quot;, ''techreport.com'', The Tech Report, LLC., 2003-09-15, Retrieved on July 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter it was incorporated into a product for desktop PCs, branded [[Athlon 64]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Wasson. &quot;[http://www.techreport.com/reviews/2003q3/athlon64/index.x?pg=1 AMD's Athlon 64 processor]&quot;, ''techreport.com'', The Tech Report, LLC., September 23, 2003. Retrieved on July 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

AMD released the first [[dual core]] [[Opteron]], an x86-based server CPU, on April 21, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Wasson. &quot;[http://www.techreport.com/reviews/2005q2/opteron-x75/index.x?pg=1 AMD's dual-core Opteron processors]&quot;, ''techreport.com'', The Tech Report, LLC., April 21, 2005. Retrieved on July 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The first desktop-based [[Multi-core (computing)|dual core processor]] family—the [[Athlon 64 X2]]—came a month later.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Wasson. &quot;[http://www.techreport.com/reviews/2005q2/athlon64-x2/index.x?pg=1 AMD's Athlon 64 X2 processors]&quot;, ''techreport.com'', The Tech Report, LLC., May 9, 2005. Retrieved on July 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In early May 2007, AMD had abandoned the string &quot;64&quot; in its dual-core desktop product branding, becoming Athlon X2, downplaying the significance of [[x86-64|64-bit computing]] in its processors while upcoming updates involved some of the improvements to the microarchitecture, and a shift of target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dual-core desktop systems. AMD has also started to release dual-core Sempron processors in early 2008 exclusively in China, branded as Sempron 2000 series, with lower HyperTransport speed and smaller L2 cache, thus the firm completes its dual-core product portfolio for each market segment.

The latest AMD microprocessor architecture, known as [[AMD K10|K10]], became the successor to the K8 [[microarchitecture]]. The first processors released on this architecture were introduced on September 10, 2007 consisting of nine quad-core Third Generation Opteron processors. This was followed by the [[Phenom (processor)|Phenom]] processor for desktop. K10 processors came in dual-core, [[Multi-core|triple-core]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_543~120741,00.html AMD announcement]. Retrieved September 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Multi-core|quad-core]] versions with all cores on a single die. A new platform codename &quot;Spider&quot; was released utilising the new Phenom processor as well as an R770 GPU and a 790 GX/FX chipset from the [[AMD 700 chipset series]]. This was built at [[65nm]], and hence uncompetitive with Intel who already progressed to the smaller and more power efficient [[45nm]] node.

In January 2009 AMD released a new processor line dubbed [[Phenom II]], a refresh of the original [[AMD Phenom|Phenom]] built using the 45&amp;nbsp;nm process. Along with this came a new platform codename &quot;Dragon&quot; which utilised a new Phenom II processor, an [[ATI]] R770 GPU from the [[Radeon R700|R700]] GPU family, as well as a 790 GX/FX chipset from the [[AMD 700 chipset series]]. This came in a dual-core, triple-core and quad-core variants, all using the same die with cores disabled for the triple-core and dual-core versions. This resolved issues that the original Phenom had including low clock speed, a small L3 cache and a [[Cool'n'Quiet]] bug that decreased performance. This was price and performance competitive with Intel's mid to high range [[Core 2]] Quads. The processor also enhanced the Phenom's memory controller, allowing it to use [[DDR3]] in a new native socket [[AM3]], while maintaining backwards compatibility with [[AM2+]], the socket used for the Phenom, and allowing the use of the [[DDR2 SDRAM|DDR2]] memory that was used with the platform. In 2010 a new Phenom II hexa-core (6 core) processor codenamed &quot;Thuban&quot; was released. This is a totally new die based on the hexa-core &quot;Istanbul&quot; [[Opteron]] processor. It also includes AMD's &quot;turbo core&quot; technology which allows the processor to automatically switch from 6 cores to 3 faster cores when more pure speed is needed.   This is part of AMD's Enthusiast platform codenamed ”Leo&quot; utilising a new Phenom II processor, a new chipset from the [[AMD 800 chipset series]] and an [[ATI]] &quot;Cypress&quot; GPU from the [[Evergreen (GPU family)]] GPU series.

The Magny Cours and Lisbon server parts will be released in 2010.{{update after|2010|12|31}} The Magny Cours part will come in 8 to 12 cores and the Lisbon part will come in 4 and 6 core parts. Magny Cours is focused on performance while the Lisbon part is focused on high performance per watt. Magny Cours is an MCM ([[Multi-Chip Module]]) with two hexa-core &quot;Istanbul&quot; [[Opteron]] parts. This will use a new G34 socket for dual and quad socket processors and thus will be marketed as Opteron 61xx series processors. Lisbon uses C32 socket certified for dual socket use or single socket use only and thus will be marketed as Opteron 41xx processors. Both will be built on a 45&amp;nbsp;nm SOI process.

===Fusion===
{{Main|AMD Fusion|Bulldozer (processor)|Bobcat (processor)}}
After the merger between AMD and ATI, an initiative codenamed ''[[AMD Fusion|Fusion]]'' was announced that will merge a [[CPU]] and [[GPU]] on some of their entry level chips, including a minimum 16 lane [[PCI Express]] link to accommodate external PCI Express peripherals, thereby eliminating the requirement of a [[Northbridge (computing)|northbridge]] chip completely from the motherboard. The initiative will see some of the processing originally done on the CPU (e.g. [[Floating Point Unit]] operations) moved to the GPU, which is better optimized for calculations such as Floating Point Unit calculations. This is referred to by AMD as an Accelerated Processing Unit (APU).&lt;ref name=&quot;APU&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/02/amd-reveals-fusion-cpugpu-to-challege-intel-in-laptops.ars| title=AMD reveals Fusion CPU+GPU, to challege Intel in laptops| first=Jon| last=Stokes| publisher=Ars Technica| date=February 8, 2010| accessdate=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMD will move to a modular design methodology named &quot;''M-SPACE''&quot;, where two new processor cores, codenamed &quot;''[[Bulldozer (processor)|Bulldozer]]''&quot; and &quot;''[[Bobcat (processor)|Bobcat]]''&quot; will be released; Bulldozer is slated for the 2011 timeframe, whereas Bobcat is expected in Q4 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hruska&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hothardware.com/News/AMD-FlipFlops-Llano-Later-Bobcat-Bounding-Forward/ | title=AMD Flip-Flops: Llano Later, Bobcat Bounding Forward | date=July 16, 2010 | first=Joel | last=Hruska | publisher=[[HotHardware]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While very little preliminary information exists even in AMD's Technology Analyst Day 2007, both cores are to be built from the ground up. The ''Bulldozer'' core focused on 10 watt to 100 watt products, with optimizations for performance-per-watt ratios and [[High Performance Computing|HPC]] applications and includes newly announced [[XOP instruction set|XOP]], [[FMA4 instruction set|FMA4]] and [[CVT16 instruction set|CVT16]] instructions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://support.amd.com/us/Processor_TechDocs/43479.pdf | title=AMD64 Architecture Programmer’s Manual Volume 6: 128-Bit and 256-Bit XOP, FMA4 and CVT16 Instructions | date=May 1, 2009 | publisher=[[AMD]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''Bobcat'' core will focus on 1 watt to 10 watt products, given that the core is a simplified [[x86]] core to reduce power draw. Both of the cores will be able to incorporate full DirectX compatible GPU core(s) under the ''Fusion'' label, or as standalone products as a general purpose CPU.

Llano is to be the second APU  released,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hruska&quot;/&gt; targeted at the mainstream market.&lt;ref name=&quot;APU&quot;/&gt; This will incorporate a CPU and GPU on the same die, as well as the [[Chipset|Northbridge]] functions, and labeled on AMD's new timeline as using socket &quot;[[AM3]]r2&quot; with [[DDR3]] memory. This will, however, not be based on the new bulldozer core and will in fact be similar to the current [[Phenom II]] &quot;Deneb&quot; processor serving as AMD's high-end processor until the release of the new 32&amp;nbsp;nm parts.

Bulldozer is revealed to be organized in modules, each consisting of two integer cores capable of processing integers and one floating point unit ([[Floating-point unit|FPU]]). Each module will be seen by the [[Operating system|OS]] as two cores and all of AMD's new 2011, 32&amp;nbsp;nm high-end desktop and server parts will be built on the [[Bulldozer (processor)|Bulldozer microarchitecture]], including Zambezi and Orochi for the desktop and Interlagos and Valencia for the server market.

==Other platforms and technologies==
=== AMD chipsets ===
{{See also|Comparison of AMD chipsets}}
Before the launch of [[Athlon 64]] processors in 2003, AMD designed [[chipset]]s for their processors spanning the [[AMD K6|K6]] and [[AMD K7|K7]] processor generations. The chipsets include the AMD-640, AMD-751 and the AMD-761 chipsets. The situation changed in 2003 with the release of [[Athlon 64]] processors, and AMD chose not to further design its own chipsets for its desktop processors while opening the desktop platform to allow other firms to design chipsets. This is the &quot;Open Platform [[ATI]], [[VIA Technologies|VIA]] and [[SiS]] developing their own chipset for [[Athlon 64]] processors and later [[Athlon 64 X2]] and [[Athlon 64 FX]] processors, including the [[AMD Quad FX platform|Quad FX platform]] chipset from Nvidia.

The initiative went further with the release of [[Opteron]] server processors as AMD stopped the design of server chipsets in 2004 after releasing the AMD-8111 chipset, and again opened the server platform for firms to develop chipsets for Opteron processors. As of today, [[Nvidia]] and [[Broadcom]] are the sole designing firms of server chipsets for Opteron processors.

As the company completed the acquisition of ATI Technologies in 2006, the firm gained the ATI design team for chipsets which previously designed the [[Xpress 200|Radeon Xpress 200]] and the [[Xpress 3200|Radeon Xpress 3200]] chipsets. AMD then renamed the chipsets for AMD processors under AMD branding (for instance, the CrossFire Xpress 3200 chipset was renamed as [[AMD 580 chipset series|AMD 580X CrossFire chipset]]). In February 2007, AMD announced the first AMD-branded chipset since 2004 with the release of the AMD [[AMD 690 chipset series|690G]] chipset (previously under the development codename ''RS690''), targeted at mainstream [[Integrated Graphics Processor|IGP]] computing. It was the industry's first to implement a [[HDMI]] 1.2 port on motherboards, shipping for more than a million units. While ATI had aimed at releasing an Intel IGP chipset, the plan was scrapped and the inventories of [[AMD 690 chipset series#Radeon Xpress 1250|Radeon Xpress 1250]] (codenamed ''RS600'', sold under ATI brand) was sold to two OEMs, Abit and ASRock. Although AMD states the firm will still produce Intel chipsets, Intel had not granted the license of {{nowrap|1333 MHz}} FSB to ATI.

On November 15, 2007, AMD announced a new chipset series portfolio, the [[AMD 700 chipset series|AMD 7-Series chipsets]], covering from enthusiast multi-graphics segment to value IGP segment, to replace the [[AMD 580 chipset series|AMD 480/570/580 chipsets]] and [[AMD 690 chipset series|AMD 690 series chipsets]], marking AMD's first enthusiast multi-graphics chipset.  Discrete graphics chipsets were launched on November 15, 2007 as part of the codenamed ''Spider'' desktop platform, and IGP chipsets were launched at a later time in Spring 2008 as part of the codenamed ''Cartwheel'' platform.

AMD will also return to the server chipsets market with the next-generation [[AMD 800 chipset series|AMD 800S series server chipsets]], scheduled to be released in 2009 timeframe.

===AMD Quad FX platform===
{{Main|AMD Quad FX platform}}
The AMD Quad FX platform, being an extreme enthusiast platform, allows two processors to connect through [[HyperTransport]], which is a similar setup to dual-processor (2P) servers, excluding the use of [[buffered memory]]/[[registered memory]] [[DIMM]] modules, and a server motherboard, the current setup includes two [[Athlon 64 FX]]-70 series processors and a special motherboard. AMD pushed the platform for the surging demands for what AMD calls &quot;megatasking&quot; for true enthusiasts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_543~114483,00.html?redir=dtfx04 Official Press Release] (AMD Quad FX Platform with Dual Socket Direct Connect Architecture Redefines High-End Computing for Megatasking Enthusiasts)&lt;/ref&gt; the ability to do more tasks on a single system. The platform refreshes with the introduction of [[AMD K10|Phenom FX]] processors and the next-generation [[RD700 chipset series|RD790]] chipset, codenamed &quot;''FASN8''&quot;.

===Commercial platform===
The first AMD server/workstation platform after ATI acquisition is scheduled to be released on 2009 timeframe. Codenamed ''[[Fiorano (AMD)|Fiorano]]'', AMD's first [[Symmetric multiprocessing|multi-processor]] server platform after ATI acquisition consists of [[AMD 800 chipset series|AMD SR5690 + SP5100 server chipsets]], supporting [[45 nm]], codenamed ''Shanghai'' [[Socket F+]] processors and registered DDR2 memory. Future update include the ''[[Maranello]]'' platform supporting [[45 nm]], codenamed ''Istanbul'', [[Socket G34]] processors with DDR3 memory. On single-processor platform, the codenamed ''[[Catalunya]]'' platform consists of codenamed ''Suzuka'' 45&amp;nbsp;nm quad-core processor with [[AMD 800 chipset series|AMD SR5580 + SP5100 chipset]] and DDR3 support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/Platform_RM_Fusion.pdf AMD Server/Workstation platform roadmap], retrieved October 4, 2008 {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMD's [[x86 virtualization]] extension to the 64-bit x86 architecture is named ''AMD Virtualization'', also known by the abbreviation ''[[AMD-V]]'', and is sometimes referred to by the code name &quot;Pacifica&quot;. AMD processors using [[Socket AM2]], [[Socket S1]], and [[Socket F]] include AMD Virtualization support. AMD Virtualization is also supported by release two (8200, 2200 and 1200 series) of the Opteron processors. The third generation (8300 and 2300 series) of [[Opteron]] processors will see an update in virtualization technology, specifically the Rapid Virtualization Indexing (also known by the development name ''Nested Page Tables''), alongside the Tagged [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] and Device Exclusion Vector (DEV).

AMD also promotes the &quot;AMD I/O Virtualization Technology&quot; (also known as [[IOMMU]]) for I/O virtualization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_543~117440,00.html|title=AMD press release}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AMD IOMMU specification has been updated to version 1.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/white_papers_and_tech_docs/34434.pdf | title=AMD IOMMU specification 1.2 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specification describes the use of a [[HyperTransport]] architecture.

AMD's commercial initiatives include the following:
* AMD Trinity, provides support for virtualization, security and management. Key features include [[AMD#Virtualization|AMD-V]] technology, codenamed ''Presidio'' [[trusted computing]] platform technology, I/O Virtualization and Open Management Partition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/MartySeyerAMDAnalystWebv3.pdf AMD Analyst Day presentation], page 24. Retrieved July 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* AMD Raiden, future clients similar to the [[Jack PC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chippc.com/thin-clients/jack-pc/|title=Jack PC page}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be connected through network to a blade server for central management, to reduce client form factor sizes with AMD Trinity features.
* [[Torrenza]], [[coprocessor]]s support through interconnects such as [[HyperTransport]], and [[PCI Express]] (though more focus was at [[HyperTransport]] enabled coprocessors), also opening processor socket architecture to other manufacturers, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] and [[IBM]] are among the supporting consortium, with rumoured [[POWER7]] processors would be socket-compatible to future Opteron processors. The move made rival [[Intel]] responded with the open of [[Front Side Bus]] (FSB) architecture as well as [[PCI Express|Geneseo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20060927comp_a.htm|title=Intel Geneseo press release}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collaboration project with [[IBM]] for coprocessors connected through [[PCI Express]].
* Various certified systems programs and platforms: AMD Commercial Stable Image Platform (CSIP), together with AMD Validated Server program, AMD True Server Solutions, AMD Thermally Tested Barebones Platforms and AMD Validated Server Program, providing certified systems for business from AMD.

===Desktop platforms===
Starting in 2007, AMD, following Intel, began using [[codename]]s for its desktop platforms such as ''[[AMD Spider|Spider]]'' or ''[[AMD Dragon|Dragon]]''. The platforms, unlike Intel's approach, will refresh every year, putting focus on platform specialization. The platform includes components as AMD processors, chipsets, ATI graphics and other features, but continued to the open platform approach, and welcome components from other vendors such as VIA, SiS, and Nvidia, as well as wireless product vendors.

Updates to the platform includes the implementation of [[IOMMU]] [[AMD Virtualization|I/O Virtualization]] with [[45 nm]] generation of processors, and the [[AMD 800 chipset series]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.amd.com/Corporate/MarioRivasDec2007AMDAnalystDay.pdf AMD Financial Analyst Day 2007 presentation], presented by Mario Rivas, page 24 of 28.

===Embedded systems===
{{Main|Alchemy (processor)|Geode (processor)}}

In February 2002, AMD acquired Alchemy Semiconductor for its [[Alchemy (processor)|Alchemy]] line of [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] processors for the hand-held and [[portable media player]] markets. On June 13, 2006, AMD officially announced that the line was to be transferred to Raza Microelectronics, Inc., a designer of MIPS processors for embedded applications.&lt;ref name='Alchemy'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=AMD Alchemy processor product line acquired by Raza Microelectronics | date=June 14, 2006 | publisher=technologynewsdaily.com | url =http://www.technologynewsdaily.com/node/3336 | work=TechNews | pages = | accessdate = July 11, 2007 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2003, AMD also purchased the [[Geode (processor)|Geode]] business which was originally the [[Cyrix]] [[MediaGX]] from [[National Semiconductor]] to augment its existing line of embedded x86 processor products. During the second quarter of 2004, it launched new low-power Geode NX processors based on the K7 Thoroughbred architecture with speeds of fanless processors {{nowrap|667 MHz}} and {{nowrap|1 GHz}}, and {{nowrap|1.4 GHz}} processor with fan, of [[Thermal Design Power|TDP]] 25 [[Watt|W]]. This technology is used in a variety of embedded systems (Casino slot machines and customer kiosks for instance), several [[Ultra Mobile PC|UMPC]] designs in Asia markets, as well as the [[One Laptop per Child|OLPC]] [[OLPC XO-1|XO-1 computer]], an inexpensive laptop computer intended to be distributed to children in developing countries around the world.

For the past couple of years AMD has been introducing [[x86-64|64-bit]] processors into its embedded product line starting with the AMD [[Opteron]] processor.  Leveraging the high throughput enabled through [[HyperTransport]] and the [[Direct Connect Architecture]] these server class processors have been targeted at high end telecom and storage applications. In 2006 AMD added the AMD Athlon, AMD Turion and Mobile AMD Sempron processors to its embedded product line. Leveraging the same [[x86-64|64-bit]] instruction set and [[Direct Connect Architecture]] as the AMD [[Opteron]] but at lower power levels, these processors were well suited to a variety of traditional embedded applications. Throughout 2007 and into 2008 AMD has continued to add both single-core Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors and [[Multi-core (computing)|dual-core]] AMD Athlon X2 and AMD Turion processors to its embedded product line and now offers embedded [[x86-64|64-bit]] solutions starting with 8W TDP Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors for fan-less designs up to multi-processor systems leveraging multi-core AMD Opteron processors all supporting longer than standard availability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amd.com/us/products/embedded/Pages/embedded.aspx AMD Embedded Solutions that are scalable, x86- based, low-power and feature-rich products]. Amd.com (2010-11-05). Retrieved on 2010-11-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, AMD announced the release of the [[AMD 690 chipset series#M690T|M690T]] integrated graphics chipset for embedded designs. This enabled AMD to offer complete processor and chipset solutions targeted at embedded applications requiring high performance 3D and video such as emerging digital signage, kiosk and Point of Sale applications. The M690T was followed by the [[AMD 690 chipset series#M690E|M690E]] specifically for embedded applications which removed the TV output, which required [[Macrovision]] licensing for OEMs, and enabled native support for dual [[Transition Minimized Differential Signaling|TMDS]] outputs, enabling dual independent [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] interfaces.

===Flash technology===
{{Main|Spansion}}
While less visible to the general public than its CPU business, AMD is also a global leader in [[flash memory]]. In 1993, AMD established a 50-50 partnership with [[Fujitsu]] called FASL, and merged into a new company called [[Spansion|FASL LLC]] in 2003. The joint venture firm went public under ticker symbol SPSN in December 2005, with AMD shares drop to 37%.

AMD no longer directly participates in the Flash memory devices market now as AMD entered into a non-competition agreement, as of December 21, 2005, with Fujitsu and Spansion, pursuant to which it agreed not to directly or indirectly engage in a business that manufactures or supplies standalone semiconductor devices (including single chip, multiple chip or system devices) containing only Flash memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.shareholder.com/s/viewerContent.aspx?companyid=SPSN&amp;docid=4095716|title=Press release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobile platforms===
[[Image:Better by Design Sticker -1.png|right|75px]]
{{Main|AMD mobile platform}}

AMD started a platform in 2003 aimed at mobile computing, but, with fewer advertisements and promotional schemes, very little was known about the platform. The platform used [[mobile Athlon 64]] or [[mobile Sempron]] processors.

As part of the &quot;Better by design&quot; initiative, the open mobile platform, announced February 2007 with announcement of general availability in May 2007, comes together with [[65 nm]] fabrication process [[Turion 64 X2]], and consists of three major components: an AMD processor, graphics from either [[Nvidia]] or [[ATI Technologies]] which also includes integrated graphics ([[Integrated Graphics Processor|IGP]]), and wireless connectivity solutions from [[Atheros]], [[Broadcom]], [[Marvell Technology Group|Marvell]], [[Qualcomm]] or [[Realtek]].

The ''[[AMD Puma|Puma]]'' platform and [[Turion Ultra]] processor was released on June 4, 2008. In the future, AMD plans quad-core processors with 3D graphics capabilities (''[[AMD Fusion|Fusion]]'') to be launched in 2011 as the [[AMD mobile platform#Sabine/Fusion platform (2011)|Sabine/Fusion]] platform.

* [[50x15 (AMD)|50x15]], digital inclusion, with targeted 50% of world population to be connected through Internet via affordable computers by the year of 2015.
* [[The Green Grid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreengrid.org/|title=The Green Grid website}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by AMD together with other founders, such as [[IBM]], [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] and [[Microsoft]], to seek lower power consumption for grids. Intel was notably absent from the consortium when it was founded, and finally joined in early 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/12/07/intel_green_grid/|title=Intel set to join AMD-backed Green Grid}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Codenamed ''SIMFIRE'' interoperability testing tool for the Desktop and mobile Architecture for System Hardware (DASH) open architecture.

===Software===
* Extensions for software parallelism (xSP), aimed at speeding up programs to enable multi-threaded and multi-core processing, announced in Technology Analyst Day 2007. One of the initiatives being discussed since August 2007 is the Light Weight Profiling (LWP), providing internal hardware monitor with runtimes, to observe information about executing process and help the re-design of software to be optimized with multi-core and even multi-threaded programs. Another one is the extension of Streaming SIMD Extension (SSE) instruction set, the [[SSE5]].

* AMD contributes to [[open source]] projects, including working with [[Sun Microsystems]] to enhance [[OpenSolaris]] and [[Sun xVM]] on the AMD platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

* Other AMD open source projects include the [[AMD Performance Library]] and the [[AMD Core Math Library]].

===Technologies from ATI===
After the takeover of [[ATI Technologies|ATI]], AMD restructured some of the product lineups from both companies. Some products were being rebranded under the AMD brand, including the [[Imageon]] for mobile phones and [[handheld]] devices, the [[Xilleon]] for [[consumer electronics]] (digital TV sets), ATI Xpress chipsets (to AMD chipsets) for AMD processors platform and GPGPU computing line-up [[FireStream]], previously known as [[AMD Stream Processor]]. Some others retained the use of ATI branding, including the [[Radeon]] line of graphics, and chipsets for Intel processors.

==Production and fabrication==
{{Main|GlobalFoundries}}

Ever since the spinoff of AMD's fabrication plants in early 2009, [[GlobalFoundries]] has been responsible for producing AMD's processors.

[[GlobalFoundries]]' main microprocessor manufacturing facilities are located in [[Dresden]], Germany. Additionally, highly integrated microprocessors are manufactured in Taiwan made by third-party manufacturers under strict license from AMD. Between 2003 and 2005, they constructed a second manufacturing plant ({{nowrap|300 mm}} [[90 nm]] process [[silicon on insulator|SOI]]) in the same complex in order to increase the number of chips they can produce, thus becoming more competitive with [[Intel]]. The new plant has been named &quot;Fab 36&quot;, in recognition of AMD's 36 years of operation, and reached full production in mid-2007. Fab 36 has been renamed to Fab 1 during the spinoff of AMD's manufacturing business during the creation of [[GlobalFoundries]]. In July 2007, AMD announced that they completed the conversion of Fab 1 Module 1 from {{nowrap|90 nm}} to [[65 nm]].  They then shifted their focus to the [[45 nm]] conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Rick C. Hodgin. While AMD was in the progression to 45 nm, its rival Intel Corp was one year ahead in manufacturing technology and releasing its 32 nm technology (Intel &quot;tick-tock&quot; advancement roadmap)&quot;[http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/33105/135/1/3/ Wrap-up: AMD outlines a bright future at Technology Analyst Day]&quot;, ''tgdaily.com'', Tigervision Media, 2007-07-26, pp.4. Retrieved on July 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate affairs==
=== Partnerships ===
AMD utilizes strategic industry partnerships to further its business interests as well as to tackle Intel's dominance and resources.

A partnership between AMD and Alpha Processor Inc. developed [[HyperTransport]], a point-to-point interconnect standard which was turned over to an industry standards body for finalization. It is now used in modern AMD processor compatible motherboards.

AMD also formed a strategic partnership with IBM, under which AMD gained [[silicon on insulator]] (SOI) manufacturing technology, and detailed advice on [[90 nm]] implementation, the partnership was announced by AMD to be extended to 2011 for [[32 nm]] and [[22 nm]] fabrication related technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/DarylOstranderAMDAnalystDay.pdf AMD Analyst Day June 2006 Presentation], slide 10&lt;/ref&gt; Further, AMD is loosely partnered with end-user companies such as [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Compaq]], [[ASUS]], [[Alienware]], [[Acer (company)|Acer]], [[Evesham Technology]], [[Dell]] and several others to facilitate processor distribution and sales.

On May 18, 2006, Dell announced that it would roll out new servers based on AMD's Opteron chips by years end, thus ending an exclusive relationship with Intel. Dell also began offering AMD Athlon X2 chips in their desktop line-up in September 2006.

AMD is also a sponsor of the [[Scuderia Ferrari]] Marlboro F1 Team since 2002 and the [[Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team]] since 2004, in 2009 AMD also became the jersey sponsor of the [[United Soccer Leagues|USL]] expansion team [[Austin Aztex FC]].

===Litigation with Intel===
{{See also|AMD v. Intel}}
AMD has a long history of litigation with former partner and x86 creator [[Intel Corporation|Intel]].&lt;ref name=litigation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/AMD_-_Intel_Litigation_History.pdf |format=PDF|title=AMD-INTEL LITIGATION HISTORY |publisher=AMD |accessdate=January 12, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070108093846/http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/AMD_-_Intel_Litigation_History.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = January 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/Complaint_summary.pdf|title=Summary U.S. antitrust complaint against Intel|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/AMD-Intel_Full_Complaint.pdf|title=Full text of U.S. antitrust complaint against Intel|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1986 Intel broke an agreement it had with AMD to allow them to produce Intel's micro-chips for [[IBM]]; AMD filed for [[arbitration]] in 1987 and the arbitrator decided in AMD's favor in 1992. Intel disputed this, and the case ended up in the [[Supreme Court of California]]. In 1994, that court upheld the arbitrator's decision and awarded damages for breach of contract.
*In 1990, Intel brought a copyright infringement action alleging illegal use of its 287 microcode. The case ended in 1994 with a jury finding for AMD and its right to use Intel's microcode in its microprocessors through the 486 generation.
*In 1997, Intel filed suit against AMD and [[Cyrix]] Corp. for misuse of the term [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]]. AMD and Intel settled, with AMD acknowledging MMX as a trademark owned by Intel, and with Intel granting AMD rights to market the AMD K6 MMX processor.
*In 2005, following an investigation, the Japan Federal Trade Commission found Intel guilty on a number of violations. On June 27, 2005, AMD won an [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] suit against Intel in Japan, and on the same day, AMD filed a broad antitrust complaint against Intel in the U.S. Federal District Court in [[Delaware]]. The complaint alleges systematic use of secret rebates, special discounts, threats, and other means used by Intel to lock AMD processors out of the global market. Since the start of this action, the court has issued [[subpoena]]s to major computer manufacturers including [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Dell]], [[Lenovo]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and [[Toshiba]].
*In November 2009, Intel agreed to pay AMD $1.25bn and renew a five-year patent cross-licensing agreement as part of a deal to settle all outstanding legal disputes between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;amd suit&quot;&gt;
Intel, AMD Settle Legal Disputes. &quot;[http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/technology/amd-intel-settle-legal-disputes/]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events and publications===
Although AMD frequently refuses to provide information about upcoming products and plans, it does hold annual Analyst Days  to reveal and explain key future technologies, and to present official [[technology roadmap]]s. The event held in mid-year is referred to as &quot;Technology Analyst Day&quot;, with its main focus on upcoming technologies and trends. The end-of-year event is referred to as &quot;Financial Analyst Day&quot; and focuses on the financial performance of the company through the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/InvestorRelations/0,,51_306_15401,00.html?redir=IRAD01 AMD Financial Analyst Day 2007 page]. Retrieved December 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these events, AMD also publishes [[printed media]]. Publications include the AMD Accelerate and the discontinued AMDEdge. The AMD Accelerate magazine, originally published through [[Ziff Davis|Ziff Davis Media]], focuses on [[Small and medium enterprises|SME]] and business applications, while AMD Edge focused on overall technologies from AMD. Since Ziff Davis Media filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the AMD Accelerate magazine has been published through [[International Data Group|IDG]]. AMD also has electronic [[newsletter]]s to promote its server-oriented [[Opteron]] processors and related business solutions.

'''Albrecht Dürer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈalbʁɛçt ˈdyːʁɐ}}; 21 May 1471 – 6 April 1528)&lt;ref name=Mueller&gt;Mueller, Peter O. (1993) ''Substantiv-Derivation in Den Schriften Albrecht Durers'', Walter de Gruyter. ISBN 3-11-012815-2.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Germans|German]] [[Painting|painter]], [[printmaker]], [[mathematician]], [[engraver]], and [[theorist]] from [[Nuremberg]]. His prints established his reputation across Europe when he was still in his twenties, and he has been conventionally regarded as the greatest artist of the [[Northern Renaissance]] ever since. His vast body of work includes altarpieces and religious works, numerous portraits and self-portraits, and copper engravings. His woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known works include the ''[[Knight, Death, and the Devil]]'' (1513), ''[[St. Jerome in His Study (Dürer)|Saint Jerome in his Study]]'' (1514) and ''[[Melencolia I]]''  (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His [[watercolours]] mark him as one of the first European [[landscape art]]ists, while his ambitious [[woodcut]]s revolutionized the potential of that medium.

Dürer's introduction of [[Roman mythology|classical motifs]] into Northern art, through his knowledge of [[Italian Renaissance|Italian artists]] and [[Humanism in Germany|German humanists]], have secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the [[Northern Renaissance]]. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of [[mathematics]], [[linear perspective|perspective]] and [[body proportions|ideal proportions]].

==Early life (1471–90)==
[[Image:Durer herb.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Dürer's own woodcut of his [[coat of arms]]]]
[[Image:Duerer autoportrait (1484).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Self-portrait]] [[silverpoint]] drawing by the thirteen-year-old Dürer, 1484]]
[[Image:Albrecht-self.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The earliest painted ''Self-Portrait'' (1493) by Albrecht Dürer, oil, originally on [[vellum]] [[Louvre]], [[Paris]]]]

Dürer was born on 21 May 1471, third child and second son of his parents, who had between fourteen and eighteen children. His father was a successful [[goldsmith]], originally named Ajtósi, who in 1455 had moved to Nuremberg from [[Ajtós]], near [[Gyula (town)|Gyula]] in [[Hungary]]. The German name &quot;Dürer&quot; is derived from the Hungarian, &quot;Ajtósi&quot;. Initially, it was &quot;Thürer,&quot; meaning doormaker, which is &quot;ajtós&quot; in Hungarian (from &quot;ajtó&quot;, meaning door). A door is featured in the [[coat-of-arms]] the family acquired. Albrecht Dürer the Elder married Barbara Holper, the daughter of his master, when he himself became a master in 1467.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum, 93, note 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Dürer's godfather was [[Anton Koberger]], who left goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher in the year of Dürer's birth.  He quickly became the most successful publisher in Germany, eventually owning twenty-four [[printing-press]]es and having many offices in Germany and abroad. His most famous publication was the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]],'' published in 1493 in German and Latin editions. It contained an unprecedented 1,809 [[woodcut]] illustrations (with many repeated uses of the same block) by the [[Wolgemut]] workshop. Dürer may well have worked on some of these, as the work on the project began while he was with Wolgemut.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartrum&quot;&gt;Giulia Bartrum, &quot;Albrecht Dürer and his Legacy&quot;, British Museum Press, 2002, ISBN 0714126330&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Dürer left autobiographical writings and became very famous by his mid-twenties, his life is well documented by several sources. After a few years of school, Dürer started to learn the basics of goldsmithing and drawing from his father. Though his father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith, he showed such a precocious talent in drawing that he started as an apprentice to [[Michael Wolgemut]] at the age of fifteen in 1486. A self-portrait, a [[drawing]] in [[silverpoint]], is dated 1484 ([[Albertina, Vienna]]) “when I was a child,&quot; as his later inscription says. Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time, with a large workshop producing a variety of works of art, in particular woodcuts for books. Nuremberg was then an important and prosperous city, a centre for publishing and many luxury trades. It had strong links with [[Italy]], especially [[Venice]], a relatively short distance across the [[Alps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartrum&quot;/&gt;

==''Wanderjahre'' and marriage (1490–94)==
After completing his term of apprenticeship, Dürer followed the common German custom of taking ''[[Wanderjahre]]''—in effect [[gap year]]—in which the apprentice learned skills from artists in other areas; Dürer was to spend about four years away.  He left in 1490, possibly to work under [[Martin Schongauer]], the leading engraver of Northern Europe, but who died shortly before Dürer's arrival at [[Colmar]] in 1492. It is unclear  where Dürer travelled in the intervening period, though it is likely that he went to [[Frankfurt]] and the [[Netherlands]]. In Colmar, Dürer was welcomed by Schongauer's brothers, the goldsmiths Caspar and Paul and the painter Ludwig. In 1493 Dürer went to Strasbourg, where he would have experienced the sculpture of [[Nikolaus Gerhaert]]. Dürer's first painted self-portrait (now in the [[Louvre]]) was painted at this time, probably to be sent back to his fiancé in Nuremberg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartrum&quot;/&gt;

In early 1492 Dürer travelled to [[Basel]] to stay with another brother of Martin Schongauer, the goldsmith Georg.&lt;ref&gt;Here he produced a woodcut of [[St Jerome]] as a frontispiece for Nicholaus Kessler's 'Epistolare beati Hieronymi'. Panofsky argues that this print combined the '[[Ulm]]ian style' of Koberger's 'Lives of the Saints' (1488) and that of Wolgemut's workshop.  Panofsky:21&lt;/ref&gt;  Very soon after his return to Nuremberg, on 7 July 1494, at the age of 23, Dürer was married to Agnes Frey following an arrangement made during his absence. Agnes was the daughter of a prominent brass worker (and amateur harpist) in the city. However, no children resulted from the marriage.

==First journey to Italy (1494–95)==
[[Image:Durer Young Hare.jpg|thumb|left|''Young Hare'', 1502, Watercolour and bodycolour ([[Albertina, Vienna|Albertina]])]]
Within three months Dürer left for Italy, alone, perhaps stimulated by an outbreak of [[Black Death|plague]] in Nuremberg. He made [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]] sketches as he traveled over the Alps. Some have survived and others may be deduced from accurate landscapes of real places in his later work, for example his engraving ''Nemesis''. These are the first pure landscape studies known in Western art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartrum&quot;/&gt;

In Italy, he went to [[Venice]] to study its more advanced artistic world.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Lee, Raymond L. &amp; Alistair B. Fraser. (2001) ''The Rainbow Bridge'', Penn State Press. ISBN 0-271-01977-8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Through Wolgemut's tutelage, Dürer had learned how to make prints in [[drypoint]] and design [[woodcut]]s in the German style, based on the works of [[Martin Schongauer]] and the [[Housebook Master]].&lt;ref name=Lee /&gt; He also would have had access to some Italian works in Germany, but the two visits he made to Italy had an enormous influence on him. He wrote that [[Giovanni Bellini]] was the oldest and still the best of the artists in Venice. His drawings and engravings show the influence of others, notably [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]] with his interest in the proportions of the body, Mantegna, [[Lorenzo di Credi]] and others. Dürer probably also visited [[Padua, Italy|Padua]] and [[Mantua]] on this trip.&lt;ref&gt;The evidence for this trip is not conclusive; the suggestion it happened is supported by Erwin Panofsky (in his Albrecht Dürer, 1943) and others, but it has been disputed by other scholars, including Katherine Crawford Luber (in her Albrecht Dürer and the Venetian Renaissance, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Nuremberg (1495–1505)==
[[Image:Dürer Melancholia I.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Melencolia I]]'', 1514, Albrecht Dürer engraving]]

On his return to Nuremberg in 1495, Dürer opened his own workshop (being married was a requirement for this). Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Dürer's father died in 1502, and his mother died soon after in 1513.&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;Allen, L. Jessie. (1903) ''Albrecht Dürer'', Methuen &amp; co.&lt;/ref&gt; His best works in the first years of the workshop were his [[woodcut]] prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as ''The Men's Bath House'' (ca. 1496). These were larger than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition.

It is now thought unlikely that Dürer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Dürer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.

His famous series of sixteen great designs for the ''Apocalypse&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.payer.de/christentum/apokalypse.htm Johannesapokalypse in klassischen Comics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;'' are dated 1498, as is his engraving [[St. Michael Fighting the Dragon-Albrecht Durer|St. Michael Fighting the Dragon]]. He made the first seven scenes of the ''Great Passion'' in the same year, and a little later, a series of eleven on the [[Holy Family]] and saints. Around 1503–1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'', which he did not finish for some years. Neither these, nor the ''Great Passion,'' were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartrum&quot;/&gt;

During the same period Dürer trained himself in the difficult art of using the [[Burin (tool)|burin]] to make [[engraving]]s. It is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father, as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith. The first few were relatively unambitious, but by 1496 he was able to produce the masterpiece, the ''Prodigal Son,'' which [[Vasari]] singled out for praise some decades later, noting its Germanic quality.  He was soon producing some spectacular and original images, notably ''Nemesis'' (1502), ''The  Sea Monster'' (1498), and ''[[:Image:Dürer10.jpg|Saint Eustace]]'' (ca.1501), with a highly detailed landscape background and animals. He made a number of [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]]s, single religious figures, and small scenes with comic peasant figures. Prints are highly portable and these works made Dürer famous throughout the main artistic centres of Europe within a very few years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartrum&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Dürer Oswolt Krel.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Oswolt Krel, a merchant from [[Lindau]] ([[Lake Constance]]), participating in the South German medieval trade corporation Große [[Ravensburg]]er Handelsgesellschaft, 1499]]
The Venetian artist [[Jacopo de' Barbari]], whom Dürer had met in Venice, visited Nuremberg in 1500, and Dürer said that he learned much about the new developments in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], [[anatomy]], and [[Body proportions|proportion]] from him. He was unwilling to explain everything he knew, so Dürer began his own studies, which would become a lifelong preoccupation. A series of extant drawings show Dürer's experiments in human proportion, leading to the famous engraving of ''[[commons:File:Adam Eva, Durer, 1504.jpg|Adam and Eve]]'' (1504), which shows his subtlety while using the [[Burin (tool)|burin]] in the texturing of flesh surfaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartrum&quot;/&gt; This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name.

Dürer made large numbers of preparatory drawings, especially for his paintings and engravings, and many survive, most famously the ''[[Betende Hände]]'' (engl. ''Praying Hands'', c. 1508 [[Albertina, Vienna]]), a study for an apostle in the Heller altarpiece.  He also continued to make images in [[watercolour]] and [[bodycolour]] (usually combined), including a number of still lifes of meadow sections or animals, including his ''[[Young Hare]]'' (1502) and the ''[[Great Piece of Turf]]'' (1503, both also Albertina).

==Second journey to Italy (1505–1507)==
[[Image:Duerer-Prayer.jpg|100px|thumb|right|''The Praying Hands'']]
In Italy, he returned to painting, at first producing a series of works executed in [[tempera]] on [[linen]].  These include portraits and altarpieces, notably, the Paumgartner [[altarpiece]] and the ''[[Adoration of the Magi in Art|Adoration of the Magi]]''. In early 1506, he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507.&lt;ref name=Mueller /&gt;  By this time Dürer's engravings had attained great popularity and were being copied. In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of [[San Bartolomeo, Venice|San Bartolomeo]].  This was the altar-piece known as the ''Adoration of the Virgin'' or the ''Feast of Rose Garlands''.  It includes portraits of members of Venice's German community, but shows a strong Italian influence. It was subsequently acquired by the Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] and taken to [[Prague]]. Other paintings Dürer produced in Venice include ''The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch'', ''Christ disputing with the Doctors'' (supposedly produced in a mere five days), and a number of smaller works.

==Nuremberg and the masterworks (1507–1520)==
Despite the regard in which he was held by the Venetians, Dürer was back in Nuremberg by mid-1507, and he remained in Germany until 1520. His reputation had spread throughout Europe and he was on friendly terms and in communication with most of the major artists including [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]] and—mainly through [[Lorenzo di Credi]]—[[Leonardo da Vinci]].

[[Image:Durer Adam and Eve.jpg|200px|thumb|left|''[[Adam and Eve (Dürer)|Adam and Eve]]'', by Albrecht Dürer (1507)]]

Between 1507 and 1511 Dürer worked on some of his most celebrated paintings: ''Adam and Eve'' (1507), ''[[Saint Ursula|The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand]]'' (1508, for [[Frederick the Wise]]), ''Virgin with the Iris'' (1508), the altarpiece ''Assumption of the Virgin'' (1509, for Jacob Heller of [[Frankfurt]]), and ''Adoration of the Trinity'' (1511, for Matthaeus Landauer). During this period he also completed two woodcut series, the Great Passion and the Life of the Virgin, both published in 1511 together with a second edition of the Apocalypse series. The post-Venetian woodcuts show Dürer's development of [[chiaroscuro]] modelling effects,&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky:135&lt;/ref&gt; creating a mid-tone throughout the print to which the highlights and shadows can be contrasted.
[[File:Duerer (Marter der zehntausend Christen).jpg|thumb|[[Self portrait]], 1508]]
Other works from this period include the thirty-seven woodcut subjects of the Little Passion, published first in 1511, and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 1512. Indeed, complaining that painting did not make enough money to justify the time spent when compared to his prints, he produced no paintings from 1513 to 1516. However, in 1513 and 1514 Dürer created his three most famous [[engraving]]s: ''The Knight, Death, and the Devil'' (1513, probably based on [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]'s treatise 'Enichiridion militis Christiani'), ''[[St. Jerome in His Study (Dürer)|St. Jerome in his Study]]'', and the much-debated ''[[Melencolia I]]'' (both 1514).

In 1515, he created his ''[[Dürer's Rhinoceros|woodcut of the Rhinoceros]]'' which had arrived in [[Lisbon]] from a written description and sketch by another artist, without ever seeing the animal himself. An image of the [[Indian rhinoceros]], the image has such force that it remains one of his best-known and was still used in some German school science text-books as late as last century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartrum&quot;/&gt; In the years leading to 1520 he produced a wide range of works, including portraits in [[tempera]] on [[linen]] in 1516.

===Patronage of Maximilian I===
From 1512, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], became Dürer's major patron. His commissions included ''[[The Triumphal Arch]]'', a vast work printed from 192 separate blocks, the symbolism of which is partly informed by Pirckheimer's translation of [[Horapollo]]'s ''Hieroglyphica''. The design program and explanations were devised by [[Johannes Stabius]], the architectural design by the master builder and court-painter Jörg Kölderer and the woodcutting itself by Hieronymous Andreae, with Dürer as designer-in-chief. The Arch was followed by the Triumphal Procession, the program of which was worked out in 1512 by [[:de:Marx Treitzsaurwein|Marx Treitz-Saurwein]] and includes woodcuts by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] and [[Hans Springinklee]], as well as Dürer.

Dürer worked in pen on the marginal images for an edition of the Emperor's printed Prayer-Book; these were quite unknown until facsimiles were published in 1808 as part of the first book published in [[lithography]]. Dürer's work on the book was halted for an unknown reason, and the decoration was continued by artists including [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and [[Hans Baldung]]. Dürer also made several portraits of the Emperor, including one shortly before Maximilian's death in 1519.

==Journey to the Netherlands (1520–21)==
[[File:St. Cristopher-Dürer.jpg|right|thumb|St. Christopher, [[engraving]], 1521, by Albrecht Dürer]]

Maximilian's sudden death came at a time when Dürer was concerned he was losing &quot;my sight and freedom of hand&quot; (perhaps to [[arthritis]]) and increasingly affected by the writings of [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum, 204. Quotation from a letter to the secretary of the Elector of Saxony&lt;/ref&gt;   In July 1520 Dürer made his fourth and last major journey, to renew the Imperial pension Maximilian had given him and to secure the patronage of the new emperor, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who was to be crowned at [[Aachen]]. Dürer journeyed with his wife and her maid via the [[Rhine]] to [[Cologne]] and then to [[Antwerp]], where he was well-received and produced numerous drawings in [[silverpoint]], chalk and charcoal. In addition to going to the coronation, he made excursions to [[Cologne]] (where he admired the painting of [[Stefan Lochner]]), [[Nijmegen]], [['s-Hertogenbosch]], [[Bruges]] (where he saw [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Madonna of Bruges]]), [[Ghent]] (where he admired [[Jan van Eyck|van Eyck]]'s altarpiece), and [[Zeeland]].

Dürer took a large stock of prints with him and wrote in his diary to whom he gave, exchanged or sold them, and for how much.  This provides rare information of the monetary value placed on [[old master print|prints]] at this time.  Unlike paintings, their sale was very rarely documented.&lt;ref&gt;Landau &amp; Parshall:350-54 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;  While providing valuable documentary evidence, Dürer's Netherlandish diary also reveals that the trip was not a profitable one. For example, Dürer offered his last portrait of Maximilian to his daughter, [[Margaret of Habsburg (1480–1530)|Margaret of Austria]], but eventually traded the picture for some white cloth after Margaret disliked the portrait and declined to accept it. During this trip he also met [[Conrad Meit]], [[Bernard van Orley]], [[Jean Prevost]], [[Gerard Horenbout]], [[Jean Mone]], [[Joachim Patinir]] &amp; [[Tommaso Vincidor]], though he did not, it seems, meet [[Quentin Matsys]].&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky:209&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of [[Christian II of Denmark]] Dürer went to [[Brussels]] to paint the King's portrait. There he saw &quot;the things which have been sent to the king from the golden land&quot;—the [[Aztec]] treasure that [[Hernán Cortés]] had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V following the fall of [[Mexico]]. Dürer wrote that this treasure &quot;was much more beautiful to me than miracles. These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100,000 florins&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartrum&quot;/&gt;  Dürer also appears to have been collecting for his own [[cabinet of curiosities]], and he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of [[coral]], some large fish fins, and a wooden weapon from the [[East Indies]].

Having secured his pension, Dürer finally returned home in July 1521, having caught an undetermined illness—perhaps [[malaria]]&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky:&lt;/ref&gt; —which afflicted him for the rest of his life, and greatly reduced his rate of work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartrum&quot;/&gt;
&lt;br clear=left /&gt;

==Final years in Nuremberg (1521–28)==
[[Image:Dürer Salvator Mundi detail.jpg|thumb|left|This detail from ''Salvator Mundi'', an unfinished oil painting on wood, reveals Dürer's highly detailed preparatory drawing.  ''See [[:Image:Albrecht Dürer 100.jpg|full painting]]'']]

On his return to Nuremberg, Dürer worked on a number of grand projects with religious themes, including a [[Crucifixion]] scene and a [[Sacra conversazione|Sacra Conversazione]], though neither was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky:223&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been in part to his declining health, but perhaps also because of the time he gave to the preparation of his theoretical works on [[geometry]] and [[linear perspective|perspective]], the [[body proportions|proportions]] of men and horses, and [[fortification]].

However, one consequence of this shift in emphasis was that during the last years of his life, Dürer produced comparatively little as an artist. In painting, there was only a portrait of [[commons:File:Albrecht Dürer 078.jpg|Hieronymus Holtzschuher]], a [[commons:Image:Albrecht Dürer 061.jpg|''Madonna and Child'' (1526)]], [[commons:Image:Albrecht dürer salvator mundi.JPG|''Salvator Mundi '' (1526)]], and two panels showing [[John the Apostle|St. John]] with [[St. Peter]] in [[commons:Image:Albrecht Dürer 026.jpg|front]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] with [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]] in the [[commons:Image:Albrecht Dürer 027.jpg|background]]. This last great work, [[the Four Apostles]], was given by Dürer to the City of Nuremberg—although he was given 100 guilders in return.&lt;ref name=&quot;Panofsky&quot;/&gt; An inscription relates the figures to the [[four humours]].&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky:235&lt;/ref&gt;

As for engravings, Dürer's work was restricted to portraits and illustrations for his treatise. The portraits include Cardinal-Elector [[Albert of Mainz]]; [[Frederick the Wise]], elector of Saxony; the [[Humanism|humanist]] scholar [[Willibald Pirckheimer]]; [[Philipp Melanchthon]], and [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]]. For those of [[Albert of Mainz|the Cardinal]], Melanchthon, and Dürer's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician Ulrich Starck, Dürer depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach.

Despite complaining of his lack of a formal [[classics|classical education]] Dürer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend [[Willibald Pirckheimer]], whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images.&lt;ref&gt;Corine Schleif (2010), “Albrecht Dürer between Agnes Frey and Willibald Pirckheimer,” ''The Essential Dürer'', ed. Larry Silver and Jeffrey Chipps Smith, Philadelphia, 85-205&lt;/ref&gt; He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars. Dürer succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime. &quot;The Four Books on Measurement&quot; were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on [[mathematics]] in German,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartrum&quot;/&gt; as well as being cited later by [[Galileo]] and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. The other, a work on city fortifications, was published in 1527. &quot;The Four Books on Human Proportion&quot; were published posthumously, shortly after his death in 1528 at the age of fifty-six.&lt;ref name=Mueller /&gt;

Dürer died in Nuremberg at the age of 56, leaving an estate valued at 6,874 florins—a considerable sum. His large house (purchased in 1509 from the heirs of the astronomer [[Bernhard Walther]]), where his workshop was located and where his widow lived until her death in 1539, remains a prominent Nuremberg landmark.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartrum&quot;/&gt; It is now a museum. He is buried in the ''Johannisfriedhof'' cemetery.

===Dürer and the Reformation===
[[Image:Nürnberger Feldschlange.JPG|thumb|right|''The Cannon'', Dürer's largest etching, 1518]]

Dürer was a [[Roman Catholic]], although his writings suggest that he may have been sympathetic to [[Martin Luther]]'s ideas. Dürer wrote of his desire to draw Luther in his diary in 1520: &quot;And God help me that I may go to Dr. Martin Luther; thus I intend to make a portrait of him with great care and engrave him on a copper plate to create a lasting memorial of the Christian man who helped me overcome so many difficulties.&quot; In a letter to [[Nicholas Kratzer]] in 1524 Dürer wrote &quot;because of our Christian faith we have to stand in scorn and danger, for we are reviled and called heretics.&quot; Most tellingly, Pirckheimer wrote in a letter to [[Johann Tscherte]] in 1530: &quot;I confess that in the beginning I believed in Luther, like our Albert of blessed memory...but as anyone can see, the situation has become worse.&quot; Dürer may even have contributed to the [[Nuremberg]] City Council mandating Lutheran sermons and services in March 1525. Notably, Dürer had contacts with various reformers, such as [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Andreas Karlstadt]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]], [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] and [[Cornelius Grapheus]] from whom Dürer received Luther's 'Babylonian Captivity' in 1520.&lt;ref&gt;Price:225-248&lt;/ref&gt;  In spite of all these reasons to believe Dürer was sympathetic to Lutheranism, at least in its early manifestations, he never in any way abandoned the Catholic Church.

Dürer's later works have also been claimed to show [[Protestant]] sympathies. For example, his engraving of ''[[The Last Supper]]'' of 1523 has often been understood to have an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] theme, focussing as it does on Christ espousing the [[Gospel]], as well the inclusion of the [[Eucharist]]ic cup, an expression of Protestant [[Utraquist|utraquism]],&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; although this interpretation has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Price:254&lt;/ref&gt; The delaying of the engraving of [[Philip the Apostle|St Philip]], completed in 1523 but not distributed until 1526, may have been due to Dürer's uneasiness with images of Saints; even if Dürer was not an [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]], in his last years he evaluated and questioned the role of art in religion.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and influence==
[[Image:Dürer - Rhinoceros.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Dürer's Rhinoceros]]'', [[woodcut]], 1515.]]

Dürer exerted a huge influence on the artists of succeeding generations, especially in [[printmaking]], the medium through which his contemporaries mostly experienced his art, as his paintings were predominately in private collections located in only a few cities. His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as [[Raphael]], [[Titian]], and [[Parmigianino]], who entered into collaborations with [[printmaker]]s to distribute their work beyond their local region.

His work in [[engraving]] seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the &quot;[[Little Masters]]&quot;, who attempted few large engravings but continued Dürer's themes in tiny, rather cramped compositions. The early [[Lucas van Leyden]] was the only Northern European [[engraver]] to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the century. The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of Dürer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds ([[Giulio Campagnola]] and [[Christofano Robetta]]), or whole prints ([[Marcantonio Raimondi]] and [[Agostino Veneziano]]). However, Dürer's influence became less dominant after 1515, when Marcantonio perfected his new engraving style, which in turn traveled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also.

In painting, Dürer had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles. His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, and have been blamed for some of the wilder excesses of artists' self-portraiture, especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

Dürer has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been revivals of interest in his works Germany in the ''Dürer Renaissance'' of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in [[German Nationalism]] from 1870 to 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartrum&quot;/&gt;

The crater Dürer on [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] was named in his honor.

===Veneration===

Dürer is honored together with [[Matthias Grünewald]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] on August 5. He is commemorated on the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|calendar]] of the [[Lutheran Church]] with other artists on 6 April.

==Theoretical works==
In all his theoretical works, in order to communicate his theories in the [[German language]], rather than [[Latin]], Dürer used graphic expressions based on a [[vernacular]], craftsmen's language. For example, 'Schneckenlinie' ('snail-line') was his term for a spiral form. Thus Dürer contributed to the expansion in German prose which [[Martin Luther]] had begun with his translation of the [[Luther Bible|Bible]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Panofsky&quot;&gt;Erwin Panofsky, &quot;The Life and Art of Albrecht Dürer&quot;, Princeton, 1945, ISBN 0691003033&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Four Books on Measurement''===
[[Image:AlbrechtDürer01.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Vier Bücher von menschlicher Proportion'' showing the monogram signature of Albrecht Dürer]]

Dürer's work on [[geometry]] is called the ''Four Books on Measurement'' (''Underweysung der Messung mit dem Zirckel und Richtscheyt''). The first book focuses on linear geometry. Dürer's geometric constructions include [[helices]], [[Conchoid (mathematics)|conchoids]] and [[epicycloid]]s. He also draws on [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]], and [[Johannes Werner]]'s 'Libellus super viginti duobus elementis conicis' of 1522. The second book moves onto two dimensional geometry, i.e. the construction of regular [[polygons]]. Here Dürer favours the methods of [[Ptolemy]] over [[Euclid]]. The third book applies these principles of geometry to [[architecture]], [[engineering]] and [[typography]]. In [[architecture]] Dürer cites [[Vitruvius]] but elaborates his own classical designs and [[classical orders|columns]]. In [[typography]], Dürer depicts the geometric construction of the [[Latin alphabet]], relying on [[History of western typography#Classical_revival|Italian precedent]]. However, his construction of the [[Gothic alphabet]] is based upon an entirely different [[modular]] system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second  by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of [[polyhedrons]]. Here Dürer discusses the five [[Platonic solid]]s, as well as seven [[Archimedean]] semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention. In all these, Dürer shows the objects in [[Net (polyhedron)|net]]. Finally, Dürer discusses the [[Doubling the cube|Delian Problem]]  and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through [[linear perspective]]. It was in [[Bologna]] that Dürer was taught (possibly by [[Luca Pacioli]] or [[Bramante]]) the principles of [[linear perspective]], and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of [[Piero della Francesca]]. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Although Dürer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles.  In addition to these geometrical constructions, Dürer discusses in this last book of ''Underweysung der Messung'' an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models, such as the [[camera lucida]] and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

===''Four Books on Human Proportion''===
[[File:Durerhaus-nbg.jpg|thumb|Albrecht Dürer's House in [[Nuremberg]]]]
Dürer's work on [[body proportions|human proportions]] is called the ''Four Books on Human Proportion'' (''Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion'') of 1528. The first book was mainly composed by 1512/13 and completed by 1523, showing five differently constructed types of both male and female figures, all parts of the body expressed in fractions of the total height. Dürer based these constructions on both [[Vitruvius]] and empirical observations of, &quot;two to three hundred living persons,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Panofsky&quot;/&gt;  in his own words. The second book includes eight further types, broken down not into fractions but an [[Leone Battista Alberti|Albertian]] system, which Dürer probably learned from [[Francesco di Giorgio]]'s 'De harmonica mundi totius' of 1525. In the third book, Dürer gives principles by which the proportions of the figures can be modified, including the mathematical simulation of [[convex lens|convex]] and [[concave mirror]]s; here Dürer also deals with human [[physiognomy]]. The fourth book is devoted to the theory of movement.

Appended to the last book, however, is a self contained essay on aesthetics, which Dürer worked on between 1512 and 1528, and it is here that we learn of his theories concerning 'ideal beauty'. Dürer rejected Alberti's concept of an objective beauty, proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety. Nonetheless, Dürer still believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty, even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code. In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ('Nutz'), naïve approval ('Wohlgefallen') and the happy medium ('Mittelmass'). However, unlike Alberti and Leonardo, Dürer was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but as to how an artist can create beautiful images. Between 1512 and the final draft in 1528, Dürer's belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or [[artistic inspiration|inspired]] to a concept of 'selective inward synthesis'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Panofsky&quot;/&gt; In other words, that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things. Dürer's belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that &quot;one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day, or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron, and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another's work at which its author labours with the utmost diligence for a whole year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky:283&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Australian rules football''', officially known as '''Australian football''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/About/tabid/13532/default.aspx#title |title=Australian Football (Official title of the code) |publisher=Afl.com.au |date= |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; also informally known as '''football''', '''Aussie rules''' or (colloquially) as '''footy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.footy.com.au/dags/FAQ1v1-5.html |title=History website |publisher=Footy.com.au |date= |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and in some regions called—erroneously—'''AFL''', after the [[Australian Football League]], the only fully professional Australian rules football league) is a [[sport]] played between two teams of 22 players (18 on the field, and four interchanges) on either an [[Australian rules football playing field|Australian rules football ground]] or a modified [[cricket field]].

&lt;!-- This is NOT a place to put the complete rules of the game ... just a brief summary about what makes the game different/notable for someone who knows nothing of the sport. Rules can be fleshed out in subsequent sections --&gt;
The objective of the game is to score points by passing the ball through the opponent's goal.
The main way to score points is by kicking the [[Football (ball)#Australian rules football|ball]] between the major goal posts.  The team with the higher total score at the end of the match wins&lt;ref&gt;[http://afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/2007_LAWS_OF_THE_GAME.pdf (p. 10)]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless either a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] is declared or a [[Tiebreaker|tie-break]] is used.&lt;ref&gt;In some special situations such as the 1977 VFL Grand Final or other such knock out situations, if the score is tied, either extra time or a rematch the following week is required to get a result.&lt;/ref&gt;

During play, players may position themselves anywhere on the field and use any part of their body to move the ball.  The primary methods are [[kick (football)|kicking]], [[handball (Australian rules football)|handballing]] and running with the ball. There are rules on how the ball can be handled: for example, players running with the ball must intermittently [[running bounce|bounce or touch it on the ground]]. Throwing the ball is not allowed and players must not get caught [[holding the ball]].  Possession of the ball is in dispute at all times except when a ''[[Free kick (Australian rules football)|free kick]]'' is paid.  A distinctive feature of the game is the [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]], where players anywhere on the field who catch a ball from a kick (with specific conditions), are awarded a free kick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/2007_LAWS_OF_THE_GAME.pdf (pg 51)]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Australian rules is a contact sport, in which players can [[tackle (football move)|tackle]] using their hands or use their whole body to [[Shepherding (Australian rules football)|obstruct]] opponents.  Dangerous physical contact (such as [[push in the back|pushing an opponent in the back]]), interference when marking and deliberately slowing the play are discouraged with free kicks, [[50-metre penalty|distance penalties]] or [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]], depending on the seriousness of the infringement.  Frequent physical contests, aerial marking or &quot;[[specky|speckies]]&quot;, fast movement of both players and the ball and high scoring are the game's main attributes.

Details of the [[Origins of Australian rules football|game's origins]] in Australia are obscure and still the subject of much debate.  Australian football became organised in Melbourne in May 1859, when the first [[laws of Australian football|laws of the game]] were published by the [[Melbourne Football Club]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://afl.com.au/Development/AFLExplained/History/tabid/10296/Default.aspx History] Official Website of the Australian Football League&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Wendy Lewis (Australian Writer) | Wendy Lewis]], Simon Balderstone and John Bowan | title=Events That Shaped Australia | page=61 | publisher=New Holland | year=2006 | isbn=9781741104929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian football is a major participation and spectator sport [[Australian rules football in Australia|in Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/ProductsbyReleaseDate/E298CEE24565C911CA256DEF007248FF?OpenDocument |title=4174.0 – Sports Attendance, Australia, April 1999 |publisher=Abs.gov.au |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/4174.02005-06?OpenDocument |title=4174.0 – Sports Attendance, Australia, 2005–06 |publisher=Abs.gov.au |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sport is also played at [[Countries playing Australian rules football|amateur level in several countries]] and in [[variations of Australian rules football|several variations]].

The most prestigious competition is the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), which culminates in the annual [[AFL Grand Final]]; currently the highest attended club championship event in the world. Australian football is governed by the AFL Commission which also runs the AFL competition and the rules are decided by the AFL's Laws of the Game Committee.

==Rules of the game==
{{Main|Laws of Australian football}}

[[Image:Aussie rules kicking.jpg|thumb|150px|Precise field and goal kicking using the oval shaped ball is the most important skill in Australian rules.]]
[[Image:Spectacular mark by irish player against south africa.jpg|thumb|right|Catching (called marking in the game) an oval shaped football in the air is another important skill]]

[[Image:AFL stadium.svg|thumb|left|200px|Typical [[Australian rules football playing field]].]]

Both the ball and the field of play are [[ellipsoid|elliptical]] in shape. No more than 18 players of each team are permitted to be on the field at any time.

Up to four [[Interchange (Australian rules football)|interchange]] (reserve) players may be swapped for those on the field at any time during the game.  In [[Glossary of Australian rules football|Australian rules terminology]], these players wait for substitution &quot;on the bench&quot; — an area with a row of seats on the sideline. Players must interchange through a designated interchange &quot;gate&quot; with strict penalties for too many players from one side on the field.

There is no [[offside (sport)|offside rule]] nor are there set positions in the rules; unlike many other forms of football, players from both teams may disperse across the whole field before the start of play.  However, a typical on-field structure consists of six [[Australian rules football positions#Full Forward|forwards]], six [[Australian rules football positions#Full Back|defenders]] or &quot;backmen&quot; and six [[Australian rules football positions#Midfield|midfielders]], usually comprised of two [[Centre line|wingmen]], one [[Centre line|centre]] and three [[Follower (Australian rules football)|followers]], including a [[Ruckman (Australian rules football position)|ruckman]], [[Follower (Australian rules football)|ruck-rover]] and [[Follower (Australian rules football)|rover]]. Only four players from each team are allowed within {{convert|50|m|yd}} of the centre square before every centre bounce, which occurs at the commencement of each quarter, and to restart the game after a goal is scored. There are also other rules pertaining to allowed player positions during set plays (that is after a mark or free kick) and during kick-ins following the scoring of a behind.

A game consists of four quarters and a timekeeper officiates their duration. In professional Australian football, quarters are 20 minutes plus time on.  Time on refers to clock being stopped when the ball is out of play, meaning that an average quarter could last for 27 to 31 minutes. At the end of each quarter, teams change their scoring end.

Games are officiated by [[umpire (Australian rules football)|umpire]]s. Australian football begins after the first [[siren (noisemaker)|siren]], the [[Umpire (Australian rules football)|umpire]] [[Ball-up|bounces the ball on the ground]] (or throws it into the air if the condition of the ground is poor), and the two [[Ruckman (Australian rules football position)|ruckmen]] (typically the tallest players from each team), battle for the ball in the air on its way back down. This is known as the ''ball-up''. Certain disputes during play may also be settled with a ''ball-up'' from the point of contention. If the ball ever goes out of bounds (beyond the oval boundary line around the edge of the field), a boundary umpire will stand with his back to the infield and return the ball into play with a ''throw-in'', a high backwards toss.

The ball can be propelled in any direction by way of a foot, clenched fist (called a [[handball (Australian rules football)|handball]] or ''handpass'') or open-hand tap but it cannot be thrown under any circumstances. Once a player takes possession of the ball he must dispose of it by either kicking or handballing it. Any other method of disposal is illegal and will result in a free kick to the opposing team. This is usually called &quot;incorrect disposal&quot;, &quot;dropping the ball&quot; or &quot;throwing&quot;. If the ball is not in the possession of one player it can be moved on with any part of the body.

A player may run with the ball but it must be [[Running bounce|bounced or touched on the ground]] at least once every 15&amp;nbsp;metres. Opposition players may [[Shepherding (Australian rules football)|bump]] or [[tackle (football move)|tackle]] the player to obtain the ball and, when tackled, the player must dispose of the ball cleanly or risk being penalised for [[holding the ball]]. The ball carrier may only be tackled between the shoulders and knees. If the opposition player forcefully contacts a player in the back whilst performing a tackle, the opposition player will be penalised for a [[push in the back]]. If the opposition tackles the player with possession below the knees (a ''low tackle'' or a ''trip'') or above the shoulders (a ''high tackle''), the team with possession of the football gets a free kick.

If a player takes possession of the ball that has travelled more than {{convert|15|m|yd}} from another player's kick, by way of a catch, it is claimed as a ''[[mark (Australian football)|mark]]'' and that player is then awarded a  ''free kick'' (meaning that the game stops while he prepares to kick from the point at which he marked). Alternatively, he may choose to &quot;play on&quot;: forfeiting the set shot in the hope of pressing an advantage for his team (rather than allowing the opposition to reposition while he prepares for the free kick). Once a player has chosen to play on, normal play resumes and the player who took the mark is again able to be tackled.

There are different [[kick (football)|styles of kicking]] depending on how the ball is held in the hand. The most common style of kicking seen in today's game, principally because of its superior accuracy, is the [[drop punt]] (the ball is dropped from the hands down, almost to the ground, to be kicked so that the ball rotates in a reverse end over end motion as it travels through the air). Other commonly used kicks are the [[torpedo punt]] (also known as the spiral, barrel, or screw punt; the ball is held at an angle and kicked, which makes the ball spiral in the air, like a [[rugby football|rugby]] throw, resulting in extra distance) and the [[checkside punt]] or &quot;banana&quot;, kicked across the ball on the outside of the foot is used to curve the ball (towards the right if kicked off the right foot) towards targets that are on an angle. There is also the &quot;snap,&quot; which is almost the same as a checkside punt, except that it is kicked off the inside of the foot and curves in the opposite direction. It is also possible to kick the ball so that it bounces along the ground. This is known as a &quot;grubber&quot;. Grubbers can bounce in a straight line, or curve to the left or right.

Apart from free kicks or when the ball is in the possession of an umpire for a ''ball up'' or ''throw in'', the ball is always in dispute and any player from either side can take possession of the ball.

[[Image:AFL-Goalposts.jpg|thumb|200px|The two tall central posts are the goal posts, and the two shorter outer posts are the behind posts.]]

A ''goal'', worth 6 points, is scored when the football is propelled through the goal posts at any height (including above the height of the posts) by way of a kick from the attacking team. It may fly through &quot;on the full&quot; (without touching the ground) or bounce through, but must not have been touched, on the way, by any player from either team. A goal cannot be scored from the foot of an opposition (defending) player.

A ''behind'', worth 1 point, is scored when the ball passes between a goal post and a behind post at any height, or if the ball hits a goal post, or if an any player sends the ball between the goal posts by touching it with any part of the body other than a foot. A behind is also awarded to the attacking team if the ball touches any part of an opposition player, including his foot, before passing between the goal posts. When an opposition player deliberately scores a behind for the attacking team (generally as a last resort, because of the risk of their scoring a goal) this is termed a [[rushed behind]]. Before the start of the 2009 season, there was no additional penalty imposed for rushing a behind, compared to any other behind. However, for the start of the 2009 season&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxsports.com.au/breaking-news/afl-rules-on-deliberate-rushed-behinds/story-e6frf33c-1111118325150 AFL rules on deliberate rushed behinds]&lt;/ref&gt; a new rule was announced&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/all-clear-for-rushed-behind-rule/story-e6frf9jf-1225700531493&lt;/ref&gt; awarding a free kick against any player who deliberately rushes a behind.

The [[Umpire (Australian rules football)|goal umpire]] signals a goal with two hands raised at elbow height, a behind with one hand, and then confirms the signal with the other goal umpire by waving flags above his head.

The team that has scored the most points at the end of play wins the game. If the scores are level on points at the end of play, then the game is a draw; extra time applies only during finals matches in some competitions.

As an example of a score report, Team 1 and Team 2. Team 1's score of 15 goals and 10 behinds equates to 100 points. Team 2's score of 13 goals and 12 behinds equates to a 90 point tally. Team 1 wins the match by a margin of 10 points. Such a result would be written as &quot;''Team 1'' 15.10 (100) defeated ''Team 2'' 13.12 (90)&quot; and is said &quot;Team 1: fifteen, ten, one hundred, defeated Team 2: thirteen, twelve, ninety&quot;.

Clubs, premierships and [[Grand Final]]s have been central to both the structure and culture of the sport since the earliest days.]] --&gt;
The ''football season'', proper, is from March to August (early autumn to late winter in Australia) with finals being held in September.&lt;ref&gt;http://mm.afl.com.au/afl_archive/cp2/c2/webi/article/304261bn.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[tropics]], the game is sometimes played in the [[wet season]] (October to March).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aflnt.com.au/_content/document/00054633-src.pdf (pg 7)]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-season competitions in [[southern Australia]] usually begin in late February.

The AFL is recognised by the [[Australian Sports Commission]] as being the National Sporting Organisation for Australian rules football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ais.org.au/austrules/index.asp |title=Australian Institute of Sport – Australian football |publisher=Ais.org.au |date= |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also seven state/territory-based organisations in Australia, most of which are now either owned by or affiliated to the AFL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/2007_LAWS_OF_THE_GAME.pdf (pg 3)]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these hold annual semi-professional club competitions while the others oversee more than one league. Local semi-professional or amateur organisations and competitions are often affiliated to their state organisations.

The AFL is the ''[[de facto]]'' world governing body for Australian rules football. There are also a number of affiliated organisations governing [[List of Australian rules football leagues outside Australia|amateur clubs and competitions around the world]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/Development/International/tabid/10238/Default.aspx |title=International – Official Website of the Australian Football League |publisher=Afl.com.au |date= |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For almost all Australian rules club competitions the aim is to win the ''Premiership''. The premiership is always decided by a ''finals series''. The teams that occupy the highest positions on the ''ladder'' play off in a &quot;semi-knockout&quot; finals series. From the 1930s the finals series was usually contested by the top four teams (3rd versus 4th ''(First semifinal)''; 1st versus 2nd ''(Second semifinal)''; winner of First versus loser of Second ''(Preliminary final)''; the winner of Second versus winner of Preliminary playing in the [[Grand Final]] for the premiership). Many leagues have adopted a final series involving 5, 6 or 8 teams with a variety of methods used to determine the winner. The [[AFL finals system]] is contested by the top 8 teams.

Unlike many [[association football]] competitions there are usually no separate &quot;league&quot; and &quot;cup&quot; trophies. The team finishing first on the ladder is often referred to as a 'minor premier', although this bears little or no significance. In the AFL, this is the  [[McClelland Trophy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/the_mcclelland_trophy.htm |title=The McClelland Trophy |publisher=Fullpointsfooty.net |date= |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered a [[consolation prize]].  The team that finishes at the bottom of the ladder at the end of the season receives 'the [[wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afl.com.au/Development/AFLExplained/tabid/10294/Default.aspx#wooden |title=AFL Explained – Official Website of the Australian Football League |publisher=Afl.com.au |date= |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is uncommon for [[promotion and relegation]] to occur in Australian football state level competitions although it is common among suburban leagues (such as the [[Eastern Football League (Australia)|Eastern Football League]] and [[VAFA|Victorian Amateur Football Association]] in Melbourne).

==History==
===Origins===

{{See also|Origins of Australian rules football}}

[[Image:Tom wills statue.jpg|thumb|200px|A statue next to the Melbourne Cricket Ground on the approximate site of the 1858 &quot;foot-ball&quot; match between [[Melbourne Grammar]] and [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]]. Tom Wills is depicted umpiring behind two young players contesting the ball. The plaque reads: &quot;Wills did more than any other person – as footballer and umpire, co-writer of the rules and promoter of the game – to develop Australian Football during its first decade.&quot;]]
As early as 1841, there is documented evidence of &quot;foot-ball&quot; being played in metropolitan and country [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] as well as mention of early matches in [[Adelaide]] (1843) and southern [[Van Diemen's Land]] (Tasmania).  While the exact rules being played in these matches are unknown they may have shared similarities and influences.

In 1858 [[English public school football games]] began to be played in Melbourne and surrounding districts.  The earliest known such match was played on 15 June 1858 between [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]] and [[Melbourne Grammar School]] on the [[St Kilda foreshore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skhs.org.au/~SKHSnewsletter1/newsletters/Insert%20%20Footy%20150,%20Aug-Sept%202008.pdf |title=St Kilda Historical Society Aug–Sep 2008. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Melbourne Book – A History of Now.

A letter by [[Tom Wills]] was published in ''[[Bell's Life in Victoria|Bell's Life in Victoria &amp; Sporting Chronicle]]'' on 10 July 1858, calling for a &quot;foot-ball club,&quot; or some other &quot;athletic game,&quot; with a &quot;code of laws&quot; to keep [[cricketer]]s fit during winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Letter from Tom Wills | work=MCG website | url=http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&amp;articleid=37|accessdate=14 July 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060625081726/http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&amp;articleid=37 |archivedate = June 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This letter is regarded by many historians as being a catalyst for the development of a new code of football in 1859 today known as Australian football.

On 31 July, a knock-a-bout match at Yarra Park was played between a &quot;St Kilda [[scratch team]]&quot; and &quot;Melbourne scratch team&quot;.  Trees were used for goal posts and there were no boundaries and the match lasted from 1pm until dark.  There were no rules and fights frequently broke out.  Melbourne being a relatively young city, the majority of the early players were migrants and the media of the time noted that participants of each nationality played the game their own distinctive way: the English played in a fashion that resembled [[rugby football]], the Scottish played recklessly, and the Irish played in a fashion that resembled the Irish sport of [[Gaelic football]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skhs.org.au/~SKHSnewsletter1/newsletters/Insert%20%20Footy%20150,%20Aug-Sept%202008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant milestone in the sport's development was a match between [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]], which began on 7 August 1858 at Richmond Park, was umpired by Wills and Macadam,&lt;ref&gt;The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848–1954) Monday 9 August 1858&lt;/ref&gt; and which also involved Scotch College headmaster [[Thomas H. Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;pg 36. Melbourne FC Since 1858 – An Illustrated History&lt;/ref&gt; A second day of play took place on 21 August&lt;ref&gt;The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848–1954) Tuesday 17 August 1858&lt;/ref&gt; and a third, and final, day on 4 September.&lt;ref name=&quot;piesse&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author=[[Ken Piesse]]| title=The Complete Guide to Australian Football | publisher=Pan Macmillan Australia | year=1995 | isbn=0-330-35712-3 }} p303.&lt;/ref&gt; While the full rules that were used is unknown, some details of the match survived.  It was played with a round ball, the distance between the goals was approximately half a mile (approximately four times longer than the modern [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] playing surface), there were 40 players per side and one goal each side was scored with the game being declared a draw.  The two schools have competed annually ever since for the [[Cordner-Eggleston Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotch.vic.edu.au/Sport/Arules/coregg/cordegg.htm |title=Scotch College – Cordner-Eggleston Cup |publisher=Scotch.vic.edu.au |date=17 August 2000 |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First rules===
{{See also|History of Australian rules football in Victoria (1859-1900)}}
The Melbourne Football Club rules of 1859 are the oldest surviving set of laws for Australian football.  The [[Melbourne rules#Melbourne Rules of 1859|ten simple rules]] were drawn up on 17 May in a meeting was chaired by Wills and in attendance were journalists [[William Hammersley|W. J. Hammersley]] and [[J. B. Thompson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;piesse&quot; /&gt;  Accounts of the people directly involved differ.  Some sources claim that Thomas H. Smith,&lt;ref name=&quot;SmithAccount&quot;&gt;Thomas Smith himself made this claim in response to an article about the history of Melbourne FC in The Australasian published 26 February 1876 (from Melbourne FC Since 1858 – An Illustrated History pg 36).  Smith's personal account mentions Thompson arriving after the decision to form the club&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Bruce&lt;ref name=&quot;SmithAccount&quot;/&gt; and or [[H. C. A. Harrison]]&lt;ref&gt;Harrison's involvement in the early stages is believed by many to be due to him being perceived as the &quot;father of the game&quot; in later decades and subsequent erroneous reporting&lt;/ref&gt; were also present.  The meeting was held at the Parade Hotel, [[East Melbourne]] hosted by owner and Melbourne Cricket Club member Jerry Bryant.  The publican was a friend of Tom Wills with a personal interest in introducing football to Melbourne's schools.  Bryant had played a role in organising early football matches at the nearby Richmond Park and his son was one of the first players.&lt;ref&gt;pg 20–10.  Melbourne FC Since 1858 – An Illustrated History.  Goeff Slattery Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;  The rules were signed by Tom Wills, William Hammersley, J. Sewell, J. B. Thompson, Alex Bruce, T. Butterworth and Thomas H. Smith.  Importantly, the rules were widely publicised and distributed.

===Early competition in Victoria===
{{See also|List of Australian rules football clubs by date of establishment}}
[[Image:Australianfootball1866.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A game at the [[Yarra Park|Richmond Paddock]] in the 1860s. A pavilion at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] is on the left in the background. (A [[wood engraving]] made by Robert Bruce on 27 July 1866.)]]

In 1859 several new football clubs formed including the [[Castlemaine Football Club]], [[Geelong Football Club]] (which Wills directly helped to form) and the [[Melbourne University Football Club]].   While many one-off matches are recorded to have taken place between several early teams from Melbourne's suburbs and country Victoria (such as the [[Ballarat]] and Geelong competitions), in the early days many had not yet formed clubs for regular competition.

The first ever trophy for Australian Football, the 1861 [[Challenge Cup (Australia)|Challenge Cup]], was won in 1862 under Melbourne's rules by University over Melbourne.  The competition continued into the 1860s with the addition of other teams from Melbourne's suburbs.  Two further competitions, the South Yarra Challenge Cup (which had evolved from the Caledonian Games) and &quot;Second Twenties&quot; were held in the 1860s and 1870s.

Some rival rules eventually gave way to an acceptance of the Melbourne rules.  In 1860, the Melbourne Football Club redrafted its rules following the input of several other clubs.  The requirement to bounce the ball while running was introduced in a significant redraft of the Melbourne rules in 1866 by H.C.A. Harrison and his rules committee to satisfy the Geelong Football Club's own set of very different rules.&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Hibbins Sport and Racing in Colonial Melbourne: The Cousin and Me – Colden Harrison, Tom Wills and William Hammersley Lynedoch 2007 chs 8, 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Behind posts were introduced at this time are also believed to have come directly from the Geelong rules.  The new rules became known as the Victorian rules, which became more widely adopted.  In 1869, a 100-minute time limit was introduced to the game for the first time.  Previous to this, winners were decided in a number of ways, but most commonly the first side to kick two goals.

The relationship with cricket primarily came out of co-existence and many of football's founders were cricketers.  As a result, the sport shares some terminology (i.e. &quot;umpires&quot; and &quot;boundary&quot;).  However cricket authorities did not initially allow football to be played on their grounds and in the early years football was played primarily in parks.  The first football match played at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) was not until 1876.  Cricket authorities soon saw the opportunity to capitalise on the rapid growth of Australian Football, however, and soon most grounds in Victoria were expanded to accommodate the dual purpose, a situation that continues to this day.

Football matches between 1859 and 1899 were played in a 20-per-side format.

===Spread to other colonies===

{{Main|Australian rules football in Australia}}

Gradually the game – known at first as &quot;Melbourne rules&quot; became &quot;Victorian rules&quot; and then &quot;Australian rules&quot; or &quot;Australasian rules&quot; following its spread from Victoria into other Australasian colonies, beginning with [[Australian rules football in South Australia|South Australia]] (Although there is conjecture that the game co-developed in South Australia, with games recorded as far back as 1843),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanfl.com.au/the_sanfl/history_of_the_sanfl/ SANFL – History of the SANFL]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian rules football in Tasmania|Tasmania]] (1864), [[Australian rules football in Queensland|Queensland]] (1866), and [[Australian rules football in New Zealand|New Zealand]] (1871). In 1877, the sport's first [[sports governing body|governing bodies]], the [[SANFL|South Australian Football Association]] and the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] were formed on 30 April and 17 May respectively. The game began to be played in [[Australian rules football in New South Wales|New South Wales]] in 1877, in [[Australian rules football in Western Australia|Western Australia]] in 1881 (During the [[Australian rules football in Western Australia|1880s]], young men sent to school in Adelaide brought the game home when they had finished their education - more came from the eastern states later in the WA gold rush) and the [[Australian rules football in the Australian Capital Territory|Australian Capital Territory]] in 1911. By 1916, the game was first played in the [[Australian rules football in the Northern Territory|Northern Territory]], establishing a permanent presence in all [[Australian states and territories|Australian states and mainland territories]].

The [[South Australian National Football League]] (SANFL), formerly named the South Australian Football Association, and the [[West Australian Football League]] (WAFL), formerly named the Western Australian Football Association, were strong, separate competitions by the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanfl.com.au/the_sanfl/history_of_the_sanfl/&lt;/ref&gt; However, late in the century the code began to decline in New South Wales and Queensland largely due to [[Australian regional rivalries|interstate rivalries]] and the lack of strong local governing bodies.  In the case of Sydney, denial of access to grounds and the loss of professional players to other football codes directly inhibited to the game's growth.

The first [[interstate matches in Australian rules football|intercolonial match]] had been played between Victoria and South Australia on 2 August 1879.

=== Emergence of the VFL ===
In 1896, delegates from the stronger and wealthier VFA clubs — Carlton, Collingwood, Essendon, Fitzroy, Geelong, Melbourne and South Melbourne — met to form a breakaway competition and in 1897, the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL), was born as an eight-team competition. Popularity of the VFL grew rapidly and by 1925 with 12 teams, had become the most prominent league in the game and would dominate so many aspects of the sport from that point on.{{clr}}

=== Effects of the two world wars ===

{{See|The VFL during the World Wars|VFL/AFL players who died in active service}}

Both World War I and World War II had a devastating effect on the sport of Australian football and on Australian sport in general. While scratch matches were played by Australian &quot;[[digger (soldier)|diggers]]&quot; in remote locations around the world, the game lost many of its great players to wartime service.  Some competitions never fully recovered.  Between 1914 and 1915 talks were held for a proposed amalgamation with [[rugby league]], the predominant code of football in New South Wales and Queensland was considered and trialled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In Queensland, the state league went into recess for the duration of the war.  VFL club University left the league and went into recess due to severe casualties.  The WAFL lost two clubs and the SANFL was suspended for one year in 1916 due to heavy club losses.  [[The ANZAC Day clash]] is one example of how the war continues to be remembered in the football community.

===Interstate football and the Australian National Football Council===
{{See|Interstate matches in Australian rules football}}
The Australian National Football Council's primary role was to govern the game at national level to facilitate interstate representative and club competition.

The ANFC ran the [[Championship of Australia]], the first national club competition, which first ran in 1888 and saw clubs from different states compete on an even playing field. During this time, the [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] won a record four national club championships. Although clubs from other states were at times invited, the final was almost always between the premiers from the two strongest state competitions of the time, – South Australia and Victoria – and the majority of matches were played in Adelaide at the request of the [[South Australian National Football League|SAFA/SAFL]]. By the 1960s, as VFL clubs increasingly recruited the best players from other states, they began to dominate the competition and the last match was played in 1976, with [[North Adelaide Football Club|North Adelaide]] being the last non-Victorian winner in 1972. Between 1977 and 1987, the Australian Football Council (AFC) in conjunction with the VFL ran a [[Australian Football League pre-season competition|night series]], which invited clubs and representative sides from around the country to participate in the &quot;National Football League&quot; for the Wills Cup, however Victorian sides still dominated.

With the lack of international competition, representative matches between state teams were regarded with great importance. Originating from the early intercolonial matches, these tests continued well after [[Federation of Australia]] in 1901 and the Australian Football Council co-ordinated regular interstate carnivals. In 1908, a [[1908 Melbourne Carnival|Jubilee Australasian Football Carnival]] was held to celebrate 50 years of Australian rules football. The carnival included teams representing [[Australian rules football in Victoria|Victoria]], [[Australian rules football in South Australia|South Australia]], [[Australian rules football in Queensland|Queensland]], [[Australian rules football in New South Wales|New South Wales]], [[Australian rules football in Tasmania|Tasmania]], [[Australian rules football in Western Australia|Western Australia]] and [[Australian rules football in New Zealand|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/a_false_dawn.htm |title=A False Dawn |publisher=Fullpointsfooty.net |date=20 August 1908 |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, due primarily to the VFL recruiting the best players, Victoria dominated interstate matches for three quarters of a century. Representative football was kept alive longer than the national club competition with the introduction of [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football#State of Origin|State of origin]] rules in 1977. The new rules mean that rather than representing the state of their adopted club, players would return to play for the state they were first recruited in. This instantly broke Victoria's stranglehold over state titles and Western Australia and South Australia began to win many of their games against Victoria. Both New South Wales and Tasmania scored surprise victories at home against Victoria in 1990.

===Towards a national club competition===

The AFL is the [[List of sports attendance figures#Top 10 in average attendance|most attended]] national competition in Australia and the only fully professional league for Australian football in the world.]]
In 1978, the term [[Barassi Line]] was used to describe the football dichotomy that had emerged in Australia over three quarters of a century and also the first suggestion of regular interstate club competition or national league.&lt;ref&gt;Referenced in {{Cite book| last = Hutchinson | first = Garrie | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1983 | title = The Great Australian Book of Football Stories | publisher = Currey O'Neil | location = Melbourne | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1980, the way the game was played had changed dramatically, with the phasing out of many of the game's kicking styles, changing rules and the influence of the handballing game and television.&lt;ref&gt;WICKS, B. M. Whatever Happened to Australian Rules? Hobart, Tasmania, Libra Books. 1980, First Edition. (ISBN 0-909619-06-9)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, in a move that heralded big changes within the sport, one of the original VFL clubs, South Melbourne, relocated to the [[rugby league]] stronghold of Sydney and became known as the [[Sydney Swans]] as it was on verge of going out of business. In the late 1980s, due to the poor financial standing of many of the Victorian clubs, the VFL led to a more national competition; two more non-Victorian clubs, the [[West Coast Eagles]] and the [[Brisbane Bears Football Club|Brisbane Bears]] began playing in 1987.   In their early years, the Sydney and Brisbane clubs continued to struggle both on and off-field before an eventual [[bailout]] by the league, which granted significant draft concessions and financial aid to keep them competitive. Each club was required to pay a licence fee which allowed the Victorian based clubs to survive.

The league changed its name to the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) following the 1989 season. In 1991, it gained its first South Australian team, [[Adelaide Crows|Adelaide]], which paid five million dollars to enter the AFL. During the next five years, two more non-Victorian teams, [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] and [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]], joined the league. From 2011 - 2012 two new teams will be added to the competition. The Gold Coast Suns and the Greater Western Sydney Giants, with the former joining the competition in 2011 and the latter to compete in the 2012 fixture. The AFL, currently with 18 member clubs, 17 of which will compete in the 2011 season, is the sport's elite competition and the most powerful body and continues to seek further opportunities to expand into new markets.

Following the emergence of the Australian Football League, the SANFL, WAFL and other state leagues rapidly declined to a secondary status. Apart from these there are many semi-professional and amateur leagues around Australia, where they play a very important role in the community, and particularly so in rural areas. The VFA, still in existence a century after the original schism, merged with the former VFL reserves competition in 1998. The new entity adopted the VFL name and remained a primarily state based competition.

State of origin games also declined in importance, especially after an increasing number of withdrawals by AFL players.  The AFL turned its focus for representation to an annual [[International Rules Series]] against Ireland in 1998 before abolishing State of Origin in 1999.  The second-tier state and territorial leagues still contest interstate representative matches.

Although [[Tasmanian AFL Bid]] has been ongoing, rather than pursue a national competition, the AFL's focus has become gaining marketshare in lucrative and broadcasting rights in the more populous Australian states and has advanced plans to create football franchises on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] ([[Gold Coast Football Club]]) and in [[Greater Western Sydney]] ([[Greater Western Sydney Football Club]]).  The AFL regularly schedules pre-season exhibition matches in all Australian states and territories as part of the [[Regional Challenge]].

{{Main|Australian rules football around the world}}
Australian rules football is played at an amateur level in [[Countries playing Australian rules football|various countries]] around the world. Over 30 countries are home to clubs or leagues who play regularly, with around 20 that have either affiliation or working agreements with the AFL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/GameDevelopment/International/tabid/285/Default.aspx AFL International Development]&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been several [[List of overseas-born AFL players|players in the VFL/AFL who were born outside Australia]] and since 1982, an increasing number of players have been recruited from outside Australia through initiatives such as the [[Irish experiment]] and more recently, international scholarship programs.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the game spread with the [[Australian Diaspora]] to areas such as New Zealand and South Africa; however this growth went into rapid decline following World War I. After World War II, the sport experienced a small amount of growth in the Pacific region, particularly in [[Australian rules football in Nauru|Nauru]], [[Australian rules football in Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] and later [[Australian rules football in New Zealand|New Zealand]].

Most of the current amateur clubs and leagues in existence have developed since the 1980s, when leagues began to be established in [[Australian rules football in the Americas|North America]], [[Australian rules football in Europe|Europe]] and [[Australian rules football in Asia|Asia]]. As the size of the Australian diaspora has increased, so has the number of clubs outside Australia.  This expansion has been further [[List of overseas-born AFL players|aided by multiculturalism]] and assisted by [[Australian rules football exhibition matches|exhibition matches]] as well as exposure generated through [[players who have converted from one football code to another|players who have converted to and from other football codes]]. In Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States there are many thousands of players.

The AFL became the de facto governing body when it pushed for the closure of the [[International Australian Football Council]] in 2002.  The [[Australian Football International Cup]] is currently the highest level of senior international competition.

===International Rules Football===
{{Main|International rules football}}
Since 1967 there have been many matches between Australian rules football teams (mainly from Australia) and [[Gaelic football]] teams (mainly from Ireland), under various sets of hybrid, compromise rules known as [[International rules football]]. In 1984, the first official representative matches of International Rules were played, and these were played annually each October between the AFL and the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], also known as the GAA, between 1998 and 2006. These were part of the official [[International Rules Series]], which attracted large crowds and media interest in Ireland and Australia. In 2007 the international rules series was abandoned because of the aggression and the severity of the Australian team in the previous year, but in 2008, under new rules to protect the player with the ball, it resumed in Australia.

{{Main|Australian rules football culture}}
{{See also|Australian rules football in Australia|Barassi Line}}
Australian football is a sport rich in tradition and [[Australian culture|Australian cultural]] references, especially surrounding the rituals of gameday for players, officials and supporters.

Australian football has attracted more overall interest among Australians (as measured by the Sweeney Sports report) than any other football code, and, when compared with all sports throughout the nation, has consistently ranked first in the winter reports, and most recently third behind [[cricket]] and [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] in summer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweeneyresearch.com.au/newsPDF/news_pdf_16.pdf Media Release], Sweeney Sport report for 2006–07&lt;br /&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/05/22/1053196670542.html |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=22 May 2003|title=If you can kick it, Australia will watch it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a total of 615,549 registered participants played Australian football in Australia.&lt;ref name = &quot;danxpg&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/we-love-aussie-rules/2007/06/19/1182019117471.html |title=More chase Sherrin than before |publisher=Realfooty.com.au |date= |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation increased 7.84% between 2005–06.&lt;ref name = &quot;danxpg&quot;/&gt; The [[Australian Sports Commission]] statistics show a 42% increase in the total number of participants over the 4 year period between 2001–2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausport.gov.au/scorsresearch/ERASS2005/ERASS2005_findings.pdf Participation in Exercise, Recreation and Sport Survey 2005 Annual Report]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian football is played in more than 30 countries around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; In 2004, there were a total of over 25,000 participants outside of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Brett |url=http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php?story=20050301074107992 |title=World Footy Census |publisher=Worldfootynews.com |date= |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has grown to about 35,000 people in 32 countries playing in structured competitions outside of Australia&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, R.

Many related games have emerged from football, mainly with variations of contact to encourage greater participation. These include [[Kick-to-kick]] (and its variants such as 'End to End Footy' and 'Markers Up'), [[Auskick]], [[Rec Footy]], [[Women's Australian rules football]], [[9-a-side Footy]], [[Masters Australian Football]], handball and longest-kick competitions. Players outside of Australia sometimes engage in related games on the available fields, like [[Metro Footy]] (played on gridiron fields) and [[Samoa Rules]] (played on rugby fields).

==Australian Football Hall of Fame==
{{Main|Australian Football Hall of Fame}}
For the centenary of the VFL/AFL in 1996, the Australian Football Hall of Fame was established. In that year 136 identities were inducted, including 100 players, 10 coaches, 10 umpires, 10 administrators and six media representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=2005,15,8 |url=http://getaway.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=50720 |title=AFL Hall of Fame and Sensation |publisher=Getaway.ninemsn.com.au |date= |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The selections have caused some controversy, mainly because of the predominance of VFL players at the expense of those who played in other leagues in the years before there was a national competition.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The elite ''Legend'' status was bestowed on 12 members of the Hall of Fame in 1996: [[Ron Barassi]], [[Haydn Bunton Senior]], [[Roy Cazaly]], [[John Coleman (Australian footballer)|John Coleman]], [[Jack Dyer]], [[Polly Farmer]], [[Leigh Matthews]], [[John Nicholls (footballer)|John Nicholls]], [[Bob Pratt]], [[Dick Reynolds]], [[Bob Skilton]] and [[Ted Whitten]] (see above list for further details).

The following ten members have been promoted to the status of &quot;Legend&quot; since 1996: [[Ian Stewart (Australian rules footballer)|Ian Stewart]] (1997), [[Gordon Coventry]] (1998), [[Peter Hudson]] (1999), [[Kevin Bartlett (Australian rules footballer)|Kevin Bartlett]] (2000), [[Barrie Robran]] (2001), [[Bill Hutchison (footballer)|Bill Hutchison]] (2003), [[Jock McHale]] (2005), [[Darrel Baldock]] (2006), [[Norm Smith]] (2007), [[Alex Jesaulenko]] (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/Season2007/Awards/HallofFame/Legends/tabid/855/Default.aspx |title=Legends – Official Website of the Australian Football League |publisher=Afl.com.au |date= |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kevin Murray (Australian rules footballer)|Kevin Murray]] (2010).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/208/newsid/95647/default.aspx Murray a Legend, six inducted – AFL.com.au]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aon Corporation''' ({{nyse|AON}}) is a provider of [[risk management]] services, [[insurance]] and [[reinsurance]] [[insurance broker|brokerage]], human capital and management consulting, and specialty insurance underwriting. It is based in the [[Aon Center (Chicago)|Aon Center]] in [[Chicago Loop]] Illinois, United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.aon.com/about-aon/contact-us.jsp Contact Us].&quot; ''[[AON Corporation]]''.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2008}}
W. Clement Stone's mother bought a small Detroit insurance agency, and in 1918 brought her son into the business. Young Stone sold low-cost, low-benefit accident insurance, underwriting and issuing policies on-site. The next year he founded his own agency, the '''Combined Registry Co.'''

As the [[Great Depression]] began, Stone reduced his workforce and improved training. Forced by his son's respiratory illness to winter in the South, Stone moved to Arkansas and Texas. In 1939 he bought [[American Casualty Insurance Co.]] of Dallas, Texas. It was consolidated with other purchases as the Combined Insurance Co. of America in 1947. The company continued through the 1950s and 1960s, continuing to sell health and accident policies. In the 1970s Combined expanded overseas despite being hit hard by the recession.

In 1982, after 10 years of stagnation under Clement Stone Jr., the elder Stone, then 79, resumed control until the completion of a [[merger]] with [[Ryan Insurance Co.]] allowed him to transfer control to [[Patrick Ryan]]. Ryan, the son of a Ford dealer in Wisconsin, had started his company as an auto credit insurer in 1964. In 1976, the company bought the insurance brokerage units of the [[Esmark]] conglomerate. Ryan focused on insurance brokering and added more upscale insurance products. He also trimmed staff and took other cost-cutting measures, and in 1987 he changed Combined's name to '''Aon'''. In 1992, he bought Dutch insurance broker Hudig-Langeveldt. In 1995, the company sold its remaining direct life insurance holdings to focus on consulting. The following year it began offering hostile takeover insurance policies to small and midsized companies.

Aon built a global presence through purchases. In 1997 it bought The Minet Group, as well as insurance brokerage Alexander &amp; Alexander Services, Inc. in a deal that made Aon (temporarily) the largest insurance broker worldwide. The firm made no U.S. buys in 1998, but doubled its employee base with purchases including Spain's largest retail insurance broker, Gil y Carvajal, and the formation of Aon Korea, the first non-Korean firm of its kind{{clarify|date=June 2010}} to be licensed there.

Responding to industry demands, Aon announced its new fee disclosure policy in 1999, and the company reorganized to focus on buying personal line insurance firms and to integrate its acquisitions. That year it bought Nikols Sedgwick Group, an Italian insurance firm, and formed RiskAttack (with [[Zurich Financial Services|Zurich U.S.]]), a risk analysis and financial management concern aimed at technology companies. The cost of integrating its numerous purchases, however, hammered profits in 1999.

Despite its troubles, in 2000 Aon bought Reliance Group's accident and health insurance business, as well as Actuarial Sciences Associates, a compensation and employee benefits consulting company. Later in that year, however, the company decided to cut 6% of its workforce as part of a restructuring effort. In 2003, the company saw revenues increase primarily because of rate hikes in the insurance industry (meaning higher commissions for Aon). Also that year Endurance Specialty, a Bermuda-based underwriting operation that Aon helped to establish in November 2001 along with other investors, went public. The next year Aon sold most of its holdings in Endurance.

===September 11 Attack===
Its New York offices were on the 92nd and 98th–105th floors of the [[Two World Trade Center tenants|south tower]] of the [[World Trade Center]] at the time of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attack]]. When the North Tower was struck at 8:46 a.m., many executives began evacuating their employees from the upper floors of the South Tower. The evacuation of Aon Corp's offices, ordered by Eric Eisenberg, was carried out swiftly as 924 of the 1,100 Aon employees present at the time managed to evacuate the building before [[United Airlines Flight 175]] struck the building twenty stories below them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/update-on-dead-missing-at-world-trade-center-firms&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unfortunately, many were influenced to stay by security guards and security announcements, or just didn't make it out in time. As a result, 176 employees of Aon Corp. were killed in the attacks, including Eisenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.investmentnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070911/REG/70911011 |title=Industry honors fallen on 9/11 anniversary |publisher=InvestmentNews |author= Siegel, Aaron |date=September 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spitzer Investigation===
In 2004–2005 Aon, along with other brokers including [[AIG]], [[Marsh &amp; McLennan]] and [[Willis Group Holdings|Willis]], fell under regulatory investigation under [[New York Attorney General]] [[Eliot Spitzer]] and other [[State attorney general|state attorneys general]]. At issue was the practice of insurance companies' payments to brokers (known as contingent commissions). The payments were thought to bring a conflict of interest, swaying broker decisions on behalf of carriers, rather than customers. In the spring of 2005, without acknowledging any wrongdoing, Aon agreed to a $190 million [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] payable over 30 months.

===UK regulatory breach===
In January 2009 Aon was fined £5.25m in the UK after it made more than $7m worth of &quot;suspicious&quot; payments to overseas firms and individuals. The UK's Financial Services Authority stated that the fine related to the company's inadequate bribery and corruption controls, claiming that Aon between January 14, 2005 and September 30, 2007 had failed properly to assess the risks involved in its dealings with overseas firms and individuals.  The Authority did not find that any money had actually made its way to illegal organisations. Aon qualified for a 30% discount on the fine as a result of its co-operation with the investigation.  Aon said its conduct was not deliberate, adding it had since &quot;significantly strengthened and enhanced its controls around the usage of third parties&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ifaonline.co.uk/public/showPage.html?page=ifa2006_articleimport&amp;tempPageName=833667 |title=Aon hit with record FSA fine|publisher=Ifaonline.co.uk|date=January 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchester United sponsorship===
On June 3, 2009, it was reported that Aon had signed a four year shirt sponsorship deal with English [[association football|football]] giant [[Manchester United]]. On June 1, 2010, Aon replaced troubled American insurance company [[AIG]] as the principal sponsor of the club. The Aon logo is prominently displayed on the front of the club's new shirts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ManUtd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=652383&amp;sec=england&amp;&amp;cc=5901|title=Man Utd announce new shirt deal with Aon|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|accessdate=June 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deal is said to be worth £80 million over four years, replacing United's deal with AIG as the most lucrative shirt deal in history at the time, but it was later equalled when [[Standard Chartered Bank]] agreed a deal with [[Liverpool FC]] to pay £20 million a year over the same period.&lt;ref name=&quot;ManUtd&quot; /&gt;

===British Touring Car Championship===
Aon has sponsored the [[British Touring Car Championship]] team run by [[Arena Motorsport]] since 2009. [[Arena Motorsport]] runs 2 Ford Focus STs under the ''Team Aon'' banner. Its drivers are [[Tom Chilton]] and [[Tom Onslow-Cole]], with Chilton's father Grahame being Aon's vice-chairman, who is a &quot;huge fan&quot; of motor racing. His other son [[Max Chilton]] races in the [[GP2 Series]] with backing from Aon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Alban Berg Bueste Schiefling 01.jpg|thumb|right|Alban Berg]]

'''Alban Maria Johannes Berg''' (February 9, 1885 – December 24, 1935) was an [[Austria]]n [[composer]]. He was a member of the [[Second Viennese School]] with [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Anton Webern]], and produced compositions that combined [[Gustav Mahler|Mahlerian]] [[Romantic music|Romanticism]] with a personal adaptation of Schoenberg's [[twelve-tone technique]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Berg was born in [[Vienna]], the third of four children of Johanna and Conrad Berg. His family lived comfortably until the death of his father in 1900.

===Education===
He was more interested in [[literature]] than [[music]] as a child and did not begin to compose until he was fifteen, when he started to teach himself music. In late February or early March 1902 he fathered a child with Marie Scheuchl, a servant girl in the Berg family household. His daughter, Albine, was born on December 4, 1902.

Berg had little formal music education before he became a student of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] in October 1904. With Schoenberg he studied [[counterpoint]], [[music theory]], and [[harmony]].&lt;ref&gt;Monzo, Joe. [http://www.sonic-arts.org/monzo/schoenberg/harm/monzo-intro.htm &quot;Schoenberg's Harmonielehre&quot;, ''Sonic Arts'']. 1999 June 5.{{Verify credibility|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1906, he was studying music full-time; by 1907, he began [[musical composition|composition]] lessons. His student compositions included five drafts for [[piano sonata]]s. He also wrote songs, including his ''[[Seven Early Songs (Berg)|Seven Early Songs]]'' (''Sieben Frühe Lieder''), three of which were Berg's first publicly performed work in a concert that featured the music of Schoenberg's pupils in Vienna that year. The early sonata sketches eventually culminated in Berg's [[Piano sonata (Berg)|Piano Sonata]], [[opus number|Op]]. 1 (1907–1908); it is one of the most formidable &quot;first&quot; works ever written.&lt;ref&gt;Lauder (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

Berg studied with Schoenberg for six years until 1911. Berg admired him as a composer and mentor, and they remained close lifelong friends. 

Among Schoenberg's teaching was the idea that the unity of a musical composition depends upon all its aspects being derived from a single basic idea; this idea was later known as ''developing variation''. Berg passed this on to his students, one of whom, [[Theodor Adorno]], stated: &quot;The main principle he conveyed was that of variation: everything was supposed to develop out of something else and yet be intrinsically different&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The Piano Sonata is an example—the whole composition is derived from the work's opening [[quartal and quintal harmony|quartal]] gesture and its opening phrase.

===Innovation===
Berg was a part of Vienna's cultural elite during the heady ''[[fin de siècle]]'' period. His circle included the musicians [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]] and [[Franz Schreker]], the painter [[Gustav Klimt]], the writer and satirist [[Karl Kraus]], the architect [[Adolf Loos]], and the poet [[Peter Altenberg]]. In 1906, Berg met the singer Helene Nahowski, daughter of a wealthy family (said by some to be in fact the illegitimate daughter of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] from his liaison with Anna Nahowski);&lt;ref&gt;Georg Markus, ''Der Kaiser Franz Joseph I.: Bilder und Dokumente''; Anna Nahowski and Friedrich Saathen, ''Anna Nahowski und Kaiser Franz Joseph : Aufzeichnungen / erstmalig herausgegeben und kommentiert von Friedrich Saathen'', Böhlau, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the outward hostility of her family, the two were married on May 3, 1911.

In 1913, two of Berg's ''Five Songs on Picture Postcard Texts by Peter Altenberg'' (1912) were premièred in Vienna, [[conducting|conducted]] by Schoenberg. Settings of aphoristic poetic utterances, the songs are accompanied by a very large orchestra. The performance caused a riot, and had to be halted. This was a crippling blow to Berg's self-confidence: he effectively withdrew the work, which is surely one of the most extraordinarily innovative and assured first orchestral compositions in the literature, and it was not performed in full until 1952. The full score remained unpublished until 1966. 

From 1915 to 1918, Berg served in the [[Austria–Hungary|Austrian]] Army and during a period of leave in 1917 he accelerated work on his first [[opera]], ''[[Wozzeck]]''. After the end of [[World War I]], he settled again in Vienna where he taught private pupils. He also helped Schoenberg run his [[Society for Private Musical Performances]], which sought to create the ideal environment for the exploration and appreciation of unfamiliar new music by means of open rehearsals, repeat performances, and the exclusion of professional critics.

===Success of ''Wozzeck''===
Three excerpts from ''Wozzeck'' were performed in 1924, and this brought Berg his first public success. The opera, which Berg completed in 1922, was first performed on December 14, 1925, when [[Erich Kleiber]] directed the first performance in [[Berlin]]. Today ''Wozzeck'' is seen as one of the century's most important works. Berg completed the orchestration of only the first two acts of his later three-act opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', before he died. The first two acts were successfully premièred in Zürich in 1937, but for personal reasons Helene Berg subsequently imposed a ban on any attempt to &quot;complete&quot; the final act, which Berg had in fact completed in particell format. An orchestration was therefore commissioned in secret from [[Friedrich Cerha]] and premièred in Paris (under [[Pierre Boulez]]) only in 1979, soon after Helene Berg's own death. The complete opera has rapidly entered the repertoire as one of the landmarks of contemporary music and, like Wozzeck, remains a consistent audience draw.

Berg had interrupted the orchestration of ''Lulu'' because of an unexpected (and financially much-needed) commission from the Russian/American violinist Louis Krasner for a [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]] (1935). This profoundly elegiac work, composed at unaccustomed speed and posthumously premièred, has become Berg's best-known and beloved composition. Like much of his mature work, it employs an idiosyncratic adaptation of Schoenberg's [[twelve tone technique]] that enables the composer to produce passages openly evoking tonality, including quotations from historical tonal music, such as a [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] chorale and a [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthian]] folk song. The Violin Concerto was dedicated &quot;to the memory of an Angel,&quot; Manon, the deceased daughter of architect [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Alma Mahler]].

Other well-known Berg compositions include the ''[[Lyric Suite]]'' (1926), which was later shown to employ elaborate cyphers to document a secret love affair; the extraordinarily elaborate post-Mahlerian Three Pieces for Orchestra (completed in 1915 but not performed until after ''Wozzeck''); and the ''[[Kammerkonzert|Chamber Concerto]]'' (''Kammerkonzert'') (1923–25) for [[violin]], [[piano]] and 13 [[Woodwind instrument|wind]] instruments: this latter is written so conscientiously that Pierre Boulez has called it &quot;Berg's strictest composition&quot; and it, too, is permeated by cyphers and posthumously disclosed hidden programs.

===Death===
Berg died in Vienna, on Christmas Eve 1935, from [[blood poisoning]] apparently caused by an insect-sting induced [[carbuncle]] on his back.  He had been reduced to near-poverty and it is said that to save money his wife carried out an ill-advised operation using a pair of scissors.  Later he was rushed to hospital, although too late to prevent the onset of blood poisoning. He was 50 years old.

===Legacy===
Berg is remembered as one of the most important composers of the Twentieth Century and to date is the most widely performed opera composer among the [[Second Viennese School]].&lt;ref&gt;Jarman, Grove&lt;/ref&gt;  He is considered to have brought more human values to the twelve-tone system, his works seen as more emotional than Schoenberg's.&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Book of 20th Century Music, pg.20, by David Ewen, Prentice-Hall Inc. 1963&lt;/ref&gt;Critically he is seen to have preserved the Viennese tradition in his music. &lt;ref&gt;The Grove Encyclopedia of Music and Musicians, pg.638, St. Martin's Press, Inc. 1961&lt;/ref&gt;His popularity has been more easily secured than many other Modernists since he plausibly combined both Romantic and Expressionist idioms.  Though Berg's Romanticism at one time seemed a drawback for some more Modernist composers, the Berg scholar Douglas Jarman writes in the [[New Grove]]: &quot;As the 20th century closed, the 'backward-looking' Berg suddenly came as [[George Perle|Perle]] remarked, to look like its most forward-looking composer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jarman, Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Analytical chemistry''' is the study of the [[Separation process|separation]], identification, and [[quantification]] of the [[chemical]] components of natural and artificial [[materials]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-03-005938-0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Holler, F. James; Skoog, Douglas A.; West, Donald M. |title=Fundamentals of analytical chemistry |publisher=Saunders College Pub |location=Philadelphia |year=1996 |pages= |isbn=0-03-005938-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qualitative analysis]] gives an indication of the identity of the chemical species in the sample and [[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative analysis]] determines the amount of one or more of these components. The separation of components is often performed prior to analysis. 

Analytical methods can be separated into classical and instrumental.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-03-002078-6&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Nieman, Timothy A.; Skoog, Douglas A.; Holler, F. James |title=Principles of instrumental analysis |publisher=Brooks/Cole |location=Pacific Grove, CA |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-03-002078-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical methods (also known as [[wet chemistry]] methods) use separations such as [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]], [[Extraction (chemistry)|extraction]], and [[distillation]] and qualitative analysis by color, odor, or melting point. Quantitative analysis is achieved by measurement of weight or volume. Instrumental methods use an apparatus to measure physical quantities of the analyte such as [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|light absorption]], [[fluorescence]], or [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]]. The separation of materials is accomplished using [[chromatography]] or [[electrophoresis]] methods. 

Analytical chemistry is also focused on improvements in [[experimental design]], [[chemometrics]], and the creation of new measurement tools to provide better chemical information. Analytical chemistry has applications in [[forensics]], [[bioanalysis]], [[Clinical chemistry|clinical]] analysis, [[environmental analysis]], and [[List of materials analysis methods|materials analysis]].

==History==
[[File:Bunsen-Kirchhoff.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Gustav Kirchhoff (left) and Robert Bunsen (right)]]
Analytical chemistry has been important since the early days of chemistry, providing methods for determining which elements and chemicals are present in the world around us.  During this period significant analytical contributions to chemistry include the development of systematic [[elemental analysis]] by [[Justus von Liebig]] and systematized organic analysis based on the specific reactions of functional groups. 

The first instrumental analysis was flame emissive spectrometry developed by [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] who discovered [[rubidium]] (Rb) and [[caesium]] (Cs) in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;ANALYTICAL SCIENCES 2001, VOL.17 SUPPLEMENT [http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/jsac/analsci/ICAS2001/pdfs/0500/0571_3i05n.pdf], Basic Education in Analytical Chemistry&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the major developments in analytical chemistry take place after 1900. During this period instrumental analysis becomes progressively dominant in the field. In particular many of the basic spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques were discovered in the early 20th century and refined in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talanta]] Volume 51, Issue 5, p921-933 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0039-9140(99)00358-6], Review of analytical next term measurements facilitated by drop formation technology&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[separation processes|separation sciences]] follow a similar time line of development and also become increasingly transformed into high performance instruments.&lt;ref&gt;TrAC Trends in Analytical Chemistry Volume 21, Issues 9-10, Pages 547-557 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0165-9936(02)00806-3], History of gas chromatography&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s many of these techniques began to be used together to achieve a complete characterization of samples. 

Starting in approximately the 1970s into the present day analytical chemistry has progressively become more inclusive of biological questions (bioanalytical chemistry), whereas it had previously been largely focused on inorganic or [[Small molecule|small organic molecules]]. Lasers have been increasingly used in chemistry as probes and even to start and influence a wide variety of reactions. The late 20th century also saw an expansion of the application of analytical chemistry from somewhat academic chemical questions to [[Forensic chemistry|forensic]], [[Environmental chemistry|environmental]], [[Chemical industry|industrial]] and [[clinical chemistry|medical]] questions, such as in [[histology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Talanta]], Volume 36, Issues 1-2, January–February 1989, Pages 1-9 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0039-9140(89)80077-3] History of analytical chemistry in the U.S.A.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern analytical chemistry is dominated by instrumental analysis. Many analytical chemists focus on a single type of instrument. Academics tend to either focus on new applications and discoveries or on new methods of analysis. The discovery of a chemical present in blood that increases the risk of cancer would be a discovery that an analytical chemist might be involved in. An effort to develop a new method might involve the use of a [[tunable laser]] to increase the specificity and sensitivity of a spectrometric method. Many methods, once developed, are kept purposely static so that data can be compared over long periods of time. This is particularly true in industrial [[Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] (QA), forensic and environmental applications. Analytical chemistry plays an increasingly important role in the pharmaceutical industry where, aside from QA, it is used in discovery of new drug candidates and in clinical applications where understanding the interactions between the drug and the patient are critical.

==Classical methods==
[[Image:Flame test.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The presence of [[copper]] in this qualitative analysis is indicated by the bluish-green color of the flame.]]
Although modern analytical chemistry is dominated by sophisticated instrumentation, the roots of analytical chemistry and some of the principles used in modern instruments are from traditional techniques many of which are still used today. These techniques also tend to form the backbone of most undergraduate analytical chemistry educational labs.

===Qualitative analysis===
A qualitative analysis determines the presence or absence of a particular compound, but not the mass or concentration. That is, it is not related to quantity.

====Chemical tests====
{{details|Chemical test}}
There are numerous qualitative chemical tests, for example, the [[acid test (gold)|acid test]] for [[gold]] and the [[Kastle-Meyer test]] for the presence of [[blood]].

====Flame test====
{{details| Flame test}}
Inorganic qualitative analysis generally refers to a systematic scheme to confirm the presence of certain, usually aqueous, ions or elements by performing a series of reactions that eliminate ranges of possibilities and then confirms suspected ions with a confirming test. Sometimes small carbon containing ions are included in such schemes. With modern instrumentation these tests are rarely used but can be useful for educational purposes and in field work or other situations where access to state-of-the-art instruments are not available or expedient.

===Gravimetric analysis===
{{details| Gravimetric analysis}}
Gravimetric analysis involves determining the amount of material present by weighing the sample before and/or after some transformation. A common example used in undergraduate education is the determination of the amount of water in a hydrate by heating the sample to remove the water such that the difference in weight is due to the loss of water.

===Volumetric analysis===
{{details| Titration}}
Titration involves the addition of a reactant to a solution being analyzed until some equivalence point is reached. Often the amount of material in the solution being analyzed may be determined. Most familiar to those who have taken college chemistry is the acid-base titration involving a color changing indicator. There are many other types of titrations, for example potentiometric titrations.
These titrations may use different types of indicators to reach some equivalence point.

==Instrumental methods==
{{Main|Instrumental analysis}}
[[Image:Analytical instrument.gif|right|thumb|300 px|Block diagram of an analytical instrument showing the stimulus and measurement of response]]

===Spectroscopy===
{{details| Spectroscopy}}
Spectroscopy measures the interaction of the molecules with [[electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic radiation]]. Spectroscopy consists of many different applications such as [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]], [[emission spectroscopy|atomic emission spectroscopy]], [[ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy]], [[x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], [[infrared spectroscopy]], [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[dual polarisation interferometry]], [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]], [[photoemission spectroscopy]], [[Mössbauer spectroscopy]] and so on.

===Mass spectrometry===
{{details| Mass spectrometry}}
[[File:1 MV accelerator mass spectrometer.jpg|left|thumb|200 px|An [[Accelerator mass spectrometry|accelerator mass spectrometer]] used for [[radiocarbon dating]] and other analysis.]]
Mass spectrometry measures mass-to-charge ratio of molecules using [[Electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s. There are several ionization methods: electron impact, chemical ionization, electrospray, fast atom bombardment, matrix assisted laser desorption ionization, and others. Also, mass spectrometry is categorized by approaches of mass analyzers: [[magnetic-sector]], [[quadrupole mass analyzer]], [[quadrupole ion trap]], [[time-of-flight mass spectrometry|time-of-flight]], [[Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance]], and so on.

===Electrochemical analysis===
{{details|Electroanalytical method}}
Electroanalytical methods measure the [[electric potential|potential]] ([[volts]]) and/or [[electric current|current]] ([[Ampere|amps]]) in an [[electrochemical cell]] containing the analyte.&lt;ref&gt;Bard, A.J.; Faulkner, L.R. '''Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications.''' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2nd Edition, '''2000'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skoog, D.A.; West, D.M.; Holler, F.J. '''Fundamentals of Analytical Chemistry''' New York: Saunders College Publishing, 5th Edition, '''1988'''.&lt;/ref&gt;  These methods can be categorized according to which aspects of the cell are controlled and which are measured.  The three main categories are [[Ion selective electrode|potentiometry]] (the difference in electrode potentials is measured), [[coulometry]] (the cell's current is measured over time), and [[voltammetry]] (the cell's current is measured while actively altering the cell's potential).

===Thermal analysis===
{{further|[[Calorimetry]], [[thermal analysis]]}}
Calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis measure the interaction of a material and [[heat]].

===Separation===
[[File:TLC black ink.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Separation of black ink on a [[thin layer chromatography]] plate.]]
{{further|[[Separation process]], [[Chromatography]], [[electrophoresis]]}}
Separation processes are used to decrease the complexity of material mixtures.  [[Chromatography]] and [[electrophoresis]] are representative of this field.

===Hybrid techniques===
Combinations of the above techniques produce a &quot;hybrid&quot; or &quot;hyphenated&quot; technique.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6353577&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilkins CL |title=Hyphenated techniques for analysis of complex organic mixtures |journal=Science |volume=222 |issue=4621 |pages=291–6 |year=1983 |pmid=6353577 |doi=10.1126/science.6353577}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9008869&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holt RM, Newman MJ, Pullen FS, Richards DS, Swanson AG |title=High-performance liquid chromatography/NMR spectrometry/mass spectrometry: further advances in hyphenated technology |journal=Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=64–70 |year=1997 |pmid=9008869 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-9888(199701)32:1&lt;64::AID-JMS450&gt;3.0.CO;2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9253184&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ellis LA, Roberts DJ |title=Chromatographic and hyphenated methods for elemental speciation analysis in environmental media |journal=Journal of chromatography.

For example, [[gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]], gas chromatography-[[infrared spectroscopy]], [[liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry]], liquid chromatography-[[NMR spectroscopy]]. liquid chromagraphy-infrared spectroscopy and capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry.

Hyphenated separation techniques refers to a combination of two (or more) techniques to detect and separate chemicals from solutions. Most often the other technique is some form of [[chromatography]]. Hyphenated techniques are widely used in [[chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]]. A [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]] is sometimes used instead of [[hyphen]], especially if the name of one of the methods contains a hyphen itself.

===Microscopy===
[[File:3D-SIM-3 Prophase 3 color.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|[[Fluorescence microscope]] image of two mouse cell nuclei in [[prophase]] (scale bar is 5 µm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1156947 | title = Subdiffraction Multicolor Imaging of the Nuclear Periphery with 3D Structured Illumination Microscopy | year = 2008 | last1 = Schermelleh | first1 = L. | last2 = Carlton | first2 = P.

{{details|Microscopy}}
The visualization of single molecules, single cells, biological tissues and [[nanomaterial]]s is an important and attractive approach in analytical science.  Also, hybridization with other traditional analytical tools is revolutionizing analytical science.  [[Microscopy]] can be categorized into three different fields: [[optical microscopy]], [[electron microscopy]], and [[scanning probe microscopy]].  Recently, this field is rapidly progressing because of the rapid development of the computer and camera industries.

===Lab-on-a-chip===
[[File:Glass-microreactor-chip-micronit.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|A glass [[microreactor]]]]
{{further|[[microfluidics]], [[lab-on-a-chip]]}}
Devices that integrate (multiple) laboratory functions on a single chip of only millimeters to a few square centimeters in size and that are capable of handling extremely small fluid volumes down to less than pico liters.

==Standards==
===Standard curve===
[[Image:Calibration curve.gif|thumb|right|200 px|A calibration curve plot showing [[Detection limit|limit of detection]] (LOD), [[Detection limit|limit of quantification]] (LOQ), dynamic range, and limit of linearity (LOL).]]
A general method for analysis of concentration involves the creation of a [[calibration curve]]. This allows for determination of the amount of a chemical in a material by comparing the results of unknown sample to those of a series known standards. If the concentration of element or compound in a sample is too high for the detection range of the technique, it can simply be diluted in a pure solvent. If the amount in the sample is below an instrument's range of measurement, the method of addition can be used. In this method a known quantity of the element or compound under study is added, and the difference between the concentration added, and the concentration observed is the amount actually in the sample.

===Internal standards===
Sometimes an [[internal standard]] is added at a known concentration directly to an analytical sample to aid in quantitation. The amount of analyte present is then determined relative to the internal standard as a calibrant.

===Standard addition===
The method of [[standard addition]] is used in instrumental analysis to determine concentration of a substance ([[analyte]]) in an unknown sample by comparison to a set of samples of known concentration, similar to using a [[calibration curve]]. Standard addition can be applied to most analytical techniques and is used instead of a [[calibration curve]] to solve the [[matrix effect]] problem.

==Signals and noise==
One of the most important components of analytical chemistry is maximizing the desired signal while minimizing the associated [[Noise (electronics)|noise]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-495-01201-7&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Crouch, Stanley; Skoog, Douglas A. |title=Principles of instrumental analysis |publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |location=Australia |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-495-01201-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analytical figure of merit is known as the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (S/N or SNR).

Noise can arise from environmental factors as well as from fundamental physical processes.

===Thermal noise===
{{Main|Johnson–Nyquist noise}}
Thermal noise results from the motion of charge carriers (usually electrons) in an electrical circuit generated by their thermal motion. Thermal noise is [[white noise]] meaning that the power [[spectral density]] is constant throughout the [[frequency spectrum]].

The [[root mean square]] value of the thermal noise in a resistor is given by&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-495-01201-7&quot; /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v_{{RMS}} = \sqrt { 4 k_B T R \Delta f },&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''T'' is the [[temperature]], ''R'' is the resistance, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the frequency &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt;.

===Shot noise===
{{Main|Shot noise}}
Shot noise is a type of [[electronic noise]] that occurs when the finite number of particles (such as [[electron]]s in an electronic circuit or [[photon]]s in an optical device) is small enough to give rise to statistical fluctuations in a signal.

Shot noise is a [[Poisson process]] and the charge carriers that make up the current follow a [[Poisson distribution]].  The root mean square current fluctuation is given by&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-495-01201-7&quot; /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;i_{{RMS}}=\sqrt{2\,e\,I\,\Delta f}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]] and ''I'' is the average current. Shot noise is white noise.

===Flicker noise===
{{Main|flicker noise}}
Flicker noise is electronic noise with a 1/''ƒ'' frequency spectrum; as ''f'' increases, the noise decreases. Flicker noise arises from a variety of sources, such as impurities in a conductive channel, generation and [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination]] noise in a [[transistor]] due to base current, and so on. This noise can be avoided by [[modulation]] of the signal at a higher frequency, for example through the use of a [[lock-in amplifier]].

===Environmental noise===
[[File:Analyse thermo gravimetrique bruit.png|thumb|right|200 px|Noise in a [[thermogravimetric analysis]]; lower noise in the middle of the plot results from less human activity (and environmental noise) at night.]]
[[Environmental noise]] arises from the surroundings of the analytical instrument. Sources of electromagnetic noise are [[power lines]], radio and television stations, [[wireless device]]s and [[electric motor]]s. Many of these noise sources are narrow bandwidth and therefore can be avoided. Temperature and [[vibration isolation]] may be required for some instruments.

===Noise reduction===
Noise reduction can be accomplished either in [[hardware]] or [[software]]. Examples of hardware noise reduction are the use of [[shielded cable]], [[analog filter]]ing, and signal modulation. Examples of software noise reduction are [[digital filter]]ing, [[ensemble average]], [[boxcar average]], and [[correlation]] methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-495-01201-7&quot; /&gt;

==Applications==
Analytical chemistry research is largely driven by performance (sensitivity, selectivity, robustness, [[linear range]], accuracy, precision, and speed), and cost (purchase, operation, training, time, and space). Among the main branches of contemporary analytical atomic spectrometry, the most widespread and universal are optical and mass spectrometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1070/RC2006v075n04ABEH001174|arxiv=physics/0607078 | title = Prospects in analytical atomic spectrometry | year = 2006 | last1 = Bol'shakov | first1 = Aleksandr A | last2 = Ganeev | first2 = Aleksandr A | last3 = Nemets | first3 = Valerii M | journal = Russian Chemical Reviews | volume = 75 | pages = 289 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the direct elemental analysis of solid samples, the new leaders are [[laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy|laser-induced breakdown]] and [[laser ablation]] mass spectrometry, and the related techniques with transfer of the laser ablation products into [[inductively coupled plasma]]. Advances in design of diode lasers and optical parametric oscillators promote developments in fluorescence and ionization spectrometry and also in absorption techniques where uses of optical cavities for increased effective absorption pathlength are expected to expand. Steady progress and growth in applications of plasma- and laser-based methods are noticeable. An interest towards the absolute (standardless) analysis has revived, particularly in the emission spectrometry. 

A lot of effort is put in shrinking the analysis techniques to [[Integrated circuit|chip]] size.  Although there are few examples of such systems competitive with traditional analysis techniques, potential advantages include size/portability, speed, and cost. (micro [[Total Analysis System]] (µTAS) or [[Lab-on-a-chip]]). [[Microscale chemistry]] reduces the amounts of chemicals used. 

Much effort is also put into analyzing biological systems.  Examples of rapidly expanding fields in this area are:
*[[Genomics]] - [[DNA sequencing]] and its related research. [[Genetic fingerprinting]] and [[DNA microarray]] are very popular tools and research fields.
*[[Proteomics]] - the analysis of protein concentrations and modifications, especially in response to various stressors, at various developmental stages, or in various parts of the body.
*[[Metabolomics]] - similar to proteomics, but dealing with metabolites.
*[[Transcriptomics]] - mRNA and its associated field
*[[Lipidomics]] - lipids and its associated field
*Peptidomics - peptides and its associated field
*Metalomics - similar to proteomics and metabolomics, but dealing with metal concentrations and especially with their binding to proteins and other molecules.

Analytical chemistry has played critical roles in the understanding of basic science to a variety of practical applications, such as biomedical applications, environmental monitoring, quality control of industrial manufacturing, forensic science and so on. 

The recent developments of computer automation and information technologies have innervated analytical chemistry to initiate a number of new biological fields. For example, automated DNA sequencing machines were the basis to complete human genome projects leading to the birth of [[genomics]]. Protein identification and peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry opened a new field of [[proteomics]]. Furthermore, a number of ~omics based on analytical chemistry have become important areas in modern biology.

Also, analytical chemistry has been an indispensable area in the development of [[nanotechnology]]. Surface characterization instruments, [[electron microscopes]] and scanning probe microscopes enables scientists to visualize atomic structures with chemical characterizations.

Among active contemporary analytical chemistry research fields, micro [[total analysis system]] is considered as a great promise of revolutionary technology.  In this approach, integrated and miniaturized analytical systems are being developed to control and analyze single cells and single molecules. This cutting-edge technology has a promising potential of leading a new revolution in science as integrated circuits did in computer developments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{redirect2|A Capella|Acapella|other uses|A cappella (disambiguation)}}

'''A cappella''' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for &quot;in the manner of the church&quot; or &quot;in the manner of the [[chapel]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William C|last=Holmes|title=A cappella|publisher=Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online|accessdate=21 September 2008|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/00091}}&lt;/ref&gt;) music is solo or group [[vocal]] or [[singing]] without [[musical instrument|instrumental]] [[sound]], or a piece intended to be performed in this way. A cappella was originally intended to differentiate between [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] [[polyphony]] and [[Baroque (music)|Baroque]] [[concertato]] style.  In the 19th century a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|A cappella|William C. Holmes|March 22|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern usage, a cappella often refers to an all-vocal group performance of any style, including [[Barbershop music|barbershop]], [[doo wop]], and modern pop/rock. Today, a cappella also includes sample/loop &quot;vocal only&quot; productions by producers like [[Jimmy Spice Curry]], [[Teddy Riley (producer)|Teddy Riley]], [[Wyclef Jean]], Mike Tompkins, and other producers.

==Religious traditions==
A cappella music originally was, and still often is, used in religious music, especially [[church music]] as well as [[anasheed]] and [[zemirot]]. [[Gregorian chant]] is an example of a cappella singing, as is the majority of secular vocal music from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]].  The [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], up until its development in the early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] into an instrumentally-accompanied form, is also usually in a cappella form.  Jewish and Christian music were originally a cappella, and this tradition has existed continuously in both of these religions as well as in Islam.

===Christian===
{{Disputed-section|Christian &quot;alternate viewpoint&quot;|date=June 2009}}
The [[polyphony]] of Christian a cappella music began to develop in Europe around the late 15th century. The early a cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument, although this instrument&lt;!--Which instrument? A single melody instrument or a polyphonic instrument like a pipe organ?--&gt; would merely double the singers' parts and was not independent. By the 16th century, a cappella [[polyphony]] had further developed, but gradually, the [[cantata]] began to take the place of a cappella forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9003189 &quot;a cappella&quot;]. (2006). In Encyclopædia Britannica.  Retrieved December 2, 2006, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; 16th century a cappella polyphony, nonetheless, continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day. Such is seen in the life of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] becoming a major influence on [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], most notably in the aforementioned ''[[Mass in B Minor]]''.

====Eastern Orthodox Christianity====
In [[Eastern Europe]], the music performed in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] cathedrals and monasteries is exclusively sung without music. Bishop Kallistos Ware says, &quot;The service is sung, even though there may be no choir... In the Orthodox Church today, as in the early Church, singing is unaccompanied and instrumental music is not found.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Ware. The Orthodox Church: New Edition. (London: Penguin Books, 1997), 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Liturgies and masses composed by famous composers such as [[Peter Tchaikovsky]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Alexander Arkhangelsky (composer)|Alexander Arkhangelsky]], and [[Mykola Leontovych]] are fine examples of this.

====Opposition to instruments in worship====
Present-day Christian religious bodies known for conducting their worship services without musical accompaniment include some [[Presbyterian]] churches devoted to the [[regulative principle of worship]], [[Old Regular Baptist]]s, [[Primitive Baptist]]s, [[Plymouth Brethren]],  [[Churches of Christ]], the [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Christian Church and the [[Amish]] and [[Mennonite]]. Certain [[high church]] services and other musical events in liturgical churches (such as the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]]) may be a cappella, a practice remaining from apostolic times.  Many [[Mennonite]]s also conduct some or all of their services without instruments.  [[Sacred Harp]], a type of religious [[folk music]], is an a cappella style of religious singing, but is more often sung at singing conventions than at church services.

Opponents of musical instruments in the Christian [[worship]] believe that such opposition is supported by the New Testament and Church history. The New Testament verses typically referenced are [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026:30;%20Acts%2016:25;%20Romans%2015:9;%201%20Corinthians%2014:15;%20Ephesians%205:19;%20Colossians%203:16;%20Hebrews%202:12,%2013:15;%20James%205:13;&amp;version=49; Matthew 26:30; Acts 16:25; Romans 15:9; 1 Corinthians 14:15; Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16; Hebrews 2:12, 13:15; James 5:13], which reveal a command for all Christians to sing.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', Marshall C. Kurfees, ''Instrumental music in the worship or the Greek verb '''psallo''' philologically and historically examined together with a full discussion of kindred matters relating to music in Christian worship'' (Nashville: McQuiddy, 1911).&lt;/ref&gt; Further study reveals that in the New Testament, when God was worshiped in song, it was performed a cappella regardless of the day or setting. Paul singing praises to God in jail (Acts 16:25) and Christians singing when they are happy (James 5:13) are two examples. [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2014:15,26;&amp;version=49; 1 Cor. 14:15, 26] discusses the worship service of Corinth and textually uses the words ''speak and sing'' in ways that cannot include instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. John L. Girardeau, Instrumental Music in the Public Worship of the Church (PuritanReprints, 2006),p91 or see another edition of the same book Dr. John LaFayette. Girardeau, Instrumental Music in Church Worship (Crown Rights Book Company, 2005), p118.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no reference to instrumental music in the worship of the New Testament or the worship of churches for the first six centuries.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon (1965), The Church Fathers and Musical Instruments (Ph.D. Dissertation, Columbia University). p. 263, 265. See also, James D. Bales, ''Instrumental Music &amp; New Testament Worship'' (Searcy, AR: Truth for Today World Mision School, 1973)p.351.&lt;/ref&gt; That being said, the reason for such absence is highly debated, though several reasons have been put forth throughout church history.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The absence of instrumental music is rooted in various hermeneutic principles restricting the appropriateness of worship. Such views are the [[regulative principle of worship]], [[Sola scriptura]], the history of [[hymn]] in &quot;Christianity&quot;. The Hebrew writer spent a great deal of time contrasting Old Testament and New Testament worship, which brings forth a theological understanding. In short, all of the Old Testament and its practices have been replaced by New Testament and teachings of Jesus.&lt;/ref&gt;  The absence of instrumental music in New Testament worship is significant given the abundance of Old Testament references and commands. After several hundred years of Tabernacle worship without instrumental music, King David introduced musical instruments into Temple worship based upon a commandment from God. God commanded who was to sing, who was to play, and what instruments were to be used, as seen in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Chronicles%2029:25-29;&amp;version=49; 2 Chronicles 29:25–29].

Unlike the Israelite worship assembly, which was only able to look on during Temple worship as the Levitical Priest sang, played, and offered animal sacrifices, in the New Testament, all Christians are commanded to sing praises to God. This leaves those opposed to instrumental music in worship with the understanding that if God wanted instrumental music in New Testament worship, he would have commanded not just singing, but singing and playing like he did in the Old Testament. Though God commanded instruments to be used in Temple worship, and the daily life of Israel, the first recorded example of a musical instrument in Roman Catholic worship was an [[Pipe organ|organ]] introduced by [[Pope Vitalian]] into a cathedral in Rome around 670.&lt;ref&gt;American Encyclopedia, Volume 12, p. 688&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;McKinnon maintained that the organ was the first instrument to be introduced into worship service and the next was the trumpet. He noted accounts of an organ being sent from Byzantium to Pippin in 757, and another to Charlemagne in 812. See ''McKinnon (1965), The Church Fathers and Musical Instruments (Ph.D. Dissertation, Columbia University) p265''&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, over time, the expression &quot;a cappella&quot; (Italian for &quot;in the manner of the chapel&quot;) came to mean exclusively vocal music in contradistinction to the spreading use of the organ in cathedrals.

Instruments have divided Christendom since their introduction into worship. They were considered a Catholic innovation, not widely practiced until the 18th century, and were opposed vigorously in worship by a number of [[Protestant Reformers]], including [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546),&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, Mcclintock &amp; Strong's Encyclopedia Volume VI, page 762&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Calvin]] (1509–1564)&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, Commentary on Psalms 33&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Wesley]] (1703–1791).&lt;ref&gt;Adam Clarke, Clark's Commentary vol. IV, (Nashville: Abingdon Press, n.d.), p. 684&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Campbell referred to the use of an instrument in worship &quot;a cow bell in a concert&quot; (p. 414 in Everett Ferguson, &quot;Instrumental Music&quot;, in ''The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement'', ed. Douglas A. Foster, Paul M. Blowers, Anthony L. Dunnavant, &amp; D. Newell Williams [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2004], ISBN 0-8028-3898-7; Ferguson's entire article is on pp. 414–417).&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Christendom has periodically grafted instrumental music into the worship service probably obscures, for contemporary adherents, the long, general and conscientious teaching of a cappella. In Sir Walter Scott's ''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]'', for example, the heroine, Jeanie Deans, a Scottish Presbyterian, writes to her father about the church situation she has found in England (bold added):
:The folk here are civil, and, like the barbarians unto the holy apostle, have shown me much kindness; and there are a sort of chosen people in the land, for they have some '''[[kirk]]s without organs that are like ours''', and are called meeting-houses, where the minister preaches without a gown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6944/6944.txt |title=The Heart of Mid-Lothian |author=Walter Scott |authorlink=Walter Scott |date=October 23, 2006 |work=gutenberg.org |publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]] |accessdate=November 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acceptance of instruments in worship====
An alternate viewpoint is that limiting praise to the unaccompanied chant of the early church is not commanded in scripture, and that the churches in any age are free to offer their songs with or without musical instruments.

Since the New Testament never counters this instrumental language with any negative judgment on instruments, opposition to instruments instead comes from an interpretation of history. It is striking that there is no written opposition to musical instruments in any setting in the 1st century and a half of the churches (including scripture).&lt;ref&gt;James McKinnon, ''Music in Early Christian Literature'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of the 2nd century, however, Christians began condemning the actual instruments themselves.&lt;ref&gt;James McKinnon, ''The Temple, the Church Fathers, and Early Western Chant'' (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing Limited, 1988), IV, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who oppose instruments today believe that emerging opposition of these Church Fathers demonstrates a better understanding of God's desire, but there are significant differences between the teachings of the Church Fathers and Christian opposition to instruments today.
* Modern Christians typically believe it is acceptable to play instruments or to attend weddings, funerals, banquets, etc., where instruments are heard. The Church Fathers made no exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, ''TCFEWC,'' IV, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the New Testament never condemns instruments themselves, much less in any of these settings, it is conceded that “the church Fathers go beyond the New Testament in pronouncing a negative judgment on musical instruments.”&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Written opposition to instruments in worship began near the turn of the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, pp. 52, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern opponents of instruments do not make the same assessment of instruments as these writers,&lt;ref&gt;Rather than calling the use of instruments “evil,” modern opposition uses terms like “unspiritual” (Ferguson, p 88.) or an Old Testament “shadow” (Jack Lewis, Everett Ferguson and Earl West, ''The Instrumental Music Issue'', Nashville, TN: The Gospel Advocate Co., 1987, p. 109).&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that God had allowed David the “evil” of using musical instruments in praise.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, ''MECL,'' p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to their teaching, the Old Testament scripture shows that God specifically asked for instruments rather than merely tolerating an evil.&lt;ref&gt;2 Chronicles 29:25&lt;/ref&gt;

Since “a cappella” singing brought a new polyphony with instrumental accompaniment, it is not surprising that Protestant reformers who opposed the instruments (such as Calvin and Zwingli) also opposed the polyphony.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Piero and Richard Taruskin, ''Music in the Western World'' (New York: Shirmer Books, 1984), p.107.&lt;/ref&gt; While Zwingli was burning organs in Switzerland&amp;nbsp;– Luther called him a fanatic&amp;nbsp;– the Church of England was burning books of polyphony.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, p.109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish===
While services in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] included musical instruments (2 Chronicles 29:25-27), traditional [[Judaism|Jewish]] religious services in the Synagogue, both before and after the destruction of the Temple, did not include musical instruments &lt;ref&gt;John Price, ''Old Light on New Worship: Musical Instruments and The Worship of God, A Theological, Historical, and Psychological Study'' (Avinger, Texas: Simpson Publishing Company, 2005),p.68.&lt;/ref&gt; given the practice of scriptural [[cantillation]].&lt;ref&gt;James McKinnon, The Temple, the Church Fathers, and Early Western Chant (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing Limited, 1988), III, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;   The use of musical instruments is traditionally forbidden on the Sabbath out of concern that players would be tempted to repair their instruments, which is forbidden on those days.  (This prohibition has been relaxed in many Reform and some Conservative congregations.)  Similarly, when Jewish families and larger groups sing traditional Sabbath songs known as [[zemirot]] outside the context of formal religious services, they usually do so a cappella, and Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations on the Sabbath sometimes feature entertainment by a cappella ensembles.  During [[the Three Weeks]] use of musical instruments is traditionally prohibited. Many Jews consider a portion of the 49-day period of the [[Counting of the Omer|counting of the omer]] between Passover and Shavuot to be a time of semi-mourning and instrumental music is not allowed during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/Shiur.asp?id=2262 |title=Mourning Customs During the Omer |accessdate=3 January 2009 |last=Melamed |first=Rabbi Eliezer |work=www.yeshiva.org.il |publisher=Bet El Yeshiva Center }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to a tradition of a cappella singing sometimes known as ''sefirah'' music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shircago&quot;&gt;[http://www.shircago.com/jewish-a-cappella-omer.php Shircago, ''Jewish A Cappella and Sefirat Omer''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularization of the Jewish chant may be found in the writings of the Jewish philosopher [[Philo]], born 20 BCE. Weaving together Jewish and Greek thought, Philo promoted praise without instruments, and taught that &quot;silent singing&quot; (without even vocal chords) was better still.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Ferguson, ''A Cappella Music in the Public Worship of the Church'' (Revised Edition), Abilene, Texas: Biblical Research Press, 1972, pp. 39-41.&lt;/ref&gt; So strong was his influence that the Jewish sect of the Pharisees even came to oppose the temple instruments.&lt;ref&gt;E. Werner, &quot;Music&quot;, ''Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible'' (Nashville, Tennessee: Abingdon Press, 1984), pp. 466, 468.&lt;/ref&gt; This view parted with the Jewish scriptures, where Israel offered praise with instruments by God's own command (e.g.: 2 Chronicles 29:25). The [[shofar]] or keren (horn) is the only temple instrument still being used today in the synagogue,&lt;ref&gt;Lee G. Olson, &quot;Music and Musical Instruments of the Bible&quot;, ''Zondervan Pictoral Bible Dictionary'', [[Merrill C. Tenney]], Editor (Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing House, 1967), p. 562.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is only used from [[Rosh Chodesh]] [[Elul]] through the end of [[Yom Kippur]]. The shofar is used by itself, without any vocal accompaniment, and is limited to a very strictly defined set of sounds and specific places in the synagogue service.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Muslim===
Many [[Muslim]] musicians also perform a form of a cappella music called ''[[nasheed]]''.

==In the United States==
Peter Christian Lutkin, Dean of the Northwestern University School of Music, helped popularize a cappella music in the United States by founding the Northwestern A Cappella Choir in 1906. The A Cappella Choir was &quot;the first permanent organization of its kind in America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Northwestern University, Guide to the Peter Christian Lutkin Papers, ''Biography'', http://www.library.northwestern.edu/archives/findingaids/lutkin_papers.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Van Camp, The Formation of A Cappella Choirs at Northwestern University, St. Olaf College, and Westminster College, Journal of Research in Music Education, Vol. 13, No. 4 (Winter, 1965), pp. 227-238.&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong and prominent a cappella tradition was begun in the midwest part of the United States in 1911 by F. Melius Christiansen, a music faculty member at [[St. Olaf College]] in Northfield, Minnesota. The St. Olaf College Choir was established as an outgrowth of the local St. John's Lutheran Church, where Christiansen was organist and the choir was composed at least partially of students from the nearby St. Olaf campus. The success of the ensemble was emulated by other regional conductors, and a rich tradition of a cappella choral music was born in the region at colleges like [[Concordia College, Moorhead|Concordia College]] (Moorhead, Minnesota), [[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College]] (Rock Island, Illinois), [[Wartburg College]] (Waverly, Iowa), [[Luther College (Iowa)|Luther College]] (Decorah, Iowa), [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] (St. Peter, Minnesota), [[Augustana College (South Dakota)|Augustana College]] (Sioux Falls, South Dakota), and [[Augsburg College]] (Minneapolis, Minnesota). The choirs typically range from 40 to 80 singers and are recognized for their efforts to perfect blend, intonation, phrasing and pitch in a large choral setting.

Major movements in modern a cappella over the past century include [[Barbershop music|Barbershop]] and [[doo wop]]. The [[Barbershop Harmony Society]], [[Sweet Adelines International]], and Harmony Inc. host educational events including Harmony University, Directors University, and the International Educational Symposium, and international contests and conventions, recognizing international champion [[List of chorus champions by year|choruses]] and [[List of quartet champions by year|quartets]].

In the 1950s several recording groups, notably [[The Hi-Los]] and the [[Four Freshmen]], introduced complex jazz harmonies to a cappella performances. The [[King's Singers]] are credited with promoting interest in small-group a cappella performances in the 1960s. In 1983 an a cappella group known as [[The Flying Pickets]] had a Christmas 'number one' in the UK with a cover of [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]]'s (known in the US as [[Yazoo (band)|Yaz]]) &quot;[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]&quot;. A cappella music attained renewed prominence from the late 1980s onward, spurred by the success of Top 40 recordings by artists such as [[The Manhattan Transfer]], [[Bobby McFerrin]], [[Huey Lewis and the News]], [[All-4-One]], [[The Nylons]], [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[Boyz II Men]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Recording artists===
Contemporary a cappella includes many vocal groups and bands who add [[vocal percussion]] or [[beatboxing]] to create a pop/rock sound, in some cases very similar to bands with instruments. One such group is [[Rockapella]]. There also remains a strong a cappella presence within Christian music, as some denominations purposefully do not use instruments during worship. Examples of such groups are [[Take 6]], [[Glad (band)|Glad]] and [[Acappella (group)|Acappella]]. Arrangements of popular music for small a cappella ensembles typically include one voice singing the lead melody, one singing a rhythmic bass line, and the remaining voices contributing chordal or [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] accompaniment.

A cappella can also describe the practice of using just the vocal track(s) from a [[multitrack]], instrumental recording to be [[remix]]ed or put onto vinyl records for DJs. Artists sometimes release the vocal tracks of their popular songs so that fans can remix them. One such example is the a cappella release of [[Jay-Z]]'s ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|Black Album]]'', which [[Danger Mouse (artist)|Danger Mouse]] mixed with [[The Beatles]]' ''[[The White Album|White Album]]'' to create ''[[The Grey Album]]''.

A cappella&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s growth is not limited to live performance, with hundreds of recorded a cappella albums produced over the past decade. As of December 2006, the Recorded A Cappella Review Board (RARB) had reviewed over 660 a cappella albums since 1994, and its popular discussion forum had over 900 users and 19,000 articles.

A cappella exists in Japan, with groups such as the Gospellers performing. In USA in [[Number-one hits of 1943 (United States)|July 1943]], as a result of the [[American Federation of Musicians]] boycott of US recording studios, the a cappella vocal group ''The Song Spinners'' had a best-seller with &quot;Comin' In On A Wing And A Prayer&quot;. A South-Korean group named Dong Bang Shin Ki (DBSK) or Tong Vfang Xien Qi (TVXQ) was formed in 2003, and currently holds the world record for the biggest fanclub.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Recording artist [[Brandy Norwood]] included a song on her 2008 album ''[[Human (Brandy Norwood album)|Human]]'' titled &quot;A Capella (Something's Missing)&quot;. Brandy uses her voice for background music in this song, showing her capabilities of using her voice as an instrument. No instruments are used, except for maybe an electric guitar, though fans are claiming it to be her synthesized voice.

In 2010, American dance recording artist [[Kelis]] released a song called [[Acapella (song)|&quot;Acapella&quot;]] as the first single from her album [[Flesh Tone]]. The song is not actually performed a cappella, but rather, explains that before her son was born, her life was without music.

In Australia, there is a growing trend bringing people back to singing thanks to TV shows like Glee. As a result, a cappella singing is once again growing, with a handful of internationally acclaimed groups (The Idea Of North, Suade, Coco's Lunch, Akasa), and a growing local scene. In 2010, the Australian a cappella Quartet [[The Idea of North]] was nominated for an [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA]] for their seventh studio album, &quot;''Feels Like Spring''&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.take40.com/news/20335/2010-ARIA-Nominations-Announced---Full-List-Here!&lt;/ref&gt; bringing a cappella music back into pop culture. Like the USA, Australia has an a cappella association (Vocal Australia) who organizes events, education and resources for the vocal music community.

===Musical theater===
A Cappella has been used as the sole orchestration for original works of Musical Theater that have had commercial runs [[Off-Broadway]] (theaters in New York City with 99 to 500 seats) only twice. The first was Avenue X which opened on January 28, 1994 and ran for 77 performances. It was produced by [[Playwrights Horizons]] with book by John Jiler, music and lyrics by Ray Leslee. The musical style of the show's score was primarily [[Doo-Wop]] as the plot revolved around Doo-Wop group singers of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lortel.org/lla_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&amp;title=Avenue%20X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/11/theater/last-chance.html?scp=51&amp;sq=%22a+cappella%22&amp;st=nyt | work=The New York Times | title=Last Chance | date=June 11, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second a cappella musical to appear Off-Broadway, In Transit, premiered October 5, 2010 and was produced by [[Primary Stages]] with book, music, and lyrics by Kristen Anderson-Lopez, James-Allen Ford, Russ Kaplan, and Sara Wordsworth. Set primarily in the New York City subway system its score features an eclectic mix of musical genres (including jazz, hip hop, Latin, rock, and country). In Transit incorporates vocal beat boxing into its contemporary a cappella arrangements through the use of a subway beat boxer character. Beat boxer and actor Chesney Snow performed this role for the 2010 Primary Stages production.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lortel.org/lla_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&amp;title=In%20Transit&lt;/ref&gt; According to the show's website, it is scheduled to reopen for an open-ended commercial run in the Fall of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intransitthemusical.com/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the production received four Lucille Lortel Award nominations including Outstanding Musical.

No show with a cappella orchestrations has ever run on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].

===Barbershop style===
{{main|Barbershop music}}
[[Barbershop music]] is one of the few uniquely American art forms.  The earliest reports of this style of a cappella music involved African Americans.  The earliest documented quartets all began in barbershops. In 1938, the first formal men's barbershop organization was formed, known as the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America (S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A), and in 2004 rebranded itself and officially changed its public name to the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]] (BHS).  Today the BHS has over 30,000 members in 800 chapters across the United States, and the barbershop style has spread around the world with organizations in many other countries. The Barbershop Harmony Society provides a highly organized competition structure for a cappella quartets and choruses singing in the barbershop style.

In 1945, the first formal women's barbershop organization, Sweet Adelines, was formed. In 1953 Sweet Adelines became an international organization, although it didn't change its name to [[Sweet Adelines International]] until 1991. The membership of nearly 25,000 women, all singing in English, includes choruses in most of the fifty United States as well as in Australia, Canada, England, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Scotland, Sweden, Wales and the Netherlands. Headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the organization encompasses more than 1,200 registered quartets and 600 choruses.

In 1959, a second women's barbershop organization started as a break off from Sweet Adelines due to ideological differences. Based on democratic principles which continue to this day, [http://www.harmonyinc.org Harmony, Inc.] is smaller than its counterpart, but has an atmosphere of friendship and competition. With about 2,500 members in the United States and Canada, Harmony, Inc. uses the same rules in contest that the Barbershop Harmony Society uses. Harmony, Inc. is registered in Providence, Rhode Island.

==Collegiate types==
{{main|Collegiate a cappella|List of collegiate a cappella groups}}
It is not clear exactly where collegiate a cappella began.  The Rensselyrics of [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (formerly known as the RPI Glee Club), established in 1873 is perhaps the oldest known collegiate a cappella group.&lt;ref name=RPI&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://news.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=284 |title = The Glee Club: A Musical Legacy at Rensselaer |accessdate = 2009-02-23 |publisher = Rensselaer  Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the longest continuously-singing group is probably [[The Whiffenpoofs]] of [[Yale University]],&lt;ref name=Yale&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.singers.com/collegiate/whiffenpoofs.html
|title = The Yale Whiffenpoofs|accessdate = 2007-09-14
|publisher = United Singers International
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was formed in 1909 and once included [[Cole Porter]] as a member.&lt;ref name=Yale /&gt; Collegiate a cappella groups grew throughout the 20th century.  Some notable historical groups formed along the way include [[Colgate University]]'s The Colgate 13 (1942), [[Dartmouth College]]'s Aires (1946),[[Cornell University]]'s Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the [[Columbia University]] Kingsmen (1949), and the [[University of Rochester]] YellowJackets (1956).  All-women a cappella groups followed shortly, frequently as a [[parody]] of the men's groups: the [[Smiffenpoofs]] of [[Smith College]] (1936), The Shwiffs of Connecticut College (The She-Whiffenpoofs, 1944), and [[The Chattertocks of Brown University]] (1951).  A cappella groups exploded in popularity beginning in the 1990s, fueled in part by a change in style popularized by the [[Beelzebubs|Tufts University Beelzebubs]] and the [[Dear Abbeys|Boston University Dear Abbeys]].  The new style used voices to emulate modern rock instruments, including [[vocal percussion]]/&quot;[[beatboxing]]&quot;. Some larger universities now have multiple groups.  Groups often join one another in on-campus concerts, such as [[the Georgetown Chimes]]' Cherry Tree Massacre, a 3-weekend a cappella festival held each February since 1975, where over a hundred collegiate groups have appeared, as well as [[List of quartet champions by year|International Quartet Champions]] [[Boston Common (quartet)|The Boston Common]] and the contemporary commercial a cappella group [[Rockapella]].  Co-ed groups have produced many up-and-coming artists, including [[John Legend]], an alumnus of the Counterparts at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Sara Bareilles]], an alumna of Awaken A Cappella at [[University of California, Los Angeles]].

&lt;!--this section needs to be edited.  There is a disproportionate amount of emphasis on South Asian a cappella.  If this section is to be kept, appropriate emphasis must be given to other cultural groups, e.g. Jewish groups, East Asian groups, etc.  Another recommendation is to move all of this information to the &quot;Collegiate A Cappella&quot; page.--&gt;
A cappella is gaining popularity among South Asians with the emergence of primarily Hindi-English College groups. Examples of prominent groups include [[Penn Masala]] in the University of Pennsylvania, New York Masti in the NYC area, [[Chai-Town]] from the University of Illinois, [[Berkeley Dil Se|Dil Se]] from UC Berkeley, Suno from Boston University, Swaram from Texas A&amp;M University, and Raagapella in Stanford. The first all-female group is New York Masti, most of whose members have been from New York University. Examples of other all-female groups are Illini Chandani, from the University of Illinois, Awaaz, from Wellesley College and Kal Ki Awaaz from UC Berkeley. Ektaal, founded in 1999 within the University of Virginia, recently went co-ed in 2006, but prior to that, was an all-female group. While up and coming all-male groups are becoming a rarity among Desi a cappella groups, [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s Deewane (started in 2007) and [[Dartmouth College]]'s Taal are hoping to reverse that trend. Co-ed South Asian a cappella groups are also gaining popularity like  [[Northwestern University]]'s Brown Sugar, [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]'s Taal Tadka, the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s Ohms, Case Western's Dhamakapella, Johns Hopkins Kranti, University of Maryland Anokha,  Drexel Shor, UCSD Sitaare, GWU Geet, UCLA Naya Zamaana, Michigan's Maize Mirchi, Rutgers R.A.A.G., Columbia Sur, USC Asli Baat, and UW Awaaz.

These groups have attained significant critical acclaim with their distinct style of mixing songs and applying a cappella to styles of different cultures. Penn Masala has songs in Hindi, Arabic, English, Punjabi and Gujarati, with lyrics from different languages in the same song. Currently there are few South Asian a cappella competitions in the nation. Gathe Raho, the largest South Asian a cappella competition in the midwest, as well as the nation, takes place annually at the [[University of Iowa]] in [[Iowa City]].  Gathe Raho has featured many top level teams throughout the nation, with UC [[Berkeley Dil Se]] and Maize Mirchi from Michigan placing 1st and 2nd, respectively in 2009.  Gathe Raho 2010 was held on April 10, 2010, where Brown Sugar from Northwestern, Maize Mirchi from Michigan, and Chai-Town from the University of Illinois placed 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, respectively.  Another competition takes place annually at the University of California, Berkeley, known as &quot;Anahat&quot;. Anahat 2009 was won by Asli Baat from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. In 2009, Johns Hopkins Kranti plans to break tradition and host a Hindi A Cappella Charity Showcase with the Association for India's Development on the East Coast for all Hindi A Cappella groups on the other side of the country.{{update after|2009|12|31}}

Increased interest in modern a cappella (particularly collegiate a cappella) can be seen in the growth of awards such as the Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards (overseen by the [[Contemporary A Cappella Society]]) and competitions such as the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella]] for college groups and the [[Harmony Sweepstakes]] for all groups. In December 2009, a new television competition series called ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' aired on [[NBC]]. The show featured eight a cappella groups from the United States and Puerto Rico vying for the prize of $100,000 and a recording contract with [[Epic Records]]/[[Sony Music]]. The show was judged by [[Ben Folds]], [[Shawn Stockman]], and [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and was won by an all-male group from Puerto Rico called [[Nota (group)|Nota]].

==Emulating instruments==
In addition to singing words, some a cappella singers also emulate instrumentation by reproducing the melody with their [[vocal cords]]. One of the earliest 20th century practitioners of this method was [[The Mills Brothers]] whose early recordings of the 1930s clearly stated on the label that all instrumentation was done vocally.    More recently, &quot;[[Twilight Zone (dance song)|Twilight Zone]]&quot; by [[2 Unlimited]] was sung a cappella to the instrumentation on the comedy [[television series]] ''Tompkins Square''.  Another famous example of emulating instrumentation instead of singing the words is the theme song for ''[[The New Addams Family]]'' series on [[Fox Family Channel]] (now [[ABC Family]]). Groups such as [[Vocal Sampling]] and Undivided emulate Latin rhythms a cappella.  In the 1960s, the Swingle Singers used their voices to emulate musical instruments to Baroque and Classical music.  Vocal artist [[Bobby McFerrin]] is famous for his instrumental emulation.

The [[Swingle Singers]] used nonsense words to sound like instruments, but have been known to produce non-verbal versions of musical instruments. Like the other groups, examples of their music can be found on [[YouTube]].  [[Beatboxing]] is a form of a cappella music popular in the [[hip-hop]] community, where [[rapping|rap]] is often performed a cappella also. [[Petra Haden]] used a four-track recorder to produce an a cappella version of ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' including the instruments and fake advertisements on her album ''[[Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out]]'' in 2005. Haden has also released a cappella versions of [[Journey (band)|Journey]]'s &quot;[[Don't Stop Believin']]&quot;, [[The Beach Boys]]' &quot;[[God Only Knows]]&quot; and [[Michael Jackson]]'s &quot;[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]&quot;. In 2009, [[Toyota]] commissioned Haden to perform three songs for television commercials for the third-generation [[Toyota Prius]], including an a cappella version of the [[Bellamy Brothers]] 1970s song &quot;[[Let Your Love Flow]]&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Christian rock group [[Relient K]] recorded the song &quot;Plead the Fifth&quot; a cappella on its album ''[[Five Score and Seven Years Ago]]''. The group recorded lead singer [[Matt Thiessen]] making drum noises and played them with electronic drums to make the song.

The German [[Heavy Metal Music|metal]] band [[van Canto]] uses vocal noises to imitate guitars on covers of well-known rock and metal songs (such as &quot;[[Master of Puppets (song)|Master of Puppets]]&quot; by [[Metallica]]) as well as original compositions.  Although they are generally classified as a cappella metal, the band also includes a drummer, and use amplifiers on some songs to distort the voice to sound more like a real guitar.

{{Original research|article|date=May 2008}}

The [[American Federation of Musicians]] defines '''arranging''' as &quot;the art of preparing and adapting an already written composition for presentation in other than its original form. An arrangement may include reharmonization, paraphrasing, and/or development of a composition, so that it fully represents the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic structure&quot; (Corozine 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;3). [[Orchestration#Orchestration_as_Adaptation|Orchestration]] differs in that it is only adapting music for an [[orchestra]] or [[musical ensemble]] while arranging &quot;involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or [[modulation (music)|modulations]], and endings...Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety&quot; (ibid).

== Classical music ==
Arrangements and transcriptions of classical and [[serious music]] go back to the early history of this genre. In particular music written for the piano frequently underwent this treatment.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The suite of ten piano pieces ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition#Arrangements and interpretations|Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]], has been arranged over twenty times, perhaps the most famous and notable being that of [[Maurice Ravel]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} 

Due to his lack of expertise in orchestration, the American composer [[George Gershwin]] had his ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' orchestrated and arranged by [[Ferde Grofé]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Rodney: ''George Gershwin'', page 66. Phaidon Press, 1998. ISBN 0-7148-3504-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular music==
Arrangers in pop music recordings often add parts for orchestral or band instruments involving new material such that the arrangers may reasonably be considered co-composers, although for copyright and royalty purposes usually are not.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Rhythm section parts are usually improvised or otherwise invented by the performers themselves using chord symbols or a lead sheet as a guide.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} (Rhythm section instruments usually include guitars, bass guitars, string basses, piano and other keyboard instruments, and drums.)

An existing pop song can be re-recorded with a different arrangement to the original. As well as different instruments, the [[tempo]], [[time signature]] and [[key signature]] may be altered, sometimes drastically so. The end result is a song that retains familiar phrases and lyrics, but offers something new.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} This practice was particularly popular in the late 1960s. Well known examples of this include [[Joe Cocker]]'s version of [[The Beatles]]' [[With a Little Help from My Friends]], and [[Ike Turner|Ike And Tina Turner]]'s version of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]'s [[Proud Mary]]. The American group [[Vanilla Fudge]] and British group [[Yes (band)|Yes]] based their early careers on radical re-arrangements of contemporary hits.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Some [[remix]]es, particularly in [[dance music]], can also be considered re-arrangements in this style.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Jazz==
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2008}}
In jazz an unscored collaborative arrangement is called a &quot;'''head arrangement'''&quot; (Randel 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;294; it is in the head of the musician(s)). Big bands such as those of Duke Ellington (at the very beginning of his career), Bennie Moten, and Count Basie performed head arrangements (ibid).

Arrangements for small jazz combos are usually informal, minimal, and uncredited. This was particularly so for combos in the [[bebop]] era. In general, the larger the ensemble, the greater the need for a formal arrangement, although the early [[Count Basie]] [[big band]] was famous for its ''head'' arrangements, so called because they were worked out by the players themselves, memorized immediately and never written down. Most arrangements for large ensembles, ''big bands'', in the [[swing music|swing]] era, were written down, however, and credited to a specific arranger, as were later arrangements for the Count Basie big band by [[Sammy Nestico]] and [[Neal Hefti]]. [[Don Redman]] made significant innovations in the pattern of arrangement in [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s orchestra in the 1920s. He introduced the pattern of arranging melodies in the body of arrangements and arranging section performances of the big band. [[Benny Carter]] became Fletcher's main arranger in the early 30's, moving on become as famous for his arranging expertise as his musicianship. [[Billy Strayhorn]] was an arranger of great renown in the [[Duke Ellington]] orchestra beginning in 1938.

[[Jelly Roll Morton]] is considered the earliest jazz arranger, writing down the parts when he was touring about 1912-1915 so that pick-up bands could play his compositions. Big band arrangements are informally called ''charts''. In the swing era they were usually either arrangements of popular songs or they were entirely new compositions. [[Duke Ellington]]'s and [[Billy Strayhorn]]'s arrangements for the Duke Ellington big band were usually new compositions, and some of [[Eddie Sauter]]'s arrangements for the [[Benny Goodman]] band and [[Artie Shaw]]'s arrangements for his own band were new compositions as well. It became more common to arrange sketchy jazz combo compositions for big band after the bop era. 

After 1950, the big band trend declined in number. However, several bands continued and arrangers provided renowned arrangements. [[Gil Evans]] wrote a number of large-ensemble arrangements in the late fifties and early sixties intended for recording sessions only.  Other arrangers of note include [[Vic Schoen]], [[Pete Rugolo]], [[Oliver Nelson]], [[Johnny Richards]], [[Billy May]], [[Thad Jones]], [[Maria Schneider (musician)|Maria Schneider]], [[Bob Brookmeyer]], [[Steve Sample, Sr]], [[Lou Marini]], [[Nelson Riddle]], [[Ralph Burns]], [[Billy Byers]], [[Gordon Jenkins]], [[Ray Conniff]], [[Henry Mancini]], [[Gil Evans]], [[Gordon Goodwin]], and [[Ray Reach]].

The '''Athanasian Creed''' (''Quicumque vult'') is a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Creed|statement of belief]], focusing on [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] doctrine and [[Christology]]. The [[Latin]] name of the creed, ''Quicumque vult'', is taken from the [[Incipit|opening words]], &quot;Whosoever wishes.&quot; The Athanasian Creed has been used by Christian churches since the sixth century. It is the first creed in which the equality of the three persons of the Trinity is explicitly stated, and differs from the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene-Constantinopolitan]] and [[Apostles' Creed]]s in the inclusion of [[anathema]]s, or condemnations of those who disagree with the Creed (like the [[Nicene Creed#The original Nicene Creed of 325|original Nicene Creed]]).

Widely accepted&lt;ref name=&quot;online&quot;&gt;Phillip Schaff, ''The Creeds of Chistendom,'' (Harper Brothers, 1877) 1.4.5; available [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.iv.v.html online] (retrieved May 4, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; among [[Western Christianity|Western Christians]], including the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Communion]], the Lutheran Church and most [[liturgical]] [[Protestant]] denominations, the Athanasian Creed has been used in public worship less and less frequently.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The creed has never gained much acceptance in liturgy among [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;online&quot;/&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-compact.svg||thumb|right|The [[Shield of the Trinity]], a visual representation of the doctrine of the Trinity, derived from the Athanasian Creed.  The Latin reads: &quot;The Father is God, The Son is God, The Holy Spirit is God; God is the Father, God is the Son, God is the Holy Spirit; The Father is not the Son, The Son is not the Father, The Father is not the Holy Spirit, The Holy Spirit is not the Father, The Son is not the Holy Spirit, The Holy Spirit is not the Son.&quot;]]
A medieval account credited [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], the famous defender of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicene theology]], as the author of the Creed. According to this account, Athanasius composed it during his exile in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and presented it to [[Pope Julius I]] as a witness to his orthodoxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;online&quot;/&gt; This traditional attribution of the Creed to Athanasius was first called into question in 1642 by Dutch Protestant theologian [[Gerhard Johann Vossius|G.J. Voss]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael O 1987&quot;&gt;Michael O'Carroll, &quot;Athanasian Creed&quot; in ''Trinitas,'' (Wilmington, Delaware:Michael Glazier, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; and it has since been widely accepted by modern scholars that the creed was not authored by Athanasius.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frederick W. Norris 1997&quot;&gt;Frederick W. Norris, &quot;Athanasian Creed&quot; in ''Encyclopedia of Early Christianity'', 2nd edition, ed. Everett Fergusen (New York:Garland, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Athanasius' name seems to have become attached to the creed as a sign of its strong declaration of Trinitarian faith.  The reasoning for rejecting Athanasius as the author usually relies on a combination of the following:
# The creed originally was most likely written in Latin, while Athanasius composed in Greek.
# Neither Athanasius nor his contemporaries ever mention the Creed.
# It is not mentioned in any records of the [[ecumenical councils]].
# It appears to address theological concerns that developed after Athanasius died (including the [[filioque]]).
# It was most widely circulated among [[Western Christianity|Western Christians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael O 1987&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Concordia Triglotta,'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26909/26909.txt Historical Introductions to the Symbolical Books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church], St. Louis, MO: Concordia Publishing House, 1921, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the Creed in a sermon by [[Caesarius of Arles]], as well as a theological resemblance to works by [[Vincent of Lérins]], point to Southern [[Gaul]] as its origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frederick W. Norris 1997&quot;/&gt; The most likely time frame is in the late fifth or early sixth century AD – at least 100 years after Athanasius. The [[Christian theology|theology]] of the creed is firmly rooted in the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian tradition]], using exact terminology of Augustine's ''On the Trinity'' (published 415 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Philip Schaff, ''History of the Christian Church'', vol. 3 (Charles Scribner, 1910) available [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc3.iii.xii.xvi.html online] (retrieved May 7, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, there was a great deal of speculation about who might have authored the creed, with suggestions including [[Ambrose of Milan]], [[Venantius Fortunatus]], and [[Hilary of Poitiers]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;See Samuel Macauley Jackson, et. al. eds., ''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religion'', (1914) &quot;Athanasian Creed,&quot; ([http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc01.html?term=Athanasian%20Creed online]) for examples of various theories of authorship.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1940 discovery of a lost work by [[Vincent of Lérins]], which bears a striking similarity to much of the language of the Athanasian Creed, have led many to conclude that the creed originated either with Vincent or with his students.&lt;ref&gt;Athanasian Creed. (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved May 07, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/40585/Athanasian-Creed.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the authoritative modern monograph about the creed, [[J.N.D. Kelly]] asserts that Vincent of Lérin was not its author, but that it may have come from the same milieu, namely the area of Lérins in southern Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.D. Kelly, ''The Athanasian Creed'', NY: Harper and Row, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;  The oldest surviving manuscripts of the Athanasian Creed date from the late 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Celia Chazelle|title=Archbishops Ebo and Hincmar of Reims and the Utrecht Psalter|journal=Speculum|volume=72|issue=4|date=October 1997|pages=1056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The Athanasian Creed is usually divided into two sections: lines 1–28 addressing the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], and lines 29–44 addressing the doctrine of [[Christology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ShaffDivision&quot;&gt;[[Philip Schaff]] uses this classic division in his consideration of the Creed: ''The Creeds of Chistendom,'' (Harper Brothers, 1877) 1.4.5; available [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.iv.v.html online] (retrieved May 4, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Enumerating the three persons of the Trinity (i.e., [[God the Father#Christianity|Father]], the [[Christian views of Jesus|Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit]]), the first section of the creed ascribes the [[divine attribute]]s to each individually. Thus, each person of the Trinity is described as uncreated (''increatus''), limitless (''Immensus''), eternal (''æternus''), and omnipotent (''omnipotens'').&lt;ref&gt;Athanasian Creed, lines 8,9,10, and 13, respectively. See the side by side English and Latin in vol. 2 of Shaff's ''The Creeds of Christendom,'' [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds2.iv.i.iv.html online)]&lt;/ref&gt; While ascribing the divine attributes and divinity to each person of the Trinity, thus avoiding [[subordinationism]], the first half of the Athanasian Creed also stresses the unity of the three persons in the one Godhead, thus avoiding a theology of [[tritheism]]. Furthermore, although one God, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct from each other. For the Father is neither made nor begotten; the Son is not made but is begotten from the Father; the Holy Spirit is neither made nor begotten but proceeds from the Father and the Son ([[filioque]]).

The text of the Athanasian Creed is as follows:

''Quicumque vult salvus esse, ante omnia opus est, ut teneat catholicam fidem: Quam nisi quisque integram inviolatamque servaverit, absque dubio in aeternum peribit. Fides autem catholica haec est: ut unum Deum in Trinitate, et Trinitatem in unitate veneremur. Neque confundentes personas, neque substantiam separantes. Alia est enim persona Patris alia Filii, alia Spiritus Sancti: Sed Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti una est divinitas, aequalis gloria, coeterna maiestas. Qualis Pater, talis Filius, talis [et] Spiritus Sanctus. Increatus Pater, increatus Filius, increatus [et] Spiritus Sanctus. Immensus Pater, immensus Filius, immensus [et] Spiritus Sanctus. Aeternus Pater, aeternus Filius, aeternus [et] Spiritus Sanctus. Et tamen non tres aeterni, sed unus aeternus. Sicut non tres increati, nec tres immensi, sed unus increatus, et unus immensus. Similiter omnipotens Pater, omnipotens Filius, omnipotens [et] Spiritus Sanctus. Et tamen non tres omnipotentes, sed unus omnipotens. Ita Deus Pater, Deus Filius, Deus [et] Spiritus Sanctus. Et tamen non tres dii, sed unus est Deus. Ita Dominus Pater, Dominus Filius, Dominus [et] Spiritus Sanctus. Et tamen non tres Domini, sed unus [est] Dominus. Quia, sicut singillatim unamquamque personam Deum ac Dominum confiteri christiana veritate compellimur: Ita tres Deos aut [tres] Dominos dicere catholica religione prohibemur. Pater a nullo est factus: nec creatus, nec genitus. Filius a Patre solo est: non factus, nec creatus, sed genitus. Spiritus Sanctus a Patre et Filio: non factus, nec creatus, nec genitus, sed procedens. Unus ergo Pater, non tres Patres: unus Filius, non tres Filii: unus Spiritus Sanctus, non tres Spiritus Sancti. Et in hac Trinitate nihil prius aut posterius, nihil maius aut minus: Sed totae tres personae coaeternae sibi sunt et coaequales. Ita, ut per omnia, sicut iam supra dictum est, et unitas in Trinitate, et Trinitas in unitate veneranda sit. Qui vult ergo salvus esse, ita de Trinitate sentiat.''

''Sed necessarium est ad aeternam salutem, ut incarnationem quoque Domini nostri Iesu Christi fideliter credat. Est ergo fides recta ut credamus et confiteamur, quia Dominus noster Iesus Christus, Dei Filius, Deus [pariter] et homo est. Deus [est] ex substantia Patris ante saecula genitus: et homo est ex substantia matris in saeculo natus. Perfectus Deus, perfectus homo: ex anima rationali et humana carne subsistens. Aequalis Patri secundum divinitatem: minor Patre secundum humanitatem. Qui licet Deus sit et homo, non duo tamen, sed unus est Christus. Unus autem non conversione divinitatis in carnem, sed assumptione humanitatis in Deum. Unus omnino, non confusione substantiae, sed unitate personae. Nam sicut anima rationalis et caro unus est homo: ita Deus et homo unus est Christus. Qui passus est pro salute nostra: descendit ad inferos: tertia die resurrexit a mortuis. Ascendit ad [in] caelos, sedet ad dexteram [Dei] Patris [omnipotentis]. Inde venturus [est] judicare vivos et mortuos. Ad cujus adventum omnes homines resurgere habent cum corporibus suis; Et reddituri sunt de factis propriis rationem. Et qui bona egerunt, ibunt in vitam aeternam: qui vero mala, in ignem aeternum. Haec est fides catholica, quam nisi quisque fideliter firmiterque crediderit, salvus esse non poterit.''

Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic Faith.
Which Faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled; without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.
And the catholic Faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity;  Neither confounding the Persons; nor dividing the Essence.
For there is one Person of the Father; another of the Son; and another of the Holy Ghost.
But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all one; the Glory equal, the Majesty coeternal.
Such as the Father is; such is the Son; and such is the Holy Ghost.
The Father uncreated; the Son uncreated; and the Holy Ghost uncreated.
The Father unlimited; the Son unlimited; and the Holy Ghost unlimited.
The Father eternal; the Son eternal; and the Holy Ghost eternal.
And yet they are not three eternals; but one eternal.
As also there are not three uncreated; nor three infinites, but one uncreated; and one infinite.
So likewise the Father is Almighty; the Son Almighty; and the Holy Ghost Almighty.
And yet they are not three Almighties; but one Almighty.
So the Father is God; the Son is God; and the Holy Ghost is God.
And yet they are not three Gods; but one God.
So likewise the Father is Lord; the Son Lord; and the Holy Ghost Lord.
And yet not three Lords; but one Lord.
For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity; to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord;
So are we forbidden by the Catholic Religion; to say, There are three Gods, or three Lords.
The Father is made of none; neither created, nor begotten.
The Son is of the Father alone; not made, nor created; but begotten.
The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten; but proceeding.
So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts.
And in this Trinity none is before, or after another; none is greater, or less than another.
But the whole three Persons are coeternal, and coequal.
So that in all things, as aforesaid; the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity, is to be worshipped.
He therefore that will be saved, let him thus think of the Trinity.

Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation; that he also believe faithfully the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess; that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man;
God, of the Essence of the Father; begotten before the worlds; and Man, of the Essence of his Mother, born in the world.
Perfect God; and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting.
Equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead; and inferior to the Father as touching his Manhood.
Who although he is God and Man; yet he is not two, but one Christ.
One; not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh; but by assumption of the Manhood into God.
One altogether; not by confusion of Essence; but by unity of Person.
For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man; so God and Man is one Christ;
Who suffered for our salvation; descended into hell; rose again the third day from the dead.
He ascended into heaven, he sitteth on the right hand of the God the Father Almighty, from whence he will come to judge the quick and the dead.
At whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies; And shall give account for their own works.
And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting; and they that have done evil, into everlasting fire.
This is the catholic Faith; which except a man believe truly and firmly, he cannot be saved.

Didactic as its content appears to contemporary readers, its opening sets out the essential principle that the Catholic faith does not consist in the first place in assent to propositions, but 'that we ''worship'' One God in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity'. All else flows from that orientation.

The Christology of the second section is more detailed than that of the Nicene Creed, and reflects the teaching of the [[First Council of Ephesus]] (431) and the definition of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451). The 'Athanasian' Creed boldly uses the key Nicene term ''[[homoousios]]'' ('one substance', 'one in Being') not only with respect to the relation of the Son to the Father according to his divine nature, but that the Son is ''homoousios'' with his mother Mary, according to his human nature.

The Creed's wording thus excludes not only [[Sabellianism]] and [[Arianism]], but the Christological heresies of [[Nestorianism]] and [[Eutychianism]]. A need for a clear confession against Arianism arose in western Europe when the [[Ostrogoths]] and [[Visigoths]], who had Arian beliefs, invaded at the beginning of the 5th century.

The final section of this Creed also moved beyond the Nicene (and Apostles') Creeds in making negative statements about the people's fate: &quot;They that have done good shall go into life everlasting: and they that have done evil into everlasting fire.&quot; This caused considerable debate in England in the mid-nineteenth century, centred around the teaching of [[Frederick Denison Maurice]].

Composed of 44 rhythmic lines, the Athanasian Creed appears to have been intended as a liturgical document – that is, the original purpose of the creed was to be spoken or sung as a part of worship.&lt;ref name=&quot;online&quot; /&gt;  The creed itself uses the language of public worship, speaking of the worship of God rather than the language of belief (&quot;Now this is the catholic faith: We worship one God&quot;).  In the [[Catholic Church]] in medieval times, this creed was recited following the Sunday sermon or at the Sunday Office of [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Pfatteicher 1990 p. 444&quot;&gt;Philip Pfatteicher, ''Commentary on the Lutheran Book of Worship,'' (Minneapolis:Augsburg, 1990), p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; The creed was often set to music and used in the place of a Psalm.

Early [[Protestant]]s inherited the late medieval devotion to the Athanasian Creed, and it was considered to be authoritative in many Protestant churches.  The statements of Protestant belief (confessional documents) of various Reformers commend the Athanasian Creed to their followers, including the [[Augsburg Confession]], the [[Formula of Concord]], the [[Second Helvetic Confession]], the [[Belgic Confession]], the [[Bohemian Confession]] and the [[Thirty-nine Articles]].&lt;ref&gt;''Augusburg Confession,'' art. 1 references the Nicene Creed, but uses the language of the Athanasian: e.g., &quot;There are three persons, coeternal and of the same essence and power.&quot; ''Formula of Concord,'' Solid Declaration, Summary 2.  ''Second Helvetic Confession'', Chapter 11.  ''Belgic Confession'', Article 9.  ''39 Articles'', article 8.  ''Bohemian Confession'' (1575), Article of faith 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Among modern Lutheran and Reformed churches adherence to the Athanasian Creed is prescribed by the earlier confessional documents, but the creed does not receive much attention outside of occasional use – especially on [[Trinity Sunday]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Pfatteicher 1990 p. 444&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example: the congregational [http://www.lcms.org/graphics/assets/media/CCM/GUIDELINES%20for%20Web.pdf constitution guidelines] (pdf) for the [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod]], and the [http://www.rca.org/Page.aspx?pid=299 beliefs] of the [[Reformed Church in America]] (both retrieved May 6, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Reformed circles, it is included (for example) in the Christian Reformed Churches of Australia's Book of Forms (publ. 1991). That said, it is rarely recited in public worship.

In the successive Books of Common Prayer of the reformed Church of England from 1549 to 1662, its recitation was provided for on 19 occasions each year, a practice which continued until the nineteenth century, when vigorous controversy regarding its statement about 'eternal damnation' saw its use gradually decline. It remains one of the three Creeds approved in the Thirty-Nine Articles, and is printed in several current Anglican prayer books (e.g. A Prayer Book for Australia (1995)). As with Roman Catholic practice, its use is now generally only on Trinity Sunday or its octave.

In Roman Catholic churches, it was traditionally said at [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]] on Sundays after Epiphany and Pentecost, except when a Double feast or day within an octave occurred, and on Trinity Sunday. In the 1960 reforms, it was reduced to once a year on [[Trinity Sunday]]. It has been effectively dropped from the Catholic liturgy since the [[Second Vatican Council]]. It is however maintained in the ''Forma Extraordinaria'', per the decree [[Summorum Pontificum]], and also in the rite of exorcism, both in the ''Forma Ordinaria'' and the ''Forma Extraordinaria'' of the Roman Rite.

In [[Lutheranism]], the Athanasian Creed is—along with the [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles']] and [[Nicene Creed]]s—one of the three [[ecumenical creeds]] placed at the beginning of the 1580 [[Book of Concord]], the historic collection of authoritative doctrinal statements (confessions) of the Lutheran church. It is still used in some places in the liturgy on Trinity Sunday.

A common visualisation of the first half of the Creed is the [[Shield of the Trinity]].

'''Alicante''' ({{IPA-es|aliˈkante|lang}}) or '''Alacant''' ({{IPA-ca|alaˈkant|langva}})&lt;ref&gt;Both names are official.&lt;/ref&gt; is a city in [[Spain]], the capital of the [[Province of Alicante]] and of the [[comarca]] of [[Alacantí]], in the south of the [[Valencian Community]]. It is also a historic [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] port. The population of the city of Alicante proper was 334,418, estimated {{as of|2010|lc=on}}, ranking as the second-largest [[Valencian Community|Valencian]] city.&lt;ref name=INE&gt;[http://www.ine.es/en/inebmenu/mnu_cifraspob_en.htm Instituto Nacional de Estadística] Official population figures: Municipal Register.&lt;/ref&gt;  Including nearby municipalities, Alicante [[conurbation]] was populated by 458,843 residents.&lt;ref&gt;The conurbation includes Alicante, [[San Vicente del Raspeig]], [[San Juan de Alicante]], [[Mutxamel]] and [[El Campello]].&lt;/ref&gt; Population of the [[metropolitan area]] (including [[Elche]] and satellite towns) was 769,284 {{as of|2010|lc=on}} estimates, ranking as the eighth-largest [[List of metropolitan areas in Spain by population|metropolitan area of Spain]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Alicante}}

The area around Alicante has been inhabited for over 7000 years, with the first tribes of [[hunter gatherer]]s moving down gradually from Central Europe between 5000 and 3000 BC. Some of the earliest settlements were made on the slopes of [[Mount Benacantil]]. By 1000 BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Phoenicia]]n traders had begun to visit the eastern coast of Spain, establishing small trading ports and introducing the native Iberian tribes to the alphabet, iron and the pottery wheel. By the 3th century BC, the rival armies of [[Carthage]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] began to invade and fight for control of the Iberian Peninsula. The Carthaginian general [[Hamilcar Barca]] established the fortified settlement of Akra Leuka ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|Aκρα Λευκa}}, meaning &quot;White Mountain&quot; or &quot;White Point&quot;), where Alicante stands today.

[[File:Tossal-plantagral.jpg|thumb|left|Archeological site of Tossal de Manises, ancient [[Iberians|Iberian]]-[[Carthaginian]]-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city of &quot;Akra-Leuke&quot; or &quot;[[Lucentum]]&quot;.]]

Although the Carthaginians conquered much of the land around Alicante, the Romans would eventually rule [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] for over 700 years. By the 5th century AD, Rome was in decline; the Roman predecessor town of Alicante, known as ''[[Lucentum]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]), was more or less under the control of the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] warlord [[Theudimer]]. However neither the Romans nor the Goths put up much resistance to the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Arab conquest]] of ''Medina Laqant'' in the 8th century. The Moors ruled southern and eastern Spain until the 11th century ''[[reconquista]]'' (reconquest). Alicante was finally taken in 1246 by the Castilian king [[Alfonso X]], but it passed soon and definitely to the [[Kingdom of Valencia]] in 1298 with the King [[James II of Aragon]]. It gained the status of Royal Village (''Vila Reial'') with representation in the medieval [[Corts Valencianes|Valencian Parliament]].

[[File:Alacant, gravat d'Alfred Guesdon (1808-1876), ca. 1832.jpg|thumb|left|Alicante around year 1832. Engraving by Alfred Guesdon.]]

After several decades of being the battlefield where [[Kingdom of Castile]] and the [[Crown of Aragón]] clashed, Alicante became a major Mediterranean trading station exporting rice, wine, olive oil, oranges and wool. But between 1609 and 1614 [[Philip III of Spain|King Felipe III]] expelled thousands of [[morisco]]s who had remained in Valencia after the reconquista, due to their allegiance with [[Barbary pirates]] who continually attacked coastal cities and caused much harm to trade. This act cost the region dearly; with so many skilled artisans and agricultural labourers gone, the feudal nobility found itself sliding into bankruptcy. Things got worse in the early 18th century; after the [[War of Spanish Succession]], Alicante went into a long, slow decline, surviving through the 18th and 19th centuries by making shoes and growing agricultural produce such as oranges and almonds, and thanks to its fisheries. The end of the 19th century witnessed a sharp recovery of the local economy with increasing international trade and the growth of the city harbour leading to increased exports of several products (particularly during [[World War I]] when Spain was a neutral country).

During the early 20th century, Alicante was a minor capital which enjoyed the benefit of Spain's neutrality during [[World War I]], which provided new opportunities for the local industry and agriculture. The [[Rif War (1920)|Rif War]] in the 1920s saw numerous ''alicantinos'' drafted to fight in the long and bloody campaigns in the former Spanish protectorate (Northern Morocco) against the Rif rebels. The political unrest of the late 1920s led to the victory of republican candidates in local council elections throughout the country, and the abdication of King Alfonso XIII. The proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was much celebrated in the city on 14 April 1931. The [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out on 17 July 1936. Alicante was the last city loyal to the Republican government to be occupied by dictator Franco's troops on 1 April 1939, and its harbour saw the last Republican government officials fleeing the country. Even if not as famous as the [[bombing of Guernica]] by the German Luftwaffe, Alicante was the target of some vicious air bombings during the three years of civil conflict, most remarkably the bombing by the Italian ''[[Aviazione Legionaria]]'' of the Mercado de Abastos in 25 May 1938 in which more than 300 civilians perished.

[[File:Alicante.jpg|thumb|left|Monjas-Santa Faz Square.]]

The next 20 years under Franco's dictatorship were difficult for Alicante as it was for the entire country. However, the late 1950s and early 1960s saw the onset of a lasting transformation of the city due to tourism. Large buildings and complexes rose in nearby Albufereta and Playa de San Juan, with the benign climate being the best tool to bring prospective buyers and tourists who kept hotels reasonably busy. The tourist development, aside from construction, also brought numerous businesses such as restaurants, bars and other activities focused on visitors. Also, the old airfield at Rabasa was closed and air traffic moved to the new [[El Altet Airport]], which made for a convenient facility for charter flights bringing tourists from northern European countries.

[[File:Luceros3.jpg|thumb|Luceros Square.]]

When dictator Franco died in 1975, his successor [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]] oversaw the transition of Spain to a democratic constitutional monarchy. Governments of nationalities and regions were given more autonomy, including the Valencian region.

The [[port of Alicante]] has been reinventing itself since the industrial decline the city suffered in the 1980s (with most mercantile traffic lost in favour of Valencia's harbour). In recent years, the Port Authority has established it as one of the most important ports in Spain for cruises, with 72 calls to port made by cruise ships in 2007 bringing some 80,000 passengers and 30,000 crew to the city each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama-actual.es/noticias/not226759.htm |title=El puerto de Alicante registrará 72 escalas de cruceros durante 2007 |publisher=Diariocrítico de la Comunidad Valenciana |language=Spanish |date=2007-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moves to develop the port for more tourism have been welcomed by the city and its residents, but the latest plans to develop an industrial estate in the port have caused great controversy.

==Economy==
[[File:Alicante mit AIDAaura.jpg|thumb|left|[[Port of Alicante|Alicante harbour]].]]

Alicante is one of the fastest-growing cities in Spain. The local economy is based upon tourism directed to the beaches of the ''[[Costa Blanca]]'' and particularly the second residence construction boom which started in the 1960s and reinvigorated again by the late 1990s. [[Tertiary sector|Services]] and public administration also play a major role in the city's economy. The construction boom has raised many environmental concerns and both the local autonomous government and city council are under scrutiny by the European Union. The construction surge is the subject of hot debates among politicians and citizens alike. The latest of many public battles concerns the plans of the Port Authority of Alicante to construct an industrial estate on reclaimed land in front of the city's coastal strip, in breach of local, national and European regulations. (See [[Port of Alicante]] for the details).

The city is the headquarters of the [[Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market]] and a sizeable population of European public workers live here.

[[University of Alicante]] is located in [[San Vicente del Raspeig]], right next to Alicante. More than 25,000 students attend the University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memoria.ua.es/es/comunidad-universitaria/alumnado.html Annual Report for academic year 2008-09.] University of Alicante. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005 Alicante hosts [[:es:Ciudad de la Luz|Ciudad de la Luz]], one of the largest film studios in Europe. Spanish and international movies such as [[Asterix at the Olympic Games (film)|Asterix at the Olympic Games]] by Frédéric Forestier and Thomas Langmann, [[Manolete (film)|Manolete]] by [[Menno Meyjes]] have been shot there.

==Population==
[[File:Demografía Alicante (España).PNG|thumb|right|Demographics of Alicante (1900-2007, [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística (Spain)|INE]] data). ]]

The official population of Alicante in 2010 was 334,418 inhabitants and 769,284 in the metropolitan area &quot;Alicante-[[Elche]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;INE&quot;/&gt; About 15% of the population is foreign, mostly those from [[Argentina]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Colombia]] who have arrived in the previous 10 years as immigrants. There are also immigrants from other origins such as [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Morocco]], many of which are under illegal alien status and therefore are not accounted for in official population figures. The real percentage of foreign population is higher, since the Alicante metropolitan area is home to many Northern European retired citizens, even if officially they are still residents of their own countries. In the same pattern, a sizable amount of permanent residents are Spanish nationals who officially still live in [[Madrid]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque provinces]], or other areas of the country.

==Government==
[[File:Alicante Spain townhall.jpg|thumb|right|Alicante City Hall]]

[[Sonia Castedo]] (born in 1971) is the mayor of the city. She was elected for the post in an extraordinary plenary of the Alicante City Council on September 17, 2008, following resignation of [[Luis Díaz Alperi]]. She is the first woman ever to occupy this position.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/espana/noticias/755344/09/08/Sonia-Castedo-toma-posesion-como-alcaldesa-de-Alicante-la-primera-mujer-en-ocupar-el-cargo-y-demanda-inversiones.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latest municipal elections of May 2011, [[Sonia Castedo]] (1971) of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (''Partido Popular'') won the elections with an [[absolute majority]], larger than the one the former major (Luis Díaz Alperi) had, while the oposition (Socialist Party) reduced their popular support.

At the foot of the main staircase of the City Hall Building (''[[Ayuntamiento]]'') is the zero point (''cota cero''), used as the point of reference for measuring the height above or below sea level of any point in Spain, due to the marginal tidal variations of the Mediterranean sea in Alicante.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alicante-ayto.es/cultura/edificios_singulares/ayuntamiento_alicante.html Ayuntamiento de Alicante, Edificios Singulares] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Alicante enjoys a [[Mediterranean climate]] with mild temperatures throughout the year and little rain, concentrated in equinoctial periods. On average the temperature ranges between {{convert|16.8|°C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|6.2|°C|0|abbr=on}} in January and {{convert|30.6|°C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|20.4|°C|0|abbr=on}} in August, with an average annual temperature of {{convert|17.8|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Daily oscillations in temperature are very small due to the influence of the sea, although occasional periods of Westerly wind can result in temperature ranges in excess of {{convert|15|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Annual oscillations in temperature are also small meaning that winters are mild and summers are warm.

The average amount of rainfall is {{convert|336|mm|1|abbr=on}} per year. September and October are the wettest months due to torrential rain caused by the [[cold drop]], which can reach over 200&amp;nbsp;mm in a single 24 hour period causing severe flooding. Because of this irregularity, only 37 rainy days are observed on average per year, and the annual number of sunshine hours is 2,864.

The record maximum temperature of {{convert|41.4|°C|0|abbr=on}} was observed in Alicante on 4 July 1994. The record minimum temperature of {{convert|-4.6|°C|0|abbr=on}} was registered on 12 February 1956. The worst flooding in modern history occurred on 30 September 1997 when {{convert|270.2|mm|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall fell within six hours.

==Main sights==
[[File:SantaBarbara2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Benacantil]] and [[Castle of Santa Bárbara]].]]
[[File:Carbonell.jpg|thumb|right|Esplanada and Carbonell House.]]
[[File:Explanada de España.jpg|thumb|upright|Esplanada de España.]]

Amongst the most notable features of the city are the [[Castle of Santa Bárbara]], which sits high above the city, and the [[port of Alicante]].  The latter was the subject of bitter controversy in 2006-2007 as residents battled to keep it from being changed into an industrial estate.

The [[Castle of Santa Bárbara|Santa Bárbara castle]] is situated on [[Mount Benacantil]], overlooking the city. The promenade ''Explanada de España'', lined by palm trees, consists of 6.5 million marble stones and is one of the most lovely promenades in Spain. For the people of Alicante, it is the meeting point in the evenings and a place where many concerts take place. At the end of the promenade is a monument by the artist Mark Hersch, who still lives in the city. The main church of Alicante and the bishop's seat is [[San Nicolas Cathedral, Alicante|Concatedral de San Nicolás de Bari]], which was begun in the 17th century.

El Palmeral Park is one of favorite parks of Alicante. It includes walking trails, children's playgrounds, ponds and brooks, picnic tables and an auditorium for concerts. El Ereta Park is located on [[Mount Benacantil]]. It runs from the Santa Bárbara castle down to the old part of Alicante.

Just a few kilometers from Alicante, on the Mediterranean Sea, lies [[Tabarca]] island. What was once a slip angle for pirates, is now a beautiful tourist attraction.

Other sights include:
*[[Basilica of Santa Maria, Alicante|Basilica of Santa María]] (14th-16th centuries), built in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style over the former main mosque. Other features include the high altar, in Rococo style, and the portal, in [[Baroque]] style, both from the 18th century.
*[[San Nicolas Cathedral, Alicante|Co-cathedral of St. Nicholas of Bari]] (15th-18th centuries), also built over a mosque.
*Monastery of ''Santa Faz'' (15th century), located 5&amp;nbsp;km outside the city, in [[Baroque style]].
*Defence towers of the ''Huerta de Alicante '' (15th-18th centuries), built to defend against the [[Barbary pirates]]. Today some 20 towers are still extant.
*Baroque ''Casa de La Asegurada'' (1685), the most ancient civil building in the city. (s. XVII). Today is home to the Museum of Contemporary Art of Alicante.
*''Casa consistorial de Alicante'' (18th century), also in Baroque style.
*Convent of the ''Canónigas de San Agustín'' (18th century).
*Gravina Palace (1748–1808), nowadays hosting [[Gravina Museum of Fine Arts]].
*Castle of San Fernando.

There are a dozen of museums in Alicante. On exhibition at the [[Archaeological Museum of Alicante]] are local artifacts dating from 100,000 years ago until 19th century. The archaeological museum won the [[European Museum of the Year Award]] in 2004. [[Gravina Museum of Fine Arts]] presents a number of painting and sculptures of Alicante from the 16th century to 19th century. [[Asegurada Museum of Contemporary Art]] houses a major collection of twentieth-century art, mainly composed of works donated by [[:es:Eusebio Sempere|Eusebio Sempere]].

==Festivals==
[[File:Castillo Sta Barbara.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Castle of Santa Bárbara]] and Postiguet beach at the final night of [[Bonfires of Saint John|Bonfires of Saint John's festival]].]]

The most important festival, the ''[[Bonfires of Saint John]]'' (''Fogueres de Sant Joan''), takes place during the summer [[solstice]]. This is followed a week later by seven nights of firework and pyrotechnic contests between companies on the urban beach ''Playa del Postiguet''. Another well-known festival is ''[[Moros i Cristians]]'' in Altozano or ''San Blas'' district.

'''Ann Noreen Widdecombe''' (born 4 October 1947) is a former [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] [[politician]] and has been a [[novelist]] since 2000. She is a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillor]] and was the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Maidstone (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone]] from 1987 to 1997 and for [[Maidstone and The Weald (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone and The Weald]] from 1997 to 2010. She was a [[social conservative]] and a member of the [[Conservative Christian Fellowship]]. She retired from politics at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]]. Since 2002 she has also made numerous television and radio appearances, including as a [[television presenter]]. She is a convert from [[Anglicanism]] to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Bath, Somerset]], Widdecombe is the daughter of a [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] [[civil servant]] James Murray Widdecombe and Rita N Plummer . She attended the Royal Navy School, [[Singapore]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCRet&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7032992.stm Ann Widdecombe set to stand down]; ''[[BBC News]]'', 7 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[convent]] school in Bath. She then read [[Latin]] at [[Birmingham University]] and later attended [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]], to read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE). She worked for [[Unilever]] (1973–75) and then as an administrator at the [[University of London]] (1975–87) before entering Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annwiddecombe.com/text.aspx?id=52|title=About Ann|publisher=annwiddecombe.com|accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Councillor===
From 1976 to 1978, Widdecombe was a  [[councillor]] for [[Runnymede (borough)|Runnymede District]] in Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/nov/03/uk.conservatives|title=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/nov/03/uk.conservatives|date=3 November 2003|work=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=2008-12-06 | location=London | first=Jackie | last=Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt; She contested the seat of [[Burnley (UK Parliament constituency)|Burnley]] in [[Lancashire]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]] and then,  against [[David Owen]], the [[Plymouth Devonport (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Devonport]] seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge79/i04.htm|title=UK General Election results May 1979|date=3 May 1979|work=Political Science Resources|publisher=Richard Kimber|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060925040210/http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge79/i04.htm|archivedate=2006-09-25|accessdate=2008-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge83/i16.htm|title=UK General Election results June 1983|date=9 June 1983|work=Political Science Resources|publisher=Richard Kimber|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080320065802/http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge83/i16.htm|archivedate=2008-03-20|accessdate=2008-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member of Parliament==
She was first elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]] as member for the constituency of [[Maidstone (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone]] (which became [[Maidstone and The Weald (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone and The Weald]] in 1997).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/guide/seat-profiles/maidstoneandtheweald Maidstone and The Weald], UKPollingReport&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views===
As an MP Widdecombe has expressed conservative views, including opposition to [[abortion]]; it was understood during her time in frontline politics that she would not become [[Secretary of State for Health|Health Secretary]] as long as this involved responsibility for abortions. Although a committed Christian, she has characterised the issue as one of life and death on which her view had been the same when she was [[agnostic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/280692.stm| work=BBC News | title=Ann Widdecombe answers your questions | date=1999-02-16 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[John Gummer]] MP, she converted from the [[Church of England]] to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] following the decision of the Church of England on the [[Ordination of women]] as priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/112152.stm | work=BBC News | title=Widdecombe rejects abortion role | date=1998-06-13 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her speech at the 2000 Conservative conference, she called for a [[zero tolerance]] policy of prosecution, albeit with only £100 fines as the punishment, for users of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. This was well-received by rank-and-file Conservative delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2000/oct/06/drugsandalcohol.conservatives2000|title=Widdecombe fights back firm|last=Watt|first=Nicholas|date=200-10-06|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-08-22 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, together with fellow Roman Catholic MP [[Edward Leigh]], Widdecombe proposed an amendment opposing repeal of [[Section 28]] of the [[Local Government Act 1988|Local Government Act]], which banned the promotion of homosexuality by local governments. Out of the 17 parliamentary votes considered by the [[Public Whip]] website to concern equal rights for homosexuals, Widdecombe took the opposing position in 15 cases, not being present at the other two votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?mpid=1701&amp;dmp=826 &quot;Ann Widdecombe compared to 'Homosexuality - Equal rights'&quot;], [[Public Whip]]. Retrieved on 2009-06-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

She is a committed animal lover and one of the few Conservative MPs to have consistently voted for the ban on [[fox hunting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?mpid=1701&amp;dmp=1050 &quot;Ann Widdecombe compared to 'Fox hunting - Ban'&quot;], [[Public Whip]]. Retrieved on 2009-03-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

She has expressed a variety of views on [[climate change]] but has been opposed to legislation reducing emissions. Her views on the subject appear to have hardened over time. In 2007, she wrote that she did not want to belittle the issue but was sceptical of the claims that specific actions would prevent catastrophe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/2489/Switching-lightbulbs-won-t-save-the-world Switching Lightbulbs won't change the world]&lt;/ref&gt; then in 2008 that her doubts had been “crystalised” by Nigel Lawson's book ''[[An Appeal to Reason]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/ourcomments/view/48856 Yes, I am a heretic on global warming]&lt;/ref&gt; before stating in 2009 that &quot;There is no climate change, hasn’t anybody looked out of their window recently?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/79580/Now-the-EU-wants-to-ban-your-plasma-television Article including refutation of any global warming]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In government===
Widdecombe joined [[John Major]]'s government as [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] for Social Security in 1990. In 1993, she was moved to the [[Department of Employment]], and she was promoted to [[Minister of State]] the following year. In 1995, she joined the [[Home Office]] as Minister of State for Prisons and visited every prison in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/talking_politics/104160.stm|title=Ann Widdecombe - political sketch |publisher=BBC Online |accessdate=17 June 2009 |date=2 June 1998 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Conservative government to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] in 1997, she served as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Health|Shadow Health Secretary]] between 1998 and 1999 and later as [[Shadow Home Secretary]] between 1999 and 2001 under [[William Hague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/person/5516/ann-widdecombe|title=Ann Widdecombe: Electoral history and profile|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-08-22 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership contest and backbenches===
During the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2001|2001 Conservative leadership election]], she could not find sufficient support amongst Conservative MPs for her leadership candidacy. She first supported [[Michael Ancram]], who was eliminated in the first round, and then [[Kenneth Clarke]], who lost in the final round. She afterwards declined to serve in [[Shadow Cabinet of Iain Duncan Smith|Iain Duncan Smith's Shadow Cabinet]] (although she indicated on the television programme ''Ann Widdecombe's Weird Weekend'' with [[Louis Theroux]], prior to the leadership contest, that she wished to retire to the [[backbenches]] anyway).

In the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005|2005 leadership election]], she initially supported Kenneth Clarke again. Once he was eliminated, she turned support towards [[Liam Fox]]. Following Fox's subsequent elimination, she took time to reflect before finally declaring for [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]]. She expressed reservations over the eventual winner [[David Cameron]], feeling that he did not, like the other candidates, have a proven track record, and she was later a leading figure in parliamentary opposition to his A-List policy, which she has said is &quot;an insult to women&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1221684/David-Cameron-risks-fury-Tory-grass-roots-plans-women-shortlists.html |title=Cameron cuties: Tory anger as leader calls for all-women MP shortlists |work=Daily Mail | location=London | first=Jason | last=Groves | date=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the October 2006 Conservative Conference, she was Chief Dragon in a political version of the television programme ''[[Dragons' Den]]'', in which A-list candidates were invited to put forward a policy proposal, which was then torn apart by her team of [[Rachel Elnaugh]], [[Oliver Letwin]] and [[Michael Brown (UK politician)|Michael Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/iain_dale/2006/10/when_youve_got_nothing_to_writ.html Taking the media beast to the dragon's den at guardian.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]'' in September 2006 she stated that if Parliament were of a normal length, it was likely she would retire at the next general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Andrew Williams |title=60 Seconds: Ann Widdecombe |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/interviews/article.html?in_article_id=19578&amp;in_page_id=11 |work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] |date=11 September 2006 |accessdate=6 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She confirmed her intention to stand down to ''[[The Observer]]'''s Pendennis diary in September 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendennis&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Oliver Marre |title=Widdy knows the way to a man's heart |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/7days/story/0,,2160786,00.html |work=[[The Observer]] |date=2 September 2007 |accessdate=7 October 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in October 2007 after Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] quashed speculation of an autumn 2007 general election.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7032992.stm |work=BBC News |title=Ann Widdecombe set to stand down | date=8 October 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widdecombe was one of the 98 MPs who voted to keep their expense details secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1816072.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=How your MP voted on the FOI Bill |date=20 May 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the expenses claims were [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|leaked]], however, Widdecombe was described by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as one of the &quot;saints&quot; amongst all MPs.&lt;ref name=TGEx&gt;{{cite news |title = MPs' expenses: The saints (Part i) |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |date= |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5342811/MPs-expenses-The-saints-Part-i.html?image=5 |accessdate=21 June 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, following the resignation of [[Michael Martin (politician)|Michael Martin]] as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]], it was reported that Widdecombe was gathering support for election as interim Speaker until the next general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Speaker: Runners and riders|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8057450.stm |work=[[BBC]] |date=21 May 2009 |accessdate=21 May 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 June 2009, she confirmed her bid to be the Speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8094377.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ann Widdecombe seeks Speaker role | date=2009-06-11 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made it through to the second ballot but came last and was eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8111887.stm |title=Two left in Commons Speaker race |accessdate=22 June 2009 |date=22 June 2009 |publisher=BBC online |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widdecombe retired from politics at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]].

==Personal life and family==
Until her retirement at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], Widdecombe divided her time between her two homes - one in London and one in the village of [[Sutton Valence]], [[Kent]], in her constituency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/w/ann-widdecombe Ann Widdecombe at fantasticfiction.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; She sold both of these properties, however, upon deciding to retire at the next general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/regions/south_east/8288134.stm|title=An interview with Ann Widdecombe |last=Wharton|first=Craig|date=2009-10-02|work=The Politics Show|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-10-08 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/retirementproperty/3361350/Division-bell-rings-for-retiring-Ann-Widdecombe.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Division bell rings for retiring Ann Widdecombe | first=Nicola | last=Venning | date=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She shared her home in London with her widowed mother, Rita Widdecombe, until Rita's death, on 1 May 2007, aged 95.&lt;ref&gt;Conservative MP's mother dies, aged 95. Retrieved from http://www.kentnews.co.uk/kent-news/Conservative-MP_s-mother-dies,-aged-95-newsinkent3663.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, she purchased a house in [[Haytor]], on [[Dartmoor]] in Devon, to where she has now retired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2008/08/06/ann_widdecombe_feature.shtml Widdecombe moves to Haytor at bbc.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother, Malcolm (1937-2010), who was an [[Anglican]] [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] in [[Bristol]], retired in May 2009 and died of [[metastasis|metastatic]] [[oesophageal cancer]] on 12 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pipnjay.org/people/history/341-tribute-to-malcolm-widdecombe Tributes to Malcolm Widdecombe]&lt;/ref&gt; Her nephew, Rev Roger Widdecombe, is an Anglican priest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.annwiddecombe.com/issueshow.aspx?id=59&amp;ref=13 Thanksgiving Service at annwiddecombe.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

She has never married nor had any children. In November 2007 on [[BBC Radio 4]] she described how a journalist once produced a profile on her with the assumption that she had had at least &quot;one sexual relationship&quot;, to which Widdecombe replied: &quot;Be careful, that's the way you get sued&quot;. When interviewer [[Jenni Murray]] asked if she had ever had a sexual relationship, Widdecombe laughed &quot;it's nobody else's business&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/02/2007_45_tue.shtml Ann Widdecombe on BBC &quot;Woman's Hour&quot; at bbc.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious views===
Widdecombe is a practising [[Roman Catholic]], a denomination to which she switched in 1993 after leaving the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7157409.stm|title=Tony Blair joins catholic church|publisher=bbconline|accessdate=2009-06-17 | date=2007-12-22 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her reasons for leaving the Anglican church were many, as she explained to [[New Statesman]]:

:’’”I left the Church of England because there was a huge bundle of straw. The ordination of women was the last straw, but it was only one of many. For years I had been disillusioned by the Church of England's compromising on everything. The Catholic Church doesn't care if something is unpopular.”’’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/religion/2010/07/catholic-church-religious|title=
Ann Widdecombe - extended interview by Alyssa McDonald|publisher=[[New Statesman]]|date=July 19, 2010|accessdate=October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She recently turned down an offer to be Britain's next ambassador to the [[Holy See]], being prevented from accepting by suffering a [[detached retina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Times 2010&quot;&gt;&quot;He's just my first bit of fun&quot;, interview in The Times, by Margarette Driscoll, 26 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In 1990, following the [[assassination]] of the Conservative politician [[Ian Gow]] by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), the [[Eastbourne by-election, 1990|Eastbourne by-election]] for his seat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] was won by the [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] [[David Bellotti]]. Upon the announcement, Widdecombe told the voters that the IRA would be &quot;toasting their success&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2001/mar/20/profiles.parliament16 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Ann Widdecombe | date=2001-03-20 | accessdate=2010-04-25 | first=Andrew | last=Roth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Widdecombe, as prisons minister, defended the Government's policy to shackle pregnant prisoners with handcuffs and chains when in hospital. Widdecombe told the Commons the restrictions were needed to prevent prisoners from escaping. &quot;Some MPs may like to think that a pregnant woman would not or could not escape. Unfortunately this is not true. The fact is that hospitals are not secure places in which to keep prisoners, and since 1990, 20 women have escaped from hospitals&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chaining-women-backed-1323238.html|title=Chaining women backed|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=January 10, 1996 |accessdate=October 20, 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2000/mar/18/fiction1|title=Hague's head girl|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=March 18, 2000|accessdate=October 20, 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, during the Conservative leadership election of [[William Hague]], Widdecombe spoke out against [[Michael Howard]], under whom she had served when he was Home Secretary. She famously remarked &quot;there is something of the night about him&quot;. The remark was considered to be extremely damaging to Howard, who was frequently satirised as a [[vampire]] thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/cartoons/stevebell/0,7371,1319967,00.html Steve Bell cartoon at guardian.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; He came last in the poll. Howard went on to become party leader in 2003, however, and Widdecombe then stated, &quot;I explained fully what my objections were in 1997 and I do not retract anything I said then. But this is 2005 and we have to look to the future and not the past.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/webchats/webchat.html?in_page_id=1868&amp;in_article_id=343672 Live chat with Tory Ann Widdecombe at dailymail.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, when [[Michael Portillo]] was running for leader of the Conservative Party, Widdecombe described him and his allies as &quot;backbiters&quot;. She went on to say that, should he be appointed leader, she would never give him her allegiance.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

==Media work and appearances==
In 2002, she took part in the ITV programme ''[[Celebrity Fit Club (UK TV series)|Celebrity Fit Club]]''. Also in 2002 she took part in a [[Louis Theroux]] television documentary, depicting her life, both in and out of politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/ann-widdecombe-the-truth-about-me-and-louis-theroux-659429.html|title=

She was the guest host of news quiz ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' twice, in 2006 and 2007. Following her second appearance, Widdecombe vowed she would never appear on the show again because of comments made by panellist [[Jimmy Carr]]. She wrote, &quot;His idea of wit is a barrage of filth and the sort of humour most men grow out of in their teens.... [T]here's no amount of money for which I would go through those two recording hours again. At one stage I nearly walked out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carr's filth&quot;&gt;Ann Widdecombe in the ''Daily Express'', as quoted by {{cite news |title=Widdecombe disgusted by Carr's 'filth' |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/mediamonkey/2007/11/widdecombe_disgusted_by_carrs.html |work=mediamonkey |publisher=''[[Guardian Unlimited]]'' |date=28 November 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-30 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did, however, stand by her appraisal of regular panellists [[Ian Hislop]] and [[Paul Merton]], whom she has called &quot;the fastest wits in showbusiness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carr's filth&quot;/&gt;

She awarded the 2007 ''[[University Challenge]]'' trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/University_Challenge|title=University Challenge|publisher=UK Game Shows.com|accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, she was cast as herself in &quot;[[The Sound of Drums (Doctor Who)|The Sound of Drums]]&quot;, the 12th episode of the third series of the science-fiction drama ''[[Doctor Who]]'' supporting [[Story arcs in Doctor Who#Mr Saxon|Mr Saxon]], the alias of [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Factfile&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Ware|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/2007/facts/fact_312.shtml|title=Doctor Who - Fact File - &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot;|work=Doctor Who: the official site|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=2007-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, Widdecombe has fronted a television [[Television season|series]] called ''Ann Widdecombe Versus'', on [[ITV1]], in which she speaks to various people about things related to her as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]], with an emphasis on confronting those responsible for problems she wished to tackle. On 15 August 2007 she talked about [[prostitution]], the next week about [[Social welfare provision|benefits]] and the week after that about [[truancy]]. A fourth episode was screened on 18 September 2008 in which she travelled around [[London]] and [[Birmingham]] talking to girl gangs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4781758.ece Ann Widdecombe Versus Girl Gangs; No Heroics; Hollyoaks at timesonline.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2010, she appeared on [[BBC One]]'s ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', partnered by [[Anton du Beke]], winning the support of some viewers despite low marks from the judges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00v7qxs/Strictly_Come_Dancing_Series_8_Week_1_Show_2/ Strictly Come Dancing at bbc.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/strictly-come-dancing/8076273/Interview-with-Ann-Widdecombe.html Interview with Ann Widdecombe at www.telegraph.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; After nine weeks of routines strongly flavoured by comedy the couple had received enough support in the public vote to stay in the contest. Widdecombe was eliminated from the competition on Sunday 5 December after the  public vote had been combined with the judges' score; she was with [[Scott Maslen]] of ''EastEnders'' in the bottom two.

==Other interests==
Her non-political accomplishments include being a popular [[novelist]]. Widdecombe also currently writes a weekly column for the ''[[Daily Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://express.co.uk/search/Ann%20Widdecombe/1/created/40 Express.co.uk - Home of the Daily and Sunday Express | Keyword search for Ann Widdecombe :: Page 1 | Breaking news, sport, showbiz, pictures and video from the Daily and Sunda...]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, she pledged to boycott [[British Airways]] for suspending a worker who refused to hide her [[Christian cross|cross]]. The matter was resolved when the company reversed the suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=21286&amp;in_page_id=34|title=Widdecombe pledges to boycott BA|date=2006-10-15|publisher=Metro|accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006, she moved into the house of an [[Islington]] Labour Councillor to experience life on a [[council estate]], her response to her experience being &quot;Five years ago I made a speech in the House of Commons about the forgotten decents.

In January 2011 Widdecombe was joint President of the [[North of England Education Conference]] in [[Blackpool]]. She shared the responsibility with a young person from the town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neec2011.co.uk neec2011]&lt;/ref&gt; She has also become a patron of The Grace Charity for M.E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thegracecharityforme.org/ | title=Welcome to the Grace Charity for M.E. | publisher=The Grace Charity for M.E. | accessdate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abul Muzaffar Muhy-ud-Din Muhammad Aurangzeb Alamgir'''({{lang-ur|ابلمظفر- محىالدين - محمد اورنگزيب- عالمگیر}}),({{lang-hi|अबुल मुज़फ्फर मुहिउद्दीन मुहम्मद औरंगज़ेब आलमगीर}}) ({{OldStyleDateDY|4 November|1618|25 October&lt;!-- Britain and the British Empire continued to use the Old Style till 1752 --&gt;}} – {{OldStyleDateDY|3 March|1707|20 February}}), more commonly known as '''Aurangzeb''' ({{lang-hi|औरंगज़ेब}})&lt;ref&gt;({{lang-ur|اورنگ‌زیب}}, full official title: ''Al-Sultan al-Azam wal Khaqan al-Mukarram Hazrat Abul Muzaffar Muhy-ud-Din Muhammad Aurangzeb Bahadur Alamgir I, Badshah Ghazi, Shahanshah-e-Sultanat-ul-Hindiya Wal Mughaliya''&lt;/ref&gt; or by his chosen imperial title '''Alamgir''' ({{lang-hi|आलमगीर}}) (&quot;Conquerer of the World&quot;, {{lang-ur|عالمگیر}}), was the sixth [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor of India]], whose reign lasted from 1658 until his death in 1707.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Book Encyclopedia Volume 1989 pg 894-895&quot;&gt;The World Book Encyclopedia Volume:A1 (1989) pg 894-895&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=4aqU9Zu7mFoC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=aurangzeb+rebellion+series&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=fDK_SdaiF4_CzATx2MyFCA&amp;client=firefox-a Mughal Rule in India - By Stephen Meredyth Edwardes, Herbert Leonard Offley Garrett]&lt;/ref&gt;

Badshah Aurangzeb Alamgir I, having ruled most of the [[Indian subcontinent]] for nearly half a century, was the second longest reigning Mughal emperor after the legendary [[Akbar the Great|Akbar]]. In this period he tried hard to get a larger area, notably in [[southern India]], under Mughal rule than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;Gascoigne, Bamber (1971). The Great Mughals. New York:Harper &amp; Row. pp. 233&lt;/ref&gt; But after his death in 1707, the Mughal Empire gradually began to shrink. Major reasons include a weak chain of &quot;[[Mughal Empire#Decline|Later Mughals]]&quot;, an inadequate focus on maintaining central administration leading to governors forming their own empires, a gradual depletion of the fortunes amassed by his predecessors and the growth of secessionist sentiments amongst the other communities of the empire like the [[Maratha empire|Marathas]].

==Rise to throne==
===Early life===

Aurangzeb was born as third son and sixth child to Prince Khurram (later fifth Mughal emperor [[Shah Jahan]]) and [[Mumtaz Mahal]] (Arjumand Bāno Begam) in Dohad on the way to Ujjain.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; After an unsuccessful rebellion by his father, Aurangzeb and his brother [[Dara Shikoh]] were submitted as hostages in June,1626 under [[Nur Jahan]] at his grandfather [[Jahangeer]]'s court in Lahore.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; After Shah Jahan's coming to power, Aurangzeb returned to live with his parents in Agra on 26 February 1628.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; His daily allowance was fixed to Rs.500.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt;

He had narrowly escaped death in an elephant fight on May 28, 1633, but his valor was appreciated by Shah Jahan who gave him the title &quot;Bahadur&quot; (Hero)and had him weighed in Gold and presented him gifts worth Rs 2 lakhs.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; This heroic deed was celebrated in Persion and Urdu verses.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt;

{{cquote|If the fight had ended fatally for me it would not have been a matter of shame.Death drops the curtain even on Emperors; it is no dishonour.The shame lay in what my brothers did!&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt;

He visited Kashmeer with Shah Jahan and was presented with the parganah of Lukh-bhawan in September,1634.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; On 13 December 1634 he got his first post as Commander of 10000 horse, with additional 4000 troopers.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; He was allowed to use Red tent , a royal prerogative ,for Shah Jahan had big plans for him.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt;

===Education===

Sadullah Khan (later wazir to Shah Jahan),Mir Muhammad Hashim of Gilan ,[[Muhammad Saleh Kamboh]] had been a few of his childhood teachers.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; Aurangzeb had a keen mind and quickly learnt what he read.He mastered the [[Quran]] and the [[hadis]] and readily quoted from them.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; He spoke and wrote [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] like a scholar.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; He learnt Chagtai Turki when he served in Qandahar.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt;

He wrote [[Arabic]] in vigorous ''naskh'' hand and used to copy [[Quran]] in it.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; Two richly bound and illuminated manuscripts to [[Makkah]] and [[Madinaa]] , another copy is preserved in Nizamuddeen Aoliya , while other such copies also exist.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt;

Aurangzeb was an author of vast number of letters and wrote orders across all petitions in his own hand.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; He frequently quoted Islamic verses but had no special taste for poetry.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt;

===Bundela War, 1635===

To contain the Bundela rebellion under Jhujhar Singh, Shah Jahan organized an expedition to converge upon Bundelkhand from 3 sides : Syed Khan-i-Jahan with 10,500 men from Badaun, Abdullah Khan Bahadur Firuz Jang with 6000 men from north and Khan-i-Dauran with 6000 men from south-west.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; The three generals were of equal rank and hence to ensure unity and co-operation among them, Aurangzeb, the 16 year old commander of 10,000 and escorted by 1000 archers and 1000 horses ,was made the (nominal) chief of mission.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; He was to stay in the rear,away from fighting and take advice from the generals, but his call was decisive and no general could act without consulting him.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt;

{{cquote|If the campaign was meant to be Aurangzeb's baptimism of fire, we must say the baptimism was performed at a great distance from the fire!&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt;
|author=Dow's account of the war}}

The armies captured the Bundela capital on October 4, 1635 and installed Devi Singh as Rajah, while Jhujhar Singh had escaped.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; After a flurry of events, the Gonds killed Jhujhar and his son in their sleep and sent their head to Shah Jahan in December 1635.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; Aurangzeb had come to Dhamuni where Shah Jahan paid him a visit.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; He ordered demolition of Bir Singh Dev's temple and had a mosque constructed.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt;

Aurangzeb returned from Dhamuni to wait for his father at Uruchha and together they travelled through the country.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; On the way to Sironj they reached Daulatabad where Aurangzeb on July 14, 1636 took formal leave of the emperor to act as the Viceroy of the [[Deccan]].&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khafi Khan, Muntakhab ul-Lubab, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, he began building a new city near the former capital of Khirki which he named [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] after himself. In 1637, he married Rabia Durrani. During this period the [[Dakkan]] was relatively peaceful. In the Mughal court, however, Shah Jahan began to show greater and greater favoritism to his eldest son [[Dara Shikoh]].

In 1644, Aurangzeb's sister [[Jahan Ara Begam]] was accidentally burned in [[Agra]]. This event precipitated a family crisis which had political consequences. Aurangzeb suffered his father's displeasure when he returned to Agra three weeks after the event, instead of immediately.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt; Shah Jahan dismissed him as the governor of the Deccan. Aurangzeb later claimed (1654) that he had resigned in protest of his father favoring Dara.&lt;ref name=Alamgiri /&gt;

In 1645, he was barred from the court for seven months. But later, Shah Jahan appointed him governor of [[Gujarat]]; he performed well and was rewarded. In 1647, Shah Jahan made him governor of [[Balkh]] and [[Badakhshan]] (in modern [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistan]]), replacing Aurangzeb's ineffective brother [[Murad Baksh]]. These areas at the time were under attack from various forces and Aurangzeb's military skill proved successful.

He was appointed governor of [[Multan]] and [[Sindh]], and began a protracted military struggle against the [[Safavid]] army in an effort to capture the city of [[Qandahar]]. He failed, and fell again into his father's disfavour.

In 1652, Aurangzeb was re-appointed governor of the [[Deccan]]. In an effort to extend the empire, Aurangzeb attacked the border kingdoms of [[Golconda]] (1657), and [[Adil Shahi|Bijapur]] (1658). Both times, Shah Jahan called off the attacks near the moment of Aurangzeb's triumph. In each case Dara Shikoh interceded and arranged a peaceful end to the attacks.

===War of succession===
[[File:ShujaAurganzebMurad.jpg|thumb|220px|left|A painting from circa 1637 shows the brothers (left to right) Shuja, Aurangzeb and Murad Baksh in their younger years.]]

[[Shah Jahan]] fell ill in 1657. With this news, the struggle for the succession began. Aurangzeb's eldest brother, [[Dara Shikoh]], was regarded as heir apparent, but the succession proved far from certain when Shah Jahan's second son [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]] declared himself emperor in [[Bengal]]. Imperial armies sent by Dara and Shah Jahan soon restrained this effort, and Shuja retreated.

Soon after, Shuja's youngest brother [[Murad Bakhsh]], with secret promises of support from Aurangzeb, declared himself emperor in [[Gujarat]]. Aurangzeb, ostensibly in support of Murad, marched north from Aurangabad, gathering support from nobles and generals. Following a series of victories, Aurangzeb declared that Dara had illegally usurped the throne. Shah Jahan, determined that Dara would succeed him, handed over control of his empire to Dara.  A [[Rajput]] lord opposed to Aurangzeb and Murad, [[Raja Jaswant Singh]], battled them both at Dharmatpur near [[Ujjain]]. Aurangzeb eventually defeated Singh and concentrated his forces on Dara. A series of bloody battles followed, with troops loyal to Aurangzeb battering Dara's armies at [http://horsesandswords.blogspot.com/2006/01/battle-of-samugarh.html Samugarh]. In a few months, Aurangzeb's forces surrounded Agra. Fearing for his life, Dara departed for [[Delhi]], leaving Shah Jahan behind. The old emperor surrendered the [[Agra Fort]] to Aurangzeb's nobles, but Aurangzeb refused any meeting with his father, and declared that Dara was no longer a Muslim.

In a sudden reversal, Aurangzeb arrested his brother Murad, whose former supporters defected to Aurangzeb in return for rich gifts.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of India (1922), vol. IV, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Dara gathered his forces, and moved to the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The army sent against Shuja was trapped in the east, its generals [[Jai Singh I|Jai Singh]] and Diler Khan, submitted to Aurangzeb, but allowed Dara's son Suleman to escape.  Aurangzeb offered Shuja the governorship of [[Bengal]]. This move had the effect of isolating Dara and causing more troops to defect to Aurangzeb.  Shuja, however, uncertain of Aurangzeb's sincerity, continued to battle his brother, but his forces suffered a series of defeats at Aurangzeb's hands. Shuja fled to Arakan (in present-day Burma), where he was executed after leading a failed coup.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of India (1922), vol. IV, p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt;  Murad was finally executed, ostensibly for the murder of his former ''divan'' Ali Naqi, in 1661.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of India (1922), vol. IV, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Shuja and Murad disposed of, and with his father Shah Jahan confined in Agra, Aurangzeb pursued Dara, chasing him across the north-western bounds of the empire. After a series of battles, defeats and retreats, Dara was betrayed by one of his generals, who arrested and bound him. In 1659, Aurangzeb arranged his formal coronation in [[Dehli]]. He had Dara openly marched in chains back to Delhi; when Dara finally arrived, Aurangzeb had him executed on 30 August 1659. Having secured his position, Aurangzeb kept an already weakening Shah Jahan under house arrest at the Agra Fort. Shah Jahan died in 1666.

==Aurangzeb's reign==
===Establishment of Islamic law===
[[File:A late Mughal Qur'an leaf.jpg|thumb|250x| A quran produced in the times of the Mughal empire.]]
[[File:Voyage de Francois Bernier by Paul Maret 1710.jpg|thumb|[[François Bernier]] (1625–1688), a [[French people|French]] [[physician]] and traveler, became for 12 years the personal physician of Aurangzeb. He described his experiences in ''Travels in the Mughal Empire''.]]

Soon after his ascension, Aurangzeb purportedly abandoned the liberal religious viewpoints of his predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;John Keay,''India: A History''(2001) p.336&lt;/ref&gt;  Though [[Akbar]], [[Jahangir]] and [[Shah Jahan]]'s approach to faith was more [[wikt:syncretic|syncretic]] than [[Babur|the empire's founder]], Aurangzeb's position is not so obvious. While his conservative interpretation of Islam and belief in the [[Sharia]] (Islamic law) is well documented, how this affected the empire remains unclear. Despite claims of sweeping edicts and policies, contradictory accounts exist.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Butler Brown, ''Did Aurangzeb Ban Music?'' (2007), p.91&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, his compilation of the [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]], a digest of Muslim law, was either intended for personal use, never enforced, or only poorly done. While some assert the lack of broad adoption was due to an inherent flaw,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mwlusa.org/topics/marriage&amp;divorce/muslim_family_law_pakistan.html Hanafi law was sought to be codified under Aurangzeb but the work of several hundred jurists, called Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, seems too inclined to favour the Mughal elite to be useful for today's egalitarian society]&lt;/ref&gt; others insist they were only intended for his observance.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Butler Brown, ''Did Aurangzeb Ban Music?''(2007), p.114&lt;/ref&gt; While it is possible the war of succession and a continued incursions combined with Shah Jahan's spending made cultural expenditures impossible,&lt;ref&gt;Taymiya R. Zaman ''Inscribing Empire: Sovereignty and Subjectivity in Mughal Memoirs''(2007) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Aurangzeb's orthodoxy is also used to explain his infamous &quot;burial&quot; of music. The scene describing the &quot;death of music&quot;(and all other forms of performance) is paradoxically dramatic.

[[Niccolao Manucci]]'s [[Storia do Mogor]] and [[Khafi Khan]]'s [[Muntakhab al-Lubab]] are the only documents which describe the aforementioned event. In Storia do Mogor, Manucci describes the ramifications of Aurangzeb's 1668 decree.&lt;ref&gt;It should be noted; this date is never specified by Manucci. However, events surrounding the statement, the chronology of which is not under dispute, are used to extrapolate a general timeframe.&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, Aurangzeb's instructions for the [[muhtasib]] seem particularly damning:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''In Hindustan both Moguls and Hindus are very fond of listening to songs and instrumental music. He therefore ordered the same official to stop music. If in any house or elsewhere he heard the sound of singing and instruments, he should forthwith hasten there and arrest as many as he could, breaking the instruments. Thus was caused a great destruction of musical instruments. Finding themselves in this difficulty, their large earnings likely to cease, without there being any other mode of seeking a livelihood, the musicians took counsel together and tried to appease the king in the following way: About one thousand of them assembled on a Friday when Aurangzeb was going to the mosque. They came out with over twenty highly-ornamented biers, as is the custom of the country, crying aloud with great grief and many signs of feeling, as if they were escorting to the grave some distinguished defunct.	From afar Aurangzeb saw this multitude and heard their great weeping and lamentation, and, wondering, sent to know the cause of so much sorrow. The musicians redoubled their outcry and their tears, fancying the king would take compassion upon them. Lamenting,they replied with sobs that the king's orders had killed Music, therefore they were bearing her to the grave. Report was made to the king, who quite calmly remarked that they should pray for the soul of Music, and see that she was thoroughly well buried. In spite of this, the nobles did not cease to listen to songs in secret. This strictness was enforced in the principal cities''.&lt;ref&gt;Niccolao Manucci, ''Storia do Mogor'' (1907), vol. 11 p.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/download/storiadomogororm02manuuoft/storiadomogororm02manuuoft.pdf Pdf of Storia do Mogor vol. ii]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This implies he not only placed a prohibition on music, but actively sought and crushed any resistance. Without music, and implicitly dance, many Hindu-inspired practices&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archnet.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdownloader%2Fpdf%2F4966%2Fdoc%2FDPC0807.pdf Pdf which Details: Balcony Appearances and Other Such Hindu Inspired Mughal Activities]&lt;/ref&gt; would have been impossible. Lavish celebrations of the Emperor's birthday, commonplace since the time of Akbar, would certainly be forbidden under such conditions. Oddly, artistic work not only steadied during Aurangzeb's reign, it increased.&lt;ref&gt;Allison Busch, ''Brajbhasha Poets at the Mughal Court''(2009), p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst these and other contradictions, the validity and bias of Manucci and Khafi Khan's work is being questioned.

Another particularly heinous claim against Aurangzeb, was his policy of temple destruction. Though figures vary wildly from 80 to 60,000,&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Eaton ''Temple Desecration and Indo-Muslim States''(2000) p.297&lt;/ref&gt; it clearly took place to some extent. However, Aurangzeb's Firmans on behalf of the Balaji or Vishnu Temple,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Fn7GhTpJ4esC&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;ots=n_1c4gWmr8&amp;dq=Balaji%20temple%20aurangzeb&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=firmans&amp;f=false Aurangzeb and the Balaji]&lt;/ref&gt; Varanasi insist these events weren't universal. Noted Historian [[Richard Eaton (historian)|Richard Eaton]] believes the overall understanding of temples to be flawed.  As early as the sixth century, temples became vital political landmarks as well as religious ones.  In fact, not only was temple desecration widely practiced and accepted, it was a necessary part of political struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Eaton ''Temple Desecration and Indo-Muslim States''(2000) p.295&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francois Bernier]], traveled and chronicled Mughal India during the war of succession, notes both [[Shah Jahan]] and Aurangzeb's distaste for Christians. This led to the demolition of [[Christian]] settlements near the British/European Factories and enslavement of Christian converts by Shah Jahan. Furthermore, Aurangzeb stopped all aid to Christian Missionaries (Frankish Padres) initiated by [[Akbar]] and [[Jahangir]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Francois Bernier]]; Travels Through the Mogul Empire ISBN 978-1931641227&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|November 2009|date=September 2010}}

===Aurangzeb's views on the Jizya (poll tax)===
From Aurangzeb's Fatwa:&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Fatawa al-Alamgiriyyah : Al-Fatawa al-Hindiyyah fi Madhhab al-Imam al-A'zam Abi Hanifah al-Nu'man'' (Beirut: Dar al-Ma'rifah, 1973), 2:244-245.- Translated by Anver Emon of the Department of History, UCLA.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;''[Jizyah] refers to what is taken from the Dhimmis, according to [what is stated in] al-Nihayah. It is obligatory upon [1] the free, [2] adult members of [those] who are generally fought, [3] who are fully in possession of their mental faculties, and [4] gainfully employed, even if [their] profession is not noble, as is [stated in] al-Sarajiyyah. There are two types of (jizyah). [The first is] the jizyah that is imposed by treaty or consent, such that it is established in accordance with mutual agreement, according to (what is stated in) al-Kafi. (The amount) does not go above or below (the stipulated) amount, as is stated in al-Nahr al-Fa'iq. (The second type) is the jizyah that the leader imposes when he conquers the unbelievers (kuffar), and (whose amount) he imposes upon the populace in accordance with the amount of property [they own], as in al-Kafi. This is an amount that is pre-established, regardless of whether they agree or disagree, consent to it or not''.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;''The wealthy (are obligated to pay) each year forty-eight dirhams (of a specified weight), payable per month at the rate of 4 dirhams. The next, middle group (wast al-hal) [must pay] twenty-four dirhams, payable per month at the rate of 2 dirhams. The employed poor are obligated to pay twelve dirhams, in each month paying only one dirham, as stipulated in Fath al-Qadir, al-Hidayah, and al-Kafi. (The scholars) address the meaning of &quot;gainfully employed&quot;, and the correct meaning is that it refers to one who has the capacity to work, even if his profession is not noble. The scholars also address the meaning of wealthy, poor, and the middle group. Al-Shaykh al-Imam Abu Ja'far, may Allah the most high have mercy on him, considered the custom of each region decisive as to whom the people considered in their land to be poor, of the middle group, or rich. This is as such, and it is the most correct view, as stated in al-Muhit. Al-Karakhi says that the poor person is one who owns two hundred dirhams or less, while the middle group owns more than two hundred and up to ten thousand dirhams, and the wealthy (are those) who own more than ten thousand dirhams...The support for this, according to al-Karakhi is provided by the fatawa of Qadi Khan (died 592/1196). It is necessary that in the case of the employed person, he must have good health for most of the year, as is stated in al-Hidayah. It is mentioned in al-Idah that if a dhimmi is ill for the entire year such that he cannot work and he is well off, he is not obligated to pay the jizyah, and likewise if he is sick for half of the year or more. If he quits his work while having the capacity (to work) he (is still liable) as one gainfully employed, as is [stated in] al-Nihayah. No jizyah is imposed upon their women, children, ill persons or the blind, or likewise on the paraplegic, the very old, or on the unemployed poor, as is stated in al-Hidayah.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Expansion of the Mughal Empire===
[[File:Darbarscene.jpg|thumb|250px|Emperor Aurangzeb seated on a golden throne holding a [[hawk]] in the [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]. Such scenes would be rare in the latter part of his reign as he was permanently camped in the Deccan, fighting wars.]]

From the start of his reign up until his death, Aurangzeb engaged in almost constant warfare. He built up a massive army, and began a program of military expansion along all the boundaries of his empire. Aurangzeb pushed north-west into the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and what is now [[Afghanistan]]; he also drove south, conquering three [[Muslim]] kingdoms: [[Nizams]]'s of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Adilshahi]]'s of [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Bijapur]] and [[Qutbshahi]]'s of [[Golconda]]. 

[[Nizams]]'s of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Adilshahi]]'s of [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Bijapur]] mostly surrendered and their territories were administered by [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Nawab]]. [[Qutbshahi]]'s of [[Golconda]] however refused to surrender they fortified themselves at Golconda Fort, and fiercely protected [[Kollur Mine]] (the worlds only [[diamond mine]]). After a long siege [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] forces managed to penetrate the walls by capturing a gate. [[Qutbshahi]]'s of [[Golconda]] and [[Abul Hasan Qutb Shah]] surrendered and handed over the [[Nur-Ul-Ain Diamond]], [[The Hope Diamond]], [[Wittelsbach Diamond]] and the [[The Regent Diamond]] making the [[Mughal Emperor]] the richest monarch in the world.

This combination of military expansion and religious intolerance had deeper consequences. Though he succeeded in expanding Mughal control, it was at an enormous cost in lives and treasure. And, as the empire expanded in size, Aurangzeb's chain of command grew weaker.  The [[Sikh]]s of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] grew both in strength and numbers, and launched rebellions. The Marathas waged a war with Aurangzeb which lasted for [[War of 27 years|27 years]].  Even Aurangzeb's own armies grew restive — particularly the fierce [[Rajput]]s, who were his main source of strength. Aurangzeb gave a wide berth to the Rajputs, who were mostly Hindu. While they fought for Aurangzeb during his life, on his death they immediately revolted against his successors.

With much of his attention on military matters, Aurangzeb's political power waned, and his incompetent provincial [[Nawab]]s grew in authority.

===Foreign Relations===
Aurangzeb sent rich gifts to holy men of Mecca and Medina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Shah Jahan had exchanged ambassadors with Ottoman Sultan [[Murad IV]], though no ambassadors were exchanged in Aurangzeb's reign.He,however sympathized with Ottomans over their European defeats.[[Suleiman II]] had asked for his help after defeat at Vienna , but Aurangzeb was too busy with Deccan wars to commit.

===Revenue administration===
Emperor Aurangzeb's exchequer raised a record £100 million in annual revenue through various sources like taxes, customs and land revenue, ''et al.'' from 24 provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yUhvfR1S_UEC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=aurangzeb+revenue+million&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CfZLTKD4J8qUrAf1s525Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; A pound sterling was exchanged at 10 rupees then.

==Rebellions==
Aurangzeb's reign is marked by numerous rebellions in the distant provinces of the [[Mughal Empire]], many historians believe that [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Nawab]]s were incapable of bridging the gap between the rulers and the people; therefore many new identities emerged along with it armed rebellion.

*In 1669, the Jat peasants of Bharatpur around [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] revolted and led to the formation of [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]] state, they formulated a fierce rebellion around the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] capitol.

*In 1670, [[Shivaji]], assassinated the [[Adil Shahi]] commander [[Afzal Khan]] and later his rebels almost killed the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Viceroy]] [[Shaista Khan]], and waged the war against the [[Mughal Emperor]] Aurangzeb. Shivaji and his forces ravaged the [[Deccan]], [[Janjira]] and tried to gain control of vast territories. However by 1689 Auranzeb's armies had captured the successor of [[Shivaji]], his son [[Sambhaji]] alive and executed. But even after Sambhaji's death, Aurangzeb could never completely eradicate the [[Maratha]] rebels ever in his 27 years of war against them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FzmkFXSgxqgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA52&amp;lpg=RA1-PA52&amp;dq=aurangzeb+in+deccan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ndtGz0s1mw&amp;sig=GUaMJ0So6bhGdFk4z1J6-9eIT24&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dx5zSr70OKShjAfk6-2nBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false  An atlas and survey of South Asian history By Karl J. Schmidt]&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1672, the [[Satnami]], a sect concentrated in an area near Delhi, under the leadership of Bhirbhan and some Satnami, took over the administration of [[Narnaul]], but they were eventually crushed upon Aurangzeb's personal intervention with very few escaping alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4aqU9Zu7mFoC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=satnami+aurangzeb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2UuovD_HlV&amp;sig=eqoNlOz8jV1dP7swTknYpXWCfRU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4SBzStO0DaHbjQes7einBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=satnami%20aurangzeb&amp;f=false Mughal rule in India By Stephen Meredyth Edwardes, Herbert Leonard Offley Garrett ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ISFBJarYX7YC&amp;pg=PA355&amp;lpg=PA355&amp;dq=satnami+aurangzeb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1wULoJ-qsv&amp;sig=nmJn36Pf-XJ99oDWw_iRonT5ajU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4SBzStO0DaHbjQes7einBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#v=onepage&amp;q=satnami%20aurangzeb&amp;f=false Students' Britannica India By Dale Hoiberg, Indu Ramchandani]&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1699, on his orders the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] governor of Sarhind surrounded the fort of Anandpur in Punjab, which was occupied by [[Guru Gobind Singh]] and well armed [[Sikh]]s. After oaths of safety by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] forces, Guru Gobind Singh decided to leave the fort. However the Mughal forces broke their promises and attacked the Guru and the Sikhs. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s held his 2 young sons [[Sahibzada Zorawar Singh]] and [[Sahibzada Fateh Singh]] captive and executed through [[Immurement]].  Meanwhile his elder sons (15 and 17 years old) named [[Sahibzada Jujhar Singh]] and [[Sahibzada Ajit Singh]] fell fighting [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Musketeers]] at Chamkaur (close to Anandpur Fort).  Gobind Singh wrote a letter named [[Zafarnamah]] to Aurungzeb. The letter is written in exquisite [[Persian language|Persian]] verse. In this letter, Guru Gobind Singh Ji reminds Aurangzeb how he and his henchmen had broken their oaths taken by the holy [[Qu'ran]] and loyalty to the [[Mughal Empire]].

*In 1671, The [[Battle of Saraighat]] between the [[Mughal Empire]] , and the [[Ahom Kingdom]]. The battle was a disaster for the Mughal army. The Mughal army was utterly annihilated due to the bravery of the Ahom general and his army. This battle was a watershed point in Indian history since it seriously checked Mughal invasions notably under the cruelest among them all, Aurangzeb. During the battle the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]'s were led by [[Mir Jumla II]] and [[Shaista Khan]]. During the course of the battle the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Admiral]], [[Munnawar Khan]] was killed.

===The Deccan wars and the Rise of the Marathas===
[[File:Asif tomb.jpg|250px|thumb|Aurangzeb spent more than 20years of his life fighting major and minor rebellions throughout the [[Mughal Empire]].]]
In the time of Shah Jahan, the Deccan had been controlled by three Muslim kingdoms: [[Ahmednagar]] ([[Nizam Shahi]]), [[Bijapur]] ([[Adilshahi]]) and [[Golconda]] ([[Qutbshahi]]). Following a series of battles, Ahmednagar was effectively divided, with large portions of the kingdom ceded to the Mughals and the balance to Bijapur. One of Ahmednagar's generals, a Hindu [[Maratha]] named [[Shahaji]], joined the Bijapur court. Shahaji sent his wife Jijabai and young son [[Shivaji]] in [[Pune]] to look after his Jagir.&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid, Dennis (1937). The Grand Rebel. London:Collins Press. pp. 50,51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1657, while Aurangzeb attacked Golconda and Bijapur, Shivaji, using guerrilla tactics, took control of three Adilshahi forts formerly controlled by his father. With these victories, Shivaji assumed de facto leadership of many independent Maratha clans. The Marathas harried the flanks of the warring Adilshahi and Mughals, gaining weapons, forts, and territories.&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid 1937:72-78&lt;/ref&gt;  Shivaji's small and ill-equipped army survived an all out Adilshahi attack, and Shivaji personally killed the [[Adilshahi]] general, [[Afzal Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid 1937:121-125&lt;/ref&gt;  With this event, the Marathas transformed into a powerful military force, capturing more and more Adilshahi and Mughal territories.&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid 1937:130-138&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before Shivaji Raje's his coronation in 1659, Aurangzeb sent his trusted general and maternal uncle [[Shaista Khan]] the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Viceroy]] to the Deccan to recover lost forts occupied by the Maratha rebels. Shaista Khan drove into [[Maratha]] territory and took up residence in [[Pune]]. In a daring raid, Shivaji attacked the governor's residence in Pune during a midnight wedding celebration. The [[Maratha]]s killed Shaista Khan's son, even hacking off most of Shaista Khan's hand. [[Shaista Khan]] however barely survived and was re-appointed as the administrator of [[Bengal]] and was a key commander in the war against the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahoms]].

Aurangzeb ignored the rise of the Marathas for the next few years as he was occupied with other religious and political matters including the rise of Sikhism. Shivaji captured forts belonging to both Mughals and Bijapur. At last Aurangzeb sent his powerful general [[Jai Singh I|Raja Jai Singh]] of [[Amber, India|Amber]], a Hindu Rajput, to attack the Marathas. Jai Singh won fort of Purandar after fierce battle in which the maratha commander Murarbaji fell. Foreseeing defeat, Shivaji agreed for a truce and meeting Aurangjeb at Delhi. Jai Singh also promised the Maratha hero his safety, placing him under the care of his own son, the future Raja [[Ram Singh I]].  However, circumstances at the Mughal court were beyond the control of the Raja, and when Shivaji and his son [[Sambhaji]] went to Agra to meet Aurangzeb, they were placed under house arrest, from which they managed to effect a daring escape.&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid 1937:197&lt;/ref&gt;

Shivaji returned to the Deccan, and was crowned [[Chhatrapati]] or Emperor of the Maratha Empire in 1674.&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid 1937:283&lt;/ref&gt; While Aurangzeb continued to send troops against him, Shivaji expanded Maratha control throughout the Deccan until his death in 1680. Shivaji was succeeded by his son Sambhaji. Militarily and politically, Mughal efforts to control the Deccan continued to fail. Aurangzeb's son [[Sultan Muhammad Akbar|Akbar]] left the Mughal court and joined [[Muslim]] rebels in [[Deccan]]. Aurangzeb in response moved his court to Aurangabad and took over command of the Deccan campaign. More battles ensued, and Akbar fled to [[Persia]] and never returned.&lt;ref&gt;Gascoine 1971:228-229&lt;/ref&gt;

When Maharaja Jaswant Singh of [[Jodhpur]] died in 1679, a conflict ensued over who would be the next Raja. Aurangzeb's choice of a nephew of the former Maharaja was not accepted by other members of Jaswant Singh's family and they rebelled, but in vain. Aurangzeb seized control of Jodhpur. He also moved on [[Udaipur]], which was the only other state of [[Rajputana]] to support the rebellion. There was never a clear resolution to this conflict, although it is noted that the other Rajputs, including the celebrated [[Kachhwaha]] Rajput clan of Raja Jai Singh, the [[Bhatti]]s, and the [[Rathore]]s, remained loyal. On the other hand, Aurangzeb's own third son, Prince Akbar, along with a few Muslim Mansabdar supporters, joined the rebels in the hope of dethroning his father and becoming emperor. &lt;!-- ? (Once again the easy divide of Muslim Aurangzeb versus 'all the Hindus' is called into question.) --&gt; The rebels were defeated and Akbar fled south to the shelter of the Maratha Chhatrapati [[Sambhaji]], Chhatrapati Shivaji's successor.

In 1689 Aurangzeb's forces captured [[Sambhaji]], his successor [[chhatrapati]] Rajaram and his, Maratha forces fought individual battles against the forces of the [[Mughal Empire]], and territory changed hands again and again during years of endless warfare. As there was no central authority among the Marathas, Aurangzeb was forced to contest every inch of territory, at great cost in lives and treasure against an organized force. Even as Aurangzeb drove west, deep into Maratha territory — notably conquering [[Satara]] — the Marathas expanded their attacks further into Mughal lands, including Mughal provinces of [[Malwa]], [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], [[Jinji]] in [[TamilNadu]]. Aurangzeb waged continuous war in the Deccan for more than two decades with no resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gascoine 1971:239-246&lt;/ref&gt; Aurangzeb lost about a fifth of his army fighting rebellions led by the [[Maratha]]s in [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan India]]. He came down thousands of miles to the Deccan to conquer the Maratha confederacy and eventually died at the age of 90, during his final campaign against the Maratha confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=wLrwmEvTDNYC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=aurangzeb+rebellion+series&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=yzK_SanGGJGszQTjyo3GCw&amp;client=firefox-a The Story of the World - By S. Wise Bauer, Sarah Park, James]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ahoms (the people of Shan community of Thailand) were the kings who had established their kingdom in the basin of river Bramhaputra and made it impossible for the Mughals to conquer that area.

===The Pashtun rebellion===
The [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribesmen of the Empire were considered the bedrock of the [[Mughal Army]].  They were crucial defenders of the Empire from the threat of invasion from the North-West as well as the main fighting force against the Sikh and Maratha forces. The Pashtun revolt in 1672 under the leadership of the warrior poet [[Khushal Khan Khattak]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afghan-web.com/bios/yest/kkk.html &quot;Biography: Khushal Khan Khattak&quot; Afghan-Web]&lt;/ref&gt; was triggered when soldiers under the orders of the Mughal Governor Amir Khan allegedly attempted to molest women of the [[Safi tribe]] in modern day [[Kunar Province|Kunar]]. The Safi tribes  attacked the soldiers. This attack provoked a reprisal, which triggered a general revolt of most of  tribes. Attempting to reassert his authority, Amir Khan led a large Mughal Army to the [[Khyber Pass]]. There the army was surrounded by tribesmen and routed, with only four men, including the Governor, managing to escape.

After that the revolt spread, with the Mughals suffering a near total collapse of their authority along the Pashtun belt. The closure of the important [[Attock]]-[[Kabul]] trade route along the [[Grand Trunk road]] was particularly critical. By 1674, the situation had deteriorated to a point where Aurangzeb himself camped at Attock to personally take charge. Switching to diplomacy and bribery along with force of arms, the Mughals eventually split the rebellion and while they never managed to wield effective authority outside the main trade route, the revolt was partially suppressed. However the long term anarchy on the Empire's North-Western frontier that prevailed as a consequence ensured that the Persian [[Nadir Shah]]'s forces half a century later faced little resistance on the road to [[Delhi]], being one of the causes for Mughal decline and eventual European dominance.

==Legacy==

[[File:Lahore Fort Pakistan.jpg|250px|thumb|right|One of the thirteen gates at the Lahore Fort, this one built by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and named [[Alamgiri Gate]]]]

Aurangzeb's vast imperial campaigns against rebellion-affected areas of the [[Mughal Empire]], caused his opponents to exaggerate the &quot;importance&quot; of their rebellions. The results of his vast campaigns were made worse by the incompetence of his regional [[Nawabs]]. His critics decry this as intolerance,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/feb/16francois.htm The truth about Aurangzeb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim views regarding Aurangzeb vary, most Muslim historians believe that the [[Mughal Emperor]] Aurangzeb was the last powerful ruler of an empire inevitably on the verge of decline. The major rebellions organized by the [[Sikh]]s and the [[Maratha]]s were long embedded and had deep roots in the remote regions of the [[Mughal Empire]].

Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb considered the royal treasury as a trust of the citizens of his empire. He made caps and copied Quran to earn money for his use. He did not use royal treasury for personal expenses or extravagant building projects except, perhaps, for one project: he built the famous [[Badshahi Mosque]] in [[Lahore]], which, for 313 years remained the world's largest mosque and still remains to this day the 5th largest mosque in the world.  He also added a small marble mosque known as the ''[[Moti Masjid (Delhi)|Moti Masjid]]'' (Pearl Mosque) to the [[Delhi Fort|Red Fort]] complex in Delhi. His constant warfare especially with [[Marathas]], however, drove his empire to the brink of bankruptcy just as much as the wasteful personal spending and opulence of his predecessors.

[[File:Aurangzeb reading the Quran.jpg|thumb|left|Aurangzeb reading the [[Quran]].]]

[[Stanley Wolpert]] writes in his ''New History of India'' that:

''{{quote|the conquest of the Deccan, to which, Aurangzeb devoted the last 26 years of his life, was in many ways a Pyrrhic victory, costing an estimated hundred thousand lives a year during its last decade of futile chess game warfare...The expense in gold and rupees can hardly be accurately estimated. [Aurangzeb]'s moving capital alone- a city of tents 30 miles in circumference, some 250 bazaars, with a {{frac|1|2}} million camp followers, 50,000 camels and 30,000 elephants, all of whom had to be fed, stripped peninsular India of any and all of its surplus grain and wealth... Not only famine but bubonic plague arose...Even Aurangzeb, had ceased to understand the purpose of it all by the time he was nearing 90... &quot;I came alone and I go as a stranger. I do not know who I am, nor what I have been doing,&quot; the dying old man confessed to his son in February 1707.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wolpert|first=Stanley|year=2003|title=New History of India|edition=7th|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195166779}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Aurangzebs tomb.jpg|thumb|140px|Aurangzeb's tomb in [[Khuldabad]], in 1890s ]]
He died in [[Ahmednagar]] on Friday, 20 February 1707 at the age of 88, having outlived many of his children. His modest open-air grave in [[Khuldabad]] expresses his deep devotion to his Islamic beliefs. The tomb lies within the courtyard of the shrine of the Sufi saint Shaikh Burham-u'd-din Gharib (died 1331), who was a disciple of [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] of Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e239?_hi=1&amp;_pos=1&lt;/ref&gt;

After Aurangzeb's death, his son [[Bahadur Shah I]] took the throne. The Mughal Empire, due both to Aurangzeb's over-extension and  to Bahadur Shah's weak military and leadership qualities, entered a period of long decline.  Immediately after Bahadur Shah occupied the throne, the Maratha Empire — which Aurangzeb had held at bay, inflicting high human and monetary costs — consolidated and launched effective invasions of Mughal territory, seizing power from the weak emperor.  Within 100 years of Aurangzeb's death, the Mughal Emperor had little power beyond Delhi.

An '''alexandrine''' is a line of [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meter]] comprising 12 [[syllable]]s.  Alexandrines are common in the [[German literature]] of the [[German literature of the Baroque period|Baroque period]] and in [[List of French language poets|French poetry]] of the early modern and modern periods. [[Drama]] in English often used alexandrines before [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], by whom it was supplanted by [[iambic pentameter]] (5-foot verse).  In non-Anglo-Saxon or French contexts, the term [[dodecasyllable]] is often used.

==Syllabic verse==
In [[syllabic verse]], such as that used in [[French literature]], an alexandrine is a line of twelve syllables.  Most commonly, the line is divided into two equal parts by a [[caesura]] between the sixth and seventh syllables. Alternatively, the line is divided into three four-syllable sections by two caesuras.

The dramatic works of [[Pierre Corneille]] and [[Jean Racine]] are typically composed of rhyming alexandrine couplets. (The caesura after the 6th syllable is here marked || )
:Nous partîmes cinq cents ; || mais par un prompt renfort
:Nous nous vîmes trois mille || en arrivant au port
::(Corneille, ''Le Cid'' Act IV , scene 3)

[[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire's]] ''Les Bijoux'' (The Jewels) is a typical example of the use of the alexandrine in 19th-century French poetry :
:La très-chère était nue, || et, connaissant mon cœur,
:Elle n'avait gardé || que ses bijoux sonores,
:Dont le riche attirail || lui donnait l'air vainqueur
:Qu'ont dans leurs jours heureux || les esclaves des Mores.

Even a 20th-century Surrealist, such as [[Paul Éluard]], used alexandrines on occasion, such as in these lines from ''L'Égalité des sexes'' (in ''Capitale de la douleur'') (note the variation between caesuras after the 6th syllable, and after 4th and 8th):
:Ni connu la beauté || des yeux, beauté des pierres,
:Celle des gouttes d'eau, || des perles en placard,
:Des pierres nues || et sans squelette, || ô ma statue

==Modern references==
In the comic book [[Asterix and Cleopatra]], the author Goscinny inserted a pun about alexandrines: when the Druid Panoramix (&quot;Getafix&quot; in the English translation)  meets his Alexandrian (Egyptian) friend the latter exclaims ''Je suis, mon cher ami, || très heureux de te voir'' at which Panoramix observes ''C'est un Alexandrin'' (&quot;That's an alexandrine!&quot;/&quot;He's an Alexandrian!&quot;). The pun can also be heard in the theatrical adaptations. The English translation renders this as &quot;My dear old Getafix || How good to see you here&quot;, with the reply &quot;Aha, an Alexandrine&quot;.

==Accentual-syllabic verse==
In [[accentual-syllabic verse]], it is a line of [[iambic]] [[hexameter]] - a line of six feet or measures (&quot;iambs&quot;), each of which has two syllables with an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable.  It is also usual for there to be a caesura between the sixth and seventh syllables (as the examples from [[Alexander Pope|Pope]] below illustrate).  [[Robert Bridges]] noted that in the lyrical sections of ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', [[John Milton|Milton]] significantly varied the placement of the caesura.

In the poetry of [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' 8 lines of pentameter are followed by an alexandrine, the 6-foot line slowing the regular rhythm of the 5-foot lines.  After Spenser, alexandrine couplets were used by [[Michael Drayton]] in his ''[[Poly-Olbion]]''.

[[Alexander Pope]] famously characterized the alexandrine's potential to slow or speed the flow of a poem in two rhyming [[couplet]]s consisting of an iambic pentameter followed by an alexandrine:
:A needless alexandrine ends the song
:that like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.
A few lines later Pope continues:
:Not so, when swift Camilla scours the Plain,
:Flies o'er th'unbending corn and skims along the Main.

Alexandrines are sometimes introduced into predominantly pentameter verse for the sake of variety. The [[Spenserian stanza]], for instance, is eight lines of pentameter followed by an alexandrine.  Alexandrines appear rarely in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] [[blank verse]].  In the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] and eighteenth century, poetry written in couplets is sometimes varied by the introduction of a triplet in which the third line is an alexandrine, as in this example from [[John Dryden|Dryden]], which introduces a triplet after two couplets: 
:But satire needs not those, and wit will shine
:Through the harsh cadence of a rugged line:
:A noble error, and but seldom made,
:When poets are by too much force betrayed.
:Thy generous fruits, though gathered ere their prime,
:Still showed a quickness; and maturing time
:But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of rhyme.

Alexandrines also formed the first line of the couplet form Poulter's Measure (the second line being a [[Fourteener (poetry)|fourteener]]) as exemplified in [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]]'s poem, ''Complaint of the Absence of her lover, being upon the sea'' (1547).

==Origin==
There is some doubt as to the origin of the name; but most probably it is derived from a [[Alexander Romance|collection of Alexandrine romances]], collected in the 12th century, of which [[Alexander the Great]] was the hero, and in which he was represented, somewhat like the British [[King Arthur|Arthur]], as the pride and crown of chivalry. Before the publication of this work most of the [[trouvère]] romances appeared in octosyllabic verse. There is also a theory that the form was invented by the 12th-century poet [[Alexander of Paris]]. The new work, which was henceforth to set the fashion to French literature, was written in lines of twelve syllables, but with a freedom of pause which was afterwards greatly curtailed. The new fashion, however, was not adopted all at once. The metre fell into disuse until the reign of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], when it was revived by [[Jean-Antoine de Baïf]], one of the seven poets known as [[La Pléiade]].

[[Image:Bifnordennomenclature.jpg|thumb|200px|A page from the ''Bombardier's Information File'' (BIF) that describes the components and controls of the [[Norden bombsight]]. The '''Norden bombsight''' was a highly sophisticated optical/mechanical analog computer used by the United States Army Air Force during [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]], and the [[Vietnam War]] to aid the pilot of a [[bomber]] aircraft in dropping [[bomb]]s accurately.]]

An '''analog computer''' is a form of [[computer]] that uses the continuously-changeable aspects of physical phenomena such as [[Electrical network|electrical]],&lt;ref&gt;Universiteit van Amsterdam Computer Museum, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mechanics|mechanical]], or [[hydraulic]] quantities to [[Scientific modelling|model]] the problem being solved. In contrast, digital computers represent varying quantities incrementally, as their numerical values change.

Mechanical analog computers were very important in [[Fire control system|gun fire control]] in World War II and the Korean War; they were made in significant numbers. In particular, development of [[transistor]]s made electronic analog computers practical, and before digital computers had developed sufficiently, they were commonly used in science and industry.

Analog computers can have a very wide range of complexity. [[Slide rule]]s and [[nomograph]]s are the simplest, while naval gunfire control computers and large hybrid digital/analog computers were among the most complicated.

Setting up an analog computer required scale factors to be chosen, along with initial conditions—that is, starting values. Another essential was creating the required network of interconnections between computing elements. Sometimes it was necessary to re-think the structure of the problem so that the computer would function satisfactorily. No variables could be allowed to exceed the computer's limits, and differentiation was to be avoided, typically by rearranging the &quot;network&quot; of interconnects, using integrators in a different sense.

Running an electronic analog computer, assuming a satisfactory setup, started with the computer held with some variables fixed at their initial values. Moving a switch released the holds and permitted the problem to run. In some instances, the computer could, after a certain running time interval, repeatedly return to the initial-conditions state to reset the problem, and run it again.

===Precursors===
{{List dispute|date=March 2011}}
&lt;!-- Editors should perhaps review if the following early devices are dubbed as 'computers' or just 'precursors of computers' in the sources. In case they are dubbed as 'computers', a computer scientist or expert should verify whether the sources are authoritative enough, or are reproducing lay misconceptions. --&gt;
This is a list of examples of early computation devices which are considered to be precursors of the modern computers. Some of them may even have been dubbed as 'computers' by the press, although they may fail to fit the modern definitions.

The relative resistance of the potentiometer was then equivalent to the formula of the equation being solved. Multiplication or division could be performed depending on which dials were considered inputs and which was the output. Accuracy and resolution was, of course, extremely limited and a simple slide rule was more accurate, however, the unit did demonstrate the basic principle.

==Electronic analog computers==
[[Image:AKAT-1.JPG|thumb|250px|Polish analog computer [[AKAT-1]].]]

The similarity between linear mechanical components, such as [[spring (device)|spring]]s and [[dashpot]]s (viscous-fluid dampers), and electrical components, such as [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, and [[resistor]]s is striking in terms of mathematics. They can be modeled using equations that are of essentially the same form.

However, the difference between these systems is what makes analog computing useful. If one considers a simple mass-spring system, constructing the physical system would require making or modifying the springs and masses. This would be followed by attaching them to each other and an appropriate anchor, collecting test equipment with the appropriate input range, and finally, taking measurements. In more complicated cases, such as suspensions for racing cars, experimental construction, modification, and testing is not so simple nor inexpensive.

The electrical equivalent can be constructed with a few [[operational amplifier]]s (Op amps) and some passive linear components; all measurements can be taken directly with an [[oscilloscope]]. In the circuit, the (simulated) 'stiffness of the spring', for instance, can be changed by adjusting a [[potentiometer]]. The electrical system is an analogy to the physical system, hence the name, but it is less expensive to construct, generally safer, and typically much easier to modify.

As well, an electronic circuit can typically operate at higher frequencies than the system being simulated. This allows the simulation to run faster than real time (which could, in some instances, be hours, weeks, or longer). Experienced users of electronic analog computers said that they offered a comparatively intimate control and understanding of the problem, relative to digital simulations.

The drawback of the mechanical-electrical analogy is that electronics are limited by the range over which the variables may vary. This is called [[dynamic range]]. They are also limited by [[noise (physics)|noise levels]]. Floating-point digital calculations have comparatively-huge dynamic range (good modern handheld scientific/engineering calculators have exponents of 500).

These electric circuits can also easily perform a wide variety of simulations. For example, [[voltage]] can simulate [[water pressure]] and [[electric current]] can simulate [[rate of flow]] in terms of cubic metres per second (in fact, given the proper scale factors, all that is required would be a stable resistor, in that case). Given flow rate and accumulated volume of liquid, a simple integrator provides the latter; both variables are voltages. In practice, current was rarely used in electronic analog computers, because voltage is much easier to work with.

Analog computers are especially well-suited to representing situations described by differential equations. Occasionally, they were used when a differential equation proved very difficult to solve by traditional means.

An electronic digital system uses two voltage levels to represent binary numbers. In many cases, the binary numbers are simply codes that correspond, for instance, to brightness of primary colors, or letters of the alphabet (or other  symbols). The manipulation of these binary numbers is how digital computers work. The electronic analog computer, however, manipulates electrical voltages that are proportional to the magnitudes of quantities in the problem being solved.

Accuracy of an analog computer is limited by its computing elements as well as quality of the internal power and electrical interconnections. The precision of the analog computer readout was limited chiefly by the precision of the readout equipment used, generally three or four significant figures. Precision of a [[digital computer]] is limited by the word size; [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]], while relatively slow, provides any practical degree of precision that might be needed.

==Analog-digital hybrid computers==
There is an intermediate device, a [[hybrid computer|'hybrid' computer]], in which an analog output is converted into  [[Numerical digit|digits]]. The information then can be sent into a standard digital computer for further computation. Because of their ease of use and because of technological breakthroughs in digital computers in the early 70s, the analog-digital hybrids were replacing the analog-only systems.

Hybrid computers are used to obtain a very [[accurate]] but not very [[Accuracy and precision|mathematically precise]] 'seed' value, using an analog computer front-end, which value is then fed into a digital computer, using an [[iterative]] process to achieve the final desired degree of [[Arithmetic precision|precision]]. With a three or four digit precision, highly-accurate numerical seed, the total computation time necessary to reach the desired precision is dramatically reduced, since many fewer digital iterations are required (and the analog computer reaches its result almost instantaneously). Or, for example, the analog computer might be used to solve a non-analytic differential equation problem for use at some stage of an overall computation (where precision is not very important). In any case, the hybrid computer is usually substantially faster than a digital computer, but can supply a far more precise computation than an analog computer. It is useful for [[real-time computing|real-time]] applications requiring such a combination (e.g., a high frequency [[phased-array radar]] or a weather system computation).

== Mechanisms ==
Electronic analog computers typically have front panels with numerous jacks (single-contact sockets) that permit patch cords (flexible wires with plugs at both ends) to create the interconnections which define the problem setup. In addition, there are precision high-resolution potentiometers (variable resistors) for setting up (and, when needed, varying) scale factors. In addition, there is likely to be a zero-center analog pointer-type meter for modest-accuracy voltage measurement. Stable, accurate voltage sources provide known magnitudes.

Typical electronic analog computers contain anywhere from a few to a hundred or more [[operational amplifier]]s (&quot;op amps&quot;), named because they perform mathematical operations. Op amps are a particular type of feedback amplifier with very high gain and stable input (low and stable offset). They are always used with precision feedback components that, in operation, all but cancel out the currents arriving from input components. The majority of op amps in a representative setup are summing amplifiers, which add and subtract analog voltages, providing the result at their output jacks. As well, op amps with capacitor feedback are usually included in a setup; they integrate the sum of their inputs with respect to time.

Integrating with respect to another variable is the nearly-exclusive province of mechanical analog integrators; it is almost never done in electronic analog computers. However, given that a problem solution does not change with time, time can serve as one of the variables.

Other computing elements include analog multipliers, nonlinear function generators, and analog comparators.

Inductors were never used in typical electronic analog computers, because their departure from ideal behavior is too great for computing of any great accuracy. Analog computer setups that at first would seem to require inductors can be rearranged and redefined to use capacitors. Capacitors and resistors, on the other hand, can be made much closer to ideal than inductors, which is why they constitute the majority of passive computing components.

The use of electrical properties in analog computers means that calculations are normally performed in [[real-time computing|real time]] (or faster), at a speed determined mostly by the frequency response of the operational amplifiers and other computing elements. In the history of electronic analog computers, there were some special high-speed types.

[[Nonlinear]] functions and calculations can be constructed to a limited precision (three or four digits) by designing [[function generator]]s — special circuits of various combinations of resistors and diodes to provide the nonlinearity. Typically, as the input voltage increases, progressively more diodes conduct.

When compensated for temperature, the forward voltage drop of a transistor's base-emitter junction can provide a usably-accurate logarithmic or exponential function. Op amps scale the output voltage so that it is usable with the rest of the computer.

Any physical process which models some computation can be interpreted as an analog computer. Some examples, invented for the purpose of illustrating the concept of analog computation, include using a bundle of [[spaghetti]] as [[Spaghetti sort|a model of ''sorting numbers'']]; a board, a set of nails, and a rubber band as a model of finding the ''[[convex hull]] of a set of points''; and strings tied together as a model of ''finding the shortest path in a network''. These are all described ''in'' A.K. Dewdney (see [[#References|citation]] below).

=== Mechanical analog computer mechanisms ===
While a wide variety of mechanisms have been developed throughout history, some stand out because of their theoretical importance, or because they were manufactured in significant quantities.

Most practical mechanical analog computers of any significant complexity used rotating shafts to carry variables from one mechanism to another. Cables and pulleys  were used in a Fourier synthesizer, a [[tide-predicting machine]], which summed the individual harmonic components. Another category, not nearly as well known, used rotating shafts only for input and output, with precision racks and pinions. The racks were connected to linkages that performed the computation. At least one US Naval sonar fire control computer of the later 1950s, made by Librascope, was of this type, as was the principal computer in the Mk. 56 Gun Fire Control System.

Online, there is a remarkably-clear illustrated reference (OP 1140) that describes [http://hnsa.org/doc/op1140/index.htm World War II mechanical analog fire control computer mechanisms]. Lacking access to OP 1140, a text description of many important mechanisms follows.

For adding and subtracting, precision miter-gear differentials were in common use in some computers; the Ford Instrument [[Mark I Fire Control Computer]] contained about 160 of them.

Integration with respect to another variable was done by a rotating disc driven by one variable. Output came from a pickoff device (such as a wheel) positioned at a radius on the disc proportional to the second variable. (A carrier with a pair of steel balls supported by small rollers worked especially well. A roller, its axis parallel to the disc's surface, provided the output. It was held against the pair of balls by a spring.)

Arbitrary functions of one variable were provided by cams, with gearing to convert follower movement to shaft rotation.

Functions of two variables were provided by three-dimensional cams. In one good design, one of the variables rotated the cam. A hemispherical follower moved its carrier on a pivot axis parallel to that of the cam's rotating axis. Pivoting motion was the output. The second variable moved the follower along the axis of the cam. One practical application was ballistics in gunnery.

Coordinate conversion from polar to rectangular was done by a mechanical resolver (called a &quot;component solver&quot; in US Navy fire control computers). Two discs on a common axis positioned a sliding block with pin (stubby shaft) on it. One disc was a face cam, and a follower on the block in the face cam's groove set the radius. The other disc, closer to the pin, contained a straight slot in which the block moved. The input angle rotated the latter disc (the face cam disc, for an unchanging radius, rotated with the other (angle) disc; a differential and a few gears did this correction).

Referring to the mechanism's frame, the location of the pin corresponded to the tip of the vector represented by the angle and magnitude inputs. Mounted on that pin was a square block.

Rectilinear-coordinate outputs (both sine and cosine, typically) came from two slotted plates, each slot fitting on the block just mentioned. The plates moved in straight lines, the movement of one plate at right angles to that of the other. The slots were at right angles to the direction of movement. Each plate, by itself, was like a Scotch yoke, known to steam engine enthusiasts.

During World War II, a similar mechanism converted rectilinear to polar coordinates, but it was not particularly successful and was eliminated in a significant redesign (USN, Mk. 1 to Mk. 1A).

Multiplication was done by mechanisms based on the geometry of similar right triangles. Using the trig. terms for a right triangle, specifically opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse, the adjacent side was fixed by construction. One variable changed the magnitude of the opposite side. In many cases, this variable changed sign; the hypotenuse could coincide with the adjacent side (a zero input), or move beyond the adjacent side, representing a sign change.

Typically, a pinion-operated rack moving parallel to the (trig.-defined) opposite side would position a slide with a slot coincident with the hypotenuse. A pivot on the rack let the slide's angle change freely. At the other end of the slide (the angle, in trig, terms), a block on a pin fixed to the frame defined the vertex between the hypotenuse and the adjacent side.

At any distance along the adjacent side, a line perpendicular to it intersects the hypotenuse at a particular point. The distance between that point and the adjacent side is some fraction that is the product of ''1'' the distance from the vertex, and ''2'' the magnitude of the opposite side.

The second input variable in this type of multiplier positions a slotted plate perpendicular to the adjacent side. That slot contains a block, and that block's position in its slot is determined by another block right next to it. The latter slides along the hypotenuse, so the two blocks are positioned at a distance from the (trig.) adjacent side by an amount proportional to the product.

To provide the product as an output, a third element, another slotted plate, also moves parallel to the (trig.) opposite side of the theoretical triangle. As usual, the slot is perpendicular to the direction of movement. A block in its slot, pivoted to the hypotenuse block positions it.

A special type of integrator, used at a point where only moderate accuracy was needed, was based on a steel ball, instead of a disc. It had two inputs, one to rotate the ball, and the other to define the angle of the ball's rotating axis. That axis was always in a plane that contained the axes of two movement-pickoff rollers, quite similar to the mechanism of a rolling-ball computer mouse (in this mechanism, the pickoff rollers were roughly the same diameter as the ball). The pickoff roller axes were at right angles.

A pair of rollers &quot;above&quot; and &quot;below&quot; the pickoff plane were mounted in rotating holders that were geared together. That gearing was driven by the angle input, and established the rotating axis of the ball. The other input rotated the &quot;bottom&quot; roller to make the ball rotate.

Essentially, the whole mechanism, called a component integrator, was a variable-speed drive with one motion input and two outputs, as well as an angle input. The angle input varied the ratio (and direction) of coupling between the &quot;motion&quot; input and the outputs according to the sine and cosine of the input angle.

Although they were did not accomplish any computation, electromechanical position servos were essential in mechanical analog computers of the &quot;rotating-shaft&quot; type for providing operating torque to the inputs of subsequent computing mechanisms, as well as driving output data-transmission devices such as large torque-transmitter synchros in naval computers.

Other non-computational mechanisms included internal odometer-style counters with interpolating drum dials for indicating internal variables, and mechanical multi-turn limit stops.

Considering that accurately-controlled rotational speed in analog fire-control computers was a basic element of their accuracy, there was a motor with its average speed controlled by a balance wheel, hairspring, jeweled-bearing differential, a twin-lobe cam, and spring-loaded contacts (ship's AC power frequency was not necessarily accurate, nor dependable enough, when these computers were designed).

== Components ==
[[Image:NewmarkAnalogueComputer.jpg|thumb|A 1960 Newmark analogue computer, made up of five units. This computer was used to solve [[differential equation]]s and is currently housed at the Cambridge Museum of Technology.]]

Analog computers often have a complicated framework, but they have, at their core, a set of key components which perform the calculations, which the operator manipulates through the computer's framework.

Key hydraulic components might include pipes, valves and containers.

Key mechanical components might include rotating shafts for carrying data within the computer, miter-gear differentials, disc/ball/roller integrators, cams (2-D and 3-D), mechanical resolvers and multipliers, and torque servos.

Key electrical/electronic components might include:
* Precision resistors and capacitors
* [[operational amplifier]]s
* [[Analog multiplier|Multipliers]]
* [[potentiometer]]s
* fixed-[[function generator]]s

The core mathematical operations used in an electric analog computer are:
* [[summation]]
* [[Integral|integration]] with respect to time
* [[additive inverse|inversion]]
* [[multiplication]]
* [[exponentiation]]
* [[logarithm]]
* [[Division (mathematics)|division]], although multiplication is much preferred

Differentiation with respect to time is not frequently used, and in practice is avoided by redefining the problem when possible. It corresponds in the frequency domain to a high-pass filter, which means that high-frequency noise is amplified; differentiation also risks instability.

== Limitations ==
In general, analog computers are limited by non-ideal effects. An analog signal is composed of four basic components: DC and AC magnitudes, frequency, and phase. The real limits of range on these characteristics limit analog computers. Some of these limits include the operational amplifier offset, finite gain, and frequency response, [[noise floor]], [[non-linearity|non-linearities]], [[temperature coefficient]], and [[Microelectronics|parasitic effects]] within semiconductor devices. For commercially available electronic components, ranges of these aspects of input and output signals are always [[figures of merit]].

== Current research ==
Although digital computation is extremely popular, some research in analog computation is still being done. A few universities still use analog computers to teach control system theory. [http://www.comdyna.com/ Comdyna] manufactured small analog computers until roughly the end of the 20th century. At Indiana University Bloomington, [http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~jwmills/ANALOG.NOTEBOOK/klm/klm.html Jonathan Mills] has developed the Extended Analog Computer based on sampling voltages in a foam sheet. At the [http://hrl.harvard.edu/ Harvard Robotics Laboratory], analog computation is a research topic. [http://www.lyricsemiconductor.com/ Lyric Semiconductor]'s error correction circuits use analog probabilistic signals.

[[Analog synthesizer|Analog (audio) synthesizer]]s can also be viewed as a form of analog computer, and their technology was originally based in part on electronic analog computer technology. The ARP 2600's Ring Modulator was actually an moderate-accuracy analog multiplier.

The Simulation Council (or Simulations Council) was an association of analog computer users in USA. It is now known as the  The Society of Modeling and Simulation International. The Simulation Council newsletters from 1952 to 1963 are available online and show the concerns and technologies at the time, and the common use of analog computers for missilry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scs.org/history/SimCouncilNewsletters/Default.htm Simulation Council newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Real computers ==
Computer theorists often refer to idealized analog computers as [[Real computation|real computer]]s (because they operate on the set of [[real number]]s). Digital computers, by contrast, must first [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantize]] the signal into a finite number of values, and so can only work with the [[rational number]] set (or, with an approximation of irrational numbers).

These idealized analog computers may ''in theory'' solve problems that are [[Computational complexity theory#Intractability|intractable]] on digital computers; however as mentioned, in reality, analog computers are far from attaining this ideal, largely because of noise minimization problems. ''In theory'', ambient noise is limited by [[quantum noise]] (caused by the quantum movements of ions). Ambient noise may be severely reduced&amp;nbsp;– but never to zero&amp;nbsp;– by using [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] cooled [[Parametric oscillator|parametric amplifiers]]. Moreover, given unlimited time and memory, the (ideal) digital computer may also solve real number problems.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Refimprove|date=December 2006}}
{{merge from|Minute of Angle|date=October 2010}}

A '''minute of arc'''; '''arcminute'''; or '''minute of angle''' ('''MOA'''), is a unit of [[angle|angular measurement]], equal to one sixtieth ({{frac|1|60}}) of one [[degree (angle)|degree]].  In turn, a '''second of arc''' or '''arcsecond''' is one sixtieth ({{frac|1|60}}) of one minute of arc.  These are not [[International System of Units|SI units]], but are accepted for use with calculations involving SI units.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter4/table6.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since one degree is defined as one three hundred and sixtieth ({{frac|1|360}}) of a circle, 1 minute of arc is {{frac|1|21,600}} of the same. It is used in those fields which require a unit for the expression of small angles, such as [[astronomy]], [[navigation]] and [[marksmanship]].

The number of square arcminutes in a complete sphere is
: &lt;math&gt;4 \pi \left(\frac{1}{\pi}10\,800\right)^2 = \frac{1}{\pi}466\,560\,000,&lt;/math&gt;
or approximately 148,510,660.498 square arcminutes.

The arcsecond is {{frac|1|3,600}} of a degree, or {{frac|1|1,296,000}} of a circle, or ({{frac|π|648,000}}) [[radian]]s, which is approximately {{frac|1|206,265}} [[radian]].

To express even smaller angles, standard [[SI prefix]]es can be  employed; in particular, the '''milliarcsecond''', abbreviated '''mas''', is sometimes used in [[astronomy]].

==Symbols and abbreviations==
The standard symbol for marking the arcminute is the [[prime (symbol)|prime]] (′) (U+2032), though a single quote (') (U+0027) is commonly used where only [[ASCII]] characters are permitted. One arcminute is thus written 1′.  It is also abbreviated as '''arcmin''' or '''amin''' or, less commonly, the prime with a [[circumflex]] over it (&lt;math&gt;\hat{'}&lt;/math&gt;).

The standard symbol for the arcsecond is the [[double prime]] (″) (U+2033), though a double quote (&quot;) (U+0022) is commonly used where only [[ASCII]] characters are permitted. One arcsecond is thus written 1″.  It is also abbreviated as '''arcsec''' or '''asec'''.

In [[celestial navigation]], seconds of arc are rarely used in calculations, the preference usually being for degrees, minutes and decimals of a minute, written for example as 42° 25′.32 or 42° 25′.322.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CELESTIAL NAVIGATION COURSE|url=http://www.learntonavigate.com/celestial.htm|publisher=International Navigation School|accessdate=4 November 2010|quote=It is a straight forward method [to obtain a position at sea] and requires no mathematical calculation beyond addition and subtraction of degrees and minutes and decimals of minutes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Astro Navigation Syllabus|url=http://www.kumquat-data.com/Astro%20Navigation%20Syllabus.htm|accessdate=4 November 2010|quote=[Sextant errors] are sometimes [given] in seconds of arc, which will need to be converted to decimal minutes when you include them in your calculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notation has been carried over into [[Global Positioning System|marine GPS]] receivers, which normally display latitude and longitude in the latter format by default.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shipmate GN30|url=http://norinco.co.in/NCMS/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=53&amp;Itemid=81|publisher=Norinco|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
===Firearms===
The arcminute is commonly found in the [[firearm]]s industry and literature, particularly that concerning the accuracy of [[rifle]]s, though the industry tends to refer to it as '''minute of angle'''. It is popular because 1&amp;nbsp;MOA [[subtend]]s approximately one [[inch]] at 100 [[yard]]s, a traditional distance on [[Shooting range|target ranges]]. A shooter can easily readjust their rifle [[telescopic sight|scope]] by measuring the distance in inches the bullet hole is from the desired impact point, and adjusting the scope that many MOA in the same direction. Most target scopes designed for long distances are adjustable in quarter ({{frac|1|4}}) or eighth ({{frac|1|8}}) MOA increments or ''clicks''. One eighth MOA is equal to approximately an eighth of an inch at 100 yards or one inch at 800 yards.

Calculating the physical equivalent group size equal to one minute of arc can be done using the equation: equivalent group size = tan({{frac|MOA|60}})&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;distance. In the example previously given and substituting 3,600&amp;nbsp;inches for 100 yards, 3,600 tan({{frac|1 MOA|60}}) inches = 1.047&amp;nbsp;inches.

In [[metric units]] 1 MOA at 100 meters = 2.908 centimeters.

Sometimes, a firearm's accuracy will be measured in MOA. This simply means that under ideal conditions, the gun with certain ammunition is capable of producing a group of shots whose center points (center-to-center) fit into a circle, the average diameter of circles in several groups can be subtended by that amount of arc. For example, a ''1 MOA rifle'' should be capable, under ideal conditions, of shooting an average 1-inch groups at 100 yards, a ''2 MOA rifle'' an average 2-inch groups at 100 yards, etc. Some manufacturers such as [[Weatherby]] and [[Cooper Firearms of Montana|Cooper]] offer actual guarantees of real-world MOA performance.

Rifle manufacturers and gun magazines often refer to this capability as ''sub-MOA'', meaning it shoots under 1 MOA. This is typically a single group of 3 to 5 shots at 100 yards, or the average of several groups. If larger samples are taken (i.e., more shots per group) then group size typically increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Robert E. |last=Wheeler |date= |title=Statistical notes on rifle group patterns |url=http://www.bobwheeler.com/guns/GroupStat.pdf |accessdate=21 May 2009|mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |unused_data=mdy |first=Denton |last=Bramwell |month=January |year=2009 |title=Group Therapy The Problem: How accurate is your rifle? |url=http://www.longrangehunting.com/articles/accurate-rifle-groups-1.php |journal=Varmint Hunter |volume=69 |accessdate=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example mathematical statistical calculation yields the following accuracy for exactly the same rifle and ammunition combination (standard deviations of every shot from center is 1 MOA):&lt;br&gt;

===Cartography===
Minutes of angle (and its subunit, seconds of angle or SOA&amp;mdash;equal to a sixtieth of a MOA) are also used in [[cartography]] and [[navigation]]. At [[sea level]], one minute of angle (around the [[equator]] or a [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]]) equals about {{convert|1.86|km|mi|disp=/}}), approximately one [[nautical mile]] (approximately, because the [[Earth]] is slightly [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]]); a second of angle is one sixtieth of this amount: about 30 meters or 100 feet.

Traditionally positions are given using degrees, minutes, and seconds of angles in two measurements: one for [[latitude]], the angle north or south of the [[equator]]; and one for [[longitude]], the angle east or west of the [[Prime Meridian]]. Using this method, any position on or above the Earth's [[reference ellipsoid]] can be precisely given. However, because of the somewhat clumsy base-60 nature of MOA and SOA, many people now prefer to give positions using degrees only, expressed in decimal form to an equal amount of precision. Degrees, given to three decimal places ({{frac|1|1,000}} of a degree), have about {{frac|1|4}} the precision as degrees-minutes-seconds ({{frac|1|3,600}} of a degree), and so identify locations within about 120 meters or 400 feet.

===Property cadastral surveying===
Related to cartography, property boundary [[surveying]] using the [[metes and bounds]] system relies on fractions of a degree to describe property lines' angles in reference to [[cardinal direction]]s.  A boundary &quot;mete&quot; is described with a beginning reference point, the cardinal direction North or South followed by an angle less than 90 degrees and a second cardinal direction, and a linear distance. The boundary runs the specified linear distance from the beginning point, the direction of the distance being determined by rotating the first cardinal direction the specified angle toward the second cardinal direction. For example, ''North&amp;nbsp;65°&amp;nbsp;39′ 18″ West&amp;nbsp;85.69&amp;nbsp;feet'' would describe a line running from the starting point 85.69 feet in a direction 65° 39′ 18″ (or 65.655°) away from north toward the west.

===Astronomy===
The arcminute and arcsecond are also used in [[astronomy]]. Degrees (and therefore arcminutes) are used to measure [[declination]], or angular distance north or south of the [[celestial equator]].  The arcsecond is also often used to describe [[parallax]], due to very small parallax angles for [[stellar parallax]], and tiny angular diameters (e.g., Venus varies between 10′ and 60′). The parallax, [[proper motion]] and angular diameter of a star may also be written in milliarcseconds (mas), or thousandths of an arcsecond. The [[parsec]] gets its name from &quot;parallax second&quot;, for those arcseconds.

Apart from the sun, the star with the largest [[angular diameter]] from Earth is [[R Doradus]], a red [[supergiant]] with a diameter of 0.05 arcsecond. Due to the effects of atmospheric [[astronomical seeing|seeing]], ground-based [[telescope]]s will smear the image of a star to an angular diameter of about 0.5 arcsecond; in poor seeing conditions this increases to 1.5 arcseconds or even more. The dwarf planet [[Pluto]] has proven difficult to resolve because its [[angular diameter]] is about 0.1 arcsecond.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/plutofact.html NASA.gov] Pluto Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt; This is roughly equivalent to a (40&amp;nbsp;mm) [[Table tennis|ping-pong]] ball viewed at a distance of 50 miles (80&amp;nbsp;km).

The article on ''[[Angular_diameter#Use_in_astronomy|Angular diameter]]'' lists the angular diameter of various celestial bodies.

Space telescopes are not affected by the Earth's atmosphere but are [[Diffraction limit#Diffraction limit of telescopes|diffraction limited]]. For example, the [[Hubble space telescope]] can reach an angular size of stars down to about 0.1″. Techniques exist for improving seeing on the ground. [[Adaptive optics]], for example, can produce images around 0.05 arcsecond on a 10&amp;nbsp;m class telescope.

===Human vision===
In humans, [[Visual acuity#.22Normal.22 vision|20/20 vision]] is the ability to resolve a [[spatial pattern]] separated by a [[visual angle]] of one minute of arc.
A 20/20 letter subtends 5 minutes of arc total.

===Materials===
The deviation from parallelism between two surfaces, for instance in [[optical engineering]], is usually measured in arcminutes or arcsecond.

'''Alberto Giacometti''' (10 October 1901 Borgonovo, Stampa – 11 January 1966) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]]  [[Sculpture|sculptor]], [[Painting|painter]],  [[drawing|draughtsman]], and [[printmaking|printmaker]]. 

Alberto Giacometti was born in the canton [[Graubünden]]'s southerly alpine valley [[Val Bregaglia]] and came from an artistic background; his father, [[Giovanni Giacometti|Giovanni]], was a well-known [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] painter. Alberto was the eldest of four children and was interested in art from the beginning of his life.

== Early life ==
[[Image:'Woman of Venice (II)', painted bronze sculpture by Alberto Giacometti, 1956, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|100px|left|''&quot;Woman of Venice II&quot;'', 1956, painted bronze sculpture, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]

Giacometti was born in [[Borgonovo]], now part of the Swiss municipality of [[Stampa]], near the Italian border.  His family was descended from Protestant refugees escaping the Italian [[Inquisition]].  His father, [[Giovanni Giacometti]], was a painter. Alberto attended the School of [[Fine art|Fine Arts]] in [[Geneva]]. 

In 1922 he moved to Paris to study under the sculptor [[Antoine Bourdelle]], an associate of [[Auguste Rodin]]. It was there that Giacometti experimented with [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]] and came to be regarded as one of the leading surrealist sculptors. Among his associates were [[Joan Miró]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Balthus]].

Between 1936 and 1940, Giacometti concentrated his sculpting on the human head, focusing on the sitter's gaze. He preferred models he was close to, his brother and the artist [[Isabel Rawsthorne]] (then known as Isabel Delmer). This was followed by a unique artistic phase in which his statues of Isabel became stretched out; her limbs elongated.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times article on ''The Women of Giacometti'' exhibition, Pace Wildenstein Gallery 2005 [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/20/arts/design/20kino.html?pagewanted=all]&lt;/ref&gt; Obsessed with creating his sculptures exactly as he envisaged through his unique view of reality, he often carved until they were as thin as nails and reduced to the size of a pack of cigarettes, much to his consternation. A friend of his once said that if Giacometti decided to sculpt you, &quot;he would make your head look like the blade of a knife.&quot; After his marriage to Annette Arm his tiny sculptures became larger, but the larger they grew, the thinner they became. Giacometti said that the final result represented the sensation he felt when he looked at a woman.

His paintings underwent a parallel procedure. The figures appear isolated, are severely attenuated, and are the result of continuous reworking. Subjects were frequently revisited: one of his favorite models was his younger brother [[Diego Giacometti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=5141&amp;searchid=8724 Tate Collection: Seated Man by Alberto Giacometti] Retrieved July 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A third brother [[Bruno Giacometti]] is a Swiss architect.

In 1962, he was awarded the grand prize for sculpture at the [[Venice Biennale]], and the award brought with it worldwide fame. Even when he had achieved popularity and his work was in demand, he still reworked models, often destroying them or setting them aside to be returned to years later. The prints produced by Giacometti are often overlooked but the catalogue raisonné, ''Giacometti - The Complete Graphics and 15 Drawings by Herbert Lust'' (Tudor 1970), comments on their impact and gives details of the number of copies of each print. Some of his most important images were in editions of only 30 and many were described as rare in 1970.

In his later years Giacometti's works were shown in a number of large exhibitions throughout Europe. Riding a wave of international popularity, and despite his declining health, he travelled to the United States in 1965 for an exhibition of his works at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. As his last work he prepared the text for the book ''Paris sans fin'', a sequence of 150 lithographs containing memories of all the places where he had lived.

Giacometti died in 1966 of [[heart disease]] ([[pericarditis]]) and [[chronic bronchitis]] at the Kantonsspital in [[Chur]], Switzerland. His body was returned to his birthplace in Borgonovo, where he was interred close to his parents. In May 2007 the executor of his widow's estate, French foreign minister [[Roland Dumas]], was convicted of illegally selling Giacometti's works to a top auctioneer. The auctioneer, Jacques Tajan, was also convicted. Both were ordered to pay €850,000 to the Alberto and Annette Giacometti Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title= Conviction Upheld Against Former French FM in Giacometti Fraud   | date= May 10, 2007| url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/25058/conviction-upheld-against-former-french-fm-in-giacometti-fraud/ | accessdate=2008-04-16 | postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic analysis ==

Giacometti was a key player in the Surrealist Movement, but his work resists easy categorization. Some describe it as formalist, others argue it is expressionist or otherwise having to do with what [[Deleuze]] calls 'blocs of sensation' (as in Deleuze's analysis of [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]). Even after his excommunication from the Surrealist group, while the intention of his sculpting was usually imitation, the end products were an expression of his emotional response to the subject. He attempted to create renditions of his models the way he saw them, and the way he thought they ought to be seen. He once said that he was sculpting not the human figure but &quot;the shadow that is cast.&quot; His figures resembled the way he looked upon himself.

Scholar [[William Barrett (philosopher)|William Barrett]] in ''Irrational Man: A Study in Existential Philosophy'' (1962), argues that the attenuated forms of Giacometti's figures reflect the view of 20th century [[modernism]] and [[existentialism]] that modern life is increasingly empty and devoid of meaning.
&quot;All the sculptures of today, like those of the past, will end one day in pieces... So it is important to fashion ones work carefully in its smallest recess and charge every particle of matter with life.&quot;

The term '''anthem''' means either a specific form of [[Anglican church music]] (in [[music theory]] and religious contexts), or more generally, a song (or composition) of celebration, usually acting as a symbol for a distinct group of people, as in the term &quot;[[national anthem]]&quot; or &quot;[[sports anthem]]&quot;.

==Etymology==

The word is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{polytonic|ἀντίφωνα}} (''antiphōna'') via [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|''antefn''}}, a word which originally had the same meaning as [[antiphon]].

==Anthems and the church==

An anthem is a form of church music, particularly in the service of the [[Church of England]], in which it is appointed by the [[rubric]]s to follow the third [[collect]] at both morning and evening prayer. Several anthems are included in the [[Coronation of the British monarch|British coronation service]]. The words are selected from [[Holy Scripture]] or in some cases from the [[Liturgy]], and the music is generally more elaborate and varied than that of [[psalm]] or [[hymn tune]]s. Though the anthem of the Church of England is analogous to the [[motet]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Lutheran Church]]es, both being written for a trained [[choir]] and not for the congregation, it is as a [[musical form]] essentially English in its origin and development. 

The anthem developed as a replacement for the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] &quot;votive antiphon&quot; commonly sung as an appendix to the main [[Liturgy of the Hours|office]] to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] or other saints. Although anthems were written in the [[Elizabethan period]] by [[Thomas Tallis|Tallis]] (1505–1585), [[William Byrd|Byrd]] (1539–1623), and others, they are not mentioned in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] until 1662, when the famous [[rubric]] &quot;In quires and places where they sing here followeth the Anthem&quot; first appears.

In common usage among many [[Protestant]] churches, an &quot;anthem&quot; often refers to any short sacred [[Choral_music#Historical_overview_of_choral_music|choral work]] presented during the course of a [[worship service]]. In the context of an Anglican service, an &quot;anthem&quot; is a composition to an English religious text. From this widening usage has come the more modern sense of the word.

==Music theory==

Early anthems tended to be simple and [[homophony|homophonic]] in texture, in order that the words could be clearly heard. Late in the sixteenth century the &quot;[[verse anthem]]&quot;, in which passages for solo voices alternated with passages for full choir, began to evolve. This became the dominant form in the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] period, when composers such as [[Henry Purcell]] (1659–1695) and [[John Blow]] (1649–1708) wrote elaborate examples for the [[Chapel Royal]] with orchestral accompaniment. In the nineteenth century [[Samuel Sebastian Wesley]] (1810–1876) wrote anthems influenced by contemporary [[oratorio]] which could stretch to several [[movement (music)|movements]] and last twenty minutes or longer. Later in the same century, [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] (1852–1924) composed examples which used symphonic techniques to produce a more concise and unified structure.

Many anthems have been produced since this time, generally by [[organist]]s rather than professional [[composer]]s and often in a conservative style. Major composers have tended to compose anthems in response to commissions and for special occasions. Examples include [[Edward Elgar]]'s ''Great is the Lord'' (1912) and ''Give unto the Lord'' (1914) (both with orchestral accompaniment), [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[Rejoice in the Lamb]]'' (1943) (a modern example of a multi-movement anthem and today heard mainly as a concert piece), and, on a much smaller scale, [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]' ''O taste and see'' (1952) (written for the coronation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]). With the relaxation of the rule, in [[England]] at least, that anthems should be only in English, the repertoire has been greatly enhanced by the addition of many works from the Latin repertoire.

==Modern use==

The word &quot;anthem&quot; is commonly used to describe a celebratory song or composition for a distinct group, as in the term &quot;national anthem&quot;. Many [[pop song]]s are used as anthems, such as [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s &quot;[[We are the Champions]]&quot;, which is commonly used as a [[sports anthem]]. The term &quot;anthemic&quot; is a modern word coined to describe music with a celebratory connotation to it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Albrecht Altdorfer 029.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Resurrection by Altdorfer, 1518]]

'''Albrecht Altdorfer''' (born in [[Bavaria]] in 1480 and died February 12, 1538 in [[Regensburg]] at the age of 58). was a German painter, [[printmaker]] and [[architect]] of the [[Renaissance]] era. He acquired an interest in art from his father, Ulrich Altdorfer, who was a painter and miniaturist. At the start of his career, he won public attention by creating small, intimate modestly scaled works in unconventional media and with eccentric subject matter. He settled in Regensburg, a town located on the [[Danube_River|Danube River]] in 1505, eventually becoming the town architect and a town councillor. Around 1511 or earlier, he travelled down the river and south into the Alps, where the scenery moved him so deeply that he became the first landscape painter in the modern sense &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Linda|title=The High Renaissance and Mannerism|year=1967|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London, England|isbn=0-500-20162-5|pages=246-247}}&lt;/ref&gt;, making him the leader of the [[Danube School]], a circle that pioneered landscape as an independent genre, in southern [[Germany]]. The remains of Altdorfer's surviving work comprises 55 panels, 120 drawings, 125 woodcuts, 78 engravings, 36 etchings, 24 paintings on parchment and fragments from a mural for the bathhouse of the Kaiserhof in Regensburg. This production extends at least over the period 1504-1537. He was a very self-confident artist and signed and dated each one of his works. 

==Painting==
Altdorfer is famous for being the pioneer painter of pure landscape, making them the subject of the painting, as well as compositions dominated by their landscape. He believed that the human figure shouldn't disrupt nature, but rather participate in it or imitate its natural processes. Taking and developing the landscape style of [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], he shows the hilly landscape of the Danube valley with thick forests of drooping and crumbling firs and larches hung with moss, and often dramatic colouring from a rising or setting sun.  His ''Landscape with footbridge'' ([[National Gallery, London]]) of 1518-1520 is claimed to be the first pure landscape in oil. In this painting, Altdorfer places a large tree that is cut off by the margins at the center of the landscape, making it the central axis and focus within the piece. He uses [[Anthropomorphize|anthropomorphism]] to give the tree human qualities such as the drapery of its limbs. He also made many fine finished drawings, mostly landscapes, in pen and [[watercolour]] such as the ''Landscape with the Woodcutter'' in 1522. The drawing opens at ground level on a clearing surrounding an enormous tree that is placed in the center, dominating the picture. It poses and gesticulates as if it was human, splaying its branches out in every corner. Halfway up the tree trunk, hangs a gabled shrine. At the time, a shrine like this might shelter an image of the Crucifixion or the Virgin Mary, but since it is turned away from the viewer, we are not sure what it truly is. At the bottom of the tree, a tiny figure of a seated man, crossed legged, holds a knife and axe, declaring his status in society/occupation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Christopher W.|title=Albrecht Altdorfer and the Origins of Landscape|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also, he often painted scenes of historical and Biblical subjects, set in atmospheric landscapes. His best religious scenes are intense, sometimes verging on the expressionistic, and often depict moments of intimacy between Christ and his mother, or various saints. His most famous religious artwork is ''The Legend of St. Sebastian and the Passion of Christ'' that decorated the altar in the St. Florian monastery in [[Linz]], Austria. Half of the piece is located in the Abbey Museum in St. Florian, Germany and depict the ''Agony in the Garden'' and the ''Flagellation of Christ''. The final two panels of the altarpiece are currently located in Vienna and depict the final scenes of Christ's Passion: the Burial and the Resurrection. Both these paintings share a similar formal structure that consists of an open landscape that is seen beyond and through the opening of a dark grotto. 

Altdorfer often distorts perspective to subtle effect. His donor figures are often painted completely out of scale with the main scene, as in paintings of the previous centuries. He also painted some portraits; overall his painted oeuvre was not large. In his later works, Altdorfer moved more towards mannerism and began to depict the human form to the conformity of the Italian model, as well as dominate the picture with frank colors.

==Paintings in Munich==
[[Image:Altdorfer Alexander.jpg|left|thumb|250px|''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus|The Battle of Issus/Alexander]]'', 1529,  &lt;br /&gt;Wood, 158,4 x 120,3 cm Alte Pinakothek, Munich.]]
His rather atypical ''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus|Battle of Issus]]'' (or of ''[[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'') of 1529 was commissioned by [[William IV, Duke of Bavaria]] as part of a series of eight historical battle scenes destined to hang in the Residenz in Munich. If ever a work of art merited comparison with epic poetry, &quot;The Battle of Issus&quot; is it. Albrecht Altdorfer's depiction of the moment in 333 B.C. when Alexander the Great routed Darius III for supremacy in Asia Minor is vast in ambition, sweeping in scope, vivid in imagery, rich in symbols, and obviously heroic—the Iliad of painting, as literary critic Friedrich Schlegel suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DOBRZYNSKI|first=JUDITH H.|title=An Epic Poem in Paint: The story of 'The Battle of Issus' and Albrecht Altdorfer|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704888404574547873533463760.html?mod=article-outset-box|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the painting, a swarming cast of thousands of soldiers surround the central action: Alexander on his white steed, leading two rows of charging cavalrymen, dashes after a fleeing Darius, who looks anxiously over his shoulder from a chariot. The opposing armies are distinguished by the colors of their uniforms: Darius' army in red and Alexander's in blue. The upper half of ''The Battle of Alexander'' expands with unreal rapidity into an arcing panorama comprehending vast coiling tracts of globe and sky. The victory also lies on the planar surface; The sun outshone the moon just as the Imperial and allied army successfully repel the Turks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Christopher S.|title=Albrecht Altdorfer and the Origins of Landscape|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;. |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=January 2, 2010 |accessdate=2010-01-03 | first=Judith H. | last=Dobrzynski}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is his most famous, and certainly one of his best works. By making the mass number of soldiers blend within the landscape/painting, it shows that he believed that the usage and depiction of landscape was just as significant as a historical event, such as a war. He renounced the office of Major of Regensburg to accept the commission. Few of his other paintings resemble this apocalyptic scene of two huge armies dominated by an extravagant landscape seen from a very high viewpoint, which looks south over the whole Mediterranean from modern Turkey to include the island of [[Cyprus]] and the mouths of the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]] (behind the isthmus to the left) on the other side.  However his style here is a development of that of a number of miniatures of battle-scenes he had done much earlier for [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] in his [[illuminated manuscript]] ''Triumphal Procession'' in 1512-14. [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Albrecht_Altdorfer_039.jpg]  It is thought to be the earliest painting to show the curvature of the Earth from a great height.

The ''Battle'' is now in the [[Alte Pinakothek]], which has the best collection of Altdorfer's paintings, including also his small ''St. George and the Dragon'' (1510), in oil on [[parchment]], where the two figures are tiny and almost submerged in the lush, dense forest that towers over them. Altdorfer seems to exaggerate the measurements of the forest in comparison to the figures: the leaves appear to be larger than the horse, showing the significance of nature and landscape. He also emphasizes line within the work, by displaying the upward growth of the forest with the vertical and diagonal lines of the trunks. There is a small opening of the forest on the lower right hand corner that provides a rest for your eyes. It serves to create depth within the painting and is the only place you can see the characters. The human form is completely absorbed by the thickness of the forest. Fantastic light effects provide a sense of mystery and dissolve the outline of objects. Without the contrast of light, the figures would blend in with its surrounding environment. Altdorfer's figures are invariably the complement of his romantic landscapes; for them he borrowed [[Albrecht_Durer|Albrecht Durer's ]] inventive iconography, but the panoramic setting is personal and has nothing to do with the fantasy landscapes of the Netherlands &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Linda|title=The High Renaissance and Mannerism|year=1967|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd.|location=London, England|isbn=0-500-20163-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Susanna In the Bath and the Stoning of the Elders'' (1526) set outside an Italianate skyscraper of a palace shows his interest in architecture. [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Albrecht_Altdorfer_037.jpg] Another small oil on parchment, ''Danube Landscape with Castle Wörth'' (c 1520) is one of the earliest accurate topographical paintings of a particular building in its setting, of a type that was to become a cliché in later centuries.

==Printmaking==
[[Image:Albrecht Altdorfer 045.jpg|thumb|right|230px|St George and the Dragon, 1510, [[Alte Pinakothek]], oil on parchment, 28 x 23 cm]]
He was a significant [[printmaker]] with numerous [[engraving]]s and about ninety-three [[woodcut]]s.  These included some for the ''Triumphs of Maximilian'', where he followed the overall style presumably set by [[Hans Burgkmair]], although he was able to escape somewhat from this in his depictions of the more disorderly baggage-train, still coming through a mountain landscape.  However most of his best [[Old master print|prints]] are [[etching]]s, many of landscapes; in these he was able most easily to use his drawing style.[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/intg/ho_1993.1097.htm]  He was one of the most successful early etchers, and was unusual for his generation of German printmakers in doing no book illustrations. He often combined etching and engraving techniques in a single plate, and produced about 122 intaglio prints altogether.

==Public life==
As the superintendent of the municipal buildings Altdorfer had overseen the construction of several commercial structures, such as a slaughterhouse and a building for wine storage, possibly even designing them. He was considered to be an outstanding politician of his day. In 1517 he was a member of the &quot;Ausseren Rates&quot;, the council on external affairs, and in this capacity was involved in the expulsion of the Jews, the destruction of the synagogue and in its place the construction of a church and shrine to the Schöne Maria that occurred in 1519. Altdorfer made etchings of the interior of the synagogue and designed a woodcut of the cult image of the Schöne Maria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pioch|first=Nicolas|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/altdorfer/|title=Altdorfer, Albrecht}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1529-1530 he was also charged with reinforcing certain city fortifications in response to the Turkish threat.

Albrecht's brother, [[Erhard Altdorfer]], was also a painter and printmaker in woodcut and engraving, and a pupil of [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].

The '''House of Ascania''' ({{lang-de|Askanier}})  was a [[dynasty]] of German rulers. It was also known as the '''House of Anhalt''', after [[Anhalt]], its longest-held possession.

The Ascanians are named after Ascania (or Ascaria) Castle, which is located near and named after [[Aschersleben]]. The castle was seat of the County of Ascania, a title that was later subsumed into the titles of the princes of Anhalt.

== History ==

The earliest known member of the house, [[Esiko, Count of Ballenstedt]], first appears in a document of 1036, and is assumed to have been a grandson (through his mother) of [[Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark]]. From Odo, the Ascanians inherited large properties in the [[Saxon Eastern March]].

Esiko's grandson was [[Otto, Count of Ballenstedt]], who died in 1123.  By Otto's marriage to [[Eilika of Saxony|Eilika]], daughter of [[Magnus, Duke of Saxony]], the Ascanians became heirs to half of the property of the House of [[Billung]], former dukes of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. 

Otto's son, [[Albert the Bear]], became, with the help of his mother's inheritance, the first Ascanian duke of Saxony in 1139. But he lost control of Saxony soon to the rival [[House of Guelph]].

However, Albert inherited the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] from its last [[Wends|Wendish]] ruler, [[Pribislav of Brandenburg|Pribislav]], in 1157, and became the first Ascanian margrave. Albert, and his descendants of the House of Ascania, then made considerable progress in [[Christianity|Christianizing]] and [[Germanisation|Germanizing]] the lands. As a borderland between German and [[Slavs|Slavic]] cultures, the country was known as a [[marches|march]]. 

In 1237 and 1244 two towns, [[Cölln]] and Berlin were founded during the rule of Otto and Johann, grandsons of Margrave Albert the Bear, (later they were united into one city, [[Berlin]]). The emblem of the House of Ascania, red eagle and bear, became the heraldric emblems of Berlin.

In 1320 the Brandenburg Ascanian line came to an end.

After the Emperor had deposed the Guelph rulers of Saxony in 1180, Ascanians returned to rule the Duchy of Saxony, which had been reduced to its eastern half by the Emperor. However, even in eastern Saxony, the Ascanians could establish control only in limited areas, mostly near the River Elbe. 

In the 13th century, the Principality of [[Anhalt]] was split off from the Duchy, and later, the remaining state was split into [[Saxe-Lauenburg]] and [[Saxe-Wittenberg]]. The Ascanian dynasties in the two Saxon states became extinct in 1689 and in 1422, respectively, but Ascanians continued to rule in the smaller state of Anhalt and its various subdivisions until monarchy was abolished in 1918. 

[[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]], Empress of Russia from 1762-1796, was a member of the House of Ascania, herself the daughter of [[Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst]].

In [[physics]], '''acceleration''' is the rate of change of [[velocity]] over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Principles of Mechanics|first=Henry|last=Crew|publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC|year=2008|isbn=0559368712|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one dimension, acceleration is the [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] at which something speeds up or slows down. However, since velocity is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]], acceleration describes the rate of change of both the magnitude and the direction of velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Relativity and Common Sense|first=Hermann|last=Bondi|pages=3|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1980|isbn=0486240215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Physics the Easy Way|pages=27|first=Robert L.|last=Lehrman|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|year=1998|isbn=0764102362}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acceleration has the [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] [[length|L]]&amp;nbsp;[[time|T]]&lt;sup&gt; −2&lt;/sup&gt;.  In [[International System of Units|SI]] units, acceleration is measured in [[metre per second per second|meters per second squared
]] (m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  (The negative acceleration i.e. retardation, also have the same equation.)

[[Proper acceleration]], the acceleration of a body relative to a free-fall condition, is measured by an instrument called an [[accelerometer]].

In common speech, the term ''acceleration'' is used for an increase in speed (the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of velocity); a decrease in speed is called ''deceleration''. In physics, a change in the direction of velocity also is an acceleration: for  rotary motion, the change in direction of velocity results in ''centripetal (toward the center) acceleration''; whereas the rate of change of speed is a ''tangential acceleration''.

In [[classical mechanics]], for a body with constant mass, the acceleration of the body is proportional to the net [[force (physics)|force]] acting on it ([[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a} \quad \to \quad \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{F}/m&lt;/math&gt;
where '''F''' is the resultant force acting on the body, ''m'' is  the [[mass (physics)|mass]] of the body, and '''a''' is its acceleration.

==Average and instantaneous acceleration==
[[File:Acceleration.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. At any point on a trajectory, the magnitude of the acceleration is given by the rate of change of velocity in both magnitude and direction at that point. The true acceleration at time ''t'' is found in the limit as time interval ''Δt'' → 0.]]

[[File:Acceleration components.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Components of acceleration for a planar curved motion. The tangential component ''a&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' is due to the change in speed of traversal, and points along the curve in the direction of the velocity vector. The centripetal component ''a&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is due to the change in direction of the velocity vector and is normal to the trajectory, pointing toward the center of curvature of the path.]]

Average acceleration is the change in velocity (''Δ'''v''''') divided by the change in time (''Δt''). Instantaneous acceleration is the acceleration at a specific point in time which is for a very short interval of time as Δt approaches zero.

==Tangential and centripetal acceleration== &lt;!-- Linked from Lagrangian point#Intuitive explanation --&gt;
{{See also|Centripetal force#Local coordinates|l1=Local coordinates}}
The velocity of a particle moving on a curved path as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of time can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} (t) =v(t) \frac {\mathbf{v}(t)}{v(t)} = v(t) \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(t) , &lt;/math&gt;

with ''v''(''t'') equal to the speed of travel along the path, and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t} = \frac {\mathbf{v}(t)}{v(t)} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

a [[Differential_geometry_of_curves#Tangent_vector|unit vector tangent]] to the path pointing in the direction of motion at the chosen moment in time. Taking into account both the changing speed ''v(t)'' and the changing direction of '''u&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''', the acceleration of a particle moving on a curved path on a planar surface can be written using the [[chain rule]] of differentiation&lt;ref&gt;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChainRule.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the derivative of the product of two functions of time  as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{3}
\mathbf{a} &amp; = \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt} \\
           &amp; =  \frac{\mathrm{d}v }{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t} +v(t)\frac{d \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}}{dt} \\
           &amp; = \frac{\mathrm{d}v }{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}+ \frac{v^2}{R}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}\ , \\
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the  unit (inward) [[Differential_geometry_of_curves#Normal or curvature vector|normal vector]] to the particle's trajectory, and ''R'' is its instantaneous [[Curvature#One dimension in two dimensions: Curvature of plane curves|radius of curvature]] based upon the [[Osculating_circle#Mathematical_description|osculating circle]] at time ''t''. These components are called the '''[[tangential acceleration]]''' and the '''radial acceleration''' or '''centripetal acceleration''' (see also [[circular motion]] and [[centripetal force]]).

Extension of this approach to three-dimensional space curves that cannot be contained on a planar surface leads to the [[Frenet-Serret]] formulas.&lt;ref name = Andrews&gt;{{cite book |title = Mathematical Techniques for Engineers and Scientists |author = Larry C.

==Special cases==
===Uniform acceleration===

''Uniform'' or ''constant'' acceleration is a type of motion in which the [[velocity]] of an object changes by an equal amount in every equal time period. 

A frequently cited example of uniform acceleration is that of an object in [[free fall]] in a uniform gravitational field. The acceleration of a falling body in the absence of resistances to motion is dependent only on the [[gravitational field]] strength [[standard gravity|''g'']] (also called ''acceleration due to gravity''). By [[Newton's Second Law]] the [[force]], ''F'', acting on a body is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {F} = m  \mathbf {g}&lt;/math&gt;

Due to the simple algebraic properties of constant acceleration in the one-dimensional case (that is, the case of acceleration aligned with the initial velocity), there are simple formulae that relate the following quantities: [[displacement (vector)|displacement]], initial [[velocity]], final velocity, acceleration, and [[time]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {v}= \mathbf {u} + \mathbf {a} t &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {s}= \mathbf {u} t+ {{1} \over {2}} \mathbf {a}t^2 = {{(\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v})t} \over {2}} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; |\mathbf {v}|^2= |\mathbf {u}|^2 + 2 \, \mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {s} &lt;/math&gt;

where 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt; = displacement

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; = initial velocity

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; = final velocity

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; = uniform acceleration

:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; = time.

In the case of uniform acceleration of an object that is initially moving in a direction not aligned with the acceleration, the motion can be resolved into two orthogonal parts, one of constant velocity and the other according to the above equations.  As [[Galileo]] showed, the net result is parabolic motion, as in the trajectory of a cannonball, neglecting air resistance.&lt;ref&gt;

===Circular motion===

An example of a body experiencing acceleration of a uniform magnitude but changing direction is uniform [[circular motion]]. In this case, because the direction of the object's motion is constantly changing, being tangential to the circle, the object's [[velocity]] also changes, but its speed does not. This acceleration is directed toward the centre of the circle and takes the value:

:&lt;math&gt; a = {{v^2} \over {r}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' is the object's [[speed]]. Equivalently, the radial acceleration may be calculated from the object's [[angular velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, whence:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {a}= {-\omega^2}  \mathbf {r}. &lt;/math&gt;

The acceleration, hence also the force acting on a body in uniform circular motion, is directed ''toward'' the center of the circle; that is, it is [[centripetal force|centripetal]] – the so called '[[centrifugal force]]' appearing to act outward on a body is really a [[pseudo]] force experienced in the [[frame of reference]] of the body in circular motion, due to the body's [[linear momentum]] at a tangent to the circle.

==Relation to relativity==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
After completing his theory of [[special relativity]], [[Albert Einstein]] realized that forces felt by objects undergoing constant [[proper acceleration]] are actually feeling themselves being accelerated, so that, for example, a car's forward acceleration would result in the driver feeling a slight pressure between himself and his seat. In the case of [[gravity]], which Einstein concluded is not actually a force, this is not the case; acceleration due to gravity is not felt by an object in [[free-fall]]. The reason for this difference is that in the case of the car the force due to the engine is applied directly only to a certain part of the mass while the driver and the bulk of the car are passively dragged along. Gravity on the other hand accelerates the entire mass, with no internal forces acting. This was the basis for his development of [[general relativity]], a relativistic theory of gravity.

'''Conservation-restoration''', also referred to as '''conservation''', is a profession devoted to the preservation of [[cultural heritage]] for the future. Conservation activities include examination, documentation, treatment, and preventive care. All of this work is supported by research and education.

== Definition ==
The traditional definition of the role of the conservator involves the examination, conservation, and preservation of [[cultural heritage]] using &quot;any methods that prove effective in keeping that property in as close to its original condition as possible for as long as possible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Walston, S. 1978. p.9 The Preservation and Conservation of Aboriginal and Pacific Cultural Material in Australian Museums. ICCM Bulletin Vol 4 no. 1. December 1978. Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Materials (Inc).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, today the definition of the role of conservation has widened and would more accurately be described as that of ethical [[stewardship]]. 

The conservator applies some simple ethical guidelines, such as:
* Minimal intervention.
* Appropriate materials and methods that aim to be reversible to reduce possible problems with future treatment, investigation, and use.
* Full documentation of all work undertaken.

In order for the conservator to apply their professional expertise accordingly, they must take into account the views of the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]], the [[Values (heritage)|values]] and [[Preservation of meaning|meaning of the object]], and the physical needs of the material, in order to decide upon an appropriate conservation strategy.

== History ==
===Key dates===
{{main|List of dates in the history of art conservation}}

The tradition of conservation in Europe some consider to have begun in 1565 with the [[restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes]].

===Brief history===
The care for cultural patrimony has a long history within traditions of fixing and mending objects,&lt;ref&gt;Pye, E, 2001. Caring for the Past: Issues in Conservation for Archaeology and Museums. London: James and James&lt;/ref&gt; and in individual restorations of artworks. During the 19th century, the fields of science and art became increasingly intertwined as scientists such as Michael Faraday began to study the damaging effects of the environment to works of art. Louis Pasteur carried out scientific analysis on paint during this time period as well.&lt;ref&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill. 2005. p. 41.  “Changing Approaches in Art Conservation: 1925 to the present” in  (Sackler NAS Colloquium) Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques in Conservation and Analysis.  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11413&amp;page=41&lt;/ref&gt; However, perhaps the first organised attempt to conserve cultural patrimony was the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] in the [[UK]], influenced by the writings of [[John Ruskin]] the society was founded by [[William Morris]] and [[Philip Webb]] in 1877. During the same period a movement with similar aims had also developed in [[France]] under the direction of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]] a French architect and theorist, famous for his &quot;restorations&quot; of medieval buildings.

[[File:Bixi stele (wrapped), Harvard University, Cambridge, MA - IMG 4607.JPG|thumb|Since 1998, [[Harvard University]] wraps some of the valuable statues on its campus, such as this &quot;[[Harvard Bixi|Chinese stele]]&quot;, with waterproof covers every winter, in order to protect them from erosion caused by [[acid rain]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/03/art-under-wraps.html Art Under Wraps]&quot; , Harvard Magazine, March–April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Conservation, as a distinct field of study, initially developed in Germany, when in 1888 [[Friedrich Rathgen]] became the first [[chemist]] to be employed by a [[Museum]], the Koniglichen Museen, Berlin (Royal Museums of Berlin). He not only developed a scientific approach to the care of objects in the collections, but disseminated this approach publishing a &quot;Handbook of Conservation&quot; in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Gilberg, Mark. (1987) Friedrich Rathgen: The Father of Modern Archaeological Conservation. Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 26, No. 2 (Autumn, 1987), pp. 105-120 http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/jaic/articles/jaic26-02-004_2.html&lt;/ref&gt; The early development of conservation in any area of the world is usually linked to the creation of positions for chemists within museums. However in the United Kingdom, pioneering research into painting materials and conservation, ceramics, and stone conservation was conducted by Arthur Pillans Laurie, academic chemist and Principal of [[Heriot Watt University]] from 1900. Laurie's interests were fostered by [[William Holman Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahste.ac.uk/isaar/GB_0237_NAHSTE_P1161.html |title=Brief biography of Professor AP Laurie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 in the [[UK]] the chemist [[Harold Plenderleith]] began to work at the [[British Museum]] with Dr. Alexander Scott in the newly created Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, thus giving birth to the conservation profession in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/conservation_and_science/history.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This department had been created by the museum to address objects in the collection that had begun to rapidly deteriorate as a result of being stored in the [[London Underground]] tunnels during the [[First World War]]. The development of this department at the British Museum moved the focus for the development of conservation from Germany to Britain, and in 1956 Plenderleith wrote a significant handbook called The Conservation of Antiquities and Works of Art, it was this book rather than Rathgen's that is commonly seen as the major source for the development of conservation as we know it today. 

In the [[United States]], the development of conservation can be traced to the [[Fogg Art Museum]], and Edward Waldo Forbes, the Director of the Fogg from 1909 to 1944. He encouraged technical investigation, and was Chairman of the Advisory Committee for the first technical journal, Technical Studies, in the Field of the Fine Arts, published by the Fogg from 1932 to 1942. Importantly he also brought onto the museum staff chemists. [[Rutherford John Gettens]] was the first [[chemist]] in the U. S. to be permanently employed by an art museum. He worked with [[George L. Stout]], the founder and first editor of Technical Studies. Gettens and Stout co-authored Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopaedia, first published in 1942 and reprinted in 1966. This compendium is still cited regularly. Only a few dates and descriptions in Gettens' and Stout's book are now outdated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stoner, Joyce Hill 2003&quot;&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill. &quot;Changing Approaches in Art Conservation: 1925 to the present&quot;. The publication exists in two editions. The earlier one is &quot;Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques on Conservation and Analysis&quot; and was published by the National Academy of Sciences in 2003. The later edition of the publication is &quot;Arthur M. Sackler Colloquia: Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques in Conservation and Analysis&quot;. It was published by the National Academies Press in 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

George T. Oliver, of [[Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration|Oliver Brothers]]
(Est. 1850 in New York City) invented the vacuum hot table for relining paintings in 1920’s, he filed a patent for the table in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PALL&amp;s1=Oliver-George-T.INNM.&amp;OS=IN/Oliver-George-T&amp;RS=IN/Oliver-George-T U.S. Patent# 2,073,802 :''&quot;Art of Oil Painting Restoration&quot;''- March 16, 1937]&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's prototype table, which he designed and constructed, is still in operation.

The focus of conservation development then accelerated in Britain and America, and it was in Britain that the first International Conservation Organisations developed. [[International Institute for Conservation|The International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC)]] was incorporated under British law in 1950 as &quot;a permanent organization to co-ordinate and improve the knowledge, methods, and working standards needed to protect and preserve precious materials of all kinds.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stoner, Joyce Hill 2003&quot;/&gt; The rapid growth of conservation professional organizations, publications, journals, newsletters, both internationally and in localities, has spearheaded the development of the conservation profession, both practically and theoretically. Art historians and theorists such as [[Cesare Brandi]] have also played a significant role in developing conservation-restoration theory. In recent years ethical concerns have been at the forefront of developments in conservation. Most significantly has been the idea of [[Art conservation#Preventive conservation|Preventive conservation]]. This concept is based in part on the pioneering work by [[Garry Thomson]] [[CBE]], and his book the Museum Environment, first published in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Museum Environment (2nd Edition), 1986, by Garry Thomson CBE ISBN 978-0-7506-2041-3&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson was associated with the [[National Gallery (London)]], it was here that he established a set of guidelines or environmental controls for the best conditions in which objects could be stored and displayed within the Museum Environment. Although his exact guidelines are no longer rigidly followed they did inspire this field of conservation.

== Ethics ==
The conservator's work is guided by ethical standards. These take the form of [[applied ethics]]. Ethical standards have been established across the world, and national and international ethical guidelines have been written. One such example is:

* [[American Institute for Conservation]] Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice [http://www.conservation-us.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=858]

Conservation OnLine's [http://cool.conservation-us.org/bytopic/ethics/ Ethical issues in conservation] provides a number of articles on ethical issues in conservation; example of codes of ethics and guidelines for professional conduct in conservation and allied fields; and charters and treaties pertaining to ethical issues involving the preservation of cultural property.

== Specialization within the profession ==
[[File:Krnov castle b.jpg|thumb|Castle gate of [[Krnov]] before restoration (2001)]]
[[File:Krnov castle - entrance.jpg|thumb|Castle gate of Krnov after restoration (2009)]]

* [[Book and paper conservation]]
* [[Conservation science]]
* [[Electronic media conservation]]
** [[Digital preservation]]
** [[Film preservation]]
** [[Media preservation]]
** [[Gramophone record#Preservation|Phonograph record preservation]]

== Caring for cultural heritage ==
===Preventive conservation===
Many cultural works are sensitive to environmental conditions such as [[temperature]], [[humidity]] and exposure to [[light]] and [[ultraviolet]] light. They must be protected in a controlled environment where such variables are maintained within a range of damage-limiting levels. Shielding from sunlight of artifacts such as [[watercolour painting]]s for example is usually necessary to prevent fading of [[pigments]].

Preventive conservation is an important element of museum policy and collections care. It is an essential responsibility of members of the museum profession to create and maintain a protective environment for the collections in their care, whether in store, on display, or in transit. A museum should carefully monitor the condition of collections to determine when an artifact requires conservation work and the services of a qualified conservator.

[[Image:Preventive Conservation - Serra da Capivara.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Work of preventive conservation in a rock wall with prehistoric paintings at the [[Serra da Capivara National Park]]. The work consists of filling the cracks to prevent the fragmentation of the wall.]]

===Interventive conservation===
Interventive Conservation refers to any act by a conservator that involves a direct interaction between the conservator and the cultural material. These interventive treatments could involve cleaning, stabilizing, repair, or even replacement of parts of the original object. It is essential that the conservator should fully justify any such work. Complete documentation of the work; carried out before, during, and after the treatment rules out chances of later doubts.

The principal goal of a conservator is to nullify or at least reduce the rate of deterioration of an object, this can be achieved through either non-interventive or interventive methodologies. Interventive methodologies include all those actions taken by the conservator to directly intervene with the material fabric of the object. Such actions include surface cleaning such as varnish removal, or consolidation such as securing flaking paint. Such interventive actions are carried out for a variety of reasons including; aesthetic choices, Stabilization needs for structural integrity, or for cultural requirements for intangible continuity.    

One of the guiding principles of conservation has traditionally been the idea of reversibility, that is that all interventions with the object should be fully reversible, and the object should be able to be returned to the state in which it was prior to the conservators intervention. Although this concept remains a guiding principle of the profession, it is a concept that has been widely critiqued within the conservation profession &lt;ref&gt;Andrew Oddy and Sara Carroll (eds). 1999. Reversibility - Does it Exist? British Museum Occasional Paper Number 135. London: British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now considered by many to be &quot;a fuzzy concept&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;p. 185. Muñoz-Viñas, Salvador. 2005. Contemporary Theory of Conservation. London: Elsevier/Butterworth Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important principle of conservation is that all alterations should be well documented and should be clearly distinguishable from the original object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icom-cc.icom.museum/Start/ ICOM-CC] International Council of Museums Committee for Conservation]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a highly publicized interventive conservation effort would be the conservation work conducted on the [[restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes|Sistine Chapel]].

== The conservation laboratory ==
[[Image:The Lunder Conservation Center Laboratory.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Lunder Conservation Center. Conservation staff for both the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] and the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] are visible to the public through floor-to-ceiling glass walls that allow visitors to see firsthand all the techniques that [[Conservator (museum)|Conservators]] use to examine, treat and preserve artworks within a functioning conservation Laboratory.]]
Conservators routinely use chemical and scientific analysis for the examination and treatment of cultural works. The modern conservation lab uses equipment such as [[microscope]]s, [[spectrometer]]s, and [[x-ray]] machines to better understand objects and their components. The data thus collected helps in deciding the conservation treatments to be provided to the object.

==Country by country look==
===United States===
Heritage Preservation, in partnership with the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]], a U.S. federal agency, produced The Heritage Health Index. The results of this work was the report [http://www.heritagepreservation.org/HHI/summary.html A Public Trust at Risk: The Heritage Health Index Report on the State of America's Collections], which was published in December 2005 and concluded that immediate action is needed to prevent the loss of 190 million artifacts that are in need of conservation treatment. The report made four recommendations:
* Institutions must give priority to providing safe conditions for the collections they hold in trust.
* Every collecting institution must develop an emergency plan to protect its collections and train staff to carry it out.
* Every institution must assign responsibility for caring for collections to members of its staff.
* Individuals at all levels of government and in the private sector must assume responsibility for providing the support that will allow these collections to survive&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagepreservation.org/HHI/ Heritage Health Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In October 2006, the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], a governmental department, authored a document: &quot;Understanding the Future: Priorities for England's Museums&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/consultations/cons_uf_prioritiesforenglandsmuseums.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This document was based on several years of consultation aimed to lay out the government's priorities for museums in the 21st century. 

The document listed the following as priorities for the next decade:

# Museums will fulfil their potential as learning resources (pp 7–10).
#* Museums will be embedded into the delivery of education in every school in the country.
#* Understanding of the effectiveness of museum education will be improved further and best practice built into education programmes.
#* The value of museums' collections as a research resource will be well understood and better links built between the academic community and museums.
# Museums will embrace their role in fostering, exploring, celebrating and questioning the identities of diverse communities (pp 11–14).
#* The sector needs to work with partners in academia and beyond to create an intellectual framework supporting museums' capacity to tackle issues of identity.
#* The museum sector must continue to develop improved practical techniques for engaging communities of all sorts.
# Museums' collections will be more dynamic and better used (pp 15–18).
#* Government and the sector will find new ways to encourage museums to collect actively and strategically, especially the record of contemporary society.
#* The sector will develop new collaborative approaches to sharing and developing collections and related expertise.
# Museums' workforces will be dynamic, highly skilled and representative (pp 17–22).
#* Museums' governing bodies and workforces will be representative of the communities they serve.
#* Find more varied ways for a broader range of skills to come into museums.
#* Improve continuing professional development.
# Museums will work more closely with each other and partners outside the sector (pp 23–26).
#* A consistent evidence base of the contribution of all kinds of museums to the full range of public service agendas will be developed.
#* There will be deeper and longer lasting partnerships between the national museums and a broader range of regional partners.
#* Museums' international roles will be strengthened to improve museum programmes in this country and Britain's image, reputation and relationships abroad.

The conservation profession response to this report was on the whole less than favourable, the [[Institute of Conservation]] (ICON) published their response under the title &quot;A Failure of Vision&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icon.org.uk/images/stories/icon_understanding_the_future.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It had the following to say:

{{quote| &quot;No sector can look with confidence to the future if its key asset is worked harder and harder across an ever broadening range of objectives while the inputs required to sustain it are neglected.&quot; }} 

{{quote|&quot;It is of major concern to us that the only part of this section which makes any acknowledgement of the need for greater resourcing is the part which refers to acquisitions.  The original consultation paper made quite extensive reference to the importance of collections, the role of new technologies, and cultural property issues, but this appears to have been whittled away in the present document.&quot; }}

Concluding: {{quote| &quot;When asked by the Commons Culture Media and Sport elect Committee CMS committee what he would like to see as a priority in the DCMS document arising from the 'Understanding the Future' consultation, Mr MacGregor responded 'I would like to see added there the need to conserve and research the collections, so that the collections can really play the role across the whole of the United Kingdom that they should.'  
So would we.&quot;}} 
 
Further to this the ICON website summary report&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icon.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=400&amp;Itemid=15&lt;/ref&gt; lists the following specific recommendations:

* A national survey to find out what the public want from museums, what motivates them to visit them and what makes for a rewarding visit.
* A review of survey results and prioritisation of the various intrinsic, instrumental and institutional values to provide a clear basis for a 10-year strategy
* HR consultants to be brought in from the commercial sector to review recruitment, career development and working practices in the national and regional museums.
* A commitment to examine the potential for using Museum Accreditation as a more effective driver for improving recruitment, diversity, and career development across the sector.
* DCMS to take full account of the eventual findings of the current Commons Select Committee enquiry into Care of Collections in the final version of this document
* The adoption of those recommendations of the recent House of Lords enquiry into [[Heritage Science#Development of ‘Heritage Science’|Science and Heritage]] which have a potential impact on the future of museums.

In November 2008, the UK based [[think tank]] [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] published an influential pamphlet entitled 'It's a material world: caring for the public realm',&lt;ref&gt;
Holden, John. and Samuel Jones. 2008. It's A Material World: Caring for the public realm. London: Demos. http://demos.co.uk/files/Material%20World%20-%20web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in which they argue for integrating the public directly into efforts to conserve material culture, particularly that which is in the public, their argument, as stated on page 16, demonstrates their belief that society can benefit from conservation as a paradigm as well as a profession: 

{{quote|&quot;conservators provide a paradigm not just for fixing things when they are broken, but for a wider social ethos of care, where we individually and collectively take responsibility and action&quot;}}

==Training==
{{main|Art conservation training}}
Training in conservation for many years took the form of an [[apprenticeship]], whereby an apprentice slowly developed the necessary skills to undertake their job. For some specializations within conservation this is still the case. However, it is more common in the field of conservation today that the training required to become a practicing conservator comes from a recognized university course in conservation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/training AIC - Becoming a Conservator&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The University can rarely provide all the necessary training in first hand experience that an apprenticeship can, and therefore in addition to graduate level training the profession also tends towards encouraging conservation students to spend time as an [[intern]].   

Conservation is an [[Interdisciplinary]] field as conservators have backgrounds in the [[fine arts]], sciences (including [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[materials science]]), and closely related disciplines, such as [[art history]], [[archaeology]], [[studio art]], and [[anthropology]]. They also have design, fabrication, artistic, and other special skills necessary for the practical application of that knowledge. 

Within the various schools that teach conservation, the approach differs according to the educational and vocational system within the country, and the focus of the school itself. This is acknowledged by the [[American Institute for Conservation]] who advise &quot;Specific admission requirements differ and potential candidates are encouraged to contact the programs directly for details on prerequisites, application procedures, and program curriculum&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/training AIC - Becoming a Conservator&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associations and professional organizations==
{{main|Conservation associations and professional organizations}}
Societies devoted to the care of cultural heritage have been in existence around the world for many years. One early example is the founding in 1877 of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] in Britain to protect the built heritage, this society continues to be active today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spab.org.uk/html/what-is-spab/history-of-the-spab/ SPAB: History of the SPAB&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The built heritage was also at the forefront of the growth of member based organizations in the [[United States]] for example, founded in 1889, the Richmond, Virginia-based [[Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities]] was the United States' first statewide historic preservation group. In 2003, it changed its name to reflect its wider focus in statewide preservation issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apva.org/ APVA Preservation Virginia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Today, professional conservators join and take part in the activities of numerous conservation associations and professional organizations with the wider conservation field, and within their area of specialization. 

These organizations exist to &quot;support the conservation professionals who preserve our cultural heritage&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/about About AIC - Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; 

This involves upholding professional standards, promoting research and publications, providing educational opportunities, and fostering the exchange of knowledge among conservators, allied professionals, and the public.

'''Anton Pavlovich Chekhov''' ({{lang-ru|Антон Павлович Чехов}}, {{IPA-ru|ɐnˈton ˈpavləvʲɪtɕ ˈtɕexəf|pron}}; 29 January 1860&lt;ref&gt;[[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style date]] 17 January.&lt;/ref&gt; – 15 July 1904)&lt;ref&gt;[[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style date]] 2 July.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Russia]]n short-story writer, playwright and physician, considered to be one of the greatest short-story writers in the history of world literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-29160/Russian-literature|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|title=Russian literature; Anton Chekhov|accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His career as a dramatist produced four classics and his best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Greatest short story writer who ever lived.&quot; [[Raymond Carver]] (in Rosamund Bartlett's introduction to ''About Love and Other Stories'', XX); &quot;Quite probably. the best short-story writer ever.&quot; [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,6000,1261403,00.html ''A Chekhov Lexicon''], by [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 July 2004.

Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chekhov practiced &lt;!--article is in British English--&gt; as a doctor throughout most of his literary career: &quot;Medicine is my lawful wife&quot;, he once said, &quot;and literature is my mistress.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Alexei Suvorin, 11 September 1888. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chekhov renounced the theatre after the disastrous reception of ''[[The Seagull]]'' in 1896; but the play was revived to acclaim in 1898 by [[Constantin Stanislavski]]'s [[Moscow Art Theatre]], which subsequently also produced ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' and premiered Chekhov's last two plays, ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' and ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]''. These four works present a challenge to the acting ensemble&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Actors climb up Chekhov like a mountain, roped together, sharing the glory if they ever make it to the summit&quot;. Actor [[Ian McKellen]], quoted in Miles, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to audiences, because in place of conventional action Chekhov offers a &quot;theatre of mood&quot; and a &quot;submerged life in the text.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chekhov's art demands a theatre of mood.&quot; [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]], quoted in Allen, 13; &quot;A richer submerged life in the text is characteristic of a more profound drama of realism, one which depends less on the externals of presentation.&quot; Styan, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chekhov had at first written stories only for financial gain, but as his artistic ambition grew, he made formal innovations which have influenced the evolution of the modern short story.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chekhov is said to be the father of the modern short story&quot;.

Anton Chekhov was born on 29 January 1860, the third of six surviving children, in [[Taganrog, Russia|Taganrog]], a port on the [[Sea of Azov]] in southern [[Russian Empire|Russia]] where his father, Pavel Yegorovich Chekhov, the son of a former [[serfdom|serf]], ran a grocery store. A director of the parish choir, devout [[Orthodox Christian]], and physically abusive father, Pavel Chekhov has been seen by some historians as the model for his son's many portraits of hypocrisy.&lt;ref name = &quot;Wood 78&quot;&gt;Wood, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Chekhov's mother, Yevgeniya, was an excellent storyteller who entertained the children with tales of her travels with her cloth-merchant father all over Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, XVII.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Simmons 18&quot;&gt;Simmons, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Our talents we got from our father,&quot; Chekhov remembered, &quot;but our soul from our mother.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bio&quot;&gt;From the biographical sketch, adapted from a memoir by Chekhov's brother Mihail, which prefaces [[Constance Garnett]]'s translation of Chekhov's letters, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;
In adulthood, Chekhov criticised his brother [[Alexander Chekhov|Alexander's]] treatment of his wife and children by reminding him of Pavel's tyranny:
{{bquote|Let me ask you to recall that it was despotism and lying that ruined your mother's youth. Despotism and lying so mutilated our childhood that it's sickening and frightening to think about it. Remember the horror and disgust we felt in those times when Father threw a tantrum at dinner over too much salt in the soup and called Mother a fool.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to brother Alexander, 2 January 1889, in Malcolm, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Suvoring 1894&quot;&gt;Another insight into Chekhov's childhood came in a letter to his publisher and friend Alexei Suvorin: &quot;From my childhood I have believed in progress, and I could not help believing in it since the difference between the time when I used to be thrashed and when they gave up thrashing me was tremendous.&quot; Letter to Suvorin, 27 March 1894. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chekhov attended a [[Greek Church and Greek School in Taganrog|school for Greek boys]], followed by the Taganrog [[Gymnasium (school)|''gymnasium'']], now renamed the [[Chekhov Gymnasium]], where he was kept down for a year at fifteen for failing a Greek exam.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bartlett 4-5&quot;&gt;Bartlett, 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; He sang at the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] monastery in Taganrog and in his father's choirs. In a letter of 1892, he used the word &quot;suffering&quot; to describe his childhood and recalled:

{{bquote|When my brothers and I used to stand in the middle of the church and sing the trio &quot;May my prayer be exalted&quot;, or &quot;The Archangel's Voice&quot;, everyone looked at us with emotion and envied our parents, but we at that moment felt like little convicts.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;&gt;Letter to I.L. Shcheglov, 9 March 1892. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1876, Chekhov's father was declared bankrupt after over-extending his finances building a new house,&lt;ref&gt;He had been cheated by a contractor called Mironov. Rayfield, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and to avoid the [[debtor's prison]] fled to Moscow, where his two eldest sons, Alexander and Nikolai, were attending university. The family lived in poverty in Moscow, Chekhov's mother physically and emotionally broken.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to cousin Mihail, 10 May 1877. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Chekhov was left behind to sell the family possessions and finish his education.

Chekhov remained in Taganrog for three more years, boarding with a man called Selivanov who, like Lopakhin in ''The Cherry Orchard'', had bailed out the family for the price of their house.&lt;ref name = &quot;Malcolm 25&quot;&gt;Malcolm, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Chekhov had to pay for his own education, which he managed by—among other jobs—private tutoring, catching and selling [[European Goldfinch|goldfinches]], and selling short sketches to the newspapers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne XX&quot;&gt;Payne, XX.&lt;/ref&gt; He sent every [[ruble]] he could spare to Moscow, along with humorous letters to cheer up the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne XX&quot; /&gt; During this time, he read widely and analytically, including [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]], [[Ivan Goncharov|Goncharov]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]];&lt;ref name = &quot;Mihail 1876&quot;&gt;Letter to brother Mihail, 1 July 1876. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Simmons 26&quot;&gt;Simmons, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; and he wrote a full-length comedy drama, ''Fatherless'', which his brother Alexander dismissed as &quot;an inexcusable though innocent fabrication.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Chekhov also enjoyed a series of love affairs, one with the wife of a teacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne XX&quot; /&gt;

In 1879, Chekhov completed his schooling and joined his family in Moscow, having gained admission to the medical school at [[Moscow State University|Moscow University]].&lt;ref&gt;Rayfield, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early writings===
Chekhov now assumed responsibility for the whole family.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; To support them and to pay his tuition fees, he wrote daily short, humorous sketches and vignettes of contemporary Russian life, many under pseudonyms such as &quot;Antosha Chekhonte&quot; (Антоша Чехонте) and &quot;Man without a Spleen&quot; (Человек без селезенки). His prodigious output gradually earned him a reputation as a [[satire|satirical]] chronicler of Russian street life, and by 1882 he was writing for ''Oskolki'' (''Fragments''), owned by Nikolai Leikin, one of the leading publishers of the time.&lt;ref name = &quot;Rayfield 91&quot;&gt;Rayfield, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Chekhov's tone at this stage was harsher than that familiar from his mature fiction.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;There is in these miniatures an arresting potion of cruelty… The wonderfully compassionate Chekhov was yet to mature.&quot; [http://books.guardian.co.uk/critics/reviews/0,,489891,00.html ''Vodka miniatures, belching and angry cats''], [[George Steiner]]'s review of ''The Undiscovered Chekhov'' in ''The Observer'', 13 May 2001. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, Chekhov qualified as a physician, which he considered his principal profession though he made little money from it and treated the poor for free.&lt;ref name = &quot;Malcolm 26&quot;&gt;Malcolm, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884 and 1885, Chekhov found himself coughing blood, and in 1886 the attacks worsened; but he would not admit [[tuberculosis]] to his family and friends,&lt;ref name = &quot;Bio&quot;/&gt; confessing to Leikin, &quot;I am afraid to submit myself to be sounded by my colleagues.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter to N.A .Leikin, 6 April 1886. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt; He continued writing for weekly periodicals, earning enough money to move the family into progressively better accommodation. Early in 1886 he was invited to write for one of the most popular papers in [[St. Petersburg]], ''[[Novoye Vremya (newspaper)|Novoye Vremya]]'' (''New Times''), owned and edited by the millionaire magnate [[Alexey Suvorin]], who paid per line a rate double Leikin's and allowed him three times the space.&lt;ref name = &quot;Rayfield 128&quot;&gt;Rayfield, 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Suvorin was to become a lifelong friend, perhaps Chekhov's closest.&lt;ref&gt;They only ever fell out once, when Chekhov objected to the [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] attacks in ''New Times'' against [[Alfred Dreyfus|Dreyfus]] and [[Emile Zola|Zola]] in 1898. Rayfield, 448–50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Wood 79&quot;&gt;In many ways, the right-wing Suvorin, whom [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] later called &quot;The running dog of the [[Tsar|Tzar]]&quot; (Payne, XXXV), was Chekhov's opposite; &quot;Chekhov had to function like Suvorin's kidney, extracting the businessman's poisons.&quot; Wood, 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before long, Chekhov was attracting literary as well as popular attention. The sixty-four-year-old [[Dmitry Grigorovich]], a celebrated Russian writer of the day, wrote to Chekhov after reading his short story ''The Huntsman'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1944 ''The Huntsman''.]. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;You have ''real'' talent—a talent which places you in the front rank among writers in the new generation.&quot; He went on to advise Chekhov to slow down, write less, and concentrate on literary quality.

Chekhov replied that the letter had struck him &quot;like a thunderbolt&quot; and confessed, &quot;I have written my stories the way reporters write up their notes about fires—mechanically, half-consciously, caring nothing about either the reader or myself.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Malcolm 32-3&quot;&gt;Malcolm, 32–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The admission may have done Chekhov a disservice, since early manuscripts reveal that he often wrote with extreme care, continually revising.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne XXIV&quot;&gt;Payne, XXIV.&lt;/ref&gt; Grigorovich's advice nevertheless inspired a more serious, artistic ambition in the twenty-six-year-old. In 1887, with a little string-pulling by Grigorovich, the short story collection ''At Dusk'' (''V Sumerkakh'') won Chekhov the coveted [[Pushkin Prize]] &quot;for the best literary production distinguished by high artistic worth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turning points===
That year, exhausted from overwork and ill health, Chekhov took a trip to [[Ukraine]] which reawakened him to the beauty of the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe|steppe]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Masha 1887&quot;&gt;&quot;There is a scent of the steppe and one hears the birds sing. I see my old friends the ravens flying over the steppe.&quot; Letter to sister Masha, 2 April 1887. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt; On his return, he began the novella-length short story ''[[s:The Steppe|The Steppe]]'', &quot;something rather odd and much too original,&quot; eventually published in ''Severny Vestnik'' (''The Northern Herald'').&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Grigorovich, 12 January 1888. Quoted by Malcolm, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; In a narrative which drifts with the thought processes of the characters, Chekhov evokes a [[chaise]] journey across the steppe through the eyes of a young boy sent to live away from home, his companions a priest and a merchant. ''The Steppe'', which has been called a &quot;dictionary of Chekhov's poetics&quot;, represented a significant advance for Chekhov, exhibiting much of the quality of his mature fiction and winning him publication in a literary journal rather than a newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''The Steppe'', as Michael Finke suggests, is 'a sort of dictionary of Chekhov's poetics,' a kind of sample case of the concealed literary weapons Chekhov would deploy in his work to come.&quot; Malcolm, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn 1887, a theater manager named Korsh commissioned Chekhov to write a play, the result being ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'', written in a fortnight and produced that November.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bio&quot;&gt;From the biographical sketch, adapted from a memoir by Chekhov's brother Mikhail, which prefaces [[Constance Garnett]]'s translation of Chekhov's letters, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Chekhov found the experience &quot;sickening&quot;, and painted a comic portrait of the chaotic production in a letter to his brother Alexander, the play was a hit and was praised, to Chekhov's bemusement, as a work of originality.&lt;ref name = &quot;Alexander 1887&quot;&gt;Letter to brother Alexander, 20 November 1887. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Mikhail Chekhov considered ''Ivanov'' a key moment in his brother's intellectual development and literary career.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bio&quot;/&gt; From this period comes an observation of Chekhov's which has become known as &quot;[[Chekhov's gun]]&quot;, noted by Ilia Gurliand from a conversation: &quot;If in Act I you have a pistol hanging on the wall, then it must fire in the last act.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rayfield, 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Simmons 190&quot;&gt;Simmons, 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of Chekhov's brother Nikolai from tuberculosis in 1889 influenced ''A Dreary Story'', finished that September, about a man who confronts the end of a life which he realizes has been without purpose.&lt;ref name = &quot;Dreary&quot;&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1883 ''A Dreary Story''.]. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Simmons 186-91&quot;&gt;Simmons, 186–91.&lt;/ref&gt; Mikhail Chekhov, who recorded his brother's depression and restlessness after Nikolai's death, was researching prisons at the time as part of his law studies, and Anton Chekhov, in a search for purpose in his own life, himself soon became obsessed with the issue of prison reform.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bio&quot;/&gt;

===Sakhalin===
[[File:AChekhov89.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Chekhov, 1889, aged 29]]

In 1890, Chekhov undertook an arduous journey by train, horse-drawn carriage, and river steamer to the far east of Russia and the [[katorga]], or penal colony, on [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]], north of Japan, where he spent three months interviewing thousands of convicts and settlers for a census. The letters Chekhov wrote during the two-and-a-half month journey to Sakhalin are considered to be among his best.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; His remarks to his sister about [[Tomsk]] were to become notorious.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, 223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Rayfield 224&quot;&gt;Rayfield, 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|&quot;Tomsk is a very dull town. To judge from the drunkards whose acquaintance I have made, and from the intellectual people who have come to the hotel to pay their respects to me, the inhabitants are very dull, too.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Masha 1890&quot;&gt;Letter to sister, Masha, 20 May 1890. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The inhabitants of Tomsk later retaliated by erecting a mocking statue of Chekhov.

What Chekhov witnessed on Sakhalin shocked and angered him, including floggings, embezzlement of supplies, and [[sexual slavery|forced prostitution]] of women, he wrote,  &quot;There were times I felt that I saw before me the extreme limits of man's degradation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Rayfield 230&quot;&gt;Rayfield 230.&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly moved by the plight of the children living in the penal colony with their parents. For example:

{{quote|&quot;On the [[Amur River|Amur]] steamer going to Sakhalin, there was a convict who had murdered his wife and wore fetters on his legs. His daughter, a little girl of six, was with him. I noticed wherever the convict moved the little girl scrambled after him, holding on to his fetters. At night the child slept with the convicts and soldiers all in a heap together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter to A.F.Koni, 16 January 1891. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chekhov later concluded that charity and subscription were not the answer, but that the government had a duty to finance humane treatment of the convicts. His findings were published in 1893 and 1894 as ''Ostrov Sakhalin'' (''The Island of Sakhalin''), a work of social science – not literature – worthy and informative rather than brilliant.&lt;ref name = &quot;Malcolm 125&quot;&gt;Malcolm, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Simmons 229&quot;&gt;Such is the general critical view of the work, but Simmons calls it a &quot;valuable and intensely human document.&quot; Simmons, 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Chekhov found literary expression for the &quot;Hell of Sakhalin&quot; in his long short story ''[[s:The Murder|The Murder]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13419 ''The Murder''.]. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the last section of which is set on Sakhalin, where the murderer Yakov loads coal in the night, longing for home.

===Melikhovo===
In 1892, Chekhov bought the small country estate of Melikhovo, about forty miles south of Moscow, where he lived until 1899 with his family. &quot;It's nice to be a lord,&quot; he joked to his friend Ivan Leontyev (who wrote humorous pieces under the pseudonym Shcheglov),&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;/&gt; but he took his responsibilities as a landlord seriously and soon made himself useful to the local peasants. As well as organising relief for victims of the [[famine]] and [[cholera]] outbreaks of 1892, he went on to build three schools, a fire station, and a clinic, and to donate his medical services to peasants for miles around, despite frequent recurrences of his tuberculosis.&lt;ref name = &quot;Wood 78&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Malcolm 26&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Payne XXXI&quot;&gt;Payne, XXXI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mikhail Chekhov, a member of the household at Melikhovo, described the extent of his brother's medical commitments:

{{quote|From the first day that Chekhov moved to Melikhovo, the sick began flocking to him from twenty miles around. They came on foot or were brought in carts, and often he was fetched to patients at a distance. Sometimes from early in the morning peasant women and children were standing before his door waiting.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bio&quot;&gt;From the biographical sketch, adapted from a memoir by Chekhov's brother Mikhail, which prefaces Constance Garnett's translation of Chekhov's letters, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chekhov's expenditure on drugs was considerable, but the greatest cost was making journeys of several hours to visit the sick, which reduced his time for writing.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bio&quot;&gt;From the biographical sketch, adapted from a memoir by Chekhov's brother Mihail, which prefaces Constance Garnett's translation of Chekhov's letters, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; Chekhov's work as a doctor, however, enriched his writing by bringing him into intimate contact with all sections of Russian society: for example, he witnessed at first hand the peasants' unhealthy and cramped living conditions, which he recalled in his short story ''Peasants''. Chekhov visited the upper classes as well, recording in his notebook: &quot;Aristocrats? The same ugly bodies and physical uncleanliness, the same toothless old age and disgusting death, as with market-women.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;note&quot;&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/12494 ''Note-Book''.]. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chekhov began writing his play ''The Seagull'' in 1894, in a lodge he had built in the orchard at Melikhovo. In the two years since moving to the estate, he had refurbished the house, taken up agriculture and horticulture, tended orchard and pond, and planted many trees, which, according to Mikhail, he &quot;looked after… as though they were his children. Like Colonel Vershinin in his ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'', as he looked at them he dreamed of what they would be like in three or four hundred years.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bio&quot;/&gt;

The first night of ''The Seagull'' on 17 October 1896 at the [[Alexandrinsky Theatre]] in &lt;!--Saint?--&gt;Petersburg was a fiasco, booed by the audience, and the play's reception stung Chekhov into renouncing the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Rayfield, 394–8.&lt;/ref&gt; But the play so impressed the theatre director [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]] that he convinced his colleague [[Constantin Stanislavski]] to direct it for the innovative [[Moscow Art Theatre]] in 1898.&lt;ref name = &quot;Ben&quot;&gt;Benedetti, ''Stanislavski: An Introduction'', 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanislavski's attention to psychological realism and ensemble playing coaxed the buried subtleties from the text and restored Chekhov's interest in playwriting.&lt;ref&gt;Chekhov and the Art Theatre, in Stanislavski's words, were united in a common desire &quot;to achieve artistic simplicity and truth on the stage.&quot; Allen, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Art Theatre commissioned more plays from Chekhov and the following year staged ''Uncle Vanya'', which Chekhov had completed in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Rayfield, 390–1. Rayfield draws from his critical study ''Chekhov's &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; and the &quot;Wood Demon&quot;'' (1995), which anatomised the evolution of the ''Wood Demon'' into ''Uncle Vanya''—&quot;one of Chekhov's most furtive achievements.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yalta===
In March 1897 Chekhov suffered a major hemorrhage of the lungs while on a visit to Moscow and, with great difficulty, was persuaded to enter a clinic, where the doctors diagnosed tuberculosis on the upper part of his lungs and ordered a change in his manner of life.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Suvorin, 1 April 1897. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After his father's death in 1898, Chekhov bought a plot of land on the outskirts of [[Yalta]] and built a [[White Dacha|villa]] there, into which he moved with his mother and sister the following year. Though he planted trees and flowers in Yalta, kept dogs and tame cranes, and received guests such as [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Maxim Gorky]], Chekhov was always relieved to leave his &quot;hot [[Siberia]]&quot; for Moscow or travels abroad. He vowed to move to Taganrog as soon as a water supply was installed there.&lt;ref&gt;Olga Knipper, ''Memoir'', in Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress'', 37, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bartlett 2&quot;&gt;Bartlett, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In Yalta he completed two more plays for the Art Theatre, composing with greater difficulty than in the days when he &quot;wrote serenely, the way I eat pancakes now&quot;; he took a year each over ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' and ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, 170–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 May 1901 Chekhov married [[Olga Knipper]]—quietly, owing to his horror of weddings—a former protegée and sometime lover of Nemirovich-Danchenko whom he had first met at rehearsals for ''The Seagull''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I have a horror of weddings, the congratulations and the champagne, standing around, glass in hand with an endless grin on your face.&quot; Letter to Olga Knipper, 19 April 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Benedetti 125&quot;&gt;Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress'', 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Rayfield 500&quot;&gt;&quot;Olga's relations with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko were more than professional.&quot; Rayfield, 500.&lt;/ref&gt; Up to that point, Chekhov, called &quot;Russia's most elusive literary bachelor&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Pitcher in ''Chekhov's Leading Lady'', quoted in Malcolm, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; had preferred passing liaisons and visits to brothels over commitment;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chekhov had the temperament of a philanderer. Sexually, he preferred brothels or swift liaisons.&quot; Wood, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; he had once written to Suvorin:

{{quote|By all means I will be married if you wish it. But on these conditions: everything must be as it has been hitherto—that is, she must live in Moscow while I live in the country, and I will come and see her ... give me a wife who, like the moon, won't appear in my sky every day.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Suvorin, 23 March 1895.

The letter proved prophetic of Chekhov's marital arrangements with Olga: he lived largely at Yalta, she in Moscow, pursuing her acting career. In 1902, Olga suffered a miscarriage; and [[Donald Rayfield]] has offered evidence, based on the couple's letters, that conception may have occurred when Chekhov and Olga were apart, although Russian scholars have conclusively refuted that claim.&lt;ref&gt;Rayfield also tentatively suggests, drawing on obstetric clues, that Olga suffered an [[ectopic pregnancy]] rather than a miscarriage. Rayfield, 556–57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Simmons Benedetti&quot;&gt;There was certainly tension between the couple after the miscarriage, though Simmons, 569, and Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress'', 241, put this down to Chekhov's mother and sister blaming the miscarriage on Olga's late-night lifestyle of socialising with her actor friends.&lt;/ref&gt; The literary legacy of this long-distance marriage is a correspondence which preserves gems of theatre history, including shared complaints about Stanislavski's directing methods and Chekhov's advice to Olga about performing in his plays.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress: The Love Letters of Olga Knipper and Anton Chekhov''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Yalta, Chekhov wrote one of his most famous stories, ''[[The Lady with the Dog (short story)|The Lady with the Dog]]'' (also called ''Lady with Lapdog''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13415 ''The Lady with the Dog''.]. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which depicts what at first seems a casual liaison between a married man and a married woman in Yalta. Neither expects anything lasting from the encounter, but they find themselves drawn back to each other, risking the security of their family lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yaltachekhov.org/ |title=Yalta Chekhov Campaign |publisher=Yaltachekhov.org |date=13 November 2008 |accessdate=3 March 2009}}{{Verify source|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
By May 1904, Chekhov was terminally ill with [[tuberculosis]]. Mikhail Chekhov recalled that &quot;everyone who saw him secretly thought the end was not far off, but the nearer [he] was to the end, the less he seemed to realise it.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bio&quot;/&gt; On 3 June he set off with Olga for the German spa town of [[Badenweiler]] in the [[Black Forest]], from where he wrote outwardly jovial letters to his sister Masha describing the food and surroundings and assuring her and his mother that he was getting better. In his last letter, he complained about the way the German women dressed.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to sister Masha, 28 June 1904. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6408 ''Letters of Anton Chekhov''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chekhov's death has become one of &quot;the great set pieces of literary history&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; retold, embroidered, and fictionalised many times since, notably in the short story ''Errand'' by [[Raymond Carver]]. In 1908, Olga wrote this account of her husband's last moments:

{{quote|Anton sat up unusually straight and said loudly and clearly (although he knew almost no German): ''Ich sterbe'' (&quot;I'm dying&quot;). The doctor calmed him, took a syringe, gave him an injection of [[camphor]], and ordered [[champagne (wine)|champagne]]. Anton took a full glass, examined it, smiled at me and said: &quot;It's a long time since I drank champagne.&quot; He drained it, lay quietly on his left side, and I just had time to run to him and lean across the bed and call to him, but he had stopped breathing and was sleeping peacefully as a child...&lt;ref&gt;Olga Knipper, ''Memoir'', in Benedetti, ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress'', 284.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chekhov's body was transported to Moscow in a refrigerated railway car for fresh [[oyster]]s, a detail which offended [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Banality revenged itself upon him by a nasty prank, for it saw that his corpse, the corpse of a poet, was put into a railway truck 'For the Conveyance of Oysters'.&quot; Maxim Gorky in [http://www.eldritchpress.org/ac/gorky.htm ''Reminiscences of Anton Chekhov''.]. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the thousands of mourners followed the funeral procession of a [[Fyodor Keller|General Keller]] by mistake, to the accompaniment of a military band.&lt;ref&gt;Chekhov's Funeral. M. Marcus.''The Antioch Review'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Chekhov was buried next to his father at the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, 91; Alexander Kuprin in [http://www.eldritchpress.org/ac/gorky.htm ''Reminiscences of Anton Chekhov'']. Retrieved 16 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A few months before he died, Chekhov told the writer [[Ivan Bunin]] he thought people might go on reading him for seven years. &quot;Why seven?&quot; asked Bunin. &quot;Well, seven and a half,&quot; Chekhov replied. &quot;That's not bad. I've got six years to live.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Payne, XXXVI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Always modest, Chekhov could hardly have imagined the extent of his posthumous reputation. The ovations for ''The Cherry Orchard'' in the year of his death showed him how high he had risen in the affection of the Russian public—by then he was second in literary celebrity only to Tolstoy,&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, a great admirer of Chekhov's short stories, divided them into two groups of &quot;first quality&quot; and &quot;second quality.&quot; In the first category were: ''Children, The Chorus Girl, A Play, Home, Misery, The Runaway, In Court, Vanka, Ladies, The Malefactors, The Boys, Darkness, Sleepy, The Helpmate, The Darling''; in the second: ''A Transgression, Sorrow, The Witch, Verochka, In a Strange Land, The Cook's Wedding, A Tedious Business, An Upheaval, Oh! The Public!, The Mask, A Woman's Luck, Nerves, The Wedding, A Defenseless Creature, Peasant Wives''. He had these stories bound into a book which he read repeatedly with great satisfaction. – Simmons, p. 595.&lt;/ref&gt; who outlived him by six years—but after his death, Chekhov's fame soon spread further afield. [[Constance Garnett]]'s translations won him an English-language readership and the admiration of writers such as [[James Joyce]], [[Virginia Woolf]], and [[Katherine Mansfield]]. The issues surrounding the close similarities between Mansfield's 1910 story ''The Child Who Was Tired'' and Chekhov's ''Sleepy'' are summarised in William H. New's ''Reading Mansfield and Metaphors of Reform''&lt;ref&gt;''Reading Mansfield and Metaphors of Reform'', McGill-Queen's Press, 1999, ISBN 978-0-7735-1791-2, 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian critic [[D.S. Mirsky]], who lived in England, explained Chekhov's popularity in that country by his &quot;unusually complete rejection of what we may call the heroic values.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 77.&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia itself, Chekhov's drama fell out of fashion after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|revolution]] but was later adapted to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agenda, with the character Lopakhin, for example, reinvented as a hero of the new order, taking an axe to the cherry orchard.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Danchenko&quot;&gt;&quot;They won't allow a play which is seen to lament the lost estates of the gentry.&quot; Letter of [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]], quoted by Anatoly Smeliansky in ''Chekhov at the Moscow Art Theatre'', from ''The Cambridge Companion to Chekhov'', 31–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first non-Russians to praise Chekhov's plays was [[George Bernard Shaw]], who subtitled his ''Heartbreak House'' &quot;A Fantasia in the Russian Manner on English Themes&quot; and noted similarities between the predicament of the British landed class and that of their Russian counterparts as depicted by Chekhov: &quot;the same nice people, the same utter futility.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anna Obraztsova, ''Bernard Shaw's Dialogue with Chekhov'', in Miles, 43–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, Chekhov's reputation began its rise slightly later, partly through the influence of [[Stanislavski's system]] of acting, with its notion of [[subtext]]: &quot;Chekhov often expressed his thought not in speeches,&quot; wrote Stanislavski, &quot;but in pauses or between the lines or in replies consisting of a single word… the characters often feel and think things not expressed in the lines they speak.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Elizabeth (ed), ''Stanislavski's Legacy'', Theatre Arts Books, 1987, ISBN 978-0-87830-127-0, 81, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Eßlin&quot;&gt;&quot;It was Chekhov who first deliberately wrote dialogue in which the mainstream of emotional action ran underneath the surface. It was he who articulated the notion that human beings hardly ever speak in explicit terms among each other about their deepest emotions, that the great, tragic, climactic moments are often happening beneath outwardly trivial conversation.&quot; [[Martin Esslin]], from ''Text and Subtext in Shavian Drama'', in ''1922: Shaw and the last Hundred Years'', ed. Bernard. F. Dukore, Penn State Press, 1994, ISBN 978-0-271-01324-4, 200.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]], in particular, developed the subtextual approach to drama, influencing generations of [[Theater in the United States|American playwrights]], screenwriters, and actors, including [[Clifford Odets]], [[Elia Kazan]] and, in particular, [[Lee Strasberg]]. In turn, Strasberg's [[Actors Studio]] and the [[Method acting|&quot;Method&quot; acting]] approach influenced many actors, including [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Robert De Niro]], though by then the Chekhov tradition may have been distorted by a preoccupation with realism.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Lee Strasberg became in my opinion a victim of the traditional idea of Chekhovian theatre… [he left] no room for Chekhov's imagery.&quot; Georgii Tostonogov on Strasberg's production of ''Three Sisters'' in ''The Drama Review'' (winter 1968), quoted by Styan, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the playwright [[Tennessee Williams]] adapted ''The Seagull'' as ''[[The Notebook of Trigorin]]''.

Despite Chekhov's eminence as a playwright, some writers believe his short stories represent the greater achievement.&lt;ref name = &quot;Boyd&quot;&gt;&quot;The plays lack the seamless authority of the fiction: there are great characters, wonderful scenes, tremendous passages, moments of acute melancholy and sagacity, but the parts appear greater than the whole.&quot; [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,6000,1261403,00.html ''A Chekhov Lexicon,''] by [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], ''The Guardian'', 3 July 2004. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond Carver]], who wrote the short story ''Errand'' about Chekhov's death, believed Chekhov the greatest of all short-story writers:

{{quote|Chekhov's stories are as wonderful (and necessary) now as when they first appeared. It is not only the immense number of stories he wrote—for few, if any, writers have ever done more—it is the awesome frequency with which he produced masterpieces, stories that shrive us as well as delight and move us, that lay bare our emotions in ways only true art can accomplish.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,,1261382,00.html ''From Russia, with Love''], ''The Guardian'', 15 July 2004. Retrieved 17 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Ernest Hemingway]], another writer influenced by Chekhov, was more grudging: &quot;Chekhov wrote about 6 good stories. But he was an amateur writer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from [[Ernest Hemingway]] to [[Archibald MacLeish]], 1925 (from ''Selected Letters'', p. 179), in ''Ernest Hemingway on Writing'', Ed Larry W. Phillips, Touchstone, (1984) 1999, ISBN 978-0-684-18119-6, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Vladimir Nabokov]] once complained of Chekhov's &quot;medley of dreadful prosaisms, ready-made epithets, repetitions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; But he also declared ''The Lady with the Dog'' &quot;one of the greatest stories ever written&quot; and described Chekhov as writing &quot;the way one person relates to another the most important things in his life, slowly and yet without a break, in a slightly subdued voice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;From [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''Lectures on Russian Literature'', quoted by [[Francine Prose]] in ''Learning from Chekhov'', 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the writer [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], Chekhov's breakthrough was to abandon what [[William Gerhardie]] called the &quot;event plot&quot; for something more &quot;blurred, interrupted, mauled or otherwise tampered with by life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;For the first time in literature the fluidity and randomness of life was made the form of the fiction. Before Chekhov, the event-plot drove all fictions.&quot; [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], referring to the novelist [[William Gerhardie]]'s analysis in ''Anton Chekhov: A Critical Study'', 1923. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,6000,1261403,00.html ''A Chekhov Lexicon,''] by William Boyd, ''The Guardian'', 3 July 2004. Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia Woolf mused on the unique quality of a Chekhov story in ''The Common Reader'' (1925):

{{quote|But is it the end, we ask? We have rather the feeling that we have overrun our signals; or it is as if a tune had stopped short without the expected chords to close it. These stories are inconclusive, we say, and proceed to frame a criticism based upon the assumption that stories ought to conclude in a way that we recognise. In so doing we raise the question of our own fitness as readers. Where the tune is familiar and the end emphatic—lovers united, villains discomfited, intrigues exposed—as it is in most [[Victorian literature|Victorian fiction]], we can scarcely go wrong, but where the tune is unfamiliar and the end a note of interrogation or merely the information that they went on talking, as it is in Tchekov, we need a very daring and alert sense of literature to make us hear the tune, and in particular those last notes which complete the harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Virginia, ''The Common Reader: First Series, Annotated Edition'', Harvest/HBJ Book, 2002, ISBN 0-15-602778-X, 172.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Action Against Hunger''' (known internationally as '''Action Contre la Faim''', or '''ACF International''') is an international humanitarian organization with a focus on ending world hunger. Action Against Hunger specializes in responding to emergency situations of war, conflict, and natural disaster. Their programs in nutrition, water and sanitation, [[food security]], health care, and advocacy serve more than 5&amp;nbsp;million people in over 40 countries. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==History==
Action Against Hunger (ACF) was established in 1979 by a group of French doctors, scientists, and writers. Nobel Prize-winning physicist Professor [[Alfred Kastler]] served as the organization’s first chairman.

ACF moved to provide assistance to [[Afghan refugees]] in [[Pakistan]], famine-stricken [[Uganda]]n communities, and [[Cambodia]]n refugees in [[Thailand]].  ACF expanded to address humanitarian concerns in Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Balkans and elsewhere in the 1980s and 1990s. Action Against Hunger’s Scientific Committee pioneered the therapeutic milk formula ([[F-100 (food)|F100]]), now used by all major humanitarian aid organizations to treat acute malnutrition. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} As a result, the global mortality rate of severely malnourished children under the age of five has been reduced from 25% to 5%.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Action Against Hunger – USA was established in 1985 and became the first member of what is now ACF International. ACF International currently has headquarters in five countries – France, Spain, the United States, Canada and the UK. All members of the ACF International Network agree to a charter of principles: independence, impartiality, nondiscrimination, free and direct access to victims, professionalism, and transparency.

In the short term, Action Against Hunger addresses hunger and malnutrition through feeding centers, food and supply distributions and by providing water and sanitation facilities in emergency situations. In the long term, ACF provides training in nutrition, water and sanitation, food security, and health care.. ACF utilizes international experts and over 6000 local (national) staff to develop programs.

===Attack against workers===
{{Main|Muttur massacre|Attacks on humanitarian workers}}

In 2006, Action Against Hunger lost 17 of its workers in a town called [[Muttur (Sri Lanka)|Muttur]] who were working in post [[2004 Tsunami]] reconstruction effort in [[Sri Lanka]] due to violence. The independent [[Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission]] has implicated the government forces but the government currently denies it and is conducting an investigation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Programs==
===Nutrition===
ACF sets up feeding centers to treat malnourished children. They also help control and prevent malnutrition through child-growth monitoring, nutritional surveys, and public education. Therapeutic feeding centers treat children with acute severe malnutrition through rigorous programs of medical treatment.

===Water and sanitation===
ACF provides access to safe drinking water by drilling wells, tapping springs, and installing water systems. They train local teams and communities to maintain equipment and work with the population on the importance of clean water and sanitation.

===Food security===
ACF distributes seeds and tools as well as conduct training programs in income-generating activities such as farming, gardening, animal breeding, and food conservation.

===Health===
ACF sets up mother and child health centers to provide immunization and pre/post-natal care. Their public health programs train medical staff, provide medicine, monitor and control epidemics, and rehabilitate clinics.

===Advocacy===
Action Against Hunger raises awareness about hunger and seeks to alert the international community when human rights, especially the right to food, are violated.

==Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award==
The Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award recognizes individuals who have made substantive contributions to the humanitarian field through philanthropy, public awareness, or their efforts to directly improve conditions for distressed communities.

In 2009, ACF honored the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] and its [[Director-General]], [[Jacques Diouf]], &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/news/story/pt/item/47266/icode/en/&lt;/ref&gt; for their long-standing commitment to fighting hunger and poverty.

In 2008, [[Anderson Cooper]] was the first journalist to receive the Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award. He was selected as the recipient for the award in 2008 for his ongoing coverage of key global issues and for bringing some of the most glaring humanitarian tragedies into focus for the American public.

In 2007, film director and Academy Award nominee [[Terry George]] was the recipient of the annual award for his long-standing humanitarian commitments, and the impact of his award winning depiction of the Rwandan Genocide in his movie, Hotel Rwanda.

The 2006 Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award recipient was [[Susan Sarandon]]. She was honored for her work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, an advocate for victims of hunger and HIV/AIDS, and a spokesperson for Heifer International. Documentary filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] introduced her and presented her with the award.

In 2005, the recipient of the award was the Nobel Laureate [[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]] in recognition of his outstanding work against hunger, malnutrition and poverty worldwide.

Past recipients of the award have included Nobel Laureate and former South African President [[Nelson Mandela]] (2004), as well as the Pulitzer Prize-winning author [[Frank McCourt]] (2002), and [[Jeff Bridges]], among others.

==Campaigns and activities==
===Athletes Against Hunger===
A growing number of athletes are devoting their efforts to raising awareness and funds for Action Against Hunger.

This informal assemblage of adventurers, which was dubbed &quot;Athletes Against Hunger&quot;, have devoted their time, resources, and hard work to bringing an end to malnutrition. They have climbed Everest, inline skated across the country and hiked the Appalachian Trail, to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actionagainsthunger.org/get-involved/athletes-against-hunger&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race Against Hunger===
The Race Against Hunger is a Service Learning campaign that unites middle and high school students from all over the world in the fight against global hunger and malnutrition. The Race aims to educate American students about the causes of global hunger and inspire them to be a part of the solution.

The educational component of the Race involves an interactive program about global hunger that teachers implement in their classrooms. Recognizing the paradox of hunger in the developing world amidst an obesity epidemic in the United States, the curriculum is followed by an opportunity for students to engage in a fun and healthy activity through a “fun-run” event. Students seek sponsorships for the “fun-run”, and the proceeds raised by students directly support Action Against Hunger’s life-saving programs around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actionagainsthunger.org/get-involved/race-against-hunger&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actionagainsthunger.org.uk/get-involved/events/running-events/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Zidane]] attended the Race Against Hunger organized by Action Against Hunger Spain (also known as Acción Contra el Hambre) held at the French Lyceum of Madrid. This event raised an estimated 25,000 Euros.

===Restaurants Against Hunger===
Action Against Hunger's annual Restaurants Against Hunger Campaign partners with leaders from the food and beverage industry to bring attention to problem of global hunger. Each year, the campaign raises vital funds and support for Action Against Hunger’s life-saving humanitarian programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.restaurantsagainsthunger.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actionagainsthunger.org/get-involved/restaurants-against-hunger&lt;/ref&gt;

Various singers have performed at the annual Restaurants Against Hunger Spring Gala including [[Kaïssa]] and Clara Lofaro.

During the month of March 2010, several chefs, including Atul Kochhar and Rick Stein, cooked meals in a [[pop-up restaurant]] in London to help raise funds for the organization's efforts in [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Putney Popup Has Seats Still Available |url=http://www.zagat.com/Blog/Detail.aspx?SNP=NL&amp;SCID=36&amp;BLGID=26678 |work=Zagat.com |date=March 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes include [[Bleb (cell biology)|blebbing]], loss of [[cell membrane]] asymmetry and attachment, cell shrinkage, [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] fragmentation, [[chromatin condensation]], and [[chromosome|chromosomal]] [[DNA]] fragmentation. (See also [[Apoptosis DNA fragmentation]].) Unlike [[necrosis]], apoptosis produces cell fragments called apoptotic bodies that surrounding cells are able to engulf and quickly remove before the contents of the cell can spill out onto surrounding cells and cause damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alberts |first=Keith |last2=Johnson |first2=Alexander |last3=Lewis |first3=Julian |last4=Raff |first4=Martin |last5=Roberts |last6=Walter |first6=Peter |title=[[Molecular Biology of the Cell (textbook)]] |edition=5th |publisher=[[Garland Science]] |page=1115 |chapter=Chapter 18 Apoptosis: Programmed Cell Death Eliminates Unwanted Cells |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8153-4105-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to [[necrosis]], which is a form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury, apoptosis, in general, confers advantages during an organism's life cycle. For example, the differentiation of fingers and toes in a developing human [[embryo]] occurs because cells between the fingers apoptose; the result is that the digits are separate. Between 50 and 70 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] cells die each day due to apoptosis in the average human adult.{{MEDCN|date=October 2010}} For an average child between the ages of 8 and 14, approximately 20 billion to 30 billion cells die a day.{{MEDCN|date=October 2010}} 

Research in and around apoptosis has increased substantially since the early 1990s. In addition to its importance as a biological phenomenon, defective apoptotic processes have been implicated in an extensive variety of diseases. Excessive apoptosis causes [[atrophy]], whereas an insufficient amount results in uncontrolled cell proliferation, such as [[cancer]].

==Discovery and etymology==
{{Main|History and highlights in apoptosis research}}

German scientist [[Carl Vogt]] was first to describe the principle of apoptosis in 1842. In 1885, anatomist [[Walther Flemming]] delivered a more precise description of the process of programmed cell death. However, it was not until 1965 that the topic was resurrected. While studying tissues using electron microscopy, John Foxton Ross Kerr at University of Queensland was able to distinguish apoptosis ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ''apo'' - from/off/without, ''ptosis'' - falling) from traumatic cell death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kerr|first=JF.|year=1965|title=A histochemical study of hypertrophy and ischaemic injury of rat liver with special reference to changes in lysosomes|journal=[[Journal of Pathology and Bacteriology]]|issue=90|pages=419–35|doi=10.1002/path.1700900210|volume=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of a paper describing the phenomenon, Kerr was invited to join Alastair R Currie, as well as [[Andrew Wyllie]], who was Currie's graduate student,&lt;ref name=&quot;AHW 1972&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.a-star.edu.sg/astar/biomed/action/biomed_dvp_abstract.do?id=2901ddeb02dH |title=Prof Andrew H. Wyllie - Lecture Abstract|accessdate=2007-03-30|author=Agency for Science, Technology and Research |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071113101931/http://www.a-star.edu.sg/astar/biomed/action/biomed_dvp_abstract.do?id=2901ddeb02dH &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; at University of Aberdeen. In 1972, the trio published a seminal article in the [[British Journal of Cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kerr JF, Wyllie AH, Currie AR |title=Apoptosis: a basic biological phenomenon with wide-ranging implications in tissue kinetics |journal=Br. J. Cancer |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=239–57 |year=1972 |month=August |pmid=4561027 |doi= |url= |pmc=2008650}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerr had initially used the term programmed cell necrosis, but in the article, the process of natural cell death was called ''apoptosis''. Kerr, Wyllie and Currie credited James Cormack, a professor of Greek language at [[University of Aberdeen]], with suggesting the term apoptosis. Kerr received the [[Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize]] on March 14, 2000, for his description of apoptosis. He shared the prize with Boston biologist [[Robert Horvitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Rourke MG, Ellem KA |title=John Kerr and apoptosis |journal=Med. J. Aust. |volume=173 |issue=11–12 |pages=616–7 |year=2000 |pmid=11379508 |doi= |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/173_11_041200/orourke/orourke.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2002 [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] was awarded to [[Sydney Brenner]], Horvitz and [[John E. Sulston]] for their work regarding apoptosis.

In Greek, apoptosis translates to the &quot;dropping off&quot; of petals or leaves from plants or trees. Cormack, professor of Greek language, reintroduced the term for medical use as it had a medical meaning for the Greeks over two thousand years before. [[Hippocrates]] used the term to mean &quot;the falling off of the bones&quot;. [[Galen]] extended its meaning to &quot;the dropping of the scabs&quot;. Cormack was no doubt aware of this usage when he suggested the name. Debate continues over the correct pronunciation, with opinion divided between a pronunciation with the second ''p'' silent ({{IPAc-en|æ|p|ə|ˈ|t|oʊ|s|ɨ|s}} {{respell|ap-ə|TOH|sis}}&lt;ref name=&quot;bartleby.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutapop&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/sigs/aig/Aboutapo.html|title=About apoptosis|accessdate=2006-12-15|year=1999|author=Apoptosis Interest Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the second ''p'' pronounced ({{IPAc-en|æ|p|ə|p|ˈ|t|oʊ|s|ɨ|s}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;bartleby.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webster.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.webster.com/dictionary/apoptosis Webster.com dictionary entry]&lt;/ref&gt; as in the original Greek.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In English, the ''p'' of the Greek ''-pt-'' [[consonant cluster]] is typically silent at the beginning of a word (e.g. [[pterodactyl]], [[Ptolemy]]), but articulated when used in combining forms preceded by a vowel, as in [[helicopter]] or the orders of insects: [[diptera]], [[lepidoptera]], etc.

In the original Kerr Wyllie and Currie paper, British Journal of Cancer, 1972 Aug;26(4):239-57, there is a footnote regarding the pronunciation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;We are most grateful to Professor James Cormack of the Department of Greek, University of Aberdeen, for suggesting this term.  The word &quot;apoptosis&quot; (Greek spelling of apoptosis) is used in Greek to describe the &quot;dropping off&quot; or &quot;falling off&quot; of petals from flowers, or leaves from trees.  To show the derivation clearly, we propose that the stress should be on the penultimate syllable, the second half of the word being pronounced like &quot;ptosis&quot; (with the &quot;p&quot; silent), which comes from the same root &quot;to fall&quot;, and is already used to describe the drooping of the upper eyelid.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Process==
[[Image:Apoptosis.png|right]]
[[File:Control Of The Apoptosis Mecanisms.pdf|thumb|alt=Control Of The Apoptotic hai Mechanisms|Control Of The Apoptotic Mechanisms]]
The process of apoptosis is controlled by a diverse range of [[cell signalling|cell signals]], which may originate either extracellularly (''extrinsic inducers'') or intracellularly (''intrinsic inducers''). Extracellular signals may include [[toxin]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Popov SG, Villasmil R, Bernardi J |title=Lethal toxin of Bacillus anthracis causes apoptosis of macrophages |journal=Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. |volume=293 |issue=1 |pages=349–55 |year=2002 |month=April |pmid=12054607 |doi=10.1016/S0006-291X(02)00227-9 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hormone]]s, [[growth factor]]s, [[nitric oxide]]&lt;ref name=&quot;NO&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brüne B |title=Nitric oxide: NO apoptosis or turning it ON? |journal=Cell Death Differ. |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=864–9 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12867993 |doi=10.1038/sj.cdd.4401261 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[cytokine]]s, that must either cross the plasma membrane or [[signal transduction|transduce]] to effect a response. These signals may positively (i.e., trigger) or negatively (i.e., repress, inhibit, or dampen) affect apoptosis. (Binding and subsequent trigger of apoptosis by a molecule is termed ''positive induction'', whereas the active repression or inhibition of apoptosis by a molecule is termed ''negative inductio''n.)

A cell initiates intracellular apoptotic signalling in response to a stress, which may bring about cell suicide.

Before the actual process of cell death is precipitated by enzymes, apoptotic signals must cause regulatory proteins to initiate the apoptosis pathway. This step allows apoptotic signals to cause cell death, or the process to be stopped, should the cell no longer need to die. Several proteins are involved, but two main methods of regulation have been identified: targeting [[mitochondria]] functionality, or directly transducing the signal via [[adaptor proteins]] to the apoptotic mechanisms. Another extrinsic pathway for initiation identified in several toxin studies is an increase in calcium concentration within a cell caused by drug activity, which also can cause apoptosis via a calcium binding protease [[calpain]].

===Mitochondrial regulation===
The [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] are essential to multicellular life. Without them, a cell ceases to [[aerobic respiration|respire aerobically]] and quickly dies, a fact exploited by some apoptotic pathways. Apoptotic proteins that target mitochondria affect them in different ways. They may cause mitochondrial swelling through the formation of membrane pores, or they may increase the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and cause apoptotic effectors to leak out.&lt;ref name=&quot;robspath&quot;/&gt; There is also a growing body of evidence indicating that [[nitric oxide]] is able to induce apoptosis by helping to dissipate the [[membrane potential]] of mitochondria and therefore make it more permeable.&lt;ref name=&quot;NO&quot;/&gt;

Mitochondrial proteins known as SMACs (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) are released into the [[cytosol]] following an increase in permeability. SMAC binds to ''[[Inhibitor of apoptosis|inhibitor of apoptosis proteins]]'' (IAPs) and deactivates them, preventing the IAPs from arresting the apoptotic process and therefore allowing apoptosis to proceed. IAP also normally suppresses the activity of a group of [[cysteine protease]]s called [[caspase]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;caspcontrol&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Fesik SW, Shi Y.| title=Controlling the caspases| journal=Science| year=2001| volume=294| issue=5546| pages=1477–8| doi=10.1126/science.1062236| pmid=11711663}}&lt;/ref&gt; which carry out the degradation of the cell, therefore the actual degradation enzymes can be seen to be indirectly regulated by mitochondrial permeability.

[[Cytochrome c]] is also released from mitochondria due to formation of a channel, [[mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel|MAC]], in the outer mitochondrial membrane,&lt;ref name=&quot;knife&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Laurent M. Dejean, Sonia Martinez-Caballero, Kathleen W. Kinnally| title=Is MAC the knife that cuts cytochrome c from mitochondria during apoptosis? | journal=Cell Death and Differentiation| year=2006| volume=13| url=http://www.nature.com/cdd/journal/v13/n8/full/4401949a.html
 | doi = 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401949| pages=1387–5 | pmid=16676005 | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and serves a regulatory function as it precedes morphological change associated with apoptosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;robspath&quot;/&gt; Once cytochrome c is released it binds with Apoptotic protease activating factor - 1 (''[[Apaf-1]]'') and [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], which then bind to ''pro-caspase-9'' to create a protein complex known as an [[apoptosome]]. The apoptosome cleaves the pro-caspase to its active form of [[caspase-9]], which in turn activates the effector ''caspase-3''.

[[MAC, the Mitochondrial Apoptosis-Induced Channel|MAC]], also called &quot;Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization Pore&quot; is regulated by various proteins, such as those encoded by the mammalian ''[[Bcl-2]]'' family of anti-apoptopic genes, the homologs of the ''[[CED9 (gene)|ced-9]]'' gene found in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;knife2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dejean LM, Martinez-Caballero S, Manon S, Kinnally KW |title=Regulation of the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel, MAC, by BCL-2 family proteins |journal=Biochim.

Bax and/or Bak form the pore, while Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 inhibit its formation.

===Direct signal transduction===
[[Image:signal transduction pathways.png|thumb|500px|right|Overview of signal transduction pathways.]]
[[Image:TFN-signalling.png|thumb|right|250px|Overview of TNF signalling in apoptosis, an example of direct signal transduction]]
[[Image:Fas-signalling.png|thumb|right|250px|Overview of Fas signalling in apoptosis, an example of direct signal transduction]]
Two theories of the direct initiation of apoptotic mechanisms in mammals have been suggested: the ''TNF-induced'' ([[tumour necrosis factor]]) model and the  ''Fas-Fas [[ligand]]-mediated'' model, both involving receptors of the ''TNF receptor'' (TNFR) family&lt;ref name=&quot;fas&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wajant H| title=The Fas signaling pathway: more than a paradigm| journal=Science| year=2002| volume=296| issue=5573| pages=1635–6| doi=10.1126/science.1071553| pmid=12040174}}&lt;/ref&gt; coupled to extrinsic signals.

====TNF path====
TNF is a [[cytokine]] produced mainly by activated [[macrophage]]s, and is the major extrinsic mediator of binary hipaloptic apoptosis. Most cells in the human body have two receptors for TNF: ''TNF-R1'' and ''TNF-R2''. The binding of TNF to ''TNF-R1'' has been shown to initiate the pathway that leads to caspase activation via the intermediate membrane proteins ''TNF receptor-associated death domain'' (TRADD) and ''Fas-associated death domain protein'' ([[FADD]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;tnfr1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Chen G, Goeddel DV| title=TNF-R1 signaling: a beautiful pathway| journal=Science| year=2002| volume=296| issue=5573| pages=1634–5| doi=10.1126/science.1071924| pmid=12040173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Binding of this receptor can also indirectly lead to the activation of [[transcription factor]]s involved in cell survival and inflammatory responses.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfnpathway&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Goeddel, DV| title=Connection Map for Tumor Necrosis Factor Pathway| journal=Science| url=http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/cm/CMP_7107
 | doi = 10.1126/stke.3822007tw132] | doi_brokendate=2009-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The link between TNF and apoptosis shows why an abnormal production of TNF plays a fundamental role in several human diseases, especially in [[autoimmune disease]]s.

====Fas path====
The [[Fas receptor]] (also known as ''Apo-1'' or ''CD95'') binds the [[FAS ligand|Fas ligand]] (FasL), a [[transmembrane protein]] part of the TNF family.&lt;ref name=&quot;fas&quot;/&gt; The interaction between Fas and FasL results in the formation of the ''death-inducing signaling complex'' (DISC), which contains the FADD, caspase-8 and caspase-10. In some types of cells (type I), processed caspase-8 directly activates other members of the caspase family, and triggers the execution of apoptosis of the cell. In other types of cells (type II), the ''Fas''-DISC starts a feedback loop that spirals into increasing release of pro-apoptotic factors from mitochondria and the amplified activation of caspase-8.&lt;ref name=&quot;fassignal&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wajant, H.| title=Connection Map for Fas Signaling Pathway| journal=Science| url=http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/cm/CMP_7966 | doi = 10.1126/stke.3802007tr1] | doi_brokendate=2009-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Common components====
Following ''TNF-R1'' and ''Fas'' activation in mammalian cells a balance between pro-apoptotic ([[Bcl-2-associated X protein|BAX]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bax&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Murphy KM, Ranganathan V, Farnsworth ML, Kavallaris M, Lock RB |title=Bcl-2 inhibits Bax translocation from cytosol to mitochondria during drug-induced apoptosis of human tumor cells |journal=Cell Death Differ. |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=102–11 |year=2000 |month=January |pmid=10713725 |doi=10.1038/sj.cdd.4400597 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BH3 interacting domain death agonist|BID]], [[Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer|BAK]], or [[Bcl-2-associated death promoter|BAD]]) and anti-apoptotic (''[[Bcl-Xl]]'' and ''[[Bcl-2]]'') members of the ''Bcl-2'' family is established. This balance is the proportion of pro-apoptotic [[homodimer]]s that form in the outer-membrane of the mitochondrion. The pro-apoptotic homodimers are required to make the mitochondrial membrane permeable for the release of caspase activators such as cytochrome c and SMAC. Control of pro-apoptotic proteins under normal cell conditions of non-apoptotic cells is incompletely understood, but in general, Bax or Bak are activated by the activation of BH3-only proteins, part of the [[Bcl-2]] family.
=====Caspases=====
Caspase  play the central role in the transduction of DR apoptotic signals. Caspases are proteins that are highly conserved, cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases. There are two types of caspases: initiator caspases, caspase 8,10,9,2, and effector caspases, caspase 3,7,6. The activation of initiator caspases requires binding to specific oligomeric adaptor protein. Effector caspases are then activated by these active initiator caspases through proteolytic cleavage. The active effector caspases then proteolytically degrade a host of intracellular proteins to carry out the cell death program.

====Caspase-independent apoptotic pathway====
There also exists a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway that is mediated by AIF ([[apoptosis-inducing factor]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9989411&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Susin SA, Lorenzo HK, Zamzami N |title=Molecular characterization of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor |journal=Nature |volume=397 |issue=6718 |pages=441–6 |year=1999 |month=February |pmid=9989411 |doi=10.1038/17135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Execution===

Many pathways and signals lead to apoptosis, but there is only one mechanism that actually causes the death of a cell.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} After a cell receives stimulus, it undergoes organized degradation of cellular organelles by activated [[proteolytic]] [[caspase]]s. A cell undergoing apoptosis shows a characteristic morphology:

Apoptosis progresses quickly and its products are quickly removed, making it difficult to detect or visualize. During karyorrhexis, [[endonuclease]] activation leaves short DNA fragments, regularly spaced in size. These give a characteristic &quot;laddered&quot; appearance on [[agar]] gel after [[electrophoresis]].

===Removal of dead cells===
The removal of dead cells by neighboring phagocytic cells has been termed [[efferocytosis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16778289&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vandivier RW, Henson PM, Douglas IS |title=Burying the dead: the impact of failed apoptotic cell removal (efferocytosis) on chronic inflammatory lung disease |journal=Chest |volume=129 |issue=6 |pages=1673–82 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16778289 |doi=10.1378/chest.129.6.1673 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dying cells that undergo the final stages of apoptosis display phagocytotic molecules, such as [[phosphatidylserine]], on their cell surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phosphatidylserine&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Li MO| title=Phosphatidylserine receptor is required for clearance of apoptotic cells| journal=Science| year=2003| volume=302| issue=5650|  pages=1560–3| doi=10.1126/science.1087621| pmid=14645847 | last2=Sarkisian | first2=MR | last3=Mehal | first3=WZ | last4=Rakic | first4=P | last5=Flavell | first5=RA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphatidylserine is normally found on the cytosolic surface of the plasma membrane, but is redistributed during apoptosis to the extracellular surface by a hypothetical protein known as [[scramblase]].&lt;ref name=&quot;phago2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wang X| title=Cell corpse engulfment mediated by C. elegans phosphatidylserine receptor through CED-5 and CED-12| journal=Science| year=2003| volume=302| issue=5650| pages=1563–1566| doi=10.1126/science.1087641| pmid=14645848 | last2=Wu | first2=YC | last3=Fadok | first3=VA | last4=Lee | first4=MC | last5=Gengyo-Ando | first5=K | last6=Cheng | first6=LC | last7=Ledwich | first7=D | last8=Hsu | first8=PK | last9=Chen | first9=JY}}&lt;/ref&gt; These molecules mark the cell for [[phagocytosis]] by cells possessing the appropriate receptors, such as macrophages.&lt;ref name=&quot;phago1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Savill J, Gregory C, Haslett C.| title=Eat me or die| journal=Science| year=2003| volume=302| issue=5650|  pages=1516–7| doi=10.1126/science.1092533| pmid=14645835}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon recognition, the phagocyte reorganizes its cytoskeleton for engulfment of the cell. The removal of dying cells by phagocytes occurs in an orderly manner without eliciting an [[inflammatory response]].
==Apoptosis Pathway Knock-Outs==
Many knock-outs have been made in the apoptosis pathways to test the function of each of the proteins. Several caspases, in addition to APAF-1 and FADD, have been mutated to determine the new phenotype. In order to create a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) knockout, an exon containing the nucleotides 3704-5364 was removed from the gene. This exon encodes a portion of the mature TNF domain, as well as the leader sequence which is a highly conserved region necessary for proper intracellular processing. TNF-/- mice develop normally and have no gross structural or morphological abnormalities. However, upon immunization with SRBC (sheep red blood cells), these mice demonstrated a deficiency in the maturation of an antibody response; they were able to generate normal levels of IgM, but could not develop specific IgG levels. Apaf-1 is the protein that turns on caspase 9 by cleavage to begin the caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis. Since a -/- mutation in the APAF-1 gene is embryonic lethal, a gene trap strategy was used in order to generate an APAF-1 -/- mouse. This assay is used to disrupt gene function by creating an intragenic gene fusion. When an APAF-1 gene trap is introduced into cells, many morphological changes occur, such as spina bifida, the persistence of interdigital webs, and open brain. Additionally, after embryonic day 12.5, the brain of the embryos showed several structural changes. Interestingly, APAF-1 cells are protected from apoptosis stimuli such as irradiation. A BAX-1 knock-out mouse exhibits normal forebrain formation and a decreased programmed cell death in some neuronal populations and in the spinal cord, leading to an increase in motor neurons.

The caspase proteins are integral parts of the apoptosis pathway, so it follows that knock-outs made have varying damaging results. A caspase 9 knock-out leads to a severe brain malformation. A caspase 8 knock-out leads to cardiac failure and thus embryonic lethality. However, with the use of cre-lox technology, a caspase 8 knock-out has been created that exhibits an increase in peripheral T cells, an impaired T cell response, and a defect in neural tube closure. Interestingly, these mice were found to be resistant to apoptosis mediated by CD95, TNFR, etc. but not resistant to apoptosis caused by UV irradiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and other stimuli. Finally, a caspase 3 knock-out was characterized by ectopic cell masses in the brain and abnormal apoptotic features such as membrane blebbing or nuclear fragmentation. A remarkable feature of these KO mice is that they have a very restricted phenotype: Casp3, 9, APAF-1 KO mice have deformations of neural tissue and FADD and Casp 8 KO showed defective heart development, however in both types of KO others organs developed normally and some cell types were still sensitive to apoptotic stimuli suggesting that unknown pro-apoptotic pathways exist.

===Defective apoptotic pathways===
The many different types of apoptotic pathways contain a multitude of different biochemical components, many of them not yet understood.&lt;ref name=&quot;pathogenesis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Thompson, CB| title=Apoptosis in the pathogenesis and treatment of disease| journal=Science| year=1995| volume=267| issue=5203| pages=1456–62| doi=10.1126/science.7878464| pmid=7878464}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a pathway is more or less sequential in nature, it is a victim of causality; removing or modifying one component leads to an effect in another. In a living organism this can have disastrous effects, often in the form of disease or disorder. A discussion of every disease caused by modification of the various apoptotic pathways would be impractical, but the concept overlying each one is the same: the normal functioning of the pathway has been disrupted in such a way as to impair the ability of the cell to undergo normal apoptosis. This results in a cell that lives past its &quot;use-by-date&quot; and is able to replicate and pass on any faulty machinery to its progeny, increasing the likelihood of the cell becoming cancerous or diseased.

A recently-described example of this concept in action can be seen in the development of a lung cancer called NCI-H460.&lt;ref name=&quot;h460&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yang L, Mashima T, Sato S |title=Predominant suppression of apoptosome by inhibitor of apoptosis protein in non-small cell lung cancer H460 cells: therapeutic effect of a novel polyarginine-conjugated Smac peptide |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=831–7 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12591734 |doi= |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12591734}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein'' ([[XIAP]]) is [[Gene expression|overexpressed]] in cells of the H460 [[cell line]]. XIAPs bind to the processed form of caspase-9, and suppress the activity of apoptotic activator [[cytochrome c]], therefore overexpression leads to a decrease in the amount of pro-apoptotic agonists. As a consequence, the balance of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic effectors is upset in favour of the former, and the damaged cells continue to replicate despite being directed to die.

'''Dysregulation of p53'''

The tumor-suppressor protein [[p53]] accumulates when DNA is damaged due to a chain of biochemical factors. Part of this pathway includes alpha-[[interferon]] and beta-interferon, which induce transcription of the ''p53'' gene and result in the increase of p53 protein level and enhancement of cancer cell-apoptosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;takaoka&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Takaoka A| title=Integration of interferon-alpha/beta signalling to p53 responses in tumour suppression and antiviral defence| journal=Nature| year=2003| volume=424| issue=6948| pmid=12872134| pages=516–23| doi=10.1038/nature01850 | last2=Hayakawa | first2=S | last3=Yanai | first3=H | last4=Stoiber | first4=D | last5=Negishi | first5=H | last6=Kikuchi | first6=H | last7=Sasaki | first7=S | last8=Imai | first8=K | last9=Shibue | first9=T}}&lt;/ref&gt; p53 prevents the cell from replicating by stopping the [[cell cycle]] at G1, or interphase, to give the cell time to repair, however it will induce apoptosis if damage is extensive and repair efforts fail. Any disruption to the regulation of the ''p53'' or interferon genes will result in impaired apoptosis and the possible formation of tumors.

===Inhibition of Apoptosis===
Inhibition of apoptosis can result in a number of cancers, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and viral infections. It was originally believed that the associated accumulation of cells was due to an increase in cellular proliferation, but it is now known that it is also due to a decrease in cell death. The most common of these diseases is cancer, the disease of excessive cellular proliferation, which is oftentimes characterized by an overexpression of IAP family members. As a result, the malignant cells experience an abnormal response to apoptosis induction: cycle regulating genes (such as p53, ras or c-myc) are mutated or inactivated in diseased cells, and further genes (such as bcl-2) also modify their expression in tumors.
====Treatments====
The main method of treatment for death signaling-related diseases involves either increasing or decreasing the susceptibility of apoptosis in diseased cells, depending on whether the disease is caused by either the inhibition of or excess apoptosis. For instance, treatments aim to restore apoptosis to treat diseases with deficient cell death, and to increase the apoptotic threshold to treat diseases involved with excessive cell death. To stimulate apoptosis, one can increase the number of death receptor ligands (such as TNF or TRAIL), antagonize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 pathway, or introduce Smac mimetics to inhibit the inhibitor (IAPs). The addition of agents such as Herceptin, Iressa or Gleevec works to stop cells from cycling and causes apoptosis activation by blocking growth and survival signaling further upstream. Finally, adding p53-MDM2 complexes displaces p53 and activates the p53 pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Many different methods can be used to stimulate apoptosis in various places along the death signaling pathway.

===Hyperactive Apoptosis===
On the other hand, loss of control of cell death (resulting in excess apoptosis) can lead to neurodegenerative diseases, hematologic diseases, and tissue damage.  The progression of HIV is directly linked to excess, unregulated apoptosis.  In a healthy individual, the number of CD4+ lymphocytes is in balance with the cells generated by the bone marrow; however, in HIV-positive patients, this balance is lost due to an inability of the bone marrow to regenerate CD4+ cells.  In the case of HIV, CD4+ lymphocytes die at an accelerated rate through uncontrolled apoptosis, when stimulated.
====Treatments====
Treatments aiming to inhibit apoptosis work to simultaneously inhibit the expression of pro-apoptotic factors and promote the expression of anti-apoptotic factors. Fas-induced apoptosis can be blocked by use of FLIPs (FLICE-inhibitory proteins, which inhibit caspases-8 and -10), Bcl-2 (which prevents cytochrome c release and the subsequent activation of caspase 9), and CrmA (Cytokine response modifier A). Increasing the concentration of IAPs works to block specific caspases. Finally, the Akt protein kinase promotes cell survival through two pathways. Akt phosphorylates and inhibits Bas (a Bcl-2 family member), causing Bas to interact with the 14-3-3 scaffold, resulting in Bcl dissociation and thus cell survival. Akt also activates IKKα, which leads to NFkB activation and cell survival. Active NFkB induces the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis.

===HIV progression===
The progression of the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] infection into [[AIDS]] is primarily due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T-helper lymphocytes]] in a manner that is too rapid for the body's bone marrow to replenish the cells, leading to a compromised immune system. One of the mechanisms by which T-helper cells are depleted is apoptosis, which results from a series of biochemical pathways:&lt;ref name=&quot;Judie&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Judie B. Alimonti, T. Blake Ball, Keith R. Fowke| title=Mechanisms of CD4+ T lymphocyte cell death in human immunodeficiency virus infection and AIDS| journal=J Gen Virology| year=2003| issue=84| url=http://vir.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/84/7/1649

#HIV enzymes deactivate anti-apoptotic ''Bcl-2'' This does not directly cause cell death, but primes the cell for apoptosis should the appropriate signal be received.  In parallel, these enzymes activate pro-apoptotic ''procaspase-8'', which does directly activate the mitochondrial events of apoptosis.
#HIV may increase the level of cellular proteins which prompt Fas-mediated apoptosis.
#HIV proteins decrease the amount of [[CD4]] glycoprotein marker present on the cell membrane.
#Released viral particles and proteins present in extracellular fluid are able to induce apoptosis in nearby &quot;bystander&quot; T helper cells.
#HIV decreases the production of molecules involved in marking the cell for apoptosis, giving the virus time to replicate and continue releasing apoptotic agents and virions into the surrounding tissue.
#The infected CD4+ cell may also receive the death signal from a cytotoxic T cell.

Cells may also die as a direct consequence of viral infection.

===Viral infection===
Viruses can trigger apoptosis of infected cells via a range of mechanisms including:
*Receptor binding.

These homologs can inhibit pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK, which are essential for the activation of apoptosis. Examples of viral Bcl-2 proteins include the [[Epstein-Barr virus]] BHRF1 protein and the [[adenovirus]] E1B 19K protein.&lt;ref name=Polster&gt;{{cite journal | author=Polster, B.M.

Whilst a number of viruses can block the effects of TNF and Fas. For example the M-T2 protein of myxoma viruses can bind TNF preventing it from binding the TNF receptor and inducing a response.&lt;ref name=Hay&gt;{{cite journal

Consequently p53 cannot induce apoptosis since it cannot induce the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins. The adenovirus E1B-55K protein and the [[hepatitis B virus]] HBx protein are examples of viral proteins that can perform such a function.&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wang, X.W.

Interestingly, viruses can remain intact from apoptosis particularly in the latter stages of infection. They can be exported in the ''apoptotic bodies'' that pinch off from the surface of the dying cell and the fact that they are engulfed by phagocytes prevents the initiation of a host response. This favours the spread of the virus.&lt;ref name=Hay&gt;{{cite journal

==Apoptosis in plants==
[[Programmed cell death]] in plants has a number of molecular similarities to animal apoptosis, but it also has differences, notably the presence of a [[cell wall]] and the lack of an [[immune system]] which removes the pieces of the dead cell.  Instead of an immune response, the dying cell synthesizes substances to break itself down and places them in a [[vacuole]] which ruptures as the cell dies.  Whether this whole process resembles animal apoptosis closely enough to warrant using the name ''apoptosis'' (as opposed to the more general ''programmed cell death'') is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://elfosscientiae.cigb.edu.cu/PDFs/BA/2006/23/1/BA002301RV001-010.pdf | title = Programmed cell death in plants resembles apoptosis of animals | author = Cyrelys Collazo, Osmani Chacón, Orlando Borrás | journal = Biotecnología Aplicada | year = 2006 | volume = 23 | pages = 1–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caspase Independent Apoptosis==

There is an extrinsic pathway that has been noticed in several toxicity studies. It was shown that an increase in calcium concentration within a cell, caused by drug activity, also has the ability to cause apoptosis via a calcium-binding [[Calpain|calpain protease]].

==Apoptosis Protein Subcellular Location Prediction==
In 2003, a method was developed for predicting subcellular location of apoptosis proteins &lt;ref&gt;Zhou, G. P. &amp; Doctor, K. (2003). Subcellular location prediction of apoptosis proteins. PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Genetics 50, 44-48.&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequently, various different modes of Chou's [[pseudo amino acid composition]] were developed for improving the quality of predcting subcellular localization of apoptosis proteins based on their sequence information alone.

Common misconception describes anal sex as practiced almost exclusively by [[gay]] men.

==Heterosexual==
===Male to female===
[[File:Anal Intercourse Artwork.jpg|thumb|1892 [[lithograph]] by [[Édouard-Henri Avril|Paul Avril]] depicting male-to-female anal sex]]
Some men may enjoy being the insertive partner in anal sex due to the anus usually being tighter than the vagina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boellstorff&quot;/&gt; The attitude of women towards being the receptive partner in this practice is diverse: while some consider it painful or uncomfortable, others find it pleasurable and some even prefer it to [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal intercourse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taormino&quot;&gt;Tristan Taormino: ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=hLv1ohTIiicC&amp;dq=The+Ultimate+Guide+to+Anal+Sex+for+Women&amp;hl=iw&amp;ei=cdlETbaaKJHG4Absw50Q&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA The Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Women]'', Cleis Press, 1997, 2006.

In a study of hetero anal sex (8/2010 (n=214)), female participants stated that stimulation to multiple erogenous zones simultaneously (the clitoris, the G-Spot, the anus, and other erogenous zones) enabled the woman to enjoy anal intercourse with much less discomfort compared to anal penetration by itself. Women who had orgasms during anal sex reported that an orgasm during anal sex was more of a full-body experience than an orgasm from just clitoral stimulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeCitore&quot;/&gt;

The risk to the woman is greater than the risk to the man during male-to-female anal intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=jY2ENnVdRGEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Gynecological%20Sourcebook&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Gynecological Sourcebook] By M. Sara Rosenthal; p153&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, this act is held to carry a very low risk of unwanted [[human pregnancy|pregnancy]] when not accompanied with vaginal intercourse, as anal intercourse cannot lead to pregnancy unless sperm is somehow transported to the vaginal opening in the process; in some populations, this activity is frequently used as a means of contraception, often in the absence of a condom.&lt;ref&gt;SIECUS ''Prevalence of Unprotected Anal Sex among Teens Requires New Education Strategies&quot;[http://www.sexedlibrary.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Feature.showFeature&amp;featureid=1036&amp;pageid=682&amp;parentid=478] Accessed Jan. 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Female virginity====
Male-to-female anal sex is sometimes seen as preserving female [[virginity]] because, in addition to its non-[[Reproduction|procreative]] nature, it leaves the [[hymen]] intact. Among sexually active heterosexuals, the concept of &quot;[[technical virgin]]ity&quot;, which includes [[oral sex]] and [[mutual masturbation]], is conceived as resting solely on penile-vaginal penetration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author= Frederic C.

====Prevalence====
In 1992, a study conducted by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] found that only 26% of men 18 to 59 and 20% of women 18 to 59 had engaged in heterosexual anal sex; a similar 2005 survey (also conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) found a rising incidence of anal sex relations in the American heterosexual population. The survey showed that 40% of men and 35% of women between 25 and 44 had engaged in heterosexual anal sex.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Mosher, Ph.D.; Anjani Chandra, Ph.D.; and Jo Jones, Ph.D., [http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad362.pdf Sexual Behavior and Selected Health Measures: Men and Women 15–44 Years of Age], U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH &amp; HUMAN SERVICES, Division of Vital Statistics, September 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of overall numbers of survey respondents, seven times as many women as gay men said that they engaged in anal intercourse, with this figure reflecting the larger heterosexual population size.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne-Christine d'Adesky]], ''Expanding Microbicide Research'' in amfAR Global Link – Treatment Insider; May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior]] (NSSHB), although anal intercourse is reported by fewer women than other partnered sex behaviors, partnered women in the age groups between 18-49 are significantly more likely to report having anal sex in the past 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalsexstudy.indiana.edu/ National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB).] Findings from the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, Centre for Sexual Health Promotion, Indiana University. ''[[Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'', Vol. 7, Supplement 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 report entitled ''Prevalence and Correlates of Heterosexual Anal and Oral Sex in Adolescents and Adults in the United States'', published in the Journal of Infectious Disease, a national survey of Family Growth found that 34% men and 30% women reported ever participating in heterosexual anal sex. The percentage of participants reporting heterosexual anal sex was significantly higher among 20- to 24-year-olds and peaked among 30- to 34-year-olds.&lt;ref name=&quot;EroticFlow&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18190267 National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt; Another survey in, 2008, focused on a much younger demographic of teenagers and young adults, aged 15–21. It found that 16% of 1350 surveyed had had this type of sex in the previous 3 months, with condoms being used 29% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/18245402/detail.html#- |title=Bradley Hasbro Children's Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the subject matter, the survey hypothesized the prevalence was probably underestimated.&lt;!-- A direct quote would be preferable here --&gt;

In 2009, Kimberly R. McBride published a clinical report in ''[[The Journal of Sex Research]]'' which stated that changing norms may affect the frequency of heterosexual anal sex behaviors and suggests that there is a role for the ''exotic'' in the sexual repertoires of some heterosexuals&quot; &quot;[F]or a certain number of heterosexuals, anal intercourse is pleasurable, exciting, and perhaps considered more intimate than vaginal sex...&quot;. McBride and her colleagues investigated the prevalence of non-intercourse anal sex behaviors among a sample of men (n=1,299) and women (n=1,919) compared to anal intercourse experience and found that 51% of men and 43% of women had participated in at least one act of oral–anal sex, manual–anal sex, or anal sex toy use.&lt;ref name=&quot;EroticFlow&quot;&gt;[http://www.eroticflow.com Erotic Flow]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heterosexualanal2010&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; McBride and Janssen found that the majority of men (n=631) and women (n=856) who reported heterosexual anal intercourse in the past 12 months were in exclusive, monogamous relationships: 69% and 73%, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;EroticFlow&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heterosexualanal2010&quot; /&gt;

Figures for prevalence can vary amongst different demographics, regions, and nationalities. A 2001 French survey of five hundred female respondents concluded that a total of 29% had engaged in this practice, with one third of these confirming to have enjoyed the experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Les pratiques sexuelles des Françaises |publisher=TNS/Sofres |url=http://www.tns-sofres.com/etudes/pol/030701_sexualite_r.htm |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |language=French| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070429151130/http://www.tns-sofres.com/etudes/pol/030701_sexualite_r.htm| archivedate = April 29, 2007}}Survey carried out by TNS/Sofres in a representative sample of 500 women from 18 to 65 years of age, in April and May, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in a 1999 South Korean survey of 586 women, 3.5% of respondents reported having had this type of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.komci.org/GSResult.php?RID=0074KJA/1999.17.3.177&amp;DT=6 |title=한국여성의 성형태에 대한 연구 (Sexual Behavior of Korean Women) |journal=Daehan Namseong Gwahak Hoeji |volume=17 |year=1999 |pages=177–185 |last=Yi |first=Ung-hoe |last2=Sin |first2=Jong-seong |last3=Choe |first3=Hyeong-gi |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures for the prevalence of sexual behavior can also fluctuate over time. Edward O. Laumann's 1992 survey, reported in ''The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States'', found that about 20% of heterosexuals had engaged in male-to-female anal sex. [[Sexology|Sex researcher]] [[Alfred Kinsey]], working in the 1940s, had found that number to be closer to 40% at the time. More recently, a researcher from the [[University of British Columbia]] in 2005 put the number of heterosexuals who have engaged in this practice at between 30% and 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy sex is all in the talk |publisher=The Georgia Straight |date=May 5, 2005 |url=http://www.straight.com/article/healthy-sex-is-all-in-the-talk |accessdate=June 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Columbia University]]'s health website ''[[Go Ask Alice!]]'': &quot;Studies indicate that about 25 percent of heterosexual couples have had anal sex at least once, and 10 percent regularly have anal penetration.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/0900.html &quot;Not all gay men have anal sex&quot;] Originally Published: May 10, 1996 ~ Last Updated / Reviewed on: October 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevalence====
The prevalence of anal sex among homosexual couples in the West has varied over time. Magnus Hirschfeld, in his 1914 work, ''The Homosexuality of Men and Women'', reported the rate of anal sex among homosexual men surveyed to be 8%, the least favored of all the practices documented.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Percy and John Lauritsen, Review in ''The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review,'' November–December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, some scholars state that oral sex and mutual masturbation are more common than anal stimulation among gay men in long-term relationships,&lt;ref name=WWW.goaskalice/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson and Johnson&quot;/&gt; and that, in general, anal intercourse is more popular among homosexual male couples than among heterosexual couples, but that &quot;it ranks behind oral sex and mutual masturbation&quot; among both sexual orientations in prevalence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weiten&quot;&gt;{{cite book| authors = Wayne Weiten, Margaret A.

The [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), with information published in the
''[[British Medical Journal]]'' (BMJ), states that two thirds of gay men have anal sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin Bell&quot;/&gt; Other sources suggest that roughly three-fourths of gay men have anal sex at one time or another in their lives, with an equal percentage participating as tops and bottoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Underwood&quot;/&gt; A survey in ''[[The Advocate]]'' in 1994 indicated that 46% of gay men preferred to penetrate their partners, while 43% preferred to be the receptive partner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Underwood&quot;/&gt; A survey conducted from 1994 to 1997 in San Francisco by the Stop AIDS Project indicated that over the course of the study, among men who have sex with men, the proportion engaging in anal sex increased from 57.6% to 61.2%.&lt;ref name = &quot;cdc.gov-Rectal&quot;&gt;Center for Disease Control, ''Increases in Unsafe Sex and Rectal Gonorrhea Among Men Who Have Sex With Men – San Francisco, California, 1994–1997''[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwR/preview/mmwrhtml/00056314.htm].

====Pain====
Pain during receptive anal sex is formally known as anodyspareunia.&lt;ref name=Heidelbaugh/&gt; One study found that about 12% of gay men find it too painful to pursue, and concluded that the perception of anal sex as painful is just as likely to be psychologically or emotionally based as it is to be physically based.&lt;ref name=Ritter_Terndrup&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=0sHWnt9WmRsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Handbook+of+affirmative+psychotherapy+with+lesbians+and+gay+men&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I4JVTd38KoK8sAPGt9HSBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Handbook of affirmative psychotherapy with lesbians and gay men] By Kathleen Ritter, Anthony I.

[[Image:Wiki-analoral.png|thumb|left|A woman performing [[anal–oral sex]] on another woman.]]
There is less research on anal sexuality in the lesbian community, and among [[women who have sex with women]] in general, as compared to couples of other sexual orientations, but stimulating the anus for sexual pleasure is stated to be a part of many lesbians' sex lives; the anus can be rimmed — the tongue moved around its edge — stroked or [[Fingering (sexual act)|penetrated with the fingers]] or a [[dildo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Loulan&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author =JoAnn Loulan|title =Lesbian sex|isbn = 0933216130, 9780933216136|publisher=The University of California|year=1984 (Digitized Oct 31, 2008)|pages=309|accessdate=2011-02-03|url=http://books.google.com/?id=bS0EAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Lesbians+and+anal+sex&amp;dq=Lesbians+and+anal+sex}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are lesbians who like anal sex and others &quot;who cannot bear the thought of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harding&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Kat Harding|title=The Lesbian Kama Sutra|isbn = 0312335857, 9780312335854|publisher=Macmillan|year=2006 |pages=144|accessdate=2011-02-03|url=http://books.google.com/?id=m5RkdiYYMBMC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=Lesbians+and+anal+sex#v=onepage&amp;q=Lesbians%20and%20anal%20sex&amp;f=false
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, a non-scientific study (Munson) was conducted of more than 100 members of a lesbian social organization in Colorado. When asked what techniques they used in their last 10 lovemaking sessions, 100% were for kissing, sucking on breasts, and manual stimulation of the clitoris; more than 90% reported French kissing, oral sex, and fingers inserted into the vagina; and 80% reported [[tribadism]]. Lesbians in their 30s were twice as likely as other age groups to engage in anal stimulation (with a finger or dildo).&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt;

Author Tom Boellstorff, when particularly examining anal sex among gay and lesbian individuals in [[Indonesia]], stated, &quot;I have not heard of oral-anal contact or anal penetration as recognized forms of lesbi[an] sexuality but assume they take place.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boellstorff&quot;/&gt; Daniel Villarreal of [[Queerty.com]] suggests that lesbians are better equipped to &quot;teach heterosexual women&quot; about anal sex than gay men are. &quot;Firstly, they're women and anal sex feels different for women. Women lack that Giggity-spot called the prostate, so anal-loving [lesbians] know much more how anal sex feels as a woman than gay men ever could,&quot; he stated. &quot;Most importantly though, women respond better to women. Ladies can approach the issue by discussing trust, communication, sobriety, [[Human papillomavirus|HPV]]-prevention, and knowing your own body.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;queerty.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniel|last=Villarreal|title=Why Lesbians Should Teach Straight Women About Anal Sex|publisher=[[Queerty.com]]|date=April 23, 2010|accessdate=February 3, 211|url=http://www.queerty.com/why-lesbians-should-teach-straight-women-about-anal-sex-20100423/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health risks==
===General===
Anal sex exposes participants to two principal dangers: infections, due to the high number of infectious [[microorganisms]] not found elsewhere on the body, and physical damage to the anus and the rectum due to their vulnerability. It is generally understood that penetration can be painful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dean and Delvin&quot;/&gt; Frequent anal sex is associated with hemorrhoids, anal prolapse, leakage, ano-rectal pain and ulcers and fissures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anal Pain&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AnalHealth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pedclerk&quot;&gt;[http://pedclerk.bsd.uchicago.edu/rectalProlapse.html Rectal Prolapse]&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts say that as social mores ease, more young heterosexuals are engaging in anal sex, a behavior once rarely mentioned in polite circles. And the experimentation, they worry, may be linked to the current increase in sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref&gt;

The high concentration of [[white blood cell]]s around the rectum, together with the risk of cuts to the rectum and that one of the functions of the rectum is to absorb fluid, increases the risk of HIV transmission because the HIV retrovirus reproduces within the immune system's [[T-cells]]/CD4 cells. Use of [[condom]]s and other precautions are a medically recommended way to lessen risk of infections.

===Increased risk of anal cancer===
Anal cancer is relatively rare, accounting for about 1 percent of gastrointestinal malignancies, but as many as 4,000 new cases can be diagnosed within a year in the United States, according to the [[American Cancer Society]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cancer.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=What Are the Risk Factors for Anal Cancer|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|accessdate=April 21, 2010|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_2X_What_are_the_risk_factors_for_Anal_Cancer_47.asp?sitearea| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080115081647/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_2X_What_are_the_risk_factors_for_Anal_Cancer_47.asp?sitearea| archivedate = January 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;www.fhcrc.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, ''Changing Trends in Sexual Behavior May Explain Rising Incidence of Anal Cancer Among American Men and Women|publisher=[[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] (fhcrc.org)|date=July 6, 2004|accessdate=April 21, 2010|url=http://www.fhcrc.org/about/ne/news/2004/07/06/analcancer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cases of anal cancer are related to infection with the [[human papilloma virus]] (HPV).&lt;ref name=cancer.org/&gt;&lt;ref name=www.fhcrc.org/&gt; Anal sex alone does not cause anal cancer; the risk of anal cancer through anal sex is attributed to HPV infection, which is often contracted through unprotected anal sex. The incidence of the disease has jumped 160% in men and 78% in women in the last thirty years, according to a 2004 American study. The increase is attributed to changing trends in sexual behavior (such as a history of multiple sex partners, fifteen or more, or receptive anal sex) and [[smoking]]. If a current smoker, there is a fourfold increase in risk, though independent of other behavioral risk factors, such as sexual activity. Receptive anal sex increases the incidence sevenfold.&lt;ref name=www.fhcrc.org/&gt; Among the female control group studied, 21.5 percent had reported practicing anal sex, a significant increase from a previous case-control study by [[Epidemiology|epidemiologist]] Janet Daling (Ph.D., member of [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center|Fred Hutchinson's Public Health Sciences Division]]) and her colleagues, published in 1987, in which 11 percent of female controls had reported ever having anal sex. This and other studies also indicate that gay or bisexual sex among men is on the rise, which may account for the increase in anal cancer.&lt;ref name=www.fhcrc.org/&gt; &quot;The sharpest increase was among African American men, whose incidence of anal cancer has more than doubled in the past three decades. Black men also had a lower survival rate from the disease.&quot; The study reported that the five-year survival rate for black men with early stage disease was 62 percent as compared to 79 percent for white men with localized cancer. However, the survey also reported that black men were more likely than white men to report having had intercourse with another male in the last year. Regarding all the increases, whether or not sexual practices have changed, Daling, concluded, &quot;[I]t also could be that people are just more likely to discuss their sexual behavior these days.&quot;&lt;ref name=www.fhcrc.org/&gt;

===Physical damage===
Physical damage to the rectum and anus can manifest as generalized ano-rectal trauma, [[anal fissure]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;AnalHealth&quot;/&gt; [[rectal prolapse]], and exacerbating [[hemorrhoid]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pedclerk&quot;/&gt; An insufficient amount of lubricant can make it especially painful or injurious.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.student.com/sexguide_a.php?id=45 Importance of Foreplay] dudeman41465, The Sexuality Guide November 3, 2005.

==Cultural issues==
[[File:Suzuki Harunobu Shunga.jpg|thumb|A [[shunga]] print depicting an older and a younger man]]
Historically, a number of cultures have recorded the practice of anal intercourse between men.

===Ancient and non-Western cultures===
The term &quot;[[Greek love]]&quot; has long been used to refer to the practice, and in modern times, &quot;doing it the Greek way&quot; is sometimes used as [[slang]] for anal sex. However, homosexual anal sex was far from a universally accepted practice in [[Ancient Greece]]. It was the target of jokes in surviving comedies; [[Aristophanes]] mockingly alludes to the practice, claiming that &quot;Most citizens are europroktoi (wide-arsed) now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Eleven-Comediesx46527.html The Eleven Comedies] Aristophanes et al., Part 7 out of 8, retrieved&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pedagogic pederasty]] was an essential element in the education of male youths, these relationships, at least in Athens and Sparta, were expected to steer clear of penetrative sex of any kind. There are very few works of pottery or other art that display anal sex between older men and boys, let alone with adult men. Most such works depict fondling or [[intercrural sex]], which was not condemned for violating and feminizing the boys. Other sources make it clear that the practice was criticized as shameful,&lt;ref&gt;[[Aesop]], &quot;Zeus and Shame&quot; (Perry 109, Chambry 118, Gibbs 528), in ''Fables''&lt;/ref&gt; and seen as a form of [[hubris]].&lt;ref&gt;David Cohen, &quot;Sexuality, Violence, and the Athenian Law of ''Hubris&quot;'' ''Greece and Rome;'' V.38.2 pp171-188&lt;/ref&gt;{{full}}
[[File:Warren Cup BM GR 1999.4-26.1 n1.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] males on the [[Warren Cup]], British Museum]]

In later [[Greek literature#Roman Age|Roman-era Greek poetry]], anal sex became a common topos, represented as taking place with &quot;eligible&quot; youths: those who had attained the proper age but had not yet become adults. Seducing children into the practice was considered very shameful for the adult, and having such relations with a male who was no longer adolescent was considered more shameful for the young male than for the one mounting him. Greek courtesans, or [[hetaera]]e, are said to have frequently practiced heterosexual anal intercourse as a means of preventing pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Miller, &quot;The Practices of Romans 1:26: Homosexual or Heterosexual?&quot; ''Novum Testamentum'' '''37''' 1 (1995): 9. &quot;Heterosexual anal intercourse is best illustrated in Classical vase paintings of hetaerae with their clients, and some scholars interpret this as a form of contraception.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptability of anal sex thus varied with the time-period and the location, as Ancient Greece spanned a long time and stretched over three continents and two major seas.

For a male citizen to take the passive (or receptive) role in anal intercourse was condemned in Rome as an act of ''impudicitia'' (immodesty or unchastity). Free men, however, frequently took the active role with a young slave, known as a ''[[catamite]]'' or ''puer delicatus.'' In fact the Romans thought of anal sex as something specifically &quot;Greek,&quot; although Roman men often availed themselves of their own slaves or others in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Quignard, Pascal (1996) ''Le Sexe et l'effroi''&lt;/ref&gt;{{full}}

In Japan, records (including detailed [[shunga]]) show that at least some men in relationships with other men did engage in penetrative anal intercourse.
[[File:Larcomuseumanalsex.jpg|thumb|Man and woman having anal sex. Ceramic, [[Moche]] Culture. 300&amp;nbsp;C.E. [[Larco Museum]] Collection]]

Evidence suggestive of widespread heterosexual anal intercourse in a pre-modern culture can be found in the erotic vases, or stirrup-spout pots, made by the [[Moche]] people of Peru; in a survey&lt;ref&gt;[[Rafael Larco Hoyle]] and Dr. Francisco Guerra, quoted in Tannahill, Reay (1992) ''Sex in History'', p. 297-298&lt;/ref&gt; of a collection of these pots, it was found that 31 percent of them depicted heterosexual anal intercourse, more by far than any other sex act. Moche pottery of this type belonged to the world of the dead, which was believed to be a reversal of life. Thus the reverse of common practices was often portrayed. The [[Larco Museum]] houses an [http://www.museolarco.org/iep_er.shtml Erotic Gallery] in which this pottery is showcased.

The 19th century anthropologist [[Richard Francis Burton]] theorized that there is a geographical [[Sotadic zone]] wherein penetrative intercourse between men is particularly prevalent and accepted; moreover he was one of the first writers to advance the premise that such an orientation is biologically determined.&lt;ref name=&quot;burton1885&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/burton-te.html |first=Sir Richard Francis |last=Burton |work=&quot;Terminal Essay&quot;, from his translation of The Arabian Nights |title=Section D: Pederasty |year=1885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western cultures===
In many Western countries, anal sex has generally been [[taboo]] since the [[Middle Ages]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Good in Bed Guide to Anal Pleasuring |publisher=Good in Bed Guides |first=Debby |last=Herbenick |isbn=9780984322169 |pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Christian heresy|heretical]] movements were sometimes attacked by accusations that their members practised anal sex among themselves.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} At that time the mainstream Christian clergy was not celibate, but the highest orders of some heretical sects were, leading to rumours that their celibacy was a sign of their attraction to members of the same sex.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The term ''[[buggery]]'' originated in [[medieval]] Europe as an insult used to describe the rumoured same-sex sexual practices of the heretics from a sect originating in [[Bulgaria]], where its followers were called ''[[bogomil]]s''{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}; when they spread out of the country they were called ''buggres'' (from the [[ethnonym]] ''Bulgars'').{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Another term for the practice, more archaic, is &quot;pedicate&quot; from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''pedicare,'' with the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I have derived the word pedicate from the Latin paedicare or [[pedicare]], meaning &quot;to penetrate anally.&quot; in &quot;The Warren Cup: homoerotic love and symposial rhetoric in silver,&quot; Note 6;''The Art Bulletin,'' March, 1999 by John Pollini [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0422/is_1_81/ai_54517307/pg_30]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Renaissance poet [[Pietro Aretino]] advocated the practice in his ''Sonetti Lussuriosi'' (Lust Sonnets).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daileader |first=Celia R. |title=Back Door Sex: Renaissance Gynosodomy, Aretino, and the Exotic |journal=English Literary History |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=303–334 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |date=Summer 2002 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/elh/v069/69.2daileader.pdf |accessdate=April 30, 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While men who engaged in homosexual relationships were generally suspected of engaging in anal sex, many such individuals did not. Among these, in recent times, have been [[André Gide]], who found it repulsive;&lt;ref&gt;Love's Litany By Kevin Kopelson p.62&lt;/ref&gt;{{full}} and [[Noel Coward]], who had a horror of disease, and asserted when young that &quot;I'd never do anything – well the disgusting thing they do – because I know I could get something wrong with me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hoare, ''Noel Coward: A Biography'' p.18&lt;/ref&gt;{{full}}

===In religion===
{{refimprove|section|date=March 2011}}

[[File:Sodoma - Elluin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[François-Rolland Elluin]], ''Sodomites provoking divine wrath'', from ''Le pot-pourri'' (1781)]]
{{See|Sodomy}}
Within the [[Abrahamic religion]]s, anal sex is often condemned under the rubric of &quot;[[sodomy]]&quot;, which could include various other transgressions of a sexual nature, whether with men, women or animals. This idea is vividly brought to life in the popular interpretation of the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], where the people were prone to sexual immorality, and as a result were destroyed. There are conflicting views as to why Sodom was destroyed.

====Judaism====
[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] [[rabbis]] generally believe that anal sex is a form of [[sodomy]], grouped in with other sexual infractions, whether with [[homosexuality|men]], [[heterosexuality|women]], or [[bestiality|animals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Homosexuality: Explaining the Zeitgeist |first=Emmanuel M. |last=Ekwo |year=2010 |publisher=[[AuthorHouse]] |isbn=9781452047614 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity====
In Christian countries, it has often been referred to euphemistically as the ''peccatum contra naturam'' (the sin against nature, after Thomas Aquinas) or ''Sodomitica luxuria'' (sodomitical lusts, in one of Charlemagne's ordinances), or ''peccatum illud horribile, inter christianos non nominandum'' (that horrible sin that among Christians is not to be named).

====Islam====
{{Main|Islamic views on anal sex}}
''Liwat,'' or the sin of Lot's people, is officially prohibited by most Islamic sects. There are parts of the Qur'an which talk about smiting on [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], and this is thought to be a reference to unnatural sex, and so there are [[hadith]] and Islamic laws which prohibit it. Practitioners of anal relations are called ''luti'' and are seen as criminals in the same way that a thief is a criminal, meaning that they are giving in to a universal temptation. Liwat with a woman is known as ''lesser liwat'' and with a man as ''greater liwat.'' &quot;

====Buddhism====
{{See|Sexuality and Buddhism|LGBT topics and Buddhism}}
The most common formulation of Buddhist ethics is the [[The Five Precepts|Five Precepts]].  These precepts take the form of voluntary, personal  undertakings, not divine mandate or instruction. The third of the Precepts is &quot;To refrain from committing [[sexual misconduct]].&quot;&lt;ref name=HIGG&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  However, &quot;sexual misconduct&quot; ([[Sanskrit]]: ''Kāmesu micchācāra'' literally &quot;sense gratifications arising from the 5 senses&quot;&quot;) is subject  to interpretation relative to the social norms of the followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.4ui.com/eart/199eart1.htm |title=Sexual Misconduct – The third Precept |first=Jeffrey |last=Po|work=4ui.com |date= |accessdate=March 22, 2010|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In  fact, Buddhism, in its fundamental form, does not define what is right  and what is wrong in absolute terms for [[Laity|lay followers]]. Therefore the interpretation of  what kinds of sexual activity are acceptable for a [[layman]] is not a religious matter as far  as Buddhism is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;GLBT in World Religions, Sermon by Rev. Gabriele Parks, along with Phil Manos and Bill Weber.[http://www.tpuuf.org/2008/08/03/glbt-in-world-religions/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]] teaches that sensual enjoyment and desire in general, and sexual pleasure in particular, are hindrances  to [[Bodhi|enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Religion and sexuality#Buddhist views of sex and morality]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Buddhist [[monk]]s  and [[nun]]s  of most traditions are expected to refrain from all sexual activity and take [[vows of celibacy]]; lay people, however, are not expected to refrain from any specific form of sexual activity, and there is no concept of sinfulness attaching to sex.

The '''anti-globalization movement''', or '''counter-globalisation movement''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Derrida]] (May 2004) ''[http://mondediplo.com/2004/11/06derrida Enlightenment past and to come]'', speech at the party for 50 years of ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]''&lt;/ref&gt; is critical of the [[globalization]] of [[corporate capitalism]]. The movement is also commonly referred to as the [[global justice movement]],&lt;ref name=DDP&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Della Porta | editor-first = Donatella | editor-link = Donatella Della Porta | title = The Global Justice Movement: Cross-national And Transnational Perspectives | publisher = Paradigm | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-1-59451-305-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[alter-globalization]] movement, anti-corporate globalization movement,&lt;ref name=Juris&gt;{{cite book | last = Juris | first = Jeffrey S. | title =
Networking Futures: The Movements against Corporate Globalization | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 2008 | page = 2 | isbn = 978-0-8223-4269-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or movement against neoliberal globalization.

Participants base their criticisms on a number of related ideas.&lt;ref&gt;No Logo: No Space, No Choice, No Jobs by Canadian journalist Naomi Klein.&lt;/ref&gt; What is shared is that participants stand in opposition to large, [[multi-national corporation]]s having unregulated political power and to the powers exercised through [[trade agreements]] and deregulated financial markets. Specifically, corporations are accused of seeking to maximize profit at the expense of sabotaging work safety conditions and standards, labor hiring and compensation standards, environmental conservation principles, and the integrity of national legislative authority, independence and sovereignty. Recent developments, seen as unprecedented changes in the global economy, have been characterized as &quot;turbo-capitalism&quot; ([[Edward Luttwak]]), &quot;[[market fundamentalism]]&quot; ([[George Soros]]), &quot;casino capitalism&quot; ([[Susan Strange]]),&lt;ref&gt;Strange, Susan: Casino Capitalism. Oxford: Blackwell, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;cancer-stage capitalism&quot; ([[John McMurtry]]), and as &quot;McWorld&quot; ([[Benjamin Barber]]).

Many anti-globalization activists generally call for forms of global integration that better provide [[democratic representation]], advancement of [[human rights]], [[fair trade]] and [[sustainable development]] and therefore feel the term &quot;anti-globalization&quot; is misleading.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Douglas ''[http://www3.fis.utoronto.ca/research/iprp/c3n/CI/DMorris.htm Globalization and Media Democracy: The Case of Indymedia]'' (pre-publication version)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Podobnik, Bruce, ''[http://convention.allacademic.com/asa2003/view_paper_info.html?pub_id=179&amp;part_id1=13161 Resistance to Globalization: Cycles and Evolutions in the Globalization Protest Movement]'', p. 2. Podobnik states that &quot;the vast majority of groups that participate in these protests draw on international networks of support, and they generally call for forms of globalization that enhance democratic representation, human rights, and egalitarianism.&quot; {{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph &amp; Andrew Charlton. 2005. ''Fair Trade for All: How Trade Can Promote Development''. p. 54 n. 23 (writing that &quot;The anti-globalization movement developed in opposition to the perceived negative aspects of globalization. The term 'anti-globalization' is in many ways a misnomer, since the group represents a wide range of interests and issues and many of the people involved in the anti-globalization movement do support closer ties between the various peoples and cultures of the world through, for example, aid, assistance for refugees, and global environmental issues.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology and causes ==
{{Main|Criticisms of globalization}}
Supporters believe that by the late 20th century those they characterized as &quot;ruling elites&quot; sought to harness the expansion of world markets for their own interests; this combination of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] institutions, states, and multinational corporations has been called &quot;[[globalization]]&quot; or &quot;globalization from above.&quot; In reaction, various social movements emerged to challenge their influence; these movements have been called &quot;anti-globalization&quot; or &quot;globalization from below.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Korzeniewicz, Roberto Patricio &amp; Smith, William C., 2001, ''Protest and Collaboration: Transnational Civil Society Networks and the Politics of Summitry and Free Trade in the Americas'', pp. 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition to international financial institutions and transnational corporations ===
Generally speaking, protesters believe that the global financial institutions and agreements undermine local decision-making methods. Corporations exercise privileges that human citizens cannot:
# moving freely across borders,
# extracting desired [[natural resources]], and
# utilizing a diversity of [[human resources]].
They are able to move on after doing permanent damage to the [[natural capital]] and [[biodiversity]] of a nation, in a manner impossible for that nation's citizens. Activists' goals are for an end to the legal status of &quot;[[Juristic person|corporate personhood]]&quot; and the dissolution of [[free market fundamentalism]] and the radical economic privatization measures of the [[World Bank]], [[International Monetary Fund]], and [[World Trade Organization]].
[[File:Antiglob rostock 2 6 07.jpg|thumb|left|Protest against the [[33rd G8 summit|G8-meeting]] in [[Heiligendamm]], 2007.]]

The activists are especially opposed to &quot;globalization abuse&quot; and the international institutions that promote [[neoliberalism]] without regard to ethical standards. Common targets include the [[World Bank]] (WB), [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and [[free trade]] treaties like the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI) and the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS). In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries, movement adherents claim “free trade” without measures in place to protect the environment and the health and well being of workers will contribute only to the strengthening the power of industrialized nations (often termed the &quot;North&quot; in opposition to the developing world's &quot;South&quot;).

A report by [[Jean Ziegler]], [[UN Special Rapporteur]] on the right to food, notes that &quot;millions of farmers are losing their livelihoods in the developing countries, but small farmers in the northern countries are also suffering&quot; and concludes that &quot;the current inequities of the global trading system are being perpetuated rather than resolved under the WTO, given the unequal balance of power between member countries.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, Jean, 2004, [http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/34441bf9efe3a9e3c1256e6300510e24/$FILE/G0410777.pdf ''Economic, social and cultural rights - The right to food''], page 9&lt;/ref&gt; Activists point to the unequal footing and power between developed and developing nations within the WTO and with respect to global trade, most specifically in relation to the protectionist policies towards agriculture enacted in many developed countries. These activists also point out that heavy subsidization of developed nations' agriculture and the aggressive use of export subsidies by some developed nations to make their agricultural products more attractive on the international market are major causes of declines in the agricultural sectors of many developing nations.
[[File:IMF and World Bank protests - damage in Logan Circle.jpg|thumb|[[World Bank]]/[[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] protesters smashed the windows of this [[PNC Financial Services|PNC Bank]] branch located in the [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

Activists often also oppose some business alliances like the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF), the [[Trans Atlantic Business Dialogue]] (TABD) and the [[Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC), as well as the governments which promote such agreements or institutions. Others argue that, if borders are opened to capital, borders should be similarly opened to allow free and legal circulation and choice of residence for migrants and [[refugee]]s. These activists tend to target organizations such as the [[International Organization for Migration]] and the [[Schengen Information System]].

It is often argued that the [[United States]] has a special advantage in the global economy because of [[dollar hegemony]], and that dollar dominance is not just a consequence of US economic superiority. Globalization historians claim that dollar dominance has been achieved also by political agreements such as the Bretton Woods System and OPEC dollar-only [[petroleum]] trade after the US broke with the [[gold standard]] for the dollar.

=== Global opposition to neoliberalism ===
Through the [[Internet]], a worldwide movement began to develop in opposition to the doctrines of [[neoliberalism]] which were manifested on a global scale in the 1990s when the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) proposed liberalisation of cross-border investment and trade restrictions through its [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI). This treaty was prematurely exposed to public scrutiny and subsequently abandoned in November 1998 in the face of strenuous protest and criticism by national and international [[civil society]] representatives.

Neoliberal doctrine argued that untrammeled [[free trade]] and reduction of public-sector regulation would bring benefits to poor countries and to disadvantaged people in rich countries. Anti-globalization advocates urge that preservation of the natural environment, human rights (especially workplace rights and conditions) and democratic institutions are likely to be placed at undue risk by globalization unless mandatory standards are attached to liberalisation. [[Noam Chomsky]] stated in 2002 that
{{quote|The term &quot;globalization&quot; has been appropriated by the powerful to refer to a specific form of international economic integration, one based on investor rights, with the interests of people incidental. That is why the business press, in its more honest moments, refers to the &quot;free trade agreements&quot; as &quot;free investment agreements&quot; (Wall St. Journal). Accordingly, advocates of other forms of globalization are described as &quot;anti-globalization&quot;; and some, unfortunately, even accept this term, though it is a term of [[propaganda]] that should be dismissed with ridicule. No sane person is opposed to globalization, that is, international integration. Surely not the left and the workers movements, which were founded on the principle of international solidarity—that is, globalization in a form that attends to the rights of people, not private power systems.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky Znet May 07, 2002 / The Croatian Feral Tribune April 27, 2002 [http://www.zmag.org/content/TerrorWar/chomskygab.cfm]{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an interview in June, 2005, Chomsky stated,
{{quote|The dominant propaganda systems have appropriated the term &quot;globalization&quot; to refer to the specific version of international economic integration that they favor, which privileges the rights of investors and lenders, those of people being incidental. In accord with this usage, those who favor a different form of international integration, which privileges the rights of human beings, become &quot;anti-globalist.&quot; This is simply vulgar propaganda, like the term &quot;anti-Soviet&quot; used by the most disgusting commissars to refer to dissidents. It is not only vulgar, but idiotic. Take the [[World Social Forum]], called &quot;anti-globalization&quot; in the propaganda system—which happens to include the media, the educated classes, etc., with rare exceptions. The WSF is a paradigm example of globalization. It is a gathering of huge numbers of people from all over the world, from just about every corner of life one can think of, apart from the extremely narrow highly privileged elites who meet at the competing World Economic Forum, and are called &quot;pro-globalization&quot; by the propaganda system. An observer watching this farce from Mars would collapse in hysterical laughter at the antics of the educated classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galerija-rigo.hr/?w=izlozbe&amp;g=4&amp;id=102&amp;sl=147 |title=Interview by Sniježana Matejčić, June 2005 |publisher=Galerija-rigo.hr |date=2005-07-01 |accessdate=2010-09-20|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK1zaUiD |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Anti-war movement ===
By 2002, many parts of the movement showed wide opposition to the impending [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. Many participants were among those 11 million or more protesters that on the weekend of February 15, 2003, participated in global [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|protests against the imminent Iraq war]] and were dubbed the &quot;world's [[second superpower]]&quot; by an editorial in the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60811FD355E0C748DDDAB0894DB404482 Threats and Responses: News Analysis; A New Power In the Streets] (requires purchase to access), The New York Times, Patrick Tyler, February 17, 2003
&lt;/ref&gt; Other anti-war appointments{{Clarify|date=March 2008}} were [[Community organizing|organized]] by the antiglobalization movement as such: see for example the big demonstration against the impending war in Iraq that closed the first [[European Social Forum]] on November 2002 in [[Florence]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/1109-01.htm |title=&quot;Half-A-Million March in Anti-War Rally in Italy&quot;, ''Reuters'', November 9, 2002, Luke Baker |publisher=Commondreams.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK20uY9X |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-globalization militants worried for a proper functioning of democratic institutions as the leaders of many democratic countries ([[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]) were acting against the wishes of the majorities of their populations in supporting the war.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Chomsky asserted that these leaders &quot;showed their contempt for democracy&quot;. Critics of this type of argument have tended to point out that this is just a standard criticism of [[representative democracy]] — a democratically elected government will not always act in the direction of greatest current public support — and that, therefore, there is no inconsistency in the leaders' positions given that these countries are [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracies]].

The [[economics|economic]] and [[war|military]] issues are closely linked in the eyes of many within the movement.

=== Appropriateness of the term ===
Many participants (see Noam Chomsky's quotes above) consider the term &quot;anti-globalization&quot; to be a [[misnomer]]. The term suggests that its followers support [[protectionism]] and/or [[nationalism]], which is not always the case - in fact, some supporters of anti-globalization are strong opponents of both nationalism and protectionism: for example, the [[No Border network]] argues for unrestricted migration and the abolition of all national border controls.

The term &quot;anti-globalization&quot; does not distinguish the international [[left-wing]] anti-globalization position from a strictly nationalist anti-globalization position. Many nationalist movements, such as the [[France|French]] [[National Front (France)|National Front]], are opposed to globalization, but argue that the alternative to globalization is the protection of the [[nation-state]], sometimes, according to critics, in explicitly [[racist]] or [[fascist]] terms. Other groups, influenced by the [[Third Position]], are also classifiable as anti-globalization. However, their overall world view is rejected by groups such as [[Peoples Global Action]] and [[anti-fascist]] groups such as [[ANTIFA]].

Some activists, notably [[David Graeber]], see the movement as opposed instead to [[neoliberalism]] or &quot;[[corporate globalization]]&quot;. He argues that the term &quot;anti-globalization&quot; is a term coined by the media, and that radical activists are actually more in favor of globalization, in the sense of &quot;effacement of borders and the free movement of people, possessions and ideas&quot; than are the IMF or WTO. He also notes that activists use the terms &quot;globalization movement&quot; and &quot;anti-globalization movement&quot; interchangeably, indicating the confusion of the terminology.&lt;ref name=&quot;graeber&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=The New Anarchists | publisher =New Left Review |date=January 2002 | url=http://www.newleftreview.net/NLR24704.shtml|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071219233630/http%3A//www.newleftreview.net/NLR24704.shtml |archivedate = December 19, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;alter-globalization&quot; has been used to make this distinction clear.

While the term &quot;anti-globalization&quot; arose from the movement's opposition to [[free-trade]] agreements (which have often been considered part of something called &quot;[[globalization]]&quot;), various participants contend they are opposed to only certain aspects of globalization and instead describe themselves, at least in French-speaking organisations, as &quot;[[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]]&quot;, &quot;anti-[[plutocracy]],&quot; or &quot;anti-[[corporation|corporate]].&quot; ''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]'' 's editor, [[Ignacio Ramonet]]'s, expression of &quot;the one-way thought&quot; ([[:fr:pensée unique|''la pensée unique'']]) became slang against [[neoliberal]] policies and the [[Washington consensus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ramonet&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=La pensée unique | publisher=Le Monde Diplomatique |date=January 1995 | url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1995/01/RAMONET/1144|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK21qVRY |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main approaches to finding a common term for the movement can be distinguished: one that might be described as &quot;anti-globalist&quot; or &quot;regionalist&quot;, and another that embraces ''some'' aspects of globalization (like cross-cultural exchange of information or the diminishing role of the nation-state) while rejecting others (like neo-liberal economics). While proponents of both approaches often cooperate and are a reaction to the same phenomena, their differences might be actually greater than the common ground. The former approach can be described as outright anti-globalist (usually including what is perceived as &quot;[[Americanization]]&quot; of culture), while the latter would be more appropriately called &quot;globalization critics&quot;. In practice, however, there is no set boundary between these approaches, and the term &quot;anti-globalization&quot; is often indiscriminately applied.

The global justice movement describes the loose collection of individuals and groups—often referred to as a “movement of movements”, which advocate [[fair trade]] rules and are critical of current institutions of global economics such as the World Trade Organization. The movement is often labelled the anti-globalization movement by the [[mainstream media]]. Those involved, however, frequently deny that they are “anti-globalization,” insisting that they support the globalization of communication and people and oppose only the global expansion of [[corporate power]]. The term further indicates an anti-capitalist and universalist perspective on globalization, distinguishing the movement from those opponents of globalization whose politics are based on a conservative defence of national sovereignty. Participants include student groups, [[NGO]]s, [[trade union]]s, faith-based and peace groups throughout the world. However it is clear that the movement is overwhelmingly dominated by [[Northern Hemisphere]] NGOs and that there is a systemic marginalisation of popular organisations from the [[global South]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.

=== Influences ===
[[File:Anti WEF graffiti Lausanne.jpg|thumb|350px|Anti-[[World Economic Forum|WEF]] graffiti in [[Lausanne]]. The writing reads: ''La croissance est une folie'' (&quot;Growth is madness&quot;).]]
Several influential critical works have inspired the anti-globalization movement. ''[[No Logo]]'', the book by the Canadian journalist [[Naomi Klein]] who criticized the production practices of multinational corporations and the omnipresence of brand-driven marketing in [[popular culture]], has become &quot;manifesto&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Gaby. &quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/nov/12/globalisation.politicsphilosophyandsociety Look, no brands...]&quot;, ''The Observer'', November 12, 2000. Retrieved on December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; of the movement, presenting in a simple way themes more accurately developed in other works. In India some intellectual references of the movement can be found in the works of [[Vandana Shiva]], an ecologist and feminist, who in her book ''[[Biopiracy]]'' documents the way that the [[natural capital]] of [[indigenous peoples]] and [[ecoregions]] is converted into forms of [[intellectual capital]], which are then recognized as [[exclusive right|exclusive]] commercial property without sharing the private utility thus derived. The writer [[Arundhati Roy]] is famous for her anti-nuclear position and her activism against India's massive hydroelectric dam project, sponsored by the [[World Bank]]. In France the well-known monthly paper ''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]'' has advocated the antiglobalization cause and an editorial of its director [[Ignacio Ramonet]] brought about the foundation of the association [[ATTAC]]. [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]] of the [[Transnational Institute]] has also been a long-term influence on the movement, as the writer of books since 1986 on hunger, debt, international financial institutions and capitalism. The works of [[Jean Ziegler]], [[Christopher Chase-Dunn]], and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] have detailed underdevelopment and dependence in a world ruled by the capitalist system. Pacifist and anti-imperialist traditions have strongly influenced the movement. Critics of [[United States foreign policy]] such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Susan Sontag]], and anti-globalist pranksters [[The Yes Men]] are widely accepted inside the movement.

Although they may not recognize themselves as antiglobalists and are pro-capitalism, some economists who don't share the neoliberal approach of international economic institutions have strongly influenced the movement. [[Amartya Sen]]'s ''Development as Freedom'' ([[The Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize in Economics]], 1999), argues that third world development must be understood as the expansion of human capability, not simply the increase in national income per capita, and thus requires policies attuned to health and education, not simply GDP. [[James Tobin]]'s (winner of the [[The Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize in Economics]]) proposal for a tax on financial transactions (called, after him, the [[Tobin Tax]]) has become part of the agenda of the movement.

[[George Soros]], [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] (another Economic Sciences Nobel prize winner, formerly of the World Bank, author of [[Globalization and Its Discontents]]) and [[David Korten]] have made arguments for drastically improving [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]], for [[debt relief]], [[land reform]], and restructuring [[corporate accountability]] systems. Korten and Stiglitz's contribution to the movement include involvement in [[direct action]]s and street protest.

High profile events such as the &quot;[[McLibel]]&quot; case have highlighted concern over the effects of multinational corporations on society, labour relations and the environment (in that case the [[McDonald's]] fast food chain).

In some Roman Catholic countries such as [[Italy]] there have been religious influences, especially from missionaries who have spent a long time in the [[Third World]] (the most famous being [[Alex Zanotelli]]).

Internet sources and free-information websites, such as [[Indymedia]], are a means of diffusion of the movement's ideas.
The vast array of material on spiritual movements, [[anarchism]], [[libertarian socialism]] and the [[Green Movement]] that is now available on the Internet has been perhaps more influential than any printed book. The previously obscure works of Arundhati Roy, [[Starhawk]], and [[John Zerzan]], in particular, inspired a critique favoring [[feminism]], [[consensus process]] and [[political secession]].

== Organization ==
[[File:EdinburghProtests5.jpg|thumb|Anti-globalization protests in [[Edinburgh]] during the start of the [[31st G8 summit]].]]

Although over the past years more emphasis has been given to the construction of grassroots alternatives to (capitalist) globalization, the movement's largest and most visible mode of organizing remains mass decentralized campaigns of direct action and civil disobedience. &lt;!-- These often coincide with meetings of organizations they object to. It wasn't us, Guv? Speculation - activists form a spectrum of views --&gt; This mode of organizing, sometimes under the banner of the [[Peoples' Global Action]] network, tries to tie the many disparate causes together into one global struggle.
&lt;!-- In the process, it also helps to focus global attention both on the institutions of global capitalism (whose policies most movement members feel people would object to if they knew about them) as well as bring attention to the movement itself. Rewrite needed. --&gt;
In many ways the process of organizing matters overall can be more important to activists than the avowed goals or achievements of any component of the movement.

At corporate summits, the stated goal of most demonstrations is to stop the proceedings. Although the demonstrations rarely succeed in more than delaying or inconveniencing the actual summits, this motivates the mobilizations and gives them a visible, short-term purpose. Critics claim{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} that this form of publicity is expensive in police time and the public purse. Although not supported by many{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} in the movement, rioting has occurred in Genoa, Seattle and London and extensive damage can be done to the area, especially corporate targets, including [[McDonald's]] and [[Starbucks]] restaurants.

Despite (or perhaps because of) the lack of formal coordinating bodies, the movement manages to successfully organize large protests on a global basis, using [[information technology]] to spread information and organize. Protesters organize themselves into &quot;[[affinity group]]s,&quot; typically non-hierarchical groups of people who live close together and share a common political goal. Affinity groups will then send representatives to planning meetings. However, because these groups can be infiltrated by law enforcement intelligence, important plans of the protests are often not made until the last minute. One common tactic of the protests is to split up based on willingness to break the law. This is designed, with varying success, to protect the risk-averse from the physical and legal dangers posed by confrontations with law enforcement. For example, in [[Prague]] during the [[Anti-globalization Protests in Prague|anti-IMF and World Bank protests in September 2000]] demonstrators split into three distinct groups, approaching the conference center from three directions: one engaging in various forms of civil disobedience (the Yellow march), one (the Pink/Silver march) advancing through &quot;[[tactical frivolity]]&quot; (costume, dance, theatre, music, and artwork), and one (the Blue march) engaging in violent conflicts with the baton-armed police, with the protesters throwing cobblestones lifted from the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Vidal and Kate Connolly in Prague |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/imf/story/0,7369,373703,00.html |title=Barricades burn in battle of Prague |publisher=Guardian |date= 2000-09-27|accessdate=2010-09-20 | location=London|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK23lvLX |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Most police forces of developed nations do not have water cannons --&gt;
These demonstrations come to resemble small societies in themselves. Many protesters take training in first aid and act as medics to other injured protesters. In the USA, some organizations like the [[National Lawyer's Guild]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[ACLU]], provide legal witnesses in case of law enforcement confrontation. Protesters often claim that major media outlets do not properly report on them; therefore, some of them created the [[Independent Media Center]], a collective of protesters reporting on the actions as they happen.

=== Berlin88 ===
The Annual Meetings of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]], that took place in Berlin in 1988 (in the part of the city that was then part of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]), saw strong protests that can be categorized as a precursor of the anti-globalization movement.{{Or|date=April 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-8060341.html| title= LEFTIST RAMPAGE IN BERLIN HAS 53 HURT, 134 ARRESTED| work=The Boston Globe | date=May 3, 1988|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK24qZbo |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main and failed objectives (as it was to be so many times in the future) was to derail the meetings.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daysofdissent.org.uk./berlin.htm |title=&quot;We Will Disrupt This Conference&quot;, ''Days Of Dissent'' |publisher=Daysofdissent.org.uk. |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK25pjXS |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Madrid94 ===
The 50th anniversary of the IMF and the [[World Bank]], which was celebrated in [[Madrid]] in October 1994, was the scene of a protest by an ad-hoc coalition of what would later be called anti-globalization movements. They tried to drown the bankers' parties in noise from outside and held other public forms of protest under the motto &quot;50 Years is Enough&quot;. While Spanish [[King Juan Carlos]] was addressing the participants in a huge exhibition hall, two [[Greenpeace]] activists climbed to the top and showered the bankers with fake dollar bills carrying the slogan &quot;No $s for [[Ozone Layer]] Destruction&quot;. A number of the demonstrators were sent to the notorious [[Carabanchel prison]].

=== J18 ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from 1999 --&gt;
One of the first international anti-globalization protests was organized in dozens of cities around the world on June 18, 1999, with those in [[London]] and [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], [[Oregon]] most often noted. The drive was called the [[Carnival Against Capitalism]], or [[Carnival Against Capitalism|J18]] for short. The protest in Eugene turned into a riot where local [[anarchist]]s drove police out of a small park. One anarchist, [[Robert Thaxton]], was arrested and convicted of throwing a rock at a [[police officer]].

=== Seattle/N30 ===
{{Main|World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity}}

The second major mobilization of the movement, known as N30, occurred on November 30, 1999, when protesters blocked delegates' entrance to WTO meetings in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[United States|USA]]. The protests forced the cancellation of the opening ceremonies and lasted the length of the meeting until December 3. There was a large, permitted march by members of the [[AFL-CIO]], and other unauthorized marches by assorted affinity groups who converged around the Convention Center.&lt;ref&gt;de Armond, Paul, ''Storming Seattle'' &amp; ''Netwar in the Emerald City: WTO Protest Strategy and Tactics''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillham, Patrick F. &amp; Marx, Gary T., 2000, ''Complexity and Irony in Policing and Protest: The World Trade Organization in Seattle''.&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters and Seattle riot police clashed in the streets after police fired [[tear gas]] at demonstrators who blocked the streets and refused to disperse. Over 600 protesters were arrested and thousands were injured.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Orpheus,&quot; ''Battle of Seattle'', part 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Three policemen were injured by [[friendly fire]], and one by a thrown rock. Some protesters destroyed the windows of storefronts of businesses owned or franchised by targeted corporations such as a large [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shop and many [[Starbucks]] windows. The mayor put the city under the municipal equivalent of [[martial law]] and declared a [[curfew]]. As of 2002, the city of Seattle had paid over $200,000 in settlements of lawsuits filed against the [[Seattle Police Department]] for assault and wrongful arrest, with a class action lawsuit still pending.

=== Law enforcement reaction ===
Although local police were surprised by the size of N30, law enforcement agencies have since reacted worldwide to prevent the disruption of future events by a variety of tactics, including sheer weight of numbers, infiltrating the groups to determine their plans, and preparations for the use of force to remove protesters.

At the site of some of the protests, police have used tear gas, pepper spray, concussion grenades, rubber and wooden bullets, night sticks, water cannons, dogs, horses, and occasionally live ammunition to repel the protesters{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. After the November 2000 [[G8]] protest in [[Montreal]], at which many protesters were beaten, trampled, and arrested in what was intended to be a festive protest, the tactic of dividing protests into &quot;green&quot; (permitted), &quot;yellow&quot; (not officially permitted but with little confrontation and low risk of arrest), and &quot;red&quot; (involving direct confrontation) zones was introduced{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.

In [[Quebec City]], municipal officials built a 3&amp;nbsp;metre (10&amp;nbsp;ft) high wall around the portion of the city where the [[Quebec City Summit of the Americas|Summit of the Americas]] was being held, which only residents, delegates to the summit, and certain accredited journalists were allowed to pass through{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.

=== Genoa ===
{{Main|27th G8 summit#Protests}}

The [[Genoa Group of Eight Summit protest]] from July 18 to July 22, 2001 was one of the bloodiest protests in Western Europe's recent history, as evidenced by the wounding of hundreds of policemen and civilians forced to lock themselves inside of their homes and the death of a young Genoese [[anarchist]] named [[Carlo Giuliani]] -- who was shot in the face while trying to throw a fire extinguisher on a police car—during two days of violence and rioting by fringe groups supported by the nonchalance of more consistent and peaceful masses of protesters, and the hospitalisation of several of those peaceful demonstrators just mentioned. Police have subsequently been accused of brutality, torture and interference with the non-violent protests as a collateral damage provoked by the clash between the law enforcement ranks themselves and the more violent and brutal fringes of protesters, who repeatedly hid themselves amongst peaceful protesters of all ages and backgrounds. Several hundred peaceful demonstrators, rioters, and police were injured and hundreds were arrested during the days surrounding the G8 meeting; most of those arrested have been charged with some form of &quot;criminal association&quot; under Italy's anti-[[mafia]] and anti-[[terrorism|terrorist]] laws. No consistent investigation has been put forth against the violent protesters, mainly due to the difficulties encountered in identification of the many masked protesters and the fierce opposition at Congress held by most of the left-wing parties, such as the Communist Party and current PM Romano Prodi's Union coalition.

Eight years have passed, and the city of Genoa is still trying to recover from the many damages provoked by the rioters, mainly devoted to crash cars, setting stores on fire, robbing banks and using any heavy or pointed object as a means to provoke damage to people and objects.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

As part of the continuing investigations, police raids of social centers, media centers, union buildings, and law offices have continued across Italy since the G8 summit in Genoa. Many police officers or responsible authorities present in Genoa during the G8 summit, are currently under investigation by the Italian judges, and some of them resigned.

=== International social forums ===
:''See main articles:'' [[Social forum]], [[European Social Forum]], [[Asian Social Forum]], [[World Social Forum]].

The first World Social Forum (WSF) in 2001 was an initiative of [[Oded Grajew]], [[Chico Whitaker]], and [[Bernard Cassen]]. It was supported by the city of [[Porto Alegre]] (where it took place) and the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Brazilian Worker's Party]]. The motivation was to constitute a counter-event to the [[World Economic Forum]] held in [[Davos]] at the same time. The slogan of the WSF is &quot;Another World Is Possible&quot;. An ''International Council'' (IC) was set up to discuss and decide major issues regarding the WSF, while the local organizing committee in the host city is responsible for the practical preparations of the event.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=3_2&amp;cd_language=2 International Council]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4_1&amp;cd_language=2 |title=Fórum Social Mundial |publisher=Forumsocialmundial.org.br |date=2005-10-26 |accessdate=2010-05-18|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK2Yzw4g |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2001, the IC adopted the World Social Forum Charter of Principles, which provides a framework for international, national, and local Social Forums worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4&amp;cd_language=2 |title=World Social Forum Charter of Principles |publisher=Forumsocialmundial.org.br |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK2ZvbQY |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WSF became a periodic meeting: in 2002 and 2003 it was held again in Porto Alegre and became a rallying point for worldwide protest against the American invasion of Iraq. In 2004 it was moved to [[Mumbai]] (formerly known as Bombay, in [[India]]), to make it more accessible to the populations of Asia and Africa. This appointment saw the participation of 75,000 delegates. In 2006 it was held in three cities: [[Caracas]] ([[Venezuela]]), [[Bamako]] ([[Mali]]), and [[Karachi]] (Pakistan). In 2007, the Forum was hosted in [[Nairobi]] ([[Kenya]]). 2009 the Forum returned to Brazil, where it took place in [[Belém]]. 2011, the Forum is scheduled to take place in [[Dakar]] ([[Senegal]]).

The idea of creating a meeting place for organizations and individuals opposed to Neoliberalism was soon replicated at other geographic scales. The first [[European Social Forum]] (ESF) was held in November 2002 in [[Florence]]. The slogan was &quot;Against the war, against racism and against neo-liberalism&quot;. It saw the participation of 60,000 delegates and ended with a huge demonstration against the war (1,000,000 people according to the organizers). The following ESFs took place in [[Paris]] (2003), [[London]] (2004), [[Athens]] (2006), and [[Malmö]] (2008). The next ESF is scheduled to take place in [[Istanbul]] in 2010.

In many countries Social Forums of national and local scope where also held.

Recently there has been some discussion behind the movement about the role of the social forums. Some see them as a &quot;popular university&quot;, an occasion to make many people aware of the problems of globalization. Others would prefer that delegates concentrate their efforts on the coordination and organization of the movement and on the planning of new campaigns. However it has often been argued that in the dominated countries (most of the world) the WSF is little more than an 'NGO fair' driven by Northern NGOs and donors most of which are hostile to popular movements of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/39464 |title=Pambazuka News |publisher=Pambazuka.org |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2010-09-20|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK2b4Eev |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{See also|Pro-globalization}}
The anti-globalization movement has been criticized by politicians, members of [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[think tank]]s, and many mainstream [[economists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofi.su.se/wp/WP06-7.pdf ] {{Wayback|url=http://www.sofi.su.se/wp/WP06-7.pdf|date =20080625032200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of evidence ===
Critics assert that the empirical evidence does not support the views of the anti-globalization movement. These critics point to statistical trends which are interpreted to be results of globalization, capitalism, and the economic growth they encourage. Specifically, the following are common claims made by globalization advocates to support their view:

* There has been an absolute decrease in the percentage of people in developing countries living below $1 per day in east Asia (adjusted for inflation and purchasing power). Sub Saharan Africa, as an area that felt the consequences of poor governance and was less responsive to globalisation, has seen an increase in poverty while all other areas of the world have seen no change in rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/jsp/index.jsp |title=Welcome to PovcalNet |publisher=Iresearch.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK2dxCfz |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The world income per head has increased by more over period 2002–2007 than during any other period on the record.&lt;ref&gt;''Economics focus: Grossly distorted picture''. [[The Economist]]. March 15, 2008. p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;
* The increase in universal suffrage, from no nations in 1900 to 62.5% of all nations in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=70&amp;release=74 |title=End of Century Survey Finds Dramatic Gains for Democracy |publisher=Freedomhouse.org |date=1999-12-07 |accessdate=2010-09-20|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK2edQkc |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are similar trends for electric power, cars, radios, and telephones per capita as well as the percentage of the population with access to clean water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VC6-4F02KWN-8&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=01%2F01%2F2005&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=full&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_cdi=5946&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_artOutline=Y&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=273c9d354f2f52b3b14606a5a3b2d69f#bfn25 |title=Why Are We Worried About Income?

Members of the anti-globalization movement respond that the pro-globalization slogan, &quot;growth is good for the poor&quot;, is purposefully misleading. They argue that neoliberal policies consistent with globalization and capitalism may not actually be causing growth that has beneficial effects for the poor, or progressing with the urgency the situation requires. They also take issue with the time period which is often normally associated with proponents' arguments such as those cited for life expectancy, child mortality, and literacy above, because they typically include data from periods such as 1950–1975, which were prior to the advent of the neoliberal reforms associated with globalization, and serve to make statistics for globalization seem better than they really are.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Similarly, they note that including positive data from countries which largely ignored neoliberal prescriptions, notably China, discredits the evidence that pro-globalists present. For example, concerning the parameter of per capita income growth, development economist [[Ha-Joon Chang]] writes that considering the record of the last two decades the argument for continuing neo-liberal policy prescriptions are &quot;simply untenable.&quot; Noting that &quot;It depends on the data we use, but roughly speaking, per capita income in developing countries grew at 3% per year between 1960 and 1980, but has grown only at about 1.5% between 1980 and 2000. And even this 1.5% will be reduced to 1%, if we take out India and China, which have not pursued liberal trade and industrial policies recommended by the developed countries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpif.org/pdf/papers/SRtrade2003.pdf ] {{Wayback|url=http://www.fpif.org/pdf/papers/SRtrade2003.pdf|date =20080709044054}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jagdish Bhagwati]] argues that reforms that opened up the economies of China and India contributed to their higher growth in 1980s and 1990s. From 1980 to 2000 their GDP grew at average rate of 10 and 6 percent respectively. This was accompanied by reduction of poverty from 28 percent in 1978 to 9 percent in 1998 in China, and from 51 percent in 1978 to 26 percent in 2000 in India.&lt;ref&gt;Jagdish N. Bhagwati. ''In Defense of Globalization.'' (2004). Oxford University Press. ISBN 978-0-19-517025-2 p.65&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The Heritage Foundation]], development in China was anticipated by [[Milton Friedman]], who predicted that even a small progress towards economic liberalization would produce dramatic and positive effects. China's economy had grown together with its [[economic freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/Research/TradeandForeignAid/upload/wm_1375.pdf wm_1375.fm] {{Wayback|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/TradeandForeignAid/upload/wm_1375.pdf|date =20080626175616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of corporate-led globalization have expressed concern about the methodology used in arriving at the World Bank's statistics and argue that more detailed variables measuring poverty should be studied.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.columbia.edu/~sr793/truth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/trade_2004_11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] (CEPR), the period from 1980–2005 has seen diminished progress in terms of economic growth, life expectancy, infant and child mortality, and to a lesser extent education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/development_2005_09.pdf |title=trade_2004_01_08-1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK2mRYrK |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disorganization ===
One of the most common criticisms of the movement, which does not necessarily come from its opponents, is simply that the anti-globalization movement lacks coherent goals, and that the views of different protesters are often in opposition to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, ''The Multidimensional Crisis and Inclusive Democracy'', ch. 4 ''[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/fotopoulos/english/brbooks/multi_crisis_id/ch4.htm ‘Globalisation’ and the Left]''&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of the movement are also aware of this, and argue that, as long as they have a common opponent, they should march together - even if they don't share exactly the same political vision. Writers [[Michael Hardt]] &amp; [[Antonio Negri]] have together in their books (Empire &amp; Multitude) expanded on this idea of a disunified [[multitude]]: humans coming together for shared causes, but lacking the complete sameness of the notion of 'the people'.

=== Lack of effectiveness ===
One argument often made by the opponents of the anti-globalization movement (especially by ''[[The Economist]]''), is that one of the major causes of poverty amongst third-world farmers are the trade barriers put up by rich nations and poor nations alike. The [[WTO]] is an organisation set up to work towards removing those trade barriers. Therefore, it is argued, people really concerned about the plight of the third world should actually be encouraging free trade, rather than attempting to fight it. People in the third world, they argue, will not take any job unless it is better than the next best option they have. Thus, if people living in the third world are deprived of their best option, their lives have been made worse. While it follows from definition that, other things being equal, a rational person is better off with strictly more options, anti-globalization advocates would likely either reject the assumption of rationality or more likely argue that globalization creates negative externalities (pollution) or alters the marketplace in such a fashion as to eliminate better options (for example, investment encourages assembly line production of products out competing traditional methods). On the other hand globalization advocates would suggest that positive externalities and increased efficiencies create better options for the poor.

Many supporters of capitalism do think that policies different from those of today should be pursued, although not necessarily those advocated by the anti-globalization movement. For example, some see the World Bank and the IMF as corrupt bureaucracies which have given repeated loans to dictators who never do any reforms. Some, like [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando De Soto]], argue that much of the poverty in the Third World countries is caused by the lack of Western systems of laws and well-defined and universally recognized [[property rights]]. De Soto argues that because of the legal barriers poor people in those countries can not utilize their assets to produce more wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Hernando De Soto. ''The Mystery of Capital''. Basic Books. (2003). ISBN 978-0-465-01615-0 p.210-211&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of widespread &quot;Third World&quot; support ===
Critics have asserted that people from poor countries (the [[Third World]]) have been relatively accepting and supportive of globalization while the strongest opposition to globalization has come from wealthy &quot;[[First World]]&quot; activists, unions and NGOs. Alan Shipman, author of &quot;The Globalization Myth&quot; accuses the anti-globalization movement of &quot;defusing the Western class war by shifting alienation and exploitation to developing-country sweatshops.&quot; He later goes on to claim that the anti-globalization movement has failed to attract widespread support from poor and working people from the Third World, and that its &quot;strongest and most uncomprehending critics had always been the workers whose liberation from employment they were trying to secure.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Shipman, Alan &quot;The Globalization Myth&quot; Icon Books, 2002, p. 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

These critics assert that people from the Third World see the anti-globalization movement as a threat to their jobs, wages, consuming options and livelihoods, and that a cessation or reversal of globalization would result in many people in poor countries being left in greater poverty. [[Jesús F. Reyes Heroles]] the former Mexican Ambassador to the US, stated that &quot;In a poor country like ours, the alternative to low-paid jobs isn't well-paid ones, it's no jobs at all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Johan Norberg. ''In Defense of Global Capitalism''. ISBN 978-1-930865-47-1 p.194&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt's Ambassador to the UN has also stated &quot;The question is why all of a sudden, when third world labour has proved to be competitive, why do industrial countries start feeling concerned about our workers? When all of a sudden there is a concern about the welfare of our workers, it is suspicious.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Veseth, Louis Uchitelle. ''The Rise of the Global Economy''. ISBN 978-1-57958-369-9 p. 558&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there have been notable protests against certain globalization policies by Third World workers as in the cause of Indian farmers protesting against patenting seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/pro-ch.htm |title=Indian farmers protest against pro-liberalisation agricultural policy |publisher=Twnside.org.sg |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK2o10S7 |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[John Pilger]] documents Third World anti-globalization movements in his documentary ''Globalization: New Rulers of The World''.

'''Aarau''' is the [[capital (political)|capital]] of the northern [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Aargau]]. The city is also the capital of the district of [[Aarau (district)|Aarau]].  It is [[German language|German]]-speaking and predominantly [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. Aarau is situated on the [[Swiss plateau]], in the valley of the [[Aar]], on the river's right bank, and at the southern foot of the [[Jura mountains]],&lt;ref name=CVDE&gt;Bridgwater, W. &amp; Beatrice Aldrich. (1966) ''The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia''. [[Columbia University]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and is west of [[Zurich]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9003203 Aarau].&quot; ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 20 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The municipality borders directly on the [[Canton of Solothurn]] to the west.  It is the second-largest city in [[Aargau]] after [[Wettingen]].  At the beginning of 2010 [[Rohr, Aargau|Rohr]] became a suburb of Aarau.&lt;ref name=Fusion&gt;[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/infothek/nomenklaturen/blank/blank/gem_liste/03.html Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz] published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office {{de icon}} accessed 14 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and geology==
The old city of Aarau is situated on a rocky outcropping at a narrowing of the Aar river valley, at the southern foot of the Jura mountains.  Newer districts of the city lie to the south and east of the outcropping, as well as higher up the mountain, and in the valley on both sides of the Aar.
The neighboring municipalities are [[Küttigen]] to the north, [[Rohr, Aargau|Rohr]] and [[Buchs, Aargau|Buchs]] to the east, [[Suhr, Aargau|Suhr]] to the south-east, [[Unterentfelden]] to the south, and [[Eppenberg-Wöschnau]] and [[Erlinsbach, Aargau|Erlinsbach]] to the west.
Aarau and the nearby neighboring municipalities have grown together and now form an interconnected [[agglomeration]].  The only exceptions are Unterentfelden and Eppenberg-Wöschnau to the south, whose settlements are divided from Aarau by the expansive forests of Gönhard and Zelgli.
Approximately nine tenths of the city is south of the Aar, and one tenth is to the north.  It has an area, {{as of|2006|lc=on}}, of {{km2 to mi2|8.9|abbr=yes}}.  Of this area, 6.3% is used for agricultural purposes, while 34% is forested.  Of the rest of the land, 55.2% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (4.5%) is non-productive (rivers or lakes).&lt;ref name=SFSO/&gt;  The lowest elevation, {{convert|365|m|ft}}&lt;!--  meters --&gt;, is found at the banks of the Aar, and the highest elevation, at {{convert|471|m|ft}}&lt;!--  meters --&gt;, is the Hungerberg on the border with Küttigen.

==History==
===Prehistory===
[[File:Aarau schloessli.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Schlössli]]
[[File:Aarau rathaus.jpg|thumb|right|150px|City Hall]]
[[File:Aarau stadtkirche.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Town Church Tower]]
[[File:Aarau oberer turm.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Upper Gate Tower]]
A few artifacts from the [[Neolithic]] period were found in Aarau.  Near the location of the present train station, the ruins of a settlement from the [[Bronze Age]] (about 1000 BC) have been excavated.  The Roman road between Salodurum ([[Solothurn]]) and [[Vindonissa]] passed through the area, along the route now covered by the Bahnhofstrasse.  In 1976 divers in the Aar found part of a seven-meter wide wooden bridge from the late Roman times.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Aarau rore-turm.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Rore Tower]]
Aarau was founded around AD 1240 by the counts of [[Kyburg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt;  Aarau is first mentioned in 1248 as ''Arowe''.  Around 1250 it was mentioned as ''Arowa''.  However the first mention of a city sized settlement was in 1256.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt; The town was ruled from the &quot;Rore&quot; tower, which has been incorporated into the modern city hall.

In 1273 the counts of Kyburg died out.  Agnes of Kyburg, who had no male relations, sold the family's lands to King [[Rudolf I]] von [[Habsburg]].  He granted Aarau its city rights in 1283.  In the 14th Century the city was expanded in two stages, and a second defensive wall was constructed. A deep ditch separated the city from its &quot;suburb;&quot; its location is today marked by a wide street named &quot;Graben&quot; (meaning Ditch).

In 1415 Bern invaded lower Aargau with the help of Solothurn.  Aarau capitulated after a short resistance, and was forced to swear allegiance to the new rulers.  In the 16th Century, the rights of the lower classes were abolished.
In March 1528 the citizens of Aarau allowed the introduction of Protestantism at the urging of the Bernese.  A growth in population during the 16th Century led to taller buildings and denser construction methods.  Early forms of industry developed at this time; however, unlike in other cities, no guilds were formed in Aarau.

Starting in the early 18th century, the textile industry was established in Aarau.  German immigration contributed to the city's favorable conditions, in that they introduced the cotton and silk factories.  These highly educated immigrants were also responsible for education reform and the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened]], revolutionary spirit that developed in Aarau.

===1798: Capital of the Helvetic Republic===
On 27 December 1797, the last [[Tagsatzung]] of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] was held in Aarau.  Two weeks later a French envoy continued to foment the revolutionary opinions of the city.  The contrast between a high level of education and a low level of political rights was particularly great in Aarau, and the city refused to send troops to defend the Bernese border.  By Mid-March 1798 Aarau was occupied by French troops.

On 22 March 1798 Aarau was declared the capital of the [[Helvetic Republic]].  It is therefore the first capital of a unified Switzerland.  Parliament met in the city hall.  On 20 September, the capital was moved to [[Lucerne]].

===Aarau as canton capital===
In 1803, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] ordered the fusion of the cantons of Aargau, Baden and Fricktal.  Aarau was declared the capital of the new, enlarged canton of [[Aargau]].  In 1820 the city wall was torn down, with exception of the individual towers and gates, and the defensive ditches were filled in.

The wooden bridge, dating from the Middle Ages, across the Aar was destroyed by floods three times in thirty years, and was replaced with a steel suspension bridge in 1851.  This was replaced by a concrete bridge in 1952.  The city connected to the [[Swiss Central Railway]] in 1856.

The textile industry in Aarau broke down in about 1850 because of the protectionist tariff policies of neighboring states.  Other industries had developed by that time to replace it, including the production of [[mathematical instrument]]s, shoes and cement.  Beginning in 1900, numerous electrical enterprises developed.  By the 1960s, more citizens worked in service industries or for the canton-level government than in manufacturing.  During the 1980s many of the industries left Aarau completely.

In 1802 the Canton School was established; it was the first non-parochial high school in Switzerland. It developed a good reputation, and was home to [[Nobel Prize]] winners [[Albert Einstein]], [[Paul Karrer]], and [[Werner Arber]], as well as several Swiss politicians and authors.

The purchase of a manuscript collection in 1803 laid the foundation for what would become the Cantonal Library, which contains a [[Bible]] annotated by [[Huldrych Zwingli]].  More newspapers developed in the city, maintaining the revolutionary atmosphere of Aarau.  Beginning in 1820, Aarau has been a refuge for political refugees.

The urban educational and cultural opportunities of Aarau have been extended through numerous new institutions.  A Theater and Concert Hall was constructed in 1883, which was renovated and expanded in 1995–96.  The Aargau Nature Museum opened in 1922.  A former cloth warehouse was transformed into a small theater in 1974, and the alternative culture center KIFF (Culture in the fodder factory) was established in a former animal fodder factory.

==Origin of the name==
The earliest use of the place name was in 1248 (in the form Arowe), and probably referred to the settlement in the area before the founding of the city.  It comes, along with the name of the River Aar (which was called Arula, Arola, and Araris in early times), from the German Au, meaning [[floodplain]].

===Old town===
[[File:Aarauer Giebel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Painted Gable]]
The historic old town forms an irregular square, consisting of four parts (called ''Stöcke''). To the south lies the [[Laurenzenvorstadt]], that is, the part of the town formerly outside the city wall.  One characteristic of the city is its painted [[gables]], for which Aarau is sometimes called the &quot;City of beautiful Gables&quot;. The old town, Laurenzenvorstadt, government building, cantonal library, state archive and art museum are all listed as [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage sites of national significance]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The buildings in the old city originate, on the whole, from building projects during the 16th century, when nearly all the Middle Age period buildings were replaced or expanded.  The architectural development of the city ended in the 18th century, when the city began to expand beyond its (still existing) wall.  Most of the buildings in the &quot;suburb&quot; date from this time.

The &quot;Schlössli&quot; (small Castle), Rore Tower and the upper gate tower have remained nearly unchanged since the 13th century.  The &quot;Schlössli&quot; is the oldest building in the city.  It was already founded at the time of the establishment of the city shortly after 1200; the exact date is not known.  City hall was built around Rore Tower in 1515.

[[File:Aarau1612.jpg|thumb|right|View of Aarau from 1612]]
The upper gate tower stands beside the southern gate in the city wall, along the road to Lucerne and Bern.  The jail has been housed in it since the Middle Ages.  A [[Carillon]] was erected in the tower in the middle of the 20th century, the bells for which were provided by the centuries-old bell manufacturers of Aarau.

The town church was built between 1471 and 1478.  During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], in 1528, its twelve altars and accompanying pictures were destroyed.  The &quot;Justice fountain&quot; (Gerechtskeitbrunnen) was built in 1634, and is made of French [[limestone]]; it includes a statue of Lady Justice made of [[sandstone]], hence the name.  It was originally in the street in front of city hall, but was moved to its present location in front of the town church in 1905 due to increased traffic.

==Economy==
[[File:Kunsthaus Aarau.jpg|thumb|right|Kunsthaus Museum]]
{{as of|2007|In 2007}}, Aarau had an unemployment rate of 2.35%.  {{as of|2005}}, there were 48 people employed in the [[Primary sector of the economy|primary economic sector]] and about 9 businesses involved in this sector.  4,181 people are employed in the [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] and there are 164 businesses in this sector.  20,186 people are employed in the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]], with 1,461 businesses in this sector.&lt;ref name=SFSO/&gt;  This is a total of over 24,000 jobs, since Aarau's population is about 16,000 it draws workers from many surrounding communities.  {{as of|2000}} there were 8,050 total workers who lived in the municipality.  Of these, 4,308 or about 53.5% of the residents worked outside Aarau while 17,419 people commuted into the municipality for work.  There were a total of 21,161 jobs (of at least 6 hours per week) in the municipality.&lt;ref name=&quot;ag.ch&quot;&gt;[http://www.ag.ch/staag/ Statistical Department of Canton Aargau-Bereich 11  Verkehr und Nachrichtenwesen] {{de icon}} accessed 21 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest employer in Aarau is the Canton government, the offices of which are distributed across the entire city at numerous locations.  One of the two head offices of the ''[[Aargauer Zeitung]]'', Switzerland's fifth largest newspaper, is located in Aarau, as are the Tele M1 television channel studios, and several radio stations.

[[Kern &amp; Co.]], founded in 1819, was an internationally known [[Geodesy|geodetic]] instrument manufacturer based in Aarau.  However, it was taken over by Wild Leitz in 1988, and was closed in 1991.

More than half of the workers in Aarau live in the city's suburbs, or farther away in the surrounding area.  This leads to a busy rush hour, and regular traffic jams.  Statistically, Aarau has the most jobs per capita of any Swiss city.

The small scale of Aarau causes it to continually expand the borders of its growth.  The urban center lies in the middle of the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; between [[Zurich]], [[Bern]], and [[Basel]], and Aarau is having increasing difficulty in maintaining the independence of its economic base from the neighboring large cities.  The idea of merging Aarau with its neighboring suburbs has been recently discussed in hopes of stopping the slowly progressing losses.

Manufacture include bells, mathematical instruments, electrical goods, cotton textiles, chemicals, shoes, and other products.

===Markets and fairs===
Every Saturday morning there is a vegetable market in the ''Graben'' at the edge of the Old City.  It is supplied with regional products.  In the last week of September the MAG (Market of Aarauer Tradesmen) takes place there, at which regional companies sell their products.  The &quot;Rüeblimärt&quot; is held in the same place on the first Wednesday in November, which is a Carrot fair.  The Aarau fair is held at the ice skating rink during the Spring.

==Transportation==
Aarau is a terminal station of the [[S-Bahn Zürich]] on the line [[S3 (ZVV)|S3]].

==Population==
The population of Aarau grew continuously from 1800 until about 1960, when the city reached a peak population of  17,045, more than five times its population in 1800.  However, since 1960 the population has fallen by 8%.  There are three reasons for this population loss: firstly, since the completion of Telli (a large apartment complex), the city has not had any more considerable land developments.  Secondly, the number of people per household has fallen; thus, the existing dwellings do not hold as many people.  Third, population growth was absorbed by neighboring municipalities in the regional urban area, and numerous citizens of Aarau moved into the countryside.  This trend might have stopped since the turn of the 21st century.  Existing industrial developments are being used for new purposes instead of standing empty.

Aarau has a population (as of {{Swiss populations date|CH-AG}}) of {{Swiss populations|CH-AG|4001}}.{{Swiss populations ref|CH-AG}}  {{as of|2008}}, 19.8% of the population was made up of foreign nationals.&lt;ref name=AG_pop&gt;[http://www.ag.ch/staag/ Statistical Department of Canton Aargau -Bereich 01  -Bevölkerung] {{de icon}} accessed 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the last 10 years the population has grown at a rate of 1%.  Most of the population ({{as of|2000|lc=on}}) speaks German (84.5%), with Italian being second most common ( 3.3%) and Serbo-Croatian being third ( 2.9%).&lt;ref name=SFSO&gt;[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/regionen/regionalportraets/gemeindesuche.html Swiss Federal Statistical Office] accessed 22 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The age distribution, {{as of|2008|lc=on}}, in Aarau is; 1,296 children or 8.1% of the population are between 0 and 9 years old and 1,334 teenagers or 8.4% are between 10 and 19.  Of the adult population, 2,520 people or 15.8% of the population are between 20 and 29 years old.  2,518 people or 15.8% are between 30 and 39, 2,320 people or 14.6% are between 40 and 49, and 1,987 people or 12.5% are between 50 and 59.  The senior population distribution is 1,588 people or 10.0% of the population are between 60 and 69 years old, 1,219 people or 7.7% are between 70 and 79, there are 942 people or 5.9% who are between 80 and 89,and there are 180 people or 1.1% who are 90 and older.&lt;ref name=structure&gt;[http://www.ag.ch/staag/ Statistical Department of Canton Aargau -Bevölkerungsdaten für den Kanton Aargau und die Gemeinden (Archiv)] {{de icon}} accessed 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2000}}, there were 1,365 homes with 1 or 2 persons in the household, 3,845 homes with 3 or 4 persons in the household, and 2,119 homes with 5 or more persons in the household.  The average number of people per household was 1.99 individuals.&lt;ref name=zahlen/&gt;  {{as of|2008|alt=In 2008}} there were 1,594 single family homes (or 18.4% of the total) out of a total of 8,661 homes and apartments.&lt;ref name=AG_data&gt;[http://www.ag.ch/staag/ Statistical Department of Canton Aargau] {{de icon}} accessed 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In Aarau about 74.2% of the population (between age 25–64) have completed either non-mandatory [[Education in Switzerland#Secondary|upper secondary education]] or additional higher education (either University or a ''[[Fachhochschule]]'').&lt;ref name=SFSO/&gt;  Of the school age population ({{as of|2009|alt=in the 2008/2009 school year}}), there are 861 students attending [[Education in Switzerland#Primary|primary school]], there are 280 students attending [[Educat
