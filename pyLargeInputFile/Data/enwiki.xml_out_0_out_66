River development occurred within the structure of the 1909 [[International Boundary Waters Treaty]] between the U.S. and Canada. The [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Rivers and Harbors Act (1925)|Rivers and Harbors Act of 1925]], which directed the Army Corps of Engineers and the [[Federal Power Commission]] to explore the development of the nation's rivers.

The larger U.S. dams are owned and operated by the federal government (some by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] and some by the Bureau of Reclamation), while the smaller dams are operated by [[public utility district]]s, and private power companies. The federally operated system is known as the [[Federal Columbia River Power System]], which includes 31&amp;nbsp;dams on the Columbia and its [[List of tributaries of the Columbia River|tributaries]]. The system has altered the seasonal flow of the river in order to meet higher electricity demands during the winter. At the beginning of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, roughly 75&amp;nbsp;percent of the Columbia's flow occurred in the summer, between April and September. By 1980, the summer proportion had been lowered to about 50&amp;nbsp;percent, essentially eliminating the seasonal pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = National Research Council (U.S.) |title= Managing The Columbia River: Instream Flows, Water Withdrawals, and Salmon Survival |year= 2004 |publisher= National Academies Press |isbn= 0-309-09155-1 |pages= 4, 22 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=uXF5b6syTQ8C |accessdate = 2008-04-03 }} URL is to the [[Google Book Search]] version.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bureau of Reclamation]]'s [[Columbia Basin Project]] focused on the generally dry region of central Washington known as the Columbia Basin, which features rich [[loess]] soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;basinproj&quot;/&gt; Several groups developed competing proposals, and in 1933, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] authorized the Columbia Basin Project. The [[Grand Coulee Dam]] was the project's central component; upon completion, it pumped water up from the Columbia to fill the formerly dry [[Grand Coulee]], forming [[Banks Lake]]. By 1935, the intended height of the dam was increased from a range between {{convert|200|and|300|ft|m}} to {{convert|500|ft|m|}}, a height that would extend the lake impounded by the dam all the way to the Canadian border; the project had grown from a local [[New Deal]] relief measure to a major national project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitzer&quot;/&gt;

The project's initial purpose was [[irrigation]], but the onset of [[World War II]] created a high demand for electricity, mainly for [[aluminum]] production and for the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s at the [[Hanford Site]]. Irrigation began in 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;USNPS&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Dams interrupt the migration of anadromous fish. Salmon and steelhead return to the streams in which they were born to spawn; where dams prevent their return, entire populations of salmon die. Some of the Columbia and Snake River dams employ [[fish ladder]]s, which are effective to varying degrees at allowing these fish to travel upstream. Another problem exists for the juvenile salmon headed downstream to the ocean. Previously, this journey would have taken two to three weeks. With river currents slowed by the dams, and the Columbia converted from wild river to a series of slackwater pools, the journey can take several months, which increases the mortality rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mueller | first=Ted | title=Fire, Faults, and Floods: A Road and Trail Guide Exploring the Origins of the Columbia River Basin | publisher=University of Idaho Press | location=Moscow, Idaho | year=1997 | page=229 | isbn = 978-0-89301-206-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the Army Corps of Engineers transports juvenile fish downstream by truck or river barge. The [[Chief Joseph Dam]] and several dams on the Columbia's tributaries entirely block migration, and there are no migrating fish on the river above these dams. Sturgeon have different migration habits and can survive without ever visiting the ocean. In many upstream areas cut off from the ocean by dams, sturgeon simply live upstream of the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Upper Columbia White Sturgeon | url = http://www.uppercolumbiasturgeon.org/ | publisher = Upper Columbia White Sturgeon Recovery Initiative | year=2007| accessdate = 2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Not all fish have suffered from the modifications to the river; the [[northern pikeminnow]] (formerly known as the ''squawfish'') thrives in the warmer, slower water created by the dams. Research in the mid-1980s found that juvenile salmon were suffering substantially from the predatory pikeminnow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In southeastern Washington, a {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of the river passes through the [[Hanford Site]], established in 1943 as part of the [[Manhattan Project]]. The site served as a [[plutonium]] production complex, with nine [[nuclear reactor]]s and related facilities located on the banks of the river. From 1944 to 1971, pump systems drew cooling water from the river and, after treating this water for use by the reactors, returned it to the river. Before being released back into the river, the used water was held in large tanks known as retention basins for up to six hours. Longer-lived [[isotope]]s were not affected by this retention, and several [[becquerel|terabecquerels]] entered the river every day. By 1957, the eight plutonium production reactors at Hanford dumped a daily average of 50,000&amp;nbsp;[[curie]]s of radioactive material into the Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility | title = Hanford History | date = 2007–2008| url = http://www.wpsr.org/history/ | accessdate = 2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These releases were kept secret by the federal government until the release of declassified documents in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;HHIN&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Hanford Health Information Network |year = 2000 | title = An Overview of Hanford and Radiation Health Effects | url = http://www.doh.wa.gov/hanford/publications/overview/overview.html | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiation was measured downstream as far west as the Washington and [[Oregon]] coasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Radiation Flowed 200 Miles to Sea, Study Finds | work = The New York Times | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0D8173FF934A25754C0A964958260 | date = 1992-07-17 | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have also found significant levels of toxins in fish and the waters they inhabit within the basin. Accumulation of toxins in fish threatens the survival of fish species, and human consumption of these fish can lead to health problems. Water quality is also an important factor in the survival of other wildlife and plants that grow in the Columbia River drainage basin. The states, Indian tribes, and federal government are all engaged in efforts to restore and improve the water, land, and air quality of the Columbia River drainage basin and have committed to work together to enhance and accomplish critical ecosystem restoration efforts.

The Columbia Glaciated ecoregion, making up about a third of the total watershed, lies in the north and was covered with ice sheets during the [[Pleistocene]]. The ecoregion includes the mainstem Columbia north of the Snake River and tributaries such as the Yakima, Okanagan, Pend Oreille, Clark Fork, and Kootenay Rivers. The effects of [[glacier|glaciation]] include a number of large lakes and a relatively low diversity of freshwater fish. The Upper Snake ecoregion is defined as the Snake River watershed above [[Shoshone Falls]], which totally blocks fish migration.

In 2000, about six million people lived within the Columbia's drainage basin. Of this total about 2.4&amp;nbsp;million people lived in Oregon, 1.7&amp;nbsp;million in Washington, 1&amp;nbsp;million in Idaho, half a million in British Columbia, and 0.4&amp;nbsp;million in Montana. Population in the watershed has been rising for many decades and is projected to rise to about 10&amp;nbsp;million by 2030. The highest population densities are found west of the Cascade Mountains along the [[Interstate 5|I-5]] corridor, especially in the Portland-Vancouver urban area. High densities are also found around [[Spokane, Washington]], and [[Boise, Idaho]]. Although much of the watershed is rural and sparsely populated, areas with recreational and scenic values are growing rapidly.

To the east, in northern Wyoming and Montana, the [[Continental Divide]] separates the Columbia watershed from the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]-[[Missouri River|Missouri]] watershed, which empties into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. To the northeast, mostly along the southern border between British Columbia and [[Alberta]], the Continental Divide separates the Columbia watershed from the [[Nelson River|Nelson]]-[[Lake Winnipeg]]-[[Saskatchewan River|Saskatchewan]] watershed, which empties into [[Hudson Bay]]. The Mississippi and Nelson watersheds are separated by the [[Laurentian Divide]], which meets the Continental Divide at [[Triple Divide Peak (Montana)|Triple Divide Peak]] near the headwaters of the Columbia's [[Flathead River]] tributary. This point marks the meeting of three of North America's main drainage patterns, to the Pacific Ocean, to Hudson Bay, and to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;watershed-map&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Watersheds (map) | publisher = Commission for Environmental Cooperation | year = 2006 | url = http://www.cec.org/naatlas/img/NA-Watersheds.gif  | accessdate = 2008-09-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080227060842/http://www.cec.org/naatlas/img/NA-Watersheds.gif |archivedate = 2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gonzalez&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Continental Divides in North Dakota and North America | work = North Dakota Geological Survey Newsletter | last = Gonzalez | first = Mark A. | year = 2003 | url = https://www.dmr.nd.gov/ndgs/NEWSLETTER/NLS03/pdf/Divide.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further north along the Continental Divide, a short portion of the combined Continental and Laurentian divides separate the Columbia watershed from the [[MacKenzie River|MacKenzie]]-[[Slave River|Slave]]-[[Athabasca River|Athabasca]] watershed, which empties into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The Nelson and Mackenzie watersheds are separated by a divide between streams flowing to the Arctic Ocean and those of the [[List of Hudson Bay rivers|Hudson Bay watershed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Atlas of Canada: Drainage Basins | url = http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/national/drainbasins/referencemap_image_view | publisher = Natural Resources Canada | year= 2007 | accessdate = 2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This divide meets the Continental Divide at [[Snow Dome (Canada)|Snow Dome]] (also known as Dome), near the northernmost bend of the Columbia River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

To the southeast, in western Wyoming, another divide separates the Columbia watershed from the [[Colorado River|Colorado]]-[[Green River (Utah)|Green]] watershed, which empties into the [[Gulf of California]]. The Columbia, Colorado, and Mississippi watersheds meet at Three Waters Mountain in the [[Wind River Range]] of {{nowrap|Wyoming.&lt;ref name=&quot;triple-divides&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Triple Divide Points of North America |last = Andersen |first = Robert N. | year = 2007 | url = http://www.uwec.edu/andersrn/Triple_Divide_Pts.htm | accessdate = 2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} To the south, in Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming, the Columbia watershed is divided from the [[Great Basin]], whose several watersheds are [[endorheic basin|endorheic]], not emptying into any ocean but rather drying up or sinking into [[sump]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;watershed-map&quot;/&gt; Great Basin watersheds that share a border with the Columbia watershed include [[Harney Basin]], [[Humboldt River]], and [[Great Salt Lake]].&lt;ref name=&quot;watershed-map&quot;/&gt; The associated triple divide points are Commissary Ridge North, Wyoming,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite peakbagger |pid=5429 |name=Commissary Ridge North, Wyoming}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sproats Meadow Northwest, Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite peakbagger |pid=3248 |name=Sproats Meadow Northwest, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the north, mostly in British Columbia, the Columbia watershed borders the [[Fraser River]] watershed. To the west and southwest the Columbia watershed borders a number of smaller watersheds that drain to the Pacific Ocean, such as the [[Klamath River]] in Oregon and California and the [[Puget Sound]] Basin in Washington.&lt;ref name=&quot;watershed-map&quot;/&gt;

===Major tributaries===
{{see also|List of tributaries of the Columbia River}}[[Image:Deschutes River.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A relatively small river winds through a series of sparsely vegetated brown hills under a nearly cloudless blue sky. The river and the low hills are in shade, while the hilltops and a large hillside in the foreground are sunlit.| [[Deschutes River (Oregon)|Deschutes River]] at its confluence with the Columbia]]
The Columbia receives more than 60&amp;nbsp;significant [[tributary|tributaries]]. The four largest that empty directly into the Columbia (measured either by [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] or by size of watershed) are the [[Snake River]] (mostly in [[Idaho]]), the [[Willamette River]] (in northwest Oregon), the [[Kootenay River]] (mostly in British Columbia), and the [[Pend Oreille River]] (mostly in northern Washington and Idaho, also known as the lower part of the [[Clark Fork (river)|Clark Fork]]). Each of these four averages more than {{convert|20000|cuft/s|m3/s}} and drains an area of more than {{convert|20000|mi2|km2}}.

The Snake is by far the largest tributary. Its watershed of {{convert|108000|mi2|km2}} is larger than the state of Idaho. Its discharge is nearly equal (about 46.5%) to the Columbia's at the rivers' confluence. Compared to the Columbia above the confluence, the Snake is longer (113%), and its drainage basin is larger (104%).

The Pend Oreille river system (including its main tributaries, the Clark Fork and Flathead rivers) is also similar in size to the Columbia at their confluence. Compared to the Columbia River above the two rivers' confluence, the Pend Oreille-Clark-Flathead is nearly as long (about 86%), its basin about three-fourths as large (76%), and its discharge over a third (37%).&lt;ref name=&quot;wdr2007us&quot;&gt;Calculated mainly with data from: {{cite web|url=http://wdr.water.usgs.gov/wy2007/search.jsp|title=Water-resources data for the United States, Water Year 2007|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commelinales''' is the [[botanical name]] of an order of [[flowering plant]]s. It's considered that the Commelinales together with [[Zingiberales]] evolved in the [[Late Cretaceous]] around 80 million years ago. Two of the best-known genera in the order are ''[[Commelina]]'' and ''[[Tradescantia]]''.

In the [[APG II system]], of 2003, the order is placed in the clade [[commelinids]], in the [[monocots]], and comprises the families [[Commelinaceae]] (the spiderwort family, about 650 species), [[Haemodoraceae]] (about 75 species of mostly southern hemisphere plants), [[Hanguanaceae]] (two species of tropical Asian plants), [[Philydraceae]] (five species of tropical Asian plants) and [[Pontederiaceae]] (about three dozen species of aquatic plants including [[water hyacinth]]). This represents a change from the [[APG system]], of 1998, which had not included family Hanguanaceae in this order.

In the [[Cronquist system]], of 1981, this order was placed in subclass [[Commelinidae]] of class [[Liliopsida]] and copmrised the families [[Commelinaceae]], [[Mayacaceae]], [[Rapateaceae]] and [[Xyridaceae]].

'''''Cyperales''''' is a name for an order of [[flowering plants]].  As used in the [[Engler system]] (update, of 1964) and in the [[Wettstein system]] it consisted of only the single family. In the [[Cronquist system]] it is used for an order (placed in subclass ''[[Commelinidae]]'') and circumscribed as (1981):

* order ''Cyperales''
*: family ''[[Cyperaceae]]''
*: family ''[[Poaceae]]'' (or ''Gramineae'')

The [[APG II system]], used here, assigns the plants involved to the order ''[[Poales]]''.

The '''Cucurbitales''' are an order of [[flowering plant]]s, included in the [[rosid]] group of [[dicotyledon]]s. This order mostly belongs to tropical areas, with limited presence in subtropic and temperate regions. The order includes various shrubs and trees, together with many herbs and climbers. One of major characteristics of the Cucurbitales is the presence of unisexual flowers, mostly [[pentacyclic]], with thick pointed petals (whenever present) (Matthews and Endress, 2004). The pollination is usually performed by insects, but [[Anemophily|wind pollination]] is also present (in [[Coriariaceae]] and [[Datiscaceae]]).

The order consists of roughly 2300 species in seven families. The largest families are [[Begoniaceae]] (begonia family) with 1400 species and [[Cucurbitaceae]] (gourd family) with 825 species. The large families of Cucurbitales include several economically important plants. Specifically, the Cucurbitaceae (gourd family} are responsible for some food species, such as [[squash (fruit)|squash]], [[pumpkin]] (both from ''[[Cucurbita]]''), [[melons|melon]] including [[watermelon]] (''Citrullus vulgaris''), and [[cucumber]] (''[[Cucumis]]''). The Begoniaceae are known for their horticultural species, of which there are over 130. 

==Classification==
Under the [[Cronquist system]], the first four families (including [[Begoniaceae]], [[Cucurbitaceae]], and [[Datiscaceae]]),were placed in the order [[Violales]], within the Dilleniidae, with the Tetramelaceae subsumed within the Datiscaceae.  The other families were distributed throughout various orders. The present classification is due to [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group|APG II (2003)]].

'''Contra dance''' (also '''contradance''', '''contra-dance''' and other variant spellings) refers to several [[partner dance|partnered]] [[folk dance]] styles in which couples dance in two facing lines. Sometimes described as [[New England]] folk dance, contra dances can be found around the world, though they are especially popular in [[North America]].

==History==
At the end of the 17th century, [[English country dance]]s were taken up by French dancers; hybrid choreographies exist from this period using the steps from [[Baroque dance|French court dance]] in [[England|English]] dances. The French called these dances ''contra-dance'' or ''contredanse''. As time progressed, English country dances were spread and reinterpreted throughout the Western world, and eventually the French form of the name came to be associated with the American folk dances, especially in New England (this Frenchified name change may have followed a contemporary misbelief that the form was originally French).&lt;ref&gt;

: ''(as access to the OED online is not free, the relevant excerpt is provided)'' &quot;Littré's theory, that there was already in 17th c. a French ''contre-danse'' with which the English word was confused and ran together, is not tenable; no trace of the name has been found in French before its appearance as an adaptation of the English. But new dances of this type were subsequently brought out in France, and introduced into England with the Frenchified form of the name, which led some Englishmen to the erroneous notion that the French was the original and correct form, and the English a corruption of it.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Contra dances were fashionable in the United States until the early to mid-19th century, when they were supplanted in popularity by [[square dance]]s (such as the [[quadrille]] and [[Les Lanciers|lancers]]) and couple dances (such as the [[waltz]] and [[polka]]). By the late 19th century, square dances too had fallen out of favor, except in rural areas. When squares were revived (around 1925 to 1940, depending on the region), contra dances were generally not included. In the 1930s and 1940s, contra dances appear to have been done only in small towns in widely scattered parts of northeastern North America, such as [[Ohio]], the [[Maritime provinces]] of Canada, and particularly northern New England. [[Ralph Page]] almost single-handedly maintained the New England tradition until it was revitalized in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly by [[Ted Sannella]] and [[Dudley Laufman]]. 

By then, early dance camps, retreats, and weekends had emerged, such as [[Pinewoods Dance Camp|Pinewoods Camp]], in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]], which became primarily a music and dance camp in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinewoods.org/pciHistory.shtml Pinewoods Camp History]&lt;/ref&gt; and NEFFA, the [[New England Folk Festival]], also in Massachusetts, which began in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neffa.org/history.html NEFFA History]&lt;/ref&gt; These and others continue to be popular and some offer other dancing and activities besides contra dancing.

In the 1970s, Sannella introduced [[contra dance choreography|heys and gypsies]] from [[English Country Dance]] to the contra dances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/~winston/ecd/gmurrow.htmlx how figures like heys and gypsies got into modern contradancing]&lt;/ref&gt; New dances, such as ''Shadrack's Delight'' by [[Tony Parkes (caller)|Tony Parkes]], featured symmetrical dancing by all couples. (Previously, the actives and inactives —see ''Progression'' below— had significantly different roles). Double progression dances, popularized by Herbie Gaudreau,&lt;ref&gt;Gaudreau, Herbie ''Modern Contra Dancing'' Sandusky, OH: Square Dance Magazine, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; added to the aerobic nature of the dances, and one caller, [[Gene Hubert]], wrote a quadruple progression dance, ''Contra Madness''. Becket formation was introduced, with partners next to each other in the line instead of opposite. The [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]] Dawn Dance started in 1976, and continues to run semiannually.&lt;ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, Tod Whittemore started the first Saturday dance in the [[Peterborough, New Hampshire|Peterborough]] Town House, which remains one of the more popular regional dances.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.monadnockfolk.org/?page_id=30 Peterborough Contra Dance]
&lt;/ref&gt; As musicians and callers moved to other locations, they founded contra dances in Michigan, Washington, California, Texas, and elsewhere.

Gender-free contra dancing started in the 1970s, with the Boston Lesbian and Gay Folk Dance as perhaps the first group regularly contra dancing without gender roles. In 1981, a group in Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN, called &quot;Les be Gay and Dance&quot; was started, in which contra dance was done without any reference to gender, avoiding calling moves with any reference to &quot;ladies&quot; or &quot;gents.&quot; In 1987, Chris Ricciotti started a gay dance group in Providence, RI, using the terms &quot;ladies&quot; and &quot;gents&quot; although dancers were not lining up according to gender. Other gender-free dance groups started up in the area after that, and in 1989, at the gender-free dance group in Jamaica Plain, MA, a group of dancers led by Janet Dillon protested the use of these terms, and the armband system was devised: the traditionally male-role dancers would wear armbands and be called &quot;armbands&quot; or just &quot;bands,&quot; and the traditionally female-role dancers would be called &quot;bare arms&quot; or just &quot;bares.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lcfd.org/Articles/GFManual/GF-Manual.pdf |title= Welcome to Gender-Free Dancing! |accessdate= 2009-02-24 |author= Chris Ricciotti |year= 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.lcfd.org Lavender Country and Folk Dancers] organization now serves as an umbrella organization for dances in Massachusetts, New York, Georgia, and California. Gender-free philosophy can be used almost anywhere conventional traditional dances are currently being held. It is useful for community dances where “keeping on the correct side” is difficult because of a large gender imbalance, for children’s dances and for groups who want to add a little variety and a creative learning experience to their traditional dance venue.

==Events==
[[Image:ContraDanceCambridgeVFW.agr.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Thursday night contra dance at the Fresh Pond Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].]]
Contra dance events are open to all, regardless of experience. They are [[family-friendly]], and [[alcohol]] consumption is not part of the culture. Many events offer beginner-level instructions for up to half an hour before the dance. A typical evening of contra dance is three hours long, including an intermission. The event consists of a number of individual ''contra dances'', divided by a scattering of other partner dances, perhaps one or more [[waltz]]es, [[schottische]]s, [[polka]]s, or Swedish [[hambo]]s. In some places, [[square dance]]s are thrown into the mix. Music for the evening is typically performed by a live band, playing [[jig]]s and [[reel (dance)|reels]] from [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Canada]], or the [[United States|USA]]. The tunes are [[traditional music|traditional]] and more than a century old, or modern compositions which follow the same form as the traditional pieces. (See &quot;Music&quot;, below.)

Generally, a leader, known as a [[caller (dance)|caller]], will teach each individual dance just before the music for that dance begins. During this introductory &quot;walk-through&quot; period, participants learn the dance by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller's instructions. The caller gives the instructions orally, and sometimes augments them with demonstrations of steps by experienced dancers in the group. The walk-through usually proceeds in the order of the moves as they will be done with the music; in some dances, the caller may vary the order of moves during the dance, a fact that is usually explained as part of the caller's instructions. 

After the walk-through, the music begins and the dancers repeat that sequence some number of times before that dance ends, often 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the length of the contra lines. Calls are normally given at least the first few times through, and often for the last. At the end of each dance, the dancers thank their partners. The contra dance tradition in North America is to change partners for every dance, while in the United Kingdom typically people dance with the same partner the entire evening. One who attends an evening of contra dances in North America does not need to bring his or her own partner. In the short break between individual dances, women and men invite each other to dance. Booking ahead (lining up a partner or partners ahead of time for each individual dance), while common at some venues, is often discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bobarcher.org/dance/uk_us_comparison.html English / American dancing - a comparison]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musaique.com/contradance/articles/kevra-letter.html Susan Kevra's Letter to the Greenfield Contra Dancers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gainesnet.com/booking.htm Dance Community Hospitality]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ravitz.us/dance/call.php Notes on Calling Contra Dances]&lt;/ref&gt;

At most dances, no special outfits are worn, but &quot;peasant skirts&quot; or other full, lightweight skirts are popular, as these have a very pretty effect when swinging or twirling and some dancers —including some men&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qccd.org/skirts.html Queen City Contra Dancers] ''Men in Skirts'' FAQ page&lt;/ref&gt;— find them more comfortable to dance in than pants. Low, broken-in, soft-soled, non-marking shoes, such as dance shoes, sneakers, or sandals, are recommended and, in some places, required. However, dancing barefoot is also common.

As in any social dance, cooperation is vital to contra dancing. Since over the course of any single dance, individuals interact with not just their partners but everyone else in the set, contra dancing might be considered a group activity. As will necessarily be the case when beginners are welcomed in by more practiced dancers, mistakes are made; most dancers are very willing to help beginners, and will often go out of their way to give extra instructions to help them learn the steps.

==Form==
{{main|Contra dance form}}

===Formations===
[[Image:Contra dance sets.gif|thumb|300px|right|Contra dance sets, seen from the balcony of the town house of [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Although most people think a municipal hall is always called &quot;town hall,&quot; there is a long tradition of calling the building with town offices the &quot;town house&quot; as Peterborough calls their municipal building. [http://www.townofpeterborough.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B492C637A-0E03-496F-A4D5-FF976BE0148B%7D Peterborough NH: Town House Rentals, Park Rentals &amp; Tent Rentals]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Contra dances are arranged in long paired lines of couples. A pair of lines is called a ''set''. Sets are generally arranged so they run the length of the hall, with the ''top'' or ''head'' of the set being the end closest to the band and caller. Correspondingly, the ''bottom'' or ''foot'' of the set is the end farthest from the caller.

Couples consist of two people, traditionally but not necessarily one male and one female, referred to as the gent, gentleman or man, and lady or woman. 

Couples interact primarily with an adjacent couple for each round of the dance. Each sub-group of two interacting couples is known to choreographers as a ''minor set'' and to dancers as a ''foursome'' or ''hands four''. Couples in the same minor set are ''neighbors''. Minor sets originate at the head of the set, starting with the topmost dancers as the 1's (the ''active couple'' or ''actives''); the other couple are ''2's'' (or ''inactives''). The 1's are said to be ''above'' their neighboring 2's; 2's are ''below''. If there is an uneven number of couples dancing, the bottom-most couple will ''wait out'' the first time through the dance.

There are three common ways of arranging dancers in the minor sets: ''proper'' formation, ''improper'' formation, and ''Becket'' formation. There are many additional forms a contra dance may take. Five of them are: ''triple minor'', ''triplet'', ''indecent'', ''four-face-four'', and ''whole-set''. (For diagrams and full descriptions, see [[Contra dance form|Contra Dance Form]] main article.)

===Progression===
A fundamental aspect of contra dancing is that the same dance, one time through which lasts roughly 30 [[second]]s, is repeated over and over - but each time you dance with new neighbors. This change is effected by ''progressing'' the 1's ''down'' the set and progressing the 2's ''up'' (also ''up the hall'' and ''down the hall''; see Contra Dance Form main article for full characterizations of the progression in the eight dance forms mentioned above).

A single dance runs around ten minutes, long enough to progress 15-20 times. If the sets are short to medium length the caller will often try to run the dance until each couple has danced with every other couple both as a 1 and a 2 and returned to where they started. With longer sets (more than ~40 people) this would require long enough sets that the caller will usually only run the dance all the way around on (rare) non equal-turn dances.

==Choreography==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[English Country Dance]] --&gt;
{{main|Contra dance choreography}}
Contra dance [[choreography]] specifies the dance formation, the ''figures'', and the sequence of those figures in a dance. Notably, contra dance figures (with a few exceptions) do not have defined footwork; within the limits of the music and the comfort of their fellow dancers, individuals move according to their own taste.

Most contra dances consist of a sequence of about six to 12 individual figures, prompted by the [[Caller (dance)|caller]] in time to the [[music]] as the figures are danced. As the sequence repeats, the caller may cut down his or her prompting, and eventually drop out, leaving the dancers to each other and the music. 

A '''figure''' is a pattern of movement that typically takes eight ''counts'', although figures with four or 16 counts are also common. Each dance is a collection of figures assembled to allow the dancers to progress along the set (see &quot;Progression,&quot; above).

A '''count''' (as used above) is one half of a [[bar (music)|musical measure]], such as one quarter note in 2/4 time or three eighth notes in 6/8 time. A count may also be called a ''step'', as contra dance is a walking form, and each count of a dance typically matches a single physical step in a figure.

Typical contra dance choreography comprises four '''parts''', each 16 counts (8 measures) long. The parts are called A1, A2, B1 and B2. This nomenclature stems from the music: Most contra dance tunes (as written) have two parts (A and B), each 8 measures long, and each fitting one part of the dance.  The A and B parts are each played twice in a row, hence, A1, A2, B1, B2. While the same music is generally played in, for example, parts A1 and A2, distinct choreography is followed in those parts. Thus, a contra dance is typically 64 ''counts'', and goes with a 32 ''measure'' tune. Tunes of this form are called &quot;square&quot;; tunes that deviate from this form are called &quot;crooked&quot;. Crooked tunes are more commonly used in [[square dance|square dancing]], where the phrasing of the dance does not have to align as closely with the phrasing of the music.

Sample contra dances:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/contradance/index/by_title.html Michael Dyck's Country Dance Index]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Traditional - the actives do most of the movement
:''Chorus Jig'' (Proper duple minor)
::A1 (16) Actives down the outside and back. [The inactives stand still or substitute a swing]
::A2 (16) Actives down the center, turn individually, come back, and cast off. [The inactives stand still for the first 3/4, take a step up the hall, and then participate in the cast]
::B1 (16) Actives turn contra corners. [The inactives participate in half the turns]
::B2 (16) Actives meet in the middle for a balance and swing, end swing facing up. [The inactives stand still]
::'''Note:''' inactives will often clog in place or otherwise participate in the dance, even though the figures do not call for them to move.
* Modern - the dance is symmetrical for actives and inactives
:''Hay in the Barn'' by Chart Guthrie (Improper duple minor)
::A1 (16) Neighbors balance and swing.
::A2 (8) Ladies chain across, (8) Half hey, ladies pass right shoulders to start.
::B1 (16) Partners balance and swing.
::B2 (8) Ladies chain across, (8) Half hey, ladies pass right shoulders to start.

==Music==
The most common contra dance repertoire is rooted in the Anglo-Celtic tradition as it developed in North America. [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Scottish music|Scottish]], [[French-Canadian music|French Canadian]], and [[Old-time music|Old-time]] tunes are common, and [[Klezmer]] tunes have also been used. The old-time repertoire includes very few of the jigs common in the others.

Tunes used for a contra dance are nearly always &quot;square&quot; 64-beat tunes, in which one time through the tune is each of two 16-beat parts played twice (this is notated AABB). However, any 64-beat tune will do; for instance, three 8-beat parts could be played AABB AACC, or two 8-beat parts and one 16-beat part could be played AABB CC. Tunes not 64 beats long are called &quot;crooked&quot; and are almost never used for contra dancing, although a few crooked dances have been written as novelties.

Until the 1970s it was traditional to play a single tune for the duration of a contra dance (about 5 to 10 minutes). Since then, contra dance musicians have typically played tunes in sets of two or three related (and sometimes contrasting) tunes, though single-tune dances are again becoming popular with some northeastern bands. In the Celtic repertoires it is common to change keys with each tune. A set might start with a tune in G, switch to a tune in D, and end with a tune in Em. Here, D is related to G as its dominant (5th), while D and Em (dorian) share a key signature of two sharps. In the old-time tradition the musicians will either play the same tune for the whole dance, or switch to tunes in the same key. This is because the tunings of the banjo are key-specific. An old-time band might play a set of tunes in D, then use the time between dances to retune for a set of tunes in A. (Fiddlers also may take this opportunity to retune; tune- or key-specific fiddle tunings are uncommon in American Anglo-Celtic traditions other than old-time.)

In the Celtic repertoires it is most common for bands to play sets of reels and sets of jigs. However, since the underlying beat structure of jigs and reels is the same (two &quot;counts&quot; per bar) bands will occasionally mix jigs and reels in a set.

In recent years, younger contra dancers have begun establishing &quot;crossover contra&quot; or &quot;techno contra&quot; - contra dancing to techno, hip-hop, and other modern forms of music. While challenging for DJs and callers, the fusion of contra patterns with moves from hip-hop, tango, and other forms of dance has made this form of contra dance a rising trend since 2008; it has become especially prevalent in Asheville, NC, but regular techno contra dance series are spreading up the East Coast to locales such as Charlottesville, VA and Washington, DC.

{{Numismatics}}

'''Coin collecting''' is the [[collecting]] or trading of [[coins]] or other forms of [[minted]] [[legal tender]].

Coins of interest to collectors often include those that [[Circulation (currency)|circulated]] for only a brief time, coins with [[mint error]]s and especially beautiful or historically significant pieces. Coin collecting can be differentiated from [[numismatics]] in that the latter is the systematic study of [[currency]]. Though closely related, the two disciplines are not necessarily the same. A numismatist may or may not be a coin collector and vice versa.

==History==
 [[File:Francken II, Frans - Art Room (detail) - 1636.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Ancient coins feature among the artworks owned by a 17th century collector in this oil painting by [[Frans Francken the Younger]] (''The Art Room'', 1636).]]

People have [[hoarding|hoarded]] coins for their [[bullion]] value for as long as coins have been minted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Origins of Coinage:The earliest coin hoard |url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/themes/money/the_origins_of_coinage.aspx|date= |work=The British Museum:Explore/Money, www.britishmuseum.org|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the collection of coins for their [[artistic]] value was a later development. There is evidence from the [[archaeological record|archaeological]] and [[historical record]] of [[Ancient Rome]] and medieval [[Mesopotamia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/124774/coin-collecting. www.britannica.com]. Retrieved 14 December 2010. Quote: &quot;The Nestorian scholars and artisans who served the princes of the Jazira (Mesopotamia, now Iraq, Syria, and Turkey) in the 12th and 13th centuries designed a magnificent series of coins with motifs based on ancient Greek and Roman issues. Some of these so accurately render the details of the originals that even the inscriptions are faithfully repeated. Others were modified in intriguing ways. [...] The great variety and the sophisticated use of these images reveal the existence of well-studied collections.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; that coins were collected and catalogued by scholars and state treasuries. It also seems probable that individual citizens collected old, exotic or commemorative coins as an affordable, portable form of art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coin Collecting&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Coin Collecting|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/124774/coin-collecting|date= |work=Britannica Online, www.britannica.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to  [[Suetonius]] in his ''De vita Caesarum'' (''The Lives of the Twelve Caesars''), written in the first century [[Current Era|CE]], the emperor [[Augustus]]  would sometimes present old and exotic coins to friends and courtiers during festivals and other special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Tranquillus, C. Suetonius, ''The Lives of the Twelve Caesars'', (1 CE) Section LXXV, http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6387/6387.txt Retrieved 23 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary coin collecting and appreciation began around the fourteenth century. During the [[Renaissance]] coin collecting became a [[fad]] among some members of the privileged classes. The Italian scholar and poet [[Petrarch]] is credited with being the pursuit's first and most famous aficionado.  Following his lead, many European kings, princes, and other nobility kept collections of ancient coins. Some of notable collectors were [[Pope Boniface VIII]], [[Emperor Maximilian]]{{dn}} of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Louis XIV]] of France, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], [[Henry IV of France]] and [[Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg|Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg]], who started the [[Berlin Coin Cabinet]] (German: ''Münzkabinett Berlin''). Perhaps because only the very wealthy could afford the pursuit, in Renaissance times coin collecting became known as the &quot;Hobby of Kings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Coin Collection History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Coin Collection History |url=http://www.coincollectingalbum.com/coin-collecting-history.html |date= |work=www.coincollectingalbum.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brief History of Coin Collecting |url=http://www.2-clicks-coins.com/article/coin-collecting-history.html |date= |work=www.2-clicks-coins.com|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coin Collectors: Emperor Maximilian |url=http://www.zoomcoin.com/rare-coin-article/coin-collectors-emperor-maximilian/|date= |work=www.zoomcoin.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th and 18th centuries coin collecting remained a pursuit of the well-to-do. But rational, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking led to a more systematic approach to accumulation and study.  Numismatics as an academic discipline emerged in these centuries, at the same time as coin collecting became a leisure pursuit of a growing [[middle class]], eager to prove their wealth and sophistication. During the 19th and 20th centuries, coin collecting increased further in popularity.  The market for coins expanded to include, not only antique coins, but foreign or otherwise exotic currency. Coins shows, trade associations and regulatory bodies emerged during these decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coin Collecting&quot;/&gt; The first international convention for coin collectors was held August 15&amp;ndash;18, 1962, in [[Detroit, Michigan]], and was sponsored by the [[American Numismatic Association]] and the [[Royal Canadian Numismatic Association]]. Attendance was estimated at 40,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Coin Collection History&quot;/&gt; As one of the oldest and most popular world pastimes, coin collecting is now often referred to as the &quot;King of Hobbies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coin Collecting|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A672013|date= |work= BBC:H2G2, www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brief History of Coin Collecting |url=http://www.2-clicks-coins.com/article/coin-collecting-history.html |date= |work=www.2-clicks-coins.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations for coin collecting==
The motivations for collecting are varied.  Possibly the most common type of collector is the hobbyist, who amasses a collection purely for fun with no real expectation of profit. This is especially true of casual collectors and children who collect items on the basis of chance and personal interest.

Another frequent reason for purchasing coins is as an investment. As with [[Philatelic investment|stamps]], [[precious metals]] or other commodities, coin prices are cyclical based on [[supply and demand]]. Prices drop for coins that are not in long-term demand, and increase along with a coin's perceived or intrinsic [[value (economics)|value]].  Investors buy with the expectation that the value of their purchase will increase over the long term. As with all types of investment, the principle of ''[[caveat emptor]]'' applies and study is recommended before buying. Likewise, as with most collectibles, a coin collection does not produce income until it is sold, and may even incur costs (for example, the cost of [[safe deposit box]] storage) in the interim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collecting And Investing In Coins&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Collecting And Investing In Coins|url= http://www.oldandsold.com/articles02/coincollecting15.shtml|date= |work=www.oldandsold.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coin hoarders may be similar to investors in the sense that they accumulate coins for potential long-term profit. However, unlike investors, they typically do not take into account aesthetic considerations; rather they gather whatever quantity of coins they can and hold them. This is most common with coins whose [[bullion|metal value]] exceeds their spending value.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coin Hoards&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Coin Hoards | url=http://www.australian-threepence.com/blog/2009/07/coin-hoards.html |date= |work=www.australian-threepence.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculators, be they amateurs or commercial buyers, generally purchase coins in bulk and often act with the expectation of short-term profit.  They may wish to take advantage of a spike in demand for a particular coin (for example, during the annual release of [[Royal Canadian Mint Numismatic Coins (2000s)|Canadian numismatic collectibles]] from the [[Royal Canadian Mint]]).  The speculator might hope to buy the coin in large lots and sell at profit within weeks or months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collecting And Investing In Coins&quot;/&gt; Speculators may also buy common circulation coins for their intrinsic metal value.  Coins without collectible value may be melted down or distributed as bullion for commercial purposes. Typically they purchase coins that are composed of rare or precious metals, or coins that have a high purity of a specific metal.&lt;ref name=&quot;What is a Coin Collector&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=What is a Coin Collector? |url=http://www.2-clicks-coins.com/article/what-is-a-coin-collector.html |date= |work=www.2-clicks-coins.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A final type of collector is the inheritor, an accidental collector who acquires coins (a collection, hoard or investment) from another person as part of an [[inheritance]]. The inheritor may not necessarily have an interest in or know anything about numismatics at the time of the acquisition.&lt;ref name=&quot;What is a Coin Collector&quot;/&gt;

==Collector types==
Casual coin collectors often begin the hobby by saving notable coins found by chance. These coins may be pocket change left from an international trip or an old coin found in circulation.

Usually, if the enthusiasm of the novice increases over time, random coins found in circulation are not enough to satisfy their interest.  The hobbyist may then trade coins in a coin [[club]] or buy coins from dealers or mints. Their collection takes on a more specific focus.

Some enthusiasts become ''generalists'' and accumulate a few examples from a broad variety of historical or geographically significant coins. Given enough resources, this can result in a vast collection. [[King Farouk]] of Egypt was a generalist with a collection famous for its scope and variety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=
Numismatic &quot;Gumshoe:&quot; On the Trail of King Farouk |url=http://www.goldrushgallery.com/news/gumshoe.html|first=Carl N. |last= Lester|work= www.goldrushgallery.com|accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most collectors decide to focus their financial resources on a narrower, ''specialist'' interest. Some collectors focus on coins of a certain nation or historic period.  Others will seek [[Mint-made errors|error coins]]. Still others might focus on [[exonumia]] such as [[currency]], [[Token coin|tokens]] or [[challenge coin]]s. For example, [[John Yarwood]] of Melbourne is the first person to take a serious interest in British military money (especially tokens).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cockington|first=James|title=Tokens of our affection|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|page=Money supplement (p. 13)|date=2009-03-11|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/money/planning/tokens-of-our-affection/2009/03/09/1236447130062.html|accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some collectors are ''completists'' and seek an example of every type of coin within a certain category. Perhaps the most famous of these is [[Louis Eliasberg]], the only collector thus far to assemble a complete set of known [[United States coinage|coins of the United States]].

Coin collecting can become a [[competition|''competitive'']] activity, as prompted by the recent emergence of PCGS ([[Professional Coin Grading Service]]) and NGC ([[Numismatic Guarantee Corporation]]) [[Registry Sets]]. Registry Sets are private collections of coins verified for ownership and quality by [[Coin grading|numismatic grading]] services. The grading services assess collections, seal the coins in clear plastic holders, then register and publish the results. This can lead to very high prices as dedicated collectors compete for the very best specimens of, for example, each date and [[mint mark]] combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PCGS Set Registry |url=http://www.pcgs.com/setregistry/|date= |work=www.pcgs.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NGC Collectors Society |url=http://coins.www.collectors-society.com/registry/coins/public_sets.aspx|date= |work=www.ngccoin.com  |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common collection themes==
A few common themes are often combined into a goal for a collection:

[[File:Lk-colonialcoins.jpg|thumb|left|Some colonial coins of [[Ceylon]].]]

*''Country collections'': Many enthusiasts focus their collection on only a single country—often their own.  In contrast, some collectors attempt to obtain a sample from every country that has issued a coin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coin Collecting Themes-One From Every Country |url= http://www.australian-threepence.com/blog/2009/01/coin-collecting-themes-one-from-every-country.html |date= |work= www.australian-threepence.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Year collections'': Rather than being satisfied with a single specimen of a type, a great many collectors collect type by year; for example, one [[Penny (U.S. coin)|Memorial Lincoln Cent]] for every year from 1959 (the year it was first minted) to present. This is perhaps one of the most practical ways to collect a national currency since probably the majority of coin reference books and coin albums catalogue in the same manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=7 Popular Coin Collecting Themes |url= http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art55473.asp  |first= Gary |last= Eggleston|work=www.bellaonline.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Mint mark collections'': Many collectors consider different [[mint mark]]s significant enough to justify representation in their collection.  When collecting coins by year, this multiplies the number of specimens needed to complete a collection. Some mint marks are more common than others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coin Collecting Themes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Coin Collecting Themes |url=http://coinandstampcollecting.articlehq.net/Coin-Collecting-Themes.html  |date= |work=http://coinandstampcollecting.articlehq.net |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Variety collections'': Because mints generally issue thousands or millions of any given coin, they use multiple sets of [[coin die]]s to produce the same coin. Occasionally these dies have slight differences. This was more common on older coins because the coin dies were hand carved.  But differences—intentional or accidental—still exist on coins today. Generally this is in a very small detail, such as the number of leaves on the ear of corn on the recent US Wisconsin [[state quarter]] [[:File:2004 WI Proof.png]].&lt;ref name=&quot;coincollecting101.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Coin Collecting: Common Coin Collecting Themes|url= http://www.coincollecting101.com/coin-collecting/coin-collecting-2/8 |date= |work=www.coincollecting101.com|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Type collections'': Often a collection consists of an examples of major design variants for a period of time in one country or region. For example,  [[Euro coin]]s carry a &quot;common side&quot; that shows the denomination and a &quot;national side&quot; that varies in design from state to state within the [[Eurozone]].  Likewise, a type collection might focus on an unusual design feature such as coins with a hole in the middle, coins that are not circular in shape or coins with [[brockage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=7 Popular Coin Collecting Themes |url= http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art55473.asp  |first= Gary |last =Eggleston|work=www.bellaonline.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Composition collections'': For some, the [[metallurgical]] composition of the coin itself is of interest. For example, a collector might collect only [[bimetallic coins]]. Precious metals like gold, silver, copper and platinum are of frequent interest to collectors, but enthusiasts also pursue historically significant pieces like the [[1943 steel cent]] or the [[1974 aluminum cent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;coincollecting101.com&quot;/&gt;

 [[File:Eagle coins.jpg|thumb|left|Coins featuring eagles.]]

*''Subject collections'': Collectors with an interest in a certain subject (such as, ships or eagles) may collect only coins depicting that interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coin Collecting Themes&quot;/&gt;

*''Period collections'': Collectors may restrict themselves to coins of the 18th or 19th century, while others collect ancient and medieval coins. Coins of [[Roman currency|Roman]], [[Byzantine currency|Byzantine]], [[Greek coins|Greek]] origin are amongst the more popular ancient coins collected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldsborough 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=  Counterfeit Coin Detection|url=  http://rg.ancients.info/guide/counterfeits.html|year=2008 |work= |first= Reid |last= Goldsborough|accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some collect coins minted during a particular ruler's reign or a representative coin from each ruler. Collectors may also take interest in money issued during the administration of a historically significant bureaucrat such as a [[central bank]] governor, [[treasurer]] or finance secretary. For example, [[Reserve Bank of India]] governor [[James Braid Taylor]] presided over the country's move from [[silver currency]] to [[fiat money]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Governors|url= http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/governors.aspx|date= |work=Reserve Bank of India: India's Central Bank, www.rbi.org.in |publisher= |accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coins reflect the events of the time in which they are produced, so coins issued during historically important periods are especially interesting to collectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;coincollecting101.com&quot;/&gt;

*''Printed value collections'': A currency collection might be modeled around the theme of a specific printed value, for example, the number 1. This collection might include specimens of the US 1 [[Dollar (United States coin)|dollar coin]], the Canadian [[Loonie]], the [[1 euro coins|Euro]], 1 [[Indian Rupee]] and 1 [[Singapore dollar]].

*''Volume collections ([[Hoards]])'': Collectors may have an interest in acquiring large volumes of a particular coins (e.g., as many pennies as they can store). These usually are not high-value coins, but the interest is in collecting a large volume of them either for the sake of the challenge, as a store of value, or in the hope that the intrinsic metal value will increase.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coin Hoards&quot;/&gt;

Collecting counterfeits and forgeries is a controversial area because of the possibility that counterfeits might someday reenter the coin market as authentic coins, but US statutory and case law do not explicitly prohibit possession of counterfeit coins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldsborough 2008&quot;/&gt;

==Coin condition and value==
In coin collecting, the condition of a coin is paramount to its value; a high-quality example is often worth many times more than a poor example. Collectors have created [[coin grading|systems]] to describe the overall condition of coins.

In the early days of coin collecting—before the development of a large international coin market—extremely precise grades were not needed.  Coins were described using only three adjectives: &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fine&quot; or &quot;uncirculated&quot;. By the mid 20th century, with the growing market for rare coins, the [[William Herbert Sheldon|Sheldon]] system was adopted by the [[American Numismatic Association]] and most coin professionals in the North America. It uses a 1&amp;ndash;70 numbering scale, where 70 represents a perfect specimen and 1 represents a barely identifiable coin. The Sheldon Scale  uses descriptions and numeric grades for coins (from highest to lowest) is as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Grading&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Grading |url=http://www.slatercoins.com/main/page_grading_history.html |year= 2008|work=www.slatercoins.com |publisher=Slater Numismatics, LLC |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grading U.S. Coins|url=http://www.coin-gallery.com/cggradingart.htm  |author=Mitch Hight |work=www.coin-gallery.com|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngccoin.com/coingrading/grading2.asp|work=NGC Grading, www.ngccoin.com|title=Grading|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deutsche Mark Anaglyph 1.jpg|thumb|This [[Deutsche Mark]] coin shows blemishes and rim dents that would detract from its grade in appraisal.]]

* Mint State (MS) 60–70: Uncirculated (UNC)
* About/Almost Uncirculated (AU) 50, 53, 55, 58
* Extremely Fine (XF or EF) 40, 45
* Very Fine (VF) 20, 25, 30, 35
* Fine (F) 12, 15
* Very Good (VG) 8, 10
* Good (G) 4, 6
* About Good (AG) 3
* Fair (FA, FR) 2
* Poor (PR, PO) 1

While the Sheldon Scale is universally acknowledged, coin experts in Europe and elsewhere often shun the numerical system, preferring to rate specimens on a purely descriptive, or [[Adjective|adjectival]], scale. Nevertheless, most grading systems use similar terminology and values and remain mutually intelligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Collectors Stick With Verbal Grading System  |url=http://www.pcgs.com/articles/article_view.chtml?artid=1470&amp;universeid=105&amp;type=1   |date=September 20, 1999 |work=Professional Coin Grading Service, www.pcgs.com|first=Alan |last= Herbert |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=German Coin Grading |url=http://www.germancoins.com/grading.html  |year=2009 |work= www.germancoins.com|first= Ron |last= Guth|accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Grading Standards|url=http://www.fleur-de-coin.com/articles/grade_standards.html  |date= |work=www.fleur-de-coin.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:pcgs-rattler-front.jpg|thumb|An early PCGS slab.]]

When evaluating a coin, the following—often subjective—factors may be considered: 1) &quot;eye appeal&quot; or the aesthetic interest of the coin; 2) dents on the rim; 3) unsightly scratches or other blemishes on the surface of the coin; 4) [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]]; 5) [[Lightness (color)|toning]]; 6) level of detail retained, where a coin with full details obviously is valued higher than one with worn details. If the coin is judged favorably in all of these criteria, it will generally be awarded a higher grade.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Grading&quot;/&gt;

Damage of any sort (e.g., holes, edge dents, repairs, cleaning, re-engraving or gouges) can substantially reduce the value of a coin. Specimens are occasionally cleaned or polished in an attempt to pass them off as higher grades or as uncirculated strikes. Because of the substantially lower prices for cleaned or damaged coins, some enthusiasts specialize in their collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Can Damaged Coins Find A Home? |url= http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art52620.asp  |first= Gary |last= Eggleston|work=www.bellaonline.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coin grading services===

[[Coin grading]] services are a relatively recent phenomenon,  having emerged in the 1980s as a response to the need for buyers and sellers to agree on common measures of a coin's value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coin Grading Systems - The History of Coin Grading Scales |url=http://coins.about.com/od/coingrading/a/grading_systems.htm |date= |work= |publisher=About.com |accessdate=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Official grading is an effort to bring more confidence to investors in rare coins. Grading services certify the authenticity and rate the quality of individual coins, thus—it is hoped—establishing the worth of the coin relative to all others of its kind. Many coin grading services will also seal coins in a labeled, air-tight plastic holder, ensuring the coin is protected from deterioration. This process is commonly known as [[coin slabbing]] and is most prevalent in the US market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Rare Coin Grading |url=http://goldinfo.net/morabgrad1.html |date= |work= |publisher=Austin Gold Information Network |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;coin-collecting-guide-for-beginners.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Coin Grading Services: Who They Are and What They Do |url=http://www.coin-collecting-guide-for-beginners.com/coin-grading-services.html|date= |work=www.coin-collecting-guide-for-beginners.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While professional grading has reduced the number of [[Counterfeit money|counterfeits]] foisted upon investors and has improved buyer confidence substantially, the goal of creating a sight-unseen market for coins remains somewhat elusive.  Professional grading services remain the subject of controversy because grading is ultimately subjective; coins may receive different grades by different services or even upon resubmission to the same service. Due to potentially large differences in value over slight differences in a coin's condition, some commercial coin dealers will repeatedly resubmit a coin to a grading service in the hope of a higher grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Companion to Rare Coin Collecting - Grading Services |url=http://www.mycoincollecting.com/rare-coins/companion-rare-coin-collecting-Part4.html  |date= |work= www.mycoincollecting.com|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, grading services are not free, and by using them collectors funnel money into an ancillary aspect of the hobby, instead of purchasing additional material for their collections.

The two most prominent grading services at present are the [[Numismatic Guaranty Corporation]] (NGC) and the [[Professional Coin Grading Service]] (PCGS).&lt;ref name=&quot;coin-collecting-guide-for-beginners.com&quot;/&gt; The least reputable coin dealers have a growing tendency to sell higher graded coins via sales pitches claiming that grading removes subjectivity as to the value of mint state coins. Dealers that sponsor infomercials on [[shortwave]] radio are notorious for such sales pitches, most notably Discount Gold &amp; Silver Trading on [[WWCR]].

'''Crokinole''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|r|oʊ|k|ɨ|n|oʊ|l}} {{respell|KROHK|i-nohl}}) is an action [[board game]] similar in various ways to [[pitchnut]], [[carrom]], [[marbles]], and [[shove ha'penny]], with elements of [[shuffleboard]] and [[curling]] reduced to table-top size. Players take turns shooting discs across the circular playing surface, trying to have their discs land in the higher-scoring regions of the board, while also attempting to knock away opposing discs.

== Equipment ==
Board dimensions vary with a playing surface typically of polished wood or laminate approximately {{convert|27|in|mm}} in diameter. The arrangement is 3 concentric rings worth 5, 10, and 15 points as you move in from the outside. There is a shallow 20-point hole at the center. The inner 15-point ring is guarded with 8 small bumpers or posts. The outer ring of the board is divided into four quadrants. The outer edge of the board is raised a bit to keep errant shots from flying out, with a gutter between the playing surface and the edge to collect discarded pieces. Crokinole boards are typically octagonal or round in shape. The discs are roughly [[Draughts|checker]]-sized, slightly smaller in diameter than the board's central hole, and often have concave faces to reduce sliding friction. Alternatively, the game may be played with ring-shaped pieces with a central hole.

=== Powder ===
The use of any lubricating powder in crokinole is controversial, with some purists reviling the practice. 

Powder is used to ensure pieces slide smoothly on the surface. According to Carrom rules, the powder must be of high quality to keep the surface smooth and dry, and shall not wet. Pouches and containers are used to spread the powder over the playing surface. There must be no impurity in the powder. [[Boric acid]] powder is mostly used for this purpose.

In the UK, many players use a version of [[anti-set-off spray powder]], from the printing industry, which has specific [[electrostatic]] properties, with particles of 50-micrometre diameter ({{convert|0.001|mm|in|disp=output only}}). The powder is made of pure food-grade plant/vegetable starch.

==Gameplay==
Crokinole is most commonly played by two players, or by four players in teams of two, with partners sitting across the board from each other. Players take turns flicking their discs from the outer edge of their quadrant of the board onto the playfield. Shooting is usually done by flicking the disc with a finger, though sometimes small [[cue stick]]s may be used. If there are any enemy discs on the board, a player must make contact, directly or indirectly, with an enemy disc during the shot. If unsuccessful, the shot disc is &quot;fouled&quot; and removed from the board, along with any of the player's other discs that were moved during the shot.

When there are no enemy discs on the board, many (but not all) rules also state that a player must shoot for the centre of the board, and a shot disc must finish either completely inside the 15-point guarded ring line, or (depending on the specifics of the rules) be inside or touching this line. This is often called the &quot;no hiding&quot; rule, since it prevents players from placing their first shots where their opponent must traverse completely though the guarded centre ring to hit them and avoid fouling. When playing without this rule, a player may generally make any shot desired, and as long as a disc remains completely inside the outer line of the playfield, it remains on the board. During any shot, any disc that falls completely into the recessed central &quot;20&quot; hole is removed from play, and counts as twenty points for the owner of the disc at the end of the round, assuming the shot is valid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aubrey&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Aubrey | first = Irene Elizabeth | title = Sports and Games in Canadian Children's Books | publisher = National Library of Canada | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-662-51763-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Bell | first = R. C. | authorlink = Robert Charles Bell | title = Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations | year = 1979 | publisher = Dover Publications |isbn = 0-486-23855-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scoring occurs after all pieces (generally 12 per player or team) have been played, and is differential: i.e., the player or team with higher score is awarded the difference between the higher and lower scores for the round, thus only one team or player each round gains points. Play continues until a predetermined winning score is reached.

==History of the game==
The earliest known crokinole board was made by craftsman Eckhardt Wettlaufer in 1876 in [[Perth County, Ontario|Perth County]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Several other home-made boards of southwestern Ontario origin, and dating from the 1870s, have been discovered since the 1990s. It seems to have been patented on April 20, 1880, in New York City by Joshua K. Ingalls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jean_philippe.boillet.perso.sfr.fr/nouveau1/recette.html Croquignoles]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.experts123.com/q/what-is-the-history-and-background-of-the-game-of-crokinole.html What is the history and background of the game Crokinole]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crokinole is often believed to be of [[Mennonite]] or [[Amish]] origins, but there is no factual data to support such a claim. The reason for this misconception may be due to its popularity in Mennonite and Amish groups. The game was viewed as a rather innocuous pastime – unlike the perception that diversions such as [[card playing]] or dancing were considered &quot;works of the Devil&quot; as held by many 19th-century Protestant groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/521/crokinole Crokinole | Board Game | BoardGameGeek]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/details/Crokinole Crokinole: Scott Tubman]&lt;/ref&gt;
The oldest roots of crokinole, from the 1860s, suggest the British and South Asian games are the most likely antecedents of what became crokinole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikipedia.infostar.cz/c/cr/crokinole.html Crocile]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a documentary film called ''Crokinole'' was released. The world premiere occurred at the Princess Cinema in [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], Ontario, in early 2006. The movie follows some of the competitors of the 2004 World Crokinole Championship as they prepare for the event.&lt;ref name=&quot;movie&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IMDb&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://former.imdb.com/title/tt0830805/ |title=Crokinole (2006) |accessdate=2008-01-03 |work=The Internet Movie Database }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the name==
The name &quot;Crokinole&quot; derives from ''croquignole'', a French word today designating:
: (1) in France, a kind of &quot;[[cookie]]&quot; (or &quot;[[biscuit]]&quot; in British English),&lt;ref name=&quot;movie&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people = Jonathan Steckley, Joshua Steckley | title = Crokinole | medium = DVD | publisher = Gillies Lake Productions | date = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to a ''[[biscotti|biscotto]]'';
: (2) in [[Quebec French|Quebec]], a pastry somewhat similar to a [[doughnut]] (except for the shape).&lt;ref&gt;For a photo and a recipe, see: [http://www.coupdepouce.com/recettes-cuisine/recettes/desserts/biscuits-muffins-et-carres/croquignoles/r/1808 Recette Croquignoles: Biscuits]&lt;/ref&gt;
It also used to designate of the action of flicking with the finger ([[Molière]], ''Le malade imaginaire''; or [[Voltaire]], ''Lettre à Frédéric II Roi de Prusse''; etc.), and this seems the most likely origin of the name of the game. ''Croquignole'' was also a synonym of ''pichenotte'', a word that gave its name to the game of [[pichenotte]] or [[pitchnut]]. The two games are sometimes mistaken for one another, but are quite different.

Crokinole is called ''knipsbrat'' (&quot;flick-board&quot;) in the [[Low German]] spoken by [[Mennonites]].

==World Crokinole Championship==
The World Crokinole Championship (WCC) tournament has been held annually since 1999 on the first Saturday of June in [[Tavistock, Ontario]]. Tavistock was chosen as the host city because it was the home of Eckhardt Wettlaufer, the maker of the earliest known board. The reigning world crokinole champion is Justin Slater of [[Toronto]]. He won the 2010 Competitive Singles Division and became the youngest champion ever at age 17 after defeating the three-time defending champion, Brian Cook of Toronto, in a tie-breaker. 

The WCC begins with a qualifying round in which competitors play 10 matches against randomly assigned opponents. The qualifying round is divided into two separate sessions to accommodate the large number of players. At the end of the opening round, the top 16 competitors move on to the playoffs. The top four in the playoffs advance to the semifinals to play each other, and the top two compete in the finals. 

The WCC has multiple divisions, including a singles finger-shooting category for competitive players (Adult Singles), novices (Recreational), and younger players (Intermediate, 11-14 yrs; Junior, 6-10 yrs). The WCC also awards a prize for the top 20-hole shooter in the Competitive Singles qualifying round, in the Recreational Singles qualifying round, in the Intermediate Singles, and in the Junior Singles.

==Chinese Championships of Crokinole==

Originating in Dalian, China in 2005, the Chinese Championships of Crokinole (CCC) has been heavily contested for ever since. Dalian was chosen as the host city in China due to the large number of Canadian expatriates living in the area. 

In 2005, the CCC established an alliance with the World Crokinole Championships by establishing that the winner of the Chinese event to be given a seat at the World Championships. This, of course, gave great prestige to the Chinese version and in the first four years of play only one winner has emerged out of China. The current 4-time champion is Adrian Conradi; however, due to his return to Canada a new champion will be declared. The tournament is a double-knockout formula, best of three series, games to 100.

{{Capitalism}}

'''Capitalism''' is an [[economic system]] in which the [[means of production]] are [[Private property|privately]] [[ownership|owned]] and operated for [[profit (economics)|profit]]. Income in a Capitalist system takes at least two forms, ''profit'' on the one hand and ''wages'' on the other. There is also a tradition that treats ''rent'', income from the control of natural resources, as a third phenomenon distinct from either of those.  In any case, profit is what is received by virtue of control of the tools of production, by the capitalists – those who provide the [[Financial capital|capital]]. Wages are received by those who sell their labor with those tools, i.e. the workers. 

There is no consensus on the precise definition of capitalism, nor how the term should be used as an historical category.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Issues in History. Lanham, Md: Rowman and Littlefield, 1999, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, little controversy that private ownership of the means of production, creation of goods or services for profit in a market, and prices and wages are elements of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Tormey, Simon. Anti-Capitalism. One World Publications, 2004. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of historical cases to which the designation is applied, varying in time, geography, politics and culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; Some define capitalism as where ''all'' the means of production are privately owned, and some define it more loosely where merely &quot;most&quot; are in private hands — while others refer to the latter as a [[mixed economy]] biased toward capitalism. More fundamentally, others define capitalism as a system where production is carried out to generate profit and governed subject to the laws of [[capital accumulation]], regardless of legal ownership titles. Private ownership in capitalism implies the right to control property, including determining how it is used, who uses it, whether to sell or rent it, and the right to the revenue generated by the property.&lt;ref&gt;Bessette, Joseph M. American Justice, Volume 2. Salem Press (1996). p. 637&lt;/ref&gt; 

Economists, [[political economy|political economists]] and [[history|historians]] have taken different perspectives on the analysis of capitalism. Economists usually emphasize the degree that government does not have control over markets ([[laissez faire]]), and on [[property]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Tucker, Irvin B.|title=Macroeconomics for Today|pages=553|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Case, Karl E.|title=Principles of Macroeconomics|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most political economists emphasize private property, [[Economic power|power]] relations, [[wage labor]] and [[Economic class|class]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stilwell&quot;/&gt; There is general agreement that capitalism encourages [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Economic systems&quot;.

''Capital'' evolved from ''Capitale'', a late [[Latin]] word based on [[proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]] ''caput'', meaning &quot;head&quot;—also the origin of ''[[chattel]]'' and ''[[cattle]]'' in the sense of movable property (only much later to refer only to livestock). Capitale emerged in the 12th to 13th centuries in the sense of funds, stock of merchandise, sum of money, or money carrying interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Braudel on capitalism&quot;&gt;Braudel p.232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cattle Etymology of &quot;Cattle&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;James Augustus Henry Murray. &quot;Capital&quot;. [http://www.archive.org/details/oedvol02 A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles]. ''Oxford English Press''. Vol 2. page 93.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1283 it was used in the sense of the capital assets of a trading firm. It was frequently interchanged with a number of other words—wealth, money, funds, goods, assets, property and so on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Braudel on capitalism&quot;&gt;Braudel p.233&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''capitalist'' refers to an owner of capital rather than an economic system, but shows earlier recorded use than the term ''capitalism'', dating back to the mid-seventeenth century. The ''Hollandische Mercurius'' uses it in 1633 and 1654 to refer to owners of capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Braudel on capitalism&quot;&gt;Braudel p.234&lt;/ref&gt; In French, [[Étienne Clavier]] referred to ''capitalistes'' in 1788,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. &quot;L'Angleterre a-t-elle l'heureux privilège de n'avoir ni Agioteurs, ni Banquiers, ni Faiseurs de services, ni Capitalistes?&quot; in [Etienne Clavier] (1788) ''De la foi publique envers les créanciers de l'état: lettres à M.

Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. 1821. John Murray Publisher, 3rd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], an English poet, used ''capitalist'' in his work ''Table Talk'' (1823).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Taylor Coleridge. [http://books.google.com/books?id=ma-4W-XiGkIC&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=%22capitalists+for+having+labor+at+demand Tabel The Complete Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge]. page 267.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] used the term ''capitalist'' in his first work, ''[[What is Property?]]'' (1840) to refer to the owners of capital. [[Benjamin Disraeli]] used the term ''capitalist'' in his 1845 work ''[[Sybil (novel)|Sybil]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt; [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] used the term ''capitalist'' (''Kapitalist'') in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848) to refer to a private owner of capital.

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED), the term ''capitalism'' was first used by novelist [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] in 1854 in ''[[The Newcomes]]'', where he meant &quot;having ownership of capital&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;James Augustus Henry Murray. &quot;Capitalism&quot; page 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to the OED, [[Carl Adolph Douai]], a [[German-American]] [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]], used the term ''private capitalism'' in 1863.

The initial usage of the term ''capitalism'' in its modern sense has been attributed to [[Louis Blanc]] in 1850 and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, Fernand. The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism 15–18 Century, Harper and Row, 1979, p.237&lt;/ref&gt; Marx and Engels referred to the ''capitalistic system'' (''kapitalistisches System'')&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx.

''Capitalism''. University of Minnesota Press. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word &quot;capitalism&quot; in reference to an economic system appears twice in Volume I of ''Das Kapital'', p.&amp;nbsp;124 (German edition), and in ''Theories of Surplus Value'', tome II, p.&amp;nbsp;493 (German edition). Marx did not extensively use the form ''capitalism'', but instead those of ''capitalist'' and ''capitalist mode of production'', which appear more than 2600 times in the trilogy ''Das Kapital''.

Marx's notion of the capitalist mode of production is characterised as a system of primarily private ownership of the [[means of production]] in a mainly [[market economy]], with a legal framework on [[commerce]] and a physical [[infrastructure]] provided by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx. ''[[Das Kapital]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Engels made more frequent use of the term ''capitalism''; volumes II and III of ''Das Kapital'', both edited by Engels after Marx's death, contain the word &quot;capitalism&quot; four and three times, respectively. The three combined volumes of ''Das Kapital'' (1867, 1885, 1894) contain the word ''capitalist'' more than 2,600 times.

An 1877 work entitled ''Better Times'' by Hugh Gabutt and an 1884 article in the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' also used the term ''capitalism''.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt; A later use of the term ''capitalism'' to describe the production system was by the German economist [[Werner Sombart]], in his 1902 book ''The Jews and Modern Capitalism'' (''Die Juden und das Wirtschaftsleben''). Sombart's close friend and colleague, [[Max Weber]], also used ''capitalism'' in his 1904 book ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (''Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus'').

==Economic elements==
{{refimprove|section|date=May 2010}}
Capitalist economics developed out of the interactions of the following elements.

A [[Product (business)|product]] is any good produced for exchange on a market. &quot;Commodities&quot; refers to standard products, especially raw materials such as grains and metals, that are not associated with particular producers or brands and trade on organized exchanges.

There are two types of products: [[capital good]]s and [[Final goods|consumer goods]]. Capital goods (i.e., raw materials, tools, industrial machines, vehicles and factories) are used to produce consumer goods (e.g., televisions, cars, computers, houses) to be sold to others. The three inputs required for production are labor, land (i.e., natural resources, which exist prior to human beings) and capital goods. Capitalism entails the private ownership of the latter two — natural resources and capital goods — by a class of owners called capitalists, either individually, collectively or through a state apparatus that operates for a profit or serves the interests of capital owners.

Money was primarily a standardized medium of exchange, and final means of payment, that serves to measure the value all goods and commodities in a standard of value. It eliminates the cumbersome system of [[barter]] by separating the transactions involved in the exchange of products, thus greatly facilitating specialization and trade through encouraging the exchange of commodities. Capitalism involves the further abstraction of money into other exchangeable assets and the accumulation of money through ownership, exchange, interest and various other financial instruments. However, besides serving as a medium of exchange for labour, goods and services, money is also a store of value, similar to precious metals.

[[Labour (economics)|Labour]] includes all physical and mental human resources, including entrepreneurial capacity and management skills, which are needed to produce products and services. [[Manufacturing|Production]] is the act of making products or services by applying [[labour power]] to the means of production.&lt;ref&gt;Ragan, Christopher T.S., and Richard G. Lipsey.

Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of capitalism==
{{Economics sidebar}}
There are many variants of capitalism in existence. All these forms of capitalism are based on production for profit, at least a moderate degree of market allocation and capital accumulation. The dominant forms of capitalism are listed here.

===Anarcho-capitalism===
{{Main|Anarcho-capitalism}}
{{See also|Free-market anarchism}}
Anarcho-capitalism is a [[libertarian]] and [[individualist anarchist]] political philosophy that advocates the elimination of the state and the elevation of the [[sovereign individual]]  in a free market. In an anarcho-capitalist society, law enforcement, courts, and all other security services would be provided by voluntarily-funded competitors such as [[dispute resolution organisation]]s and [[private defense agencies]] rather than through taxation, and money would be privately and competitively provided in an open market.

===Mercantilism===
{{Main|Mercantilism}}
{{See also|Protectionism}}
A nationalist-oriented form of early capitalism that uses the state to advance national business interests abroad, and holds that the wealth of a nation is increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations.

===Free-market capitalism===
{{Main|Free market}}
{{See also|Laissez-faire}}
Free market capitalism consists of a free-price system where supply and demand are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by the government. Productive enterprises are privately-owned, and the role of the state is limited to protecting [[property rights]].

===Social market economy===
{{Main|Social market}}
A social market economy is a nominally free-market system where government intervention in price formation is kept to a minimum, but the state provides for moderate to extensive provision of social security, unemployment benefits and recognition of labor rights through national collective bargaining schemes. The social market is based on private ownership of businesses.

===State capitalism===
{{Main|State capitalism}}
State capitalism consists of state-ownership of profit-seeking enterprises that operate in a capitalist manner in a market economy: examples of this include [[Corporatization|corporatized]] government agencies or partial ownership of shares in publicly-listed firms by the state. State capitalism is also used to refer to an economy consisting of mainly private enterprises that are subjected to comprehensive [[Indicative planning|national economic planning]] by the government, where the state intervenes in the economy to protect specific capitalist businesses. Many anti-[[USSR]] [[socialism|socialists]], as well as many [[anarchism|anarchists]], argue that the Soviet Union was never socialist, but rather state capitalist, since the state owned all the means of production and functioned as an enormous corporation, and exploited the [[working class]] as such.

===Corporate capitalism===
{{Main|Corporate capitalism}}
{{See also|State monopoly capitalism}}
Corporate capitalism is a free or mixed market characterized by the dominance of hierarchical, bureaucratic corporations, which are legally required to pursue profit. State monopoly capitalism refers to a form of corporate capitalism where the state is used to benefit, protect from competition and promote the interests of dominant or established corporations.

===Mixed economy===
{{Main|Mixed economy}}
A largely market-based economy consisting of both public ownership and private ownership of the means of production. In practice, a mixed economy will be heavily slanted toward one extreme; most capitalist economies are defined as &quot;mixed economies&quot; to some degree and are characterized by the dominance of private ownership.

===Other===
Other variants of capitalism include:

===Mercantilism===
{{Main|Mercantilism}}
[[File:Lorrain.seaport.jpg|left|thumb|A painting of a French seaport from 1638 at the height of [[mercantilism]].]]
The period between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries is commonly described as [[mercantilism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Burnham, Peter|title=Capitalism: The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period was associated with geographic exploration of the [[Age of Discovery]] being exploited by merchant overseas traders, especially from England and the [[Low Countries]]; the [[European colonization of the Americas]]; and the rapid growth in overseas trade. Mercantilism was a system of trade for profit, although commodities were still largely produced by non-capitalist production methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot; /&gt;

While some scholars see mercantilism as the earliest stage of capitalism, others argue that capitalism did not emerge until later. For example, [[Karl Polanyi]], noted that &quot;mercantilism, with all its tendency toward commercialization, never attacked the safeguards which protected [the] two basic elements of production—labor and land—from becoming the elements of commerce&quot;; thus mercantilist attitudes towards economic regulation were closer to feudalist attitudes, &quot;they disagreed only on the methods of regulation.&quot;

Moreover Polanyi argued that the hallmark of capitalism is the establishment of generalized markets for what he referred to as the &quot;fictitious commodities&quot;: land, labor, and money. Accordingly, &quot;not until 1834 was a competitive labor market established in England, hence industrial capitalism as a social system cannot be said to have existed before that date.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Polanyi, Karl. The Great Transformation. Beacon Press, Boston.1944.p87&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of long-distance merchant-driven trade motivated by profit has been found as early as the second millennium BC, with the Old Assyrian merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Warburton, David, Macroeconomics from the beginning: The General Theory, Ancient Markets, and the Rate of Interest. Paris: Recherches et Publications, 2003.p49&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest forms of mercantilism date back to the [[Roman Empire]]. When the Roman Empire expanded, the mercantilist economy expanded throughout Europe. After the [[decline of the Roman Empire|collapse of the Roman Empire]], most of the European economy became controlled by local [[feudal]] powers, and mercantilism collapsed there. However, mercantilism persisted in [[Arabia]]. Due to its proximity to neighboring countries, the Arabs established trade routes to [[Egypt]], [[Persia]], and [[Byzantium]]. As [[Islam]] spread in the seventh century, mercantilism spread rapidly to Spain, Portugal, [[Northern Africa]], and Asia. Mercantilism finally revived in Europe in the fourteenth century, as mercantilism spread from Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.howstuffworks.com/european-history/capitalism3.htm The Rise of Capitalism]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the major tenets of mercantilist theory was [[bullionism]], a doctrine stressing the importance of accumulating [[precious metals]]. Mercantilists argued that a state should export more goods than it imported so that foreigners would have to pay the difference in precious metals. Mercantilists asserted that only raw materials that could not be extracted at home should be imported; and promoted government [[subsidy|subsidies]], such as the granting of monopolies and protective [[tariff]]s, were necessary to encourage home production of manufactured goods.

[[File:Clive.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Clive]] after the [[Battle of Plassey]]. The battle began [[East India Company]] rule in India.]]

European [[merchant]]s, backed by state controls, [[subsidy|subsidies]], and [[monopoly|monopolies]], made most of their profits from the buying and selling of goods. In the words of [[Francis Bacon]], the purpose of mercantilism was &quot;the opening and well-balancing of trade; the cherishing of manufacturers; the banishing of idleness; the repressing of waste and excess by sumptuary laws; the improvement and husbanding of the soil; the regulation of prices…&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Sir George Clark, ''The Seventeenth Century'' (New York: Oxford University Pres, 1961), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar practices of economic regimentation had begun earlier in the medieval towns. However, under mercantilism, given the contemporaneous rise of [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]], the state superseded the local [[guild]]s as the regulator of the economy. During that time the guilds essentially functioned like [[cartels]] that monopolized the quantity of craftsmen to earn above-market wages.&lt;ref&gt;Mancur Olson, The rise and decline of nations: economic growth, stagflation, and social rigidities (New Haven &amp; London 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the period from the eighteenth century, the commercial stage of capitalism originated from the start of the British [[East India Company]] and the [[Dutch East India Company]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Banaji&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic system :: Market systems|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/178493/economic-system/61117/Market-systems#toc242146|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These companies were characterized by their [[colonialism|colonial]] and [[expansionism|expansionary]] powers given to them by nation-states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Banaji&quot; /&gt; During this era, merchants, who had traded under the previous stage of mercantilism, invested capital in the East India Companies and other colonies, seeking a [[return on investment]]. In his &quot;History of Economic Analysis,&quot; Austrian economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] reduced mercantilist propositions to three main concerns: exchange controls, export monopolism and balance of trade.&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, J.A. (1954) History of Economic Analysis&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrialism===
{{See also|Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|250px|thumb|A [[Watt steam engine]]. The [[steam engine]] fuelled primarily by [[coal]] propelled the [[Industrial Revolution]] in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Watt steam engine]] image: located in the lobby of into the Superior Technical School of Industrial Engineers of a the UPM ([[Madrid]])&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A new group of economic theorists, led by [[David Hume]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Hume, David|title=Political Discourses|location=Edinburgh|publisher=A. Kincaid &amp;amp; A. Donaldson|year=1752}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adam Smith]], in the mid 18th century, challenged fundamental [[mercantilist]] doctrines as the belief that the amount of the world’s wealth remained constant and that a state could only increase its wealth at the expense of another state.

During the [[Industrial Revolution]], the industrialist replaced the merchant as a dominant actor in the capitalist system and effected the decline of the traditional handicraft skills of [[artisan]]s, [[guild]]s, and [[journeyman|journeymen]]. Also during this period, the surplus generated by the rise of commercial agriculture encouraged increased mechanization of agriculture. Industrial capitalism marked the development of the [[factory]] system of manufacturing, characterized by a complex [[division of labor]] between and within work process and the routine of work tasks; and finally established the global domination of the capitalist mode of production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot; /&gt;

Britain also abandoned its [[protectionist]] policy, as embraced by mercantilism. In the 19th century, [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]], who based their beliefs on the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]], initiated a movement to lower tariffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;laissezf&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=laissez-faire|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/la/laissezf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1840s, Britain adopted a less protectionist policy, with the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] and the [[Navigation Acts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot; /&gt; Britain reduced [[tariffs]] and [[import quota|quotas]], in line with [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]]'s advocacy for [[free trade]].

[[Karl Polanyi]] argued that capitalism did not emerge until the progressive commodification of land, money, and labor culminating in the establishment of a generalized labor market in Britain in the 1830s. For Polanyi, &quot;the extension of the market to the elements of industry – land, labor and money – was the inevitable consequence of the introduction of the factory system in a commercial society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Polanyi, Karl. The Great Transformation, Beacon Press. Boston. 1944. p.78&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources argued that mercantilism fell after the repeal of the Navigation Acts in 1849.&lt;ref name=&quot;laissezf&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Navigation Acts

===Keynesianism and neoliberalism===

In the period following the global depression of the 1930s, the state played an increasingly prominent role in the capitalistic system throughout much of the world.

[[File:NY stock exchange traders floor LC-U9-10548-6.jpg|thumb|The New York [[stock exchange]] [[trading room|traders' floor]] (1963)]]

After [[World War II]], a broad array of new analytical tools in the [[social sciences]] were developed to explain the social and economic trends of the period, including the concepts of [[post-industrial society]] and the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot; /&gt; This era was greatly influenced by [[Keynesian]] economic stabilization policies. The postwar boom ended in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the situation was worsened by the rise of [[stagflation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Barnes, Trevor J.|title=Reading economic geography|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=063123554X|pages=127|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptionally high [[inflation]] combined with slow output growth, rising unemployment, and eventually [[recession]] to cause a loss of credibility in the [[Keynesian]] welfare-statist mode of regulation. Under the influence of [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]], [[Western world|Western]] states embraced policy prescriptions inspired by [[laissez-faire]] capitalism and [[classical liberalism]].

In particular, [[monetarism]], a theoretical alternative to Keynesianism that is more compatible with laissez-faire, gained increasing prominence in the capitalist world, especially under the leadership of [[Ronald Reagan]] in the US and [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the UK in the 1980s.  Public and political interest began shifting away from the so-called [[collectivist]] concerns of Keynes's managed capitalism to a focus on individual choice, called &quot;remarketized capitalism.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Fulcher, James 2004&quot;&gt;Fulcher, James. Capitalism. 1st ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the eyes of many economic and political commentators, the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] brought further evidence of the superiority of market capitalism over communism.

===Globalization===
{{Main|Globalization}}
Although [[international trade]] has been associated with the development of capitalism for over five hundred years, some thinkers argue that a number of trends associated with [[globalization]] have acted to increase the mobility of people and capital since the last quarter of the 20th century, combining to circumscribe the room to maneuver of states in choosing non-capitalist models of development. Today, these trends have bolstered the argument that capitalism should now be viewed as a truly [[world government|world system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot; /&gt; However, other thinkers argue that globalization, even in its quantitative degree, is no greater now than during earlier periods of capitalist trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=After the New Economy |last=Henwood |first=Doug |publisher=New Press |date=1 October 2003 |isbn=1-56584-770-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neoclassical economic theory==
{{Ref improve section|date=June 2010}}
Neoclassical economics explain capitalism as made up of individuals, enterprises, markets and government. According to their theories, individuals engage in a capitalist economy as [[consumer]]s, [[laborer|labourers]], and [[investor]]s. As labourers, individuals may decide which jobs to prepare for, and in which markets to look for work. As investors they decide how much of their income to save and how to invest their savings. These savings, which become investments, provide much of the money that businesses need to grow.

Business firms decide what to produce and where this production should occur. They also purchase inputs (materials, labour, and capital). Businesses try to influence consumer purchase decisions through marketing and advertisement, as well as the creation of new and improved products.
Driving the capitalist economy is the search for profits (revenues minus expenses). This is known as the [[profit motive]], and it helps ensure that companies produce the goods and services that consumers desire and are able to buy. To be profitable, firms must sell a quantity of their product at a certain price to yield a profit. A business may lose money if sales fall too low or if its costs become too high. The profit motive encourages firms to operate more efficiently. By using less materials, labour or capital, a firm can cut its production costs, which can lead to increased profits.

An economy grows when the total value of goods and services produced rises. This growth requires investment in infrastructure, capital and other resources necessary in production. In a capitalist system, businesses decide when and how much they want to invest.

Income in a capitalist economy depends primarily on what skills are in demand and what skills are being supplied. Skills that are in scarce supply are worth more in the market and can attract higher incomes. Competition among workers for jobs — and among employers for skilled workers — help determine wage rates. Firms need to pay high enough wages to attract the appropriate workers; when jobs are scarce, workers may accept lower wages than they would when jobs are plentiful. [[Trade union]] and governments influence wages in capitalist systems. Unions act to represent their members in negotiations with employers over such things as wage rates and acceptable working conditions.

===The market===
[[File:Supply-and-demand.svg|thumb|right|240px|The price (P) of a product is determined by a balance between production at each price (supply, S) and the desires of those with [[purchasing power]] at each price (demand, D). This results in a market equilibrium, with a given quantity (Q) sold of the product. A rise in demand from D1 to D2 would result in an increase in price from P1 to P2 and an increase in output from Q1 to Q2.]]

In a capitalist economy, the prices of goods and services are controlled mainly through [[supply and demand]] and [[competition]]. Supply is the amount of a good or service produced by a firm and which is available for sale. Demand is the amount that people are willing to buy at a specific price. Prices tend to rise when demand exceeds supply, and fall when supply exceeds demand. In theory, the market is able to coordinate itself when a new equilibrium price and quantity is reached.

Competition arises when more than one producer is trying to sell the same or similar products to the same buyers. In capitalist theory, competition leads to innovation and more affordable prices. Without competition, a [[monopoly]] or [[cartel]] may develop. A monopoly occurs when a firm supplies the total output in the market; the firm can therefore limit output and raise prices because it has no fear of competition. A cartel is a group of firms that act together in a monopolistic manner to control output and raise prices.

===Role of government===
{{See|Competition regulator|Consumer protection|Competition law}}
In a capitalist system, the government does not prohibit [[private property]] or prevent individuals from working where they please. The government does not prevent firms from determining what wages they will pay and what prices they will charge for their products. Many countries, however, have minimum wage laws and minimum safety standards.

Under some versions of capitalism, the government carries out a number of economic functions, such as issuing money, supervising public utilities and enforcing private contracts. Many countries have [[competition law]]s that prohibit monopolies and cartels from forming. Despite anti-monopoly laws, large corporations can form near-monopolies in some industries. Such firms can temporarily drop prices and accept losses to prevent competition from entering the market, and then raise them again once the threat of entry is reduced. In many countries, public utilities (e.g. electricity, heating fuel, communications) are able to operate as a monopoly under government regulation, due to high economies of scale.

Government agencies regulate the standards of service in many industries, such as airlines and broadcasting, as well as financing a wide range of programs. In addition, the government regulates the flow of capital and uses financial tools such as the interest rate to control factors such as inflation and unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Capitalism.&quot; World Book Encyclopedia. 1988. 194. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Democracy, the state, and legal frameworks==
{{Main|History of capitalist theory}}

===Private property===
The relationship between the [[state (polity)|state]], its formal mechanisms, and capitalist societies has been debated in many fields of social and political theory, with active discussion since the 19th century. [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]] is a contemporary economist who has argued that an important characteristic of capitalism is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal property system where ownership and transactions are clearly recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/03/desoto.htm |title=The mystery of capital|author=Hernando de Soto|accessdate=26 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to de Soto, this is the process by which physical assets are transformed into capital, which in turn may be used in many more ways and much more efficiently in the market economy. A number of Marxian economists have argued that the [[Enclosure Acts]] in England, and similar legislation elsewhere, were an integral part of capitalist [[primitive accumulation]] and that specific legal frameworks of private land ownership have been integral to the development of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch27.htm |title=Capital, v. 1. Part VIII: primitive accumulation|author=Karl Marx|accessdate=26 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=N. F. R. Crafts |title=Enclosure and labor supply revisited |journal=Explorations in economic history |issue=15 |month=April |year=1978 |pages=172–183 |doi=10.1016/0014-4983(78)90019-0 |volume=15}}.we the say yes&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions===
[[New institutional economics]], a field pioneered by [[Douglass North]], stresses the need of a legal framework in order for capitalism to function optimally, and focuses on the relationship between the historical development of capitalism and the creation and maintenance of political and economic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=North, Douglass C.|title=Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In new institutional economics and other fields focusing on public policy, economists seek to judge when and whether governmental intervention (such as [[tax]]es, [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]], and [[Regulatory economics|government regulation]]) can result in potential gains in efficiency. According to [[Gregory Mankiw]], a [[New Keynesian economics|New Keynesian economist]], governmental intervention can improve on market outcomes under conditions of &quot;[[market failure]]&quot;, or situations in which the market on its own does not allocate resources efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Economics|publisher=Harvard University|year=1997|pages=10|unused_data=Mankiw, N. Gregory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market failure occurs when an [[externality]] is present and a market will either under-produce a product with a positive externalization or overproduce a product that generates a negative externalization. Air pollution, for instance, is a negative externalization that cannot be incorporated into markets as the world’s air is not owned and then sold for use to polluters. So, too much pollution could be emitted and people not involved in the production pay the cost of the pollution instead of the firm that initially emitted the air pollution. Critics of market failure theory, like [[Ronald Coase]], [[Harold Demsetz]], and [[James M. Buchanan]] argue that government programs and policies also fall short of absolute perfection. Market failures are often small, and government failures are sometimes large. It is therefore the case that imperfect markets are often better than imperfect governmental alternatives. While all nations currently have some kind of market regulations, the desirable degree of regulation is disputed.

===Democracy===
The relationship between [[democracy]] and capitalism is a contentious area in theory and popular political movements. The extension of universal adult male [[suffrage]] in 19th century Britain occurred along with the development of industrial capitalism, and democracy became widespread at the same time as capitalism, leading many theorists to posit a causal relationship between them, or that each affects the other. However, in the 20th century, according to some authors, capitalism also accompanied a variety of political formations quite distinct from liberal democracies, including [[fascism|fascist]] regimes, monarchies, and single-party states,&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot; /&gt; while some democratic societies such as the [[Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela]] and [[Anarchist Catalonia]] have been expressly anti-capitalist.&lt;ref&gt;On the democratic nature of the Venezuelan state, see [http://www.gobiernoenlinea.ve/estructura_edo/estructura_edo4.html Gobiernoenlinea.ve].  On the current government's rejection of capitalism in favor of socialism, see [http://www.gobiernoenlinea.ve/misc-view/sharedfiles/Metas_Milenio.pdf Gobiernoenlinea.ve] and [http://www.minci.gob.ve/motores/62/11852 Minci.gob.ve]&lt;/ref&gt;

While some thinkers argue that capitalist development more-or-less inevitably eventually leads to the emergence of democracy, others dispute this claim. Research on the [[democratic peace theory]] indicates that capitalist democracies rarely make war with one another&lt;ref&gt;For the influence of capitalism on peace, see Mousseau, M. (2009) &quot;The Social Market Roots of Democratic Peace&quot;, ''International Security'' 33 (4)&lt;/ref&gt; and have little internal violence. However critics of the democratic peace theory note that democratic capitalist states may fight infrequently and or never with other democratic capitalist states because of political similarity or stability rather than because they are democratic or capitalist.

Some commentators argue that though economic growth under capitalism has led to democratization in the past, it may not do so in the future, as [[authoritarian]] regimes have been able to manage economic growth without making concessions to greater political freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Mesquita, Bruce Bueno de|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20050901faessay84507/bruce-bueno-de-mesquita-george-w-downs/development-and-democracy.html|title=Development and Democracy|date=2005-09|accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Single, Joseph T.|url=http://www10.nytimes.com/cfr/international/20040901facomment_v83n4_siegle-weinstein-halperin.html?_r=5&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|title=Why Democracies Excel|date=2004-09|accessdate=26 February 2008|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
States that have highly capitalistic economic systems have thrived under authoritarian or oppressive political systems. Singapore, which maintains a highly open market economy and attracts lots of foreign investment, does not protect civil liberties such as freedom of speech and expression. The private (capitalist) sector in the People's Republic of China has grown exponentially and thrived since its inception, despite having an authoritarian government.  [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s rule in Chile led to economic growth by using authoritarian means to create a safe environment for investment and capitalism.

In response to criticism of the system, some proponents of capitalism have argued that its advantages are supported by empirical research. [[Indices of Economic Freedom]] show a correlation between nations with more economic freedom (as defined by the indices) and higher scores on variables such as income and life expectancy, including the poor, in these nations.

==Political benefits==
===Economic growth===
[[File:Gdp chart.png|thumb|World's [[GDP]] per capita shows exponential growth since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective |author=Angus Maddison |publisher=[[OECD]] |location=Paris |year=2001 |isbn=92-64-18998-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Prc1952-2005gdp.gif|thumb|Capitalism and the economy of the [[People's Republic of China]]]]

In years 1000–1820 world economy grew sixfold, 50 % per person. After capitalism had started to spread more widely, in years  1820–1998 world economy grew 50-fold, i.e., 9-fold per person.&lt;ref name=wolf44/&gt; In most capitalist economic regions such as Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the economy grew 19-fold per person even though these countries already had a higher starting level, and in Japan, which was poor in 1820, to 31-fold, whereas in the rest of the world the growth was only 5-fold per person.&lt;ref name=wolf44&gt;[[Martin Wolf]], ''[[Why Globalization works]]'', p. 43-45&lt;/ref&gt;

Many theorists and policymakers in predominantly capitalist nations have emphasized capitalism's ability to promote economic growth, as measured by [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), [[capacity utilization]] or [[standard of living]]. This argument was central, for example, to [[Adam Smith]]'s advocacy of letting a free market control production and price, and allocate resources. Many theorists have noted that this increase in global GDP over time coincides with the emergence of the modern world capitalist system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/04-05/essay.cfm |title=The Industrial Revolution: Past and Future |author=Robert E. Lucas Jr. |work=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis 2003 Annual Report |accessdate=26 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/TCEH/1998_Draft/World_GDP/Estimating_World_GDP.html |title=Estimating World GDP, One Million B.C. – Present |author=J. Bradford DeLong |accessdate=26 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents argue that increasing GDP (per capita) is empirically shown to bring about improved standards of living, such as better availability of food, housing, clothing, and health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandtheStandardofLiving.html |title=Industrial Revolution and the Standard of Living |author=Clark Nardinelli |accessdate=26 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decrease in the number of hours worked per week and the decreased participation of children and the elderly in the workforce have been attributed to capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Barro, Robert J.|title=Macroeconomics|publisher=MIT Press|year=1997|isbn=0262024365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mises.org/article.aspx?Id=1481|title=Morality and Economic Law: Toward a Reconciliation|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|accessdate=26 February 2008|author=Woods, Thomas E.|date=5 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents also believe that a capitalist economy offers far more opportunities for individuals to raise their income through new professions or business ventures than do other economic forms. To their thinking, this potential is much greater than in either traditional [[feudal]] or [[tribal]] societies or in socialist societies.

===Political freedom===
[[Milton Friedman]] argued that the [[economic freedom]] of competitive capitalism is a requisite of [[political freedom]]. Friedman argued that centralized control of economic activity is always accompanied by [[political repression]]. In his view, transactions in a market economy are voluntary, and the wide diversity that voluntary activity permits is a fundamental threat to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish power to coerce. Friedman's view was also shared by [[Friedrich Hayek]] and John Maynard Keynes, both of whom believed that capitalism is vital for freedom to survive and thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Friedrich Hayek|title=The Road to Serfdom|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|year=1944|isbn=0-226-32061-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bellamy, Richard|title=The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-521-56354-2|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-organization===
Austrian School economists have argued that capitalism can organize itself into a complex system without an external guidance or planning mechanism. Friedrich Hayek considered the phenomenon of [[self-organization]] as underpinning capitalism. Prices serve as a signal as to the urgent and unfilled wants of people, and the promise of profits gives entrepreneurs [[incentive]] to use their knowledge and resources to satisfy those wants. Thus the activities of millions of people, each seeking his own interest, are coordinated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Walberg, Herbert|title=Education and Capitalism|publisher=Hoover Institution Press|year=2001|pages=87–89|isbn=0-8179-3972-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of capitalism|Anti-capitalism|Capitalist mode of production}}
[[File:Anti-capitalism color.jpg|right|thumb|250px|An [[Industrial Workers of the World]] poster (1911)]]
Critics of capitalism associate it with: unfair [[distribution of wealth]] and power; a tendency toward market [[monopoly]] or [[oligopoly]] (and government by [[oligarchy]]); [[imperialism]], [[counter-revolutionary]] wars and various forms of economic and cultural [[exploitation]]; [[Political repression|repression]] of workers and [[trade union]]ists; [[social alienation]]; [[economic inequality]]; [[unemployment]]; and economic instability. 

Notable critics of capitalism have included: [[socialism|socialists]], [[Anarchism|anarchists]], [[communism|communists]], [[Social democracy|social democrats]], [[Technocracy|technocrats]], some types of [[conservatism|conservatives]], [[Luddite]]s, [[Narodnik]]s, [[Shakers]] and some types of [[nationalism|nationalists]]. 

[[Marxism|Marxists]] have advocated a revolutionary overthrow of capitalism that would lead to socialism, before eventually transforming into communism. Many socialists consider capitalism to be irrational, in that production and the direction of the economy are unplanned, creating many inconsistencies and internal contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;Brander, James A. Government policy toward business. 4th ed. Mississauga, Ontario: John Wiley &amp; Sons Canada, Ltd., 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Labor history (discipline)|Labor historians]] and scholars such as [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] have argued that [[Unfree labour|unfree labor]] — by [[Slavery|slaves]], [[indentured servant]]s, prisoners, and other coerced persons — is compatible with capitalist relations.&lt;ref&gt;That unfree labor is acceptable to capital was argued during the 1980s by Tom Brass. See ''Towards a Comparative Political Economy of Unfree Labor'' (Cass, 1999). {{Cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/llt/52/linden.html |title=&quot;Labour History as the History of Multitudes&quot;, ''Labour/Le Travail'', 52, Fall 2003, p. 235-244 |author=Marcel van der Linden |accessdate=26 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many aspects of capitalism have come under attack from the [[anti-globalization movement]], which is primarily opposed to [[corporate capitalism]]. [[environmentalism|Environmentalists]] have argued that capitalism requires continual economic growth, and that it will inevitably deplete the finite natural resources of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = McMurty |first = John |title = The Cancer Stage of Capitalism |publisher = [[PLUTO PRESS]] |year = 1999 |isbn = 0745313477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religions have criticized or opposed specific elements of capitalism. Traditional [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] forbid [[Usury|lending money at interest]], although alternative methods of banking have been developed. Some Christians have criticized capitalism for its [[Economic materialism|materialist]] aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P8C.HTM#-2FX|title=III.

'''Cross ownership''' is a method of reinforcing business relationships by owning stock in the companies with which a given company does business. Heavy cross ownership is referred to as circular ownership.

In the US, &quot;cross ownership&quot; also refers to a type of investment in different mass-media properties in one market.

==Cross ownership of stock==
Some countries where cross ownership of shares is a major part of the business culture are:
* [[Japan]]
* [[Germany]]

Positives of cross ownership:
* Closely ties each business to the economic destiny of its business partners
* Promotes a slow rate of economic change

Cross ownership of shares is criticized for:
* Stagnating the economy
* Wasting capital that could be used to improve productivity
* Expanding economic downturns by preventing reallocation of capital

A major factor in perpetuating cross ownership of shares is a high [[capital gains]] tax rate.  A company has less incentive to sell cross owned shares if taxes are high because of the immediate reduction in the value of the assets.

For example, a company owns $1000 of stock in another company that was originally purchased for $200.  If the capital gains tax rate is 50% (like Germany) and the company sells the stock,
the company has $600 which is 40 percent less than before it sold the stock.

Long term cross ownership of shares combined with a high capital tax rate greatly increases periods of asset deflation both in time and in severity.

==Media cross ownership==
Cross ownership also refers to a type of media ownership in which one type of communications (say a newspaper) owns or is the sister company of another type of medium (such as a radio or TV station). One example is ''[[The New York Times]]'' 's former ownership of [[WQXR-FM|WQXR]] Radio and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'''s similar relationship with WGN Radio ([[WGN-AM]]) and Television ([[WGN-TV]]).

The [[Federal Communications Commission]] generally does not allow cross ownership, to keep from one license holder having too much local media ownership, unless the license holder obtains a waiver, such as [[News Corporation]] and the [[Tribune Company]] have in New York.

The mid-1970s cross-ownership guidelines grandfathered already-existing crossownerships, such as ''Tribune''-WGN, ''New York Times''-WQXR and the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' ownership of [[WPIX]] Television and Radio.

'''Cardiology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|καρδίᾱ}}, ''kardiā'', &quot;heart&quot;; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is a medical specialty dealing with disorders of the [[heart]] (specifically the [[human heart]]). The field includes diagnosis and treatment of [[congenital heart defect]]s, [[coronary artery disease]], [[heart failure]], [[valvular heart disease]] and [[electrophysiology]].  Physicians specializing in this field of medicine are called '''cardiologists'''. 

Cardiologists should not be confused with [[cardiac surgeon]]s, cardiothoracic and cardiovascular, who are surgeons who perform cardiac surgery via [[sternotomy]] — open operative procedures on the heart and great vessels.

== The heart ==
[[File:Heart diagram blood flow en.svg|thumb|325px|Blood flow diagram of the human heart. Blue components indicate de-oxygenated blood pathways and red components indicate oxygenated pathways.]]

{{main|heart|human heart}}

The heart is the center focus of cardiology, and has been used extensively outside of the anatomical meaning such as an idiom (&quot;The heart of [[Alcatraz]] is the prison.&quot;) and figuratively (e.g., the song [[I Left My Heart in San Francisco]]).
As the focus of cardiology, the heart has numerous anatomical features (e.g., [[atrium|atria]], [[ventricle]]s, [[heart valve]]s) and numerous physiological features (e.g., [[systole (medicine)|systole]], [[heart sounds]], [[afterload]]) that are of concern.
Disorders of the heart leads to [[heart disease]] and [[cardiovascular disease]] and they lead to a significant number of deaths: [[cardiovascular disease]] is the leading [[cause of death]] and caused 29.34% of all deaths in 2002.

The primary responsibility of the heart is to pump [[blood]] around the body.
It pumps blood from the body — called the [[systemic circulation]] — through the [[lung]]s — called the [[pulmonary circulation]] — and then back out to the body.
This means that the heart is connected and affects the entirety of the body.
While plenty is known about the healthy heart, the bulk of the study in cardiology is in the disorders of the heart and restoration, where possible, of function.

The heart is a muscle that squeezes blood and functions like a pump.
Each part of the heart is susceptible to failure or dysfunction and the heart could be divided into the mechanical and the electrical.

The electrical part of the heart is centered on the periodic contraction (squeezing) of the [[myocardium|muscle cells]] that is caused by the [[cardiac pacemaker]] located in the [[sinoatrial node]].
The study of the electrical aspects is a subfield of [[electrophysiology]] called [[cardiac electrophysiology]] and is epitomized with the [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG/EKG).
The [[action potential]]s generated in the pacemaker propagate throughout the heart in a specific pattern and is the system that carries this potential is called the [[electrical conduction system of the heart|electrical conduction system]].
Dysfunction of the electrical system manifests in many ways and includes [[Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome]], [[ventricular fibrillation]], and [[heart block]].

The mechanical part of the heart is centered on the [[fluid mechanics|fluidic movement]] of [[blood]] and the functionality of the heart as a [[pump]].
The mechanical part is ultimately the purpose of the heart and many of the disorders of the heart disrupt the ability to move blood.
Failure to move sufficient blood can result in failure in other organs and may result in death if severe.
[[Heart failure]] is one condition in which the mechanical properties of the heart have failed or are failing, which means insufficient blood is being circulated.

There exists other disorders of the heart that disrupt both the electrical and the mechanical properties of the heart.
A more poignant disorder is that of a [[myocardial infarction]] (MI) or heart attack.
An MI causes cellular death of the heart which reduces both the electrical and mechanical capabilities of the heart and can lead to death if severe.

== Disorders ==
Cardiology is concerned with the normal functionality of the heart and the deviation from a healthy heart.
Many disorders involve the heart itself but some are outside of the heart.  It is possible to [http://weighttrainingforwomeninfo.com/make-heart-healthy-to-remain-healthy.html keep your heart healthy] by following some simple routines.

=== Disorders of the coronary circulation ===
[[File:Coronary arteries.png|thumb|350px|Coronary arteries labeled in red text and other landmarks in blue text.]]

Contrary to a basic understanding of the cardiovascular system, the heart cannot receive enough oxygen and nutrients from the blood it pumps and it must be supply itself with blood as if it were any other [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] in the body.
This circulation of blood is called the [[coronary circulation]].
The coronary circulation consists of [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]] and [[coronary vein]]s.

Disorders of the coronary circulation can have devastating effects to the heart since damage to the heart can reduce coronary circulation which causes further damage.

; [[Acute coronary syndrome]] (ACS) : Acute coronary syndrome is a broad term encompassing many acute [[myocardial infarction]] symptoms.
; [[Angina pectoris]] : Angina pectoris literally means &quot;breast pain&quot; that refers to chest pain caused by [[ischemia]] of the heart.
; [[Atherosclerosis]] : Atherosclerosis is the condition in which an artery wall thickens as the result of a build-up of fatty materials (e.g., [[cholesterol]]).  Atherosclerosis of a coronary artery leads to [[coronary heart disease]].
; [[Coronary heart disease]] : Coronary heart disease is a general term for any reduction in coronary circulation.  One such condition is [[atherosclerosis]].
; [[Myocardial infarction]] (aka heart attack) : A myocardial infarction is the death of a part of the heart which is typically caused by a blockage of the coronary circulation or [[coronary heart disease]].
; [[Restenosis]] : Recurrence of [[stenosis]] which would refer to a [[coronary artery]] in the context of the coronary circulation.

=== Cardiac arrest ===
[[File:Asystole11.JPG|thumb|350px|A rhythm strip showing a couple beats of normal sinus followed by an atrial beat and [[asystole]] (&quot;flatline&quot;).]]

[[Cardiac arrest]] refers to the cessation(to cease)of normal systemic circulation due to failure in proper contraction of the heart.
There are several conditions that can cause cardiac arrest.

; [[Asystole]] (&quot;flatline&quot;) : Asystole refers to the absence of electrical activity of the heart and is sometimes referred to as a &quot;flatline&quot; because the [[electrocardiogram]] shows a solid line due to the absence of electrical activity.
; [[Pulseless electrical activity]] (PEA) : Pulseless electrical activity is when the [[electrocardiogram]] shows a rhythm that should produce a [[pulse]] but it does not.  PEA is commonly caused by the 6 H's and 6 T's (see PEA article).
; [[Pulseless ventricular tachycardia]] : Pulseless [[ventricular tachycardia]] (VT) Is one classification of VT such that no [[pulse]] is felt because of an ineffective cardiac output which causes cardiac arrest.
; [[Sudden cardiac death]] : Sudden cardiac death is a concept of [[natural death]] rather than a specific medical condition.  There are several causes of sudden cardiac death and it is distinct from [[cardiac arrest]].
; [[Ventricular fibrillation]] : Ventricular fibrillation is [[fibrillation]] of the [[ventricle]]s of the heart. Rhythmic contraction is necessary for efficient movement of blood and fibrillation disrupts this rhythm sufficiently to cause cardiac arrest.

Treatment of cardiac arrest includes [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) and [[defibrillation]] depending on the exact cause of cardiac arrest.

=== Disorders of the myocardium (muscle of the heart) ===
[[Image:Right Ventricular hypertrophy.svg|thumb|right|350px|The diagram shows a healthy heart (left) and one suffering from right ventricular hypertrophy (right).]]

==History==
The original companies that spawned Capcom's Japanese branch were I.R.M Corporation founded on May 30, 1979,&lt;ref name=&quot;ign25th&quot; /&gt; as well as its subsidiary Japan Capsule Computer Co., Ltd., both of which were devoted to the manufacturing and distribution of electronic game machines.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/company/history.html |title=Corporate Information: History |date=September 30, 2009 |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two companies underwent a name change to Sambi Co., Ltd. in September 1981,&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; while Capcom Co., Ltd. itself was first established on June 11, 1983,&lt;ref name=&quot;ign25th&quot; /&gt; for the purpose of taking over the internal sales department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/company/history.html |title=会社情報 カプコンの歴史 |language=[[Japanese language|Japanese]] |date=September 30, 2009 |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1989, the old affiliate company Capcom Co., Ltd. merged with Sambi Co., Ltd., resulting in the current Japanese branch.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; The name Capcom is an abbreviation of &quot;Capsule Computer&quot;, a term coined by the company to describe the [[Video game arcade cabinet|arcade machines]] it solely manufactured in its early years, designed to set themselves apart from [[personal computer]]s that were becoming widespread at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/company/name.html |title=会社情報 社名の由来 |language=[[Japanese language|Japanese]] |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word capsule alludes to how Capcom likened its game software to &quot;a capsule packed to the brim with gaming fun&quot;, as well as to the company's desire to protect its intellectual property with a hard outer shell, preventing illegal copies and inferior imitations.&lt;ref name=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;

While Capcom's first product was the coin-operated ''Little League'' from July 1983, its first real video game, the [[Arcade game|arcade title]] ''[[Vulgus]]'', was released in May 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; Beginning with a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] port of ''[[1942 (video game)|1942]]'' published in December 1985, the company started to venture into the market of [[home console]] video games,&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; which became its main business segment a few years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;businesssegments&quot; /&gt; Since then, Capcom created 15 multi-million-selling game series, the most successful of which is ''[[Resident Evil]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;salesdata&quot; /&gt;

In addition to the development and publishing of home, online, mobile, arcade, pachinko, and pachislo games, the company publishes [[strategy guide]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; maintains its own [[Video arcade|arcade centers]], and licenses its franchise and character properties for use in tie-in products, movies, television series, and stage performances.&lt;ref name=&quot;businesssegments&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/company/business.html |title=Corporate Information: Business Segments |date=September 30, 2009 |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suleputer]], an in-house marketing and music label established in cooperation with Sony Music Entertainment Intermedia in 1998, publishes CDs, DVDs, and other media based on Capcom's games.&lt;ref name=&quot;annualreport1998&quot; /&gt; An annual private media summit called Captivate, renamed from Gamers Day in 2008, is traditionally used as a platform for new game and business announcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom-unity.com/kramez/blog/2008/03/28/gamers_day_is_dead_long_live_the_captivate08_media |title=&quot;Gamers Day&quot; is dead, long live the CAPTIVATE08 Media Summit |author=Kramer, Chris |date=March 28, 2008 |publisher=Capcom Entertainment, Inc |accessdate=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company structure==
===Development studios===
In the first few years after its establishment, the Japanese branch of Capcom had three development groups referred to as &quot;Planning Rooms&quot;, led by [[Tokuro Fujiwara]], Takashi Nishiyama and [[Yoshiki Okamoto]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Gameside |title=ゲーム業界を“爆発”させた“ストライダー”の父 「四井浩一」 　ディスコグラフィー |date=February 2009 |issue=16 |language=[[Japanese language|Japanese]] |publisher=Micro Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=[[Strider (arcade game)|Strider Hiryū]] |developer=Capcom Co., Ltd |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd. |date=March 7, 1989 |scene=staff credits}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, games developed internally used to be created by several numbered &quot;Production Studios&quot;, each assigned to different games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/775/775450p1.html |title=The Future of PSP – Capcom |author=Nix, Marc |date=March 23, 2007 |work=[[IGN.com]] |publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc |accessdate=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;annualreport2009&quot; /&gt; Starting in 2002, the development process were reformed to better share technologies and expertise, and all of the individual studios were gradually restructured into bigger departments responsible for different tasks.&lt;ref name=&quot;annualreport2009&quot; /&gt; While there are self-contained departments for the creation of arcade, pachinko and pachislo, online, and mobile games, the Consumer Games R&amp;D Division instead is an amalgamation of subsections in charge of various game development stages.&lt;ref name=&quot;annualreport2009&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/interview/2008/ |title=Developer Interview 2008 |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;annualreport2007&quot; /&gt; In addition to these internal teams, Capcom also commissions outside development studios to ensure a steady output of titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/interview/2009/vol08/index.html |title=Developer Interview 2009: vol08.Keiji Inafune |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/interview/2010/vol01/03.html |title=Developer Interview 2010: vol01.Jun Takeuchi |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following bad sales of ''[[Dark Void]]'' and ''[[Bionic Commando (2009 video game)|Bionic Commando]]'', the company's management has decided to limit outsourcing to sequels and newer versions of installments in existing franchises, reserving the development of original titles for its in-house teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5540859/bionic-commando-dark-void-last-straws-for-capcom |title=Bionic Commando, Dark Void Last Straws For Capcom |author=Orsini, Lauren |date=May 17, 2010 |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of games, budgets, and platforms supported are decided upon in development approval meetings, attended by the company management and the Marketing, Sales, and Quality Control Departments.&lt;ref name=&quot;annualreport2009&quot; /&gt;

===Branches and subsidiaries===
Apart from the head office and R&amp;D building of Capcom Co., Ltd. located in [[Osaka]], the Japanese parent company also has branch offices in [[Tokyo]] and [[Iga, Mie|Iga]].&lt;ref name=&quot;capcomgroup&quot; /&gt; The international Capcom Group currently encompasses 15 subsidiaries in Japan, North America, Europe, and East Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;capcomgroup&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;annualreport2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/2009annual/e2009annual.pdf |title=Annual Report 2009 |date=September 17, 2009 |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd |accessdate=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affiliated companies include Koko Capcom Co., Ltd. in South Korea, Street Fighter Film, LLC in the United States, and Dellgamadas Co., Ltd.&lt;ref name=&quot;annualreport2009&quot; /&gt;

{{History of Cambodia}}
[[Carbon 14 dating]] of a cave at [[Laang Spean]] in northwest [[Cambodia]] reveals people who made pots were living in Cambodia as early as 4200 BCE (Before the Common Era).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandlerp13&quot;&gt;David Chandler, ''A History of Cambodia'' (Westview Publishers: Boulder Colorado, 2008) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Further archaeological evidence indicates that other parts of the region now called [[Cambodia]] were inhabited from around 1000-2000 BCE by a [[Neolithic]] culture. Skulls and human bones found at Samrong Sen date from 1500 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandlerp13&quot;/&gt; These people may have migrated from South Eastern China to the Indochinese Peninsula. Scholars trace the first cultivation of rice and the first bronze making in Southeast Asia to these people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandlerp13&quot;/&gt; By the 1st century CE, the inhabitants had developed relatively stable, organized societies and spoke languages very much related to the Cambodian or Khmer of the present day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandlerp13&quot;/&gt; The culture and technical skills of these people of the 1st century in the CE far surpassed the primitive stage. The most advanced groups lived along the coast and in the lower Mekong River valley and delta regions in houses constructed on stilts where they cultivated rice, fished and kept domesticated animals. Recent research has unlocked the discovery of artificial circular [[earthworks (archeology)|earthworks]] dating to Cambodia's [[Neolithic]] era.[http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/asian_perspectives/v039/39.1albrecht.pdf 1]
The [[Khmer people]] were one of the first inhabitants of South East Asia. They were also among the first in [[South East Asia]] to adopt religious ideas and political institutions from [[Indian subcontinent|India]] and to establish centralized kingdoms surrounding large territories. The earliest known kingdom in the area, [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]], flourished from around the first to the 6th century. This was succeeded by [[Chenla]], which controlled large parts of modern [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], and [[Thailand]].
__TOC__
{{Clear}}

==Funan Kingdom==
{{Main|Kingdom of Funan}}
[[Image:FunanMap001.jpg|thumb|150px|Map of Funan at around 3rd century]]
The [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]]ese Empire rose to eminence from its affluent and powerful home city of [[Oc Eo]] (in nowadays [[Vietnam]]), known in the [[Roman Empire]] as [[Kattigara]], meaning the Renowned City. Contacts with the distant Roman Empire are evidenced by the fact that Roman coins have been found at archeological sites dating from the 2nd and 3rd centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandlerp19&quot;&gt;David Chandler, ''A History of Camboida,'' p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the foreign trade of the Funan Empire was carried on much closer to home with [[India]], especially the [[Bengal]] area of India. Trade with India commenced well before 500 BCE (before the widespread use of [[Sanskrit]] as a language in India).&lt;ref&gt;Percival Spear, ''India: A Modern History'' (University of Michigan Press: Ann Arbor, 1961) p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Indian trade came the Indianization of the culture of Funan and the religion of Hinduism. Funan and its succeeding societies which occupied this section of Southeast Asia would remain Hindu in religion for about 900 years. Some cultural features would last much longer. 

The empire reached its greatest extent under the rule of Fan Shih-man in the early 3rd century, extending as far south as [[Malaysia]] and as far west as [[Burma]]. The Funanese established a strong system of mercantilism and commercial monopolies that would become a pattern for empires in the region. Exports from the Funan Empire were largely forest products and precious metals—including gold elephants, ivory, rhinoceros horn, kingfisher feathers, wild spices like cardamom, lacquer hides and aromatic wood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandlerp19&quot;/&gt; Fan Shih-man expanded the fleet and improved the Funanese bureaucracy, creating a quasi-feudal pattern that left local customs and identities largely intact, particularly in the empire's farther reaches.

==Chenla Kingdom==
{{Main|Chenla}}
The Khmers, vassals of Funan had reached the [[Mekong River]] from the northern [[Menam River]] via the [[Mun River]] Valley. [[Chenla]], their first independent state developed out of Funanese influence.

Ancient Chinese records mention two kings, [[Shrutavarman]] and [[Shreshthavarman]] who ruled at the capital [[Shreshthapura]] located in modern day southern Laos. The immense influence on the identity of Cambodia to come was wrought by the Khmer Kingdom of [[Bhavapura]], in the modern day Cambodian city of [[Kompong Thom]]. Its legacy was its most important sovereign, [[Ishanavarman]] who completely conquered the kingdom of Funan during 612-628. He chose his new capital at the [[Sambor Prei Kuk]], naming it Ishanapura.

After the death of [[Jayavarman I]] in 681, turmoil came upon the kingdom and at the start of the 8th century, the kingdom broke up into many principalities. [[Pushkaraksha]], the ruler of [[Shambhupura]] announced himself as king of the entire [[Kambuja]]. Chinese chronicles proclaim that in the 8th century, Chenla was split into land Chenla and water Chenla. During this time, [[Shambhuvarman]] son of Pushkaraksha controlled most of water Chenla until the 8th century which the [[Malayans]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] dominated over many Khmer principalities.

==Khmer Empire==
{{Main|Khmer Empire}}
[[Image:Map-of-southeast-asia 900 CE.png|thumb|200px|Map of South-east Asia circa 900 CE, showing the [[Khmer Empire]] in red, [[Champa]] in yellow and [[Haripunjaya]] in light Green plus additional surrounding states.]]

The golden age of Khmer civilization, however, was the period from the 9th to the 13th centuries, when Khmer Empire, which gave Kampuchea, or Cambodia, its name, ruled large territories from its capital in the region of Angkor in western Cambodia.

Legend has it that in 802 CE, [[Jayavarman II]], king of the Khmers, first came to the Kuhlen hills, the future site of Angkor Wat.&lt;ref&gt;David Chandler, ''A History of Cambodia'' (Westview Publishers: Boulder Colorado, 2008) p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, under [[Jayavarman VII of Kambuja|Jayavarman VII]] (1181–ca. 1218), Khmer reached its zenith of political power and cultural creativity. Jayavarman VII gained power and territory in a series of successful wars. Khmer conquests were almost unstoppable as they raided home cities of powerful seafaring Chams. However, territorial expansion stopped after a defeat by [[Dai Viet]]. The battle also witnessed Suryavarman II's death. Following Jayavarman VII's death, Khmer experienced a gradual decline. Important factors were the aggressiveness of neighboring peoples (especially the [[Thai people|Thai, or Siamese]]), chronic interdynastic strife, and the gradual deterioration of the complex irrigation system that had ensured rice surpluses. The [[Angkor]]ian monarchy survived until 1431, when the Thai captured [[Angkor Thom]] and the Cambodian king fled to the southern part of the country.

==Dark Ages of Cambodia==
{{Main|Dark ages of Cambodia}}
[[Image:VietnamTrinhNguyen1.gif|thumb|150px|Cambodia during the Dark Ages]]
The 15th to the 19th centuries were a period of continued decline and territorial loss. Cambodia enjoyed a brief period of prosperity during the 16th century because its kings, who built their capitals in the region southeast of the [[Tonle Sap]] along the [[Mekong River]], promoted trade with other parts of Asia. This was the period when [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] adventurers and missionaries first visited the country. However, the Thai conquest of the new capital at [[Lovek]] in 1594 marked a downturn in the country's fortunes and Cambodia. Becoming a pawn in power struggles between its two increasingly powerful neighbors, Siam and Vietnam. Cambodia remained a protectorate of Siam. Vietnam's settlement of the [[Mekong Delta]] led to its annexation of that area at the end of the 17th century. Vietnam employed a strategy similar to those of North American pilgrims and pioneers: settle and claim. Such foreign encroachments continued through the first half of the 19th century. A successful invasion by Vietnam further limited Thai protectorship in Cambodia and established the kingdom under full Vietnamese suzerainty.

==French colonial period==
{{Main|French protectorate of Cambodia|French Indochina}}
[[Image:Indochine française (1913).jpg‎|thumb|left|200px|French Indochina in 1913.]]
In 1863, [[Norodom of Cambodia|King Norodom]] signed an agreement with the [[France|French]] to establish a protectorate over his kingdom. The state gradually came under French colonial domination.

[[Image:IndoChina1886.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Indochina]] - 1886]]

During [[World War II]], the [[Japan]]ese allowed the French government (based at [[Vichy]]) that collaborated with the republican opponents and attempted to negotiate acceptable terms for independence from the French.

Cambodia's situation at the end of the war was chaotic. The [[Free French]], under General [[Charles de Gaulle]], were determined to recover Indochina, though they offered Cambodia and the other Inchochinese protectorates a carefully circumscribed measure of self-government. Convinced that they had a &quot;[[civilizing mission]]&quot;, they envisioned Indochina's participation in a French Union of former colonies that shared the common experience of French culture.

Sihanouk's &quot;royal crusade for independence&quot; resulted in grudging French acquiescence to his demands for a transfer of sovereignty. A partial agreement was struck in October 1953. Sihanouk then declared that independence had been achieved and returned in triumph to [[Phnom Penh]].

==First administration of Sihanouk 1953-1970==
{{Main|Kingdom of Cambodia (1953–1970)}}
As a result of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, Cambodia was able to bring about the withdrawal of the [[Viet Minh]] troops from its territory and to withstand any residual impingement upon its sovereignty by external powers.

Neutrality was the central element of Cambodian foreign policy during the 1950s and 1960s. By the mid-1960s, parts of Cambodia's eastern provinces were serving as bases for North Vietnamese Army and [[Viet Cong]] (NVA/VC) forces operating against South Vietnam, and the port of [[Sihanoukville]] was being used to supply them. As NVA/VC activity grew, the United States and [[South Vietnam]] became concerned, and in 1969, the United States began a 14 month long series of bombing raids targeted at NVA/VC elements, contributing to destabilization. Prince Sihanouk, fearing that the conflict between communist North Vietnam and South Vietnam might spill over to Cambodia, steadfastly opposed the bombing campaign by the United States along the Vietnam-Cambodia border and inside Cambodian territory. Prince Sihanouk wanted Cambodia to stay out of the North Vietnam-South Vietnam conflict and was very critical of the United States government and its allies (the South Vietnamese government). The United States claims that the bombing campaign took place no further than ten, and later twenty miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) inside the Cambodian border, areas where the Cambodian population had been evicted by the NVA.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Phillip B. ''Vietnam at War: The History 1946–1975''. 1988. P. 593&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Cite supports entire paragraph--&gt; Prince Sihanouk, facing internal struggles of his own, due to the rise of the Khmer Rouge, did not want Cambodia to be involved in the conflict. Sihanouk wanted the United States and its allies (South Vietnam) to keep the war away from the Cambodian border. Not only did Sihanouk try to keep the communist North Vietnamese soldiers from entering Cambodia territory, but he also did not allow the United States to use Cambodian air space and airports for military purposes. This upset the United States greatly. The United States saw Prince Sihanouk as a North Vietnamese sympathizer and a thorn on the United States, and using the CIA, it began plans to get rid of Sihanouk.&lt;ref&gt;{{worldhistory|quote=P. 1012|section=4084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1960s, domestic Cambodian politics became polarized. Opposition to the government grew within the middle class and leftists including Paris-educated leaders like [[Son Sen]], [[Ieng Sary]], and Saloth Sar (later known as [[Pol Pot]]), who led an [[insurgency]] under the clandestine Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK). Sihanouk called these insurgents the [[Khmer Rouge]], literally the &quot;Red Khmer.&quot; But the 1966 national assembly elections showed a significant swing to the right, and General [[Lon Nol]] formed a new government, which lasted until 1967. During 1968 and 1969, the insurgency worsened. In August 1969, Lon Nol formed a new government. Prince Sihanouk went abroad for medical reasons in January 1970.

==Khmer Republic and the War==
[[File:Asien Bd1.jpg|350px|thumb|Map of [[Asia]] in 1890]]
{{Main|Civil War in Cambodia}}
{{Ref improve section|date=January 2010}}
In March 1970, while Prince Sihanouk was absent, General Lon Nol deposed Prince Sihanouk in a coup d'état in the early hours of March 18, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Short, ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'' p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been alleged that this coup was not planned by the United States Central Intelligence Agency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shortp196&quot;&gt;Philip Short, ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'' (Henry Holt &amp; Co.: New York, 2004) p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Still while abroad, Prince Sihanouk had been warned by both the leaders in Soviet Union and in Peking, that he should return home, immediately without delay.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shortp196&quot;/&gt; As early as March 12, 1970, the C.I.A. Station Chief told Washington that based on communications from Sirik Matak, Lon Nol's cousin, that &quot;the (Cambodian) army was ready for a coup.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Short, ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'' (Henry Holt &amp; Co.: New York, 2004) p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Lon Nol assumed the power after the military coup and immediately allied Cambodia with the United States. Immediately, Son Ngoc Thanh, an opponent of Pol Pot, announced his support for the new government. On October 9, the Cambodian monarchy was abolished, and the country was renamed the Khmer Republic.

Hanoi rejected the new republic's request for the withdrawal of NVA troops. 2,000–4,000 Cambodians who had gone to North Vietnam in 1954 reentered Cambodia, backed by North Vietnamese soldiers. In response, the United States moved to provide material assistance to the new government's armed forces, which were engaged against both CPK insurgents and NVA forces.

On April 1970, US President Nixon announced to the American public that US and South Vietnamese ground forces had entered Cambodia in a campaign aimed at destroying NVA base areas in Cambodia (see [[Cambodian Incursion]]).&lt;ref&gt;Philip Short, ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'' (Henry Holt &amp; Co.: New York, 2004) p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The US had already been bombing Cambodia for well over a year by that point.

Although a considerable quantity of equipment was seized or destroyed by US and South Vietnamese forces, containment of North Vietnamese forces proved elusive. The North Vietnamese moved deeper into Cambodia to avoid US and South Vietnamese raids. NVA units overran many Cambodian army positions while the CPK expanded their small-scale attacks on lines of communication.

The Khmer Republic's leadership was plagued by disunity among its three principal figures: Lon Nol, Sihanouk's cousin [[Sirik Matak]], and National Assembly leader [[In Tam]]. Lon Nol remained in power in part because none of the others were prepared to take his place. In 1972, a constitution was adopted, a parliament elected, and Lon Nol became president. But disunity, the problems of transforming a 30,000-man army into a national combat force of more than 200,000 men, and spreading corruption weakened the civilian administration and army.

The Communist insurgency inside Cambodia continued to grow, aided by supplies and military support from North Vietnam. [[Pol Pot]] and [[Ieng Sary]] asserted their dominance over the Vietnamese-trained communists, many of whom were purged. At the same time, the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]] forces became stronger and more independent of their Vietnamese patrons. By 1973, the CPK were fighting battles against government forces with little or no North Vietnamese troop support, and they controlled nearly 60% of Cambodia's territory and 25% of its population.

The government made three unsuccessful attempts to enter into negotiations with the insurgents, but by 1974, the CPK were operating openly as divisions, and some of the NVA combat forces had moved into South Vietnam. Lon Nol's control was reduced to small enclaves around the cities and main transportation routes. More than 2 million refugees from the war lived in [[Phnom Penh]] and other cities.

On New Year's Day 1975, Communist troops launched an offensive which, in 117 days of the hardest fighting of the war, collapsed the Khmer Republic. Simultaneous attacks around the perimeter of Phnom Penh pinned down Republican forces, while other CPK units overran fire bases controlling the vital lower Mekong resupply route. A US-funded airlift of ammunition and rice ended when Congress refused additional aid for Cambodia. The Lon Nol government in Phnom Penh surrendered on April 17, 1975, just five (5) days after the US mission evacuated Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Short, ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'' p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Democratic Kampuchea (Khmer Rouge Era)==
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2008}}
{{Main|Democratic Kampuchea|Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia}}
Immediately after its victory, the CPK ordered the evacuation of all cities and towns, sending the entire urban population into the countryside to work as farmers, as the CPK was trying to reshape society into a model that Pol Pot had conceived.

Thousands starved or died of disease during the evacuation and its aftermath. Many of those forced to evacuate the cities were resettled in newly created villages, which lacked food, agricultural implements, and medical care. Many who lived in cities had lost the skills necessary for survival in an agrarian environment. Thousands starved before the first harvest. Hunger and malnutrition&amp;mdash;bordering on starvation&amp;mdash;were constant during those years. Most military and civilian leaders of the former regime who failed to disguise their pasts were executed.

Within the CPK, the Paris-educated leadership&amp;mdash;[[Pol Pot]], [[Ieng Sary]], [[Nuon Chea]], and [[Son Sen]]&amp;mdash;were in control. A new constitution in January 1976 established Democratic Kampuchea as a Communist People's Republic, and a 250-member Assembly of the Representatives of the People of Kampuchea (PRA) was selected in March to choose the collective leadership of a State Presidium, the chairman of which became the head of state.

Prince Sihanouk resigned as head of state on April 4. On April 14, after its first session, the PRA announced that [[Khieu Samphan]] would chair the State Presidium for a 5-year term. It also picked a 15-member cabinet headed by Pol Pot as prime minister. Prince Sihanouk was put under virtual house arrest.

The new government sought to completely restructure Cambodian society. Remnants of the old society were abolished and religion, particularly [[Buddhism]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], was suppressed. Agriculture was collectivized, and the surviving part of the industrial base was abandoned or placed under state control. Cambodia had neither a currency nor a banking system.

Life in 'Democratic Kampuchea' was strict and brutal. In many areas of the country people were rounded up and executed for speaking a foreign language, wearing glasses, scavenging for food, and even crying for dead loved ones. Former businessmen and bureaucrats were hunted down and killed along with their entire families; the Khmer Rouge feared that they held beliefs that could lead them to oppose their regime. A few Khmer Rouge loyalists were even killed for failing to find enough 'counter-revolutionaries' to execute.

Solid estimates of the numbers who died between 1975 and 1979 are not available, but it is likely that hundreds of thousands were executed by the regime. Hundreds of thousands died of starvation and disease (both under the CPK and during the Vietnamese invasion in 1978). Some estimates of the dead range from 1 to 3 million, out of a 1975 population estimated at 7.3 million. The CIA estimated 50,000&amp;ndash;100,000 were executed in a single purge by the state and that 1.5 million (from a range of 1.2 to 1.8 million) were killed by the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mekong.net/cambodia/demcat.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic Kampuchea's relations with [[Vietnam]] and [[Thailand]] worsened rapidly as a result of border clashes and ideological differences. While communist, the CPK was fiercely nationalistic, and most of its members who had lived in Vietnam were purged. Democratic Kampuchea established close ties with the [[People's Republic of China]], and the Cambodian-Vietnamese conflict became part of the Sino-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rivalry, with Moscow backing Vietnam. Border clashes worsened when the Democratic Kampuchea military attacked villages in Vietnam. The regime broke off relations with Hanoi in December 1977, protesting Vietnam's alleged attempt to create an Indochina Federation. In mid-1978, Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia, advancing about {{convert|30|mi|km}} before the arrival of the rainy season.

The reasons for Chinese support of the CPK was to prevent a pan-Indochina movement, and maintain Chinese military superiority in the region. The Soviet Union supported a strong Vietnam to maintain a second front against China in case of hostilities and to prevent further Chinese expansion. Since Stalin's death, relations between Mao-controlled China and the Soviet Union had been lukewarm at best. In February to March 1979, China and Vietnam would fight the brief [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] over the issue.

In December 1978, Vietnam announced formation of the [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation]] (KUFNS) under [[Heng Samrin]], a former DK division commander. It was composed of Khmer Communists who had remained in Vietnam after 1975 and officials from the eastern sector&amp;mdash;like Heng Samrin and Hun Sen&amp;mdash;who had fled to Vietnam from Cambodia in 1978. In late December 1978, Vietnamese forces launched a full invasion of Cambodia, capturing Phnom Penh on January 7, 1979 and driving the remnants of Democratic Kampuchea's army westward toward Thailand.

==People's Republic of Kampuchea==
{{Main|Cambodia under Vietnamese occupation (1979–1989)}}
On January 10, 1979, after the [[Vietnam|Vietnamese army]] and the [[KUFNS]] invaded Cambodia, the new [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] (PRK) was established with Heng Samrin as head of state. [[Pol Pot]]'s [[Khmer Rouge]] forces retreated rapidly to the [[Thailand|Thai]] border. The Khmer Rouge and the PRK began a costly struggle that played into the hands of the larger powers [[China]], the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. A civil war was imposed on impoverished Cambodia that displaced 600,000 Cambodians to refugee camps along the border between Thailand and Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Chandler, A history of Cambodia, Westview Press; Allen &amp; Unwin, Boulder, Sydney, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modern Cambodia#Peace efforts and the free elections|Peace efforts]] began in Paris in 1989 under the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea#Transition: State of Cambodia (1989 - 1993)|State of Cambodia]], culminating two years later in October 1991 in a comprehensive peace settlement. The [[United Nations]] was given a mandate to enforce a ceasefire, and deal with refugees and disarmament known as the [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] (UNTAC).&lt;ref name=&quot;USDOS3&quot;&gt;US Department of State. [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2732.htm Country Profile of Cambodia.]. Retrieved July 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Cambodia: 1993-present==
{{Main|Modern Cambodia|l1=Modern Cambodia (1990&amp;ndash;present)}}

On October 23, 1991, the Paris Conference reconvened to sign a comprehensive settlement giving the UN full authority to supervise a cease-fire, repatriate the displaced Khmer along the border with Thailand, disarm and demobilize the factional armies, and prepare the country for free and fair elections. Prince Sihanouk, President of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia (SNC), and other members of the SNC returned to Phnom Penh in November 1991, to begin the resettlement process in Cambodia. The UN Advance Mission for Cambodia (UNAMIC) was deployed at the same time to maintain liaison among the factions and begin demining operations to expedite the repatriation of approximately 370,000 Cambodians from Thailand.

On March 16, 1992, the [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia|UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] (UNTAC) arrived in Cambodia to begin implementation of the UN Settlement Plan. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees began fullscale repatriation in March 1992. UNTAC grew into a 22,000-strong civilian and military peacekeeping force to conduct free and fair elections for a constituent assembly.

Over 4 million Cambodians (about 90% of eligible voters) participated in the May 1993 elections, although the Khmer Rouge or [[Party of Democratic Kampuchea]] (PDK), whose forces were never actually disarmed or demobilized, barred some people from participating. [[Norodom Ranariddh|Prince Ranariddh]]'s royalist [[Funcinpec|FUNCINPEC Party]] was the top vote recipient with 45.5% of the vote, followed by Hun Sen's [[Cambodian People's Party]] and the [[Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party]], respectively. FUNCINPEC then entered into a coalition with the other parties that had participated in the election. The parties represented in the 120-member assembly proceeded to draft and approve a new constitution, which was promulgated September 24, 1993. It established a multiparty liberal democracy in the framework of a constitutional monarchy, with the former Prince Sihanouk elevated to King. Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen became First and Second Prime Ministers, respectively, in the Royal Cambodian Government (RGC). The constitution provides for a wide range of internationally recognized human rights.

On October 4, 2004, the Cambodian National Assembly ratified an agreement with the United Nations on the establishment of a tribunal to try senior leaders responsible for the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge. Donor countries have pledged the $43 million international share of the three-year tribunal budget, while the Cambodian government’s share of the budget is $13.3 million. The tribunal started trials of senior Khmer Rouge leaders in 2008.

'''[[Cambodia]]''' is a country in [[Southeastern Asia]], bordering the [[Gulf of Thailand]], between [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Laos]].  Its approximate geographical coordinates are {{coord|13|N|105|E|}}.  Its 2,572&amp;nbsp;km border is split among Vietnam (1,228&amp;nbsp;km), Thailand (803&amp;nbsp;km) and Laos (541&amp;nbsp;km), as well as 443&amp;nbsp;km of coastline. Cambodia covers 181,040 square kilometres in the southwestern part of the Indochina peninsula. It lies completely within the tropics; its southernmost points are only slightly more than 10° above the equator. Roughly square in shape, the country is bounded on the north by Thailand and by Laos, on the east and southeast by Vietnam, and on the west by the Gulf of Thailand and by Thailand. Much of the country's area consists of rolling plains. Dominant features are the large, almost centrally located, [[Tonle Sap]] (Great Lake) and the [[Mekong River]], which traverses the country from north to south and is the 12th longest river in the world.

The climate is monsoonal and has marked wet and dry seasons of relatively equal length. Both temperature and humidity generally are high throughout the year. Forest covers about two-thirds of the country, but it has been somewhat degraded in the more readily accessible areas by burning (a method called slash-and-burn agriculture), and by shifting agriculture.

==Topography==
[[Image:Cambodia 1997 CIA map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Detailed map of Cambodia]]
[[Image:Cambodia Topography.png|thumb|right|300px|Topography]]
Cambodia falls within several well-defined geographic regions. The largest part of the country, about 75 percent, consists of the Tonle Sap Basin and the Mekong Lowlands. To the southeast of this great basin is the Mekong Delta, which extends through Vietnam to the [[South China Sea]]. The basin and delta regions are rimmed with mountain ranges to the southwest by the [[Cardamom Mountains]] and the [[Elephant Range]] and to the north by the [[Dangrek Mountains]]. Higher land to the northeast and to the east merges into the Central Highlands of southern Vietnam.

The Tonle Sap Basin-Mekong Lowlands region consists chiefly of plains with elevations generally of less than 100 meters. As the elevation increases, the terrain becomes more rolling and dissected.

The Cardamom Mountains in the southwest, oriented generally in a northwest-southeast direction, rise to more than 1,500 meters. The highest mountain in Cambodia--[[Phnom Aural]], at 1,771 meters--is in the eastern part of this range. The Elephant Range, an extension running toward the south and the southeast from the Cardamom Mountains, rises to elevations of between 500 and 1,000 meters. These two ranges are bordered on the west by a narrow coastal plain that contains [[Kampong Saom Bay]], which faces the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. This area was largely isolated until the opening of the port of [[Kampong Saom]] (formerly called [[Sihanoukville]]) and the construction of a road and railroad connecting Kampong Saom, [[Kampot (city)|Kampot]], [[Takev]], and [[Phnom Penh]] in the 1960s.

The Dangrek Mountains at the northern rim of the Tonle Sap Basin consist of a steep escarpment with an average elevation of about 500 meters, the highest points of which reach more than 700 meters. The escarpment faces southward and is the southern edge of the [[Korat Plateau]] in Thailand. The watershed along the escarpment marks the boundary between Thailand and Cambodia. The main road through a pass in the Dangrek Mountains at [[O Smach]] connects northwestern Cambodia with Thailand. Despite this road and those running through a few other passes, in general the escarpment impedes easy communication between the two countries. Between the western part of the Dangrek and the northern part of the Cardamom ranges, however, lies an extension of the Tonle Sap Basin that merges into lowlands in Thailand, which allows easy access from the border to Bangkok.

The Mekong Valley, which offers a communication route between Cambodia and Laos, separates the eastern end of the Dangrek Mountains and the northeastern highlands. To the southeast, the basin joins the Mekong Delta, which, extending into Vietnam, provides both water and land communications between the two countries.

==Climate==
''See also: [[Cambodia#Climate|Climate]]''

Cambodia's climate, like that of the rest of Southeast Asia is dominated by [[monsoon]]s, which are known as tropical wet and dry because of the distinctly marked seasonal differences. The monsoonal airflows are caused by annual alternating high pressure and low pressure over the Central Asian landmass. In summer, moisture-laden air--the southwest monsoon--is drawn landward from the Indian Ocean. . The flow is reversed during the winter, and the northeast monsoon sends back dry air. The southwest monsoon brings the rainy season from mid-May to mid-September or to early October, and the northeast monsoon flow of drier and cooler air lasts from early November to March. The southern third of the country has a two-month dry season; the northern two-thirds, a four-month one. Short transitional periods, which are marked by some difference in humidity but by little change in temperature, intervene between the alternating seasons. Temperatures are fairly uniform throughout the Tonle Sap Basin area, with only small variations from the average annual mean of around {{convert|25|°C|1}}. The maximum mean is about {{convert|28.0|°C|1}}; the minimum mean, about {{convert|22.98|°C}}. Maximum temperatures of higher than {{convert|32|°C|1}}, however, are common and, just before the start of the rainy season, they may rise to more than {{convert|38|°C|1}}. Minimum temperatures rarely fall below {{convert|10|°C}}. January is the coolest month, and April is the warmest. Tropical cyclones that often devastate coastal Vietnam rarely cause damage in Cambodia.

The total annual rainfall average is between {{convert|1000|and|1500|mm|in|1|sp=us}}, and the heaviest amounts fall in the southeast. Rainfall from April to September in the Tonle Sap Basin-Mekong Lowlands area averages {{convert|1300|to|1500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} annually, but the amount varies considerably from year to year. Rainfall around the basin increases with elevation. It is heaviest in the mountains along the coast in the southwest, which receive from {{convert|2500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} to more than {{convert|5000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} of precipitation annually as the southwest monsoon reaches the coast. This area of greatest rainfall, however, drains mostly to the sea; only a small quantity goes into the rivers flowing into the basin. The relative humidity is high at night throughout the year; usually it exceeds 90 percent. During the daytime in the dry season, humidity averages about 50 percent or slightly lower, but it may remain about 60 percent in the rainy period.

==Drainage==
Except for the smaller rivers in the southeast, most of the major rivers and river systems in Cambodia drain into the Tonle Sap or into the Mekong River. The Cardamom Mountains and Elephant Range form a separate drainage divide. To the east the rivers flow into the Tonle Sap, while on the west they flow into the Gulf of Thailand. Toward the southern end of the Elephant Mountains, however, because of the topography, some small rivers flow southward on the eastern side of the divide.

The Mekong River in Cambodia flows southward from the Cambodia-Laos border to a point below Kracheh city, where it turns west for about 50 kilometers and then turns southwest to Phnom Penh. Extensive rapids run above Kracheh city. From Kampong Cham the gradient slopes very gently, and inundation of areas along the river occurs at flood stage--June through November--through breaks in the natural levees that have built up along its course. At Phnom Penh four major water courses meet at a point called the [[Chattomukh]] (Four Faces). The Mekong River flows in from the northeast and the Tonle Sab--a river emanating from the Tonle Sap--flows in from the northwest. They divide into two parallel channels, the Mekong River proper and the Basak River, and flow independently through the delta areas of Cambodia and Vietnam to the South China Sea.

The flow of water into the Tonle Sap is seasonal. In September or in October, the flow of the Mekong River, fed by monsoon rains, increases to a point where its outlets through the delta cannot handle the enormous volume of water. At this point, the water pushes northward up the Tonle Sab and empties into the Tonle Sap, thereby increasing the size of the lake from about 2,590 square kilometers to about 24,605 square kilometers at the height of the flooding. After the Mekong's waters crest--when its downstream channels can handle the volume of water--the flow reverses, and water flows out of the engorged lake.

As the level of the Tonle Sap retreats, it deposits a new layer of sediment. The annual flooding, combined with poor drainage immediately around the lake, transforms the surrounding area into marshlands unusable for agricultural purposes during the dry season. The sediment deposited into the lake during the Mekong's flood stage appears to be greater than the quantity carried away later by the Tonle Sap River. Gradual silting of the lake would seem to be occurring; during low-water level, it is only about 1.5 meters deep, while at flood stage it is between 10 and 15 meters deep.

==Regional divisions==
{{seealso|Administrative divisions of Cambodia}}
Cambodia's boundaries were for the most part based upon those recognized by France and by neighboring countries during the colonial period. The 800-kilometre boundary with Thailand, coincides with a natural feature, the watershed of the Dangrek Mountains, only in its northern sector. The 541-kilometer border with Laos and the 1,228-kilometer border with Vietnam result largely from French administrative decisions and do not follow major natural features. Border disputes have broken out in the past between Cambodia and Thailand as well as between Cambodia and Vietnam.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Cambodia]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

Between 1874 and 1921, the total population of [[Cambodia]] increased from about 946,000 to 2.4 million. By 1950 it had increased to between 3,710,107 and 4,073,967, and in 1962 it had reached 5.7 million. From the 1960s until 1975, the population of Cambodia increased by about 2.2 % yearly, the lowest increase in [[Southeast Asia]]. By 1975 when the [[Khmer Rouge]] took power, it was estimated at 7.3 million. Of this total an estimated one to two million reportedly died between 1975 and 1978. In 1981, the PRK gave the official population figure as nearly 6.7 million, although approximately 6.3 million to 6.4 million is probably more accurate. The average annual rate of population growth from 1978 to 1985 was 2.3% (see table 2, Appendix A). In 1959, [[Life expectancy]] at birth was 44.2 years for males and 43.3 years for females. By 1970, life expectancy had increased by about 2.5 years since 1945. The greater [[longevity]] for females apparently reflected improved health practices during [[maternity]] and childbirth.

In 1959, about 45% of the population was under 15 years of age. By 1962, this had increased slightly to 46 %. In 1962, an estimated 52 % of the population was between 15 and 64 years of age, while 2% were older than 65. The percentage of males and females in the three groups was almost the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Cambodia}}
The '''Politics of Cambodia''' takes place in a framework of a [[constitutional monarchy]], whereby the [[Prime Minister of Cambodia|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]] and a [[monarchy|Monarch]] is [[head of state]]. The kingdom formally takes place according to the nation's [[constitution]] (enacted in 1993) in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the two chambers of parliament, the [[National Assembly of Cambodia|National Assembly]] and the [[Senate of Cambodia|Senate]]

The [[Prime Minister of Cambodia]] is a representative from the ruling party of the National Assembly. He or she is appointed by the King on the recommendation of the President and Vice Presidents of the National Assembly.  In order for a person to become Prime Minister, he or she must first be given a vote of confidence by the National Assembly.

The Prime Minister is officially the [[Head of Government]] in Cambodia. Upon entry into office, he or she appoints a Council of Ministers who are responsible to the Prime Minister.  Officially, the Prime Minister's duties include chairing meetings of the Council of Ministers (Cambodia's version of a [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]) and appointing and leading a government. The Prime Minister and his government make up Cambodia's [[executive (government)|executive branch]] of government.

The current Prime Minister is [[Cambodian People's Party]] (CPP) member [[Hun Sen]]. He has held this position since the criticized 1998 election, one year after the CPP staged a bloody [[coup d'état|coup]] in Phnom Penh&lt;ref&gt;http://cambodia.ohchr.org/Documents/Statements%20and%20Speeches/English/40.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hri.org/docs/statedep/1997/97-07-08.std.html&lt;/ref&gt; to overthrow elected Prime Minister Prince [[Norodom Ranariddh]], president of the [[FUNCINPEC]] party.

==Legislative branch==
The [[legislature|legislative branch]] of the Cambodian government is made up of a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]].

*The '''[[National Assembly of Cambodia]]''' (''Radhsaphea ney Preah Reacheanachak Kampuchea'') has 123 members, elected for a five-year term by [[proportional representation]].
*The '''[[Senate of Cambodia|Senate]]''' (''Protsaphea ney Preah Reacheanachak Kampuchea'') has 61 members.  Two of these members are appointed by the King, two are elected by the lower house of the government, and the remaining fifty-seven are elected popularly by &quot;functional constituencies.&quot;  Members in this house serve a six-year term.

The official duty of the Parliament is to legislate and make laws.  Bills passed by the Parliament are given to the King who gives the proposed bills [[Royal Assent]].  The King does not have [[veto]] power over bills passed by the National Assembly and thus, cannot withhold Royal Assent.  The National Assembly also has the power to dismiss the Prime Minister and his government by a two-thirds [[vote of no confidence]].

===Senate===
The upper house of the Cambodian legislature is called the ''Senate''. It consists of sixty-one members.  Two of these members are appointed by the King, two are elected by the lower house of the government, and the remaining fifty-seven are elected popularly by electors from provincial and local governments, in a similar fashion to the [[Senate of France]]. Members in this house serve six year term.

Elections were last held for the Senate in 1999. New elections were supposed to have occurred in 2004, but these elections were initially postponed. On January 22, 2006, 11,352 possible voters went to the poll and chose their candidates. This election was criticized by local monitoring non-governmental organizations as being undemocratic [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4638406.stm].

{{As of|2006}}, the [[Cambodian People's Party]] holds forty-three seats in the Senate, constituting a significant majority. The two other major parties holding seats in the Senate are the [[Funcinpec]] party (holding twelve seats) and the [[Sam Rainsy Party]] (holding two seats).

===National Assembly===

The lower house of the legislature is called the ''National Assembly''.  It is made up of 123 members, elected by popular vote to serve a five-year term.  Elections were last held for the National Assembly in July 2008.

In order to vote in legislative elections, one must be at least eighteen years of age. However, in order to be elected to the Legislature, one must be at least twenty-five years of age.

The National Assembly is led by a President and two Vice Presidents who are selected by Assembly members prior to each session.

{{As of|2009}}, the [[Cambodian People's Party]] holds a majority of the seats in the National Assembly, controlling 90 out of the 123 seats. The [[Sam Rainsy Party]] holds 26 seats and other parties hold the other 7 seats.

==Judicial branch==
The [[judiciary|judicial branch]] is independent from the rest of the government, as specified by the Cambodian [[Constitution]].  The highest court of judicial branch is the [[Supreme Council of the Magistracy]].  Other, lower courts also exist.  Until 1997, Cambodia didn't have a judicial branch of government despite the nation's Constitution requiring one.

The main duties of the judiciary are to prosecute criminals, settle lawsuits, and, most importantly, protect the freedoms and rights of Cambodian citizens. However, in reality, the judicial branch in Cambodia is highly corrupt and often serves as a tool of the executive branch to silence civil society and its leaders [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/cambod12269.htm].

==Monarchy==
Cambodia is a [[constitutional monarchy]], i.e. the King reigns but does not rule, in similar fashion to Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]]. The King is officially the [[Head of State]] and is the symbol of unity and &quot;eternity&quot; of the nation, as defined by Cambodia's constitution.

From September 24, 1993 through October 7, 2004, [[Norodom Sihanouk]] reigned as King, after having previously served in a number of offices (including King) since 1941.  Under the Constitution, the King has no political power, but as Norodom Sihanouk was revered in the country, his word often carried much influence in the government.  For example, in February 2004, he issued a proclamation stating that since Cambodia is a &quot;liberal democracy,&quot; the Kingdom ought to allow [[gay marriage]].  While such views aren't prevalent in Cambodia, his word was respected by his subjects.  The King, often irritated over the conflicts in his government, several times threatened to abdicate unless the political factions in the government got along.  This put pressure on the government to solve their differences.  This influence of the King was often used to help mediate differences in government.

After the abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk in 2004, he was succeeded by his son [[Norodom Sihamoni]].  While the retired King is highly revered in his country for dedicating his lifetime to Cambodia, the current King has spent most of his life abroad in [[France]].  Thus, it remains to be seen whether the new King's views will be as highly respected as his father's.

Although in the [[Khmer language]] there are many words meaning &quot;king&quot;, the word officially used in Khmer (as found in the 1993 Cambodian Constitution) is ''preahmâhaksat'' (Khmer regular script:[[Image:Seihamuni11.png|80px]]), which literally means: ''preah''- (&quot;sacred&quot;, cognate of the Indian word [[Brahmin]]) -''mâha''- (from [[Sanskrit]], meaning &quot;great&quot;, cognate with &quot;maha-&quot; in [[maharaja]]) -''ksat'' (&quot;warrior, ruler&quot;, cognate of the Indian word [[Kshatriya]]).

On the occasion of HM King Norodom Sihanouk's retirement in September 2004, the Cambodian National Assembly coined a new word for the retired king: ''preahmâhaviraksat'' (Khmer regular script:[[Image:Sihanouk6.png|90px]]), where ''vira'' comes from Sanskrit ''vīra'', meaning &quot;brave or eminent man, hero, chief&quot;, cognate of [[Latin]] ''vir'', ''viris'', [[English language|English]] ''virile''. ''Preahmâhaviraksat'' is translated in English as &quot;King-Father&quot; ({{lang-fr|Roi-Père}}), although the word &quot;father&quot; does not appear in the Khmer noun.

As ''preahmâhaviraksat'', Norodom Sihanouk retains many of the prerogatives he formerly held as ''preahmâhaksat'' and is a highly respected and listened-to figure. Thus, in effect, Cambodia can be described as a country with two Kings: the one who is the Head of State, the ''preahmâhaksat'' Norodom Sihamoni, and the one who is not the Head of State, the ''preahmâhaviraksat'' Norodom Sihanouk.

===Succession to the Throne===
Unlike most monarchies, Cambodia's monarchy isn't necessarily [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary]] and the King is not allowed to select his own heir.  Instead, a new King is chosen by a Royal Council of the Throne, consisting of the president of the National Assembly, the Prime Minister, the Chiefs of the orders of Mohanikay and Thammayut, and the First and Second Vice-President of the Assembly.  The Royal Council meets within a week of the King's death or abdication and selects a new King from a pool of candidates with royal blood.

It has been suggested that Cambodia's ability to peacefully appoint a new King shows that Cambodia's government has stabilized incredibly from the situation the country was in during the 1970s (see [[History of Cambodia]]).

ISBN 0-8213-5076-5.&lt;/ref&gt; (In rural areas, first-level administrative divisions are called provinces; in urban areas, they are called municipalities.)  The administrations are a part of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Cambodia)|Ministry of the Interior]] and their members are appointed by the central government.&lt;ref name=wb/&gt; Provincial and municipal administrations participate in the creation of nation budget; they also issue land titles and license businesses.&lt;ref name=wb/&gt;  

Since 2002, commune-level governments ([[commune council]]s) have been composed of members directly elected by commune residents every five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embassyofcambodia.org.nz/March2007/March2007-3.htm Untitled Document&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the allocation of responsibilities between various levels of government is uncertain.&lt;ref name=wb/&gt;  This uncertainty has created additional opportunities for corruption and increased costs for investors.&lt;ref name=wb/&gt;

The '''Economy of Cambodia''' has seen rapid economic progress in the last decade. [[Per capita income]], although rapidly increasing, is low compared with most neighbouring countries. The main domestic activity on which most rural households depend is [[agriculture]] and its related sub-sectors. [[Manufacturing]] output is varied but is not very extensive and is mostly conducted on a small-scale and informal basis. The service sector is heavily concentrated in trading activities and catering-related services. Cambodia has reported that oil and natural gas reserves have been found off-shore.

During 1995, the government implemented firm stabilization policies under difficult circumstances. Overall, macroeconomic performance was good. Growth in 1995 was estimated at 7% because of improved agricultural production ([[rice]] in particular). Strong growth in [[construction]] and services continued. Inflation dropped from 26% in 1994 to only 6% in 1995. Imports increased as a result of the availability of external financing. Exports also increased, due to an increase in log exports. With regard to the budget, both the current and overall deficits were lower than originally targeted.

After four years of solid macroeconomic performance, Cambodia's economy slowed dramatically in 1997-98 due to the regional economic crisis, civil violence, and political infighting. [[Foreign direct investment|Foreign investment]] and [[tourism]] fell off. Also, in 1998 the main harvest was hit by drought. But in 1999, the first full year of peace in 30 years, progress was made on economic reforms and growth resumed at 4%. The long-term development of the economy after decades of war remains a daunting challenge. The population lacks education and productive skills, particularly in the [[poverty]]-ridden countryside, which suffers from an almost total lack of basic [[infrastructure]]. Recurring political instability and corruption within government discourage foreign investment and delay foreign aid. On the brighter side, the government is addressing these issues with assistance from bilateral and multilateral donors.

==History==
{{main|Economic history of Cambodia}}
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

==Foreign aid==

Cambodia's emerging [[democracy]] has received strong international support. Under the mandate carried out by the [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] (UNTAC), $1.72 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (1.72 G$) was spent in an effort to bring basic security, stability and democratic rule to the country. Regarding economic assistance, official donors had pledged $880 million at the [[Ministerial Conference on the Rehabilitation of Cambodia]] (MCRRC) in [[Tokyo]] in June 1992, to which pledges of $119 million were added in September 1993 at the meeting of the [[International Committee on the Reconstruction of Cambodia]] (ICORC) in [[Paris]], and $643 million at the March 1994 ICORC meeting in Tokyo. To date, therefore, the total amount pledged for Cambodia's rehabilitation is approximately 12.3 G$.

2007 GDP (or gross monetarised product GMP)grew an estimated 18.6%, in line with the 2000/06 average of 9.5 percent. Garment exports rose almost 8%, tourist arrivals jumped nearly 35%, and construction activity doubled. With exports decelerating somewhat,  
the 2007 GDP growth was driven by consumption and investment. Foreign direct investment  
(FDI) inflows reached US$600 million (7 percent of GDP), slightly more than the country  
received in official aid. Domestic investment, driven largely by the private sector, accounted  
for 23.4 percent of GDP. Approximately 2,860 new businesses registered for operation in  
2007, a 71 percent increase over 2006.   

Although risks have increased, economic prospects for 2008 remain strong. The projected 7.5  
percent  growth  rate  for  2008  reflects  a  mix  of  growth  in  services  (mainly  tourism)  and  
construction combined with a slowdown in garment exports. Export growth, especially to the  
US,  began  to  slow  in  late  2007  accompanied  by  stiffer  competition  from  Vietnam  and  
emerging risks (slowdown in the US economy and lifting of safeguards on China’s exports).  
Although exports of cash crops have grown fast in recent years, developments in the garment  
industry  have  a  major  impact  on  Cambodia’s  export  performance.  On  the  other  hand,  
Cambodia’s  exporters  might  benefit  from  the  depreciation  of  the  dollar.  Another  risk  is  
uncertainties in the construction sector.

'''Communications in Cambodia''' specifically the postal, telegraph and telegram services are regulated under the [[Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, Cambodia|Ministry of Telecommunications]], transport and posts were restored throughout most of the country in the early 1980s during the [[History of Cambodia (1979-present)|People's Republic of Kampuchea]] regime after being disrupted under the [[Khmer Rouge]].

In January 1987, the Soviet-aided [[Intersputnik]] space communications station began operation in Phnom Penh and established two-way telecommunication links between the Cambodian capital and the cities of [[Moscow]], [[Hanoi]], [[Vientiane]] and [[Paris]]. The completion of the earth satellite station restored the telephone and telex links among Phnom Penh, Hanoi, and other countries for the first time since 1975.

Although telecommunications services were initially limited to the government, these advances in communications helped break down the country's isolation, both internally and internationally.

Today, with the availability of mobile phones, communications are open to all, though the country's [[Prime Minister of Cambodia|Prime Minister]] [[Hun Sen]] decreed that [[3G]] [[mobile phone]]s would not be allowed to support video calling and did not ban them completely as previously reported on this page. 


==Telephones==

The government state communications corporation is [[Telecom Cambodia]], founded in 2006 as an expansion of the telecom operating department of the [[Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, Cambodia|Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications]].   Landline service in [[Phnom Penh]] and other provincial cities is available; mobile phone coverage is rapidly expanding in rural areas. 

Mobile-phone systems are widely used in urban areas to bypass deficiencies in the fixed-line network; fixed-line connections stand at well less than 1 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular usage, aided by increasing competition among service providers, is increasing and stands at nearly 20 per 100 persons.

International calling access is adequate but expensive. Landline and mobile service is available to all countries from Phnom Penh and major provincial cities.

*Main lines in use: 54,200  (2009)   
*Mobile cellular: 5,593,000 (2009)  
*Satellite earth station - 1 [[Intersputnik]] ([[Indian Ocean]] region)

War and continuing fighting severely damaged '''[[Cambodia]]'s transportation system''' &amp;mdash; a system that had been inadequately developed in peacetime. The country's weak [[infrastructure]] hindered emergency relief efforts and created tremendous problems of procurement of supplies in general and of distribution. Cambodia received [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] technical assistance and equipment to support the maintenance of the [[transport network|transportation network]].

==Railways==
{{Main|Rail transport in Cambodia}}

After decades of neglect and damage from wartime, Cambodia's rail network is currently being reconstructed as part of the [[Trans-Asian Railway]] project with modern trains replacing the current open-access system of &quot;bamboo trains&quot;, homemade bamboo mats powered by go-kart or water pump engines.&lt;ref name=rgi20101022&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/rail-revival-to-replace-bamboo-trains.html | title=Rail revival to replace Cambodia's bamboo trains | date=22 October 2010 | work=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two rail lines exist, both originating in [[Phnom Penh]] and totaling about 612 kilometers of [[metre gauge]] [[Single track (rail)|single track]]. A third line is planned to connect Phnom Penh with Vietnam,&lt;ref name=rgi20101022 /&gt; the last missing link of the planned rail corridor between [[Singapore]] and the city of [[Kunming]], [[People's Republic of China|China]].

==Highways==
[[File:National highway number 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[National Highway 1 (Cambodia)|National Highway 1]]]]
* Total - 38,257&amp;nbsp;km
* Paved - 2,406&amp;nbsp;km
* Unpaved - 35,851&amp;nbsp;km (2004)
Of the current total, only about 50 percent of the [[road]]s and [[highway]]s were covered with [[asphalt]] and were in good condition; about 50 percent of the roads were made of crushed stone, [[gravel]], or improved earth; and the remaining approximately 30 percent were unimproved earth or were little more than tracks. In 1981 [[Cambodia]] opened a newly repaired section of National Route 1 which runs southeast from [[Phnom Penh]] to the Vietnamese border. The road, which suffered damage during the war years, was restored most probably by Vietnamese army engineers. In the late 1980s, Cambodia's road network was both underutilized and unable to meet even the modest demands placed upon it by an unindustrialized and [[agrarian|agriculture]] society (see fig. 8.). Commercial vehicles, such as trucks and [[bus]]es, were insufficient in number and lacked the [[Auto part|spare parts]] necessary to keep them running. Road construction and maintenance were ignored by a financially hard-pressed government, while [[Insurgency|insurgent]]s regularly destroyed [[bridge]]s and rendered some routes unsafe for travel.

Cambodia is upgrading the main highways to international standards and most are vastly improved from 2006. Most main roads are now paved. And now road construction is on going from the [[Thailand]] border at [[Poipet]] to [[Siem Reap]] ([[Angkor Wat]]).

==Waterways==
[[Image:Old man on tonle sap.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An elderly Khmer man on the [[Tonle Sap]]]]
The nation's extensive inland [[waterway]]s were important historically in domestic trade. The [[Mekong]] and the [[Tonle Sap River]]s, their numerous tributaries, and the [[Tonle Sap]] provided avenues of considerable length, including 3,700 kilometers navigable all year by craft drawing 0.6 meters and another 282 kilometers navigable to craft drawing 1.8 meters. In some areas, especially west of the Mekong River and north of the Tonle Sap River, the villages were completely dependent on waterways for communications. Launches, [[junk (ship)|junk]]s, or [[barge]]s transport passengers, [[rice]], and other food in the absence of roads and railways.

According to the Ministry of Communications, Transport, and Posts, Cambodia's main [[ferry]] services crossing the [[Bassac River]] and the middle Mekong River at [[Neak Leung Ferry Service]] , [[Tonle Bet Ferry Service]], [[Sre Ambel Ferry Service]], [[Kampong Cham Ferry Service]], and [[Stoeng Treng Ferry Service]] were restored in 1985. The major Mekong River navigation routes also were cleared for traffic.

==Seaports and harbors==
[[Image:Ferry Nheak Leoung.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A ferry taking vehicles and passengers across the [[Mekong]] to [[Neak Leung]] town]]

Cambodia has two major ports, [[Phnom Penh Port]] and [[Sihanoukville Port]], also known as Kampong Som, and five minor ones. Phnom Penh, located at the junction of the [[Bassac River|Bassac]], the Mekong, and the Tonle Sap rivers, is the only [[river port]] capable of receiving 8,000-ton ships during the wet season and 5,000-ton ships during the dry season. It remains an important port for international commerce as well as for domestic communications.

Sihanoukville port reopened in late 1979. It had been built in 1960 with French assistance. In 1980 some 180 Soviet dockworkers, having brought with them forklifts and trucks, were reportedly working at Kampong Som as longshoremen or as instructors of unskilled Cambodian port workers. By 1984 approximately 1,500 Cambodian port workers were handling 2,500 tons of cargo per day. According to official statistics, Sihanoukville had handled only 769,500 tons in the four prior years (1979 to 1983), a level that contrasted sharply with the port's peacetime capacity of about 1 million tons of cargo per year.

==Merchant marine==
* total - 626 [[ship]]s ({{GRT|1,000|first=yes}} or over) totaling {{GRT|953,105}}/{{DWT|1,345,766|metric|first=yes}}

==Airports==
[[File:Siem reap airport.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Siem Reap International Airport]]]]
[[File:Phnom penh airport.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Phnom Penh International Airport]]]]

The country possesses twenty-six [[airfield]]s, of which only thirteen were usable in the mid-1980s. Eight airfields had permanent-surface runways. [[Phnom Penh International Airport]] near Phnom Penh is the largest airport; it also serves as the main base for the renascent [[Cambodian Air Force]].

Cambodia's second largest airport is [[Angkor International Airport]] in the major tourist city of [[Siem Reap]].  Tourist traffic into Angkor International Airport saw passenger numbers overtake those of Phnom Penh in 2006, the airport now being the country's busiest.

Cambodia also opened a new Soviet-built airfield at Ream, [[Sihanoukville International Airport]] in late 1983, which never saw commercial air traffic until now. There is an additional secondary airport in [[Battambang]].

The new national airline [[Cambodia Angkor Air]] was launched in 2009, with a large financial investment from [[Vietnam Airlines]].

'''The Royal Cambodian Government''' (RGC) has established diplomatic relations with most countries, including the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[France]], as well as all of its [[Asia]]n neighbors, to include the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], [[South Korea]], [[North Korea]], and [[Thailand]]. The RGC is a member of most major international organizations, including the [[United Nations]] and its specialized agencies such as the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]]. The RGC is an [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB) member, a member of [[ASEAN]], also a member of the [[world Trade Organization|WTO]]. In 2005 [[Cambodia]] attended the inaugural [[East Asia Summit]].

==International disputes==
Cambodia is involved in a dispute regarding offshore islands and sections of the boundary with [[Vietnam]]. In addition, the [[maritime boundary]] Cambodia has with Vietnam is undefined. Parts of Cambodia's border with [[Thailand]] are indefinite, and the maritime boundary with Thailand is not clearly defined.

==Illicit drugs==
Cambodia is a [[transshipment]] site for [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] heroin, and possibly a site of [[money laundering]]. Reportedly, there is corruption related to narcotics in parts of the government, military and police. Cambodia is also a possible site of small-scale [[opium]], [[heroin]], and [[amphetamine]] production. The country is a large producer of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] for the international market.

===United States===
{{main|Cambodia – United States relations}}

In the past two years, bilateral relations between the [[U.S.]] and [[Cambodia]] have strengthened. The U.S. supports efforts in Cambodia to [[Counterterrorism|combat terrorism]], build democratic institutions, promote [[human rights]], foster economic development, eliminate [[Political corruption|corruption]], achieve the fullest possible accounting for Americans missing from the [[Vietnam War]]-era, and to bring to justice those most responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed under the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime.

===Vietnam===
{{main|Cambodia–Vietnam relations}}

Bilateral relations between the [[Cambodia|Kingdom of Cambodia]] and the [[Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] were for long strained due to the [[Cambodian-Vietnamese War]] (1976–1990). Both nations have since taken steps to establish friendly ties.

The maritime boundary with Vietnam is hampered by unresolved dispute over sovereignty of offshore islands.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Angkor Wat.jpg|thumb|380px|right|The 12th century temple of [[Angkor Wat]] is the masterpiece of Angkorian architecture.  Constructed under the direction of the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] king [[Suryavarman II]], it was to serve as the monarch's personal mausoleum and as a temple to the [[Hindu]] god [[Vishnu]].  It was designed as a pyramid representing the structure of the universe: the highest level at the center of the temple represented [[Mount Meru]], the home of the Hindu gods, with the five towers on the highest level representing the five peaks of the mountain.  The broad moat around the complex represented the oceans that surround the world.]]

The period of [[Angkor]] is the period from approximately the latter half of the 8th century AD to the first half of the 15th century.  If precise dates are required, the beginning may be set in 802 AD, when the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] King [[Jayavarman II]] pronounced himself universal monarch (chakravartin) and declared independence from Java, and the end may be set in 1431 AD, when [[Thai people|Thai]] invaders from the kingdom of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] sacked Angkor and caused the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] elite to migrate to [[Phnom Penh]].

In any study of Angkorian architecture, the emphasis is necessarily on religious architecture, since the only remaining Angkorian buildings are religious in nature.  During the period of Angkor, only temples and other religious buildings were constructed of stone.  Non-religious buildings such as dwellings were constructed of perishable materials such as wood, and as such have not survived.

The religious architecture of [[Angkor]] has characteristic structures, elements, and motifs, which are identified in the glossary below.  Since a number of different architectural styles succeeded one another during the Angkorean period, not all of these features were equally in evidence throughout the period.  Indeed, scholars have recurred to the presence or absence of such features as one source of evidence for dating the remains.

==Periodization==
Scholars have worked to develop a periodization of Angkorian architectural styles. The following periods and styles may be distinguished.  Each is named for a particular temple regarded as paradigmatic for the style.&lt;ref&gt;The periodization of Angkorian architecture presented here is based on that of Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', pp.30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Preah Ko]] Style (877-886 AD): [[Hariharalaya]] was the first capital city of the [[Khmer empire]] located in the area of Angkor; its ruins are in the area now called [[Roluos]] some fifteen kilometers southeast of the modern city of [[Siem Reap]].  The earliest surviving temple of [[Hariharalaya]] is Preah Ko; the others are [[Bakong]] and [[Lolei]].  The temples of the Preah Ko style are known for their small brick towers and for the great beauty and delicacy of their lintels.
* [[Phnom Bakheng|Bakheng]] Style (889-923): Bakheng was the first temple mountain constructed in the area of Angkor proper north of Siem Reap.  It was the state temple of King [[Yasovarman]], who built his capital of Yasodharapura around it.  Located on a hill (phnom), it is currently one of the most endangered of the monuments, having become a favorite perch for tourists eager to witness a glorious sundown at Angkor.
* [[Koh Ker]] Style (921-944)
* [[Pre Rup]] Style (944-968): Under King [[Rajendravarman]], the Angkorian Khmer built the temples of [[Pre Rup]], [[East Mebon]] and [[Phimeanakas]].  Their common style is named after the state temple mountain of Pre Rup.
* [[Banteay Srei]] Style (967-1000): Banteay Srei is the only major Angkorian temple constructed not by a monarch, but by a courtier.  It is known for its small scale and the extreme refinement of its decorative carvings, including several famous narrative bas-reliefs dealing with scenes from Indian mythology.
* [[Khleang]] Style (968-1010)
* [[Baphuon]] Style (1050–1080): Baphuon, the massive temple mountain of King [[Udayadityavarman II]] was apparently the temple that most impressed the Chinese traveller [[Zhou Daguan]], who visited Angkor toward the end of the 13th century.  Its unique relief carvings have a naive dynamic quality that contrast with the rigidity of the figures typical of some other periods.  As of 2008, Baphuon is under restoration and cannot currently be appreciated in its full magnificence.
* Classical or [[Angkor Wat]] Style (1080–1175): Angkor Wat, the temple and perhaps the mausoleum of King [[Suryavarman II]], is the greatest of the Angkorian temples and defines what has come to be known as the classical style of Angkorian architecture.  Other temples in this style are [[Banteay Samre]] and [[Thommanon]] in the area of [[Angkor]], and [[Phimai]] in modern [[Thailand]].
* Baroque or [[Bayon]] Style (1181–1243): In the final quarter of the 12th century, King [[Jayavarman VII]] freed the country of Angkor from occupation by an invasionary force from [[Champa]].  Thereafter, he began a massive program of monumental construction, paradigmatic for which was the state temple called the Bayon.  The king's other foundations participated in the style of the Bayon, and included [[Ta Prohm]], [[Preah Khan]], [[Angkor Thom]], and [[Banteay Chmar]].  Though grandiose in plan and elaborately decorated, the temples exhibit a hurriedness of construction that contrasts with the perfection of Angkor Wat.
* Post [[Bayon]] Style (1243–1431): Following the period of frantic construction under Jayavarman VII, Angkorian architecture entered the period of its decline.  The 13th century [[Terrace of the Leper King]] is known for its dynamic relief sculptures of demon kings, dancers, and [[nāga]]s.

==Materials==
Angkorian builders used [[brick]], [[sandstone]], [[laterite]] and wood as their materials.  The ruins that remain are of brick, sandstone and laterite, the wood elements having been lost to decay and other destructive processes.

===Brick===
The earliest Angkorian temples were made mainly of brick.  Good examples are the temple towers of [[Preah Ko]], [[Lolei]] and [[Bakong]] at [[Hariharalaya]].  Decorations were usually carved into a stucco applied to the brick, rather than into the brick itself.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angkor's neighbor state of [[Champa]] was also the home to numerous brick temples that are similar in style to those of Angkor.  The most extensive ruins are at [[Mỹ Sơn]] in [[Vietnam]].  A Cham story tells of the time that the two countries settled an armed conflict by means of a tower-building contest proposed by the Cham King [[Po klaung garai|Po Klaung Garai]].  While the Khmer built a standard brick tower, Po Klaung Garai directed his people to build an impressive replica of paper and wood.  In the end, the Cham replica was more impressive than the real brick tower of the Khmer, and the Cham won the contest.&lt;ref&gt;Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Champa: Ancient Towers'', p.232.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sandstone===
The only stone used by Angkorian builders was sandstone, obtained from the [[Kulen]] mountains.  Since its obtainment was considerably more expensive than that of brick, sandstone only gradually came into use, and at first was used for particular elements such as door frames.  The 10th century temple of [[Ta Keo]] is the first Angkorian temple to be constructed more or less entirely from Sandstone.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laterite===
Angkorian builders used laterite, a clay that is soft when taken from the ground but that hardens when exposed to the sun, for foundations and other hidden parts of buildings.  Because the surface of laterite is uneven, it was not suitable for decorative carvings, unless first dressed with stucco.  Laterite was more commonly used in the Khmer provinces than at Angkor itself.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structures==
===Central sanctuary===
The central sanctuary of an Angkorian temple was home to the temple's primary deity, the one to whom the site was dedicated: typically [[Shiva]] or [[Vishnu]] in the case of a [[Hindu]] temple, [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] or a [[bodhisattva]] in the case of a [[Buddhist]] temple.  The deity was represented by a statue (or in the case of [[Shiva]], most commonly by a [[linga]]).   Since the temple was not considered a place of worship for use by the population at large, but rather a home for the deity, the sanctuary needed only to be large enough to hold the statue or linga; it was never more than a few metres across.&lt;ref&gt;Coedès, ''Pour mieux comprendre Angkor'', p.91.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its importance was instead conveyed by the height of the tower (''prasat'') rising above it, by its location at the centre of the temple, and by the greater decoration on its walls.  Symbolically, the sanctuary represented [[Mount Meru]], the legendary home of the [[Hindu]] gods.&lt;ref&gt;See Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', pp.26 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prang===
The [[prang]] is the tall finger-like spire, usually richly carved, common to much Khmer religious architecture.

===Enclosure===
Khmer temples were typically enclosed by a concentric series of walls, with the central sanctuary in the middle; this arrangement represented the mountain ranges surrounding [[Mount Meru]], the mythical home of the gods.  Enclosures are the spaces between these walls, and between the innermost wall and the temple itself.  By modern convention, enclosures are numbered from the centre outwards.  The walls defining the enclosures of Khmer temples are frequently lined by galleries, while passage through the walls is by way of gopuras located at the cardinal points.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gallery===
[[File:Cruciformgalleryangkorwat.JPG|thumb|left|A cruciform gallery separates the courtyards at [[Angkor Wat]].]]
A gallery is a passageway running along the wall of an enclosure or along the axis of a temple, often open to one or both sides.  Historically, the form of the gallery evolved during the 10th century from the increasingly long hallways which had earlier been used to surround the central sanctuary of a temple.  During the period of [[Angkor Wat]] in the first half of the 12th century, additional half galleries on one side were introduced to [[buttress]] the structure of the temple.

===Gopura===
[[File:Gopurataprohm.JPG|thumb|left|A gopura leads into the 12th century temple compound at [[Ta Prohm]].]]
[[File:AngkorThom-SouthGate.jpg|thumb|right|Many of the gopuras constructed under [[Jayavarman VII]] toward the end of the 12th century, such as this one at [[Angkor Thom]], are adorned with gigantic stone faces of [[Avalokiteshvara]].]]
A [[gopura]] is an entrance building.  At [[Angkor]], passage through the enclosure walls surrounding a temple compound is frequently accomplished by means of an impressive gopura, rather than just an aperture in the wall or a doorway.  Enclosures surrounding a temple are often constructed with a gopura at each of the four [[cardinal point]]s.   In plan, gopuras are usually cross-shaped and elongated along the axis of the enclosure wall; if the wall is constructed with an accompanying gallery, the gallery is sometimes connected to the arms of the gopura. Many Angkorian gopuras have a tower at the centre of the cross.   The [[lintel (architecture)|lintels]] and [[pediment]]s are often decorated, and guardian figures ([[dvarapala]]s) are often placed or carved on either side of the doorways.

===Hall of Dancers===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Architecture of Cambodia]] --&gt;
A Hall of Dancers is a structure of a type found in certain late 12th century temples constructed under King [[Jayavarman VII]]: [[Ta Prohm]], [[Preah Khan]], [[Banteay Kdei]] and [[Banteay Chhmar]].  It is a rectangular building elongated along the temple's east axis and divided into four courtyards by galleries. Formerly it had a roof made of perishable materials; now only the stone walls remain.  The pillars of the galleries are decorated with carved designs of dancing [[apsaras]]; hence scholars have suggested that the hall itself may have been used for dancing.

===House of Fire===
House of Fire, or ''Dharmasala'', is the name given to a type of building found only in temples constructed during the reign of late 12th century monarch [[Jayavarman VII]]: [[Preah Khan]], [[Ta Prohm]] and [[Banteay Chhmar]].  A House of Fire has thick walls, a tower at the west end and south-facing windows.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', p.172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars theorize that the House of Fire functioned as a &quot;rest house with fire&quot; for travellers.  An inscription at [[Preah Khan]] tells of 121 such rest houses lining the highways into [[Angkor]]. The Chinese traveller [[Zhou Daguan]] expressed his admiration for these rest houses when he visited Angkor in 1296 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Coedès, ''Pour mieux comprendre Angkor'', p.197f.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another theory is that the House of Fire had a religious function as the repository the sacred flame used in sacred ceremonies.

[[File:Libraryangkorwat.JPG|thumb|Unusually, the libraries at [[Angkor Wat]] open to both the East and the West.]]

===Library===
Structures conventionally known as &quot;libraries&quot; are a common feature of Khmer temple architecture, but their true purpose remains unknown.   Most likely they functioned broadly as religious shrines rather than strictly as repositories of manuscripts.   Freestanding buildings, they were normally placed in pairs on either side of the entrance to an enclosure, opening to the west.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Srah and baray===
Srahs and barays were [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]], generally created by excavation and embankment respectively.  It is not clear whether the significance of these reservoirs was religious, agricultural, or a combination of the two.

The two largest reservoirs at Angkor were the [[West Baray]] and the [[East Baray]], located on either side of [[Angkor Thom]].   The East Baray is now dry.  The [[West Mebon]] is an 11th century temple standing at the center of the West Baray; the [[East Mebon]] a 10th century temple standing at the center of the East Baray.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', p.161, 188.&lt;/ref&gt;  The baray associated with [[Preah Khan]] is the Jayataka, in the middle of which stands the 12th century temple of [[Neak Pean]].  Scholars have speculated that the Jayataka represents the Himalayan lake of Anavatapta, known for its miraculous healing powers.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', p.178.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temple mountain===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Angkor Wat]] --&gt;
[[File:Bakong.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bakong]] is the earliest surviving Temple Mountain at Angkor.]]
The dominant scheme for the construction of state temples in the Angkorian period was that of the Temple Mountain, an architectural representation of [[Mount Meru]], the home of the gods in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize, ''The Monuments of Angkor'', p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;   The style was influenced by [[Indian architecture#Hindu architecture|Indian temple architecture]].  Enclosures represented the mountain chains surrounding Mount Meru, while a moat represented the ocean.  The temple itself took shape as a pyramid of several levels, and the home of the gods was represented by the elevated sanctuary at the center of the temple.  The first great Temple Mountain was the [[Bakong]], a five-level pyramid dedicated in 881 AD by King [[Indravarman I]].&lt;ref&gt;Jessup, ''Art &amp; Architecture of Cambodia'', pp.73 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Khmer Temple Mountains include [[Baphuon]], [[Pre Rup]], [[Ta Keo]] and most notably [[Angkor Wat]].

==Elements==
===Bas-relief===
[[Bas-reliefs]] are individual figures, groups of figures, or entire scenes cut into stone walls, not as drawings but as sculpted images projecting from a background.  Sculpture in bas-relief is distinguished from sculpture in haut-relief, in that the latter projects farther from the background, in some cases almost detaching itself from it.  The Angkorian [[Khmer people|Khmer]] preferred to work in bas-relief, while their neighbors the [[Art of Champa|Cham]] were partial to haut-relief.

Narrative bas-reliefs are bas-reliefs depicting stories from mythology or history.  Until about the 11th century AD, the Angkorian Khmer confined their narrative bas-reliefs to the space on the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympana]] above doorways.  The most famous early narrative bas-reliefs are those on the tympana at the 10th century temple of [[Banteay Srei]], depicting scenes from [[Hindu mythology]] as well as scenes from the great works of Indian literature, the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]].  By the 12th century, however, the Angkorian artists were covering entire walls with narrative scenes in bas-relief.  At [[Angkor Wat]], the external gallery wall is covered with some 12,000 or 13,000 square meters of such scenes, some of them historical, some mythological.  Similarly, the outer gallery at the [[Bayon]] contains extensive bas-reliefs documenting the everyday life of the medieval Khmer as well as historical events from the reign of King [[Jayavarman VII]].&lt;ref&gt;Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Colonettesbanteaysrei.JPG|thumb|This blind door at [[Banteay Srei]] is flanked by colonettes.  Above the door is a [[lintel]], above which is a tympanum with a scene from the [[Mahabharata]].]]

===Blind door and window===
Angkorean shrines frequently opened in only one direction, typically to the East. The other three sides featured fake or blind doors to maintain symmetry.  Blind windows were often used along otherwise blank walls.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonette===
Colonettes were narrow decorative columns that served as supports for the beams and [[lintel]]s above doorways or windows.  Depending on the period, they were round, rectangular, or octagonal in shape.  Colonettes were often circled with molded rings and decorated with carved leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corbelling===
[[File:Corbelangkorthomsouth.JPG|thumb|100px|left|Corbelled arch at the south gate of [[Angkor Thom]].]]
[[File:Ta-Prom IntérieurGalerie.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Corbelled hallway at [[Ta Prohm]].]]
Angkorian engineers tended to use the [[corbel arch]] in order to construct rooms, passageways and openings in buildings.  A corbel arch is constructed by adding layers of stones to the walls on either side of an opening, with each successive layer projecting further towards the centre than the one supporting it from below, until the two sides meet in the middle.   The corbel arch is structurally weaker than the true [[arch]], of which the Angkorian engineers appear to have been ignorant.  The use of corbelling prevented the Angkorian engineers from constructing large openings or spaces in buildings roofed with stone, and made such buildings particularly prone to collapse once they were no longer maintained.  These difficulties did not, of course, exist for buildings constructed with stone walls surmounted by a light wooden roof.  The problem of preventing the collapse of corbelled structures at Angkor remains a serious one for modern conservation.&lt;ref name = &quot;rlirmh&quot;&gt;Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lintel, pediment, and tympanum===
A [[lintel]] is a horizontal beam connecting two vertical columns between which runs a door or passageway.  Because the Angkorean Khmer lacked the ability to construct a true [[arch]], they constructed their passageways using lintels or [[corbelling]].  A [[pediment]] is a roughly triangular structure above a lintel.  A tympanum is the decorated surface of a pediment.

[[File:Pedlintelsrei.JPG|thumb|right|[[lintel (architecture)|Lintel]] and [[pediment]] at [[Banteay Srei]]; the motif on the pediment is [[Shiva]] [[Nataraja]].]]
The styles employed by Angkorean artists in the decoration of lintels evolved over time, as a result, the study of lintels has proven a useful guide to the dating of temples.  Some scholars have endeavored to develop a periodization of lintel styles.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', pp.32-35.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most beautiful Angkorean lintels are thought to be those of the [[Preah Ko]] style from the late 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', pp.32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common motifs in the decoration of lintels include the [[kāla (time)|kala]], the [[Naga (mythology)|nāga]] and the [[makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]], as well as various forms of vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize, ''The Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.40.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also frequently depicted are the [[Hindu]] gods associated with the four cardinal directions, with the identity of the god depicted on a given lintel or pediment depending on the direction faced by that element.  [[Indra]], the god of the sky, is associated with East; [[Yama]], the god of judgment and Hell, with South; [[Varuna]], the god of the ocean, with West; and [[Kubera]], god of wealth, with North.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', p.20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stairs===
[[File:Steps-ankor.jpg|thumb|left|The stairs leading to the inner enclosure at [[Ankor Wat]] are daunting.]]
Angkorean [[stairs]] are notoriously steep.  Frequently, the length of the [[riser]] exceeds that of the [[tread]], producing an angle of ascent somewhere between 45 and 70 degrees.  The reasons for this peculiarity appear to be both religious and monumental.  From the religious perspective, a steep stairway can be interpreted as a &quot;stairway to heaven,&quot; the realm of the gods.  &quot;From the monumental point of view,&quot; according to Angkor-scholar [[Maurice Glaize]], &quot;the advantage is clear - the square of the base not having to spread in surface area, the entire building rises to its zenith with a particular thrust.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;rlirmh&quot;/&gt;

==Motifs==
===Apsara and devata===
[[File:Apsarasdevatakdei01.jpg|thumb|right|'''Apsaras''' (left) and a '''devata''' (right) grace the walls at [[Banteay Kdei]].]]
[[File:Apsaras Bayon Kambodscha200.jpg|thumb|left|Three '''apsaras''' appear on this pillar at the 12th century Buddhist temple the [[Bayon]].]]
[[Apsaras]], divine nymphs or celestial dancing girls, are characters from Indian mythology.  Their origin is explained in the story of the churning of the [[Ocean of Milk]], or [[samudra manthan]], found in the great epic [[Mahabharata]].  Other stories in the Mahabharata detail the exploits of individual apsaras, who were often used by the gods as agents to persuade or seduce mythological demons, heroes and ascetics.  The widespread use of apsaras as a motif for decorating the walls and pillars of temples and other religious buildings, however, was a [[Khmer people|Khmer]] innovation.  In modern descriptions of Angkorian temples, the term &quot;apsara&quot; is sometimes used to refer not only to dancers but also to other minor female deities, though minor female deities who are depicted standing about rather than dancing are more commonly called &quot;[[devatas]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See Roveda. ''Images of the Gods'', p.200ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apsaras and devatas are ubiquitous at [[Angkor]], but are most common in the foundations of the 12th century.  Depictions of true (dancing) apsaras are found, for example, in the [[Architecture of Cambodia#Hall of Dancers|Hall of Dancers]] at [[Preah Khan]], in the pillars that line the passageways through the outer gallery of the [[Bayon]], and in the famous bas-relief of [[Angkor Wat]] depicting the churning of the Ocean of Milk.  The largest population of devatas (around 2,000) is at [[Angkor Wat]], where they appear individually and in groups.&lt;ref&gt;See Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dvarapala===
[[File:Banteaykdeidravapala01.jpg|thumb|left|This '''dvarapala''' stands guard at [[Banteay Kdei]].]]
[[Dvarapala]]s are human or demonic temple guardians, generally armed with lances and clubs.  They are presented either as a stone statues or as relief carvings in the walls of temples and other buildings, generally close to entrances or passageways.  Their function is to protect the temples.  Dvarapalas may be seen, for example, at [[Preah Ko]], [[Lolei]], [[Banteay Srei]], [[Preah Khan]] and [[Banteay Kdei]].&lt;ref&gt;Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gajasimha and Reachisey===
The gajasimha is a mythical animal with the body of a lion and the head of an elephant.  At Angkor, it is portrayed as a guardian of temples and as a mount for some warriors.  The gajasimha may be found at [[Banteay Srei]] and at the temples belonging to the [[Hariharalaya|Roluos]] group.

The reachisey is another mythical animal, similar to the gajasimha, with the head of a lion, a short elephantine trunk, and the scaly body of a dragon.  It occurs at [[Angkor Wat]] in the epic bas reliefs of the outer gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Roveda, ''Images of the Gods'', pp.211-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Garuda===
[[File:Linteau Musée Guimet 25972.jpg|right|thumb|In this 9th century lintel now on display at the [[Musée Guimet]], '''Garuda''' bears Vishnu on his shoulders.]]
[[Garuda]] is a divine being that is part man and part bird.  He is the lord of birds, the mythologial enemy of [[nāga]]s, and the battle steed of [[Vishnu]].  Depictions of Garuda at Angkor number in the thousands, and though Indian in inspiration exhibit a style that is uniquely Khmer.&lt;ref name = &quot;ukougg&quot;&gt;Roveda, ''Images of the Gods'', p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;  They may be classified as follows:
* As part of a narrative bas relief, Garuda is shown as the battle steed of [[Vishnu]] or [[Krishna]], bearing the god on his shoulders, and simultaneously fighting against the god's enemies.  Numerous such images of Garuda may be observed in the outer gallery of [[Angkor Wat]].
* Garuda serves as an [[Atlas (architecture)|atlas]] supporting a superstructure, as in the bas relief at Angkor Wat that depicts heaven and hell.  Garudas and stylized mythological lions are the most common atlas figures at Angkor.
* Garuda is depicted in the pose of a victor, often dominating a nāga, as in the gigantic relief sculptures on the outer wall of [[Preah Khan]].  In this context, Garuda symblizes the military power of the Khmer kings and their victories over their enemies.  Not coincidentally, the city of Preah Khan was built on the site of King [[Jayavarman VII]]'s victory over invaders from [[Champa]].
* In free-standing nāga sculptures, such as in nāga bridges and balustrades, Garuda is often depicted in relief against the fan of nāga heads.  The relationship between Garuda and the nāga heads is ambiguous in these sculptures: it may be one of cooperation, or it may again be one of domination of the nāga by Garuda.&lt;ref name = &quot;ukougg&quot;/&gt;

===Indra===
In the ancient religion of the [[Vedas]], [[Indra]] the sky-god reigned supreme.  In the medieval [[Hinduism]] of Angkor, however, he had no religious status, and served only as a decorative motif in architecture.  Indra is associated with the East; since Angkorian temples typically open to the East, his image is sometimes encountered on lintels and pediments facing that direction.  Typically, he is mounted on the three-headed elephant [[Airavata]] and holds his trusty weapon, the thunderbolt or [[vajra]].  The numerous adventures of Indra documented in Hindu epic [[Mahabharata]] are not depicted at Angkor.&lt;ref name = &quot;ukougg&quot;/&gt;

===Kala===
[[File:Banteay Srei Kala.jpg|thumb|right|A '''kala''' serves as the base for a deity at the 10th century Hindu temple [[Banteay Srei]].]]
The kala is a ferocious monster symbolic of time in its all-devouring aspect and associated with the destructive side of the god [[Shiva|Siva]].&lt;ref&gt;Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.39.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Khmer temple architecture, the kala serves as a common decorative element on lintels, tympana and walls, where it is depicted as a monstrous head with a large upper jaw lined by large carnivorous teeth, but with no lower jaw.  Some kalas are shown disgorging vine-like plants, and some serve as the base for other figures.

Scholars have speculated that the origin of the kala as a decorative element in Khmer temple architecture may be found in an earlier period when the skulls of human victims were incorporated into buildings as a kind of protective magic or [[apotropaism]].  Such skulls tended to lose their lower jaws when the ligaments holding them together dried out.  Thus, the kalas of Angkor may represent the Khmer civilization's adoption into its decorative iconography of elements derived from long forgotten primitive antecedents.&lt;ref&gt;Roveda, ''Images of the Gods'', p.209.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Krishna===
Scenes from the life of [[Krishna]], a mythological hero and [[Avatar]] of the god [[Vishnu]], are common in the relief carvings decorating Angkorian temples, and unknown in Angkorian sculpture in the round.  The literary sources for these scenes are the [[Mahabharata]], the [[Harivamsa]], and the [[Bhagavata Purana]].&lt;ref&gt;See Roveda, ''Images of the Gods'', pp.76 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  The following are some of the most important Angkorian depictions of the life of Krishna:
* A series of bas reliefs at the 11th century temple pyramid called [[Baphuon]] depicts scenes of the birth and childhood of Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;Roveda, ''Images of the Gods'', p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Numerous bas reliefs in various temples show Krishna subduing the [[Naga (mythology)|nāga]] [[Kaliya]].  In Angkorian depictions, Krishna is shown effortlessly stepping on and pushing down his opponent's multiple heads.&lt;ref&gt;Rovedo, ''Images of the Gods'', p.79&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also common is the depiction of Krishna as he lifts Mount [[Govardhana]] with one hand in order to provide the cowherds with shelter from the deluge caused by [[Indra]].&lt;ref&gt;Roveda, ''Images of the Gods'', p.80.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Krishna is frequently depicted killing or subduing various demons, including his evil uncle [[Kamsa]].&lt;ref&gt;Roveda, ''Images of the Gods'', p.91.&lt;/ref&gt;  An extensive bas relief in the outer gallery of [[Angkor Wat]] depicts Krishna's battle with the [[asura]] Bana.  In battle, Krishna is shown riding on the shoulders of [[Garuda]], the traditional mount of [[Vishnu]].
* In some scenes, Krishna is depicted in his role as charioteer, advisor and protector of [[Arjuna]], the hero of the [[Mahabharata]].  A well-known bas relief from the 10th century temple of [[Banteay Srei]] depicts the Krishna and Arjuna helping [[Agni]] to burn down Khandava forest.

===Linga===
[[File:Linga Musée Guimet 2597.jpg|thumb|left|This segmented '''linga''' from 10th century Angkor has a square base, an octogonal middle, and a round tip.]]
The [[linga]] is a phallic post or cylinder symbolic of the god [[Shiva]] and of creative power.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a religious symbol, the function of the linga is primarily that of worship and ritual, and only secondarily that of decoration.  In the [[Khmer empire]], certain lingas were erected as symbols of the king himself, and were housed in royal temples in order to express the king's consubstantiality with Siva.&lt;ref&gt;Coedès, ''Pour mieux comprendre Angkor'', p.60.&lt;/ref&gt;  The lingas that survive from the Angkorean period are generally made of polished stone.

The lingas of the Angkorian period are of several different types.
* Some lingas are implanted in a flat square base called a [[yoni]], symbolic of the womb.
* On the surface of some lingas is engraved the face of Siva.  Such lingas are called mukhalingas.
* Some lingas are segmented into three parts: a square base symbolic of [[Brahma]], an octagonal middle section symbolic of [[Vishnu]], and a round tip symbolic of [[Shiva]].

===Makara===
[[File:Lintel corner with makara rider 1.jpg|thumb|right|The corner of a lintel on one of the brick towers at [[Bakong]] shows a man riding on the back of a '''makara''' that in turn disgorges another monster.]]
A [[makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] is a mythical sea monster with the body of a serpent, the trunk of an elephant, and a head that can have features reminiscent of a lion, a crocodile, or a dragon.  In Khmer temple architecture, the motif of the makara is generally part of a decorative carving on a lintel, tympanum, or wall.  Often the makara is depicted with some other creature, such as a lion or serpent, emerging from its gaping maw. The makara is a central motif in the design of the famously beautiful lintels of the [[Hariharalaya|Roluos]] group of temples: [[Preah Ko]], [[Bakong]], and [[Lolei]].  At [[Banteay Srei]], carvings of makaras disgorging other monsters may be observed on many of the corners of the buildings.

===Nāga===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Angkor]] --&gt;
[[File:Buddha shielded by Naga.jpg|left|thumb|[[Mucalinda]], the '''nāga''' king who shielded [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] as he sat in meditation, was a favorite motif for Cambodian Buddhist sculptors from the 11th century.  This statue is dated between 1150 and 1175 A.D.]]

Mythical serpents, or [[Naga (mythology)|nāga]]s, represent an important motif in Khmer architecture as well as in free-standing sculpture.  They are frequently depicted as having multiple heads, always uneven in number, arranged in a fan.  Each head has a flared hood, in the manner of a cobra.

[[File:Linteau Musée Guimet 25973.jpg|right|thumb|This multi-headed '''nāga''' is part of a decorative lintel from the end of the 9th century.]]
Nāgas are frequently depicted in Angkorian [[lintel]]s.  The composition of such lintels characteristically consists in a dominant image at the center of a rectangle, from which issue swirling elements that reach to the far ends of the rectangle.  These swirling elements may take shape as either vinelike vegetation or as the bodies of nāgas.  Some such nāgas are depicted wearing crowns, and others are depicted serving as mounts for human riders.

To the Angkorian Khmer, nāgas were symbols of water and figured in the myths of origin for the Khmer people, who were said to be descended from the union of an Indian [[Brahman]] and a serpent princess from Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize, ''The Monuments of Angkor'', p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nāgas were also characters in other well-known legends and stories depicted in Khmer art, such as the churning of the [[Ocean of Milk]], the legend of the Leper King as depicted in the bas-reliefs of the [[Bayon]], and the story of [[Mucalinda]], the serpent king who protected the Buddha from the elements.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize, ''The Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nāga Bridge===
[[File:Ankor Tom in Cambodia 001.JPG|thumb|right|Stone [[Asuras]] hold the '''nāga''' [[Vasuki]] on a bridge leading into the 12th century city of [[Angkor Thom]].]]
Nāga bridges are causeways or true bridges lined by stone [[balustrade]]s shaped as nāgas.

In some Angkorian nāga-bridges, as for example those located at the entrances to 12th century city of [[Angkor Thom]], the nāga-shaped balustrades are supported not by simple posts but by stone statues of gigantic warriors.  These giants are the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] and [[asuras]] who used the nāga king [[Vasuki]] in order to the churn the Ocean of Milk in quest of the [[amrita]] or elixir of immortality.  The story of the Churning of the Ocean of Milk or [[samudra manthan]] has its source in Indian mythology.

===Quincunx===
[[File:Quincunxlingakbalspean01.JPG|thumb|left|A '''linga''' in the form of a '''quincunx''', set inside a [[yoni]], is carved into the riverbed at [[Kbal Spean]].]]
A [[quincunx]] is a spatial arrangement of five elements, with four elements placed as the corners of a square and the fifth placed in the center.  The five peaks of [[Mount Meru]] were taken to exhibit this arrangement, and Khmer temples was arranged accordingly in order to convey a symbolic identification with the sacred mountain. The five brick towers of the 10th century temple known as [[East Mebon]], for example, are arranged in the shape of a quincunx.  The quincunx also appears elsewhere in designs of the Angkorian period, as in the riverbed carvings of [[Kbal Spean]].

===Shiva===
Most temples at [[Angkor]] are dedicated to [[Shiva]].  In general, the Angkorian Khmer represented and worshipped Shiva in the form of a [[lingam]], though they also fashioned anthropomorphic statues of the god.  Anthropomorphic representations are also found in Angkorian bas reliefs.  A famous tympanum from [[Banteay Srei]] depicts Shiva sitting on Mount Kailasa with his consort, while the demon king [[Ravana]] shakes the mountain from below. At [[Angkor Wat]] and [[Bayon]], Shiva is depicted as a bearded ascetic.  His attributes include the mystical eye in the middle of his forehead, the trident, and the rosary.  His [[vahana]] or mount is the bull [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]].

===Vishnu===
Angkorian representations of [[Vishnu]] include anthropomorphic representations of the god himself, as well as representations of his incarnations or [[Avatar]]s, especially [[Krishna]] and [[Rama]].  Depictions of Vishnu are prominent at [[Angkor Wat]], the 12th century temple that was originally dedicated to Vishnu.  Bas reliefs depict Vishna battling with against [[asura]] opponents, or riding on the shoulders of his [[vahana]] or mount, the gigantic bird-man [[Garuda]].  Vishnu's attributes include the discus, the conch shell, the baton, and the orb.

==Ordinary housing==

The nuclear family, in rural Cambodia, typically lives in a rectangular house that may vary in size from four by six meters to six by ten meters. It is constructed of a wooden frame with gabled thatch roof and walls of woven bamboo. [[Rural Khmer house|Khmer houses]] typically are raised on stilts as much as three meters for protection from annual floods. Two ladders or wooden staircases provide access to the house. The steep thatch roof overhanging the house walls protects the interior from rain. Typically a house contains three rooms separated by partitions of woven bamboo. The front room serves as a living room used to receive visitors, the next room is the parents' bedroom, and the third is for unmarried daughters. Sons sleep anywhere they can find space. Family members and neighbors work together to build the house, and a house-raising ceremony is held upon its completion. The houses of poorer persons may contain only a single large room. Food is prepared in a separate kitchen located near the house but usually behind it. Toilet facilities consist of simple pits in the ground, located away from the house, that are covered up when filled. Any livestock is kept below the house.&lt;ref name=country&gt;[[Federal Research Division]]. Russell R. Ross, ed. &quot;Housing&quot;.

Chinese and Vietnamese houses in Cambodian town and villages typically are built directly on the ground and have earthen, cement, or tile floors, depending upon the economic status of the owner. Urban housing and commercial buildings may be of brick, masonry, or wood.&lt;ref name=country/&gt;

'''Capricornus''' is one of the [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]]; it is often called '''Capricorn''', especially when referring to the corresponding [[Capricorn (astrology)|astrological sign]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;horned male [[goat]]&quot; or &quot;goat [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]&quot;, and it is commonly represented in the form of a [[sea-goat]]: a mythical creature that is half goat, half shark. Its symbol is [[Image:Capricorn symbol 2.png|20px]] (Unicode ♑).

Capricornus is one of the 88 modern constellations, and was also one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]]. Under its modern boundaries it is bordered by [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], [[Microscopium]], [[Piscis Austrinus]] and [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. The constellation is located in an area of sky called the [[Sea (astronomy)|Sea]] or Water, consisting of many water-related constellations such as Aquarius, Pisces and Eridanus.

Capricornus is the second faintest constellation in the zodiac after [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]]. Its brighter stars are found on a triangle whose vertices are [[Alpha Capricorni|α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Capricorni]] (Giedi), [[Delta Capricorni|δ Capricorni]] (Deneb Algiedi), and [[Omega Capricorni|ω Capricorni]].

===Deep sky objects===
Capricorn has several galaxies and clusters. [[Messier 30]] is a globular cluster located 1 degree south of the galaxy group [[NGC 7103]]. The constellation also harbors the wide spiral galaxy [[NGC 6907]].

==History==
Despite its faintness, Capricornus has one of the oldest mythological associations, having been consistently represented as a [[mythological hybrid|hybrid]] of a goat and a fish since the [[Middle Bronze Age]]. First attested in depictions on a cylinder-seal c. 21st century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Master's Thesis of Peeter Espak, 2006 page 104 &quot;[http://dspace.utlib.ee/dspace/bitstream/10062/958/5/espakpeeter.pdf]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; from the mid second Millennium it became a popular motif on [[kudurru|boundary stones]].&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008. Page 118ff&lt;/ref&gt; It was explicitly recorded in the [[Babylonian star catalogues]] as {{lang|sux-Latn|&lt;sup&gt;MUL&lt;/sup&gt;SUḪUR.MAŠ}} &quot;The Goat-Fish&quot; before 1000 BC. The constellation was a symbol of [[Ea (god)|Ea]] and in the Early Bronze Age marked the [[winter solstice]].&lt;ref&gt;John H. Rogers, &quot;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JBAA..108....9R Origins of the ancient contellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions]&quot;, ''Journal of the British Astronomical Association'' '''108''' (1998) 9–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]] the December solstice no longer takes place while the sun is in the constellation Capricornus, but the astrological sign called Capricorn begins with the solstice. The sun's most southerly position, which is attained at the northern hemisphere's winter solstice, is now called the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], a term which also applies to the line on earth where the sun is directly overhead at noon on that solstice.

The planet [[Neptune]] was discovered in this constellation by German astronomer [[Johann Gottfried Galle|Johann Galle]], near Deneb Algedi (δ Capricorni) on September 23, 1846, which is reasonable as Capricornus can be seen best at 4:00am in September.

In [[Chinese astronomy]], constellation Capricornus lies in ''[[Black Tortoise (Chinese constellation)|The Black Tortoise of the North]]'' (北方玄武, ''Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ'').

==Mythology==
This constellation is sometimes identified as [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]], the goat that suckled the infant [[Zeus]] after his mother [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] saved him from being devoured by his father [[Cronos]] (in [[Greek mythology]]). The goat's broken horn was transformed into the [[cornucopia]] or horn of plenty. Some ancient sources claim that this derives from the sun &quot;taking nourishment&quot; while in the constellation, in preparation for its climb back northward.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} However, the constellation is more often depicted as a goat with a fish's tail. One myth says that when the goat-god [[Pan (god)|Pan]] was attacked by the monster [[Typhon]], he dove into the [[Nile]]; the parts above the water remained a goat, but those under the water transformed into a fish.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In [[Sumer]], the constellation was associated with the god [[Enki]] ([[Babylonian mythology|Babylonian]] Ea), who brought culture out of the sea to humankind.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Astrology===
{{main|Capricorn (astrology)}}

{{As of|2002}}, the Sun appears in the constellation Capricornus from January 19 to February 15. In [[tropical astrology]], the Sun is considered to be in the sign [[Capricornus (astrology)|Capricorn]] from December 22 to January 19, and in [[sidereal astrology]], from January 15 to February 15.

==Visualizations==
[[File:Capricornus.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Early 1800 rendition of Capricornus as a sea-goat.]]
Ptolemy's method of connecting the stars of Capricornus has been influential.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jebrown.us/SolarAlmanac/private/Articles/Constellations/Capricornus.html#Ptolemy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. A. Rey]] has suggested an alternative visualization, which graphically shows a [[goat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rey |first=H. A. |title=The Stars — A New Way To See Them |origyear=  |accessdate= |edition=Enlarged World-Wide Edition |year=1997 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=0-395-24830-2 |pages= |chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goat's head is formed by the triangle of stars [[Iota Capricorni|ι Cap]], [[Theta Capricorni|θ Cap]], and [[Zeta Capricorni|ζ Cap]]. The goat's horn sticks out with stars [[Gamma Capricorni|γ Cap]] and [[Delta Capricorni|δ Cap]]. Star δ Cap, at the tip of the horn, is of the third magnitude. The goat's tail consists of stars [[Beta Capricorni|β Cap]] and [[Alpha Capricorni|α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Cap]]: star β Cap being of the third magnitude. The goat's hind foot consists of stars [[Psi Capricorni|ψ Cap]] and [[Omega Capricorni|ω Cap]]. Both of these stars are of the fourth magnitude.

==Capricornus as the name==
[[USS Capricornus (AKA-57)]] is once of [[United States]] navy ship.

'''Cameroon''', officially the '''Republic of Cameroon''' ({{lang-fr|République du Cameroun}}), is a country of central and western [[Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Nigeria]] to the west; [[Chad]] to the northeast; the [[Central African Republic]] to the east; and [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]], and the [[Republic of the Congo]] to the south. Cameroon's coastline lies on the [[Bight of Bonny]], part of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The country is called &quot;Africa in miniature&quot; for its geological and cultural diversity. Natural features include beaches, deserts, mountains, rainforests, and savannas. The highest point is [[Mount Cameroon]] in the southwest, and the largest cities are [[Douala]], [[Yaoundé]], and [[Garoua]]. Cameroon is home to over 200 different linguistic groups. The country is well known for its native styles of music, particularly [[makossa]] and [[bikutsi]], and for its successful [[Cameroon national football team|national football team]]. [[English Language|English]] and [[French Language|French]] are the official languages.

Early inhabitants of the territory included the [[Sao civilisation]] around [[Lake Chad]] and the [[Baka (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest. Portuguese explorers reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area ''Rio dos Camarões'' (&quot;River of [[Shrimp]]&quot;), the name from which ''Cameroon'' derives. [[Fula people|Fulani]]&lt;ref&gt;In {{lang-ff|Fulɓe}}; in {{lang-fr|Peul ''or'' Peuhl}}.&lt;/ref&gt; soldiers founded the [[Adamawa Emirate]] in the north in the 19th century, and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and [[fon (Cameroon)|fondoms]]. Cameroon became a [[German Empire|German]] [[colonialism|colony]] in 1884.

After [[World War I]], the territory was divided between [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[British Empire|Britain]] as [[League of Nations mandate]]s. The [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon|Union des Populations du Cameroun]] political party advocated independence but was outlawed by [[France]] in the 1950s. It waged war on French and [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon|UPC]] militants forces until 1971. In 1960, the [[France|French]] administered part of Cameroon became independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]]. The [[Southern Cameroons|southern part]] of British [[Cameroons]] merged with it in 1961 to form the [[Federal republic|Federal Republic]] of Cameroon. The country was renamed the [[Unitary state|United Republic]] of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in 1984.

Compared to other African countries, Cameroon enjoys relatively high political and social stability. This has permitted the development of agriculture, roads, railways, and large petroleum and timber industries. Nevertheless, large numbers of Cameroonians live in poverty as subsistence farmers. Power lies firmly in the hands of the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] president since 1982, [[Paul Biya]], and his [[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]] party. The [[Southern Cameroons|English speaking territories]] of Cameroon have grown increasingly alienated from the government, and politicians from those regions have called for greater decentralization and even the [[Southern Cameroons|secession]] (for example,: [[Southern Cameroons National Council|the Southern Cameroons National Council]]) of the former British-governed territories.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Cameroon}}
[[File:Merrick at Isubu funeral.jpg|thumb|left|[[Joseph Merrick (missionary)|Joseph Merrick]] (shown here attending an [[Isubu]] funeral in 1845) was a Jamaican Baptist missionary who established a church among the Isubu of the coast.]]
The territory of present day Cameroon was first settled during the [[Neolithic]]. The longest continuous inhabitants are groups such as the [[Baka (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]].&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sao civilisation|Sao]] culture arose around [[Lake Chad]] c. AD 500 and gave way to the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]] and its successor state, the [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] empire. Kingdoms, [[fon (Cameroon)|fondoms]], and chiefdoms arose in the west.

Portuguese sailors reached the coast in 1472. They noted an abundance of the mud lobster ''[[Lepidophthalmus turneranus]]'' in the [[Wouri River]] and named it {{lang|pt|''Rio dos Camarões''}}, Portuguese for &quot;River of Shrimp&quot;, and the phrase from which ''Cameroon'' is derived. Over the following few centuries, European interests regularised trade with the coastal peoples, and Christian [[missionary|missionaries]] pushed inland. In the early 19th century, [[Modibo Adama]] led [[Fula people|Fulani]] soldiers on a [[jihad]] in the north against non-Muslim and partially Muslim peoples and established the [[Adamawa Emirate]]. Settled peoples who fled the Fulani caused a major redistribution of population.&lt;ref&gt;Fanso 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[German Empire]] claimed the territory as the [[colonialism|colony]] of [[Kamerun]] in 1884 and began a steady push inland. They initiated projects to improve the colony's infrastructure, relying on a harsh system of [[unfree labour|forced labour]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DeLancey 125&quot;&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 125.&lt;/ref&gt; With the defeat of Germany in [[World War I]], Kamerun became a [[League of Nations mandate]] territory and was split into [[French Third Republic|French]] {{lang|fr|[[Cameroun]]}} and [[British Empire|British]] [[Cameroons]] in 1919. France integrated the economy of Cameroun with that of France&lt;ref name=&quot;DeLancey 5&quot;&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and improved the infrastructure with capital investments, skilled workers, and continued forced labour.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeLancey 125&quot;/&gt;

The British administered their territory from neighbouring [[Nigeria]]. Natives complained that this made them a neglected &quot;colony of a colony&quot;. Nigerian migrant workers flocked to Southern Cameroons, ending forced labour but angering indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The League of Nations mandates were converted into [[United Nations Trusteeship Council|United Nations Trusteeships]] in 1946, and the question of independence became a pressing issue in French Cameroun.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeLancey 5&quot;/&gt; France outlawed the most radical political party, the [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon|Union des Populations du Cameroun]] (UPC), on 13 July 1955. This prompted a long guerrilla war and the assassination of the party's leader, [[Ruben Um Nyobé]], near Boumnyebel, the village where he was born. In British Cameroons, the question was whether to reunify with French Cameroun or join Nigeria.

[[File:DF-SC-83-08609.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ahmadou Ahidjo]] arrives at [[Washington, D.C.]], in July 1982.]]
On 1 January 1960 at 2:30am, French Cameroun gained independence from France under President [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]]. On 1 October 1961, the formerly British [[Southern Cameroons]] united with French Cameroun to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. Ahidjo used the ongoing war with the [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon|UPC]] to concentrate power in the presidency, continuing with this even after the suppression of the UPC in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeLancey 6&quot;&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

His political party, the [[Cameroon National Union]] (CNU), became the sole legal political party on 1 September 1966 and in 1972, the [[federation|federal system of government]] was abolished in favour of a United Republic of Cameroon, headed from [[Yaoundé]].&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahidjo pursued an economic policy of [[planned liberalism]], prioritising cash crops and petroleum exploitation. The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects; however, many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them.&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahidjo stepped down on 4 November 1982 and left power to his constitutional successor, [[Paul Biya]]. However, Ahidjo remained in control of the CNU and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning. Biya began his administration by moving toward a more democratic government, but a failed [[Cameroonian Palace Guard Revolt|coup d'état]] nudged him toward the leadership style of his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[economic crisis of Cameroon|economic crisis]] took effect in the mid-1980s to late 1990s as a result of international economic conditions, drought, falling petroleum prices, and years of [[political corruption|corruption]], mismanagement, and [[cronyism]]. Cameroon turned to foreign aid, cut government spending, and [[privatization|privatised]] industries. With the reintroduction of multi-party politics in December 1990, the former British Cameroons pressure groups called for greater autonomy, with some ([[Southern Cameroons National Council|SCNC]]) advocating complete secession as the Republic of [[Ambazonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DeLancey 9&quot;&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, Cameroon experienced its worst violence in 15 years when a transport union strike in Douala escalated into [[2008 Cameroonian anti-government protests|violent protests]] in 31 municipal areas.&lt;ref&gt;Nkemngu.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Politics of Cameroon}}
[[File:Biya &amp; Marquardt.JPG|thumb|left|President [[Paul Biya]] of Cameroon and Ambassador [[R. Niels Marquardt]] of the United States, 16 February 2006.]]
The [[Heads of state of Cameroon|President of Cameroon]] has broad, unilateral powers to create policy, administer government agencies, command the [[military of Cameroon|armed forces]], negotiate and ratify treaties, and declare a state of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Background Notes: Cameroon; Neba 250.&lt;/ref&gt; The president appoints government officials at all levels, from the [[Prime Minister of Cameroon|prime minister]] (considered the official head of government), to the provincial governors, divisional officers, and urban-council members in large cities. The president is selected by popular vote every seven years. In smaller municipalities, the public elects mayors and councilors.

Corruption is rife at all levels of government. In 1997, Cameroon established anti-corruption bureaus in 29 ministries, but only 25% became operational,&lt;ref name=&quot;IRIN&quot;&gt;IRIN, &quot;New anti-corruption drive&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007, [[Transparency International]] placed Cameroon at number 138 on a list of 163 countries ranked from least to most corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Corruption Perceptions Index&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 January 2006, Biya initiated an anti-corruption drive under the direction of the [[National Anti-Corruption Observatory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IRIN&quot;/&gt;

Cameroon's legal system is largely based on [[law of France|French civil law]] with common law influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; Although nominally independent, the judiciary falls under the authority of the executive's [[Ministry of Justice of Cameroon|Ministry of Justice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;State Dept&quot;&gt;&quot;Background Note: Cameroon&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The president appoints judges at all levels. The judiciary is officially divided into tribunals, the [[Court of Appeal of Cameroon|court of appeal]], and the [[Supreme Court of Cameroon|supreme court]]. The National Assembly elects the members of a nine-member [[High Court of Justice (Cameroon)|High Court of Justice]] that judges high-ranking members of government in the event they are charged with high treason or harming national security.

Human rights organisations accuse police and military forces of mistreating and even torturing criminal suspects, ethnic minorities, [[LGBT rights in Cameroon|homosexuals]], and political activists.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cameroon&quot;, Amnesty International; &quot;Cameroon (2006)&quot;, Freedom House; &quot;Cameroon&quot;, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, U.S. Department of State; &quot;Elections to the Human Rights Council&quot;, Amnesty International.&lt;/ref&gt; Prisons are overcrowded with little access to adequate food and medical facilities,&lt;ref name=&quot;EHRC&quot;&gt;&quot;Elections to the Human Rights Council&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Human Rights Report&quot;/&gt; and prisons run by traditional rulers in the north are charged with holding political opponents at the behest of the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freedom House&quot;&gt;&quot;Cameroon (2006)&quot;, Freedom House.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the first decade of the 21st century, an increasing number of police and gendarmes have been prosecuted for improper conduct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Report&quot;/&gt;

The [[National Assembly of Cameroon|National Assembly]] makes legislation. The body consists of 180 members who are elected for five-year terms and meet three times per year. Laws are passed on a majority vote. Rarely has the assembly changed or blocked legislation proposed by the president. The 1996 constitution establishes a second house of parliament, the 100-seat Senate, but this body has never been put into practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; The government recognises the authority of traditional chiefs, fons, and [[lamido|lamibe]] to govern at the local level and to resolve disputes as long as such rulings do not conflict with national law.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Background Note: Cameroon&quot;; Neba 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Paul Biya]]'s [[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]] (CPDM) was the only legal political party until December 1990. Numerous regional political groups have since formed. The primary opposition is the [[Social Democratic Front (Cameroon)|Social Democratic Front]] (SDF), based largely in the Anglophone region of the country and headed by [[John Fru Ndi]].&lt;ref name = &quot;lergai&quot;&gt;West 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Biya and his party have maintained control of the presidency and the National Assembly in national elections, but rivals contend that these have been unfair.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeLancey 9&quot;/&gt; Human rights organisations allege that the government suppresses the freedoms of opposition groups by preventing demonstrations, disrupting meetings, and arresting opposition leaders and journalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freedom House&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amnesty&quot;&gt;&quot;Cameroon&quot;, Amnesty International.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freedom House]] ranks Cameroon as &quot;not free&quot; in terms of political rights and civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;Cameroon is ranked a six in both categories on a scale of one to seven, with one being &quot;most free&quot; and seven being &quot;least free&quot;. &quot;Cameroon (2006)&quot;, Freedom House.&lt;/ref&gt; The last [[Cameroonian parliamentary election, 2007|parliamentary elections]] were held on 22 July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Kandemeh.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameroon is a member of both the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and [[Francophonie|La Francophonie]]. Its [[foreign relations of Cameroon|foreign policy]] closely follows that of its main ally, France (the former colonial ruler).&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 126; Ngoh 328.&lt;/ref&gt; The country relies heavily on France for its defence,&lt;ref name=&quot;State Dept&quot;/&gt; although military spending is high in comparison to other sectors of government.&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Biya has clashed with the government of Nigeria over possession of the [[Bakassi]] peninsula and with [[Gabon]]'s president, [[Omar Bongo|El Hadj Omar Bongo]], over personal rivalries.&lt;ref name = &quot;lergai&quot;/&gt;

== Regions ==
{{Main|Regions of Cameroon|Divisions of Cameroon}}
[[File:Provinces of Cameroon EN.svg|thumb|upright|Cameroon is divided into 10 regions.]]
The [[Constitution of Cameroon|constitution]] divides Cameroon into 10 semi-autonomous regions, each under the administration of an elected [[Regional Council (Cameroon)|Regional Council]]. A presidential decree of 12 November 2008 officially instigated the change from provinces to regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prc.cm/index_fr.php?link=les_actes/lecture_act&amp;id=79&amp;lang=fr&amp;quoi=D%E9cret Décret N° 2008/376 du 12 novembre 2008], President of the Republic website. Accessed 9 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor. These leaders are charged with implementing the will of the president, reporting on the general mood and conditions of the regions, administering the civil service, keeping the peace, and overseeing the heads of the smaller administrative units. Governors have broad powers: they may order propaganda in their area and call in the army, [[gendarmerie|gendarmes]], and police.&lt;ref&gt;Neba 250.&lt;/ref&gt; All local government officials are employees of the central government’s Ministry of Territorial Administration, from which local governments also get most of their budgets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/26431.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The regions are subdivided into 58 divisions (French {{lang|fr|''départements''}}). These are headed by presidentially appointed divisional officers ({{lang|fr|''[[prefect|préfets]]''}}), who perform the governors' duties on a smaller scale. The divisions are further sub-divided into sub-divisions ({{lang|fr|''arrondissements''}}), headed by assistant divisional officers ({{lang|fr|''sous-prefets''}}). The districts, administered by district heads ({{lang|fr|''chefs de district''}}), are the smallest administrative units. These are found in large sub-divisions and in regions that are difficult to reach.

The three northernmost regions are the [[Far North Region (Cameroon)|Far North]] ({{lang|fr|''Extrême Nord''}}), [[North Region (Cameroon)|North]] ({{lang|fr|''Nord''}}), and [[Adamawa Region|Adamawa]] ({{lang|fr|''Adamaoua''}}). Directly south of them are the [[Centre Region (Cameroon)|Centre]] ({{lang|fr|''Centre''}}) and [[East Region (Cameroon)|East]] ({{lang|fr|''Est''}}). The [[South Region (Cameroon)|South Province]] ({{lang|fr|''Sud''}}) lies on the Gulf of Guinea and the southern border. Cameroon's western region is split into four smaller regions: The [[Littoral Region (Cameroon)|Littoral]] ({{lang|fr|''Littoral''}}) and [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|Southwest]] ({{lang|fr|''Sud-Ouest''}}) regions are on the coast, and the [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|Northwest]] ({{lang|fr|''Nord-Ouest''}}) and [[West Region (Cameroon)|West]] ({{lang|fr|''Ouest''}}) regions are in the western grassfields. The Northwest and Southwest were once part of British Cameroons; the other regions were in French Cameroun.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Cameroon}}
[[File:Rhumsiki Peak.jpg|thumb|left|[[Volcanic plugs]] dot the landscape near [[Rhumsiki]], Far North Region.]]
At {{km2 to mi2|475442|spell=Commonwealth|precision=0|wiki=yes}}, Cameroon is the world's 53rd-largest country.&lt;ref&gt;''Demographic Yearbook'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is comparable in size to [[Papua New Guinea]] and somewhat larger than the U.S. state of [[California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Rank Order – Area&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The country is located in [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[West Africa]] on the [[Bight of Bonny]], part of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Cameroon lies between latitudes [[1st parallel north|1°]] and [[13th parallel north|13°N]], and longitudes [[8th meridian east|8°]] and [[17th meridian east|17°E]].

Tourist literature describes Cameroon as &quot;Africa in miniature&quot; because it exhibits all major climates and vegetation of the continent: coast, desert, mountains, rainforest, and savanna.&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The country's neighbours are Nigeria to the west; [[Chad]] to the northeast; the [[Central African Republic]] to the east; and [[Equatorial Guinea]], Gabon, and the [[Republic of the Congo]] to the south.

Cameroon is divided into five major geographic zones distinguished by dominant physical, climatic, and vegetative features. The coastal plain extends {{convert|15|to|150|km|mi|0}} inland from the Gulf of Guinea&lt;ref&gt;Fomesky et al. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and has an average elevation of {{convert|90|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Neba 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Exceedingly hot and humid with a short [[dry season]], this belt is densely forested and includes some of the [[Debundscha|wettest places]] on earth, part of the [[Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests]].&lt;ref&gt;Neba 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Highest Average Annual Precipitation Extremes&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[South Cameroon Plateau]] rises from the coastal plain to an average elevation of {{convert|650|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neba 16&quot;&gt;Neba 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Equatorial rainforest dominates this region, although its alternation between [[wet season|wet]] and dry seasons makes it is less humid than the coast. This area is part of the [[Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests]] [[ecoregion]].

[[File:Hills near Ngaoundal.jpg|thumb|right|Countryside near [[Ngaoundal]] in Cameroon's [[Adamawa Region]].]]
An irregular chain of mountains, hills, and plateaus known as the [[Cameroon line|Cameroon range]] extends from [[Mount Cameroon]] on the coast—Cameroon's highest point at {{convert|4095|m|ft|0}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Neba 17&quot;/&gt;—almost to [[Lake Chad]] at Cameroon's northern border at 13°05'N. This region has a mild climate, particularly on the [[Western High Plateau]], although rainfall is high. Its soils are among Cameroon's most fertile, especially around volcanic Mount Cameroon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neba 17&quot;&gt;Neba 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Volcanism here has created [[crater lake]]s. On 21 August 1986, one of these, [[Lake Nyos]], belched carbon dioxide and killed between 1,700 and 2,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 161 report 1,700 killed; Hudgens and Trillo 1054 say &quot;at least 2,000&quot;; West 10 says &quot;more than 2,000&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; This area has been delineated by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as the [[Cameroonian Highlands forests]] [[ecoregion]].

The southern plateau rises northward to the grassy, rugged [[Adamawa Plateau]]. This feature stretches from the western mountain area and forms a barrier between the country's north and south. Its average elevation is {{convert|1100|m|ft|0}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Neba 16&quot;/&gt; and its average temperature ranges from {{convert|22|C|F|1}} to {{convert|25|C|F}} with high rainfall between April and October peaking in July and August.&lt;ref&gt;Gwanfogbe et al. 20; Neba 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[East Sudanian savanna|northern lowland region]] extends from the edge of the Adamawa to Lake Chad with an average elevation of {{convert|300|to|350|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neba 17&quot;/&gt; Its characteristic vegetation is savanna scrub and grass. This is an arid region with sparse rainfall and high median temperatures.

Cameroon has four patterns of drainage. In the south, the principal rivers are the [[Ntem River|Ntem]], [[Nyong River|Nyong]], [[Sanaga River|Sanaga]], and Wouri. These flow southwestward or westward directly into the Gulf of Guinea. The [[Dja River|Dja]] and [[Kadéï River|Kadéï]] drain southeastward into the [[Congo River]]. In northern Cameroon, the [[Benue River|Bénoué River]] runs north and west and empties into the [[Niger River|Niger]]. The [[Logon River|Logone]] flows northward into Lake Chad, which Cameroon shares with three neighbouring countries.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
{{Main|Economy of Cameroon}}
[[File:Crevette Libme Cameroun.jpg|thumb|right|Fishing is a major industry in Cameroon. Fifteenth-century Portuguese explorers found [[prawn]]s in such abundance that they named the area ''Rio dos Camarões'' (&quot;River of Prawns&quot;), the name from which ''Cameroon'' derives. This prawn was caught at [[Limbe, Cameroon|Limbe]] in 2007.]]
Cameroon's per-capita GDP ([[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]) was estimated as [[United States dollar|US $]]2,300 in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;CIA Factbook 2009&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the ten highest in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Musa Biya plan&quot;&gt;Musa, &quot;Biya plan to keep power in Cameroon clears hurdle&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Major export markets include France, Italy, South Korea, Spain, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt;
Cameroon has enjoyed a decade of strong economic performance, with GDP growing at an average of 4 percent per year. During the 2004-2008 period, public debt was reduced from over 60 percent of GDP to 10 percent and official reserves quadrupled to over USD 3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfw4a.org/cameroon/cameroon-financial-sector-profile.html MFW4A]&lt;/ref&gt; Cameroon is part of the [[Bank of Central African States]] (of which it is the dominant economy),&lt;ref name=&quot;Musa Biya plan&quot;/&gt; the [[Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa]] (UDEAC) and the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] (OHADA).&lt;ref name=&quot;ohada.com&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.ohada.com/index.php The business law portal in Africa]&quot;, OHADA.com. Accessed 22 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its currency is the [[CFA franc]]. Red tape, high taxes, and endemic corruption have impeded growth of the private sector.
Unemployment was estimated at 30% in 2001, and about a third of the population was living below the international [[poverty threshold]] of US$1.25 a day in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf ''Human Development Indices''], Table 3: Human and income poverty, p. 35. Retrieved on 1 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1980s, Cameroon has been following programmes advocated by the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) to reduce poverty, privatise industries, and increase economic growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;State Dept&quot;/&gt; [[Tourism in Cameroon|Tourism]] is a growing sector, particularly in the coastal area, around Mount Cameroon, and in the north.

Cameroon's natural resources are very well suited to agriculture and arboriculture. An estimated 70% of the population farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated 19.8% of GDP in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools. They sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, cash crops include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, groundnuts, and rice. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Fulani herd in the dust.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Fula people|Fulani]] herder drives his cattle in northern Cameroon.]]
Livestock are raised throughout the country. Fishing employs some 5,000 people and provides 20,000 tons of seafood each year. [[Bushmeat]], long a staple food for rural Cameroonians, is today a delicacy in the country's urban centres. The commercial bushmeat trade has now surpassed deforestation as the main threat to wildlife in Cameroon.

The southern rainforest has vast timber reserves, estimated to cover 37% of Cameroon's total land area. However, large areas of the forest are difficult to reach. Logging, largely handled by foreign-owned firms, provides the government US$60 million a year, and laws mandate the safe and sustainable exploitation of timber. Nevertheless, in practice, the industry is one of the least regulated in Cameroon.

Factory-based industry accounted for an estimated 29.7% of GDP in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; More than 75% of Cameroon's industrial strength is located in [[Douala]] and [[Bonabéri]]. Cameroon possesses substantial mineral resources, but these are not extensively [[mining in Cameroon|mined]].&lt;ref name=&quot;State Dept&quot;/&gt; Petroleum exploitation has fallen since 1985, but this is still a substantial sector such that dips in prices have a strong effect on the economy. Rapids and waterfalls obstruct the southern rivers, but these sites offer opportunities for hydroelectric development and supply most of Cameroon's energy. The Sanaga River powers the largest hydroelectric station, located at Edéa. The rest of Cameroon's energy comes from oil-powered thermal engines. Much of the country remains without reliable power supplies.

[[File:Logging truck and bush taxi accident.jpg|thumb|right|A [[share taxi|bush taxi]] attempts to pass a stalled logging vehicle on the road between [[Abong-Mbang]] and [[Lomié]], East Region.]]
[[Transport in Cameroon]] is often difficult. Except for the several relatively good [[toll road]]s which connect major cities (all of them one-lane) roads are poorly maintained and subject to inclement weather, since only 10% of the roadways are tarred.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; Roadblocks often serve little other purpose than to allow police and gendarmes to collect bribes from travellers.&lt;ref&gt;Hudgens and Trillo 1036.&lt;/ref&gt; Road banditry has long hampered transport along the eastern and western borders, and since 2005, the problem has intensified in the east as the [[Central African Republic]] has further destabilised.&lt;ref name=&quot;Musa Gunmen&quot;&gt;Musa, &quot;Gunmen kill one, kidnap 22 in Cameroon near CAR&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intercity bus services run by multiple private companies connect all major cities. Although intercity buses rarely depart on schedule but rather wait until all the tickets are sold. They are the most popular mean of transportation followed by the government-owned rail service. Rail service runs from [[Kumba]] in the west to [[Bélabo]] in the east and north to Ngaoundéré. International airports are located in [[Douala]] and [[Garoua]] with a smaller facility at [[Yaoundé]]. The airport at [[Bamenda]] is now closed. The [[Wouri estuary]] provides a harbour for Douala, the country's principal seaport. In the north, the Bénoué River is seasonally navigable from Garoua across into Nigeria.

Although press freedoms have improved since the first decade of the 21st century, the press is corrupt and beholden to special interests and political groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reporters&quot;&gt;&quot;Cameroon – Annual Report 2007&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Report&quot;&gt;&quot;Cameroon&quot;, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.&lt;/ref&gt; The major radio and television stations are state-run and other [[communications in Cameroon|communications]], such as land-based telephones and telegraphs, are largely under government control.&lt;ref&gt;Mbaku 20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, cell phone networks and Internet providers have increased dramatically since the first decade of the 21st century&lt;ref&gt;Mbaku 20–1.&lt;/ref&gt; and are largely unregulated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freedom House&quot;/&gt;

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Cameroon|Languages of Cameroon}}
[[Image:Tikar family.jpg|thumb|220 px|A Tikar family in the Northwest Province]]
2009 UN estimates place Cameroon's population at 19,522,000. The population is young: an estimated 40.9% are under 15, and 96.7% are under 65. The birth rate is estimated at 34.1 births per 1,000 people, the death rate at 12.2.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cm.html CIA World Factbook: Cameroon]&lt;/ref&gt; The life expectancy is 53.69&amp;nbsp;years (52.89&amp;nbsp;years for males and 54.52&amp;nbsp;years for females).&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt;

Cameroon's population is almost evenly divided between urban and rural dwellers.&lt;ref name=&quot;West 3&quot;&gt;West 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Population density is highest in the large urban centres, the western highlands, and the northeastern plain.&lt;ref&gt;Neba 109–11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douala]], [[Yaoundé]], and [[Garoua]] are the largest cities. In contrast, the Adamawa Plateau, southeastern Bénoué depression, and most of the South Cameroon Plateau are sparsely populated.&lt;ref&gt;Neba 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

People from the overpopulated western highlands and the underdeveloped north are moving to the coastal plantation zone and urban centres for employment.&lt;ref&gt;Neba 105–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller movements are occurring as workers seek employment in lumber mills and plantations in the south and east.&lt;ref&gt;Neba 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the national sex ratio is relatively even, these out-migrants are primarily males, which leads to unbalanced ratios in some regions.&lt;ref&gt;Neba 103–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[monogamy|monogamous]] and [[polygamy|polygamous]] marriage are practiced, and the average Cameroonian family is large and extended.&lt;ref&gt;Mbaku 139.&lt;/ref&gt; In the north, women tend to the home, and men herd cattle or work as farmers. In the south, women grow the family's food, and men provide meat and grow cash crops. Cameroonian society is male-dominated, and violence and discrimination against women is common.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Report&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Freedom House&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mbaku 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maison obus.jpg|thumb|left|The homes of the [[Musgum]], in the Far North Region, are made of earth and grass.]]
Estimates identify anywhere from 230 to 282 different folks and linguistic groups in Cameroon.&lt;ref&gt;Neba 65, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Adamawa Plateau broadly bisects these into northern and southern divisions. The northern peoples are Sudanese groups, who live in the central highlands and the northern lowlands, and the Fulani, who are spread throughout northern Cameroon. A small number of [[Baggara|Shuwa]] Arabs live near Lake Chad. Southern Cameroon is inhabited by speakers of [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] and [[Semi-Bantu]] languages. Bantu-speaking groups inhabit the coastal and equatorial zones, while speakers of Semi-Bantu languages live in the Western grassfields. Some 5,000 Pygmies roam the southeastern and coastal rainforests or live in small, roadside settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Neba 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Nigerians, make up the largest group of foreign nationals.&lt;ref&gt;Neba 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Cameroon hosted a total population of refugees and asylum seekers of approximately 97,400. Of these, 49,300 were from the [[Central African Republic]] (many driven west by war),&lt;ref&gt;International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.&lt;/ref&gt; 41,600 from [[Chad]], and 2,900 from [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;World Refugee Survey 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=World Refugee Survey 2008|publisher=U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants|date=2008-06-19|url=http://www.refugees.org/survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kidnappings of Cameroonian citizens by Central African bandits have increased since 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Musa Gunmen&quot;/&gt;

The European languages introduced during colonialism have created a linguistic divide between the population who live in the Northwest and Southwest regions and the French-speaking remainder of the country.&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Both English and French are official languages, although French is by far the most understood language. [[Cameroonian Pidgin English]] is the lingua franca in the formerly British-administered territories.&lt;ref&gt;Neba 94.&lt;/ref&gt; A mixture of English, French, and Pidgin called [[Camfranglais]] has been gaining popularity in urban centres since the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 131; Niba.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameroon has a high level of [[Religion in Cameroon|religious freedom]] and diversity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Report&quot;/&gt; [[Christianity|Christians]] are concentrated chiefly in the southern and western regions, and [[Islam|Muslims]] reside in large numbers in every region but are concentrated in the north. There is significant internal migration. There are currently no active Islamic political parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e406?_hi=7&amp;_pos=2&lt;/ref&gt; Large cities have significant populations of both groups, with mosques and churches often located near each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;state2&quot;&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90086.htm U.S.Department of State]&lt;/ref&gt;

People from the North-West and South-West provinces are largely Protestant, and the French speaking regions of the southern and western regions are largely Catholic. Southern ethnic groups predominantly follow [[Christianity|Christian]] or [[Animist]] beliefs, or a [[syncretism|syncretic]] combination of the two. People widely believe in witchcraft, and the government outlaws such practices.&lt;ref&gt;Geschiere 169–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Suspected witches are often subject to mob violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Report&quot;/&gt;

In the northern regions, the locally dominant Fulani ethnic group is mostly Muslim, although some ethnic groups retain native animist beliefs and are called ''[[Kirdi]]'' (&quot;pagan&quot;) by the Fulani. The [[Bamum people|Bamum]] ethnic group of the West Region is largely Muslim. Native Traditional religions are practiced in rural areas throughout the country but rarely are practiced publicly in cities, in part because many indigenous religious groups are intrinsically local in character.&lt;ref name=&quot;state2&quot;/&gt;

Each of Cameroon's ethnic groups has its own unique cultural forms. Typical celebrations include births, deaths, plantings, harvests, and religious rituals. Seven [[public holidays in Cameroon|national holidays]] are observed throughout the year, and movable holidays include the Christian holy days of [[Good Friday]], [[Easter]] Sunday, [[Easter Monday]], and [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]]; and the Muslim holy days of [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid-ul-Fitr]], [[Eid-ul-Adha]], and [[Mawlid|Eid Miladun Nabi]].

One Cameroon language has become the object of international attention{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} though the efforts of an interactive language learning website at http://www.busuu.com/enc/home. The language is called [[Busuu language]] and is an unclassified Southern Bantoid language of Cameroon with just 8 speakers left.

[[Music of Cameroon|Music]] and [[dance in Cameroon|dance]] are an integral part of Cameroonian ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings, and storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;Mbaku 189; West 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional dances are highly choreographed and separate men and women or forbid participation by one sex altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Mbaku 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of dances range from pure entertainment to religious devotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;West 18&quot;&gt;West 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, music is transmitted orally. In a typical performance, a chorus of singers echoes a soloist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mbaku 189&quot;&gt;Mbaku 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical accompaniment may be as simple as clapping hands and stomping feet,&lt;ref&gt;Mbaku 191.&lt;/ref&gt; but traditional instruments include bells worn by dancers, clappers, drums and [[talking drum]]s, flutes, horns, rattles, scrapers, stringed instruments, whistles, and xylophones; the exact combination varies with ethnic group and region. Some performers sing complete songs by themselves, accompanied by a harplike instrument.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mbaku 189&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West 18–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular music styles include [[ambasse bey]] of the coast, [[assiko]] of the Bassa, [[mangambeu]] of the [[Bamileke|Bangangte]], and [[tsamassi]] of the Bamileke.&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 184.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Music of Nigeria|Nigerian music]] has influenced Anglophone Cameroonian performers, and [[Prince Nico Mbarga]]'s [[highlife]] hit &quot;[[Sweet Mother]]&quot; is the top-selling African record in history.&lt;ref&gt;Mbaku 200.&lt;/ref&gt; The two most popular styles are [[makossa]] and [[bikutsi]]. Makossa developed in Douala and mixes folk music, [[highlife]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[soukous|Congo music]]. Performers such as [[Manu Dibango]], [[Francis Bebey]], [[Moni Bilé]], and [[Petit-Pays]] popularised the style worldwide in the 1970s and 1980s. Bikutsi originated as war music among the Ewondo. Artists such as [[Anne-Marie Nzié]] developed it into a popular dance music beginning in the 1940s, and performers such as [[Mama Ohandja]] and [[Les Têtes Brulées]] popularised it internationally during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 51; Nkolo &amp; Ewens 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Woman weaving baskets near Lake Ossa.jpg|left|thumb|A woman weaves a basket near [[Lake Ossa]], Littoral Region. Cameroonians practice such handicrafts throughout the country.]]
[[Cuisine of Cameroon|Cuisine]] varies by region, but a large, one-course, evening meal is common throughout the country. A typical dish is based on cocoyams, maize, cassava (manioc), millet, plantains, potatoes, rice, or yams, often pounded into dough-like [[fufu]] (''cous-cous''). This is served with a sauce, soup, or stew made from greens, groundnuts, palm oil, or other ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;West 84–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Meat and fish are popular but expensive additions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mbaku 121-2&quot;&gt;Mbaku 121–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Dishes are often quite hot, spiced with salt, red pepper, and [[Maggi]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudgens and Trillo 1047; Mbaku 122; West 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Water, [[palm wine]], and [[millet beer]] are the traditional mealtime drinks, although beer, soda, and wine have gained popularity. Silverware is common, but food is traditionally manipulated with the right hand. Breakfast consists of leftovers of bread and fruit with coffee or tea, generally breakfast is made from wheat flour various different foods such as puff-puff (doughnuts), accra banana made from bananas and flour,bean cakes and many more. Snacks are popular, especially in larger towns where they may be bought from street vendors.&lt;ref&gt;Mbaku 121; Hudgens and Trillo 1049.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional arts and crafts are practiced throughout the country for commercial, decorative, and religious purposes. Woodcarvings and sculptures are especially common.&lt;ref&gt;West 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The high-quality clay of the western highlands is suitable for pottery and ceramics.&lt;ref name=&quot;West 18&quot;/&gt; Other crafts include basket weaving, beadworking, brass and bronze working, calabash carving and painting, embroidery, and leather working. Traditional housing styles make use of locally available materials and vary from temporary wood-and-leaf shelters of nomadic [[Wodaabe|Mbororo]] to the rectangular mud-and-thatch homes of southern peoples. Dwellings made from materials such as cement and tin are increasingly common.&lt;ref&gt;Mbaku 110–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Contemporary art]] is mainly promoted by independent cultural organizations ([[Doual'art]], [[Africréa]]) and artist-run initiatives ([[Art Wash]], [[Atelier Viking]], [[Art Bakery]]). [[Douala]] and [[Yaoundé]] are the major cities where the institutions and projects are located. Douala hosts the art biennial DUTA (2005 and 2007) and the art and architecture triennial SUD-Salon Urbain de Douala with site-specific permanent and ephemeral urban interventions; in Yaoundé is located RAVY-Rencontres d'arts visuels de Yaoundé.

[[File:Cameroon vs Germany 2003.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] faces [[Germany national football team|Germany]] at [[Zentralstadion]] in [[Leipzig]], 27 April 2003.]]
Cameroonian literature and [[list of Cameroonian films|film]] have concentrated on both European and African themes. Colonial-era writers such as [[Louis-Marie Pouka]] and [[Sankie Maimo]] were educated by European missionary societies and advocated [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] into European culture as the means to bring Cameroon into the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;Mbaku 80–1&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, writers such as [[Mongo Beti]] and [[Ferdinand Oyono]] analysed and criticised colonialism and rejected assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick 38; Mbaku 77, 83–4; Volet.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after independence, filmmakers such as [[Jean-Paul Ngassa]] and [[Thérèse Sita-Bella]] explored similar themes.&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 119–20; West 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, Mongo Beti and other writers explored post-colonialism, problems of African development, and the recovery of African identity.&lt;ref&gt;Mbaku 85–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in the mid-1970s, filmmakers such as [[Jean-Pierre Dikongué Pipa]] and [[Daniel Kamwa]] dealt with the conflicts between traditional and post-colonial society. Literature and films during the next two decades concentrated more on wholly Cameroonian themes.&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

National policy strongly advocates sport in all forms. Traditional sports include canoe racing and wrestling, and several hundred runners participate in the {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Mount Cameroon Race of Hope]] each year.&lt;ref&gt;West 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Cameroon is one of the few tropical countries to have [[Cameroon at the 2002 Winter Olympics|competed]] in the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]]. However, [[sport in Cameroon]] is dominated by [[association football]] (soccer). Amateur football clubs abound, organised along ethnic lines or under corporate sponsors. The [[Cameroon national football team]] has been one of the most successful in the world since its strong showing in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]. Cameroon has won four [[African Cup of Nations]] titles and the gold medal at the 2000 Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;West 92–3, 127.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Eto'o]] and the Cameroon national team did not make it out of the group stages of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

This article documents the history of [[Cameroon]].

==Early history==
The earliest inhabitants of [[Cameroon]] were probably the [[Baka (nomadic Central African people)|Baka]] (Pygmies). They still inhabit the forests of the south and east provinces. [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] speakers originating in the Cameroonian highlands were among the first groups to move out before other invaders. The [[Mandara kingdom]] in the [[Mandara Mountains]] was founded around 1500 and erected magnificent [[Mandara Strongholds|fortified structures]], the purpose and exact history of which are still unresolved. The [[Aro Confederacy]] of [[Nigeria]] may have had presence in western (later called British) Cameroon due to migration in the 18th and 19th centuries.

During the late 1770s and the early 19th century, the [[Fula people|Fula]]ni, a [[pastoralism|pastoral]] [[Islam]]ic people of the western [[Sahel]], conquered most of what is now northern Cameroon, subjugating or displacing its largely non-Muslim inhabitants.

Although the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] arrived on Cameroon's doorstep in the 16th century, [[malaria]] prevented significant European settlement and conquest of the interior until the late 1870s, when large supplies of the malaria suppressant, [[quinine]], became available. The early European presence in Cameroon was primarily devoted to coastal trade and the acquisition of [[slavery|slaves]]. The northern part of Cameroon was an important part of the Muslim slave trade network. The slave trade was largely suppressed by the mid-19th century. Christian [[missionary|missions]] established a presence in the late 19th century and continue to play a role in Cameroonian life.

:''Further information: [[German Kamerun]], [[French Cameroun]], [[British Cameroons]]''

Beginning on July 5, 1884, all of present-day Cameroon and parts of several of its neighbours became [[German colonial empire|a German colony]], [[Kamerun]], with a capital first at [[Buea]] and later at [[Yaoundé]].

The Imperial German government made substantial investments in the infrastructure of Cameroon, including the extensive [[railway]]s, such as the 160-metre single-span railway bridge on the [[Sanaga South]] branch. Hospitals were opened all over the colony, including two major hospitals at [[Douala]], one of which specialised in tropical diseases (the Germans had discovered the 1912, wrote in an official report in 1919 that the population of Kamerun had increased significantly. However, the indigenous peoples proved reluctant to work on these projects, so the Germans instigated a harsh and unpopular system of [[unfree labour|forced labour]].&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 125.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[Jesko von Puttkamer]] was relieved of duty as governor of the colony due to his untoward actions toward the native Cameroonians.&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 226.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 at the [[Treaty of Fez]] after the [[Agadir Crisis]], France ceded a nearly 300,000&amp;nbsp;km² portion of the territory of [[French Equatorial Africa]] to Kamerun which became [[Neukamerun]], while Germany ceded a smaller area in the north in present day [[Chad]] to France.

In [[World War I]] the British invaded Cameroon from [[Nigeria]] in 1914 in the [[West Africa Campaign (World War I)|West Africa campaign]], with the last German fort in the country surrendering in February 1916.  After the war this colony was partitioned between the United Kingdom and France under a June 28, 1919 [[League of Nations mandate#Class B mandates|League of Nations mandates (Class B)]]. France gained the larger geographical share, transferred Neukamerun back to neighboring French colonies, and ruled the rest from Yaoundé as [[French Cameroun|Cameroun]] (French Cameroons). Britain's territory, a strip bordering [[Nigeria]] from the sea to [[Lake Chad]], with an equal population was ruled from [[Lagos]] as [[Cameroons]] (British Cameroons). German administrators were allowed to once again run the plantations of the southwestern coastal area. A British Parliamentary Publication, ''Report on the British Sphere of the Cameroons'' (May 1922, p.&amp;nbsp;62-8), reports that the German plantations there were &quot;as a whole . . . wonderful examples of industry, based on solid scientific knowledge. The natives have been taught discipline and have come to realise what can be achieved by industry. Large numbers who return to their villages take up cocoa or other cultivation on their own account, thus increasing the general prosperity of the country.&quot;

In 1955, the outlawed [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon]] (UPC), based largely among the [[Bamileke]] and [[Bassa people (Cameroon)|Bassa]] ethnic groups, began an armed struggle for independence in French Cameroon. This rebellion continued, with diminishing intensity, even after independence. Estimates of death from this conflict vary from thousands to hundreds of thousands.

==Cameroon after independence==
French Cameroons achieved independence on January 1, 1960 as the '''Republic of Cameroon'''. After Guinea, it was the second of France's colonies in Sub-Saharan Africa to be granted independence. The following year, on October 1, 1961, the largely Muslim northern two-thirds of [[British Cameroons]] voted to join Nigeria; the largely Christian southern third, [[Southern Cameroons]], voted to join with the Republic of Cameroon to form the '''Federal Republic of Cameroon'''. The formerly French and British regions each maintained substantial [[Self-governance|autonomy]]. [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]], a French-educated Fulani, was chosen president of the federation in 1961. Ahidjo, relying on a pervasive internal security apparatus, outlawed all political parties but his own in 1966. He successfully suppressed the continuing UPC rebellion, capturing the last important rebel leader in 1970. In 1972, a new constitution replaced the federation with a unitary state called the '''United Republic of Cameroon'''.

Although Ahidjo's rule was characterised as authoritarian, he was seen as noticeably lacking in charisma in comparison to many post-colonial African leaders. He didn't follow the anti-western policies pursued by many of these leaders, which helped Cameroon achieve a degree of comparative political stability and economic growth.

Ahidjo resigned as president in 1982 and was constitutionally succeeded by his [[Prime Minister]], [[Paul Biya]], a career official from the [[Beti-Pahuin]] ethnic group. Ahidjo later regretted his choice of successors, but his supporters failed to overthrow Biya in a [[Cameroonian Palace Guard Revolt|1984 coup]]. Biya won single-candidate elections in 1983 and 1984 when the country was again named the '''Republic of Cameroon'''.  Biya has remained in power, winning flawed multiparty elections in 1992, 1997, and 2004. His [[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]] (CPDM) party holds a sizeable majority in the legislature.

On August 15, 1984, [[Lake Monoun]] exploded in a [[limnic eruption]] that released [[carbon dioxide]], [[Asphyxia|suffocating]] 37 people to death. On August 21, 1986, another limnic eruption at [[Lake Nyos]] killed as many as 1,800 people and 3,500 livestock. The two disasters are the only recorded instances of limnic eruptions.

==Corruption in Cameroon==
Despite democratic reform begun in 1990 with the legalization of political parties other than the CPDM, political power remains firmly in the hands of President Biya and a small circle of CPDM members from his own ethnic group. Biya was reelected on October 11, 1992 amid accusations of voting irregularities. Biya reportedly got 39 percent of the vote to 35 percent for [[John Fru Ndi]]. (Ndi briefly proclaimed himself president before the government released the polling figures.) In contrast, the March 1, 1992 legislative election was considered free and fair by international observers, although many parties boycotted the elections and the CPDM won several constituencies by default. But even though opposition parties were well-represented in the legislature (92 of 180 seats), there were, according to the [[Constitution of Cameroon|1992 constitution]], few legislative or judicial checks on the president.

Following the elections, civil unrest erupted as the population expressed the widespread belief that Ndi had won the presidential elections. By late 1992, Ndi and his supporters were under house arrest and the international community had made clear its displeasure at the antidemocratic and increasingly violent turn the Biya regime was taking.

Biya agreed in May 1993 to hold a so-called Great National Constitutional Debate and in June he began preparing a draft of a new constitution to be adopted either by referendum or by the National Assembly. In 1994, 16 opposition parties formed a loose alliance, dominated by Ndi's Social Democrats, to work for constitutional and electoral reform. In October 1995, the CPDM reelected Biya as its leader. In December of that year the National Assembly adopted a number of amendments to address the power of the president. These reforms included a strengthening of the judiciary, the creation of a partially elected 100-member senate, the creation of regional councils, and the fixing of the presidential term to 7 years, renewable once. Strikes and demonstrations became commonplace as Biya resisted implementation of reforms.

The May 1997 legislative elections were marred by mismanagement, vote-rigging, and fraud, resulting in the Supreme Court's cancellation of results in three constituencies (seven seats). Based on the misconduct of these elections, the opposition boycotted the October 1997 presidential elections, in which Biya claimed victory with 93 percent of the vote. To add further insult, Cameroon topped [[Transparency International]]'s list of the most corrupt countries in the world in 1998, prompting the creation of an anticorruption body.

On June 30, 2002 the country held legislative and municipal elections that again were denounced by the opposition as fraudulent. The Supreme Court cancelled the results of nine constituencies, ordering new elections in these constituencies on September 15. In the end, the [[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]] (CPDM)/Rassemblement Démocratique du Peuple Camerounais (RDPC) won 149 of 180 seats.

The victory for the ruling party was cemented with the reelection of the 72-year old president Paul Biya in October 2004, thus enhancing the chances of continued domination by the ruling party until the end of his term in 2011. By 2006, appeals were being heard in Biya's home province in favour of a constitutional amendment that would allow him to run for another term when his current term expires. However, against the backdrop of worsening social conditions and high poverty, students protested and conducted strikes for several weeks in April 2005, and clashes with police led to two student deaths. Opposition parties registered their intention to block any attempt to amend the constitution that would allow Biya to run for a third term.

In early 2006 a final resolution to the dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria over the oil-rich [[Bakassi peninsula]] was expected. In October 2002, the International Court of Justice had ruled in favour of Cameroon. Nonetheless, a lasting solution would require agreement by both countries’ presidents, parliaments, and by the [[United Nations]]. The peninsula was the site of fighting between the two countries in 1994 and again in June 2005, which led to the death of a Cameroonian soldier.

==Football==
Cameroon has received some international attention following the relative success of its [[Cameroon national football team|football team]]. It has qualified for the FIFA World Cup on a number of occasions. Its most notable performance was at [[Italia 90]], when the team beat [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], the then reigning Champions in the opening game; Cameroon eventually lost in extra time in the Quarter Finals to [[England national football team|England]].

Prominent footballers from Cameroon include:
*[[Roger Milla]]
*[[Samuel Eto'o]]
*[[Rigobert Song]]
*[[Thomas Nkono]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Cameroon Map.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Map Of Cameroon]]

At {{convert|183568|mi2|km2|abbr=on|lk=off}}, Cameroon is the world's 57rd-largest country. It is comparable in size to [[Papua New Guinea]], and somewhat larger than the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. Cameroon's landmass is {{convert|181252|mi2|km2|abbr=on|lk=off}}, with {{convert|2317|mi2|km2|abbr=on|lk=off}} of water.

The country is located in Central and West Africa, bordering the Bight of Biafra, between Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria.

Cameroon is sometimes described as &quot;Africa in miniature&quot; because it exhibits all the major climates and vegetation of the continent: mountains, desert, rain forest, savanna grassland, and ocean coastland. Cameroon can be divided into five geographic zones. These are distinguished by dominant physical, climatic, and vegetative features.

==Natural regions==
[[Image:Cameroon Topography.png|thumb|Topography of Cameroon]]
{{MapLibrary|Cameroon_sat.png|Cameroon}}
Cameroon's coastal plain extends {{convert|10|to|50|mi|km|1}} inland from the [[Gulf of Guinea]] (part of the Atlantic Ocean) to the edge of a plateau. In the former western state, however, the mass of [[Mount Cameroon]] reaches almost to the sea.  The plain is densely forested including areas of [[Central African mangroves]] especially around [[Douala]] and in the estuary of the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] on the border with [[Nigeria]].

The low [[South Cameroon Plateau], rising from the coastal plain and dominated by tropical rain forest, has an average elevation of {{convert|1500|to|2000|ft|m|0|lk=in}}. It is less humid than the coast.

In western Cameroon is an irregular chain of mountains, hills, and plateaus that extend from Mt. Cameroon almost to [[Lake Chad]] at the northern tip of the country. This region includes the [[Bamenda highlands|Bamenda]], [[Bamiléké highlands|Bamiléké]], and [[Mambilla highlands]]. It also contains some of the country's most fertile soils, notably around volcanic Mt. Cameroon. This area of tropical forest has been categorised by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as the [[Cameroonian Highlands forests]] [[ecoregion]] with [[Mount Cameroon and Bioko Montane Forests|Mount Cameroon]] considered separately because as an active volcano it has a distinct environment from the other mountains.

From the forested southern plateau the land rises northward to the grassy, rugged [[Adamaoua highlands|Adamaoua]] (Adamawa) highlands. Stretching across Cameroon from the western mountain area, the Adamaoua forms a barrier between the north and south. Its average elevation is {{convert|3400|ft|m|0}}.

The northern [[savanna|savanna plain]] extends from the edge of the Adamaoua to Lake Chad. Its characteristic vegetation is scrub and grass. This is region of sparse rainfall and high median temperatures has been included as part of the [[East Sudanian savanna]] ecoregion.

[[Image:Mount Cameroon craters.jpg|thumb|left|Mount Cameroon craters]]

== Climate ==
''See also: [[Cameroon#Geography and climate|Climate]]''
 
The climate varies with terrain, from tropical along the coast to semiarid and hot in the north.
Exceedingly hot and humid, the coastal belt includes some of the wettest places on earth. For example, [[Debundscha]], at the base of Mt. Cameroon, has an average annual rainfall of {{convert|405|in|mm|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html#highpre Highest Average Annual Precipitation Extremes]. Global Measured Extremes of Temperature and Precipitation, [[National Climatic Data Center]]. August 9, 2004. Last accessed November 7, 2006. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivers==
The country has four patterns of drainage. In the south, the principal rivers—the [[Wouri River|Wouri]], [[Sanaga River|Sanaga]], [[Nyong River|Nyong]], and [[Ntem River|Ntem]]—flow southwestward or westward directly into the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. The [[Dja River|Dja]] and [[Kadei River|Kadeï]], however, drain southeastward into the [[Congo River]]. In northern Cameroon, the [[Benue River|Benoué River]] (Benue) runs north and west, eventually into the Niger, while the [[Logone River]] flows northward into [[Lake Chad]].

Only part of Lake Chad lies within Cameroon. The rest belongs to [[Chad]], Nigeria, and Niger. The lake varies in size according to seasonal rainfall.

Some of the borders of Cameroon follow rivers, including the [[Aïna River]] and [[Ntem River]].

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Cameroon]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

The '''demographic profile of Cameroon''' is complex for a country of its population.  [[Cameroon]] comprises an estimated 250 distinct [[ethnic groups]], which may be formed into five large regional-cultural divisions: 
* '''western highlanders''' ('''[[Semi-Bantu]]''' or '''grassfielders'''), including the [[Bamileke]], [[Bamum people|Bamum]] (or ''Bamoun''), and many smaller [[Tikar]] groups in the [[Northwest Province, Cameroon|Northwest]] (est. 38% of total population); 
* '''coastal tropical forest peoples''', including the [[Bassa people (Cameroon)|Bassa]], [[Duala people|Duala]] (or ''Douala''), and many smaller groups in the [[Southwest Province, Cameroon|Southwest]] (12%); 
* '''southern tropical forest peoples''', including the [[Beti-Pahuin]], Bulu (a subgroup of Beti-Pahuin), Fang (subgroup of Beti-Pahuin), [[Maka people|Maka]], [[Njem]], and [[Baka (nomadic Central African people)|Baka]] [[pygmy|pygmies]] (18%);
* '''predominantly [[Islam]]ic peoples''' of the northern semi-arid regions (the [[Sahel]]) and central highlands, including the [[Fula people|Fulani]] ({{lang-fr|Peul ''or'' Peuhl}}; {{lang-ff|Fulɓe}}) (14%); ''and'' 
* '''the &quot;[[Kirdi]]&quot;''', non-Islamic or recently Islamic peoples of the northern desert and central highlands (18%).

An up-to-date demographic profile is unavailable from the country's government, which hasn't published census data since 1976.

The Cameroon government held two national censuses during the country's first 44 years as an independent country, in 1976 and again in 1987.  Results from the second head count were never published.  A third census, expected to take years to product results, began on November 11, 2005, with a three-week interviewing phase.  It is one of a series of projects and reforms required by the [[International Monetary Fund]] as prerequisites for foreign [[debt relief]].

{{Politics of Cameroon}}
'''Politics of Cameroon''' takes place in a framework of a [[unitary republic|unitary]] [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Cameroon]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[National Assembly of Cameroon]].

==Political background==
The government adopted legislation in 1990 to authorize the formation of multiple [[political party|political parties]] and ease restrictions on forming animalistic associations and private newspapers. Cameroon' s first multiparty legislative and presidential elections were held in 1992 followed by [[municipal]] elections in 1996 and another round of legislative and presidential elections in 1997. Because the government refused to consider opposition demands for an independent election commission, the three major opposition parties boycotted the October 1997 presidential election, which Biya easily won. The leader of one of the opposition parties, [[Bello Bouba Maigari]] of the [[NUDP]], subsequently joined the government.

Cameroon has a number of independent newspapers. [[Censorship]] was abolished in 1996, but the government sometimes seizes or suspends newspapers and occasionally arrests [[journalist]]s. Although a 1990 law authorizes private radio and television stations, the government has not granted any licenses as of March 1998.

The Cameroonian Government's [[human rights]] record has been improving over the years but remains flawed. There continue to be reported abuses, including beatings of detainees, arbitrary arrests, and illegal searches. The judiciary is frequently corrupt, inefficient, and subject to political influence.

Worthy of note is the fact that Cameroon is the only country in which two Constitutions are applicable side-by-side. For example, the 1972 Constitution designates the Prime Minister as constitutional successor of the Head of State in case of incapacity, death, resignation or unaccountable absence of the incumbent. Contrarily, the 1996 Constitutional Reform designates the President of the Senate as constitutional successor; but the Senate (provided for by 1996 Reform) does not exist. Apart from increasing the presidential mandate from 5 years to 7 years, very few amendments of the 1996 Constitutional Reform have been applied.

==Executive branch==

The 1972 [[constitution]] of the '''Republic of Cameroon''' as modified by 1996 reforms provides for a strong central government dominated by the executive. The [[Presidents of Cameroon|president]] is empowered to name and dismiss [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] members (regardless of parliamentary representation), [[judge]]s, [[general]]s, provincial [[governor]]s, [[prefect]]s, [[sub-prefect]]s, and heads of Cameroon's [[parastatal]] (about 100 state-controlled) firms, obligate or disburse expenditures, approve or [[veto]] regulations, declare states of emergency, and appropriate and spend profits of parastatal firms. The president is not required to consult the National Assembly.

The judiciary is subordinate to the executive branch's [[Ministry of Justice of Cameroon|Ministry of Justice]]. The [[Supreme Court]] may review the constitutionality of a law only at the president's request.

All local government officials are employees of the central government's Ministry of Territorial Administration, from which local governments also get most of their budgets.

While the president, the minister of justice, and the president's judicial advisers (the Supreme Court) top the judicial hierarchy, traditional rulers, courts, and councils also exercise functions of government. Traditional courts still play a major role in domestic, property, and [[probate law]]. [[Tribal law]]s and customs are honored in the formal court system when not in conflict with national law. Traditional rulers receive stipends from the national government.

==Legislative branch==
The 180-member National Assembly meets in ordinary session three times a year (March/April, June/July, and November/December), and has seldom, until recently, made major changes in legislation proposed by the executive. Laws are adopted by majority vote of members present or, if the president demands a second reading, of a total membership.

Following government pledges to reform the strongly centralized 1972 constitution, the National Assembly adopted a number of amendments in December 1995 which were promulgated in January 1996. The amendments call for the establishment of a 100-member [[senate]] as part of a [[bicameral legislature]], the creation of regional councils, and the fixing of the presidential term to 7 years, renewable once. One-third of senators are to be appointed by the President, and the remaining two-thirds are to be chosen by indirect elections. As of July 2008, the government has not established the Senate or regional councils.

==Political parties and elections==

==Judicial branch==
The judiciary is subordinate to the executive branch's [[Ministry of Justice of Cameroon|Ministry of Justice]]. The [[Supreme Court of Cameroon|Supreme Court]] may review the constitutionality of a law only at the president's request.

==International organization participation==
Cameroon is member of:
[[Agence de Coopération Culturelle et Technique|ACCT]], [[ACP (Lomé Convention)|ACP]], [[African Development Bank|AfDB]], [[BDEAC]], [[Commonwealth of Nations|C]], [[CEEAC]], [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa|ECA]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], [[FZ]], [[G-19]], [[Group of 77|G-77]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], [[International Criminal Court|ICC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]], [[International Development Association|IDA]], [[IDB]], [[International Fund for Agricultural Development|IFAD]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|IFRCS]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]], [[International Mobile Satellite Organization|Inmarsat]], [[Intelsat]], [[Interpol]], [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]], [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], [[International Trade Union Confederation|ITUC]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], [[Organisation of African Unity|OAU]], [[Organization of the Islamic Conference|OIC]], [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons|OPCW]], [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|PCA]], [[Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa|UDEAC]], [[United Nations|UN]], [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UNCTAD]], [[UNESCO]], [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UNIDO]], [[United Nations Institute for Training and Research|UNITAR]], [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]], [[World Customs Organization|WCO]], [[World Federation of Trade Unions|WFTU]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]], [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]], [[World Tourism Organization|WToO]], [[World Trade Organization|WTrO]]

For a quarter-century following independence, '''Cameroon''' was one of the most prosperous countries in [[Africa]]. The drop in commodity prices for its principal [[export]]s &amp;mdash;[[petroleum]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[coffee]], and [[cotton]] &amp;mdash; in the mid-1980s, combined with an overvalued [[currency]] and economic mismanagement, led to a decade-long [[recession]]. Real per capita [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] fell by more than 60% from 1986 to 1994. The current account and fiscal [[deficit]]s widened, and [[foreign debt]] grew. Yet because of its [[oil reserves]] and favorable agricultural conditions, Cameroon still has one of the best-endowed primary commodity economies in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

[[Image:Bakweri cocoyam farmer from Cameroon.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Cameroonian farmers tend to cultivate at the subsistence level.]]The government embarked upon a series of economic reform programs supported by the [[World Bank]] and [[IMF]] beginning in the late 1980s. Many of these measures have been painful; the government slashed [[civil service]] salaries by 65% in 1993. The [[CFA franc]] &amp;mdash; the common currency of Cameroon and 13 other African states &amp;mdash; was devalued by 50% in January 1994. The government failed to meet the conditions of the first four IMF programs.

Recent signs, however, are encouraging. As of March 1998, Cameroon's fifth IMF program &amp;mdash; a 3-year enhanced structural adjustment program approved in August 1997 &amp;mdash; is on track. Cameroon has rescheduled its [[Paris Club]] debt at favorable terms. GDP has grown by about 5% a year beginning in 1995. There is cautious optimism that Cameroon is emerging from its long period of economic hardship.
[[Image:2006Cameroonian exports.PNG|thumb|left|200px|Cameroonian exports in 2006]]
The [[Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility]] (ESAF) signed recently by the IMF and Government of Cameroon calls for greater macroeconomic planning and financial accountability; [[privatization]] of most of Cameroon's nearly 100 remaining non-financial parastatal enterprises; elimination of state marketing board [[monopoly|monopolies]] on the export of cocoa, certain coffees, and cotton; privatization and price competition in the [[banking]] sector; implementation of the 1992 [[labor code]]; a vastly improved judicial system; and political liberalization to boost investment.

[[France]] is Cameroon's main trading partner and source of private investment and [[foreign aid]]. Cameroon has an investment guaranty agreement and a bilateral accord with the [[United States]]. USA investment in Cameroon is about $1 million, most of it in the oil sector. Inflation has been brought back under control.

==Finance and Banking==

Cameroon’s financial system is the largest in the CEMAC region. Access to financial services is limited, particularly for SMEs. Aside from a traditional tendency for banks to prefer dealing with large, established companies, determining factors are also found in interest rates for loans to SMEs being capped at 15 percent and being heavily taxed. As of 2006, bank loans to SMEs hardly reached 15 percent of total outstanding loans.

Less than 5 percent of Cameroonians have access to a bank account. While the microfinance sector is consequently becoming increasingly important, its development is hampered by a loose regulatory and supervisory framework for microfinance institutions (MFIs). The banking sector is highly concentrated and dominated by foreign commercial banks. 6 out of the 11 largest commercial banks are foreign-owned, and the three largest banks hold more than 50 percent of total financial system assets. While foreign banks generally display good solvency ratios, small domestic banks are in a much weaker position. Their capitalization is well below the average of banks in the CEMAC region and their profits are close to 2 percent, compared to 20 percent for foreign banks in the country. This is partially explained by the high levels of non-performing loans, which reached 12 percent in 2007, leading to most banks holding large amounts of excess reserves as a percentage of deposits and large levels of unutilized liquidity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfw4a.org/cameroon/cameroon-financial-sector-profile.html MFW4A]&lt;/ref&gt;

Railways in [[Cameroon]] are operated by [[Camrail]], a [[subsidiary]] of [[France|French]] investment group [[Bolloré]].  As of 2008, the country had an estimated 987&amp;nbsp;km of {{RailGauge|1000}} [[Rail gauge|gauge]] track.
In 2007, the traffic on the line was estimated to be 1Mt per year freight, including 1 million passengers per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/37/2/36735844.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Lagos-Mombasa Highway]]
* [[Tripoli-Cape Town Highway]]
Cameroon's central location in the network means that efforts to close the gaps which exist in the network across Central Africa rely on the Cameroon's participation in maintaining the network, and the network has the potential to have a profound influence on Cameroon's regional trade. Except for the several relatively good toll roads which connect major cities (all of them one-lane) roads are poorly maintained and subject to inclement weather, since only 10% of the roadways are tarred. It is likely for instance that within a decade, a great deal of trade between West Africa and Southern Africa will be moving on the network through Yaoundé.

Prices of petrol rose steadily in 2007 and 2008, leading to a transport union strike in Douala on 25 February 2008. The strike quickly escalated into [[2008 Cameroonian anti-government protests|violent protests]] and spread to other major cities. The uprising finally subsided on 29 February.&lt;ref&gt;Nkemngu, Martin A. (11 March 2008). &quot;[http://www.cameroon-tribune.net/article.php?lang=Fr&amp;oled=j11032008&amp;idart=9281&amp;olarch= Facts and Figures of the Tragic Protests]&quot;, ''[[Cameroon Tribune]]''.

== Waterways ==
2,090&amp;nbsp;km; of decreasing importance.  Navigation mainly on the [[Benue]] river; limited during rainy season.

== Seaports and harbors ==
Of the operating maritime ports in Cameroon, [[Douala]] is the busiest and most important. Lesser ports include [[Kribi]], used chiefly for the export of [[wood]], and [[Limbé]], used only for palm-oil exports. [[Garoua]], on the [[Benoué River]], is the main river port, but it is active only from July to September. In 2005, Cameroon’s merchant fleet consisted of one petroleum tanker, totalling 169,593 GRT.

* [[Douala]] - main port, railhead, and second largest city.
* [[Bonaberi]] - [[railhead]] to northwest
* [[Garoua]]
* [[Kribi]] - oil pipeline from [[Chad]]
** [[Kribi South]] - proposed iron ore export port, about 40&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Kribi]].
* [[Tiko]]

==Pipelines==
889&amp;nbsp;km of oil line (2008)

== Airports ==
The main international airport is the [[Douala International Airport]]. Secondary international airports are at [[Yaoundé]] and Garoua. In total, there were 34 airports in 2008, only 10 of which had paved runways. Among the international airlines serving Cameroon are Alitalia, Swiss, Iberia and [[Air Mali]].

The '''[[Cameroon]]ian Armed Forces''' generally has been an apolitical force where [[civilian control of the military]] predominates.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Traditional dependence on the [[France|French]] defense capability, although reduced, continues to be the case as French military advisers remain closely involved in preparing the Cameroonian forces for deployment to the contested [[Bakassi Peninsula]]. The armed forces number 37,000-38,000 personnel in ground, air, and naval forces.

The Cameroonian armed forces have bases spread all over Cameroon, including in [[Ngaoundéré]]. Air Force bases are located in [[Garoua]], [[Yaoundé]], [[Douala]] and [[Bamenda]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

&quot;China has an ongoing military-military relationship with Cameroon, which includes training for Cameroonian military students each year in China, technical advisors to assist in repairing Cameroonian military vehicles and naval vessels, and Chinese military sales.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikileaks]] [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] 10YAOUNDE95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Army ==
With 16,200 men (including a rate of feminization of nearly 10%) the Army remains the most important component in terms of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/actions-france_830/defense-securite_9035/cooperation-securite-defense_9037/revue-freres-armes_12582/freres-armes-258-dossier-cameroun_18857/dossier_19041/armee-terre_64741.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Army is under the responsibility of the Chief of Staff, [[Général de division]] Nkoa Atenga, whose staff is in [[Yaounde]].

Currently the organization dates from 2001 with a distribution in several types of units : combat units, response units (unités d’intervention), unités de soutien et d’appui et finally special reserve units as part of 3 joint military régions (''interarmees'') and the 10 military land sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Revue Freres Armees, French Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;

Army units have been trained and equipped to fight in the swampy coastal terrain facing the [[Bakassi peninsula]]. Although prepared for an armed conflict with Nigeria in recent years, the Cameroon Army does not have operational experience against other forces, therefore, it is not possible to assess its ability to respond to changing threats and opposing tactics.

==Cameroonian Navy==
[[Image:Cameroonian navy sailors.jpg|right|thumb|Cameroonian navy sailors prepare to perform a visit, board, search and seizure drill on 21 November 2006 in [[Douala]] during a joint exercise with the US military.]]
The navy has two patrol boats. There are about 1100 troops in the navy including Naval Infantry.

Around May 1999, [[Philip Njaru]] wrote a newspaper article where he alleged ill-treatment of civilians conducted by the 11th Navy Battalion based in Ekondo-Titi. In late May Njaru was approached by the local [[captain (Navy)|captain]] who asked Njaru &quot;to stop writing such articles and to disclose his sources&quot;. Refusing to do this, Njaru five days later found his house encircled by armed soldiers, and escaped to [[Kumba]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UN&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/40142/Njaru-v-Cameroon-HRC-Decision |title=Njaru v Cameroon HRC Decision |accessdate=2008-09-14 |work= |publisher=hosted by Scribd |date=3 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, he was assaulted by police in June 2001, with no particular reason stated.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN&quot;/&gt; Njaru complained to the local authorities, but later learned that &quot;his complaint had not been received&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN&quot;/&gt;

Cameroon's Marine Nationale République modernised and increased its capabilities during 2000 with the acquisition of a number of small Rodman patrol craft and the retirement of some small older craft. A number of small patrol boats have been acquired or ordered from France. Latest estimates indicate naval strength consists of two combat patrol vessels, three coastal patrol vessels and approximately 30 smaller inshore and river patrol craft allocated to both the navy and the local gendarmerie. These include two 135 tonne Yunnan-class landing craft, which are able to carry and launch smaller craft for troop insertions.Some effort has been made to assess equipment needs to bring L'Audacieux P103 and Bakassi P104 to an effective combat status. This has resulted in weapons capabilities being reduced in favour of an increase in serviceability and the service is now effectively without missile attack capabilities. Bakassi (a Type P 48S missile patrol craft) completed a major refit at Lorient, France in August 1999. This included removing the Exocet missile system and EW equipment, and fitting a funnel aft of the mainmast to replace the waterline exhausts. New radars were also installed. Bakassi is now armed only with 40&amp;nbsp;mm cannon. Although the Bizerte (Type PR 48 large patrol craft) class L'Audacieux is fitted for SS 12M missiles these are not embarked and its operational status is in some doubt, having not been reported at sea since 1995. The Quartier-Maître Alfred Moto patrol boat was listed as out of service in 1991 but was reactivated

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Cameroon}}
[[Cameroon]]'s noncontentious, low-profile approach to foreign relations puts it squarely in the middle of other [[Africa]]n and developing country states on major issues. It supports the principles of [[noninterference]] in the affairs of third world countries and increased assistance to underdeveloped countries. Cameroon is an active participant in the [[United Nations]], where its voting record demonstrates its commitment to causes that include international [[peacekeeping]], the [[rule of law]], [[environmentalism|environmental protection]], and [[Third World]] economic development. In the UN and other [[human rights]] fora, Cameroon's non-confrontational approach has generally led it to avoid criticizing other countries.

Cameroon enjoys good [[Cameroon-United States relations|relations with the United States]] and other developed countries. Cameroon enjoys generally good relations with its African neighbors. It supports UN peacekeeping activities in [[Central Africa]].

==International Disputes==
Delimitation of international boundaries in the vicinity of [[Lake Chad]], the lack of which led to border incidents in the past, is complete and awaits ratification by Cameroon, [[Chad]], [[Niger]], and Nigeria; dispute with Nigeria over land and [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]] around the [[Bakasi Peninsula]] and Lake Chad is currently before the [[ICJ]], as is a dispute with [[Equatorial Guinea]] over the exclusive maritime economic zone.

Cameroon also faces a complaint filed with the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights|African Commission on Human Rights]] by the [[Southern Cameroons National Council|Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC)]] and the [[Southern Cameroons|Southern Cameroons Peoples Organisation (SCAPO)]] against the Government of the Republic of Cameroon, in which the complainants allege that the Republic of Cameroon is illegally occupying the territory of [[Southern Cameroons]]. The SCNC and SCAPO ultimately seek the independence of the territory of Southern Cameroons.&lt;ref name=

A ruling by the African Commission on Human Rights is awaited.

==Bilateral relationships==
Cameroon maintains significant bilateral relations with several countries.

===People's Republic of China===

The People's Republic of China has a number of health and infrastructure projects underway in Cameroon.In January 2007,China signed a series of economic agreements with Cameroon, giving more than $54 million in loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=China, Cameroon Sign Economic Agreements | date=31 January 2007 | publisher=Voice of America | url =http://voanews.com/english/archive/2007-01/2007-01-31-voa53.cfm | work =VOA News | pages = | accessdate =25 December 2008| language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equatorial Guinea===
Cameroon has a dispute with [[Equatorial Guinea]] over the exclusive maritime economic zone, which is currently before the ICJ.  They also have a dispute over an island at the mouth of the [[Ntem River]].

===France===

Cameroon has particularly close ties with [[France]], with whom it has numerous military, economic, and cultural agreements.

===Nigeria===

Cameroon is engaged in a sporadic armed conflict with Nigeria in the oil-rich [[Bakassi Peninsula]]. Cameroon has repeatedly demonstrated its preference for resolving this conflict through peaceful legal means and has submitted its case to the [[International Court of Justice]].  The two countries agree on maritime [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]].

===Russia===
{{main|Cameroon–Russia relations}}
Russia has an embassy in Yaoundé, and Cameroon has an embassy in Moscow.

===United States===

{{main|Cameroon – United States relations}}

The bilateral [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID) program in Cameroon closed for budgetary reasons in 1994.

===Canada===
Cameroon and Canada have established diplomatic ties since 1962 with three agreements and four protocoles signed in 1965. Both countries share the use of English and French as the two official languages as well as memberships in the [[Francophonie]] and the [[Commonwealth]].

==Multilateral Relations==
Apart from the United Nations, Cameroon is very active in other multilateral organisations or global institutions such as the [[Francophonie]], the [[Commonwealth]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Conference]],  [[The Group of 77]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], the [[African Union]] and [[the Economic Community of Central African States]].

==Refugees and internally displaced persons==
Refugees (country of origin): 20,000-30,000 (Chad); 3,000 (Nigeria); 24,000 (Central African Republic) (2007)

'''[[Cape Verde]]''' is a group of arid Atlantic islands which are home to a number of birds and reptiles and constitute a unique [[ecoregion]] in the [[World Wildlife Fund]] classification.

== Location and description ==

The Cape Verde Islands are located in the mid-Atlantic Ocean some {{convert|570|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} off the west coast of Africa. The landscape varies from dry plains to high active volcanoes with cliffs rising steeply from the ocean. The climate is arid.

The [[archipelago]] consists of 10 islands and 5 islets, divided into the windward ([[Barlavento Islands|Barlavento]]) and leeward ([[Sotavento Islands|Sotavento]]) groups. The six islands in the Barlavento group are [[Santo Antão, Cape Verde|Santo Antão]], [[São Vicente, Cape Verde|São Vicente]], [[Santa Luzia, Cape Verde|Santa Luzia]], [[São Nicolau, Cape Verde|São Nicolau]], [[Sal, Cape Verde|Sal]], and [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]]. The islands in the Sotavento group are [[Maio, Cape Verde|Maio]], [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]], [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]], and [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]]. All but Santa Luzia are inhabited.

Three islands &amp;ndash; Sal, Boa Vista, and Maio &amp;ndash; generally are level and lack natural water supplies. Mountains higher than {{convert|1280|m|ft|0}} are found on Santiago, Fogo, Santo Antão, and São Nicolau.

Sand carried by high winds has caused erosion on all islands, especially the windward ones. Sheer, jagged cliffs rise from the sea on several of the mountainous islands. The lack of natural vegetation in the uplands and coast also contributes to soil erosion. Only the interior valleys support natural vegetation.

== Borders ==

Cape Verde shares [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]] with [[Mauritania]] and [[Senegal]]. Cape Verde has signed [[Treaty|treaties]] with [[Maritime Delimitation Treaty (Cape Verde – Senegal)|Senegal]] and [[Maritime Delimitation Treaty (Cape Verde Mauritania)|Mauritania]] [[boundary delimitation|delimiting]] the specific boundaries. However, the two treaties conflict in their delimitation of the precise borders.

== Climate ==
''See also: [[Cape Verde#Geography and climate|Climate]]''

A cold Atlantic current produces an arid atmosphere around the archipelago. December–June is cool and dry, with temperatures at sea level averaging {{convert|21|C|F|1}}; July–November is warm and dry, with temperatures averaging {{convert|27|C|F|1}}. Although some rain comes during the latter season, rainfall is sparse overall and very erratic. Accumulations are generally around {{convert|130|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} annually in the northern islands and {{convert|300|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} in the south. The archipelago is subject to cyclical droughts; a devastating drought began in 1968 and was broken only briefly in 1975, 1978, 1984, and 1986.

Rainfall is irregular, historically causing periodic droughts and famines. The average precipitation per year in [[Praia]] is {{convert|240|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}. During the winter, storms blowing from the [[Sahara]] sometimes form dense dust clouds that obscure the sun; however, sunny days are the norm year round.

The ocean near Cape Verde is an area of [[tropical cyclone]] formation; since these storms have the whole Atlantic over which to develop as they move westward, they are among the most intense hurricanes, and are called [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]]s.

== Flora ==

Once the islands were covered with savanna on the plains and arid shrubland on the mountainsides, but over 500 years of human habtitation (since colonisation by the Portuguese in the 15th century) nearly all the original vegetation has been cleared by widespread agriculture including the grazing of goats, sheep and cattle and the planting of imported crop species. There are some remaining patches of dry forest high on steep mountainside including a number of endemic plant species, but these are inaccessible and hard to study.

== Fauna ==

There are four endemic bird species including the [[Raso Lark]] along with more common [[swifts]], [[larks]], [[warblers]], and [[sparrows]]. The islands are an important breeding site for seabirds including the [[Cape Verde Shearwater]] and [[Fea's Petrel]] (Pterodroma feae), which breeds only here and in [[Madeira]]. Santiago Island holds the only breeding site of the endemic and critically endangered [[Bourne's Heron]].  The 11 endemic reptile species include a giant gecko ([[Tarentola]] gigas), and there are other [[gecko]]s  and [[skink]]s in abundance. The giant skink ([[Macroscincus coctei]]) is now thought to be extinct.

== Threats and protection ==

Almost all of the natural environment has been destroyed by conversion to agriculture and logging for firewood, as well as natural [[soil erosion]], all of which has threatened several species of birds and reptiles. The remaining original forest exists at high altitudes only. Newer problems include illegal beach sand extraction and [[overfishing]] while the nesting birds are vulnerable to introduced mammals including cats and rats. 

; Environment - international agreements:
:* Party to: [[Biodiversity]], [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Climate Change]], [[Desertification]], [[Environmental Modification Convention|Environmental Modification]], [[Hazardous Wastes]], [[Law of the Sea]], [[Marine Dumping]], [[Nuclear Test Ban]]
:* Signed, but not ratified: None of the selected agreements

== Visiting the ecoregion ==

The higher altitudes of the islands are accessible on the islands of [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]], where there is a road to the volcano and walks up to the crater, and the mountainous [[Santo Antão, Cape Verde|Santo Antão]] where there are hiking routes. 

== Extreme points ==
* Northernmost Point - [[Ponta do Sol, Cape Verde|Ponta do Sol]] on [[Santo Antão, Cape Verde|Santao Antão]] Island
* Southernmost point - [[Ponta Nho Martinho]] on [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]]
* Westernmost point - [[Ponta Chao de Mongrade]] on [[Santo Antão, Cape Verde|Santao Antão]]* 
* Easternmost point - a cape about 5&amp;nbsp;km ESE of [[Tarales]] on [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]] island

* *''Note: this is also the western most point of Africa''

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Cape Verde]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

[[Image:IMG0053a.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Two Cape Verdean children playing marbles.]]

The [[Cape Verde]] [[archipelago]] was uninhabited when the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] discovered it in 1456. [[Africans|African]] slaves were brought to the islands to work on Portuguese plantations. As a result, Cape Verdeans are ''[[mulattos]]'' (''mestiços'' in Portuguese), who have mixed [[African]] and [[European ethnic groups|European]] origins. European ancestors also include [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[Italians|Italian]] seamen who were granted land by the [[Portuguese Empire]], followed by Portuguese settlers, exiles, and Portuguese Jews who were victims of the [[Portuguese Inquisition|Inquisition]]. Many foreigners from other parts of the world settled Cape Verde as their permanent country. Most of them were [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[French people|French]], [[British people|British]] ([[English people|English]]), [[Arab]] and Jewish (from [[Lebanon]] and [[Morocco]]), [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] (especially from [[Macau]]), [[United States|American]], and [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] (including people of [[Portuguese-Brazilian|Portuguese]] and [[Afro-Brazilian|African]] descent). All of these have been absorbed into the ''mestiço'' population.

Statistics from Portuguese administration in the sixties stated that the racial composition of the inhabitants was 78% of ''mestiços'', 21% of “Africans” (i.e. blacks) and 1% of “Europeans” (i.e. whites). Those figures have been overused in several sites, in spite of not being up to date. Since the independence in [[1975]] the official statistics in Cape Verde have no longer made statistics based on racial groups. Official sources&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidenciarepublica.cv/conteudos/a_republica/cabo_verde/ Presidência da República de Cabo Verde]&lt;/ref&gt; only states “the majority of the population is ''mulatto''” (“''…maioritariamente mestiça…''”) without stating any number. Ethnically, Cape Verdeans see themselves as a single group, regardless of being ''mulatto'', black or white.

Survival in a country with few natural resources has historically induced Cape Verdeans to emigrate. In fact, of the more than 1 million people of Cape Verdean ancestry in the world, only a little more than one-third actually live on the islands. Some 500,000 people of Cape Verdean ancestry live in the [[United States]], mainly in [[New England]]. Many people of Cape Verdean ancestry also live in [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Argentina]], and [[Senegal]]. Cape Verdean populations also settled [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[Canada]], and other [[Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries|CPLP countries]] ([[Angola]], [[Brazil]] and [[Guinea-Bissau]]). Since after independence from Portugal in 1975, a number of Cape Verdean students continued to be admitted every year at Portuguese high schools, polytechnical institutes and universities, through bilateral agreements between the Portuguese Government and the Cape Verdean Government. 

Although the official language is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], most Cape Verdeans speak [[Cape Verdean Creole]] (''Crioulo'' in Portuguese, ''Kriolu'' or ''Kriol'' in Cape Verdean Creole). There is a rich repertoire of literature and songs in Creole. In religion, the majority follow [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[Christianity]]. There are also some [[Protestants]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]]s and [[Islam|Muslims]].

I've put this section with a hidden text because &quot;Creole&quot;, &quot;African&quot; and &quot;European&quot; are not ethnic groups. The expression &quot;ethnic group&quot; refers to a group of people with a certain culture, and not with a certain color of skin or racial ancestry.

What concerns the ethnicity, the Cape Verdeans are fairly homogeneous, making up a single ethnic group. I'm waiting for suggestions for a better title for this section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Cape Verde}}
'''Politics of Cape Verde''' takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[Prime Minister of Cape Verde]] is the [[head of government]], and of a  [[multi-party system]].&lt;ref name=constitution&gt;{{cite web|url=http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/CapeVerde.pdf|title=Constitution of Cape Verde|year=1992|accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[National Assembly of Cape Verde|National Assembly]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.
The constitution first approved in 1980 and substantially revised in 1992 forms the basis of government organization. It declares that the government is the &quot;organ that defines, leads, and executes the general internal and external policy of the country&quot; and is responsible to the National Assembly.

==Political conditions==
Following independence in 1975, the [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC) established a one party political system. This became the [[African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde]] (PAICV) in 1980, as Cape Verde sought to distance itself from [[Guinea-Bissau]], following unrest in that country.

In 1991, following growing pressure for a more pluralistic society, multi-party elections were held for the first time.  The opposition party, the [[Movement for Democracy (Cape Verde)|Movement for Democracy]] (MpD), won the legislative elections, and formed the government. The MpD candidate also defeated the PAICV candidate in the presidential elections. In the 1996 elections, the MpD increased their majority, but in the 2001 the PAICV returned to power, winning both the Legislative and the Presidential elections. 

Generally, Cape Verde enjoys a stable democratic system. The elections have been considered free and fair, there is a free press, and the rule of law is respected by the State. In acknowledgment of this, [[Freedom House]] granted Cape Verde two 1s in its annual [[Freedom in the World]] report, a perfect score. It is the only African country to receive this score.

The Prime Minister is the head of the government and as such proposes other ministers and secretaries of state. The Prime Minister is nominated by the National Assembly and appointed by the President. The President is the head of state and is elected by popular vote for a five-year term; the most recent elections were held in 2006.

==Legislative branch==
The [[National Assembly of Cape Verde|National Assembly]] (''Assembleia Nacional'') has 72 members, elected for a five year term by [[proportional representation]].

In [[Cape Verde]], most of the transportation between islands is done by plane. There are regular flights to and from the major islands (Santiago, Sal and São Vicente), with less frequent flights to the other islands. Boat transportation is also available, though not widely used nor dependable. In the major cities, public bus transport runs periodically and taxis are common. In smaller towns, there are mostly hiaces and/or taxis.&lt;ref name=pc&gt;[http://www.peacecorps.gov/welcomebooks/cvwb655.pdf ''The Peace Corps Welcomes You to Cape Verde'']. [[Peace Corps]] (April 2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of transport ==
'''[[Railway]]s:'''
0&amp;nbsp;km - There are no railways in Cape Verde, although there was a short overhead conveyor system for salt from the open salt lake on Sal to the port at [[Pedro de Lume]] and a short stretch of rail track to the pier at [[Santa Maria, Cape Verde|Santa Maria]] used for a similar purpose. Both are now disused. 

'''Roadways:'''
&lt;br /&gt;''total:''
10,000&amp;nbsp;km including unpaved tracks accessible only to four wheel drive vehicles
&lt;br /&gt;''asphalt:''
360&amp;nbsp;km
&lt;br /&gt;''cobbled:''
5,000&amp;nbsp;km (2007 estimates)

The majority of Cape Verdean roads are paved with cobblestones cut from local [[basalt]]. Recent international aid has allowed the asphalting of a few roads, such as part of the highway between [[Tarrafal]] and [[Praia]] on [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] and the dual carriageway between [[Santa Maria, Cape Verde|Santa Maria]] and [[Espargos]] on Sal. A new ring road has been built from [[Praia International Airport]] around the city of Praia. 

The primary method of intercity and inter-village transport for Cape Verdeans is by [[aluguer]] shared taxis, commonly called ''Iass''. Few Cape Verdeans own cars, but ownership is rising rapidly with increasing prosperity, particularly on [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago Island]].

'''Ports and [[harbor]]s:'''
[[Mindelo]] on [[São Vicente, Cape Verde|São Vicente]] is the main port for cruise liners and the terminus for the ferry service to Santo Antão. A marina for yachts is undergoing enlargement (2007). [[Praia]] on [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] is a main hub for local ferry services to other islands. [[Palmeira, Cape Verde|Palmeira]] on [[Sal, Cape Verde|Sal]] supplies fuel for the main airport on the island, [[Amílcar Cabral International Airport]], and is important for the hotel construction taking place on the island. [[Porto Novo, Cape Verde|Porto Novo]] on [[Santo Antão, Cape Verde|Santo Antão]] is the only source for imports and exports of produce from the island as well as passenger traffic since the closure of the airstrip at Ponta do Sol. There are smaller harbors, essentially single jetties at [[Tarrafal de São Nicolau, Cape Verde (municipality)#Tarrafal de São Nicolau (town)|Tarrafal]] on [[São Nicolau, Cape Verde|São Nicolau]], [[Sal Rei]] on [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]], [[Vila do Maio, Cape Verde|Vila do Maio]] (Porto Inglês) on [[Maio, Cape Verde|Maio]], [[São Filipe, Cape Verde (municipality)#São Filipe(city)|São Filipe]] on [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]] and [[Furna (Brava), Cape Verde|Furna]] on [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]]. These act as terminals for the inter island ferry services which carry both freight and passengers. There are very small harbors, with protective breakwaters, essentially used by fishing boats at Tarrafal on Santiago, Pedra de Lume on Sal and Ponta do Sol on Santo Antão. Some offer suitable protection for small yachts on passage. The pier at Santa Maria on Sal used by both fishing and dive boats has been rehabilitated. 

'''[[Merchant marine]]:'''
&lt;br&gt;''total:''
10
&lt;br&gt;''ships by type:''
[[chemical tanker]] 1, trawler/[[cargo ship]] 5, passenger/cargo 5 
&lt;br&gt;''foreign-owned:'' 2 (Spain 1, UK 1) (2008)

Currently, the '''People's Revolutionary Armed Forces''' (FARP) of '''Cape Verde''' are undergoing major reorganisation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The force has two independent branches, the [[Army]] and the [[Coast Guard]]. Both branches have their own air arm made up of mostly [[surveillance]] and transport aircraft. The combined force comprises about 1,200 [[soldier]]s, [[marine (military)|marines]] and [[coast guard]] personnel.

In the future, however, the military will be reduced to about 1,000 men. The Branches are to be reshuffled as well. The [[Army]] is going to be called the [[Cape Verdean National Guard]], and it will be divided into three semi-autonomous branches: 1. The Military Police, 2. [[Cape Verdean Marines|Os Fuzileiros]] ([[marine (military)|Marines]]), and 3. the Infantry Battalion of the National Guard. A Special Operation Unit is being created and is going to be attached to the marine [[brigade]]. The Cape Verdean government aims to make the Armed Forces more flexible and able to deal with [[terrorism]], [[drug trafficking]], [[disaster relief]], and control its [[territorial waters]].

The former Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Solomon Passy]] proposed, Cape Verde may enter the [[OSCE]] and the [[NATO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://davidnoack.net/v2/2010/01/sprungbrett-nach-westafrika sprungbrett-nach-westafrika]&lt;/ref&gt;

Military equipment includes [[BRDM-2]] and [[T-55]] armoured vehicles, [[ZU-23-2]] and [[ZPU-4]] anti-aircraft guns, and [[AKM]]
and [[RPK]] small arms.&lt;br /&gt;

The Army also has its own air arm; after personnel training received from the [[USSR]] in 1982, three [[Antonov An-26]] aircraft were delivered to Cape Verde - these were believed to be the only military aircraft possessed by the nation.&lt;ref&gt;* ''World Aircraft Information Files.'' Brightstar Publishing, London.

The government has been in negotiations with China to acquire multirole helicopters for both military and civilian use.

{{Politics of Cape Verde}}
[[Cape Verde]] follows a policy of [[neutrality (international relations)|nonalignment]] and seeks cooperative relations with all friendly states. [[Angola]], [[Brazil]], the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Cuba]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Portugal]], [[Senegal]], [[Russia]], and the [[United States]] maintain embassies in [[Praia]].

Cape Verde is actively interested in foreign affairs, especially in [[Africa]]. It has [[Bilateralism|bilateral relations]] with some [[Lusophone]] nations and holds membership in a number of international organizations. It also participates in most international conferences on economic and political issues.

==Bilateral relations==
===Angola===
{{main|Angola – Cape Verde relations}}

Cape Verde signed a friendship accord with [[Angola]] in December 1975, shortly after Angola gained its independence. Cape Verde and [[Guinea-Bissau]] served as stop-over points for [[Cuban troops]] on their way to Angola to fight [[UNITA]] rebels and [[South Africa]]n troops. [[Prime Minister of Cape Verde|Prime Minister]] [[Pedro Pires]] sent [[FARP]] soldiers to Angola where they served as the personal bodyguards of [[Angolan President]] [[José Eduardo dos Santos]].&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite book|last=Lobban|first=Richard|year=1995|title=Cape Verde:Crioulo Colony to Independent Nation|pages=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===China===
In January 2007, [[Manuel Inocêncio Sousa]], Minister of Infrastructure, Transports and Sea, acknowledged the [[People's Republic of China]]'s importance to Cape Verde stating,

China has been a friend of Cape Verde even before it gained independence from [[Portugal]] 30 years ago. Bilateral relations have beenvery good: in 2002, for example, the trade value between our twocountries reached U.S.$1.8 million, in Chinese exports of light industryproducts and miscellaneous goods.

===Portugal===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===Senegal===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===United States===
{{main|Cape Verde-United States relations}}

The United States provided emergency [[humanitarian aid]] and economic assistance to Cape Verde in the period immediately following Cape Verde's independence, as well as after natural disasters, including a [[hurricane]] that struck the island of Brava in 1982, and after a severe [[volcanic eruption]] on Fogo in 1995. Cape Verde also is eligible for trade benefits under the [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]] (AGOA), and has signed an Open Skies agreement to facilitate air travel safety and expansion. On July 4, 2005, Cape Verde became the third country to sign a compact with the U.S. Government-funded [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]] (MCC); the five-year assistance package is worth over $110 million in addressing rural economic expansion, [[infrastructure]] development, and development of the credit sector.

The territory is a major world [[offshore financial centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tax/schemes/cayman.html|title=Tax me if you can.

==History==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}
{{Main|History of the Cayman Islands}}
The Cayman Islands were sighted by [[Christopher Columbus]], on 10 May 1503 on his fourth and final voyage to the [[New World]]. He named the islands ''Las Tortugas'' after the numerous [[sea turtle]]s there. The first recorded English visitor to the islands was [[Sir Francis Drake]], who landed there in 1586 and named them the Cayman Islands after [[caiman]], the [[Neo-Taino nations|Neo-Taino nations']] term for alligator.

The Cayman Islands remained largely uninhabited until the 17th century. A variety of people settled on the islands, including pirates, refugees from the [[Spanish Inquisition]], shipwrecked sailors, deserters from Oliver Cromwell's army in Jamaica, and slaves. The majority of Caymanians are of African and English descent, with considerable interracial mixing.

[[File:CaymanIslandsNationalMuseum.jpg|thumb|left|Cayman Islands National Museum]]The first recorded permanent inhabitant of the Cayman Islands, Isaac Bodden, was born on [[Grand Cayman]] around 1661. He was the grandson of the original settler named Bodden who was probably one of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s soldiers at the taking of [[Jamaica]] in 1655.

[[Kingdom of England|England]] took formal control of the Cayman Islands, along with Jamaica, under the [[Treaty of Madrid (1670)|Treaty of Madrid]] in 1670. Following several unsuccessful attempts, permanent settlement of the islands began in the 1730s. They were governed as a single colony with Jamaica until 1962 when they became a separate [[Crown colony]] and Jamaica became an independent [[Commonwealth realm]].

The Cayman Islands historically have been a tax-exempt destination. On February 8, 1794, the Caymanians rescued the crews of a group of ten [[merchant ship]]s, including HMS ''Convert''. The ships had struck a reef and run aground during rough seas. [[King George III]] rewarded the island with a promise never to introduce taxes as compensation for their generosity. An [[urban legend]] states that the true reason the Cayman Islands have never been taxed is that these merchant ships actually carried with them a member of the King's own family, his son [[William IV of England|Prince William]]. However this is not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zayas|1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island of Grand Cayman, which lies largely unprotected at sea level, was hit by [[Hurricane Ivan]] on 11–12 September 2004. Ivan's [[storm surge]] completely over-washed Grand Cayman, and an estimated 95% of the buildings on the island were either damaged or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Power, water and communications were disrupted in some areas for months. Ivan was the worst hurricane to hit the islands in 87 years. Grand Cayman began a major rebuilding process. Within two years, its [[infrastructure]] was nearly returned to pre-hurricane levels. Due to the tropical location of the islands, more hurricane or tropical systems have affected the Cayman Islands than any other region in the Atlantic basin. It has been brushed or directly hit, on average, every 2.23 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurricanecity.com/city/caymanislands.htm Grand Cayman's history with tropical systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Cayman Islands Map.svg|thumb|left|260px|Map of the Cayman Islands, showing 3 islands about {{convert|80|mi|km|disp=x| apart (|)}}.]]
{{Main|Geography of the Cayman Islands}}

The Cayman Islands are located in the western [[Caribbean Sea]] and are the peaks of a massive [[underwater ridge]], known as the Cayman Ridge, standing 8,000 feet (2,400 m) from the sea floor, which barely exceeds the surface. The islands lie in the northwest of the Caribbean Sea, south of Cuba and west of Jamaica. They are situated about 400 miles (650&amp;nbsp;km) south of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], 180 miles (300&amp;nbsp;km) south of [[Cuba]], and 195 miles (315&amp;nbsp;km) northwest of [[Jamaica]]. [[Grand Cayman]] is by far the biggest, with an area of 76 square miles (197&amp;nbsp;km²). The two &quot;Sister Islands&quot; of [[Cayman Brac]] and [[Little Cayman]] are located about 80 miles (130&amp;nbsp;km) east of Grand Cayman and have areas of 14 square miles (36&amp;nbsp;km²) and 10 square miles (25.9&amp;nbsp;km²) respectively.
&lt;!--Unsourced image removed: [[File:BracBluff.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The Bluff on Cayman Brac]]--&gt;
[[File:Waterfront, George Town, Grand Cayman.jpg|thumb|right|George Town waterfront]]

All three islands were formed by large [[coral heads]] covering submerged ice age peaks of western extensions of the Cuban [[Sierra Maestra]] range and are mostly flat. One notable exception to this is [[The Bluff]] on Cayman Brac's eastern part, which rises to 140&amp;nbsp;feet (42.6&amp;nbsp;m) above sea level, the highest point on the island.

Cayman [[birds|avian fauna]] includes two [[Endemism|endemic]] subspecies of [[Amazona]] parrots: ''Amazona leucocephala hesterna'', or Cayman Brac Parrot, native only to Cayman Brac, and ''Amazona leucocephala caymanensis'' or [[Grand Cayman Parrot]], which is native to the Cayman Islands, forested areas of Cuba and the [[Isla de la Juventud]]. Another notable fauna is the critically endangered [[Blue Iguana]], which is native to Grand Cayman.{{Citation needed|&quot;critical&quot; needs citation, the rest will follow|date=December 2010}} There is also the [[agouti]] and the [[Booby|Booby Birds]] on Cayman Brac.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

{{Main|Demographics of the Cayman Islands}}

The Cayman Islands have more registered businesses than they have people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/country_profiles/3709816.stm Regions and territories: Cayman Islands]. BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; The latest population estimate of the Cayman Islands is about 55,700 as of 2009, representing a mix of more than 100 nationalities. Out of that number, about half are of Caymanian descent. About 60% of the population is of mixed race (mostly mixed African-European). The islands are almost exclusively [[Christian]], with large numbers of [[Presbyterian]]s and [[Catholics]]. The vast majority of the population resides on [[Grand Cayman]], followed by [[Cayman Brac]] and [[Little Cayman]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cj.html |title = CIA - The World Factbook - Cayman Islands |accessdate = 2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capital of the Cayman Islands is [[George Town, Cayman Islands|George Town]], which is located on the southwest coast of Grand Cayman.

===Population of the cities (Districts)===
According to the Cayman Islands 2010 census&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caymannewsservice.com/headline-news/2011/03/22/bodden-town-grows-79&lt;/ref&gt; the estimated resident population is 54,878 people, broken down as follows:

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Cayman Islands}}

[[File:Stingray City, Cayman Islands.jpg|thumb|[[Stingrays]] are one of the biggest tourist attractions.]]

With an average income of around KYD$47,000, Caymanians have the highest standard of living in the Caribbean. According to the [[CIA World Factbook]], the Cayman Islands GDP per capita is the 14th highest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html |title = CIA - The World Factbook - Rank Order - GDP - per capita (PPP) |accessdate = 2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands print their own currency, the [[Cayman Islands Dollar]] (KYD), which is pegged to the [[U.S. dollar]] at a fixed rate of 1 KYD = 1.25 USD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cimoney.com.ky/section/currency/default.aspx?id=65 The History of Cayman Islands Currency]&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's primary source of income is [[indirect tax]]ation: there is no [[income tax]], [[capital gains tax]] or [[corporation tax]]. An [[import duty]] of 5% to 22% (Automobiles 29.5% to 100%) is levied against goods imported into the islands. Few goods are exempt; notable examples include books, cameras and [[infant formula]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Tourism===
[[File:Cayman Islands 2005 087.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of West Bay, Grand Cayman.]]

One of [[Grand Cayman]]'s (GCM) main attractions is [[Seven Mile Beach, Grand Cayman|Seven Mile Beach]], on which a number of the island's hotels and resorts are located. Historical sites in GCM, such as Pedro St. James Castle in BoddenTown, also attract visitors. Tourists also visit the Sister Islands, Little Cayman&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This week's dream: diving and lazing on Little Cayman&quot;, (29 November 2008) [[The Week]] p. 39, Dennis Publishers, UK&lt;/ref&gt; and Cayman Brac.&lt;ref&gt;Skip Harper, &quot;Adventuring in Cayman Brac&quot;,Head and Toe Publishers, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA, 2001, ISBN 0-9640645-2-0&lt;/ref&gt;

All three islands offer [[scuba diving]], and the Cayman Islands are home to several snorkeling locations, where tourists can swim with [[stingray]]s (including [[Stingray City, Grand Cayman]]). There are two [[shipwreck]]s off the shores of Cayman Brac, including the [[Sinking_ships_for_wreck_diving_sites#List_of_ships_sunk_for_wreck_diving|MV Keith Tibbetts]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

[[USS Kittiwake (ASR-13)]] was decommissioned on 30 September 1994 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on the same day. Her title was transferred in November 2008 for an undisclosed amount to the government of the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands government intended to use Kittiwake to form a new artificial reef. Originally intended to be sunk off Seven Mile Beach, Grand Cayman in June 2009, it was finally sunk on 5 January 2011.

Other Grand Cayman tourist attractions include the Ironshore landscape of [[Hell, Grand Cayman|Hell]], the {{convert|23|acre|m2|sing=on}} marine theme park [[Boatswain]]'s Beach, also home of the Cayman Turtle Farm, the production of gourmet [[sea salt]], and the Mastic Trail, a hiking trail through the forests in the centre of the island.

===Financial services industry===
The Cayman Islands are a major international financial centre. The biggest sectors are &quot;[[banking]], [[hedge fund]] formation and investment, structured finance and securitization, [[captive insurance]], and general corporate activities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GAO&quot;&gt;United States Government Accountability Office (2008). [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08778.pdf GAO Report to the Chairman and Ranking Member], Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation and supervision of the [[financial services]] industry is the responsibility of the [[Cayman Islands Monetary Authority]] (CIMA).

The Cayman Islands are the fifth-largest banking centre in the world,&lt;ref&gt;Places in the sun. (2007, 24 February). The Economist, no. 382 (8517 suppl.), 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt; with $1.5 trillion in banking liabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;GAO&quot;/&gt; There are 279 banks (as of June 2008), 19 of which are licensed to conduct banking activities with domestic (Cayman-based) and international clients, the remaining 260 are licensed to operate on an international basis with only limited domestic activity. Financial services generated CI$1.2 billion of GDP in 2007 (55% of the total economy), 36% of all employment and 40% of all government revenue. In 2010, the country ranked fifth internationally in terms of value of liabilities booked in the Cayman Islands and sixth in terms of assets booked. It has branches of 40 of the world’s 50 largest banks. The Cayman Islands are the second largest captive domicile in the world with more than 700 captives, writing more than US$7.7 billion of premiums and with US$36.8 billion of assets under management.&lt;ref&gt;Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (11 July 2008), [http://www.cimoney.com.ky/section/regulatoryframework/sub/default.aspx?section=PD&amp;id=666 Regulatory Framework: Statistics]. Retrieved 25 July 2008 from:&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of service providers. These include global financial institutions including [[HSBC]], [[UBS]] and [[Goldman Sachs]]; over 80 administrators, leading accountancy practices (incl. the [[Big Four auditors]]), and offshore law practices including [[Maples &amp; Calder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HedgeWeek&quot;&gt;[http://www.hedgeweek.com/articles/detail.jsp?content_id=12880 Bringing Cayman's Mutual Funds Law up to speed] (1 October 2005). Hedge Week.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the introduction of the [[Mutual fund|Mutual Funds]] Law in 1993, which has been copied by jurisdictions around the world,&lt;!---the &quot;copied&quot; phrase needs to be broken out as a separate stand-alone sentence and justified with a ref and not be a throwaway phrase in the middle of another sentence---&gt; the Cayman Islands have grown to be the world’s leading offshore hedge fund jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;HedgeWeek&quot;/&gt; In June 2008, it passed 10,000 [[hedge fund]] registrations, and over the year ending June 2008 CIMA reported a net growth rate of 12% for hedge funds.&lt;ref&gt;CayCompass.com (29 July 2008), [http://www.caycompass.com/cgi-bin/CFPnews.cgi?ID=1032423 10,000–plus funds registered in CI].&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the mid-late 1990s, [[offshore financial centres]], such as the Cayman Islands, came under increasing pressure from the [[OECD]] for their allegedly harmful tax regimes, where the [[OECD]] wished to prevent low-tax regimes from having an advantage in the global marketplace. The [[OECD]] threatened to place the Cayman Islands and other [[financial centres]] on a &quot;black list&quot; and impose sanctions against them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogoff&quot;&gt;Natasha L. Rogoff (n.d.), [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tax/schemes/cayman.html Haven or havoc?].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Cayman Islands successfully avoided being placed on the [[OECD]] black list in 2000 by committing to regulatory reform to improve transparency and begin information exchange with OECD member countries about their citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogoff&quot;/&gt;

In 2004, under pressure from the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the Cayman Islands agreed in principle to implement the [[European Union Savings Directive]] (EUSD), but only after securing some important benefits for the financial services industry in the Cayman Islands. As the Cayman Islands are not subject to [[EU]] laws, the implementation of the EUSD is by way of bilateral agreements between each EU member state and the Cayman Islands. The government of the Cayman Islands agreed on a model agreement, which set out how the EUSD would be implemented with the Cayman Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Appleby, [http://www.ask.bm/uploaded/Publication/641_File_5.pdf Guide to the EU Savings Directive: Its relevance for Cayman Islands Investment Funds].&lt;/ref&gt;

A report published by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), in March 2005, assessing supervision and regulation in the Cayman Islands' banking, insurance and securities industries, as well as its [[money laundering]] regime, recognised the jurisdiction's comprehensive regulatory and compliance frameworks. &quot;An extensive program of legislative, rule and guideline development has introduced an increasingly effective system of regulation, both formalizing earlier practices and introducing enhanced procedures,&quot; noted IMF assessors. The report further stated that &quot;the supervisory system benefits from a well-developed banking infrastructure with an internationally experienced and qualified workforce as well as experienced lawyers, accountants and auditors,&quot; adding that, &quot;the overall compliance culture within Cayman is very strong, including the compliance culture related to AML (anti-money laundering) obligations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cayman Islands Financial Services (n.d.). [http://www.caymanfinance.gov.ky/portal/page?_pageid=1186,1549172&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL International Cooperation].&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, 2009, United States President [[Barack Obama]] declared his intentions to curb the use of financial centres by multinational corporations. In his speech, he singled out the Cayman Islands as a tax shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Obama Speech on Financial Centres May 5, 2009, [http://www.politicalcrave.com/2009/05/04/transcript-obama-preaches-hypocrisy-against-tax-havens-and-tax-loopholes/].&lt;/ref&gt; This perhaps referred to [[Ugland House]], a financial institution in the Cayman Islands.

The next day, the Cayman Island Financial Services Association submitted an open letter to the President detailing The Cayman Islands' role in international finance and its value to the US financial system.&lt;ref&gt;CIFSA Open Letter to President Obama, [http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/05-05-2009/0005019996&amp;EDATE=].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour===
The Cayman Islands has a small population and therefore a limited work force. [[Work permit]]s may therefore be granted to foreigners. On average, there have been more than 21,000 foreigners holding valid Work Permits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eso.ky/pages.php?page=immigrationdata  Work Permit Stats]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Work permits for non-citizens====
In order to work in the Cayman Islands as a [[Alien (law)|non-citizen]], a work permit is required. This involves passing a police background check and a health check. A prospective immigrant worker will not be granted a permit if certain medical conditions are present which include testing positive for [[syphilis]] or [[HIV]]. A permit may be granted to individuals on special work.

A foreigner must first have a job in order to move to the Cayman Islands. The employer applies and pays for the work permit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.ky/portal/page?_pageid=1142,1592726&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL  C.I. Government Website - Entry  Requirements for Work Permits]&lt;/ref&gt; Work permits are not granted to foreigners who are in the Cayman Islands (unless it is a renewal). The Cayman Islands Immigration Department requires foreigners to remain out of the country until their work permit has been approved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.island-search.com/browse.php?cat=1748  Online Employment Resources]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cayman Islands presently imposes a controversial &quot;rollover&quot; in relation to [[expatriate]] workers who require a work permit. Non-Caymanians are only permitted to reside and work within the territory for a maximum of seven years unless they satisfy the criteria of key employees. Non-Caymanians who are 'rolled over' may return to work additional 7 year periods subject to a 1 year gap between their periods of work.  The policy has been the subject of some controversy within the press. Law firms have been particularly upset by the recruitment difficulties that it has caused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caymannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000106/010674.htm  Row brews over rollover], 22 January 2007 , Cayman net  News&lt;/ref&gt; Other less well remunerated employment sectors have been affected as well. Concerns about safety have been expressed by diving instructors and realtors have also expressed concerns. Others support the rollover as necessary to protect Caymanian identity in the face of large immigration of expatriate workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caycompass.com/cgi-bin/CFPnews.cgi?ID=1011499  Government takes up permit issue], Editorial, 5 March 2006, Camanian  Compass&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have been expressed that in the long term, the policy may damage the preeminence of the Cayman Islands as an [[offshore financial centre]] by making it difficult to recruit and retain experienced staff from onshore financial centres. Government employees are no longer exempt from this &quot;rollover&quot; policy according to this report in a local newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url  = http://www.caycompass.com/cgi-bin/CFPnews.cgi?ID=1024210  |title = Cayman Islands - Cay Compass News Online - Rollover for civil servants |accessdate  = 2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governor has decided to use his constitutional powers, which give him absolute control for the disposition of [[civil service]] employees to determine which expatriate civil servants are dismissed after seven years service and which are not.

This policy is enshrined in the Immigration Law (2003 revision), written by the United Democratic Party government, and subsequently enforced by the People's Progressive Movement Party government. Both governments agree to the term limits on foreign workers, and the majority of Caymanians also agree it is necessary to protect local culture and heritage from being eroded by a large number of foreigners gaining residency and citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url  = http://www.caymanobserver.com/viewarticle.cfm?id=36&amp;Section=LocalNews  |title = Cayman Observer |accessdate = 2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
{{Main|Politics of the Cayman Islands}}
{{citation}}
[[File:Cayman islands legislative assembly.JPG|thumb|150px|right|The Legislative Assembly building in [[George Town, Cayman Islands|George Town]]]]
The Cayman Islands are a British overseas territory, listed by the UN Special Committee of 24 as one of the last [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|non-self governing territories]]. A 15-seat [[Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands|Legislative Assembly]] is elected by the people every four years to handle domestic affairs. Of the elected Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), five are chosen to serve as government ministers in a Cabinet headed by the Governor. The head of government is the [[Premier]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

A [[Governor of the Cayman Islands|Governor]] is appointed by the [[British Government]] to represent the monarch. Governors can exercise complete executive authority if they wish through blanket powers reserved to them in the constitution. They must give [[Royal Assent]] to all legislation, which allows them the power to strike down any law the legislature may see fit for the country. In modern times, the Governor usually allows the country to be run by the Cabinet, and the civil service to be run by the Deputy Governor, who is the Acting Governor when the Governor is not able to discharge his usual duties for one reason or another. The current Governor of the Cayman Islands is [[Duncan Taylor (FCO)|Duncan Taylor]] and the current Deputy Governor is The Honourable Donovan Ebanks.

The Cabinet is composed of two official members and five elected members, called ministers; one of whom is designated [[Leader of Government Business|Premier]].

The official members are the [[Deputy Governor]] and the [[Attorney General]]. They are appointed by the governor in accordance with Her Majesty's instructions, and although they have seats in the Legislative Assembly, under the 2009 Constitution, they do not vote.

The five ministers are voted into office by the 15 elected members of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands]]. One of the ministers, the leader of the majority political party, is appointed premier by the governor.

After consulting the premier, the governor allocates a portfolio of responsibilities to each Cabinet member. Under the principle of collective responsibility, all ministers are obliged to support in the Assembly any measures approved by Cabinet.

Almost 80 departments, sections and units carry out the business of government, joined by a number of statutory boards and authorities set up for specific purposes, such as the Port Authority, the Civil Aviation Authority, the Immigration Board, the Water Authority, the University College Board of Governors, the National Pensions Board, and the Health Insurance Commission.

The defence of the Cayman Islands is the responsibility of the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[Royal Cayman Islands Police Service]] provides [[police]] services in the country. The [[Cayman Islands Cadet Corps]] was formed in March 2001.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Since 2000, there have been two official major political parties: [[United Democratic Party (Cayman Islands)|United Democratic Party]] (UDP) and the [[People's Progressive Movement (Cayman Islands)|People's Progressive Movement]] (PPM). While there has been a shift to political parties, many contending for an office still run as independents.

===Taxation===
There is no direct taxation imposed on residents and Cayman Islands companies. The government receives the majority of its income from indirect taxation. Duty at is levied against most imported goods, which is typically in the range of 22% to 25%. Some items are exempted like baby formula, books, cameras and certain items at a reduced rate of 5%. Duty on automobiles depends the value can be 29.5% $20,000.00 KYD CIF up to 42% over $30,000.00 KYD CIF for expensive models. Financial institutions that operate in the islands are charged flat licensing fees by the government, in addition to work permit fees on foreign labour. A 10% government tax is placed on all tourist accommodations in addition to US$25.00 departure tax each tourist pays upon leaving the island.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caymanislands.ky/vacation_essentials/entry_requirements.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of the Cayman Islands}}
Foreign policy is controlled by the [[United Kingdom]], as the islands remain an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. Although in its early days, the Cayman Islands' most important relationships were with Britain and [[Jamaica]], in recent years, as a result of economic dependence, a relationship with the [[United States]] has developed.

Though the Cayman Islands are involved in no major international disputes, they have come under some criticism due to the use of their territory for narcotics trafficking and [[money laundering]]. In an attempt to address this, the government entered into the Narcotics Agreement of 1984 and the [[Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty]] of 1986 with the United States, in order to reduce the use of their facilities associated with these activities. In more recent years, they have stepped up the fight against money laundering, by limiting banking secrecy, introducing requirements for customer identification and record keeping, and requiring banks to cooperate with foreign investigators.

Due to their status as an overseas territory of the UK, the Cayman Islands have no representation either in the [[United Nations]] or in most other international organizations. However, the Cayman Islands still participates in some international organizations, being an associate member of [[Caricom]] and [[UNESCO]], and a member of a sub-bureau of [[Interpol]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The '''[[Cayman Islands]]''' are a [[Caribbean]] [[British overseas territory]] that have been under various governments since their discovery by Europeans.  [[Christopher Columbus]] sighted the Cayman Islands on May 10, 1503 and named them ''Las Tortugas'' after the numerous [[sea turtle]]s seen swimming in the surrounding waters. Columbus had found the two small islands ([[Cayman Brac]] and [[Little Cayman]]) and it was these two islands that he named &quot;Las Tortugas&quot;.

The 1523 &quot;Turin map&quot; of the islands was the first to refer to them as ''Los Lagartos'', meaning alligators or large lizards,&lt;ref&gt;Roger C. Smith, ''The maritime heritage of the Cayman Islands'', 2000‎ p.26&lt;/ref&gt; By 1530 they were known as the Caymanes after the [[Carib language|Carib]] word ''caimán'' for the marine crocodile, either the American or the Cuban crocodile, ''[[Crocodylus acutus]]'' or ''[[Cuban Crocodile|C. rhombifer]]'', which also lived there. Recent sub-fossil findings suggest that ''C. rhombifer'', a freshwater species, were prevalent until the 20th century.

==Settlement==
The first recorded English visitor was [[Sir Francis Drake]] in 1586, who reported that the ''caymanas'' were edible, but it was the turtles which attracted ships in search of fresh meat for their crews. Overfishing nearly extinguished the turtles from the local waters.

The first recorded permanent inhabitant of the Cayman Islands, Isaac Bodden, was born on [[Grand Cayman]] around 1700. He was the grandson of the original settler named Bodden who was likely one of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s soldiers at the taking of [[Jamaica]] in 1655.

A variety of people settled on the islands: [[pirate]]s, refugees from the [[Spanish Inquisition]], shipwrecked sailors, and [[Slavery|slave]]s. The majority of Caymanians are of [[Africa]]n and [[English People|English]] descent, with considerable interracial mixing.

==British Control==
[[Kingdom of England|England]] took formal control of the Caymans, along with Jamaica, under the [[Treaty of Madrid (1670)|Treaty of Madrid]] in 1670 after the first settlers came from Jamaica in 1661-71 to Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. These first settlements were abandoned after attacks by Spanish privateers, but English privateers often used the Cayman Islands as a base and in the 18th century they became an increasingly popular hideout for pirates, even after the end of legitimate privateering in 1713. Following several unsuccessful attempts, permanent settlement of the islands began in the 1730s. The Cayman Islands historically have been popular as a [[tax haven]]. In November 1794, ten vessels, which were part of a convoy escorted by HMS Convert, were wrecked on the reef in Gun Bay, on the East end of Grand Cayman, but with the help of local settlers, there was no loss of life. The incident is now remembered as The Wreck of the Ten Sail. Legend has it that there was a member of the [[British Royal Family]] onboard and that in gratitude for their bravery, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] decreed that Caymanians should never be conscripted for war service and Parliament legislated that they should never be taxed. However, no [[real evidence]] has been found for this.

From 1670, the Cayman Islands were effective dependencies of Jamaica, although there was considerable self-government. In 1831, a [[Legislative Assembly|legislative assembly]] was established by local consent at a meeting of principal inhabitants held at Pedro Castle on December 5. Elections were held on December 10 and the fledgling legislature passed its first [[Special legislation|local legislation]] on December 31, 1831. Subsequently The Governor of Jamaica ratified a legislature consisting of eight magistrates appointed by the Governor of Jamaica and 10 (later increased to 27) elected representatives.  

In 1835, Governor Sligo arrived in Cayman from Jamaica to declare all slaves free in accordance with the Emancipation Act of 1833.

==Dependency of Jamaica==
The Cayman Islands were officially declared and administered as a dependency of Jamaica from 1863, but were rather like a [[parish]] of Jamaica with the nominated [[Justice of the Peace|justices of the peace]] and elected vestrymen in their Legislature. From 1750 to 1898 the Chief Magistrate was the administrating official for the dependency, appointed by the Jamaican governor. In 1898 the Governor of Jamaica began appointing a Commissioner for the Islands. The first Commissioner was Frederick Sanguinetti. In 1959, upon the formation of the [[Federation of the West Indies]] the dependency status with regards to Jamaica ceased officially although the Governor of Jamaica remained the Governor of the Cayman Islands and had [[reserve power]]s over the Islands. Starting in 1959 the chief official overseeing the day to day affairs of the islands (for the Governor) was the Administrator. Upon Jamaica's independence in 1962, the Cayman Islands broke its administrative links with Jamaica and opted to become a direct dependency of the [[British monarchy|British Crown]], with the chief official of the islands being the Administrator.

In 1953 the first airfield in the Cayman Islands was opened as well as the George Town [[Public hospital]]. Barclays ushered in the age of formalised commerce by opening the first commercial bank.

==Governmental Changes==
Following a two year campaign by women to change their circumstances, in 1959 Cayman received its first written constitution which, for the first time, allowed women to vote. Cayman ceased to be a dependency of Jamaica.

During 1966, legislation was passed to enable and encourage the banking industry in Cayman.

In 1971 the governmental structure of the Islands was again changed with a Governor now running the Cayman Islands. Athel Long CMG, CBE was the last Administrator and the first [[Governor of the Cayman Islands]].

In 1991 a review of the 1972 constitution recommended several constitutional changes to be debated by the Legislative Assembly. The post of [[Chief Secretary]] was reinstated in 1992 after having been abolished in 1986. The establishment of the post of [[Chief Minister]] was also proposed. However, in November 1992 elections were held for an enlarged Legislative Assembly and the Government was soundly defeated, casting doubt on constitutional reform.  The &quot;National Team&quot; of government critics won 12 (later reduced to 11) of the 15 seats, and independents won the other three, after a campaign opposing the appointment of 
Chief Minister and advocating spending cuts. The unofficial leader of the team, Thomas Jefferson, had been the appointed [[Financial secretary|Financial Secretary]] until March 1992, when he resigned over [[Public finance|public spending]] disputes to fight the election. After the elections, Mr. Jefferson was appointed Minister and [[Leader of Government Business|leader of government business]]; he also held the portfolios of Tourism, Aviation and Commerce in the Executive Council. Three teams with a total of 44 candidates contested the [[general election]] held on November 20, 1996: the governing National Team, Team Cayman and the Democratic Alliance Group. The National Team were returned to office but with a reduced majority, winning 9 seats. The Democratic Alliance won 2 seats in George Town, Team Cayman won one in Bodden Town and independents won seats in George Town, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman.

Although all administrative links with Jamaica were broken in 1962, the Cayman Islands and Jamaica continue to share many links and experiences, including membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] (and Commonwealth citizenship) and a common [[united church]] (the [[United Church in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands]]) and [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] [[diocese]] (although there is debate about this) as well as a [[Jamaican dollar|common currency]] (until 1972). Also, by 1999, 38-40% of the population of the Cayman Islands was of Jamaican origin and in 2004/2005 little over 50% of the [[expatriates]] [[work permit|working]] in the Cayman Islands (i.e. 8,000) were Jamaicans (with the next largest expatriate communities coming from the United States, United Kingdom and Canada).

==Hurricane Ivan==
In September 2004, The Cayman Islands were hit by [[Hurricane Ivan]], causing mass devastation, loss of human and [[Fauna|animal life]] (both wild and domestic/livestock) and flooding, with some accounts reporting that 25% or more of Grand Cayman had been underwater and with the lower floors of buildings being completely flooded. This [[natural disaster]] also led to the bankruptcy of a heavily invested [[Insurance|insurance company]] called Doyle. The company had re-leased estimates covering 20% damage to be re-insured at minimal fees when in fact the damage was over 65% and every claim was in the millions. The company simply could not keep paying out and the adjusters could not help lower the payments due to the high [[building code]] the Islands adhere to.

Much suspense was built around the devastation that Hurricane Ivan had caused as the leader of Government business Mr. [[McKeeva Bush|Mckeeva Bush]] decided to close the Islands to any and all reporters. This led to severe reports in the media of hundreds dead, when in fact none but two that refused to stay in the shelters were lost. It was also a collective decision within the government at that time to turn away two [[Royal Navy surface fleet|British warships]] that had arrived the day after the storm with supplies. This decision was met by outrage from the Islanders who thought that it should have been their decision to make. However, when the Island re-opened in early December to tourists the cruise ships once more started to pour in, all intrigued to see the damage. 

While there were visible signs of damage, in the vegetation and an apparent lack of construction in some places, the Island was bustling again as some things had been freshly re-built and those that were not were quite on their way. There remain housing issues for many of the residents as of late 2005.

The '''[[Cayman Islands]]''' are a [[British overseas territories|British dependency]] and [[island country]]. It is a three-island [[archipelago]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], consisting of [[Grand Cayman]], [[Cayman Brac]], and [[Little Cayman]]. The Cayman Islands are {{convert|130|nmi|km mi|0|lk=in}} south of [[Cuba]] and {{convert|145|nmi|km mi|0|}} northwest of [[Jamaica]], and are between Cuba and [[Central America]]. Its [[geographic coordinate]]s are 19°30 north, 80°30 west.

The Cayman Islands have a land area of {{convert|101.2|sqmi|km²}}, about 1.5 times the size of [[Washington, D.C.]] and {{convert|1.2|sqmi|km²}} larger than [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]]. The Cayman Islands have a [[coastline]] of {{convert|99|mi|km|0}}. The Cayman Islands make a maritime claim of a {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|adj=on}} [[Exclusive economic zone|exclusive fishing zone]] and a [[Territorial waters|territorial sea]] of {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1}}.

The Cayman Islands' lowest [[elevation]] is the Caribbean Sea at [[sea level]].  The highest point is [[The Bluff]], a limestone outcrop {{convert|155|ft|m|0}} in height on the eastern end of eastern Cayman Brac, which itself was named for The Bluff&amp;mdash;&quot;brac&quot; is [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] for &quot;bluff.&quot;

The [[Cayman Trough]] is the deepest point in the [[Caribbean Sea]] and forms part of the tectonic boundary between the [[North American Plate]] and the [[Caribbean Plate]].

== Climate ==
The Cayman Islands have a [[tropical marine climate]], with a [[wet season]] of warm, rainy summers (May to October) and a [[dry season]] of relatively cool winters (November to April). Terrain is mostly a low-lying [[limestone]] base surrounded by [[coral reef]]s.

A major [[natural hazard]] is the [[tropical cyclone]]s that form during the [[Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic hurricane season]] from July to November.

An important environmental issue is the lack of [[fresh water]] resources. [[Drinking water]] supplies must be met by [[rainwater]] catchment and [[desalination]].

[[Natural resource]]s include [[fish]] and a climate and beaches that foster [[tourism]], which is the islands' major industry. A 2005 estimate of land use determined that the Cayman Islands' had 3.85 percent [[arable land]] and no permanent crops.

== Districts ==
The territory is subdivided into seven districts that are governed by district managers and that have a role as electoral districts and as regional units for statistics. Five of the districts are located on the main island Grand Cayman, and the remaining two correspond to the islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac:

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of the [[Cayman Islands]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

The population of the '''Cayman Islands''' reflects its status as a [[British overseas territory]], its history as a former dependency of [[Jamaica]], and its present financial partnerships with the [[United States]] and other countries. The vast majority of its 45,436 residents live on the island of [[Grand Cayman]]. According to the [[Cayman Islands]] Chamber of Commerce, in 1999 an estimated 1,300 people lived on [[Cayman Brac]], while only 115 resided on [[Little Cayman]].

Although many [[Caribbean]] islands were initially populated by [[Amerindian]] groups such as the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]]s, [[Taino]]s, and [[Carib people|Carib]]s, no evidence of this has been found in the Cayman Islands. Therefore, native Caymanians do not have any Amerindian heritage from their own islands; however, a significant number of Jamaicans have settled in the Cayman Islands over the years, so they and their descendants may have some Amerindian blood via Jamaica. [[Slavery]] was less common on the Cayman Islands than in many other parts of the Caribbean, resulting in a more even division of [[Africa]]n and [[Europe]]an ancestry. Those of mixed race make up 40% of the population, with blacks and whites following at 20% each. The remaining 20% belong to various immigrant ethnic groups.

With its success in the tourism and financial service industries, the Cayman Islands have attracted many international businesses and citizens to relocate. The largest numbers of expatriates living in the Cayman Islands (as of the government's 1999 Census Report) hail from Jamaica (8,320), the [[United Kingdom]] (2,392), the United States (2,040), [[Canada]] (1,562), and [[Honduras]] (873). Approximately 3,300 more residents are citizens of various other countries. While the government doesn't restrict foreign land ownership, it does strongly enforce its immigration laws. Businesses are required to grant access to job openings to Caymanian citizens first; if none of them are suitable, the business may then seek employees from other countries. In order to work in the Cayman Islands, foreigners must have a job offer before immigrating.

To encourage [[literacy]], the Cayman Islands government requires all legal resident children between the ages of four and 16 years old to attend school. Education for Caymanians is free, with both public and private schools available. Based on the English school system, primary schools teach children from four to 11 years, while high schools handle 11 to 16 year-olds. The government also provides facilities for [[special education]], training for the [[disabled]], and an education center for [[juvenile offender]]s. In addition, [[higher education]] may be pursued at The University College and The Law School. Consequently, literacy rates are high, estimated at 98% in 1995 by [[UNESCO]] and 90% by the Cayman Islands government.

The predominant religion on the Cayman Islands is [[Christianity]]. Denominations practiced include [[United Church]], [[Church of God]]{{dn}}, [[Anglican Church]], [[Baptist Church]], [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], and [[Pentecostal Church]]. Many citizens are deeply religious, regularly going to church. Ports are closed on Sundays and Christian holidays. There are also places of worship in George Town for [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and followers of [[Bahá'í Faith]]. The Cayman Islands also hosts a small [[Jewish]] community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coloring-pages.tv/bible-coloring-pages/dove-of-peace.gif Jewish Community of the caymkan Islands]&lt;/ref&gt;

The official language of the Cayman Islands is English. Islanders' accents retain elements passed down from English, Scottish, and Welsh settlers. Caymanians of Jamaican origin speak in their own vernacular (see [[Jamaican Creole]] and [[Jamaican English]]).

{{Politics of the Cayman Islands}}
'''Politics of the Cayman Islands''' takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[overseas territory]], whereby the [[Premier]] is the [[head of government]], and of a  [[two-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the Legislative Assembly. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

The [[Cayman Islands]]' physical isolation under early British colonial rule allowed the development of an indigenous set of administrative and legal traditions which were codified into a constitution in 1959.  A new modern constitution, which devolved some authority from the United Kingdom to the Cayman Islands government, was passed by referendum on 20 May 2009.  Subsequently, the islands are now largely self-governing.

The Cayman Islands' political system is very stable, bolstered by a tradition of restrained civil governance with the [[United Kingdom]]. Public discussion revolves around public sector expenditure and social services, the pace of additional economic development, and the status of the large foreign national community on the islands.

==Constitutional Modernisation==
Constitutional Modernisation has come to the forefront of politics recently with the collapse of the now defunct [[Euro Bank Corporation]] in 2003. The prosecution in the trial was forced to reveal that the British Government had planted moles (and used wire taps) throughout the banking industry using [[MI6]], at the consent of the Governor. This caused the trial's collapse, and subsequent release of those charged with wrongdoing. Along with this, the only mole that was known at the time was allowed to leave the country, never to answer for what he (or the United Kingdom) was doing. This infuriated the elected members of the Legislative Assembly as they maintained that the Governor and the United Kingdom had put into question the Cayman Islands' reputation as a tightly regulated offshore jurisdiction. Some saw this as the United Kingdom meddling in the territory's affairs to benefit itself (and the EU), at the expense of the islands' economy. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Constitutional talks however went on hold following Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Subsequently in May 2005 the ruling UDP was ousted by the PPM, which restarted the process of constitutional modernisation. The new constitution took effect on the 6th November 2009.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Executive branch==

|}
The Cabinet is appointed by the Governor on advice of the Premier.
The British Crown appoints a [[Governors of the Cayman Islands|Governor]], who is recruited from the UK [[Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office]] and serves as the British representative, including his role as the direct representative of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Daily administration of the islands is conducted by the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The Deputy Governor, and Attorney General are appointed by the Governor. Responsibility for defence and foreign affairs resides with the United Kingdom; however, the Deputy Governor handles the portfolio for External Affairs, and the Cayman Islands Government may negotiate certain bilateral matters directly with foreign governments.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The Governor can exercise complete executive authority if he wishes through reserve powers reserved to him in the Constitution.  However, he must consult with the Premier prior to using such powers and must do so in the interest of the Cayman Islands (so long as it doesn't prejudice British interests).  He must give royal assent to all legislation, which allows him the power to strike down any law the legislature may see fit for the country. In modern times, the Governor usually allows the country to be run by the cabinet, and the civil service to be run by the Deputy Governor, who is the Acting Governor when the Governor is not able to discharge his usual duties for one reason or another. The current Governor of the Cayman Islands is [[Duncan Taylor (FCO)|Duncan Taylor]]  and the current Deputy Governor is Donovan Ebanks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Legislative branch==
[[Image:Cayman islands legislative assembly.JPG|thumb|right|The Legislative Assembly building in [[George Town, Cayman Islands|George Town]]]]

The unicameral [[Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands]] is presided over by an independent speaker. The '''Legislative Assembly''' has 18 elected members. Elections are held at the discretion of the Governor at least every 4 years. Members of the Legislative Assembly may introduce bills which, if passed, are then approved, returned, or disallowed by the Governor. The UK Government also reserves the right to disallow bills approved by the Governor.  The Premier is limited to two consecutive terms, after which the individual who was Premier for two terms must sit out a term before being constitutionally eligible to be Premier again.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Judicial branch==
The four-tiered judicial system is based on English common law, colonial and local statutes. The Cayman Islands Court of Appeal is the highest court on the Islands, but a final appeal may be heard by Her Majesty's [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] sitting in London.  The [[Chief Justice]] has his seat in the [[Grand Court]], below The [[Court of Appeal]].  The current Chief Justice is Hon. [[Anthony Smellie]] QC, JP.

==Administrative divisions==
Districts:
George Town, Bodden Town, West Bay, North Side, East End, Sister Islands ([[Cayman Brac]] and [[Little Cayman]])

==International organisation participation==
[[Caricom]] (associate), [[Caribbean Development Bank|CDB]], [[International Criminal Police Organisation - Interpol|Interpol]] (subbureau), [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]]

==Corrections==
From 2002 to 2005 the Government of the Cayman Islands sent some delinquent youth to [[Tranquility Bay]], a privately-operated [[World Wide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools]] facility in [[Jamaica]]. The government funded the students as they were located in the centre.&lt;ref&gt;Pioro, Basia. &quot;[http://www.caycompass.com/cgi-bin/CFPnews.cgi?ID=1014776 Controversy surrounds Tranquility Bay].&quot; ''[[Caymanian Compass]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The economy of the [[Cayman Islands]]''', a [[British overseas territory]] located in the western [[Caribbean Sea]], is mainly fueled by the [[tourism|tourism sector]] and by the [[Financial services|financial services sector]], together representing 70-80 percent of the country's [[gross domestic product]] (GDP).&lt;ref name=&quot;USDep&quot; /&gt; The Cayman Island Investment Bureau, a [[government agency]], has been established with the mandate of promoting investment and economic development in the territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investcayman.ky Cayman Islands Investment Bureau].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The emergence of what are now considered the Cayman Islands' &quot;twin pillars of economic development&quot; (tourism and [[international finance]]) started in the 1950s with the introduction of modern [[transportation]] and [[telecommunications]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USDep&quot;&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5286.htm Background Note: Cayman Islands]. Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, February 2008. US Department of State. Retrieved 11 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

From the earliest settlement of the [[Cayman Islands]], economic activity was hindered by isolation and a limited natural resource base. The harvesting of [[sea turtle]]s to resupply passing sailing ships was the first major economic activity on the islands, but local stocks were depleted by the 1790s. [[Agriculture]], while sufficient to support the small early settler population, has always been limited by the scarcity of available land. [[Fishing]], [[shipbuilding]], and [[cotton]] production boosted the [[economy]] during the early days of settlement.  In addition, settlers scavenged shipwreck remains from the surrounding coral reefs. 

The boom in the Cayman Islands' international finance industry can also be at least partly attributed to the [[British overseas territory]] having no [[direct taxation]].  A popular legend attributes the tax-free status to the heroic acts of the inhabitants during a maritime tragedy in 1794, often referred to as &quot;Wreck of the Ten Sails&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caymanchamber.ky/visitor/poi.htm#wreck Points of Interest: The Wreck of the Ten Sails]. Cayman Islands Chamber of Commerce, 2003. Retrieved 11 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The wreck involved nine British merchant vessels and their naval escort, the [[frigate]] HMS Convert, that ran aground on the reefs off [[Grand Cayman]]. Due to the rescue efforts by the Caymanians using canoes, the loss of life was limited to eight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.ky/info/eelight.html The East End Lighthouse Park]. National Trust of the Cayman Islands, 8 June 2006. Retrieved 11 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, records from the colonial era indicate that Cayman Islands, then a [[Dependent territory|dependency]] of [[Jamaica]], was not tax-exempt during the period that followed. In 1803, the inhabitants signed a petition addressed to the [[governors of Jamaica|Jamaican governor]] asking him to grant them a tax exemption from the &quot;Transient Tax on Wreck Goods&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Roger C. (2000). ''The Maritime Heritage of the Cayman Islands''. University Press of Florida. ISBN 0813017734, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International finance and tourism==
{{refimprove|section|date=September 2008}}

The Cayman Islands' tax-free status has attracted numerous banks and other companies to its shores.  

More than 40,000 companies were registered in the Cayman Islands as of 2000, including almost 600 [[bank]]s and [[trust company|trust companies]], with banking assets exceeding $500 billion. Large corporations based in the Cayman Islands such as [[Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation]] (SMIC).  The [[Cayman Islands Stock Exchange]] was opened in 1997.

[[Tourism]] is also a mainstay, accounting for about 70% of GDP and 75% of foreign currency earnings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The tourist industry is aimed at the luxury market and caters mainly to visitors from [[North America]]. Unspoiled beaches, [[duty-free]] shopping, [[scuba diving]], and deep-sea fishing draw almost a million visitors to the islands each year. Due to the well-developed tourist industry, many citizens work in service jobs in that sector.

==Standard of living==

Because the islands cannot produce enough goods to support the population, about 90% of their food and consumer goods must be imported. In addition, the islands have few natural fresh water resources. [[Desalination]] of sea water is used to solve this.
Despite those challenges, the Caymanians enjoy one of the highest outputs per capita and one of the highest standards of living in the world. The Cayman Islands produces gourmet sea salt.

Education is compulsory to the age of 16 and is free to all Caymanian children. Most schools follow the British educational system. Ten primary, one special education, a high school and a middle school ('junior high school') are operated by the government, along with three private high schools. In addition, there is a law school, a university-college and a medical school.

The '''foreign relations of the [[Cayman Islands]]''' are largely managed from the [[United Kingdom]], as the islands remain an [[British overseas territories|overseas territory]] of the UK. However, the [[Government of the Cayman Islands]] often resolves important issues with foreign governments alone, without intervention from Britain. Although in its early days, the Cayman Islands' most important relationships were with Britain and [[Jamaica]], in recent years, this has shifted, and they now rely more so on the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

Though the Cayman Islands are involved in no major international disputes, they have come under some criticism due to the use of their territory for [[narcotics trafficking]] and [[money laundering]]. In an attempt to address this, the Government entered into the Narcotics Agreement of 1984 and the [[Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty]] of 1986 with the United States, in order to reduce the use of their facilities associated with these activities. In more recent years, they have stepped up the fight against money laundering, by limiting banking secrecy, introducing requirements for customer identification and record keeping, and requiring banks to cooperate with foreign investigators.

Due to their status as an overseas territory of the UK, the Cayman Islands have no representation either on the [[United Nations]], or in most other international organizations. However, the Cayman Islands still participates in some international organisations, being a full member of the [[Central Development Bank]] and [[International Olympic Committee]], an associate member of [[Caricom]] and [[UNESCO]], and a member of a subbureau of [[Interpol]].

The '''Central African Republic''' ('''CAR''') ({{lang-fr|République centrafricaine}}, {{IPA-fr|ʁepyblik sɑ̃tʁafʁikɛn|pron}}, or ''Centrafrique'' {{IPA|[sɑ̃tʀafʀik]}}; [[Sango]] ''Ködörösêse'' ''tî Bêafrîka''), is a [[landlocked country]] in [[Central Africa]]. It borders [[Chad]] in the north, [[Sudan]] in the east, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]] in the south, and [[Cameroon]] in the west. The CAR covers a land area of about 240,000 square miles (623,000&amp;nbsp;km²), and has an estimated population of about 4.4 million as of 2008. [[Bangui]] is the [[capital city]].

Most of the CAR consists of Sudano-Guinean savannas but it also includes a [[Sahel]]o-[[East Sudanian savanna|Sudanian]] zone in the north and an [[Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic|equatorial forest zone]] in the south. Two thirds of the country lies in the basins of the [[Ubangi River]], which flows south into the [[Congo River]], while the remaining third lies in the basin of the [[Chari River]], which flows north into [[Lake Chad]].

Since most of the territory is located in the Ubangi and Shari river basins, France called the colony it carved out in this region [[Ubangi-Shari|Ubangi-Chari]], or [[Oubangui-Chari]] in French. It became a semi-autonomous territory of the [[French Community]] in 1958 and then an independent nation on 13 August 1960. For over three decades after independence, the CAR was ruled by presidents who were not chosen in multi-party democratic elections or took power by force. Local discontent with this system was eventually reinforced by international pressure, following the end of the [[Cold War]].

The first multi-party democratic elections were held in 1993 with resources provided by the country's donors and help from the UN Office for Electoral Affairs, and brought [[Ange-Félix Patassé]] to power. He lost popular support during his presidency and was [[coup d'état|overthrown]] in 2003 by French-backed General [[François Bozizé]], who went on to win a [[Central African Republic elections, 2005|democratic election]] in May 2005. Inability to pay workers in the public sector led to strikes in 2007, forcing the resignation of the government in early 2008. A new Prime Minister, [[Faustin-Archange Touadéra]], was named on 22 January 2008.

The Central African Republic is one of the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|poorest countries in the world]] and among the ten poorest countries in Africa. The [[Human Development Index]] for the Central African Republic is 0.369, which gives the country a rank of 179 out of 182 countries with data.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of countries by Human Development Index]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the Central African Republic}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}

===Early history===
Between about 1000 BC and 1000 AD, [[Adamawa-Eastern]]-speaking peoples spread eastward from Cameroon to Sudan and settled in most of the territory of the CAR. During the same period, a much smaller number of [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking immigrants settled in Southwestern CAR and some [[Central Sudanic]]-speaking populations settled along the Oubangi.

The majority of the CAR's inhabitants thus speak Adamawa-Eastern languages or Bantu languages belonging to the [[Niger-Congo]] family. A minority speak Central Sudanic languages of the [[Nilo-Saharan]] family. More recent immigrants include many Muslim merchants who most often speak [[Arabic]] or [[Hausa language|Hausa]].

===Exposure to the outside world===
Until the early 19th century, the peoples of the CAR lived beyond the expanding Islamic frontier in the Sudanic zone of Africa and thus had relatively little contact with [[Abrahamic religions]] or northern economies. During the first decades of the 19th century, however, Muslim traders began increasingly to penetrate the region of the CAR and to cultivate special relations with local leaders in order to facilitate their trade and settlement in the region.

The initial arrival of Muslim traders in the early 19th century was relatively peaceful and depended upon the support of local peoples, but after about 1850, slave traders with well-armed soldiers began to penetrate the region. Between c. 1860 and 1910, slave traders from [[Sudan]], [[Chad]], [[Cameroon]], [[Dar al-Kuti]] in Northern CAR and [[Nzakara]] and [[Azande|Zande]] states in Southeastern CAR exported much of the population of Eastern CAR, a region with very few inhabitants today.

===French colonialism===
{{Main|Ubangi-Shari}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
[[File:Oubangui-Chari.jpg|left|thumb|''Oubangui-Chari'' in 1910]]European penetration of Central African territory began in the late 19th century during the so-called [[Scramble for Africa]] (c. 1875–1900). Count [[Savorgnan de Brazza]] took the lead in establishing the [[French Congo]] with headquarters in the city named after him, [[Brazzaville]], and sent expeditions up the Ubangi River in an effort to expand France's claims to territory in Central Africa. [[King Leopold II]] of Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom also competed to establish their claims to territory in the Central African region.

In 1889 the French established a post on the Ubangi River at [[Bangui]], the future capital of [[Ubangi-Shari]] and the CAR. De Brazza then sent expeditions in 1890–91 up the [[Sangha River]] in what is now Southwestern CAR, up the center of the Ubangi basin toward [[Lake Chad]], and eastward along the Ubangi River toward the [[Nile]]. De Brazza and the procolonial in France wished to expand the borders of the French Congo to link up with French territories in West Africa, North Africa and East Africa.

In 1894, the French Congo's borders with Leopold II's [[Congo Free State]] and [[German Cameroon]] were fixed by diplomatic agreements. Then, in 1899, the French Congo's border with Sudan was fixed along the Congo-Nile watershed, leaving France without her much coveted outlet on the Nile and turning Southeastern Ubangi-Shari into a cul-de-sac.

Once European negotiators agreed upon the borders of the French Congo, France had to decide how to pay for the costly occupation, administration, and development of the territory. The reported financial successes of Leopold II's concessionary companies in the Congo Free State convinced the French government in 1899 to grant 17 private companies large concessions in the Ubangi-Shari region. In return for the right to exploit these lands by buying local products and selling European goods, the companies promised to pay rent to the colonial state and to promote the development of their concessions. The companies employed European and African agents who frequently used extremely brutal methods to force Central Africans to work for them. At the same time, the French colonial administration began to force Central Africans to pay taxes and to provide the state with free labor. The companies and French administration often collaborated in their efforts to force Central Africans to work for their benefit, but they also often found themselves at odds.

Some French officials reported abuses committed by private company militias and even by their own colonial colleagues and troops, but efforts to bring these criminals to justice almost always failed. When news of atrocities committed against Central Africans by concessionary company employees and colonial officials or troops reached France and caused an outcry, there were investigations and some feeble attempts at reform, but the [[facts on the ground|situation on the ground]] in Ubangi-Shari remained essentially the same.

[[File:Stamp Ubangi-Shari 1924 1c.jpg|left|thumb|Stamp from 1924]]In the meantime, during the first decade of French colonial rule (c. 1900–1910), the rulers of African states in the Ubangi-Shari region increased their slave raiding activities and also their sale of local products to European companies and the colonial state. They took advantage of their treaties with the French to procure more weapons which were used to capture more slaves and so much of the eastern half of Ubangi-Shari was depopulated as a result of the export of Central Africans by local rulers during the first decade of colonial rule. Those who had power, Africans and Europeans, often made life miserable for those who did not have the power to resist.

During the second decade of colonial rule (c. 1910–1920), armed employees of private companies and the colonial state continued to use brutal methods to deal with local populations who resisted forced labor but the power of local African rulers was destroyed and so slave raiding was greatly diminished. In 1911, the Sangha and Lobaye basins were ceded to Germany as part of an agreement which gave France a free-hand in Morocco and so Western Ubangi-Shari came under German rule until World War I, during which France reconquered this territory by using Central African troops.

The third decade of colonial rule (1920–1930) was a period of transition during which a network of roads was built, cash crops were promoted, mobile health services were formed to combat [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], and [[Protestant]] missions established stations in different parts of the country. New forms of forced labor were also introduced, however, as the French conscripted large numbers of Ubangians to work on the [[Congo-Ocean Railway]] and many of these recruits died of exhaustion and illness.

In 1925 the French writer [[André Gide]] published ''[[Voyage au Congo]]'' in which he described the alarming consequences of conscription for the Congo-Ocean railroad and exposed the continuing atrocities committed against Central Africans in Western Ubangi-Shari by employees of the Forestry Company of Sangha-Ubangi, for example. In 1928 a major insurrection, the [[Kongo-Wara]] 'war of the hoe handle' broke out in Western Ubangi-Shari and continued for several years. The extent of this insurrection, perhaps the largest anticolonial rebellion in Africa during the interwar years, was carefully hidden from the French public because it provided evidence, once again, of strong opposition to French colonial rule and forced labor.

During the fourth decade of colonial rule (c. 1930–1940), [[cotton]], [[tea]], and [[coffee]] emerged as important cash crops in Ubangi-Shari and the mining of [[diamond]]s and [[gold]] began in earnest. Several cotton companies were granted purchasing monopolies over large areas of cotton production and were thus able to fix the prices paid to cultivators in order to assure profits for their shareholders. Europeans established coffee plantations and Central Africans also began to cultivate coffee.

The fifth decade of colonial rule (c. 1940–1950) was shaped by the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the political reforms which followed in its wake. In September 1940 pro-Gaullist French officers took control of Ubangi-Shari.

===Independence===
On 1 December 1958 the colony of Ubangi-Shari became an autonomous territory within the [[French Community]] and took the name Central African Republic. The founding father and president of the ''Conseil de Gouvernement'', [[Barthélémy Boganda]], died in a mysterious plane accident in 1959, just eight days before the last elections of the colonial era. On 13 August 1960 the Central African Republic gained its independence and two of Boganda's closest aides, [[Abel Goumba]] and [[David Dacko]], became involved in a power struggle. With the backing of the French, Dacko took power and soon had Goumba arrested. By 1962 President Dacko had established a one-party state.
[[Image:Jean-Bédel Bokassa.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]]]]
On 31 December 1965 Dacko was overthrown in the [[Saint-Sylvestre coup d'état]] by Colonel [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], who suspended the constitution and dissolved the National Assembly. President Bokassa declared himself President for life in 1972, and named himself Emperor Bokassa I of the [[Central African Empire]] on 4 December 1976. A year later, Emperor Bokassa crowned himself in a lavish and expensive ceremony that was ridiculed by much of the world. In 1979 France carried out a coup against Bokassa and &quot;restored&quot; Dacko to power. Dacko, in turn, was overthrown in a coup by General [[André Kolingba]] on 1 September 1981.

Kolingba suspended the constitution and ruled with a military junta until 1985. He introduced a new constitution in 1986 which was adopted by a nationwide referendum. Membership in his new party, the [[Rassemblement Démocratique Centrafricain]] (RDC) was voluntary. In 1987, semi-competitive elections to parliament were held and municipal elections were held in 1988. Kolingba's two major political opponents, Abel Goumba and [[Ange-Félix Patassé]], boycotted these elections because their parties were not allowed to compete.

By 1990, inspired by the fall of the Berlin Wall, a pro-democracy movement became very active. In May 1990 a letter signed by 253 prominent citizens asked for the convocation of a National Conference but Kolingba refused this request and detained several opponents. Pressure from the United States, more reluctantly from France, and from a group of locally represented countries and agencies called GIBAFOR (France, USA, Germany, Japan, EU, World Bank and UN) finally led Kolingba to agree, in principle, to hold free elections in October 1992, with help from the UN Office of Electoral Affairs. After using the excuse of alleged irregularities to suspend the results of the elections as a pretext for holding on to power, President Kolingba came under intense pressure from GIBAFOR to establish a &quot;Conseil National Politique Provisoire de la République&quot; (Provisional National Political Council) (CNPPR) and to set up a &quot;Mixed Electoral Commission&quot; which included representatives from all political parties.

When elections were finally held in 1993 (again with the help of the international community) Ange-Félix Patassé led in the first round and Kolingba came in fourth behind Abel Goumba and David Dacko. In the second round, Patassé won 53 percent of the vote while Goumba won 45.6 percent. Most of Patassé's support came from Gbaya, Kare and Kaba voters in seven heavily populated prefectures in the northwest while Goumba's support came largely from ten less-populated prefectures in the south and east. Furthermore, Patassé's party, the ''Mouvement pour la Libération du Peuple Centrafricain'' (MLPC) or Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People gained a simple but not an absolute majority of seats in parliament, which meant Patassé needed coalition partners.

Patassé relieved former President Kolingba of his military rank of general in March 1994 and then charged several former ministers with various crimes. Patassé also removed many [[Yakoma]] from important, lucrative posts in the government. Two hundred mostly Yakoma members of the presidential guard were also dismissed or reassigned to the army. Kolingba's RDC loudly proclaimed that Patassé's government was conducting a &quot;witch hunt&quot; against the Yakoma.

A new constitution was approved on 28 December 1994 and promulgated on 14 January 1995, but this constitution, like those before it, did not have much impact on the practice of politics. In 1996–1997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in its erratic behaviour, three mutinies against Patassé's government were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension. On 25 January 1997, the Bangui Peace Accords were signed which provided for the deployment of an inter-African military mission, the ''Mission Interafricaine de Surveillance des Accords de Bangui'' (MISAB). Mali's former president, [[Amadou Toumani Touré|Amadou Touré]], served as chief mediator and brokered the entry of ex-mutineers into the government on 7 April 1997. The MISAB mission was later replaced by a U.N. peacekeeping force, the ''Mission des Nations Unies en RCA'' (MINURCA).

In 1998 parliamentary elections resulted in Kolingba' RDC winning 20 out of 109 seats, which constituted a comeback, but in 1999, notwithstanding widespread public anger in urban centers with his corrupt rule, Patassé won free elections to become president for a second term.

On 28 May 2001 rebels stormed strategic buildings in Bangui in an unsuccessful coup attempt. The army chief of staff, Abel Abrou, and General François N'Djadder Bedaya were shot, but Patassé regained the upper hand by bringing in at least 300 troops of the rebel leader [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] (from across the river in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) and by Libyan soldiers.

In the aftermath of this failed coup, militias loyal to Patassé sought revenge against rebels in many neighborhoods of the capital, Bangui, that resulted in the destruction of many homes as well as the torture and murder of many opponents. Eventually Patassé came to suspect that General [[François Bozizé]] was involved in another coup attempt against him and so Bozizé fled with loyal troops to Chad. In March 2003, Bozizé launched a surprise attack against Patassé, who was out of the country. Libyan troops and some 1,000 soldiers of Bemba's Congolese rebel organization failed to stop the rebels, who took control of the country and thus succeeded in overthrowing Patassé.

François Bozizé suspended the constitution and named a new cabinet which included most opposition parties. Abel Goumba, &quot;Mr. Clean&quot;, was named vice-president, which gave Bozizé's new government a positive image. Bozizé established a broad-based National Transition Council to draft a new constitution and announced that he would step down and run for office once the new constitution was approved. A national dialogue was held from 15 September to 27 October 2003, and Bozizé won a fair election that excluded Patassé, to be elected president on a second ballot, in May 2005.

==Humanitarian aid, peacebuilding, and development==
The Central African Republic is heavily dependent upon [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] foreign [[aid]] and the presence of numerous [[NGO]]s which provide services which the government fails to provide. As one [[UNDP]] official put it, the CAR is a country &quot;sous serum&quot;, or a country metaphorically hooked up to [[Intravenous therapy|an IV]]. (Mehler 2005:150). The very presence of numerous foreign personnel and organizations in the country, including peacekeepers and even refugee camps, provides an important source of revenue for many Central Africans.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph. A full citation is needed for Mehler 2005:150}}

The country is self-sufficient in food crops, but much of the population lives at a subsistence level. [[Livestock]] development is hindered by the presence of the [[tsetse fly]].

In 2006 due to ongoing violence, over 50,000 in the country's north-west were at risk of starvation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=58581 |title=Thousands could die of starvation, says [[United Nations]] spokesperson Maurizio Giuliano}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was only averted thanks to [[United Nations]] support.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

===Peacebuilding Commission===
On 12 June 2008, the Central African Republic became the fourth country to be placed on the agenda of the UN Peacebuilding Commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/pbc39.doc.htm |title=Peacebuilding Commission Places Central African Republic On Agenda; Ambassador Tells Body ‘Car Will Always Walk Side By Side With You, Welcome Your Advice’ |publisher=Un.org |date=2008-07-02 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was set up in 2005 to help countries emerging from conflict avoid the slide back into war or chaos.  The 31-member body agreed to take up the situation after a request from the government.

===Peacebuilding Fund===
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared on 8 January 2008 that the Central African Republic was eligible to receive assistance from the Peacebuilding Fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unpbf.org/CAR.shtml ]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three priority areas were identified: 1) Security sector reform 2) Promotion of good governance and the rule of law and 3) Revitalization of communities affected by conflicts.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of the Central African Republic|Central African Republic Council of Ministers}}
[[François Bozizé]] is President of the country. A new constitution was approved by voters in a referendum held on 5 December 2004. Full multiparty [[Central African Republic elections, 2005|presidential and parliamentary elections]] were held in March 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/87ba6e292f78b0bc6dbbaeb9c2ef6bd9.htm |title=Reuters AlertNet – CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC: Polls results to be announced on 22 May, official says |publisher=Alertnet.org |date=2005-05-11 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a second round in May.

In February 2006, there were reports of widespread violence in the northern part of the CAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4747772.stm | work=BBC News | title=Thousands flee new CAR 'rebels' | date=24 February 2006 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of refugees fled their homes, caught in the crossfire of battles between government troops and rebel forces. More than 7,000 people fled to neighboring [[Chad]]. Those who remained in the CAR told of government troops systematically killing men and boys suspected of cooperating with rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4844664.stm | work=BBC News | title=Thousands flee from CAR violence | date=25 March 2006 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, [[François Bozizé]] signed a decree declaring presidential elections on 25 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE61O0OQ20100225 |title=Central African Republic to hold April 25 elections &amp;#124; Top News &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Af.reuters.com |date=2010-02-25 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elections were first postponed to 16 May, and then indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Article/ARTJAWEB20100511115353/politique-elections-presidentielle-francois-bozizebozize-prend-ses-precautions.html |title=BozizĂŠ prend ses prĂŠcautions Afrique Subsaharienne, Politique |publisher=Jeuneafrique.com |date=2010-05-15 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally the [[Central African Republic general election, 2010|general election]] was set for 23 January 2011. Despite serious problems in the organisation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.journal-des-elections.net/elections-rca-2011/republique_centrafricaine/2010/12/existe-t-il-un-probleme-de-tresorerie-a-la-commission-electorale-independante/ | work=Journal des Elections | title=Les problèmes de gestion à la Commission Electorale Indépendante seraient-ils un frein au bon déroulement du processus électoral? | date=20 December 2010 | accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the election preceded as scheduled{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. A second round was forecast on 20 March 2011, and was conducted 27 March 2011{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. The general elections is partly funded by the international community ([[European Union|EU]] and [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]]). An association of most of the Civil Society Organisations, the &quot;Observatoire National des Elections&quot; is monitoring the election process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.journal-des-elections.net/elections-rca-2011/republique_centrafricaine/les-publications-de-lobservatoire-national-des-elections/ | work=Journal des Elections | title=Les publications de l'ONE | date=20 December 2010 | accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bozizé and his party both had major victories in the elections{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

===Human rights===
{{Main|Human rights in the Central African Republic}}

The 2009 Human Rights Report by the [[United States Department of State]] noted that in general the human rights record remained poor, with concerns over numerous government abuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009 Human Rights Report&quot;&gt;, [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/af/135944.htm 2009 U.S Dept of State Human Rights Report: Central African Republic]&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of speech is addressed in the constitution, however there have been incidents of government intimidation with the intent to limit media criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009 Human Rights Report&quot;/&gt; A report by the [[International Research &amp; Exchanges Board]]'s , media sustainability index noted that 'the country minimally met objectives, with segments of the legal system and government opposed to a free media system'&lt;ref name=&quot;2009 Human Rights Report&quot; /&gt;

==Prefectures and sub-prefectures==
[[File:CAR prefectures.png|thumb|right|Prefectures of the Central African Republic]]
{{Main|Prefectures of the Central African Republic|Sub-prefectures of the Central African Republic}}

The Central African Republic is divided into 14 administrative [[prefecture]]s (''préfectures''), along with 2 economic prefectures (''préfectures economiques'') and one autonomous [[commune (subnational entity)|commune]]. The prefectures are further divided into 71 sub-prefectures (''sous-préfectures'').

The [[prefectures of the Central African Republic|prefectures]] include:
{{div col}}
* [[Bamingui-Bangoran]]
* [[Basse-Kotto]]
* [[Haute-Kotto]]
* [[Haut-Mbomou]]
* [[Kémo]]
* [[Lobaye]]
* [[Mambéré-Kadéï]]

* [[Nana-Mambéré]]
* [[Ombella-M'Poko]]
* [[Ouaka]]
* [[Ouham]]
* [[Ouham-Pendé]]

[[File:Republique Centrafricaine - Boali - Chutes de Boali.jpg|thumb|right|Falls of Boali on the Mbali River.]]

The Central African Republic is a land-locked nation within the interior of the African continent. It is bordered by the countries of Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo. The country lies between latitudes [[2nd parallel north|2°]] and [[11th parallel north|11°N]], and longitudes [[14th meridian east|14°]] and [[28th meridian east|28°E]].

Much of the Central African Republic consists of flat, or rolling plateau [[savanna]], typically about {{convert|500|m|ft|0}} above sea level, of which most of the northern half lies within the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s [[East Sudanian savanna]] [[ecoregion]]. In the northeast are the Fertit Hills, and there are scattered hills in southwest part of the country. To the northwest is the Yade Massif, a [[granite]] plateau with an altitude of {{convert|1,143|ft|m|0}}.

At {{convert|622,941|km2|sqmi|0}}, the Central African Republic is the world's 42nd-largest country. It is comparable in size to the [[Ukraine]], and is somewhat smaller than the US state of [[Texas]].

Much of the southern border is formed by tributaries of the [[Congo River]], with the [[Mbomou River]] in the east merging with the [[Uele River]] to form the [[Ubangi River]]. In the west, the [[Sangha River]] flows through part of the country. The eastern border lies along the edge of the [[Nile river]] [[drainage basin|watershed]].

Estimates of the amount of the country covered by forest ranges up to 8%, with the densest parts in the south. The forest is highly diverse, and includes commercially important species of [[Ayous]], [[Sapele|Sapelli]] and [[Sipo (timber)|Sipo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forestsmonitor.org/en/reports/540539 Sold Down the River (English) March 2001], [[Forests Monitor]]&lt;/ref&gt; The deforestation rate is 0.4% per annum, and lumber poaching is commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carpe.umd.edu/resources/Documents/THE_FORESTS_OF_THE_CONGO_BASIN_State_of_the_Forest_2006.pdf/view  The Forests of the Congo Basin: State of the Forest 2006]. CARPE  13-July-07&lt;/ref&gt;

In the November 2008 issue of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', the Central African Republic was named the country least affected by [[light pollution]].

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of the Central African Republic}}
The climate of the C.A.R. is generally [[Tropics|tropical]]. The northern areas are subject to [[harmattan]] winds, which are hot, dry, and carry dust. The northern regions have been subject to [[desertification]], and the northeast ''is'' a desert. The remainder of the country is prone to flooding from nearby rivers.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Central African Republic}}
[[File:Lettuce watering in CAR.jpg|thumb|Lettuce watering in northern Central African Republic.]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image
[[File:Central African Republic&amp;nbsp;— Boy in Birao.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A boy playing with a burnt [[kerosene lamp]] in the city of [[Birao]], Central African Republic. The town was almost completely burnt down in March 2007 during fighting between rebels and government troops.]]
--&gt;
The economy of the CAR is dominated by the cultivation and sale of food crops such as [[cassava]], [[peanut]]s, [[maize]], [[sorghum]], [[millet]], [[sesame]], and [[plantain]] . The annual real GDP growth rate is just above 3%. The importance of foodcrops over exported [[cash crops]] is indicated by the fact that the total production of cassava, the staple food of most Central Africans, ranges between 200,000 and 300,000 [[ton]]s &lt;!-- Which ton??? --&gt; a year, while the production of [[cotton]], the principal exported cash crop, ranges from 25,000 to 45,000 tons a year. Foodcrops are not exported in large quantities but they still constitute the principal cash crops of the country because Central Africans derive far more income from the periodic sale of surplus foodcrops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or [[coffee]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph}}

The CAR's largest import partner is [[South Korea]] (20.2%), followed by France (13.6%) and [[Cameroon]] (7.7%), while its largest export partner is Japan (40.4%), followed by Belgium (9.8%) and China (8.2%).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2050.html?countryName=China&amp;countryCode=ch&amp;regionCode=eas&amp;#ch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2061.html?countryName=China&amp;countryCode=ch&amp;regionCode=eas&amp;#ch&lt;/ref&gt;

Many rural and urban women also transform foodcrops into alcoholic drinks such as sorghum beer or hard liquor and derive considerable income from the sale of these drinks. Much of the income derived from the sale of foods and alcohol is not &quot;on the books&quot; and thus is not considered in calculating per capita income, which is one reason why official figures for per capita income are not accurate in the case of the CAR.

The [[per capita income]] of the CAR is often listed as being around $300 a year, said to be one of the lowest in the world, but this figure is based mostly on reported sales of exports and largely ignores the more important but unregistered sale of foods, locally produced [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[diamond]]s, [[ivory]], [[bushmeat]], and [[traditional medicine]], for example. The [[informal economy]] of the CAR is more important than the formal economy for most Central Africans.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph}}

Diamonds constitute the most important export of the CAR, accounting for 40–55% of export revenues, but an estimated 30–50% of the diamonds produced each year leave the country clandestinely. Export trade is hindered by poor economic development, and the location of this country far from the coast.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph}}

The wilderness regions of this country have potential as [[ecotourist]] destinations. The country is noted for its population of [[forest elephant]]s. In the southwest, the [[Dzanga-Sangha National Park]] is a rain forest area. To the north, the [[Manovo-Gounda St Floris National Park]] has been well-populated with wildlife, including [[leopard]]s, [[lion]]s, and [[Rhinoceros|rhinos]]. To the northeast the [[Bamingui-Bangoran National Park]]. However the population of wildlife in these parks has severely diminished over the past 20 years due to poaching, particularly from the neighboring [[Sudan]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph}}

The CAR  is a member of the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] ([[OHADA]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ohada.com&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAR is ranked 180 out of 181 on 'ease of business' in the 2009 Doing Business Report of the World Bank Group. The 'ease of business' ranking uses a composite index on regulations that enhance business activity and those that constrain it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doingbusiness.org/Documents/CountryProfiles/CAF.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The population has almost quadrupled since independence. In 1960 the population was 1,232,000. Now the population is 4,422,000. ''(2009 UN est.) Note: estimates for this country take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality and death rates, lower population and growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected.''

The [[United Nations]] estimates that approximately 11% of the population aged 15&amp;nbsp;– 49 is [[HIV]] positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/Regions_Countries/Countries/central_african_republic.asp |title=Countries |publisher=Unaids.org |date=2008-07-29 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 3% of the country has [[antiretroviral]] therapy available, compared to 17% coverage in neighbouring countries of [[Chad]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://data.unaids.org/pub/GlobalReport/2006/2006_GR_ANN3_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The nation is divided into over 80 ethnic groups, each having its own language. The largest ethnic groups are the [[Gbaya people|Baya]] (33%), [[Banda people|Banda]] (28%), [[Mandjia]] (7%), [[Sara people|Sara]] (10%), [[Mboum]] (7%), [[M'Baka]] (4%), [[Yakoma]] (4%), and [[Fulani]] (3%), with others constituting 4%, including Europeans of mostly French descent.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">The known '''history of the Central African Republic''' dates back to the 7th century AD.

==Early history==
The [[Central African Republic]] is believed to have been settled from at least the 7th century on by overlapping empires, including the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu]], [[Ouaddai Kingdom|Ouaddai]], [[Baguirmi Kingdom|Baguirmi]], and Dafour groups based on the [[Lake Chad]] region and along [[Upper Nile, Sudan|Upper Nile]]. Later, various [[sultanate]]s claimed present-day CAR, using the entire [[Oubangui]] region as a source of [[Slavery|slave]], from which [[Islamic slave trade|slaves were traded north]] across the [[Sahara Desert]]. Population [[Migration (human)|migration]] in the 18th and 19th centuries brought new migrants into the area, including the [[Zande]], [[Banda (CAR)|Banda]], and [[Gbaya people|Baya-Mandjia]].

==French control==
In 1875 the [[Sudan]]ese sultan [[Rabih az-Zubayr]] governed Upper-Oubangui, which included present-day CAR. Europeans, primarily the French, [[Germany|German]], and [[Belgium|Belgians]], arrived in the area in 1885. The French consolidated their legal claim to the area through an 1887 convention with [[Congo Free State]], which granted France possession of the right bank of the [[Oubangui River]]. Two years later, the French established an outpost at [[Bangui]], and in 1894, [[Oubangui-Chari]] became a French territory. However, the French did not consolidate their control over the area until 1903, after having defeated the forces of Rabih in the [[battle of Kousséri]], and established colonial administration throughout the territory. In 1906, the Oubangui-Chari territory was united with the [[Chad]] colony; in 1910, it became one of the four territories of the [[Federation of French Equatorial Africa]] (AEF), along with Chad, [[Republic of the Congo|Middle Congo]], and [[Gabon]]. The next thirty years were marked by small scale revolts against French rule and the development of a [[plantation]]-style economy.

==Independence==
In August 1940, the territory responded, with the rest of the AEF, to the call from General [[Charles de Gaulle]] to fight for [[Free France]]. After World War II, the [[French Constitution]] of 1946 inaugurated the first of a series of reforms that led eventually to complete independence for all French territories in western and equatorial Africa. In 1946, all AEF inhabitants were granted French citizenship and allowed to establish local assemblies. The assembly in CAR was led by [[Barthélemy Boganda]], a Catholic priest who also was known for his forthright statements in the French Assembly on the need for African [[abolitionism|emancipation]]. In 1956 French legislation eliminated certain voting inequalities and provided for the creation of some organs of self-government in each territory. 

The French constitutional referendum of September 1958 dissolved the AEF, and on 1 December of the same year the Assembly declared the birth of the Central African Republic with Boganda as head of government. Boganda ruled until his death in a March 1959 plane crash. His cousin, [[David Dacko]], replaced him, governing the country until 1965 and overseeing the country's declaration of independence on 13 August 1960.

==Bokassa coup==
On 1 January 1966, following a swift and almost bloodless coup, Colonel [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]] assumed power as president of the Republic. Bokassa abolished the constitution of 1959, dissolved the National Assembly, and issued a decree that placed all legislative and executive powers in the hands of the president. On 4 December 1976, the republic became a monarchy—the [[Central African Empire]] -- with the promulgation of the imperial constitution and the proclamation of the president as Emperor Bokassa I. His regime was characterized by numerous human rights atrocities.

==Dacko counter-coup==
On 20 September 1979, Dacko, with French support, led a bloodless coup that overthrew Bokassa while he was out of the country. The republic was restored, and Bokassa, who took refuge in [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and France, was sentenced to death in absentia for various crimes, including [[cannibalism]]. Moreover, an African judicial commission reported that he had &quot;almost certainly&quot; taken part in the massacre of some 100 children for refusing to wear the compulsory school uniforms. In January 1981, six of his supporters, including two sons-in-law, were executed.

Bokassa made an unexpected return in October 1986 and was retried. On 12 June 1987, he was convicted of having ordered the murders of at least 20 prisoners and the arrest of the schoolchildren who were murdered. He was sentenced to death, but this was commuted to a life term in February 1988. He was released from prison on 1 September 1993, as a result of an amnesty. He died of a heart attack in [[Bangui]] on 3 November 1996 at age 75.

==Kolingba coup==
Dacko's efforts to promote economic and political reforms proved ineffectual, and on 20 September 1981, he in turn was overthrown in a bloodless coup by General [[André Kolingba]]. For four years, Kolingba led the country as head of the Military Committee for National Recovery (CRMN). 

In 1985 the CRMN was dissolved, and Kolingba named a new cabinet with increased civilian participation, signaling the start of a return to civilian rule. The process of democratization quickened in 1986 with the creation of a new political party, the Rassemblement Démocratique Centrafricain (RDC), and the drafting of a new constitution that subsequently was ratified in a national referendum. General Kolingba was sworn in as constitutional President on 29 November 1986. The constitution established a National Assembly made up of 52 elected deputies, elected in July 1987.

==Multiparty elections==
Due to mounting political pressure, in 1991 President Kolingba announced the creation of National Commission to rewrite the constitution to provide for a [[multi-party]] system. Internal and international pressure led to multi-party presidential elections being held in 1992. Much of the resources for these first democratic elections since independence came from locally represented donors and agencies called the &quot;Groupe informel des bailleurs de fonds et representants residents&quot; (GIBAFOR). Help was also received from the UN Office of Electoral Assistance. Pressure came from the US and France. The elections were held, but the government provoked logistical problems and other irregularities so they could nullify the results as a means to prolong their stay in office. 

Internal and international pressure in particular from France continued and in rescheduled elections held in October 1993, again with the help of the international community [[Ange-Félix Patassé]] won a second-round victory. 

Salary arrears, labor unrest, and unequal treatment of military officers from different ethnic groups had also been among the causes of the three mutinies against the Patassé government in 1996 and 1997. The French succeeded in helping it to quell the disturbances, and an African peacekeeping force (MISAB) occupied Bangui until 1998 when they were relieved by a United Nations peacekeeping mission ([[MINURCA]]). Economic difficulties caused by the looting and destruction during the 1996 and 1997 mutinies, energy crises, and government mismanagement continued to trouble Patassé's government through 2000. Despite several army mutinies and increasing civic concern both at his erratic style and arbitrary, corrupt method of governing he was re-elected for another 6-year term in September 1999.

In March 2000 the last of the MINURCA forces departed Bangui.

==Bozizé coup==
On 15 March 2003 rebels who controlled part of the country moved into Bangui and installed their commander, General [[François Bozizé]], as president, while President Patassé was out of the country. Bozizé has since been elected President in an election considered by observers to be fair and free.

Patasse has been found guilty of major crimes in Bangui and CAR has brought a case to the International Criminal Court against him and Jean Pierre Bemba from the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo accusing them both of multiple crimes in suppressing one of the mutinies against Patasse. Civil tranquillity has yet to be established and parts of the country remain out of government control. The UN continues to maintain a peace building mission in Bangui.

Despite these shortcomings, and his promise to step down at the end of the transition, Bozizé contested the 13 March 2005 presidential elections in which all of the leading opposition candidates were allowed to run except for Patassé. Bozizé won on the second run-off round on 8 May 2005, defeating [[Martin Ziguélé]], who ran on the ticket of the MLPC, the former ruling party. The National Elections Commission declared Bozizé the winner with 64.6 percent of the vote to 35.4 percent for Ziguélé. The election was generally considered to be fair, although the absence of Patassé cast a shadow over the legitimacy of the process.

On 8 May 2005, Bozizé gained yet a further victory when his coalition, Convergence [[Kwa Na Kwa]],, won 42 parliamentary seats in the legislative run-off vote. The MLPC came in second with 11 seats while the RDC won only eight seats. The remaining seats were won by independents or by smaller parties. In June later that year, the [[African Union]] (AU) lifted sanctions against the country, which had been applied after the 2003 coup.

In early 2006, Bozizé's government appeared stable. However, Patassé, who was living in exile in [[Togo]], could not be ruled out as a leader of a future uprising. His supporters reportedly were joining or were prepared to join rebel movements in belief that their leader was still the rightful head of state of the country. Further, members of Kolingba's [[Yakoma]] tribe in the south posed a potential threat to Bozizé's government because of their widespread boycott of the second round of the legislative elections. Members of the Yakoma dominate the army.

The [[Central African Republic]] is a landlocked nation within the interior of the [[Africa|African continent]]. It is bordered by the countries of [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], [[Sudan]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]]. Much of the country consists of flat, or rolling plateau savanna, about {{convert|1640|ft|m|0}} above sea level. In the northeast are the [[Fertit Hills]], and there are scattered hills in southwest part of the country. To the northwest is the [[Yade Massif]], a granite plateau with an altitude of {{convert|3750|ft|m|0}}.

At {{convert|240519|sqmi|km2|0}}, the Central African Republic is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|world's 43rd-largest country]] (after [[Somalia]]). It is comparable in size to [[Ukraine]], and is somewhat smaller than the [[United States|US]] [[US States|state]] of [[Texas]].

Much of the southern border is formed by tributaries of the [[Congo River]], with the [[Mbomou River]] in the east merging with the [[Uele River]] to form the [[Ubangi River]]. In the west, the [[Sangha River]] flows through part of the country. The eastern border lies along the edge of the [[Nile|Nile river watershed]].

Estimates of the amount of the country covered by forest ranges up to 8%, with the densest parts in the south. The forest is highly diverse, and includes commercially important species of Ayous, Sapelli and Sipo. The deforestation rate is 0.4% per annum, and lumber poaching is commonplace.

== Climate ==
{{Main|Climate of the Central African Republic}}&lt;!-- Please create page! --&gt;
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}
The climate of the C.A.R. is generally [[tropical]]. The northern areas are subject to [[harmattan]] winds, which are hot, dry, and carry dust. The northern regions have been subject to [[desertification]], and the northeast is desert{{Clarify|date=August 2010}}. The remainder of the country is prone to flooding from nearby rivers.

[[Image:Central African Republic-demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of Central African Republic, Data of [[FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
There are more than 80 ethnic groups in the [[Central African Republic]] (CAR), each with its own language. About 50% are [[Baya|Baya-Mandjia]], 40% [[Banda (CAR)|Banda]] (largely located in the northern and central parts of the country), and 7% are [[M'Baka]] (southwestern corner of the CAR). [[Sangho]], the language of a small group along the [[Oubangui]] River, is the national language spoken by the majority of Central Africans. Only a small part of the population has more than an elemental knowledge of French, the official language.

More than 55% of the population of the CAR lives in rural areas. The chief agricultural areas are around the [[Bossangoa]] and [[Bambari]]. [[Bangui]], [[Berberati]], [[Bangassou]], and [[Bossangoa]] are the most densely populated urban centers.

{{Politics of Central African Republic}}
'''Politics of the Central African Republic''' takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[Heads of state of the Central African Republic (and Central African Empire)|President]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], with a separate executive [[Heads of government of the Central African Republic (and Central African Empire)|Prime Minister]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and parliament. The government was deposed in 15 March 2003 by forces under the rebel leader [[François Bozizé]], who promised elections in 18 to 30 months. A new cabinet was set up in 1 April 2003. Elections were held on 13 March 2005.

The '''[[Central African Republic]]''' (CAR) is classified as one of the world's [[least developed countries]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unohrlls.org/en/ldc/related/62/ |title=UN-OHRLLS Least Developed Countries |publisher=UN Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an estimated annual [[per capita income]] of $700 (2009). 

Sparsely populated and [[Landlocked country|landlocked]], the nation is overwhelmingly [[agrarian]]. The vast bulk of the population engages in [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]] and 55% of the country's GDP arises from [[agriculture]]. Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry, remains the backbone of the economy of the Central African Republic (CAR), with more than 70% of the population living in outlying areas. The agricultural sector generates half of GDP. Principal food [[crop]]s include [[cassava]], [[peanut]]s, [[sorghum]], [[millet]], [[maize]], [[sesame]], and [[plantains]]. Principal [[cash crop]]s for [[export]] include [[cotton]], [[coffee]], and [[tobacco]]. [[Timber]] has accounted for about 16% of export earnings and the [[diamond]] industry for nearly 54%.

== Infrastructure ==
[[Image:Ubangi river near Bangui.jpg|thumb|240px|Though periodically unusable, the Ubangi River is nonetheless an important transportation route.]]Much of the country's limited [[electricity|electrical supply]] is provided by [[hydroelectric plant]]s based in [[Boali]]. Fuel supplies must be barged in via the [[Oubangui River]] or trucked overland through [[Cameroon]], resulting in frequent shortages of [[gasoline]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], and [[jet fuel]]. The C.A.R.'s [[transportation]] and [[communication]] network is limited. The country has only 429 kilometers of paved road, limited international, and no domestic [[Civil aviation|air service]], and does not possess a [[railroad]]. River traffic on the [[Oubangui River]] is impossible from April to July, and conflict in the region has sometimes prevented shipments from moving between [[Kinshasa]] and [[Bangui]]. The [[telephone]] system functions, albeit imperfectly. Four [[radio station]]s currently operate in the C.A.R., as well as one [[television station]]. Numerous [[newspaper]]s and pamphlets are published on a regular basis, and one company has begun providing [[Internet service provider|Internet service]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph.}}

== Agriculture ==
74 percent of the population in the [[Central African Republic]] works in the [[agriculture industry]], so [[Central African Republic]]'s economy is dominated by the cultivation and sale of foodcrops such as [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[cassava]], [[peanut]]s, [[maize]], [[sorghum]], [[millet]], [[sesame]], and [[plantain]]s. The importance of foodcrops over exported [[cash crops]] is illustrated by the fact that the total production of cassava, the staple food of most Central Africans, ranges between c. 200,000 and 300,000 tons a year, while the production of [[cotton]], the principal exported cash crop, ranges from c. 25,000 to 45,000 tons a year. Foodcrops are not exported in large quantities but they still constitute the principal cash crops of the country because Central Africans derive far more income from the periodic sale of surplus foodcrops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or [[coffee]]. Many rural and urban women also transform some foodcrops into [[alcoholic drinks]] such as [[sorghum beer]] or [[hard liquor]] and derive considerable income from the sale of these drinks. Much of the income derived from the sale of foods and alcohol is not &quot;on the books&quot; and thus is not considered in calculating [[per capita income]], which is one reason why official figures for per capita income are not accurate in the case of the CAR. The per capita income of the CAR is often listed as being around $300 a year, said to be one of the lowest in the world, but this figure is based mostly on reported sales of [[export]]s and largely ignores the more important but unregistered sale of foods, locally-produced alcohol, [[diamonds]], [[ivory]], [[bushmeat]], and [[traditional medicine]]s, for example. The [[informal economy]] of the CAR is more important than the formal economy for most Central Africans.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph.}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Finance and Banking==
The financial sector of the CAR, the smallest in the CEMAC, plays a limited role in supporting economic growth. Suffering from weak market infrastructure and legal and judicial frameworks, the financial system remains small, undeveloped, and dominated by commercial banks. Because of economic and security concerns, financial institutions, and particularly microfinance institutions (MFIs), have consolidated their business in the capital, Bangui, over the past few years. With less than 1 percent of the total population holding a bank account, access to financial services is extremely limited in the CAR. Microfinance accounts only for 1 percent of the total credit facilities, serving 0.5 percent of the population. Low levels of mobile penetration – which stand at 30 percent, a significantly lower percentage than in the rest of the continent – dampen the potential expansion of access to financial services through mobile technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfw4a.org/central-african-republic/car-financial-sector-profile.html MFW4A]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fishing ==

Fishing is carried on extensively along the rivers, but most of the catch is sold or bartered on the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) side of the [[Ubangi River]]. In 1950,
the government began a fish-farming program, and by the end of 1968 there were almost 12,000 ponds. The 2003 fish catch was about 15,000 tons.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph.}}

== Forestry ==
[[Image:Central African Republic - Log transport.jpg|thumb|240px|The country has rich but largely unexploited natural resources; meanwhile, forestry remains an important contributor to the C. A. R. economy.]]

There are 22.9 million hectares (56.5 million acres) of forest (37 percent of the total land area), but only 3.4 million hectares (8.4 million acres) of dense forest, all in the south in the regions bordering the DRC. The CAR’s exploitable forests cover 27 million hectares (68 million acres), or 43% of the total land area. Transportation bottlenecks on rivers and lack of rail connections are serious hindrances to commercial exploitation. Most timber is shipped down the Ubangi and Zaire rivers and then on the Congo railway to the Atlantic. More than a dozen types of trees are felled, but 95 percent of the total is composed of [[obeche]], [[sapele]], [[ebony]], and [[sipo]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph.}}

A dozen sawmills produced 516,000 cu m (18 million cu ft ) of sawn logs and veneer logs in 2003. The government is encouraging production of plywood and veneer. Roundwood removals were estimated at 2.8 million cu m (99.7 million cu ft ) in 2003. Competition from lower-cost Asian and Latin American loggers has hurt the local industry, which is encumbered with high transportation and labor costs. In 2003, the country exported $89.8 million of forest products.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph.}}

== Natural resources ==

The country has rich but largely unexploited natural resources in the form of [[diamond]]s, [[gold]], [[uranium]], and other [[mineral]]s. Diamonds constitute the most important export of the CAR, frequently accounting for 40-55% of export [[revenue]]s, but an estimated 30-50% of the diamonds produced each year leave the country clandestinely. There may be [[petroleum]] deposits along the country's northern border with [[Chad]]. Diamonds are the only of these mineral resources currently being developed; reported sales of largely uncut diamonds make up close to 60% of the CAR's export earnings. Industry contributes less than 20% of the country's GDP, with artesian diamond mining, [[breweries]], and [[sawmill]]s making up the bulk of the sector. Services currently account for 25% of GDP, largely because of the oversized government [[bureaucracy]] and high [[transportation]] costs arising from the country's landlocked position.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph.}}

== Economic aid and development ==

The CAR is heavily dependent upon multilateral foreign aid and the presence of numerous [[NGO]]'s which provide numerous services which the government fails to provide. As one [[UNDP]] official put it, the CAR is a country &quot;sous serum,&quot; or a country hooked up to an [[IV]]. (Mehler 2005:150) The very presence of numerous foreign personnel and organizations in the country, including peacekeepers and even [[refugee camp]]s, provides an important source of revenue for many Central Africans.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph. A full citation is needed for Mehler 2005:150}}

[[Image:Bricklayer.jpg|thumb|240px|left|A bricklayer in Paoua, Central African Republic.]]In the 40 years since independence, the C.A.R. has made slow progress toward economic development. Economic mismanagement, poor [[infrastructure]], a limited [[tax base]], scarce private investment, and adverse external conditions have led to deficits in both its [[budget]] and external [[trade]]. Its debt burden is considerable, and the country has seen a decline in per capita [[GNP]] over the last 40 years. Important constraints to economic development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy of misdirected [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] policies. The 50% [[devaluation]] of the currencies of 14 Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had mixed effects on the CAR's economy. Diamond, timber, coffee, and cotton exports increased, leading an estimated rise of GDP of 70% in 1994 and nearly 50% in 1995. Military rebellions and social unrest in 1996 were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and a drop in GDP of 2%. Ongoing violence between the government and rebel military groups over pay issues, living conditions, and political representation has destroyed many businesses in the capital and reduced tax revenues for the government.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph.}}

The [[IMF]] approved an Extended Structure Adjustment Facility in 1998. The government has set targets of annual 5% growth and 25% inflation for 2000-2001. Structural adjustment programs with the [[World Bank]] and IMF and interest-free credits to support investments in the [[agriculture]], [[livestock]], and transportation sectors have had limited impact. The World Bank and IMF are now encouraging the government to concentrate exclusively on implementing much-needed economic reforms to jump-start the economy and defining its fundamental priorities with the aim of alleviating poverty. As a result, many of the state-owned business entities have been privatized and limited efforts have been made to standardize and simplify labor and investment codes and to address problems of corruption. The Central African Government is currently in the process of adopting new labor and investment codes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph.}}

== Postal System==
[[Direction des services postaux de l’Office National des Postes et de l'Épargne]] is responsible for the postal service.

==Telephone Network==
*''The national network for fixed phones'' consists of some [[Panaftel]] [[microwave]] radio relay links (from Bangui to Bossembele, Baoro, Carnot, Berberati and on to Gamboula on the border with Cameroon). This microwave network has however never been used, since the equipment requires electricity for the repeaters that are located every {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}}. The current fixed-lines outside [[Bangui]] are transmitted through a DOMSAT network installed in the early 1990s as a star formation around the Bangui satellite earth station (1 [[Intelsat]]). There are about 90000 fixed-lines subscribers (2003).
* ''GSM coverage'' was for a long time limited to the capital area. But in June 2006 coverage was expanded at least to Berberati in the western part of the country. There are currently two GSM-900 mobile operators, Telecel CAR and Nationlink Telecom RCA. A third network, Centrafrique Telecom Plus closed down in late 2005 after failing to attract more than 5,000 subscribers and after failing to renew its license, in accordance to the new Bozize government.
* [[Socatel]] is the country's leading [[telecommunications]] and [[internet service provider]].

== Railways ==
There are no railways in the Central African Republic.

A line from {{flagicon|Cameroon}} [[Cameroon]] port of [[Kribi]] to [[Bangui]] was proposed in 2002. &lt;ref&gt;[[Janes World Railways]], 2002-2003, p76 &lt;/ref&gt;

== Highways ==
In 2002, the country had 23,810 km (14,796 mi) of roads, of which only 429 km (267 mi) were paved. A rehabilitation project, begun in 1974 and completed ten years later, centered on three highways running north, west, and south from [[Nola, Central African Republic|Nola]]. In 2003, there were about 1,850 passenger cars and 1,650 commercial vehicles in use.

* Total: 23,810 km
* Paved: 643 km
* Unpaved: 23,167 km (1999 est.)

Major roads include:
* RN1 (Route Nationale 1) north from Bangui. 482 km via Bossangoa to Moundou, Chad.
* RN2 east from Bangui. 1202 km via Bambari and Bangassou to the Sudanese border at Bambouti.
* RN3 west from RN1 at Bossembélé. 453 km via Bouar and Baboua to Boulai on the Cameroon border as part of the east-west Trans-African Highway 8 Lagos-Mombassa. 
* RN4 from RN2 at Damara, 76 km north of Bangui, north 554 km via Bouca and Batangafo to Sarh, Chad.
* RN6 south and west from Bangui, 605 km via Mbaïki, Carnot and Berbérati to Gamboula on the border with Cameroon. 
* RN8 north-east from RN2 at Sibut, 023 km via Kaga Bandoro, Ndéle, and Birao to the Sudanese border.
* RN10 south from RN6 at Berbérati, 136 km via Bania to Nola. 
* RN11 from Baoro on RN3 south, 104 km to Carnot on RN6.

The roads west to Sudan and north to Chad are poorly maintained.

&lt;ref&gt;Africa North and West, Micheleon 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

== Waterways ==
900 km; traditional trade carried on by means of shallow-draft dugouts; [[Oubangui]] is the most important river, navigable all year to craft drawing 0.6 m or less; 282 km navigable to craft drawing as much as 1.8 m.

== Ports and harbors ==
[[Bangui]], [[Nola]], [[Salo]], [[Nzinga (CAR)|Nzinga]]

== Airports ==
In 2004, there were an estimated 50 airports. However, only three had paved runways, as of 2005. There is an international airport at [[Bangui M'Poko International Airport|Bangui-Mpoko]]. Five airlines provide international transport. The Republic was also a partner in [[Air Afrique]], before it ceased operations in 2002. [[Inter-RCA]] provides domestic service. In 2003, about 46,000 passengers were carried on domestic and international flights.

=== Airports with paved runways ===
* Total: 3
* 2,438 to 3,047 m: 1
* 1,524 to 2,437 m: 2 (2002)

The most important airport in the Central African Republic is [[Bangui M'Poko International Airport]] (ICAO: FEFF)

=== Airports with unpaved runways ===
* Total: 47
* 2,438 to 3,047 m: 1
* 1,524 to 2,437 m: 10
* 914 to 1,523 m: 23
* Under 914 m: 13 (2002)

The '''''Forces armées centrafricaines (FACA)''''' are the [[armed forces]] of the [[Central African Republic]], established after independence in 1960. Today they are a rather weak institution, dependent on international support to hold back the enemies in the current [[Central African Republic Civil War|civil war]]. Its disloyalty to the president came to the fore during the mutinies in 1996–1997, but ever since then it has faced internal problems. It has been strongly criticised by human rights organisations due to its [[terrorism|terror]], including killings, [[torture]] and [[Sexual assault|sexual violence]].

==History==
===Role of military in domestic politics===
The military has played an important role in the history of [[Central African Republic]]. The current president, General [[François Bozizé]] is a former army chief-of-staff and his government includes several high-level military officers. Among the country’s five presidents since independence in 1960, three have been former army chiefs-of-staff, who have taken power through [[coups d’état]]. No president with military background has however been succeeded by a new military president.

The country’s first president, [[David Dacko]] was overthrown by his army chief-of-staff, [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]] in 1966. Following Bokassa, David Dacko was restored in 1981, only to be overthrown once again by his new army chief of staff, General [[André Kolingba]] after only a few months in power.

In 1993, [[Ange-Félix Patassé]] became the first elected president of the country. He became soon unpopular within the army, resulting in violent mutinies in 1996–1997. In May 2001, there was an unsuccessful coup attempt by Kolingba and once again Patassé had to turn to friends abroad for support, this time [[Libya]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]] were helpful. Some months later, in the end of October, Patassé sacked his army chief-of-staff, François Bozizé, and tried to arrest him. Bozizé then fled to [[Chad]] and gathered a group of rebellions. In 2002, he seized [[Bangui]] for a short period. In March 2003 Bozizé took power through a coup d’état .&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;&gt;[http://www.franceevasion.com/toutsavoir/pays-republique-centrafricaine.htm – Histoire: République centrafricaine]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance of ethnicity===
When General Kolingba became president in 1981, he implemented an ethnicity-based recruitment policy for the administration. Kolingba was a member of the Yakoma tribe from the south of the country, which made up approximately 5% of the total population. During his rule, members of Yakoma were granted all key positions in the administration and made up a majority of the military. This later had disastrous consequences, when Kolingba was replaced by a member of a northerner tribe, Ange-Félix Patassé.

===Army mutinies of 1996–1997===
Soon after the election 1993, Patassé became unpopular within the army, not least because of his inability to pay their wages (partly due to economic mismanagement and partly because [[France]] suddenly ended its economic support for the soldiers’ wages). Another reason for the irritation was that most of FACA consisted of soldiers from Kolingba’s ethnic group, the [[Yakoma]]. During Patassé’s rule they were becoming increasingly marginalised, while Patassé created militias favouring his own Gbaya tribe, as well as neighbouring Sara and Kaba. This resulted in army mutinies in 1996–1997, where fractions of the military clashed with the presidential guard, the ''Unité de sécurité présidentielle (USP)'' and militias loyal to Patassé.&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot;&gt;[http://www.sangonet.com/actu-snews/santeah/fich-RCA-unhcr2005.pdf – UNDP: Fiche Pays: République centrafricaine (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

* On April 18, 1996, there was a first mutiny by 200–300 soldiers who claimed that they had not received their wage since 1992–1993. The confrontations between the soldiers and the presidential guard resulted in 9 dead and 40 wounded. French forces were supporting (Operation Almandin I) and acted negotiators. The unrest ended when the soldiers were finally paid their wages by France and the President agreed not to start legal proceedings against the soldiers.

* On May 18, 1996, a second mutiny was led by 500 soldiers who refused to be disarmed and denounced the agreement reached in April. The French forces were once again called to Bangui (Operation Almadin II), supported by military from Chad and [[Gabon]]. 3,500 foreigners were evacuated during the unrest, which killed 43 persons and wounded 238.

* On May 26, a peace agreement was signed between France and the mutineers. The latter were promised amnesty, allowed to retain their weapons. Their security was ensured by the French military.

* On November 15, 1996, there was a third mutiny and 1,500 French soldiers were flown in to ensure the safety of the foreigners. The mutineers demanded the discharge of the president.

On 6 December, a negotiation process started, facilitated by Gabon, [[Burkina-Faso]], Chad and [[Mali]]. The military – supported by the opposition parties – keeps claiming that Patassé has to resign. In January, 1997, however, the Bangui Agreements were signed and the French EFAO troop was replaced by the 1,350 soldiers of the ''Mission interafricaine de surveillance des Accords de Bangui (MISAB)''. In March, all mutineers were granted amnesty. The fighting between MISAB and the mutineers continued with a large offensive in June, resulting in up to 200 casualties. After this final clash, the mutineers stayed calm.&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot; /&gt;

After the mutinies, President Patassé suffered from a typical &quot;dictator’s paranoia&quot;, resulting in a period of cruel terror executed by the presidential guard and various militia within the FACA loyal to the president, such as the Karako. It was directed against the Yakoma tribe, of which it is estimated that 20,000 persons fled during this period. But the oppression also targeted other parts of the society. The president accused his former ally France of supporting his enemies and seeks new international ties. When he strengthened his presidential guard (creating the FORSIDIR, see below), he Libya sent him 300 additional soldiers for his own personal safety. When former President Kolingba attempted a coup d’état in 2001 (which was, according to Patassé, supported by France), the [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] (MLC) of [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] in DR Congo came to his rescue.&lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/web/ar2002.nsf/afr/central+african+republic!Open – Amnesty International: Amnesty International Report 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crimes conducted by Patassé’s militias and Congolese soldiers during this period are now being investigated by the [[International Criminal Court]], who wrote that &quot;sexual violence appears to have been a central feature of the conflict&quot;, having identified more than 600 rape victims.&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070522/wl_africa_afp/icccentrafrica_070522145948 – Yahoo News: ICC to investigate Central African Republic sexual violence, 22 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present situation==
The FACA has been dominated by soldiers from the Yakoma ethnic group since the time of Kolingba. It has hence been considered disloyal by the two northerner presidents Patassé and Bozizé, both of whom have equipped and run their own militias outside FACA. The military also proved its disloyalty during the mutinies in 1996–1997. Although Francois Bozizé has a background in FACA himself (being its chief-of-staff from 1997 to 2001), he has been cautious by retaining the defence portfolio, as well as by appointing his son Jean-Francis Bozizé cabinet director in charge of running the Ministry of Defence. He kept his old friend General Antoine Gambi as Chief of Staff. Due to failure to curb deepening unrest in the northern part of the country, Gambi was in July 2006 replaced with Bozizé’s old friend from the military academy, Jules Bernard Ouandé.&lt;ref name=&quot;ten&quot;&gt;[http://www.afrik.com/article10063.html – AFRIK: Un nouveau chef pour l’armée centrafricaine, July 6, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military’s relations with the society===
The forces assisting Bozizé in seizing the power in 2003 were not paid what they were promised and started looting, terrorising and killing ordinary citizens. Summary executions have taken place with the implicit approval of the government. The situation has deteriorated since early 2006 and the regular army and the presidential guard regularly execute exertion, torture, killings and other human rights violations. There is no possibility for the national judicial system to investigate these cases. At the end of 2006, there were an estimated 150,000 internally displaced people. During a UN mission in the northern part of the country in November 2006, the mission had a meeting with a prefect who said that he could not maintain law and order over the military and the presidential guards. The FACA conducts summary executions and burn houses. Only on the route between [[Kaga-Bandoro]] and Ouandago, some 2,000 houses have been burnt, leaving an estimated 10,000 persons homeless.&lt;ref name=&quot;eleven&quot;&gt;[http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004BE3B1/(httpInfoFiles)/63ACDE89E61019B5C125726F0035E8A0/$file/CAR_report_Jan2007.pdf – Internal displacement in Central African Republic: a protection crisis, January 26, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform of the army===
Both the ''Multinational Force in the Central African Republic'' (FOMUC) and France are assisting in the current reform of the army. One of the key priorities of the reform of the military is make it more ethnically diversified. It should also integrate Bozizé’s own rebel group (mainly consisting of members of his own [[Gbaya people|Gbaya tribe]]). Many of the Yakoma soldiers who left the country after the mutinies in 1996–1997 have now returned and must also be reintegrated into the army. At the same time, BONUCA holds seminars in topics such as the relationship between military and civil parts of society.&lt;ref name=&quot;twelve&quot;&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2002/18174.htm – Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices – Central African Republic, March 31, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign military presence in support of the Government==
====Peacekeeping and peace enforcing forces====
Since the mutinies, a number of [[peacekeeping]] and [[Peace enforcement|peace enforcing]] international missions have been present in Central African Republic. There has been a discussion of the deployment of a regional [[United Nations]] (UN) peacekeeping force in both Chad and Central African Republic. But it is considered to shore up the ineffectual Darfur Peace Agreement. The missions deployed in the country during the last 10 years are the following:&lt;ref name=&quot;nine&quot;&gt;[http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/files/portal/spotlight/sudan/Sudan_pdf/SIB%205%20CAR.pdf – Sudan Issue Brief: A widening war around Sudan – The proliferation of armed groups in the Central African Republic, January 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chad====
In addition to the multilateral forces, there have been bilateral support from other African countries, such as the Libyan and Congolese support to Patassé, mentioned above. Bozizé is in many ways dependent on Chad support. Chad has an interest in CAR, since it needs to ensure calmness close to its oil fields and [[Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project|the pipeline leading to the Cameroonian coast]], close to the troubled northwest CAR. Before seizing power, Bozizé built up his rebel force in Chad, trained and augmented by the Chadian. President [[Idriss Déby|Déby]] assisted him actively in taking the power in March 2003 (his rebel forces included 100 Chadian soldiers). After the coup, another 400 soldiers were sent. Current direct support includes the 150 non-FOMUC Chadian troops that patrol the border area near Goré, the Chadian soldiers patrolling Bangui, but most of all the Chadian soldiers within the presidential lifeguard.&lt;ref name=&quot;nine&quot; /&gt; The CEMAC Force includes 121 Chadian soldiers.

====France====
There has been an almost uninterrupted French military presence in Central African Republic since independence, regulated through agreements between the two Governments. The French troops were allowed to be based in the country and to intervene in cases of destabilisation. This was particularly important during the cold war era, when Francophone Africa was regarded as a natural French sphere of influence.

Additionally, the strategic location of the country made it a more interesting location for military bases than its neighbours and [[Bouar]] and Bangui were hence two of the most important French bases abroad.

However, in 1997, following [[Lionel Jospin|Lionel Jospin’s]] expression “Neither interference nor indifference”, France came to adopt new strategic principles for its presence in Africa. This included a reduced permanent presence on the continent and an increased support to multilateral interventions.&lt;ref name=&quot;five&quot;&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/27c/377.html – New York Times: Out of Africa? Not the French, 12 January 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; In Central African Republic, the Bouar base and the Béal Camp (at that time home to 1,400 French soldiers) in Bangui were shut down, as the French concentrated its African presence to [[Abidjan]], [[Dakar]], [[Djibouti]], [[Libreville]] and [[N’Djamena]] and the deployment of a ''Force d’action rapide'', based in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot;&gt;[http://www.uca.edu.ar/esp/sec-fpoliticas/esp/docs-publicaciones/coleccion/ed-especial/02martin.pdf – Guy Martin: France’s African policy in transition: disengagement and redeployment, University of Virginia, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, due to the situation in the country, France has retained a military presence. During the mutinies, 2,400 French soldiers were patrolling the streets of Bangui. Their official task was to evacuate foreign citizens, but this did not prevent direct confrontations with the mutineers (resulting in French and mutineer casualties). The level of French involvement resulted in protests among the Central African population, since many took party for the mutineers and accused France of defending a dictator against the people’s will. Voices were also heard in France where some blamed France for its protection of a discredited ruler, totally incapable of exerting power and managing the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;seven&quot;&gt;[http://www.african-geopolitics.org/show.aspx?ArticleId=3466 – Francis Laloupo: Centrafrique, un  destin  confisqué]&lt;/ref&gt; After the mutinies in 1997, the MISAB was a multilateral force, but it was armed, equipped, trained and managed by France. The Chadian, Gabonese and [[Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] soldiers of the current ''Force multinationale en Centrafrique (FOMUC)'' mission in the country also enjoys logistical support from French soldiers.

A study carried out by the US Congressional Research Service reveals however that France has again increased its arms sales to Africa and during the 1998–2005 period, France was the leading supplier of arms to the continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;eight&quot;&gt;[http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=16055 – William Church: Africa: France Increases Arms Sales and Intervention, November 6, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components and units==
===Air Force===

The [[Air Force]] is almost inoperable. Lack of Funding has almost grounded the airforce apart from an AS 350 Ecureuil delivered in 1987. [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F1]] planes from the French Air Force regularly patrol troubled regions of the country and also participate in direct confrontations.&lt;ref name=&quot;fourteen&quot;&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWFiles2007.nsf/FilesByRWDocUnidFilename/F7B3CC0AA2F7ADE585257273005FD542-Full_Report.pdf/$File/Full_Report.pdf – Inter-agency Mission to Birao (CAR): 16 to 23 January 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; According to some sources, Bozizé used the money he got from the mining concession in [[Bakouma]] to buy two old [[Mil Mi-8|MI 8]] helicopters from Ukraine and one [[C-130 Hercules|Hercules C 130]], built in the 1950s, from USA.&lt;ref name=&quot;fifteen&quot;&gt;[http://www.afriqueeducation.com/archive/sommaire/article.php?id=390&amp;version=216 – Centrafrique : Bozizé ou la chronique d’une chute annoncée, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; The air force operates otherwise 7 light aircraft, including a single helicopter:

===Garde républicaine (GR)===
GR consists of so called patriots that fought for Bozizé when he seized power in 2003 (mainly from the Gbaya tribe), together with soldiers from Chad. They are guilty of numerous assaults on the civil population, such as terror, aggression, sexual violence. Only a couple of months after Bozizé’s seizure of power, in May 2003, taxi and truck drivers conducted a strike against these outrages.&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot; /&gt;

===New amphibious force===
Bozizé has created an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious force]]. It is called the Second Battalion of the Ground Forces and it patrols the [[Ubangi]] river. The staff of the sixth region in Bouali (mainly made up of members of the former president’s lifeguard) was transferred to the city of Mongoumba, located on the river. This city had previously been plundered by forces from MLC, that had crossed the border.&lt;ref name=&quot;thirteen&quot;&gt;[http://www.sangonet.com/ActualiteC16/2bataillons-creation_FB.html – Actualité Centrafrique de sangonet – Dossier 16: Le président Bozizé crée deux nouveaux bataillons, April 25, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veteran Soldiers===
A program for disarmament and reintegration of veteran soldiers is currently taking place. A national commission for the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration was put in place in September 2004. The commission is in charge of implementing a program wherein approximately 7,500 veteran soldiers will be reintegrated in civil life and obtain education.&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot; /&gt;

===Discontinued groups and units that are no longer part of FACA===
* {{Anchor|FORSIDIR}} '''FORSIDIR:''' The presidential lifeguard, Unité de sécurité présidentielle (USP), was in March 1998 transformed to the ''Force spéciale de défense des institutions républicaines (FORSDIR)''. In contrary to the army – which consisted mainly of southerner Yakoma members and which thereby was unreliable for the northerner president – this unit consisted of northerners loyal to the president. Before eventually being dissolved in January 2,000, this highly controversial group became feared for their terror and troubled Patassé’s relation with important international partners, such as France. Of its 1,400 staff, 800 were subsequently reintegrated into FACA, under the command of the chief-of-staff. The remaining 400 recreated the USP (once again under the command of the chief-of-staff).&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot; /&gt;

* {{Anchor|USP}} '''Unité de sécurité présidentielle (USP): ''' USP was Patassé’s presidential guard before and after FORSIDIR. When he was overthrown by Bozizé in 2003, the USP was dissolved and while some of the soldiers have been absorbed by FACA, others are believed to have joined the pro-Patassé rebel group FDPC that is fighting FACA in the north of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot; /&gt;

* {{Anchor|Patriots|Liberators}} '''The Patriots or Liberators: ''' Accompanied Bozizé when he seized power in March 2003. They are now a part of Bozizé’s lifeguard, the Garde républicaine, together with soldiers from Chad.&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot; /&gt;

* {{Anchor|OCRB}} '''Office central de répression du banditisme (OCRB):''' OCRB was a special unit within the police created to fight the looting after the army mutinies in 1996 and 1997. OCRB was guilty of numerous summary executions and arbitrary detentions, for which it has never been put on trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot; /&gt;

* {{Anchor|MLPC Militia}} '''MLPC Militia: ''' Le Mouvement de libération du peuple centrafricain (MLPC) was the former president, Patassé’s political party. Its militia was active already during the 1993 election, but was strengthened during the mutinies 1996 and 1997, particularly through its Karako militia. Its core consisted of Sara people from Chad and Central African Republic but during the mutinies it recruited many young people in Bangui.&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot; /&gt;

* {{Anchor|DRC Militia}} '''DRC Militia:''' Rassemblement démocratique centrafricain (RDC) is the party of General Kolingba who was president during the 1980s. Its militia is said to have camps in Mobaye and have bonds to former officials of Kolingba’s “cousin” [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in DR Congo.&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of the Central African Republic}}
President [[François Bozizé]] says that one of his priorities is to get the support of the international community&quot;.&lt;ref name=a&gt;[http://www.alwihdainfo.com/articles/voir_art.php?numart=7053&amp;categorie=articles – François Bozizé se confie au Messager, June 21, 2007]{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has indeed been visible in his relations to donor countries and international organisations. At the same time it is difficult to have an open policy towards neighbouring countries when they are used as safe haven by rebels regularly attacking [[Central African Republic]] (C.A.R.), or when one allied country is in war with another (as is [[Chad]]–[[Sudan]]). The [[Military of the Central African Republic]] cannot–even with the support of France and the Multinational Force of the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (FOMUC)–exert control over its own borders. Hence, armed groups are regularly entering the country from Chad and Sudan. The President says in an interview that he has a good relation with neighbours and fellow CEMAC countries, &quot;put aside the incident with Sudan when the border had to be closed since militia entered C.A.R. territory&quot;.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

== Participation in International Organisations ==
The Central African Republic is an active member in several Central African organizations, including the Economic and Monetary Union ([[CEMAC]]), the [[Economic Community of Central African States]] ([[CEEAC]]), the [[Central African Peace and Security Council]] ([[COPAX]]--still under formation), and the [[Central Bank of Central African States]] ([[BEAC]]). Standardization of tax, customs, and security arrangements between the Central African states is a major foreign policy objective of the C.A.R. Government. The C.A.R. is a participant in the [[Community of Sahel-Saharan States]] ([[CEN-SAD]]), and the [[African Union]] (AU).

Other multilateral organizations—including the [[World Bank]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[UN]] agencies, [[European Union]], and the [[African Development Bank]]--and bilateral donors—including Germany, Japan, the [[European Union]], and the United States—are significant development partners for the C.A.R.

== Bilateral Relations ==
Nineteen countries have resident diplomatic representatives in [[Bangui]], and the C.A.R. maintains approximately the same number of missions abroad. Since early 1989 the government recognizes both [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian state]]. The C.A.R. also maintains diplomatic relations with the [[People's Republic of China]]. The C.A.R. generally joins other African and developing country states in consensus positions on major policy issues. The most important countries the C.A.R. maintains bilateral relations include the following.

===France===
Although drops in its external assistance budget have reduced French military and social development aid to the country, France remains the most important bilateral donor and the country from which C.A.R. receives most imports. Its historic ties, its long military presence as well as its economic influence have also given it a political influence. The country closed its military bases in Bangui and [[Bouar]] in 1997 as a part of its new Africa policy and relations with C.A.R. decreased during the rule of former president [[Ange-Félix Patassé]]. France was however the first country to recognise Bozizé's government and during his time in power France has given logistic and intelligence support to the peace missions in the country.

===Cameroon===
[[Cameroon]] is probably the foreign country that most Central Africans identify with, since most people live in the western part of the country, close to the Cameroon border. It is also the most important regional trade partner of C.A.R.; most of the country's imports pass through the port of Douala, before being transported by truck to C.A.R.. Most of the 1,450&amp;nbsp;km road to the coast is now paved, only a short distance remains. Following the increase of violence in north-western C.A.R. in late-2005, there were at the end of 2006 about 48,000 refugees from C.A.R. in Cameroon.&lt;ref name=b&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org – United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chad===
Chad is one of President Bozizé's closest allies. Before seizing power in 2003, Bozizé's rebel group was equipped and trained in Chad. The group that finally overthrew President Patassé consisted of–in addition to Bozizé's own rebels–100 soldiers from Chad's Military. In addition to the 121 Chadian soldiers in the Multinational Force in the Central African Republic (FOMUC), there are still 150 soldiers from Chad in the C.A.R. The majority is found within the president's lifeguard, while others patrol Bangui and the north-west parts of the country.&lt;ref name=c&gt;[http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/files/portal/spotlight/sudan/Sudan_pdf/SIB%205%20CAR.pdf – Small Arms Survey, A widening war around Sudan: The proliferation of armed groups in the Central African Republic] {{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chad's president [[Idriss Déby]] has an interest in tranquility in north-western C.A.R., due to the proximity to the location of the [[Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project]]. In April 2006, the Chadian rebel group [[United Front for Democratic Change]], which is based in Darfur used C.A.R. as a transit route to Chad, when attacking [[N'Djamena]]. Bozizé, who has received much support from President Déby, immediately decided to close the C.A.R.-Sudan border (a decision which he has no capacity at all to enforce). The border was officially closed between April and December. Already a couple of weeks later, an [[Antonov]] cargo plane crossed the border from Sudan and landed at [[Tiringoulou]] airport in C.A.R., where it unloaded weapons and about 50 armed men who spread out in the area. In the end of June, Central African military and FOMUC peacekeepers clashed with these men near [[Gordil]], resulting in at least 30 casualties.&lt;ref name=c/&gt;

Chad had also maintained good relations with the previous president, Patassé. They were one of the countries that sent troops to defend Patassé during the mutinies in 1996-1997 and assisted in negotiating the subsequent Bangui accords. Following the increase of violence in north-western C.A.R. in late-2005, there were at the end of 2006 about 50,000 refugees from C.A.R. in Chad.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
Bozizé has surprisingly good relations both with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]] President [[Joseph Kabila]] and the former rebel leader [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]]. When the old president Kolingba tried to overthrow Patassé in May 2001, the [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] (MLC) came to his rescue. MLC controlled the northern part of DRC and its rebels were stationed on the other side of the [[Ubangi]] river from Bangui. The MLC executed between 60 and 120 persons, mainly from the Yakoma tribe and committed atrocities–including killing, looting and rape–against the population. This terror and the crimes carried out during MLC's war against Bozizé's rebels between October 2002 and March 2003 is now being investigated by the [[International Criminal Court]], which says it has identified 600 rape victims and the real numbers are expected to be higher.&lt;ref name=d&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/press/pressreleases/ICC-OTP-BN-20070522-220_A_EN.pdf – International Criminal Court: Background – Situation in the Central African Republic, 22 May 2007] {{Wayback|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/press/pressreleases/ICC-OTP-BN-20070522-220_A_EN.pdf|date =20070627171746}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the crimes were committed by Congolese MLC soldiers, but Bozizé's rebels, including elements from Chad, were also responsible.&lt;ref name=e&gt;[http://www.sangonet.com/actu-snews/santeah/fich-RCA-unhcr2005.pdf – UNHCR: Fiche Pays République Centrafricaine, January 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; During Bozizé's time in power, new clashes have taken place between his soldiers and the MLC. Bozizé has strengthened military presence along the border and deployed an amphibious force patrolling the Ubangi river. There were refugees from DRC in C.A.R. from July 1999 (when Kabila advanced in the region bordering C.A.R.). The refugees were repatriated following an agreement between UNHCR and the governments of the two countries in 2004. Refugees from C.A.R. in DRC were beginning to be repatriated in July 2004.&lt;ref name=e/&gt;

===Gabon===
Relations with [[Gabon]] are good, although it is not a neighbouring country. Gabon hosted a meeting in 2005, to solve the crisis following Bozizé barring of some candidates in the election.

===Libya===
[[Libya]] still plays an important role in the domestic politics of C.A.R.. Libya assisted C.A.R. in negotiating a peace agreement was signed in Tripoli in February 2007, between President Bozizé and the head of the ''Front démocratique du people centrafricain'' (FDPC) rebel movement (who is also said to have close ties to [[Union of Democratic Forces for Unity]] (UFDR), the rebel group that seized several cities in northern C.A.R. in November 2006).&lt;ref name=f&gt;[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/pays/centrafrique/article_depeche.asp?art_cle=AFP70437accorselleb0 – Jeune Afrique: Accord de paix en Libye entre le gouvernement centrafricain et des rebelles, 3 February, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Libya was previously one of the former president Patassé's closest allies, providing him with strong military support when he no longer trusted his own military or France. Patassé granted Libyan enterprises outstanding economic advantages, such as a 99 year concession on [[diamonds]], [[gold]], [[petroleum|oil]] and [[uranium]] all over the country.&lt;ref name=g&gt;[http://www.fodem.org/la_depeche/200210/021101-15%20AE%20MASSI.htm – Afrique Education n° 119 – du 1er au 15 Novembre 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether these agreements are still valid, but Bozizé has anyway a continuously good relation with Libya.

===Republic of the Congo===
During the election in 2005, President Denis Sassou-Nguesso openly supported Bozizé. The current FOMUC mission in C.A.R. includes soldiers from Congo-Brazzaville.

===Sudan===
Given that Bozizé accuses Sudan of supporting the UFDR rebels who are actively fighting the Central African Government, the relation between the two countries has remained good. Bozizé even planned to visit Khartoum in December 2006, but had to cancel his trip when Chad (which has strained relations with the Sudanese Government) threatened to withdraw its military support to C.A.R.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; Bozizé says that he is afraid of getting involved in the Darfur crisis and claims that the solution is in the hands of the Sudanese president.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; During the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] (1983–2005), there was a massive uncontrolled crossing of the Sudan-C.A.R. border by soldiers from the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] (SPLA), looking for safety during periods of attacks or drought. At the same time, C.A.R. was used by Sudan Armed Forces when launching attacks on the SPLA. Moreover, thousands of [[Sudanese refugees]] lived in C.A.R.; at the peak of the influx, by the early 1990s there were 36,000 [[Sudanese refugees]] in [[Mboki]] in south-east C.A.R. About half of the refugees were SPLA soldiers with more than 5000 weapons, who allegedly occupied towns as far as 200&amp;nbsp;km into the C.A.R. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was forced to close its refugee camp at Mboki in October 2002, due to the high prevalence of weapons.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; After the ending of the war, all refugees were repatriated to Sudan; the last of the 9,700 remaining in Central African Republic were evacuated in April 2007.&lt;ref name=h&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/news/NEWS/461f67102.html – http://www.unhcr.org – United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]&lt;/ref&gt; Sudan was one of the contributors to the peacekeeping force of the he Community of Sahel-Saharan States (CEN-SAD) in Central African Republic in 2001-2002.

===United States===
{{Main|Central African Republic-United States relations}}

The U.S. Embassy in [[Bangui]] was briefly closed as a result of the 1996-97 mutinies. It reopened in 1998 with limited staff, but [[United States Agency for International Development|U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID) and [[Peace Corps]] missions previously operating in Bangui did not return. The American Embassy in Bangui again temporarily suspended operations on November 2, 2002 in response to security concerns raised by the October 2002 launch of [[François Bozizé]]'s 2003 military [[coup]].

The Embassy reopened in January 2005; however, there currently is limited U.S. diplomatic/consular representation in the C.A.R. As a result, the ability of the Embassy to provide services to American citizens remains extremely limited. The [[United States Department of State]] approved the lifting of Section 508 aid restrictions triggered by the coup; U.S. assistance to the Central African Republic had been prohibited except in the areas of humanitarian aid and support for [[democratization]].

'''Chad''' ({{IPAc-en|En-us-Chad.ogg|ˈ|tʃ|æ|d}}; {{lang-fr|Tchad}}, {{lang-ar|تشاد}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Tšād}}''), officially known as the '''Republic of Chad''', is a [[landlocked country]] in [[Central Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Libya]] to the north, [[Sudan]] to the east, the [[Central African Republic]] to the south, [[Cameroon]] and [[Nigeria]] to the southwest, and [[Niger]] to the west. Due to its distance from the sea and its largely [[desert]] climate, the country is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Dead Heart of Africa&quot;.

Chad is divided into multiple regions: a desert zone in the north, an arid [[Sahel]]ian belt in the centre and a more fertile [[Sudan (region)|Sudanese]] [[savanna]] zone in the south. [[Lake Chad]], after which the country is named, is the largest [[wetland]] in Chad and the second largest in Africa. Chad's highest peak is the [[Emi Koussi]] in the [[Sahara]], and [[N'Djamena]], (formerly ''Fort-Lamy''), the capital, is the largest city. Chad is home to over 200 different [[List of ethnic groups in Chad|ethnic]] and [[Languages of Chad|linguistic groups]]. Arabic and French are the official languages. [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] are the most widely practised religions.

Beginning in the 7th millennium BC, human populations moved into the Chadian basin in great numbers. By the end of the 1st millennium BC, a series of states and empires rose and fell in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes that passed through the region. France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of [[French Equatorial Africa]].

In 1960 Chad obtained independence under the leadership of [[François Tombalbaye]]. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting [[The Tombalbaye Regime#Rebellion in Chad|civil war]] in 1965. In 1979 [[Transitional Government of National Unity|the rebels]] conquered the capital and put an end to the south's hegemony. However, the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until [[Hissène Habré]] defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general [[Idriss Déby]]. Recently, the [[Darfur conflict|Darfur crisis]] in Sudan has spilt over the border and [[War in Chad (2005–present)|destabilised the nation]], with hundreds of thousands of [[Sudanese refugees]] living in and around camps in eastern Chad.

While [[List of political parties in Chad|many political parties]] are active, power lies firmly in the hands of President Déby and his political party, the [[Patriotic Salvation Movement]]. Chad remains plagued by political violence and recurrent attempted [[coup d'état|coups d'état]] (see [[Battle of N'Djamena (2006)]] and [[Battle of N'Djamena (2008)]]).

Chad is one of the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|poorest]] and [[Corruption Perceptions Index|most corrupt]] countries in the world; most inhabitants live in poverty as [[Agriculture in Chad|subsistence herders and farmers]]. Since 2003 [[petroleum|crude oil]] has become the country's primary source of export earnings, superseding the traditional [[cotton]] industry.

==History==
{{main|History of Chad}}

In the 7th millennium BC ecological conditions in the northern half of Chadian territory favored human settlement, and the region experienced a strong population increase. Some of the most important [[African archaeology|African archaeological]] sites are found in Chad, mainly in the [[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region]]; some date to earlier than 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;S. Decalo, ''Historical Dictionary of Chad'', 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Collelo&quot;&gt;S. Collelo, ''Chad''&lt;/ref&gt;

For more than 2000 years, the Chadian Basin has been inhabited by agricultural and [[sedentary]] peoples. The region became a crossroads of civilizations. The earliest of these were the legendary [[Sao civilisation|Sao]], known from artifacts and oral histories. The Sao fell to the [[Kanem Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;D. Lange, &quot;The Chad region as a crossroad&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Decalo, 6&lt;/ref&gt; the first and longest-lasting of the empires that developed in Chad's [[Sahel]]ian strip by the end of the 1st millennium AD. The power of Kanem and its successors was based on control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes that passed through the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collelo&quot;/&gt; These states, at least tacitly [[Islam in Africa|Muslim]], never extended their control to the southern grasslands except to [[Arab slave trade|raid for slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Decalo, 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rabah photo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|By defeating and killing [[Rabih az-Zubayr]] on April 22, 1900, at the [[Battle of Kousséri]], France removed a major obstacle to its colonisation of Chad.]]

[[French colonial empires|French colonial expansion]] led to the creation of the {{lang|fr|''Territoire Militaire des Pays et Protectorats du Tchad''}} in 1900. By 1920, France had secured full control of the colony and incorporated it as part of [[French Equatorial Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Decalo, 8, 309&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colonial Chad|French rule in Chad]] was characterised by an absence of policies to unify the territory and sluggish modernisation. The French primarily viewed the colony as an unimportant source of untrained labour and raw cotton; France introduced large-scale cotton production in 1929. The colonial administration in Chad was critically understaffed and had to rely on the dregs of the French civil service. Only the south was governed effectively; French presence in the north and east was nominal. The educational system suffered from this neglect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collelo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Decalo, 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], France granted Chad the status of [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas territory]] and its inhabitants the right to elect representatives to the [[National Assembly of France|French National Assembly]] and a [[National Assembly of Chad|Chadian assembly]]. The largest political party was the [[Chadian Progressive Party]] (PPT), based in the southern half of the colony. Chad was granted independence on August 11, 1960 with the PPT's leader, [[François Tombalbaye]], as its first [[Heads of state of Chad|president]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Collelo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Decalo, 248–249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Nolutshungu, ''Limits of Anarchy'', 17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chadian soldier of WWII.jpg|thumb|left|upright|15,000 Chadian soldiers fought for [[Free French Forces|Free France]] during WWII.&lt;ref&gt;S. Decalo, 53&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Two years later, Tombalbaye banned opposition parties and established a one-party system. Tombalbaye's autocratic rule and insensitive mismanagement exacerbated interethnic tensions. In 1965 Muslims began a [[Transitional Government of National Unity|civil war]]. Tombalbaye was [[Chadian coup of 1975|overthrown and killed]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917376,00.html &quot;Death of a Dictator&quot;], ''Time'', (April 28, 1975). Accessed on September 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but the insurgency continued. In 1979 the rebel factions conquered the capital, and all central authority in the country collapsed. Armed factions, many from the north's rebellion, contended for power.&lt;ref&gt;S. Decalo, 12–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Nolutshungu, 268&lt;/ref&gt;

The disintegration of Chad caused the collapse of France's position in the country. [[Libya]] moved to fill the power vacuum and became [[Chadian-Libyan conflict|involved in Chad's civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Nolutshungu, 150&lt;/ref&gt; Libya's adventure [[Toyota War|ended in disaster]] in 1987; the French-supported president, [[Hissène Habré]], evoked a united response from Chadians of a kind never seen before&lt;ref&gt;S. Nolutshungu, 230&lt;/ref&gt; and forced the Libyan army off Chadian soil.&lt;ref&gt;K. Pollack, ''Arabs at War'', 391–397&lt;/ref&gt;

Habré consolidated his dictatorship through a power system that relied on corruption and violence; an estimated 40,000 people were killed under his rule.&lt;ref&gt;S. Macedo, ''Universal Jurisdiction'', 133–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chad: the Habré Legacy&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The president favoured his own [[Daza]] ethnic group and discriminated against his former allies, the [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]]. His general, [[Idriss Déby]], overthrew him in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;S. Nolutshungu, 234–237&lt;/ref&gt;

Déby attempted to reconcile the rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics. Chadians approved a [[Constitution of Chad|new constitution]] by [[Chadian constitutional referendum, 1996|referendum]], and in 1996, Déby easily won a [[Chadian presidential election, 1996|competitive presidential election]]. He won a [[Chadian presidential election, 2001|second term]] five years later.&lt;ref&gt;R. East and R. Thomas, ''Profiles of People in Power'', 100&lt;/ref&gt; [[Petroleum|Oil]] exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it hopes that Chad would at last have some chances of peace and prosperity. Instead, internal dissent worsened, and a [[War in Chad (2005–present)|new civil war]] broke out. Déby [[Chadian constitutional referendum, 2005|unilaterally modified the constitution]] to remove the two-term limit on the presidency; this caused an uproar among the civil society and opposition parties.&lt;ref&gt;IPS, &quot;{{lang|fr|Le pétrole au cœur des nouveaux soubresauts au Tchad}}&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Déby won [[Chadian presidential election, 2006|a third mandate]] in elections that the opposition boycotted. Ethnic violence in eastern Chad has increased; the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] has warned that a [[genocide]] like that in [[Darfur conflict|Darfur]] may yet occur in Chad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6367545.stm Chad may face genocide, UN warns]. BBC News, February 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and government==
{{main|Politics of Chad}}
{{see also|Foreign relations of Chad}}

Chad's constitution provides for a strong executive branch headed by a president who dominates the political system. The president has the power to appoint the [[Prime Minister of Chad|prime minister]] and the cabinet, and exercises considerable influence over appointments of judges, generals, provincial officials and heads of Chad's para-statal firms. In cases of grave and immediate threat, the president, in consultation with the [[National Assembly of Chad|National Assembly]], may declare a [[state of emergency]]. The president is [[Elections in Chad|directly elected]] by popular vote for a five-year term; in 2005 constitutional term limits were removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Term2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4118482.stm|title=Chad votes to end two-term limit|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2007-09-20|date=2005-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This removal allows a president to remain in power beyond the previous two-term limit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Term2&quot;/&gt; Most of Déby's key advisers are members of the Zaghawa ethnic group, although southern and opposition personalities are represented in [[Government of Chad|government]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BGN&quot;&gt;&quot;Background Notes: Chad&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UNPACP&quot;&gt;Republic of Chad – Public Administration Country Profile&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption is rife at all levels; [[Transparency International]]'s [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] for 2005 named Chad the most corrupt country in the world,&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, &quot;Worst corruption offenders named&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and it has fared only slightly better in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/content/download/10825/92857/version/1/file/CPI_2006_presskit_eng.pdf &quot;Corruption Perceptions Index 2006&quot;] (PDF), Transparency International. Accessed on September 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, it scored 1.8 out of 10 on the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] (with 10 being the least corrupt). Only [[Tonga]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Haiti]], [[Iraq]], [[Burma|Myanmar]], and [[Somalia]] scored lower.&lt;ref name=&quot;trans&quot;&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2007 &quot;Corruption Perceptions Index 2007&quot;] Transparency International. Accessed on December 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of President Déby have accused him of cronyism and tribalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;tribe&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4907650.stm &quot;'Isolated' Deby clings to power&quot;] BBC News. April 13, 2006. Accessed on September 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chad's legal system is based on [[law of France|French civil law]] and Chadian customary law where the latter does not interfere with public order or constitutional guarantees of equality. Despite the constitution's guarantee of judicial independence, the president names most key judicial officials. The legal system's highest jurisdictions, the [[Supreme Court of Chad|Supreme Court]] and the [[Constitutional Council of Chad|Constitutional Council]], have become fully operational since 2000. The Supreme Court is made up of a chief justice, named by the president, and 15 councillors, appointed for life by the president and the National Assembly. The Constitutional Court is headed by nine judges elected to nine-year terms. It has the power to review legislation, treaties and international agreements prior to their adoption.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UNPACP&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Embassy of Chad (Washington, D.C.).JPG|thumb|Embassy of Chad in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

The [[National Assembly of Chad|National Assembly]] makes legislation. The body consists of 155 members elected for four-year terms who meet three times per year. The Assembly holds regular sessions twice a year, starting in March and October, and can hold special sessions when called by the prime minister. Deputies elect a National Assembly president every two years. The president must sign or reject newly passed laws within 15 days. The National Assembly must approve the prime minister's plan of government and may force the prime minister to resign through a majority vote of no confidence. However, if the National Assembly rejects the executive branch's programme twice in one year, the president may disband the Assembly and call for new legislative elections. In practice, the president exercises considerable influence over the National Assembly through his party, the [[Patriotic Salvation Movement]] (MPS), which holds a large majority.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGN&quot;/&gt;

Until the legalisation of opposition parties in 1992, Déby's MPS was the sole legal party in Chad.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGN&quot;/&gt; Since, [[list of political parties in Chad|78 registered political parties]] have become active.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRP&quot;&gt;&quot;Chad&quot;, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, opposition parties and human rights organisations supported the boycott of the constitutional referendum that allowed Déby to stand for re-election for a third term&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chad&quot;, Amnesty International&lt;/ref&gt; amid reports of widespread irregularities in voter registration and government censorship of independent media outlets during the campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;FH&quot;&gt;&quot;Chad (2006)&quot;, Freedom House.&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondents judged the 2006 presidential elections a mere formality, as the opposition deemed the polls a farce and boycotted.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, &quot;Chad leader's victory confirmed&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Déby faces armed opposition from groups who are deeply divided by leadership clashes but united in their intention to overthrow him.&lt;ref&gt;ICG, &quot;{{lang|fr|Tchad: Vers le retour de la guerre?}}&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; These forces [[Battle of N'Djamena (2006)|stormed the capital]] on April 13, 2006, but were ultimately repelled. Chad's greatest foreign influence is France, which maintains 1,000 troops in the country. Déby relies on the French to help repel the rebels, and France gives the [[Military of Chad|Chadian army]] logistical and intelligence support for fear of a complete collapse of regional stability.&lt;ref&gt;PINR, &quot;Instability on the March in Sudan, Chad and Central African Republic&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Franco-Chadian relations were soured by the granting of oil drilling rights to the American [[ExxonMobil|Exxon]] company in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, &quot;Chad's vulnerable president&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Education in Chad|Educators]] face considerable challenges due to the nation's dispersed population and a certain degree of reluctance on the part of parents to send their children to school. Although attendance is compulsory, only 68% of boys attend primary school, and more than half of the population is illiterate. Higher education is provided at the [[University of N'Djamena]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BGN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;

==Humanitarian situation==
{{Main|Human rights in Chad}}
According to the [[United Nations]], Chad has been affected by a [[humanitarian crisis]] since at least 2001.  As of 2008, the country of Chad hosts over 280,000 refugees from the [[Sudan]]'s [[Darfur]] region, over 55,000 from the [[Central African Republic]], as well as over 170,000 [[internally displaced person]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/YSAR-7CGP7Z?OpenDocument ''Humanitarian Action in Chad: Facts and Figures – Snapshot Report''], UN, March 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008 in the aftermath of the [[Battle of N'Djamena (2008)|battle of N'Djamena]], UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs [[John Holmes (British diplomat)|John Holmes]] expressed &quot;extreme concern&quot; that the crisis would have a negative effect on the ability of humanitarians to deliver life-saving assistance to half a million beneficiaries, most of whom – according to him – heavily rely on humanitarian aid for their survival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/SHES-7BLMXD?OpenDocument ''Eastern Chad: Concerns over vital humanitarian needs''] (press release), [[United Nations|UN]], February 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; UN spokesperson [[Maurizio Giuliano]] stated to [[The Washington Post]]: &quot;If we do not manage to provide aid at sufficient levels, the humanitarian crisis might become a humanitarian catastrophe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Timberg, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/05/AR2008020500461.html ''Chadian Rebels Urge Cease-Fire As Push Falters''], [[The Washington Post]], February 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regions, departments, and sub-prefectures==
{{main|Regions of Chad|Departments of Chad|Sub-prefectures of Chad}}
Chad has been divided since February 2008 in [[regions of Chad|22 regions]].&lt;ref&gt;Ordonnance n° 002/PR/08 portant restructuration de certaines collectivités territoriales décentralisées]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;circonscritions&quot;&gt;[&quot;Tableau des codes des circonscritions – Ministère de l'Intérieur&quot;], April 2008.{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subdivision of Chad in regions came about in 2003 as part of the decentralisation process, when the government abolished the previous [[prefectures of Chad|14 prefectures]]. Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor. Prefects administer the [[departments of Chad|61 departments]] within the regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;circonscritions&quot;/&gt; The departments are divided into [[Sub-prefectures of Chad|200 sub-prefectures]], which are in turn composed of 446 cantons.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chad&quot;, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.

At {{km2 to mi2|1284000|spell=Commonwealth|precision=-3|wiki=yes|}}, Chad is the world's [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|21st-largest country]]. It is slightly smaller than [[Peru]] and slightly larger than South Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;&gt;&quot;Chad&quot;, ''The World Factbook''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Rank Order – Area&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Chad is in north central Africa, lying between latitudes [[7th parallel north|7°]] and [[24th parallel north|24°N]], and [[13th meridian east|13°]] and [[24th meridian east|24°E]]. Chad is bounded to the north by [[Libya]], to the east by [[Sudan]], to the west by [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]], and to the south by the [[Central African Republic]]. The country's capital is {{km to mi|1060|spell=Commonwealth|precision=-1|abbr=yes}} from the nearest seaport Douala (Cameroon).&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;&quot;Chad&quot;,''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UNHCHR&quot;&gt;&quot;Chad&quot;.

Botha, &quot;S.H. Frankel&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

A heritage of the colonial era, Chad's borders do not coincide wholly with natural boundaries. The dominant physical structure is a wide basin bounded to the north, east and south by mountain ranges such as the [[Ennedi Plateau]] in the north-east. [[Lake Chad]], after which the country is named, is the remains of an immense lake that occupied {{km2 to mi2|330000|spell=Commonwealth|precision=-4|abbr=yes}} of the Chadian Basin 7,000 years ago.

The region's tall grasses and extensive marshes make it favourable for birds, reptiles, and large mammals.

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Chad}}
Each year a tropical weather system known as the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone|intertropical front]] crosses Chad from south to north, bringing a [[wet season]] that lasts from May to October in the south, and from June to September in the Sahel.&lt;ref&gt;S. Decalo, ''Historical Dictionary of Chad'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; Variations in local rainfall create three major geographical zones. The Sahara lies in the country's northern third. Yearly precipitations throughout this belt are under {{convert|50|mm|in}}; only the occasional spontaneous palm grove survives, the only ones to do so south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]]. The Sahara gives way to a [[Sahel]]ian belt in Chad's centre; precipitation there varies from {{convert|300|to|600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year. In the Sahel, a steppe of thorny bushes (mostly [[acacia]]s) gradually gives way to the south to [[East Sudanian savanna]] in Chad's [[Sudan (region)|Sudanese]] zone. Yearly rainfall in this belt is over {{convert|900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNHCHR&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Its currency is the [[Central African CFA franc|CFA franc]]. Years of civil war have scared away foreign investors; those who left Chad between 1979 and 1982 have only recently begun to regain confidence in the country's future. In 2000 major direct foreign investment in the oil sector began, boosting the country's economic prospects.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BGN&quot;/&gt;

Over 80% of Chad's population relies on subsistence farming and livestock raising for its livelihood.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; The crops grown and the locations of herds are determined by the local climate. In the southernmost 10 percent of the territory lies the nation's most fertile cropland, with rich yields of [[sorghum]] and [[millet]]. In the Sahel only the hardier varieties of millet grow, and these with much lower yields than in the south. On the other hand, the Sahel is ideal pastureland for large herds of commercial cattle and for goats, sheep, donkeys and horses. The Sahara's scattered [[oasis|oases]] support only some dates and legumes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collelo&quot;/&gt;

Before the development of oil industry, cotton dominated industry and the labour market and accounted for approximately 80% of export earnings.&lt;ref&gt;S. Decalo, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton remains a primary export, although exact figures are not available. Rehabilitation of [[Cotontchad]], a major cotton company that suffered from a decline in world cotton prices, has been financed by France, the Netherlands, the European Union, and the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD). The [[parastatal]] is now expected to be privatised.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGN&quot;/&gt;

[[ExxonMobil]] leads a consortium of [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] and [[Petronas]] that has invested $3.7 billion to develop oil reserves estimated at one billion barrels in southern Chad. Oil production began in 2003 with the [[Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project|completion of a pipeline]] (financed in part by the [[World Bank]]) that links the southern oilfields to terminals on the Atlantic coast of Cameroon. As a condition of its assistance, the World Bank insisted that 80% of oil revenues be spent on development projects. In January 2006 the World Bank suspended its loan programme when the Chadian government passed laws reducing this amount.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OECD&quot;/&gt; On July 14, 2006, the World Bank and Chad signed a memorandum of understanding under which the Government of Chad commits 70% of its spending to priority poverty reduction programmes.&lt;ref&gt;''World Bank, Govt. of Chad Sign Memorandum of Understanding on Poverty Reduction''. World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil war crippled the development of [[transport in Chad|transport infrastructure]]; in 1987, Chad had only {{km to mi|30|spell=Commonwealth|precision=0|wiki=yes}} of paved roads. Successive road rehabilitation projects improved the network&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chad Poverty Assessment&quot;. World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; to {{km to mi|550|spell=Commonwealth|precision=0|wiki=yes}} by 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Lettre d'information. Délégation de la Commission Européenne au Tchad.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the road network is limited; roads are often unusable for several months of the year. With no railways of its own, Chad depends heavily on Cameroon's rail system for the transport of Chadian exports and imports to and from the seaport of [[Douala]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Chowdhury &amp; S. Erdenbileg, ''Geography Against Development''&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[N'Djamena International Airport|international airport]] serves the capital and provides regular direct flights to Paris and several African cities. The [[Communications in Chad|telecommunication system]] is basic and expensive, with fixed telephone services provided by the state telephone company [[SotelTchad]]. Only 14,000 fixed telephone lines serve all of Chad, one of the lowest telephone density rates in the world. Chad's energy sector has suffered from years of mismanagement by the parastatal Chad Water and Electric Society (STEE), which provides power for 15% of the capital's citizens and covers only 1.5% of the national population.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCG&quot;&gt;Chad Country Commercial Guide.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Chadians burn biomass fuels such as wood and animal manure for power.&lt;ref name=&quot;EIA&quot;&gt;&quot;Chad and Cameroon&quot;. Energy Information Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; Chad's cities face serious difficulties of municipal infrastructure; only 48% of urban residents have access to potable water and only 2% to basic sanitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chad – Community Based Integrated Ecosystem Management Project&quot;. World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's television audience is limited to N'Djamena. The only television station is the state-owned TeleTchad. Radio has a far greater reach, with 13 private radio stations. Newspapers are limited in quantity and distribution, and circulation figures are small due to transportation costs, low literacy rates, and poverty.&lt;ref name=&quot;EIA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;;&quot;Chad (2006)&quot;. ''Freedom of the Press: 2007 Edition''.&lt;/ref&gt; While the constitution defends liberty of expression, the government has regularly restricted this right, and at the end of 2006 began to enact a system of prior censorship on the media.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chad – 2006&quot;.

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Chad}}
2005 estimates place Chad's population at 10,146,000; 25.8% live in urban areas and 74.8% in rural ones.&lt;ref&gt;''World Population Prospects''.&lt;/ref&gt; The country's population is young: an estimated 47.3% is under 15. The birth rate is estimated at 42.35 births per 1,000 people, the mortality rate at 16.69. The life expectancy is 47.2 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Ouaddaian girl from Chad.jpg|thumb|175px|right|A [[Ouaddaï Region|Ouaddai]]an girl]]
Chad's population is unevenly distributed. Density is {{convert|0.1|/km2|abbr=on}} in the Saharan [[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region]] but {{convert|52.4|/km2|abbr=on}} in the [[Logone Occidental Region]]. In the capital, it is even higher.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNHCHR&quot;/&gt; About half of the nation's population lives in the southern fifth of its territory, making this the most densely populated region.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chad Livelihood Profiles&quot;. U.S. Agency for International Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban life is virtually restricted to the capital, whose population is mostly engaged in commerce. The other major towns are [[Sarh]], [[Moundou]], [[Abéché]] and [[Doba]], which are less urbanised but are growing rapidly and joining the capital as decisive factors in economic growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; Since 2003, 230,000 Sudanese refugees have fled to eastern Chad from war-ridden Darfur. With the 172,000 Chadians&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWFiles2007.nsf/FilesByRWDocUnidFilename/AMMF-76TJS4-Rapport_complet.pdf/$File/Rapport_complet.pdf {{lang|fr|Déplacés internes au Tchad}}]&quot; (PDF), July 2007, UNHCR.&lt;/ref&gt; displaced by the civil war in the east, this has generated increased tensions among the region's communities.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chad: Humanitarian Profile – 2006/2007&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polygamy]] is common, with 39% of women living in such unions. This is sanctioned by law, which automatically permits [[polygamy]] unless spouses specify that this is unacceptable upon marriage.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chad&quot;. ''Women of the World''.&lt;/ref&gt; Although violence against women is prohibited, domestic violence is common. [[Female genital cutting|Female genital mutilation]] is prohibited, but the practice is widespread and deeply rooted in tradition; 45% of Chadian women undergo the procedure, with the highest rates among [[Arab]]s, [[Hadjarai]], and Ouaddaians (90% or more). Lower percentages were reported among the [[Sara people|Sara]] (38%) and the [[Toubou]] (2%). Women lack equal opportunities in education and training, making it difficult for them to compete for the relatively few formal-sector jobs. Although property and inheritance laws based on the French code do not discriminate against women, local leaders adjudicate most inheritance cases in favour of men, according to traditional practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRP&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Chadian delegation.jpg|thumb|left|A tribal delegation]]
Chad has more than 200 distinct ethnic groups,&lt;ref name=&quot;BGN&quot;/&gt; which create diverse social structures. The colonial administration and independent governments have attempted to impose a national society, but for most Chadians the local or regional society remains the most important influence outside the immediate family. Nevertheless, Chad's peoples may be classified according to the geographical region in which they live. In the south live sedentary people such as the Sara, the nation's main ethnic group, whose essential [[social unit]] is the lineage. In the Sahel sedentary peoples live side-by-side with nomadic ones, such as the Arabs, the country's second major ethnic group. The north is inhabited by nomads, mostly Toubous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collelo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; The nation's official business languages are [[French language|French]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], but over 100 languages and dialects are spoken. Due to the important role played by itinerant Arab traders and settled merchants in local communities, [[Chadian Arabic]] has become a [[lingua franca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Collelo&quot;/&gt;

==Religion==
{{Main|Religion in Chad}}

Chad is a religiously diverse country. The 1993 census found that 54% of Chadians were [[Islam in Chad|Muslim]], 20% [[Roman Catholicism in Chad|Roman Catholic]], 14% [[Protestantism|Protestant]], 10% [[Animism|animist]], and 3% atheist.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNHCHR&quot;/&gt; None of these religious traditions is monolithic. Animism includes a variety of ancestor and place-oriented religions whose expression is highly specific. Islam is expressed in diverse ways. [[Christianity in Africa|Christianity]] arrived in Chad with the French and American missionaries; as with Chadian Islam, it [[syncretism|syncretises]] aspects of pre-Christian religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collelo&quot;/&gt; Muslims are largely concentrated in northern and eastern Chad, and animists and Christians live primarily in southern Chad and [[Guéra Region|Guéra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; The constitution provides for a secular state and guarantees religious freedom; different religious communities generally co-exist without problems.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chad&quot;, ''International Religious Freedom Report 2006''.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The vast majority of Muslims in the country are adherents of a moderate branch of mystical Islam ([[Sufism]]) known locally as [[Tijaniyah]], which incorporates some local African religious elements. A small minority of the country's Muslims hold more fundamentalist practices, which, in some cases, may be associated with Saudi-oriented Salafi-movement.

Roman Catholics represent the largest Christian denomination in the country. Most Protestants, including the Nigeria-based &quot;Winners Chapel,&quot; are affiliated with various evangelical Christian groups. Members of the [[Bahá'í]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] religious communities also are present in the country. Both faiths were introduced after independence in 1960 and therefore are considered to be &quot;new&quot; religions in the country.

Chad is home to foreign missionaries representing both Christian and Islamic groups. Itinerant Muslim preachers primarily from Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan, also visit. Saudi Arabian funding generally supports social and educational projects and extensive mosque construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71293.htm |title=U.S. Department of State |publisher=State.gov |date=2006-02-11 |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its great variety of peoples and languages, Chad possesses a rich cultural heritage. The Chadian government has actively promoted Chadian culture and national traditions by opening the [[Chad National Museum]] and the [[Chad Cultural Centre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; Six [[public holidays in Chad|national holidays]] are observed throughout the year, and movable holidays include the Christian holiday of [[Easter Monday]] and the Muslim holidays of [[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Eid ul-Adha]], and [[Mawlid|Eid Milad Nnabi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CCG&quot;/&gt;

[[Music of Chad|Regarding music]], Chadians play instruments such as the ''kinde'', a type of bow harp; the ''[[kakaki]]'', a long tin horn; and the ''hu hu'', a stringed instrument that uses [[calabash]]es as loudspeakers. Other instruments and their combinations are more linked to specific ethnic groups: the Sara prefer whistles, [[balafon]]es, harps and ''kodjo'' drums; and the [[Kanembu people|Kanembu]] combine the sounds of drums with those of flute-like instruments.&lt;ref name=&quot;culture&quot;&gt;&quot;Chad: A Cultural Profile&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tailor in Chad.jpg|left|thumb|A Chadian tailor sells traditional dresses.]]
The music group [[Chari Jazz]] formed in 1964 and initiated Chad's modern music scene. Later, more renowned groups such as African Melody and International Challal attempted to mix modernity and tradition. Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage by drawing on ''sai'', a traditional style of music from southern Chad. The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music. However, in 1995 greater interest has developed and fostered the distribution of CDs and audio cassettes featuring Chadian artists. Piracy and a lack of legal protections for artists' rights remain problems to further development of the Chadian music industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;culture&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Gondjé, &quot;{{lang|fr|La musique recherche son identité}}&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Millet is the staple food throughout Chad. It is used to make balls of paste that are dipped in sauces. In the north this dish is known as ''alysh''; in the south, as ''biya''. Fish is popular, which is generally prepared and sold either as ''salanga'' (sun-dried and lightly smoked ''[[Alestes]]'' and ''[[Hydrocynus]]'') or as ''banda'' (smoked larger fish).&lt;ref&gt;Symposium on the evaluation of fishery resources&lt;/ref&gt; ''Carcaje'' is a popular sweet drink extracted from hibiscus leaves. Alcoholic beverages, though absent in the north, are popular in the south, where people drink [[millet beer]], known as ''billi-billi'' when brewed from red millet and as ''coshate'' when from [[Proso millet|white millet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;culture&quot;/&gt;

As in other Sahelian countries, literature in Chad has suffered from an economic, political and spiritual drought that has affected its best known writers. Chadian authors have been forced to write from exile or expatriate status and have generated literature dominated by themes of political oppression and historical discourse. Since 1962, 20 Chadian authors have written some 60 works of fiction. Among the most internationally renowned writers are [[Joseph Brahim Seïd]], [[Baba Moustapha]], [[Antoine Bangui]] and [[Koulsy Lamko]]. In 2003 Chad's sole literary critic, [[Ahmat Taboye]], published his {{lang|fr|''Anthologie de la littérature tchadienne''}} to further knowledge of Chad's literature internationally and among youth and to make up for Chad's lack of publishing houses and promotional structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;culture&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Malo, &quot;{{lang|fr|Littérature tchadienne}}&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Boyd-Buggs &amp; J. Hope Scott, ''Camel Tracks'', 12, 132, 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of a Chadian film industry has suffered from the devastations of civil war and from the lack of [[movie theater|cinemas]], of which there is only one in the whole country. The first Chadian [[feature film]], the [[docudrama]] ''[[Bye Bye Africa]]'', was made in 1999 by [[Mahamat Saleh Haroun]]. His later film ''[[Abouna]]'' was critically acclaimed, and his ''[[Daratt]]'' won the Grand Special Jury Prize at the [[63rd Venice International Film Festival]]. [[Issa Serge Coelo]] directed Chad's two other films, ''[[Daresalam]]'' and ''[[DP75: Tartina City]]''.&lt;ref&gt;N. Bambé, &quot;Issa Serge Coelo&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Young, ''An interview with Mahamet-Saleh Haroun''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, &quot;Mirren crowned 'queen' at Venice&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Alphonse, &quot;Cinéma&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Association football|Football]] is Chad's most popular [[sport in Chad|sport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Basketball]] and freestyle wrestling are widely practiced, the latter in a form in which the wrestlers don traditional animal hides and cover themselves with dust.&lt;ref name=&quot;culture&quot;/&gt;

'''Chile''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|en-us-Chile.ogg|ˈ|tʃ|ɪ|l|iː}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chile |title=Chile|publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
officially the '''Republic of Chile''' ({{lang-es|República de Chile}} {{IPA-es|reˈpuβlika ðe ˈtʃile||RepChile.ogg}}), is a country in [[South America]] occupying a long, narrow coastal strip between the [[Andes]] mountains to the east and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west. It borders [[Peru]] to the north, [[Bolivia]] to the northeast, [[Argentina]] to the east, and the [[Drake Passage]] in the far south. Along with [[Ecuador]], it is one of two countries in South America that do not border [[Brazil]]. The Pacific coastline of Chile is 6,435 kilometres (4000&amp;nbsp;mi).&lt;ref name=factbook&gt;{{cite web|title=Racial Structure|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of [[Juan Fernández Islands|Juan Fernández]], [[Salas y Gómez]], [[Desventuradas Islands|Desventuradas]] and [[Easter Island]]. Chile also claims about {{convert|1250000|km2}} of [[Antarctica]], although all claims are suspended under the [[Antarctic Treaty]].

The shape of Chile is a distinctive ribbon of land {{convert|4300|km}} long and on average {{convert|175|km}} wide. [[climate of Chile|Its climate]] varies, ranging from the world's driest desert – the [[Atacama]] – in the north, through a [[Mediterranean climate]] in the centre, to a rainy [[temperate]] climate in the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-Chile&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1222764.stm|title=Country profile: Chile | work=BBC News | date=2009-12-16 | accessdate=2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern desert contains great mineral wealth, principally [[copper]]. The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources, and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century, when it incorporated its northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands and features a string of [[volcano]]es and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of [[Fjords and channels of Chile|fjords, inlets, canals]], twisting peninsulas, and islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDoS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1981.htm|title=Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, Background Note: Chile|publisher=United States Department of State|year=2008|month=January}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under [[Inca]] rule while the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] [[Mapuche]] inhabited central and southern Chile. Chile [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|declared its independence]] from Spain on February 12, 1818.

There are various theories about the origin of the word ''Chile''.

==History==
{{Main|History of Chile}}

===Early history and colonization===
[[File:Urville-Araucanians.jpg|thumb|The Mapuche people were the original inhabitants of southern and central Chile]]
About 10,000 years ago, migrating [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] settled in fertile valleys and coastal areas of what is present-day Chile. Example settlement sites from the very early human habitation are [[Monte Verde]], [[Cueva del Milodon]] and the [[Pali Aike Crater]]'s [[lava tube]]. The Incas briefly extended their empire into what is now northern Chile, but the Mapuche (or Araucanians as they were known by the Spaniards) successfully resisted many attempts by the Inca Empire to subjugate them, despite their lack of state organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Nf8SnJ_ZJbkC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=inca+did+not+conquer+araucanians |title=Chile – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2002-12-20|accessdate=2009-12-17|isbn=9789812348906}}&lt;/ref&gt; They fought against the Sapa Inca Tupac Yupanqui and his army. The result of the bloody three-day confrontation known as the [[Battle of the Maule]] was that the Inca conquest of the territories of Chile ended at the [[Maule river]].&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

In 1520, while attempting to circumnavigate the earth, [[Ferdinand Magellan]] discovered the southern passage now named after him, the [[Strait of Magellan]]. The next Europeans to reach Chile were Diego de Almagro and his band of Spanish conquistadors, who came from Peru in 1535 seeking [[gold]]. The Spanish encountered various cultures that supported themselves principally through slash-and-burn [[agriculture]] and [[hunting]]. The conquest of Chile began in earnest in 1540 and was carried out by [[Pedro de Valdivia]], one of [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s lieutenants, who founded the city of Santiago on February 12, 1541. Although the Spanish did not find the extensive gold and [[silver]] they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential of Chile's central valley, and Chile became part of the [[Spanish Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Pedro de Valdivia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Pedro de Valdivia]]
[[File:Ohiggins.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Bernardo O'Higgins]], Supreme Director of Chile]]

Conquest of the land took place gradually, and the Europeans suffered repeated setbacks at the hands of the local population. A massive Mapuche insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia's death and the destruction of many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of [[slavery]] by the Spanish crown in 1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the Mapuche intensified resistance rather than cowing them into submission. Despite the royal prohibitions relations remained strained from continual colonialist interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/storiadellaguer00caivgoog/storiadellaguer00caivgoog_djvu.txt |title=Bárbaros, page 66. David J. Weber |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cut off to the north by desert, to the south by the Mapuche, to the east by the Andes Mountains, and to the west by the ocean, Chile became one of the most centralized, homogeneous colonies in Spanish America. Serving as a sort of frontier [[garrison]], the colony found itself with the mission of forestalling encroachment by both the Mapuche and Spain's European enemies, especially the [[British Empire|British]] and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. Buccaneers and English adventurers menaced the colony in addition to the Mapuche, as was shown by [[Sir Francis Drake]]'s 1578 raid on Valparaíso, the colony's principal port. Chile hosted one of the largest standing armies in the Americas, making it one of the most militarized of the Spanish possessions, as well as a [[Real Situado|drain on the treasury of the Viceroyalty of Peru]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hudson&quot;/&gt; 

The first general census was performed by the government of [[Agustín de Jáuregui]] between 1777 and 1778; it indicated that the population consisted of 259,646 inhabitants: 73.5% of [[White Latin American|European descent]], 7.9% [[mestizo]]s, 8.6% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] and 9.8% [[black]]s. Francisco Hurtado, [[Governor]] of the province of [[Chiloé Province|Chiloé]], conducted a census there in 1784 and found the population consisted of 26,703 inhabitants, 64.4% of which were whites and 33.5% of which were natives.

The Diocese of [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] conducted a census of areas south of the [[Maule river]] in 1812, but did not include the indigenous population or the inhabitants of the province of Chiloé. The population is estimated at 210,567, 86.1% of which were [[Spanish Chilean|Spanish]] or of European descent, 10% of which were Indians and 3.7% of which were [[mestizo]]s, [[black people|blacks]] and [[mulatto]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.cl/canales/usuarios/cedoc_online/censos/pdf/censo_1813.pdf |title=INE – Censo de 1813.

===Independence===
The usurpation of the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish throne]] by [[Napoleon I|Napoleon's]] brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] in 1808 precipitated the drive by the colony for [[Chilean War of Independence|independence from Spain]]. A national junta in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand]] – heir to the deposed king – was formed on September 18, 1810. The [[Government Junta of Chile (1810)|Government Junta of Chile]] proclaimed Chile an autonomous republic within the Spanish [[monarchy]] (in memory of this day Chile celebrates its [[Fiestas Patrias (Chile)|National Day]] on September 18 each year). After these events, a movement for total independence, under the command of [[José Miguel Carrera]] (one of the most renowned patriots) and his two brothers Juan José and [[Luis Carrera]], soon gained a wider following. Spanish attempts to re-impose arbitrary rule during what was called the [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]] led to a prolonged struggle, including infighting from [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], who challenged Carrera's leadership.

Intermittent warfare continued until 1817. With Carrera in prison in Argentina, O'Higgins and anti-Carrera cohort [[José de San Martín]], hero of the [[Argentine War of Independence]], led [[Army of the Andes|an army]] that [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes]] into Chile and defeated the royalists. On February 12, 1818, [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|Chile was proclaimed an independent republic]]. The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Combate naval.jpg|thumb|War of the Pacific: The [[Battle of Iquique]] on May 21, 1879]]

Toward the end of the 19th century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by suppressing the Mapuche during the [[Occupation of Araucanía]]. A treaty with Argentina confirming Chilean sovereignty over the Strait of Magellan was signed in 1881. As a result of the War of the Pacific with Peru and Bolivia (1879–83), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating Bolivia's access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable [[nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence.

The [[Chilean Civil War]] in 1891 brought about a redistribution of power between the President and Congress, and Chile established a parliamentary style democracy. However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards who had strong ties to foreign investors.

===20th century===
The Chilean economy partially degenerated into a system protecting the interests of a ruling [[oligarchy]]. By the 1920s, the emerging middle and [[working class]]es were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, [[Arturo Alessandri Palma]], whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress. In the 1920s, [[Marxism|Marxist]] groups with strong popular support arose.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

A military coup led by General [[Luis Altamirano]] in 1924 set off a period of great political instability that lasted until 1932. The longest lasting of the ten governments between those years was that of General [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]], who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a de facto dictatorship, although not really comparable in harshness or corruption to the type of military dictatorship that has often bedeviled the rest of Latin America .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Authoritarianism in Latin America since independence|last=Fowler|first=Will|year=1996|publisher=Geenwood Press|location=University of Virginia|isbn=0313298432|pages=30–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Salt in the sand|last=Frazier|first=Lessie Jo|year=2007|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Duke University|isbn=0822340038|pages=163–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor, Ibáñez del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years, in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his ideology. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. During the period of [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]] dominance (1932–52), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ibáñez del Campo to office for another six years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded Ibáñez del Campo in 1958, bringing Chilean conservatism back into power democratically for another term.

The [[Chilean presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]] of [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] by an [[absolute majority]] initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan &quot;Revolution in Liberty&quot;, the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and [[agrarian reform]], including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/chile/85.htm|title=Development and Breakdown of Democracy, 1830-1973|work=Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress|date=1994-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:S.Allende 7 dias ilustrados.JPG|thumb|upright|President Salvador Allende]]
In the 1970 election, Senator [[Salvador Allende]] of the [[Socialist Party of Chile]] (part of the &quot;[[Popular Unity]]&quot; coalition which included the Communists, Radicals, Social-Democrats, dissident Christian Democrats, the Popular Unitary Action Movement, and the Independent Popular Action),&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt; achieved a partial majority in a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in a three-way contest, followed by candidates Radomiro Tomic for the Christian Democrat Party and Jorge Alessandri for the Conservative Party. Allende was not elected with an absolute majority, receiving fewer than 35% of votes. It became a war of classes, motivated by the central government.
Despite pressure from the [[United States]] government, the [[National Congress of Chile|Chilean Congress]] conducted a runoff vote between the leading candidates, Allende and former president Jorge Alessandri and keeping with tradition, chose Allende by a vote of 153 to 35. Frei refused to form an alliance with Alessandri to oppose Allende, on the grounds that the Christian Democrats were a workers party and could not make common cause with the right-wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Mares | first = David | authorlink = | coauthors = Francisco Rojas Aravena | title =  The United States and Chile: coming in from the cold | publisher = Routledge | year = 2001 | location = | page = 145 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=0Y3EWkKZsYcC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=frei+refuses+alessandri | doi = | id = | isbn = 9780415931250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Trento | first = Joseph | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Secret history of the CIA | publisher = Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers | year = 2005 | location = | page = 560 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=3uPBM7z_62gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+secret+history+of+the+cia&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q= | doi = | id = | isbn = 9780786715008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[economic depression]] that began in 1972 was exacerbated by [[capital flight]], plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and [[unemployment]] rose. Allende adopted measures including price freezes, wage increases, and tax reforms, to increase consumer spending and redistribute income downward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=99ZLX52z_noC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=%C3%A1rea+de+propiedad+social |title=Politics in Chile: socialism ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-17|isbn=9780813342276|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joint public-private [[public works]] projects helped reduce unemployment.&lt;ref name=&quot;De Vylder&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Allende’s Chile: The political economy of the rise and fall of the Unidad Popular|last=De Vylder|first=Stefan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521210461}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Much of the banking sector was [[nationalization|nationalized]].

The economic problems were also exacerbated by Allende's public spending which was financed mostly by printing money and poor credit ratings given by commercial banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879153,00.html|title=Tightening the Belt|publisher=Time Magazine|date = August 07, 1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crippled economy was further battered by prolonged and sometimes simultaneous [[strike action|strikes]] by physicians, teachers, students, truck owners, copper workers, and the small business class.
On 26 May 1973, Chile’s Supreme Court, which was opposed to Allende's government, unanimously denounced the Allende ''disruption of the legality of the nation''. Although illegal under the Chilean constitution, the court supported and strengthened Pinochet's seizure of power.&lt;ref name=friedman368/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/rightdegree_independence(5).pdf|title=Transition to Democracy in Latin America: The Role of the judiciary|publisher=Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Democrat [[Patricio Aylwin]], the candidate of a coalition of 17 political parties called the ''[[Coalition of Parties for Democracy|Concertación]]'', received an absolute majority of votes (55%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6DD1E3BF935A25751C1A96F948260|title=Man in the News: Patricio Aylwin; A Moderate Leads Chile|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-05-02 | first=Shirley | last=Christian | date=1989-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Aylwin served from 1990 to 1994, in what was considered a transition period.

In December 1993, Christian Democrat [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]], the son of previous president Eduardo Frei Montalva, led the Concertación coalition to victory with an absolute majority of votes (58%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.con/doc/1P2-8257609.html|title=Chile elects new leader Late president's son wins big}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 2010, Chile was struck by an 8.8 M&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; [[2010 Chile earthquake|earthquake]], one of the largest ever recorded in the world. As many as 500 people died; hundreds of thousands of buildings were damaged. The earthquake was also followed by multiple aftershocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australia-times.com.au/world/article.php?id=501|title=US ready to help Chile: Obama|publisher=The Australia Times|accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial damage estimates were in the range of [[United States dollar|US$]]15-30 billion, around 10% to 15% of Chile real gross domestic product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contractmagazine.com/contract/content_display/design/news/e3i128fcc3d3e64156a013dfae605b73a5b More Quakes Shake Chile’s Infrastructure], Adam Figman, ''Contract Magazine'', March 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On March 11, 2010, a [[2010 Pichilemu earthquake|6.9-magnitude earthquake]] occurred southwest of [[Pichilemu]], [[O'Higgins Region]].

On August 5, 2010 [[2010 Copiapó mining accident|an access tunnel caved in at the San José copper and gold mine]]. 33 miners were trapped 700 meters underground. The miners were discovered alive on August 22; it took nearly two more months before an escape path could be created to rescue the miners. In a 24-hour period between October 12 and 13, more than 1 billion people watched the culmination of the two-month rescue live on television networks around the world. The survival of the San José miners surpasses a 25-day rescue of three coal miners from a flooded mine in Guizhou, China, in 2009.

The current Constitution of Chile was approved in a national plebiscite in September 1980, under the military government of Augusto Pinochet. It entered into force in March 1981. After Pinochet's defeat in the 1988 plebiscite, the constitution was amended to ease provisions for future amendments to the Constitution. In September 2005, President Ricardo Lagos signed into law several constitutional amendments passed by Congress. These include eliminating the positions of appointed senators and [[senators for life]], granting the President authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, and reducing the presidential term from six to four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4157908.stm|title=Chile scraps Pinochet-era system|publisher=BBC | date=2005-08-16 | accessdate=2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chileans voted in the first round of presidential elections on December 13, 2009. None of the four presidential candidates got more than 50% of the vote. As a result, the top two candidates, center-left [[Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia]] coalition's [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]] and center-right [[Coalición por el Cambio]] coalition's [[Sebastián Piñera]], competed in a run-off election on January 17, 2010, which [[Sebastián Piñera]] won. This was Chile's fifth presidential election since the end of the Pinochet era. All five have been judged free and fair. The president is constitutionally barred from serving consecutive terms.

The [[Congress of Chile]] has a 38-seat [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] and a 120-member [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]]. Senators serve for 8 years with staggered terms, while deputies are elected every 4 years. The current Senate has a 20-18 split in favor of the opposition coalition. The last congressional elections were held on December 13, 2009, concurrently with the presidential election. The current lower house-the Chamber of Deputies-contains 58 members of the governing center-right coalition, 54 from the center-left opposition and 8 from small parties or independents. The Congress is located in the port city of Valparaíso, about 140 kilometres (84&amp;nbsp;mi) west of the capital, Santiago.

Chile's congressional elections are governed by a binomial system that rewards the two largest representations. Therefore, there are only two senate and two deputy seats apportioned to each electoral district, parties are forced to form wide coalitions and, historically, the two largest coalitions (Concertación and Alianza) split most of the seats in a district. Only if the leading coalition ticket out-polls the second place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does the winning coalition gain both seats.

In the 2001 congressional elections, the conservative [[Independent Democratic Union]] surpassed the [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile|Christian Democrats]] for the first time to become the largest party in the lower house. In the [[Chilean parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]], both leading parties, the Christian Democrats and the [[Independent Democrat Union|UDI]] lost representation in favor of their respective allies [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] (which became the biggest party in the Concertación block) and [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]] in the right-wing alliance. In the last legislative elections in Chile, the [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist Party]] won 3 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in 30 years (the Communisty Party was not allowed to exist as such during the dictatorship).

Chile's judiciary is independent and includes a court of appeal, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the [[Supreme Court of Chile]]. In June 2005, Chile completed a nationwide overhaul of its criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chileangovernment.cl/index.php?id=448&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view|work=Chilean Government|title=President Lagos: We can make a greater effort to make yesterday's and today's trials equally just}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reform has replaced inquisitorial proceedings with an adversarial system more similar to that of the United States.

Chile's Armed Forces are subject to civilian control exercised by the president through the Minister of Defense. The president has the authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

The commander in chief of the [[Chilean Army]] is General Juan Miguel Fuente-Alba Poblete. The Chilean Army is 45,000 strong and is organized with an Army headquarters in Santiago, seven divisions throughout its territory, an Air Brigade in Rancagua, and a Special Forces Command in Colina. The Chilean Army is one of the most professional and technologically advanced armies in Latin America.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

Admiral Edmundo Gonzalez Robles directs the 21,773-person [[Chilean Navy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armada.cl/p4_ingles/site/artic/20050707/pags/20050707095041.html ]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 2,500 Marines. Of the fleet of 29 surface vessels, only eight are operational major combatants (frigates). Those ships are based in Valparaiso.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armada.cl/p4_ingles/site/artic/20050719/pags/20050719132710.html ]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy operates its own aircraft for transport and patrol; there are no Navy fighter or bomber aircraft. The Navy also operates four submarines based in Talcahuano.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armada.cl/p4_ingles/site/artic/20050719/pags/20050719132849.html ]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gen. Ricardo Ortega Perrier heads the 12,500 strong [[Chilean Air Force]]. Air assets are distributed among five air brigades headquartered in Iquique, Antofagasta, Santiago, Puerto Montt, and Punta Arenas. The Air Force also operates an airbase on King George Island, Antarctica. The Air Force took delivery of the final 2 of 10 F-16s, all purchased from the U.S., in March 2007 after several decades of U.S. debate and previous refusal to sell. Chile also took delivery in 2007 of a number of reconditioned Block 15 F-16s from the Netherlands, bringing to 18 the total of F-16s purchased from the Dutch.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

After the military coup in September 1973, the [[Carabineros de Chile|Chilean national police]] (Carabineros) were incorporated into the Defense Ministry. With the return of democratic government, the police were placed under the operational control of the Interior Ministry but remained under the nominal control of the Defense Ministry. Gen. Eduardo Gordon is the head of the national police force of 40,964&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carabineros.cl/sitioweb/web/verSeccion.do?cod=239&amp;codContenido=429 Carabineros de Chile]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}, accessed on May 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; men and women who are responsible for law enforcement, traffic management, narcotics suppression, border control, and counter-terrorism throughout Chile.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Chile}}
[[File:Sebastián Piñera - David Cameron.jpg|thumb|130px|Sebastián Piñera with [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[David Cameron]], outside [[10 Downing Street]], [[London]].]]
Since the early decades after independence, Chile has always had an active involvement in foreign affairs. In 1837 the country aggressively challenged the dominance of Peru's port of [[Callao]] for preeminence in the Pacific trade routes, defeating the short-lived alliance between Peru and Bolivia, the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] (1836–39) in the [[War of the Confederation]]. The war dissolved the confederation while distributing power in the Pacific. A second international war, the War of the Pacific (1879–83), further increased Chile's regional role, while adding considerably to its territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;hudson&quot;/&gt;

During the 19th century, Chile's commercial ties were primarily with Britain, a country that had a decisive influence on the organization of the navy. The French influenced Chile's legal and educational systems and had a decisive impact on Chile, through the architecture of the capital in the boom years at the turn of the century. German influence came from the organization and training of the army by [[Prussia]]ns.&lt;ref name=&quot;hudson&quot;/&gt;

On June 26, 1945, Chile participated as a founding member of the United Nations being among 50 countries that signed the [[United Nations Charter]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/members/list.shtml#c|title=United Nations Member States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/members/growth.shtml|title=United Nations Member States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/av/photo/detail/0001314.html?browse=all.html|title=The San Francisco Conference: Chile Signs United Nations Charter}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the military coup of 1973, Chile became isolated politically as a result of widespread human rights abuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;hudson&quot;/&gt;

Since its return to democracy in 1990, Chile has been an active participant in the international political arena. Chile completed a 2-year non-permanent position on the UN Security Council in January 2005. Jose Miguel Insulza, a Chilean national, was elected Secretary General of the Organization of American States in May 2005 and confirmed in his position, being re-elected in 2009. Chile is currently serving on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors, and the 2007-2008 chair of the board is Chile's ambassador to the IAEA, Milenko E. Skoknic. The country is an active member of the UN family of agencies and participates in UN peacekeeping activities. It is currently bidding for a seat on the UN Human Rights Council. Chile hosted the Defense Ministerial of the Americas in 2002 and the APEC summit and related meetings in 2004. It also hosted the Community of Democracies ministerial in April 2005 and the Ibero-American Summit in November 2007. An associate member of Mercosur and a full member of APEC, Chile has been an important actor on international economic issues and hemispheric free trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

The Chilean Government has diplomatic relations with most countries. It settled its territorial disputes with Argentina during the 1990s. Chile and Bolivia severed diplomatic ties in 1978 over Bolivia's desire to reacquire territory it lost to Chile in 1879-83 War of the Pacific. The two countries maintain consular relations and are represented at the Consul General level.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

===Administrative divisions===
{{main|Administrative divisions of Chile}}
[[File:ChileRegions.png|thumb|110px|The regions of Chile]]
Chile is divided into 15 regions, each headed by an [[intendant]] appointed by the president. The regions are further divided into provinces, with provincial governors also appointed by the president. Finally each province is divided into [[Communes of Chile|communes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gobiernodechile.cl/organigrama/organigrama.asp|title=Organigrama|work=Gobierno de Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are administered by municipalities, each with its own mayor and council elected for four year terms. Each region is designated by a name and a [[Roman numeral]], assigned from north to south. The only exception is the Santiago Metropolitan Region which is designated ''RM'' (''Región Metropolitana''). Two new regions were created in 2006 and became operative in October 2007; Los Ríos in the south (Region XIV), and Arica y Parinacota in the north (Region XV). The numbering scheme skipped Region [[Triskaidekaphobia|XIII]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Chile}}
[[File:Parinacota volcano.jpg|thumb|[[Parinacota Volcano]] in northern Chile]]
A long and narrow coastal [[Southern Cone]] country on the west side of the [[Andes Mountains]], Chile stretches over 4,630 kilometres (2,880&amp;nbsp;mi) north to south, but only 430 kilometres (265&amp;nbsp;mi) at its widest point east to west. This encompasses a remarkable variety of [[landscape]]s. It contains {{convert|756950|km2}} of land area. It is situated within the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. Including its offshore islands, but excluding its Antarctic claim, Chile lies between latitudes [[17th parallel south|17°]] and [[56th parallel south|56°S]], and longitudes [[66th meridian east|66°]] and [[81st meridian east|81°W]].

The northern [[Atacama Desert]] contains great mineral wealth, primarily copper and nitrates. The relatively small Central Valley, which includes Santiago, dominates the country in terms of population and agricultural resources. This area also is the historical center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century, when it integrated the northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests, grazing lands, and features a string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands. The Andes Mountains are located on the eastern border. Chile is the longest north-south country in the world, and also claims {{convert|1250000|km2|abbr=on}} of [[Antarctica]] as part of its territory. However, this latter claim is suspended under the terms of the [[Antarctic Treaty]], of which Chile is a signatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Antarctic Treaty: Information about the Antarctic Treaty and how Antarctica is governed. | work = Polar Conservation Organisation | publisher = Polar Conservation Organisation | date = February 1, 2008 | url = http://www.polarconservation.org/education/plonearticle.2005-12-28.3597747204/ | doi = | accessdate = 11 march 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chile controls Easter Island and [[Sala y Gómez]] Island, the easternmost islands of Polynesia, which it incorporated to its territory in 1888, and [[Robinson Crusoe Island]], more than {{convert|600|km}} from the mainland, in the [[Juan Fernández Islands]]. [[Easter Island]] is today a province of Chile. Also controlled but only temporarily inhabited (by some local fishermen) are the small islands of Sala y Gómez, San Ambrosio and San Felix. These islands are notable because they extend Chile's claim to territorial waters out from its coast into the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Vergara Blanco | first = Alejandro | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Derecho d
