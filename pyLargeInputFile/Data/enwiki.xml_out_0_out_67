===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Chile}}The climate of Chile comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large geographic scale, extending across 38 degrees in latitude, making generalisations difficult. According to the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]], Chile within its borders hosts at least seven major climatic subtypes, ranging from [[desert]] in the north, to [[alpine tundra]] and glaciers in the east and south east, [[humid subtropical]] in Easter Island, [[oceanic climate|Oceanic]] in the south and Mediterranean climate in central Chile. There are four seasons in most of the country: summer (December to February), autumn (March to May), winter (June to August), and spring (September to November).

===Flora and fauna===
{{main|Wildlife of Chile}}
[[File:BeagleChannelGlacier.jpg|thumb|left|A glacier at [[Beagle Channel]] in southern Chile]]
[[File:Sephanoides fernandensis.jpg|thumb|[[Juan Fernández Firecrown]]]]
Chile's botanical zones conform to the topographic and climatic regions. The northernmost coastal and central region is largely barren of vegetation, approaching the most closely an absolute desert in the world.&lt;ref name=Icarito&gt;{{Cite journal | author-link = La Tercera/Icarito | author2-link = | title = Icarito: Enciclopedia de la flora y fauna de Chile | journal = Icarito |url=http://www.icarito.cl/icarito/enciclopedia/canal/canal/0,0,38035857_152308989,00.html | doi = | id = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the slopes of the Andes, besides the scattered tola desert brush, grasses are found. The central valley is characterized by several species of cactus, the hard espinos, the Chilean pine, and the [[Copihue]], a red bell-shaped flower that is Chile's national flower.&lt;ref name= Icarito /&gt;

In southern Chile, south of the Biobío River, the heavy precipitation has produced dense forests of laurels, magnolias, and various species of conifers and beeches, which become smaller and more stunted to the south.
&lt;ref name=Bio&amp;Con&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Smith-Ramírez | first = Cecilia | title = Distribution patterns of flora and fauna in southern Chilean Coastal rain forests: Integrating Natural History and GIS | journal = Biodiversity and Conservation | issue = Volume 16, Number 9 / August, 2007 | publisher = Springer Netherlands | date = Friday, October 27, 2006 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/73521g0852w08858/fulltext.pdf | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The cold temperatures and winds of the extreme south preclude heavy forestation. Grassland is found in Atlantic Chile (in Patagonia). Much of the Chilean flora is distinct from that of neighboring Argentina, indicating that the Andean barrier existed during its formation.&lt;ref name=Bio&amp;Con /&gt; Chilean species include the [[araucaria araucana|monkey-puzzle tree]], part of the pine-like ''[[Araucaria]]'' genus centered in [[New Caledonia]], and [[nothofagus|southern beech]]es.

Chile's geographical isolation also has restricted the immigration of faunal life, so that only a few of the many distinctive Latin American animals are found. Among the larger mammals are the [[Cougar|puma]] or cougar, the llama-like [[Guanaco]] and the fox-like [[South American Gray Fox|chilla]]. In the forest region, several types of marsupials and a small deer known as the [[Pudú|pudu]] are found.&lt;ref name= Icarito /&gt;
There are many species of small birds, but most of the larger common Latin American types are absent. Few freshwater fish are native, but North American trout have been successfully introduced into the Andean lakes.&lt;ref name= Icarito /&gt; Owing to the vicinity of the Humboldt Current, ocean waters abound with fish and other forms of marine life, which in turn support a rich variety of waterfowl, including different penguins. Whales are abundant, and some six species of seals are found in the area.&lt;ref name= Icarito /&gt;

Chile is one of South America's most stable and prosperous nations,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-Chile&quot;/&gt; leading Latin American nations in [[human development (humanity)|human development]], competitiveness, income per capita, globalization, economic freedom, and low perception of corruption.&lt;ref name=&quot;hdrstats.undp.org&quot;/&gt; However, it has a high [[economic inequality]], as measured by the [[Gini index]].&lt;ref name=&quot;casen&quot;/&gt; In May 2010 Chile became the first South American country to join the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OECD_20100507&quot;/&gt; In 2006, Chile became the country with the highest nominal GDP per capita in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weforum.org/pdf/GCR09/GCR20092010fullrankings.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to the last available data, it now ranks in a second place, after [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2011/01/weodata/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1990s, Chile's reputation as a role model for economic reform was strengthened when the democratic government of [[Patricio Aylwin]], who took over from the military in 1990, deepened the economic reform initiated by the military government. Growth in real GDP averaged 8% from 1991–1997,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} but fell to half that level in 1998 because of tight monetary policies (implemented to keep the current account deficit in check) and because of lower export earnings, the latter which was a product of the Asian financial crisis. Chile's economy has since recovered and has seen growth rates of 5-7% over the past several years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

After a decade of impressive growth rates, Chile began to experience a moderate economic downturn in 1999, brought on by unfavorable global economic conditions related to the [[Asian financial crisis]], which began in 1997. The economy remained sluggish until 2003, when it began to show clear signs of recovery, achieving 4.0% real GDP growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indexmundi.com/chile/gdp_real_growth_rate.html] Chile GDP – real growth rate&lt;/ref&gt; The Chilean economy finished 2004 with growth of 6.0%. Real GDP growth reached 5.7% in 2005 before falling back to 4.0% in 2006. GDP expanded by 5.1% in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

Unemployment hovered at 8%-10% after the start of the economic slowdown in 1999, above the 7% average for the 1990s. Unemployment finally dipped to 7.8% in 2006, and continued to fall in 2007, averaging 6.8% monthly (up to August).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://si2.bcentral.cl/Basededatoseconomicos/951_417.asp?m=EMP03&amp;f=M&amp;i=E|title=Chilean Central Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wages have risen faster than inflation as a result of higher productivity, boosting national [[standard of living|living standards]]. The percentage of Chileans with household incomes below the [[poverty line]] – defined as twice the cost of satisfying a person's minimal nutritional needs – fell from 45.1% in 1987 to 13.7% in 2006, according to government surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trabajoyequidad.cl/documentos/temp/TP-825-CASEN%202006%20en%20profundidad-22-06-2007.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071025021053/http://www.trabajoyequidad.cl/documentos/temp/TP-825-CASEN+2006+en+profundidad-22-06-2007.pdf|archivedate=2007-10-25|work=Libertad y Desarrollo|title=Casen 2006 en profundidad|accessdate=2007-10-22|date=2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics in Chile, however, argue that true poverty figures are considerably higher than those officially published. (The government constructs the poverty line based on an outdated 1987 household consumption survey, instead of more recent surveys from 1997 or 2007). According to these critics who use data from the 1997 survey, the poverty rate rises to 29%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economiaynegocios.cl/noticias/noticias.asp?id=35048|publisher=El Mercurio|title=Una muy necesaria corrección: Hay cuatro millones de pobres en Chile|date=2007-10-14|accessdate=2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the relative yardstick favoured in many European countries, 27% of Chileans would be poor, according to Juan Carlos Feres of the [[ECLAC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=The Economist|title=Destitute no more|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9645174|accessdate=2007-10-22|date=2007-08-16}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High domestic savings and investment rates helped propel Chile's economy to average growth rates of 8% during the 1990s. [[Chile pension system|The privatized national pension system]] (AFP) has encouraged domestic investment and contributed to an estimated total domestic savings rate of approximately 21% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safp.cl/573/articles-3523_copyright.pdf] The Chilean pension system&lt;/ref&gt;

Total [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) was only $3.4 billion in 2006, up 52% from a poor performance in 2005. However, 80% of FDI continues to go to only four sectors: electricity, gas, water and mining. Much of the jump in FDI in 2006 was also the result of acquisitions and mergers, but has done little to create new employment in Chile.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Economic policies===
[[File:GDP per capita LA-Chile.png|thumb|350px|Chilean (blue) and average [[Latin America]]n (orange) [[GDP per capita]] (1950-2007).]]
Sound economic policies, maintained consistently since the 1980s, have contributed to steady economic growth in Chile and have more than halved poverty rates.&lt;ref name=factbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt; The 1973-90 military government sold many state-owned companies, and the three democratic governments since 1990 have continued privatization, though at a slower pace. The government's role in the economy is mostly limited to regulation, although the state continues to operate copper giant CODELCO and a few other enterprises (there is one state-run bank). Chile is strongly committed to free trade and has welcomed large amounts of foreign investment. Chile has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with a whole network of countries, including an FTA with the United States that was signed in 2003 and implemented in January 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ustr.gov/Trade_Agreements/Bilateral/Chile_FTA/Final_Texts/Section_Index.html] USA-Chile FTA Final Text&lt;/ref&gt;

Chile's independent [[Central Bank]] pursues an inflation target of between 2% and 4%. Inflation has not exceeded 5% since 1998. Chile registered an inflation rate of 3.2% in 2006. The Chilean peso's rapid appreciation against the U.S. dollar in recent years has helped dampen inflation. Most wage settlements and loans are indexed, reducing inflation's volatility. Under the compulsory private pension system, most formal sector employees pay 10% of their salaries into privately managed funds.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

As of 2006, Chile invested only 0.6% of its annual GDP in research and development (R&amp;D). Even then, two-thirds of that was government spending. Beyond its general economic and political stability, the government has also encouraged the use of Chile as an &quot;investment platform&quot; for multinational corporations planning to operate in the region, but this will have limited value given the developing business climate in Chile itself.{{Specify|date=February 2011}} Chile's approach to foreign direct investment is codified in the country's Foreign Investment Law, which gives foreign investors the same treatment as Chileans. Registration is reported to be simple and transparent, and foreign investors are guaranteed access to the official foreign exchange market to repatriate their profits and capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

Faced with an [[2008 financial crisis|international economic downturn]] the government announced a $4 billion economic stimulus plan to spur employment and growth, and despite the global financial crisis, aimed for an expansion of between 2 percent and 3 percent of GDP for 2009. Nonetheless, economic analysts disagreed with government estimates and predicted economic growth at a median of 1.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/economicNews/idUSN1027661220090110 |title=Chile finmin says no recession seen in 2009-report |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-01-10 |accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the CIA World FactBook, the GDP contracted an estimated -1.7% in 2009.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The Chilean Government has formed a Council on Innovation and Competition, which is tasked with identifying new sectors and industries to promote. It is hoped that this, combined with some tax reforms to encourage domestic and foreign investment in [[research and development]], will bring in additional FDI to new parts of the economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

Chile maintains one of the best credit ratings (S&amp;P A+) in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Americas/Chile-OVERVIEW-OF-ECONOMY.html] Chile: Overview of economy&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main ways for Chilean firms to raise funds abroad: bank loans, issuance of bonds, and the selling of stocks on U.S. markets through American Depository Receipts (ADRs). Nearly all of the funds raised through these means go to finance domestic Chilean investment. The government is required by law to run a fiscal surplus of at least 1% of GDP. In 2006, the Government of Chile ran a surplus of $11.3 billion, equal to almost 8% of GDP. The Government of Chile continues to pay down its foreign debt, with public debt only 3.9% of GDP at the end of 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

===Foreign trade===
[[File:Chuqui001.jpg|thumb|Chile produces more than a third of the world's copper]]
2006 was a record year for Chilean trade. Total trade registered a 31% increase over 2005. During 2006, exports of goods and services totaled US $58 billion, an increase of 41%. This figure was somewhat distorted by the skyrocketing price of copper. In 2006, copper exports reached a historical high of US $33.3 billion. Imports totaled US $35 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the previous year. Chile thus recorded a positive trade balance of US $23 billion in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

The main destinations for Chilean exports were the Americas (US $39 billion), Asia (US $27.8 billion) and Europe (US $22.2 billion). Seen as shares of Chile's export markets, 42% of exports went to the Americas, 30% to Asia and 24% to Europe. Within Chile's diversified network of trade relationships, its most important partner remained the United States. Total trade with the U.S. was US $14.8 billion in 2006. Since the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement went into effect on January 1, 2004, U.S.-Chilean trade has increased by 154%. Internal Government of Chile figures show that even when factoring out inflation and the recent high price of copper, bilateral trade between the U.S. and Chile has grown over 60% since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

Total trade with Europe also grew in 2006, expanding by 42%. The Netherlands and Italy were Chile's main European trading partners. Total trade with Asia also grew significantly at nearly 31%. Trade with Korea and Japan grew significantly, but China remained Chile's most important trading partner in Asia. Chile's total trade with China reached U.S. $8.8 billion in 2006, representing nearly 66% of the value of its trade relationship with Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Antiguas reservas wine.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Chile is the world's fifth largest [[Wine#Exporting countries|exporter of wine]] and the [[Wine#Production|eighth largest producer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2010/06/25/chile-ranks-fifth-globally-in-wine-exports-and-eighth-in-production|title=Chile ranks fifth globally in wine exports and eighth in production|work=[[Santiago Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The growth of exports in 2006 was mainly caused by a strong increase in sales to the United States, the Netherlands, and Japan. These three markets alone accounted for an additional US $5.5 billion worth of Chilean exports. Chilean exports to the United States totaled US $9.3 billion, representing a 37.7% increase compared to 2005 (US $6.7 billion). Exports to the European Union were US $15.4 billion, a 63.7% increased compared to 2005 (US $9.4 billion). Exports to Asia increased from US $15.2 billion in 2005 to US $19.7 billion in 2006, a 29.9% increase.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

During 2006, Chile imported US $26 billion from the Americas, representing 54% of total imports, followed by Asia at 22%, and Europe at 16%. Mercosur members were the main suppliers of imports to Chile at US $9.1 billion, followed by the United States with US $5.5 billion and the European Union with US $5.2 billion. From Asia, China was the most important exporter to Chile, with goods valued at US $3.6 billion. Year-on-year growth in imports was especially strong from a number of countries-Ecuador (123.9%), Thailand (72.1%), Korea (52.6%), and China (36.9%).&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

Chile's overall trade profile has traditionally been dependent upon copper exports. The state-owned firm CODELCO is the world's largest copper-producing company, with recorded copper reserves of 200 years. Chile has made an effort to expand nontraditional exports. The most important non-mineral exports are forestry and wood products, fresh fruit and processed food, fishmeal and seafood, and [[Chilean wine|wine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

===Trade agreements===
Over the last several years, Chile has signed [[free trade agreement]]s (FTA's) with the European Union, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, China, and Japan. It reached a partial trade agreement with India in 2005 and began negotiations for a full-fledged FTA with India in 2006. Chile conducted trade negotiations in 2007 with Australia, Malaysia, and Thailand, as well as with China to expand an existing agreement beyond just trade in goods. Chile concluded FTA negotiations with Australia and an expanded agreement with China in 2008. The members of the P4 (Chile, Singapore, New Zealand, and Brunei) also plan to conclude a chapter on finance and investment in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

Successive Chilean governments have actively pursued trade-liberalizing agreements. During the 1990s, Chile signed free trade agreements FTA with Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Chile also concluded preferential trade agreements with Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. An association agreement with Mercosur-Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay-went into effect in October 1996. Continuing its export-oriented development strategy, Chile completed landmark free trade agreements in 2002 with the European Union and South Korea. Chile, as a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) organization, is seeking to boost commercial ties to Asian markets. To that end, it has signed trade agreements in recent years with New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, India, China, and most recently Japan. In 2007, Chile held trade negotiations with Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, and China. In 2008, Chile hopes to conclude an FTA with Australia, and finalize an expanded agreement (covering trade in services and investment) with China. The P4 (Chile, Singapore, New Zealand, and Brunei) also plan to expand ties through adding a finance and investment chapter to the existing P4 agreement. Chile's trade talks with Malaysia and Thailand are also scheduled to continue in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Paseomu1.jpg|thumb|right|The port of [[San Antonio, Chile|San Antonio]]]]

After two years of negotiations, the United States and Chile signed an agreement in June 2003 that will lead to completely duty-free bilateral trade within 12 years. The U.S.-Chile FTA entered into force January 1, 2004, following approval by the U.S. and Chilean congresses. The bilateral FTA has inaugurated greatly expanded U.S.-Chilean trade ties, with total bilateral trade jumping by 154% during the FTA's first three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

Chile unilaterally lowered its across-the-board import tariff for all countries with which it does not have a trade agreement to 6% in 2003. Higher effective tariffs are charged only on imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar as a result of a system of import price bands. The price bands were ruled inconsistent with Chile's [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) obligations in 2002, and the government has introduced legislation to modify them. Under the terms of the U.S.-Chile FTA, the price bands will be completely phased out for U.S. imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar within 12 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

Chile is a strong proponent of pressing ahead on negotiations for a [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA) and is active in the WTO's [[Doha Development Round|Doha round of negotiations]], principally through its membership in the [[G20 developing nations|G-20]] and [[Cairns Group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

===Finance===
[[File:Sanhatan.jpg|thumb|[[Sanhattan]] Skyline of Santiago's Financial District]]
Chile's financial sector has grown quickly in recent years, with a banking reform law approved in 1997 that broadened the scope of permissible foreign activity for Chilean banks. The Chilean Government implemented a further liberalization of capital markets in 2001, and there is further pending legislation proposing further liberalization. Over the last ten years, Chileans have enjoyed the introduction of new financial tools such as home equity loans, currency futures and options, factoring, leasing, and debit cards. The introduction of these new products has also been accompanied by an increased use of traditional instruments such as loans and credit cards. Chile's private pension system, with assets worth roughly $70 billion at the end of 2006, has been an important source of investment capital for the capital market. However, by 2009, it has been reported that $21 billion had been lost from the pension system to the global financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/chile/090121/uncertain-future |title=An uncertain future |publisher=GlobalPost |date= |accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
{{Main|Tourism in Chile}}
[[File:Moai Rano raraku.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Easter Island]]]]
[[Tourism]] in Chile has experienced sustained growth over the last few decades. In 2005, tourism grew by 13.6%, generating more than 4.5 billion dollars of which 1.5 billion is attributed to foreign tourists. According to the National Service of Tourism (Sernatur), 2 million people a year visit the country. Most of these visitors come from other countries in the American continent, mainly [[Argentina]]; followed by a growing number from the [[United States]], [[Europe]], and [[Brazil]] with a growing number of Asians from [[South Korea]] and [[PR China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rides.cl/pdf/trade_tourism_chile.pdf|title=Unknown}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main attractions for tourists are places of natural beauty situated in the extreme zones of the country: [[San Pedro de Atacama]], in the north, is very popular with foreign tourists who arrive to admire the Incaic architecture, the altiplano lakes, and the [[Valle de la Luna (Chile)|Valley of the Moon]]. In [[Putre]], also in the North, there is the [[Chungará Lake]], as well as the [[Parinacota Volcano|Parinacota]] and the [[Pomerape]] volcanoes, with altitudes of 6,348 m and 6,282 m, respectively. Throughout the central Andes there are many ski resorts of international repute, including [[Portillo, Chile|Portillo]], [[Valle Nevado]] and [[Termas de Chillán]]. The main tourist sites in the south are the coastal area around Tirúa and Cañete with the [[Isla Mocha]] and the [[Nahuelbuta National Park]], [[Chiloé Archipelago]] and [[Patagonia]], which includes [[Laguna San Rafael National Park]], with its many glaciers, and the [[Torres del Paine National Park]]. The central port city of [[Valparaíso]], which is World Heritage with its unique architecture, is also popular. Finally, Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean is one of the main Chilean tourist destinations.

For locals, tourism is concentrated mostly in the summer (December to March), and mainly in the coastal beach towns. [[Arica]], [[Iquique]], [[Antofagasta]], [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]] and [[Coquimbo]] are the main summer centres in the north, and Pucón on the shores of [[Lake Villarrica]] is the main centre in the south. Because of its proximity to Santiago, the coast of the Valparaíso Region, with its many beach resorts, receives the largest number of tourists. [[Viña del Mar]], Valparaíso's northern affluent neighbor, is popular because of its beaches, [[casino]], and its annual [[Viña del Mar International Song Festival|song festival]], the most important musical event in Latin America. [[Pichilemu]] in the [[O'Higgins Region]] is widely known as South America's &quot;best [[surfing]] spot,&quot; according to [[Fodor's]].

In November 2005, the government launched a campaign under the brand &quot;Chile: All Ways Surprising,&quot; intended to promote the country internationally for both business and tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prochile.us/|title=Unknown|work=ProChile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Chile}}
[[File:Chile-demography.png|thumb|300px|Population of Chile from 1820, projected up to 2050]]

Chile's 2002 census reported a population of 15,116,435 people. Its rate of population growth has been decreasing since 1990, because of a declining [[birth rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.cl/canales/chile_estadistico/demografia_y_vitales/estadisticas_vitales/pdf/anuarios/vitales2003.zip|title=Anuario Estadísticas Vitales 2003|publisher=Instituto National de Estadísticas}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2050 the population is expected to reach approximately 20.2 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.cl/canales/chile_estadistico/demografia_y_vitales/proyecciones/Informes/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20InforP_T.pdf|title=Chile: Proyecciones y Estimaciones de Población. Total País 1950-2050|publisher=Instituto National de Estadísticas}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 85% of the country's population lives in urban areas, with 40% living in [[Santiago, Chile|Greater Santiago]]. The largest [[agglomeration]]s according to the 2002 census are Greater Santiago with 5.6 million people, [[Greater Concepción]] with 861,000
and [[Greater Valparaíso]] with 824,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observatoriourbano.cl/indurb/pre_ciudades.asp?id_user=0&amp;idComCiu=0|title=List of Chilean cities|publisher=Observatorio Urbano, Ministerio de Vivienda y Urbanismo de Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chile is a [[multiethnic society]], which means that it is home to people of many different ethnical backgrounds. As a result, the people there usually treat their nationality as a citizenship, but not an ethnicity.

One study conducted by Francisco Lizcano from [[UNAM]] suggested that people of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] origin made up 52.7% of the population and that [[Mestizo|Mestizos]] made up 44% of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lizcano&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=LcabJ98-t1wC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=chile+60%25+blancos+Esteva-Fabregat|title=Composición Étnica de las Tres Áreas Culturales del Continente Americano al Comienzo del Siglo XXI|isbn=9789707570528|author1=Fernández, Francisco Lizcano|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by the [[University of Chile]] found that within the Chilean population, 30% are of European descent and Mestizos with [[Castizo|majority European]] ancestry are estimated to be 65% of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;UC&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=5.2.6.

The European portion of Chile's population consists mainly of people descended from [[Spanish Chilean|Spanish]] settlers (predominantly [[Castilian people|Castilian]], [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]] and [[Basque people|Basque]]), with minorities having [[German Chilean|German]], [[Italian Chilean|Italian]], [[Irish Chilean|Irish]], [[French Chilean|French]], [[British Chilean|British]], [[Swiss Chilean|Swiss]], and [[Croatian Chilean|Croatian]] ancestry, singly or combined. The Mestizo segment, in this respect, would derive its European component from colonial Spanish settlers (mainly [[Andalusians]] and [[Castilian people|Castilians]]), while its Amerindian component would be from various tribes or groups, mainly Picunches and [[Mapuches]].

The [[Afro-Chilean]] population has always been tiny, reaching a high of 2,500 people during the colonial period; their current percentage of the population is less than one percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mazinger.sisib.uchile.cl/repositorio/lb/ciencias_quimicas_y_farmaceuticas/medinae/|title=Elementos de Salud Pública, section 5.2.6|publisher=University of Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2002 Census, 4.6% of the Chilean population considered themselves indigenous.&lt;ref name=&quot;medwave&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medwave.cl/ciencia/11.act |title=El gradiente sociogenético chileno y sus implicaciones ético-sociales |publisher=Medwave.cl |date=2000-06-15 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous communities===

[[File:Mapuches en Tirua.jpg|thumb|Mapuches on horseback.]]

The 1907 census reported 101,118 Indians, or 3.1% of the total country population. Only those that practiced their native culture or spoke their native language were considered, irrespective of their &quot;racial purity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl//temas/documento_detalle.asp?id=MC0007943 |title=1907 census |publisher=Memoriachilena.cl |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2002 census, only indigenous people that still practiced a native culture or spoke a native language were surveyed, and 4.6% of the population (692,192 people) fit that description. Of that 4.6%, 87.3% declared themselves Mapuche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.cl/cd2002/sintesiscensal.pdf|title=Censo 2002 – Síntesis de Resultados|work=Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the indigenous population show varying degrees of mixed ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;medwave&quot;/&gt;

Chile is one of 22 countries to have signed and ratified the only binding international law concerning indigenous peoples, [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/ratifce.pl?C169 |title=ILOLEX: submits English query |publisher=Ilo.org |date=2004-01-09 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted in 1989 as the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) Convention 169. Chile ratified it in 2008. A Chilean court decision in November 2009, considered to be a landmark ruling in indigenous rights concerns, made use of the convention. The Supreme Court decision on Aymara water rights upheld rulings by both the Pozo Almonte tribunal and the Iquique Court of Appeals, and marks the first judicial application of ILO Convention 169 in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santiagotimes.cl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17739:chiles-supreme-court-upholds-indigenous-water-use-rights&amp;catid=19:other&amp;Itemid=142 |title=Chile’s Supreme Court Upholds Indigenous Water Use Rights |publisher=The Santiago Times |date=2009-11-30 |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration===
{{Main|Immigration to Chile}}

[[File:Puerto varas church.jpg|thumb|A German influenced [[Puerto Varas]] Church]]
An important number of non-Spanish immigrants have arrived in Chile from various countries and regions, including [[Italian Chilean|Italy]], [[Irish people|Ireland]], [[French People|France]], [[Greeks in Chile|Greece]], [[German People|Germany]], [[English people|England]], [[Dutch Chilean|the Netherlands]], [[Scottish Chilean|Scotland]], [[Croatian Chilean|Croatia]], and the [[Middle East]]. The largest contingent of people to arrive in Chile came from [[Spain]], mainly the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque country]], beginning in the 16th century. Estimates of the number of people in Chile who can trace descent from [[Basques]] range from 10% (1,600,000) to as high as 27% (4,500,000).&lt;ref name=&quot;Diariovasco&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Mikel Soro|url=http://www.diariovasco.com/pg060724/prensa/noticias/AlDia/200607/24/DVA-ALD-003.html |title=Diariovasco |publisher=Diariovasco. |date=1997-12-01 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;deia.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deia.com/es/impresa/2008/05/22/bizkaia/ekonomia/469496.php |title=entrevista al Presidente de la Cámara vasca |publisher=Deia.com |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German immigrants have made a cultural impact in many areas of [[southern Chile]], which is a sparsely populated region. The [[Consulate]] of [[Demographics of Chile|Chile]] in [[Germany]] estimates that 500,000 to 600,000 Chileans, or between 3% to 3.5% of the population today, are descended from [[German diaspora|German immigrants]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.embajadaconsuladoschile.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=60&amp;lang=de |title=German Embassy in Chile |publisher=Embajadaconsuladoschile.de |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them were located in the [[Los Ríos Region]].

Descendants of different [[ethnic groups in Europe|European ethnic groups]] often intermarried in Chile, diluting the cultures and separate identities of the home countries and fusing them together with the descendants of the original ''Basque-Castilian'' aristocracy of the [[colonial period]], while at the same time preserving some separate aspects. This intermarriage and mixture of cultures and races has help shape the present society and culture of the Chilean middle and upper classes,&lt;ref name=&quot;deia.com&quot; /&gt; who now enjoy varied elements of their original European cultures, such as [[British Chilean|British]] afternoon tea, [[German Chilean|German]] cakes, and [[Italian Chilean|Italian]] pasta. The fusion is also visible in the architecture of Chilean cities. These classes do, however, frequently deprecate Chilean folk culture, an offshoot of the culture of the [[Spaniards]] who settled the country in the colonial period.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

The Constitution provides for [[freedom of religion]], and other laws and policies contribute to the generally free practice of religion. The law at all levels protects this right in full against abuse, either by governmental or private actors.&lt;ref name=&quot;religiousfreedomreport&quot;/&gt;

Church and state are officially [[separation of church and state|separate]] in Chile. The 1999 law on religion prohibits [[religious discrimination]].

===Languages===
The [[Chilean Spanish|Spanish spoken in Chile]] is distinctively accented and quite unlike that of neighbouring South American countries because final syllables and &quot;''s''&quot; sounds are dropped, and some consonants have a soft pronunciation. Accent varies only very slightly from north to south; more noticeable are the small differences in accent based on social class or whether one lives in the city or the country. That the Chilean population was largely formed in a small section at the center of the country and then migrated in modest numbers to the north and south helps explain this relative lack of differentiation, which was maintained by the national reach of radio, and now television, which also helps to diffuse and homogenize colloquial expressions.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

There are several indigenous languages spoken in Chile: [[Mapudungun]], [[Chilean Quechua|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Rapa Nui language|Rapa Nui]]. After the Spanish invasion, Spanish took over as the [[lingua franca]] and the indigenous languages have become minority languages, with some now extinct or close to extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CL|title=Languages of Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[German language|German]] is still spoken to some extent in southern Chile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oliver Zoellner |url=http://www.research-worldwide.de/article-chile2005.html |title=Oliver Zoellner &amp;#124; Generating Samples of Ethnic Minorities in Chile |publisher=Research-worldwide.de |date= |accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; either in small country side pockets or as a second language among the communities of larger cities.

Through initiatives such as the [[English Opens Doors]] program, the government made English mandatory for students in fifth-grade and above in public schools. Most private schools in Chile start teaching English from kindergarten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/chile/090908/lack-english-proficiency |title=Repeat after me: Hello, my name is |publisher=Globalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common English words have been absorbed and appropriated into everyday Spanish speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-04622005000200010&amp;script=sci_arttext |title=Anglicism in Chilean Spanish |publisher=Scielo.cl |date=2004-05-04 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period between early agricultural settlements and to the late pre-Hispanic period, northern Chile was a region of Andean culture that was influenced by altiplano traditions spreading to the coastal valleys of the north. While southern regions were areas of Mapuche cultural activities. Through the colonial period following the conquest, and during the early Republican period, the country's culture was dominated by the Spanish. Other European influences, primarily [[British people|English]], [[French people|French]], and [[German people|German]] began in the 19th century and have continued to this day. German migrants influenced the Bavarian style rural architecture and cuisine in the south of Chile in cities such as [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]], [[Frutillar]], [[Puerto Varas]], [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]], [[Temuco]], [[Puerto Octay]], [[Llanquihue Province|Llanquihue]], [[Faja Maisan]], [[Pitrufquén]], [[Victoria, Chile|Victoria]], [[Pucón]] and [[Puerto Montt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allsouthernchile.com/southamerica/valdivia-southern-chile-city-guide/index.html|title=Valdivia, Chile Living Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaladrenaline.com/latinamerica/chile/|title=Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learnapec.org/index.cfm?action=exploration&amp;cou_id=4|title=Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-studies.com/chile/foreign-relations.html|title=Foreign Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodbycountry.com/Algeria-to-France/Chile.html|title=Food in Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music and dance===
Music in Chile ranges from folkloric music, popular music and also to classical music. Its large geography generates different musical expressions in the north, center and south of the country, including also Easter Island and Mapuche music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/index.asp?id_ut=elfolclordechileysustresgrandesraices |title=Memoria Chilena |publisher=Memoriachilena.cl |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national dance is the [[cueca]]. Another form of traditional Chilean song, though not a dance, is the tonada. Arising from music imported by the Spanish colonists, it is distinguished from the cueca by an intermediate melodic section and a more prominent melody.

Between 1950 and 1970 appears a rebirth in folk music leading by groups such as [[Los de Ramon]], Los Cuatro Cuartos and Los Huasos Quincheros, among others &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicapopular.cl/2.0/index2.php?op=Artista&amp;id=444 |title=Conjuntos Folkloricos de Chile |publisher=Musicapopular.cl |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; with composers such as [[Raul de Ramon]], [[Violeta Parra]] and others. In the mid-1960s native musical forms were revitalized by the [[Parra family]] with the [[Nueva Canción|Nueva Canción Chilena]], which was associated with political activists and reformers such as [[Victor Jara]] and [[Inti-Illimani]]. Other important [[folk music|folk]] singer and [[researcher]] on [[folklore]] and Chilean [[ethnography]], is [[Margot Loyola]]. Also many Chilean Rock bands like [[Los Jaivas]], [[Los Prisioneros]], [[La Ley (band)|La Ley]], and [[Los Tres]] have reached international success.

===Literature===
Chileans call their country ''país de poetas''-country of poets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protocolo.com.mx/articulos.php?id_sec=2&amp;id_art=600 ]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uchile.cl/cultura/poetasjovenes/bianchi26.htm |title=UN MAPA POR COMPLETAR: LA JOVEN POESIA CHILENA – żPor qué tanta y tan variada poesía? |publisher=Uchile.cl |date= |accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gabriela Mistral]] was the first Chilean to win a [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] (1945). Chile's most famous poet, however, is [[Pablo Neruda]], who also won the Nobel Prize for Literature (1971) and is world-renowned for his extensive library of works on romance, nature, and politics. His three highly personalized homes, located in [[Isla Negra]], Santiago and Valparaíso are popular tourist destinations.

Among the list of other Chilean poets are [[Carlos Pezoa Véliz]], [[Vicente Huidobro]], [[Gonzalo Rojas]], and [[Nicanor Parra]]. [[Isabel Allende]] is the best-selling Chilean novelist, with 51 millions of her novels sold worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=346023&amp;CategoryId=13003 |title=Latin American Herald Tribune - Isabel Allende Named to Council of Cervantes Institute |publisher=Laht.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist [[José Donoso|José Donoso's]] novel '[[The Obscene Bird of the Night]]' is considered by critic [[Harold Bloom]] to be one of the canonical works of 20th century Western literature. Another internationally recognized Chilean novelist is [[Roberto Bolaño]] whose translations into English have had an excellent reception from the critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1857951,00.html | work=Time | date=2008-11-10 | accessdate=2010-04-28 | first=Lev | last=Grossman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarah Kerr |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22171 |title=The Triumph of Roberto Bolaño &amp;#124; The New York Review of Books |publisher=Nybooks.com |date=2008-12-18 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/books/review/Wood.t.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Visceral Realist | first=James | last=Wood | date=2007-04-15 | accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
[[File:Chilean Cazuela.JPG|thumb|Chilean [[Cazuela]] and assorted salads.]][[Chilean cuisine]] is a reflection of the country's topographical variety, featuring an assortment of seafood, beef, fruits, and vegetables. Traditional recipes include [[asado]], [[cazuela]], [[empanada]]s, [[humita]]s, pastel de choclo, pastel de papas, [[curanto]] and [[sopaipilla#Chile|sopaipillas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=LlePAePLlqkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+south+american+table] The South American Table by Maria Baez Kijac&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crudos]] is an example of the mixture of culinary contributions from the various ethnic influences in Chile. The raw minced llama, heavy use of shellfish and rice bread were taken from native [[Quechuas|Quechua]] Andean cuisine, (although now beef brought to Chile by Europeans is also used in place of the llama meat), lemon and onions were brought by the [[Spain|Spanish]] colonists, and the use of mayonnaise and yogurt was introduced by [[Germans|German]] immigrants, as was beer.

===Sports===
{{Dablink|Main article: [[Sport in Chile]]}}
[[File:Estadio Nacional de Chile 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Estadio Nacional de Chile]]]]

Chile's most popular sport is [[association football]] (''fútbol''). Chile has appeared in eight FIFA World Cups which includes hosting the [[1962 FIFA World Cup]] where the [[Chile national football team|national football team]] finished third. Other results achieved by the national football team include four finals at the [[Copa América]], one silver and two bronze medals at the [[Pan American Games]], a bronze medal at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] and two third places finishes in the FIFA under-17 and under-20 youth tournaments. The main football clubs are [[Colo-Colo]], [[Club de Fútbol Universidad de Chile|Universidad de Chile]] and [[Club Deportivo Universidad Católica|Universidad Católica]]. Colo-Colo is the country's most successful football club, having both the most national and international championships, including the coveted [[Copa Libertadores]] South American club tournament. [[Club Deportivo Universidad Católica|Universidad Católica]] was the last international champion ([[Interamerican Cup]] 1994).
[[File:Rodeochileno1.jpg|thumb|[[Chilean rodeo]] is unique to Chile]]

[[Tennis]] is Chile's most successful sport. Its [[Chile Davis Cup team|national team]] won the [[World Team Cup]] clay tournament twice (2003 &amp; 2004), and played the [[Davis Cup]] final against [[Italy]] in 1976. At the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] the country captured gold and bronze in men's singles and gold in men's doubles. [[Marcelo Ríos]] became the first Latin American man to reach the number one spot in the [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|ATP singles rankings]] in 1998. [[Anita Lizana]] won the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in 1937, becoming the first woman from Latin America to win a [[grand slam (tennis)|grand slam]] tournament. [[Luis Ayala (tennis)|Luis Ayala]] was twice a runner-up at the [[French Open]] and both Ríos and [[Fernando González]] reached the [[Australian Open]] men's singles finals. González also won a silver medal in singles at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]].

At the [[Olympic Games]] Chile boasts two gold medals (tennis), seven silver medals ([[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Equestrian]], [[boxing]], [[shooting]] and tennis) and four bronze medals (tennis, boxing and football). [[Chilean rodeo|Rodeo]] is the country's [[national sport]] and is practiced in the more rural areas of the country. A sport similar to [[hockey]] called ''[[chueca]]'' was played by the Mapuche people during the Spanish conquest. [[Skiing]] and [[snowboarding]] are practiced at ski centers located in the Central Andes, and in southern ski centers near to cities as Osorno, Puerto Varas, Temuco and Punta Arenas. While [[Surfing in Chile|Surfing]] is popular at some coastal towns. [[Polo]] is professionally practiced within Chile and in 2008 Chile achieved top prize in the [[World Polo Championship]] a tournament where the country has earned both second and third places medals in previous editions. [[Basketball]] is a popular sport in which Chile has earned a bronze medal in the first men's [[FIBA World Championship]] held in 1950 and winning a second bronze medal when Chile hosted the [[1959 FIBA World Championship]]. Chile hosted the first [[FIBA World Championship for Women]] in 1953 finishing the tournament with the silver medal. Other sports such as marathons and ultramarathons are also increasing in popularity. [[San Pedro de Atacama]] is host to the annual &quot;Atacama Crossing,&quot; a six-stage, 250-kilometer footrace which annually attracts about 150 competitors from 35 countries. The [[Dakar Rally]] [[Off-road racing|off-road automobilie race]] has been held in both Chile and [[Argentina]] since 2009.

===National symbols===
[[File:Colca-condor-c03.jpg|thumb|The [[Andean Condor]] is the national bird of Chile]]
The national flower is the [[copihue]] (''Lapageria rosea'', Chilean [[bellflower]]), which grows in the woods of southern Chile.

The [[Coat of arms of Chile|coat of arms]] depicts the two national animals: the [[condor]] (''Vultur gryphus'', a very large bird that lives in the mountains) and the [[Hippocamelus|huemul]] (''Hippocamelus bisulcus,'' an endangered white tail deer). It also has the legend ''Por la razón o la fuerza'' (''By Reason or by Force'').

The [[flag of Chile]] consists of two equal horizontal bands of white (top) and red; there is a blue square the same height as the white band at the hoist-side end of the white band; the square bears a white five-pointed star in the center representing a guide to progress and honor; blue symbolizes the sky, white is for the snow-covered Andes, and red stands for the blood spilled to achieve independence. The flag of Chile is similar to the [[Flag of Texas]], although the Chilean flag is 21 years older. However, like the Texan flag, the flag of Chile is modeled after the [[Flag of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/flags/countrys/samerica/chile.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Health (Chile)|Ministry of Health]] (''Minsal'') is the cabinet-level administrative office in charge of planning, directing, coordinating, executing, controlling and informing the public health policies formulated by the President of Chile.

The [[Fondo Nacional de Salud|National Health Fund]] (''Fonasa''), created in 1979, is the financial entity entrusted to collect, manage and distribute state funds for health in Chile. It is funded by the public. All employees pay 7% of their monthly income to the fund.

Fonasa is part of the NHSS and has executive power through the [[Ministry of Health (Chile)]]. Its headquarters are in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] and decentralized public service is conducted by various Regional Offices.

More than 12 million beneficiaries benefit from Fonasa. Beneficiaries can also opt for more costly private insurance through [[Isapre]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{History of Chile}}
The territory of '''[[Chile]]''' has been populated since at least 12,000 BCE. By the 16th century, Spanish [[conquistador]]s began to subdue and colonize the region of present-day Chile, and the territory became a colony from 1540 to 1818, when it gained independence from [[Spain]]. The country's economic development was successively marked by the export of first agricultural produce, then [[sodium nitrate|saltpeter]] and later [[copper]] until the 1980s. The wealth of raw materials led to an economic upturn, but also led to dependency, and even wars with neighboring states. The country was governed during most of its first 150 years of independent life by different forms of restricted democracy, where the electorate was carefully vetted and controlled by an elite. Chile is a country who experienced genocide.

In 1990, Chile made a peaceful [[Chilean transition to democracy|transition to democracy]].

==Early history==
{{Main|Prehispanic history of Chile}}
About 12,000 years ago, migrating [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] settled in the fertile valleys and coastal areas of what is present day Chile. Pre-Hispanic Chile was home to over a dozen different Amerindian societies. The current prevalent theories are that the initial arrival of humans to the continent took place either along the Pacific coast southwards in a rather rapid expansion long preceding the [[Clovis culture]], or even trans-Pacific migration. These theories are backed by findings in the [[Monte Verde]] archaeological site, which predates the Clovis site by thousands of years. Specific early human settlement sites from the very early human habitation in Chile include the [[Cueva del Milodon]] and the [[Pali Aike Crater]]'s [[lava tube]].&lt;ref name=Hogan&gt;{{cite book |title=Pali Aike |last=Hogan |first=C. Michael |authorlink= |coauthors=Andy Burnham ed. |year=2008 |publisher=Megalithic Portal |location= |language= |isbn= |chapter= |page= |pages= |quote= |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tulor Settlement Chile.jpg|thumb|200px|&quot;Tulor&quot; settlement near [[San Pedro de Atacama]], a Pre-Columbian [[Atacameño]] culture.]]
Despite such diversity, it is possible to classify the indigenous people into three major cultural groups: the northern people, who developed rich handicrafts and were influenced by [[Cultural periods of Peru|pre-Incan cultures]]; the Araucanian culture, who inhabited the area between the river [[Choapa River|Choapa]] and the island of [[Chiloé Island|Chiloé]], and lived primarily off agriculture; and the Patagonian culture [[Patagonia]]  composed of various nomadic tribes, who supported themselves through fishing and hunting (and who in Pacific/Pacific Coast immigration scenario would be descended partly from the most ancient settlers).

No elaborate, centralized, sedentary civilization reigned supreme.&lt;ref name=Mapuches&gt;{{cite book |title= Historia del pueblo mapuche: (siglo XIX y XX)
 |last=Bengoa |first=Jose |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher= |location= |language= Spanish |isbn= 978-956-282-232-9|chapter= |page= |pages= |quote= |url= http://books.google.com/?id=k_E3aAiunm8C&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=Mapuche+y+su+forma+de+gobierno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Araucanians, a fragmented society of hunters, gatherers, and farmers, constituted the largest native American group in Chile. A mobile people who engaged in trade and warfare with other indigenous groups, they lived in scattered family clusters and small villages. Although the Araucanians had no written language, they did use a common tongue. Those in what became central Chile were more settled and more likely to use irrigation. Those in the south combined slash-and-burn agriculture with hunting. Of the three Araucanian groups, the one that mounted the fiercest resistance to the attempts at seizure of their territory were the [[Mapuche]], meaning &quot;people of the land.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mapuches&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Urville-Araucanians.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The [[Mapuche]] were the original inhabitants of central and southern Chile.]]
The [[Inca Empire]] briefly extended their empire into what is now northern Chile, where they collected tribute from small groups of fishermen and oasis farmers but were not able to establish a strong cultural presence in the area.&lt;ref name=Chile&gt;{{cite book |title=Chile |last=Minnis |first=Natalie |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Langenscheidt Publishing Group |location= |language= |isbn=981-234-890-5, 978-981-234-890-6 |chapter= |page= |pages=381 |quote= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Nf8SnJ_ZJbkC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=inca+did+not+conquer+araucanians}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Spaniards would after them, the Incas encountered fierce resistance and so were unable to exert control in the south. During their attempts at conquest in 1460 and again in 1491, the Incas established forts in the Central Valley of Chile, but they could not colonize the region. The [[Mapuche]] fought against the Sapa [[Tupac Inca Yupanqui]] (CE 1471–1493)&lt;ref name=Garcilaso&gt;{{cite book |title=Comentarios reales |last=De la Vega |first=Garcilaso |authorlink=Inca Garcilaso de la Vega |coauthors= |year=1616 |publisher= |location= |language=Spanish |isbn= |chapter=Segunda Parte: Libro VII Cap. 18, 19 &amp; 20 |page= |pages= |quote= |url=http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Comentarios_reales}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his army. The result of the bloody three-day confrontation known as the [[Battle of the Maule]] was that the Inca conquest of the territories of Chile ended at the [[Maule river]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1981.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which subsequently became the boundary between the Incan empire and the Mapuche lands until the arrival of the Spaniards.

Scholars speculate that the total Araucanian population may have numbered 1 million at most when the Spaniards arrived in the 1530s; a century of European conquest and disease reduced that number by at least half. During the conquest, the Araucanians quickly added horses and European weaponry to their arsenal of clubs and bows and arrows. They became adept at raiding Spanish settlements and, albeit in declining numbers, managed to hold off the Spaniards and their descendants until the late nineteenth century. The Araucanians' valor inspired the Chileans to mythologize them as the nation's first national heroes, a status that did nothing, however, to elevate the wretched living standard of their descendants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mapuches&quot; /&gt;

[[File:MapPatagonia.gif|thumb|200px|Map of Patagonia]]&lt;ref&gt;ISBN 978-956-310-774-6 Map of Patagonia&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chilean [[Patagonia]] located south of the river &quot;calle calle&quot; in [[Valdivia]] was composed of many tribes, mainly [[Tehuelches]] that were consider giants by Spaniards during Magellan voyage of 1520.

The name Patagonia comes from the word ''[[patagon|patagón]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;Pigafetta&quot;&gt;[[Antonio Pigafetta]], ''[[:wikisource:it:Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo|Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo]]'', 1524: &quot;Il capitano generale nominò questi popoli Patagoni.&quot; The original word would probably be in [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]'s native Portuguese (''patagão'') or the Spanish of his men (''patagón''). It has been interpreted later as &quot;big foot&quot; but the etymology refers to a literary character in a Spanish novel of the early XVI century (see text).&lt;/ref&gt; used by [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] to describe the native people whom his expedition thought to be giants. It is now believed the Patagons were actually [[Tehuelche]]s  with an average height of 1.80 m (~5′11″) compared to the 1.55 m (~5′1″) average for Spaniards of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fondebrider|first= Jorge|authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title= Versiones de la Patagonia|origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= 1st|series= |date= |year= 2003|month= |publisher= Emecé Editores S.A.|location= Buenos Aires, Argentina|language= Spanish|isbn= 950-04-2498-3|oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 29|chapter= chapter 1 (Ámbitos y voces)|chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish conquest and colonization (1540&amp;ndash;1810)==
{{See|Captaincy General of Chile|Arauco War|Conquest of Chile}}
[[Image:Pedro de Valdivia.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Pedro de Valdivia]]]]
The first European to sight Chilean territory was [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who crossed the [[Strait of Magellan]] on November 1, 1520. However, the title of discoverer of Chile is usually assigned to [[Diego de Almagro]]. Almagro was [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s partner, and he received the Southern area.('''Nueva Toledo'''). He organized an expedition that brought him to central Chile in 1537, but he found little of value to compare with the gold and silver of the Incas in Peru. Left with the impression that the inhabitants of the area were poor, he returned to Peru, later to be garotted following defeat by Hernando Pizarro in a Civil War. &lt;ref&gt; Prescott&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://countrystudies.us/chile/5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

After this initial excursion there was little interest from colonial authorities in further exploring modern-day Chile. However, [[Pedro de Valdivia]], captain of the army, realizing the potential for expanding the Spanish empire southward, asked Pizarro's permission to invade and conquer the southern lands. With a couple of hundred men, he subdued the local inhabitants and founded the city of Santiago de Nueva Extremadura, now [[Santiago de Chile]], on February 12, 1541.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Carta a sus apoderados en la corte |last=Valdivia |first=Pedro de |authorlink=Pedro de Valdivia |coauthors= |date=October 15, 1550 |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |quote=...y llegado al valle de Copiapó, lo que trabajé en hacer la guerra a los naturales e fuertes que les rompí y la guerra que hice por todos los valles adelante, hasta que llegué al valle de Mapocho, que es cien leguas de Copiapó, e fundé la cibdad de Sanctiago del Nuevo Extremo, a los veinte e cuatro de hebrero del año de mill quinientos e cuarenta e uno, formando Cabildo, Justicia e Regimiento. |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/12593842001258285209068/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Valdivia found little gold in Chile he could see the agricultural richness of the land. He continued his explorations of the region west of the Andes and founded over a dozen towns and established the first [[encomienda]]s. The greatest resistance to Spanish rule came from the [[Mapuche]] culture, who opposed European conquest and colonization until the 1880s; this resistance is known as the [[Arauco War]]. Valdivia died at the [[Battle of Tucapel]], defeated by [[Lautaro (toqui)|Lautaro]], a young Mapuche ''[[toqui]]'' (war chief), but the European conquest was well underway. The Spaniards never subjugated the Mapuche territories; various attempts at conquest, both by military and peaceful means, failed. The Great Uprising of 1598 swept all Spanish presence south of the [[Bío-Bío River]] except Chiloé (and Valdivia which was decades later reestablished as a fort), and the great river became the frontier line between Mapuche lands and the Spanish realm.
North of that line cities grew up slowly, and Chilean lands eventually became an important source of food for the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]].

Valdivia became the first governor of the [[Captaincy General of Chile]]. In that post, he obeyed the viceroy of Peru and, through him, the King of Spain and his bureaucracy. Responsible to the governor, town councils known as ''[[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo]]'' administered local municipalities, the most important of which was Santiago, which was the seat of a Royal Appeals Court ({{lang-es|Real Audiencia}}) from 1609 until the end of colonial rule.

Chile was the least wealthy realm of the Spanish Crown for most of its colonial history. Only in the 18th century did a steady economic and demographic growth begin, an effect of the reforms by Spain's [[Bourbon Spain|Bourbon dynasty]] and a more stable situation along the frontier.

==Independence (1810&amp;ndash;1826)==
{{Main|Chilean War of Independence}}
[[Image:ohiggins.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Bernardo O'Higgins]]]]
The drive for independence from Spain was precipitated by usurpation of the Spanish throne by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]]. The Chilean War of Independence was part of the larger [[Spanish American wars of independence|Spanish American independence movement]], and it was far from having unanimous support among Chileans, who became divided between independentists and royalists. What started as an elitist political movement against their colonial master, finally ended as a full-fledged civil war between pro-Independence [[Criollo people|Criollos]] who sought political and economic independence from Spain and [[royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalist]] Criollos, who supported the continued allegiance to and permanence within the [[Spanish Empire]] of the [[Captaincy General of Chile|Kingdom of Chile]]. The struggle for independence was a war within the upper class, although the majority of troops on both sides consisted of conscripted mestizos and native Americans.

The beginning of the Independence movement is traditionally dated as September 18, 1810 when a national junta was established to govern Chile in the name of the deposed king [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]]. Depending on what terms one uses to define the end, the movement extended until 1821 (when the Spanish were expelled from mainland Chile) or 1826 (when the last Spanish troops surrendered and [[Chiloé]] was incorporated to the Chilean republic). The independence process is normally divided into three stages: ''[[Patria Vieja]]'', ''[[Reconquista (Chile)|Reconquista]]'', and ''[[Patria Nueva (Chile)|Patria Nueva]]''.

Chile's first experiment with self-government, the &quot;Patria Vieja&quot; (''old republic'', 1810–1814), was led by [[José Miguel Carrera]], an aristocrat then in his mid-twenties. The military-educated Carrera was a heavy-handed ruler who aroused widespread opposition. Another of the earliest advocates of full independence, [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], captained a rival faction that plunged the Criollos into civil war. For him and for certain other members of the Chilean elite, the initiative for temporary self-rule quickly escalated into a campaign for permanent independence, although other Criollos remained loyal to Spain. Among those favoring independence, conservatives fought with liberals over the degree to which French revolutionary ideas would be incorporated into the movement. After several efforts, Spanish troops from Peru took advantage of the internecine strife to reconquer Chile in 1814, when they reasserted control by winning the [[Battle of Rancagua]] on October 12. O'Higgins, Carrera and many of the Chilean rebels escaped to Argentina.

The second period was characterized by the Spanish attempts to reimpose arbitrary rule during the period known as the ''[[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]]'' of 1814–1817 (&quot;Reconquest&quot;: the term echoes the ''[[Reconquista]]'' in which the Christian kingdoms retook Iberia from the Muslims). During this period, the harsh rule of the Spanish loyalists, who punished suspected rebels, drove more and more Chileans into the insurrectionary camp. More members of the Chilean elite were becoming convinced of the necessity of full independence, regardless of who sat on the throne of Spain. As the leader of guerrilla raids against the Spaniards, [[Manuel Rodríguez]] became a national symbol of resistance.

[[Image:Battle of Chacabuco.jpg|thumb|250px|Chilean and Argentinean troops going to the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] (February 12, 1817) led by [[José de San Martín]].]]
In exile in Argentina, O'Higgins joined forces with [[José de San Martín]]. Their combined army freed Chile with a daring assault over the Andes in 1817, defeating the Spaniards at the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] on February 12 and marking the beginning of the ''Patria Nueva''. San Martín considered the liberation of Chile a strategic stepping-stone to the emancipation of Peru, which he saw as the key to hemispheric victory over the Spanish. Chile won its formal independence when San Martín defeated the last large Spanish force on Chilean soil at the [[Battle of Maipú]] on April 5, 1818. San Martín then led his Argentine and Chilean followers north to liberate Peru; and fighting continued in Chile's southern provinces, the bastion of the royalists, until 1826.

A [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] was officially issued by Chile on February 12, 1818 and formally recognized by Spain in 1840, when full diplomatic relations were established.

==Republican era (1818&amp;ndash;1891)==
===Constitutional organization (1818&amp;ndash;1833)===
{{see also|Chilean Civil War of 1829|Chilean Constitution of 1833}}

From 1817 to 1823, Bernardo O'Higgins ruled Chile as [[supreme director]]. He won plaudits for defeating royalists and founding schools, but civil strife continued. O'Higgins alienated liberals and provincials with his authoritarianism, conservatives and the church with his anticlericalism, and landowners with his proposed reforms of the land tenure system. His attempt to devise a constitution in 1818 that would legitimize his government failed, as did his effort to generate stable funding for the new administration. O'Higgins's dictatorial behavior aroused resistance in the provinces. This growing discontent was reflected in the continuing opposition of partisans of [[José Miguel Carrera|Carrera]], who was executed by the Argentine regime in Mendoza in 1821, like his two brothers were three years earlier.

Although opposed by many liberals, O'Higgins angered the Roman Catholic Church with his liberal beliefs. He maintained Catholicism's status as the official state religion but tried to curb the church's political powers and to encourage religious tolerance as a means of attracting Protestant immigrants and traders. Like the church, the landed aristocracy felt threatened by O'Higgins, resenting his attempts to eliminate noble titles and, more important, to eliminate entailed estates.

O'Higgins's opponents also disapproved of his diversion of Chilean resources to aid San Martín's liberation of Peru. O'Higgins insisted on supporting that campaign because he realized that Chilean independence would not be secure until the Spaniards were routed from the Andean core of the empire. However, amid mounting discontent, troops from the northern and southern provinces forced O'Higgins to resign. Embittered, O'Higgins departed for Peru, where he died in 1842.

After O'Higgins went into exile in 1823, civil conflict continued, focusing mainly on the issues of anticlericalism and regionalism. Presidents and constitutions rose and fell quickly in the 1820s. The civil struggle's harmful effects on the economy, and particularly on exports, prompted conservatives to seize national control in 1830.

In the minds of most members of the Chilean elite, the bloodshed and chaos of the late 1820s were attributable to the shortcomings of liberalism and federalism, which had been dominant over conservatism for most of the period. The political camp became divided by supporters of [[Bernardo O'Higgins|O'Higgins]], [[José Miguel Carrera|Carrera]], liberal [[Pipiolos]] and conservative [[Pelucones]], being the two last the main movements that prevailed and absorbed the rest. The abolition of slavery in 1823—long before most other countries in the Americas—was considered one of the Pipiolos' few lasting achievements. One Pipiolo leader from the south, [[Ramón Freire]], rode in and out of the presidency several times (1823–1827, 1828, 1829, 1830) but could not sustain his authority. From May 1827 to September 1831, with the exception of brief interventions by Freire, the presidency was occupied by [[Francisco Antonio Pinto]], Freire's former vice president. In August 1828, Pinto's first year in office, Chile abandoned its short-lived federalist system for a [[unitary state|unitary]] form of government, with separate legislative, executive, and judicial branches. By adopting a moderately liberal constitution in 1828, Pinto alienated both the federalists and the liberal factions. He also angered the old aristocracy by abolishing estates inherited by primogeniture (mayorazgo) and caused a public uproar with his [[anticlericalism]]. After the defeat of his liberal army at the Battle of Lircay on April 17, 1830, Freire, like O'Higgins, went into exile in Peru.

===Conservative Era (1830&amp;ndash;1861)===
[[Image:DiegoPortales.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Diego Portales]].]]
Although never president, [[Diego Portales]] dominated Chilean politics from the cabinet and behind the scenes from 1830 to 1837. He installed the &quot;autocratic republic&quot;, which centralized authority in the national government. His political program enjoyed support from merchants, large landowners, foreign capitalists, the church, and the military. Political and economic stability reinforced each other, as Portales encouraged economic growth through free trade and put government finances in order.

Portales was an agnostic who said that he believed in the clergy but not in God. He realized the importance of the Roman Catholic Church as a bastion of loyalty, legitimacy, social control, and stability, as had been the case in the colonial period. He repealed Liberal reforms that had threatened church privileges and properties.

Portales brought the military under civilian control by rewarding loyal generals, cashiering troublemakers, and promoting a victorious war against the [[Peru-Bolivia Confederation]] (1836–1839). After defeating Peru and Bolivia, Chile dominated the Pacific Coast of South America. The victory over its neighbors gave Chile and its new political system a psychological boost. Chileans experienced a surge of national enthusiasm and cohesion behind a regime accepted as legitimate and efficacious.

Portales also achieved his objectives by wielding dictatorial powers, censoring the press, and [[electoral fraud|manipulating elections]]. For the next forty years, Chile's armed forces would be distracted from meddling in politics by skirmishes and defensive operations on the [[La Frontera, Chile|southern frontier]], although some units got embroiled in domestic conflicts in [[Revolution of 1851|1851]] and 1859.

The &quot;Portalian State&quot; was institutionalized by the [[Chilean Constitution of 1833]]. One of the most durable charters ever devised in Latin America, the Portalian constitution lasted until 1925. The constitution concentrated authority in the national government, more precisely, in the hands of the president, who was elected by a tiny minority. The chief executive could serve two consecutive five-year terms and then pick a successor. Although the Congress had significant budgetary powers, it was overshadowed by the president, who appointed provincial officials. The constitution also created an independent judiciary, guaranteed inheritance of estates by primogeniture, and installed Catholicism as the state religion. In short, it established an autocratic system under a republican veneer.

The first Portalian president was General [[Joaquín Prieto]], who served two terms (1831–1836, 1836–1841). President Prieto had four main accomplishments: implementation of the 1833 constitution, stabilization of government finances, defeat of provincial challenges to central authority, and victory over the Peru-Bolivia Confederation. During the presidencies of Prieto and his two successors, Chile modernized through the construction of ports, railroads, and telegraph lines, some built by United States entrepreneur William Wheelwright. These innovations facilitated the export-import trade as well as domestic commerce.

Prieto and his adviser, Portales, feared the efforts of Bolivian general [[Andrés de Santa Cruz]] to unite with Peru against Chile. These qualms exacerbated animosities toward Peru dating from the colonial period, now intensified by disputes over customs duties and loans. Chile also wanted to become the dominant South American military and commercial power along the Pacific. Portales got Congress to declare war on Peru in 1836.

===Liberal era (1861&amp;ndash;1891)===
The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDoS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

[[File:Combate naval.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Battle of Iquique]] – the sinking of the Esmeralda (21 May 1879).]]
Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by persistently suppressing the [[Mapuche]] during the [[Occupation of the Araucanía]]. In 1881, it signed a treaty with [[Argentina]] confirming Chilean sovereignty over the [[Strait of Magellan]], but conceding all of oriental [[Patagonia]], and a considerable fraction of the territory it had during colonial times. As a result of the [[War of the Pacific]] with [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] (1879–1883), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third and acquired valuable [[nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence.

In the 1870s, the church influence started to diminish slightly with the passing of several laws that took some old roles of the church into the State's hands such as the registry of births and marriages.

[[Image:JoseManuelBalmaceda.jpg|thumb|150px|[[José Manuel Balmaceda]]]]
In 1886, [[José Manuel Balmaceda]] was elected president. His economic policies visibly changed the existing liberal policies. He began to violate the [[constitution]] and slowly began to establish a dictatorship. Congress decided to depose Balmaceda, who refused to step down. [[Jorge Montt]], among others, directed an armed conflict against Balmaceda, which soon extended into the [[Chilean Civil War]] of 1891. Defeated, Balmaceda fled to Argentina's embassy, where he committed suicide. Jorge Montt became the new president.

==Parliamentary era (1891&amp;ndash;1925)==
{{Main|History of Chile during the Parliamentary Era (1891–1925)}}
The so-called Parliamentary Republic was not a true parliamentary system, in which the chief executive is elected by the legislature. It was, however, an unusual regime in presidentialist Latin America, for Congress really did overshadow the rather ceremonial office of the president and exerted authority over the chief executive's cabinet appointees. In turn, Congress was dominated by the landed elites. This was the heyday of classic political and economic liberalism.

For many decades thereafter, historians derided the Parliamentary Republic as a quarrel-prone system that merely distributed spoils and clung to its laissez-faire policy while national problems mounted.&lt;ref name=&quot;country-data.com&quot;&gt;http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-2410.html&lt;/ref&gt; The characterization is epitomized by an observation made by President [[Ramón Barros Luco]] (1910–1915), reputedly made in reference to labor unrest: &quot;There are only two kinds of problems: those that solve themselves and those that can't be solved.&quot; At the mercy of Congress, cabinets came and went frequently, although there was more stability and continuity in public administration than some historians have suggested. Chile also temporary resolved its border disputes with Argentina with the [[Puna de Atacama Lawsuit]] of 1899, the [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] and the [[1902 General Treaty of Arbitration]].

Political authority ran from local electoral bosses in the provinces through the congressional and executive branches, which reciprocated with payoffs from taxes on nitrate sales. Congressmen often won election by bribing voters in this clientelistic and corrupt system. Many politicians relied on intimidated or loyal peasant voters in the countryside, even though the population was becoming increasingly urban. The lackluster presidents and ineffectual administrations of the period did little to respond to the country's dependence on volatile nitrate exports, spiraling inflation, and massive urbanization.&lt;ref name=&quot;country-data.com&quot;/&gt;

In recent years, however, particularly when the authoritarian regime of Augusto Pinochet is taken into consideration, some scholars have reevaluated the Parliamentary Republic of 1891–1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;country-data.com&quot;/&gt; Without denying its shortcomings, they have lauded its democratic stability. They have also hailed its control of the armed forces, it respect for civil liberties, its expansion of suffrage and participation, and its gradual admission of new contenders, especially reformers, to the political arena. In particular, two young parties grew in importance – the Democrat Party, with roots among artisans and urban workers, and the [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]], representing urban middle sectors and provincial elites. By the early twentieth century, both parties were winning increasing numbers of seats in Congress. The more leftist members of the Democrat Party became involved in the leadership of labor unions and broke off to launch the [[Communist Party of Chile|Socialist Workers' Party]] ({{lang-es|Partido Obrero Socialista}} – POS) in 1912. The founder of the POS and its best-known leader, [[Luis Emilio Recabarren]], also founded the [[Communist Party of Chile]] ({{lang-es|Partido Comunista de Chile}} – PCCh) in 1922.

==Presidential era (1925&amp;ndash;1973)==
{{Main|Presidential Republic (1925–1973)}}
[[File:Arturo Alessandi Palma 2.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Arturo Alessandri Palma]].]]
By the 1920s, the emerging middle and working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, [[Arturo Alessandri Palma]]. Alessandri appealed to those who believed the social question should be addressed, to those worried by the decline in nitrate exports during World War I, and to those weary of presidents dominated by Congress. Promising &quot;evolution to avoid revolution&quot;, he pioneered a new campaign style of appealing directly to the masses with florid oratory and charisma. After winning a seat in the Senate representing the mining north in 1915, he earned the sobriquet &quot;Lion of Tarapacá.&quot; As a dissident Liberal running for the presidency, Alessandri attracted support from the more reformist Radicals and Democrats and formed the so-called Liberal Alliance. He received strong backing from the middle and working classes as well as from the provincial elites. Students and intellectuals also rallied to his banner. At the same time, he reassured the landowners that social reforms would be limited to the cities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-2412.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Alessandri soon discovered that his efforts to lead would be blocked by the conservative Congress. Like Balmaceda, he infuriated the legislators by going over their heads to appeal to the voters in the congressional elections of 1924. His reform legislation was finally rammed through Congress under pressure from younger military officers, who were sick of the neglect of the armed forces, political infighting, social unrest, and galloping inflation. whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress.

A double military coup set off a period of great political instability that lasted until 1932. First military right-wingers opposing Alessandri seized power in September 1924, and then reformers in favor of the ousted president took charge in January 1925. The ''[[Saber noise]]'' (ruido de sables) incident of September 1924, provoked by discontent of young officers, mostly lieutenants from middle and working classes, lead to the establishment of the [[September Junta]] led by General [[Luis Altamirano]] and the exile of Alessandri.  However, fears of a conservative restoration in progressive sectors of the army led to [[1925 Chilean coup d'état|another coup in January]], which ended with the establishment of the [[January Junta]] as interim government while waiting for Alessandri's return. The latter group was led by two colonels, [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]] and [[Marmaduke Grove]]. They returned Alessandri to the presidency that March and enacted his promised reforms by decree. The latter re-assumed power in March, and a [[Chilean Constitution of 1925|new Constitution]] encapsulating his proposed reforms was ratified in a plebiscite in September 1925. The new constitution gave increased powers to the presidency. Alessandri broke with the [[classical liberalism]]'s policies of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' by creating a [[Chilean Central Bank|Central Bank]] and imposing a [[revenue tax]]. However, social discontents were also crushed, leading to the [[Marusia massacre]] in March 1925 followed by the [[La Coruña massacre]].

The longest lasting of the ten governments between 1924 and 1932 was that of General Carlos Ibáñez, who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a ''de facto'' dictatorship. Ibánez was a German national who pledged allegiance to his mother country of Germany, effectively making Chile a German possession.  This lasted until Adolf Hitler assumed control of Germany, starting the 3rd Reich.  Not wanting to be part of Hitler's new regime, constitutional rule was restored in 1932, and a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years.

The [[Seguro Obrero Massacre]] took place on September 5, 1938, in the midst of a heated three-way election campaign between the ultraconservative [[Gustavo Ross Santa María]], the radical [[Popular Front (Chile)|Popular Front]]'s [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]], and the newly-formed Popular Alliance candidate, [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]]. The [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]] supported Ibáñez's candidacy, which had been announced on September 4. In order to preempt Ross's victory, the National Socialists mounted a [[coup d'état]] that was intended to take down the rightwing government of [[Arturo Alessandri Palma]] and place Ibáñez in power.

During the period of [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]] dominance (1932–1952), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ibáñez to office for another 6 years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded Ibáñez in 1958.

The [[Chilean presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]] of [[Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] by an [[absolute majority]] initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan &quot;Revolution in Liberty&quot;, the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and [[agrarian reform]], including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had accomplished many noteworthy objectives, but he had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.

==Allende era==
{{See|Chile under Allende|Chilean nationalization of copper|United States intervention in Chile}}
[[File:Allende supporters.jpg|thumb|250px|Marchers for [[Salvador Allende]].]]
In the [[Chilean presidential election, 1970|1970 presidential election]], Senator [[Salvador Allende Gossens]] won a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in a three-way contest. He was a [[Marxism|Marxist]] physician and member of Chile's [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]], who headed the &quot;[[Popular Unity]]&quot; (UP or &quot;Unidad Popular&quot;) coalition of the Socialist, Communist, Radical, and Social-Democratic Parties, along with dissident Christian Democrats, the [[Popular Unitary Action Movement]] (MAPU), and the Independent Popular Action. Allende had two main competitors in the election — [[Radomiro Tomic]], representing the incumbent Christian Democratic party, who ran a left-wing campaign with much the same theme as Allende's, and the right-wing former president [[Jorge Alessandri]]. In the end, Allende received a plurality of the votes cast, getting 36% of the vote against Alessandri's 34% and Tomic's 27%.

Despite pressure from the government of the United States,&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20001113/|title=Chile: 16,000 Secret Documents Declassified|year=2000|publisher=Chile Documentation Project, The National Security Archive|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Congress of Chile|Chilean Congress]], keeping with tradition, conducted a runoff vote between the leading candidates, Allende and former president [[Jorge Alessandri]]. This procedure had previously been a near-formality, yet became quite fraught in 1970. After assurances of legality on Allende's part, the murder of the Army Commander-in-Chief, General [[René Schneider]] and Frei's refusal to form an alliance with Alessandri to oppose Allende – on the grounds that the Christian Democrats were a workers' party and could not make common cause with the oligarchs – Allende was chosen by a vote of 153 to 35.

The Popular Unity platform included the nationalization of U.S. interests in Chile's major [[copper]] mines, the advancement of workers' rights, implementation of [[land reform]], reorganization of the national economy into socialized, mixed, and private sectors, a foreign policy of &quot;international solidarity&quot; and national independence and a new institutional order (the &quot;people's state&quot; or &quot;poder popular&quot;), including the institution of a unicameral congress. Immediately after the election, the United States expressed its disapproval and raised a number of economic sanctions against Chile.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; In addition, the [[CIA]]'s website reports that the agency aided three different Chilean opposition groups during that time period and &quot;sought to instigate a coup to prevent Allende from taking office&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; The action plans to prevent Allende from coming to power were known as Track I and [[Project FUBELT|Track II]].&lt;ref name=Kornbluh&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kornbluh |first=Peter |date=1998-10-25 |title=The Chile Coup – The U.S. Hand |journal=If Magazine |url=http://globalresearch.ca/articles/KOR309A.html |accessdate=2009-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, indigenous and peasant forces across the country violently started to take control of agricultural lands, forcibly fulfilling Allende's land redistribution promises.

In the first year of Allende's term, the short-term economic results of Economics Minister [[Pedro Vuskovic]]'s [[Vuskovic plan|expansive monetary policy]] were unambiguously favorable: 12% industrial growth and an 8.6% increase in [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], accompanied by major declines in inflation (down from 34.9% to 22.1%) and unemployment (down to 3.8%). Allende adopted measures including price freezes, wage increases, and tax reforms, which had the effect of increasing consumer spending and redistributing income downward. Joint public-private [[public works]] projects helped reduce unemployment. Much of the banking sector was [[nationalization|nationalized]]. Many enterprises within the copper, [[coal]], [[iron]], [[nitrate]], and [[steel]] industries were [[Nationalization|expropriated]], nationalized, or subjected to state intervention. Industrial output increased sharply and [[unemployment]] fell during the administration's first year. However, these results were not sustainable and in 1972 the Chilean ''escudo'' had runaway [[inflation]] of 140%. An [[economic depression]] that had begun in 1967 peaked in 1972, exacerbated by [[capital flight]], plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and unemployment rose. The combination of inflation and government-mandated price-fixing led to the rise of [[black market]]s in rice, beans, sugar, and flour, and a &quot;disappearance&quot; of such basic commodities from supermarket shelves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glamorama.cl/medio/articulo/0,0,38035857_178048856_151840537,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the [[Richard Nixon]] administration [[United States intervention in Chile|organized and inserted secret operatives]] in Chile, in order to quickly destabilize Allende's government.&lt;ref name=Kornbluh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch01-01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch27-01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch05-01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/nsaebb8.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Nixon gave instructions to make the Chilean economy scream,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; and international financial pressure restricted economic credit to Chile. Simultaneously, the [[CIA]] funded opposition media, politicians, and organizations, helping to accelerate a campaign of domestic destabilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/chile/doc/hinchey.html]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1972, the economic progress of Allende's first year had been reversed, and the economy was in crisis. Political polarization increased, and large mobilizations of both pro- and anti-government groups became frequent, often leading to clashes.

By 1973, Chilean society had grown highly polarized, between strong opponents and equally strong supporters of Salvador Allende and his government. Military actions and movements, separate from the civilian authority, began to manifest in the countryside. A failed military [[coup d'état|coup]] was attempted against Allende in June 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foia.state.gov/Reports/HincheyReport.asp|title=CIA Activities in Chile|date=September 18, 2000|publisher=Hinchey Report|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its &quot;[[Wikisource:Agreement of the Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Agreement]]&quot;, on August 22, 1973, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile]] asserted that Chilean democracy had broken down and called for &quot;redirecting government activity&quot;, to restore constitutional rule. Less than a month later, on September 11, 1973, the Chilean military deposed Allende, who apparently [[Death of Salvador Allende|shot himself in the head]] to avoid capture&lt;ref name=Kornbluh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allende&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=164983&amp;tabla=notas |title=Admite hija de Allende suicidio de su padre |date=August 17, 2003|publisher=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]|location=Mexico City, Mexico |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[Palacio de La Moneda|Presidential Palace]] was surrounded and bombed. Subsequently, rather than restore governmental authority to the civilian legislature, [[Augusto Pinochet]] exploited his role as Commander of the Army to [[Chilean coup of 1973|seize total power]] and to establish himself at the head of a [[Military dictatorship|junta]].

By early 1973, [[inflation]] had risen 800% under Allende's presidency.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=3uFAr6lhPxgC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=chile+inflation+1973+800%25&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5H67lYFgjK&amp;sig=wKXwuwubj5JXZ93lMg9nHlDeiI0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Iy1ZS-P2Js6ztgeT_NScAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CA8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=chile%20inflation%201973%20800%25&amp;f=false Latin America's economy: diversity, trends, and conflicts]&lt;/ref&gt;'' The crippled economy was further battered by prolonged and sometimes simultaneous [[strike action|strikes]] by physicians, teachers, students, truck owners, copper workers, and the small business class. A [[Chilean coup of 1973|military coup]] overthrew Allende on September 11, 1973. As the armed forces bombarded the presidential palace ([[Palacio de La Moneda]]), Allende committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Óscar|last=Soto|title=El Último dia de Salvador Allende}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Eugenio|last=Ahumada|title=Chile: La memoria prohibida}}&lt;/ref&gt; A military government, led by General [[Augusto Pinochet Ugarte]], took over control of the country. The first years of the regime were marked by [[human rights violation]]s. On October 1973, at least 72 people were murdered by the [[Caravan of Death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/850932.stm| work=[[BBC News]]|title=Flashback: Caravan of Death| accessdate=2008-05-02 | date=July 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least a thousand people were executed during the first six months of Pinochet in office, and at least two thousand more were killed during the next sixteen years, as reported by the [[Rettig Report]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usip.org/library/tc/doc/reports/chile/chile_1993_toc.html&lt;/ref&gt; About 30,000 left the country, and tens of thousands of people were detained and tortured, as investigated by the 2004 [[Valech Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4050655.stm] Chile torture victims win payout&lt;/ref&gt; A new [[Constitution]] was approved by [[plebiscite]] characterized by the absence of registration lists, on September 11, 1980, and General Pinochet became president of the republic for an 8-year term.
In the late 1980s, the government gradually permitted greater freedom of assembly, [[Freedom of speech|speech]], and association, to include trade union and political activity. The government launched market-oriented reforms, which have continued ever since. Chile moved toward a [[free market economy]] that saw an increase in domestic and foreign private investment, although the copper industry and other important mineral resources were not opened for competition. In a plebiscite on October 5, 1988, General Pinochet was denied a second 8-year term as president (56% against 44%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/chile/88.htm|title=Country Study of Chile: Authoritarianism Defeated by Its Own Rules|date=March 31, 1994|publisher=US Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the coup, Chileans witnessed a large-scale repression, which started as soon as October 1973, with at least 70 persons murdered by the [[Caravan of Death]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/07/chile-high-court-allows-pinochet.php]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/63821.stm] Pinochet's rule: Repression and economic success&lt;/ref&gt; The four-man junta headed by General Augusto Pinochet abolished [[civil liberties]], dissolved the national congress, banned union activities, prohibited strikes and collective bargaining, and erased the Allende administration's agrarian and economic reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/radical_history_review/v085/85.1zarate.pdf] Terrorism and Political Violence during the Pinochet Years: Chile, 1973–1989&lt;/ref&gt; The junta jailed, tortured, and executed thousands of Chileans.

[[Image:GDP per capita LA-Chile.png|thumb|right|250px|Chilean (blue) and average Latin American (orange) [[GDP per capita]] (1950–2007).]]

The junta embarked on a radical program of [[liberalization]] and [[privatization]], slashing [[tariff]]s as well as government welfare programs and [[deficit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://crs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/17/2/57&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Chile was in shambles – [[inflation]] was hundreds of percents, the country had no [[foreign reserves]], and [[Depression (economics)|GDP was falling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brauchle&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecaef.org/klex/user/1/41894820_10_10.ppt|title=Applied Theory: The Reforms in Chile|author=Manfred Bräuchle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to halt the ongoing economic collapse, [[Miracle of Chile|economic reforms]] were drafted by a group of technocrats known as the [[Chicago Boys]] because many of them had been trained or influenced by [[University of Chicago]] professors. The first reforms were implemented in three rounds – 1974–1983, 1985, and 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;brauchle&quot;/&gt;

After the economic crisis of 1982, [[Hernan Buchi]] became Minister of Finance from 1985 to 1989.  He allowed the peso to float and reinstated restrictions on the movement of capital in and out of the country. He introduced banking legislation, simplified and reduced the corporate tax. Chile pressed ahead with privatizations, including public utilities plus the re-privatization of companies that had returned to the government during the 1982–1983 crisis. Under these new policies, the rate of inflation dropped from about 1,000% per year to about 10% per year. While this was still a high rate of inflation, it allowed the economy to start recovering. From 1984 to 1990, Chile's gross domestic product grew by an annual average of 5.9%, the fastest on the continent. Chile developed a good export economy, including the export of fruits and vegetables to the northern hemisphere when they were out of season, and commanded high prices.

An important initiative begun in 1981 and carried on until today, aimed at modernizing the use of [[Information and Communication technology]], greatly contributed to disentangle the traditional bureaucratic and cumbersome clerical procedures in all dealings with branches of the government, from [[civil registry]] to import/export documentation, thereby fostering a more agile economy and a more efficient [[public administration]].

The military junta began to change during the late 1970s. Due to problems with Pinochet, Leigh was expelled from the junta in 1978 and replaced by General [[Fernando Matthei]]. Due to the [[Caso Degollados]] (&quot;slit throats case&quot;), in which three [[Chilean Communist Party|Communist party]] members were assassinated, [[César Mendoza]], member of the junta since 1973 and representants of the [[Carabineros de Chile|carabineros]], resigned in 1985 and was replaced by [[Rodolfo Stange]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The next year, [[Carmen Gloria Quintana]] was burnt alive in what became known as the [[Burnt Alive case|Caso Quemado]] (&quot;Burnt Alive case&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}}http://www.cidh.oas.org/annualrep/87.88sp/Chile9755.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems with Argentina coming from the 19th century reached a high in 1978, with disagreements over the Beagle Canal. The two countries agreed to papal mediation over the canal. Chilean-Argentine relations remained bad, however, and Chile helped Britain during the [[Falklands War]].

Chile's [[Constitution of Chile|constitution]] was approved in a national plebiscite held in September 1980. It came into force in March 1981. It established that in 1988 there would be another plebiscite in which the voters would accept or reject a single candidate proposed by the Military Junta. Pinochet was, as expected, the candidate proposed, and he was denied a second 8 year term by 54.5% of the vote.

==Transition to democracy (1990&amp;ndash;present)==
{{Main|Chilean transition to democracy}}
Chileans elected a new president and the majority of members of a two-chamber congress on December 14, 1989. Christian Democrat [[Patricio Aylwin]], the candidate of a coalition of 17 political parties called the ''[[Coalition of Parties for Democracy|Concertación]]'', received an absolute majority of votes (55%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6DD1E3BF935A25751C1A96F948260|title=Man in the News: Patricio Aylwin; A Moderate Leads Chile|work=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=2008-05-02 | first=Shirley | last=Christian | date=December 16, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Aylwin served from 1990 to 1994, in what was considered a transition period. In February 1991 Aylwin created the [[National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation]], which released in February 1991 the [[Rettig Report]] on human rights violations committed during the military rule. This report counted 2,279 cases of &quot;[[forced disappearance|disappearances]]&quot; which could be proved and registered. Of course, the very nature of &quot;disappearances&quot; made such investigations very difficult. The same problem arose, several years later, with the [[Valech Report]], released in 2004 and which counted almost 30,000 victims of [[torture]], among testimonies from 35,000 persons.

[[File:Edo.Frei.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]].]]
In December 1993, Christian Democrat [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]], the son of previous president [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], led the Concertación coalition to victory with an absolute majority of votes (58%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-8257609.html|title=Chile elects new leader Late president's son wins big|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frei Ruiz-Tagle was succeeded in 2000 by Socialist [[Ricardo Lagos]], who won the presidency in an unprecedented [[runoff election]] against [[Joaquín Lavín]] of the rightist [[Alliance for Chile]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/americas/01/17/chile.elex.01/|title=Moderate socialist Lagos wins Chilean presidential election|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=January 16, 2000| accessdate=2008-05-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080506162601/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/americas/01/17/chile.elex.01/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a very tight score of less than 200,000 votes (51,32%).

In 1998, Pinochet traveled to London for back surgery. But under orders of Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garzón]], he was [[Augusto Pinochet's arrest and trial|arrested there]], attracting worldwide attention, not only because of the past history of Chile and South America, but also because this was one of the first arrests of a former president based on the [[universal jurisdiction]] principle. Pinochet tried to defend himself by referring to the [[State Immunity Act of 1978]], an argument rejected by the British justice. However, [[UK Home Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] took the responsibility to release him on medical grounds, and refused to extradite him to Spain. Thereafter, Pinochet returned to Chile in March 2000. Upon descending the plane on his wheelchair, he stood up and saluted the cheering crowd of supporters, including an army band playing his favorite military march tunes, which was awaiting him at the airport in Santiago. President [[Ricardo Lagos]] later commented that the retired general's televised arrival had damaged the image of Chile, while thousands demonstrated against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/665342.stm|title=Thousands march against Pinochet|date=March 4, 2000|publisher=[[BBC News]]|location=London, UK|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:26042007g00010 Bachelet.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Michelle Bachelet]].]]
The ''Concertación'' coalition has continued to dominate Chilean politics for last two decades. In January 2006 Chileans elected their first woman president, [[Michelle Bachelet]], of the Socialist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10819903/|title=Chile elects first woman president|publisher=[[msnbc.com]]|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was sworn in on March 11, 2006, extending the ''Concertación'' coalition governance for another four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/11/AR2006031101381.html|title=Bachelet Sworn In As Chile's President|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2008-05-02 | first=Monte | last=Reel | date=March 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Chile signed an association agreement with the [[European Union]] (comprising FTA, political and cultural agreements), in 2003, an extensive free trade agreement with the United States, and in 2004 with [[South Korea]], expecting a boom in import and export of local produce and becoming a regional trade-hub. Continuing the coalition's free-trade strategy, in August 2006 President Bachelet promulgated a [[free trade agreement]] with the [[People's Republic of China]] (signed under the previous administration of Ricardo Lagos), the first Chinese free-trade agreement with a Latin American nation; similar deals with Japan and India were promulgated in August 2007. In October 2006, Bachelet promulgated a multilateral trade deal with New Zealand, [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei]], the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]] (P4), also signed under Lagos' presidency. Regionally, she has signed bilateral free-trade agreements with [[Panama]], [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]].

After 20 years, Chile is now heading in a new direction.  Over half of the registered voting population of Chile has opted for a change away from center-left politics by electing a right-wing candidate, [[Sebastián Piñera]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Chile}}

The '''[[politics]] of [[Chile]]''' takes place in a framework of a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Chile]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a formal [[multi-party system]] that in practice behaves like a two-party one, due to [[Binominal System|binominalism]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the two chambers of the [[National Congress of Chile|National Congress]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

Chile's current [[Constitution of Chile|Constitution]] was approved in a national plebiscite in September 1980, under the [[military Junta|military]] [[government]] of dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]]. It entered into force in March 1981. After Pinochet left power in the 1988, saying this country was ready to keep going along with a [[plebiscite]], the Constitution was amended to ease provisions for future amendments to the Constitution. In September 2005, President [[Ricardo Lagos]] signed into law several constitutional amendments passed by Congress. These include eliminating the positions of appointed senators and [[senators for life]], granting the President authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, and reducing the presidential term from six to four years while also disabling immediate re-election.

==Legislative branch==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Chile]] --&gt;
{{main|National Congress of Chile}}
&lt;!--[[Image:Tuca jfuentes.jpg|thumb|250px|right|On the poster: ''[[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]] was not a saint... he murdered my father and thousands of [[Chilean people|Chileans]].''&lt;br /&gt;Pinochet's legacy continues to be a hot subject in Chilean politics, especially since many leftist politicians, such as Tucapel Jiménez in the picture, had their parents killed.]]--&gt;
The bicameral [[National Congress of Chile|National Congress]] ''(Congreso Nacional)'' consists of the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] ''(Senado)'' and the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] ''(Cámara de Diputados).''

Chile's congressional elections are governed by a unique binominal system that rewards coalition slates. Each coalition can present two candidates for the two Senate and two lower-chamber seats apportioned to each chamber's electoral districts. Typically, the two largest coalitions split the seats in a district. Only if the leading coalition ticket outpolls the second-place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does the winning coalition gain both seats. The political parties with the largest representation in the current Chilean Congress are the centrist [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile|Christian Democrat Party]] and the conservative [[Independent Democratic Union]] ''(Unión Demócrata Independiente)''. The [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist Party]] and the small [[Humanist Party of Chile|Humanist Party]] failed to gain any seats in the 1998 elections.

Elections are very labor intensive but efficient, and vote counting normally takes place the evening of the election day. One voting table, with a ballot-box each, is set up for at-most 200 names in the voting registry. Each table is manned by five people (''vocales de mesa'') from the same registry. Vocales have the duty to work as such during a cycle of elections, and can be penalized legally if they do not show up. A registered citizen can only vote after his identity has been verified at the table corresponding to his registry. Ballots are manually counted by the five vocales, after the table has closed, at least eight hours after opening, and the counting witnessed by representatives of all the parties who choose to have observers. 

The Senate is made up of 38 members elected from regions or subregions. Senators serve approximately eight-year terms.

The Chamber of Deputies has 120 members, who are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The last congressional elections were held on December 11, 2006. The next congressional elections are scheduled for December 2009.

The current Senate composition is as follows: 20 seats are held by the [[Coalition of Parties for Democracy]] (CPD): Six [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrats]] (PDC), eight [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialists]] (PS), three [[Party for Democracy]] (PPD) and three [[Social Democrat Radical Party]] (PRSD); 17 by the [[Alliance for Chile]] (APC): nine [[Independent Democrat Union]] (UDI) and eight [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]] (RN); and one independent leaning right.

The current lower house&amp;mdash;the Chamber of Deputies &amp;mdash;contains 65 members of the governing coalition: 21 [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrats]] (PDC), 15 [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialists]] (PS), 22 [[Party for Democracy]] (PPD) and seven [[Social Democrat Radical Party]] (PRSD); 54 from the center-right [[Alliance for Chile]](APC): 34 [[Independent Democrat Union]] (UDI) and 20 [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]] (RN); and 1 from the [[Independent Regional Force]] (FRI) coalition: 1 [[Regionalist Action Party of Chile]] (PAR).

Since 1987 the Congress operates in the port city of [[Valparaíso]], about 110 kilometers (~70&amp;nbsp;mi.) northwest of the capital, [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]]. However some commissions are allowed to meet in other places, especially Santiago. Congressional members have tried repeatedly to relocate the Congress back to Santiago, where it operated until the [[Chilean Coup of 1973]], but have not been successful. The last attempt was in 2000, when the project was rejected by the Constitutional Court, because it allocated funds from the national budget, which, under the Chilean Constitution, is a privilege of the President.

==Legal system==
{{main|Law of Chile}}
Chile's judiciary is independent and includes a court of appeal, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the [[Supreme Court of Chile|Supreme Court]]. The judges on the Supreme Court or Corte Suprema are appointed by the president and ratified by the Senate from lists of candidates provided by the court itself. The president of the Supreme Court is elected by the 21-member court.

Chile's legal system is [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] based. It is primarily based on the [[Civil code]] of 1855, derived from Spanish law and subsequent codes influenced by European law of the last half of the 19th Century. It does not accept compulsory ICJ jurisdiction.

From the year 2000 onward, Chile completely overhauled its criminal justice system; a new, US-style [[adversarial system]] has been gradually implemented throughout the country with the final stage of implementation in the Santiago metropolitan region completed on June 9, 2001

==History==
{{main|Economic history of Chile}}
{{Expand section|date=February 2011}}
During the early 1990s, Chile's reputation as a role model for economic reform was strengthened when the democratic government of [[Patricio Aylwin]], who took over from the military in 1990, deepened the economic reform initiated by the military government. Growth in real GDP averaged 8% from 1991–1997,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} but fell to half that level in 1998 because of tight monetary policies (implemented to keep the current account deficit in check) and because of lower export earnings, the latter which was a product of the Asian financial crisis. Chile's economy has since recovered and has seen growth rates of 5-7% over the past several years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

After a decade of impressive growth rates, Chile began to experience a moderate economic downturn in 1999, brought on by unfavorable global economic conditions related to the [[Asian financial crisis]], which began in 1997. The economy remained sluggish until 2003, when it began to show clear signs of recovery, achieving 4.0% real GDP growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indexmundi.com/chile/gdp_real_growth_rate.html] Chile GDP – real growth rate&lt;/ref&gt; The Chilean economy finished 2004 with growth of 6.0%. Real GDP growth reached 5.7% in 2005 before falling back to 4.0% in 2006. GDP expanded by 5.1% in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/chile/85.htm|title=Development and Breakdown of Democracy, 1830-1973|work=Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress|date=1994-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sectors==
===Agriculture===
{{main|Agriculture in Chile}}
Agriculture and allied sectors like [[forestry]], [[logging]] and [[fishing]] accounts only for 4.9% of the [[GDP]] as of 2007 and employed 13.6% of the country's [[labor force]]. Some major agriculture products of Chile includes grapes, apples, pears, onions, wheat, corn, oats, peaches, garlic, asparagus, beans, beef, poultry, wool, fish and timber.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;

Chile’s position in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] leads to an agricultural season cycle opposite to those of the principal consumer markets, primarily located in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amcham&quot;/&gt; Chile’s extreme north-south orientation produces 7 different macro-regions distinguished by climate and geographical features, which allows the country itself to stagger harvests and results in extended harvesting seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amcham&quot;/&gt; However, the [[Geography of Chile|mountainous landscape of Chile]] limits the extent and intensity of agriculture so that arable land corresponds only to 2.62% of the total territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt; Through Chile’s trade agreements, its agricultural products have gained access to a market controlling 77% of the world’s GDP and by approximately 2012, 74% of Chilean agribusiness exports will be duty free.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amcham&quot;/&gt;

Chiles principal [[growing region]] and agricultural [[heartland]] is the [[Chilean Central Valley|Central Valley]] delimited by the [[Chilean Coast Range]] in the west, the [[Andes]] in the east [[Aconcagua River]] by the north and [[Bío-Bío River]] by the south. In the northern half of Chile cultivation is highly dependent on [[irrigation]]. South of the Central Valley cultivation is gradually replaced by [[aquaculture]], [[silviculture]], [[sheep]] and [[cattle]] farming.

====Salmon====
Chile is the second largest producer of [[salmon]] in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amcham&quot;/&gt; As of August 2007, Chile’s share of worldwide salmon industry sales was 38.2%, rising from just 10% in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amcham&quot;/&gt; The average growth rate of the industry for the 20 years between 1984 and 2004 was 42% per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amcham&quot;/&gt; The presence of large foreign firms in the salmon industry has brought what probably most contributes to Chile’s burgeoning salmon production, technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amcham&quot;/&gt; Technology transfer has allowed Chile to build its global competitiveness and innovation and has led to the expansion of production as well as to an increase in average firm size in the industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amcham&quot;/&gt;

====Forestry====
The Chilean forestry industry grew to comprise 13% of the country’s total exports in 2005, making it one of the largest export sectors for Chile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amcham&quot;/&gt; [[Radiata Pine]] and [[Eucalyptus]] comprise the vast majority of Chile's forestry exports.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amcham&quot;/&gt; Within the forestry sector, the largest contributor to total production is [[pulp]], followed by wood-based panels and [[lumber]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Amcham&quot;/&gt; Due to popular and increasing demands for Chile’s forestry products, the government is currently focusing on increasing the already vast acreage of Chile’s Pine and Eucalyptus plantations as well as opening new industrial plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amcham&quot;&gt;[http://www.amchamchile.cl/estudios Amcham Chile]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining===
{{See also|Mining in Chile}}
[[File:Chuqui001.jpg|thumb|Chile produces more than a third of the world's copper.]]
The mining sector in Chile is one of the pillars of Chilean economy. The Chilean government strongly supports foreign investment in the sector and has modified its mining industry laws and regulations to create a favorable investing environment for foreigners. Thanks to a large amount of copper resources, progressive legislation and a healthy investment environment, Chile has become the copper mining capital of the world, producing over 1/3 of the global copper output.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amcham&quot;/&gt;

===Services===
====Finance====
Chile's financial sector has grown quickly in recent years, with a banking reform law approved in 1997 that broadened the scope of permissible foreign activity for Chilean banks. The Chilean Government implemented a further liberalization of capital markets in 2001, and there is further pending legislation proposing further liberalization. Over the last ten years, Chileans have enjoyed the introduction of new financial tools such as home equity loans, currency futures and options, factoring, leasing, and debit cards. The introduction of these new products has also been accompanied by an increased use of traditional instruments such as loans and credit cards. Chile's private pension system, with assets worth roughly $70 billion at the end of 2006, has been an important source of investment capital for the capital market. However, by 2009, it has been reported that $21 billion had been lost from the pension system to the global financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/chile/090121/uncertain-future |title=An uncertain future |publisher=GlobalPost |date= |accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tourism====
{{main|Tourism in Chile}}
Tourism in Chile has experienced sustained growth over the last decades. [[Chile]] received about 2.25 million foreign visitors in 2006,&lt;ref name=&quot;INE&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ine.cl/canales/chile_estadistico/estadisticas_economicas/turismo/infoanual/informesanuales.php |title=2006 Tourism Report |accessdate=2008-08-05 |work= |publisher=INE |date= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080730174532/http://www.ine.cl/canales/chile_estadistico/estadisticas_economicas/turismo/infoanual/informesanuales.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; up to 2.50 million in 2007 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tourismroi.com/Content_Attachments/27670/File_633513750035785076.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The percentages of foreign tourists arrivals by land, air and sea were, respectively, 55.3%, 40.5% and 4.2% for that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;INE&quot;/&gt; The two main gateways for international tourists visiting Chile are [[Comodoro Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport]] and [[Paso Libertadores|Paso Los Libertadores]].

Chile a great diversity of natural landscapes, from the Mars-like landscapes of the hyperarid [[Atacama Desert]] to the glacier-fed fjords of the Chilean [[Patagonia]], passing by the winelands backdropped by the [[Andes]] of the [[Chilean Central Valley|Central Valley]] and the old-growth forests of the Lakes District. [[Easter Island]] and [[Juan Fernández Archipelago]], including [[Robinson Crusoe Island]], are also major attractions.

Many of the most visited attractions in Chile are protected areas. The extensive [[Protected areas of Chile|Chilean protected areas]] system includes 32 national parks, 48 natural reserves and 15 natural monuments.&lt;ref name=&quot;INE&quot;/&gt;

==Economic policies==
[[Image:GDP per capita LA-Chile.png‎|thumb|[[Chile]]an (blue) and average [[Latin America]]n (orange) [[GDP per capita]] (1950-2007).]]
Sound economic policies, maintained consistently since the 1980s, have contributed to steady economic growth in Chile and have more than halved poverty rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;&gt;{{CIA World Factbook link|ci|Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1973-90 military government sold many state-owned companies, and the three democratic governments since 1990 have continued privatization, though at a slower pace. The government's role in the economy is mostly limited to regulation, although the state continues to operate copper giant CODELCO and a few other enterprises (there is one state-run bank). Chile is strongly committed to free trade and has welcomed large amounts of foreign investment. Chile has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with a whole network of countries, including an FTA with the United States that was signed in 2003 and implemented in January 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ustr.gov/Trade_Agreements/Bilateral/Chile_FTA/Final_Texts/Section_Index.html] USA-Chile FTA Final Text&lt;/ref&gt;

Chile's independent [[Central Bank]] pursues an inflation target of between 2% and 4%. Inflation has not exceeded 5% since 1998. Chile registered an inflation rate of 3.2% in 2006. The Chilean peso's rapid appreciation against the U.S. dollar in recent years has helped dampen inflation. Most wage settlements and loans are indexed, reducing inflation's volatility. Under the compulsory private pension system, most formal sector employees pay 10% of their salaries into privately managed funds.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

As of 2006, Chile invested only 0.6% of its annual GDP in research and development (R&amp;D). Even then, two-thirds of that was government spending. Beyond its general economic and political stability, the government has also encouraged the use of Chile as an &quot;investment platform&quot; for multinational corporations planning to operate in the region, but this will have limited value given the developing business climate in Chile itself.{{Specify|date=February 2011}} Chile's approach to foreign direct investment is codified in the country's Foreign Investment Law, which gives foreign investors the same treatment as Chileans. Registration is reported to be simple and transparent, and foreign investors are guaranteed access to the official foreign exchange market to repatriate their profits and capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

Faced with an [[2008 financial crisis|international economic downturn]] the government announced a $4 billion economic stimulus plan to spur employment and growth, and despite the global financial crisis, aimed for an expansion of between 2 percent and 3 percent of GDP for 2009. Nonetheless, economic analysts disagreed with government estimates and predicted economic growth at a median of 1.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/economicNews/idUSN1027661220090110 |title=Chile finmin says no recession seen in 2009-report |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-01-10 |accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the CIA World FactBook, the GDP contracted an estimated -1.7% in 2009.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The Chilean Government has formed a Council on Innovation and Competition, which is tasked with identifying new sectors and industries to promote. It is hoped that this, combined with some tax reforms to encourage domestic and foreign investment in [[research and development]], will bring in additional FDI to new parts of the economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

Chile maintains one of the best credit ratings (S&amp;P A+) in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Americas/Chile-OVERVIEW-OF-ECONOMY.html] Chile: Overview of economy&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main ways for Chilean firms to raise funds abroad: bank loans, issuance of bonds, and the selling of stocks on U.S. markets through American Depository Receipts (ADRs). Nearly all of the funds raised through these means go to finance domestic Chilean investment. The government is required by law to run a fiscal surplus of at least 1% of GDP. In 2006, the Government of Chile ran a surplus of $11.3 billion, equal to almost 8% of GDP. The Government of Chile continues to pay down its foreign debt, with public debt only 3.9% of GDP at the end of 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

==Foreign trade==
[[File:Antiguas reservas wine.jpg|thumb|Chile is the world's fifth largest [[Wine#Exporting countries|exporter of wine]] and the [[Wine#Production|eighth largest producer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2010/06/25/chile-ranks-fifth-globally-in-wine-exports-and-eighth-in-production|title=Chile ranks fifth globally in wine exports and eighth in production|work=[[Santiago Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;.]]
2006 was a record year for Chilean trade. Total trade registered a 31% increase over 2005. During 2006, exports of goods and services totaled US $58 billion, an increase of 41%. This figure was somewhat distorted by the skyrocketing price of copper. In 2006, copper exports reached a historical high of US $33.3 billion. Imports totaled US $35 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the previous year. Chile thus recorded a positive trade balance of US $23 billion in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

The main destinations for Chilean exports were the Americas (US $39 billion), Asia (US $27.8 billion) and Europe (US $22.2 billion). Seen as shares of Chile's export markets, 42% of exports went to the Americas, 30% to Asia and 24% to Europe. Within Chile's diversified network of trade relationships, its most important partner remained the United States. Total trade with the U.S. was US $14.8 billion in 2006. Since the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement went into effect on January 1, 2004, U.S.-Chilean trade has increased by 154%. Internal Government of Chile figures show that even when factoring out inflation and the recent high price of copper, bilateral trade between the U.S. and Chile has grown over 60% since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

Total trade with Europe also grew in 2006, expanding by 42%. The Netherlands and Italy were Chile's main European trading partners. Total trade with Asia also grew significantly at nearly 31%. Trade with Korea and Japan grew significantly, but China remained Chile's most important trading partner in Asia. Chile's total trade with China reached U.S. $8.8 billion in 2006, representing nearly 66% of the value of its trade relationship with Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

The growth of exports in 2006 was mainly caused by a strong increase in sales to the United States, the Netherlands, and Japan. These three markets alone accounted for an additional US $5.5 billion worth of Chilean exports. Chilean exports to the United States totaled US $9.3 billion, representing a 37.7% increase compared to 2005 (US $6.7 billion). Exports to the European Union were US $15.4 billion, a 63.7% increased compared to 2005 (US $9.4 billion). Exports to Asia increased from US $15.2 billion in 2005 to US $19.7 billion in 2006, a 29.9% increase.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

During 2006, Chile imported US $26 billion from the Americas, representing 54% of total imports, followed by Asia at 22%, and Europe at 16%. Mercosur members were the main suppliers of imports to Chile at US $9.1 billion, followed by the United States with US $5.5 billion and the European Union with US $5.2 billion. From Asia, China was the most important exporter to Chile, with goods valued at US $3.6 billion. Year-on-year growth in imports was especially strong from a number of countries-Ecuador (123.9%), Thailand (72.1%), Korea (52.6%), and China (36.9%).&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

Chile's overall trade profile has traditionally been dependent upon copper exports. The state-owned firm CODELCO is the world's largest copper-producing company, with recorded copper reserves of 200 years. Chile has made an effort to expand nontraditional exports. The most important non-mineral exports are forestry and wood products, fresh fruit and processed food, fishmeal and seafood, and [[Chilean wine|wine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

===Trade agreements===
[[Image:Chile FTA.png|thumb|Nations that have an FTA with Chile appear in dark blue, those that have not ratified a negotiated FTA in light blue, and those in FTA negotiations in purple. Chile is in red.]]
Over the last several years, Chile has signed FTAs with the European Union, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, China, and Japan. It reached a partial trade agreement with India in 2005 and began negotiations for a full-fledged FTA with India in 2006. Chile conducted trade negotiations in 2007 with Australia, Malaysia, and Thailand, as well as with China to expand an existing agreement beyond just trade in goods. Chile concluded FTA negotiations with Australia and an expanded agreement with China in 2008. The members of the P4 (Chile, Singapore, New Zealand, and Brunei) also plan to conclude a chapter on finance and investment in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

Successive Chilean governments have actively pursued trade-liberalizing agreements. During the 1990s, Chile signed [[free trade agreement]]s (FTA) with Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Chile also concluded preferential trade agreements with Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. An association agreement with Mercosur-Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay-went into effect in October 1996. Continuing its export-oriented development strategy, Chile completed landmark free trade agreements in 2002 with the European Union and South Korea. Chile, as a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) organization, is seeking to boost commercial ties to Asian markets. To that end, it has signed trade agreements in recent years with New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, India, China, and most recently Japan. In 2007, Chile held trade negotiations with Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, and China. In 2008, Chile hopes to conclude an FTA with Australia, and finalize an expanded agreement (covering trade in services and investment) with China. The P4 (Chile, Singapore, New Zealand, and Brunei) also plan to expand ties through adding a finance and investment chapter to the existing P4 agreement. Chile's trade talks with Malaysia and Thailand are also scheduled to continue in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

After two years of negotiations, the United States and Chile signed an agreement in June 2003 that will lead to completely duty-free bilateral trade within 12 years. The U.S.-Chile FTA entered into force January 1, 2004, following approval by the U.S. and Chilean congresses. The bilateral FTA has inaugurated greatly expanded U.S.-Chilean trade ties, with total bilateral trade jumping by 154% during the FTA's first three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

Chile unilaterally lowered its across-the-board import tariff for all countries with which it does not have a trade agreement to 6% in 2003. Higher effective tariffs are charged only on imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar as a result of a system of import price bands. The price bands were ruled inconsistent with Chile's [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) obligations in 2002, and the government has introduced legislation to modify them. Under the terms of the U.S.-Chile FTA, the price bands will be completely phased out for U.S. imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar within 12 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

Chile is a strong proponent of pressing ahead on negotiations for a [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA) and is active in the WTO's [[Doha Development Round|Doha round of negotiations]], principally through its membership in the [[G20 developing nations|G-20]] and [[Cairns Group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt;

==Issues==
Unemployment hovered at 8%-10% after the start of the economic slowdown in 1999, above the 7% average for the 1990s. Unemployment finally dipped to 7.8% in 2006, and continued to fall in 2007, averaging 6.8% monthly (up to August).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://si2.bcentral.cl/Basededatoseconomicos/951_417.asp?m=EMP03&amp;f=M&amp;i=E|title=Chilean Central Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wages have risen faster than inflation as a result of higher productivity, boosting national [[standard of living|living standards]]. The percentage of Chileans with household incomes below the [[poverty line]] – defined as twice the cost of satisfying a person's minimal nutritional needs – fell from 45.1% in 1987 to 13.7% in 2006, according to government polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trabajoyequidad.cl/documentos/temp/TP-825-CASEN%202006%20en%20profundidad-22-06-2007.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071025021053/http://www.trabajoyequidad.cl/documentos/temp/TP-825-CASEN+2006+en+profundidad-22-06-2007.pdf|archivedate=2007-10-25|work=Libertad y Desarrollo|title=Casen 2006 en profundidad|accessdate=2007-10-22|date=2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics in Chile, however, argue that poverty figures are considerably higher than those officially published. (The government constructs the poverty line based on an outdated 1987 household consumption poll, instead of more recent polls from 1997 or 2007). According to these critics who use data from the 1997 poll, the poverty rate rises to 29%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economiaynegocios.cl/noticias/noticias.asp?id=35048|publisher=El Mercurio|title=Una muy necesaria corrección: Hay cuatro millones de pobres en Chile|date=2007-10-14|accessdate=2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the relative yardstick favoured in many European countries, 27% of Chileans would be poor, according to Juan Carlos Feres of the [[ECLAC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=The Economist|title=Destitute no more|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9645174|accessdate=2007-10-22|date=2007-08-16}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Total [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) was only $3.4 billion in 2006, up 52% from a poor performance in 2005. However, 80% of FDI continues to go to only four sectors: electricity, gas, water and mining. Much of the jump in FDI in 2006 was also the result of acquisitions and mergers, but has done little to create new employment in Chile.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The percent of total income earned by the richest 20% of the Chilean population in 2000 was 61.0% of [[GDP]], while the percent of total income earned by the poorest 20% of the Chilean population was 3.3% of [[GDP]].&lt;ref name=ECO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthtrends.wri.org/pdf_library/country_profiles/eco_cou_152.pdf |title=eco_cou_152.xls |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chile's [[Gini Coefficient]] in 2003 (53.8) has slightly changed in comparison with the value in 1995 (56.4). In 2005 the 10% poorest among the Chileans received 1.2% of [[GNP]] (2000 = 1.4%), while the 10% richest received 47% of [[GNP]] (2000 = 46%).&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/chile/csp/07_13_en.pdf |title=Document of Strategy Chile |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transport''' in [[Chile]] is mostly by road. The south of the country is not connected to central Chile by road, except through [[Argentina]], and water transport also plays a part there.  The railways were historically important in Chile, but now play a relatively small part in the country's transport system.  Because of the country's geography and long distances between major cities, aviation is also important.

== Road transport ==
=== Highways ===
*''total:'' 79,800&amp;nbsp;km
*''paved:'' 41,012&amp;nbsp;km
*''unpaved:'' 38,788&amp;nbsp;km (1996 est.)

*[[Chile Highway 5]]
*[[Chile Highway 7]]
*[[Route 9-CH|Chile Highway 9]]
*[[Chile Highway 68]]
*[[Route 181-CH|Chile Highway 181]]

=== Freeways ===

*[[Chile Freeway 5]]
*[[Chile Freeway 68]]
*[[Chile Autopista del Sol]]
*[[Chile Autopista del Itata]]

=== Buses ===
[[Image:Transantiago bus articulado.jpg|thumb|right|Transantiago, Santiago's public bus system.]]
Buses are now the main means of long distance transportation in Chile, following the decline of the rail network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omnilineas.cl/comparison/index.html Omnilineas website]&lt;/ref&gt;  The bus system covers the whole country, from [[Arica, Chile|Arica]] to [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] (a 30 hour journey) and from Santiago to [[Punta Arenas]] (about 40 hours, with a change at [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]]).  There are also international services to most other countries in South America. Longer-distance services are mostly on ''semi-cama'' (reclining seat) or ''cama'' (sleeper) buses, often double deck.

[[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] began its public bus system [[Transantiago]] in 2007.
[[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]]'s &quot;[[Bio Bus]]&quot; integrates with the electric train, [[Biotren]], and is based on a dedicated right of way for buses.

== Railways ==
[[Rail transport in Chile]]

*''total:'' 6,782&amp;nbsp;km
*''[[broad gauge]]:'' 3,743&amp;nbsp;km {{RailGauge|66}} [[Track gauge|gauge]] (1,653&amp;nbsp;km electrified)
*''[[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]]'': 116&amp;nbsp;km {{RailGauge|42}} [[Cape gauge|gauge]]; 2,923&amp;nbsp;km {{RailGauge|1}} [[Meter gauge|gauge]] (40&amp;nbsp;km electrified) (1995)
*''[[standard gauge]]:'' {{RailGauge|sg}} about 40&amp;nbsp;km from [[Arica, Chile|Arica]] to [[Tacna]], [[Peru]]

Not all lines connect.

Chile's railways (except for a few dedicated industrial lines
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Automation gets the most out of mining railway infrastructure | date=2006-04-01 | url =http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//automation-gets-the-most-out-of-mining-railway-infrastructure.html | work =[[Railway Gazette International]] | pages = |  author=Thomas Salt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
) are operated by the state owned company ''[[Empresa de los Ferrocarriles del Estado]]'' (EFE), which completed a major investment programme in 2005.&lt;ref name=Kolodziejski&gt;{{cite news | title= Record investment boosts EFE's passenger business | publisher = ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'' | date=2006-04-01 | author=John Kolodziejski | url = http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//record-investment-boosts-efes-passenger-business.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The rail system once served the entire country, running rail lines from Arica in the north to Puerto Montt in the south. Due partly to the nature of the terrain and evolution in transportation systems, rail travel has suffered greatly at the hands of bus and air competition. The train usually takes longer to reach a destination than a bus, and the comfort is comparable. Prices also tend to be uncompetitive.  Rail freight transport has also suffered at the hands of the trucking industry and will continue to do so due to the immense leverage the truck driver's union can bring to bear if they were to feel threatened. 

The [[Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia]] is a metre gauge railway in the north of the country.  It was originally constructed in {{RailGauge|30}} gauge.

The northern rail line out of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] is now disused past the intersection with the [[Valparaíso]] line. Until there it is used nearly exclusively for freight. Although the rest of the northern line is still in place, it is in a state of serious disrepair.

The southern line runs as far as [[Puerto Montt]] and is electrified as far as the city of [[Temuco]], from where diesel locomotives are used.  Due to lack of budget and care, the 389&amp;nbsp;km Temuco to Puerto Montt section was abandoned in 1992 but after a $44m upgrade it has been back in use since 6 December 2005 with daily service between Victoria (north of Temuco) and Puerto Montt; today, however only the service between Victoria and Temuco still operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Passengers return to Puerto Montt | publisher = ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'' | date=2006-01-01 | url = http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//passengers-return-to-puerto-montt.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work to build/restore(?) the [[Trans-Andean Railways|South Trans-Andean Railway]] link between [[Zapala]], Argentina and [[Lonquimay]], Chile was underway in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Railway Journal|IRJ]] March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Possible [[break-of-gauge]]. Possible [[rack railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=IIRSA | publisher = ''Initiative For Regional Infrastructure Integration In South America'' | date=2005-09-01 | url = http://www.iadb.org/biz/ppt/092305tuliod.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Construction was undertaken by Patagonia Ferrocanal SA, formed and funded by the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Work starts on trans-Andean link | publisher = ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'' | date=2005-02-01 |url = http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//work-starts-on-trans-andean-link.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first 7&amp;nbsp;km was completed by January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Finance | publisher = ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'' | date=2006-01-01 | url = http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//finance-22.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been repeated case studies regarding the installation of a high speed line between the cities of Valparaíso and Santiago, some even considering maglev trains, but no serious action has ever been taken on the matter.

'''[[Chile]]'s [[armed forces]]''' are subject to [[civilian control of the military|civilian control]] exercised by the president through the Minister of Defense. Military service of 12 to 24 months is mandatory for all male citizens upon turning 18. This [[conscript]]ion service can be postponed for educational or religious reasons. In recent years and after several major reequipment programs, the Chilean Armed Forces have become one of the most technologically advanced and professional armed forces of [[South America]].

==Structure==
===Army===
{{main|Chilean Army}}
The current commander-in-chief of the [[Chilean Army]] is ''General de Ejército'' Sr. Juan Miguel Fuente-Alba Poblete. The 45,000-person army is organized in seven divisions and one air brigade. The army operates German Leopard 1 and 2 tanks as its main battle tanks. The recent purchase of 140 second-hand Leopard 2A4s from the German army is now being delivered.

===Navy===
{{main|Chilean Navy}}
Admiral Edmundo González Robles directs the 25,000-person [[Chilean Navy]], including 4,800 Marines. Of the fleet of 66 surface vessels, eight are major combatant ships and they are based in [[Valparaíso]]. The navy operates its own aircraft for transport and patrol; there are no fighters or bomber aircraft but they have attack helicopters. The Navy also operates four submarines based in [[Talcahuano]].

===Air Force===
{{main|Chilean Air Force}}
Gen. Jorge Rojas Avila heads 11,000 strong [[Chilean Air Force]]. Air assets are distributed among five air brigades headquartered in [[Iquique]], [[Antofagasta]], [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Puerto Montt]], and [[Punta Arenas]]. The Air Force also operates an airbase on [[King George Island (Antarctica)|King George Island]], Antarctica.
{{Chilean Armed Forces}}

===Carabineros de Chile===
'''Carabineros de Chile''' are the uniformed [[Chile]]an national [[police]] force and [[gendarmery]], created on April 27, 1927. Their mission is to maintain order and create public respect for the laws of the country. They depend on the ''Ministerio de Defensa Nacional'' (Ministry of National Defense) through the Undersecretary of Carabiniers and the ''Ministerio del Interior'' (Ministry of the Interior). The current mission of the &quot;Carabineros&quot; is to maintain or re-establish order and security in Chilean society through civic education, service to the community, police work, and in a war situation, to act as a paramilitary force (all their members have military training). Under the current [[Constitution of Chile|Chilean constitution]] the Carabineros are integrated directly into the armed forces in a state of emergency to better guarantee order. They also have a [[SWAT]]-kind special forces for counter operations called [[GOPE]] (''Grupo de Operaciones Policiales Especiales'' - Special police operations Group). There is also an [[Elite#Elite_military|Elite]] [[Corps]] in charge of security in the [[La Moneda]] Palace and of the [[President of Chile|President]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Chile}}
Since its return to democracy in 1990, Chile has been an active participant in the international political arena.{{Clarify|date=October 2009}} Chile assumed a two-year non-permanent position on the [[UN Security Council]] in January 2003 and is an active member of the UN family of agencies, serving as a member of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Commission on Human Rights]] and participating in UN peacekeeping activities. Chile hosted the second [[Summit of the Americas]] in 1998, was the chair of the [[Rio Group]] in 2001, hosted the Defense Ministerial of the Americas in 2002, and the [[APEC]] summit and related meetings in 2004. In 2005 hosted the [[Community of Democracies]] ministerial conference. An associate member of [[Mercosur]] and a full member of APEC. The [[OECD]] agreed to invite Chile to be among four countries to open discussions in becoming an official member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chileusafta.com/noticia%2047.htm Economic Department - Embassy of Chile in the United States of America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Chile and has been an important actor on international economic issues and hemispheric free trade. The Chilean Government has diplomatic relations with most countries.

==Diplomatic relations==
[[File:Foreign relations of Chile.svg|thumb|Status of the foreign relations of Chile around the world.]]
Chile does not currently maintain diplomatic relations with [[Benin]], [[Bhutan]], [[Bolivia]], [[Burundi]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], the [[Comoros]], [[Djibouti]], [[Eritrea]], [[Gambia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Niger]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Somalia]], [[Togo]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], or [[Yemen]]. Regarding [[Western Sahara]], Chile has sent contradictory comments. Chile's Senate speaker Sergio Romero has said that Chile does not recognize [[Western Sahara]]'s independence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.map.ma/eng/sections/politics/chile_s_senate_speak/view] {{Dead link|date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moroccotimes.com/news/article.asp?idr=2&amp;id=7019&lt;/ref&gt; but Chile's Ministry of Foreign Relations website includes Western Sahara as an independent country with which Chile has no diplomatic relations.

===Argentina===
{{Main|Argentina-Chile relations}}
Chile and Argentina were close allies during the wars of independence against Spain. Argentine General [[José de San Martín]] crossed the Andes with Chilean independence hero [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] and together they defeated the Spaniards. However, after independence relations soured. This was primarily due to a border dispute: both nations claimed the totality of the [[Patagonia]] region.

Attempts to clear up the dispute were unsuccessful until 1881, when Chile was at war with both Bolivia and Peru. In order to avoid fighting Argentina as well, Chilean President [[Aníbal Pinto]] authorized his envoy, [[Diego Barros Arana]] to hand over as much territory as was needed to avoid Argentina siding with Bolivia and Peru. Barros succeeded in his mission: Argentina received the east Patagonia and Chile the Strait of Magellan. 

However, border disputes continued. In 1902, war was again avoided when British King [[Edward VII]] agreed to mediate between the two nations. He established the current border in the Patagonia region.

The [[Beagle conflict]] began to brew in the 1960s, when Argentina began to claim that the [[Beagle Channel cartography since 1881|Picton, Lennox and Nueva]] islands in the [[Beagle Channel]] were rightfully hers. In 1971 Chile and Argentina signed an agreement formally submitting the Beagle Channel issue to binding [[Beagle Channel Arbitration]]. On May 2, 1977 the court ruled that the islands and all adjacent formations belonged to Chile. See the [http://untreaty.un.org/cod/riaa/cases/vol_XXI/53-264.pdf Report and decision of the Court of Arbitration].

On 25 January 1978 the Argentina military junta led by General [[Jorge Videla]] declared the award fundamentally null and intensified their claim over the islands. On 22. December 1978, Argentina started&lt;ref&gt;See Argentine newspaper [http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/1998/12/20/i-00401e.htm Clarín] of Buenos Aires, 20 December 1998&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Operation Soberania]] over the disputed islands, but the invasion was halted due to:&lt;ref&gt;See Alejandro Luis Corbacho ''&quot;Predicting the probability of war during brinkmanship crisis: The Beagle and the Malvinas conflicts&quot;'' http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1016843 (p.45)&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''The newspaper Clarín explained some years later that such caution was based, in part, on military concerns. In order to achieve a victory, certain objectives had to be reached before the seventh day after the attack. Some military leaders considered this not enough time due to the difficulty involved in transportation through the passes over the Andean Mountains.''
and in cite 46:
: ''According to Clarín, two consequences were feared. First, those who were dubious feared a possible regionalization of the conflict. Second, as a consequence, the conflict could acquire great power proportions. In the first case decisionmakers speculated that Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Brazil might intervene. Then the great powers could take sides. In this case, the resolution of the conflict would depend not on the combatants, but on the countries that supplied the weapons.''

In December that year, moments before Videla signed a declaration of war against Chile, [[Pope John Paul II]] agreed to mediate between the two nations. The Pope's envoy, [[Antonio Samoré]], successfully averted war and proposed a new definitive boundary in which the three disputed islands would remain Chilean.  Chile immediately accepted this decision, but Argentina still disliked and avoided acceptance until after the lost [[Falklands War]] in [[1982]]. Both agreed to Samoré's proposal and signed the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]], ending that dispute.

In the 1990s, under presidents [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle|Frei]] and [[Carlos Menem|Menem]] both countries solved almost all of the remaining border disputes during bilateral talks. They also agreed to submit [[Laguna del Desierto]] to international arbitration in 1994. Almost the entire disputed area was awarded to Argentina. 

The last border dispute are {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}. in the [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field‎]] from [[Mount Fitzroy]] to [[Mount Daudet]] that is still officially undefined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.difrol.cl/acuerdo_de_hielos.htm 1998 | title= Border agreement between Chile and Argentina| accessdate=2006-10-21|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070117021516/http%3A//www.difrol.cl/acuerdo_de_hielos.htm |archivedate = January 17, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.turistel.cl/v2/secciones/mapas/informacion/ruteros/aisen.htm  | title=Map showing border between Chile and Argentina (partly undefined) | accessdate=2006-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, however, a tourist map was published in Argentina placing the disputed region within the borders of that country. Chile filed an official complaint, sparking renewed efforts to settle the dispute which the Argentine government supports and urged Chile to finish quick as possible the demarcation of the international border.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/08/30/um/m-01262333.htm Tras la fricción por los Hielos Continentales, la Argentina llama a Chile a demarcar los límites &quot;lo antes posible&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since democratization in the 1980s both countries began a close economic and political integration as Chile became an associated member of [[Mercosur]]. Also both countries practice defense cooperation and friendship policy.

===Bolivia===
{{Main|Bolivia-Chile relations}}
Relations with [[Bolivia]] have been strained ever since the independence wars because of the [[Atacama border dispute]] (Bolivia claims a corridor to the Pacific Ocean). The Spaniards never bothered to definitely establish a border between Chile and Bolivia. Chile claimed its limit with Peru ran through the Loa River and that Bolivia was therefore landlocked, while Bolivia claimed it did have a coast and that the limit with Chile ran along the Salado River. The border remained vague throughout the 19th century. Finally, Bolivia and Chile agreed, in 1866, to allow Bolivia access to the Pacific and that the limit of the two countries would run along the 24th parallel. The area between the 25th and 23rd parallel would remain demilitarized and both nations would be allowed to mine there. It was also agreed that taxes on the exportation of [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]] would not increase.

However, in 1879, Bolivian dictator General [[Hilarión Daza]] increased the taxes on the exportation of saltpeter, violating the 1866 treaty. When Chilean-owned saltpeter companies protested, Daza expropriated their companies and sold them in a [[public auction]]. Daza then put an end to all commerce with Chile and exiled all Chilean residents in Bolivia (the Bolivian port of [[Antofagasta]] had more Chileans than Bolivians). In response, Chile declared war on Bolivia and occupied Bolivia's coast. Peru had, in 1873, signed a secret pact with Bolivia in which the two countries agreed to fight together against any nation that threatened either of them. When Peru refused to be neutral in the conflict between Chile and Bolivia, Chile declared war on Peru. Chile defeated both countries and annexed the coast claimed by Bolivia. This was ratified in a 1904 treaty.  

Diplomatic relations with Bolivia continued to be strained because of Bolivia's continuing aspiration to the sea.  In 1964, Bolivian President [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro]] severed diplomatic relations with Chile.  Generals [[Augusto Pinochet]] and [[Hugo Banzer]] resumed diplomatic relations and attempted to settle territorial disputes.  The secret negotiations started in 1973 and in 1975 diplomatic relations between Chile and Bolivia were established.  That year, Pinochet and Banzer met in the Bolivian border town of Chañaral.  Pinochet agreed to give Bolivia a small strip of land running between the Chilean city of [[Arica]] and the [[Peru]]vian border.  However the Treaty of Lima between Peru and Chile specified that Chile must consult Peru before granting any land to a third party in the area of [[Tarapacá Region|Tarapacá]].  Peruvian President General [[Francisco Morales Bermúdez]] did not agree with the Chañara proposal and instead drafted his own proposal, in which the three nations would share administration of the port of Arica and the sea immediately in front of it.  Pinochet refused this agreement, and Banzer broke ties with Chile again in 1978.  The failure of the Chañaral accords was one of the reasons of Banzer's downfall that very year. 

Chile and Bolivia maintain consular relations, and appear to have become friendlier. Former Chilean President [[Ricardo Lagos]] attended the inauguration of current Bolivian President [[Evo Morales]]. Morales has repeatedly announced his intention to establish diplomatic relations with Chile once more, but has still not given up Bolivia's claim to the sea.

===Brazil===
{{Main|Brazil–Chile relations}}

Chile and Brazil have acted numerous times as mediators in international conflicts, such as in the [[Veracruz Incident|1914 diplomatic impasse]] between the United States and Mexico, avoiding a possible [[state of war]] between those two countries. More recently, since the [[2004 Haiti rebellion]], Chile and Brazil have activelly participated in the [[United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti]], which is led by the [[Brazilian Army]]. They are also two of the three most important economies in South America along with [[Argentina]].

===Ecuador===
Chile and Ecuador have been traditional allies due to their conflicts with [[Peru]]. Chile together with the other [[ABC Powers]] and the USA were among the guarantors of the [[Rio Protocol]] that followed the [[Peru-Ecuador War]] in 1942.

===Mexico===
The two nations have maintained relations since the first quarter of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minrel.gov.cl/prontus_biblioarchivo/site/artic/20100524/asocfile/20100524112158/r_chile_mexico.doc Inicio de relaciones diplomáticas entre Chile y México (in Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 1914, Chile and the other [[ABC Powers]] met in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], Canada, to mediate diplomatically to avoid a [[state of war]] between the United States and Mexico over the [[Veracruz Incident]] and the [[Tampico Affair]]. Currently both countries have signed a [[Chile-Mexico Free Trade Agreement|free trade agreement]] that went into effect in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aduana.cl/prontus_aduana_eng/site/artic/20070227/pags/20070227171042.html Free Trade Agreement Chile - Mexico]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peru===
{{Main|Chile-Peru relations}}
Chile and Peru had excellent relations at the time of independence, when Chilean independence hero [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] formed the [[Expedición Libertadora del Perú|Freedom Expedition of Peru]], financed by the Chilean government for the cause of the liberation of the northern neighbour. Chile and Peru participated in a common conflict against Spain, the [[Chincha Islands War]] (1864–1866), despite their causes for war with Spain where different. Despite the Chilean port of [[Valparaíso]] was bombed and mostly destroyed by Spain during the conflict, the combined Peru-Chile fleet managed to defend Chilean territory near Abtao, and the Peruvian defenders of Callao managed to drive back the Spanish attack. In 1873, Peru signed a secret defensive pact with Bolivia in which it agreed to help that nation in case of foreign attack. The moment came in 1879, when Chile declared war on Bolivia. Peru refused to null its defensive pact with Bolivia, and Chile declared war on Peru. The [[War of the Pacific]], as the conflict was called, resulted in a decisive victory for Chile, which managed to reach Lima and occupied Peru for a few years.

In 1883, Chile and Peru signed the Treaty of Ancón in which Peru handed over the Province of [[Tarapacá Province (Peru)|Tarapacá]]. Peru also had to hand over the departments of [[Arica]] and [[Tacna]]. These would remain under Chilean control until a later date, when there would be a plebiscite to decide which nation would maintain control over Arica and Tacna. Chile and Peru, however, were unable to agree on how or when to hold the plebiscite, and in 1929, both countries signed the Treaty of Lima, in which Peru gained Tacna and Chile maintained control of Arica.

Relations have remained sour because of the war. In 1975, both countries were at the brink of war, only a few years before the centennial of the War of the Pacific. The conflict was fueled by ideological disputes: Peruvian General [[Juan Velasco]] was a left-winger while Chilean General [[Augusto Pinochet]] was a right-winger. Velasco,  backed by [[Cuba]], set the date for invasion on August 6, the 150th independence anniversary of Bolivia, and the proposed date when Chile intended to grant this country with a sovereign corridor north of Arica, in former Peruvian territory, transfer not approved by Peru. However, he was successfully dissuaded from starting the invasion on that date by his advisor, General [[Francisco Morales Bermúdez]], whose original family was from the former Peruvian (currently Chilean) region of Tarapacá. Velasco later fell ill and was deposed by a group of generals who proclaimed Morales Bermúdez president on August 28.

Morales Bermúdez assured the Chilean government that Peru had no plans for an invasion despite its tremendous military superiority.  Tensions mounted again when a Chilean spy mission in Peru was discovered. Morales Bermúdez was again able to avert war, despite pressure from Velasco's ultranationalist followers. 

Relations between the two nations have since mostly recovered.  In 2005, the Peruvian Congress unilaterally approved a new law which stated the sea limit with Chile.  Peru's position was that the border has never been fully demarcated, but Chile disagreed reminding on treaties in 1952 and 1954 between the countries, which supposedly defined seaborder. The border problem has still not been solved. However, former Chilean president [[Michelle Bachelet]] and Peru's [[Alan García]] established a positive diplomatic relationship, and it is very unlikely any hostilities will break out because of the dispute.

Nevertheless, in early April 2007, Peruvian nationalistic sectors, mainly represented by left wing ex-presidential candidate [[Ollanta Humala]] decided to congregate at 'hito uno' right at the border with Chile, in a symbolic attempt to claim sovereignty over a maritime area known in Peru as Mar de [[Grau]] (Grau's Sea) just west of the Chilean city of [[Arica]]. Peruvian police stopped a group of nearly 2,000 people just ten kilometers from the border, preventing them from reaching their intended destination. Despite these incidents, the presidents of both Chile and Peru have confirmed their intentions to improve the relationships between the two countries, mainly fueled by the huge amount of commercial exchange between both countries private sectors.

Chile-United States relations have been better in the period 1988 to 2008 than any other time in history. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, The United States government applauded the rebirth of democratic practices in Chile, despite having facilitated the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, the build-up to which included destabilizing the country's economy and politics.

The '''[[National Anthem]] of [[Chile]]''' ({{lang-es|'''Himno Nacional de Chile'''}}) is also known as '''''Canción Nacional''''' (National Song). It has a history of two lyrics and two melodies that made up three different versions. The current version was composed by [[Ramón Carnicer]], with words by [[Eusebio Lillo]], and has six parts plus the chorus.

==First National Anthem==
The first Chilean National Anthem dates back to 1819, when the government called for, on the 19th of July, the creation of music and lyrics for this purpose.

The composer Manuel Robles and the poet Bernardo de Vera y Pintado fulfilled this mandate and their &quot;National Song&quot; debuted on the 20 August 1820 in the Domingo Arteaga theater, although other historians claim that it was played and sung during the festivities of September 1819.

In the beginning, everyone would stand for the song. O'Higgins and Freire listened to it with respect and full of emotion, for they had marched to victory to its tune more than once.

The custom of always singing it at the theater slowly disappeared, until it was ordered that it only be sung at the anniversary of the country.

The doctor Bernardo Vera, known in the history of the independence, was the author of the verses that were sung to Robles' music.

This first hymn was sung until 1828,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalanthems.info/cl-47.htm first hymn original lyric 1819-1947]&lt;/ref&gt; when it was replaced with what is sung today.

==Second National Anthem==
The second Chilean National Anthem was composed by the Spanish composer Ramón Carnicer, when he was exiled in England because of his liberal ideas. Mariano Egaña, Chilean Minister in London, acting on the criticism that Robles' song was receiving, asked Carnicer to compose a new hymn with Bernardo de Vera's original text.

The Spanish musician probably wrote the work by 1827, the date he returned to Barcelona, and his hymn debuted in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], in the Arteaga theater, the 23 December 1828.

Years later, in 1847, the Chilean government entrusted the young poet Eusebio Lillo with a new text that would replace the anti-Spain poem of Vera y Pintado, and after being analyzed by [[Andrés Bello]], retained the original chorus (&quot;''Dulce patria, recibe los votos...''&quot;). The lyrics were slightly revised in 1903.

During the military government (1973–1990) of [[Augusto Pinochet]], the Verse III was officially incorporated because of his praise of the armed forces and the national police (Carabiners). After that, in 1990, it was eliminated from the anthem and only sung in military events as part of the full song. Supporters from the former military regime also sing the anthem with the Verse III in private ceremonies.

In the celebrations marking the return of democracy in March 1990 at Santiago's [[Estadio Nacional de Chile]], the anthem was played in its present melody, raised to F Major (the Royal Musical Official Version of the anthem) which is the original melody of the second anthem by Carnicer, but using the 1847 lyrics as text, save for the original chorus. This is the version played during [[sign-on]] and [[sign-off]] broadcasts of Chilean television stations since 1991

[[Joe Walsh]], famed musician who was part of the United States rock band the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], sang the National Anthem of Chile at a Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim baseball game in 2003.

==Official version lyrics==
Below are the lyrics of the version most often played; it corresponds to Verse V of the full version and the chorus:

The '''Territory of Christmas Island''' is a [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] of [[Australia]] in the [[Indian Ocean]]. It is located {{convert|2600|km|mi}} northwest of the [[Western Australian]] city of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], {{convert|360|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the [[Indonesia]]n capital, [[Jakarta]], and {{convert|975|km|mi|abbr=on}} ENE of the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]].

It has a population of 1,403 residents who live in a number of &quot;settlement areas&quot; on the northern tip of the island: [[Flying Fish Cove]] (also known as Kampong), [[Silver City, Christmas Island|Silver City]], [[Poon Saan]], and Drumsite.

The island’s geographic isolation and history of minimal human disturbance has led to a high level of [[endemism]] among its flora and fauna, which is of significant interest to scientists and naturalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;wilderness society&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.org.au/campaigns/marine/christmas_island/save_ci/|title=Save Christmas Island – Introduction|publisher=The Wilderness Society|accessdate=14 April 2007|date=19 September 2002 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070609110000/http://www.wilderness.org.au/campaigns/marine/christmas_island/save_ci/ |archivedate = June 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 63% of its {{convert|135|km2|mi2}} is an Australian national park.

[[Phosphate]], deposited originally as dead marine organisms (not guano as often thought), has been mined on the island for many years.

==History==
===Discovery===

Captain [[William Mynors]] of the ''Royal Mary'', a [[British East India Company]] vessel, named the island when he sailed past it on Christmas Day in 1643.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/christmas/culture-history/island-history.html|title=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts – Christmas Island History|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=26 April 2009|date=8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island was included on British and Dutch navigation charts as early as the beginning of the seventeenth century, but it was not until 1666 when a map published by Dutch cartographer [[Pieter Goos]] included the island. Goos labelled the island ''Mony'', the meaning of which is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview?pi=nla.map-nk1574-sd&amp;rgn=0.5309855310%2C0.5141004862%2C0.6401856402%2C0.6437601297&amp;cmd=zoomin&amp;width=400&amp;x=200&amp;y=199|title=Digital Collections – Maps – Goos, Pieter, ca. 1616–1675.

Comorin tot aen Iapan|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=26 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; British navigator 
[[William Dampier]], aboard the British ship ''Cygnet'', made the earliest recorded visit to sea round the island in March 1688. He found it uninhabited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Carney |first= Gerard |title= The constitutional systems of the Australian states and territories |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |year= 2006 |isbn= 0521863058 |page=477 |quote= The uninhabited island was named on Christmas Day 1643 by Captain William Mynors as he sailed past, leaving to William Dampier the honour of first landing ashore in 1688.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dampier gave an account of the visit which can be found in his ''Voyages'':{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Dampier was trying to reach [[Cocos]] from [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. His ship was pulled off course in an easterly direction, arriving at Christmas Island 28 days later. Dampier landed at the [[The Dales|Dales]] (on the west coast). Two of his crewmen were the first recorded humans to have set foot on Christmas Island.

[[Daniel Beekman]] made the next recorded visit, chronicled in his 1718 book, ''A Voyage to and from the Island of Borneo, in the East Indies''.

===Exploration and annexation===
[[File:Poonsaan1v2.jpg|thumb|[[Poon Saan]] in the evening]]
[[File:Poonsaan2.jpg|thumb|Poon Saan shops]]
The first attempt at exploring the island was in 1857 by the crew of the ''Amethyst''. They tried to reach the summit of the island, but found the cliffs impassable.

During the [[Challenger expedition|1872–76 ''Challenger'' expedition]] to Indonesia, naturalist Dr John Murray carried out extensive surveys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tourism&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title=History | url=http://www.christmas.net.au/history.html | work=Welcome to Christmas Island | publisher=Christmas Island Tourism Association | accessdate=26 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, Captain Maclear of [[HMS Flying Fish|HMS ''Flying Fish'']], having discovered an anchorage in a bay that he named Flying Fish Cove, landed a party and made a small but interesting collection of the flora and fauna. In the next year, [[Pelham Aldrich]], on board [[HMS Egeria (1873)|HMS ''Egeria'']], visited it for ten days, accompanied by J. J. Lister, who gathered a larger biological and mineralogical collection.

Among the rocks then obtained and submitted to Sir [[John Murray (oceanographer)|John Murray]] for examination were many of nearly pure [[phosphate]] of [[lime (mineral)|lime]], a discovery which led to annexation of the island by the British Crown on 6 June 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tourism&quot; /&gt;

===Settlement and exploitation===
Soon afterwards, a small settlement was established in Flying Fish Cove by [[Clunies-Ross Family|G. Clunies Ross]], the owner of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands (some {{convert|900|km|abbr=off}} to the south west) to collect timber and supplies for the growing industry on Cocos.

Phosphate mining began in the 1890s using [[Indentured servant|indentured]] workers from [[Singapore]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[China]].

The island was administered jointly by the British Phosphate Commissioners and District Officers from the [[United Kingdom]] [[Colonial Office]] through the [[Straits Settlements]], and later the Crown Colony of Singapore.

===Japanese invasion===
From the outbreak of war in [[South East Asia]] in December 1941, Christmas Island was a target for [[Japan]]ese occupation because of its rich [[phosphate]] deposits. A naval gun was installed under a British officer and four NCOs supported by [[India]]n soldiers. The first attack was carried out on 21 January 1942 by the Japanese submarine I-159, which torpedoed a [[Norway|Norwegian]] vessel, the [[HNoMS Eidsvold|Eidsvold]],{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} while it was loading phosphate in Flying Fish Cove. The vessel drifted and eventually sank off West White Beach. Most of the European and Asian staff and their families were evacuated to Perth. In late February and early March 1942, two aerial bombing raids and shelling from a Japanese naval group led the District Officer to hoist the white flag. But after the Japanese naval group sailed away, the British officer raised the [[Union Jack]] once more. During the night of 10–11 March a mutiny of the Indian troops, abetted by the [[Sikh]] policemen, led to the murder of the five British soldiers and the imprisonment of the remaining 21 Europeans. On 31 March, a Japanese fleet of nine vessels arrived and the island was surrendered. A naval brigade, phosphate engineers, and 700 marines came ashore and rounded up the workforce, most of which had fled to the jungle. Sabotaged equipment was repaired and preparations were made to resume the mining and export of phosphate.

Isolated acts of sabotage and the torpedoing of the [[Nissei Maru]] at the wharf on 17 November 1942 meant that only small amounts of phosphate were exported to Japan during the occupation. In November 1943, over 60% of the Island's population was evacuated to [[Surabaya]]n prison camps, leaving a total population of just under 500 Chinese and Malays and 15 Japanese to survive as best they could. In October 1945 [[HMS Rother]] reoccupied Christmas Island.&lt;ref&gt;Public Record Office, England War Office and Colonial Office Correspondence/Straits Settlements&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=J. Pettigrew |title=Christmas Island in World War II |publisher=Australian Territories January 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interviews conduced by J G Hunt with Island residents, 1973–77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence J G Hunt with former Island residents, 1973–79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfer to Australia===
At Australia's request, the United Kingdom transferred sovereignty to Australia; in 1957, the Australian government paid the [[government of Singapore]] £2.9 million in compensation, a figure based mainly on an estimated value of the phosphate forgone by Singapore.

Under Commonwealth Cabinet Decision 1573 of 9 September 1958, [[D. E. Nickels]] was appointed the first Official Representative of the new Territory. In a Media Statement on 5 August 1960, the Minister for Territories, [[Paul Hasluck]], said, among other things, that &quot;His extensive knowledge of the Malay language and the customs of the Asian people... has proved invaluable in the inauguration of Australian administration... During his two years on the Island he had faced unavoidable difficulties... and constantly sought to advance the Island's interests.&quot;  [[John William Stokes]] succeeded him and served from 1 October 1960 to 12 June 1966.  On his departure he was lauded by all sectors of the Island community. In 1968 the Official Secretary was re-titled an Administrator in 1968 and, since 1997, Christmas Island and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] together are called the [[Australian Indian Ocean Territories]] and share a single Administrator resident on Christmas Island. A list and timetable of the Island's leaders since its settlement is at the World Statesmen site&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = World Statesmen | url = http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Christmas_Island.html | title = Christmas Island}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Neale (1988) and Bosman (1993).

The 2004 earthquake and tsunami centered off the western shore of Sumatra, Indonesia, resulted in no reported casualties, but some swimmers were swept hundreds of feet out to sea for a time before being swept back in.&lt;ref&gt;Main article: [[Countries affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refugee and immigration detention==
From the late 1980s and early 1990s, boats carrying asylum seekers and mainly departing from Indonesia landed on the island. In 2001, Christmas Island was the site of the [[Tampa affair|''Tampa'' controversy]], in which the Australian government stopped a Norwegian ship, [[MV Tampa|MV ''Tampa'']], from disembarking 438 rescued asylum seekers at Christmas Island.  The ensuing standoff and the associated political reactions in Australia were a major issue in the [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001 Australian federal election]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Another boatload of asylum seekers was taken from Christmas Island to [[Papua New Guinea]] for processing, after it was claimed that many of the adult asylum seekers [[Children overboard affair|threw their children into the water]], apparently in protest at being turned away. This was later proven to be false. Many of the refugees were subsequently accepted by New Zealand.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The former [[Howard Government]] later secured the passage of legislation through the [[Australian Parliament]] which excised Christmas Island from [[Australian migration zone|Australia's migration zone]], meaning that [[asylum seekers]] arriving on Christmas Island could not automatically apply to the Australian government for refugee status.  This allowed the [[Royal Australian Navy]] to relocate them to other countries (Papua New Guinea's [[Manus Island]], and [[Nauru]]) as part of the so-called [[Pacific Solution]]. In 2006 an [[Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre|Immigration Detention Centre]], containing approximately 800 beds, was constructed on the island for the Department of Immigration. Originally estimated to cost $210 million, the final cost was over $400 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Detention on Christmas Island  | url=http://www.amnesty.org.au/refugees/comments/20442/ | publisher=Amnesty International | date=10 March 2009&lt;!--, 01:15PM --&gt;| accessdate=26 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Rudd Government]] announced plans to decommission the Manus Island and Nauru centres; processing would then occur on Christmas Island itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Public release of costing | url=http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.electioncostings.gov.au%2F__data%2Fassets%2Ffile%2F0007%2F64519%2FALP032_Public_Release_of_Costing_-_Savings_for_Labors_Better_Priorities_-_Close_Nauru_and_Manus_Island_detention_centres.rtf&amp;ei=RbnzSe-mJ4S8tgO4u93zCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFosUBX9_Tb45GmYjopv4hufA5cuA&amp;sig2=_0Lp0-EyWjC6jlgPc4-2Mg | publisher=electioncostings.gov.au | date=15 November 2007 | accessdate=26 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, around 50 asylum seekers [[2010 Christmas Island boat disaster|died]] off the coast of the island as the boat they were travelling on crashed into the rocks off Flying Fish Cove.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=They had no chance | url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/they-were-screaming-help-help-help-20101215-18ya5.html | date=15 December 2010 | accessdate=15 December 2010 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | first1=Kirsty | last1=Needham | first2=Andrew | last2=Stevenson | first3=Tom | last3=Allard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = ABC | place = AU | section = News | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/02/09/3134412.htm?section=justin | date = 2011-2-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
As of 2006, the estimated population is 1,493. (The Australian Bureau of Statistics reports a population of 1,508 as of the 2001 Census.)

The ethnic composition is 70% [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] (mainly [[Hokkien]]) 20% European and 10% [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]]. Religions practised on Christmas Island include [[Buddhism]] 67%{{fact|date=April 2011}}, Christianity 11%, [[Islam]] 10% and others 2%. English is the official language, but [[Chinese languages]] and [[Malay language|Malay]] are also spoken.

==Postage stamps==
{{Main|Postage stamps and postal history of Christmas Island}}

A postal agency was opened on the island in 1901 and sold [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Straits Settlements|stamps of the Strait Settlements]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GSM 102008&quot;&gt;Richard Breckon, &quot;Christmas Island's Stamps and Postal History: 50 Years of Australian Administration&quot;, ''Gibbons Stamp Monthly'', October 2008, pp. 81–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Japanese Occupation (1942–45), postage stamps of the [[British Military Administration]] in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] were in use, then stamps of [[Singapore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;StG Aus&quot;&gt;''Commonwealth Stamp Catalogue Australia'', Stanley Gibbons, 4th edition, 2007, pp. 104–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, the island received its own postage stamps after being put under Australian custody. It had a large philatelic and postal independence, managed first by the Phosphate Commission (1958–1969) and then by the Island's Administration (1969–93).&lt;ref name=&quot;GSM 102008&quot; /&gt; This ended on 2 March 1993 when [[Australia Post]] became the island's postal operator: stamps of Christmas Island can be used in Australia and Australian stamps in the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;StG Aus&quot; /&gt;

==Government==
Christmas Island is a non-self governing territory of Australia, currently administered by the [[Attorney-General's Department]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AussieAG&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| author =  First Assistant Secretary, Territories Division | title = Territories of Australia | url = http://www.ag.gov.au/territories | publisher= Attorney-General's Department | date= 30 January 2008 | accessdate = 7 February 2008 | quote = The Federal Government, through the Attorney-General's Department administers Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Coral Sea Islands, Jervis Bay, and Norfolk Island as Territories. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Administration was carried out by the [[Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government (Australia)|Department of Transport and Regional Services]] before 29 November 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOTARS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| author =  Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government | title = Territories of Australia | url = http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/territories/index.aspx | accessdate = 7 February 2008 | quote = As part of the Machinery of Government Changes following the Federal Election on 29 November 2007, administrative responsibility for Territories has been transferred to the Attorney General's Department. |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071216154140/http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/territories/index.aspx |archivedate = December 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal system is under the authority of the [[Governor-General of Australia]] and Australian law. An [[Administrator (Australia)|Administrator]]  appointed by the Governor-General represents the [[Queen of Australia|monarch]] and Australia.

The Australian Government provides Commonwealth-level government services through the Christmas Island Administration and the [[Department of Infrastructure]]. There is no state government; instead, state government type services are provided by contractors, including departments of the Western Australian Government, with the costs met by the Australian (Commonwealth) Government. A unicameral [[Shire of Christmas Island]] with nine seats provides local government services and is elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. Elections are held every two years, with half the members standing for election.

Christmas Island residents who are Australian citizens also vote in Commonwealth (federal) elections. Christmas Island residents are represented in the House of Representatives through the [[Northern Territory]] [[Division of Lingiari]] and in the Senate by Northern Territory Senators.

In early 1986, the Christmas Island Assembly held a design competition for an island flag; the winning design was adopted as the informal flag of the territory for over a decade, and in 2002 it was made the official [[flag of Christmas Island]].

==Economy==
[[Phosphate]] mining had been the only significant economic activity, but in December 1987 the Australian government closed the mine. In 1991, the mine was reopened by a consortium which included many of the former mine workers as shareholders. With the support of the government, the $34 million [[Christmas Island Resort|Christmas Island Casino and Resort]] opened in 1993, but was closed in 1998 and has not re-opened. The Australian Government in 2001 agreed to support the creation of a commercial [[spaceport]] on the island, however this has not yet been constructed, and appears that it will not proceed in the future.  The Howard Government built a temporary immigration detention centre on the island in 2001 and planned to replace it with a larger, modern facility located at North West Point until Howard's defeat in the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 elections]].

==Geography==
[[File:Map of Christmas Island 1976.jpg|thumb|left|320px|Christmas Island]]
Located at {{Coord|10|30|S|105|40|E|}}, the island is a [[quadrilateral]] with hollowed sides, about {{convert|19|km|mi}} in greatest length and {{convert|14.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} in extreme breadth. The total land area is {{convert|135|km2|mi2}}, with {{convert|138.9|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline.

The climate is [[tropical]], with heat and humidity moderated by trade winds. Steep cliffs along much of the coast rise abruptly to a central plateau. Elevation ranges from sea level to {{convert|361|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at [[Murray Hill, Christmas Island|Murray Hill]]. The island is mainly [[tropical rainforest]], of which 63% is National Park.

The narrow fringing [[reef]] surrounding the island can be a maritime hazard.

Christmas Island is {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Indonesia and about {{convert|2600|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of Perth.

Christmas Island is of immense scientific value as it was uninhabited until the late 19th century, so many unique species of [[fauna]] and [[flora]] exist which have evolved independently of human interference.  Two-thirds of the island has been declared a [[National Park]] which is managed by the Australian Department of Environment and Heritage through Parks Australia.

===Flora===
The dense [[rainforest]] has  evolved in the deep soils of the [[plateau]] and on the terraces. The forests are dominated by 25 tree species. [[Fern]]s, [[orchid]]s and [[vine]]s grow on the branches in the humid atmosphere beneath the [[canopy (forest)|canopy]]. The 135 plant species include at least eighteen which are found nowhere else.

Christmas Island’s [[endemism|endemic]] plants include the [[tree]]s ''[[Arenga listeri]]'', ''[[Pandanus elatus]]'' and ''[[Dendrocnide peltata]]'' var. ''murrayana''; the [[shrub]]s ''[[Abutilon listeri]]'', ''[[Colubrina pedunculata]]'', ''[[Grewia insularis]]'' and ''[[Pandanus christmatensis]]''; the [[vine]]s ''[[Hoya aldrichii]]'' and ''[[Zehneria alba]]''; the [[herbaceous plant|herb]]s ''[[Asystasia alba]]'', ''[[Dicliptera maclearii]]'' and ''[[Peperomia rossii]]''; the [[grass]] ''[[Ischaemum nativitatis]]''; the [[fern]] ''[[Asplenium listeri]]''; and the [[orchid]]s ''[[Brachypeza archytas]]'', ''[[Flickingeria nativitatis]]'', ''[[Phreatia listeri]]'' and ''[[Zeuxine exilis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Christmas Island National Park: Flora.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
Two species of native rats, the [[Maclear's Rat|Maclear's]] and [[Bulldog Rat]], have become extinct since the island was settled. The [[Christmas Island Shrew|endemic shrew]] has not been seen since the mid 1980s and may be already extinct, and the [[Christmas Island Pipistrelle]], a small bat, is critically endangered and possibly also extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://environment.gov.au/parks/index.html |title=Parks Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual [[Christmas Island red crab|red crab]] mass migration (around 100 million animals) to the sea to spawn has been called one of the wonders of the natural world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ga.gov.au/education/facts/dimensions/externalterr/christma.htm |title=Geoscience Australia on Christmas Island}}&lt;/ref&gt; and takes place each year around November; after the start of the [[wet season]] and in synchronisation with the cycle of the [[moon]].

The land crabs and sea birds are the most noticeable animals on the island. Twenty terrestrial and intertidal species of crab (of which thirteen are regarded as true land crabs, only dependent on the ocean for larval development) have been described. Robber crabs, known elsewhere as [[coconut crab]]s, also exist in large numbers on the island.

Christmas Island is a focal point for sea birds of various species. Eight species or [[subspecies]] of sea birds nest on the island. The most numerous is the [[Red-footed Booby]] that nests in colonies, in trees, on many parts of the shore terrace. The widespread [[Brown Booby]] nests on the ground near the edge of the seacliff and inland cliffs. [[Abbott's Booby]] (listed as [[endangered]]) nests on tall emergent trees of the western, northern and southern plateau rainforest. The Christmas Island forest is the only nesting habitat of the Abbott's Booby left in the world. The [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] [[Christmas Island Frigatebird]] (listed as endangered) has nesting areas on the north-eastern shore terraces and the more widespread [[Great Frigatebird]]s nest in semi-deciduous trees on the shore terrace with the greatest concentrations being in the North West and South Point areas. The [[Common Noddy]] and two species of bosuns or [[tropicbird]]s, with their brilliant gold or silver plumage and distinctive streamer tail feathers, also nest on the island.

Of the ten native land birds and shorebirds, seven are endemic species or subspecies. This includes the [[Christmas Island Thrush]], and the [[Christmas Island Imperial-pigeon]]. Some 86 migrant bird species have been recorded as visitors to the Island.

==Communications==
===Telecommunications===
Telephone services are provided by [[Telstra]] and are a part of the Australian network with the same prefix as Western Australia (08). A [[GSM]] mobile telephone system replaced the old analogue network in February 2005. Four free-to-air television stations from Australia are broadcast (ABC, SBS, GWN and WIN) in the same time-zone as Perth. Radio broadcasts from Australia include [[Radio National|ABC Radio National]], [[ABC Kimberley]], [[Triple J]] and [[Red FM (Australia)|Red FM]]. All services are provided by satellite links from the mainland. [[Broadband internet]] became available to subscribers in urban areas in mid 2005 through the local internet service provider, [[Christmas Island Internet Administration|CIIA]] (formerly dotCX).

Christmas Island, due to its close proximity to Australia's northern neighbours, falls within many of the more 'interesting' satellite footprints throughout the region. This results in ideal conditions for receiving various Asian broadcasts which locals sometimes prefer to the West Australian provided content. Additionally, ionospheric conditions usually bode well for many of the more terrestrial radio transmissions – [[High frequency|HF]] right up through [[Very high frequency|VHF]] and sometimes in to [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]]. The island plays home to a small array of radio equipment that, evidently, spans a good chunk of the usable spectrum. A variety of government owned and operated antenna systems are employed on the island to take advantage of this.

== Transport ==
===Container port===
A container port exists at Flying Fish Cove with an alternative container unloading point to the south of the island at Norris Point for use during the December to March 'swell season&quot; of seasonal rough seas.

===Railways===
An 18&amp;nbsp;km [[standard gauge]] railway from Flying Fish Cove to the phosphate mine was constructed in 1914. It was closed in December 1987, when the Australian Government closed the mine, but remains largely intact. Because of its very small population size, Christmas Island has the longest railway per capita in the world, more than 100 times of the average length.&lt;ref name=&quot;railway_per_capita&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/tra_rai_tot_percap-transportation-railways-total-per-capita|title=(Railways) Total (per capita) (most recent) by country|accessdate=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air travel===
There are three weekly flights into [[Christmas Island Airport]] from Perth, Western Australia (via [[RAAF Learmonth]]) and a weekly charter flight from [[Malaysia]] by [[Malaysia Airlines]].

===Road transport===
There is a new recreation centre at Phosphate Hill operated by the Shire of Christmas Island. There is also a taxi service. The road network covers most of the island and is generally good quality, although four wheel drive vehicles are needed to access some more distant parts of the rain forest or the more isolated beaches, which are only accessible by rough dirt roads.

==Education==
The island-operated [[Day care|crèche]] is located in the Recreation Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shire.gov.cx/Recreation_Centre/crechemain.html |title=Recreation Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christmas Island District High School]], catering for students in grades P-10 is run by the Australian Education Department. Students wishing to complete the last two years of high school or university education must do so on mainland Australia.

The island has one public library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shire.gov.cx/Community_Services/library.html |title=Public library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clipperton Island''' ({{lang-fr|Île de Clipperton'' or ''Île de la Passion}}, {{lang-es|Isla de la Pasión}}) is an uninhabited nine-square-kilometre (approx. 3.5-square-mile) coral [[atoll]] in the eastern Pacific Ocean, southwest of [[Mexico]] and west of [[Central America]], at {{Coord|10|18|N|109|13|W|name=Clipperton Island|type:isle_region:FR-CP|display=inline,title}}.  It is an overseas possession of [[France]] under direct authority of the [[Minister of Overseas France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=2E14855B772D504D6D56073B3A3BFDAD.tpdjo13v_1?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000879815&amp;categorieLien=cid&amp;dateTexte= Art. 9, Loi n° 55-1052 du 6 août 1955 modifiée portant statut des Terres australes et antarctiques françaises et de l'île de Clipperton].&lt;br /&gt; [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000018048991&amp;fastPos=1&amp;fastReqId=2007253908&amp;categorieLien=id&amp;oldAction=rechTexte Décret du 31 janvier 2008 relatif à l'administration de l'île de Clipperton].&lt;/ref&gt;

Clipperton Island is low-lying and largely barren, save for scattered grasses and a few clumps of [[coconut palm]]s.  A small volcanic outcrop rising to {{convert|29|m|ft}} on its southeast side is referred to as &quot;Clipperton Rock&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qsl.net/clipperton2000/history.html Clipperton Island History].&lt;/ref&gt; The atoll has been occupied at various times by guano miners, would-be settlers or military personnel, mostly from Mexico, which formerly claimed it until international arbitration awarded it to France in 1931.  However, Clipperton has had no permanent inhabitants since 1945. It is still visited on occasion by fishermen, [[French Navy]] patrols, scientific researchers, film crews, and shipwreck survivors.  It has also proven a popular site for transmissions by [[ham radio]] operators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qsl.net/clipperton2000/ Clipperton Island DXpedition], includes details on several previous ham radio expeditions to Clipperton, and photos of the island.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural conditions==
===Location, lagoon and climate===
[[File:Clippertonisland.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Coconut]] palms on Clipperton; the lagoon is visible past the trees]]
Clipperton Island lies about {{convert|945|km|mi nmi|abbr=on|lk=off}} southeast of [[Socorro Island]] in the [[Revillagigedo Islands|Revillagigedo Archipelago]], the nearest land. The ring-shaped atoll completely encloses a [[water stagnation|stagnant]] freshwater [[lagoon]], and is {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=mid|in circumference}}.  The island's rim averages {{convert|150|m|ft}} in width, though it reaches {{convert|400|m|ft}} in the west and narrows to {{convert|45|m|ft}} in the northeast, where sea waves occasionally spill over into the lagoon.  Land elevations average {{convert|2|m|ft}}, though Clipperton Rock, a barren {{convert|29|m|ft|adj=on}} [[volcano|volcanic]] outcrop located in the atoll's southeast, is considerably higher and forms the island's tallest point.  The reef surrounding Clipperton is exposed at low tide.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClippertonIsland&quot;&gt;[http://www.worldwildlife.org/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial/nt/nt0705_full.html Clipperton Island Shrubs and Grasslands]&lt;/ref&gt;

Clipperton's lagoon is devoid of fish, and contains some deep basins with depths of  {{convert|−43|and|−22|m|ft}}, including a spot known as ''Trou-Sans-Fond'', or &quot;the bottomless hole&quot;, with [[sulfuric acid|acidic water]] at its base.  The water is described as being almost [[Fresh water|fresh]] at the surface, and highly [[eutrophic]].  Seaweed beds cover approximately 45 percent of the lagoon's surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClippertonIsland&quot; /&gt;

While some sources have rated the lagoon water as [[potable|non-potable]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traveltips24.com/Clipperton_Island.htm Clipperton Island Travel Tips], [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/08/0828_030829_milbrandjournal1.html Lance Hildebrand's Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; testimony from the crew of the [[tuna]] clipper ''M/V Monarch,'' stranded on Clipperton for 23 days in 1962 after their boat sank, indicates otherwise.  Their report reveals that the lagoon water, while not tasting very good, was drinkable, though &quot;muddy and dirty&quot;.  Several of the castaways drank it, with no apparent ill effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/atollresearchbulletin/issues/00094.pdf Atoll Research Bulletin No. 94]. National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., December 15, 1962, pp.8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, however, survivors of the ill-fated Mexican military [[colony]] on Clipperton in 1917 (see below) indicated that they were dependent upon [[rain]] for their water supply, catching it in several old [[boat]]s they used for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/atollresearchbulletin/issues/00094.pdf Atoll Research Bulletin No. 94]. National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., December 15, 1962, pg.10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from the lagoon and water caught from rain, no other freshwater sources are known to exist on the island.

Clipperton Island has a tropical oceanic climate, with average temperatures of {{convert|20|–|32|C|F}}. The rainy season occurs from May to October, when it is subject to tropical storms and hurricanes. Surrounding ocean waters are warm, pushed by equatorial and counter-equatorial currents.  The island has no known natural resources, its [[guano]] having been depleted early in the 20th century.  Although 115 species of fish have been identified in the waters near Clipperton, the only economic activity in the area is [[tuna]] fishing.

===Flora and fauna===
When Snodgrass and Heller visited Clipperton in 1898, they reported that &quot;no land plant is native to the island&quot; (Snodgrass and Heller, 1902). Other historical accounts from 1711, 1825 and 1839, however, point out that the island had a low grassy or suffrutescent (partially woody) flora during those periods (Sachet, 1962).  [[Coconut palm]]s were introduced in the 1890s, and a few still survive.  Introduction of [[pig]]s by [[guano]] miners at the beginning of the 20th century reduced the crab population on the island, which in turn allowed [[grassland]] to gradually cover about 80 percent of the land surface (Sachet,  1962).  The elimination of these pigs in 1958 has caused most of this vegetation to disappear as millions of [[crab]]s (''Gecarcinus planatus'') have returned.  The result is that Clipperton is now virtually a sandy desert, with only 674 remaining palms counted by C. Jost during the &quot;Passion 2001&quot; French mission, and five islets in the lagoon with grass that these terrestrial crabs cannot reach.

[[File:CarteLocal.gif|thumb|right|230px|Location of Clipperton Island]]
During Sachet's visit in 1958, Clipperton's vegetation was found to consist of a sparse cover of spiny grass and low thickets, a creeping plant (''[[Ipomoea]]'' sp.), and stands of coconut palm. This low-lying herbaceous flora seems to be pioneer in nature, and most of it is believed to be composed of recently introduced [[species]]. Sachet suspected that ''[[Heliotropium curassavicum]]'' and possibly ''[[Portulaca oleracea]]'' were native, however (Sachet 1962). On the northwest side of the island, the most abundant species are ''[[Cenchrus echinatus]]'', ''[[Sida rhombifolia]]'', and ''Corchorus aestuans''. These plants compose a shrub cover up to 30&amp;nbsp;cm in height and are intermixed with ''[[Eclipta]]'', ''[[Phyllanthus]]'', and ''[[Solanum]]'', as well as a taller plant, ''[[Brassica juncea]]''. One interesting feature observed about Clipperton Island's flora is that the vegetation is arranged in parallel rows of species; dense rows of taller species alternate with lower, more open vegetation. This was assumed to be a result of the [[phosphate]] mining method of trench-digging.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClippertonIsland&quot; /&gt;

The only land animals known to exist on Clipperton Island are bright orange crabs (which are poisonous to consume),&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikitravel.org/en/Clipperton_Island Clipperton Island Travel Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; birds, lizards and rats, the last of which seem to have arrived from recently wrecked ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClippertonIsland_a&quot;&gt;[http://www.clipperton.fr/downloads/ArtPitman2006.pdf Clipperton Island: Pig Sty, Rat Hole, and Booby Prize]&lt;/ref&gt;  Bird species include [[White Tern]]s, [[Masked Booby|Masked Boobies]], [[Sooty Tern]]s, [[Brown Booby|Brown Boobies]], [[Brown Noddy|Brown Noddies]], [[Black Noddy|Black Noddies]], [[Greater Frigatebird|Greater Frigates]], [[Coot]]s, Martins, [[Cuckoo]]s and [[Yellow Warbler]]s.  [[Duck]]s have been reported in the lagoon.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClippertonIsland&quot; /&gt;  The lagoon equally harbors millions of [[isopod]]s, which swimmers claim can deliver a painful sting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qsl.net/clipperton2000/previous/n9ns-1992.html 1992 Clipperton Island Expedition]&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent report (2006) by the [[NOAA]]'s Southwest Fisheries Science Center in [[La Jolla, California]], indicates that the increased rat presence on Clipperton Island has led to a decline in both crab and bird populations, causing a corresponding increase in both vegetation and coconut palms on the island.  This report urgently recommended eradication of all the rats on the island, so that vegetation might be reduced and the island might return to its &quot;pre-human&quot; state.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClippertonIsland_a&quot; /&gt;

==History==
===Discovery and early claims===
Clipperton's name comes from [[John Clipperton]], an English [[pirate]] and [[privateer]] who fought the Spanish during the early 18th century, and who is said to have passed by the island. Some sources say he used it as a base for his raids on shipping, yet there is no documentary evidence for this assertion.&lt;ref&gt;Büch, Boudewijn. ''Eilanden'' ('Islands'). Holland, 1991, IScBN 9041330860&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Île de la Passion'' ({{lang-en|Passion Island}}) was officially given to Clipperton in 1711 by French discoverers Martin de Chassiron and Michel Du Bocage, commanding the French ships ''La Princesse'' and ''La Découverte''.  They drew up the first map of the island and annexed it to France. The first scientific expedition to Clipperton took place in 1725 under Frenchman M. Bocage, who lived on the island for several months. In 1858 France formally laid claim to Clipperton.

Other claimants included the United States, whose American Guano Mining Company claimed it under the [[Guano Islands Act]] of 1856; Mexico also claimed Clipperton due to activities undertaken there as early as 1848–1849.  On November 17, 1858, Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon&amp;nbsp;III]] annexed Clipperton as part of the French colony of [[Tahiti]].  However, this did not settle the question of Clipperton's ownership.  On November 24, 1897, French naval authorities found three Americans on Clipperton working for the American Guano Company, who had raised the American flag on the island.  However, U.S. authorities denounced their act, assuring the French that they did not intend to assert American sovereignty over Clipperton.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ilsa.org/jessup/jessup10/basicmats/clipperton.pdf Clipperton Islands Case (Mexico v. France)]'', Judicial Decisions Involving Questions of International Law (28 January 1931).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mexico]] reasserted its claim over Clipperton Island late in the 19th century, and on December 13, 1897, sent the gunboat ''La Democrata'' to occupy and annex it.  A colony was established, and a series of military governors were posted to Clipperton from that time, the last of whom would be [[Ramón Arnaud]] (1906–1916).  France insisted on ''its'' ownership of Clipperton, and a lengthy diplomatic correspondence between the two nations led to the conclusion of a treaty on March 2, 1909, to seek the arbitration of King [[Victor Emmanuel&amp;nbsp;III of Italy]], with each nation promising to abide by that monarch's final determination.&lt;ref&gt;Original treaty between Mexico and France, French Foreign Ministry Archives, PDF file: [https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/choiseul/ressource/pdf/D19090019.pdf Gouv-fr-PDF-19].&lt;/ref&gt;  His decision would not be rendered until 1931.

===Guano mining and the tragedy of 1917===
[[Image:SobrevivientesClipperton.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Survivors from Clipperton Island, 1917]]
The British Pacific Island Company acquired the rights to Clipperton's guano deposits in 1906, and built a mining settlement on the island in conjunction with the Mexican government. That same year, a lighthouse was erected under the orders of [[List of Presidents of Mexico|President]] [[Porfirio Díaz]]. By 1914, around 100 people&amp;mdash;men, women, and children&amp;mdash;were living on Clipperton Island, resupplied every two months by a ship from [[Acapulco]]. However, with the escalation of fighting in the [[Mexican Revolution]], the regular resupply visits ceased, and the island's inhabitants were left to their own devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historyof&quot;&gt;[http://www.clipperton2008.org/Clipperton%20Island%20History.htm History of Clipperton Island].&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Navy|US Navy]] warship ''Lexington'' visited the atoll in late 1915 and advised evacuation of all inhabitants, however the governor, [[Ramón_Arnaud|Captain Arnaud]], declared that evacuation was not necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historyof&quot; /&gt;

By 1917, all but one of the males on Clipperton had died.  Many had perished from [[scurvy]], while others (including Captain Arnaud) died during a failed attempt to sail after a passing ship to fetch help. Lighthouse keeper Victoriano Álvarez ultimately found himself the last man remaining on the island, together with 15 women and children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historyof&quot; /&gt;  Álvarez proclaimed himself &quot;king&quot; and began an orgy of rape and murder, before being killed by Captain Arnaud's widow, who had become the recipient of his unwanted attentions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historyof&quot; /&gt; Almost immediately after Álvarez's death, four women and seven children (the last survivors) were picked up by the US Navy gunship {{USS|Yorktown|PG-1|2}} on July 18, 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historyof&quot; /&gt;  Following this, no further attempts were made to permanently colonize Clipperton Island, though it would be briefly occupied during the 1930s and 40s.

The tragic tale of the Mexican colony on Clipperton Island has been the subject of several novels, including Ivo Mansmann's ''Clipperton, Schicksale auf einer vergessenen Insel'' (&quot;Clipperton, Destinies on a Forgotten Island&quot;); ISBN 3-354-00709-5 (in German, no English translation available).

===Final arbitration of ownership===
On January 28, 1931, King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emanuel]] finally declared Clipperton to be a French possession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsa.org/jessup/jessup10/basicmats/clipperton.pdf Clipperton Islands Case (''Mexico v. France'') Judicial Decisions Involving Questions of International Law (28 January 1931]; [http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/articles/APLPJ_01.2_heflin.pdf article by William Heflin that includes a discussion of the case]&lt;/ref&gt; The French rebuilt the island's [[lighthouse]] and settled a military outpost there, which remained for seven years before being abandoned.

===World War II===
[[Image:LST-563 broached.jpg|thumb|[[Tank landing ship]] [[USS LST-563|USS ''LST-563'']] beached on Clipperton in 1944]]
In the late 1930s, Clipperton Island was visited twice by U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who wanted it to become an American possession for use as an airbase for Pacific Ocean operations. In 1944, he ordered the US Navy to occupy the island (until 1945) in one of the most secret U.S. operations of [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. [[Richard E. Byrd|Rear Admiral Byrd]] undertook an expedition to the island to assess its potential as an airbase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blinkx.com/watch-video/birds-palm-trees-and-surf-at-clipperton-island-during-byrd-expedition/9qLiDAUIBq2Amg2SLWYR8A Admiral Byrd Expedition to Clipperton Island: Film].  Contains film from the expedition made by Admiral Byrd to Clipperton Island.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war===
Clipperton Island was abandoned at the end of World War&amp;nbsp;II. Since then it has only been visited by sport fishermen, regularly scheduled patrols of the French Navy, and by Mexican [[tuna]] and [[shark]] fishermen. There have been infrequent scientific and [[amateur radio]] expeditions, and in 1978 [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] visited with his team of divers, plus a survivor from the 1917 evacuation, to film a [[television]] special called ''Clipperton: The Island that Time Forgot.''&lt;ref&gt;Simon Rogerson, [http://www.divemagazine.co.uk/news/article.asp?UAN=2934&amp;v=5&amp;sp=332382698484330872538 &quot;Cousteau and the Pit&quot;], ''Dive magazine'', July 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Clipperton was visited by ornithologist Ken Stager of the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|Los Angeles County Museum]].  Appalled at the depredations visited by feral pigs upon the island's Brown Booby and Masked Booby colonies (reduced to 500 and 150 birds, respectively), Stager procured a [[shotgun]] and proceeded to hunt down and kill all of Clipperton Island's 58 pigs.  By 2003, the Booby colonies on Clipperton boasted 25,000 Brown Boobies and 112,000 Masked Boobies, making the atoll the world's second-largest Brown Booby colony, and its largest Masked Booby colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClippertonIsland_a&quot; /&gt;

In 1962, the independence of [[Algeria]] threatened further French nuclear testing sites within that nation. The French Ministry of Defence considered Clipperton as a possible replacement location; however, due to the island's hostile climate and remote location, this was eventually ruled out.  The French explored reopening the lagoon and developing a harbor for trade and tourism during the 1970s, but this idea, too, was ultimately abandoned. An automatic weather installation was completed on April 7, 1980, with data collected by this station being transmitted directly by satellite to [[Brittany]].

In 1981, the Academy of Sciences for Overseas Territories recommended that the island have its own economic infrastructure, with an airstrip and a fishing port in the [[lagoon]]. This would mean opening up the lagoon by creating a passage in the atoll rim. For this purpose, an agreement was signed with the French government, represented by the High Commissioner for French Polynesia, whereby Clipperton became French state property. On October 13, 1986, a meeting took place regarding the establishment of a permanent base for fishing at Clipperton, between the high commissioner of [[French Polynesia]], representing the state, and the survey firm for the development and exploitation of the island (SEDEIC). Taking into account the economic constraints, the distance from viable markets, and the small size of the atoll, nothing apart from preliminary studies was ever undertaken to carry out this project. Finally, all plans for development of Clipperton were abandoned.

===Castaways===
In early 1962 (as mentioned above), Clipperton provided a home to nine crewmen of the sunken tuna clipper ''M/V Monarch'', who were stranded on the island for 23 days from February 6 to March 1 of that year.  They reported that the lagoon water was drinkable, though they preferred to drink water from the coconuts they found.  Unable to use any of the dilapidated buildings remaining on the island from previous occupants, they constructed a crude shelter from cement bags and tin salvaged from [[Quonset hut]]s built by the American military twenty years earlier.  Wood from the huts was used for firewood, and fish caught off the fringing reef combined with some potatoes and onions they had saved from their sinking vessel to augment the island's meager (as it turned out) supply of coconuts.  The crewmen reported that they tried eating bird's eggs, but found them to be rancid, and they decided after trying to cook a &quot;little black bird&quot; that it did not have enough meat to make the effort worthwhile.  Pigs that had previously inhabited Clipperton had been eradicated prior to this time, though the crewmen reported seeing their [[skeleton]]s around the atoll.  Eventually, these crewmen were discovered by another fishing boat, and were rescued by the United States Naval Destroyer [[USS Robison (DDG-12)|USS ''Robison'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/atollresearchbulletin/issues/00094.pdf Atoll Research Bulletin No. 94]. National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., December 15, 1962, pp.8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, five Mexican fishermen became lost at sea after a storm that occurred during their trip along the coast of [[Costa Rica]]. They drifted within sight of Clipperton, but were unable to reach it.&lt;ref&gt;Arias, Ron. ''Five against the sea: A true story of courage and survival'', 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1998, Steven Longbaugh and [[David Heritage]], two American deckhands from a [[fishing boat]] based in [[California]], were stranded on the island for three weeks. They were rescued after rebuilding a survival radio and using distress flares to signal for help.&lt;ref&gt;LaJoie, John. ' 'American Maritime Accident Report' ', 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history===
[[File:Clipperton Island.png|thumb|left|180px|Satellite image of Clipperton Island]]
The Mexican and French oceanographic expedition SURPACLIP (UNAM Mexico and UNC Nouméa) made extensive studies in 1997 on and around the island. In 2001, French geographer Ch. Jost extended the 1997 studies through his French &quot;Passion 2001&quot; expedition, explaining the evolution of the ecosystem, and releasing several papers, a video film, and a website.&lt;ref&gt;http://clipperton.fr&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 [http://www.milbrandcinema.com/ Lance Milbrand] stayed on the island for 41 days on a [[National Geographic Society]] expedition, recording his adventure in video, photos, and a written diary (see links below).

In 2005, Clipperton's [[ecosystem]] was extensively studied for four months by a scientific mission organized by Jean-Louis Étienne, which made a complete inventory of mineral, plant, and animal species found on the atoll, studied algae as deep as 100&amp;nbsp;m (330&amp;nbsp;ft) below sea level, and examined the effects of pollution on the island.  A 2008 expedition from the [[University of Washington]]'s School of Oceanography collected sediment cores from the lagoon to study climate change over the last millennium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/jsachs/lab/www/Research/Clipperton_2008/Clipperton_2008.html Clipperton Atoll Expedition 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 2007, the administration of Clipperton was transferred from the [[High Commissioner]] of the Republic in [[French Polynesia]] to the Minister of Overseas France.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Fr_minor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A recreational scuba diving expedition by the luxury liveaboard safari boat  M/V ''Nautilus Explorer'' dove the reefs around Clipperton from April 15 to 20, 2007 to observe the marine life and compare these observations with those reported by the Connie Limbaugh (Scripps) expeditions in 1956 and 1958. Commencing in 2010, the ''Nautilus Explorer'' will be running diving expeditions from [[Cabo San Lucas]] to Clipperton Atoll via [[Socorro Island]] every spring.

During the night of February 10, 2010, the ''Sichem Osprey'', a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] [[chemical tanker]] ran aground on Clipperton Island on its way from the [[Panama Canal]] to [[South Korea]]. The 170 meter-long (over 550 feet) ship contained [[Xylene]], a clear, flammable liquid commonly used as a solvent in rubber, leather and the printing industries. All 19 crew members were reported safe, and the vessel reported no leaks of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;http://diver.net/bbs/posts002/81342.shtml ''Diver.Net'', Retrieved, November 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://reeftools.com/news/xylene-tanker-runs-aground-on-clipperton-island/ ReefTools, Retrieved November 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The vessel was eventually re-floated on March 6&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/search-results.htm;jsessionid=4ABF68DBDE9D889B43BBE23A30C751CD ''Lloyds of London;'' Retrieved, November 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and is back in service.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?MMSI=249534000 ''MarineTraffic.com'' Retrieved, November 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Territory of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands''', also called '''Cocos Islands''' and '''Keeling Islands''', is a [[States and territories of Australia|territory]] of [[Australia]], located in the [[Indian Ocean]], southwest of [[Christmas Island]] and approximately midway between Australia and [[Sri Lanka]]. 

The territory consists of two [[atoll]]s and 27 [[coral island]]s, of which two, [[West Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|West Island]] and [[Home Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Home Island]], are inhabited with a total population of approximately 600.

==Geography==
The Cocos (Keeling) Islands consist of two flat, low-lying coral atolls with an area of {{convert|14.2|km2|sqmi}}, {{convert|26|km|mi}} of coastline, a highest elevation of {{convert|5|m|ft}} and thickly covered with coconut palms and other vegetation. The climate is pleasant, moderated by the southeast [[trade winds]] for about nine months of the year and with moderate rainfall. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} [[Cyclone]]s may occur in the early months of the year.

'''[[North Keeling]] Island''' is an atoll consisting of just one C-shaped island, a nearly closed atoll ring with a small opening into the [[lagoon]], about {{convert|50|m|ft}} wide, on the east side. The island measures {{convert|1.1|km2|acre}} in land area and is uninhabited. The lagoon is about {{convert|0.5|km2|acre}}. North Keeling Island and the surrounding sea to {{convert|1.5|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} from shore form the [[Pulu Keeling National Park]], established on 12 December 1995. It is home to the only surviving population of the endemic, and endangered, [[Cocos Buff-banded Rail]].

'''South Keeling Islands''' is an atoll consisting of 24 individual islets forming an incomplete atoll ring, with a total land area of {{convert|13.1|km2|sqmi}}. Only [[Home Island]] and [[West Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|West Island]] are populated. The Cocos Malays maintain weekend shacks, referred to as pondoks, on most of the larger islands.

There are no rivers or lakes on either atoll. Fresh water resources are limited to water lenses on the larger islands, underground accumulations of rainwater lying above the seawater. These lenses are accessed through shallow bores or wells.

Cocos (Keeling) Island is located on almost exactly the opposite side of the globe from [[Cocos Island]], Costa Rica.

===Fauna===
{{Main|Fauna of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands}}

===Demographics===
In 2010, the population of the islands is estimated at just over 600.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ck.html CIA World Factbook]&lt;/ref&gt; The population on the two inhabited islands generally is split between the ethnic Europeans on West Island (estimated population 100) and the ethnic [[Cocos Malays|Malays]] on Home Island (estimated population 500). A [[Cocos Islands Malay|Cocos dialect]] of [[Malay language|Malay]] and English are the main languages spoken, and 80% of Cocos Islanders are [[Sunni Muslim]].

==History==
In 1609 Captain [[William Keeling]] was the first European to see the islands, but they remained uninhabited until the 19th century, when they became a possession of the Clunies-Ross Family. A Scottish merchant seaman named Captain John Clunies-Ross from the [[Shetland Islands]] explored the islands in 1825, aiming to settle on them with his family. 

Alexander Hare, who had taken part in [[Stamford Raffles]]' takeover of [[Java]] in 1811 {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} landed and settled with his [[slavery|slaves]] who originated from [[Indonesia]], the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and East Asia. Clunies-Ross returned and set up a compound on South Island consisting of his family and some other settlers. Hare's severely mistreated slaves soon escaped to work under better conditions for Clunies-Ross.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clunies-ross.com The Clunies-Ross Chronicle]&lt;/ref&gt; The workers were paid in a currency called the [[Cocos rupee]], a currency John Clunies-Ross minted himself that could only be redeemed at the company store.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6730047.stm End of a kingdom]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WW1 Landing at Direction Island.jpg|thumb|220px|right|A landing party from the German Navy cruiser [[Emden]] leaves Cocos (Keeling) Islands via this jetty on [[Direction Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Direction Island]].]]
On 1 April 1836, {{HMS|Beagle}} under Captain [[Robert FitzRoy]] arrived to take soundings establishing the profile of the atoll as part of the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|survey expedition of the ''Beagle'']]. To the young naturalist [[Charles Darwin]], who was on the ship, the results supported a theory he had developed of how atolls formed, which he later published as ''[[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs]]''. He studied the natural history of the islands and collected specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Captain Ross, the governor, is now absent at the Cape.&quot;

===Annexed to the British Empire===
The islands were annexed by the British Empire in 1857. This annexation was carried out by [[Thomas Fremantle (Royal Navy officer)#Sons of Thomas Fremantle|Captain Stephen Grenville Fremantle]] in command of [[HMS Juno (1844)|HMS Juno]]. Fremantle claimed the islands for the British Empire and appointed [[King of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Ross II]] as Superintendent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Cocos Islands|journal=The Chambers's Journal|year=1899|volume= 76|pages=187–190|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ddUXAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA187}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, their administration was placed under the [[Straits Settlements]], which included [[Penang]], [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]]. [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] granted the islands in perpetuity to the [[King of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Clunies-Ross family]] in 1886. The Cocos Islands under the Clunies-Ross family have been cited as an example of a 19th-century [[micronation]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===World War I===
On 9 November 1914, the islands became the site of the [[Battle of Cocos]], one of the first naval battles of World War I. The wireless [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] station on [[Direction Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Direction Island]], a vital link between the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, was destroyed by sailors from the [[Imperial Germany|German]] [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Emden|1906|6}}, which was in turn surprised and destroyed by the Australian cruiser, {{HMAS|Sydney|1912|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/index.php/HMAS_Sydney_%28I%29 |title=HMAS Sydney (I) |accessdate=23 August 2008 |publisher=Royal Australian Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
During World War II, the cable station was once again a vital link. Allied planners noted that the islands might be seized as a base for [[Nazi Germany|German]] raider cruisers operating in the Indian Ocean. Following [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s entry into the war, Japanese forces did occupy neighbouring islands. To avoid drawing their attention to the Cocos cable station and its islands' garrison, the [[seaplane]] anchorage between Direction and [[Horsburgh Island|Horsburgh]] islands was not used. Radio transmitters were also kept silent, except in emergencies. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

After the [[Fall of Singapore]] in 1942, the islands were administered from [[Ceylon]] ([[Sri Lanka]]), and West and Direction Islands were placed under [[Allied]] military administration. The islands' garrison initially consisted of a platoon from the British Army's [[King's African Rifles]], located on Horsburgh Island, with two {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=4|abbr=off|lk=off}} guns to cover the anchorage. The local inhabitants all lived on Home Island. Despite the importance of the islands as a communication centre, the Japanese made no attempt either to raid or to occupy them and contented themselves with sending over a reconnaissance aircraft about once a month. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

On the night of 8–9 May 1942, 15 members of the garrison, from the [[Ceylon Defence Force]], [[Mutiny|mutinied]], under the leadership of [[Gratien Fernando]]. The mutineers were said to have been provoked by the attitude of their British officers, and were also supposedly inspired by [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] beliefs. They attempted to take control of the [[Artillery|gun battery]] on the islands. The [[Cocos Islands Mutiny]] was crushed, although the mutineers killed one non-mutinous soldier and wounded one officer. Seven of the mutineers were sentenced to death at a trial which was later alleged to have been improperly conducted. Four of the sentences were commuted, but three men were executed, including Fernando. These were to be the only [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] soldiers executed for mutiny during the Second World War.&lt;ref name=CIM&gt;{{Cite book

On 25 December 1942, the Japanese submarine [[Japanese submarine I-166|''I-166'']] bombarded the islands but caused no damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.combinedfleet.com/I-166.htm Combinedfleet.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the war, two airstrips were built, and three bomber squadrons were moved to the islands to conduct raids against Japanese targets in South East Asia and to provide support during the [[Operation Tiderace|planned]] reinvasion of [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and reconquest of [[Singapore]]. The first aircraft to arrive were [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mk VIIIs of [[No. 136 Squadron RAF]]. They included some [[B-24|Liberator]] bombers from [[No. 321 Squadron RAF|No. 321 (Netherlands) Squadron RAF]] (members of exiled Dutch forces serving with the [[Royal Air Force]]), which were also stationed on the islands. When in July 1945 [[No. 99 Squadron RAF|No. 99]] and [[No. 356 Squadron RAF|No. 356]] RAF squadrons arrived on West Island, they brought with them a daily newspaper called Atoll which contained news of what was happening in the outside world. Run by airmen in their off-duty hours, it achieved fame when dropped by Liberator bombers on POW camps over the heads of the Japanese guards. In 1946 the administration of the islands reverted to Singapore.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Transfer to Australia===
On 23 November 1955, the islands were transferred to Australian control under the ''Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955'' (an Australian Act) pursuant to the ''Cocos Islands Act, 1955'' (a UK Act).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1977/jun/28/cocos-keeling-islands#S5CV0934P0-05978 | house=House of Commons | date=28 June 1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr H J Hull was appointed the first Official Representative (now Administrator) of the new Territory. He had been a Lieutenant- Commander in the Royal Australian Navy and was released for the purpose. Under Commonwealth Cabinet Decision 1573 of 9 September 1958, Mr Hull's appointment was terminated and [[John William Stokes]] was appointed on secondment from the Northern Territory Police. A media release at the end of October 1958 by the Minister for Territories, Mr Hasluck, commended Mr Hull's three years of service on Cocos. Mr Stokes served in the position from 31 October 1958 to 30 September 1960. Mr C.I. Buffett [[MBE]] from [[Norfolk Island]] succeeded him and served from 28 July 1960 to 30 June 1966, and later acted as Administrator back on Cocos and on [[Norfolk Island|Norfolk Island.]] In 1974, Ken Mullen wrote a small book&lt;ref&gt;Cocos Keeling, the islands time forgot (1974). Ken Mullen. published by Angus &amp; Robertson, Sydney. 122 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; about his time with wife and son from 1964 to 1966 working at the Cable Station on Direction Island.

In the 1970s, the Australian government's dissatisfaction with the Clunies-Ross feudal style of rule of the island increased. In 1978, Australia forced the family to sell the islands for the sum of A$6,250,000, using the threat of compulsory acquisition. By agreement, the family retained ownership of Oceania House, their home on the island. However, in 1983 the Australian government reneged this agreement, and told [[John Clunies-Ross]] that he should leave the Cocos. The following year the [[High Court of Australia]] ruled that resumption of Oceania House was unlawful, but the Australian government ordered that no government business was to be granted to his shipping company, an action that contributed to his bankruptcy. John Clunies-Ross now lives in Perth, Western Australia. However, some members of the Clunies-Ross family still live on the Cocos.

The 2004 earthquake and tsunami centered off the western shore of Sumatra, Indonesia, prompted early worries about the Cocos, but no casualties were reported.&lt;ref&gt;Main article: [[Countries affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Administrator is [[Brian Lacy]], who was appointed on 18 September 2009 and is also the Administrator of [[Christmas Island]]. These two Territories comprise Australia's Indian Ocean Territories. There also exists a unicameral [[Shire of Cocos|Cocos (Keeling) Islands Shire Council]] with seven seats. A full term lasts four years, though elections are held every two years; approximately half the members retire each two years. Federally, Cocos (Keeling) Islanders form the electorate of [[Division of Lingiari|Lingiari]] with Christmas Island and outback Northern Territory.

The islands have a five-person police force but their defence remains the responsibility of Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
There is a small and growing tourist industry focused on water-based or nature activities.

Small local gardens and fishing contribute to the food supply, but most food and most other necessities must be imported from Australia or elsewhere.

The Cocos Islands Cooperative Society Ltd. employs construction workers, [[stevedore]]s, and lighterage worker operations. Tourism employs others. The unemployment rate was 11.3% in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;abs&quot;&gt;[http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/LocationSearch?locationLastSearchTerm=cocos&amp;locationSearchTerm=cocos&amp;newarea=910053009&amp;submitbutton=View+QuickStats+%3E&amp;mapdisplay=on&amp;collection=Census&amp;period=2006&amp;areacode=910053009&amp;geography=&amp;method=Place+of+Usual+Residence&amp;productlabel=&amp;producttype=QuickStats&amp;topic=&amp;navmapdisplayed=true&amp;javascript=true&amp;breadcrumb=PL&amp;topholder=0&amp;leftholder=0&amp;currentaction=104&amp;action=401&amp;textversion=false&amp;subaction=1 2006 Census, Australian Bureau of Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communications and transport==
The islands are connected within Australia's telecommunication system (with number range +61 8 9162 xxxx) and postal system ([[Postal code|post code]]: 6799). Public phones are located on both West Island and Home Island. A GSM mobile phone network operates on Cocos (Keeling) Islands which is &quot;on its last legs&quot; according to the Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/ncet/EconomicEnvironment/subs/Sub08.pdf APH.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt; Phones must be registered through the Telecentre to access this service. There is one paved airport on the West Island, [[Cocos (Keeling) Island International Airport]], to which [[Virgin Australia]] operates scheduled jet services from Perth, Western Australia. There is also a lagoon anchorage.

==Media==
Cocos (Keeling) Islands has access to a range of modern communication services. Four television stations broadcast from Western Australia via satellite. These are ABC, SBS, WIN and GWN.  A local radio station, 6CKI – Voice of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, is staffed by community volunteers and provides some local content.As television and radio stations broadcast through a satellite service, rainfall may cause interference.

===Television===
Cocos Island received four channels from Western Australia via Satellite:
*ABC1
*SBS One
*WIN Television (Affiliated of Nine Network Perth)
*GWN (Affiliated of Seven Network Perth)

Cocos Island only receives four channels because Freeview is not available yet.

==Education==
There are two schools in the archipelago, located on the two inhabited islands. One is on West Island, and the other on Home Island.

School instruction is in English, and efforts are made to discourage students from speaking the local language ([[Cocos Islands Malay]], a [[Malay language|Malay]] dialect) on school premises.&lt;ref&gt;Paige Taylor, [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25939105-2702,00.html Crime in paradise lost in translation] &quot;The Australian&quot;, 17 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

{{globalize/USA|date=April 2011}}

'''&quot;Conspiracy theory&quot;''' was originally a neutral descriptor for any claim of [[conspiracy (civil)|civil]], [[conspiracy (crime)|criminal]], or [[list of conspiracies (political)|political conspiracy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Barkun, Michael | title = [[A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America]] | publisher = [[University of California Press]]; 1 edition | year = 2003 | isbn = 0520238052}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has become largely [[pejorative]] and used almost exclusively to refer to any [[fringe theory]] which explains a historical or current event as the result of a secret plot by conspirators of almost superhuman [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[machiavellianism|cunning]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;

Conspiracy theories are viewed with [[scientific skepticism|skepticism]] by many because they are rarely supported by any conclusive evidence and contrast with [[institutional analysis]]. The former speculates on the motives and actions of [[secret society|secretive coalitions of individuals]] while the latter studies people's collective behavior in publicly known institutions, as recorded in scholarly material and [[mainstream media]] reports, to explain historical or current events.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt; Scholars argue that conspiracy theory goes beyond the boundaries of [[critical thinking|rational criticism]] when it becomes [[falsifiability|nonfalsifiable]]. Such a theory is a closed system of ideas which explains away contradictory evidence by claiming that the conspirators themselves planted it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt; The term “conspiracy theory” is therefore often used dismissively in an attempt to characterize a belief as outlandishly false and held by a person judged to be a [[crank (person)|crank]] or a group confined to the [[lunatic fringe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenster 1999&quot;&gt;Fenster, M. 1999. Conspiracy theories: Secrecy and power in American culture. Minneapolis: [[University of Minnesota Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Such characterization is often the subject of dispute due to its possible unfairness and inaccuracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenster 1999&quot;/&gt; 

According to political scientist [[Michael Barkun]], conspiracy theories once limited to fringe audiences have become commonplace in [[mass media]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt; He argues that this has contributed to [[conspiracism]] emerging as a [[cultural phenomenon]] in the United States of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and the possible replacement of democracy by conspiracy as the dominant paradigm of [[politics|political action]] in the public mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt; According to anthropologists Todd Sanders and Harry G. West, &quot;evidence suggests that a broad cross section of Americans today…gives credence to at least some conspiracy theories.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harry G. West, Todd Sanders. (2003) [http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=HeMdeV_LvAMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=%22Transparency+and+conspiracy%22&amp;ots=XMzTBwz22s&amp;sig=qhknNptShaLbORX12dfheFpP6f8#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Transparency and conspiracy: ethnographies of suspicion in the new world order.''] Duke University Press. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in conspiracy theories has therefore become a topic of interest for sociologists, psychologists and experts in [[folklore]].

==Terminology==
The term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; may be a neutral descriptor for any legitimate or illegitimate claim of [[conspiracy (civil)|civil]], [[conspiracy (crime)|criminal]] or [[list of conspiracies (political)|political conspiracy]]. To ''conspire'' means &quot;to join in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or to use such means to accomplish a lawful end.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, p. 243 (8th ed. 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; However, conspiracy ''theory'' is also used to indicate a [[narrative]] [[genre]] that includes a broad selection of (not necessarily related) arguments for the existence of grand conspiracies.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, Robin (2006). ''Conspiracy Theories'', Pocket Essentials. ISBN 1-904048-65-X.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word &quot;[[theory]]&quot; is, in this usage, sometimes considered to be more informal as in &quot;[[speculation]]&quot; or &quot;[[hypothesis]]&quot; rather than mainstream [[scientific theory]]. Also, the term ''conspiracy'' is typically used to indicate powerful figures, often of [[the Establishment]], who are believed to be deceiving the [[population]] at large, as in [[political corruption]]. Although some conspiracies are not actually theories, they are often labeled as such by the general populace.

The first recorded use of the phrase &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; dates from 1909. Originally it was a neutral term but during the political upheaval of the 1960s it acquired its current derogatory sense.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;20th Century Words&quot; (1999) John Ayto, [[Oxford University Press]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; It entered the supplement to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as late as 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/6213226.stm Plots, paranoia and blame] by Peter Knight, BBC News 7 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is frequently used by scholars and in [[popular culture]] to identify secret military, banking, or political actions aimed at &quot;stealing&quot; [[Political power|power]], [[money]], or [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], from &quot;the people&quot;. Less illustrious uses refer to [[folklore]] and [[urban legend]] and a variety of explanatory narratives which are constructed with [[methodological]] flaws.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used in a [[pejorative]] sense to automatically dismiss claims that are deemed ridiculous, misconceived, paranoid, unfounded, outlandish or irrational. For example, the term &quot;[[Watergate]] conspiracy theory&quot; does not refer to the generally accepted version in which several participants actually were convicted of conspiracy, and others pardoned before any charges were filed, but to alternative and additional theories such as claims that the source(s) of information called &quot;[[Deep Throat]]&quot; was a fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2119989/ Slate Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Pipes]], in an early essay &quot;adapted from a study prepared for the CIA&quot;, attempted to define which beliefs distinguish 'the conspiracy mentality' from 'more conventional patterns of thought'. He defined them as: ''appearances deceive; conspiracies drive history; nothing is haphazard; the enemy always gains power, fame, money, and sex''.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Pipes, in ''Orbis'', Winter 1992: &quot;Dealing with Middle Eastern Conspiracy Theories&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to West and Sanders, when talking about conspiracies in the Vietnam era, Pipes includes within the fringe element anyone who entertains the thought that conspiracies played a role in the major political scandals and assassinations that rocked American politics in the Vietnam era. &quot;He sees the paranoid style in almost any critical historical or social-scientific analysis of oppression.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Transparency and conspiracy: ethnographies of suspicion in the new world order. Harry G. West, Todd Sanders. pp 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Political scientist [[Michael Barkun]] has categorized, in ascending order of breadth, the types of conspiracy theories as follows:
* ''Event conspiracy theories''. The conspiracy is held to be responsible for a limited, discrete event or set of events. The conspiratorial forces are alleged to have focused their energies on a limited, well-defined objective. The best-known example in the recent past is the [[Kennedy assassination conspiracies|Kennedy assassination conspiracy]] literature, though similar material exists concerning the [[TWA Flight 800 alternative theories|crash of TWA Flight 800]], and the [[AIDS origins conspiracy theories|spread of AIDS in the black community]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;
* ''Systemic conspiracy theories''. The conspiracy is believed to have broad goals, usually conceived as securing control of a country, a region, or even the entire world. While the goals are sweeping, the conspiratorial machinery is generally simple: a single, evil organization implements a plan to infiltrate and subvert existing institutions. This is a common scenario in conspiracy theories that focus on the alleged machinations of [[Jews]], [[Freemasonry|Masons]], and the [[Catholic Church]], as well as theories centered on [[Red Scare|communism]] or [[transnational capitalist class|international capitalists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;
* ''Superconspiracy theories''. Conspiratorial constructs in which multiple conspiracies are believed to be linked together hierarchically. Event and systemic are joined in complex ways, so that conspiracies come to be nested together. At the summit of the conspiratorial hierarchy is a distant but all-powerful evil force manipulating lesser conspiratorial actors. Superconspiracy theories have enjoyed particular growth since the 1980s, in the work of authors such as [[David Icke]], and [[Milton William Cooper]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;


==Conspiracism==
A world view that centrally places conspiracy theories in the unfolding of history is sometimes termed &quot;conspiracism&quot;. The historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] addressed the role of [[paranoia]] and conspiracism throughout [[American history]] in his essay ''[[The Paranoid Style in American Politics]]'', published in 1964. [[Bernard Bailyn|Bernard Bailyn's]] classic ''[[The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution]]'' (1967) notes that a similar phenomenon could be found in America during the time preceding the [[American Revolution]]. Conspiracism then labels people's attitudes as well as the type of conspiracy theories that are more global and historical in proportion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bailyn | first = Bernard | title = ''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution: | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | location = Cambridge | id = ASIN: B000NUF6FQ | isbn = 978-0-674-44302-0 | year = 1992 | origyear = 1967= | unused_data = origyear 1967=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''conspiracism'' was popularized by academic Frank P. Mintz in the 1980s. Academic work in conspiracy theories and conspiracism presents a range of hypotheses as a basis of studying the genre. Among the leading scholars of conspiracism are: Hofstadter, [[Karl Popper]], [[Michael Barkun]], Robert Alan Goldberg, [[Daniel Pipes]], Mark Fenster, Mintz, [[Carl Sagan]], [[George Johnson (writer)|George Johnson]], and [[Gerald Posner]].

According to Mintz, conspiracism denotes: &quot;belief in the primacy of conspiracies in the unfolding of history&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mintz | first = Frank P. | title = The Liberty Lobby and the American Right: Race, Conspiracy, and Culture | publisher = Greenwood | location = Westport, CT | isbn = 0-313-24393-X | page = 4 | year = 1985 | origyear = 1985 = | unused_data = origyear 1985 =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Conspiracism serves the needs of diverse political and social groups in America and elsewhere. It identifies elites, blames them for economic and social catastrophes, and assumes that things will be better once popular action can remove them from positions of power. As such, conspiracy theories do not typify a particular epoch or ideology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mintz | first = Frank P. | title = The Liberty Lobby and the American Right: Race, Conspiracy, and Culture | publisher = Greenwood | location = Westport, CT | isbn = 0-313-24393-X | page = 199 | year = 1985|origyear = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Throughout human history, political and economic leaders genuinely ''have'' been the cause of enormous amounts of death and misery, and they sometimes have engaged in conspiracies while at the same time promoting conspiracy theories about their targets. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] would be merely the most prominent examples; there have been numerous others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Arendt | first = Hannah | authorlink = Hannah Arendt | title = The Origins of Totalitarianism | origyear = 1953 | year = 1973 | publisher = Harcourt Brace Jovanovich | location = New York | isbn = 0156078104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases there have been claims dismissed as conspiracy theories that later proved to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fenster | first = Mark | title = Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 1999 | isbn = 081663243X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Dean | first = Jodi | title = Aliens in America: Conspiracy Cultures from Outerspace to Cyberspace | publisher = [[Cornell University Press]] | location = Ithaca, NY | year = 1998
 | isbn = 0801484685
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that history itself is controlled by large long-standing conspiracies is rejected by historian Bruce Cumings:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;But if conspiracies exist, they rarely move history; they make a difference at the margins from time to time, but with the unforeseen consequences of a logic outside the control of their authors: and this is what is wrong with 'conspiracy theory.' History is moved by the broad forces and large structures of human collectivities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cumings
 | first = Bruce | title = The Origins of the Korean War, Vol. II, The Roaring of the Cataract, 1947–1950 | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]] | location = Princeton, NJ | year = 1999
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term ''conspiracism'' is used in the work of [[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]], [[Chip Berlet]], and Matthew N. Lyons.

According to Berlet and Lyons, &quot;Conspiracism is a particular narrative form of scapegoating that frames demonized enemies as part of a vast insidious plot against the common good, while it valorizes the scapegoater as a hero for sounding the alarm&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berlet | first = Chip | authorlink = Chip Berlet | coauthors = Lyons, Matthew N. | title = Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 1572305622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Conspiracy theories are the subject of broad critique by [[academics]], [[politicians]], and the [[mass media|media]].

Perhaps the most contentious aspect of a conspiracy theory is the problem of settling a particular theory's truth to the satisfaction of both its proponents and its opponents. Particular accusations of conspiracy vary widely in their plausibility, but some common standards for assessing their likely [[truth value]] may be applied in each case:
* [[Occam's razor]] – does the alternative story explain more of the evidence than the mainstream story, or is it just a more complicated and therefore less useful explanation of the same evidence?
* [[Logic]] – do the proofs offered follow the rules of [[logic]], or do they employ [[Logical fallacy|fallacies of logic]]?
* [[Methodology]] – are the proofs offered for the argument well constructed, i.e., using sound methodology? Is there any clear standard to determine what evidence would prove or disprove the theory?
* [[Whistleblower]]s – how many people – and what kind – have to be loyal conspirators? The more wide-ranging and pervasive the conspiracy is alleged to be, the greater the number of people would have to be involved in perpetrating it – is it credible that nobody involved has brought the affair to light?
* [[Falsifiability]] – would it be possible to determine whether specific claims of the theory are false, or are they &quot;unfalsifiable&quot;?

[[Noam Chomsky]], an academic critical of the United States [[The Establishment|establishment]], contrasts conspiracy theory as more or less the opposite of [[institutional analysis]], which focuses mostly on the public, long-term behaviour of publicly known institutions, as recorded in, for example, scholarly documents or [[mainstream media]] reports, rather than secretive coalitions of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://zena.secureforum.com/znet/ZMag/articles/oldalbert19.htm | title = Conspiracy Theory | author = Michael Albert, quoting from Zmagazine | accessdate = 2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Aside from [[controversies]] over the merits of particular conspiratorial claims, the general discussion of conspiracy theory is ''itself'' a matter of some public contention.

The term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is considered by different observers to be a neutral description for a conspiracy claim, a pejorative term used to dismiss such a claim without examination, and a term that can be positively embraced by proponents of such a claim. The term may be used by some for arguments they might not wholly believe but consider radical and exciting. The most widely accepted sense of the term is that which popular culture and academic usage share, certainly having negative implications for a narrative's probable truth value.

Conspiracy theorists on the internet are often dismissed as a &quot;fringe&quot; group, but evidence suggests that a broad cross section of Americans today—traversing ethnic, gender, education, occupation, and other divides—gives credence to at least some conspiracy theories.&lt;ref&gt;Transparency and conspiracy: ethnographies of suspicion in the new world order. Harry G. West, Todd Sanders. pp 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given this popular understanding of the term, it can also be used illegitimately and inappropriately, as a means to dismiss what are in fact substantial and well-evidenced accusations. The legitimacy of each such usage will therefore be a matter of some controversy. [[Michael Parenti]], in his 1996 essay which examines the role of progressive media in the use of the term, &quot;The JFK Assassination II: Conspiracy Phobia On The Left&quot;, states,

:&quot;It is an either-or world for those on the Left who harbor an aversion for any kind of conspiracy investigation: either you are a structuralist in your approach to politics or a 'conspiracist' who reduces historical developments to the machinations of secret cabals, thereby causing us to lose sight of the larger systemic forces.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;On The Left&quot;&gt;[http://www.questionsquestions.net/documents2/conspiracyphobia.html questionsquestions.net], &quot;The JFK Assassination II: conspiracy phobia on the left&quot;, Michael Parenti, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Structuralist or institutional analysis shows that the term is misused when it is applied to institutions acting in pursuit of their acknowledged goals, for example, when a group of corporations engage in price-fixing to increase profits.

Complications occurs for terms such as ''[[UFO]]'', which literally means &quot;unidentified flying object&quot; but connotes [[alien spacecraft]], a concept also associated with some conspiracy theories, and thus possessing a certain [[social stigma]]. Michael Parenti gives an example of the use of the term which underscores the conflict in its use. He states,

:&quot;In most of its operations, the CIA is by definition a conspiracy, using covert actions and secret plans, many of which are of the most unsavory kind. What are covert operations if not conspiracies? At the same time, the CIA is an institution, a structural part of the national security state. In sum, the agency is an institutionalized conspiracy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;On The Left&quot;/&gt;

The term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is itself the object of a type of conspiracy theory, which argues that those using the term are manipulating their audience to disregard the topic under discussion, either in a deliberate attempt to conceal the truth, or as dupes of more deliberate conspirators.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

When conspiracy theories are offered as official claims (for example, originating from a governmental authority, such as an intelligence agency) they are not usually considered as conspiracy theories. For example, certain activities of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] may be considered to have been an official attempt to promote a conspiracy theory, yet its claims are seldom referred to as such. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Further difficulties arise from ambiguity regarding the term [[theory]]. In popular usage, this term is often used to refer to unfounded or weakly based speculation, leading to the idea that &quot;It's not a conspiracy theory if it's actually true&quot;.

==Study of conspiracism==
In 1936 American commentator [[H. L. Mencken]] wrote:

::''The central belief of every moron is that he is the victim of a mysterious conspiracy against his common rights and true deserts. He ascribes all his failure to get on in the world, all of his congenital incapacity and damfoolishness, to the machinations of werewolves assembled in Wall Street, or some other such den of infamy.''&lt;ref&gt;H. L. Mencken, ''Baltimore Evening Sun'', June 15, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

Belief in conspiracy theories has become a topic of interest for sociologists, psychologists and experts in folklore since at least the 1960s, when the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]] of US President [[John F. Kennedy]] eventually provoked an unprecedented public response directed against the official version of the case as expounded in the Report of the [[Warren Commission]].

===Psychological origins===
According to some [[psychologist]]s, a person who believes in one conspiracy theory tends to believe in others; a person who does not believe in one conspiracy theory tends not to believe another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goertzel | year = 1994 | month = | title = ''Belief in Conspiracy Theories'' | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 733–744 | doi = 10.2307/3791630| id = | url = http://www.crab.rutgers.edu/~goertzel/conspire.doc | accessdate = 2006-08-07 | jstor = 3791630 | publisher = Political Psychology, Vol. 15, No. 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists believe that the [[meaning of life|search for meaning]] is common in conspiracism and the development of conspiracy theories, and may be powerful enough alone to lead to the first formulating of the idea. Once cognized, [[confirmation bias]] and avoidance of [[cognitive dissonance]] may reinforce the belief. In a context where a conspiracy theory has become popular within a social group, [[communal reinforcement]] may equally play a part. Some research carried out at the [[University of Kent]], UK suggests people may be influenced by conspiracy theories without being aware that their attitudes have changed. After reading popular conspiracy theories about the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]], participants in this study correctly estimated how much their peers' attitudes had changed, but significantly underestimated how much their own attitudes had changed to become more in favor of the conspiracy theories. The authors conclude that conspiracy theories may therefore have a 'hidden power' to influence people's beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karen Douglas and Robbie Sutton |year=in press |month= |title=The hidden impact of conspiracy theories: Perceived and actual influence of theories surrounding the death of Princess Diana |journal=Journal of Social Psychology |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |id= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Humanistic psychology|Humanistic psychologists]] argue that even if the [[cabal]] behind the conspiracy is almost always perceived as hostile there is, often, still an element of reassurance in it, for conspiracy theorists, in part because it is more consoling to think that complications and upheavals in human affairs, at least, are created by human beings rather than factors beyond human control. Belief in such a cabal is a device for reassuring oneself that certain occurrences are not random, but ordered by a human intelligence. This renders such occurrences comprehensible and potentially controllable. If a cabal can be implicated in a sequence of events, there is always the hope, however tenuous, of being able to break the cabal's power – or joining it and exercising some of that power oneself. Finally, belief in the power of such a cabal is an implicit assertion of [[human dignity]] – an often unconscious but necessary affirmation that man is not totally helpless, but is responsible, at least in some measure, for his own destiny.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1987&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Baigent, Michael; Leigh, Richard; Lincoln, Henry | title = The Messianic Legacy | publisher = Henry Holt &amp; Co | year = 1987 | isbn = 0805005684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Projection====
Some historians have argued that there is an element of [[psychological projection]] in conspiracism. This projection, according to the argument, is manifested in the form of attribution of undesirable characteristics of the self to the conspirators. [[Richard Hofstadter]], in his essay ''[[The Paranoid Style in American Politics]]'', stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...it is hard to resist the conclusion that this enemy is on many counts the projection of the self; both the ideal and the unacceptable aspects of the self are attributed to him. The enemy may be the cosmopolitan intellectual, but the paranoid will outdo him in the apparatus of scholarship... the Ku Klux Klan imitated Catholicism to the point of donning priestly vestments, developing an elaborate ritual and an equally elaborate hierarchy. The John Birch Society emulates Communist cells and quasi-secret operation through &quot;front&quot; groups, and preaches a ruthless prosecution of the ideological war along lines very similar to those it finds in the Communist enemy. Spokesmen of the various fundamentalist anti-Communist &quot;crusades&quot; openly express their admiration for the dedication and discipline the Communist cause calls forth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hofstadter also noted that &quot;sexual freedom&quot; is a vice frequently attributed to the conspiracist's target group, noting that &quot;very often the fantasies of true believers reveal strong sadomasochistic outlets, vividly expressed, for example, in the delight of anti-Masons with the cruelty of Masonic punishments.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, Richard. The Paranoid Style in American Politics. Harper's Magazine, November 1964, pp. 77–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epistemic bias====
{{rquote|right|Conspiracy theories are popular because no matter what they posit, they are all actually comforting, because they all are models of radical simplicity.|Novelist [[William Gibson]], October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetyee.ca/Books/2007/10/18/WillGibson/ |work=[[The Tyee]] |date=October 18, 2007 |accessdate=January 2, 2010 |last=Beers |first=David |title=William Gibson Hates Futurists}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
It is possible that certain basic human [[Epistemology|epistemic]] biases are projected onto the material under scrutiny. According to one study humans apply a 'rule of thumb' by which we expect a significant event to have a significant cause.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.bps.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/releases$/annual-conferences-1999-2004/who-shot-the-president$.cfm Who shot the president?],&quot; The British Psychological Society, March 18, 2003 (accessed June 7, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The study offered subjects four versions of events, in which a foreign president was (a) successfully assassinated, (b) wounded but survived, (c) survived with wounds but died of a heart attack at a later date, and (d) was unharmed. Subjects were significantly more likely to suspect conspiracy in the case of the 'major events'—in which the president died—than in the other cases, despite all other evidence available to them being equal. Connected with [[pareidolia]], the genetic tendency of human beings to find patterns in coincidence, this allows the &quot;discovery&quot; of conspiracy in any significant event.

Another epistemic 'rule of thumb' that can be misapplied to a mystery involving other humans is [[cui bono]]? (who stands to gain?). This sensitivity to the hidden motives of other people may be an evolved and universal feature of human consciousness.

====Clinical psychology====
For some individuals, an obsessive compulsion to believe, prove, or re-tell a conspiracy theory may indicate one or a combination of well-understood psychological conditions, and other hypothetical ones: [[paranoia]], [[denial]], [[schizophrenia]], [[mean world syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20050426081645/http://www.columbia.edu/~kw96/TopFive.html#Anchor-Media-54000 Top 5 New Diseases: Media Induced Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (MIPTSD)],&quot; ''The New Disease: A Journal of Narrative Pathology'' 2 (2004), (accessed June 7, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socio-political origins===
[[Christopher Hitchens]] represents conspiracy theories as the 'exhaust fumes of democracy',{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} the unavoidable result of a large amount of information circulating among a large number of people. Other{{Who|date=February 2010}} social commentators and sociologists argue that conspiracy theories are produced according to variables that may change within a democratic (or other type of) society.

Conspiratorial accounts can be emotionally satisfying when they place events in a readily understandable, moral context. The subscriber to the theory is able to assign moral responsibility for an emotionally troubling event or situation to a clearly conceived group of individuals. Crucially, that group ''does not include'' the believer. The believer may then feel excused of any moral or political responsibility for remedying whatever institutional or societal flaw might be the actual source of the dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Shankar
|last=Vedantam |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/04/AR2006060400618.html |title=Born With the Desire to Know the Unknown |work=The Washington Post |publisher=The Washington Post |page=A02 |date=2006-06-05 |accessdate=2006-06-07}} &quot;Conspiracy theories explain disturbing events or social phenomena in terms of the actions of specific, powerful individuals,&quot; said sociologist Theodore Sasson at Middlebury College in Vermont. By providing simple explanations of distressing events—the conspiracy theory in the Arab world, for example, that the [[September 11, 2001]], attacks were planned by the Israeli Mossad—they deflect responsibility or keep people from acknowledging that tragic events sometimes happen inexplicably.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Roger Cohen]], in an [[op-Ed]] for the [[New York Times]] propounded that, &quot;captive minds... resort to conspiracy theory because it is the ultimate refuge of the powerless. If you cannot change your own life, it must be that some greater force controls the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Roger ''The Captive Arab Mind'', The New York Times, December 20, 2010, [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/21/opinion/21iht-edcohen21.html?hp]&lt;/ref&gt;

Where responsible behavior is prevented by social conditions, or is simply beyond the ability of an individual, the conspiracy theory facilitates the emotional discharge or [[closure (psychology)|closure]] that such emotional ''challenges'' (after [[Erving Goffman]]){{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} require. Like [[moral panic]]s, conspiracy theories thus occur more frequently within communities that are experiencing [[Social alienation|social isolation]] or political dis-empowerment.

Sociological historian Holger Herwig found in studying German explanations for the origins of [[World War I]]:

:''Those events that are most important are hardest to understand, because they attract the greatest attention from myth makers and charlatans.''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

This normal process could be diverted by a number of influences. At the level of the individual, pressing psychological needs may influence the process, and certain of our universal mental tools may impose [[epistemology|epistemic]] 'blind spots'. At the group or sociological level, historic factors may make the process of assigning satisfactory meanings more or less problematic.

Alternatively, conspiracy theories may arise when evidence available in the public record does not correspond with the common or official version of events. In this regard, conspiracy theories may sometimes serve to highlight 'blind spots' in the common or official interpretations of events (Fenster, 1999).

====Media tropes====
Media commentators regularly note a tendency in news media and wider culture to understand events through the prism of individual agents, as opposed to more complex structural or institutional accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Emke, &quot;[http://www.cjc-online.ca/viewarticle.php?id=585&amp;layout=html Agents and Structures: Journalists and the Constraints on AIDS Coverage],&quot; ''Canadian Journal of Communication'' 25, no. 3 (2000), (accessed June 7, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; If this is a true observation, it may be expected that the audience which both demands and consumes this emphasis itself is more receptive to personalized, [[drama]]tic accounts of social phenomena.

A second, perhaps related, media trope is the effort to allocate individual responsibility for negative events. The media have a tendency to start to seek culprits if an event occurs that is of such significance that it does not drop off the news agenda within a few days. Of this trend, it has been said that the concept of a pure accident is no longer permitted in a news item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4217024.stm |title=The Blame Game |date=6 September 2005 |accessdate=2007-08-23 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, if this is a true observation, it may reflect a real change in how the media consumer perceives negative events.

Hollywood motion pictures and television shows perpetuate and enlarge belief in conspiracy as a standard functioning of corporations and governments. Feature films such as [[Enemy of the State (film)|Enemy of the State]] and [[Shooter (film)|Shooter]], among scores of others, propound conspiracies as a normal state of affairs, having dropped the idea of questioning conspiracies typical of movies of eras prior to about 1970. Shooter even contains the line, &quot;that is how conspiracies work&quot; in reference to the JFK murder. Interestingly, movies and television shows do the same as the news media in regard to personalizing and dramatizing issues which are easy to involve in conspiracy theories. ''[[Coming Home (film)|Coming Home]]'' converts the huge problem of the returning injured Vietnam War soldier into the chance that the injured soldier will fall in love, and when he does, the strong implication is that the larger problem is also solved. This factor is a natural outcome of Hollywood script development which wishes to highlight one or two major characters which can be played by major stars, and thus a good way of marketing the movie is established but that rings false upon examination. Further, the necessity to serve up a dubiously justified happy ending, although expected by audiences, actually has another effect of heightening the sense of falseness and contrived stories, underpinning the public's loss of belief in virtually anything any mass media says. Into the vacuum of that loss of belief falls explanation by conspiracy theory.

Too, the act of dramatizing real or fictional events injects a degree of falseness or contrived efforts which media savvy people today can identify easily. &quot;News&quot; today is virtually always dramatized, at least by pitting &quot;one side&quot; against another in the fictional journalistic concept that all stories must contain &quot;both sides&quot; (as though reality could be reduced to two sides) or by using more intensive dramatic developments similar to feature movies. That is, by obvious dramatizing, the media reinforces the idea that all things are contrived for someone's gain which could be another definition of, at least, political conspiracies theories.
--Dr. Charles Harpole in &quot;History of American Cinema&quot; Scribner/U. Calif Press.

====Fusion paranoia====
[[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]], a ''[[Washington Post]]'' journalist and critic of [[anti-war]] movements on both the left and right, coined the term &quot;fusion paranoia&quot; to refer to a political convergence of left-wing and right-wing activists around anti-war issues and [[civil liberties]], which he claimed were motivated by a shared belief in conspiracism or [[anti-government]] views.

[[Social critic]]s have adopted this term to refer to how the synthesis of paranoid conspiracy theories, which were once limited to American fringe audiences, has given them mass appeal and enabled them to become commonplace in [[mass media]], thereby inaugurating an unrivaled period of people actively preparing for [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] [[millenarianism|millenarian]] scenarios in the [[United States]] of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. They warn that this development may not only fuel [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf terrorism]] but have devastating effects on American political life, such as the rise of a revolutionary [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] movement capable of [[subversion (politics)|subverting]] the established political powers.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, Michael. 2003. ''A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America''. Berkeley: Univ. of California.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Pipes]] wrote in a 2004 [[Jerusalem Post]] article titled ''Fusion Paranoia'':

{{quote|Fears of a petty conspiracy – a political rival or business competitor plotting to do you harm – are as old as the human psyche. But fears of a grand conspiracy – that the Illuminati or Jews plan to take over the world – go back only 900 years and have been operational for just two centuries, since the French Revolution. Conspiracy theories grew in importance from then until World War II, when two arch-conspiracy theorists, Hitler and Stalin, faced off against each other, causing the greatest blood-letting in human history. This hideous spectacle sobered Americans, who in subsequent decades relegated conspiracy theories to the fringe, where mainly two groups promoted such ideas.

The politically disaffected: Blacks (Louis Farrakhan, Cynthia McKinney), the hard Right (John Birch Society, Pat Buchanan), and other alienated elements (Ross Perot, Lyndon LaRouche). Their theories imply a political agenda, but lack much of a following.

The culturally suspicious: These include &quot;Kennedy assassinologists,&quot; &quot;ufologists,&quot; and those who believe a reptilian race runs the earth and alien installations exist under the earth's surface. Such themes enjoy enormous popularity (a year 2000 poll found 43 percent of Americans believing in UFOs), but carry no political agenda.

The major new development, reports Barkun, professor of political science in the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, is not just an erosion in the divisions between these two groups, but their joining forces with occultists, persons bored by rationalism. Occultists are drawn to what Barkun calls the &quot;cultural dumping ground of the heretical, the scandalous, the unfashionable, and the dangerous&quot; – such as spiritualism, Theosophy, alternative medicine, alchemy, and astrology. Thus, the author who worries about the Secret Service taking orders from the Bavarian Illuminati is old school; the one who worries about a &quot;joint Reptilian-Bavarian Illuminati&quot; takeover is at the cutting edge of the new synthesis. These bizarre notions constitute what Michael Kelly termed &quot;fusion paranoia,&quot; a promiscuous absorption of fears from any source whatsoever.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pipes 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pipes, Daniel |title=Fusion Paranoia |year=2004 |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/525174951.html?dids=525174951:525174951&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jan+14%2C+2004&amp;author=DANIEL+PIPES&amp;pub=Jerusalem+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=13&amp;desc=Fusion+paranoia |accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his two volume work ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' Popper used the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; to criticize the ideologies driving [[fascism]], [[nazism]], and [[communism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Popper argued that totalitarianism was founded on &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; which drew on imaginary plots driven by paranoid scenarios predicated on tribalism, chauvinism, or racism. Popper did not argue against the existence of everyday conspiracies (as incorrectly suggested in much of the later literature). Popper even uses the term &quot;conspiracy&quot; to describe ordinary political activity in the [[History of Athens|classical Athens]] of [[Plato]] (who was the principal target of his attack in ''The Open Society &amp; Its Enemies'').

In his critique of the twentieth century totalitarians, Popper wrote, &quot;I do not wish to imply that conspiracies never happen. On the contrary, they are typical social phenomena.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dohloo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/books/popper_open_society.html |title=Extracts from &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies Volume 2: The High Tide of Prophecy: Hegel, Marx and the Aftermath&quot; by Karl Raimund Popper (Originally published 1945) |publisher=Lachlan Cranswick, quoting Karl Raimund Popper |accessdate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reiterated his point, &quot;Conspiracies occur, it must be admitted. But the striking fact which, in spite of their occurrence, disproved the conspiracy theory is that few of these conspiracies are ultimately successful. Conspirators rarely consummate their conspiracy.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;dohloo&quot;/&gt;

In a paper written in 2008, [[Cass Sunstein]], legal scholar, and Administrator of the White House [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]], wrote of appropriate government responses to conspiracy theories. In the paper he stated:

{{quote|What can government do about conspiracy theories? Among the things it can do, what should it do? We can readily imagine a series of possible responses. (1) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing. (2) Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories. (3) Government might itself engage in counterspeech, marshaling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories. (4) Government might formally hire credible private parties to engage in counterspeech. (5) Government might engage in informal communication with such parties, encouraging them to help. Each instrument has a distinctive set of potential effects, or costs and benefits, and each will have a place under imaginable conditions. However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories, which involves a mix of (3), (4) and (5).&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, Cass R. and Vermeule, Adrian, Conspiracy Theories (January 15, 2008).

==Fiction==
{{Main|Conspiracy fiction}}

Because of their dramatic potential, conspiracies are a popular theme in [[thriller (genre)|thrillers]] and [[science fiction]]. Complex history is recast as a [[morality play]] in which bad people cause bad events, and good people identify and defeat them. Fictional conspiracy theories offer neat, intuitive narratives, in which the conspirators' plot fits closely the dramatic needs of the story's plot. As mentioned above, the ''cui bono?'' aspect of conspiracy theories resembles one element of mystery stories: the search for a possibly hidden motive.

''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' was a 1964 comedy about modern nuclear warfare. The end of the world is precipitated by the delusions of General Jack D. Ripper who happens to be in control of a [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] nuclear air wing. General Ripper believes there is a [[Communist]] conspiracy which threatens to &quot;sap and impurify&quot; the &quot;precious bodily fluids&quot; of the American people with [[fluoridated water]].

''[[Conspiracy Theory (film)|Conspiracy Theory]]'' is a 1997 thriller about a taxi driver (played by [[Mel Gibson]]) who publishes a newsletter in which he discusses what he suspects are government conspiracies, and it turns out that one or more of them are true.

''[[The X-Files]]'' was a popular television show during the 1990s and early 2000s, which primarily followed the investigations of two FBI agents, [[Fox Mulder]] and [[Dana Scully]], who were sometimes helped by a group of conspiracy theorists known as [[The Lone Gunmen]]. Many of the episodes dealt with a plot for alien invasion overseen by elements of the [[United States|U.S.]] government, led by an individual known only as the [[Cigarette Smoking Man]] and an even more mysterious international &quot;Syndicate&quot;. The famous tag line of the series, &quot;The Truth Is Out There&quot;, can be interpreted as reference to the meaning-seeking nature of the genre [[Conspiracy theory#Psychological origins|discussed above]].

[[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'' is a broad satire on conspiracism in which the characters attempt to construct an all-embracing conspiracy theory starting with the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] and including the [[Bavarian Illuminati]], the [[Rosicrucian]]s, [[hollow Earth]] enthusiasts, the [[Cathar]]s, and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]].

The three-part novel [[Illuminatus!]] by Robert Shea and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] (published in 1975) is a highly satirical, psychedelic novel dealing with complex, Byzantine conspiracies nested within other larger conspiracies—with the scale of the plots and the audacity of their plotters expanding to enfold more and more minds as the story progresses, evolving to wrap itself around many extant conspiracy theories such as the ones revolving around the Bavarian Illuminati, the Masons, the Vatican, the Mafia, governments large and small, and fringe groups of both left and right-wing persuasions. Their plottings merge with the overarching plans of several fictitious organizations—and also an actual &quot;religion&quot; which conceives of itself as a joke, the [[Discordians]]. In an ironic twist of fate, [[Illuminatus!]] may have even caused the development of a real-world Discordian society (which manifests in loose clusters of affiliation, rather than as any formalized group) when the novel's cult success as a countercultural mainstay brought the &quot;holy writ&quot; of the Discordians, the [[Principia Discordia]], out of obscurity over the final three decades of the twentieth century. Shea and Wilson used witty quotes drawn from this comedic pamphlet glorifying [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the Greek goddess of chaos and discord, as opening lines for chapters of the ''Illuminatus!'' books.

Conspiracy theories have even influenced video games. The critically acclaimed RPG/shooter ''[[Deus Ex]]'', and its sequel (albeit to a lesser degree), ''Deus Ex: Invisible War'', draw upon conspiracy theories such as [[Majestic 12]], [[Area 51]], and the Illuminati.

Other novels, such as [[Dan Brown|Dan Brown's]] 2000 controversial book &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; have also popularized the idea of conspiracy theories. The book surrounds the quest of [[Robert Langdon]], a fictional Harvard University symbologist who is bent on uncovering the mysteries of a secret society known as the Illuminati. Brown's novel, and others alike, harp on the ideas of the unknown, a life source for conspiracy theorists.

[[Michael Barkun]], a political scientist specializing in the study of [[conspiracism]] in American culture, notes that a vast popular audience has been introduced by the 1997 film ''[[Conspiracy Theory (film)|Conspiracy Theory]]'' to the notion that the U.S. government is controlled by a [[Secret Team|secret team]] in [[black helicopter]]s – a view once confined to [[Radical Right|right-wing radicals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;

The '''Coral Sea Islands Territory''' includes a group of small and mostly uninhabited tropical islands and reefs in the [[Coral Sea]], northeast of [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. The only inhabited island is [[Willis Island (Coral Sea)|Willis Island]].  The territory covers 780,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, extending east and south from the outer edge of the Great Barrier Reef, and including Heralds Beacon Island, Osprey Reef, the Willis Group, and fifteen other reef/island groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geosci&quot;&gt;Geoscience Australia. [http://www.ga.gov.au/education/facts/dimensions/externalterr/coral.htm Coral Sea Islands]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Coral Sea Islands were first charted in 1803; in the 1870 and 1880s the islands were mined for guano but the absence of a permanent supply of fresh water prevented long-term habitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geosci&quot;/&gt; The territory was created in 1969 by the ''Coral Sea Islands Act'' (before, the area was considered part of Queensland) and extended in 1997 to include [[Elizabeth Reef|Elizabeth]] and [[Middleton Reef|Middleton]] Reefs nearly 800&amp;nbsp;km further South, already in the [[Tasman Sea]]. 

The two latter reefs are much closer to [[Lord Howe Island]], [[New South Wales]] (about 150&amp;nbsp;km) than to the southernmost island of the rest of the territory, Cato Island. The islands, cays and reefs of the [[Great Barrier Reef]] are not part of the territory, belonging to Queensland instead. The outer edge of the Great Barrier Reef is the boundary between Queensland and the Coral Sea Islands Territory.

The territory is a possession of [[Australia]], administered from [[Canberra]] by the [[Attorney-General's Department]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AussieAG&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author =  First Assistant Secretary, Territories Division | title = Territories of Australia | url = http://www.ag.gov.au/territories | publisher= Attorney-General's Department | date= 2008-01-30 | accessdate = 2008-02-07 | quote = The Federal Government, through the Attorney-General's Department administers Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Coral Sea Islands, Jervis Bay, and Norfolk Island as Territories. }}&lt;/ref&gt; (before 29 November 2007&lt;ref name=&quot;DOTARS&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author =  Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government | title = Territories of Australia | url = http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/territories/index.aspx | accessdate = 2008-02-07 | quote = As part of the Machinery of Government Changes following the Federal Election on 29 November 2007, administrative responsibility for Territories has been transferred to the Attorney General's Department. |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071216154140/http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/territories/index.aspx |archivedate = 2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; administration was carried out by the [[Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government (Australia)|Department of Transport and Regional Services]]). Defence is the responsibility of Australia, and the territory is visited regularly by the [[Royal Australian Navy]]. 

Australia maintains automatic weather stations on many of the isles and reefs, and claims a 200 [[nautical mile]] (370&amp;nbsp;km) exclusive [[fishing]] zone. There is no economic activity (except for a significant but as yet unquantified charter fishing and diving industry), and only a staff of three or four people to run the meteorological station on [[Willis Island (Coral Sea)|Willis Island]] (South Islet), established in 1921.

== Geography ==
There are about 30 separate [[reef]]s and [[atoll]]s, twelve being wholly submerged or drying only during low tide, and 18 others with a total of about 51 islets and [[cay]]s (18 alone on the atoll [[Lihou Reef National Nature Reserve|Lihou Reef]]), some of which are vegetated. &lt;!--The coral Sea is 3.9 miles deep--&gt; The atolls exhibit a wide range of size, from a few kilometres in diameter to perhaps the second largest atoll in the world by total area (including [[lagoon]]): '''Lihou Reef''', with a lagoon size of 100 by 30&amp;nbsp;km and an area of 2,500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which compares to a combined land area of the 18 individual islets of only 0.91&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The islands are all very low. The territory's [[FIPS 10-4]] code is CR, whereas [[ISO 3166]] includes it in Australia (AU).

The [[Willis Islets]] are important nesting areas for birds and turtles, but their natural resources are negligible. They comprise less than three square kilometres of land. There is no port or harbour, only offshore anchorage.

Most of the atolls fall into two groups, while '''Mellish Reef''' to the east, and '''Middleton Reef''' and '''Elizabeth Reef''' to the south are grouped separately:

===Northwestern Group===
# Osprey Reef (submerged atoll roughly oval in shape, measuring 25 by 12&amp;nbsp;km, covering around 195&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with lagoon up to 30&amp;nbsp;m deep)
# Shark Reef (small elongated submerged reef 15&amp;nbsp;km South of Osprey Reef, with a least depth of 7.8 m)
# Bougainville Reef (small submerged atoll, 2.5 by 4&amp;nbsp;km, area 8&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with lagoon, dries at half tide)
# East Holmes Reef (submerged atoll, about 14 by 10&amp;nbsp;km, area 125&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with lagoon)
# West Holmes Reef (submerged atoll 6&amp;nbsp;km East of East Holmes Reef, about 18 by 7&amp;nbsp;km, area 125&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with lagoon that is open on the West side, two small cays)
# Flora Reef (small submerged atoll, 5 by 4&amp;nbsp;km, about 12&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
# Diane Bank (sunken atoll, depths of less than 10&amp;nbsp;m over an area of 65 by 25&amp;nbsp;km, or 1300&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, along the northern edge 3 m deep, with Sand Cay in the Northwest, 3 m high)
# North Moore Reef (small submerged atoll, 4 by 3&amp;nbsp;km, area 8&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; including lagoon that is open on the Northwest side)
# South Moore Reef (small submerged reef 5&amp;nbsp;km South of North Moore Reef)
# [[Willis Island (Coral Sea)|Willis Islets]] (sunken atoll, bank 45 by 19&amp;nbsp;km, bank area more than 500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 3 islets on the Northwestern side: North Cay, Mid Islet almost 8 m high, South Islet or Willis Island 10 m high)
# Magdelaine Cays &amp; Coringa Islets (one large, partially sunken atoll structure, almost 90 by 30&amp;nbsp;km, bank area about 1500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 2 islets of the Magdelaine Cays in the North: North West Islet (area approximately 0.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and South East Cay (area 0.37&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;); 2 islets of the Coringa Islets 50 to 60&amp;nbsp;km further Southwest: Southwest Islet or Coringa Islet (area 0.173&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and Chilcott Islet (area 0.163&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;))
# Herald Cays, Northeast Cay (encircled by a reef of 3 by 3&amp;nbsp;km, total area 6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, land area 0.34&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
# Herald Cays, Southwest Cay (4&amp;nbsp;km Southwest of Northeast Cay, encircled by a reef of 2 by 2&amp;nbsp;km, total area 3&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, land area 0.188&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
# Lihou Reef and Cays (largest atoll in the coral sea, with a size of 2500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, land area 0.91&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
# Diamond Islets &amp; Tregosse Reefs (large, partially sunken atoll, 100 by 52&amp;nbsp;km, area of the bank over 3000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with 4 islets and 2 small submerged reefs in the Northeast and Southeast: West Diamond Islet, Central Diamond Islet, East Diamond Islet on the Northeastern rim of the former atoll, and South Diamond Islet, East Tregosse Reef and West Tregosse Reef on the Southern rim)
# North Flinders Reef (large atoll, 34 by 23&amp;nbsp;km, area 600&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with 2 islets, Flinders Cay being the larger one with a length of 200 m and a height of 3 m)
# South Flinders Reef (atoll, 15 by 5&amp;nbsp;km, 60&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
# Herald's Surprise (small submerged reef North of Flinders Reefs, 3 by 2&amp;nbsp;km)
# Dart Reef (small submerged reef Northwest of Flinders Reefs, 3 by 3&amp;nbsp;km, area 6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; including small lagoon that is open to the North)
# Malay Reef (small submerged reef, not clearly defined, no breakers, difficult to see)
# Abington Reef (submerged reef, nearly awash, 4 by 2.5&amp;nbsp;km, area 7&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
# Marion Reef (large circular atoll formation that is composed of three main units located on the Eastern side: Marion, Long and Wansfell; and a number of smaller reefs on the west. The formation sits atop a submarine feature known as the '''Marion Plateau''' which is separated from the larger Coral Sea Plateau to the north by the '''Townsville Trough'''. Three small sand cays are located on the eastern side of Marion Reef: Paget Cay, on Long Reef, Carola Cay, south of Long Reef, and Brodie Cay, on Wansfell Reef.

The atolls of the Northwestern Group, except Osprey Reef and Shark Reef in the North, and Marion Reef in the South, are located on the '''Coral Sea Plateau''' (Queensland Plateau), a contiguous area of depths less than 1000 m.

* '''Flinders Reefs''' (North and South), '''Herald's Surprise''' and '''Dart Reef''' form a cluster of reefs of 66 by 26&amp;nbsp;km.

* '''Magdelaine Cays''', '''Coringa Islets''' and '''Herald Cays''' are part of the 8856&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[Coringa-Herald National Nature Reserve]], created on 16 August 1982 and located around 400&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Cairns, Queensland|Cairns]] and 220 to 320&amp;nbsp;km from the outer edge of the Great Barrier Reef. The 6 islets of the nature reserve have areas from 0.16 to 0.37&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, for a total of 1.24&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

* '''[[Lihou Reef National Nature Reserve|Lihou Reef]]''' was declared a Nature Reserve on 16 August 1982, with an area of 8440&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The Nature Reserves were created to protect wildlife in the respective areas of the territory; together they form the [[Coral Sea Reserves Ramsar Site]].

===Mellish Reef===
#Mellish Reef, being about 300 kilometres to the east of the '''Northwestern Group''', thus the most distant from the Australian continent of all the reefs and atolls of the Coral Sea Islands Territory, is not considered to be part of any group. It has the outline of a boomerang-shaped platform around 10&amp;nbsp;km in length and 3&amp;nbsp;km across, area 25&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The surrounding reefs, which enclose a narrow lagoon, are completely submerged at high tide. Near the centre of the lagoon is the only permanent land of the reef - Heralds-Beacon Islet. The island is a small cay measuring 600 m by 120 m, area 57,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, only rising a few meters above the high water mark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceandots.com/pacific/coralsea/mellish.php Oceandots.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southeasterly Group===
#[[Frederick Reefs]]: The reefs form a semi-enclosed lagoon, known as Anchorage Sound, with an opening on the North side. The complex measures about 10 by 4&amp;nbsp;km, with an area of 30&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. On the southern side of the reef lies Observatory Cay, the only permanently dry land, although there are a few of others cays that can be awash at high tide.
#[[Kenn Reefs]], submerged atoll of about 15 by 8&amp;nbsp;km, area 40&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, islet Observatory Cay in the Southeast, 2 m high
#[[Saumarez Reefs]], southernmost reefs to be located on the Coral Sea Shelf; three main reefs and numerous smaller reefs that form a large crescent-shaped formation open to the northwest, about 27 by 14&amp;nbsp;km, area less than 300&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. There are two sand cays: North East Cay and South West Cay.
#[[Wreck Reefs]]: atoll 25 by 5&amp;nbsp;km, area 75&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, open on the North. Islets found on the reefs include Bird Islet, West Islet and Porpoise Cay.
#[[Cato Reef]]: Cato bank 21 by 13&amp;nbsp;km, area 200&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of depths less than 17 m; Cato Reef encircles an area of 3.3 by 1.8&amp;nbsp;km, area 5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; including lagoon; Cato Island, in the West of the lagoon, 650 by 300 m, area 1.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 6 m high. Close to the Southeast corner of Cato bank is Hutchison Rock, with 1 m depth over it.

===Extreme South===
[[Elizabeth Reef|Elizabeth]] and [[Middleton Reef|Middleton]] Reefs, together with reefs around [[Lord Howe Island]] ([[New South Wales]]) 150&amp;nbsp;km to the south, are regarded as the southernmost coral reefs in the world. Their location, where tropical and temperate ocean currents meet, contributes to an unusually diverse assemblage of marine species.
These mostly submerged atolls which dry only during low tide were added to the territory only in 1989. They are located on the [[Lord Howe Rise]] in the [[Tasman Sea]] which joins the [[Coral Sea]] in the South. Already on 23 December 1987, they were protected as the [[Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs|Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs Marine National Nature Reserve]], which has an area of 1880&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
#Middleton Reef, atoll about 8.9 by 6.3&amp;nbsp;km, area 37&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; including lagoon, one islet: Elizabeth island (Elizabeth cay), no vegetation, 600 meters by 400 meters (area 0.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), highest point close to the Northern end 1.5 meters. At low tides much of the reef flat is exposed.
#Elizabeth Reef, atoll about 8.2 by 5.5&amp;nbsp;km, area 51&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; including lagoon, one islet: The Sound, 100 by 70 meters (area 5,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), highest point 0.8 meters. At low tides much of the reef flat is exposed.

==History==
{{Main|History of Costa Rica}}

===Pre-Colombian period===
[[File:Pre-Columbian incense burner, Costa Rica (Carlos Museum).jpg|left|thumb|upright|A pre-Colombian [[incense]] burner with a [[crocodile]] lid (500 – 1350 AD), from Costa Rica]]

Historians have classified the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] of Costa Rica as belonging to the [[Intermediate Area]], where the peripheries of the [[Mesoamerican]] and [[Andean]] native cultures overlapped. More recently, [[Pre-Colombian era|pre-Colombian]] Costa Rica has also been described as part of the [[Isthmo-Colombian]] region. The northwest of the country [[Nicoya Peninsula]], was the southernmost reach of the [[Nahuatl]] culture when the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s arrived in the 16th century. The central and southern portions of the country had [[Chibcha]] influences.

The impact of the peoples on modern Costa Rican culture has been relatively small compared to other [[Latin America]]n nations, since the country lacked a strong native civilization to begin with and most of the indigenous people either died from diseases introduced by the Europeans, such as [[influenza]] and [[smallpox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html |title=The Story Of... Smallpox |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from mistreatment by the Spanish colonists. The remainder of the native population was mostly absorbed into the Spanish-speaking colonial society through [[miscegenation]], except for some small remnants, the most significant of which are the [[Bribri]] and [[Boruca]] tribes that still inhabit the mountains of the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]], in the southern part of Costa Rica, near the frontier with [[Panama]].

===Spanish colonization===
During most of the colonial period, Costa Rica was the southernmost province of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], which was nominally part of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (i.e., [[Mexico]]), but which in practice operated as a largely autonomous entity within the [[Spanish Empire]]. Costa Rica's distance from the capital in [[Guatemala]], its legal prohibition under Spanish law to trade with its southern neighbors in [[Panama]], then part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (i.e., [[Colombia]]), and the lack of resources such as [[gold]] and [[silver]], made Costa Rica into a poor, isolated, and sparsely inhabited region within the Spanish Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= A Brief History of Costa Rica: Colonial Times | url =http://www.horizontes.com/en/history.html | accessdate = 2007-12-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070922232020/http://www.horizontes.com/en/history.html |archivedate = September 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costa Rica was described as &quot;the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America&quot; by a Spanish governor in 1719.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Shafer, D. Michael |title=Winners and losers: how sectors shape the developmental prospects of states |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y. |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-8014-8188-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important factor behind Costa Rica's poverty was the lack of a significant indigenous population available for [[Encomienda|forced labor]], which meant that most of the Costa Rican settlers had to work on their own land, preventing the establishment of large ''[[hacienda]]s''. For all these reasons Costa Rica was by and large unappreciated and overlooked by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Crown]] and left to develop on its own. It is believed that the circumstances during this period led to many of the [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncrasies]] for which Costa Rica has become known, while concomitantly setting the stage for Costa Rica's development as a more [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] society than the rest of its neighbors. Costa Rica became a &quot;rural democracy&quot; with no oppressed [[mestizo]] or indigenous class. It was not long before [[Spanish people|Spanish]] settlers turned to the hills, where they found rich volcanic soil and a milder [[climate]] than that of the lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.costarica.com/Destinations/Cities-and-Towns/Cartago/ |title=Costa Rica – Cartago |publisher=Costarica.com |date=2009-05-22 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence===
Like the rest of Central America, Costa Rica never fought for independence from Spain. On [[September 15]] 1821, after the final Spanish defeat in the [[Mexican War of Independence]] (1810–1821), the authorities in Guatemala declared the independence of all of Central America. That date is still celebrated as Independence Day in Costa Rica, even though, technically, under the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] that had been re-adopted in 1820, [[Nicaragua]] and Costa Rica had become an autonomous province with its capital in [[León, Nicaragua|León]].

Like other Central Spanish nations, Costa Rica considered annexation to the short-lived [[First Mexican Empire]] of [[Agustín de Iturbide]], but, after its collapse in 1823, Costa Rica became instead a province of the new [[Federal Republic of Central America]], which theoretically existed from 1823 to 1839, but which exercised a very loose authority over its constituent provinces, particularly the poor and remote Costa Rica. In 1824, the Costa Rican capital was moved to [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]], leading to a brief outburst of violence over rivalry with the old capital, [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]]. While civil wars raged both among the provinces of the Federal Republic of Central America and between political factions within individual provinces, Costa Rica remained largely at peace.
[[File:First postal stamp CR 4 Reales 1863.jpg|thumb|upright|The 1849 [[Coat of arms of Costa Rica|national coat of arms]] was featured in the first [[postal stamp]] issued in 1862.]]

In 1838, long after the Federal Republic of Central America ceased to function in practice, Costa Rica formally withdrew and proclaimed itself sovereign. The considerable distance and poor communication routes between [[Guatemala City]] and the Central Plateau, where most of the Costa Rican population lived then and still lives now, meant that the local population had little allegiance to the federal government in Guatemala. From colonial times up to the present day, Costa Rica's reluctance to become politically tied with the rest of Central America has been a major obstacle to efforts for greater regional integration.

===Economic growth===
[[Coffee]] was first planted in Costa Rica in the early 19th century and was first shipped to [[Europe]] in 1843, soon becoming Costa Rica's first major export. Coffee production would remain Costa Rica's principal source of wealth well into the 20th century. Most of the coffee exported was grown around the main centers of population in the Central Plateau and then transported by oxcart to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] port of [[Puntarenas]]. Since the main market for the coffee was in Europe, it soon became a high priority to develop a transportation route from the Central Plateau to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. For this purpose, in the 1870s the Costa Rican government contracted with U.S. businessman [[Minor C. Keith]] to build a railroad to the [[Western Caribbean Zone|Caribbean]] port of [[Limón]]. Despite enormous difficulties with construction, disease, and financing, the railroad was completed in 1890.

Most Afro-Costa Ricans, who constitute about 3% of the country's population, descend from [[Jamaica]]n [[immigrants]] who worked in the construction of that railway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title= Blacks of Costa Rica | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.everyculture.com/Middle-America-Caribbean/Blacks-of-Costa-Rica.html | work =World Culture Encyclopedia | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-23 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States]] [[convicts]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] immigrants also participated in the construction project. In exchange for completing the railroad, the Costa Rican government granted Keith large tracts of land and a lease on the train route, which he used to produce [[banana]]s and export them to the United States. As a result, bananas came to rival [[coffee]] as the principal Costa Rican [[export]], while foreign-owned [[corporation]]s (including the [[United Fruit Company]]) began to hold a major role in the national economy.

===20th century===
Historically, Costa Rica has generally enjoyed greater peace and more consistent political stability compared with many of its fellow Latin American nations. Since the late 19th century, however, Costa Rica has experienced two significant periods of violence. In 1917–19, General [[Federico Tinoco Granados]] ruled as a military dictator until he was overthrown and forced into exile. The unpopularity of Tinoco's regime led, after he was overthrown, to a considerable decline in the size, wealth, and political influence of the Costa Rican military. In 1948, [[José Figueres Ferrer]] led an armed uprising in the wake of a disputed presidential election. With more than 2,000 dead, the resulting 44-day [[Costa Rican Civil War]] was the bloodiest event in Costa Rica during the twentieth century.

The victorious rebels formed a government junta that [[military of Costa Rica|abolished the military]] altogether and oversaw the drafting of a new constitution by a democratically elected assembly.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/opinion/07kristof.html?_r=1 The Happiest People]&quot;. The New York Times. January 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Having enacted these reforms, the junta relinquished its power on November 8, 1949, to the new democratic government. After the [[coup d'état]], Figueres became a national hero, winning the country's first democratic election under the new constitution in 1953. Since then, Costa Rica has held 13 presidential elections, the latest being in 2010. All of them have been widely regarded by the international community as peaceful and transparent.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Costa Rica}}

===Provinces, cantons, and districts===
[[File:Provinces Costa Rica.png|250px|thumb|Provinces of Costa Rica]]
{{Main|Provinces of Costa Rica|Cantons of Costa Rica}}

Costa Rica is composed of seven provinces, which in turn are divided into 81 cantons ({{lang-es|cantón}}, plural {{lang|es|''cantones''}}), each of which is directed by a mayor. Mayors are chosen democratically every four years by each canton's people. There are no provincial [[legislature]]s. The cantons are further divided into 421 districts ({{lang|es|''distritos''}}). The provinces are:

# [[Alajuela Province|Alajuela]]
# [[Cartago Province|Cartago]]
# [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]]
# [[Heredia Province|Heredia]]
# [[Limón Province|Limón]]
# [[Puntarenas Province|Puntarenas]]
# [[San José Province|San José]]

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Costa Rica}}

Costa Rica is located on the Central American [[isthmus]], lying between latitudes [[8th parallel north|8°]] and [[12th parallel north|12°N]], and longitudes [[82nd meridian west|82°]] and [[86th meridian west|86°W]]. It borders the [[Caribbean Sea]] (to the east) and the [[Pacific Ocean]] (to the west), with a total of {{convert|1290|km|mi|abbr=off}} of coastline, {{convert|212|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the Caribbean coast and {{convert|1016|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the Pacific.

Costa Rica also borders [[Nicaragua]] to the north ({{convert|309|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}} of border) and [[Panama]] to the south-southeast ({{convert|639|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}} of border). In total, Costa Rica comprises {{convert|51100|km2|sqmi|abbr=off|lk=on}} plus {{convert|589|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}} of [[territorial waters]].

The highest point in the country is [[Cerro Chirripó]], at {{convert|3819|m|ft|abbr=off}}, and is the fifth highest peak in Central America. The highest volcano in the country is the [[Irazú Volcano]] ({{convert|3431|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The largest lake in Costa Rica is [[Lake Arenal]].

Costa Rica also comprises several islands. [[Cocos Island]] ({{convert|24|km2|sqmi|disp=s}}) stands out because of its distance from continental landmass, {{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=on}} from [[Puntarenas]], but [[Calero Island]] is the largest island of the country ({{convert|151.6|km2|sqmi|disp=s}}). Over 25% of Costa Rica's national territory is protected by [[SINAC]] (the National System of Conservation Areas), which oversees all of the country's [[List of Conservation Areas of Costa Rica|protected areas]]. Costa Rica also possesses the greatest density of species in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inbio.ac.cr/es/biod/estrategia/estudio.html |title=estudiofi |publisher=Inbio.ac.cr |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of Costa Rica}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
Because Costa Rica is located between nine to ten degrees north of the [[Equator]], the climate is [[Tropical climate|tropical]] year round. However, the country has many [[microclimate]]s depending on elevation, rainfall, topography, and by the geography of each particular region.

Costa Rica's seasons are defined by how much rain falls during a particular period and not to the [[season|four seasons]] in the Northern Hemisphere. The year can be split into two periods, the dry season known to the residents as summer, and the rainy season, known locally as winter. The &quot;summer&quot; or dry season goes from December to April, and &quot;winter&quot; or rainy season goes from May to November, which almost coincides with the [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|Atlantic hurricane season]], and during this time it rains constantly in some regions.

The location that receives the most rain is the Caribbean slopes of the Central Cordillera mountains, with an annual rainfall of over {{convert|5000|mm|1|abbr=on|lk=out}}. Humidity is also higher on the Caribbean side than on the Pacific side. The main annual temperature on the coastal lowlands is around {{convert|27|°C|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} in the main populated areas of the Central Cordilera, and below {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}} on the summits of the highest mountains.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

According to the [[World Bank]], Costa Rica's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita is [[United States dollar|US$]]11,122 [[Purchasing Power Parity|PPP]] (as of 2009); however, this [[developing country]] still faces the fourth highest [[inflation]] rate in Latin America, lack of maintenance and new investment in infrastructure, a [[poverty]] rate estimated to be 5% to 8%,&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAEC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a 7.8% [[unemployed|unemployment rate]] (2009 est.),&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAEC&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Rank Order – Inflation rate (consumer prices) | date= | publisher= | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cs.html | work =CIA World Factbook | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-14 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[trade deficit]] of 5.2%. For the [[fiscal year]] 2007, the country showed a government [[Economic surplus|surplus]]. [[Economic growth]] in 2008 diminished to a 3% increase in the face of a global recession (down from 7% and 9% growth in the prior 2 years).&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAEC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Costa Rica: Economy | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2019.htm | work =U.S. State Department | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-02 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costa Rica's inflation rate was an estimated 9.3% in 2007 and increased to 13.9% in 2008, Latin America's 4th highest inflation rate for both years.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAEC&quot;/&gt; On October 16, 2006, a new [[currency exchange]] system was introduced, allowing the value of the CRC colón to float between two bands as done previously by [[Chile]]. The idea is that by doing so the Central Bank will be able to better tackle inflation and discourage the use of U.S. dollars. However, as of August 2009, the value of the colón against the dollar has decreased to 86% of its late-2006 value (see commonly available [[forex]] trading charts). The unit of [[currency]] is the [[Costa Rican colón|colón]], and as of October 2010 it trades around 507 to the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indicadoreseconomicos.bccr.fi.cr/indicadoreseconomicos/Cuadros/frmVerCatCuadro.aspx?idioma=1&amp;CodCuadro=%20400 |title=Tipo cambio de compra y de venta del dĂłlar de los Estados Unidos de AmĂŠrica |publisher=Indicadoreseconomicos.bccr.fi.cr |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 705 colones to the [[euro]].

The central government offers [[tax exemption]]s for those who are willing to invest in the country. Several global high tech corporations have already started developing in the area exporting goods including chip manufacturer [[Intel]], pharmaceutical company [[GlaxoSmithKline]], and consumer products company [[Procter &amp; Gamble]]. In 2006 Intel's microprocessor facility alone was responsible for 20% of Costa Rican exports and 4.9% of the country's GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eleconomista.es/empresas-finanzas/noticias/81837/10/06/Intel-supone-el-49-por-ciento-del-PIB-de-Costa-Rica.html |title=Intel supone el 4,9 por ciento del PIB de Costa Rica|date=2006-10-06|publisher=El Economista|accessdate=2008-04-13|language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/premium/publica/publica?COMPID=53410660334&amp;ID_PAGINA=22088&amp;ID_FORMATO=9&amp;turbourl=false|title=Intel fabrica el procesador &quot;más veloz del mundo&quot; en Costa Rica|date=2007-11-13|publisher=La Vanguardia|accessdate=2008-04-13|language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade with [[South East Asia]] and [[Russia]] boomed during 2004 and 2005, and the country obtained full [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum]] (APEC) membership in 2007 after becoming an observer in 2004.

In recent times [[pharmaceuticals]], financial outsourcing, software development, and [[ecotourism]] have become the prime industries in Costa Rica's economy. High levels of education among its residents make the country an attractive investing location. Since 1999, [[tourism]] earns more foreign exchange than the combined exports of the country's three main [[cash crops]]: [[bananas]], [[pineapples]] and [[coffee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ICT2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Departamento de Estadísticas ICT |url=http://www.visitcostarica.com/ict/backoffice/treeDoc/files/Anuario%20de%20Turismo%202006%20(VERSION%20FINAL).pdf|title=Anuário Estadísticas de Demanda 2006|publisher=Intituto Costarricense de Turismo|year=2006|language=Spanish|accessdate=2008-07-29|format=PDF}} Table 44 and 45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coffee production in Costa Rica|Coffee production]] has played a key role in Costa Rica's history and economy and by 2006 was the third cash crop export.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICT2006&quot;/&gt;

Costa Rica's location provides access to American markets as it has the same [[time zone]] as the central part of the United States and direct ocean access to [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. In a countrywide referendum on October 5, 2007, the voters of Costa Rica narrowly backed a free trade agreement, with 51.6% of &quot;Yes&quot; votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericapress.org/article.asp?lanCode=1&amp;artCode=5348 |title=Latinamerica Press |publisher=Latinamerica Press |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080510105108/http://www.latinamericapress.org/article.asp?lanCode=1&amp;artCode=5348 |archivedate = May 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eco-tourism]] draws many tourists to visit the extensive [[national parks]] and [[protected area]]s around the country. Costa Rica was a pioneer in this type of tourism, and the country is recognized as one of the few with true eco-tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | last = Honey | first = Martha | year = 1999 | title = Ecotourism and Sustainable Development: Who Owns Paradise?| page = 5| publisher = Island Press; 1 edition, Washington, D.C. | id = ISBN 1-55963-582-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the 2011 [[Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report|Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index]], Costa Rica ranked 44th in the world and second among [[Latin American]] countries after [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=TTCI2011&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_TravelTourismCompetitiveness_Report_2011.pdf| author=Jennifer Blanke and Thea Chiesa, Editors |year = 2011 | title = Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Report 2011 | publisher = [[World Economic Forum]], Geneva, Switzerland|accessdate=2011-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just considering the sub-index natural resources, Costa Rica ranks 6th worldwide in the natural resources pillar, but 104th in terms of its cultural resources due to the country's limited number of cultural sites.&lt;ref name=TTCI2011/&gt;

Costa Rica has also developed a system of [[Payment for ecosystem services|payments for environmental services]].&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Similarly, Costa Rica has a tax on water pollution to penalize businesses and homeowners that dump sewage, agricultural chemicals, and other pollutants into waterways.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Costa Rica taxing firms that dump wastewater into rivers,” EFE News Service, April 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, the Costa Rican government announced its intentions to become 100 percent carbon neutral before 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007549.html

In 1996, the Forest Law was enacted to provide direct financial incentives to land owners for the provision of environmental services.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; This helped reorientate the forestry sector away from commercial timber production and the resulting deforestation and helped create awareness of the services it provides for the economy and society (i.e. [[carbon fixation]], hydrological services such as producing fresh drinking water, biodiversity protection, and provision of scenic beauty).&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

Costa Rica's ecological reputation has been somewhat tarnished in recent times by its illegal shark finning industry, which is mainly run by Taiwanese ships and has decimated shark stocks in that region. Main customers are China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

==Foreign relations==
{{Main|Foreign relations of Costa Rica}}
Costa Rica is an active member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization of American States]]. The [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] and the [[United Nations University of Peace]] are based in Costa Rica. Costa Rica is also a member of many other international organizations related to [[human rights]] and [[democracy]].

A main [[foreign policy]] objective of Costa Rica is to foster human rights and sustainable development as a way to secure stability and growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rree.go.cr/?sec=ministerio&amp;cat=politica%20exterior |title=Costa Rican Ministry of International Relations Declaration of Objectives |publisher=Costa Rican Ministry of International relations |date= |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costa Rica is a member of the [[International Criminal Court]], without a [[Bilateral Immunity Agreement]] of protection for the [[United States military]] (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).

Costa Rica also has a long-term disagreement with Nicaragua over the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] which defines the border between the two countries; the disagreement arises regarding Costa Rica's rights of navigation on the river,the impact of Nicaraguan operations on the rivers such as dredging and the correct border near de Calero Island region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacion.com/2011-03-08/ElPais/UltimaHora/UH-HAYA1.aspx |title=IJC Court Ruling |publisher=nacion.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2009, the Hague(ICJ) court stated that The Costa Ricans had their rights to navigate for commercial purposes upheld and the right to subsistence fishing on their side of the river. An 1858 treaty extended navigation rights to Costa Rica, but Nicaragua denied that passenger travel and fishing were part of the deal, the court ruled that Costa Ricans on the river were not required to have Nicaraguan tourist cards or visas as Nicaragua alleged but, in a nod to the Nicaraguans, ruled that Costa Rican boats and passengers have to stop at the first and last Nicaraguan port along their route. They must also have an identity document or passport. Nicaragua can also impose timetables on Costa Rican traffic. Nicaragua may require Costa Rican boats to display the flag of Nicaragua but may not charge them for departure clearance from its ports. These were all specific items of contention brought to the court in the 2005 filing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/legal-services-litigation/12579933-1.html |title=IJC Court Ruling |publisher=Allbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2007, Costa Rica broke diplomatic ties with [[the Republic of China]] in [[Taiwan]], switching recognition to [[the People's Republic of China]]. Costa Rica was the first of the Central American nations to do so. President Óscar Arias Sánchez admitted the action was a response to economic exigency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/caribbean/4505299-1.html Costa Rica Boots Taiwan, Welcomes China In Diplomatic Switch] Date: 2007-06-14. Retrieved: 2010-05-20&lt;/ref&gt;

In appreciation, the People's Republic of China took upon themselves to build Costa Rica a brand-new, $100 million, state-of-the-art, soccer stadium in Parque la Sabana, located in the province of San José. Approximately 600 Chinese engineers and laborers took part in this project, and it was inaugurated in March 2011, with a match against China's national soccer team..

Costa Rica finished a term on the [[United Nations Security Council]], having been elected for a non-renewable two-year term in the [[United Nations Security Council election, 2007|2007 election]]. Its term expired on 31 December 2009; this was Costa Rica's third time on the Security Council.

[[Tortuguero National Park]]—the name ''Tortuguero'' can be translated as &quot;Full of Turtles&quot;—is home to [[Spider monkey|spider]], [[Howler monkey|howler]], and [[white-throated Capuchin]] monkeys; the [[three-toed sloth]] and [[two-toed sloth]]; 320 species of [[bird]]s; and a variety of [[reptile]]s. The park is recognized for the annual nesting of the endangered [[green turtle]] and is the most important nesting site for the species. Giant [[leatherback turtle|leatherback]], [[hawksbill turtle|hawksbill]], and [[Loggerhead Sea Turtle|loggerhead]] turtles also nest there.

The [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve]] is home to about 2,000 plant species,&lt;ref name = &quot;karttv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govisitcostarica.com/region/city.asp?cID=402 |title=Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve |publisher=Govisitcostarica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; including numerous [[orchid]]s. Over 400 types of birds and over 100 species of [[mammal]]s can be found there.&lt;ref name = &quot;karttv&quot;/&gt;

As a whole, around seven hundred species of birds have been identified in Costa Rica. The [[Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad]] is allowed to collect royalties on any biological discoveries of medical importance.

Costa Rica is a center of biological diversity for [[reptiles]] and [[amphibians]], including the world's fastest running lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana (''[[Ctenosaura similis]]'').&lt;ref name='Garland1984'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garland|first=T., Jr.|coauthors=|year=1984|title=Physiological correlates of locomotory performance in a lizard: an allometric approach|url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Garl1984.pdf|journal=American Journal of Physiology|issn=|volume=247|issue=5 Pt 2|pages=R806–R815|doi=|pmid=6238543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Costa Rica}}
{{Essay-like|date=November 2010}}

As of 2010, Costa Rica has an estimated population of 4,640,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://esa.un.org/unpp/p2k0data.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Whites and [[mestizo]]s make up 94% of the population,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2019.htm Costa Rica]&quot;. U.S. Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; while 3% are Black, or [[Afro-Costa Rican|Afro-Caribbean]], 1% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], 1% [[Chinese-Costa Rican|Chinese]], and 1% other.&lt;ref name=CIArace&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cs.html |title=Costa Rica: Ethnic groups |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also over 60,000 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] or indigenous inhabitants, representing 1.5% of the population. Most of them live in secluded reservations, distributed among eight ethnic groups: [[Quitirrisí]] (In the Central Valley), [[Matambú]] or [[Chorotega]] (Guanacaste), [[Maleku]] (Northern Alajuela), [[Bribri]] (Southern Atlantic), [[Cabécar]] (Cordillera de Talamanca), [[Guaymí]] (Southern Costa Rica, along the Panamá border), [[Boruca]] (Southern Costa Rica) and [[Térraba]] (Southern Costa Rica).

The population of European ancestry is primarily of [[Spanish people|Spaniard]] descent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cs.html|title=White Settlement in Costa Rica |publisher=Links.jstor.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; with significant numbers of [[Italians|Italian]], [[Germans|German]], [[English people|English]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[French people|French]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] and [[Polish people|Polish]] families, as well a sizable [[Jewish]] community. The majority of the Afro-Costa Ricans are [[Creole English]]-speaking descendants of 19th century black [[Jamaican]] immigrant workers.

The 2000 census classified 94% of the population as [[white]] or [[mestizo]] and less than 3% as [[black]] or [[Amerindian]]. Native and European mixed blood far less than in other Latin American countries. Exceptions are [[Guanacaste]], where almost half the population is visibly [[mestizo]], a legacy of the more pervasive unions between [[Spain|Spaniards]] colonists and [[Chorotega]] Amerindians through several generations and [[Limón]] where the vast majority of the Afro-Costa Rican community lives.

Costa Rica hosts many [[refugee]]s, mainly from [[Colombia]] and [[Nicaragua]]. As a result of that and [[illegal immigration]], an estimated 10-15% (400,000–600,000) of the Costa Rican population is made up of Nicaraguans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2019.htm www.state.gov]  Background Note: Costa Rica – People&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/23/world/fg-costa23 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Costa Rica Seeks to Shut Its Doors to Illegal Migrants From Nicaragua | first1=Marla | last1=Dickerson | first2=Rebecca | last2=Kimitch | date=2006-03-23 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Nicaraguans [[Human migration|migrate]] for seasonal work opportunities and then return to their country. Costa Rica took in many refugees from a range of other Latin American countries fleeing civil wars and dictatorships during the 1970s and 80s, notably from [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]], as well as people from [[El Salvador]] who fled from [[guerrillas]] and government [[death squad]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Biesanz, Karen Zubris; Biesanz, Mavis Hiltunen; Biesanz, Richard |title=The Ticos: Culture and Social Change in Costa Rica |publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] |location=Boulder |year= 1998|page=118 |isbn=1-55587-737-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Bank]], about 441,000 immigrants live legally in the country, the majority of them [[Nicaraguans]], while 127,060 Costa Ricans live abroad in the [[United States]], [[Panama]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Spain]], [[Mexico]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Venezuela]], [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPROSPECTS/Resources/334934-1199807908806/CostaRica.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
The [[World Bank]] estimates that the life expectancy at birth for Costa Ricans at 2008 is 79 years, a figure unchanged since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/costa-rica | title=Costa Rica Country Data | accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nicoya Peninsula]] is considered one of the [[Blue Zone]]s in the world, where people commonly live active lives past the age of 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/04/080414-longest-lived.html|title=Long-Lived Costa Ricans Offer Secrets to Reaching 100|publisher=[[National Geographic]] News|date=2008-04-14|author=Anne Casselman|accessdate=2011-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/LivingLonger/story?id=2843049&amp;page=1|title=Report from the 'Blue Zone': Why Do People Live Long in Costa Rica?|work=ABC News|author=[[Dan Buettner]]|date=2007-02-02|accessdate=2011-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 there were 0.58 new general practitioner consultations and 0.33 new specialist consultations per capita and a hospital admission rate of 8.1%. Preventative health care is also successful. In 2002, 96% of Costa Rican women used some form of contraception, and antenatal care services provided to 87% of all pregnant women. All children under one have access to well-baby clinics and the immunization coverage rate in 2002 was above 91% for all antigens.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Costa Rica has a very low malaria incidence of 48 per 100 000 in 2000 and no reported cases of measles in 2002. The perinatal mortality rate dropped from 12.0 per 1000 in 1972 to 5.4 per 1000 in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.099598 |last1=Unger |first1=Jean-Pierre|last2=Buitrón |first2=René |last3=Soors |first3=Werner |last4=Soors |pmc=2376989 | year=2008 |first4=W. |title=Costa Rica: Achievements of a Heterodox Health Policy |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=98 |issue= 4|pages=636–643 |url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/cgi/content/full/98/4/636 |pmid=17901439 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costa Rica has been cited in various journals as Central America's great health success story.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Its healthcare system is ranked higher than that of the United States, despite having a fraction of its GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jacob |first1=Brian | year=2009 |title=CLOSING THE GAPS: The Challenge to Protect Costa Rica's Health Care System |journal=The Georgetown Public Policy Review |issue= 77|url= http://www9.georgetown.edu/grad/gppi/GPPIReview/index.cfm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1940, government hospitals and charities provided most health care delivery. But since the 1941 creation of the Social Security Administration (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social - CCSS), Costa Rica has provided universal health care to its wage earning residents, with coverage extended to dependants over time. In 1973, the CCSS took over administration of all 29 of the country's public hospitals and all health care, also launching a Rural Health Program (Programa de Salud Rural) for primary care to rural areas, later extended to primary care services nationwide. In 1993, laws were passed to enable elected health boards that represented health consumers, social security representatives, employers, and social organizations. By the year 2000, social health insurance coverage was available to 82% of the Costa Rican population. Each health committee manages an area equivalent to one of the 83 administrative cantons of Costa Rica. There is Limited use of private, for-profit services (around 14.4% of the national total health expenditure). About 7 % of GDP is allocated to the health sector, and over 70% is government funded. There are some threats to the universal health care model.

Primary health Care facilities in Costa Rica include health clinics with a general practitioner, nurse, clerk, pharmacist and a primary health technician, around one per two population. In 2008 there were 5 specialty national hospitals, 3 general national hospitals, 7 regional hospitals, 13 peripheral hospitals, and 10 major clinics serving as referral centers for primary care clinics, which also deliver biopsychosocial services, family and community medical services and promotion and prevention programs. Patients can choose private health care to avoid waiting lists.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Costa Rica is among the [[Latin America]] countries that have became popular destinations for [[medical tourism]].&lt;ref name=Herrick&gt;{{Cite book|last= Herrick|first=Devon M.|title=Medical Tourism: Global Competition in Health Care|year =2007|pages= 4–6, 9|publisher=[[National Center for Policy Analysis]], Dallas, Texas| isbn =1-56808-178-2}} [http://www.unf.edu/brooks/center/pdfs/Medical%20Tourism%20Herrick.pdf Available in pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bookman&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bookman| first1=Milica Z.|last2=Bookman |first2=Karla R.| title =Medical Tourism in Developing Countries| year =2007| pages= 3–4, 58, 95, and 134–135|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]], New York|isbn =978-0-230-60006-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Costa Rica received 150,000 foreigners that came for medical treatment.&lt;ref name=Herrick/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bookman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stats&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health-tourism.com/medical-tourism/statistics/|title=Medical Tourism Statistics and Facts|publisher=Health-Tourism.com|accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costa Rica is particularly attractive to American tourists because of its proximity and short flight, the quality of medical services, and lower medical costs.&lt;ref name=Bookman/&gt;

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Costa Rica}}
[[File:Basilica de los Angeles 2007.jpg|thumb|Basílica de Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles (Basilica of Our Lady of the Angels), during 2007 pilgrimage.]]

[[Christianity]] is the predominant religion, and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] is the official [[state religion]] according to the 1949 Constitution, which at the same time guarantees freedom of religion.

According to the most recent nationwide survey of religion, conducted in 2007 by the University of Costa Rica, 70.5% of Costa Ricans are Roman Catholics, 44.9% of the population are practicing Catholics, 13.8% are [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Protestants]] (many of them Pentecostal), 11.3% report that they do not have a religion, and 4.3% belonged to another.

Because of the recent small but continuous immigration from [[Asia]] and the [[Middle East]], other religions have grown, the most popular being [[Buddhism]] (because of a growing [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] community of 40,000), and smaller numbers of [[Hindu]], [[Jewish]], [[Bahá’í]], and [[Muslim]] adherents.

The Sinagoga Shaarei Zion [[synagogue]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centroisraelita.com/ Centro Israelita de Costa Rica, Comunidad Judía de Costa Rica], Costa Rican Jewish Community&lt;/ref&gt; is near [[La Sabana Metropolitan Park]] in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]]. Several homes in the neighborhood east of the park display the [[Star of David]] and other Jewish symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles2/costarica.htm |title=Jewish Community in Costa Rica |publisher=Jcpa.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons) claim more than 35,000 members and has a temple in [[San José Costa Rica Temple|San Jose]] that served as a regional worship center for Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua, and Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/costa-rica Costa Rica]. LDS Newsroom. Retrieved 2008-12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they represent less than 1 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/sanjose/ |title=San José Costa Rica LDS (Mormon) Temple |publisher=Ldschurchtemples.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/temples/geographical/0,11380,1899-1---19,00.html |title=List of LDS (Mormon) temples in Central America and the Caribbean |publisher=Lds.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===

The primary language spoken in Costa Rica is [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Some native languages are still spoken in indigenous reservations the most numerically important are the [[Bribri language|Bribri]], [[Maléku language|Maléku]], [[Cabécar language|Cabécar]] and [[Ngäbere language]]s some of which have several thousand speakers in Costa Rica - others a few hundred. Some languages like [[Teribe language|Teribe]] and [[Boruca language|Boruca]] have less than a thousand speakers. A [[English-based creole language|Creole-English]] language (also known as [[Limonese Creole|Mekatelyu]])Jamaican Patois is spoken in the Caribbean coast. Around 10.7% of Costa Rica's adult population (18 or older) also speaks [[English language|English]], 0.7% [[French language|French]], and 0.3% speaks [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] or [[German language|German]] as a second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2008/marzo/11/pais1457622.html|title=Solo 1 de cada 10 adultos habla un segundo idioma|publisher=[[La Nación (Costa Rica)]]|author=Jairo Villegas|date=2008-03-13|accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Costa Rica}}
{{See also|Costa Rican cuisine}}
[[File:Gallo Pinto at breakfast.jpg|right|thumb|Costa Rican breakfast with [[gallo pinto]].]]
Costa Rica was the point where the [[Mesoamerica]]n and South American native cultures met. The northwest of the country, the Nicoya peninsula, was the southernmost point of [[Nahuatl]] cultural influence when the Spanish conquerors ([[conquistadores]]) came in the 16th century. The central and southern portions of the country had [[Chibcha]] influences. The Atlantic coast, meanwhile, was populated with African workers during the 17th and 18th centuries.

Costa Rican cuisine is a blend of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], Spanish, African and many other cuisine origins. Dishes like the very traditional [[Tamal (dish)|tamale]] and many other made of [[corn]] are the most representative of its indigenous inhabitants, and similar to other neighboring [[Mesoamerica]]n countries. Spaniards brought many new ingredients to the country from other lands, specially spices and domestic animals. And later in the 19th century, the African flavor did its presence with influence from other Caribbean mixed flavors. This is how Costa Rican cuisine today is very varied, with every new ethnic group who had recently become part of the country's population influencing the country's cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southerncostarica.biz/General/cat-others/Costarican-Typical-Food/179/|Costa Rican Typical Food]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=February 2011}}

As a result of the immigration of [[Spaniards]], their 16th century [[Spain|Spanish]] culture and its evolution marked everyday life and culture until today, with [[Spanish language]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] religion as primary influences.

The Department of Culture, Youth, and Sports is in charge of the promotion and coordination of cultural life. The work of the department is divided into Direction of Culture, Visual Arts, Scenic Arts, Music, Patrimony and the System of Libraries. Although the department creates many initiatives, they are constrained by lack of resources.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Permanent programs, such as the National Symphony Orchestra of Costa Rica and the Youth Symphony Orchestra, are conjunctions of two areas of work: Culture and Youth.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Dance-oriented genres like [[Soca music|soca]], [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[Bachata (music)|bachata]], [[Merengue music|merengue]], [[cumbia]] and [[Costa Rican swing]] are enjoyed increasingly by older rather than younger people. The guitar is popular, especially as an accompaniment to folk dances, however, the marimba was made the national instrument.

&quot;''Pura Vida''&quot; is the most recognizable phrase attached to Costa Ricans and it reflects the Costa Rican way of life. Often, people walking down the streets, or buying food at shops say hello by saying &quot;''Pura Vida''&quot; which means pure life, or good life. It can be phrased as a question or as an acknowledgement of one's presence. A recommended response to &quot;How are you?&quot; would be &quot;''Pura Vida''&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Costa Rica}}
[[File:Crschool.jpg|thumb|250px|Children in the classroom]]

The literacy rate in Costa Rica is 94.9%,&lt;ref&gt;CIA World Factbook, September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; one of the highest in the world. When the army was abolished in 1949, it was said that the &quot;army would be replaced with an army of teachers.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} [[Elementary school|Elementary]] and [[high school]]s are found throughout the country in practically every community. Universal [[public education]] is guaranteed in the constitution. Primary education is obligatory, and both preschool and high school are free. There are only a few schools in Costa Rica that go beyond the 12th grade. Students who finish 11th grade receive a Costa Rican Bachillerato Diploma accredited by the Costa Rican Ministry of Education.

There are both state and private universities, with the public universities being regarded as the best in the country, as well as being one of the best means of social mobility, given the large proportion of the budget spent to subsidize students from poor families. The University of Costa Rica has been awarded the title &quot;Meritorious Institution of Costa Rican Education and Culture&quot;. In recent years, many private universities and colleges have consolidated because demand for higher education exceeds places available in the public sector.

==Early history==
{{Main|Pre-Columbian history of Costa Rica}}
[[File:Ceramicas Nicoya.jpg|thumb|300px|Pre-Columbian Ceramics from Nicoya, Costa Rica]]
In [[Pre-Columbian]] times the [[Native American (Americas)|Native American]]s in what is now [[Costa Rica]] were part of a cultural complex known as the &quot;Intermediate Area,&quot; between the [[Mesoamerican]] and [[Andean]] cultural regions.

The northwest of the country, the [[Nicoya Peninsula]], was the southernmost point of [[Nahuatl]] cultural influence when the [[Spain|Spanish]] conquerors ([[conquistadores]]) came in the sixteenth century. The central and southern portions of the country had [[Chibcha]] influences. However, the indigenous people have influenced modern Costa Rican culture to a relatively small degree, as most of these died from diseases such as [[smallpox]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html The Story Of... Smallpox]&lt;/ref&gt; and mistreatment by the Spaniards.

===Spanish colonization===
The colonial period began when Christopher Columbus discovered the eastern coast of Costa Rica in 1502.  Numerous subsequent Spanish expeditions followed, eventually leading to the first Spanish settlement, Villa Bruselas in Costa Rica in 1524.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guiascostarica.com/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

During most of the colonial period, Costa Rica was the southernmost province of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], which was nominally part of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (i.e., [[Mexico]]), but which in practice operated as a largely autonomous entity within the [[Spanish Empire]]. Costa Rica's distance from the capital in [[Guatemala]], its legal prohibition under Spanish law to trade with its southern neighbors in [[Panama]], then part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (i.e., [[Colombia]]), and the lack of resources such as [[gold]] and [[silver]], made Costa Rica into a poor, isolated, and sparsely inhabited region within the Spanish Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= A Brief History of Costa Rica: Colonial Times | url =http://www.horizontes.com/en/history.html | accessdate = 2007-12-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070922232020/http://www.horizontes.com/en/history.html |archivedate = September 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costa Rica was described as &quot;the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America&quot; by a Spanish governor in 1719.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Shafer, D. Michael |title=Winners and losers: how sectors shape the developmental prospects of states |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y. |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-8014-8188-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important factor behind Costa Rica's poverty was the lack of a significant indigenous population available for [[Encomienda|forced labor]], which meant that most of the Costa Rican settlers had to work on their own land, preventing the establishment of large ''[[hacienda]]s''. For all these reasons Costa Rica was by and large unappreciated and overlooked by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Crown]] and left to develop on its own.  The small landowners' relative poverty, the lack of a large indigenous labor force, the population's ethnic and linguistic homogeneity, and Costa Rica's isolation from the Spanish colonial centers in Mexico and the Andes all contributed to the development of an autonomous and individualistic agrarian society. Even the Governor had to farm his own crops and tend to his own garden due to the poverty that he lived in. An [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] tradition also arose.  Costa Rica became a &quot;rural democracy&quot; with no oppressed [[mestizo]] or indigenous class. It was not long before [[Spanish people|Spanish]] settlers turned to the hills, where they found rich volcanic soil and a milder [[climate]] than that of the lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.costarica.com/Destinations/Cities-and-Towns/Cartago/ |title=Costa Rica – Cartago |publisher=Costarica.com |date=2009-05-22 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal Republic of Central America==
Costa Rica joined other Central American provinces in 1821 in a joint declaration of independence from Spain. After a brief time in the Mexican Empire of [[Agustín de Iturbide]] and [[Mexican Empire]]) Costa Rica became a state in the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] (''see:'' [[History of Central America]]) from 1823 to 1839. In 1824 the capital was moved to [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]], but following a rivalry with [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]] that was violent. Although the newly independent provinces formed a Federation, border disputes broke out among them, adding to the region's turbulent history and conditions. Costa Rica's northern [[Guanacaste Province]] was annexed from Nicaragua in one such regional dispute.

Following independence, Costa Ricans found themselves with no regular trade routes to get their coffee to European markets. This was compounded by transportation problems - the coffee-growing areas were on the Pacific Coast, and before the [[Panama Canal]] was opened, ships from Europe had to sail around [[Cape Horn]] in order to get to the Pacific Coast. This was overcome in 1843, when, with the help of [[William Le Lacheur]], a [[Guernsey]] merchant and shipowner, a regular trade route was established.

In 1856, [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]], an American [[Filibuster (military)|filibuster]] began incursions into Central America. After landing in Nicaragua, he proclaimed himself president of Nicaragua and re-instated [[slavery]].  He intended to expand into Costa Rica and after he entered Costa Rican territory, Costa Rica declared [[Campaign of 1856–1857|war]].  Led by Commander in Chief of the Army of Costa Rica, President [[Juan Rafael Mora Porras]], the filibusters were defeated and forced out of the country. Costa Rican forces followed the filibusters into [[Rivas, Nicaragua]], where in a final battle, William Walker and his forces were finally pushed back.  [[Juan Santamaría]], a drummer boy who lost his life torching the filibusters' stronghold, was killed in this final battle, and is today remembered as a national hero.

==Democracy==
An era of peaceful democracy in Costa Rica began in 1889 with elections considered the first truly free and honest ones in the country's history.

Costa Rica has avoided much of the violence that has plagued much of [[Central America]]. Since the late nineteenth century, only two brief periods of violence have marred its democratic development. In 1917-19, [[Federico Tinoco Granados]] ruled as a dictator, and, in 1948, [[José Figueres Ferrer]] led an armed uprising in the wake of a disputed presidential election. In 1949, José Figueres Ferrer abolished the [[army]]; and since then, Costa Rica has been one of the few countries to operate within the democratic system without the assistance of a military.

With more than 2,000 dead, the 44-day [[Costa Rican Civil War]] resulting from this uprising was the bloodiest event in twentieth-century Costa Rican history, but the victorious [[junta]] drafted a constitution guaranteeing free elections with universal suffrage and the abolition of the military. Figueres became a national hero, winning the first election under the new constitution in 1953. Since then, Costa Rica has held 13 presidential elections, the latest in 2010.

Once a largely agricultural country, the twin pillars of Costa Rica's current economy are technology and eco-tourism. Costa Rica's major source of export income is technology based. Microsoft, Motorola, Intel and other technology related firms have established operations in Costa Rica. Local companies create and export software as well as other computer related products. Tourism is growing at an accelerated pace and many believe that income from this tourism may soon become the major contributor to the nation's GDP. Traditional agriculture, particularly coffee and bananas, continues to be an important contributor to Costa Rica's export income.

'''[[Costa Rica]]''' is located on the [[Central American Isthmus]], surrounding the point 10° north of the [[equator]] and 84° west of the [[prime meridian]]. It borders both the [[Caribbean Sea]] (to the east) and the [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific Ocean]] (to the west), with a total of 1,228&amp;nbsp;km of coastline (212&amp;nbsp;km on the Caribbean coast and 1,016&amp;nbsp;km on the Pacific).

Costa Rica shares a border with [[Nicaragua]] to the north (309&amp;nbsp;km long border) and with [[Panama]] to the south (330&amp;nbsp;km long border). The area of Costa Rica is 51,100&amp;nbsp;km² of which 50,660&amp;nbsp;km² is land and 440&amp;nbsp;km² is water, making it slightly smaller than the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]].

==Physical geography==
The nation's [[terrain]] is coastal plain separated by rugged mountains, the Cordillera Central and the Cordillera de Talamanca, which form the spine of the country and separate the Pacific and Caribbean watersheds.  Costa Rica claims an [[exclusive economic zone]] of {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|lk=in}} and a [[Territorial waters|territorial sea]] of {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1}}. 

The spine of the country produces many major river systems.  Rivers draining into the Caribbean include:
* [[Colorado River (Costa Rica)|Colorado River]] (''Rio Colorado'')
* [[Pacuare River]] (''Rio Pacuare'')
* [[Reventazón River]] (''Rio Parismina'')
* [[Reventazón River]] (''Rio Reventazon'')
* [[Sixaola River]] (''Rio Sixaola'')

Rivers draining into the [[Lake Nicaragua]] or the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] ((''Rio San Juan''), whose waters eventually drains into the Caribbean, include:
* [[Sapoá River]] (''Rio Sapoá'')
* [[Frío River]] (''Rio Frío'')
* [[San Carlos River]] (''Rio San Carlos'')
* [[Sarapiquí River]] (''Rio Sarapiquí'')

Rivers draining into the Pacific Ocean include:
* [[Abangares River]] (''Rio Abangares'')
* [[Guacimal River]] (''Rio Guacimal'')
* [[Sierpe River]] (''Rio Sierpe'')
* [[Tempisque River]] (''Rio Tempisque'')
* [[Térraba River]] (''Rio Terraba'')

In the eastern half of the country, the San Juan River forms the northern border with [[Nicaragua]].

===Mountain ranges===
====Cordillera de Tilarán====
The Tilaran Range is part of the [[Continental Divide]] east of [[Lake Arenal]] and the nearby [[active volcano]] [[Arenal Volcano|Arenal]], and running into the [[Cordillera Central (Costa Rica)|Cordillera Central]] range further east.  It is located in the [[Abangares Canton|Abangares]] district of the province of [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]].

At the edge of the range is the [[Monteverde]] cloud forest preserve, a major [[ecotourism]] destination.

====Cordillera Central====
The [[Cordillera Central (Costa Rica)|Central Range]] continues the [[Continental Divide]] east of [[Cordillera de Tilarán]]. It has four large volcanoes: [[Poás Volcano|Poás]], [[Barva Volcano|Barva]], [[Irazú Volcano|Irazú]] and [[Turrialba Volcano|Turrialba]]. The highest peak is Irazú at 3,432 m.

====Cordillera de Guanacaste====
The [[Cordillera de Guanacaste|Guanacaste Range]] is in northern Costa Rica near the border with [[Nicaragua]]. The range forms part of the southern region of the [[Continental Divide]], the highest peak being the [[extinct]] [[stratovolcano]] [[Miravalles Volcano|Miravalles]] at 2,028 m.  Peaks include:
* [[Miravalles Volcano]] (2,028 metres)
* [[Orosí Volcano]] (1,659 metres)
* [[Rincón de la Vieja Volcano]] (1,916 metres)

====Cordillera de Talamanca====
Much of the [[Cordillera de Talamanca|Talamanca Range]] is included in the [[La Amistad International Park]], which also is shared between the two countries. The country's highest peaks lie in this mountain range: the [[Cerro Chirripó]] and the [[Cerro Kamuk]]. Much of the region is covered by the [[Talamancan montane forests|forest]].

====Cerros de Escazú====
The [[Cerros de Escazú]] borders the [[Costa Rican Central Valley|Central Valley]] to the south and is considered the northernmost portion of the Cordillera de Talamanca.

===Volcanoes===
:Four volcanoes (two of them active) rise near [[San Jose, Costa Rica|San Jose]], in the center of the country; one of the volcanoes, [[Irazu Volcano]], erupted destructively in 1963-1965.

== Climate ==
{{main|Climate of Costa Rica}}
The country has a [[Tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropical]] climate and is part of the [[Neotropic]] [[ecozone]]. It is part of many [[ecoregion]]s, including Costa Rican seasonal moist forests, Bocas del Toro-San Bastimentos Island-San Blas mangroves, Mosquitia-Nicaraguan Caribbean Coast mangroves, Southern Dry Pacific Coast mangroves, Central American dry forests, and Talamancan montane forests. An inlet from the Pacific the [[Gulf of Nicoya]] contains several small islands, the largest of these being [[Chira Island]] with a population of around four thousand.

Costa Rica's dry season in most places is from December to April, while the rainy season is from May to November. On the Caribbean coast, however, December is by far the wettest month. The highlands areas are always cooler. The lowest [[elevation]] levels in the country are on the western and eastern coasts, at [[sea level]]. The highest point is [[Cerro Chirripó]], a [[Volcano|volcanic]] mountain with an elevation of {{convert|3810|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} (part of [[Chirripó National Park]]). On a clear day, it is possible to see both the Caribbean and the Pacific from the peak.

== Ecology ==
Like all Central American countries, [[Costa Rica]] is considered part of a [[biodiversity hotspot]]. According to the [[INBio]], about 4.5% of the world's biodiversity can be found in Costa Rica.
[[Image:PN Braulio Carrillo.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Rainforest]] in Costa Rica]]
Costa Rica is home to about 12,119 species of [[plant]]s, of which 950 are [[endemism|endemic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rainforests.mongabay.com&quot;&gt;[http://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/2000/Costa_Rica.htm] Retrieved on August 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There are 117 native trees and more than 1,400 types of [[orchid]]s, a third of them can be found in the [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.monteverdeinfo.com/monteverde/orchid-garden/photo.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Almost a half of the country's land is covered by forests, though only 3.5% is covered by primary forests.&lt;ref name=&quot;rainforests.mongabay.com&quot;/&gt; [[Deforestation in Costa Rica|Deforestation]] is a devastating process, with more than 8,100 ha of forest being lost annually. The main reason for such high deforestation levels is to make plains for cattle ranching. 

[[Wildlife of Costa Rica|Wildlife diversity]] is very high; there are 441 species of [[amphibian]]s and [[reptile]]s, 838 species of [[bird]]s, 232 species of [[mammals]] and 181 species of fresh water fish. Costa Rica has high levels of [[endemism]]; 81 species of amphibians and reptiles, 17 species of birds and 7 species of mammals are endemic to the country. However, many species are [[endangered]]. According to the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]], 209 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and plants are endangered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep-wcmc.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the country's most endangered species are the [[Harpy eagle]], the [[Giant anteater]], the [[Golden toad]] and the [[Jaguar]]. [[IUCN]] reports the [[Golden toad]] as extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{IUCNlink|3172}} [[IUCN Red List]]'s article about the [[Golden toad]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protected areas ==
{{seealso|National Parks of Costa Rica|List of Conservation Areas of Costa Rica}}

The country is noted for its [[National Parks of Costa Rica|national park system]], administered by [[SINAC]] (''Sistema Nacional de Areas de Conservacion'', or &quot;National System of Conservation Areas&quot;). This agency oversees the 26 [[national park]], and more than 160 protected areas in Costa Rica.  The other types of protected areas in Costa Rica are National Wildlife Refuges, Biological Reserves, Protection Zones, and Absolute Nature Reserves.  Together the protected areas comprise over one-fourth of Costa Rican territory. 9.3% of the country is protected under [[IUCN]] categories I-V.

===Tortuguero National Park===
The creation of the [[Tortuguero National Park]] in 1970 gave much needed protection to one of the region's most important and unique natural resources: a 22 km stretch of shoreline that serves as the principal nesting site for sea turtles.

==International law==
Costa Rica is party to many environmental treaties, including the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the [[Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques|Convention on Environmental Modification]], the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], the [[Montreal Protocol]], the [[Ramsar Convention]], the [[International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling]], the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Desertification Convention]], the [[Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna|Endangered Species Convention]], the [[Basel Convention]], the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Convention on the Law of the Sea]], the [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping Wastes and Other Matter|Convention on Marine Dumping]], the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]]. It has signed but not ratified the [[Convention on Fishing and Conservation of Living Resources of the High Seas|Convention on Marine Life Conservation]] and the [[Kyoto Protocol]].

Central America gained independence from Spain on September 15, 1820.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Costa Rica]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

[[Image:Costa Rica demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of Costa Rica, Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]

According to the [[United Nations]], in 2009 [[Costa Rica]] has an estimated population of 4,579,000 people. Together, whites and mestizos make up a 94% of the population, 3% are [[black people]], 1% [[Amerindians]], 1% Chinese, and 1% other.

Just under 3% of the population is of black African descent who are called [[Afro-Costa Rican]]s and are [[English language|English-speaking]] descendants of 19th century black [[Jamaica]]n immigrant workers. Another 1% is composed of ethnic [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and less than 1% are [[Middle Easterner]]s, mainly of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] descent.

There is also a community of North American retirees from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], as well as [[Australian diaspora|Australians]].

The indigenous population today numbers about 60,000 (1% of the population) . Descendants of 19th century [[Jamaica]]n immigrant workers constitute an English-speaking minority and—at 3% of the population—number about 96,000.

An estimated 10% of the Costa Rican population is made up of [[Nicaragua]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2019.htm www.state.gov]  Background Note: Costa Rica - People&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a number of [[Colombia]]n refugees. Moreover, Costa Rica took in lots of refugees from a range of other [[Latin America]]n countries fleeing civil wars and dictatorships during the 1970s and 80s - notably from [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]].

Almost 100,000 Costa Ricans (2% of the country's population) live abroad, mostly in the [[United States]], [[Mexico]] and [[Spain]].

==Population and Ancestry==
In 2009, [[Costa Rica]] has a population of 4,579,000 and it's increasing at a rate of 1.52% per year, still relatively high. If this rate continues, the population will increase to 9,158,000 in about 46 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2006/WPP2006_Highlights_rev.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The population density is nearly 90 people per square km, the third highest in [[Central America]].&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_density&lt;/ref&gt;

Today most [[Costa Ricans]] are of primarily Spanish ancestry with minorities of German, Italian, Dutch and French ancestry or of [[Mestizo]] ancestry, both groups make up 94% of the population 80% being White and 14% being Mestizo. Costa Rica has three small minority groups: [[Black people|blacks]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] and [[Asian people|Asians]] (mostly [[Chinese people|Chinese]]). Blacks represent about 3% of the population. Indians and Asians represent 1.5% each.

Blacks live along the Caribbean Coast. Their ancestors came to Costa Rica from [[Jamaica]] in the late 19th century to build railroads and to work on the banana plantations. The Indians live primarily in isolated communities in the highlands and along both coasts. Most of them still keep their traditional ways of life.

Nearly all Costa Ricans speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; but many blacks speak a traditional Jamaican dialect of the [[English language|English]], also most of the Indians speak their [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|own language]]. According to the [[World Factbook]] the main religions are: Roman Catholic, 76.3%; Evangelical, 13.7%; Jehovah's Witnesses, 1.3%; other Protestant, 0.7%; other, 4.8%; none, 3.2%.

Approximately 40% live in [[rural area]]s and 60% in [[urban area]]s. The rate of urbanization estimated for the period 2005-2010 is 2.3% per annum,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2212.html?countryName=Costa%20Rica&amp;countryCode=cs&amp;regionCode=ca&amp;#cs&lt;/ref&gt; one of the highest among [[developing country|developing countries]].

===Education===
According to the [[UN]], Costa Rica's literacy rate stands at 95.8%,&lt;ref&gt;http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the fifth highest among [[Latin America|Latin American Countries]]. Costa Rica's [[Education Index]] in 2006 was 0.882; higher than that of richer countries, such as [[Singapore]] and [[Mexico]]. However Costa Rica's gross enrolment ratio is only 73.0%, smaller than that of the neighbors countries of [[El Salvador]] and [[Honduras]].&lt;ref&gt;http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/country_fact_sheets/cty_fs_CRI.html&lt;/ref&gt;

All students must complete [[Primary School]] and [[Secondary School]], between 6 and 15 years. But some students drop out because they must work to help support their families. In 2007 there were 536,436 pupils enrolled in 3,771 primary schools and 377,900 students attended public and private secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Costa Rica - MSN Encarta &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt;|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572479_3/Costa_Rica.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwbHIv21|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costa Rica's main [[Universities of Costa Rica|Universities]] are the [[University of Costa Rica]], in [[San Jose, Costa Rica|San Jose]] and the [[National University of Costa Rica]], in [[Heredia, Costa Rica|Heredia]]. Costa Rica also has several [[Private Universities]].

===Emigration and immigration===
Costa Rica's emigration is among the smallest in the [[Caribbean Basin]]. About 3% of the country's people live in another country as immigrants. The main destination countries are the [[United States]], [[Spain]], [[Mexico]] and other [[Central America|Central American Countries]]. In 2005, there were 127,061 Costa Ricans living in another country as immigrants. [[Remittance]]s were $513,000,000 in 2006 and they represented 2.3% of the country's GDP.

Costa Rica's immigration is among the largest in the [[Caribbean Basin]]. Immigrants in Costa Rica represent about 10.2% of the Costa Rican population. The main countries of origin are [[Nicaragua]], [[Colombia]] and [[El Salvador]]. In 2005, there were 440,957 people in the country living as immigrants. Outward Remittances were $246,000,000 in 2006.

{{Politics of Costa Rica}}
The politics of [[Costa Rica]] take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], with a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the president and his cabinet, and the [[President of Costa Rica]] is both the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica|Legislative Assembly]]. The president and 57 [[Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica|Legislative Assembly]] deputies are elected for 4-year terms. The [[Judiciary]] operates independent of the executive and the legislature. [[Costa Rica]] is a [[republic]] with a strong system of [http://hup.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/jpla/article/view/40/40 constitutional checks] and balances. Voting is compulsory in Costa Rica but it is not enforced.

The offices of the Comptroller General of the Republic, the Procurator General of the Public, and the Ombudsman exercise autonomous oversight of the government. The Comptroller General's office has a statutory responsibility to scrutinize all but the smallest contracts of the public sector and strictly enforces procedural requirements. Costa Rica has no military but maintains domestic Police and armed National Guard forces securing its interests.

The position of governor in the seven [[province]]s was abolished in 1998 [http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2007/junio/29/pais1150113.html]. There are no provincial legislatures. In 2009, the state monopolies on insurance and telecommunications (in which one often needed to wait months to get a cellular phone line) were opened to private-sector competition. Certain other state agencies enjoy considerable operational independence and autonomy; they include the electrical power, the nationalized commercial banks (which are open to competition from private banks), and the social security agency.

==Political parties==
Costa Rica's current leading [[Political party|political parties]] are:
* [[National Liberation Party (Costa Rica)]] (''Partido Liberación Nacional—PLN''). Founded in 1951 at the end of the civil war. [[Social Democracy|social democratic]].
* Citizen's Action Party (''[[Partido Acción Ciudadana]] -- PAC''). Founded 2000 by former PLN member; strong showings in 2002 and 2006 elections (30% of Assembly in 2006). Reformist, largely but not exclusively left and center left.
* Libertarian Movement Party (''[[Partido Movimiento Libertario]] -- PML''). Founded 1994; won 6 Congressional seats (10% of the Assembly) in 2002 and again in 2006. [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]].
* Social Christian Unity Party (''Partido Unidad Social Cristiana—PUSC''). Currently less popular than its past, after revelations of corruption, 3 seats in the Assembly. [[Christian Democracy|Christian democratic]].

Minor parties with 1 seat in the Assembly:
* [[Access without Exclusion]] (''Partido Accessibilidad Sin Exclusión—PASE.'') Fights for disabled people.
* [[Broad Front]] (''[[Partido Frente Amplio]] -- FA''). Left.
* National Union Party (''[[Partido Unión Nacional]] -- PUN''). Center right.
* [[National Rescue Party]] (Partido Rescate Nacional'').

Minor parties without congressional representation {{asof|2009|lc=1}}:
* [[Costa Rican Renovation Party]] (''Partido Renovación Costariccense'').
* [[Union for Change Party]] (''Partido Unión para el Cambio'').
* National Restoration Party (''[[Partido Restauración Nacional]] -- PRN''). Christian.
* [[Homeland First Party]] (''Partido Patria Primero'').

Several smaller new parties that participated for the first time in the 2006 elections include ''[[Partido Unión Patriótica]]'' and ''[[Partido Alianza Democrática Nacionalista]]''.

==History==
The 1986 presidential election was won by [[Óscar Arias]] of the PLN. During his tenure he experienced some criticism from within his own party for abandoning its traditional social democratic teachings and promoting a [[neoliberal]] economic model. He received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1987 for his efforts to end civil wars then raging in several Central American countries.

In the February 1998 national election, PUSC candidate [[Miguel Ángel Rodríguez]] won the presidency over PLN nominee [[Jose Miguel Corrales]]. President Rodriguez assumed office May 8, 1998. The PUSC also obtained 27 seats in the 57-member Legislative Assembly, for a plurality, while the PLN got 23 and five minor parties won seven. Social Christian in philosophy, the PUSC generally favors neoliberalism, conservative fiscal policies, and government reform. President Rodriguez pledged to reduce the country's large [[internal debt]], privatize state-owned utilities, attract additional foreign investment, eliminate social welfare programs, and promote the creation of jobs with decent salaries. The reforms he tried to promote found opposition from several parties, including his own, and he asserted several times the country was &quot;ungovernable&quot;. In particular, an attempt by the Legislative Assembly to approve a law that opened up the electricity and telecommunication markets (controlled by a monopoly of the Costa Rican Institute of Electricity - ICE) to market competition, known as the &quot;Combo&quot; law, was met with strong social opposition. The Combo law was supported by both major parties at the time (PLN and PUSC) as well as by President Rodriguez, but the first of three required legislative votes to approve it provoked the largest protest demonstrations the country had seen since 1970. The government quickly resolved to shelve the initiative. President Rodríguez's approval would reach an all-time low, and he was indicted by the Attorney General after leaving office on corruption charges.

In September 2000 the Constitutional Court rejected an argument by former president Arias that a 1969 constitutional amendment banning presidential reelection be rescinded. Arias thus remained barred from a second term as president; however, in April 2003–by which time two of the four judges who had voted against the change in 2000 had been replaced–the Court reconsidered the issue and, with the only dissenters being the two anti-reelection judges remaining from 2000, declared the 1969 amendment null and thus opened the way to reelection for former presidents–which in practice meant Arias.&lt;ref&gt;[http://impreso.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2007/07/18/nacionales/54109 &quot;Reelección seduce a los presidentes de America&quot;] El Nueavo Diario, Managua, 18 July 2007, retrieved July 2009; [http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2003/abril/05/pais1.html &quot;Reelección presidencial: Arias sin prohibición para postularse&quot;], La Nacion, Costa Rica, 5 April 2003; retrieved July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2002 national election, a new party founded by former PLN Congressman and government Minister [[Ottón Solís]] captured 26% of the vote, forcing a runoff election for the first time in the country's history. Abel Pacheco was elected President, under a national unity platform, but continuing most of the neoliberal and conservative policies of [[Miguel Ángel Rodríguez]]. This election was also important because new parties won several seats in Congress, more than ever. The PUSC obtained 19 seats, PLN 17 seats, PAC 14 seats, PML 6 seats and PRC one seat.

During 2004, several high-profile corruption scandals shattered the foundations of PUSC. Two former presidents from the party, Miguel Ángel Rodríguez and [[Rafael Ángel Calderón]], were arrested on corruption charges and are currently waiting for the investigation to end and trial to begin. Also involved in scandals has been [[José María Figueres]], former President from PLN and former head of the [[World Economic Forum]].

The 2006 national election was expected to be a landslide for former President (1986–1990) and PLN's candidate [[Óscar Arias]], but it turned out to be the closest in modern history. Although polls just a week before the election gave Arias a comfortable lead of at least 12% (and up to 20%), preliminary election results gave him only a .4% lead over rival [[Ottón Solís]] and prompted a manual recount of all ballots. After a month-long recount and several appeals from different parties, Arias was declared the official winner with 40.9% of the votes against 39.8% for Solís.

Since Óscar Arias returned to office, the political debate has centered on whether to approve or reject [[CAFTA]]. Main supporters of the approval include the President's PLN, which has established a coalition with PUSC and ML in Congress to approve the implementation laws in Congress, as well as different business chambers, while the main opposition to CAFTA comes from PAC, labor unions, environmental organizations and public universities. In April 2007, former PLN Presidential candidate and CAFTA opponent José Miguel Corrales won a legal battle at the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which authorized him to gather over 100 thousand signatures to send CAFTA to a referendum and let the people decide the fate of the controversial agreement. As the February 28, 2008 deadline to approve or reject CAFTA loomed, Arias decided to call for the referendum himself, and it took take place on October 7, 2007.

In spite of winning the referendum, each new law had to be analyzed and approved individually which has caused delays in Costa Rica's compliance to CAFTA. As of September 2008, only one law was remaining to be approved, but was delayed because it had a faulty procedure to be approved.

==Executive branch==
[[File:Laura-Chinchilla-cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Laura Chinchilla|Laura Chinchilla Miranda]], first female President of Costa Rica (2010–present)]]
Executive responsibilities are vested in a [[List of Presidents of Costa Rica|president]], who is elected directly by the voters, not by the National Assembly as it would be in a parliamentary system. There also are two vice presidents and the president's cabinet composed of his ministers [http://www.go.cr/consejo_gob_costarica.htm]. A constitutional amendment approved in 1969 limits presidents and deputies to one term, although a deputy may run again for an Assembly seat after sitting out a term. The prohibition was officially recognized as unconstitutional in April 2003, allowing [[Óscar Arias]] to run for President a second time in the [[Costa Rica presidential elections, 2006|2006 Costa Rican presidential elections]], which he won with approximately a 1% margin.

The President of Costa Rica has limited powers, particularly in comparison to other Latin American Presidents. For example, he or she cannot veto the legislative budget, and thus Congress is sovereign over the year's single most important piece of legislation. On the other hand, they can appoint anyone to their cabinet without any approval from Congress. This provides the single most important power versus Congress that any Costa Rican President has.

==Judicial branch==
Judicial power is exercised by the [[Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica|Supreme Court of Justice]], composed of 22 magistrates selected for renewable 8-year terms by the Legislative Assembly, and subsidiary courts. A Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, established in 1989, reviews the constitutionality of legislation and executive decrees and all habeas corpus warrants.

The '''economy of [[Costa Rica]]''' heavily depends on [[tourism]], [[agriculture]], and [[electronics]] exports. [[Poverty]] has been reduced over the past 15 years, and a social safety net put into place. 
According to the [[CIA World Factbook]], Costa Rica's GDP per capita is [[United States dollar|US$]]10,900 (2009); however, there is a lack of maintenance and new investment in infrastructure, 16% of the people living below the [[poverty]] line and 7.8% (2009) [[unemployed]]. The Costa Rican economy grew nearly 5% in 2006 after experiencing 4 years of slow economic growth.{{Failed verification|date=May 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Costa Rica: Economy | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2019.htm | work =U.S. State Department | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-02 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Inflation rose to 22.5% in 1995, dropped to 11.1% in 1997, 12% in 1998, 11% in 1999 and 13% in 2008. Measures taken by the Central Bank have reduced inflation substantially to 4.3% in 2009, and a projected 5.8% for 2010. Curbing [[inflation]], reducing the deficit, and improving public sector efficiency through an anti-corruption drive, remain key challenges to the government. Previous political resistance to [[privatization]] had stalled liberalization efforts. However, after the signing of [[CAFTA]], Costa Rica has now opened to competition its insurance and telecommunications markets.

Costa Rica's economy emerged from recession in 1997 and has shown strong aggregate growth since then. After 6.2% growth in 1998, GDP grew a substantial 8.3% in 1999, led by exports.

The strength in the nontraditional export and tourism sector is masking a relatively lackluster performance by traditional sectors, including agriculture. The central government deficit decreased to 3.2% of GDP in 1999, down from 3.3% from the year before. On a consolidated basis, including Central Bank losses and parastatal enterprise profits, the public sector deficit was 2.3% of GDP.

Controlling the budget deficit remains the single biggest challenge for the country's economic policy makers, as interest costs on the accumulated central government debt consumes the equivalent of 30% of the government's total revenues. This limits the resources available for investments in the country's deteriorated public infrastructure, investments in many cases that would result in higher quality infrastructure if they were better planned.

==Natural resources==
Costa Rica's major economic resources are its fertile land and frequent rainfall, its well-educated population, and its location in the Central American isthmus, which provides easy access to North and South American markets and direct ocean access to the European and Asian Continents. Costa Rica has two seasons, both of which have their own agricultural resources. The seasons are the basic, wet and dry, tropical seasons. One-fourth of Costa Rica's land is dedicated to national forests, often adjoining beaches, which has made the country a popular destination for affluent retirees and [[Ecotourism|ecotourists]].It has one of the best economies in Latin America
In terms of the 2008 [[Environmental Performance Index]] ranking, Costa Rica is 5th in the world, up from the 15th place in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Switzerland Tops 2008 Environmental Scorecard at World Economic Forum

==Tourism==
[[Image:Cataract on the Rio Savegre.jpg|175px|thumb|[[Ecotourism]] is key in [[Costa Rica]]'s tourism industry. Shown Savegre River, Talamanca.]]
{{Main|Tourism in Costa Rica}}
With a $1.92-billion-a-year [[tourism]] industry, Costa Rica stands as the most visited nation in the Central American region, with 1.9 million foreign visitors in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2007/diciembre/19/economia1358245.html|language=Spanish|publisher=Nación|date=2007-12-19|accessdate=2007-03-16|title=País cierra el año con llegada de 1,9 millones de turistas}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus reaching a rate of foreign tourists per capita of 0.46, one of the highest in the Caribbean Basin, and above other popular destinations such as Mexico (0.21), Dominican Republic (0.38), and Brazil (0.03). 

[[Ecotourism]] is extremely popular with the many tourists visiting the extensive [[national parks]] and [[protected area]]s around the country. Costa Rica was a pioneer in this type of tourism and the country is recognized as one of the few with real ecotourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | last = Honey | first = Martha | year = 1999 | title = Ecotourism and Sustainable Development: Who Owns Paradise?| page = 5| publisher = Island Press; 1 edition , Washington, D.C. | id = ISBN 1-55963-582-7 | quote= ...during the 1980s, ...the country transform itself from a low-key destination for nature lovers into the foremost ecotourism destination in the Americas. | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important market segments are adventure, and sun and beaches.

In terms of 2008 [[Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report|Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index]] (TTCI), Costa Rica reached the 44th place in the world ranking, being the first among [[Latin American]] countries, and second if the [[Anglophone Caribbean|Caribbean]] is included.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | first =  | year = 2008 | url=http://www.weforum.org/pdf/CGR08/Rankings.pdf |title = The Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Report 2008| page = | publisher = World Economic Forum, Geneva, Switzerland | author = Jennifer Blanke and Thea Chiesa, Editors | postscript =  &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just considering the subindex measuring human, cultural, and natural resources, Costa Rica ranks in the 24th place at a worldwide level, and 7th when considering just the natural resources criteria.

==Exports, jobs, and energy==
[[Image:Intel Costa 12 2007 SJO 105b.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Intel]] microprocessor facility in Costa Rica is responsible for 20% of exports and 4,9% of the country's [[GDP]].]]
Costa Rica used to be known principally as a producer of [[banana]]s and [[coffee]]. Even though coffee, bananas, [[pineapple]], [[sugar]], [[lumber]], [[wood]] products and beef are still important exports, in recent times [[electronics]], [[pharmaceuticals]], financial outsourcing, software development, and [[ecotourism]] have become the prime industries in Costa Rica's [[economy]]. High levels of [[education]] among its residents make the country an attractive [[investing]] location. 

The country has successfully attracted important investments by such companies as Intel Corporation, which employs nearly 3,500 people at its custom built $300 million microprocessor plant; [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], which is establishing its administrative center for the Western Hemisphere in Costa Rica; and Abbott Laboratories and Baxter Healthcare from the health care products industry likewise. Manufacturing and industry's contribution to GDP overtook agriculture over the course of the 1990s, led by foreign investment in Costa Rica's free trade zones. Well over half of that investment has come from the U.S. In 2006 [[Intel]]'s microprocessor facility alone was responsible for 20% of Costa Rican exports and 4.9% of the country's [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eleconomista.es/empresas-finanzas/noticias/81837/10/06/Intel-supone-el-49-por-ciento-del-PIB-de-Costa-Rica.html |title=Intel supone el 4,9 por ciento del PIB de Costa Rica|date=2006-10-06|publisher=El Economista|accessdate=2008-04-13|language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/premium/publica/publica?COMPID=53410660334&amp;ID_PAGINA=22088&amp;ID_FORMATO=9&amp;turbourl=false|title=Intel fabrica el procesador &quot;más veloz del mundo&quot; en Costa Rica|date=2007-11-13|publisher=La Vanguardia|accessdate=2008-04-13|language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Poas crater.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Poás Volcano National Park|Poás Volcano Crater]] is one of the country's main tourist attractions.]] 
Trade with [[South East Asia]] and [[Russia]] has boomed during 2004 and 2005, and the country obtained full [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum]] (APEC) membership by 2007 (the country became an observer in 2004). 

[[Tourism]] is booming, with the number of visitors up from 780,000 in 1996, through 1 million in 1999, to 2.089 million foreign visitors in 2008, allowing the country to earn $2.144-billion in that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2007/diciembre/19/economia1358245.html|language=Spanish|date=2007-12-19|accessdate=2008-04-13|publisher=La Nación|title=País cierra el año con llegada de 1,9 millones de turistas|author=Hassel Fallas}} Translation: Country closes year with the arrival of 1,9 million tourists&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism now earns more foreign exchange than bananas and coffee combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2004/diciembre/29/economia0.html |language=Spanish |date=2004-12-29|accessdate=2008-04-13|publisher=La Nación|title= Turismo, principal motor de la economía durante el 2004 |author=José Enrique Rojas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, tourism contributed with 8,1% of the country's GDP and represented 13,3% of direct and indirect employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Altés | first = Carmen | year = 2006 | title = El Turismo en América Latina y el Caribe y la experiencia del BID| page = 9 and 47| publisher = Inter-American Development Bank; Sustainable Development Department, Technical Paper Series ENV-149, Washington, D.C. ''available at'' http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=984876 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has not discovered sources of fossil fuels—apart from minor [[coal]] deposits—but its mountainous terrain and abundant rainfall have permitted the construction of a dozen [[hydroelectric power]] plants, making it self-sufficient in all energy needs, except oil for transportation. Costa Rica exports electricity to Central America and has the potential to become a major electricity exporter if plans for new generating plants and a regional distribution grid are realized. Mild climate and trade winds make neither heating nor cooling necessary, particularly in the highland cities and towns where some 90% of the population lives.

==Infrastructure==
Costa Rica's infrastructure has suffered from a lack of maintenance and new investment. The country has an extensive road system of more than 30,000 kilometers, although much of it is in disrepair. Most parts of the country are accessible by road. The main highland cities in the country's Central Valley are connected by paved all-weather roads with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and by the [[Pan American Highway]] with [[Nicaragua]] and [[Panama]], the neighboring countries to the North and the South. Costa Rica's [[port]]s are struggling to keep pace with growing trade. They have insufficient capacity, and their equipment is in poor condition. The railroad didn't function for several years, until recent government effort to reactivate it for city transportation.

The government hopes to bring foreign investment, technology, and management into the telecommunications and electrical power sectors, which are monopolies of the state. However, political opposition to opening these sectors to private participation has stalled the government's efforts.

Costa Rica has a reputation as one of the most stable, prosperous, and among the least corrupt in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Report 2007 |url=http://www.transparency.org/publications/gcr/download_gcr|accessdate=2008-03-11| author=Transparency International}} Costa Rica ranks 3rd among Latin American countries, and the 55th position worldwide.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in fall 2004, three former Costa Rican presidents ([[Jose Maria Figueres]], [[Miguel Angel Rodríguez]], and [[Rafael Angel Calderon]]) were investigated on [[Political corruption|corruption]] charges related to the issuance of government contracts, and several of the legal proceeding are still open.

== Trade policy ==

Costa Rica has sought to widen its economic and trade ties, both within and outside the region. Costa Rica signed a bilateral trade agreement with Mexico in 1994, which was later amended to cover a wider range of products. Costa Rica joined other Central American countries, plus the Dominican Republic, in establishing a Trade and Investment Council with the United States in March 1998.

* [[Costa Rica]] has bilateral free trade agreements with the following countries and blocs which took effect on (see date):
** [[Canada]] (November 1, 2002)
** [[Chile]] (February 15, 2002)
** [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM)¨ (November 15, 2002)
** [[Dominican Republic]] (March 7, 2002)
** [[El Salvador]] Customs union, (1963, re-launched on October 29, 1993)
** [[Guatemala]] Customs union, (1963, re-launched on October 29, 1993)
** [[Honduras]] Customs union, (1963, re-launched on October 29, 1993)
** [[Mexico]] (January 1, 1995)
** [[Nicaragua]] Customs union, (1963, re-launched on October 29, 1993)
** [[Panama]] (July 31, 1973, renegotiated and expanded for (January 1, 2009)
** [[United States]] (January 1, 2009)
** [[China]] under negotiation
** [[Singapore]] under negotiation
** [[European Union]] under negotiation

Costa Rica also is a member of the [[Cairns Group]] which is pursuing global agricultural trade liberalization in the World Trade Organization and helping to maintain the proper economy level in Costa Rica.

      <text xml:space="preserve">On December 1, 1948, [[List of Presidents of Costa Rica|President]] [[José Figueres Ferrer]] of [[Costa Rica]] abolished the '''military of Costa Rica''' after victory in [[Costa Rican Civil War|the civil war]] in that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elespiritudel48.org/docu/h013.htm|author=El Espíritu del 48|title=Abolición del Ejército|accessdate=2008-03-09}} (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;
In a ceremony in the ''Cuartel Bellavista'', Figueres broke a wall with a [[mallet]] symbolizing the end of Costa Rica's military spirit.
In 1949, the abolition of the military was introduced in Article 12 of the [[Costa Rican Constitution]].

[[Image:FigueresMuroCuartelBellavista.jpg|thumb|250px|[[José Figueres Ferrer]] breaking a wall of the ''Cuartel Bellavista'' symbolizing the abolition of the Military.]]

The budget previously dedicated to the military now is dedicated to security, education and culture; the country maintains Police Guard forces.
The museum ''Museo Nacional de Costa Rica'' was placed in the ''Cuartel Bellavista'' as a symbol of commitment to culture.

In 1986, President [[Oscar Arias Sánchez]] declared December 1 as the ''Día de la Abolición del Ejército'' (Military abolition day) with Law #8115.

Unlike its neighbours, Costa Rica has not endured a [[civil war]] since 1948.

Costa Rica maintains small forces capable of law enforcement and foreign peacekeeping, but has no permanent standing army.

==Ministry of Public Security's Public Force==
During 1996, the Ministry of Public Security established the ''Fuerza Pública'' or Public Force which reorganized and eliminated the [[Civil Guard (Costa Rica)|Civil Guard]], [[Rural Assistance Guard]], and [[Frontier Guard]]s as separate entities; they are now under the Ministry and operate on a geographic command basis performing ground security, law enforcement, counter-narcotics, and border patrol functions.

Outside the ''Fuerza Pública'', there is a small Special Forces Unit, the Unidad Especial de Intervencion (UEI) or Special Intervention Unit, which trains with special forces of Israel, and its namesake in Spain and other democratic nations, but is not part of the main police forces, instead it is part of the Intelligence and Security Directorate (DIS) which reports directly to the Minister of the Presidency.

==Weapons and equipment==
Weapons include [[M16 rifle|M16]]s, [[M4A1]]s, [[UZI]]s, [[MP5]]s and other weapons such as the [[M1911]] .45ACP and [[Beretta M9]] semiautomatic pistols.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Aircraft inventory==
There are 11 aircraft on government support, law enforcement, and civil duties.

[[Costa Rica]] is an active member of the international community and, in 1983, claimed it was for [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]]. Due to certain powerful constituencies favoring its methods, it has a weight in world affairs far beyond its size. The country lobbied aggressively for the establishment of the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] and became the first nation to recognize the jurisdiction of the [[Inter-American Human Rights Court]], based in [[San Jose]].

Then-President [[Óscar Arias]] authored a regional plan in 1987 that served as the basis for the [[Esquipulas Peace Agreement]] and Arias was awarded the 1987 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work. Arias also promoted change in the USSR-backed Nicaraguan government of the era. Costa Rica also hosted several rounds of negotiations between the [[El Salvador|Salvadoran Government]] and the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]] (FMLN), aiding El Salvador's efforts to emerge from civil war and culminating in that country's 1994 free and fair elections. Costa Rica has been a strong proponent of regional arms-limitation agreements. Former President Miguel Ángel Rodríguez recently proposed the abolition of all [[Central America]]n militaries and the creation of a regional counternarcotics police force in their stead.

With the establishment of democratically-elected governments in all Central American nations by the 1990s, Costa Rica turned its focus from regional conflicts to the pursuit of neoliberal policies on the isthmus. The influence of these policies, along with the US invasion of Panama, was instrumental in drawing [[Panama]] into the Central American model of [[neoliberalism]]. Costa Rica also participated in the multinational [[Partnership for Democracy and Development in Central America]].

Regional political integration has not proven attractive to Costa Rica. The country debated its role in the Central American integration process under former President Calderon. Costa Rica has sought concrete economic ties with its Central American neighbors rather than the establishment of regional political institutions, and it chose not to join the [[Central American Parliament]]. President Figueres promoted a higher profile for Costa Rica in regional and international fora. Costa Rica gained election as President of the Group of 77 in the [[United Nations]] in 1995. That term ended in 1997 with the South-South Conference held in San Jose. Costa Rica occupied a nonpermanent seat in the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] from 1997 to 1999 and exercised a leadership role in confronting crises in the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]], as well as in the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. It is currently a member of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]]. On Jan. 1 2008 Costa Rica started its third year term on the Security council.

Costa Rica strongly backed efforts by the United States to implement [[UN Security Council Resolution 940]], which led to the restoration of the democratically elected Government of [[Haiti]] in October 1994. Costa Rica was among the first to call for a postponement of the May 22 elections in [[Peru]] when international observer missions found electoral machinery not prepared for the vote count.

Costa Rica is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]], without a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]])

==Bilateral relations==
===China===
Costa Rica maintained official relations with the [[Republic of China]] (commonly known as &quot;[[Taiwan]]&quot;) instead of the [[People's Republic of China]] (commonly known as &quot;[[China]]&quot;) until June 1, 2007, when it opened relations with China. Taiwan then broke relations on June 7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2007/06/07/costa_rica_switches_allegiance_to_china_from_taiwan/ Costa Rica switches allegiance to China from Taiwan - Boston.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Strong economic ties existed between the two countries with projects having included the recent construction of a suspension bridge with Taiwanese capital to join the Costa Rican mainland with the Nicoya Peninsula. The bridge has been a boon for the tourist industry in the peninsula by reducing travel time to some locations by as much as two hours.

===Cuba===
Costa Rica broke relations with [[Cuba]] in 1961 in compliance with sanctions placed on the island by the [[Organization of American States]]. In 1995, Costa Rica established a [[consular office]] in [[Havana]]. Cuba opened a consular office in Costa Rica in 2001. On March 18, 2009 the Costa Rican government announced that it will reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba, the next day, the Government of Cuba announced that it agreed to reestablishing relations.

===Israel===
Until 2006 Costa Rica was only one of two countries that had its embassy to Israel sited in Jerusalem (it has since moved its mission to [[Tel Aviv]] which almost every country in the world that recognises Israel considers as its ''de jure'' capital).

===Nicaragua===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===Panama===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===Russia===
{{main|Costa Rica – Russia relations}}

Costa Rica has an [[embassy]] in [[Moscow]]. Russia has an embassy in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.costarica.mid.ru/ Embassy of the Russian federation in San José]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, holders of a [[Russian passport]] need a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to visit Costa Rica. With a [[Visa_(document)#Types_of_visa|tourist visa]], Russians can stay in Costa Rica for a maximum of 30 days. In order to get a tourist visa, the person needs to apply for it in the closest Costa Rican embassy to where the person is living. He/she must have a [[Passport|valid passport]] and either have an [[invitation letter]] or a [[bank statement]] with enough [[money]]. Holders of a [[Costa rican passport|Costa Rican passport]] also need a visa to Russia.

===United States===
{{main|Costa Rica – United States relations}}

The United States is Costa Rica's most important trading partner. The U.S. accounts for almost half of Costa Rica's [[exports]], [[imports]], and [[tourism]], and more than two-thirds of its foreign investment. The two countries share growing [[Environmental protection|concerns for the environment]] and want to preserve Costa Rica's important tropical resources and prevent environmental degradation. In 2007, the United States reduced Costa Rica's debt in exchange for protection and conservation of Costa Rican forests through a debt for nature swap under the auspices of the Tropical Forest Conservation Act. This is the largest such agreement of its kind to date.

{{linguistics}}
'''Computational linguistics''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field dealing with the [[Statistics|statistical]] and/or rule-based modeling of [[natural language]] from a computational perspective. This modeling is not limited to any particular field of [[linguistics]]. Traditionally, computational linguistics was usually performed by [[computer scientist]]s who had specialized in the application of computers to the processing of a [[natural language]]. Computational linguists often work as members of interdisciplinary teams, including linguists (specifically trained in linguistics), language experts (persons with some level of ability in the languages relevant to a given project), and computer scientists. In general, computational linguistics draws upon the involvement of [[linguistics|linguists]], [[computer science|computer scientists]], experts in [[artificial intelligence]], [[math]]ematicians, [[logic]]ians, [[philosophers]], [[cognitive science|cognitive scientists]], [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]], [[psycholinguistics|psycholinguists]], [[anthropology|anthropologists]] and [[neuroscience|neuroscientists]], among others.

Computational linguistics has applied and theoretical components, where Theoretical Computational linguistics takes up issues in theoretical linguistics and cognitive science and Applied Computational linguistics focusses on the practical outcome of modelling human language use.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Uszkoreit. What Is Computational Linguistics? [http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~hansu/what_is_cl.html] Department of Computational Linguistics and Phonetics of Saarland University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Computational linguistics as a field predates [[artificial intelligence]], a field under which it is often grouped. Computational linguistics originated with efforts in the [[United States]] in the 1950s to use computers to automatically translate texts from foreign languages, particularly [[Russian language|Russian]] scientific journals, into English.&lt;ref&gt;John Hutchins: [http://www.hutchinsweb.me.uk/MTS-1999.pdf Retrospect and prospect in computer-based translation.] Proceedings of MT Summit VII, 1999, pp. 30–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Since computers can make [[arithmetic]] calculations much faster and more accurately than humans, it was thought to be only a short matter of time before the technical details could be taken care of that would allow them the same remarkable capacity to process language.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold B. Barach: [http://www.flickr.com/photos/bostworld/2152048032/in/set-72157603898383698/ Translating Machine] 1975: And the Changes To Come.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[machine translation]] (also known as mechanical translation) failed to yield accurate translations right away, automated processing of human languages was recognized as far more complex than had originally been assumed. Computational linguistics was born as the name of the new field of study devoted to developing [[algorithm]]s and [[software]] for intelligently processing language data. When artificial intelligence came into existence in the 1960s, the field of computational linguistics became that sub-division of artificial intelligence dealing with human-level comprehension and production of natural languages.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In order to translate one language into another, it was observed that one had to understand the [[grammar]] of both languages, including both [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the grammar of word forms) and [[syntax]] (the grammar of sentence structure). In order to understand syntax, one had to also understand the [[semantics]] and the [[lexicon]] (or 'vocabulary'), and even to understand something of the [[pragmatics]] of language use. Thus, what started as an effort to translate between languages evolved into an entire discipline devoted to understanding how to represent and process natural languages using computers.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Nowadays research within scope of computational linguistics is done at Computational Linguistics Departments &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de Computational linguistics and phonetics at Saarland University]&lt;/ref&gt; and laboratories &lt;ref&gt;[http://vetsky.narod2.ru Yatsko's computational linguistics laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Subfields==
Computational linguistics can be divided into major areas depending upon the medium of the language being processed, whether spoken or textual; and upon the task being performed, whether analyzing language (recognition) or synthesizing language (generation).

[[Speech recognition]] and [[speech synthesis]] deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers. Parsing and generation are sub-divisions of computational linguistics dealing respectively with taking language apart and putting it together. Machine translation remains the sub-division of computational linguistics dealing with having computers translate between languages.

Some of the areas of research that are studied by computational linguistics include:
*[[Computational complexity]] of natural language, largely modeled on [[automata theory]], with the application of [[context-sensitive grammar]] and [[Linear bounded automaton|linearly-bounded]] [[Turing machine]]s.
*[[Computational semantics]] comprises defining suitable logics for [[linguistic meaning]] representation, automatically constructing them and reasoning with them
*Computer-aided [[corpus linguistics]]
*Design of [[parser]]s or [[phrase chunking|chunkers]] for [[natural language]]s
*Design of taggers like [[Part-of-speech tagging|POS-taggers (part-of-speech taggers)]]
*[[Machine translation]] as one of the earliest and least successful applications of computational linguistics draws on many subfields.

The [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] defines computational linguistics as:
:...the scientific study of [[language]] from a computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in providing [[computational model]]s of various kinds of linguistic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;The Association for Computational Linguistics [http://www.aclweb.org/archive/misc/what.html What is Computational Linguistics?]

'''[[Côte d'Ivoire]]''' (the '''Ivory Coast''') is a [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan]] nation in southern [[West Africa]] located at 8 00°N, 5 00°W. The country is shaped like a [[Square (geometry)|square]] and borders the [[Gulf of Guinea]] on the north [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the south (515&amp;nbsp;km of coastline) and five other [[Africa]]n nations on the other three sides, with a total of 3,110&amp;nbsp;km of [[border]]s: [[Liberia]] to the southwest (716&amp;nbsp;km), [[Guinea]] to the northwest (610&amp;nbsp;km), [[Mali]] to the north-northwest (532&amp;nbsp;km), [[Burkina Faso]] to the north-northeast, and [[Ghana]] to the east (668&amp;nbsp;km). In total, Côte d'Ivoire comprises 322,460&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, of which 318,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is land and 4,460&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is water, which makes the country slightly larger than the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Mexico]], or about the size of [[Germany]].

== Maritime claims ==
Côte d'Ivoire makes maritime claims of {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=off|lk=on}} as an [[exclusive economic zone]], {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=off|lk=off}} of territorial sea, and a {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=off|lk=off}} [[continental shelf]].

==Terrain and topography==
Côte d'Ivoire's [[terrain]] can generally be described as a large [[plateau]] rising gradually from [[sea level]] in the south to almost 500 m [[elevation]] in the north. The nation's natural resources have made it into a comparatively prosperous nation in the [[Economy of Africa|African economy]]. 
The southeastern region of Côte d'Ivoire is marked by coastal inland lagoons that starts at the Ghanaian border and stretch {{convert|300|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} along the eastern half of the coast. The southern region, especially the southwest, is covered with dense tropical moist forest. The [[Eastern Guinean forests]] extend from the Sassandra River across the south-central and southeast portion of Côte d'Ivoire and east into [[Ghana]], while the [[Western Guinean lowland forests]] extend west from the [[Sassandra River]] into [[Liberia]] and southeastern [[Guinea]]. The mountains of [[Dix-Huit Montagnes]] region, in the west of the country near the border with Guinea and Liberia, are home to the [[Guinean montane forests]]. 

The [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] belt extends across the middle of the country from east to west, and is the transition zone between the coastal forests and the interior [[savanna]]s. The forest-savanna mosaic interlaces forest, savanna and grassland habitats. Northern Côte d'Ivoire is part of the [[West Sudanian Savanna]] ecoregion of the [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] [[biome]]. It is a zone of lateritic or sandy [[soil]]s, with [[vegetation]] decreasing from south to north. 

The terrain is mostly flat to undulating [[plain]]s, with [[mountain]]s in the northwest. The lowest elevation in Côte d'Ivoire is at sea level on the coasts. The highest elevation is [[Mount Nimba]], at {{convert|1752|m}} in the far west of the country along the border with Guinea and Liberia.

==Rivers==

*[[Sassandra River]]
*[[Bandama River]]
*[[Komoé River]]

==Climate==
The [[climate]] of Côte d'Ivoire is generally warm and humid, ranging from [[equator]]ial in the southern coasts to [[Tropics|tropical]] in the middle and semiarid in the far north. There are three seasons: warm and dry (November to March), hot and dry (March to May), and hot and wet (June to October). Temperatures average between {{convert|25|and|32|°C|°F|1}} and range from {{convert|10|to|40|°C|°F}}.

==Crops and natural resources==
Côte d'Ivoire's also has a large [[timber]] industry due to its large [[forest]] coverage. The nation's [[hardwood]] exports match that of [[Brazil]]. In recent years there has been much concern about the rapid rate of [[deforestation]]. [[Rainforest]]s are being destroyed at a rate sometimes cited as the highest in the world. The only forest left completely untouched in Côte d'Ivoire is [[Taï National Park]] (''Parc National de Taï''), a {{convert|3600|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|lk=off}} area in the country's far southwest that is home to over 150 [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species and many other [[endangered species]] such as the [[Pygmy Hippopotamus]] and 11 species of [[monkey]]s.

Eight percent of the country is [[arable land]]. Côte d'Ivoire is the world's largest producer of cocoa, a major national [[cash crop]]. Other chief crops include [[coffee]], [[banana]]s, and [[oil palm]]s, which produce [[palm oil]] and kernels. [[Natural resource]]s include [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[diamond]]s, [[manganese]], [[iron]], [[cobalt]], [[bauxite]], [[copper]], and [[hydropower]].
There are more foreigners than Ivorians. Foreigners currently make up 67% of the country's population.

==Natural hazards==
[[Natural hazard]]s include the heavy surf and the lack of [[natural harbor]]s on the coast; during the rainy season torrential [[flood]]ing is a danger.

== Extreme points ==

This is a list of the extreme points of [[Cote d'Ivoire]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

* Northern-most point – the point at which the border with [[Mali]] enters the [[Bagoé river]], [[Savanes Region, Côte d'Ivoire|Savanes Region]], the [[Sahel]].
* Eastern-most point – unnamed location on the border with [[Ghana]] south-west of the town of [[Tanbi]], [[Zanzan]]
* Southern-most point – [[Boubré]], [[Bas-Sassandra]] region
* Western-most point -  unnamed location on the border with [[Liberia]] in the [[Nuon river]] west of [[Klobli]], [[Moyen-Cavally]] region

{{Politics of Côte d'Ivoire}}
The '''government of Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)''' takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] republic, whereby the [[President of Côte d'Ivoire]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a  [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and parliament.
The official capital since 1983 is [[Yamoussoukro]]; however, [[Abidjan]] remains the administrative center.  Most countries maintain their embassies in Abidjan, although some (including the United Kingdom) have closed their missions because of the continuing violence and attacks on Europeans.  The population continues to suffer because of an ongoing civil war.  International human rights organizations have noted problems with the treatment of captive non-combatants by both sides and the re-emergence of child slavery among workers in cocoa production. Since the incident on 19 September 2002 (see [[History of Côte d'Ivoire]]), a '''civil war''' broke out, and the north part of the country has been seized by the rebels, the [[Forces Nouvelles de Côte d'Ivoire|''New Forces'' (FN)]].  A new presidential election was expected to be held in October 2005.  However, this new election could not be held on time due to delay in preparation and has been postponed to October 2006 after an agreement was reached amongst the rival parties. After a long delay, elections were finally held in 2010.

==Civil war==
In the early hours of 19 September 2002 troops, who were mainly originally from the north of the country, mutinied.  They launched attacks in many cities, including Abidjan.  By lunchtime they had control of the north of the country.  Their principal claim relates to the definition of who is a citizen of Côte d'Ivoire (and so who can stand for election as president), voting rights and their representation in government in [[Abidjan]]. The events in Abidjan shows that it is not a tribal issue, but a crisis of transition from a dictatorship to a democracy, with the clashes inherent in the definition of citizenship.
Forces involved in the conflict include:
* Official government forces, the National Army (FANCI), also called ''loyalists'', formed and equipped essentially since 2003
* The [[Congrès Panafricaine des Jeunes Patriotes|''Young Patriots'']]: nationalist groups aligned with President [[Laurent Gbagbo]]
* [[Mercenaries]] recruited by President Gbagbo:
** allegedly, [[Belarus]]ians
** some former combatants of [[Liberia]], including under-17 youths, forming the so-called &quot;Lima militia&quot; [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/03/30/cotedi10404.htm]
* [[Forces Nouvelles de Côte d'Ivoire|''New Forces'' (Forces Nouvelles, FN)]], ex-northern rebels, who hold 60% of the country; their political expression is the ''Mouvement patriotique de Côte d'Ivoire'', or MPCI
* French forces: troops sent within the framework of [[Operation Unicorn]] and under [[UN Mandate|UN mandate]] ([[United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire|UNOCI]]), 3000 men in February 2003 and 4600 in November 2004;
* Soldiers of the [[CEDEAO]], ''White helmets'', also under the UN.

==Political conditions==
In a region whose political systems have otherwise been noted for lack of stability, Côte d'Ivoire showed remarkable political stability since its independence from France in 1960, until 2002.

''The contents of this section are outdated. See [[Civil war in Côte d'Ivoire]] for recent data.''

When many other countries in the region were undergoing repeated [[military coup]]s, experimenting with [[Marxism]], and developing ties with the [[Soviet Union]] and the People's Republic of China, Côte d'Ivoire - under [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]], president from independence until his death in December 1993 - maintained a close political allegiance to the Western World and good relationships with France and the United States. President Bédié is very familiar with the United States, having served as Côte d'Ivoire's first [[Ambassador (diplomacy)|ambassador]] to this country.

Looking toward the country's future, the fundamental issue is whether its political system will maintain the stability which is the [[sine qua non]] for investor confidence and further economic development. Côte d'Ivoire evolved, with relatively little violence or dislocation, from a single-party state, beginning in 1990. Opposition parties, independent newspapers, and independent [[trade union]]s were made legal at that time. Since those major changes occurred, the country's pace of political change has been slow. Whether further [[democracy|democratic]] reform will take place, adequate to meet future challenges, is unknown. As is generally true in the region, the business environment is one in which personal contact and connections remain important, where rule of law does not prevail with assurance, and where the legislative and judicial branches of the government remain weak. The political system remains highly centralized with the president dominating both the ruling party and the legislature and judiciary. Côte d'Ivoire's efforts to break down central state control of the economy are undermined by the state's continued central control of the political system.

Côte d'Ivoire has a high [[population growth rate]], a high crime rate (particularly in Abidjan), a high incidence of AIDS, a multiplicity of [[tribe]]s, sporadic student unrest, a different rate of in-country development according to region, and a dichotomy of religion associated with region and tribe. These factors put stress on the political system and will become more of a problem if the economy-not quite as dependent today on [[cocoa]] and coffee as it was some years ago but still dependent - takes a plunge similar to that of the 1980s.

The political system in Côte d'Ivoire is president-dominated. The Prime Minister concentrates principally on coordinating and implementing economic policy. The key decisions - political, military, or economic - continue to be made by President Bédié, as they were made by President Houphouët-Boigny. However, political dialogue is much freer today than prior to 1990, especially due to the opposition press, which vocalizes its criticism of the regime. The Ivorian Constitution affords the legislature some independence, but it has not been widely exercised. Until 1990, all legislators were from the PDCI. After the most recent elections (1995-1996), the PDCI continues to hold 149 out of 175 seats. The PDCI's &quot;core&quot; region may be described as the terrain of the [[Baoule]] tribe in the country's center, home of both Houphouët-Boigny and Bédié; however, the PDCI is well-entrenched in all parts of Côte d'Ivoire.

The remaining 26 seats in the National Assembly are divided equally by the only two other parties of national scope-the FPI ([[Ivorian Popular Front]]) and RDR (Rally of Republicans). The oldest opposition party is the FPI, a moderate party which has a socialist coloration but which is more concerned with democratic reform than radical economic change; it is strongest in the terrain of its Bete tribe leader, Laurent Gbagbo. The non-ideological RDR was formed in September 1994 by former members of the PDCI's reformist wing who hoped that former Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara would run and prevail in the 1995 presidential election (but who was disqualified by subsequent legislation requiring 5-year residency); it is strongest in the Muslim north.

The presidential election of October 1995 was boycotted by the FPI and RDR because of Ouattara's disqualification and the absence of an independent electoral commission (among other grievances). Their &quot;active boycott&quot; produced a certain amount of violence and hundreds of arrests (with a number of the arrestees not tried for 2-1/2 years). These grievances remain unaddressed, with the next round of elections coming in the year 2000.--&gt;

[[Côte d'Ivoire]]'s 1959 constitution provides for strong presidency within the framework of a [[separation of powers]]. The executive is personified in the [[President of Côte d'Ivoire|president]], elected for a five-year term. The president is commander in chief of the armed forces, may negotiate and ratify certain [[treaty|treaties]], and may submit a bill to a national [[referendum]] or to the [[National Assembly of Côte d'Ivoire|National Assembly]]. According to the constitution, the President of the National Assembly assumes the presidency in the event of a vacancy, and he completes the remainder of the deceased president's term. The cabinet is selected by and is responsible to the president. Changes are being proposed to some of these provisions, to extend term of office to 7 years, establish a senate, and make president of the [[senate]] interim successor to the president.

Laurent Gbagbo took power following a popular overthrow of the interim leader Gen. [[Robert Guéï]] who had claimed a dubious victory in presidential elections; Gen. Guéï himself had assumed power on 25 December 1999, following a military coup against the government of former President [[Henri Konan Bédié]]. Gbagbo was elected president in 2000 in an election boycotted bt many oppositional forces. The president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term; election last held 26 October 2000. The prime minister is usually appointed by the president. The present prime minister is  appointed by the international community (South African President Jacob Zuma, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and Niger President Mamadu Tandja.) as transitional Prime Minister following a resolution of the UN Security Council and a resolution of the African Union.

==Legislative branch==
The [[National Assembly of Côte d'Ivoire|National Assembly]] (''Assemblée Nationale'') has 225 members, elected for a five year term in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]]. It passes on legislation typically introduced by the president although it also can introduce legislation.
Côte d'Ivoire is a [[one party dominant state]] with the [[Ivorian People's Front]] in power.

==Political parties and elections==

After five years of delays, new elections were finally held in 2010. The first round of elections were held peacefully, and widely hailed as free and fair. Runoffs are scheduled for 28 November 2010, after being delayed one week from the original date of 21 November. Laurent Gbagbo will defend his post as president against former Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/11/10/ivory.coast.runoff/ |title=Ivory Coast postpones presidential runoff vote |author=Eric Agnero |date=10 November 2010 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial branch==
The judicial system culminates in the [[Supreme Court]]. The High Court of Justice is competent to try government officials for major offenses. The Supreme Court or Cour Supreme consists of four chambers: Judicial Chamber for criminal cases, Audit Chamber for financial cases, Constitutional Chamber for judicial review cases, and Administrative Chamber for civil cases; there is no legal limit to the number of members.

==Administrative divisions==
{{main|Départements of Côte d'Ivoire}}
For administrative purposes, Côte d'Ivoire is divided into 58 [[Department (subnational entity)|departments]], each headed by a [[prefect]] appointed by the central government. There are 196 [[commune (subnational entity)|commune]]s, each headed by an elected mayor, plus the city of [[Abidjan]] with ten mayors.

The 58 departments (''départements'', singular - ''département'') are listed in the article [[Départements of Côte d'Ivoire]].

There are also small ports at [[Sassandra]], [[Aboisso]], and [[Dabou]]. Two nationalized shipping lines serve West Africa and [[Europe]]. 

== Merchant marine ==
As of 1998, the merchant marine had one [[oil tanker]] (1,000 GRT or over) totalling 1,200 GRT. However, in 2002, there is no merchant marine. There are 980&amp;nbsp;km (56 mi) of navigable [[river]]s, [[canal]]s, and numerous coastal lagoons.

[[Nouvelle Air Ivoire]] is the national carrier of Côte d'Ivoire. Recently formed from the failed [[Air Ivoire]], the airline operates an aging fleet of Western-built aircraft. It is owned by Air France and the U.S. Finance company AIG. Air Ivoire was forced to cease operations a number of times due to technical and financial difficulties.

'''Security/Safety Concerns'''  
There is rampant corruption among airport officials in Côte d'Ivoire. Immigration officials have been known to ask for bribes to 'expedite' processing the forms, or to offer to fill out the customs forms prior to demanding a 'fee' for doing so. The anti-French sentiment, peaking in early 2003, spilled over onto airports when 1,500 French nationals were trapped in Abidjan's airport by an anti-French mob.

The '''National Armed Forces of Côte d'Ivoire''' ({{lang-fr|Forces armées nationales de Côte d'Ivoire}}; '''FANCI''') are the [[armed forces]] of [[Côte d'Ivoire]] (Ivory Coast). It is headed by the chief of staff and commander of the FANCI.

==Army==
===Organization===
In 1987 [[Côte d'Ivoire]] was divided into five military regions, each commanded by a [[colonel]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Library of Congress]], [http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-7024.html Cote d'Ivoire Country Study], circa 1987, accessed January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''First Military Region''' - The army had the majority of its forces concentrated in and around [[Abidjan]], its principal units there being a rapid intervention [[battalion]] (airborne), an [[infantry]] battalion, an armored battalion, and an air defense [[artillery]] battalion.
* '''Second Military Region''' - Located in [[Daloa]] and is assigned one infantry battalion.
* '''Third Military Region''' - Headquartered in [[Bouaké]] and home to an artillery, an infantry, and an engineer battalion (currently controlled by [[Forces Nouvelles de Côte d'Ivoire|FN forces]]).
* '''Fourth Military Region''' - Maintained only a Territorial Defense Company headquartered in [[Korhogo]] (currently controlled by [[Forces Nouvelles de Côte d'Ivoire|FN forces]]).
* '''Fifth Military Region''' - Formerly known as the Western Operational Zone, a temporary command created to respond to the security threat caused by the [[Liberian Civil War]].

==Gendarmerie==
The gendarmerie is roughly equivalent in size to the army. It is a national [[police]] force which is responsible for territorial security, especially in [[rural]] areas. In times of national crisis the gendarmerie could be used to reinforce the army. The gendarmerie is commanded by a [[colonel-major]] and comprises four Legions, each corresponding to one of the four numbered military regions, minus the temporary military operational zone on the western border.

==Navy==
Côte d'Ivoire has a [[brown-water navy]] whose mission is [[coast]]al surveillance and security for the nation's 340-mile coastline.

===Equipment===
* 1 Patra patrol craft - 147 tons full load - commissioned 1978
* 2 CTM LCM - 150t - commissioned 1968
* 2 Rodman 890 fishery protection - commissioned 1997

==Air Force==
The Air Force's official name, Ivoirian Air Transport and Liaison Group (''Groupement Aérien de Transport et de Liaison''--GATL), reflects an original mission focused more on logistics and transport rather than a combat force.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-7024.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, following an [[2004 French–Ivorian clashes|air strikes on French peacekeepers]] by Ivorian forces, the French military destroyed all aircraft in the Air Force of Côte d'Ivoire, including two [[Sukhoi 25]] ground-attack aircraft and three [[Mil Mi-24]] helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;

===Equipment===
Since 2004, efforts to put together some form of inventory have led to possibly as many six aircraft being in service by the end of 2006. It is unknown whether any of these aircraft are truly operational.

Its [[capital (political)|capital]] and largest city is [[Zagreb]]. Croatia borders [[Slovenia]] to the north, [[Hungary]] to the northeast, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] to the southeast, [[Serbia]] to the east, and [[Montenegro]] to the southeast.

The [[Croats]] arrived in the early 7th century in what today is Croatia. They organized the state into two dukedoms. The first king, King [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] was crowned in AD 925 and Croatia was elevated into the status of a kingdom. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]] retained its sovereignty for almost two centuries, reaching its peak during the rule of [[Kings of Croatia|Kings]] [[Peter Krešimir IV of Croatia|Peter Krešimir IV]] and [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]]. Croatia entered a union with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] in 1102. In 1527, the [[Parliament on Cetin|Croatian Parliament]] elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]] from the [[House of Habsburg]] to the Croatian throne. In 1918, Croatia was included in the short-lived [[State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs]] that declared independence from [[Austria–Hungary]] and co-founded the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. An [[Independent State of Croatia|independent Croatian state]] briefly existed during World War II. After [[World War II]], Croatia became a founding member of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Second Yugoslavia]].

On 25 June 1991, Croatia declared [[Statehood Day (Croatia)|independence]] and became a sovereign state.

Croatia is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]] and [[CEFTA]]. The country is a [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|candidate]] for [[European Union]] membership and is a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]]. Croatia is classified as an emerging and developing economy by the [[International Monetary Fund]] and a [[high income economy]] by the [[World Bank]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Croatia}}

===Croatia before Croats===
{{Main|Prehistoric Croatia}}
{{See also|Dalmatia (Roman province)|Pannonia Superior|Pannonia Inferior|Illyria}}
[[File:Oton Ivekovic, Dolazak Hrvata na Jadran.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oton Iveković]], ''The arrival of the Croats at the shores of [[Adriatic]]''.]]

The area known as Croatia today was inhabited throughout the [[prehistoric period]]. Fossils of [[Neanderthals]] dating to the middle [[Paleolithic]] have been unearthed in the area of [[Krapina]] and [[Vindija]]. More recent (late [[Mousterian]]) Neanderthal remains have been discovered in Mujina pećina near the coast.

In the early [[Neolithic]] period, the [[Starčevo-Körös|Starčevo]], [[Vučedol culture|Vučedol]] and [[Hvar culture]]s were scattered around the region. The [[Iron Age]] left traces of the [[Hallstatt culture]] (early [[Illyrians]]) and the [[La Tène culture]] ([[Celts]]).

Much later the region was settled by [[Liburnians]] and [[Illyrians]], and [[Greece|Greek]] colonies were established on the islands of [[Vis (island)|Vis]] (by [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]]) and [[Hvar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilkes |first=J. J. |title=The Illyrians |year=1992 |isbn=0631198075 |page=114 |quote=... in the early history of the colony settled in 385 BC on the island Pharos (Hvar) from the Aegean island Paros, famed for its marble. In traditional fashion they accepted the guidance of an oracle, ... |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 9&amp;nbsp;AD the territory of today's Croatia became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. Emperor [[Diocletian]] built a [[Diocletian's Palace|massive palace]] in [[Split (city)|Split]] where he retired from politics in AD 305.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward. ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Modern Library, New York, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; During the 5th century the last Roman Emperor [[Julius Nepos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/12*.html#4 |title=J. B. Bury, '&amp;#39;History of the Later Roman Empire'&amp;#39;, §4, p. 408 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ruled his small empire from Diocletian's Palace before he was killed in AD 480.

The early history of Croatia ends with the [[Eurasian Avars|Avar]] invasion in the first half of the 7th century and the destruction of almost all Roman towns. Roman survivors retreated to strategically better defended points on the coast, islands and mountains. The modern city of [[Dubrovnik]] was founded by those survivors.

[[Ethnogenesis]] of Croatian people (called [[White Croats]] before the migration) started with their emigration from the territory of [[White Croatia]], located in [[central Europe]], to the area of the present day Croatia and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

===Kingdom of Croatia===
{{Main|Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)}}
[[File:Bascanska ploca.jpg|thumb|left|[[Baška tablet]], oldest evidence of the [[Glagolitic alphabet|glagolitic script]].]]

The Croats arrived in what is today Croatia probably in the early 7th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Administrando Imperio]], Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos,''&lt;/ref&gt; They organized into two [[dukedom (administrative division)|dukedoms]]; [[Pannonian Croatia|the duchy of Pannonia]] in the north and [[Littoral Croatia|the duchy of Littoral Croatia]] in the south. Emperor [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] wrote that [[Porga of Croatia|Porga]], Duke of the Dalmatian Croats, who had been invited into Dalmatia by [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] [[Emperor Heraclius]], sent to Heraclius for [[Christian]] teachers.

According to Constantine, at the request of Heraclius, [[Pope John IV]] (640–642) sent Christian teachers and [[missionaries]] to the Croatian Provinces.&lt;ref&gt;''De Administrando Imperio, Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos]],'' chap. 31&lt;/ref&gt; These missionaries converted Porga, and also a great many of the clan that was under his immediate authority, to the Christian faith in 640.&lt;!-- NOTE THAT THE [[East–West Schism]] DID ''not'' HAPPEN UNTIL 1054  --&gt; The [[Christianization]] of the Croats was mostly complete by the 9th century. Both duchies became [[Francia|Frankish]] vassals in late 8th century, and eventually became independent in the following century.
[[File:Oton Ivekovic, Krunidba kralja Tomislava.jpg|thumb|[[Oton Iveković]], ''Coronation of King [[Tomislav]]'' in 925 AD]]

The first native Croatian ruler recognized by the [[Pope]] was duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]], whom [[Pope John VIII]] called ''dux Croatorum'' (&quot;duke of Croats&quot;) in 879.&lt;ref name=antoljak&gt;Stjepan Antoljak, Pregled hrvatske povijesti, Split 1993., str. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Duke [[Tomislav I of Croatia|Tomislav]] of Littoral Croatia was one of the most prominent members of the [[House of Trpimirović]]. He united the Croats of Dalmatia and Pannonia into a single Kingdom in 925. Traditionally it is stated that Tomislav's state extended from the Adriatic Sea to the [[Drava|Drava river]], and from the [[Raša|Raša river]] to the [[Drina|Drina river]], but the precise borders are unknown. Under his rule, Croatia became one of the most powerful kingdoms in [[Medieval Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[General Encyclopedia of the Yugoslavian Lexicographical Institute|Opća enciklopedija JLZ]]|work=[[Yugoslavian Lexicographical Institute]]|location=[[Zagreb]]|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomislav defeated the invasions of the [[Árpád dynasty|Árpáds]] in battle and forced them across the Drava. He also annexed a part of Pannonia. This included the area between the rivers Drava, [[Sava]] and [[Kupa River|Kupa]], so his Duchy bordered with [[Bulgaria]] for a period of time. This was the first time that the two Croatian Realms were united, and all Croats were in one state. The union was later recognised by Byzantium, which gave the royal crown to [[Stjepan Držislav]]&lt;ref&gt;Recipiebant enim regie dignitatis insignia ab imperatoribus Constantinopolitanis et dicebantur eorum eparchi siue patritii&lt;/ref&gt; and papal crown to king [[Zvonimir]]. The medieval Croatian kingdom reached its peak during the reign of Kings [[Petar Krešimir IV of Croatia|Petar Krešimir IV]] (1058–1074) and [[Zvonimir]] (1075–1089).

The Kingdom of Croatia existed from its foundation in 925 until the end of [[World War I]], initially as an independent [[Monarchy|kingdom]] and later as a crown in multiethnic empires such as the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|High Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Habsburg monarchy]] and [[Austria-Hungary]].

Following the [[Galton–Watson process|extinction]] of the Croatian ruling dynasty in 1091, [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]], the brother of [[Jelena Lijepa]], the last Croatian queen, became the king of Croatia. Croatian nobility of the Littoral opposed this crowning, which led to 10&amp;nbsp;years of war and the recognition of the Hungarian ruler [[Coloman of Hungary|Coloman]] as the king of Croatia and Hungary in the treaty of 1102 (often referred to as the ''[[Pacta conventa (Croatia)|Pacta conventa]]''). In return, Coloman promised to maintain Croatia as a separate kingdom, not to settle Croatia with Hungarians, to guarantee Croatia's self-governance under a [[Ban (title)|Ban]], and to respect all the rights, laws and privileges of the Croatian Kingdom. During this union, the Kingdom of Croatia never lost the right to elect its own king, had the ruling dynasty become extinct. In [[Charles Martel of Anjou|1293]] and [[Ladislas of Naples|1403]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ivan Stagličić |url=http://www.zadarskilist.hr/clanci/07072008/kako-je-i-zasto-ladislav-prodao-dalmaciju |title=Kako je Ladislav prodao Dalmaciju |publisher=Zadarskilist.hr |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croatia chose its own king, but in both cases the Kingdom of Hungary declared war and the union was reestablished.

For the next four centuries, the Kingdom of Croatia was ruled by the [[Sabor]] and Bans appointed by the Hungarian king. The Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia remained a legally distinct constitutional entity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staff.lib.msu.edu/sowards/balkan/lect07.htm |title=Michigan state university libraries-Steven W. Sowards:25 lectures on modern Balkan history |publisher=Staff.lib.msu.edu |date=2009-06-11 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the advent of a Hungarian king brought about other consequences such as: the introduction of [[feudalism]] and the rise of native noble families such as the [[Frankopan]]s and the [[Šubić]]s. The 1273 ''Congregatio Regni tocius Sclavonie Generalis'', the oldest surviving document written by the Croatian parliament, dates from this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;sabor.hr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=404 |title=History of Croatian parliament on Croatian |publisher=Sabor.hr |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent kings sought to restore some of their previously lost influence by granting certain privileges to towns.
The first period of personal union between Croatia and Hungary ended in 1526 with the [[Battle of Mohács]] and the defeat of Hungarian forces by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. After the death of King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]], Croatian nobles at the [[Cetingrad]] assembly chose the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Habsburgs]] as new rulers of the Kingdom of Croatia, under the condition that they provide the troops and finances required to protect Croatia against the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;sabor.hr&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milan Kruhek: Cetin, grad izbornog sabora Kraljevine Hrvatske 1527, Karlovačka Županija, 1997, Karlovac&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Dubrovnik]]/''Ragusa'' was founded in 7th century&lt;ref name=Paton&gt;Andrew Archibald Paton (1861). ''Researches on the Danube and the Adriatic; Or Contributions to the Modern History of Hungary and Translvania, Dalmatia and Croatia, Servia and Bulgaria'', Brockhaus&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Eurasian Avars|Avar]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] raiders destroyed the Roman city of [[Epidaurum]]. The surviving Roman population escaped to a small island near the coast where they founded a new settlement. During the [[Fourth Crusade]] the city fell under control of the [[Republic of Venice]] until the 1358 [[Treaty of Zadar|Zadar treaty]] when Venice, defeated by the Hungarian kingdom, lost control of Dalmatia and the [[Republic of Ragusa]] became a tributary of that kingdom.

Through the next 450&amp;nbsp;years the Republic of Ragusa would be a tributary Republic protected by [[Ottomans]] and [[Habsburgs]] until [[Napoleon]] abolished it in 1808 when Ragusa, Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia was briefly the [[Illyrian Provinces]]. During this time the republic became rich through trade.

The republic became the most important publisher of [[Croatian literature]] during the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods. Aside from poets and writers like [[Marin Držić]] and [[Ivan Gundulić]], whose works were important for Croat literature development, the most famous person from the Republic of Dubrovnik was the scientist [[Ruđer Josip Bošković]], who was a member of the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. The republic would survive until 1808 when it was annexed by [[Napoleon]]. Today the city of Dubrovnik features on the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] list and is a famous tourist destination.

===Ottoman Wars===
{{See also|Croatian–Ottoman Wars|Ottoman wars in Europe}}
[[File:Oton Ivekovic, Nikola Subic Zrinski.jpg|thumb|upright|Ban [[Nikola Šubić Zrinski]], a Croatian leader in the wars against [[Battle of Szigetvár|Ottomans]].]]

Shortly after the [[Battle of Mohács]], the [[Habsburg]]s unsuccessfully sought to stabilise the borders between the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Croatia by creating a captaincy in [[Bihać]]. However, in 1529, the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] swept through the area and captured [[Buda]] and [[Siege of Vienna|besieged Vienna]]; an event which brought violence and turmoil to the Croatian border areas (see [[Ottoman wars in Europe]]). After the failure of the first military operations, the Kingdom of Croatia was split into civilian and military units in 1553. The latter became [[Croatian Krajina]] and [[Slavonian Krajina]] and both eventually became parts of the [[Croatian Military Frontier]] which was directly under the control of Vienna.

Ottoman raids on Croatian territory continued until the [[Battle of Sisak]] in 1593, after which the borders stabilised for some time. The kingdom of that time became known as the ''Reliquiae reliquiarum olim inclyti Regni Croatiae'' (&quot;The remains of the once famous Kingdom of Croatia&quot;). An important battle during this time was the [[Battle of Szigetvár]] (1566), when 2,300 soldiers under the leadership of [[ban (title)|ban]] [[Nikola Šubić Zrinski]] held back for two months 100,000 Ottoman soldiers led by [[Sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], fighting to the last man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Shelton | first=Edward | title=The book of battles: or, Daring deeds by land and sea | publisher=Houlston and Wright | location=London | pages=82–83 | year=1867 | isbn= | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=S7oBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cardinal Richelieu]] was reported to have called the event &quot;the battle that saved civilization.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rarenewspapers.com/view/548456 |title=Timothy Hughes Rare &amp; Early Newspapers, Item 548456 |publisher=Rarenewspapers.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Turkish War]] (1667–1698), [[Slavonia]] was regained but hilly western Bosnia, which had been a part of Croatia until the Ottoman conquest, remained outside Croatian control and the current border, which resembles a crescent or a horseshoe, is a remnant of this historical outcome. [[Dalmatia|The southern part]] of the 'horseshoe' was created by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] conquest following the [[Siege of Zara]] and was defined by the 17–18th century wars with the Ottomans. The ''de jure'' reason for Venetian expansion was the decision of the king of Croatia, [[Ladislas of Naples]], to sell his rights on [[Dalmatia]] to Venice in 1409.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ivan Stagličić |url=http://www.zadarskilist.hr/clanci/07072008/kako-je-i-zasto-ladislav-prodao-dalmaciju |title=Zadarski list – Naslovnica |publisher=Zadarskilist.hr |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During more than two centuries of Ottoman wars, Croatia underwent great demographic changes. The Croats left the riverland areas of [[Lika|Gacka]], [[Lika]] and [[Krbava]], [[Moslavina]] in [[Slavonia]], and an area in present day north-western [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] to move towards Austria where they remained and the present day [[Burgenland Croats]] are direct descendants of these settlers. To replace the fleeing Croats, the Habsburgs called on the Orthodox populations of Bosnia and Serbia to provide military service in Croatian and Slavonian Krajina. Serbian migration into this region, which had started in the 16th century, peaked during the [[Great Serb Migrations]] of 1690 and 1737–39. The rights and obligations of new populace of the Military frontier were decided with the Statuta Valachorum in 1630.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Nouzille: Histoire de frontieres: L'Autriche et l'Empire Ottoman, page 263&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ivan Zasche, Portret bana Josipa Jelacica.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Josip Jelačić]], ban of Croatia during [[Hungarian revolution of 1848|Revolution of 1848]].]]

On January 1, 1527, Croatian noblemen gathered in the [[Cetin]] fortress in the city of [[Cetingrad]] for the [[Parliament on Cetin]] and elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria]] as the new king of the Croatian kingdom. Croatia of that time was named a triune kingdom: the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], and the [[Kingdom of Slavonia]]. The kingdoms of Croatia and Slavonia united in 1868, creating the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]].
[[File:Dragutin Weingärtner, Hrvatski sabor 1848. god.jpg|thumb|left|Meeting of the Croatian Parliament, 1848 (Dragutin Weingärtner)]]

The Croatian answer to the [[Hungarian revolution of 1848]] was a declaration of war. Austrian, Croatian and Russian forces together defeated the Hungarian army in 1849 and the following 17&amp;nbsp;years were remembered in Croatia and Hungary for the policy of [[Germanization]]. The eventual failure of this policy resulted in the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] and the creation of a [[personal union|monarchic union]] between the crowns of the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The treaty left unanswered the question of the status of Croatia. The following year the Croatian and Hungarian parliaments created a constitution for union of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~habsweb/sourcetexts/nagodba1.htm |title=Constitution of Union between Croatia-Slavonia and Hungary |publisher=H-net.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Ottoman Empire lost military control over [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], Austria-Hungary abolished [[Croatian Krajina]] and [[Slavonian Krajina]], restoring the territories to Croatia in 1881. During the second half of the 19th century pro-Hungarian and pro-Austrian political parties played Croats against Serbs with the aim of controlling the parliament. This policy failed in 1906 when a Croat-Serb coalition won the elections. The newly created political situation remained unchanged until the advent of [[World War I]].

===National Revival===
{{Main|Illyrian movement}}
[[File:BishopMaksimilijan Vrhovac.JPEG|thumb|upright|[[Maksimilijan Vrhovac]], bishop of Zagreb]]

National revival in Croatia started in 1813 when the bishop of Zagreb [[Maksimilijan Vrhovac]] issued a plea for the collection of &quot;national treasures&quot;. At the beginning of the 1830s, a group of young Croatian writers gathered in [[Zagreb]] and established the [[Illyrian movement]] for national renewal and unity of all South Slavs within the Habsburg Monarchy. The most important focus of the Illyrians was the establishment of a standard language as a counter-weight to [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and the promotion of Croatian literature and official culture.

Important members of this movement were Count [[Janko Drašković]], who initiated the movement by writing a pamphlet in 1832, [[Ljudevit Gaj]] who received permission from the royal government of Habsburg for printing the first newspaper in the Croatian language, [[Antun Mihanović]], who wrote the lyrics for the [[Lijepa naša domovino|Croatian national anthem]], [[Vatroslav Lisinski]], composer of the first Croatian language opera, &quot;Ljubav i zloba&quot; (&quot;Love and Malice&quot;, 1846), and many others.

Fearful first of Hungarian and then [[Habsburg]] ([[Austria]]n) pressure of assimilation, the Kingdom of Croatia had always refused to change the status of Latin as its official language until the middle of the 19th century. Only on 2 May 1843 the Croatian language was first spoken in parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=1757 |title=Govor Ivana Kukuljevića Sakcinskog u Saboru 2 svibnja 1843 |publisher=Sabor.hr |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; finally gaining official status in 1847 due to the popularity of the [[Illyrian]] movement.

Even with a large Slavic (Croatian) majority, [[Dalmatia]] retained large Italian communities in the coast (in the cities and the islands, largest concentration in [[Istria]]). According to the 1816 Austro-Hungarian census, 22% of the Dalmatian population was Italian-speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Montani, Carlo. ''Venezia Giulia, Dalmazia – Sommario Storico – An Historical Outline''&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 19th century, most [[Dalmatian Italians]] and [[Morlachs]] with an [[Istro-Romanian language]] gradually assimilated to the prevailing Croatian culture and language.

===Kingdom of Yugoslavia===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2010-0420-502, Stefan Radic, cropped.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Stjepan Radić]], Croatian political leader,  opposer of the union with Serbs, killed in 1928 by [[Puniša Račić]].]]

After the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I, issues of Yugoslav unity became a major international issue.

On 29 October 1918, the Croatian ''[[Sabor]]'' (parliament) declared independence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=404 |title=Povijest saborovanja |publisher=Sabor.hr |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating the new [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]. Pressured by the Italian army, which was entering its territory from south and west, the National Council (Narodno vijeće) started expedient negotiations with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and on November 23, 1918, a delegation was sent to Belgrade with the aim of a proclamation of union. The National Council delegation delivered 11 points which needed to be fulfilled for the creation of a future state.&lt;ref&gt;Naputak Narodnog vijeća SHS delegaciji za pregovore i utanačenje ujedinjenja države SHS s Kraljevinom Srbijom&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important of these points was the first, which referred to the need of a constitution for the new state, a proposal that was passed with a two thirds majority. Eventually, a constitution for a centralized state was passed with a majority of 50% + 1 vote and caused the end of state autonomy. On 1 December 1918, the new [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]], colloquially known as Kingdom of Yugoslavia, was created. This decision created public outcry among Croats, which started a political upheaval for the restoration of state autonomy by the leadership of the [[Croatian Peasant Party]].

[[File:Vladko macek.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vladko Maček]], leader after Radić, opponent of the Serbian hegemony of [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]].]]

Dalmatian Croat politician [[Ante Trumbić]], a prominent [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslavist]] leader and head of the [[Yugoslav Committee]] during the war had vouched for the creation of a united Yugoslavia and represented Yugoslavia at the [[Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spencer Tucker 2005&quot;&gt;Spencer Tucker. ''Encyclopedia of World War I: A Political, Social, and Military History''. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2005. Pp. 1189.&lt;/ref&gt; Trumbić successfully vouched for the inclusion of most Yugoslavs of the former Austria-Hungary to be included within the borders of Yugoslavia but failed to secure the inclusion of 500,000 Slovenes and Croats who were placed under Italian rule with the [[Treaty of Rapallo]] of 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spencer Tucker 2005&quot;/&gt;

The formation of the constitution of 1921 sparked tensions between the different Yugoslav nationalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spencer Tucker 2005&quot;/&gt; Trumbić opposed the 1921 constitution and over time grew increasingly hostile towards the Yugoslav government that he saw as being centralized in the favour of Serb hegemony over Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spencer Tucker 2005&quot;/&gt;

The unhealthy political situation in Yugoslavia became much worse after [[Stjepan Radić]], the president of CPP, was killed in the Yugoslav parliament building in 1928 by Montenegrin Serb ultranationalist [[Puniša Račić]].

The ensuing chaotic period ended the next year when [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] abolished the Constitution, prorogued the Parliament and introduced a personal [[dictatorship]]. The next four years of the Yugoslav regime were described by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1931 as a &quot;horrible brutality which is being practised upon the Croatian People&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT04.06.31&quot;&gt;''[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F0091EFB345C157A93C4A9178ED85F458385F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=sufflay%20einstein&amp;st=cse Einstein accuses Yugoslavian rulers in savant's murder]'', [[New York Times]]. May 6, 1931.  [http://crostamps.com/nyt/nyt.htm mirror]&lt;/ref&gt; During the dictatorship, [[Vladko Maček]], leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, was imprisoned, only becoming free after king Alexander was killed in a plot organized by the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] and [[Ustase|Ustaše]].

Upon Maček's release, the political situation was restored to that before the murder of Stjepan Radić, continuing Croatian demands for autonomy. The Croatian question was solved only on August 26, 1939 by the [[Cvetković-Maček Agreement]], when Croatia received autonomy and an extension of its borders and Maček became Yugoslav vice-prime minister. The ensuing peace was terminated by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] invasion of 1941.

===World War II===
{{Main|Yugoslav Front (World War II)}}

The [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|German and Italian invasion]] of April 6, 1941 achieved victory over the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] in little more than ten days, ending with the unconditional surrender of the Royal Yugoslav Army on April 17. The territory of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region of [[Syrmia]] became a [[puppet state]] of Nazi Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-1413183/Independent-State-of-Croatia |title=Independent State of Croatia – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005456 Yugoslavia], ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', United States Holocaust Memorial Museum&lt;/ref&gt; called the [[Independent State of Croatia]]. Part of Dalmatia was occupied by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. [[Baranja]] and [[Međimurje]] were occupied by [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. The regime in the Independent State of Croatia was led by ''[[Ustaše]]'' and it's leader ''[[Poglavnik]]'' [[Ante Pavelić]].

Only one day after entering Zagreb, on April 17, 1941, Ante Pavelić proclaimed that all people who offended, or tried to offend against the Croatian nation were guilty of treason — a crime punishable by death.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crohis.com/izvori/ustzk.pdf |title=Independent State of Croatia laws on Croatian|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ustashe regime introduced anti-Semitic Nuremberg-style{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} laws, and also conducted [[The Holocaust#Slavs|massacres of mostly Serbs and other non-Croats]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/620426/Ustasa |title=Ustaša – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as running concentration camps such as the one at [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]] and Stara Gradiska where opponents of the Ustashe regime and other 'undesirables' were held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005449 Jasenovac], ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', United States Holocaust Memorial Museum&lt;/ref&gt; The Ustase murdered Serbs, Jews, Roma, as well as Croats who opposed Ustase rule.&lt;ref&gt;John R.

Pp. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JosipBrozTito.png|125px|thumb|upright|[[Josip Broz Tito]] was the leader of the Yugoslav communist resistance (photo from 1971).]]

Pavelić's Ustase regime was highly unpopular in Croatia at the time and lacked popular support due to Pavelić's secession of the largely Croat-populated region of Dalmatia to Fascist Italy and secession of territory to Hungary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernd Jürgen Fischer 2007.

Pp. 214&quot;/&gt;

Catholic priests who were involved in the Ustashe movement, particularly the notorious Father [[Miroslav Filipović]] were defrocked. However, others such as the Archbishop of Zagreb [[Alojzije Stepinac]] not only condemned Ustashe crimes in his sermons but also offered refuge and protection to persecuted Serbs and Jews. The Jewish Virtual Library estimates that between {{Formatnum:45000}} and {{Formatnum:52000}} [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]] were killed at Jasenovac and that between {{Formatnum:330,000}} and {{Formatnum:390,000}} Serbs were victims of the entire genocide campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Jasenovac.html Jasenovac] Jewish Virtual Library. Accessed 2008-08-10. &quot;The most reliable figures place the number of Serbs killed by the Ustaša between 330,000 and 390,000, with 45,000 to 52,000 Serbs murdered in Jasenovac.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The remnants of the Royal Yugoslav Army, later reorganized into the predominantly Serbian Chetniks, offered resistance to the Nazi occupation and their Ustashe collaborators, but the Yugoslav Royalist Chetniks soon started collaborating with Nazis and Fascist Italy. [[Civil war]] broke out. Later, in response to Hitler's surprise &quot;Operation Barbarossa&quot; attack on the Soviet Union, a massive uprising began on June 22, 1941 with the creation of [[First Sisak Partisan Detachment|1st Sisak Partisan Detachment]].

The leadership of the Yugoslav partisan movement was in the hands of Croat [[Josip Broz Tito]], whose policy of [[brotherhood and unity]] would in the end defeat not only the Axis occupiers, but also their various collaborators in the armed forces of the Independent State of Croatia and other quislings (which could be found in every Yugoslav social and national group). The victory of Tito's partisans against the Nazi occupiers and their allies resulted in the [[Bleiburg massacre|massacres]] of those Croatian Domobran (Home Guard) and Ustashe who were repatriated from Austria by the British 8th Army. During the war and in the decade after World War II, numerous Italian civilians were massacred by Tito's partisans, while up to 350,000 ethnic [[Italians]] were obliged to leave Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/06/world/election-opens-old-wounds-in-trieste.html Election Opens Old Wounds In Trieste]. The New York Times. June 6, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of [[World War II casualties|World War II victims]] in Yugoslavia remains a source of much controversy amongst Serb and Croat nationalist academics and historians on the one side, and independent researchers, mostly notably [[Vladimir Žerjavić]] (a Croat) and [[Bogoljub Kočović]] (a Serb), on the other.&lt;ref&gt;A recent study by Vladimir Žerjavić estimates total war related deaths at 1,027,000. Bogoljub Kočović calculated that the actual war losses were 1,014,000.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Savka Dabcevic Kucar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Savka Dabčević-Kučar]], [[Croatian Spring]] participant; Europe's first female prime minister]]

Modern Croatia was founded on [[AVNOJ]] anti-fascist partisans' principles during [[Allies of World War II|World War II]], and it became a constitutional federal republic of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=1839 |title=Croatian constitution |publisher=Sabor.hr |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[single-party]] [[socialist state]] was established but, because of the [[Tito-Stalin split]], economic and personal freedom were better than in the [[Eastern Bloc]]. From the 1950s, the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]] enjoyed an autonomy under the rule of the local Communist elite, but in 1967 a group of influential Croatian poets and linguists published a [[Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Standard Language]].

After 1968 the patriotic goals of that document morphed into a generic Croatian movement for more rights for Croatia, greater civil rights and demands for the decentralization of the economy. In the end the Yugoslav leadership interpreted the [[Croatian Spring]] as a restoration of Croatian [[nationalism]], dismissed the movement as [[chauvinism|chauvinistic]] and arrested most of its important leaders. In 1974, a new Yugoslav federal constitution was ratified that gave more autonomy to the individual republics, thereby basically fulfilling the main goals of the Croatian Spring.

Under the influence of [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s propaganda, the importance of who won the first Croatian multi-party elections in 50 years was diminished. Allegedly, Serbs had influenced both Croatian nationalist leader [[Franjo Tuđman]] and communist leader [[Ivica Račan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hercegbosna.org/ostalo/raspad.html Dusan Bilandzic: Hrvatska moderna povijest]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electoral win of Franjo Tuđman further inflamed the situation.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Croatia}}
{{See also|Protected areas of Croatia}}
[[File:Croatia topo.jpg|thumb|290px|left|Topographic map]]

Croatia is located in South-eastern Europe between [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Slovenia]], and bordering the [[Adriatic Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=The World Factbook - Croatia |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/hr.html |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;official&quot; /&gt; It lies between latitudes [[42nd parallel north|42°]] and [[47th parallel north|47° N]], and longitudes [[13th meridian east|13°]] and [[20th meridian east|20° E]].

Its shape resembles that of a crescent or a horseshoe, which flanks its neighbours [[Serbia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Montenegro]]. To the north lie [[Slovenia]] and [[Hungary]]; Italy lies across the Adriatic Sea. Its mainland territory is split in two non-contiguous parts by the short coastline of Bosnia and Herzegovina around [[Neum]].

Its terrain is diverse, including:

* plains, lakes and rolling hills in the continental north and north-east (Central Croatia and [[Slavonia]], part of the [[Pannonian Basin]]);
* densely wooded mountains in [[Lika]] and [[Gorski Kotar]], part of the [[Dinaric Alps]];
* rocky coastlines on the [[Adriatic Sea]] ([[Istria]], Northern Sea coast and [[Dalmatia]]).

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Croatia belongs to the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is shared between the Central European and Illyrian provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] and the Adriatic province of the [[Mediterranean Region]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Croatia can be subdivided into three [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Pannonian mixed forests]], [[Dinaric Mountains mixed forests]] and [[Illyrian deciduous forests]].

The country is famous for its many [[List of national parks of Croatia|national parks]]. Besides national parks, Croatian laws provide special protection to ten more [[nature parks]] and two strict [[Nature reserve|natural reserves]]. [[Protected areas of Croatia|Around ten percent of total territory of Croatia]] enjoys special protection by law in the aforementioned forms.
Croatia has a mixture of [[climate]]s. In the north and east it is [[continental climate|continental]], [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] along the coast and a semi-highland and [[highland climate]] in the south-central region. Istra has a [[temperate]] climate, while the [[Palagruža]] archipelago is home to a [[subtropical]] climate.

Insular Croatia consists of over one thousand islands varying in size. The largest islands in Croatia are [[Cres]] and [[Krk]] which are located in the Adriatic Sea. The [[Danube]], Europe's second longest river, runs through the city of [[Vukovar]]. [[Dinara]], the eponym of the [[Dinaric Alps]], is the highest peak of Croatia at {{convert|1831|m|0|lk=on|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/151472/dinara.html|title=Dinara – Climbing, Hiking &amp; Mountaineering|publisher=SummitPost|accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karst topography]] makes up more than 50% of Croatia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/434986.2009_Mallorca_Bilandzija_et_al.pdf |title=BIB.irb.hr |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is especially obvious in the area south of [[Karlovac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underground-istria.org/en/project/what-is-karst/ |title=What is karst? |publisher=Underground Istria |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 49 [[cave]]s deeper than {{convert|250|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} in Croatia, 14 of them are deeper than {{convert|500|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} and three deeper than {{convert|1000|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} (the Lukina jama-Trojama, Slovacka jama and Velebita cave systems).

Important characteristic of Croatian landscape are numerous natural [[List of lakes in Croatia|lakes]]. The biggest one, [[Vransko lake]] stretches over 30&amp;nbsp;km² in [[Zadar county|Zadar]] and [[Šibenik-Knin County|Šibenik-Knin county]]. Interesting phenomena is [[Lake Vrana]], a crypto-depression lake located on the [[Cres]] island, containing [[fresh water]] used to supply housholds on the island with water. [[Peruća Lake|Lake Peruča]] is the biggest artificial lake used for [[Energy]] generation in [[Split-Dalmatia county|Dalmatia]]. The most famous are the [[Plitvice Lakes National Park|Plitvice lakes]], a system of 16 lakes and [[waterfall]]s connecting them over the [[dolomite]] and [[limestone]] cascades. The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colours, ranging from azure to green, grey or blue. The colours change constantly depending on the quantity of minerals or organisms in the water and the angle of sunlight.

[[File:Vlada RH.jpg|thumb|[[Banski dvori]], a two-story baroque building which was the residence of Croatian [[ban (title)|bans]] from 1809 until 1918 and is now the seat of government.]]

Croatia is a democratic parliamentary republic. With the collapse of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|ruling communist party]] in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], Croatia adopted its present constitution in 1990 and organised its first [[Multi-party system|multi-party election]]s. It [[Declaration of independence|declared independence]] on 8 October 1991 leading to the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and the country was internationally recognised by the [[United Nations]] in 1992. Under its 1990 constitution, Croatia operated a [[semi-presidential system]] until 2000 when it switched to a [[parliamentary system]]. The main institutions of government in Croatia are the President, Parliament and Government.

The [[List of Presidents of Croatia|President of the Republic]] (''Predsjednik'') is the [[head of state]], directly elected to a five-year term and is limited by the Constitution to a maximum of two terms. In addition to being the [[commander in chief]] of the armed forces, the president has the procedural duty of appointing the Prime minister with the consent of the Parliament, and has some influence on foreign policy.

The [[Government of Croatia]] (''Vlada'') is headed by the [[Prime Minister of Croatia|Prime minister]] who has two deputy prime ministers and 14 ministers in charge of particular sectors of activity. The [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] is responsible for proposing legislation and a budget, executing the laws, and guiding the foreign and internal policies of the republic. [[Government]]'s [[official residence]] is at [[Banski dvori]].

The [[Parliament of Croatia]] (''Sabor'') is a [[unicameral]] legislative body (a second chamber, the &quot;House of Counties&quot;, which was set up by the Constitution of 1990, was abolished in 2001). The number of the Sabor's members can vary from 100 to 160; they are all elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The plenary sessions of the Sabor take place from January 15 to July 15, and from September 15 to December 15. The two largest political parties in Croatia are the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]].

[[Privatization]] and the drive toward a [[market economy]] had barely begun under the new Croatian Government when war broke out in 1991.

According to [[Eurostat]] data, Croatian PPS GDP per capita stood at 63.2 percent of the EU average in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-25062009-BP/EN/2-25062009-BP-EN.PDF|title=GDP per capita in PPS|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real GDP growth in 2007 was 6.0 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=1996,39140985&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&amp;screen=detailref&amp;language=en&amp;product=STRIND_ECOBAC&amp;root=STRIND_ECOBAC/ecobac/eb012|title=Real GDP growth rate|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the same time average gross salary of a Croatian worker during the first nine months of 2008 was 7,161 kuna ([[US$]] 1,530) per month&lt;ref name=salary7161&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suvremena.hr/9044.aspx|title=Plaće nominalno veće, ali realno u padu|accessdate=2008-11-21|date=2008-11-06|work=Suvremena.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[International Labour Organization]]-defined [[unemployment]] rate stood at 9.1 per cent, after falling steadily from 14.7 percent in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=1996,39140985&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&amp;screen=detailref&amp;language=en&amp;product=STRIND_EMPLOI&amp;root=STRIND_EMPLOI/emploi/em071|title=Unemployment rate – total|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The registered unemployment rate is higher, though, standing at 13.7 percent in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hnb.hr/publikac/bilten/arhiv/bilten-134/ebilt134.pdf?tsfsg=b65a34caa3a314c04e2cba8c626caa79|title=Bulletin 134|publisher=Croatian National Bank|date=February 2008|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, economic output was dominated by the service sector which accounted for 73,6% percent of GDP, followed by the [[industrial sector]] with 20,5% and [[agriculture]] accounting for 5,9% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hgk.hr/en/pdf/croatia_bussines_partner_2009.pdf|title=Croatian Chamber of Economy Brochure for year 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The industrial sector is dominated by shipbuilding, food processing, pharmaceuticals, information technology, biochemical and timber industry. [[Tourism]] is a notable source of income during the summers, with over 11&amp;nbsp;million foreign tourists in 2008 generating a revenue of €8&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=UNWTO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwto.org/facts/eng/pdf/barometer/UNWTO_Barom07_3_en.pdf|title=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer|date=October 2007|accessdate=2008-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croatia is ranked as the 18th most popular tourist destination in the world.&lt;ref name=UNWTO/&gt; In 2008 Croatia exported goods to the value of $14.4&amp;nbsp;billion ([[Free On Board|FOB]]) ($26.4&amp;nbsp;billion including service exports).&lt;ref name=UNWTO/&gt;

The Croatian state still controls a significant part of the economy, with government expenditure accounting for as much as 40% of GDP.&lt;ref name=DOS/&gt; Some large, state-owned industries, such as the country's shipyards, continue to rely on government subsidies but with EU membership looming, Croatia is forced to restructure debt ridden shipyards as it is a prerequisites for Croatia before it joins the EU.

Of particular concern is the backlogged [[judiciary]] system, combined with inefficient [[public administration]], especially issues of land ownership and corruption. Another main problem includes the large and growing national debt which has reached over 34&amp;nbsp;billion euro or 89.1 per cent of the nations gross domestic product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/business/news/article_1411971.php/ANALYSIS_Despite_debt_Croatia_&amp;quotnot_under_financial_collapse_threat%22 |title=Analysis: Despite debt, Croatia &quot;not under financial collapse threat&quot; |publisher=Monstersandcritics.com |date=2008-06-18 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these problems, studies show that the population of Croatia generally has negative expectations of the country's economic future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkan-monitor.eu/files/BalkanMonitor-2008_Summary_of_Findings.pdf |title=Gallup Balkan monitor:2008 Summary of findings |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croatia has so far weathered the global financial crisis reasonably well, but faces significant challenges in 2010 largely due to Croatia's external imbalances and high [[External debt|foreign debt]], which in longer term presents problems for Croatian financial sector due to higher cost of borrowing to cover current account deficit.&lt;ref name=DOS/&gt;

The country has been preparing for membership in the [[European Union]], its most important [[international trade|trading partner]]. In February 2005, the [[Stabilisation and Association Process|Stabilisation and Association Agreement]] with the [[European Union|EU]] officially came into force and by the end of 2009 Croatia has closed 17 EU accessions chapters, with remaining 16 to be completed by the end of first half of 2010.

The highlight of Croatia's recent [[infrastructure]] developments is its rapidly growing [[Motorways in Croatia|motorway network]], of which plans were drawn and work commenced in the 1970s, but was realised only after independence because of the (then) [[SFRY|Yugoslav Government]] plans of road projects of 'national' importance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Autocesta-Kralja-Tomislava&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.matica.hr/HRRevija/revija2004_4_n.nsf/AllWebDocs/Milicic | title= Autocesta Split - Zagreb | trans_title=Autocesta Split - Zagreb | year=2004 | work=Hrvatska revija | author=Jakša Miličić | publisher=[[Matica hrvatska]] | language=Croatian | accessdate=May 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vjesnik-Haramija&quot;&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = Vjesnik | language = Croatian | url = http://www.vjesnik.hr/Pdf/2004%5C06%5C27%5C09A9.PDF | title = Naša ideja je bila izgraditi ono što samo zvali 'hrvatski križ' | trans_title= Our idea was to build what we called 'Croatian cross' | author= Tihomir Ponoš | format= PDF | date = June 27, 2004 | accessdate= October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, at the Third Ministerial Session of the [[International Transport Forum|European Conference of Ministers of Transport]], routes of four [[Pan-European corridors]] were defined running through Croatia, giving extra importance to Croatian road network.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helsinki-1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | publisher = [[University of Rijeka|University of Rijeka, Faculty of Maritime Studies]] | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/6570 | title= The integration of the Republic of Croatia into the Pan-European transport corridor network | author= Tanja Poletan Jugović | journal= Pomorstvo | volume= 20 | issue= 1 | pages= 49–65 | date = April 11, 2006 | accessdate= October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croatia has an extensive rail network, although due to historical circumstances, some regions (notably [[Istria]] and even more so [[Dubrovnik]]) are not accessible by train without passing through neighboring countries. Serious investment is needed in the rail network over the coming decades to bring it up to European standards in both speed and operational efficiency. All rail services are operated by [[Croatian Railways]] ({{lang-hr|Hrvatske željeznice}}). The inter-city bus network (operated by private operators) is extensively developed, with higher levels of coverage and timetables than the railways.

Croatia has three major international airports, located in [[Zagreb Airport|Zagreb]], [[Split Airport|Split]] and [[Dubrovnik Airport|Dubrovnik]]. Other important airports include [[Zadar Airport|Zadar]], [[Rijeka Airport|Rijeka]] (on the island of [[Krk]]), [[Osijek Airport|Osijek]], [[Bol Airport|Bol]], [[Lošinj Airport|Lošinj]] and [[Pula Airport|Pula]]. [[Croatia Airlines]] is the national airline and [[flag carrier]]. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of Croatia’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Croatia’s air carrier operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1095.html |title=U.S. Department of State |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extensive system of ferries, operated by [[Jadrolinija]], serves Croatia's many islands and links coastal cities. Ferry services to Italian cities of [[Venice]], [[Ancona]], [[Pescara]] and [[Bari]] from around a dozen of Croatian sea ports, most notably [[Rovinj]], [[Rijeka]], [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Korčula]] and [[Dubrovnik]], is available on a daily or weekly basis. From April to September the schedule is more dense and can include several round trips within a day.{{-}}

Croatia's 2001 census recorded a total population of 4,437,460.&lt;ref name=&quot;frucht415&quot;/&gt; This is estimated to have risen to 4,489,409 by 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt;

During the last decade of the 20th century the population of Croatia has been stagnating because of the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. During the war, large sections of the population were displaced and emigration increased. In 1991, in predominantly Serb areas, more than 400 000 Croats and other non-Serbs were either removed out of their homes by the Croatian Serb forces or fled the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2007/pr1162e-summary.htm|title=Summary of judgement for Milan Martić|date=2007-06-12|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2008-06-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071215084458/http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2007/pr1162e-summary.htm |archivedate = December 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the final days of the war in 1995, more than 120,000 Serbs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00EFD7113AF935A25752C0A9669C8B63 |title=For Serbs in Croatia, a Pledge Unkept |publisher=nytimes.com |accessdate=2000-01-16 | first=Steven | last=Erlanger | date=2000-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps as many as 200,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prodger |first=Matt |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4747379.stm |title=Bbc News |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-08-05 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; fled before the victory by Croatian forces.

Serbs have been only partially re-settled by the Croatian Government in the regions they previously inhabited (i.e., the blue areas of the map here). Many of the towns previously settled by Serbs were settled by Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, mostly from [[Republika Srpska]].

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Croatia}}
[[File:University of Zagreb.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Zagreb]]]]

Primary education in Croatia starts at the age of six or seven and consists of eight grades. In 2007 a law was passed to increase free but not compulsory education until 18 years of age. Compulsory education consists of eight grades (Elementary School)
Secondary education is provided by [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] and [[vocational school]]s.

[[File:NSK Zagreb.jpg|thumb|left|[[National and University Library in Zagreb|University Library in Zagreb]]]]

Croatia has eight universities, the [[University of Zagreb]], [[University of Split]], [[University of Rijeka]], [[University of Osijek]], [[University of Zadar]], [[University of Dubrovnik]] the [[University of Pula]] and [[Dubrovnik International University]].
The [[University of Zadar]], the first University in Croatia, was founded in 1396 and remained active until 1807, when other institutions of higher education took over until the foundation of the renewed University of Zadar in 2002. The University of Zagreb, founded in 1669, is the oldest continuously operating University in [[Southeastern Europe]]. There are also 11 [[institute of technology|polytechnics]] and 23 [[higher education]] institutions of which 19 are private.

There are numerous public [[music school]]s on the primary and secondary education levels. Over thirty scientific [[institute]]s are registered in Croatia, the largest one being the [[Ruđer Bošković Institute|Institute &quot;Ruđer Bošković&quot;]] in Zagreb that excels in physics. The [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in Zagreb is a [[learned society]] promoting language, culture, arts and science from its first conception in 1836.

According to a survey ordered by the [[European commission]] in 2005, 49% of [[Croats]] speak [[english language|English]], 34% speak [[german language|German]], 14% [[italian language|Italian]], 4% [[French language|French]] and [[russian language|Russian]] and 2% [[spanish language|Spanish]] [[language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf|title=Europeans and their languages – European commission special barometer FEB2006|accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croatian culture is the result of a [[Culture of Croatia|fourteen century-long history]] which has seen the development of many cities and monuments and also includes many adoptions from ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Illyria]]n cultures. The culture of Croatia can be divided into two cultural circles: Central European and Mediterranean. The country includes [[Culture of Croatia#Places|seven World Heritage sites and eight national parks]]. Croatia is also the birthplace of a number of [[Culture of Croatia#People|historical figures]]. Included among the [[List of Croatians|notable people]] are three [[Nobel prize]] winners and numerous inventors. The country is also rich with [[Intangible culture]] and holds the largest number of [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity|UNESCO's World's intangible culture masterpieces]] in [[Europe]].

Regional cultures are considered variations on the larger category of &quot;Croatian&quot;, including the cultures of [[Dalmatia]], [[Istria]], [[Slavonia]], and [[Hrvatsko Zagorje|Zagorje]]. These regions are characterized by differences in geography, traditional economy, food, folkloric tradition, and dialect. Despite that, Croats share an overall sense of national culture but at the same time often feel strong about regional identities and about local cultural variations. Cultural variations, particularly regional cuisine, are related to geographic variations within the country. Traditional economies are also linked to geography. The capital, [[Zagreb]], is centrally located but was not chosen for that reason. It is the largest city, but also historically the political, commercial, and intellectual center.

Some of the world's first [[fountain pen]]s came from Croatia. Croatia also has a place in the history of clothing as the origin of the [[necktie]] (''kravata''). The country has a long [[Art of Croatia#Arts and literature|artistic, literary]] and [[Music of Croatia|musical tradition]]. Also of interest is the diverse nature of [[Croatian cuisine]] and the famous Croatian Traditional gift [[Licitar]].

Croatians are protective of the their [[Croatian language]] from foreign influences as the language was under constant change and threats imposed by previous rulers (i.e. Austrian German, Hungarian, Italian and Turkish words were changed and altered to &quot;Slavic&quot; looking/sounding ones).

The Croatian language has three major dialects, identified by three different words for &quot;what&quot; [[Chakavian dialect|ća]], [[Kajkavian dialect|kaj]] and [[Shtokavian dialect|što]]. From 1961 to 1991, the official language was Serbo-Croatian. Even under [[socialism]], Croats often referred to their language as Croato-Serbian (instead of Serbo-Croatian) or as Croatian. Croatian and Serbian variants of the language were never recognized as different, but referred as the west and east version, and had different alphabets; [[Latin alphabet]] and Serbian [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]].

In the late 19th and 20th century, Serbian and Yugoslav nationalist scholars began to impose policies to change or alter Croatian words into &quot;Serbian&quot; or &quot;South Slavic&quot; ones, which have infuriated Croats over the purity and preservation of their native language (See [[Croatian linguistic purism]]). Under the Habsburgs, [[Latin language|Latin]] was the official language of the Croatian government and [[Sabor]]. At the same time, besides Croatian, many Croats used German and Italian in everyday life. A [[Illyrian movement|national reawakening]] in the 19th century focused on the establishment of a national language as the official one.

During socialist Yugoslavia, a Yugoslav identity was promoted and symbols and expressions of national identity were suppressed and punishable by jail terms. The [[Croatian Spring]], the most notable and only large-scale nationalist movement during Tito's regime, was put down in 1971 with most of its leadership imprisoned. It was led by important Croatian communists and was based on economic disagreement with the Serb elite in Belgrade.

[[File:Suit tie.JPG|thumb|left|[[Cravat]] or [[Necktie]] is a symbol of Croatian culture.]]

The newly independent state has had to recreate a national culture by drawing from history and folk culture. The modern national identity draws on its [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|medieval roots]], association with Viennese &quot;high culture,&quot; culturally diverse rural traditions, and Roman Catholicism.

A [[cravat]] (in modern [[English language|English]] renamed to [[Necktie]]), symbol of culture and elegance, originates from the 17th century Croatia where it was part of the uniform worn by Croatian soldiers. It was disseminated across Europe during [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) by Croatian regiments serving under Austria. From 1635 Croatian soldiers also served in France and in 1667 a special regiment named Royal Cravates was formed. Common soldiers wore scarves made of coarse materials and officers wore scarves made of fine cotton or silk. French King [[Louis XIV]] fell in love with the Croatian attire and soon replaced the starched high-lace collar the French used to wear with the cravat, much more practical and beautiful piece of clothing. When the most powerful European king put on the cravat, a new fashion was born. Later on, cravat was accepted in all corners of the world as a standard and still carries the Croatian name in its name in majority of modern languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academia-cravatica.hr/etimology/ |title=Academia Cravatica |publisher=Academia-cravatica.hr |date= |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Croatia}}
{{See also|World Heritage Sites in Croatia}}

Architecture in Croatia reflects the influence of the bordering nations. Austrian and Hungarian influences are visible in public space and buildings in the north and central regions. Large squares named for culture heroes, well-groomed parks, and pedestrian-only zones, are features of these orderly towns and cities. Muted colors prevail, especially tones of yellow and gold. In urban areas, houses are built right up to the street. An inner courtyard sometimes provides space for a small garden. Modern houses in cities and villages usually have two or three stories with [[masonry]] and [[stucco]].

Along the coast, the architecture is Mediterranean. Houses are usually made of stucco and painted white, and have red tile roofs. Cities and towns still have the characteristic open markets, squares, and Catholic churches, but are less likely to be laid out in a neat grid. Generally speaking, continental architecture is of [[baroque architecture]] gauge and coastal areas are examples of [[renaissance architecture]].

{{History of Croatia}}
[[Croatia]] first appeared as a [[duchy]] in the 7th century and then as a [[Monarchy|kingdom]] in the 10th century. From the 12th century it remained a distinct state with its ruler (''[[ban (title)|ban]]'') and [[Croatian Parliament|parliament]], but it obeyed the kings and emperors of various neighboring powers, primarily [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Habsburg|Austria]]. The period from the 15th to the 17th centuries was marked by bitter struggles with the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After being incorporated in [[Yugoslavia]] for most of the 20th century, Croatia regained independence in 1991.

== Croatian lands before the Croats (until 7th c.) ==
[[File:Oton Ivekovic, Dolazak Hrvata na Jadran.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oton Iveković]], ''The Croats arrival at the Adriatic Sea'']]
{{Main|Prehistoric Croatia}}

The area known as Croatia today has been inhabited throughout the prehistoric period, since the [[Stone Age]]. In the middle [[Paleolithic]], [[Neanderthals]] lived in Krapina and Vindija (northwest Croatia) and Mujina pećina (central Dalmatia).

In the early [[Neolithic]] period, the [[Starčevo-Körös|Starčevo]], [[Vučedol culture|Vučedol]] and [[Hvar culture|Hvar]] cultures were scattered around the region. The [[Iron Age]] left traces of the [[Hallstatt culture]] (early [[Illyrians]]) and the [[La Tène culture]] (Celts).

In recorded history, the area was inhabited by [[Liburnians]] and [[Illyria]]ns, and since the 4th century BC also colonized in the north by the [[Celts]] and along the coast by the [[Greek colonies|Greeks]], and later by the [[Roman colonies|Romans]]. The Southern [[Illyria#Illyrian kingdoms|Illyrian kingdom]], [[Illyris]], was a sovereign state in modern day Montenegro and [[Albania]] until the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] conquered it in 168 BC. The Western Empire organized the [[Roman province|provinces]] of [[Pannonia]] and Dalmatia, which after its downfall passed to the [[Huns]], the [[Ostrogoths]] and then to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Croats settled there in the early 7th century.

==Medieval Croatian states (until 925)==
{{main|Theories on the origin of Croats|White Croatia}}
{{main|Principality of Littoral Croatia|Principality of Pannonian Croatia|Pagania|Zachlumia}}
The Croats arrived in what is today Croatia in the 7th century. They organized into two [[dukedom (administrative division)|dukedom]]s: the duchy of [[Pannonian Croatia]] in the north and the duchy of [[Littoral Croatia]] in the south. The biggest part of [[Christianization]] of the Croats ended in the 9th century.

Croatian duke [[Trpimir I of Croatia|Trpimir I]] (845–864), founder of [[Trpimirović dynasty]], fought successfully against Bulgarians, and against the Byzantine ''[[strategos]]'' in [[Zadar]]. He expanded his state in the east to the [[Drina River]].
The first native Croatian ruler recognized by a [[pope]] was duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]],  whom [[Pope John VIII]] called ''dux Croatorum'' in 879.

==Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)==
{{main|Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)}}
[[File:Great Schism 1054 with former borders.png|thumb|left|200px| The [[Great Schism]] with former European borders in 1054]]
[[File:CoA of Croatia (Habsburg Monarchy).png|thumb|55px|right|Croatian Coat of Arms.]]
The first [[List of rulers of Croatia|King of Croatia]], [[Tomislav]] (910–928) of the Trpimirović dynasty, was crowned in 925. Tomislav, ''rex Croatorum'', united the Pannonian and Dalmatian duchies and created a sizeable state. He defeated Bulgarian Tsar [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]] in [[battle of the Bosnian Highlands]]. The [[medieval]] Croatian kingdom reached its peak during the reign of King [[Peter Krešimir IV of Croatia|Petar Krešimir IV]] (1058–1074) And [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Zvonimir]].

Following the disappearance of the major native dynasty by the end of the 11th century in the [[Battle of Gvozd Mountain]], the Croats eventually recognized the Hungarian ruler [[Coloman of Hungary|Coloman]] as the common king for Croatia and Hungary in a treaty of 1102 (often referred to as the ''[[Pacta conventa (Croatia)|Pacta conventa]]'').

==Personal union with Hungary (1102–1918)==
{{Main|Croatia in personal union with Hungary|Republic of Ragusa|Republic of Poljica}}
[[File:Oton Ivekovic, Smrt kralja Petra Svacica u Gori Gvozdu 1097 god.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Death of the Last Croatian King'', by [[Oton Iveković]]]]
The consequences of the change to the Hungarian king included the introduction of [[feudalism]] and the rise of the native noble families such as [[Frankopan]] and [[Šubić]].  The later kings sought to restore some of their previously lost influence by giving certain privileges to the towns.  The primary governor of Croatian provinces was the ''[[ban (title)|ban]]''.

The princes of Bribir from the Šubić family became particularly influential, asserting control over large parts of Dalmatia, [[Slavonia]] and Bosnia. Later, however, the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] intervened and restored royal power.

Separate coronation as King of Croatia was gradually allowed to fall into abeyance and last crowned king is Charles Robert in 1301 after which Croatia contented herself with a separate diploma
inaugurale. The reign of [[Louis the Great]] (1342–1382) is considered the golden age of Croatian medieval history.&lt;ref&gt;Zrinka Pešorda Vardić: The crown, the king and the town – the relation of Dubrovnik community toward the crown and the ruler in the beginning of movement against the Court (Croatian Institute of History)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigismund of Luxemburg]] also sold the whole of Dalmatia to [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] in 1409. In 1490 the estates of Croatia declined to recognize [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] until he had taken oath to respect their liberties, and insisted upon his erasing from the diploma certain phrases which seemed to reduce Croatia to the rank of a mere province. The dispute was solved in 1492 &lt;ref name=&quot;archive.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/southernslavques00seto/southernslavques00seto_djvu.txt R. W.

As the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] incursion into Europe started, Croatia once again became a border area.  The Croats fought an increasing number of battles and gradually lost increasing swaths of territory to the Ottoman Empire.

[[File:Ivan Zasche, Portret bana Josipa Jelacica.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Ban Josip Jelačić.]]
The 1526 [[Battle of Mohács]] and the death of King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] meant the end of Hungarian authority over Croatia. The Hungarian parliament elected János Szapolya as the new king of Hungary. Another Hungarian parliament elected Ferdinand Habsburg as King of Hungary. On the other side, the Croatian parliament, sitting at Cetin on January 1, 1527, unanimously elected Ferdinand Habsburg of Austria as King of Croatia.&lt;ref name=&quot;archive.org&quot;/&gt; A few years later both crown would be again united in Habsburgs hands and the union would be restored.   The Ottoman Empire further expanded in the 16th century to include most of Slavonia, western Bosnia and [[Lika]].

Later in the same century, Croatia was so weak that its parliament authorized Ferdinand Habsburg to carve out large areas of Croatia and Slavonia adjacent to the Ottoman Empire for the creation of the [[Military Frontier]] (''Vojna Krajina'', ''German'' Militaergrenze) which would be ruled directly from Vienna's military headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=SD_Vr3CTEooC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Habsburg+Monarchy,+1618-1815&amp;hl=hr#PPA15,M1 Charles W. Ingrao:The Habsburg monarchy, 1618–1815  page 15]&lt;/ref&gt; The area became rather deserted and was subsequently settled by [[Serbs]], [[Vlachs]], Croats and [[Ethnic German|Germans]] and others. As a result of their compulsory military service to the Habsburg Empire during conflict with the Ottoman Empire, the population in the Military Frontier was free of serfdom and enjoyed much political autonomy, unlike the population living in the parts ruled by Hungary.

After the [[Bihać]] fort finally fell in 1592, only small parts of Croatia remained unconquered. The Ottoman army was successfully repelled for the first time on the territory of Croatia following the [[battle of Sisak]] in 1593. The lost territory was mostly restored, except for large parts of today's [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

By the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire was driven out of Hungary , and Austria brought the empire under central control. Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] was supported by the Croatians in the [[War of Austrian Succession]] of 1741–1748 and subsequently made significant contributions to Croatian matters.

With the fall of the [[Venetian Republic]] in 1797, its possessions in eastern [[Adriatic]] became subject to a dispute between France and Austria. The Habsburgs eventually secured them (by 1815) and Dalmatia and Istria became part of the empire, though they were in [[Cisleithania]] while Croatia and Slavonia were under Hungary.

[[File:Austria-Hungary map new.svg|thumb|200px|Two parts of Triune Kingdom: Croatia-Slavonia (number 17) and Dalmatia (number 5) within Austria-Hungary]]
Croatian [[romantic nationalism]] emerged in mid-19th century to counteract the apparent [[Germanization]] and [[Magyarization]] of Croatia. The [[Illyrian movement]] attracted a number of influential figures from 1830s on, and produced some important advances in the [[Croatian language]] and culture.

In the [[the Revolutions of 1848 in Habsburg areas|Revolutions of 1848]] Croatia, driven by fear of Magyar nationalism, supported the Habsburg court against Hungarian revolutionary forces. However, despite the contributions of its ban [[Josip Jelačić|Jelačić]] in quenching the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian war of independence]], Croatia, not treated any more favourably by Vienna than the Hungarians themselves, lost its domestic autonomy. In 1867 the [[Austria-Hungary|Dual Monarchy]] was [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|created]]; Croatian autonomy was restored in 1868 with the [[Croatian–Hungarian Settlement]] which was comparatively favourable for the Croatians, but still problematic because of issues such as the [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)|unresolved status of Rijeka]].

== Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918–1941) ==
{{Main|Croatia in the first Yugoslavia}}
[[File:Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.svg|thumb|right|Coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]]]
Shortly before the end of the First World War in 1918, the [[Croatian Parliament]] severed relations with Austria-Hungary as the [[Little Entente|Entente]] armies defeated those of the Habsburgs. ''Croatia and Slavonia'' became a part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] composed out of all Southern Slavic territories of the now former [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] with a transitional government headed in [[Zagreb]]. Although the state inherited much of Austro-Hungary's military arsenal, including the entire fleet, the Kingdom of Italy moved rapidly to annex the state's most western territories, promised to her by the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] of 1915. An Italian Army eventually took [[Istria]], started to annex the Adriatic islands one by one, and even landed in Zadar. After [[Srijem]] left ''Croatia and Slavonia'' and joined Serbia together with Vojvodina, which was shortly followed by a referendum to join Bosnia and Herzegovina to Serbia, the People's Council (''Narodno vijeće'') of the state, guided by what was by that time a half a century long tradition of [[pan-Slavism]] and without sanction of the Croatian [[sabor]], joined the [[History of Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia]] into the [[Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. The territory of Croatia largely comprised the territories of the [[Sava Banate|Sava]] and [[Littoral Banate]]s.

The Kingdom underwent a crucial change in 1921 to the dismay of Croatia's largest political party, the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (Hrvatska seljačka stranka). The new constitution abolished the historical/political entities, including Croatia and Slavonia, centralizing authority in the capital of [[Belgrade]]. The Croatian Peasant Party boycotted the government of the Serbian [[People's Radical Party]] throughout the period, except for a brief interlude between 1925 and 1927, when external Italian expansionism was at hand with her allies, [[Albania]], Hungary, [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] that threatened Yugoslavia as a whole.

In the early 1920s the Yugoslav government of Serbian prime minister [[Nikola Pasic]] used police pressure over voters and ethnic minorities, confiscation of opposition pamphlets&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,846181,00.html Balkan Politics], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', March 31, 1923&lt;/ref&gt; and other measures of [[rigged election|election rigging]] to keep the opposition, and mainly the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] and its allies in minority in Yugoslav parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,719894,00.html Elections], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', February 23, 1925&lt;/ref&gt; Pasic believed that Yugoslavia should be as centralized as possible, creating in place of distinct regional governments and identities a [[Greater Serbia]]n national concept of concentrated power in the hands of Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,720153,00.html The Opposition], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', April 6, 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2010-0420-502, Stefan Radic, cropped.jpg|thumb|right| [[Stjepan Radić]]]] During a Parliament session in 1928, the [[Croatian Peasant Party]]'s leader [[Stjepan Radić]] was mortally wounded by [[Puniša Račić]], a deputy of the Serbian Radical People's Party, which caused further upsets among the Croatian elite. In 1929, King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Aleksandar]] proclaimed a dictatorship and imposed a new constitution which, among other things, renamed the country the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Political parties were banned from the start and the royal dictatorship took on an increasingly harsh character. [[Vladko Maček]], who had succeeded Radić as leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, the largest political party in Croatia, was imprisoned, and members of a newly emerging insurgent movement, the [[Ustaše]], went into exile. According to the British historian [[Misha Glenny]] the murder in March 1929 of Toni Schlegel, editor of a pro-Yugoslavian newspaper ''Novosti'', brought a &quot;furious response&quot; from the regime. In [[Lika]] and west [[Herzegovina]] in particular, which he described as &quot;hotbeds of Croatian separatism,&quot; he wrote that the majority-Serb police acted &quot;with no restraining authority whatsoever.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Misha Glenny, ''The Balkans 1804–1999'', Granta Books, London 1345, pp. 431–432&lt;/ref&gt; And in the words of a prominent Croatian writer, Shlegel's death became the pretext for terror in all forms. Politics was soon &quot;indistinguishable from gangsterism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Josip Horvat, ''Politička povijest Hrvatske 1918–1929'' (Political History of Croatia 1918–1929), Zagreb, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Even in this oppressive climate, few rallied to the Ustaša cause and the movement was never able to organise within Croatia. But its leaders did manage to convince the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|Communist Party]] that it was a progressive movement. The party's newspaper ''Proleter'' (December 1932) stated: &quot;[We] salute the Ustaša movement of the peasants of Lika and Dalmatia and fully support them.&quot;

In 1934, King Aleksandar was [[assassination|assassinated]] abroad, in [[Marseille]], by a coalition of the  Ustaše and a similarly radical movement, the Macedonian pro-Bulgarian [[VMORO]]. The Serbian-[[Croats|Croatian]] [[Dragiša Cvetković|Cvetković]]-Maček government that came to power, distanced Yugoslavia's former allies of France and the United Kingdom, and moved closer to Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany in the period of 1935–1941. A national [[Banovina of Croatia]] was created in 1939 out of the two Banates, as well as parts of the Zeta, [[Vrbas Banovina|Vrbas]], [[Drina Banovina|Drina]] and Danube Banates. It had a reconstructed Croatian Parliament which would choose a Croatian [[Ban (title)|Ban]] and Viceban. This Croatia included a part of [[Bosnia (region)]], most of [[Herzegovina]] and the city of [[Dubrovnik]] and the surroundings.

== World War II (1941–1945)==
{{Main|Independent State of Croatia}}
[[File:Ante Pavelic.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Ante Pavelić]], self-proclaimed &quot;''Poglavnik''&quot; of the [[Independent State of Croatia]].]]
The [[Axis powers|Axis]] occupation of Yugoslavia in 1941 allowed the Croatian radical right [[Ustaše]] to come into power, forming the &quot;[[Independent State of Croatia]]&quot;, led by [[Ante Pavelić]], who assumed the role of ''Poglavnik'' (&quot;Head-man&quot;) ''Nezavisne Drzave Hrvatske'' (&quot;Leader of the Independent State of Croatia&quot;). Following the pattern of other fascist regimes in Europe, the Ustashi enacted racial laws, formed eight concentration camps targeting minority Serbs, [[Romani people|Roma]]s and Jewish populations, as well as [[Croatians|Croatian]] [[Partisan (military)|partisans]]. The biggest concentration camp was [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]] in Croatia. The NDH had a program, formulated by [[Mile Budak]], to purge Croatia of [[Serbs]], by &quot;killing one third, expelling the other third and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilating]] the remaining third&quot;. The first part of this program began during WWII with a planned [[genocide]] in [[Jasenovac]] and other locations in the NDH&lt;ref&gt;Glenny, Misha. Balkans: Nationalism, War and the Great Powers, 1804–1999. New York, USA: Penguin Books, 2001. Pp. 431 &lt;br /&gt;USTASHE. &quot;With the financial assistance of Italian government, Pavelic set about the construction of two main training camps, one in Hungary, one in Italy...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
The main targets for persecution, however, were the Serbs. 60.000s of Serbs were killed.

The anti-fascist communist-led [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] movement, based on pan-Yugoslav ideology, emerged in early 1941, under the command of Croatian-born [[Josip Broz Tito]], spreading quickly into many parts of [[Yugoslavia]]. The [[1st Sisak Partisan Detachment]], often hailed as the first armed anti-fascist resistance [[Military unit|unit]] in occupied Europe, was formed in Croatia, in the Brezovica forest near the town of Sisak. As the movement began to gain popularity, the Partisans gained strength from Croats, Bosniaks, Serbs, Slovenes, and Macedonians who believed in a unified, but federal, Yugoslav state.

By 1943, the Partisan resistance movement had gained the upper hand, against the odds, and in 1945, with help from the Soviet [[Red Army]] (passing only through small parts such as [[Vojvodina]]), expelled the Axis forces and local supporters. The ''[[ZAVNOH]]'', state anti-fascist council of people's liberation of Croatia, functioned since 1944 and formed an interim civil government. NDH's ministers of War and Internal Security [[Mladen Lorković]] and [[Ante Vokić]] tried to switch to Allied side. Pavelić was in the beginning supporting them but when he found that he would need to leave his position he imprisoned them in Lepoglava prison where they were executed.

Following the defeat of the Independent  State of Croatia at the end of the war a large number of  [[Ustaše]], and civilians supporting them (ranging from sympathisers, young conscripts, anti-communists, and ordinary serfs who were motivated by Partisan atrocities) attempted to flee in the direction of Austria hoping to surrender to British forces and to be given refuge. They were instead interned by British forces and then returned to the Partisans. A large number of these persons were killed in what has come to be called the [[Bleiburg massacre]].

== SFR Yugoslavia (1945–1991) ==
[[File:SR Croatia coa.png|thumb|right|Coat of arms of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]]]]
[[File:SFRY Croatia.png|thumb|right|Croatia in [[SFRY]]]] {{Main|Socialist Republic of Croatia}}
Croatia was a [[Socialist Republic]] part of a six-part Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia. Under the new communist system, privately owned factories  and estates were [[nationalization|nationalized]], and the economy was based on a type of planned [[market socialism]]. The country underwent a rebuilding process, recovered from World War II, went through [[industrialization]] and started developing tourism.

The country's socialist system also provided free [[apartments]] from big companies, which with the [[workers' self-management]] [[investments]] paid for the living spaces. From 1963, the citizens of Yugoslavia were allowed to travel to almost any country because of the neutral politics. No visas were required to travel to eastern or western countries, capitalist or communist nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942012,00.html Socialism of Sorts] June 10, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Such free travel was unheard of at the time in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, and in some western countries as well (e.g. Spain or Portugal, both dictatorships at the time). This proved to be very helpful for Croatia's inhabitants who found working in foreign countries more financially rewarding. Upon retirement, a popular plan was to  return to live in Croatia (then Yugoslavia) to buy a more expensive [[property]].

In Yugoslavia, the people of Croatia were guaranteed free [[healthcare]], free [[dental care]], and secure [[pensions]]. The older generation found this very comforting as pensions would sometimes exceed their former [[payroll|paychecks]]. Free trade and travel within the country also helped Croatian [[industries]] that [[imported]] and [[exported]] throughout all the former republics. Students and military personnel were encouraged to visit other republics to learn more about the country, and all levels of education, especially [[secondary education]] and [[higher education]], were gratis.

The economy developed into a type of socialism called ''samoupravljanje'' (self-management), in which workers controlled socially-owned enterprises. This kind of market socialism created significantly better economic conditions than in the Eastern Bloc countries. Croatia went through intensive industrialization in the 1960s and 1970s with industrial output increasing several-fold and with Zagreb surpassing Belgrade for the amount of industry. Factories and other organizations were often named after [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] who were declared [[People's Hero of Yugoslavia|national heroes]]. This practice also spread to street names, names of parks and buildings and some more trivial features.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tito-gadafi.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Tito meets with [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] in 1975.]] --&gt;

Before World War II, Croatia's industry was not significant, with the vast majority of the people employed in agriculture. By 1991 the country was completely transformed into a modern industrialized state. By the same time, the Croatian [[Adriatic coast]] had taken shape as an internationally popular [[tourism|tourist destination]], all coastal republics (but mostly SR Croatia) profited greatly from this, as tourist numbers reached levels still unsurpassed in modern Croatia. The government brought unprecedented economic and industrial growth, high levels of social security and a very low crime rate. The country completely recovered from WW2 and achieved a very high GDP and economic growth rate, significantly higher than the present-day [[Republic]].

The constitution of 1963 balanced the power in the country between the Croats and the Serbs, and alleviated the fact that the Croats were again in a minority. Trends after 1965 (like the fall of [[OZNA]] and [[UDBA]] chief [[Aleksandar Ranković]] from power in 1966),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905720,00.html The Specter of Separatism], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', February 7, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; however, led to the [[Croatian Spring]] of 1970–71, when students in Zagreb organized demonstrations for greater civil liberties and greater Croatian autonomy. The regime stifled the public protest and incarcerated the leaders, but this led to the ratification of a new Constitution in 1974, giving more rights to the individual republics.

At that time, radical [[Ustaše]] cells of Croatian émigrés in Western Europe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,905959,00.html Conspiratorial Croats], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', June 5, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; planned  and guerilla acts inside Yugoslavia, but they were largely countered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906151,00.html Battle in Bosnia], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', July 24, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, after Tito's death, economic, political, and religious difficulties started to mount and the federal government began to crumble. The crisis in [[Kosovo]] and, in 1986, the emergence of [[Slobodan Milošević]] in Serbia provoked a very negative reaction in Croatia and [[Slovenia]]; politicians from both republics feared that his motives would threaten their republics' autonomy. With the climate of change throughout Eastern Europe during the 1980s, the communist hegemony was challenged (at the same time, the Milošević government began to gradually [[Anti-bureaucratic revolution|concentrate Yugoslav power in Serbia]]) and calls for free multi-party elections were becoming louder.

{{Main|Croatian War of Independence}}
In 1990, the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|first free elections]] were held. A people's movement called the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) won out by a relatively slim margin against the reformed communist [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|Party of Democratic Change]] (SDP), led by [[Franjo Tuđman]] (former general in Tito's Partisan movement) and [[Ivica Račan]] (former president of Croatia's League of Communists, the SKH ) respectively. However, Croatia's British-style [[first-past-the-post]] election system enabled Tuđman to form the government relatively independently. The HDZ's intentions were to secure independence for Croatia, contrary to the wishes of a part of the ethnic Serbs in the republic, and official politics of Belgrade. The excessively polarized climate soon escalated into complete estrangement between the two nations and even sectarian violence.

In the summer of 1990, Serbs from the mountainous areas where they constituted a majority rebelled and formed a new entity, the so-called ''Autonomous Region of the Serb Krajina'' (later the ''[[Republic of Serbian Krajina]]''); neither were recognised by a single country outside of their proposed borders. Any intervention by the Croatian police was obstructed by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA), now containing a significantly larger percentage of Serbs. The conflict culminated with the ''log revolution'', in which the Krajina Serbs blocked the roads to the tourist destinations in [[Dalmatia]].

The civilian population fled the areas of armed conflict ''en masse'': generally speaking, hundreds of thousands of Croats moved away from the Bosnian and Serbian border areas, while thousands of Serbs moved towards it. In many places, masses of civilians were forced out by the [[Yugoslav National Army]] (JNA), who consisted mostly of conscripts from Serbia and Montenegro, and irregulars from Serbia, in what became known as [[ethnic cleansing]].

The border city of [[Vukovar]] underwent a three month siege — the [[Battle of Vukovar]] — during which most of the city was destroyed and a majority of the population was forced to flee. The city fell to the Serbian forces on November 18, 1991 and the [[Vukovar massacre]] occurred.

Subsequent UN-sponsored cease-fires followed, and the warring parties mostly entrenched. The Yugoslav People's Army retreated from Croatia into [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] where a new cycle of tensions were escalating: the [[Bosnian War]] was to start. During 1992 and 1993, Croatia also handled an estimated 700,000 refugees from Bosnia, mainly [[Bosnian Muslims]].

Armed conflict in Croatia remained intermittent and mostly on a small scale until 1995. In early August, Croatia embarked on [[Operation Storm]], this action, though illegal under the UN{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}, would not have been initiated if not for the approval from the United States. The Croatian attack quickly reconquered most of the territories from the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] authorities, leading to a mass exodus of the Serbian population. An estimated 90,000–350,000 Serbs fled shortly before,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/d0cd11bdf1350357802566d60046e3b7?Opendocument Croatian report from 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnesty.org/en/report/info/EUR64/002/2005 Amnesty International report]&lt;/ref&gt; during and after the operation. As a result of this operation, a few months later the [[Bosnian war]] ended with the negotiation of the [[Dayton Agreement]]. A peaceful integration of the remaining Serbian-controlled territories in [[Eastern Slavonia]] was completed in 1998 under UN supervision. Majority of the Serbs who fled from the former [[Krajina]] have not returned due to fear of being killed, and the Croatian government has done little to encourage Serbs to return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.predsjednik.hr/default.asp?ru=317&amp;gl=200705160000004&amp;sid=&amp;jezik=2 Statement of Croatian president]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hrw.org/croatian/docs/2007/01/11/croati14916.htm Human rights report from 2006 on Croatian&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tuđman late rule (1995-1999) ===
[[File:FranjoTudman.JPG|thumb|right|Tuđman in 1996]] The modern period in [[Croatia]]n history begins in 1990 with the country's change of political and economic system as well as Declaring independence from [[Yugoslavia]] in 1991, and obtaining it in 1992.

Following the end of the war, [[Franjo Tuđman]]'s government started to lose popularity as it was criticized (among other things) for its involvement in suspicious [[privatization]] deals of the early 1990s. In 1995, the opposition surprisingly won in the capital of [[Zagreb]], which led to the [[Zagreb crisis]] when Tuđman refused to accept this victory.

Tuđman has been accused that his domestic policy was quite non-democratic.
Even during his presidency there were circles in society who claimed that Tuđman's rule was autocratic and that he showed little sensitivity to criticism. In particular, these circles consider that during the Tuđman era civil rights record to the minority Serb population was poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_News_Article&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Franjo Tudjman: Father of Croatia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/294990.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=1999-12-11 |accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Franjo Tudjman: Father of Croatia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/294990.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=1999-12-11 |accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 a review from the [[International Press Institute|IPI]] reported about an increased number of [[libel]] law suits that were initiated during Tuđman's mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freemedia.at/cms/ipi/freedom_detail.html?country=/KW0001/KW0003/KW0054/&amp;year=2001 |title=2001 World Press Freedom Review, Croatia |accessdate=2008-12-23 |publisher=International Press Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an economic view, the Republic of Croatia (as well as the remainder of Yugoslavia) experienced a serious depression. Tuđman initiated the process of privatization and de-nationalization in Croatia, however, this was far from transparent or fully legal. The fact that the new government's legal system was inefficient and slow, as well as the wider context of the [[Yugoslav wars]] caused numerous incidents known collectively in Croatia as the &quot;Privatization robbery&quot; ([[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''&quot;privatizacijska pljačka&quot;''). [[Nepotism]] was endemic and during this period many influential individuals with the backing of the authorities acquired state-owned property and companies at extremely low prices, afterwards selling them off piecemeal to the highest bidder for much larger sums. This proved very lucrative for the new owners, but in the vast majority of cases this (along with the separation from the previously secured Yugoslav markets) also caused the [[bankruptcy]] of the (previously successful) firm, causing the [[unemployment]] of thousands of citizens, a problem Croatia still struggles with to this day. &lt;br /&gt;
This was all helped, not just by the (allegedly purposeful) inadequacy of legal restrictions, but also by the apparently active support of the new Croatia's authorities, ultimately controlled by Tuđman from his strong presidential position. In the end this shed an increasingly negative light, and cast a shadow on his notable successes as a strategist and wartime statesman. Excluding the mostly rural rebel-occupied areas (the so-called [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]]), in the last two years of Tuđman's first tenure the detrimental effects of &quot;wild&quot; and unrestricted capitalism had become strikingly visible, with more than 400,000 unemployed citizens, and a significant drop in the [[GDP per capita]], problems Croatia struggles with to this day.

Croatia became a member of the [[Council of Europe]] on November 6, 1996. 1996 and 1997 were a period of post-war recovery and improving economic conditions.

The remaining part of former &quot;Krajina&quot;, areas adjacent to [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FR Yugoslavia]], negotiated a peaceful reintegration process with the Croatian Government. The so-called [[Erdut Agreement]] made the area a temporary protectorate of the [[UN Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium]]. The area was formally re-integrated into Croatia on January 15, 1998.

{{main|Accession of Croatia to the European Union}}

==== Račan government (2000-2003) ====
Tuđman died in 1999 and in the early [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2000|2000 parliamentary elections]], the nationalist [[Croatian Democratic Union|HDZ]] government was replaced by a center-left coalition, with [[Ivica Račan]] as prime minister. At the same time, [[Croatian presidential election, 2000|presidential elections]] were held which were won by a moderate, [[Stjepan Mesić]].

The new Račan government amended the [[Constitution]], changing the political system from a [[presidential system]] to a [[parliamentary system]], transferring most executive presidential powers from the president onto the institutions of the [[Parliament]] and the [[Prime Minister]]. Nevertheless the President remained the [[Commander-in-Chief]], and notably used this power in response to the [[Twelve Generals' Letter]].

The new government also started several large building projects, including state-sponsored [[house|housing]] and the building of the vital [[Zagreb]]-[[Split (city)|Split]] Highway, today's [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]].

The country rebounded from a mild [[recession]] in 1998/1999 and achieved notable economic growth during the following years. The [[unemployment]] rate would continue to rise until 2001 when it finally started falling. Return of refugees accelerated as many homes were rebuilt by the government; most Croats had already returned (except for some in [[Vukovar]]), whereas only a third of the Serbs had done so, impeded by unfavorable property laws as well as ethnic and economic issues.

The Račan government is often credited with bringing Croatia out of semi-isolation of the Tuđman era. Croatia became a [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) member on November 30, 2000. The country signed a [[Stabilization and Association agreement]] (SAA) with the [[European Union]] in October 2001, and applied for membership in February/March 2003.

====Sanader government (2003-2009) ====
In late 2003, [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2003|new parliamentary elections]] were held and a reformed HDZ party won under leadership of [[Ivo Sanader]], who became prime minister. After some delay caused by controversy over extradition of army generals to the [[ICTY]], in 2004 the [[European Commission]] finally issued a recommendation that the accession negotiations with Croatia should begin. Its report on Croatia described it as a modern democratic society with a competent economy and the ability to take on further obligations, provided it continued the reform process.

The country was given EU applicant status on June 18, 2004 and a negotiations framework was set up in March 2005. Actual negotiations began after the capture of general [[Ante Gotovina]] in December 2005, which resolved outstanding issues with the [[ICTY]] in the Hague. However, numerous complications stalled the negotiating process, most notably during [[Slovenia's blockade of Croatia's EU accession]] from December 2008 until September 2009. Croatian accession to the EU is expected in the next years.

In August 2007, Croatia experienced its worst post-war tragedy. During the [[2007 Croatian coast fires|fires that ravaged its coast]], 12 firemen died as a result of a fire on Kornat island.

Sanader was reelected in the closely contested [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2007|2007 parliamentary election]]. In June 2009, Sanader abruptly resigned his post, leaving scarce explanation for his actions, and rumours of involvement in various criminal cases became increasingly rampant. He tried to comeback in [[HDZ]] in 2010, but was then ejected, charged for corruption by authorities, and later arrested in Austria.

==== Kosor government (2009) ====
[[Jadranka Kosor]] assumed the head of the government following Sanader's resignation. Kosor introduced [[austerity]] measures to topple the economic crisis and launched an anti-[[corruption]] campaign aimed at public officials.

Jadranka Kosor signed an agreement with [[Borut Pahor]], the premier of [[Slovenia]], in November 2009, that ended [[Slovenia's blockade of Croatia's EU accession]] and allowed [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|Croatian EU entry negotiations]] to proceed.

In the [[Croatian presidential election, 2009-2010|first round of the 2010 presidential election]] the HDZ candidate [[Andrija Hebrang (son)|Andrija Hebrang]] achieved an embarrassing 12% claiming third place, the lowest result for an HDZ presidential candidate ever. [[Ivo Josipović]], the candidate of the largest opposition party, the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]], won a landslide victory in the resulting [[Croatian presidential election, 2009-2010|runoff on January 10]].

In June 2010, Kosor proposed loosening the labor law and making it more business friendly, in order to foster economic growth. This was greatly opposed by the unions: a petition  demanding a referendum  was unprecedentedly signed by over 700,000 citizens. Just as the [[Croatian labour law referendum, 2010]] was being prepared, the government decided to drop the proposed changes, and the [[Constitutional Court of Croatia|Constitutional Court]] ultimately declared the referendum issue moot, but ordered the government not to subject any changes to the labor law in the following year.

'''[[Croatia]]''' is located in Southeastern Europe (aka the western [[Balkans]]) between [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlada.hr/en/about_croatia/information/identity_card |title=Identity Card / Information |publisher=Government of the Republic of Croatia |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The World Factbook - Croatia |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/hr.html |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It borders the [[Adriatic Sea]] along its 5,835&amp;nbsp;km coastline. Its size is comparable to that of [[West Virginia]] or [[Nova Scotia]]. Croatia has a 932&amp;nbsp;km border with [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a 670&amp;nbsp;km border with [[Slovenia]], a 329&amp;nbsp;km border with [[Hungary]], a 241&amp;nbsp;km border with [[Serbia]] (its Autonomous Province of Vojvodina entirely) and a 25&amp;nbsp;km border with [[Montenegro]]. Islands and coastal areas in Croatia have a [[Mediterranean climate]] while inland areas have temperate continental climate with hot summers with low overall humidity levels but frequent rainshowers and cold snowy winters. The local terrain is quite diverse given the size of the country. There are flat plains along the Hungarian border, low mountains and highlands near the [[Adriatic]] coastline and islands. Croatia's strategic location gives it control over most land routes from Western Europe to the [[Aegean Sea]] and the Turkish Straits. The country's natural resources include [[Petroleum]], some [[coal]], [[bauxite]], low-grade [[iron]] ore, [[calcium]], natural [[asphalt]], [[silica]], [[mica]], [[clay]]s, [[salt]] and [[hydropower]].

=== Changes in the late 20th century ===
: ''See also: [[Serbs of Croatia#History|Recent history of the Serbs of Croatia]]''

The census of 1991 was the last one held before the war in Croatia, marked by ethnic conflict between Serbs and Croats. In the ethnic and religious composition of the population of Croatia of that time, these two sets of numbers are quoted as important:
* Croats ''78.1%'', Catholics ''76.5%''
* Serbs ''12.2%'', Orthodox Christians ''11.1%''

There was also a significant drop in people who declared [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav ethnicity]].

There were two major sets of population movements during this period - the first one during the earlier stage of the war, around 1991, and the second one during the later stage of the war, around 1995. The first movement peaked at around 200,000 on the Croatian side; the second movement peaked at around 550,000 on the Serbian side.

After the end of the war of the 1990s, as a result of all which took place previously, the ethno-religious structure for the two largest nations were:
* Croats ''89.6%'', Catholics ''87.8%''
* Serbs ''4.5%'', Orthodox Christians ''4.4%''

Most Croat refugees have since returned to their homes, while two thirds of the Serbs remain in exile; the other third either returned or had remained in Zagreb and other parts of Croatia not directly affected by war.

==Languages==
:Croatian 96.1%, [[Serbian language|Serbian]] 1%, other and undesignated 2.9% (including [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], and [[German language|German]]) (2001 census).
:According to a survey ordered by the European commission, 49% of [[Croats]] speak [[english language|English]], 34% [[german language|German]], 14% [[italian language|Italian]], 4% [[french language|French]] and [[russian language|Russian]] and 2% [[spanish language|Spanish]] [[language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf|title=Europeans and their languages - European commission special barometer FEB2006|accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religions==

[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] is the predominant religion, while there's also [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Islam]].
:Roman Catholic 87.8%, Orthodox 4.4%, Protestant 0.3% (mostly Reformed-Calvinist and Lutheran), Muslim 1.3%, other and unspecified 0.9%, none 5.2% (2001 census)

The main executive power of the Croatian state is the government (in Croatian: &quot;vlada&quot;), presided by the Prime Minister. The government ministers (the cabinet) are appointed by the prime minister with the consent of the Parliament. The prime minister is the head of government, appointed by the President with the consent of the Parliament who takes his duty when Parliament gives its consent by absolute majority of all representatives.

:''See also: [http://www.vlada.hr/]

===Current government===
*[[Prime Minister of Croatia|Prime Minister]]: Jadranka Kosor (since July 6, 2009);
*Deputy Prime Ministers: [[Đurđa Adlešić]] (since 2008) and [[Slobodan Uzelac]] (since 2008).

Government ministers are from the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (HSS).

The [[Presidents of Croatia|President of the Republic of Croatia]] is the head of state and is elected by popular vote for a five-year term. A president may not serve more than two terms. The president has limited executive powers, he/she is still commander-of-chief of the armed forces, he/she cooperates in formulation and execution of the foreign policy and the national security policy, represents Croatia home and abroad, convenes Parliament and can bring issues at Government. The main duty of the President is that he/she is granted power to issue decrees with the force of law during war time.

==Legislative branch==
The Croatian legislature is the ''[[Croatian Parliament|Hrvatski Sabor]]''.
The [[Croatian Parliament|Assembly]] is unicameral, has between 100 and 160 members, exact number was decided by the legislature -  elected for a four year term, 140 members in multi-seat [[constituency|constituencies]], up to 6 members chosen by [[proportional representation]] to represent Croatians residing abroad and 5 members of ethnic and national communities or minorities.

The Chamber of Counties or ''Županijski Dom'' used to be composed of three deputies from each of the 21 counties (''županije''). However, as it had no practical power over the Chamber of Representatives, in 2001 it was abolished and its powers transferred directly to the county governments.

The Sabor meets in public sessions in two periods: January 15 to June 30, and September 15 to December 15. Extra sessions can be called by the President of the Republic, by the President of the Parliament or by Government. The powers of the legislature include enactment and amendment of the constitution; passage of laws; adoption of the state budget; declarations of war and peace; alteration of the boundaries of the Republic; calling referendums; carrying out elections, appointments, and relief of office; supervising the work of the Government of Croatia and other holders of public powers responsible to the Sabor; and granting amnesty.

Decisions are made based on a majority vote if more than half of the Chamber is present, except in cases of national rights and constitutional issues.

Counties are regional self-government units that carry out the affairs of regional significance, and in particular the affairs related to education, health service, area and urban planning, economic development, traffic and traffic infrastructure and the development of network of educational, health, social and cultural institutions. 

In practice, this autonomy is very limited since counties must obey national laws and executive orders from the national level.

Municipalities and towns are local self-government units that carry out the affairs of local jurisdiction by which the needs of citizens are directly fulfilled, and in particular the affairs related to the organisation of localities and housing, area and urban planning, public utilities, child care, social welfare, primary health services, education and elementary schools, culture, physical education and sports, customer protection, protection and improvement of the environment, fire protection and civil defence.

==Political history==
{{merge|History of Croatia|month=January 2011|date=January 2011}}
[[Stjepan Radić]] was a Croatian politician and the founder of the Croatian Peasant Party (CPP, Hrvatska Seljačka Stranka) in 1905. Radić is credited with galvanizing the Croatian peasantry into a viable political force for the first time. Under the pressure from the Great powers (British Empire, France, United States), as well as honouring the secret deals that were struck between the Antanta and the Kingdom of Serbia the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was established and two representatives of Radić's party (by then named the Croatian Common-people Peasant Party) were appointed to the Provisional Representation which served as a parliament until elections for the Constituent could be held. Death threats and threats of violent beatings were made against Stjepan Radić in parliament, without any intervention by the president of the Assembly (Parliamentary speaker). In the Assembly, Puniša Račić, a member of Serbian [[People's Radical Party]] from Montenegro, got up and made a provocative speech which produced a stormy reaction from the opposition but Radić himself stayed completely silent. Finally Ivan Pernar shouted, &quot;thou plundered beys&quot;. At this Puniša Račić drew out a revolver, shot Pernar and went on to shoot Radić and several other CPP delegates. (source: Zvonimir Kulundžić Atentat na Stjepana Radića/The assassination of Stjepan Radić) Radić was left for dead and indeed had such a serious stomach wound that he died several months later at the age of 57.
Following the ethnic tensions triggered by the shooting, in January 1929 King Aleksandar Karađorđević abolished the constitution, dissolved parliament, and declared a royal dictatorship.Radić's violent death turned him into a martyr and he was turned into an icon of political struggle for the peasantry and the working class, as well as an icon of Croatian patriots. The iconography of Stjepan Radić was later used not only by his successor Vladko Maček, but also by other political options in Croatia: right wing or left wing. The Ustaše used the death of Stjepan Radić as proof of Serbian hegemony, and as an excuse for their treatment of Serbs, however many leading CPP figures were imprisoned or killed by the Ustashe. The Partisans on the other hand used this as a recruiting point with CPP members who were disillusioned with the NDH, a latter had one brigade named after Antun and Stjepan Radić in 1943. 

The [[Croatian Communist Party]] was the only party during [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|socialist Yugoslavia]], 1945-1990. The change of the name to League of Communists of Croatia (''Savez Komunista Hrvatske'', SKH) in the fifties was intended to emphasize the advisory role of the party, while actual power was supposed to be in hands of the working class. There were very few controversies and factional clashes in the SKH. Among the most important was the so called &quot;[[Croatian Spring]]&quot; in 1971 when some leaders of the SKH, most notably [[Savka Dabčević-Kučar]] and [[Miko Tripalo]] attempted to increase the political and economical independence of Croatia from other Yugoslav republics. Although &quot;Croatian Spring&quot; was broken, the leaders lost their political position and were forced into isolation, and less important leaders were persecuted, practically all the intentions of the mentioned national leaders were accepted and introduced in Yugoslavian constitution from 1974. 

That constitution was relatively unfortunate in a sense that it did not delimit the responsibilities of the republics and federation in Yugoslavia clearly. As a result, when League of Communists lost its unity and authority, and republics started to make opposite, even aggressive political movements, the central government of Yugoslavia was unable to act. As a result, neither a peaceful break up, nor a military putsch was possible in the time of crisis, and country ended in bloody, tragic war.

In the situation where Serb leaders, especially members of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] and Serbian president [[Slobodan Milošević]] started to threaten Croatia and prepare for a war, the first multi-party elections took place in 1990. The League of Communists changed its policy and name to the &quot;Party of Democratic Changes&quot; (SDP), however, the impression of the people was that this party could not respond to Milošević's threats adequately. The right-wing was represented by the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ), led by the communist general, later Croatian nationalist and dissident [[Franjo Tuđman]]. 

Third bloc at the elections was Coalition of People's Accord, alliance of mostly moderate nationalist parties that included [[Croatian Social Liberal Party]] (HSLS), [[Social Democrats of Croatia]] (SDSH), [[Croatian Democratic Party]] (HDS), as well as many prominent veterans of Croatian Spring. Due to [[voting system]] that favoured two strong parties, coalition got surprisingly few seats during that election, and HDZ won easily.

However, increased crime in all parts of the society and a growing personal cult of Franjo Tuđman caused revival of the popularity of the at one moment almost dead ex-communist party. Vujić's SDSH united with SDP. HSLS split into two parties, led by their charismatic leaders: [[Vlado Gotovac]]'s [[Liberal Party (Croatia)|Liberal Party]], and the more nationalist [[Dražen Budiša]] won administrative control over HSLS. In following years, these two leaders, especially Budisa led inconsistent policy which resulted in a significant drop in support for the once third most important party in Croatia. D. Budisa even left the party at one point, but he was persuaded to return.

For the 2000 elections, the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]] (SDP) and the [[Croatian Social Liberal Party]] (HSLS) agreed on a join electoral list as did the [[Croatian Peasants Party]] (HSS), [[Croatian People's Party]] (HNS), [[Liberal Party of Croatia]] (LS), and [[Istrian Democratic Assembly]] (IDS). Although these six parties went into the election under two separate lists they had negotiated an outline agreement for a coalition before the election and were known as the &quot;šestorica&quot; or &quot;the six&quot;.

The six-party centre-left coalition was in power until June 2001 when IDS left the governing coalition over its inability to win greater autonomy for Istria.

HSLS split (again; the initial splitoff formed LS) in 2002; the main faction left the government while a dissenting faction formed LIBRA and stayed in power.

The SDP-led coalition remained in power until the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2003|legislative elections of 2003]], when they narrowly lost the majority to HDZ and other center-right parties.

HDZ formed a government in December 2003, even though they haven't formed a major coalition with parties like HSS and [[Croatian Party of Rights]] (HSP). It appears, however, that the new HDZ, under the leadership of I. Sanader, is positioned significantly more on the center than early HDZ was. 

Accession to membership of the [[European Union]] is presently a stated national goal for most mainstream parties, although they vary in the amount of cooperation with the EU rules. The main issues remain in the areas of post-war recovery: both political (refugee return, war crime trials) and economic (agricultural import/export policy). 

One of the more recent trends in Croatian politics is deep alienation of Croatian public from Croatian political establishment. It manifested itself on the latest presidential and local elections through record low turnouts and support for candidates and options that represented alternative to Croatian political mainstream. 

One of the stated reasons for such alienation is in mainstream political parties being oriented towards centre and having almost identical platforms. Another is parties being heavily centralised and  perceived more as representatives of their leaders' personal interests than any palpable political platform. [[Proportional representation]] voting system which leads to coalition governments that often don't make any political sense - a phenomenon which gained a lot of notoriety after 2005 local elections - also contributed to those trends. Croatian public appears to prefer strong personalities with populist tendencies - like [[Boris Mikšić]], [[Milan Bandić]] and [[Branimir Glavaš]] - to well-established parties or any particular ideology.

The alienation from Croatian political mainstream has also manifested itself in the dramatic rise of [[Euroscepticism]] among general public.

The '''Economy of [[Croatia]]''' is a service-based economy, with the service sector accounting for 67% of the total [[GDP]]. The preliminary GDP data for 2008 put Croatian GDP at 370.5 billion [[Croatian Kuna]], or just over USD 15,700 per capita,&lt;ref name=EurostatGDP&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=1073,46870091&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&amp;p_product_code=EB011 Per capita GDP]{{dead link |date=September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; putting Croatia ahead of the EU member states [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]]. The estimated [[Gross Domestic Product]] per capita in [[purchasing power parity]] in 2008 was around USD 18,740 or 63% of the [[European Union|EU]] average for the same year.&lt;ref name=EurostatCrEcon&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-25062009-BP/EN/2-25062009-BP-EN.PDF Croatian economy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipbuilding dominates the industrial sector; with exports of over €1 billion annually, shipbuilding accounts for over 10% of exported goods. Food processing and chemical industry take significant portions of industrial output and are responsible for significant portion of exported goods. Industrial Sector represents 27% of Croatia’s total economic output, and agriculture represents 6%. 

[[File:Slavonija-pred-kisu.jpg|thumb|left|Slavonia, breadbasket region of Croatia.]]

Croatian [[agricultural]] sector subsists from exports of [[Maritime geography#Blue water|blue water fish]], which in recent years experienced a tremendous surge in demand, mainly from [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]. Croatia is a notable producer of [[organic food]]s and much of it is exported to the [[European Union|EU]]. Croatian [[wines]], [[olive]] oils and [[lavender]] are in particularly high demand. 

[[Tourism]] is a notable source of income, particularly during the summer months but also more recently from winter months, due to an increase in popularity of snow sports such as [[skiing]]. With over 10 million foreign tourists annually, tourism generates revenue in excess of €7 billion. Croatia is ranked amongst the top 20 most popular tourist destinations in the world, and was voted the world's top tourism destination of 2005 by [[Lonely Planet]].&lt;ref name=Lonely_Planet&gt;[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/columns/index.htm Top Destinations for 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade has finally begun to play major role in Croatian economic output. In 2007 Croatia exported goods in value of USD 12.84 billion (24.7 billion including service exports). Croatia has stable functioning market economy with the strong and stable currency, the [[Croatian Kuna|Kuna]].

[[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]], the two westernmost republics in what was formerly known as [[Yugoslavia]], alone accounted for nearly half of the total Yugoslavian [[GDP]], and this reflected in overall [[living standard]] which in Croatia's case was over 50% above the Yugoslav average, and close to 90% in Slovenia. Nevertheless, starting in the late 1980s, at the beginning of the process of economic [[Transition economy|transition]], Croatian economy suffered as result of de-industrialization, war destruction as well as losing the markets of [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] and the [[Comecon|SEV]].

Persistent economic problems still remain: a rather elevated [[unemployment]] of 9.6% in 2007,&lt;ref name = &quot;bwhuxz&quot;&gt;[http://www.hnb.hr/statistika/e-ekonomski_indikatori.htm?tsfsg=15127d5832d6ac210a43438afd2fc966 Ekonomski Indikatori&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as slow progress of economic reforms. Of particular concern is the heavily backlogged [[judiciary]] system, combined with inefficient [[public administration]], especially regarding issues of land ownership and corruption in public sector and political sectors. Unemployment is regionally uneven: it is very high in eastern ([[Slavonia]] and parts of [[Dalmatia]]), nearing 20% in some areas, while relatively low in the northwest and larger cities, mainly [[Istria]], [[Kvarner]], and the [[Zagreb]] area, being between 3 and 7%. Unemployment has been constantly declining by 5% over the last 7 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv_Eng/StatInfo/pdf/StatInfo2006.pdf stat inf 78 do 117.cdr&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has since experienced faster [[economic growth]] and has been preparing for membership in the European Union, its most important [[international trade|trading partner]].

In February 2005, the [[Stabilization and Association Agreement]] with the [[European Union|EU]] officially came into force, and Croatia is [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|advancing towards full EU membership]]. The country expects serious positive economic impulses and high growth rates in the coming years, as currently, Croatia is stagnated by an elevated export deficit and high but manageable debt. Croatia is expecting a major boom in investments, especially [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] investments.

__FORCETOC__

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2007}}

===Pre-1990===
In an [[economics|economy]] traditionally based on agriculture and livestock, peasants comprised more than half of the [[Croatia]]n population until after [[World War II]].  Pre-1945 industrialization was slow and centered on textile mills, sawmills, brick yards, and food-processing plants.
[[File:Croatia agriculture-1.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the fertile [[agriculture|agricultural]] regions, near the [[Neretva]] river]]
Rapid [[industrialization]] and diversification occurred after World War II. [[Decentralization]] came in 1965, allowing growth of certain sectors, like the aforementioned prosperous [[Tourism in Croatia|tourist industry]]. Profits from Croatian industry were used to develop poorer regions in the former Yugoslavia, leading to Croatia contributing much more to the Yugoslavian economy than it ever got back.  This, coupled with [[austerity|austerity program]]s and [[hyperinflation]] in the 1980s, led to discontent in both Croatia and Slovenia that fueled the independence movement. Foreign remittances contributed $2 billion annually to the economy by 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Europa Publications Limited. ''Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States 1999: 1999''. Routledge, 1999. (pg. 279)&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the dissolution of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the Republic of Croatia, after [[Slovenia]], was the most prosperous and industrialized area, with a per capita output more than one-third above the Yugoslav average. Privatization under the new Croatian Government had barely begun when war broke out. As a result of the [[Croatian War of Independence]], the economic infrastructure sustained massive damage during the period, particularly in 1991 and 1992.

===The Tuđman years===
{{update|section|date=November 2010}}

By the end of the 1990s, Croatia faced considerable economic problems stemming from:
* damage during the internecine fighting to bridges, factories, power lines, buildings, and houses;
* the large refugee and displaced population, both Croatian and Bosnian
* the disruption of economic ties; and
* mishandled privatization

The Republic of Croatia, along with the remainder of the former Yugoslavia, experienced a serious depression. President [[Franjo Tuđman]] initiated the process of privatization and de-nationalization in Croatia; however, it was far from transparent. The fact that the new government's legal system was inefficient and slow, as well as the wider context of the [[Yugoslav wars]], caused numerous incidents known collectively in Croatia as the &quot;Privatization robbery&quot; [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''&quot;privatizacijska pljačka&quot;''), or the [[Croatian privatization controversy]]. [[Nepotism]] was endemic, with the President deciding on a concept of &quot;200 families&quot; that would control all property in Croatia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/63969/ivic-pasalic-tajni-ortak-hypo-banke | language = Croatian | newspaper = [[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]] | title = Ivić Pašalić tajni ortak Hypo banke | author = Berislav Jelinić | quote = Polovinom 90-ih Tuđman je odobrio projekt Ivića Pašalića baziran na Tuđmanovoj ideji o 200 obitelji koje bi vladale hrvatskom imovinom | date = 2009-08-03 | accessdate = 2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during this period many influential individuals with the backing of the authorities acquired state-owned property and companies at extremely low prices, afterwards selling them off piecemeal to the highest bidder for much larger sums. In the majority of cases, however, this, along with the separation from the previously secured Yugoslav [[market]]s, also led to [[bankruptcy]] of the firms, causing the [[unemployment]] of thousands of citizens, a problem Croatia still struggles with to this day. [[Miroslav Kutle]] was one of the leading businessmen in these endeavors, and he was subsequently incarcerated on multiple counts of embezzlement.

This was all helped, not just by the &lt;nowiki&gt;[allegedly purposeful]&lt;/nowiki&gt; inadequacy of legal restrictions, but also by the apparently active support of the new Croatia's authorities {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}, ultimately controlled by Tuđman from his strong presidential position. In the end this shed an increasingly negative light, and cast a shadow on his notable successes as a strategist and wartime statesman. Excluding the mostly rural rebel-occupied areas (the so-called [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]]), in the last two years of Tuđman's first tenure the detrimental effects of &quot;wild&quot; and unrestricted [[capitalism]] had become strikingly visible, with more than 400,000 unemployed citizens, and a significant drop in the [[GDP per capita]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}, problems Croatia struggles with to this day.

Inflation and unemployment rose and the [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] fell{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}, prompting the national bank to tighten [[fiscal policy]].  A new banking law passed in December 1998 gave the central bank more control over Croatia's 53 remaining commercial banks. Croatia is dependent on international debt to finance the deficit.  A recently issued [[euro]]-denominated bond was well received, selling $300 million, which helped offset economic losses from the Kosovo crisis.

Despite the successful value-added tax program, planned privatization of state controlled businesses, and a revised budget with a 7% across that board cut in spending, the government still projected a $200 million deficit for 1999.  

Western aid and investment, especially in the tourist and oil industries, is doing its part to help further develop the economy.  The government has been successful in some reform efforts  &amp;mdash; partially macroeconomic stabilization policies &amp;mdash; and it has normalized relations with its creditors.

In 1998 government founded The Business Innovation Center of Croatia – [[BICRO]], in order to implement technology development and innovation support programs, as an important paradigm of future development.

The [[recession]] that began at the end of 1998 continued through most of 1999, and GDP in 1999 was flat.  [[Inflation]] remained in check and the kuna was stable.  However, consumer demand was weak and industrial production decreased. Structural reform lagged and problems of payment arrears and a lack of banking supervision continued.

Due to the upcoming elections, the HDZ government promised two salary increases to public-sector employees before the end of the year which increased the fiscal deficit.

===After Tudman===
The death of President [[Franjo Tuđman|Tuđman]] in December 1999, and the defeat of his ruling Croatian Democratic Union or HDZ party in parliamentary and presidential elections in January 2000 ushered in a new government committed to economic reform and halting the economic decline.

The [[Ivica Račan|Račan]] government carried out a large number of structural reforms and with tourism as the main factor, the country emerged from recession in 2000.  Due to overall increase in stability, the economic rating of the country improved and [[interest rate]]s dropped.  As a result of [[coalition]] politics and resistance from the unions and the public, many reforms are still overdue, especially in the legal system.

Unemployment reached a peak of around 22% in late 2002 due to many overdue bankruptcies.  It has since been steadily considerably, powered by growing industrial production and rising [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] rather than only seasonal changes (tourism). The GDP rose to the level it had in 1990 only in 2003.

Most economic indicators remained positive in this period, except for the external [[debt]]. The [[Croatian National Bank]] had to take steps to curb further growth of indebtedness of local banks with foreign banks (commonly the same foreign banks that own the local ones).  The dollar debt figure is quite adversely affected by the [[euro|EUR]]/[[USD]] ratio &amp;mdash; over a third of the increase in debt since 2002 is due to currency value changes.

[[Tourism]] is a notable source of income during the summer. With over 10 million foreign tourists a year (as of 2006), Croatia is ranked as the 18th major tourist destination in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwto.org/facts/eng/pdf/highlights/highlights_06_eng_lr.pdf untitled&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Croatian economy is heavily interdependent on other principal economies of Europe, and any negative trends in these larger EU economies, for example those of [[Economy of Germany|Germany]] or [[Economy of Italy|Italy]] also have a negative impact on Croatia as they are its biggest trade partners. The country is a candidate for membership in the [[European Union]].  During the accession, it is expected that agricultural policy will be the biggest stumbling block, as with other recent applicant countries.

By early 2005, the foreign debt of the Government declined in growth, and was surpassed in size by the foreign debt of the banking sector, prompting further interventions by the [[Croatian National Bank|national bank]]. As of late 2007, the unemployment rate is 9.6%.&lt;ref name = &quot;bwhuxz&quot;/&gt;

'''Transport in Croatia''' relies on several main modes, including [[Transportation|transport]] by road, rail, water and air. Road transport incorporates a comprehensive network of state, county and local routes augmented by a network of highways for long-distance travelling. Water transport can be divided into sea, based on the ports of [[Rijeka]], [[Ploče]], [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[Zadar]], and river transport, based on [[Sava]], [[Danube]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Drava]]. [[Croatia]] has 68 airports, five of which are international. The country also has several airlines, of which the most notable is [[Croatia Airlines]]. Rail transport is fairly developed, with dual track and electrification not very common, although high-speed tilting trains are used on some routes. However, bus still tends to be more common than rail as a mode of inter-city transport.

==Airports==
There are international [[airport]]s in [[Zagreb Airport|Zagreb]], [[Zadar Airport|Zadar]], [[Split Airport|Split]], [[Dubrovnik Airport|Dubrovnik]] and [[Rijeka Airport|Rijeka]] (on the island of [[Krk]]). Recently, [[Osijek Airport]] in [[Slavonia]] has been renovated for regional traffic. It is also being considered to revitalize the [[Pula Airport]] ([[Istria]]) as a destination for low cost airlines.

Currently, the following low cost airlines are flying to Croatia: [[EasyJet]], [[Flyglobespan]], [[Germanwings]], [[TUIfly]], [[Ryanair]], [[Thomson Airways|Thomson]] and [[Wizz Air]]. Major established companies that fly to Croatia include the domestic [[Croatia Airlines]] (member of the [[Star Alliance]]), [[Lufthansa]] and [[British Airways]]. There only seasonal intercontinental flights from and to Croatia.

In September 2008, the U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) assessed the Government of Croatia's Civil Aviation Authority as not being in compliance with [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Croatia's air carrier operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1095.html | work = Travel.State.Gov | title = Croatia - Country Specific Information | publisher = [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]] | accessdate = 2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the country had a IASA Category 2 rating and that Croatian air carriers were not authorized to establish direct flights from Croatia to the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=10293&amp;print=go | title = FAA Finds Croatia Does Not Meet ICAO Safety Standards | publisher = [[Federal Aviation Administration]] | date = 2008-09-25 | accessdate = 2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2011, the FAA announced that Croatia complies with the standards and upgraded it to Category 1 rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = | http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=12337 | title = FAA Raises Safety Rating for Croatia | publisher = Federal Aviation Administration | date = 2011-01-26 | accessdate = 2011-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rail transport==
{{Main|Croatian Railways}}

There are several [[major]] [[railway]] routes in the country:
* from Zagreb to [[Vinkovci]] (and on to [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]])
* from Zagreb to [[Osijek]] via [[Koprivnica]] (but still faster via the southern line, changing at [[Strizivojna]]&amp;ndash;[[Vrpolje]])
* from Zagreb to [[Rijeka]]
* from Zagreb to [[Split (city)|Split]]
There are also other routes to [[Slovenia]], [[Hungary]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Serbia]].

The railways need to be modernized because since the disintegration of [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] there have been hardly any investment in railway infrastructure. Many important routes are not electrified and are only single track traffic around 'bends'. Some improvements have been made in the last ten years. A result of this has been an increase in the maximum speed on the railway line on the [[Pan-European Corridor X]], from the Slovenian border via Zagreb, Novska, Vinkovci to the Serbian border. In places the line's speed limit has been raised from {{convert|80|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on|sp=on}} to {{convert|120|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on|sp=on}}, and plans have been made to raise this further to {{convert|160|km/h|mph|-1|abbr=on|sp=on}} on certain sections. The railway line of the [[Pan-European Corridor Vb]], from the Hungarian border via Koprivnica, Zagreb, Karlovac to the seaport of Rijeka has a slow section through [[Gorski Kotar]], which is planned to undergo a major overhaul. The railway line of the [[Pan-European Corridor Vc]], from the Hungarian border via Beli Manastir, Osijek, Đakovo or Vinkovci, Slavonski Šamac, to the Bosnian border, is also being modernised, the aim is to allow speeds of up to 160&amp;nbsp;km/h along the entire length.

The official rail speed record in Croatia is {{convert|181|km/h|abbr=on}}. This is just below the official 200&amp;nbsp;km/h high speed rail definition. This speed is never reached in regular service. Croatia does have a [[locomotive class]] capable of this speed, and during the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] era there were plans for 'high speed' rail. The increasingly elderly high-speed rolling stock has had its speed limited to 120&amp;nbsp;km/h for safety reasons.

Recently [[Croatian Railways]] introduced a series of modern [[tilting train]]s produced by the German branch of [[Bombardier Transportation]]. They usually deployed on the mountainous route between the two largest Croatian cities, [[Zagreb]] and [[Split (city)|Split]]. Although they can sometimes be found on [[InterCity]] routes in the continental part of the country. The trains on the Zagreb-Split route offer passengers a more comfortable and quicker journey. The previous service used to take 9 hours, whereas the tilting trains take no more than 5.5 hours. There are plans to expand the [[tilting train]] service since they turned out to be very profitable on longer routes.

Croatian Railways aims to revitalize rail traffic through further improvements. Thus, establishing rail as serious competitor to the car, particularly during the busy the summer months.

Croatian Railways' plan to build their first [[high-speed railway]] service is progressing. Construction of an entirely new line from [[Karlovac]] to [[Rijeka]], and reconstruction of the line from the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] border to Karlovac should have originally begun in the Fall of 2007. The line is going to be entirely electrified and in order to speed up the journey even more shall be {{convert|269|km|mi|0|sp=on|abbr=on}} long from end to end, {{convert|61|km|mi|0|sp=on|abbr=on}} shorter than the existing line. The journey from [[Zagreb]] to [[Rijeka]] will be cut to one hour compared to 4 hours with the existing track. The line is intended to carry the increasing amount of goods that enter Europe, at the Croatian port of [[Rijeka]] and are then transported to desinations across central and [[eastern Europe]]. The plans have originally foreseen 2008-2010 as the date for completion. Due to the [[Global financial crisis of 2008–2009|world economic crisis]], building start date is prolonged to an yet undefined date. The project plans have been drawn, however.

[[Pan-European Corridor X]] is going to be upgraded to higher speed sometime in the future. Possibly by building a new high capacity connection line from [[Sisak]] via [[Kutina]] to [[Lipovljani]]. The line should allow for speeds of up to 250&amp;nbsp;km/h.

'''Statistics:'''

Railway length (as of 2006):
* total: {{convert|2726|km|mi|0|sp=on|abbr=on}}
* standard gauge, {{RailGauge|1435mm}}: {{convert|2726|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|1199|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=s}} electrified)

== Road transport ==
[[File:Držićeva av. - pumpa.jpg|thumb|A [[gas station]] in [[Zagreb]]]]
From the time of [[Napoleon]] and building [[Lujzijana]], the road transport in Croatia has significantly improved, topping most European countries. Croatian [[highway]]s are widely regarded as being one of the most modern and safe in Europe.&lt;ref name=openeurope&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the largest part of the Croatian motorway and expressway system (''autoceste'' and ''brze ceste'', resp.)  has been recently constructed, and further construction is continuing.

A major reason for the motorway construction &quot;mania&quot; of the 2000s is that in the last 20 years of Yugoslav Communist rule, during which Croatia formed part of the [[SFRY|former Yugoslavia]], no major projects had been realized. When Croatia declared independence in 1991, the only true motorways in the country were [[Zagreb]]&amp;ndash;[[Karlovac]] ([[A1 (Croatia)|A1]]) and Zagreb-[[Slavonski Brod]] ([[A3 (Croatia)|A3]]), the latter being part of the [[highway &quot;Bratstvo i jedinstvo&quot;]]. This highway was later extended, and today it connects Zagreb to Croatian borders with both [[Serbia]] (near [[Lipovac, Croatia|Lipovac]]) and [[Slovenia]] (near [[Bregana]]). The dream to connect the two largest Croatian cities [[Zagreb]] and [[Split (city)|Split]] with a motorway (''autocesta'') went back to the times of the [[Croatian Spring]]. However, the construction of this project has always been blocked by the ruling [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|Communist Party]]. Recently, after so many years of waiting, this long awaited dream has been realized, and now the Zagreb-Split motorway is a reality. There is also a motorway from Zagreb to Rijeka, as well as a motorway from Zagreb to the northeast (Hungarian border) as well as a motorway from Zagreb to the northwest (Slovenian border).

As of 2007, the construction of eleven different motorways is planned of which two: [[A3 (Croatia)|A3]] (Bregana-Zagreb-Slavonski Brod-Serbian border) and [[A2 (Croatia)|A2]] (Zagreb-Krapina-Macelj) are completed, one ([[A4 (Croatia)|A4]]: Zagreb-Varaždin-Hungarian border) only lacks a connection to state borders, three [[A6 (Croatia)|A6]] (Zagreb-Rijeka) [[B8 (Croatia)|B8]] and [[B9 (Croatia)|B9]] ([[Istrian Y]]) are completed but have to be upgraded from ''[[semi-highway]]'' status, one, the A1. The long awaited &quot;Dalmatina&quot; between  Zagreb and Split is planned to extend until  [[Dubrovnik]], three are in initial stages of development, and construction of one [[A11 (Croatia)|A11]] has yet to start.&lt;!-- OUTDATED --&gt;

The initial setup was made under the first [[Croatian Democratic Union|HDZ]] government which contracted [[Bechtel Corporation]]; this was later replaced by the effort of the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|SDP]]-led government effort led by [[Radimir Čačić]]; and then continued by the HDZ government under [[Ivo Sanader]].
While the pace of development accelerates, so do [[environmentalism|environmental]] concerns, and concerns relating to the use and abuse of [[eminent domain]] by institutions involved in them.
Especially criticized was the A11 Zagreb-Sisak, suspected  of being politically motivated and inefficiently built.
At the contrary, Zagreb-Split trait construction enjoyed a constant support from Croatian public and its on-schedule  completion was marked with enormous joy and pride all through the country.

[[Tourism]] is of major importance for the Croatian economy, and most tourists come to vacation in Croatia in their own cars. Without adequate roads, the traffic would get rather jammed during the summer months. For this reason, and as a means for stimulating urgently needed economic growth, highways have become indispensable for the sustainable development of this country. Croatia already has a considerable highway density for a country that still has to cope with the consequences of [[Communism]] and the [[war in Croatia|recent war]].

As of 2006, Croatia has {{convert|28344|km|sp=us}} of roads. Out of these, there are {{convert|23979|km|abbr=on}} of paved and {{convert|4365|km|abbr=on}} of unpaved roadways

===Traffic laws===
The [[traffic sign]]s adhere to the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]].

The general [[speed limit]]s are:
* in inhabited areas 50&amp;nbsp;km/h
* outside of inhabited areas 90&amp;nbsp;km/h
* on marked expressways 110&amp;nbsp;km/h
* on marked motorways 130&amp;nbsp;km/h

In 2004, a controversial new traffic law was introduced, which provides for drastic safety measures for drunken or dangerous driving: it reduced the blood alcohol limit to 0‰ of alcohol in blood. In 2008 this law was reversed to 0.05‰ of alcohol in blood.

Some of the more technical safety measures include that all new Croatian [[tunnel]]s have modern safety equipment and there are several control centers, which monitor highway traffic.

===Motorways===

{{main|Motorways in Croatia}}

Motorways ({{lang-hr|Autocesta}}, plural {{lang-hr|autoceste}})in Croatia applies to dual carriageway roads with at least two [[traffic lanes]] in each driving direction and an [[emergency lane]]. Direction [[road sign]]s at Croatian motorways have green background with white lettering similar to the Swiss [[Autobahn]]. The designations of motorways are &quot;A&quot; and the motorway number.

The list of completed motorways is as follows (see individual articles for further construction plans and status):

*'''[[A1 (Croatia)|A1]]''', [[Zagreb]] - [[Bosiljevo 2 interchange|Bosiljevo]] - [[Split (city)|Split]] - Ravča ([[European route E71|E71]], [[European route E65|E65]])
*'''[[A2 (Croatia)|A2]]''', [[Zagreb]] - [[Krapina]] - [[Macelj]] ([[European route E59|E59]])
*'''[[A3 (Croatia)|A3]]''', [[Bregana]] - [[Zagreb]] - [[Lipovac, Croatia|Lipovac]] ([[European route E70|E70]])
** Toll-free '''[[Zagreb bypass]]''' is included in A3
*'''[[A4 (Croatia)|A4]]''', [[Goričan]] - [[Varaždin]]/[[Čakovec]] - [[Zagreb]] ([[European route E71|E71]])
**Toll charged only north of [[Sveta Helena]] (end of [[Zagreb bypass]])
*'''[[A5 (Croatia)|A5]]''', [[Osijek]] - [[Đakovo]] - [[Sredanci]] ([[European route E73|E73]])
*'''[[A6 (Croatia)|A6]]''', [[Bosiljevo 2 interchange|Bosiljevo]] - [[Rijeka]] ([[European route E65|E65]])
*'''[[A7 (Croatia)|A7]]''', [[Rupa, Croatia|Rupa]] - [[Rijeka]] bypass ([[European route E61|E61]])
*'''[[A9 (Croatia)|A9]]''', [[Kanfanar]] - [[Pula]] ([[European route E751|E751]])
*'''[[A11 (Croatia)|A11]]''', [[Velika Gorica]] - Buševec

Toll is charged on most [[Croatian motorways]], the only exceptions are the [[Zagreb bypass]] and [[Rijeka bypass]]. Payment in [[Croatian kuna|kuna]], all major credit cards and [[euro]]s are accepted at all toll gates. Most motorways are covered by the [[closed toll collection]] system, where a driver receives a ticket at the entrance gates and pays at the exit gates according to the number of sections travelled. [[Open toll collection]] is used on some bridges and tunnels and short stretches of tolled highway, where drivers immediately pay the toll upon arriving. Various forms of prepaid [[electronic toll collection]] systems are in place which allow quicker collection of toll, usually at a discounted rate, as well as use of dedicated toll plaza lanes (for ''ENC system'' of the electronic toll collection).

All heavily traveled routes towards [[Slovenia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Serbia]] are motorway connections, and almost all parts of Croatia are now easy to reach using motorways.

The 380&amp;nbsp;km long motorway A1 [[Zagreb]] - [[Split (city)|Split]] connects the continental part of Croatia with Mediterranean [[Dalmatia]]. It is complete with two lanes in both directions in its full length. The highway winds itself as a panoramic road through the Croatian hills. The highway currently ends near the [[Ploče]] sea port, but is planned to continue further on to [[Dubrovnik]].

The most important edifice on the A1 is the [[Sveti Rok Tunnel]] (5.687&amp;nbsp;m), which goes through the famous [[Velebit]] mountain range barrier. The most modern, and at the same time the longest Croatian tunnel, is also along the A1: the [[Mala Kapela Tunnel]] (length 5,780&amp;nbsp;m), which passes through the [[Mala Kapela]] mountain range.

Since June 2005 the [[Istrian Y]] extends from the Slovenian border in [[Istria]] and the A7 connects Slovenia to [[Rijeka]]. The A2 connection between [[Zagreb]] via [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] to [[Maribor]] was completed in May 2007.

Motorway A3 extends from Slovenia via the [[Zagreb bypass]] through the length of [[Slavonia]] to the [[Serbia]]n border. In Slavonia there is now another motorway, A5, along the [[European route E73]] (European north-south corridor Vc) between the [[Hungary|Hungarian border]] at [[Beli Manastir]], [[Osijek]] and the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian border]]. This route will eventually continue as a modern motorway towards [[Sarajevo]] and further on to the Croatian sea port of [[Ploče]].

The A4 connection from Zagreb to [[Varaždin]] and [[Čakovec]] exists since 2003, which was extended to the Hungarian border in October 2008 to complete the upgrade of the [[European route E71]]. The A6 route between [[Rijeka]] and [[Zagreb]] was constructed as an expressway in spring 2004, and upgraded to a full motorway in October 2008, thus upgrading the Croatian section of the [[European route E65]]. Together these two upgrades completed the European north-south corridor Vb.

A motorway connection of [[Zagreb]] to the important industrial city of [[Sisak]] is planned to be constructed as [[A11 (Croatia)|A11]].

Significant tunnel and bridge construction projects in the south of Dalmatia are planned, such as the [[Biokovo]] tunnel near [[Makarska]], which will connect the panoramic seashore road with the future A1, and a {{convert|2374|m|ft|0|sp=on|abbr=on}} long [[Pelješac bridge]], connecting the [[Pelješac]] peninsula to the Croatian mainland.

By 2008, numerous service areas and petrol stations had been constructed along all Croatian motorways. All Croatian motorways are equipped with enclosed service areas with gas stations and parking. Many areas have restaurants and children's playgrounds.

===Expressways===
{{main|Expressways in Croatia}}

The term ''brza cesta'' or [[expressway]] refers to roads specifically designated as such by legislation and marked with appropriate [[limited-access road]] traffic signs. The expressways may comprise two or more traffic lanes, while they normally do not have emergency lanes.

''Polu-autocesta'' or ''[[semi-highway]]'' refers to a two-lane, undivided road running on one roadway of a motorway while the other is in construction. By legal definition, all semi-highways are expressways.

The expressway routes in Croatia usually correspond to a state road (see below) and are marked a &quot;D&quot; followed by a number. The &quot;E&quot; numbers are designations of [[European route]]s.

===Major roads===
{{Main|State roads in Croatia}}

Major roads that aren't part of the motorway system are ''državne ceste'' (state routes). They are marked with the letter D and the road's number.

The most traveled state routes in Croatia are:
* '''[[D1 (Croatia)|D1]]''', connects [[Zagreb]] and Split via [[Lika]] - passes through [[Karlovac]], [[Slunj]], [[Plitvice]], [[Korenica]], [[Knin]], [[Sinj]].
* '''[[D2 (Croatia)|D2]]''', connects [[Varaždin]] and [[Osijek]] via [[Podravina]] - passes through [[Koprivnica]], [[Virovitica]], [[Slatina, Croatia|Slatina]], [[Našice]].
* '''[[D8 (Croatia)|D8]]''', connects [[Rijeka]] and [[Dubrovnik]], widely known as ''[[Jadranska magistrala]]'' and part of [[European route E65|E65]] - runs along the coastline and connects many cities on the coast, including [[Crikvenica]], [[Senj]], [[Zadar]], [[Šibenik]], [[Trogir]], [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Omiš]], [[Makarska]] and [[Ploče]].

Since the construction of [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]] motorway beyond [[Gorski kotar]] started, D1 and D8 are much less used.

These routes are monitored by Croatian roadside assistance because they connect important locations. Like all state routes outside major cities, they are only two-lane arterials and do not support heavy traffic. All state routes are routinely maintained by Croatian road authorities. The road sign for a state route has a blue background and the route's designation in white. State routes have one, two or three-digit numbers.

===Minor roads===
Secondary routes are known as county roads. They are marked with signs with yellow background and road number. These roads' designations are rarely used, but usually marked on regional maps if these roads are shown. Formally, their designation is the letter Ž and the number. County roads have four-digit numbers.

The least known are the so-called local roads. Their designations are never marked on maps or by roadside signs and as such are virtually unknown to public. Their designations consist of the letter L and a five-digit number.

=== Bus traffic ===
In contrast to the fairly underdeveloped rail traffic, [[bus]]es represent the most-accepted, cheapest and widely-used means of public transport. National bus traffic is very well developed and it is very easy to reach even the remotest parts of Croatia by bus. Almost all buses on national routes are air-conditioned and offer pleasant traveling comfort. The Croatian parliament has passed a law that no bus should be older than 12 years - however, this decision is currently frozen because of the high cost for bus operators.

In practice, bus fares are collected on the bus while traveling, which is sometimes even cheaper than when paying at the ticket office (there is an additional fee for stored luggage) and sometimes a &quot;ticket office fee&quot;.

From Croatia, there are many international bus routes to the neighboring countries ([[Slovenia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]] etc.), as well as to Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Switzerland and to other European countries. International buses correspond to European standards.

[[Zagreb]] has the largest and most modern bus terminal in Croatia. It is located near the downtown in [[Trnje, Zagreb|Trnje]] district on the [[Marin Držić Avenue]]. It sports specially designed waiting areas above the bus stopping and parking area. The Zagreb bus terminal is close to the central train station, Glavni kolodvor and it is easy to reach by [[tram]] lines and by car.

==Water transport==
===Sea transport===
Croatia has several large [[seaport]]s. The largest seaport with the deepest channel to a port in the Adriatic is [[Rijeka]] on the northern Croatian coast, followed by [[Ploče]] in southern Dalmatia. The port of Ploče is of strategic importance for the industries of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The largest Croatian passenger port is [[Split (city)|Split]] in [[Dalmatia]], also called ''gateway to the islands'', followed by [[Zadar]]. There are 66 inhabited islands along the Croatian coast which means there is a large number of local ferry connections.

'''Ports and harbors:'''
* major transport seaports: [[Omišalj]], [[Ploče]], [[Rijeka]], [[Šibenik]]
* other seaports: [[Dubrovnik]], [[Dugi Rat]], [[Pula, Croatia|Pula]], [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Zadar]]
* inland waterway ports: [[Vukovar]] (on [[Danube]]), [[Sisak]] (on [[Sava]]), [[Slavonski Brod]] ([[Sava]] river), [[Zupanja]] ([[Sava]] river), [[Osijek]] ([[Drava]] river)

[[Merchant marine]] (as of 2005):
* ''total:'' 73 ships ({{GRT|1,000|first=yes}} or over) totaling {{GRT|750,579}}/{{DWT|1,178,786|metric|first=yes}}
* ''ships by type:''
** [[bulk carrier]] 25
** cargo 12
** [[chemical tanker]] 2
** passenger/cargo 25
** [[oil tanker|petroleum tanker]] 4
** refrigerated cargo 1
** roll on/roll off 4
** foreign-owned ships registered here as a [[flag of convenience]]: 1
*** Denmark 1
** registered in other countries: 31

An extensive system of ferries, operated by [[Jadrolinija]], serves Croatia's many islands and links coastal cities. Ferry services to Italian cities of [[Venice]], [[Ancona]], [[Pescara]] and [[Bari]] from around a dozen of Croatian sea ports, most notably [[Rovinj]], [[Rijeka]], [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Korčula]] and [[Dubrovnik]], is available on a daily or weekly basis. From April to September the schedule is more dense and can include several round trips within a day.

===River transport===
Croatia is also on the important [[Danube]] waterway, which connects Eastern and Central Europe. The major Danube port is [[Vukovar]].

Perennially navigable rivers:
* [[Danube]] (section from Batina to Ilok which is in Croatia)
* [[Sava]] - from [[Rugvica]] until it exits Croatia near Gunja. The most upstream port is in [[Sisak]].
Total [[waterway]] length (as of 2004): 785&amp;nbsp;km

== Pipelines ==
As of 2004:
* [[natural gas|gas]]: 1,340&amp;nbsp;km
* [[petroleum|oil]]: 583&amp;nbsp;km

Major pipeline operators are [[Jadranski naftovod]] and [[Plinacro]].

'''Croatian military''' is officially called '''[[Armed forces|Armed Forces]] of the [[Croatia|Republic of Croatia]]''' ({{lang-hr|Oružane snage Republike Hrvatske}} - OSRH) and it consists of three branches:

* [[Croatian Army]] (''Hrvatska kopnena vojska'')
* [[Croatian Navy]] (''Hrvatska ratna mornarica'')
* [[Croatian Air Force and Defense]] (''Hrvatsko ratno zrakoplovstvo i protuzračna obrana'')

==Strength==

The total number of active military personal in Croatian Armed Forces stands at 18,400 and additionally there are 1600 civilians working in various service branches of the armed forces.. 

*HQ/support/services personal account for 3000 service personal,
*Navy 1800 serviceman,
*Air Force 2000 serviceman,
*Army 12,000 service personal (includes 2000 Volunteers)
*1600 civilians
*Total 20,400 personal (this number is not inclusive of 6000 first level alert reservist)

Total available male manpower aged 16–49 number 1,035,712, of which 771,323 are technically fit for military service. Male citizens are now no longer subject to [[compulsory military service]] since January 1, 2008. However, the last generation of 2007 [[Soldier|servicemen]] was also absolved of compulsory service by an act from then Minister of Defense [[Berislav Rončević]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacional.hr/articles/view/39029 Nema više obveznog vojnog roka – NACIONAL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Budget==
The Croatian [[military budget]] for the past 6–7 years was kept below 2% of GDP, a vast difference from the 1990s when defense expenditure represented a major stake in Croatian Budgetary expenditure due to the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. For example, 1995 Croatian defense budget stood at 12.4 billion [[Croatian Kuna]] or just over 12% of GDP, which was also the highest defense expenditure ever.

Defense Expenditures in recent years (example years - source Croatian MOD);
*2006: 4.20 billion Croatian Kuna - 1.67% of GDP
*2007: 4.63 billion Croatian Kuna - 1.69% of GDP
*2008: 5.35 billion Croatian Kuna - 1.79% of GDP
*2009: 5.11 billion Croatian Kuna - 1.52% of GDP
*2010: 4.81 billion Croatian Kuna - 1.45% of GDP
*2011: 5.03 billion Croatian Kuna - 1.46% of GDP (projected)

According to the 2006-2015 long-term defense plan the country's military expenditures were set to rise to 1.80% of [[GDP]] in 2008, to 1.85% in 2009 and finally to remain steady at 2.00% from 2010 onwards as suggested by [[NATO]]. However, due to the economic crisis, expenditures for 2009 were kept well bellow the envisaged level.

According to government's economic plans for the 2010-2012 period, Croatian military expenditures are to remain somewhere around 1.35-1.40%. This would have meant that [[Croatia]] would have spent the least amount of money on its armed forces in its own history. Because of this sharp fall, there was concern about postponements or even cancellation of many modernization projects.

Again, however, contrary to expectations, the military expenditure for 2011 was instead raised up to 4.96 billions kuna, +4.6% more than the previous year, slightly more of 1,5% of [GDP].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnevno.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/vojska_ce_najvise_novaca_utopiti_u_novi_oklopnjak_i_nove_jurisne_puske/162417.html]&lt;!--Army will spent most of its budget in new armored vehicles and assault rifles--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

It have also to be noted that the parallel completion of the planned process of military personnel downsizing, would hopefully allow a sensibly more efficient allocation of monetary resources.

==Defence reforms==

The Croatian government has implemented series of defence reforms with several important goals. These goals are meant to reduce the number of personnel serving in the military. By 2010, the Croatian military will have 20,400 military personnel including 1600 civilian personnel.
* Plans to reduce the number of servicemen and non-combat personnel;
** Plans to cut the army from its current number of 16,000 personnel to 12,000 personnel.
** Plans to cut the number of Air Force personnel to 2,000 from the current number of 2,700.
** Plans to cut the number of Naval personnel to around 1,800. (implemented)
** Reserve status personnel to be cut from 32,000 to 6,000 by 2010.
** Introduction of professional and voluntary service. (implemented)

'''''Force 2010:'''''

*[[Croatian Army]]: 10,000 + 2000 volunteers,
*[[Croatian Navy]]: 1,800
*[[Croatian Air Force]]: 2,000
*Support/logistics/Special Forces and HQ: 3,000
*Total active military personnel: 18,800
*Civilians: 1,600

==Commander==
The [[Commander-in-Chief]] of all Croatian armed forces in peace and war is the [[President of Croatia|President of the Republic]]. The Commander-in-Chief prescribes the organization of the Croatian Armed Forces at the proposal of the Chief of General Staff, with consent of the Minister of Defence.

The Armed Forces consist of peacetime and wartime component. The peacetime component is composed of active military [[officer (military)|officers]], [[civil servant]]s and employees in the Croatian Armed Forces, cadets, and [[conscription|conscripts]] serving a 6-month national service and reservists when on military exercise. The wartime component of the Armed Forces is additionally composed of all other reservists.

[[Croatian General Staff|The General Staff]] is part of the [[Ministry of Defense (Croatia)|Ministry of Defense]] in charge of commanding, training and use of the Armed Forces. It also has a number of units under its direct command, including the [[Special Operations Battalion (Croatia)|Special Operations Battalion]], Honor Guard Battalion and several others.

In peace, the Commander-in-Chief exercises his command through the Minister of Defense. In war and in cases where the Minister of Defense is not fulfilling orders, the Commander-in-Chief exercises his command directly through the General Staff Commander.

The [[Croatian Parliament]] exercises democratic control over the Armed Forces by adopting defense strategy, defense budget and defense laws.

==Special Forces and Honour Guard==
[[Special Operations Battalion]] ({{lang-hr|Bojna za specijalna djelovanja}} or BSD) was founded on September 8, 2000 with merging of the Special Combat Skills Center and some personnel from the 1st Croatian Guard Brigade (1. Hrvatski Gardijski Zdrug). The Battalion has 300 men. Today, it is one of the most elite units of the Croatian military, as well as being one of the best trained and equipped special forces units in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;http://www.morh.hr/katalog/documents/dpr_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Croatian General Staff]] exercises direct command over the battalion which thus elevated the unit to strategic level for quicker reaction and overall better and faster tactical and strategic situations. Also, this means that members of all three branches of the Croatian armed forces can apply for selection.

Other special operations units are Military Intelligence Battalion (''Vojno-obavještajna bojna'' or ''VOB'') and Special Military Police Company (''Satnija specijalne vojne policije'' or SSVP).

Duties of Honour Guard are performed by ''Počasno zaštitna bojna'' (300 men), located at [[Zagreb]] in Tuškanac military base.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

==Projects==
Government plans to substantially modernize the Armed Forces at a cost of 4.0 billion USD (2007–2015). The modernization calls for a complete revamp of the armed forces so that it can face all the challenges of the 21st century.

Proposed Defence Programs and updates/upgrades:

===Army===

* Procurement of 126 [[Patria AMV]] 8x8 Modular APC/IFV - 850 million kuna (additional 120-150 vehicles might be ordered after 2012)
*Procurement of 94 [[Iveco LMV]] (Light Multi-role Vehicles) at cost of 220 million kuna. The army might purchase additional LMVs once more funds become available. Around 250-300 LMVs are needed.
* Procurement of advanced artillery systems, up to 24x 155&amp;nbsp;mm self-propelled howitzers are to be purchased before 2015 to replace obsolete [[2S1]] self-propelled howitzers, however the program is on the back burner as there are more important defense programs; procurement of new howitzers might need to be postponed for a few years. Swedish [[Bofors]] [[ARCHER Artillery System]] and German [[PzH 2000]] are most likely candidates for this program. Cost of program - 1.2 billion kuna.
* Procurement of 550 5-ton army trucks, 200 7.5-ton military trucks and 300 4WD vehicles - program is in a full swing and first batch of [[MAN SE|MAN]] (150), [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] (30) and [[Iveco]] (50) military trucks was delivered. Croatian Army also ordered large numbers of new 4WD vehicles, [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes-Benz G-Class]] - 120, [[Land Rover Wolf]] - 60, [[Toyota Land Cruiser]] - 50, [[Nissan Navara]] - 50, got delivered in 2005-2007. Cost of program - 570-580 million kuna.
* Modernization of [[M-84|M-84A]] and [[M-84|M-84A4 Snajper]] MBTs and upgrade to [[M-84D]] and [[M-95 Degman]] standard. Program calls for an upgrade and modernization of 75 existing tanks and procurement of additional 29 new tanks over next 4 years due to a plan which requires Croatia to operate at least 104 modern tanks before 2015. Cost of program - 850 million kuna.
*Introduction of new 5.56&amp;nbsp;mm [[NATO]] standard VHS assault rifle. Cost of program - 200 million kuna (20,000 rifles with day/night sights and grenade launchers)
*Scores of smaller programs, communication equipment, night vision capability, electronic sensors, NBC equipment, battlefield management systems and modernization of artillery systems with new sights and electronic fire control systems.

===Air Force===

* Procurement of 10-12 [[Mi-171|Mi-171Sh]] transport helicopters and all associated spare parts and equipment. Helicopters are equipped up to a NATO standards with mostly western avionics. Cost of Program - 380 million kuna, paid for in form of Russian debt to Croatia.
* Procurement of 5 [[Zlin 142|Zlin 242L]] basic trainers. Cost of program - 10 million Croatian kuna.
* Procurement of Advanced short to medium range [[NATO]] [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] systems and modernization of existing Russian-made Igla SAMs. Croatia needs 12 Short to medium range SAM batteries (radar/command vehicles + 2 luncher vehicles). Cost of program - 700-850 million kuna.
* Procurement of modern jet fighters, Croatia plans to modernize its air force with the introduction of 12 multirole fighters. In the competition are [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen]], [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], [[Dassault Rafale]], [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] and [[Mikoyan MiG-35]].&lt;ref name=Saab&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/04/17/223048/saab-details-gripen-proposal-to-croatia.html Saab details Gripen proposal to Croatia] by Dino Kucic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gloom&gt;[http://www.airfleet.ru/arhiv/n4_2009/fighters_-_from_boom_to_gloom1/ Fighters - from boom to gloom?]&lt;/ref&gt; Program might be postponed for a year or two as a result of ongoing global economic crisis and recent decision that CAF needs at least 18-24 fighters to effectively patrol Croatian airspace. As an interim solution, additional 6-7 [[MiG-21]]s stored back in 2003 might be modernized and reinstated into service in 2009. Cost of fighter procurement program - 5 billion kuna.
* Modern radar network. New modern radar network was put in to use in 2007 - [[AN/FPS-117]] radar network consisting of 5 radar stations across Croatia. Cost of program - 1800 million Croatian kuna, program was initiated in 1998 and paid for by Croatian MOD in 1999.
* Procurement of 2 additional Canadair [[CL-415]] fire bombers and 5 [[Air Tractor AT-802]] - cost of program - 450 million kuna. It has to be noted that this procurement wasn't planned and money was acquired from a surplus in the national budget.
* Additional programs are also being considered, additional utility, ASW, SAR and police helicopters as well as few medium transport aircraft for the needs of several peacekeeping operations.

===Navy===

Navy plans are still being worked on but present plans call for a medium expansion of the naval force.

* 10 new [[patrol boat]]s, locally built, 40 meters in length. Cost of program 500 million kuna.
* 4 new [[corvettes]] - 88–120 meters in length. Cost of program 3000 million kuna.
* Overhaul of existing 2 ''King'' class [[fast attack craft]]s, including new engines. Cost of program - 40 million kuna.
* Upgrading [[RBS-15]] missiles to latest standard. - Cost of program - 120 million kuna.

===Programs under revision===

* [[BVP M-80]]A - Program is at the standstill and might no longer receive any upgrades, Croatian MOD stated, that it will replace its M80's with the modern western [[IFV]] when funds become available. Most likely contender for this program is [[Patria AMV]] in IFV configuration.

==International cooperation==
On April 1, 2009 [[Croatia]] joined [[NATO]] and is also an official candidate country to become the 28th member of the [[European Union]]. The Croatian Armed Forces participate in many ([[military]]) aspects of both organizations as well as actively participate in many [[UN]] peacekeeping operations worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following page shows the '''foreign relations of Croatia''' from past history, current events, international disputes and foreign support.

{{Politics of Croatia}}

==History==
[[Croatia]]n [[foreign policy]] has focused on greater [[Euro-Atlantic]] integration, mainly entering the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]. In order to gain access to European and [[Transatlantic relations|trans-Atlantic]] institutions, it has had to undo many negative effects of the breakup of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and the war that ensued, and improve and maintain good relations with its neighbors.

Key issues over the last decade have been the implementation of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]] and the [[Erdut#Erdut During the War|Erdut Agreement]], nondiscriminatory facilitation of the return of [[refugee]]s and [[displaced person]]s from the 1991-95 war including property restitution for ethnic [[Serbs]], resolution of border disputes with [[Slovenia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]], and general [[Democracy|democratization]].

Croatia has had an uneven record in these areas between 1996 and 1999 during the [[right-wing]] [[Croatian Democratic Union|HDZ]] government, inhibiting its relations with the European Union and the U.S. Improvement in these areas severely hindered the advance of Croatia's prospects for further Euro-Atlantic integration. Progress in the areas of Dayton, Erdut, and refugee returns were evident in 1998, but progress was slow and required intensive international engagement.

Croatia's unsatisfactory performance implementing broader [[democratic reform]]s in 1998 raised questions about the ruling party's commitment to basic democratic principles and norms. Areas of concern included restrictions on [[freedom of speech]], one-party control of [[Public broadcasting|public TV and radio]], repression of independent media, unfair electoral regulations, a [[judiciary]] that is not fully independent, and lack of [[human rights|human]] and [[civil rights]] protection.

A [[centre-left]] [[coalition government]] was elected in early 2000. The [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|SDP]]-led government slowly relinquished control over public media companies and did not interfere with freedom of speech and independent media, though it didn't complete the process of making [[Croatian Radiotelevision]] independent. Judiciary reforms remained a pending issue as well.

Major Croatian advances in foreign relations during this period have included:
* admittance into NATO's [[Partnership for Peace]] Programme in May 2000
* admittance into [[World Trade Organization]] in July 2000;
* signing a [[European Union Association Agreement|Stabilization and Association Agreement]] with the EU in October 2001
* becoming part of NATO's [[Membership Action Plan]] in May 2002
* becoming a member of the [[Central European Free Trade Agreement]] (CEFTA) in December 2002
* application for membership in the EU in February 2003
* full cooperation with the [[ICTY|Hague Tribunal]] and the beginning of accession negotiations with the EU in October 2005

The EU application was the last major international undertaking of the [[Ivica Račan|Račan]] government, which submitted a 7,000-page report in reply to the questionnaire by the [[European Commission]].

Foreign relations were severely affected by the government's hesitance and stalling of the extradition of Croatian general [[Janko Bobetko]] to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY), and inability to take general [[Ante Gotovina]] into custody for questioning by the Court.

Refugee returns accelerated since 1999, reached a peak in 2000, but then slightly decreased in 2001 and 2002. The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] mission in Croatia has continued to monitor the return of refugees and is still recording civil rights violations. [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]] continue to have problems with
