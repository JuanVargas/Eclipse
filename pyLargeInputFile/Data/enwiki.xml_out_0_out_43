'''Herman Boerhaave''' ([[Voorhout]], 31 December 1668 &amp;ndash; [[Leiden]], 23 September 1738) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]]  botanist, [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[physician]] of European fame. He is regarded as the founder of clinical teaching and of the modern academic [[hospital]]. His main achievement was to demonstrate the relation of symptoms to lesions.
[[Image:Oud poelgeest trekvaart.JPG|thumbnail|right|250px|[[Oud Poelgeest]] Castle, Herman Boerhaave's home in [[Oegstgeest]], near Leiden. This was the site of his outdoor botanical garden that was renowned during his lifetime and rivaled [[Hortus Cliffortianus]], the garden of his friend and sponsor to [[Linnaeus]]. He travelled back and forth to his friend's garden and to the Leiden University by [[trekschuit]].]]

==Life==
He was born at [[Voorhout]] near [[Leiden]]. Entering the [[University of Leiden]] he took his degree in philosophy in 1689, with a dissertation ''De distinctione mentis a corpore'' (on the difference of the mind from the body), in which he attacked the doctrines of [[Epicurus]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]. He then turned to the study of medicine, in which he graduated in 1693 at [[University of Harderwijk|Harderwijk]] in present-day [[Gelderland]]. In 1701 he was appointed lecturer on the institutes of medicine at Leiden; in his inaugural discourse, ''De commendando [[Hippocrates|Hippocratis]] studio'', he recommended to his pupils that great physician as their model.

In 1709 he became professor of [[botany]] and medicine, and in that capacity he did good service, not only to his own university, but also to botanical science, by his improvements and additions to the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|botanic garden of Leiden]], and by the publication of numerous works descriptive of new species of plants. In 1714, when he was appointed rector of the university, he succeeded [[Govert Bidloo]] in the chair of practical medicine, and in this capacity he introduced the modern system of clinical instruction. Four years later he was appointed to the chair of chemistry also. In 1728 he was elected into the [[French Academy of Sciences]], and two years later into the [[Royal Society]] of London. In 1729 declining health obliged him to resign the chairs of chemistry and botany; and he died, after a lingering and painful illness, at Leiden.

His reputation so increased the fame of the University of Leiden, especially as a school of medicine, that it became popular with visitors from every part of Europe. All the princes of Europe sent him pupils, who found in this skillful professor not only an indefatigable teacher, but an affectionate guardian. When [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] went to Holland in 1716 (he was in Holland before in 1697 to instruct himself in maritime affairs), he also took lessons from Boerhaave. [[Linnaeus]] traveled to see him, as did [[Voltaire]]. His reputation was not confined to Europe; a Chinese mandarin sent him a letter addressed to &quot;the illustrious Boerhaave, physician in Europe,&quot; and it reached him in due course. The operating theatre of the University of Leiden in which he once worked as an anatomist is now at the center of a museum named after him; the [[Boerhaave Museum]].
 
Boerhaave first described [[Boerhaave syndrome]], which involves tearing of the esophagus, usually a consequence of vigorous vomiting.  He notoriously described in 1724 the case of Baron Jan von Wassenaer, a Dutch admiral who died of this condition following a gluttonous feast and subsequent regurgitation.&lt;ref&gt;Boerhaave H. Atrocis, nec descripti prius, morbii historia: secundum medicae artis leges conscripta. Leiden, the Netherlands: Lugduni Batavorum Boutesteniana, 1724&lt;/ref&gt;  This condition was uniformly fatal prior to modern surgical techniques allowing repair of the esophagus.

Boerhaave was critical of his [[Netherlands (terminology)#Dutch|Dutch]] contemporary, [[Baruch Spinoza]], attacking him in his dissertation in 1689.

==Personal life==
On 14 September 1710, Boerhaave married Maria Drolenvaux, the daughter of the rich merchant, Alderman Abraham Drolenvaux. They had four children, of whom one daughter, Maria Joanna, lived to adulthood [http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2404.html]. In 1722, he began to suffer from an extreme case of [[gout]], recovering the next year.

'''Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield''', [[Order of the Garter|KG]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], (21 December 1804 – 19 April 1881) was a [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], parliamentarian, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] statesman and literary figure. Starting from comparatively humble origins, he served in government for three decades, twice as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Although his father had him baptised to [[Anglican Communion|Anglicanism]] at age 12, he was nonetheless Britain's first and thus far only Prime Minister who was born into a [[Jew]]ish family—originally from [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Benjamin Disraeli | url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/benjamin-disraeli | accessdate=2009-09-20 | publisher=Number10.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played an instrumental role in the creation of the modern [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] after the [[Corn Laws]] schism of 1846.

Although a major figure in the [[protectionist]] wing of the Conservative Party after 1844, Disraeli's relations with the other leading figures in the party, particularly [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]], the overall leader, were often strained. Not until the 1860s would Derby and Disraeli be on easy terms, and the latter's succession of the former assured. From 1852 onwards, Disraeli's career would also be marked by his often intense rivalry with [[William Ewart Gladstone]], who eventually rose to become leader of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. In this feud, Disraeli was aided by his warm friendship with [[Queen Victoria]], who came to detest Gladstone during the latter's first premiership in the 1870s. In 1876 Disraeli was raised to the [[peerage]] as the Earl of Beaconsfield, capping nearly four decades in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].

Before and during his political career, Disraeli was well-known as a literary and social figure, although his novels are not generally regarded as a part of the Victorian literary [[Western canon|canon]]. He mainly wrote romances, of which ''[[Sybil (novel)|Sybil]]'' and ''[[Vivian Grey]]'' are perhaps the best-known today. He is exceptional among British Prime Ministers for having gained equal social and political renown. He was twice successful as the [[Glasgow University Conservative Association]]'s candidate for [[Rector of the University of Glasgow|Rector of the University]], holding the post for two full terms between 1871 and 1877.

==Early life==
Disraeli's biographers believe he was descended from [[Italy|Italian]] [[Sephardi|Sephardic Jews]]. He claimed [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ancestry, possibly referring to an earlier origin of his family heritage in [[Iberia]] prior to the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of Jews]] in 1492. After this event many Jews emigrated, in two waves; the bulk fled to the Muslim lands of the [[History of the Jews in Turkey|Ottoman Empire]], but many went to Christian Europe, first to northern Italy, then to the Netherlands, and later to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|p=3}}. Norman Gash, reviewing Blake's work, argued that Benjamin's claim to Spanish ancestry could not be entirely dismissed. {{Harv|Gash|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; One modern historian has seen him as essentially a ''[[marrano]]'',&lt;ref&gt;M. C. N. Salbstein, ‘Benjamin Disraeli, Marrano Englishman’, in ''The Emancipation of the Jews in Britain'',  97-114. (New Jersey 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], ''A History of the Jews'', p.323&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the second child and eldest son of [[Isaac D'Israeli]], a literary critic and historian, and Maria Basevi. Benjamin changed the spelling in the 1820s by dropping the apostrophe.&lt;ref&gt;Opponents, however, continued to include the apostrophe in correspondence. [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne|Lord Lincoln]], writing to Sir [[Robert Peel]] in 1846, referred to  &quot;D'Israeli.&quot; {{Harv|Conancher|1958|p=435}}. Peel did so as well, see {{Harvnb|Gash|1972|p=387}}. Even in the 1870s, towards the end of Disraeli's career, this practice continued. See {{Harvnb|Wohl|1995|p=381, ff. 22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His siblings included Sarah (1802–1859), Naphtali (1807), Ralph (1809–1898), and James (1813–1868).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rhind|1993|p=I, 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin at first attended a small school, the Reverend [[St Piran's School|John Potticary's school]] at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rhind|1993|p=I, 157}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father had Benjamin [[baptism|baptised]] in July 1817 following a dispute with their [[Bevis Marks Synagogue|synagogue]]. The elder D'Israeli was content to remain outside organised religion. From 1817, Benjamin attended a school at [[Higham Hill]], in [[Walthamstow]], under [[Eliezer Cogan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Cogan, Eliezer}}&lt;/ref&gt; His younger brothers, in contrast, attended the superior [[Winchester College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Isaac disraeli.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Isaac D'Israeli, father of Benjamin Disraeli]]

His father groomed him for a career in law, and Disraeli was articled to a [[solicitor]] in 1821.  In 1824, Disraeli toured [[Belgium]] and the [[Rhine Valley]] with his father and later wrote that it was while travelling on the [[Rhine]] that he decided to abandon the law: &quot;I determined when descending those magical waters that I would not be a lawyer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to England he speculated on the stock exchange on various South American mining companies. The recognition of the new South American republics on the recommendation of [[George Canning]] had led to a considerable boom, encouraged by various promoters. In this connection, Disraeli became involved with the financier [[John Diston Powles|J. D. Powles]], one such booster. In the course of 1825, Disraeli wrote three anonymous pamphlets for Powles, promoting the companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=24–26}}; {{Harvnb|Veliz|1975|pp=637–663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year Disraeli's financial activities brought him into contact with the publisher [[John Murray (1778–1843)|John Murray]] who was also involved in the South American mines.  Accordingly, they attempted to bring out a newspaper, [[The Representative (newspaper)|''The Representative'']], to promote both the cause of the mines and those politicians who supported the mines, specifically George Canning. The paper was a failure, in part because the mining &quot;bubble&quot; burst in late 1825, which ruined Powles and Disraeli. Also, according to Disraeli's biographer, [[Robert Blake, Baron Blake|Lord Blake]], the paper was &quot;atrociously edited&quot;, and would have failed regardless. Disraeli's debts incurred from this debacle would haunt him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before he entered parliament, Disraeli was involved with several women, most notably Henrietta, Lady Sykes (the wife of [[Sykes Baronets|Sir Francis Sykes, 3rd Bt]]), who served as the model for ''Henrietta Temple''. It was Henrietta who introduced Disraeli to [[John Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst|Lord Lyndhurst]], with whom she later became romantically involved. As Lord Blake observed: &quot;The true relationship between the three cannot be determined with certainty&amp;nbsp;... there can be no doubt that the affair [figurative usage] damaged Disraeli and that it made its contribution, along with many other episodes, to the understandable aura of distrust which hung around his name for so many years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=116–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839 he settled his private life by marrying [[Mary Disraeli, 1st Viscountess Beaconsfield|Mary Anne Lewis]], the rich widow of [[Wyndham Lewis (politician)|Wyndham Lewis]], Disraeli's erstwhile colleague at Maidstone. Mary Lewis was 12 years his senior, and their union was seen as being based on financial interests, but they came to cherish one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary career===
Disraeli turned towards literature after his financial disaster, motivated in part by a desperate need for money, and brought out his first novel, ''[[Vivian Grey]]'', in 1826. Disraeli's biographers agree that ''Vivian Grey'' was a thinly veiled re-telling of the affair of ''The Representative'', and it proved very popular on its release, although it also caused much offence within the [[Tory]] literary world when Disraeli's authorship was discovered. The book, initially anonymous, was purportedly written by a &quot;man of fashion&quot; – someone who moved in high society. Disraeli, then just twenty-three, did not move in high society, and the numerous [[solecism]]s present in his otherwise brilliant and daring work made this painfully obvious.  Reviewers were sharply critical on these grounds of both the author and the book. Furthermore, John Murray believed that Disraeli had caricatured him and abused his confidence–an accusation denied at the time, and by the official biography, although subsequent biographers (notably Blake) have sided with Murray.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Graubard|1967|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Young disraeli.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''A Young Disraeli'' &lt;br /&gt;by [[Francis Grant (artist)|Sir Francis Grant]], 1852]]

After producing a ''[[Vindication of the English Constitution]]'',&lt;ref&gt;See [http://mediotutissimus.blogspot.com/2010/12/vindication-of-english-constitution.html here] for a review and summary&lt;/ref&gt; and some political pamphlets, Disraeli followed up ''Vivian Grey'' with a series of novels, ''[[The Young Duke]]'' (1831), ''[[Contarini Fleming]]'' (1832), ''[[Alroy (Disraeli novel)|Alroy]]'' (1833), ''[[Venetia (Disraeli novel)|Venetia]]'' and ''[[Henrietta Temple]]'' (1837). During the same period he had also written ''[[The Revolutionary Epick]]'' and three [[burlesques]], ''[[Ixion (novel)|Ixion]]'', ''[[The Infernal Marriage]]'', and ''[[Popanilla]]''. Of these only ''Henrietta Temple'' (based on his affair with [[Sykes Baronets|Henrietta Sykes]], wife of [[Sykes Baronets|Sir Francis William Sykes, 3rd Bt]]) was a true success.&lt;ref&gt;For Blake's account of Henrietta Sykes, see {{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=94–119}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1840s Disraeli wrote three political novels collectively known as &quot;the Trilogy&quot;–''[[Sybil (novel)|Sybil]]'', ''[[Coningsby (novel)|Coningsby]]'', and ''[[Tancred (novel)|Tancred]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, pp. 190-191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disraeli's relationships with other male writers of his period were strained or non-existent. After the disaster of ''The Representative'', [[John Gibson Lockhart]] became a bitter enemy and the two never reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cline|1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli's preference for female company prevented the development of contact with those who were otherwise not alienated by his opinions, comportment or background. One contemporary who tried to bridge the gap, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], established a tentative cordial relationship in the late 1840s only to see everything collapse when Disraeli took offence at a burlesque of him which Thackeray penned for ''Punch''. Disraeli took revenge in ''Endymion'' (published in 1880), when he caricatured Thackeray as &quot;St. Barbe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cline|1943}}. This view has been accepted by most historians. See {{Harvnb|Merritt|1968}}, who argues that St. Barbe was an attack on [[Thomas Carlyle]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Disraeli's writing is generally interesting, and his books teem with striking thoughts, shrewd maxims, and brilliant phrases which stick in the memory; on the other hand, he is often artificial, extravagant, and turgid.  Critic [[William Kuhn]] argued that much of his fiction can be read as &quot;the memoirs he never wrote&quot;, revealing the inner life of a politician for whom the norms of Victorian public life appeared to represent a social straitjacket – particularly with regard to his allegedly &quot;ambiguous sexuality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/may/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview26|title=Review of 'The Politics of Pleasure: A Portrait of Benjamin Disraeli', by William Kuhn | work=The Guardian| first=John | last=Dugdale | location=London | date=5 May 2007 | accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parliament==
[[Image:Lord John Manners.jpg|upright|thumb|Lord John Manners, friend of Disraeli, and leading figure in the [[Young England]] movement]]
Disraeli had been considering a political career as early as 1830, before he departed England for the [[Mediterranean]]. His first real efforts, however, did not come until 1832, during the great crisis over the [[Reform Bill of 1832|Reform Bill]], when he contributed to an anti-[[British Whig Party|Whig]] pamphlet edited by [[John Wilson Croker]] and published by Murray entitled ''England and France: or a cure for Ministerial Gallomania''. The choice of a Tory publication was regarded as odd by Disraeli's friends and relatives, who thought him more of a [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]]. Indeed, Disraeli had objected to Murray about Croker inserting &quot;high Tory&quot; sentiment, writing that &quot;it is quite impossible that anything adverse to the general measure of Reform can issue from my pen.&quot; Further, at the time ''Gallomania'' was published, Disraeli was in fact electioneering in [[High Wycombe]] in the Radical interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=84–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli's politics at the time were influenced both by his rebellious streak and by his desire to make his mark. In the early 1830s the [[Tory (British political grouping)|Tories]] and the interests they represented appeared to be a lost cause. The other great party, the Whigs, was anathema to Disraeli: &quot;Toryism is worn out &amp; I cannot condescend to be a Whig.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he initially stood for election, unsuccessfully, as a Radical, Disraeli was a [[Tory]] by the time he won a seat in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in 1837 representing the constituency of [[Maidstone (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone]].&lt;ref&gt;Blake, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a Conservative, Disraeli was sympathetic to some of the demands of the [[Chartists]] and argued for an alliance between the landed aristocracy and the working class against the increasing power of the merchants and new industrialists in the middle class, helping to found the [[Young England]] group in 1842 to promote the view that the landed interests should use their power to protect the poor from exploitation by middle-class businessmen. During the twenty years between the [[Corn Laws]] and the Second Reform Bill Disraeli would seek a Tory-Radical alliance, to little avail. Prior to the 1867 Reform Bill the working class did not possess the vote and therefore had little tangible political power. Although Disraeli forged a personal friendship with [[John Bright]], a Lancashire manufacturer and leading Radical, Disraeli was unable to convince Bright to sacrifice principle for political gain. After one such attempt, Bright noted in his diary that Disraeli &quot;seems unable to comprehend the morality of our political course.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Trevelyan|1913|p=207}}. The specific occasion was the 1852 Budget. Disraeli seems to have held out the possibility of Bright, [[Richard Cobden]], and [[Thomas Milner Gibson]] eventually joining the cabinet in exchange for the support of the Radicals.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protection===
[[Image:Robert Peel.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir Robert Peel, Bt., Prime Minister 1834–35, 1841–46]]
[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] passed over Disraeli when putting together his [[First Peel ministry|government]] in 1841 and Disraeli, hurt, gradually became a sharp critic of Peel's government, often deliberately adopting positions contrary to those of his nominal chief.&lt;ref&gt;Peel's reasons for doing so are disputed. Some historians suggest Edward Stanley's well-known antipathy to Disraeli as the prime factor. Robert Blake dismisses these claims, arguing instead that Peel's need to balance the various factions of the Conservative Party, and the heavy preponderance of aristocrats within the cabinet, precluded Disraeli's inclusion. See {{Harvnb|Cline|1939}}, and {{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=165–166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The best known of these cases was the [[Maynooth grant]] in 1845 and the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. The end of 1845 and the first months of 1846 were dominated by a battle in parliament between the free traders and the protectionists over the repeal of the Corn Laws, with the latter rallying around Disraeli and [[Lord George Bentinck]]. An alliance of pro free-trade Conservatives (the &quot;Peelites&quot;), Radicals, and Whigs carried repeal, and the Conservative Party split: the [[Peelites]] moved towards the Whigs, while a &quot;new&quot; Conservative Party formed around the protectionists, led by Disraeli, Bentinck, and [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]] (later Lord Derby).&lt;ref&gt;For the bitterness over the Corn Laws, see {{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=228–234}}. For the effect of the split, see {{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=241–243}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This split had profound implications for Disraeli's political career: almost every Conservative politician with official experience followed Peel, leaving the rump bereft of leadership. As one biographer wrote, &quot;[Disraeli] found himself almost the only figure on his side capable of putting up the oratorical display essential for a parliamentary leader.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking on from the House of Lords, the [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] wrote that Disraeli &quot;was like a [[subaltern]] in a great battle where every superior officer was killed or wounded.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=247–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the remainder of the Conservative Party could muster the electoral support necessary to form a government, then Disraeli was now guaranteed high office. However, he would take office with a group of men who possessed little or no official experience, who had rarely felt moved to speak in the House of Commons before, and who, as a group, remained hostile to Disraeli on a personal level, his assault on the Corn Laws notwithstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bentinck and the leadership===
In 1847 a small political crisis occurred which removed Bentinck from the leadership and highlighted Disraeli's differences with his own party. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1847|preceding general election]], [[Lionel de Rothschild]] had been returned for the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]]. Ever since Catholic Emancipation, members of parliament were required to swear the oath &quot;on the true faith of a Christian.&quot; Rothschild, an unconverted Jew, could not do so and therefore could not take his seat. [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], the Whig leader who had succeeded Peel as Prime Minister and like Rothschild a member for the City of London, introduced a [[Jewish Disabilities Bill]] to amend the oath and permit Jews to enter Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Lord George Bentinck.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Lord George Bentinck, Conservative leader in the commons 1846–48]]

Disraeli spoke in favour of the measure, arguing that Christianity was &quot;completed Judaism,&quot; and asking of the House of Commons &quot;Where is your Christianity if you do not believe in their Judaism?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, 3rd Series, xcv, 1321-1330, 16 December 1847.&lt;/ref&gt; While Disraeli did not argue that the Jews did the Christians a favour by killing [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], as he had in ''Tancred'' and would in ''[[Lord George Bentinck (book)|Lord George Bentinck]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Morley, 715-716.&lt;/ref&gt; which along with the Anglican establishment was hostile to the bill.&lt;ref&gt;Of the 26 Anglican bishops and archbishops who sat in the House of Lords, 23 voted on the measure altogether, and 17 were opposed.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Wilberforce]], [[Bishop of Oxford]] and a friend of Disraeli's, spoke strongly against the measure and implied that Russell was paying off the Jews for &quot;helping&quot; elect him.&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, 3rd Series, xcviii, 1374-1378, 25 May 1848.&lt;/ref&gt; Every member of the future protectionist cabinet then in parliament (except Disraeli) voted against the measure. One member who was not, Lord John Manners, stood against Rothschild when the latter re-submitted himself for election in 1849. Bentinck, then still Conservative leader in the Commons, joined Disraeli in speaking and voting for the bill, although his own speech was a standard one of toleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=259–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the debate Bentinck resigned the leadership and feuded with Stanley, leader in the Lords and overall leader, who had opposed the measure and directed the party whips—in the Commons—to oppose the measure as well. Bentinck was succeeded by [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland|Lord Granby]]; Disraeli's own speech, thought by many of his own party to be blasphemous, ruled him out for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even as these intrigues played out, Disraeli was working with the Bentinck family to secure the necessary financing to purchase [[Hughenden Manor]], in [[Buckinghamshire]]. This purchase allowed him to stand for the county, which was &quot;essential&quot; if one was to lead the Conservative Party at the time. He and [[Mary Anne Disraeli, 1st Viscountess Beaconsfield|Mary Anne]] alternated between Hughenden and several homes in London for the remainder of their marriage. These negotiations were complicated by the sudden death of Lord George on 21 September 1848, but Disraeli obtained a loan of £25,000 (equivalent to about £{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|25000|1848|r=-4}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}){{Inflation-fn|UK}} from Lord George's brothers [[Lord Henry Bentinck]] and [[William Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, 5th Duke of Portland|Lord Titchfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=251–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a month Granby resigned the leadership in the commons, feeling himself inadequate to the post, and the party functioned without an actual leader in the commons for the remainder of the parliamentary session. At the start of the next session, affairs were handled by a triumvirate of Granby, Disraeli, and [[John Charles Herries]]–indicative of the tension between Disraeli and the rest of the party, who needed his talents but mistrusted the man. This confused arrangement ended with Granby's resignation in 1851; Disraeli effectively ignored the two men regardless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=266–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Office==
===First Derby government===
{{Main|Who? Who? Ministry}}
[[Image:14th Earl of Derby.jpg|thumb|upright|The Earl of Derby, Prime Minister 1852, 1858–59, 1866–68]]
The first opportunity for the protectionist Tories under Disraeli and Stanley to take office came in 1851, when [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell's]] [[First Russell Ministry|government]] was defeated in the House of Commons over the [[Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851]]. Disraeli was to have been [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretary]], with Stanley (becoming the ''Earl of Derby'' later that year) as Prime Minister. Other possible ministers included [[Robert Inglis|Sir Robert Inglis]], [[Henry Goulburn]], [[John Charles Herries]], and [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]]. The [[Peelites]], however, refused to serve under Stanley or with Disraeli so long as the question of [[free trade]] remained unsettled, and attempts to form a purely protectionist government failed. Derby supposedly remarked at the time, &quot;Pshaw! These are not names which I can put before the Queen!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=301–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell resumed office, but resigned again in early 1852 when a combination of the protectionists and [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] defeated him on a Militia Bill.&lt;ref&gt;Palmerston got his &quot;tit for tat&quot; with &quot;Johnny Russell&quot;, who under pressure from the Crown had dismissed Palmerston from the Foreign Office the previous December.&lt;/ref&gt; This time [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] (as he had become) took office, and to general surprise appointed Disraeli [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].&lt;ref&gt;The expectation had been that Disraeli would assume the Foreign or Home offices.&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli had offered to stand aside as leader in the House of Commons in favour of Palmerston, but the latter declined.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary responsibility of a mid-Victorian chancellor was to produce a Budget for the coming fiscal year. Disraeli proposed to reduce taxes on [[malt]] and [[tea]] ([[indirect taxation]]); additional revenue would come from an increase in the [[house tax]]. More controversially, Disraeli also proposed to alter the workings of the [[income tax]] ([[direct taxation]]) by &quot;differentiating&quot;–i.e., different rates would be levied on different types of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ghosh|1984|pp=269–273}}; {{Harvnb|Matthew|1986|p=621}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the income tax on a permanent basis had been the subject of much inter-party discussion since the fall of Peel's ministry, but no consensus had been reached, and Disraeli was criticised for mixing up details over the different &quot;schedules&quot; of income. Disraeli's proposal to extend the tax to [[Ireland]] gained him further enemies, and he was also hampered by an unexpected increase in defence expenditure, which was forced on him by Derby and [[John Pakington, 1st Baron Hampton|Sir John Pakington]] ([[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]]) (leading to his celebrated remark to [[John Bright]] about the &quot;damned defences&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Bright's diary quotes the conversation in full. See {{Harvnb|Trevelyan|1913|pp=205–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, combined with bad timing and perceived inexperience led to the failure of the Budget and consequently the fall of the government in December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;On the centrality of the income tax, see {{Harvnb|Matthew|1986|pp=121–122}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladstone's final speech on the failed Budget marked the beginning of over twenty years of mutual parliamentary hostility, as well as the end of Gladstone's formal association with the Conservative Party. No Conservative reconciliation remained possible so long as Disraeli remained leader in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, pp. 346-347.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition===
With the fall of the government, Disraeli and the Conservatives returned to the opposition benches. Derby's successor as Prime Minister was the Peelite [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]], whose ministry was composed of both Peelites and Whigs. Disraeli himself was succeeded as chancellor by Gladstone.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Derby government===
{{Main|Second Derby Ministry}}
[[Image:Palmerston.jpg|thumb|upright|The Viscount Palmerston, Prime Minister 1855–58, 1859–65]]
[[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]'s [[First Palmerston ministry|government]] collapsed in 1858 amid public fallout over the [[Felice Orsini|Orsini affair]] and Derby took office at the head of a purely 'Conservative' administration. He again offered a place to Gladstone, who declined. Disraeli remained leader of the House of Commons and returned to the Exchequer. As in 1852 Derby's was a [[minority government]], dependent on the division of its opponents for survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hawkins|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal measure of the 1858 session would be a bill to re-organise governance of India, the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Mutiny]] having exposed the inadequacy of dual control. The first attempt at legislation was drafted by the [[President of the Board of Control]], [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]], who had previously served as [[Governor-General of India]] (1841–44). The bill, however, was riddled with complexities and had to be withdrawn. Soon after, Ellenborough was forced to resign over an entirely separate matter involving the current Governor-General, [[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|Lord Canning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=379–382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with a vacancy, Disraeli and Derby tried yet again to bring [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] into the government. Disraeli wrote a personal letter to Gladstone, asking him to place the good of the party above personal animosity: &quot;Every man performs his office, and there is a Power, greater than ourselves, that disposes of all this...&quot; In responding to Disraeli Gladstone denied that personal feelings played any role in his decision then and previously to accept office, while acknowledging that there were differences between him and Derby &quot;broader than you may have supposed.&quot; Gladstone also hinted at the strength of his own faith, and the role it played in his public life, when he addressed Disraeli's most personal and private appeal:

{{quote|I state these points fearlessly and without reserve, for you have yourself well reminded me that there is a Power beyond us that disposes of what we are and do, and I find the limits of choice in public life to be very narrow.—W. E. Gladstone to Disraeli, 1858&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=382–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With Gladstone's refusal Derby and Disraeli looked elsewhere and settled on Disraeli's old friend [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], who became [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]]; Derby's son [[Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]], succeeded Ellenborough at the Board of Control. Stanley, with Disraeli's assistance, proposed and guided through the house the India Act, under which the subcontinent would be governed for sixty years. The East India Company and its Governor-General were replaced by a [[Viceroy of India|viceroy]] and the Indian Council, while at Westminster the [[President of the Board of Control|Board of Control]] was abolished and its functions assumed by the newly created India Office, under the [[Secretary of State for India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=385–386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1867 Reform Bill===
{{Main|Third Derby Ministry}}
[[Image:Gladstone.jpg|upright|thumb|William Ewart Gladstone&lt;br /&gt;Four-time Prime Minister]]
After engineering the defeat of a Liberal Reform Bill introduced by Gladstone in 1866,&lt;ref&gt;Blake, pp. 442-444.&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli and Derby introduced their own measure in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, pp. 456-457.&lt;/ref&gt; This was primarily a political strategy designed to give the Conservative party control of the reform process and the subsequent long-term benefits in the Commons, similar to those derived by the Whigs after their 1832 Reform Act. It was thought that if the Conservatives were able to secure this piece of legislation, then the newly enfranchised electorate may return their gratitude to the Tories in the form of a Conservative vote at the next general election. As a result, this would give the Conservatives a greater chance of forming a majority government. After so many years in the 'stagnant backwaters' of British politics, this seemed most appealing. The [[Reform Act 1867]] extended the franchise by 938,427 – an increase of 88% – by giving the vote to male householders and male lodgers paying at least 10 pounds for rooms and eliminating [[rotten borough]]s with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants, and granting constituencies to fifteen unrepresented towns, and extra representation in parliament to larger towns such as Liverpool and Manchester, which had previously been under-represented in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conancher|1971|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act was unpopular with the right wing of the Conservative Party, most notably [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]] (later the Marquess of Salisbury), who resigned from the government and spoke against the bill, accusing Disraeli of &quot;a political betrayal which has no parallel in our Parliamentary annals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Blake|1966|p=473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cranborne, however, was unable to lead a rebellion similar to that which Disraeli had led against Peel twenty years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, p. 461..&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime minister==
{{Main|Premiership of Benjamin Disraeli}}

===First government===
{{Main|First Disraeli ministry}}
[[Image:3rd Marquess of Salisbury.jpg|upright|thumb|Three-time Prime Minister [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]]]]
Derby's health had been declining for some time and he finally resigned as Prime Minister in late February 1868; he would live for twenty months. Disraeli's efforts over the past two years had dispelled, for the time being, any doubts about him succeeding Derby as leader of the Conservative Party and therefore Prime Minister. As Disraeli remarked, &quot;I have climbed to the top of the greasy pole.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=485–487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Conservatives were still a minority in the House of Commons, and the passage of the Reform Bill required the calling of new election once the new voting register had been compiled. Disraeli's term as Prime Minister would therefore be fairly short, unless the Conservatives won the general election. He made only two major changes in the cabinet: he replaced [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] as [[Lord Chancellor]] with [[Hugh Cairns, 1st Earl Cairns|Lord Cairns]], and brought in [[George Ward Hunt]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. Disraeli and Chelmsford had never got along particularly well, and Cairns, in Disraeli's view, was a far stronger minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=487–489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disraeli's first premiership was dominated by the heated debate over the [[Established Church|established]] [[Church of Ireland]]. Although [[Ireland]] was overwhelmingly [[Roman Catholic]], the [[Protestant]] Church remained the established church and was funded by direct taxation. An initial attempt by Disraeli to negotiate with [[Henry Edward Manning|Cardinal Manning]] the establishment of a Roman Catholic university in [[Dublin]] foundered in March when [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] moved resolutions to disestablish the Irish Church altogether. The proposal divided the Conservative Party while reuniting the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] under Gladstone's leadership. While Disraeli's government survived until the [[United Kingdom general election, 1868|December general election]], the initiative had passed to the Liberals, who were returned to power with a majority of 170.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=496–502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second government===
{{Main|Second Disraeli ministry}}
After six years in opposition, Disraeli and the Conservative Party won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1874|election of 1874]], giving the party its first absolute [[majority government|majority]] in the House of Commons since the 1840s. Under the stewardship of [[Richard Assheton Cross|R. A. Cross]], the [[Home Secretary]], Disraeli's government introduced various reforms, including the [[Artisan's and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act 1875]], the [[Public Health Act 1875]], the Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875), and the Education Act (1876). His government also introduced a new [[Factory Act]] meant to protect workers, the [[Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875]] to allow peaceful picketing, and the Employers and Workmen Act (1875) to enable workers to sue employers in the civil courts if they broke legal contracts. As a result of these social reforms the [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Liberal-Labour]] MP [[Alexander Macdonald (Lib–Lab politician)|Alexander Macdonald]] told his constituents in 1879, &quot;The Conservative party have done more for the working classes in five years than the Liberals have in fifty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Monypenny|Buckle|1929|p=709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperialism===
{{Main|Eastern Question}}
[[Image:old disraeli.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Disraeli and [[Queen Victoria]], during the latter's visit to [[Hughenden Manor]] at the height of the Eastern crisis.]]
[[Image:Victoria Disraeli cartoon.jpg|thumb|upright|''New Crowns for Old'' depicts [[Disraeli]] as Abanazer from the [[pantomime]] version of [[Aladdin]] offering [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] an imperial crown in exchange for a royal one.''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disraeli cultivated a public image of himself as an Imperialist with grand gestures such as conferring on Queen Victoria the title “Empress of India”.]]
Disraeli was, according to some interpretations, a supporter of the expansion and preservation of the [[British Empire]] in the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]].  In spite of the objections of his own cabinet and without Parliament's consent, he obtained a short-term loan from [[Lionel de Rothschild]] in order to purchase 44% of the shares of the [[Suez Canal Company]]. Before this action, though, he had for the most part opted to continue the Whig policy of limited expansion, preferring to maintain the then-current borders as opposed to promoting expansion.&lt;ref&gt;For the Suez deal, see {{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=581–587}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disraeli and Gladstone clashed over Britain's Balkan policy. Disraeli saw the situation as a matter of British imperial and strategic interests, keeping to [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]]'s policy of supporting the Ottoman Empire against Russian expansion. According to Blake, Disraeli believed in upholding Britain's greatness through a tough, &quot;no nonsense&quot; foreign policy that put Britain's interests above the &quot;moral law&quot; that advocated emancipation of small nations.&lt;ref name = &quot;xfufyb&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|p=760}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gladstone, however, saw the issue in moral terms, for Bulgarian Christians had been massacred by the Turks and Gladstone therefore believed it was immoral to support the Ottoman Empire. Blake further argued that Disraeli's imperialism &quot;decisively orientated the Conservative party for many years to come, and the tradition which he started was probably a bigger electoral asset in winning working-class support during the last quarter of the century than anything else&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;xfufyb&quot; /&gt;

A leading proponent of [[the Great Game]], Disraeli introduced the [[Royal Titles Act 1876]], which created Queen Victoria [[Empress of India]], putting her at the same level as the Russian Tsar. In his private correspondence with the Queen, he proposed &quot;to clear [[Central Asia]] of Muscovites and drive them into the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Disraeli's letter to the Queen in Mahajan, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to contain Russia's influence, he launched an invasion of [[Afghanistan]] and signed the [[Cyprus Convention]] with Turkey, whereby this strategically placed island was handed over to Britain.

Disraeli scored another diplomatic success at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, in preventing Bulgaria from gaining full independence, limiting the growing influence of [[Russia]] in the [[Balkans]] and breaking up the [[League of the Three Emperors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=649–654}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, difficulties in South Africa (epitomised by the defeat of the British Army at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]]), as well as Afghanistan, weakened his government and led to his party's defeat in the 1880 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=660–679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title and death===
Disraeli was elevated to the House of Lords in 1876 when [[Queen Victoria]]  made him '''Earl of Beaconsfield''' and '''Viscount Hughenden'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|p=566}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Disraelideathmask.jpg|thumb|upright|left|caption|Disraeli's death mask]]

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|general election of 1880]] Disraeli's Conservatives were defeated by Gladstone's Liberals, in large part owing to the uneven course of the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]].  The Irish Home Rule vote in England contributed to his party's defeat. Disraeli became ill soon after and died in April 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|p=749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried in a vault beneath St Michael's Church in the grounds of his home [[Hughenden Manor]], accessed from the churchyard. Against the outside wall of the church is a memorial erected in his honour by Queen Victoria. His [[literary executor]], and for all intents and purposes his heir, was his private secretary, [[Montagu Corry, 1st Baron Rowton|Lord Rowton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|pp=751–756}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Disraeli vault also contains the body of Sarah Brydges Willyams, the wife of James Brydges Willyams of [[St Mawgan]] in Cornwall. Her wish to be buried there was granted after she left an estate sworn at under £40,000, of which Disraeli received over £30,000.

Disraeli has a memorial in [[Westminster Abbey Burials and Memorials|Westminster Abbey]]. He is also remembered with a large statue in the market town of [[Ormskirk]] where he graces the centre of famous student town.

==Judaism==
Although born of [[Jew]]ish parents, Disraeli was baptised in the Christian faith at the age of twelve, and remained an observant [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|1966|p=11}}. See also {{Harvnb|Endelman|1985|p=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Kirsch, in his biography of Disraeli, states that his Jewishness was &quot;both the greatest obstacle to his ambition and its greatest engine.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |first=Anthony |last=Julius |title=Judaism's Redefiner |date=23&amp;nbsp;January 2009| newspaper=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/books/review/Julius-t.html?ref=books |accessdate=18 September 2009 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the criticism of his policies was couched in [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] terms.

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], the '''binomial distribution''' is the [[discrete probability distribution]] of the number of successes in a sequence of ''n'' [[statistical independence|independent]] yes/no experiments, each of which yields success with [[probability]] ''p''. Such a success/failure experiment is also called a Bernoulli experiment or [[Bernoulli trial]]; when ''n'' = 1, the binomial distribution is a [[Bernoulli distribution]]. The Binomial distribution is an n times repeated [[Bernoulli trial]]. The binomial distribution is the basis for the popular [[binomial test]] of [[statistical significance]].

The binomial distribution is frequently used to model the number of successes in a sample of size ''n'' drawn with replacement from a population of size ''N.'' If the sampling is carried out without replacement, the draws are not independent and so the resulting distribution is a [[hypergeometric distribution]], not a binomial one.  However, for ''N'' much larger than ''n,'' the binomial distribution is a good approximation, and widely used.

==Specification==
===Probability mass function===

In general, if the random variable ''K'' follows the binomial distribution with parameters ''n'' and ''p'', we write ''K''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;B(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p''). The probability of getting exactly ''k'' successes in ''n'' trials is given by the [[probability mass function]]:

:&lt;math&gt; f(k;n,p) = \Pr(K = k) = {n\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'', where

:&lt;math&gt;{n\choose k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[binomial coefficient]] (hence the name of the distribution) &quot;''n''&amp;nbsp;choose&amp;nbsp;''k''&quot;, also denoted ''C''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''k''),&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, or &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. The formula can be understood as follows: we want ''k'' successes (''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''k'' failures (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the ''k'' successes can occur anywhere among the ''n'' trials, and there are C(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''k'') different ways of distributing ''k'' successes in a sequence of ''n'' trials.

In creating reference tables for binomial distribution probability, usually the table is filled in up to ''n''/2 values. This is because for ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''/2, the probability can be calculated by its complement as

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;n,p)=f(n-k;n,1-p). \, &lt;/math&gt;

So, one must look to a different ''k'' and a different ''p'' (the binomial is not symmetrical in general). However, its behavior is not arbitrary. There is always an integer ''M'' that satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;(n+1)p-1 &lt; M \leq (n+1)p. \, &lt;/math&gt;

As a function of ''k'', the expression ''ƒ''(''k'';&amp;nbsp;''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') is monotone increasing for ''k''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''M'' and monotone decreasing for ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''M'', with the exception of the case where (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''p'' is an integer. In this case, there are two values for which ''ƒ'' is maximal: (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''p'' and (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. ''M'' is the ''most probable'' (''most likely'') outcome of the Bernoulli trials and is called the [[mode]]. Note that the probability of it occurring can be fairly small.

===Cumulative distribution function===

The [[cumulative distribution function]] can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;F(x;n,p) = \Pr(X \le x) = \sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor x \rfloor} {n\choose i}p^i(1-p)^{n-i}.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \lfloor x\rfloor\,&lt;/math&gt; is the &quot;floor&quot; under ''x'', i.e. the [[greatest integer]] less than or equal to ''x''.

It can also be represented in terms of the [[regularized incomplete beta function]], as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F(k;n,p) &amp; = \Pr(X \le k) = I_{1-p}(n-k, k+1) \\
&amp; = (n-k) {n \choose k} \int_0^{1-p} t^{n-k-1} (1-t)^k \, dt.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For ''k'' ≤ ''np'', [[Chernoff bound|upper bounds]] for the lower tail of the distribution function can be derived.  In particular, [[Hoeffding's inequality]] yields the bound

:&lt;math&gt; F(k;n,p) \leq \frac{1}{2}\exp\left(-2 \frac{(np-k)^2}{n}\right), \!&lt;/math&gt;

and [[Chernoff's inequality]] can be used to derive the bound

:&lt;math&gt; F(k;n,p) \leq \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\,p} \frac{(np-k)^2}{n}\right). \!&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, these bounds are reasonably tight when ''p = 1/2'', since the following expression holds for all ''k'' ≥ ''3n/8''&lt;ref&gt;Matoušek, J, Vondrak, J: ''The Probabilistic Method'' (lecture notes) [http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~matousek/prob-ln.ps.gz].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; F(k;n,1/2) \geq \frac{1}{15} \exp\left(- \frac{16 (n/2 - k)^2}{n}\right). \!&lt;/math&gt;

==Mean and variance==

If ''X'' ~ ''B''(''n'', ''p'') (that is, ''X'' is a binomially distributed random variable), then the [[expected value]] of ''X'' is
: &lt;math&gt;
    \operatorname{E}[X] = np
  &lt;/math&gt;
and the [[variance]] is
: &lt;math&gt;
    \operatorname{Var}[X] = np(1 - p).
  &lt;/math&gt;

This fact is easily proven as follows. Suppose first that we have a single Bernoulli trial. There are two possible outcomes: 1 and 0, the first occurring with probability ''p'' and the second having probability 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p''. The expected value in this trial will be equal to {{nowrap|1=''μ'' = 1&amp;thinsp;·&amp;thinsp;''p'' + 0&amp;thinsp;·&amp;thinsp;(1−''p'') = ''p''}}. The variance in this trial is calculated similarly: {{nowrap|1=''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (1−''p'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·''p'' + (0−''p'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·(1−''p'') = ''p''(1&amp;thinsp;−&amp;thinsp;''p'')}}.

The generic binomial distribution is a sum of ''n'' independent Bernoulli trials. The mean and the variance of such distributions are equal to the sums of means and variances of each individual trial:
: &lt;math&gt;
    \mu_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \mu = np, \qquad
    \sigma^2_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \sigma^2 = np(1 - p).
  &lt;/math&gt;

==Mode and median==

Usually the [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of a binomial ''B''(''n'',&amp;thinsp;''p'') distribution is equal to ⌊(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''p''⌋, where ⌊&amp;nbsp;⌋&amp;nbsp;is the [[floor function]]. However when (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''p'' is an integer and ''p'' is neither 0 nor 1, then the distribution has two modes: (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''p'' and (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. When ''p'' is equal to 0 or 1, the mode will be 0 and ''n'' correspondingly. These cases can be summarized as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;
    \text{mode} = 
      \begin{cases}
        \lfloor (n+1)\,p\rfloor &amp; \text{if }(n+1)p\text{ is 0 or a noninteger}, \\
        (n+1)\,p\ \text{ and }\ (n+1)\,p - 1 &amp;\text{if }(n+1)p\in\{1,\dots,n\}, \\
        n &amp; \text{if }(n+1)p = n + 1.
      \end{cases}
  &lt;/math&gt;

In general, there is no single formula to find the [[median]] for a binomial distribution, and it may even be non-unique. However several special results have been established:
* If ''np'' is an integer, then the mean, median, and mode coincide and equal ''np''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neumann|first=P.|year=1966|title=Über den Median der Binomial- and Poissonverteilung|journal=Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift der Technischen Universität Dresden|volume=19|pages=29–33|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Nick. (July 2010). &quot;Binomial averages when the mean is an integer&quot;, [[The Mathematical Gazette]] 94, 331-332.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Any median ''m'' must lie within the interval ⌊''np''⌋&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;⌈''np''⌉.&lt;ref name=&quot;KaasBuhrman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first1=R.|last1=Kaas|first2=J.M.|last2=Buhrman|title=Mean, Median and Mode in Binomial Distributions|journal=Statistica Neerlandica|year=1980|volume=34|issue=1|pages=13–18|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9574.1980.tb00681.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A median ''m'' cannot lie too far away from the mean: {{nowrap|&amp;#124;''m'' − ''np''&amp;#124; ≤ min{&amp;thinsp;ln 2, max{''p'', 1 − ''p''}&amp;thinsp;}}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamza&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/0167-7152(94)00090-U}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The median is unique and equal to ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[[Rounding|round]](''np'') in cases when either {{nowrap|''p'' ≤ 1 − ln 2}} or {{nowrap|''p'' ≥ ln 2}} or |''m''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''np''|&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;min{''p'',&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p''} (except for the case when ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;½ and ''n'' is odd).&lt;ref name=&quot;KaasBuhrman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamza&quot;/&gt;
* When ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2 and ''n'' is odd, any number ''m'' in the interval ½(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;½(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) is a median of the binomial distribution. If ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2 and ''n'' is even, then ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''/2 is the unique median.

==Covariance between two binomials==

If two binomially distributed random variables ''X'' and ''Y'' are observed together, estimating their covariance can be useful. Using the definition of [[covariance]], in the case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 we have

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) = \operatorname{E}(XY) - \mu_X \mu_Y.&lt;/math&gt;

The first term is non-zero only when both ''X'' and ''Y'' are one, and ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; are equal to the two probabilities. Defining ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; as the probability of both happening at the same time, this gives

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) = p_B - p_X p_Y, \, &lt;/math&gt;

and for ''n'' such trials again due to independence

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y)_n = n ( p_B - p_X p_Y ). \, &lt;/math&gt;

If ''X'' and ''Y'' are the same variable, this reduces to the variance formula given above.

==Relationship to other distributions==
===Sums of binomials===
If ''X''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;B(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') and ''Y''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;B(''m'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') are independent binomial variables, then ''X''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''Y''  is again a binomial variable; its distribution is

:&lt;math&gt;X+Y \sim B(n+m, p).\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Bernoulli distribution===
The [[Bernoulli distribution]] is a special case of the binomial distribution, where ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. Symbolically, ''X''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;B(1,&amp;nbsp;''p'') has the same meaning as ''X''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;Bern(''p''). Conversely, any binomial distribution, B(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p''), is the sum of ''n'' independent [[Bernoulli trials]], Bern(''p''), each with the same probability ''p''.

===Poisson binomial distribution===
The binomial distribution is a special case of the [[Poisson binomial distribution]], which is a sum of ''n'' independent non-identical [[Bernoulli trials]] Bern(''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'').  If ''X'' has the Poisson binomial distribution with ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=''p'' then ''X''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;B(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p'').

===Normal approximation===

[[Image:Binomial Distribution.svg|right|250px|thumb|Binomial PDF and normal approximation for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 and ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.5]]

If ''n'' is large enough, then the skew of the distribution is not too great. In this case, if a suitable [[continuity correction]] is used, then an excellent approximation to B(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') is given by the [[normal distribution]]

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{N}(np,\, np(1-p)).&lt;/math&gt;

The approximation generally improves as ''n'' increases (at least 20) and is better when ''p'' is not near to 0 or 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;bhh&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistics for experimenters|author=Box, Hunter and Hunter|publisher=Wiley|year=1978|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[Rule of thumb|rules of thumb]] may be used to decide whether ''n'' is large enough, and ''p'' is far enough from the extremes of zero or one:

*One rule is that both ''x=np'' and ''n''(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'') must be greater than&amp;nbsp;5. However, the specific number varies from source to source, and depends on how good an approximation one wants; some sources give 10 which gives virtually the same results as the following rule for large ''n'' until ''n'' is very large (ex: ''x=11, n=7752'').

*That rule&lt;ref name=&quot;bhh&quot;/&gt; is that for {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 5}} the normal approximation is adequate if

:: &lt;math&gt;|(1/\sqrt{n})(\sqrt{(1-p)/p}-\sqrt{p/(1-p)})|&lt;0.3&lt;/math&gt;

*Another commonly used rule holds that the normal approximation is appropriate only if everything within 3 standard deviations of its mean is within the range of possible values, that is if

:: &lt;math&gt;\mu \pm 3 \sigma = np \pm 3 \sqrt{np(1-p)} \in [0,n]. \, &lt;/math&gt;

*Also as the approximation generally improves, it can be shown that the [[inflection point]]s occur at

:: &lt;math&gt;np \pm \sqrt{np(1-p)} \, &lt;/math&gt;

The following is an example of applying a [[continuity correction]]: Suppose one wishes to calculate Pr(''X''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;8) for a binomial random variable ''X''. If ''Y'' has a distribution given by the normal approximation, then Pr(''X''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;8) is approximated by Pr(''Y''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;8.5). The addition of 0.5 is the continuity correction; the uncorrected normal approximation gives considerably less accurate results.

This approximation, known as [[de Moivre–Laplace theorem]], is a huge time-saver (exact calculations with large ''n'' are very onerous); historically, it was the first use of the normal distribution, introduced in [[Abraham de Moivre]]'s book ''[[The Doctrine of Chances]]'' in 1738. Nowadays, it can be seen as a consequence of the [[central limit theorem]] since B(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') is a sum of ''n'' independent, identically distributed [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli variables]] with parameter&amp;nbsp;''p''. This fact is the basis of a [[hypothesis test]], a &quot;proportion z-test,&quot; for the value of ''p'' using ''x/n'', the sample proportion and estimator of ''p'', in a [[common test statistics|common test statistic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[NIST]]/[[SEMATECH]], [http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section2/prc24.htm &quot;7.2.4. Does the proportion of defectives meet requirements?&quot;] ''e-Handbook of Statistical Methods.''&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, suppose you randomly sample ''n'' people out of a large population and ask them whether they agree with a certain statement. The proportion of people who agree will of course depend on the sample. If you sampled groups of ''n'' people repeatedly and truly randomly, the proportions would follow an approximate normal distribution with mean equal to the true proportion ''p'' of agreement in the population and with standard deviation σ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''p''(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'')/''n'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;. Large [[sample size]]s ''n'' are good because the standard deviation, as a proportion of the expected value, gets smaller, which allows a more precise estimate of the unknown parameter&amp;nbsp;''p''.

===Poisson approximation===

The binomial distribution converges towards the [[Poisson distribution]] as the number of trials goes to infinity while the product ''np'' remains fixed. Therefore the Poisson distribution with parameter ''λ'' = ''np'' can be used as an approximation to B(''n'', ''p'') of the binomial distribution if ''n'' is sufficiently large and ''p'' is sufficiently small.  According to two rules of thumb, this approximation is good if ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;20 and ''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;0.05, or if ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;100 and ''np''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;ref&gt;[[NIST]]/[[SEMATECH]], [http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section3/pmc331.htm &quot;6.3.3.1. Counts Control Charts&quot;], ''e-Handbook of Statistical Methods.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limits==

* As ''n'' approaches ∞ and ''p'' approaches 0 while ''np'' remains fixed at λ&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 or at least ''np'' approaches λ&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, then the Binomial(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''p'') distribution approaches the [[Poisson distribution]] with [[expected value]] λ.

* As ''n'' approaches ∞ while ''p'' remains fixed, the distribution of

::&lt;math&gt;{X-np \over \sqrt{np(1-p)\ }}&lt;/math&gt;

:approaches the [[normal distribution]] with expected value&amp;nbsp;0 and [[variance]]&amp;nbsp;1.  This result is sometimes loosely stated by saying that the distribution of ''X'' approaches the [[normal distribution]] with expected value&amp;nbsp;''np'' and [[variance]]&amp;nbsp;''np''(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'').  That loose statement cannot be taken literally because the thing asserted to be approached actually depends on the value of&amp;nbsp;''n'', and ''n'' is approaching infinity.  This result is a specific case of the [[Central limit theorem|Central Limit Theorem]].

==Generating binomial random variates==

==Examples==
An elementary example is this: roll a standard {{dice}} ten times and count the number of fours. The distribution of this random number is a binomial distribution with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10 and ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/6.

===Symmetric binomial distribution (''p'' = 0.5)===

This example illustrates the [[central limit theorem]] in the example of fair coin tosses.
A coin is ''fair'' if it shows heads and tails with equal probability ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2.
If we toss a fair coin ''n'' times, the number ''k'' of times the coin shows 'heads' is a random variable that is binomially distributed.
The first picture below shows the binomial distribution for several values of ''n'' as a function of ''k''.

[[File:Bindis gauss.png|thumb|250 px|right|Rescaled and shifted binomial distributions with ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.5 for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;6,&amp;nbsp;8,&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;16,&amp;nbsp;23,&amp;nbsp;32,&amp;nbsp;46]]
[[File:Bindis-log.png|thumb|250 px|right|The same data as above on a logarithmic scale]]
These distributions are reflection symmetric with respect to the line ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''/2, that is,
the probability mass function satisfies ''&amp;fnof;''(''k'';&amp;nbsp;''n'',&amp;nbsp;1/2) =&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'';&amp;nbsp;''n'',&amp;nbsp;1/2).
In the middle picture, the distributions were shifted so that their mean is zero.

The width of the distribution is proportional to the standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \tfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;.  The value of the shifted functions at &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt; is their respective maximum and proportional to &lt;math&gt;1/\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, binomial distributions with different values of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; can be rescaled by multiplying the function values with &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and dividing the ''x''-axis by &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. This is depicted in the third picture above.

The picture on the right shows shifted and normalized binomial distributions, now for more and larger values of ''n'', in order to visualize that the function values converge to a common curve. By using [[Stirling's approximation]] of the [[binomial coefficients]], one gets that this curve is a [[standard normal distribution]]:

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = {1 \over \sqrt{2 \pi}}\, {\rm e}^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[probability density function]] of the [[standard normal distribution]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(0,1)&lt;/math&gt;.  The [[central limit theorem]] generalizes the above to limits of distributions that are not necessarily binomially distributed.  The second picture on the right shows the same data, but uses a logarithmic scale, which is sometimes advisable to use in applications.

===An example from sports===
A soccer (or hockey) player may attempt to score multiple goals from multiple shots. If he or she has a shooting success probability of 0.25 and takes 4 shots in a match, then the number of goals he or she scores can be modeled as B(4,&amp;nbsp;0.25); note that just as ''p'' represents the probability of any given shot becoming a goal, 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p'' represents—depending on how the model is set up and which sport is chosen—the shot missing the net or the goalkeeper making the save. The probability of the player scoring 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 goals on 4 shots are:

: &lt;math&gt;\Pr(0\text{ goals}) = f(0) = \Pr(K = 0) = {4\choose 0} 0.25^0 (1-0.25)^{4-0} \approx 0.32 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \Pr(1\text{ goal}) = f(1) = \Pr(K = 1) = {4\choose 1}0.25^1(1-0.25)^{4-1} \approx 0.42 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \Pr(2\text{ goals}) = f(2) = \Pr(K = 2) = {4\choose 2}0.25^2(1-0.25)^{4-2} \approx 0.21&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \Pr(3\text{ goals}) = f(3) = \Pr(K = 3) = {4\choose 3}0.25^3(1-0.25)^{4-3} \approx 0.05&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \Pr(4\text{ goals}) = f(4) = \Pr(K = 4) = {4\choose 4}0.25^4(1-0.25)^{4-4} \approx 0.004&lt;/math&gt;

'''Biostatistics''' (a contraction of biology and statistics; sometimes referred to as '''biometry''' or '''biometrics''') is the application of [[statistics]] to a wide range of topics in [[biology]]. The science of biostatistics encompasses the design of biological [[experiment]]s, especially in [[medicine]] and [[agriculture]]; the collection, summarization, and analysis of data from those experiments; and the interpretation of, and inference from, the results.

== Biostatistics and the history of biological thought ==
Biostatistical reasoning and modeling were of critical importance to the foundation theories of modern biology. In the early 1900s, after the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel's]] work, the conceptual gaps in understanding between [[genetics]] and evolutionary [[Darwinism]] led to vigorous debate between biometricians such as [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon|Walter Weldon]] and [[Karl Pearson]] and Mendelians such as [[Charles Benedict Davenport|Charles Davenport]], [[William Bateson]] and [[Wilhelm Johannsen]]. By the 1930s statisticians and models built on statistical reasoning had helped to resolve these differences and to produce the neo-Darwinian [[modern evolutionary synthesis]]. 

The leading figures in the establishment of this synthesis all relied on statistics and developed its use in biology.
* [[Ronald Fisher|Sir Ronald A. Fisher]] developed several basic statistical methods in support of his work ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''
* [[Sewall G. Wright]] used statistics in the development of modern [[population genetics]]
* [[J. B. S. Haldane|J. B. S Haldane's]] book, ''The Causes of Evolution'', reestablished natural selection as the premier mechanism of evolution by explaining it in terms of the mathematical consequences of Mendelian genetics.

These individuals and the work of other biostatisticians, [[mathematical biology|mathematical biologists]], and statistically inclined geneticists helped bring together [[evolutionary biology]] and [[genetics]] into a consistent, coherent whole that could begin to be [[Statistics|quantitative]]ly modeled.

In parallel to this overall development, the pioneering work of [[D'Arcy Thompson]] in ''On Growth and Form'' also helped to add quantitative discipline to biological study.

Despite the fundamental importance and frequent necessity of statistical reasoning, there may nonetheless have been a tendency among biologists to distrust or deprecate results which are not [[qualitative data|qualitatively]] apparent. One anecdote describes [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] banning the [[Friden, Inc.|Friden calculator]] from his department at [[Caltech]], saying &quot;Well, I am like a guy who is prospecting for gold along the banks of the Sacramento River in 1849. With a little intelligence, I can reach down and pick up big nuggets of gold. And as long as I can do that, I'm not going to let any people in my department waste scarce resources in [[placer mining]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tilsonfunds.com/MungerUCSBspeech.pdf|title=Academic Economics: Strengths and Faults After Considering Interdisciplinary Needs|author=Charles T. Munger|date=2003-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators are now adjusting their curricula to focus on more quantitative concepts and tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reinventioncenter.miami.edu/Spotlights/BioMath.htm|title=Spotlight:application of quantitative concepts and techniques in undergraduate biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and training programs ==
Almost all educational programmes in biostatistics are at [[postgraduate]] level. They are most often found in schools of public health, affiliated with schools of medicine, forestry, or agriculture or as a focus of application in departments of statistics. 

In the [[United States]], while several universities have dedicated biostatistics departments, many other top-tier universities integrate biostatistics faculty into statistics or other departments, such as [[epidemiology]]. Thus departments carrying the name &quot;biostatistics&quot; may exist under quite different structures. For instance, relatively new biostatistics departments have been founded with a focus on [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]], whereas older departments, typically affiliated with schools of [[public health]], will have more traditional lines of research involving epidemiological studies and [[clinical trial]]s as well as bioinformatics. In larger universities where both a statistics and a biostatistics department exist, the degree of integration between the two departments may range from the bare minimum to very close collaboration. In general, the difference between a statistics program and a biostatistics one is twofold: (i) statistics departments will often host theoretical/methodological research which are less common in biostatistics programs and (ii) statistics departments have lines of research that may include biomedical applications but also other areas such as industry ([[quality control]]), business and [[economics]] and biological areas other than medicine.

== Applications of biostatistics==
* [[Public health]], including [[epidemiology]], [[health services research]], [[nutrition]], and [[environmental health]]
* Design and analysis of [[clinical trial]]s in [[medicine]]
* [[Population genetics]], and [[statistical genetics]] in order to link variation in [[genotype]] with a variation in [[phenotype]]. This has been used in agriculture to improve crops and farm animals ([[animal breeding]]). In biomedical research, this work can assist in finding candidates for [[gene]] [[alleles]] that can cause or influence predisposition to disease in [[human genetics]]
* Anaysis of [[genomics]] data, for example from [[microarray]] or [[proteomics]] experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistical Analysis of Gene Expression Microarray Data|author=Helen Causton, John Quackenbush and Alvis Brazma|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microarray Gene Expression Data Analysis: A Beginner's Guide|author=Terry Speed|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often concerning diseases or disease stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Biostatistics for Complex Diseases|author=Frank Emmert-Streib and Matthias Dehmer|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2010|ISBN 3527325859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistical methods are beginning to be integrated into [[medical informatics]], [[public health informatics]], [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]].

'''Business statistics''' is the science of good decision making in the face of uncertainty and is used in many disciplines such as [[financial analysis]], [[econometrics]], [[auditing]], production and operations including services improvement, and marketing research. These sources feature regular repetitive publication of series of data. This makes the topic of [[time series]] especially important for business statistics. It is also a branch of [[applied statistics]] working mostly on data collected as a by-product of doing business or by government agencies. It provides knowledge and skills to interpret and use statistical techniques in a variety of business applications. A typical business statistics course is intended for business majors, and covers statistical study, descriptive statistics (collection, description, analysis, and summary of data), probability, and the binomial and [[normal distribution]]s, test of hypotheses and confidence intervals, [[linear regression]], and correlation.

The '''British and Irish Lions''' (formerly known as the '''British Isles''' and the '''British Lions''') is a [[rugby union]] team made up of players from [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]]. The Lions generally select international players; they can pick [[Cap (sport)|uncapped]] players available to one of the four [[Home nations|Home Unions]], but in {{As of|2006|alt= recent}} years this has rarely occurred.

Combined [[rugby union]] sides from the then [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] toured in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] from 1888 onwards. The first tour took place as a commercial venture, made without official backing,&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffiths9:3&quot;&gt;Griffiths (1987), pg 9:3.&lt;/ref&gt; but the six subsequent visits that took place before the 1910 South Africa tour, the first representative of the four Home Unions,&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffiths9:6&quot;&gt;Griffiths (1987), pg 9:6.&lt;/ref&gt; enjoyed a growing degree of support from the authorities.

Great Britain also entered a team at the [[Rugby union at the Summer Olympics|Olympics Games]] in [[Rugby union at the 1900 Summer Olympics|1900]] and in [[Rugby union at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], but they were organised separately from the Lions.

In 1949 the Four Home Unions combined formally to create a Tours Committee&lt;ref name=&quot;Godwin231&quot;&gt;Godwin (1981), pg 231.&lt;/ref&gt; and for the first time, every player of the 1950 Lions squad was an international before the New Zealand series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffiths9:8&quot;&gt;Griffiths (1987), pg 9:8.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950s proved a golden age for Lions rugby, although only in the 1970s did style begin to match the substance of victory in New Zealand and South Africa. Originally, poorly organised Lions teams regularly suffered defeat at the hands of their hosts, but by 1955 the tourists took the matches seriously enough to obtain a 2–2 draw in South Africa. The 1970s saw a renaissance for the side. The last tour of the [[amateurism|amateur]] age took place in 1993.

==Naming and symbols==
The team historically used the name '''British Isles'''. On their [[1950 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|1950 tour]] of New Zealand and Australia they also adopted the nickname '''British Lions''', first used by British and South African journalists on the 1924 South African tour,&lt;ref name=&quot;Godwin231&quot;/&gt; after the lion emblem on their ties, the emblem on their jerseys having been ironically dropped in favour of the four-quartered badge with the symbols of the four represented unions. When the team first emerged it represented one nation-state, with the whole of the island of Ireland being part of the United Kingdom in the nineteenth century. After the Republic of Ireland became independent in 1922, the team continued to be termed the British Isles, one argument being that the term &quot;British&quot; referred to the British Isles, rather than British in the sense of being a citizen of the United Kingdom. However, to avoid the ambiguity of the term British, and to more emphatically associate the team's identity with both of the two sovereign states it represents, from the [[2001 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia|2001 tour]] of Australia they have used the name '''British and Irish Lions'''. The team is often referred to simply as '''the Lions'''.

As the Lions do not represent a single nation-state, they do not have a national anthem. For the 2005 tour to New Zealand the Lions management commissioned a song, &quot;[[The Power of Four]]&quot;, although it met with little support amongst Lions fans at the matches and was not used on the 2009 Tour.

===Team colours and strip===
For more than half a century the Lions have been synonymous with the red jersey that sports the amalgamated crests of the four unions. However, prior to 1950 the strip went through a number of significantly different formats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lionsstripes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/412.php|title=Official Lions Rugby website ''Lions change stripes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unsanctioned tours====
In 1888, the promoter of the first expedition to Australia and New Zealand, Arthur Shrewsbury, demanded &quot;something that would be good material and yet take them by storm out here&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Misc&quot;&gt;Richard Bath, ''The British &amp; Irish Lions Miscellany'', page 76, 2008, (Vision Sports Publishing:London)&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a jersey in thick red, white and blue hoops, worn above white shorts and dark socks. The tours to South Africa in 1891 and 1896 retained the red, white and blue theme but this time as red and white hooped jerseys and dark blue shorts and socks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Misc&quot;/&gt; The 1899 trip to Australia saw a reversion to red, white and blue jerseys, but with the blue used in thick hoops and the red and white in thin bands. The shorts remained blue, as did the socks although a white flash was added to the latter. The one-off test in 1999 between England and Australia that was played to commemorate Australia's first test against Reverend [[Matthew Mullineux]]'s British side saw England wear an updated version of this jersey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Misc&quot;/&gt; In 1903, the South Africa tour followed on from the 1896 tour, with red and white hooped jerseys. The slight differences were that the red hoops were slightly thicker than the white (the opposite was true in 1896), and the white flash on the socks introduced in 1899 was partially retained.&lt;ref name=&quot;Misc&quot;/&gt; The Australia of 1904 saw exactly the same kit as in 1899, and it seemed that the British touring sides had settled on kits particular to the host destination. However, in 1908 with the Scottish and Irish unions refusing to be involved, the Anglo-Welsh side only sported red jerseys with a thick white band on their jerseys on tour to Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lionsstripes&quot;/&gt; Blue shorts were retained, but the socks were for the first time red, with a white flash.

====Blue jerseys, the Lions named and the crest adopted====
The Scots were once again involved in Dr Tom Smyth's 1910 team to South Africa. Thus, dark blue jerseys, were introduced with white shorts and the red socks of 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;Misc&quot;/&gt; The jerseys also had a single lion-rampant crest. The 1924 tour returned to South Africa, retaining the blue jerseys but now with shorts to match. It is the 1924 tour that is credited as being the first in which the team were referred to as &quot;the Lions&quot;, the irony being that it was on this tour that the single lion-rampant crest was replaced with the forerunner of the four-quartered badge with the symbols of the four represented unions, that is still worn today. Although the lion had been dropped from the jersey, the players had worn the lion motif on their ties as they arrived in South Africa, which led the press and public referring to them as &quot;the Lions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bath, ''The British &amp; Irish Lions Miscellany'', page 1, 2008, (Vision Sports Publishing:London)&lt;/ref&gt; The unofficial 1927 Argentina tour used the same kit and badge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lionsstripes&quot;/&gt; So powerful was the attribution of &quot;the Lions&quot; nickname that three heraldic versions of the animal returned as the jersey badge in 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lionsstripes&quot;/&gt; [[File:1924LionsCrest.png|150px|right|thumb|The original four-quartered crest as adopted in 1924]]This was the tour to New Zealand where the tourists now standard blue jerseys caused some controversy. Unlike in soccer, the convention in rugby is for the home side to accommodate its guests when there is a clash of kit. The New Zealand side, by then already synonymous with the appellation &quot;All Blacks&quot;, had an all black kit that clashed with the Lions' blue. After much reluctance and debate New Zealand agreed to change for the Tests and the All Blacks became the All Whites for the first time. On the 1930 tour a delegation led by the Irish lock [[George Beamish]] expressed their displeasure at the fact that whilst the blue of Scotland, white of England and red of Wales were represented in the strip there was no green for Ireland. A green flash was added to the socks, which from 1938 became a green turnover (although on blue socks thus eliminating red from the kit), and that has remained a feature of the strip ever since.&lt;ref name=&quot;Misc2&quot;&gt;Richard Bath, ''The British &amp; Irish Lions Miscellany'', page 77, 2008, (Vision Sports Publishing:London)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, the four-quartered badge returned for the tour to Argentina and has remained on the kits ever since.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lionsstripes&quot;/&gt; but other than that the strip remained the same.

====Red jerseys====
The adoption of the red jersey happened in the 1950 tour. A return to New Zealand was accompanied by a desire to avoid the controversy of 1930 and so red replaced blue for the jersey with the resultant kit being that which is still worn today, the combination of red jersey, white shorts and green and blue socks, representing the four unions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/rugby_union/article6531017.ece Lions name is a source of great pride] ''[[The Times]]'' 19 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The only additions to the strip since 1950 began appearing in 1993, with the addition of kit suppliers logos in prominent positions. Umbro had in 1989 asked for &quot;maximum brand exposure whenever possible&quot; but this did not affect the kit's appearance. Since then, Nike then Adidas have had more overt branding on the shirts, with sponsors [[Scottish Provident]] (1997), [[NTL:Telewest|NTL]] (2001), [[Zurich Assurance|Zurich]] (2005) and [[HSBC]] (2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;Misc2&quot;/&gt;

==History==
===1888–1909===

[[File:Image-Shaw-&amp;-Shrewsbury-1888.jpg|right|frame|Shaw &amp; Shrewsbury Team, 1888, The first British or Irish touring rugby team, a private-enterprise trip to Australia and New Zealand]]

[[File:Image-England-Team,-SA-1891.jpg|right|frame|Despite its label as an England side, the team which toured South Africa in 1891 contained several Scots.]]

[[File:England-v-Cape-Colony-1891.jpg|right|frame|England v Cape Colony, 1891. The first match of the Bill MacLagan undefeated tour of South Africa]]

The earliest tours date back to 1888, when a 21-man squad visited Australia and New Zealand. The squad drew players from England, Scotland and Wales, though English players predominated. The 35-match tour of two host nations included no tests, but the side played provincial, city and academic sides, winning 27 matches. They played 19 games of [[Australian rules football]], against prominent clubs in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[South Australia]], winning six and drawing one of these (see [[Australian rules football in England]]).

The first tour, although unsanctioned by rugby bodies, had established the notion of touring [[Northern Hemisphere]] sporting sides to [[Southern Hemisphere]] locations. Three years after the first tour, the [[Western Province (rugby)|Western Province union]] invited rugby bodies in Britain to tour South Africa. Some saw the [[1891 British Lions tour to South Africa|1891 team]] — the first sanctioned by the [[Rugby Football Union]] — as the [[England national rugby union team|English national team]], though others referred to it as &quot;the British Isles&quot;. The tourists played a total of twenty matches, three of them tests. The team also played the regional side of South Africa (South Africa did not exist as a political unit in 1891), winning all three matches. In a notable event of the tour, the touring side presented the [[Currie Cup]] to [[Griqualand West]], the province they thought produced the best performance on the tour.

Five years later a British Isles side returned to South Africa. They played one extra match on this tour, making the total of 21 games, including four tests against South Africa, with the British Isles winning three of them. The squad had a notable Irish orientation, with the Irish national team contributing six players to the 21-man squad.

In 1899 the British Isles touring side returned to Australia for the first time since the unofficial tour of 1888. The squad of 23 for the first time ever had players from each of the home nations. The team again participated in 21 matches, playing state teams as well as northern Queensland sides and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] teams. A four-test series took place against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], the tourists winning three out of the four.

Four years later, in 1903, the British and Irish team returned to South Africa. The opening performance of the side proved disappointing from the tourists' point of view, with defeats in its opening three matches by Western Province sides in [[Cape Town]]. From then on the team experienced mixed results, though more wins than losses. The side lost the test series to South Africa, drawing twice, but with the South Africans winning the decider 8 to nil.

No more than twelve months passed before the British and Irish team ventured to Australia and New Zealand in 1904. The tourists devastated the Australian teams, winning every single game. Australia also lost all three tests to the visitors, even getting held to a stand-still in two of the three games. Though the New Zealand leg of the tour did not take long in comparison to the number of Australian games, the British and Irish experienced considerable difficulty across the Tasman after white-washing the Australians. The team managed two early wins before losing the test to New Zealand and only winning one more game as well as drawing once. Despite their difficulties in New Zealand the tour proved a raging success on-field for the British and Irish.

In 1908 another tour took place to Australia and New Zealand. In a reversal of previous practice, the planners allocated more matches in New Zealand rather than in Australia: perhaps the strength of the New Zealand teams and the heavy defeats of all Australian teams on the previous tour influenced this decision. Some commentators thought that this tour hoped to reach out to rugby communities in Australia, as rugby league (infamously) started in Australia in 1908. The Anglo-Welsh side (Irish and Scottish unions did not participate) performed well in all the non-test matches, but drew a test against New Zealand and lost the other two.

===1910–1949===
Visits that took place before the 1910 South Africa tour (the first selected by a committee from the four Home Unions) had enjoyed a growing degree of support from the authorities, although only one of these included representatives of all four nations. The 1910 tour to South Africa marked the official beginning of British and Irish rugby tours: the inaugural tour operating under all four unions. The team performed moderately against the non-test parties, claiming victories in just over half their matches. The test series, however, went to South Africa, who won two of the three games. A side managed by Oxford University — supposedly the England rugby team, but actually including three Scottish players — toured Argentina at the time: the people of Argentina termed it the &quot;Combined British&quot;.

A wait of fourteen years would ensue until another British Isles team tour took place, again in South Africa. The team struggled with injuries and lost all four tests (a game against the Western Province had test status). This tour may have marked the occasion when the team first became known as &quot;the Lions&quot;.

In 1927 a short nine-game series took place in Argentina, with the Lions winning all nine encounters; the tour did however become a financial success for Argentinian rugby. After a seemingly long absence from New Zealand, the Lions returned in 1930 to some success. The Lions won all of their games that did not have test status except for the matches against [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]] and [[Canterbury]]; they did however lose three of their four test matches against the [[All Blacks]], winning the first test 6–3.. The side also visited Australia, losing a test but winning five out of the six non-test games.

In 1936 the Lions visited Argentina, winning all ten of their matches and only conceding nine points in the whole tour. Two years later the Lions toured in South Africa, winning more than half of their normal matches. Despite having lost the test series to South Africa by game three, the Lions won the final test.

===1950–1969===
The first post-war tour went to New Zealand and Australia in 1950. The Lions, sporting newly redesigned jerseys and displaying a fresh style of play, managed to win 22 and draw one of 29 matches over the two nations. The Lions won the opening four fixtures before losing to [[Otago]] and [[Southland Region|Southland]], but succeeded in holding the All Blacks to a nine-all draw. The Lions performed well in the remaining All Black tests though they lost all three, the team did not lose another non-test in the New Zealand leg of the tour. The Lions won all their games in Australia except for their final fixture against a [[New South Wales]] XV in [[Newcastle, Australia|Newcastle]]. They won both tests against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], in [[Brisbane]] and in Sydney.

In 1955 the Lions toured South Africa and left with another imposing record, one draw and 19 wins from the 25 fixtures. The four-test series against [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]], a thrilling affair, ended in a drawn series.

The 1959 tour to Australia and New Zealand marked once again a very successful tour for the Lions, who only lost six of their 35 fixtures. The Lions easily won both tests against Australia and lost the first three tests against the All Blacks, but did find victory (9–6) in the final test.

After the glittering decade of the 1950s, the first tour of the 1960s proved not nearly as successful as previous ones. The 1962 tour to South Africa saw the Lions still win 16 of their 25 games, but did not fair well against the Springboks, losing three of the four tests. For the 1966 tour to Australia and New Zealand [[John Robins]] became the first Lions Coach, and the trip started off very well for the Lions, who stormed through Australia, winning five non-tests and drawing one; and most notably defeating Australia in two tests as well. The Lions however experienced mixed results during the New Zealand leg of the tour, as well as losing all of the tests against the All Blacks. The Lions also played a test against [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]] on their way home, winning 19 to 8 in [[Toronto]]. The 1968 tour of South Africa saw the Lions win 15 of their 16 provincial matches, but the team actually lost three tests against the Springboks and drew one.

===1970–1979===
The 1970s saw a renaissance for the Lions. The 1971 team, centred around the skilled Welsh half-back pairing of [[Gareth Edwards]] and [[Barry John]], secured a series win over the All Blacks. The tour started with a loss to Queensland but proceeded to storm through the next provincial fixtures, winning 11 games in a row. The Lions then went on to defeat the [[All Blacks]] in [[Dunedin]]. The Lions would only lose a single match on the rest of the tour, and won the test series against New Zealand, winning and drawing the last two games, to take the series two wins to one.

One of the best-known and most successful Lions team toured South Africa in 1974 under the esteemed Irish forward [[Willie John McBride]]. It went through 22 games unbeaten, and triumphed 3–0 (with one drawn) in the test series. The test series featured a lot of violence. The management of the Lions concluded that the Springboks dominated their opponents with physical aggression. At that time test-match referees came from the home nation, substitutions took place only if a doctor found a player unable to continue and there were no video cameras or sideline officials to prevent violent play. The Lions decided &quot;to get their retaliation in first&quot; with the infamous &quot;[[99 call]]&quot;. The Lions postulated that a South African referee would probably not send off all of the Lions if they all retaliated against &quot;blatant thuggery&quot;. Famous video footage of the 'battle of [[EPRFU Stadium|Boet Erasmus Stadium']] shows [[JPR Williams]] running over half of the pitch and launching himself at van Heerden after such a call.

The 1977 tour to New Zealand saw the Lions drop only one non-test out of 21 games, a loss to a Universities side. The team did not win the test series though, winning one game but losing the other three.

In August 1977 the British Lions made a stopover in Fiji on the way home from their tour of New Zealand. Fiji beat them 25–21 at Buckhurst Park, Suva.

===1980–2005===
[[File:British and Irish Lions scrum.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The British and Irish Lions against the [[All Blacks]] in 2005]]

The Lions toured [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa|South Africa in 1980]]. The team completed a flawless non-test record, winning 14 out of 14 non-test matches on the tour. The Lions did however lose the first three tests to South Africa, winning the last one, though the series had already been won by the Springboks.
The [[1983 British Lions tour to New Zealand|1983 tour to New Zealand]] saw the team successful on the non-test front, winning all but two games, but getting white-washed in the test-series against the [[All Blacks]].
The Lions tour to [[1989 British Lions tour to Australia|Australia in 1989]] was a short affair, being only 12 matches in total. The tour was very successful for the Lions, who won all eight non-tests and won the test series against Australia, two to one.

The Lions tour to [[1993 British Lions tour to New Zealand|New Zealand in 1993]] was the last of the amateur era. The tourists won six and lost four non-test matches, and lost the test series 2–1.
The tour to [[1997 British Lions tour to South Africa|South Africa in 1997]] was a success for the Lions, who completed the tour with only two losses. The Lions won the test series 2–1.

In 2001, the ten game [[2001 British Lions tour to Australia|tour to Australia]], saw the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]] win the test series 2–1. This series saw the first award of the [[Tom Richards Trophy]].
The [[2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand|Lions' 2005 tour to New Zealand]], coached by 2003 England world cup winning coach Clive Woodward, won all seven games against provincial teams however suffered heavy defeats in all three tests and were narrowly defeated by the New Zealand Maori team.

===2009===
{{Main|2009 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa}}
The Lions faced the [[2007 Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] winners South Africa, with [[Ian McGeechan]] leading a coaching team including [[Warren Gatland]], [[Shaun Edwards]] and [[Rob Howley]]. The Lions were captained by Irish lock [[Paul O'Connell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/8007666.stm|title=O'Connell handed Lions captaincy |date=21 April 2009|work=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial Lions selection consisted of fourteen Irish players, thirteen Welsh, eight English and two Scots in the 37-man squad.

In the first Test on 20 June, they lost 26–21, and lost the series in the second 28–25 in a tightly-fought game at Loftus Versfeld on 27 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rugbybreakdown.co.uk/2009/06/springboks-take-the-series-sa-28-lions-25/|title=Springboks Take The Series: SA 28 Lions 25|date=27 June 2009|accessdate=27 June 2009|publisher=Rugby Breakdown}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lions won the third Test 28–9 at [[Coca-Cola Park (Johannesburg)|Ellis Park]], and the series finished 2–1 to South Africa.

===2013===
During June 2013 the British and Irish Lions will tour Australia. The tour will start in Hong Kong with a match against the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] before moving on to Australia for the main tour featuring 6 provincial matches and 3 tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/9102421.stm | work=BBC News | title=Lions line up match in Hong Kong | date=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The provisional dates and venues for the three international tests are:
*Saturday 22 June 2013, [[Suncorp Stadium]], Brisbane
*Saturday 29 June 2013, [[Etihad Stadium]], Melbourne
*Saturday 6 July 2013, [[ANZ Stadium]], Sydney

In June 2009 the British media reported that Argentina were lobbying for the 2013 British and Irish Lions Tour to Australia to incorporate a series of games in Argentina. The proposed format would be three provincial games in Argentina followed by two international tests, followed by three provincial games in Australia followed by three international tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/britishandirishlionsrugby/5517563/Lions-2009-Argentina-look-for-future-tour.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Lions 2009: Argentina look for future tour While the British and Irish Lions play in front of apathetic half-empty  stadiums in South Africa, Argentina look on with growing frustration and anger. | first1=Brendan | last1=Gallagher | date=13 June 2009 | accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Former Scotland and Lions fullback [[Andy Irvine]] was appointed as tour manager in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-sport/rugby/article-23888892-andy-irvine-proud-to-be-named-lion-king-for-australia-tour.do&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tours==
===Format===
The Lions {{As of|2008|alt= currently}} tour three southern-hemisphere nations; Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. They also routinely toured in Argentina before World War II. Tours currently take place every four years. The [[2009 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa|most recent tour]] visited South Africa in May–July 2009, and before that the Lions toured [[2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand|New Zealand in 2005]].

In a break with tradition, a &quot;home&quot; fixture against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] took place at [[Millennium Stadium]] in Cardiff on 23 May 2005, before the Lions went to [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]]. It finished in a draw, 25–25.

On tour, games take place against local provinces, clubs or representative sides as well as the full tests against the host's national team.

The Lions, and their predecessor teams, have often played games against other nearby countries on tour. For example, they played [[Zimbabwe national rugby union team|Rhodesia]] (the future [[Zimbabwe]]) in [[1910 British Lions tour to South Africa|1910]], [[1924 British Lions tour to South Africa|1924]], [[1938 British Lions tour to South Africa|1938]], [[1955 British Lions tour to South Africa|1955]], [[1962 British Lions tour to South Africa|1962]], [[1968 British Lions tour to South Africa|1968]] &amp; [[1974 British Lions tour to South Africa|1974]] during their tours to South Africa. They also were beaten by [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]] on their [[1977 British Lions tour to New Zealand|1977 tour to New Zealand]]. In addition, they toured pre-independence [[Namibia]] (then [[South West Africa]]), in [[1955 British Lions tour to South Africa|1955]], [[1962 British Lions tour to South Africa|1962]], [[1968 British Lions tour to South Africa|1968]], and [[1974 British Lions tour to South Africa|1974]].

There have also been games in other countries on the way home. These include games in {{nrut|Canada}} in [[1959 British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand|1959]] and [[1966 British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand|1966]], [[East Africa rugby union team|East Africa]] (then mostly [[Kenya]], and held in [[Nairobi]]), and an unofficial game against [[Sri Lanka national rugby union team|Ceylon]] (future Sri Lanka) in [[1950 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|1950]].

===Lions Non-Tour and Home Matches===
{{Main|History of rugby union matches between the British and Irish Lions and Other Countries}}
The Lions have played a number of &quot;Home Matches&quot; against international opposition. With the exception of the 2005 Home Match against Argentina (which was played as a warm-up to the [[2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand]]), these matches have been one-offs to mark special occasions:
# The Lions played an unofficial international match in 1955 at [[Cardiff Arms Park]] against a Welsh XV to mark the 75th anniversary of the [[Welsh Rugby Union]]. The Lions won 23–14 but did not include all the big names of the 1955 tour, such as [[Tony O'Reilly]] , [[Jeff Butterfield]], Phil Davies, [[Dickie Jeeps]], [[Bryn Meredith]] and [[Jim Greenwood]], but was not bereft of great internationals such as the Newport wing Ken Jones who toured New Zealand with the Lions in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/411.php|title=Lions at Home}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# In 1977, the Lions played the [[Barbarians FC|Barbarians]] as a charity fund-raiser held as part of the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Queen's silver jubilee]] celebrations. The Baa-Baas line-up featuring JPR Williams, Gerald Davies, Gareth Edwards, Jean-Pierre Rives and Jean-Claude Skrela.
# In 1986, a match was organised against a [[Rest of the World XV]] as both a warm-up to the 1986 South Africa tour, which was subsequently cancelled, and as a celebration match to mark the [[International Rugby Board]]'s centenary. The Lions lost 15–7, but never toured.
# In 1989, [[Rob Andrew]] captained the [[British and Irish Lions XV in Paris 1989|Lions in their victory against France in Paris]]. The game formed part of the celebrations of the bi-centennial of the French Revolution.
# In 1990, a team titled the &quot;[[Four Home Unions XV|Four Home Unions]]&quot; was put together to play the &quot;[[Rest of Europe XV]]&quot;. This was a match to raise money for the rebuilding of Romania following the overthrow of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] in December 1989. The team's logo was that used by the Lions, i.e. the crests of the four home unions united in a shield. The Rest of Europe played under the symbol of the [[Federaţia Română de Rugby]].

The '''bass guitar'''&lt;ref&gt;According to the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, an &quot;Electric bass guitar [bass guitar] [is] a Guitar, usually with four heavy strings tuned E'-A'-D-G.&quot; ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; (also called '''electric bass''',&lt;ref&gt;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians defines the term ''bass'' thus: &quot;Bass (iv). A contraction of Double bass or Electric bass guitar.&quot; Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The proper term is &quot;electric bass&quot;, and it is often misnamed &quot;bass guitar&quot;, according to Tom Wheeler, ''The Guitar Book'', pp 101–2. ''Guitars'' by Evans and Evans, page 342, agrees.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although &quot;electric bass&quot; is one of the common names for the instrument, &quot;bass guitar&quot; or &quot;electric bass guitar&quot; are commonly used and some authors claim that they are historically accurate (e.g., &quot;How The Fender Bass Changed The World&quot; in the references section).&lt;/ref&gt; or simply '''bass'''; {{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|eɪ|s}}) is a [[stringed instrument]] played primarily with the [[finger]]s or [[thumb]] (by plucking, [[slapping]], popping, tapping, or thumping), or by using a [[guitar pick|pick]].

The bass guitar is similar in appearance and construction to an [[electric guitar]], but with a longer [[neck (music)|neck]] and [[scale (string instruments)|scale]] length, and four, five, or six [[strings (music)|strings]]. The four-string bass&amp;mdash;by far the most common&amp;mdash;is usually tuned the same as the [[double bass]],&lt;ref&gt;Bass guitar/Double Bass tuning E1=41.20&amp;nbsp;Hz, A1=55&amp;nbsp;Hz, D2=73.42&amp;nbsp;Hz, G2=98&amp;nbsp;Hz + optional low B0=30.87&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to pitches one [[octave]] lower than the four lower strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G).&lt;ref&gt;Standard guitar tuning E2=82.41&amp;nbsp;Hz, A2=110&amp;nbsp;Hz, D3=146.8&amp;nbsp;Hz, G3=196&amp;nbsp;Hz, B3=246.9&amp;nbsp;Hz, E4=329.6&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;/ref&gt; The bass guitar is a [[transposing instrument]], as it is notated in [[bass clef]] an octave higher than it sounds (as is the double bass) to avoid excessive [[ledger line]]s. Like the electric guitar, the bass guitar is plugged into an [[Bass instrument amplification|amplifier and speaker]] for live performances.

Since the 1950s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the double bass in [[popular music]] as the bass instrument in the [[rhythm section]]. While the types of [[bassline]]s performed by the bassist vary widely from one style of music to another, the bassist fulfills a similar role in most types of music: anchoring the harmonic framework and laying down the beat. The bass guitar is used in many styles of music including [[rock music|rock]], [[heavy metal music|metal]], [[pop music|pop]], [[punk rock]], [[country music|country]], [[blues]], and [[jazz]]. It is used as a soloing instrument in jazz, [[Jazz fusion|fusion]], [[Latin music|Latin]], [[funk]], and in some rock and [[heavy metal music|metal]] styles.

==History==
=== 1930s–1940s ===

[[Image:Paul tutmarc.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|Musical instrument inventor Paul Tutmarc outside his music store in Seattle, Washington]]
In the 1930s, musician and [[inventor]] [[Paul Tutmarc]] from [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], developed the first electric string bass in its modern form, a [[fret]]ted instrument designed to be held and played horizontally. The 1935 sales catalog for Tutmarc's electronic musical instrument company, Audiovox, featured his &quot;Model 736 Bass [[Fiddle]],&quot; a four-stringed, solid-bodied, fretted electric bass instrument with a 30½-inch scale length.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bassic.ch/i_his_av.asp Model #736 Electric Bass Fiddle] (German text)&lt;/ref&gt; The change to a &quot;guitar&quot; form made the instrument easier to hold and transport, and the addition of frets enabled bassists to play in tune more easily. Around 100 of these instruments were made during this period.

Around 1947, Tutmarc's son, Bud, began marketing a similar bass under the Serenader brand name, prominently advertised in the nationally distributed L.D. Heater Co. wholesale jobber catalogue of '48. However, the Tutmarc family inventions did not achieve market success.

===1950s===
[[Image:Fender Bass Guitar Patent.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Design patent issued to Leo Fender for the second-generation [[Precision Bass]]]]

In the 1950s, [[Leo Fender]], with the help of his employee George Fullerton, developed the first mass-produced electric bass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slog1999&quot;&gt;Slog, John J.; Coryat, Karl [ed.] (1999). ''The Bass Player Book: Equipment, Technique, Styles and Artists''. Backbeat Books. p. 154. ISBN 0879305738&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Fender Precision Bass]], introduced in 1951, became a widely copied industry standard. The Precision Bass (or &quot;P-bass&quot;) evolved from a simple, uncontoured &quot;slab&quot; body design similar to that of a [[Fender Telecaster|Telecaster]] with a [[single coil|single coil pickup]], to a contoured body design with beveled edges for comfort and a single four-pole &quot;single coil pickup.&quot; This &quot;split pickup&quot;, introduced in 1957, appears to have been two mandolin pickups (Fender was marketing a four string solid body electric mandolin at the time). Because the pole pieces of the coils were reversed with respect to each other, and the leads were also reversed with respect to each other, the two coils, wired in series, produced a [[humbucking]] effect (the same effect is achieved if the coils are wired in parallel).

The &quot;Fender Bass was a revolutionary new instrument, one that could easily be played by an electric guitarist, could be easily transported to a gig, and could be amplified to just about any volume without [[Larsen effect|feeding back]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Book review of ''How The Fender Bass Changed The World''.

''Hip Hop America''. [[Viking Press]]. p. 91. ISBN 0670971532&lt;/ref&gt; Roy Johnson, who replaced Montgomery in Hampton's band, and [[Shifty Henry]] with [[Louis Jordan]] &amp; His [[Tympany Five]], were other early Fender Bass pioneers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slog1999&quot; /&gt; [[Bill Black]], playing with [[Elvis Presley]], adopted the Fender Precision Bass around 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bacon2000&quot; /&gt;

Following Fender's lead, [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] released the [[violin]]-shaped Electric Bass with extendable end pin in 1953, allowing it to be played upright or horizontally. Gibson renamed the Electric Bass in 1958 as the [[EB-1]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage2.nifty.com/eb-1/top.html Gibson EB-1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;(The EB-1 was reissued around 1970, but this time without the end pin.) Also in 1958 Gibson released the maple arched top EB-2 described in the Gibson catalogue as ''A hollow-body electric bass that features a Bass/Baritone pushbutton for two different tonal characteristics''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vintageguitars.org.uk/EB2.php&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 these were followed by the more conventional-looking [[Gibson EB-0|EB-0 Bass]]. The EB-0 was very similar to a [[Gibson SG]] in appearance (although the earliest examples have a slab-sided body shape closer to that of the double-cutaway Les Paul Special).
[[Image:Gibson eb3 67.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Gibson EB-3]]]]
Whereas Fender basses had pickups mounted in positions in between the base of the neck and the top of the bridge, many of Gibson's early basses featured one [[humbucker|humbucking]] pickup mounted directly against the neck pocket. The [[Gibson EB-3|EB-3]], introduced in 1961, also had a &quot;mini-humbucker&quot; at the bridge position. Gibson basses also tended to be smaller, sleeker instruments; Gibson did not produce a 34&quot; scale bass until 1963 with the release of the [[Gibson Thunderbird|Thunderbird]], which was also the first Gibson bass to use dual-humbucking pickups in a more traditional position, about halfway between the neck and bridge. A small number of other companies also began manufacturing bass guitars during the 1950s: [[Kay Musical Instrument Company|Kay]] in 1952, and [[Danelectro]] in 1956;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bacon2000&quot;&gt;Bacon, Tony (2000). ''50 Years of Fender''. Backbeat Books. p. 24. ISBN 0879306211&lt;/ref&gt;

1956 saw the appearance at the German trade fair &quot;Musikmesse Frankfurt&quot; of the distinctive [[Höfner 500/1]] violin bass made using violin construction techniques by Walter [[Höfner]], a second generation violin luthier.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fuenfhunderteins.de/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is often known as the &quot;Beatle Bass&quot;, due to its endorsement by [[Paul McCartney]].

In 1957 [[Rickenbacker]] introduced the model 4000 bass,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rickresource.com/rrp/axtbassarticle2.html&lt;/ref&gt; the first bass to feature a neck-through-body design; the Fender and Gibson versions used bolt-on and glued-on necks.

===1960s===
With the explosion of the popularity of rock music in the 1960s, many more manufacturers began making electric basses.

First introduced in 1960, the [[Fender Jazz Bass]] was known as the Deluxe Bass and was meant to accompany the [[Jazzmaster]] guitar. The Jazz Bass (often referred to as a &quot;J-bass&quot;) featured two single-coil pickups, one close to the bridge and one in the Precision bass' split coil pickup position. The earliest production basses had a 'stacked' volume and tone control for each pickup. This was soon changed to the familiar configuration of a volume control for each pickup, and a single, passive tone control. The Jazz Bass' neck was narrower at the nut than the Precision bass (1½&quot; versus 1¾&quot;).
[[Image:70's Fender Jazz Bass.jpg|thumb|100px|right|1970s Fender Jazz Bass with maple fretboard]]
Another visual difference that set the Jazz Bass apart from the Precision is its &quot;offset-waist&quot; body. Pickup shapes on electric basses are often referred to as &quot;P&quot; or &quot;J&quot; pickups in reference to the visual and electrical differences between the Precision Bass and Jazz Bass [[pick up (music technology)|pickups]].
Significantly, Fender chose to label the headstock of this model with a decal noting Jazz Bass Electric Bass [http://www.vintageguitars.org.uk/adDetails/359].

Fender also began production of the [[Fender Mustang Bass|Mustang Bass]]; a 30&quot; scale length instrument used by bassists such as [[Tina Weymouth]] of [[Talking Heads]] and [[Bill Wyman]] of [[The Rolling Stones]] (&quot;P&quot; and &quot;J&quot; basses have a scale length of 34&quot;, a design echoed on most current production electric basses of all makes). In the 1950s and 1960s, the instrument was often called the &quot;Fender bass&quot;, due to [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]'s early dominance in the market.

Gibson introduced the short-scale (30.5&quot;) bass the [[Gibson EB-3]] in 1961, favoured by [[Jack Bruce]] of [[Cream (band)|Cream]].

===1970s===
[[Image:Rickenbacker Bass 4001JG.jpg|thumb|100px|left|A Rickenbacker 4001 bass.]]
The 1970s saw the founding of [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] Instruments by Tom Walker, Forrest White and Leo Fender, which produced the [[Music Man StingRay|StingRay]], the first widely produced bass with active (powered) electronics. This amounts to an impedance buffering pre-amplifier on-board the instrument to lower the output impedance of the bass's pickup circuit, increasing low-end output, and overall frequency response (more lows and highs). Specific models became identified with particular styles of music, such as the Rickenbacker 4001 series, which became identified with progressive rock bassists like [[Chris Squire]] of [[Yes (band)|Yes]], while the StingRay was used by [[Louis Johnson (bassist)|Louis Johnson]] of the funk band [[The Brothers Johnson]].

In 1971, [[Alembic Inc|Alembic]] established the template for what became known as &quot;boutique&quot; or &quot;high end&quot; electric bass guitars. These expensive, custom-tailored instruments, as used by Stanley Clarke, featured unique designs, premium hand-finished wood bodies, onboard electronics for preamplification and equalization, and innovative construction techniques such as multi-laminate [[Neck-thru|neck-through-body]] construction and graphite necks. In the mid-1970s, Alembic and other boutique bass manufacturers, such as [[Tobias (bass guitar company)|Tobias]], produced four-string and five-string basses with a low &quot;B&quot; string. In 1975, bassist [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] commissioned luthier [[Carl Thompson (luthier)|Carl Thompson]] to a six-string bass tuned (low to high) B0, E1, A1, D2, G2, C3.

===1980s–2000s===
[[Image:Steinberger bass.jpg|thumb|100px| An early 1980s-era Steinberger headless bass]]
In the 1980s, bass designers continued to explore new approaches. [[Ned Steinberger]] introduced a headless bass in 1979 and continued his innovations in the 1980s, using [[graphite]] and other new materials and (in 1984) introducing the [[TransTrem]] [[tremolo arm|tremolo bar]]. In 1987, the Guild Guitar Corporation launched the fretless [[Ashbory bass]], which used silicone rubber strings and a piezoelectric pickup to achieve a &quot;double bass&quot; sound with a short 18&quot; scale length. In the late 1980s, [[MTV Unplugged|MTV's &quot;Unplugged&quot;]] show, which featured bands performing with acoustic instruments, helped to popularize hollow-bodied [[acoustic bass guitar]]s amplified with pickups.

During the 1990s, as five-string basses became more widely available and more affordable, an increasing number of bassists in genres ranging from [[heavy metal music|metal]] to [[gospel music|gospel]] began using five-string instruments for added lower range&amp;mdash;a low &quot;B&quot; below the standard &quot;E&quot; string. Some bass players who performed a lot in a solo setting used five-string basses to get a higher range by adding a high &quot;C&quot; string as the fifth string (this is known as &quot;tenor tuning&quot;). As well, the onboard battery-powered electronics such as preamplifiers and equalizer circuits, which were previously only available on expensive &quot;boutique&quot; instruments, became increasingly available on modestly priced basses.

In the first decade of the 21st century, some bass manufacturers included [[digital signal processing|digital]] modelling circuits inside the instrument to recreate tones and sounds from many models of basses (e.g., [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6's]] Variax bass). Traditional bass designs such as the [[Fender Precision Bass]] and [[Fender Jazz Bass]] remained popular in the first decade of the 21st century; in 2006, a 60th Anniversary P-bass was introduced by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], along with the introduction of the [[Fender Jaguar Bass]].

==Design considerations==
Bass bodies are typically made of wood, although other materials such as [[graphite]] (for example, some of the [[Steinberger]] designs) have also been used. While a wide variety of [[tonewood|woods]] are suitable for use in the body, neck, and fretboard of the bass guitar, the most common type of wood used for the body is [[alder]], for the neck is [[maple]], and for the fretboard is [[rosewood (timber)|rosewood]]. Other commonly used woods include mahogany, maple, ash, and poplar for bodies, mahogany for necks, and maple and ebony for fretboards.

Other design options include finishes, such as lacquer, wax and oil; flat and carved designs; [[Luthier]]-produced custom-designed instruments; headless basses, which have tuning machines in the bridge of the instrument (e.g., [[Steinberger]] and [[Hohner]] designs) and several artificial materials such as [[luthite]]. The use of artificial materials (e.g., [[BassLab]]) allows for unique production techniques such as die-casting, to produce complex body shapes. While most basses have solid bodies, they can also include hollow chambers to increase the resonance or reduce the weight of the instrument. Some basses are built with entirely hollow bodies, which change the tone and resonance of the instrument. [[Acoustic bass guitar]]s are typically equipped with piezoelectric or magnetic pickups and amplified.

Instruments handmade by highly skilled [[lutherie|luthiers]] are becoming increasingly available. Exotic materials include woods such as [[bubinga]], [[wenge]], [[ovangkol]], [[ebony]] and [[goncalo alves]]. [[Graphite|Graphite composite]] is used to make lightweight necks&lt;ref&gt;There is a potted summary and description of graphite neck construction at http://wiki.basschat.co.uk/info:tech:use_of_composites_graphite_necks_in_bass_guitar_design.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g., [[Status brand]] basses, which are made from graphite.&lt;/ref&gt; Exotic woods are used on more expensive instruments: for example, Alembic uses cocobolo as a body or top layer material because of its attractive grain. Warwick bass guitars are also well-known for exotic hardwoods: most of the necks are made of ovangkol, and the fingerboards wenge or ebony. Solid bubinga bodies are also used for tonal and aesthetic qualities.

The &quot;long scale&quot; necks used on Leo Fender's basses, giving a [[scale length]] (distance between [[nut (string instrument)|nut]] and [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]]) of 34&quot;, remain the standard for electric basses. However, 30&quot; or &quot;short scale&quot; instruments, such as the [[Höfner 500/1]] &quot;violin bass&quot; played by [[Paul McCartney]], and the [[Fender Mustang Bass]] are popular, especially for players with smaller hands. While 35&quot;, 35.5&quot; and 36&quot; scale lengths were once only available in &quot;boutique&quot; instruments, in the first decade of the 21st century, many manufacturers have begun offering these lengths, also called an &quot;extra long scale.&quot; This extra long scale provides a higher string tension, which yields a more defined tone on the low &quot;B&quot; string of five- and six-stringed instruments (or detuned four-string basses).

===Fretted and fretless basses===
[[Image:Flatwound 01.JPG|thumb|170px|right|A fretless bass with flatwound strings; note the markers inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch.]]
Another design consideration for the bass is whether to use [[fret]]s on the fingerboard. On a fretted bass, the frets divide the fingerboard into [[semitone]] divisions (as on a guitar). The original Fender basses had 20 frets, but modern basses may have 24 or more. [[Fretless guitar|Fretless bass]]es have a distinct sound, because the absence of frets means that the string must be pressed down directly onto the wood of the fingerboard as with the [[double bass]]. The string buzzes against the wood and is somewhat muted because the sounding portion of the string is in direct contact with the flesh of the player's finger. The fretless bass allows players to use the expressive devices of [[glissando]], [[vibrato]] and microtonal intonations such as [[quarter tone]]s and [[just intonation]].

[[File:Weather Report2 (Jaco Pastorius).jpg|thumb|240px|left|Pastorius, Convocation Hall, Toronto&lt;br /&gt;Nov. 27, 1977 Photo: Jean-Luc Ourlin]]
Some bassists use both fretted and fretless basses in performances, according to the type of material they are performing, as with [[Pino Palladino]], whose performance on the fretless bass during the 1980s made him a highly desirable [[session musician|session player]] backing high profile musicians that included [[Eric Clapton]] and [[David Gilmour]]. However, the late 1990s showed a shift toward fretted basses as well, as he branched out into a wide variety of [[genres]]. While fretless basses are often associated with [[jazz]] and [[jazz fusion]], bassists from other genres use fretless basses, such as metal bassist [[Steve DiGiorgio]] and [[Colin Edwin]] of modern/progressive rock band [[Porcupine Tree]].

The first fretless bass guitar was made by [[Bill Wyman]] in 1961 when he converted an inexpensive Japanese fretted bass by removing the frets.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Jim (2001). 'How The Fender Bass Changed the World' or Jon Sievert interview with Bill Wyman, guitar player magazine December (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This fretless bass can be heard on [[The Rolling Stones]] songs such as &quot;Paint it Black&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The first production fretless bass was the [[Ampeg]] AUB-1 introduced in 1966, and Fender introduced a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]] created his own fretless bass by removing the frets&lt;ref&gt;In interviews, Pastorius gave various versions of how he accomplished this; the versions mention the use of [[pliers]], a [[putty knife]], and, in at least one interview (''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine, 1984) he states that he bought the instrument with the frets already removed, badly, with the slots where the frets once were not yet filled in.&lt;/ref&gt; from a Fender Jazz Bass, filling the holes with wood putty, and coating the fretboard with epoxy resin.&lt;ref&gt;Pastorius used epoxy rather than varnish to obtain a glass-like finish suitable for the use of roundwound strings, which are otherwise much harder on the wood of the fingerboard.&lt;/ref&gt; Some fretless basses have &quot;fret line&quot; markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck.

Tapewound (double bass type) and flatwound strings are sometimes used with the fretless bass so the metal string windings don't wear down the [[fingerboard]]. Some fretless basses have epoxy coated fingerboards to increase the fingerboard' durability, enhance [[sustain (music)|sustain]], and give a brighter tone. Although most fretless basses have four strings, five-string and six-string fretless basses are also available. Fretless basses with more than six strings are also available as &quot;boutique&quot; or custom-made instruments.

===Strings and tuning===
{{Main|Bass guitar tuning}}
[[Image:Bass guitar headstock.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|The tuning machines are mounted on the back of the headstock on the bass guitar neck; note the spiral metal [[worm gear]]s.]]
The standard design for the electric bass guitar has four [[strings (music)|strings]], tuned E, A, D and G, in fourths such that the open highest string, G, is an eleventh (an octave and a fourth) below middle C, making the tuning of all four strings the same as that of the [[double bass]]. This tuning is also the same as the standard tuning on the lower four strings on a six-string guitar, only an octave lower. String types include all-metal strings ([[Strings_(music)#Roundwound|roundwound]], [[Strings_(music)#Flatwound|flatwound]], [[Strings_(music)#Halfwound.2C_ground_wound.2C_pressure_wound|halfwound, ground wound, and pressure wound]]); as well as metal strings with different coverings, such as tapewound and plastic-coatings. The variety of materials used in the strings gives bass players a range of tonal options. In the 1950s and early 1960s, bassists mostly used flatwound strings with a smooth surface, which had a smooth, damped sound reminiscent of a double bass. In the late 1960s and 1970s, roundwound bass strings similar to guitar strings became popular, though flatwounds also continue to be popular. Roundwounds have a brighter [[timbre]] with greater [[sustain (music)|sustain]] than flatwounds.

A number of other tuning options and bass types have been used to extend the range of the instrument. The most common are four, five, or six strings:
[[Image:washburn xb600.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Washburn Guitars|Washburn]] XB600, a six string bass]]
* '''Four strings''' with alternative tunings to obtain an extended lower range.&lt;ref&gt;Tunings such as &quot;BEAD&quot; (this requires a low &quot;B&quot; string in addition to the other three &quot;standard&quot; strings), &quot;[[Drop D tuning|D-A-D-G]]&quot; (a &quot;standard&quot; set of strings, with only the lowest string detuned), and D-G-C-F or C-G-C-F (a &quot;standard&quot; set of strings, all of which are detuned) give bassists an extended lower range. A tenor bass tuning of &quot;A-D-G-C&quot; provides a higher range.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuning in fifths e.g., CGDA gives an extended upper and lower range.[[Image:Bassguitarnotes.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Note positions on a right-handed four-string bass in standard EADG tuning. The dots below the frets are often inlaid into the wood of bass necks, as a visual aid to help the player find different positions.]]
* '''Five strings''' usually tuned B0-E1-A1-D2-G2, which provides extended lower range. Five string basses tuned to B-E-A-D-G (and sometimes A-D-G-C-F) are often used in contemporary [[hard rock|rock]] and [[heavy metal music|metal]] alongside [[seven string guitars]], [[baritone guitar]]s, and otherwise downtuned instruments. Another common tuning used on early five-string basses is E-A-D-G-C, known as &quot;tenor tuning&quot;. This is still a popular tuning for jazz and solo bass. Other tunings such as C-E-A-D-G are used though rare. The fifth string provides a greater lower range (if a low B or A is used) or a greater upper range (if a high C string is added) than the four-string bass, and gives access to more notes for any given hand position. The earliest five string was created by [[Fender]] in 1965. The [[Fender Bass V]] had the E-A-D-G-C tuning, but was unpopular and discontinued in 1970. The common low B five string was created by [[Jimmy Johnson (bassist)|Jimmy Johnson]] as a custom instrument in 1975. He bought a EADGC 5-string [[Alembic Inc|Alembic]] bass, replaced the nut, and used a new, thick low B string from [[GHS (strings)|GHS]] to accommodate the instrument accordingly. [[Steinberger]] made a 5-string headless instrument called the L-2/5 in 1982, and later [[Yamaha]] offered the first production model as the BB5000 in 1984.
* '''Six strings''' are usually tuned B0-E1-A1-D2-G2-C3&amp;mdash;like a four-string bass with an additional low &quot;B&quot; string and a high &quot;C&quot; string. Some players prefer B0-E1-A1-D2-F{{music|sharp}}2-B3, which preserves the intervals of standard guitar tuning and makes the highest and lowest string the same note two octaves apart. While less common than four or five-string basses, they appear in Latin, jazz, and other genres, as well as in studio work where a single instrument must be highly versatile. Alternative tunings for six-string bass include B-E-A-D-G-B, matching the first five strings of an acoustic or electric guitar, and EADGBE, completely matching the tuning of a six-string guitar but one octave lower allowing the use of guitar chord fingerings. Rarer tunings such as EADGCF and F#BEADG provide a lower or higher range in a given position while maintaining consistent string intervals. The original six-string bass was the LongHorn6, created by Danelectro in 1958, as a guitar tuned down an octave (EADGBE). In 1974, [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] worked with [[Carl Thompson (luthier)|Carl Thompson]] to create the Contrabass guitar (BEADGC). Later, Jackson brought his ideas to [[Fodera]] in cooperation with Ken Smith to create a wider-spaced Contrabass guitar, which evolved to the modern six-string bass.
* '''[[Detuner]]s,''' such as the [[Hipshot]], are mechanical devices operated by the thumb on the fretting hand that allow one or more strings to be quickly detuned to a pre-set lower pitch. Hipshots are typically used to drop the &quot;E&quot;-string down to &quot;D&quot; on a four string bass.&lt;ref&gt;Hipshots are similarly used to drop the &quot;B&quot;-string down to a &quot;B♭&quot; on five or six string basses where it is advantageous when accompanying brass bands whose music is commonly in the key of &quot;B♭&quot;. More rarely, some bassists (e.g., Michael Manring) add detuners to more than one string, or even more than one detuner to each string, to enable them to detune strings during a performance and have access to a wider range of chime-like harmonics.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative range approaches====
[[Image:7String.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A seven-string fretless bass]]
Some bassists have used other types of tuning methods to obtain an extended range or other benefits such as providing multiple octaves of notes at any given position, as well as a significantly larger tonal range. Instrument types or tunings used for this purpose include '''basses with fewer than four strings''' (one-string bass guitars,&lt;ref&gt;Japanese manufacturer Atlansia offers one-, two- and three-stringed instruments [http://www.atlansia.jp/BASS.NEW.HTML#P8]&lt;/ref&gt; two-string bass guitars, three-string bass guitars [tuned to E-A-D])&lt;ref&gt;Session bassist [[Tony Levin]] commissioned [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] to build a three-string version of his favorite [[Music Man StingRay|Stingray bass]]&lt;/ref&gt; '''alternative tunings''' (e.g., tenor bass,&lt;ref&gt;Tuned A-D-G-C, like the top 4 strings of a six-string bass, or simply a standard four-string with the strings each tuned up an additional perfect fourth. Tenor bass is a tuning used by [[Stanley Clarke]], [[Victor Wooten]], and [[Stu Hamm]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[piccolo bass]],&lt;ref&gt;Tuned &quot;e-a-d-g&quot; (an octave higher than standard bass tuning&amp;mdash;the same as the bottom four strings of a guitar). This is used by jazz fusion bassists such as [[Stanley Clarke]].&lt;/ref&gt; and guitar-tuned basses)&lt;ref&gt;The D-G-B-E tuning matches the first four strings (from highest to lowest) of a guitar, pitched two octaves lower.&lt;/ref&gt; and '''8, 10, 12 and 15-string''' basses, which are built on the same principle as the [[12 string|12-string guitar]], where the strings are grouped into &quot;courses&quot; tuned in unison or octaves, to be played simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;For example, an eight-string bass is strung Ee-Aa-Dd-Gg, while a 12-string bass might be tuned Eee-Aaa-Ddd-Ggg (four courses of three strings each). In the case of the 12-string, the standard pitch strings are augmented by two strings both an octave higher than the standard pitched string. Ten-string basses have octave strings added to the low-B of a five-string bass. A 15-string bass (tuned Eee Aaa Ddd Ggg Ccc) was developed by [http://www.jauqoiii-x.com/ Jauqo III-X] and produced by Warrior Guitars(the 15 string bass made for Jauqo III-X by Warrior was the world's first 15-string bass guitar ever made. A 1998 video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6O0Lgyn6aE )&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Extended-range bass|'''Extended Range Basses''']] (ERBs) are basses with between six and twelve strings&amp;mdash;with the additional strings used for range rather than unison or octave pairs. A seven-string bass (B0-E1-A1-D2-G2-C3-F3) was built by luthier Michael Tobias in 1987. This instrument, commissioned by bassist Garry Goodman, was an early example of a bass with more than six single course strings. Conklin builds eight- and nine-string basses.&lt;ref&gt;These have a low &quot;F#&quot; string below the &quot;B&quot; string, and the nine-string bass adds a low &quot;F#&quot; and a high &quot;B♭&quot; string.&lt;/ref&gt; The Guitarbass is a ten-string instrument with four bass strings (tuned E-A-D-G) and six guitar strings (tuned E-A-D-G-B-E).&lt;ref&gt;The guitarbass has 10 strings on the same neck and body, but with separate scale lengths, bridges, fretboards, and pickups. It was created [http://www.microphoneheaven.com/guitarbass] by John Woolley in 2005, based on a prototype built by David Minnieweather.&lt;/ref&gt;

Luthier Michael Adler built the first 11-string bass in 2004 and completed the first single-course 12-string bass in 2005. Adler's 11- and 12-string instruments have the same range as a grand piano.&lt;ref&gt;The Adler 12-string has the same range as the Bösendorfer 290 grand piano with 97 notes. This was made possible by Goodman developing an Ab4 string for the 32&quot; scale.&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-contra basses, such as C#-F#-B-E (&quot;C#&quot; being at 17.32&amp;nbsp;Hz (C♯0))&lt;ref&gt;(e.g., the Jauqo III-X from 2000 or the sub-bass guitar, E-A-D-G one octave below standard (&quot;E&quot; being at 20.6&amp;nbsp;Hz)&lt;/ref&gt; have been created. [[Ibanez]] had released SR7VIISC in 2009, featuring a 30&quot; scale and narrower width, and tuned as B-E-A-D-G-C-E; the company dubbed it a cross between bass and guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibanezrules.com/namm/2009/sr7.htm |title=IBANEZ RULES!! NAMM 2009 SR7 |publisher=Ibanezrules.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yves Carbonne developed 10 and 12 string fretless sub-bass guitars.&lt;ref&gt;These extended range sub-basses, Legend X YC and Legend XII YC, were built by luthier from Barcelona [http://www.jerzydrozdbasses.com/ Jerzy Drozd]. The 12 string Legend XII YC uses a new B string tuned at 15,4 hertz.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bass-musician-magazine.com/General/bass-musician-magazine-masthead-detail.asp?directory-id=807599636 Bass Musician Magazine: Yves Carbonne]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bass-musician-magazine.com/General/bass-musician-magazine-detail.asp?year=2008&amp;month=6&amp;article-id=613057319 Bass Musician Magazine Article: &quot;Why Fretless?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pickups and amplification==
:''For more information on pickups, see [[Pick up (music technology)]].''

===Magnetic pickups===
Most electric bass guitars use magnetic pickups. The vibrations of the instrument's metal strings within the magnetic field of the permanent magnets in magnetic [[pick up (music technology)|pickups]] produce small variations in the magnetic flux threading the coils of the pickups. This in turn produces small electrical voltages in the coils. These low-level signals are then amplified and played through a speaker. Since the 1980s, basses are often available with battery-powered &quot;active&quot; electronics that boost the signal, provide equalization controls to boost or cut bass and treble frequencies, or both.

Less commonly, non-magnetic pickups are used, such as [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] pickups. Piezoelectric pickups don't interact directly with the string like a magnetic pickup, but convert any mechanical vibration to a signal. They are typically mounted under the bridge saddle, or near the bridge, and require a preamplifier for optimum sound.

[[Image:Jazz Style PickUps.JPG|thumb|Dual &quot;J&quot;-style pickups|230px|left]]
* '''&quot;Jazz&quot; pickups''' (referring to the original Fender Jazz Bass), also referred to as &quot;J pickups&quot;, are wider eight-pole pickups that lie underneath all four strings. J pickups are typically [[single-coil]] designs, although there are a large number of humbucking designs. As with the halves of the P-pickups, the J-pickups are reverse-wound with reverse magnetic polarity. As a result they have hum canceling properties when used at the same volume, with hum cancellation decreasing when the pickups are used at unequal volume and altogether absent when each pickup is used individually. 'J' Style pickups tend to have a lower output and a thinner sound than 'P' Style pickups making it perfect for most rock music. Many bassists choose to combine a 'J' pickup at the bridge and a 'P' pickup at the neck, to be 'blended' together for a unique sound.
* '''&quot;Precision&quot; pickups''' (which refers to the original Fender Precision Bass), which are also referred to as &quot;P pickups&quot;, are actually two distinct [[single-coil]] pickups. Each is offset a small amount along the length of the body so that each half is underneath two strings. The pickups are reverse-wound with reversed magnetic polarity to reduce hum. This makes the 'P' pickup a [humbucking] single coil pickup, something almost unique to the 'P' style pickup. Less common is the single-coil &quot;P&quot; pickup, used on the original 1951 Fender Precision bass.&lt;ref&gt;This is also known as the 'Vintage P' due to it being found on vintage basses before the invention of the split coil pickup. The single-coil &quot;P&quot; pickup is also used in the reissue and the Sting signature model.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''&quot;Dual Coil&quot; ([[Humbucker]]) pickups''', also known as &quot;DC pickups&quot;, have two signal producing coils that are reverse wound around opposed polarity magnets (similar in principle to the two individual J-pickups). This significantly reduces noise from interference compared to single coil pickups. Humbuckers also often produce a higher output level than single coil pickups. Dual coil pickups come in two main varieties; ceramic or ceramic and steel. Ceramic only magnets have a relatively harsher sound than their ceramic and steel counterparts, and are thus used more commonly in heavier rock styles.
** A well-known bass humbucker is the pickup used on the Music Man series of basses; it has two coils, each with four large polepieces. This style is known as the &quot;MM&quot; pickup for this reason, and many aftermarket pickup manufacturers and custom builders incorporate these pickups. The most common configurations are a single pickup at the bridge, two pickups similar in placement to a Jazz Bass, or an MM pickup at the bridge with a single-coil pickup (often a &quot;J&quot;) at the neck. These pickups can often be &quot;tapped&quot;, meaning one of the two coils can be essentially turned off, giving a sound similar to a single-coil pickup.
* '''&quot;Soapbar&quot; Pickups''' are so-named due to their resemblance to a bar of soap and originally referred to the Gibson [[P-90]] guitar pickup. The term is also used to describe any pickup with a rectangular shape and no visible pole pieces; most of the pickups falling into this category are humbucking. They are commonly found in basses designed for the rock and metal genres, such as [[Gibson]], [[ESP Guitars]], and [[Schecter Guitar Research|Schecter]]. 'Soapbar pickups' are also called 'extended housing'.

Many basses have just one pickup, typically a &quot;P&quot; or soapbar pickup. Multiple pickups are also quite common, two of the most common configurations being a &quot;P&quot; near the neck and a &quot;J&quot; near the bridge (e.g., Fender Precision Bass Special, Fender Precision Bass Plus), or two &quot;J&quot; pickups (e.g., Fender Jazz). A two-&quot;soapbar&quot; configuration is also very common, especially on basses by makes such as [[Ibanez]] and [[Yamaha]]. A combination of a J or other single-coil pickup at the neck and a Music Man-style humbucker in the bridge has become popular among boutique builders, giving a very bright, focused tone that is good for jazz and thumbstyle.

Some basses use more unusual pickup configurations, such as a soapbar and a &quot;P&quot; pickup (found on some Fenders), [[Stu Hamm]]'s &quot;Urge&quot; basses, which have a &quot;P&quot; pickup sandwiched between two &quot;J&quot; pickups, and some of [[Bootsy Collins]]' custom basses, which had as many as 5 J pickups. Another unusual pickup configuration is found on some of the custom basses that [[Billy Sheehan]] uses, in which there is one humbucker at the neck and a split-coil pickup at the middle position.

The placement of the pickup greatly affects the sound. A pickup near the neck joint emphasizes the fundamental and low-order harmonics and thus produces a deeper, bassier sound, while a pickup near the bridge emphasizes higher-order harmonics and makes a &quot;tighter&quot; or &quot;sharper&quot; sound. Usually basses with multiple pickups allow blending of the output from the pickups, with electrical and acoustical interactions between the two pickups (such as partial phase cancellations) allowing a range of tonal effects.

===Non-magnetic pickups===
The use of non-magnetic pickups allows bassists to use non-ferrous strings such as nylon, brass or even [[Ashbory bass|silicone rubber]], which create different tones.
* [[piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] pickups (also called &quot;piezo&quot; pickups) are non-magnetic pickups that use a [[transducer]] crystal to convert the vibrations produced by the string into an electrical signal. They produce a different tone from magnetic pickups, often similar to that of an acoustic bass. Piezo pickups are often used in acoustic bass guitars.
* [[Pick up (music technology)#Optical|Optical pickups]] are another type of non-magnetic pickup. They use an infrared [[LED]] to optically track the movement of the string, which allows them to reproduce low-frequency tones at high volumes without the &quot;hum&quot; or excessive resonance associated with conventional magnetic pickups. Since optical pickups do not pick up high frequencies or percussive sounds well, they are commonly paired with piezoelectric pickups to fill in the missing frequencies. LightWave Systems builds basses with optical pickups.

===Amplification and effects===
{{Main|Bass instrument amplification}}
[[Image:Elbas.jpg|thumb|right|150px|This amplification setup is a &quot;bass stack&quot; approach, in which an amplifier (in this case a Hartke 5000) is plugged into separate speaker cabinets.]]
Like the [[electric guitar]], the electric bass guitar is often connected to an amplifier and a speaker with a [[patch cord]] for live performances. Electric bassists use either a &quot;combo&quot; amplifier, which combines an amplifier and a speaker in a single cabinet, or an amplifier and a separate speaker cabinet (or cabinets). In some cases when the bass is being used with large-scale [[Public Address|PA]] amplification, it is plugged into a [[DI unit|&quot;DI&quot;]] or &quot;direct box&quot;, which routes their signal directly into a [[mixing console]], and thence to the main and monitor speakers. Recording may use a microphone setup for the amplified signal, a direct box feeding the recording console or a mix of both.

Various electronic [[bass effects]] such as [[preamplifier]]s, &quot;stomp box&quot;-style pedals and [[wikt:signal|signal]] processors and the configuration of the [[amplifier]] and [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] can be used to alter the basic sound of the instrument. In the 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century, signal processors such as [[Equalization filter|equalizer]]s, [[Distortion (music)|overdrive]] devices, and [[Audio level compression|compressors]] or [[limiter]]s became increasingly popular. Modulation effects like chorus, flanging, phase shifting, and time effects such as delay and looping are less commonly used with bass than with electric guitar, but they are used in some styles of music.

==Playing techniques==
===Sitting or standing===
Most bass players stand while playing, although sitting is also accepted, particularly in large ensemble settings, such as jazz big bands or in acoustic genres such as folk music. Some bassists, such as [[Jah Wobble]], will alternate between standing or seated playing. It is a matter of the player's preference as to which position gives the greatest ease of playing and what a bandleader expects. When sitting, right-handed players can balance the instrument on the right thigh or like classical guitar players, the left. Balancing the bass on the left thigh usually positions it in such a way that it mimics the standing position, allowing for less difference between the standing and sitting positions. Balancing the bass on the right thigh provides better access to the neck and fretboard in its entirety, especially lower frets.

===Performing techniques===

[[Image:Victor Wooten 2.jpg|thumb|left|225 px|Bassist [[Victor Wooten]] performs in a bass trio called [[SMV (band)|SMV]] with [[Stanley Clarke]] and [[Marcus Miller]]. ]]
[[File:JWobbleseated.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bassist [[Jah Wobble]] frequently plays while seated]]
In contrast to the upright bass (or double bass), the electric bass guitar is played horizontally across the body, like an electric guitar. When the strings are plucked with the fingers ([[pizzicato]]), the index and middle fingers (and sometimes with the thumb, ring, and pinky fingers as well) are used. [[James Jamerson]], an influential bassist from the [[Motown]] era, played intricate bass lines using only his index finger, which he called &quot;The Hook.&quot; There are also variations in how a bassist chooses to rest the right-hand thumb (or left thumb in the case of left-handed players). A player may rest his or her thumb on the top edge of one of the pickups or on the side of the fretboard, which is especially common among bassists who have an upright bass influence. Some bassists anchor their thumbs on the lowest string and move it off to play on the low string. Alternatively, the thumb can be rested loosely on the strings to mute the unused strings.

The string can be plucked at any point between the bridge and the point where the fretting hand is holding down the string; different [[timbre]]s are produced depending on where along the string it is plucked. Some players are known for plucking near the bridge where the string is most taut, such as jazz fusion bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]], whereas other bassists prefer the &quot;looser&quot; part of the string nearer to the fingerboard.

Bassists trying to emulate the sound of a double bass sometimes pluck the strings with their thumb and use [[palm mute|palm-muting]] to create a short, &quot;thumpy&quot; tone. The late [[Monk Montgomery]] (who played in Lionel Hampton's band) and [[Bruce Palmer]] (who performed with [[Buffalo Springfield]]) use thumb downstrokes. The use of the thumb was acknowledged by early Fender models, which came with a &quot;thumbrest&quot; or &quot;Tug Bar&quot; attached to the pickguard below the strings. Contrary to its name, this was not used to rest the thumb, but to provide leverage while using the thumb to pluck the strings. The thumbrest was moved above the strings in 1970s models and eliminated in the 1980s.

==== &quot;Slap and pop&quot; ====
{{Main|Slapping}}
The [[Slapping|slap and pop]] method, or &quot;thumbstyle&quot;, most associated with [[funk music|funk]], uses tones and percussive sounds achieved by striking, thumping, or &quot;slapping&quot; a string with the thumb and snapping (or &quot;popping&quot;) a string or strings with the index or middle fingers. Bassists often interpolate left hand-muted &quot;dead notes&quot; between the slaps and pops to achieve a rapid percussive effect, and after a note is slapped or popped, the fretting hand may cause other notes to sound by using &quot;[[hammer on]]s&quot;, &quot;[[pull off]]s&quot;, or a left-hand [[glissando]] (slide). [[Larry Graham]] of [[Sly and the Family Stone]] and [[Graham Central Station]] was an early innovator of the slap style, and [[Louis Johnson (bassist)|Louis Johnson]] of [[The Brothers Johnson]] is also credited as an early slap bass player.

Slap and pop style is also used by many bassists in other genres, such as rock (e.g., [[J J Burnel]] and [[Les Claypool]]), metal (e.g., [[Eric Langlois]], [[Martin Mendez]], [[Fieldy]] and [[Ryan Martinie]]), and fusion (e.g., [[Marcus Miller]], [[Victor Wooten]] and [[Alain Caron (bass player)|Alain Caron]]). Slap style playing was popularized throughout the 1980s and early 1990s by pop bass players such as [[Mark King (musician)|Mark King]] (from [[Level 42]]) and rock bassists such as with [[Pino Palladino]] (currently a member of the [[John Mayer Trio]] and bassist for [[The Who]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;BassMag1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bassplayer.com/article/pino-palladino/nov-06/23886|title=The Master Stylist|last=Jisi |first=Chris|year=2006|work=Bass Player Magazine Online Edition|publisher= New Bay Media, LLC|accessdate=2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Flea (musician)|Flea]] (from the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]) and [[Alex Katunich]] (from [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]]). [[Spank bass]] developed from the slap and pop style and treats the electric bass as a percussion instrument, striking the strings above the pickups with an open palmed hand. Wooten popularized the &quot;double thump,&quot; in which the string is slapped twice, on the upstroke and a downstroke (for more information, see [[Classical Thump]]). A rarely used playing technique related to slapping is the use of wooden [[dowel]] &quot;[[funk fingers]]&quot;, an approach popularized by [[Tony Levin]].

[[Image:Flea in skeleton t-shirt.jpg|thumb|200px| [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] from the funk-rock band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] is known for his use of percussive slapping techniques. ]]

====Picking techniques====
The [[Guitar pick|pick]] (or [[plectrum]]) is used to obtain a more articulate attack, for speed, or just personal preference. Although the use of a pick is primarily associated with [[rock music|rock]] and [[punk rock]], picks are also used in other styles. Jazz bassist [[Steve Swallow]] uses a pick for upbeat or funky songs while [[Pink Floyd]] bassist [[Roger Waters]] uses one for a heavier tone. Picks can be used with alternating downstrokes and upstrokes, or with all downstrokes for a more consistent attack. The pick is usually held with the index and thumb, with the up-and-down plucking motion supplied by the wrist.

There are many varieties of picks available, but due to the thicker, heavier strings of the electric bass, bassists tend to use heavier picks than those used for electric guitar, typically ranging from 1.14&amp;nbsp;mm–3.00&amp;nbsp;mm (3.00 is unusual). Different materials are used for picks, including plastic, nylon, and felt, all of which produce different tones. Felt picks are used to emulate a fingerstyle tone.

====Palm-muting techniques====
Palm-muting is a widely used bass technique. The outer edge of the palm of the picking hand is rested on the bridge while picking, and “mutes” the strings, shortening the sustain time. The harder the palm presses, or the more string area that is contacted by the palm, the shorter the string’s sustain. The sustain of the picked note can be varied for each note or phrase. The shorter sustain of a muted note on an electric bass can be used to imitate the shorter sustain and character of an upright bass. Palm-muting is commonly done while using a pick, but can also be done without a pick, as when doing down-strokes with the thumb.

One prominent example of the pick/palm-muting combination is [[Paul McCartney]], who has consistently used this technique for decades. [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] also uses palm-muting; but often does so without a pick, using the thumb and first finger to pluck.

====Fretting techniques====

The fretting hand&amp;mdash;the left hand for right-handed bass players and the right hand for left-handed bass players&amp;mdash;is used to press down the strings to play different notes and shape the tone or timbre of a plucked or picked note. The fundamental technique used in the fretting hand is known as &quot;a finger per fret&quot;, where each finger in the fretting hand plays one fret in a given position.&lt;ref&gt;http://basslessonsunlimited.com/Riley_Hagan.html&lt;/ref&gt; The fretting hand can be used to change a sounded note, either by fully muting it after it is plucked or picked to shorten its duration or by partially muting it near the bridge to reduce the volume of the note, or make the note die away faster. The fretting hand is often used to mute strings that are not being played and stop the sympathetic vibrations, particularly when the player wants a &quot;dry&quot; or &quot;focused&quot; sound. On the other hand, the sympathetic resonance of harmonically related strings may be desired for some songs, such as ballads. In these cases, a bassist can fret harmonically related notes. For example, while fretting a sustained &quot;F&quot; (on the third fret of the &quot;D&quot; string), underneath an F major chord being played by a piano player, a bassist might hold down the &quot;C&quot; and low &quot;F&quot; below this note so their harmonics sound sympathetically.

The fretting hand can add [[vibrato]] to a plucked or picked note, either a gentle, narrow vibrato or a more exaggerated, wide vibrato with bigger pitch variations. For fretted basses, vibrato is always an alternation between the pitch of the note and a slightly higher pitch. For fretless basses, the player can use this style of vibrato, or they can alternate between the note and a slightly lower pitch. While vibrato is mostly done on [[stopped note|&quot;stopped&quot; notes]]&amp;mdash;that is, notes that are pressed down on the fingerboard&amp;mdash;open strings can also be vibratoed by pressing down on the string behind the nut. As well, the fretting hand can be used to &quot;bend&quot; a plucked or picked note up in pitch. To create the opposite effect, a &quot;bend down&quot;, the string is pushed to a higher pitch before being plucked or picked and then allowed to fall to the lower, regular pitch after it is sounded. Though rare, some bassists may use a [[tremolo bar]]-equipped bass to produce the same effect.

[[File:Iron Maiden 027.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Bassist [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] of [[Iron Maiden]] is known for his fast bass &quot;gallops&quot;]]

In addition to pressing down one note at a time, bassists can also press down several notes at one time with their fretting hand to perform a chord. While chords are used less often by bassists than by electric guitarists, a variety of chords can be performed on the electric bass, especially with instruments with higher ranges such as six-string basses. Another variation to fully pressing down a string is to gently graze the string with the finger at the [[harmonic]] node points on the string, which creates chime-like upper partials. [[Glissando]] is an effect in which the fretting hand slides up or down the neck. A subtle glissando can be performed by moving the fretting hand without plucking or picking the string; for a more pronounced effect, the string is plucked or picked first, or, in a metal or hardcore punk context, a pick may be scraped along the sides of the strings.

The fretting hand can also be used to sound notes, either by [[pizzicato|plucking an open string]] with the fretting hand, or, in the case of a string that has already been plucked or picked, by [[hammer on|&quot;hammering on&quot;]] a higher pitch or [[pull off|&quot;pulling off&quot;]] a finger to pluck a lower fretted or open stringed note. Jazz bassists use a subtle form of fretting hand pizzicato by plucking a very brief open string [[grace note]] with the fretting hand right before playing the string with the plucking hand. When a string is rapidly hammered on, the note can be prolonged into a [[trill (music)|trill]].

=====Two-handed tapping=====
[[Image:Bass Guitar Tapping.JPG|thumb|right|170px|A bassist performing tapping, in which notes are sounded by striking the strings against the fretboard]]
In the two-handed [[tapping]] styles, bassists use both hands to play notes on the fretboard by rapidly pressing and holding the string to the fret. Instead of plucking or picking the string to create a sound, in this technique, the action of striking the string against the fret or the fretboard creates the sound. Since two hands can be used to play on the fretboard, this makes it possible to play interweaving [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] lines, to simultaneously play a bassline and a simple chord, or play [[Guitar chord|chords]] and arpeggios. Bassist [[John Entwistle]] of [[The Who]] tapped percussively on the strings, causing them to strike the fretboard with a twangy sound to create drum-style [[fill (music)|fills]]. Players noted for this technique include [[Billy Sheehan]], [[Stuart Hamm]], [[John Myung]], [[Victor Wooten]], [[Les Claypool]], [[Mark King]] and [[Michael Manring]]. The [[Chapman Stick]] and [[Warr Guitars]] are string instruments specifically designed to be played using two-handed tapping.

==Uses==
===Popular music===
[[Popular music]] bands and rock groups use the bass guitar as a member of the [[rhythm section]], which provides the [[chord (music)|chord]] sequence or &quot;[[Chord progression|progression]]&quot; and sets out the &quot;[[beat (music)|beat]]&quot; for the song. The rhythm section typically consists of a [[rhythm guitar]]ist or [[electric keyboard]] player, or both, a bass guitarist and a [[drummer]]; larger groups may add additional guitarists, keyboardists, or percussionists.
[[File:RobertTrujillo.jpg|thumb|left|150 px|Bassist [[Robert Trujillo]] performing with metal band [[Metallica]]]]
The types of [[bassline]]s performed by the bass guitarist vary widely from one style of music to another. Despite all of the differences in the styles of bassline, in most styles of popular music, the bass guitarist fulfills a similar role: anchoring the harmonic framework (often by emphasizing the roots of the chord progression) and laying down the beat (in collaboration with the drummer). The importance of the bass guitarist and the bass line varies in different styles of music. In some pop styles, such as 1980s-era pop and musical theater, the bass sometimes plays a relatively simple part, and the music forefronts the vocals and melody instruments. In contrast, in [[reggae]], funk, or hip-hop, entire songs may be centered on the bass groove, and the bassline is usually very prominent in the mix.

In traditional [[country music]], [[folk rock]], and related styles, the bass often plays the roots and fifth of each chord in alternation. In Chicago [[blues]], the electric bass often performs a [[walking bass]]line made up of scales and arpeggios. In [[blues rock]] bands, the bassist often plays [[blues scale]]-based riffs and chugging [[boogie]]-style lines. In [[heavy metal music|metal]], the bass guitar may perform complex [[riff]]s along with the rhythm guitarist or play a low, rumbling [[pedal point]] to anchor the group's sound.

The bass guitarist sometimes breaks out of the strict rhythm section role to perform [[bass run|bass breaks]] or bass solos. The types of basslines used for bass breaks or bass solos vary by style. In a rock band, a bass break may consist of the bassist playing a [[riff]] or [[lick (music)|lick]] during a pause in the song. In some styles of metal, a bass break may consist of &quot;[[shred guitar]]&quot;-style [[tapping]] on the bass. In a [[funk]] or funk rock band, a bass solo may showcase the bassist's percussive [[slap and pop]] playing. In genres such as [[progressive rock]], [[art rock]], or [[progressive metal]], the bass guitar player may play [[melody]] lines along with the [[lead guitar]] (or vocalist) and perform extended [[guitar solo]]s. Other contemporary musicians such as [[Edo Castro]] have taken the electric bass, including 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 &amp; 9 strings, into a new and evolving genre centered entirely around the bass itself.

===Jazz and jazz fusion===
[[File:Five Peace Band.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Double bassist and electric bassist [[Christian McBride]] performing in the jazz group &quot;Five Peace Band&quot; in 2008]]
The electric bass is a relative newcomer to the world of [[jazz]]. The [[big band]]s of the 1930s and 1940s [[Swing music|Swing]] era and the small combos of the 1950s [[Bebop]] and [[Hard Bop]] movements all used the [[double bass]]. The electric bass was introduced during the late 1960s and early 1970s, when rock influences were blended with jazz to create [[jazz-rock fusion]].
The introduction of the electric bass in jazz fusion, as in the rock world, enabled the bass to be used in high-volume stadium concerts with powerful amplifiers, because it is much easier to amplify the electric bass than the double bass (the latter is prone to feedback in high-volume settings). The electric bass has both an accompaniment and a soloing role in [[jazz]]. In accompaniment, the bassist may perform [[walking bass]]lines for traditional tunes and &quot;[[jazz standards]]&quot;, playing smooth quarter note lines that imitate the double bass. For [[latin]] or [[salsa music|salsa]] tunes and rock-infused jazz fusion tunes, the electric bass may play rapid, syncopated rhythmic figures in coordination with the drummer, or lay down a low, heavy groove.

In a jazz setting, the electric bass tends to have a much more expansive solo role than in most popular styles. In most rock settings, the bass guitarist may only have a few short bass breaks or brief solos during a concert. During a jazz concert, a jazz bassist may have a number of lengthy improvised solos, which are called &quot;blowing&quot; in jazz parlance. Whether a jazz bassist is comping (accompanying) or soloing, they usually aim to create a rhythmic drive and &quot;timefeel&quot; that creates a sense of &quot;[[swing (jazz performance style)|swing]]&quot; and &quot;[[groove (music)|groove]]&quot;. For information on notable jazz bassists, see the [[List of jazz bassists]] article.

===Contemporary classical music===
[[Contemporary classical music]] uses both the standard instruments of Western Art music (piano, violin, double bass, etc.) and newer instruments or sound producing devices, ranging from electrically amplified instruments to tape players and radios. The electric bass guitar has occasionally been used in contemporary classical music (art music) since the late 1960s.
Contemporary composers often obtained unusual sounds or instrumental timbres through the use of non-traditional (or unconventional) instruments or playing techniques. As such, bass guitarists playing contemporary classical music may be instructed to pluck or strum the instrument in unusual ways.
[[File:Alfred Schnittke April 6 1989 Moscow.jpg|thumb|150px|right| Russian and Soviet composer [[Alfred Schnittke]], pictured here in 1989, used electric bass for his Symphony no. 1 (1972).]]
American composers using electric bass in the 1960s included experimental classical music composer [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]] (born 1934) (''Electric Spring 1'', 1966; ''Electric Spring 2'', 1966/70; ''Electric Spring 3'', 1967; and ''Untitled'', 1996); [[Francis Thorne]], a student of Paul Hindemith at Yale University (born 1922), who wrote (''Liebesrock'' 1968–69); and [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] (Cello Concerto no. 1, 1966/67, rev. 1971/72), ''[[The Devils of Loudun (opera)|The Devils of Loudun]]'', 1969; ''Kosmogonia'', 1970; and ''Partita'', 1971), [[Louis Andriessen]] (''Spektakel'', 1970; ''De Staat'', 1972–76; ''Hoketus'', 1976; ''De Tijd'', 1980–81 and ''[[De Materie]]'', 1984–1988). European composers who began scoring for the bass guitar in the 1960s included Danish composer [[Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen]] (born 1932) (''Symfoni på Rygmarven'', 1966; ''Rerepriser'', 1967; and ''Piece by Piece'', 1968); [[Irwin Bazelon]] (''Churchill Downs'', 1970).

In the 1970s, electric bass was used by the American conductor-composer [[Leonard Bernstein]] (1918–1990) for his ''[[Mass (Bernstein)|MASS]]'', 1971). American jazz pianist [[Dave Brubeck]] used bass guitar for his 1971 piece ''Truth Has Fallen''. [[Russia]]n and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] composer [[Alfred Schnittke]] used the instrument for his Symphony no. 1, 1972. In 1977, [[David Amram]] (born 1930) scored for electric bass in ''En memoria de Chano Pozo''. Amram is an American composer known for his eclectic use of jazz, ethnic and folk music.

In the 1980s and 1990s, electric bass was used in works by [[Hans Werner Henze]] (''El Rey de Harlem'', 1980; and ''Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria'', 1981), [[Harold Shapero]], ''On Green Mountain (Chaconne after Monteverdi)'', 1957, orchestrated 1981; [[Steve Reich]]'s ''[[Electric Counterpoint]]'' (1987), [[Wolfgang Rihm]] (''Die Eroberung von Mexico'', 1987–91), [[Arvo Pärt]] (''Miserere'', 1989/92), [[Steve Martland]] (''Danceworks'', 1993; and ''Horses of Instruction'', 1994), [[Sofia Gubaidulina]] (''Aus dem Stundenbuch'', 1991), [[Giya Kancheli]] (''Wingless'', 1993), [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] (''[[I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky]]'', 1995; and ''Scratchband'', 1996/97), and [[Michael Nyman]] (various works for the [[Michael Nyman Band]]).

==Pedagogy and training==
The pedagogy and training for the electric bass varies widely by genre and country. Rock and pop bass has a history of pedagogy dating back to the 1950s and 1960s, when method books were developed to help students learn the instrument. One notable method book was [[Carol Kaye]]'s ''How to Play the Electric Bass''.

In the jazz scene, since the bass guitar takes on much of the same role as the double bass&amp;mdash;laying down the rhythm, and outlining the harmonic foundation&amp;mdash;electric bass players have long used both bass guitar methods and jazz double bass method books. The use of jazz double bass method books by electric bass players in jazz is facilitated in that jazz methods tend to emphasize improvisation techniques (e.g., how to improvise [[walking bass]]lines) and rhythmic exercises rather than specific ways of holding or plucking the instrument.

===Formal training===

Of all of the genres, jazz and the mainstream commercial genres (rock, R&amp;B, etc.) have the most established and comprehensive systems of instruction and training for electric bass. In the jazz scene, teens can begin taking private lessons on the instrument and performing in amateur big bands at high schools or run by the community. Young adults who aspire to becoming professional jazz bassists or studio rock bassists can continue their studies in a variety of formal training settings, including colleges and some universities.

Several colleges offer electric bass training in the US. The Bass Institute of Technology (BIT) in Los Angeles was founded in 1978, as part of the Musician's Institute. [[Chuck Rainey]] (electric bassist for [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Marvin Gaye]]) was BIT's first director. BIT was one of the earliest professional training program for electric bassists. The program teaches a range of modern styles, including funk, rock, jazz, Latin, and R&amp;B.
[[Image:MichaelManring-iMusicast.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bassist [[Michael Manring]] is a well-known alumnus of the bass department of the Berklee College of Music.]]
The [[Berklee College of Music]] in Boston offers training for electric bass players. Electric bass students get private lessons and there is a choice of over 270 ensembles to play in. Specific electric bass courses include funk/fusion styles for bass; slap techniques for electric bass; fingerstyle R&amp;B; five- and six-string electric bass playing (including performing chords); and how to read bass sheet music.&lt;ref name=&quot;berklee.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berklee.edu/departments/bass.html |title=BERKLEE &amp;#124; Bass Department |publisher=Berklee.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berklee College alumni include [[Jeff Andrews]], [[Victor Bailey (musician)|Victor Bailey]], [[Jeff Berlin]], [[Michael Manring]], and [[Neil Stubenhaus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;berklee.edu&quot;/&gt; The Bass Department has two rooms with bass amps for classes and ten private lesson studios equipped with audio recording gear. Berklee offers instruction for the four-, five-, and six-string electric bass, the fretless bass, and double bass. &quot;Students learn concepts in Latin, funk, Motown, and hip-hop,...jazz, rock, and fusion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;berklee.edu&quot;/&gt;

In Canada, the [[Humber College]] Institute of Technology &amp; Advanced Learning offers an Advanced Diploma (a three-year program) in jazz and commercial music. The program accepts performers who play bass, guitar, keyboard, drums, melody instruments (e.g., sax, flute, violin) and who sing. Students get private lessons and perform in 40 student ensembles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postsecondary.humber.ca/music.htm |title=Humber College &amp;#124; Music |publisher=Postsecondary.humber.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are far fewer university programs that offer electric bass instruction in jazz and popular music, some universities offer Bachelor's degrees ([[B.Mus.]]) and Master of Music ([[M.Mus.]]) degrees in jazz performance or &quot;commercial music&quot;, where electric bass can be the main instrument. In the US, the [[Manhattan School of Music]] has a jazz program leading to B.Mus. and M.Mus degrees that accepts students who play bass (double bass and electric bass), guitar, piano, drums, and melody instruments (e.g., sax, trumpet, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msmnyc.edu/undergrad/ |title=Manhattan School of Music: Undergraduate Studies |publisher=Msmnyc.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Australian state of Victoria, the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority has set out minimum standards for its electric bass students doing their end-of-year Solo performance recital. To graduate, students must perform pieces and songs from a set list that includes Baroque suite movements that were originally written for cello, 1960s Motown tunes, 1970s fusion jazz solos, and 1980s slap bass tunes. A typical program may include a Prelude by [[J.S. Bach]]; &quot;Portrait of Tracy&quot; by [[Jaco Pastorius]]; &quot;Twisted&quot; by [[Wardell Gray]] and Annie Ross; &quot;What’s Going On&quot; by [[James Jamerson]]; and the funky Disco hit &quot;[[Le Freak]]&quot; by Chic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/vce/studies/musicsolo/units34soloworks/sololist/electricbass.pdf |title=Contemporary Double Bass |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to college and university diplomas and degrees, there are a variety of other training programs such as jazz or funk summer camps and festivals, which give students the opportunity to play a wide range of contemporary music, from 1970s-style jazz-rock fusion to first decade of the 21st century-style R&amp;B.

===Informal training===
In other less mainstream genres, such as hardcore punk or metal, the pedagogical systems and training sequences are typically not formalized and institutionalized. As such, many players learn &quot;by ear&quot;, by copying the basslines from records and CDs, and by playing in a number of bands. Even in non-mainstream styles, though, students may be able to take lessons from experts in these or other styles, adapting learned techniques to their own style. As well, there are a range of books, playing methods, and, since the 1990s, instructional DVDs (e.g., on how to play metal bass).

'''Basketball''' is a [[team sport]] in which two teams of five players try to score points by throwing or &quot;[[#Shooting|shooting]]&quot; a [[basketball (ball)|ball]] through the top of a basketball hoop while following a set of [[Rules of basketball|rules]]. Basketball is one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/dec/06/football-brand-globalisation-china-basketball
|title=They think it's all over|accessdate=2008-12-24|date=2008-12-06|work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Julian | last=Borger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A regulation basketball hoop consists of a rim {{convert|18|in|cm|1}} in diameter and {{convert|10|ft|m|2}} high mounted to a [[Backboard (basketball)|backboard]]. A team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the hoop during regular play. A [[Field goal (basketball)|field goal]] scores two points for the shooting team if a player is touching or closer to the hoop than the [[3 point line|three-point line]], and three points (a &quot;3 pointer&quot;) if the player is &quot;outside&quot; the three-point line. The team with more points at the end of the game wins, but additional time (overtime) may be issued when the game ends with a tie. The ball can be advanced on the court by bouncing it while walking or running ([[dribbling]]) or passing it to a teammate. It is a violation ([[Traveling (basketball)|traveling]]) to walk with the ball, [[Carrying (basketball)|carry]] it, or to [[double dribble]] (to hold the ball and then resume dribbling).

Various [[Basketball#Violations|violations]] are generally called &quot;fouls&quot;. Disruptive physical contact (a [[Personal foul (basketball)|personal foul]]) is penalized, and a [[free throw]] is usually awarded to an offensive player if he is fouled while shooting the ball. A [[technical foul]] may also be issued when certain infractions occur, most commonly for [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] on the part of a player or [[Coach (basketball)|coach]]. A technical foul gives the opposing team a free throw.

Basketball has evolved many commonly used techniques of shooting, passing, and dribbling, as well as specialized [[Basketball position|player positions]] and offensive and defensive structures (player positioning) and techniques. Typically, the tallest members of a team will play [[Center (basketball)|&quot;center&quot;]], &quot;[[small forward]]&quot;, or &quot;[[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]]&quot; positions, while shorter players or those who possess the best ball handling skills and speed play &quot;[[point guard]]&quot; or &quot;[[shooting guard]]&quot;.

While competitive basketball is carefully regulated, numerous [[variations of basketball]] have developed for casual play. Competitive basketball is primarily an indoor sport played on carefully marked and maintained [[basketball court]]s, but less regulated variations are often played outdoors in both inner city and rural areas.

==History==
{{Main|History of basketball}}
[[File:Firstbasketball.jpg|thumb|The first basketball court: [[Springfield College]]]]

===The first rules, court, and game===
In early December 1891, Dr. [[James Naismith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/inventions/inventions.html|title=The Greatest Canadian Invention | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Canadian-born physical education [[professor]] and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010419124201/www.hoophall.com/history/naismith_resume.htm|title=Hoop Hall History Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; (YMCA) (today, [[Springfield College]]) in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], USA, was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day. He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long [[New England]] winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in [[gymnasiums]], he wrote the basic [[rules of basketball|rules]] and nailed a [[peach]] basket onto a 10-foot (3.05&amp;nbsp;m) elevated track. In contrast with modern basketball nets, this peach basket retained its bottom, and balls had to be retrieved manually after each &quot;basket&quot; or point scored; this proved inefficient, however, so the bottom of the basket was removed,&lt;ref&gt;FAQs.org, [http://www.faqs.org/sports-science/Mo-Pl/Naismith-James-A.html James A. Naismith]. Retrieved 2010.02.24.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the balls to be poked out with a long [[dowel]] each time. The peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards. A further change was soon made, so the ball merely passed through. An [[association football ball|association football]] was used to shoot baskets. Whenever a person got the ball in the basket, his team would gain a point. Whichever team got the most points won the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naismithmuseum.com/naismith_drjamesnaismith/main_drjamesnaismith.htm|accessdate=2007-02-14|date=2007-02-14|title=James Naismith Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; The baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court, but this proved impractical when spectators on the balcony began to interfere with shots. The backboard was introduced to prevent this interference; it had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots.&lt;ref&gt;Thinkquest, [http://library.thinkquest.org/10480/b-ball.html Basketball]. Retrieved 2009.01.20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naismith's handwritten diaries, discovered by his granddaughter in early 2006, indicate that he was nervous about the new game he had invented, which incorporated rules from a children's game called &quot;[[Duck on a Rock]]&quot;, as many had failed before it. Naismith called the new game &quot;Basket Ball&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2660882|title=Newly found documents shed light on basketball's birth|accessdate=2007-01-11|date=2006-11-13|agency=Associated Press|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first official game was played in a YMCA gymnasium on January 20, 1892 with nine players. The game ended at 1–0; the shot was made from {{convert|25|ft|m}}, on a court just half the size of a present-day [[Streetball]] or [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) court. By 1897–1898 teams of five became standard.

===Women's basketball===
Women's basketball began in 1892 at [[Smith College]] when [[Senda Berenson]], a physical education teacher, modified Naismith's rules for women. Shortly after she was hired at Smith, she went to Naismith to learn more about the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clio.fivecolleges.edu/smith/berenson/1biog/19411000/index.shtml?page=4|title=Pioneers in Physical Education|pages=661–662|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fascinated by the new sport and the values it could teach, she organized the first women’s collegiate basketball game on March 21, 1893, when her Smith freshmen and sophomores played against one another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Senda Berenson Papers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clio.fivecolleges.edu/smith/berenson/|title=Senda Berenson Papers|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her rules were first published in 1899 and two years later Berenson became the editor of [[Spalding (sports equipment)|A.G. Spalding]]’s first Women's Basketball Guide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Senda Berenson Papers&quot; /&gt;

===Surge in popularity===
Basketball's early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the [[United States]], and it quickly spread through the USA and [[Canada]]. By 1895, it was well established at several women's high schools. While the YMCA was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game, within a decade it discouraged the new sport, as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from the YMCA's primary mission. However, other amateur sports clubs, colleges, and professional clubs quickly filled the void. In the years before [[World War I]], the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] and the [[Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States]] (forerunner of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]) vied for control over the rules for the game. The first pro league, the National Basketball League, was formed in 1898 to protect players from exploitation and to promote a less rough game. This league only lasted five years.

===Basketball Hall of Fame founded===
By the 1950s, basketball had become a major college sport, thus paving the way for a growth of interest in professional basketball. In 1959, a [[Basketball Hall of Fame|basketball hall of fame]] was founded in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], site of the first game. Its rosters include the names of great players, coaches, referees and people who have contributed significantly to the development of the game. The hall of fame has people who have accomplished many goals in their career in basketball.

===Development of equipment and technique===
Basketball was originally played with an [[association football ball|association football]]. The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in the late 1950s that [[Paul D. &quot;Tony&quot; Hinkle|Tony Hinkle]], searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in common use. Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the &quot;bounce pass&quot; to teammates. Passing the ball was the primary means of ball movement. Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls. Dribbling only became a major part of the game around the 1950s, as manufacturing improved the ball shape.

===Historical antecedents===
Basketball, [[netball]], [[dodgeball]], [[volleyball]], and [[lacrosse]] are the only ball games which have been identified as being invented by North Americans{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Other ball games, such as [[baseball]] and [[Canadian football]], have [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Europe]]an, [[Asia]]n or [[African]] connections. Although there is no direct evidence as yet that the idea of basketball came from the ancient [[Mesoamerican ballgame]], knowledge of that game had been available for at least 50 years prior to Naismith's creation, in the writings of [[John Lloyd Stephens]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. Stephens' works especially, which included drawings by [[Frederick Catherwood]], were available at most educational institutions in the 19th century and also had wide popular circulations.

===Early college basketball development===
Dr. James Naismith was instrumental in establishing [[college basketball]]. His colleague C.O. Beamis fielded the first college basketball team just a year after the Springfield YMCA game at the suburban [[Pittsburgh]] [[Geneva College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postgazette.com/pg/10105/1050305-57.stm |title=Grandson of basketball's inventor brings game's exhibit to Geneva College |publisher=Postgazette.com |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naismith himself later coached at the [[University of Kansas]] for six years, before handing the reins to renowned coach [[Forrest &quot;Phog&quot; Allen]]. Naismith's disciple [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]] brought basketball to the [[University of Chicago]], while [[Adolph Rupp]], a student of Naismith's at Kansas, enjoyed great success as coach at the [[University of Kentucky]].

On February 9, 1895, the first intercollegiate 5-on-5 game was played at [[Hamline University]] between Hamline and the School of Agriculture, which was affiliated with [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamline.edu/hamline_info/athletics/facilities/hutton_arena.html |title=Hamline University Athletics: Hutton Arena |publisher=Hamline.edu |date=1937-01-04 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=dcollier |url=http://www.hamline.edu/cla/admission/campuslife/athletics/athletics.html |title=Hamline University Athletics: Admission Athletics Intro Page |publisher=Hamline.edu |date=2004-09-11 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The School of Agriculture won in a 9–3 game.

In 1901, colleges, including the [[University of Chicago]], [[Columbia University]], [[Dartmouth College]], the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[U.S. Naval Academy]], the [[University of Utah]] and [[Yale University]] began sponsoring men's games. In 1905, frequent injuries on the [[College football|football]] field prompted [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to suggest that colleges form a governing body, resulting in the creation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). In 1910, that body would change its name to the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] ([[NCAA]]).

===Early women's basketball development===
In 1891, the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] and Miss Head's School played the first women's interinstitutional game. Berenson's freshmen played the sophomore class in the first women's intercollegiate basketball game at [[Smith College]], March 21, 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smith.edu/newssmith/fall2003/100.php|title=You Come in as a Squirrel and Leave as an Owl|accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, [[Mount Holyoke]] and [[Sophie Newcomb College]] (coached by [[Clara Gregory Baer]]) women began playing basketball. By 1895, the game had spread to colleges across the country, including [[Wellesley College|Wellesley]], [[Vassar College|Vassar]], and [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]]. The first intercollegiate women's game was on April 4, 1896. [[Stanford Cardinal|Stanford]] women played [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], 9-on-9, ending in a 2–1 Stanford victory.

Women's basketball development was more structured than that for men in the early years. In 1905, the Executive Committee on Basket Ball Rules (National Women's Basketball Committee) was created by the [[American Physical Education Association]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Historical Timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbhof.com/timeline.html|title=Historical Timeline|accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rules called for six to nine players per team and 11 officials. The [[International Women's Sports Federation]] (1924) included a women's basketball competition. 37 women's high school varsity basketball or state tournaments were held by 1925. And in 1926, the Amateur Athletic Union backed the first [[NAIA national women's basketball championship|national women's basketball championship]], complete with men's rules.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historical Timeline&quot; /&gt;

The [[Edmonton Grads]], a touring [[Canadian]] women's team based in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], operated between 1915 and 1940. The Grads toured all over [[North America]], and were exceptionally successful. They posted a record of 522 wins and only 20 losses over that span, as they met any team which wanted to challenge them, funding their tours from gate receipts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histori.ca/minutes/lp.do?id=13113|title=The Great Teams|accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grads also shone on several exhibition trips to [[Europe]], and won four consecutive exhibition [[Olympics]] tournaments, in 1924, 1928, 1932, and 1936; however, women's basketball was not an official Olympic sport until 1976. The Grads' players were unpaid, and had to remain single. The Grads' style focused on team play, without overly emphasizing skills of individual players.

The first women's [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] All-America team was chosen in 1929.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historical Timeline&quot; /&gt; Women's industrial leagues sprang up throughout the United States, producing famous athletes, including [[Babe Zaharias|Babe Didrikson]] of the [[Golden Cyclones]], and the [[All American Red Heads Team]], which competed against men's teams, using men's rules. By 1938, the women's national championship changed from a three-court game to [[6 on 6 Basketball|two-court game with six players per team]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Historical Timeline&quot; /&gt;

===First Canadian interuniversity game===
The first Canadian interuniversity basketball game was played at the [[YMCA]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]] on February 6, 1904, when [[McGill University]] visited [[Queen's University]]. McGill won 9–7 in overtime; the score was 7–7 at the end of regulation play, and a ten-minute overtime period settled the outcome. A good turnout of spectators watched the game.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Queen's Journal]]'', vol. 31, no. 7, February 16, 1904; ''105 years of Canadian university basketball'', by Earl Zukerman, http://www.cisport.ca/e/m_basketball/story_detail.cfm?id=13618&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early American professional and barnstorming teams===
Teams abounded throughout the 1920s. There were hundreds of men's [[professional basketball]] teams in towns and cities all over the United States, and little organization of the professional game. Players jumped from team to team and teams played in armories and smoky dance halls. Leagues came and went. [[Barnstorm (sports)|Barnstorming]] squads such as the [[Original Celtics]] and two all-[[African American]] teams, the [[New York Renaissance|New York Renaissance Five]] (&quot;Rens&quot;) and (still in existence as of 2010) the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] played up to two hundred games a year on their national tours.

===American national college championships===
The first men's national championship tournament, the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball tournament, which still exists as the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA) [[NAIA national men's basketball championship|tournament]], was organized in 1937. The first national championship for NCAA teams, the [[National Invitation Tournament]] (NIT) in New York, was organized in 1938; the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA national tournament]] would begin one year later.

College basketball was rocked by gambling scandals from 1948 to 1951, when dozens of players from top teams were implicated in [[match fixing]] and [[point shaving]]. Partially spurred by an association with cheating, the NIT lost support to the NCAA tournament.

===U.S. high school basketball===
Before widespread school district consolidation, most United States [[high school]]s were far smaller than their present day counterparts. During the first decades of the 20th century, basketball quickly became the ideal interscholastic sport due to its modest equipment and personnel requirements. In the days before widespread [[television]] coverage of professional and college sports, the popularity of high school basketball was unrivaled in many parts of America. Perhaps the most legendary of high school teams was Indiana's [[Franklin Wonder Five]], which took the nation by storm during the 1920s, dominating Indiana basketball and earning national recognition.

Today virtually every high school in the United States fields a basketball team in [[Varsity team|varsity]] competition&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfhs.org/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&amp;ItemID=3506&lt;/ref&gt; Basketball's popularity remains high, both in rural areas where they carry the identification of the entire community, as well as at some larger schools known for their basketball teams where many players go on to participate at higher levels of competition after graduation. In the 2003–04 season, 1,002,797 boys and girls represented their schools in interscholastic basketball competition, according to the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]]. The states of [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]] and [[Kentucky]] are particularly well known for their residents' devotion to high school basketball, commonly called [[Hoosier Hysteria]] in Indiana; the critically acclaimed film ''[[Hoosiers]]'' shows high school basketball's depth of meaning to these communities.

====National championships====
There is currently no national tournament to determine a national high school champion.

The most serious effort was the [[National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament]] at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1917 to 1930. The event organized by [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]] and sent invitations to state champion teams. The tournament started out as a mostly Midwest affair but grew. In 1929 it had 29 state champions. Faced with opposition from the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] and [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] that bore a threat of the schools losing their accreditation the last tournament was in 1930. The organizations said they were concerned that the tournament was being used to recruit professional players from the prep ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoopedia.nba.com/index.php?title=National_Interscholastic_Basketball_Tournament |title=National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament – hoopedeia.nba.com – Retrieved September 13, 2009 |publisher=Hoopedia.nba.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tournament did not invite minority schools or private/parochial schools.

The National Catholic Interscholastic Basketball Tournament ran from 1924 to 1941 at [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoopedia.nba.com/index.php?title=National_Catholic_Interscholastic_Basketball_Tournament |title=National Catholic Interscholastic Basketball Tournament, 1924–1941 – hoopedia.nba.com – Retrieved September 13, 2009 |publisher=Hoopedia.nba.com |date=1941-12-07 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Catholic Invitational Basketball Tournament from 1954 to 1978 playing at a series of venues at [[The Catholic University of America|Catholic University]], [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]] and [[George Mason University|George Mason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoopedia.nba.com/index.php?title=National_Catholic_Invitational_Basketball_Tournament |title=National Catholic Invitations Basketball Tournament – hoopedia.nba.com – Retrieved September 13, 2009 |publisher=Hoopedia.nba.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament for Black High Schools was held from 1929 to 1942 at [[Hampton University|Hampton Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoopedia.nba.com/index.php?title=National_Interscholastic_Basketball_Tournament_for_Black_Schools |title=– National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament for Black High Schools, 1929–1942 – Retrieved September 13, 2009 |publisher=Hoopedia.nba.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Invitational Interscholastic Basketball Tournament was held from 1941 to 1967 starting out at [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]]. Following a pause during [[World War II]] it resumed at [[Tennessee State University|Tennessee State College]] in Nashville. The basis for the champion dwindled after 1954 when ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' began an integration of schools. The last tournaments were held at [[Alabama State University|Alabama State College]] from 1964 to 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoopedia.nba.com/index.php?title=National_Invitational_Interscholastic_Basketball_Tournament |title=National Invitational Interscholastic Basketball Tournament – hoopedia.nba.com – Retrieved September 13, 2009 |publisher=Hoopedia.nba.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Basketball Association===
{{Main|National Basketball Association}}

In 1946, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) was formed. The first game was played in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada between the [[Toronto Huskies]] and [[New York Knicks|New York Knickerbockers]] on November 1, 1946. Three seasons later, in 1949, the BAA merged with the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] to form the National Basketball Association (NBA). An upstart organization, the [[American Basketball Association]], emerged in 1967 and briefly threatened the NBA's dominance until the [[ABA-NBA merger]] in 1976. Today the NBA is the top professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.

The NBA has featured many famous players, including [[George Mikan]], the first dominating &quot;big man&quot;; ball-handling wizard [[Bob Cousy]] and defensive genius [[Bill Russell]] of the [[Boston Celtics]]; [[Wilt Chamberlain]], who originally played for the barnstorming [[Harlem Globetrotters]]; all-around stars [[Oscar Robertson]] and [[Jerry West]]; more recent big men [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Karl Malone]]; playmaker [[John Stockton]]; crowd-pleasing forward [[Julius Erving]]; European stars [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and [[Dražen Petrović]] and the three players who many credit with ushering the professional game to its highest level of popularity: [[Larry Bird]], [[Magic Johnson|Earvin &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson]], and [[Michael Jordan]].

In 2001, the NBA formed a developmental league, the [[NBA Development League|NBDL]]. As of 2008, the league has 16 teams.

===Women's National Basketball Association===
{{Main|Women's National Basketball Association}}

The NBA-backed Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) began in 1997. Though it had shaky attendance figures, several marquee players ([[Lisa Leslie]], [[Diana Taurasi]], and [[Candace Parker]] among others) have helped the league's popularity and level of competition. Other [[women's professional sports|professional women's basketball]] leagues in the United States, such as the [[American Basketball League (1996-1998)]], have folded in part because of the popularity of the [[WNBA]].

The WNBA has been looked at by many as a niche league. However, the league has recently taken steps forward.

In June 2007, the WNBA signed a contract extension with [[ESPN]]. The new television deal runs from 2009 to 2016. Along with this deal, came the first ever rights fees to be paid to a women's professional sports league. Over the eight years of the contract, &quot;millions and millions of dollars&quot; will be &quot;dispersed to the league's teams.&quot;

The WNBA gets more viewers on national television broadcasts (413,000) than both [[Major League Soccer]] (253,000)&lt;ref&gt;''Street &amp; Smith's SportsBusiness Journal'', [http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/60481 MLS attendance, TV viewership numbers slip]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[NHL]] (310,732).&lt;ref&gt;''Street &amp; Smith's SportsBusiness Journal'', [http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/61172 NHL’s attendance, TV ratings both showing increases]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 12, 2009 article, [[NBA]] commissioner [[David Stern]] said that in the bad economy, &quot;the NBA is far less profitable than the WNBA. We're losing a lot of money amongst a large number of teams. We're budgeting the WNBA to break even this year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Television New Zealand]]'', [http://tvnz.co.nz/basketball-news/nba-getting-through-tough-times-2539976 BASKETBALL | NBA getting through tough times]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippine Basketball Association===
{{Main|Philippine Basketball Association}}

The Philippine Basketball Association's first game was played on April 9, 1975 at the [[Araneta Coliseum]] in [[Cubao]], [[Quezon City]]. [[Philippines]]. It was founded as a &quot;rebellion&quot; of several teams from the now-defunct Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association which was tightly controlled by the Basketball Association of the Philippines (now defunct), the then-FIBA recognized national association. Nine teams from the MICAA participated in the league's first season that opened on April 9, 1975.

===Basketball in Australia===
{{Main|National Basketball League Australia|Women's National Basketball League}}
The [[National Basketball League Australia|NBL]] is [[Australia]]'s pre-eminent men's professional basketball league. The league commenced in [[1979 NBL Season|1979]], playing a winter season (April–September) and did so until the completion of the 20th season in [[1998 NBL Season|1998]]. The [[1998-99 NBL Season|1998/99]] season, which commenced only months later, was the first season after the shift to the current summer season format (October–April). This shift was an attempt to avoid competing directly against [[Football in Australia|Australia's various football codes]]. It features 8 teams from around Australia and one in New Zealand. A few players including [[Luc Longley]], [[Andrew Gaze]], [[Shane Heal]], [[Chris Anstey]] and [[Andrew Bogut]] made it big internationally, becoming poster figures for the sport in Australia. The [[Women's National Basketball League]] began in 1981.

===International basketball===
[[File:Munich 1972.jpg|thumb|upright|XX. Olympic games Munich 1972 [[Krešimir Ćosić]] of Yugoslavia (blue shirt) vs. [[Petr Novicky]] of Czechoslovakia]]
The [[International Basketball Federation]] was formed in 1932 by eight founding nations: [[Argentina]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Latvia]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]] and [[Switzerland]]. At this time, the organization only oversaw amateur players. Its acronym, derived from the French ''Fédération Internationale de Basketball Amateur'', was thus &quot;[[International Basketball Federation|FIBA]]&quot;.

Men's Basketball was first [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|included]] at the [[Berlin]] [[1936 Summer Olympics]], although a demonstration tournament was held in 1904. The United States defeated Canada in the first final, played outdoors. This competition has usually been dominated by the United States, whose team has won all but three titles, the first loss in a controversial final game in [[Munich]] in [[Basketball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] against the Soviet Union. In 1950 the first [[FIBA World Championship]] for men was held in [[Argentina]]. Three years later, the first [[FIBA World Championship for Women]] was held in [[Chile]]. Women's basketball was added to the Olympics in 1976, which were held in [[Montreal]], Canada with teams such as the [[Soviet Union]], [[Brazil women's national basketball team|Brazil]] and [[Australia women's national basketball team|Australia]] rivaling the [[United States women's national basketball team|American]] squads.

===Pros in the Olympics===
FIBA dropped the distinction between amateur and professional players in 1989, and in 1992, professional players played for the first time in the Olympic Games. The United States' dominance continued with the introduction of their [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]]. However, with developing programs elsewhere, other national teams started to beat the United States. A team made entirely of NBA players finished sixth in the 2002 World Championships in [[Indianapolis]], behind [[Yugoslavia national basketball team|Yugoslavia]], [[Argentina national basketball team|Argentina]], [[Germany national basketball team|Germany]], [[New Zealand national basketball team|New Zealand]] and [[Spain national basketball team|Spain]]. In the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Olympics]], the United States suffered its first Olympic loss while using professional players, falling to [[Puerto Rico national basketball team|Puerto Rico]] (in a 19-point loss) and [[Lithuania national basketball team|Lithuania]] in group games, and being eliminated in the semifinals by [[Argentina national basketball team|Argentina]]. It eventually won the bronze medal defeating Lithuania, finishing behind Argentina and [[Italy national basketball team|Italy]]. In 2006, in the World Championship of Japan, the United States advanced to the semifinals but were defeated by [[Greece national basketball team|Greece]] by 101–95. In the bronze medal game it beat team [[Argentina national basketball team|Argentina]] and finished 3rd behind Greece and Spain.

After the disappointments of 2002 through 2006, the U.S. regrouped, reestablishing themselves as the dominant international team behind the [[2008 United States men's Olympic basketball team|&quot;Redeem Team&quot;]], which won gold at the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]], and the so-called &quot;B-Team&quot;, which won gold at the [[2010 FIBA World Championship]] in Turkey despite featuring no players from the 2008 squad.

===International stars in the NBA===
Worldwide, basketball tournaments are held for boys and girls of all age levels. The global popularity of the sport is reflected in the nationalities represented in the NBA. Players from all six inhabited continents currently play in the NBA. Top international players began coming into the NBA in the mid 1990's, including Croatians [[Dražen Petrović]] and [[Toni Kukoč]], Serbian [[Vlade Divac]], Lithuanians [[Arvydas Sabonis]] and [[Šarūnas Marčiulionis]] and German [[Detlef Schrempf]].

John Hollinger of [[ESPN]] has analyzed foreign players' performance in the NBA and his research suggests that players moving from the Euroleague to the NBA experience, on average, a 25 per cent drop in scoring rate, an increase of 18% in their rebound rate, a 31% increase in their assist rate, a drop of 12 per cent in shooting percentage and a 30 per cent drop in [[Player Efficiency Rating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hollinger|first=John|title=Forecasting the NBA careers of recently drafted international players|url=http://insider.espn.go.com/nba/draft2007/insider/columns/story?columnist=hollinger_john&amp;id=2920870&amp;action=login&amp;appRedirect=http%3a%2f%2finsider.espn.go.com%2fnba%2fdraft2007%2finsider%2fcolumns%2fstory%3fcolumnist%3dhollinger_john%26id%3d2920870|work=ESPN Insider|date=29 June 2007|accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization of basketball===
The all-tournament teams at the [[2002 FIBA World Championship|2002]] and [[2006 FIBA World Championship|2006]] [[FIBA World Championship]]s, respectively held in Indianapolis and Japan, demonstrate the globalization of the game equally dramatically. Only one member of either team was American, namely [[Carmelo Anthony]] in 2006. The 2002 team featured Nowitzki, Ginobili, Yao, [[Predrag Stojaković|Peja Stojakovic]] of Yugoslavia (now of [[Serbia national basketball team|Serbia]]), and [[Pero Cameron]] of New Zealand. Ginobili also made the 2006 team; the other members were Anthony, Gasol, his [[Spain national basketball team|Spanish]] teammate [[Jorge Garbajosa]] and [[Theodoros Papaloukas]] of [[Greece national basketball team|Greece]]. The only players on either team to never have joined the NBA are Cameron and Papaloukas.

The all-tournament team from the [[2010 FIBA World Championship|2010 edition]] in [[Turkey]] featured four NBA players—MVP [[Kevin Durant]] of Team USA and the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]], [[Linas Kleiza]] of [[Lithuania national basketball team|Lithuania]] and the [[Toronto Raptors]], [[Luis Scola]] of Argentina and the [[Houston Rockets]], and [[Hedo Türkoğlu]] of [[Turkey national basketball team|Turkey]] and the [[Phoenix Suns]]. The only non-NBA player was Serbia's [[Miloš Teodosić]].

The strength of international Basketball is evident in the fact that Team USA won none of the three world championships held between 1998 and 2006, with Serbia (then known as Yugoslavia) winning in 1998 and 2002 and Spain in 2006.

==Rules and regulations==
{{Main|Rules of basketball}}
&lt;!-- Please do be careful not to include too much detail when editing this section; see talk page for more info. --&gt;

Measurements and time limits discussed in this section often vary among tournaments and organizations; international and NBA rules are used in this section.

The object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing the ball through the opponents' basket from above while preventing the opponents from doing so on their own. An attempt to score in this way is called a shot. A successful shot is worth two points, or [[three-point field goal|three points]] if it is taken from beyond the three-point arc which is {{convert|6.25|m|ftin|abbr=off}} from the basket in international games and {{convert|23|ft|9|in|m}} in NBA games. A one-point shot can be earned when shooting from the foul line after a foul is made.

Teams also have a [[coach (sport)|coach]], who oversees the development and strategies of the team, and other team personnel such as assistant coaches, managers, statisticians, doctors and trainers.

For both men's and women's teams, a standard uniform consists of a pair of shorts and a [[jersey (clothing)|jersey]] with a clearly visible number, unique within the team, printed on both the front and back. Players wear [[high-top]] sneakers that provide extra ankle support. Typically, team names, players' names and, outside of North America, sponsors are printed on the uniforms.

A limited number of time-outs, clock stoppages requested by a coach (or sometimes mandated in the NBA) for a short meeting with the players, are allowed. They generally last no longer than one minute (100 seconds in the NBA) unless, for televised games, a commercial break is needed.

The game is controlled by the [[Official (basketball)|officials]] consisting of the referee (referred to as crew chief in the NBA), one or two umpires (referred to as referees in the NBA) and the table officials. For college, the NBA, and many high schools, there are a total of three referees on the court. The table officials are responsible for keeping track of each teams scoring, timekeeping, individual and team [[Personal foul (basketball)|fouls]], player substitutions, team [[possession arrow]], and the [[shot clock]].

===Equipment===
{{Main|Basketball (ball)|Basketball court|Backboard (basketball)}}
&lt;!-- Please be careful not to include too much detail when editing this section; see talk page for more info. --&gt;
[[File:Basketball.png|thumb|upright|Traditional eight-panel [[basketball (ball)|basketball]]]]

The only essential equipment in a basketball game is the basketball and the court: a flat, rectangular surface with baskets at opposite ends. Competitive levels require the use of more equipment such as clocks, score sheets, scoreboard(s), alternating possession arrows, and whistle-operated stop-clock systems.

[[File:Basketball Goal.jpg|thumb|An outdoor basketball net.]]
A regulation [[basketball court]] in international games is {{convert|28|m|ft|1}} long and {{convert|15|m|ft|1}} wide. In the [[NBA]] and [[NCAA]] the court is {{convert|94|ft|m|1}} by {{convert|50|ft|m|1}}. Most courts have [[wood flooring]], usually constructed from [[maple]] planks running in the same direction as the longer court dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connorfloor.com/green.php|title=Connor Sports Flooring|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name and [[logo]] of the home team is usually painted on or around the center circle.

The basket is a steel rim {{convert|18|in|cm|1}} in diameter with an attached net affixed to a backboard that measures {{convert|6|ft|cm|1}} by {{convert|3.5|ft|cm|1}}, and one basket is at each end of the court. The white outlined box on the backboard is {{convert|18|in|cm|1}} high and {{convert|2|ft|cm|1}} wide. At almost all levels of competition, the top of the rim is exactly {{convert|10|ft|cm|0}} above the court and {{convert|4|ft|cm|1}} inside the baseline. While variation is possible in the dimensions of the court and backboard, it is considered important for the basket to be of the correct height - a rim that is off by just a few inches can have an adverse effect on shooting.

The size of the basketball is also regulated. For men, the official ball is {{convert|29.5|in|cm|1}} in circumference (size 7, or a &quot;295 ball&quot;) and weighs {{convert|22|oz|g|0}}. If women are playing, the official basketball size is {{convert|28.5|in|cm|1}} in circumference (size 6, or a &quot;285 ball&quot;) with a weight of {{convert|20|oz|g|0}}.

===Violations===
&lt;!-- Please be careful not to include too much detail when editing this section; see talk page for more info. --&gt;
The ball may be advanced toward the basket by being shot, passed between players, thrown, tapped, rolled or dribbled (bouncing the ball while running).

The ball must stay within the court; the last team to touch the ball before it travels out of bounds forfeits possession. The ball is out of bounds if touches or crosses over a boundary line, or touches a player who is out of bounds. This is in contrast to other sports such as [[association football|football]], [[volleyball]], and [[tennis]] (but not [[Rugby football|rugby]] or [[American football]]) where the ball (or player) is still considered in if any part of it is touching a boundary line.

The ball-handler may not move both feet without dribbling, an infraction known as [[traveling (basketball)|traveling]], nor may he dribble with both hands or catch the ball in between dribbles, a violation called [[double dribble|double dribbling]]. A player's hand cannot be under the ball while dribbling; doing so is known as [[Carrying (basketball)|carrying the ball]]. A team, once having established ball control in the front half of the court, may not return the ball to the backcourt and be the first to touch it. The ball may not be kicked, nor be struck with the fist. A violation of these rules results in loss of possession, or, if committed by the defense, a reset of the [[shot clock]] (with some exceptions in the NBA).

There are limits imposed on the time taken before progressing the ball past halfway (8 seconds in international and NBA; 10 seconds in NCAA men's play and high school for both sexes, but no limit in NCAA women's play), before attempting a shot (24 seconds in the NBA, 30 seconds in NCAA women's and [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] play for both sexes, and 35 seconds in NCAA men's play), holding the ball while closely guarded (5 seconds), and remaining in the restricted area below the foul line (the lane, or &quot;[[key (basketball)|key]]&quot;) (3 seconds). These rules are designed to promote more offense.

No player may touch the ball on its downward flight to the basket, unless the ball has no chance of entering the basket (goaltending). In addition, no player may touch the ball while it is on or in the basket; when any part of the ball is in the cylinder above the basket (the area extended upwards from the basket); or when the ball is outside the cylinder, if the player reaches through the basket and touches it. This violation is known as &quot;basket interference&quot;. If a defensive player goaltends or commits basket interference, the basket is awarded and the offending team gets the ball. If a teammate of the shooter goaltends or commits interference, the basket is cancelled and play continues with the defensive team being given possession.

===Fouls===
&lt;!-- Please be careful not to include too much detail when editing this section; see talk page for more info. --&gt;
[[File:Basketball foul.jpg|thumb|upright|The referee signals that a foul has been committed.]]
{{Main|Personal foul (basketball)|Technical foul}}
An attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through physical contact is illegal and is called a foul. These are most commonly committed by defensive players; however, they can be committed by offensive players as well. Players who are fouled either receive the ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one or more [[free throw]]s if they are fouled in the act of shooting, depending on whether the shot was successful. One point is awarded for making a free throw, which is attempted from a line {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=off|lk=off}} from the basket.

The referee may use discretion in calling fouls (for example, by considering whether an unfair advantage was gained), sometimes making fouls controversial calls or no-calls. The calling of fouls can vary between games, leagues and even among referees.

A player or coach who shows poor sportsmanship, such as by arguing with a referee or by fighting with another player, can be charged with a more serious foul called a [[technical foul]]. The penalty involves free throws (where, unlike a personal foul, the other team can choose any player to shoot) and varies among leagues. Repeated incidents can result in [[ejection (sports)|disqualification]]. Blatant fouls with excessive contact or that are not an attempt to play the ball are called intentional fouls (or flagrant fouls in the NBA). In FIBA, a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul, while in leagues other than the NBA, such a foul is referred to as flagrant.

If a team exceeds a certain limit of team fouls in a given period (quarter or half) – four for NBA and international games – the opposing team is awarded one or two free throws on all subsequent non-shooting fouls for that period, the number depending on the league. In the US college and high school games, if a team reaches 7 fouls in a half, the opposing team is awarded one free throw, along with a second shot if the first is made. This is called shooting &quot;one-and-one&quot;. If a team exceeds 10 fouls in the half, the opposing team is awarded two free throws on all subsequent fouls for the half.

When a team shoots foul shots, the opponents may not interfere with the shooter, nor may they try to regain possession until the last or potentially last free throw is in the air.

After a team has committed a specified number of fouls, it is said to be &quot;in the penalty&quot;. On scoreboards, this is usually signified with an indicator light reading &quot;Bonus&quot; or &quot;Penalty&quot; with an illuminated directional arrow indicating that team is to receive free throws when fouled by the opposing team. (Some scoreboards also indicate the number of fouls committed.)

If a team misses the first shot of a two-shot situation, the opposing team must wait for the completion of the second shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the ball and continuing play.

If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is unsuccessful, the player is awarded a number of free throws equal to the value of the attempted shot. A player fouled while attempting a regular two-point shot, then, receives two shots. A player fouled while attempting a three-point shot, on the other hand, receives three shots.

If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is successful, typically the player
will be awarded one additional free throw for one point. In combination with a regular
shot, this is called a &quot;three-point play&quot; or &quot;four-point play&quot; (or more colloquially, an &quot;and one&quot;) because of the basket made at the time of the foul (2 or 3 points) and the additional free throw (1 point).

==Common techniques and practices==
===Positions===
{{main|Basketball position}}
[[File:Basketball positions.svg|thumb|250px|Basketball positions in the offensive zone]]
Although the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever, they have evolved as part of basketball. During the first five decades of basketball's evolution, one guard, two forwards, and two centers or two guards, two forwards, and one center were used. Since the 1980s, more specific positions have evolved, namely:

# [[point guard]]: usually the fastest player on the team, organizes the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time
# [[shooting guard]]: creates a high volume of shots on offense; guards the opponent's best perimeter player on defense
# [[small forward]]: often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration; on defense seeks rebounds and steals, but sometimes plays more actively
# [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]]: plays offensively often with their back to the basket; on defense, plays under the basket (in a zone defense) or against the opposing power forward (in man-to-man defense)
# [[Center (basketball)|center]]: uses height and size to score (on offense), to protect the basket closely (on defense), or to rebound.

The above descriptions are flexible. On some occasions, teams will choose to use a ''three guard offense'', replacing one of the forwards or the center with a third guard. The most commonly interchanged positions are point guard and shooting guard, especially if both players have good leadership and ball handling skills.

===Strategy===
{{main|Basketball playbook}}

The strategies also evolve with the game. In the 1990s and early 2000s, teams played with more &quot;isolation&quot;. Teams that had one superstar would let one player, usually the point guard or shooting guard, run most of the offense while the other four offensive players get out of his/her way. Nowadays, teams tend to play with more teamwork. The &quot;Center&quot; position has evolved to become more of a taller &quot;Small Forward&quot; position. Since teams play more teamwork, ball movement has evolved with the game, and more jump shots have been taken as a result.

There are two main defensive strategies: ''zone defense'' and ''man-to-man defense''. In a [[zone defense]], each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the court. In a [[man-to-man defense]], each defensive player guards a specific opponent. Man-to-man defense is generally preferred at higher levels of competition, as it is intuitively easier to understand and avoids mismatches between players who play different positions. However, zone defenses are sometimes used in particular situations or simply to confuse the offense with an unexpected look.

Offensive plays are more varied, normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball. A quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is a ''cut''. A legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent from guarding a teammate, by standing in the defender's way such that the teammate cuts next to him, is a ''screen'' or ''pick''. The two plays are combined in the ''[[pick and roll]]'', in which a player sets a pick and then &quot;rolls&quot; away from the pick towards the basket. Screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays; these allow the quick passes and teamwork which can lead to a successful basket. Teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable. On court, the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which play will occur.

Defensive and offensive structures, and positions, are more emphasized in higher levels in basketball; it is these that a coach normally requests a time-out to discuss.

===Shooting===
[[File:Basketball shot.jpg|thumb|upright|Player releases a short jump shot, while her defender is either knocked down, or trying to &quot;take a charge.&quot;]]

Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket. Methods can vary with players and situations.

Typically a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket. A player will then allow the ball to rest on the fingertips of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand supporting the side of the ball. The ball is typically shot by jumping (though not always) and straightening the shooting arm. The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist fully bent is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a follow-through. Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to deaden its impact with the rim. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat arguable, but generally coaches recommend a proper arch. Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.

The two most common shots that use the above described setup are the ''set shot'' and the ''[[Jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]]''. The set shot is taken from a standing position, with neither foot leaving the floor, typically used for free throws. The jump shot is taken while in mid-air, when the ball is released near the top of the jump. This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender. Failure to release the ball before the feet return to the ground is considered a traveling violation.

Another common shot is called the ''[[layup]]''. This shot requires the player to be in motion toward the basket, and to &quot;lay&quot; the ball &quot;up&quot; and into the basket, typically off the backboard (the backboard-free, underhand version is called a ''finger roll''). The most crowd-pleasing and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the ''[[slam dunk]]'', in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball downward, straight through the hoop.

Another shot that is becoming common is the &quot;circus shot.&quot; The circus shot is a low-percentage shot that is flipped, heaved, scooped, or flung toward the hoop while the shooter is off-balance, airborne, falling down, and/or facing away from the basket.

A shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as an [[air ball]]. A particularly bad shot, or one that only hits the backboard, is jocularly called a [[brick (basketball)|brick]].

===Rebounding===
{{Main|Rebound (basketball)}}
&lt;!-- There should be at least a paragraph or two here, in addition to the main article link. --&gt;
The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw, as it rebounds from the hoop or backboard. This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot. There are two categories of rebounds: offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball. The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots.

===Passing===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:172808 480 art R0.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carlos Arroyo]] shown here with the [[Utah Jazz]], left, passes to a teammate.{{speedy-image-c|2006-10-16}} ]] --&gt;
{{See also|Assist (basketball)}}
A pass is a method of moving the ball between players. Most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy.

A staple pass is the ''chest pass''. The ball is passed directly from the passer's chest to the receiver's chest. A proper chest pass involves an outward snap of the thumbs to add velocity and leaves the defence little time to react.

Another type of pass is the ''bounce pass''. Here, the passer bounces the ball crisply about two-thirds of the way from his own chest to the receiver. The ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver. The bounce pass takes longer to complete than the chest pass, but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation). Thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments, or to pass around a defender.

The ''overhead pass'' is used to pass the ball over a defender. The ball is released while over the passer's head.

The ''outlet pass'' occurs after a team gets a defensive rebound. The next pass after the rebound is the ''outlet pass''.

The crucial aspect of any good pass is it being difficult to intercept. Good passers can pass the ball with great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball. A special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate. This is called a ''no-look pass''.

Another advanced style of passing is the ''behind-the-back pass'' which, as the description implies, involves throwing the ball behind the passer's back to a teammate. Although some players can perform such a pass effectively, many coaches discourage no-look or behind-the-back passes, believing them to be difficult to control and more likely to result in turnovers or violations.

===Dribbling===
[[File:Basketball game.jpg|thumb|upright|A U.S. Naval Academy (&quot;Navy&quot;) player, left, posts up a U.S. Military Academy (&quot;Army&quot;) defender.]]
{{Main|Dribble}}
Dribbling is the act of bouncing the ball continuously with one hand, and is a requirement for a player to take steps with the ball. To dribble, a player pushes the ball down towards the ground with the fingertips rather than patting it; this ensures greater control.

When dribbling past an opponent, the dribbler should dribble with the hand farthest from the opponent, making it more difficult for the defensive player to get to the ball. It is therefore important for a player to be able to dribble competently with both hands.

Good dribblers (or &quot;ball handlers&quot;) tend to bounce the ball low to the ground, reducing the distance of travel of the ball from the floor to the hand, making it more difficult for the defender to &quot;steal&quot; the ball. Good ball handlers frequently dribble behind their backs, between their legs, and switch directions suddenly, making a less predictable dribbling pattern that is more difficult to defend against. This is called a crossover, which is the most effective way to move past defenders while dribbling.

A skilled player can dribble without watching the ball, using the dribbling motion or [[peripheral vision]] to keep track of the ball's location. By not having to focus on the ball, a player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities, as well as avoid the danger of having someone steal the ball away from him/her.

===Blocking===
{{Main|Block (basketball)}}
A block is performed when, after a shot is attempted, a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball. In almost all variants of play, it is illegal to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc; this is known as ''[[goaltending]]''. It is also illegal under NBA and Men's NCAA basketball to block a shot after it has touched the backboard, or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim.

To block a shot, a player has to be able to reach a point higher than where the shot is released. Thus, height can be an advantage in blocking. Players who are taller and playing the power forward or center positions generally record more blocks than players who are shorter and playing the guard positions. However, with good timing and a sufficiently high vertical leap, even shorter players can be effective shot blockers.

==Height==
At the professional level, most male players are above {{convert|6|ft|3|in|m|2}} and most women above {{convert|5|ft|7|in|m|2}}. Guards, for whom physical coordination and ball-handling skills are crucial, tend to be the smallest players. Almost all forwards in the men's pro leagues are {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m|2}} or taller. Most centers are over {{convert|6|ft|10|in|m|2}} tall. According to a survey given to all NBA teams, the average height of all NBA players is just under {{convert|6|ft|7|in|m|2}}, with the average weight being close to {{convert|222|lb|kg}}. The tallest players ever in the NBA were [[Manute Bol]] and [[Gheorghe Mureşan]], who were both {{convert|7|ft|7|in|m|2}} tall. The tallest current NBA player is [[Yao Ming]], who stands at {{convert|7|ft|6|in|m|2}}.

The shortest player ever to play in the NBA is [[Muggsy Bogues]] at {{convert|5|ft|3|in|m|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/muggsy_bogues/bio.html |title=Muggsy Bogues Bio |publisher=NBA.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other short players have thrived at the pro level. [[Spud Webb|Anthony &quot;Spud&quot; Webb]] was just {{convert|5|ft|7|in|m}} tall, but had a 42-inch (1.07 m) vertical leap, giving him significant height when jumping. The shortest player in the NBA (and second shortest ever in the NBA) as of the 2009–10 season is [[Earl Boykins]] at 5 feet 5&amp;nbsp;inches (1.65 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/earl_boykins/bio.html |title=Earl Boykins Bio Page |publisher=NBA.com |date=1976-06-02 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; While shorter players are often not very good at defending against shooting, their ability to navigate quickly through crowded areas of the court and steal the ball by reaching low are strengths.

==Variations and similar games==
{{Main|Variations of basketball}}

'''Variations of basketball''' are activities based on the game of basketball, using common basketball skills and equipment (primarily the ball and basket). Some variations are only superficial rules changes, while others are distinct games with varying degrees of basketball influences. Other variations include children's games, contests or activities meant to help players reinforce skills.

There are principal basketball sports with variations on basketball including '''[[Wheelchair basketball]]''', '''[[Water basketball]]''', '''[[Beach Basketball|Beach basketball]]''', '''[[Slamball]]''', '''[[Streetball]]''' and '''[[Unicycle basketball]]'''. An earlier version of basketball was '''[[Six-on-six basketball]]''' played until the end of the 1950s. '''[[Horseball]]''' is a game played on [[horse]]back where a ball is handled and points are scored by shooting it through a high net (approximately 1.5m×1.5m). The sport is like a combination of [[polo]], [[rugby football|rugby]], and basketball. There is even a form played on donkeys known as '''[[Donkey basketball]]''', but that version has come under attack from animal rights groups.

Games using basketball skills and equipment include popular versions of the half-court game played in informal settings without referees or strict rules. Perhaps the single most common variation is the ''half court'' game. Only one basket is used, and the ball must be &quot;cleared&quot; – passed or dribbled outside the half-court or three-point line -each time possession of the ball changes from one team to the other. Half-court games require less [[cardiovascular]] stamina, since players need not run back and forth a full court. Half-court games also raise the number of players that can use a court, an important benefit when many players want to play. Half court games are also played when there is an insufficient number of players to form full 5-on-5 teams.

There are also other basketball sports like
* '''[[Twenty-one (basketball)|21]]''' (also known as '''American''', '''cutthroat''' and '''roughhouse''')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Wheelchair Basketball===
{{Main|Wheelchair basketball}}
Wheelchair basketball, created by disabled [[World War II]] veterans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findsportsnow.com/learn/wheelchair-basketball |title=Learn Basketball on FindSportsNow |publisher=Findsportsnow.com |date=2007-11-05 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is played on specially designed wheelchairs for the physically impaired. The world governing body of wheelchair basketball is the [[International Wheelchair Basketball Federation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IWBF |url=http://www.iwbf.org/ |title=IWBF website |publisher=Iwbf.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; (IWBF).

===Water Basketball===
{{Main|Water basketball}}
Water basketball, played in a swimming pool, merges basketball and [[water polo]] rules.

===Beach Basketball===
{{Main|Beach basketball}}
A modified version of basketball, played on beaches, was invented by Philip Bryant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachbasketball.com/ |title=World Beach Basketball site |publisher=Beachbasketball.com |date=1995-05-05 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beach basketball is played in a circular court with no backboard on the goal, no out-of-bounds rule with the ball movement to be done via passes or 2½ steps, as dribbling is next to impossible on a soft surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beachbasketball.com] Beachbasketball.com web site&lt;/ref&gt;
Beach basketball has grown to a very popular, widespread competitive sport. 15 Annual World Championships have been organized.

===Dunk Hoops===
Dunk Hoops (aka Dunk Ball) is a variation of the game of basketball, played on basketball hoops with lowered (under basketball regulation 10 feet) rims. It originated when the popularity of the slam dunk grew and was developed to create better chances for dunks with lowered rims and using altered [[goaltending]] rules.

===Slamball===
{{Main|Slamball}}
Slamball is full-contact basketball, with [[trampolines]]. Points are scored by playing the ball through the net, as in basketball, though the point-scoring rules are modified. The main differences from the parent sport is the court; below the padded basketball rim and [[backboard (basketball)|backboard]] are four trampolines set into the floor which serve to propel players to great heights for [[slam dunk]]s. The rules also permit some physical contact between the members of the four-player teams.

===Streetball===
{{Main|Streetball}}
Streetball is a less formal variant of basketball, played on [[playground]]s and in [[gym]]nasiums across the world. Often only one half of the court is used, but otherwise the rules of the game are very similar to those of basketball. The number of participants in a game, or a ''run'', may range from one defender and one person on offense (known as ''one on one'') to two full teams of five each.

Streetball is a very popular game worldwide, and some cities in the United States have organized streetball programs, such as [[midnight basketball]]. Many cities also host their own weekend-long streetball tournaments.

===Unicycle Basketball===
Unicycle basketball is played using a regulation basketball on a regular basketball court with the same rules, for example,, one must dribble the ball whilst riding. There are a number of rules that are particular to unicycle basketball as well, for example,, a player must have at least one foot on a pedal when in-bounding the ball. Unicycle basketball is usually played using 24&quot; or smaller unicycles, and using plastic pedals, both to preserve the court and the players' shins. In North America, popular unicycle basketball games are organized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bayarea.comcastsportsnet.com/UncoveredVid.jsp?bcpid=1274025926&amp;bclid=1313706243&amp;bctid=1432781480 Comcast SportsNet Feature about Berkeley Unicycle Basketball]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===More distantly related basketball games===
{{Main|Variations of basketball#More distantly related games}}
Spin-offs from basketball that are now separate sports include:
* '''[[Korfball]]''' (Dutch: Korfbal, ''korf'' meaning 'basket') started in the Netherlands and is now played worldwide as a mixed gender team ball game, similar to mixed netball and basketball
* '''[[Netball]]''' (formerly known as Women basketball but now played by both males and females), a limited-contact team sport in which two teams of seven try to score points against one another by placing a ball through a high hoop.

==Social forms of basketball==
[[File:Monument to basketball.jpg|thumb|upright|A monument to basketball in [[Vilnius]]]]
Basketball has been adopted by various social groups, which have established their own environments and sometimes their own rules. Such socialized forms of basketball include the following.
* '''Recreational basketball,''' where fun, entertainment and camaraderie rule rather than winning a game;
* '''Basketball Schools and Academies,''' where students are trained in developing basketball fundamentals, undergo fitness and endurance exercises and learn various basketball skills. Basketball students learn proper ways of passing, ball handling, dribbling, shooting from various distances, rebounding, offensive moves, defense, layups, screens, basketball rules and basketball ethics. Also popular are the '''basketball camps''' organized for various occasions, often to get prepared for basketball events, and '''basketball clinics''' for improving skills.
* '''College and University basketball''' played in educational institutions of higher learning.
** This includes [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) intercollegiate basketball.
* '''Disabled basketball''' played by various disabled groups, such as
** '''Bankshot basketball''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankshot.com/ |title=Bankshot basketball website |publisher=Bankshot.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''[[Deaf basketball]]''',
** '''[[Wheelchair basketball]]''', a sport based on basketball but designed for [[disability|disabled]] people in [[wheelchair]]s and considered one of the major [[disabled sports]] practiced.
* '''Ethnic and Religion-based basketball''': Examples of ethnic basketball include Indo-Pak or Russian or Armenian leagues in the United States or Canada, for example, or Filipino expatriate basketball leagues in the Gulf or the United States. Religion-based basketball includes, most notably, church-related Christian basketball leagues, Jewish, Muslim and Hindu basketball leagues, and so on. or denominational leagues like Coptic, Syriac/Assyrian basketball leagues in the United States or Canada.
* '''Gay basketball''' played in [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[transgender]] communities in gay basketball leagues. The sport of basketball is a major part of events during the [[Gay Games]], [[World Outgames]] and [[EuroGames (LGBT sporting event)|EuroGames]].
* '''[[Midnight basketball]]''', a basketball initiative to curb inner-city crime in the United States and elsewhere by keeping urban youth off the streets and engaging them with sports alternatives to drugs and crime.
* '''Mini basketball''' played by underage children.
* '''Maxi Basketball''' played by more elderly individuals.
* '''Prison basketball''', practiced in [[prisons]] and penitentiary institutions. Active religious basketball missionary groups also play basketball with prisoners. Some prisons have developed their own prison basketball leagues. At times, non-prisoners may play in such leagues, provided all home and away games are played within prison courts. Film director [[Jason Moriarty]] has released a documentary relating to the sport, entitled [[Prison Ball]].
* '''[[Rezball]]''', short for reservation ball, is the term used to describe the avid [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] following of basketball and, in some areas, the style of play of Native American teams.
* '''School or High school basketball''', the sport of basketball being one of the most frequently exercised and popular sports in all school systems.
* '''Show basketball''' as performed by entertainment basketball show teams, the prime example being the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. There are even specialized entertainment teams, including
** '''Celebrity basketball''' teams made of celebrities (actors, singers, and so on.) playing in their own leagues or in public, often for entertainment and charity events;
** '''Midget basketball''' teams made up of athletes of [[short stature]] offering shows using basketball;
** '''[[Slamball]]''' offered as entertainment events.

==Fantasy basketball==
{{Main|Fantasy basketball}}
'''Fantasy basketball''' was inspired by [[fantasy baseball]]. Originally played by keeping track of stats by hand, it was popularized during the 1990s after the advent of the Internet. Those who play this game are sometimes referred to as General Managers, who draft actual [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] players and compute their [[basketball statistics]]. The game was popularized by [[ESPN]] Fantasy Sports, [[NBA.com]], and [[Yahoo!]] Fantasy Sports. Other sports websites provided the same format keeping the game interesting with participants actually owning specific players.

[[File:Generic football.png|thumb|[[Association football|Football (Soccer ball)]]]]
A '''ball''' is a round, usually [[sphere|spherical]] but sometimes [[ovoid]], object with various uses. It is used in [[ball game]]s, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch, [[marbles]] and [[juggling]]. Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in [[engineering]] applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as [[ball bearings]]. [[Black powder]] weapons use stone and metal balls as [[projectile]]s.

Although many types of balls are today made from [[rubber]], this form was unknown outside the Americas until after the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]. The Spanish were the first Europeans to see bouncing rubber balls (albeit solid and not inflated) which were employed most notably in the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]]. Balls used in various sports in other parts of the world prior to Columbus were made from other materials such as animal bladders or skins, stuffed with various materials.

== Etymology ==
The first known use of the word ''ball'' in English in the sense of a globular body that is played with was in 1205 in ''{{lang|la|[[Laȝamon's Brut, or Chronicle of Britain]]}}'' in the phrase, &quot;{{lang|la|Summe heo driuen balles wide ȝeond Þa feldes.}}&quot; The word came from the [[Middle English]] ''bal'' (inflected as ''ball-e, -es'', in turn from [[Old Norse]] ''böllr'' (pronounced {{IPA-non|bɔlːr|}}; compare Old Swedish ''baller,'' and Swedish ''boll'') from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''ballu-z,'' (whence probably Middle High German ''bal, ball-es,'' Middle Dutch ''bal''), a [[cognate]] with [[Old High German]] ''ballo, pallo,'' Middle High German balle from Proto-Germanic ''*ballon'' (weak masculine), and Old High German ''ballâ, pallâ,'' Middle High German ''balle,'' Proto-Germanic ''*ballôn'' (weak feminine). No Old English representative of any of these is known. (The answering forms in Old English would have been ''beallu, -a, -e'' -- compare ''bealluc, ballock''.) If ''ball-'' was native in Germanic, it may have been a cognate with the Latin ''foll-is'' in sense of a &quot;thing blown up or inflated.&quot; In the later Middle English spelling ''balle'' the word coincided graphically with the French ''balle'' &quot;ball&quot; and &quot;bale&quot; which has hence been erroneously assumed to be its source. French ''balle'' (but not ''boule'') is assumed to be of Germanic origin, itself, however.

==History==
A ball, as the essential feature in many forms of gameplay requiring physical exertion, must date from the very earliest times. A rolling object appeals not only to a [[human baby]] but to a [[kitten]] and a [[puppy]]. Some form of game with a ball is found portrayed on [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] monuments, and is played among aboriginal tribes at the present day. In [[Homer]], [[Nausicaa]] was playing at ball with her maidens when [[Odysseus]] first saw her in the land of the [[Phaeacia]]ns (Od. vi. 100). And Halios and Laodamas performed before [[Alcinous]] and Odysseus with ball play, accompanied with dancing (Od. viii. 370). The [[Jew|Hebrew]]s have no mention of the ball in their scriptures.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Ball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greeks===
Among the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] games with balls (σφαῖραι) were regarded as a useful subsidiary to the more violent athletic exercises, as a means of keeping the body supple, and rendering it graceful, but were generally left to boys and girls. Of regular rules for the playing of ball games, little trace remains, if there were any such. The names in Greek for various forms, which have come down to us in such works as the Ὀνομαστικόν of Pollux of [[Naucratis]], imply little or nothing of such; thus, ἀπόρραξις only means the putting of the ball on the ground with the open hand, οὐρανία, the flinging of the ball in the air to be caught by two or more players; φαινίνδα would seem to be a game of catch played by two or more, where feinting is used as a test of quickness and skill. Pollux (i. x. 104) mentions a game called ἐπίσκυρος, which has often been looked on as the origin of football. It seems to have been played by two sides, arranged in lines; how far there was any form of &quot;goal&quot; seems uncertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt;

===Ancient Romans===
Among the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], ball games were looked upon as an adjunct to the bath, and were graduated to the age and health of the bathers, and usually a place (sphaeristerium) was set apart for them in the baths (thermae). There appear to have been three types or sizes of ball, the [[Pila (ball)|pila]], or small ball, used in catching games, the [[Paganica (ball game)|paganica]], a heavy ball stuffed with feathers, and the [[Follis (ball game)|follis]], a leather ball filled with air, the largest of the three. This was struck from player to player, who wore a kind of [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlet]] on the arm. There was a game known as [[Trigon (game)|trigon]], played by three players standing in the form of a triangle, and played with the follis, and also one known as [[harpastum]], which seems to imply a &quot;scrimmage&quot; among several players for the ball. These games are known to us through the Romans, though the names are Greek.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt;

===Modern ball games===
The various modern games played with a ball or balls and subject to rules are treated under their various names, such as [[polo]], [[cricket]], [[football]], etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Dablink|Relation (mathematics) redirects here.  For a more general notion of relation, see [[Finitary relation]]. For a more combinatorial viewpoint, see [[Theory of relations]].}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''binary relation on''' a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' is a collection of [[ordered pair]]s of elements of ''A''. In other words, it is a [[subset]] of the [[Cartesian product]] ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = {{nowrap|''A'' × ''A''}}. More generally, a '''binary relation between''' two sets ''A'' and ''B'' is a subset of {{nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}}. The terms '''dyadic relation''' and '''2-place relation''' are synonyms for binary relations.

An example is the &quot;[[divides]]&quot; relation between the set of [[prime number]]s '''P''' and the set of [[integer]]s '''Z''', in which every prime ''p'' is associated with every integer ''z'' that is a [[divisibility|multiple]] of ''p'' (and not with any integer that is not a multiple of ''p'').  In this relation, for instance, the prime 2 is associated with numbers that include −4, 0, 6, 10, but not 1 or 9; and the prime 3 is associated with numbers that include 0, 6, and 9, but not 4 or 13.

Binary relations are used in many branches of mathematics to model concepts like &quot;[[inequality (mathematics)|is greater than]]&quot;, &quot;[[Equality (mathematics)|is equal to]]&quot;, and &quot;divides&quot; in [[arithmetic]], &quot;[[Congruence (geometry)|is congruent to]]&quot; in [[geometry]], &quot;is adjacent to&quot; in [[graph theory]], &quot;is [[orthogonal]] to&quot; in [[linear algebra]] and many more.  The concept of [[function (mathematics)|function]] is defined as a special kind of binary relation. Binary relations are also heavily used in [[computer science]].

A binary relation is the special case {{nowrap|1= ''n'' = 2}} of an [[finitary relation|''n''-ary relation]] ''R''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, that is, a set of [[tuple|''n''-tuple]]s where the ''j''th component of each ''n''-tuple is taken from the ''j''th domain ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; of the relation.

In some systems of [[axiomatic set theory]], relations are extended to [[class (mathematics)|classes]], which are generalizations of sets.  This extension is needed for, among other things, modeling the concepts of &quot;is an element of&quot; or &quot;is a subset of&quot; in [[set theory]], without running into logical inconsistencies such as [[Russell's paradox]].

== Formal definition ==
A binary relation ''R'' is usually defined as an ordered triple (''X'', ''Y'', ''G'') where ''X'' and ''Y'' are arbitrary sets (or classes), and ''G'' is a [[subset]] of the [[Cartesian product]] ''X'' × ''Y''.  The sets ''X'' and ''Y'' are called the '''[[domain (mathematics)|domain]]''' (or the set of departure) and '''[[codomain]]''' (or the set of destination), respectively, of the relation, and ''G'' is called its [[Graph of a function|graph]].

The statement (''x'',''y'') ∈ ''R'' is read &quot;''x'' '''is''' ''R'''''-related to''' ''y''&quot;, and is denoted by ''xRy'' or ''R''(''x'',''y'').  The latter notation corresponds to viewing ''R'' as the [[indicator function|characteristic function]] on &quot;X&quot; x &quot;Y&quot; for the set of pairs of ''G''.

The order of the elements in each pair of ''G'' is important:  if ''a'' ≠ ''b'', then ''aRb'' and ''bRa'' can be true or false, independently of each other.

===Is a relation more than its graph?===
According to the definition above, two relations with the same graph may be different, if they differ in the sets ''X'' and ''Y''.  For example, if ''G'' = {(1,2),(1,3),(2,7)}, then ('''Z''','''Z''', ''G''), ('''R''', '''N''', ''G''), and ('''N''', '''R''', ''G'') are three distinct relations.

Some mathematicians do not consider the sets ''X'' and ''Y'' to be part of the relation, and therefore define a binary relation as being a subset of ''X''×''Y'', that is, just the graph ''G''.  According to this view, the set of pairs {(1,2),(1,3),(2,7)} is a relation from any set that contains {1,2} to any set that contains {2,3,7}.

A special case of this difference in points of view applies to the notion of [[function (mathematics)|function]].  Most authors insist on distinguishing between a function's [[codomain]] and its [[range (mathematics)|range]]. Thus, a single &quot;rule&quot; like mapping every real number ''x'' to ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can lead to distinct functions ''f'':'''''R'''''→'''''R''''' and ''g'':'''''R'''''→'''''R'''''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, depending on the images under that rule are understood to be reals or, more particularly, non-negative reals.  But others view functions as simply sets of ordered pairs with unique first components.  This difference in perspectives does raise some nontrivial issues.  As an example, the former camp considers [[surjection|surjectivity]]—or being onto—as a property of functions, while the latter sees it as a relationship that functions may bear to sets.

Either approach is adequate for most uses, provided that one attends to the necessary changes in language, notation, and the definitions of concepts like [[restriction (mathematics)|restriction]]s, [[composition of relations|composition]], [[inverse relation]], and so on.  The choice between the two definitions usually matters only in very formal contexts, like [[category theory]].

&lt;!--WE MUST GET A GOOD PICTURE TO GO WITH THIS EXAMPLE--&gt;

Example: Suppose there are four objects {ball, car, doll, gun} and four persons {John, Mary, Ian, Venus}.  Suppose that John owns the ball, Mary owns the doll, and Venus owns the car.  Nobody owns the gun and Ian owns nothing. Then the binary relation &quot;is owned by&quot; is given as
: ''R''=({ball, car, doll, gun}, {John, Mary, Ian, Venus}, {(ball, John), (doll, Mary), (car, Venus)}).

Thus the first element of R is the set of objects, the second is the set of people, and the last element is a set of ordered pairs of the form (object, owner).

The pair (ball, John), denoted by &lt;sub&gt;ball&lt;/sub&gt;''R''&lt;sub&gt;John&lt;/sub&gt; means that the ball is owned by John.

Two different relations could have the same graph.  For example: the relation
: ({ball, car, doll, gun}, {John, Mary, Venus}, {(ball,John), (doll, Mary), (car, Venus)})
is different from the previous one as everyone is an owner.  But the graphs of the two relations are the same.

Nevertheless, ''R'' is usually identified or even defined as G(''R'') and &quot;an ordered pair (''x'', ''y'') ∈ G(''R'')&quot; is usually denoted as &quot;(''x'', ''y'') ∈ ''R''&quot;.

== Special types of binary relations ==
&lt;!-- [[functional relation]] redirects to this section --&gt;
Some important classes of binary relations ''R'' between ''X'' and ''Y'' are listed below.

Uniqueness properties:
*'''[[injective function|injective]]''' (also called '''left-unique'''&lt;ref name=kkm/&gt;): for all ''x'' and ''z'' in ''X'' and ''y'' in ''Y'' it holds that if ''xRy'' and ''zRy'' then ''x'' = ''z''.
*'''functional''' (also called '''right-unique'''&lt;ref name=kkm/&gt; or '''right-definite'''{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}): for all ''x'' in ''X'', and ''y'' and ''z'' in ''Y'' it holds that if ''xRy'' and ''xRz'' then ''y'' = ''z''; such a binary relation is called a [[partial function]].
*'''one-to-one''' (also written '''1-to-1'''): injective and functional.

Totality properties:
*'''left-total'''&lt;ref name=kkm&gt;Klip, Knauer and Mikhalev: p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;: for all ''x'' in ''X'' there exists a ''y'' in ''Y'' such that ''xRy'' (this property, although sometimes also referred to as ''total'', is different from the definition of ''total'' in the next section).
*'''[[surjective function|surjective]]''' (also called '''right-total'''&lt;ref name=kkm/&gt;): for all ''y'' in ''Y'' there exists an ''x'' in ''X'' such that ''xRy''.
*A '''[[correspondence (mathematics)|correspondence]]''': a binary relation that is both left-total and surjective.

Uniqueness and totality properties:
*A '''[[function (mathematics)|function]]''': a relation that is functional and left-total.
*A '''[[bijection]]''': a one-to-one correspondence; such a relation is a function and is said to be '''bijective'''.

== Relations over a set ==

If ''X'' = ''Y'' then we simply say that the binary relation is over ''X''. Or it is an '''endorelation''' over ''X''.  Some classes of endorelations are widely studied in [[graph theory]], where they're known as [[directed graph]]s.

The set of all binary relations '''''B'''''(X) on a set X is a [[semigroup with involution]] with the involution being the mapping of a relation to its inverse relation.

Some important classes of binary relations over a set ''X'' are:
*'''[[reflexive relation|reflexive]]''': for all ''x'' in ''X'' it holds that ''xRx''. For example, &quot;greater than or equal to&quot; is a reflexive relation but &quot;greater than&quot; is not.
*'''irreflexive''' (or '''strict'''): for all ''x'' in ''X'' it holds that '''not''' ''xRx''.  &quot;Greater than&quot; is an example of an irreflexive relation.
*'''[[coreflexive relation|coreflexive]]''': for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'' it holds that if ''xRy'' then ''x'' = ''y''.  &quot;Equal to and odd&quot; is an example of a coreflexive relation.
*'''[[symmetric relation|symmetric]]''': for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'' it holds that if ''xRy'' then ''yRx''.  &quot;Is a blood relative of&quot; is a symmetric relation, because ''x'' is a blood relative of ''y'' if and only if ''y'' is a blood relative of ''x''.
*'''[[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]]''': for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'' it holds that if ''xRy'' and ''yRx'' then ''x'' = ''y''.  &quot;Greater than or equal to&quot; is an antisymmetric relation, because if ''x''≥''y'' and ''y''≥''x'', then ''x''=''y''.
*'''[[asymmetric relation|asymmetric]]''': for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'' it holds that if ''xRy'' then '''not''' ''yRx''.  &quot;Greater than&quot; is an asymmetric relation, because if ''x''&amp;gt;''y'' then not ''y''&amp;gt;''x''.
*'''[[transitive relation|transitive]]''': for all ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' in ''X'' it holds that if ''xRy'' and ''yRz'' then ''xRz''. &quot;Is an ancestor of&quot; is a transitive relation, because if ''x'' is an ancestor of ''y'' and ''y'' is an ancestor of ''z'', then ''x'' is an ancestor of ''z''.
*'''[[total relation|total]]''': for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'' it holds that ''xRy'' or ''yRx'' (or both). &quot;Is greater than or equal to&quot; is an example of a total relation (this definition for ''total'' is different from the one in the previous section).
*'''[[Trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomous]]''': for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'' exactly one of ''xRy'', ''yRx'' or ''x'' = ''y'' holds. &quot;Is greater than&quot; is an example of a trichotomous relation.
*'''[[Euclidean relation|Euclidean]]''': for all ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' in ''X'' it holds that if ''xRy'' and ''xRz'', then ''yRz'' (and ''zRy''). Equality is a Euclidean relation because if ''x''=''y'' and ''x''=''z'', then ''y''=''z''.
*'''serial''': for all ''x'' in ''X'', there exists ''y'' in ''X'' such that ''xRy''.  &quot;Is greater than&quot; is a serial relation on the integers.  But it is not a serial relation on the positive integers, because there is no ''y'' in the positive integers such that 1&amp;gt;''y''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Yao|first = Y.Y.|coauthors = Wong, S.K.M.|title = Generalization of rough sets using relationships between attribute values|journal = Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Joint Conference on Information Sciences|year = 1995|pages = 30–33|url = http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~yyao/PAPERS/relation.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the &quot;Is less than&quot; is a serial relation on the positive integers (the natural numbers), the rational numbers and the real numbers. Every reflexive relation is serial.
*'''set-like''': for every ''x'' in ''X'', the [[Class (set theory)|class]] of all ''y'' such that ''yRx'' is a set. (This makes sense only if we allow relations on proper classes.) The usual ordering &amp;lt; on the class of ordinal numbers is set-like, while its inverse &amp;gt; is not.

A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive is called an [[equivalence relation]]. A relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive is called a [[partial order]].  A partial order that is total is called a [[total order]], ''simple order'', [[linear order]], or a chain.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph G. Rosenstein, ''Linear orderings'', Academic Press, 1982, ISBN 012597680, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; A linear order where every nonempty set has a [[least element]] is called a [[well-order]]. A relation that is symmetric, transitive, and serial is also reflexive.

== Operations on binary relations ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Preorder]] --&gt;
If ''R'' is a binary relation over ''X'' and ''Y'', then the following is a binary relation over ''Y'' and ''X'':
* '''[[Inverse relation|Inverse]]''' or '''converse''': ''R''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, defined as ''R''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; = {&amp;thinsp;(''y'', ''x'')&amp;thinsp;|&amp;thinsp;(''x'', ''y'') ∈ ''R''&amp;thinsp;}. A binary relation over a set is equal to its inverse if and only if it is symmetric. See also [[duality (order theory)]].

If ''R'' is a binary relation over ''X'', then each of the following is a binary relation over ''X'':
* '''Reflexive closure''': ''R''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt;, defined as ''R''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt; = {&amp;thinsp;(''x'', ''x'') | ''x'' ∈ ''X''&amp;thinsp;} ∪ ''R'' or the smallest reflexive relation over ''X'' containing ''R''. This can be seen to be equal to the intersection of all reflexive relations containing ''R''.
* '''Reflexive reduction''': ''R''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;≠&lt;/sup&gt;, defined as ''R''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;≠&lt;/sup&gt; = ''R'' \ {&amp;thinsp;(''x'', ''x'') | ''x'' ∈ ''X''&amp;thinsp;} or the largest [[irreflexive]] relation over ''X'' contained in ''R''.
* '''[[Transitive closure]]''': ''R''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, defined as the smallest transitive relation over ''X'' containing ''R''. This can be seen to be equal to the intersection of all transitive relations containing ''R''.
* '''[[Transitive reduction]]''': ''R''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, defined as a minimal relation having the same transitive closure as ''R''.
* '''Reflexive transitive closure''': ''R''&amp;thinsp;*, defined as ''R''&amp;thinsp;* = (''R''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt;, the smallest [[preorder]] containing ''R''.
* '''[[Reflexive transitive symmetric closure]]''': ''R''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;≡&lt;/sup&gt;, defined as the smallest [[equivalence relation]] over ''X'' containing ''R''.

If ''R'', ''S'' are binary relations over ''X'' and ''Y'', then each of the following is a binary relation:
* '''Union''': ''R'' ∪ ''S''  ⊆ ''X'' × ''Y'', defined as ''R'' ∪ ''S'' = {&amp;thinsp;(''x'', ''y'') | (''x'', ''y'') ∈ ''R'' or (''x'', ''y'') ∈ ''S''&amp;thinsp;}.
* '''Intersection''': ''R'' ∩ ''S''  ⊆ ''X'' × ''Y'', defined as ''R'' ∩ ''S'' = {&amp;thinsp;(''x'', ''y'') | (''x'', ''y'') ∈ ''R'' and (''x'', ''y'') ∈ ''S''&amp;thinsp;}.

If ''R'' is a binary relation over ''X'' and ''Y'', and ''S'' is a binary relation over ''Y'' and ''Z'', then the following is a binary relation over ''X'' and ''Z'': (see main article ''[[composition of relations]]'')
* '''Composition''': ''S''&amp;thinsp;∘&amp;thinsp;''R'', also denoted ''R''&amp;thinsp;''';'''&amp;thinsp;''S'' (or more ambiguously ''R''&amp;thinsp;∘&amp;thinsp;''S''), defined as ''S''&amp;thinsp;∘&amp;thinsp;''R'' = {&amp;thinsp;(''x'', ''z'') | there exists ''y'' ∈ ''Y'', such that (''x'', ''y'') ∈ ''R'' and (''y'', ''z'') ∈ ''S''&amp;thinsp;}. The order of ''R'' and ''S'' in the notation ''S''&amp;thinsp;∘&amp;thinsp;''R'', used here agrees with the standard notational order for [[composition of functions]].

===Complement===
If ''R'' is a binary relation over ''X'' and ''Y'', then the following too:
*The '''[[complement (set theory)|complement]]''' ''S'' is defined as ''x'' ''S'' ''y'' if not ''x'' ''R'' ''y''.

The complement of the inverse is the inverse of the complement.

If ''X'' = ''Y'' the complement has the following properties:
*If a relation is symmetric, the complement is too.
*The complement of a reflexive relation is irreflexive and vice versa.
*The complement of a [[strict weak order]] is a total preorder and vice versa.

The complement of the inverse has these same properties.

===Restriction===
The [[restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of a binary relation on a set ''X'' to a subset ''S'' is the set of all pairs (''x'', ''y'') in the relation for which ''x'' and ''y'' are in ''S''.

If a relation is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[irreflexive relation|irreflexive]], [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], [[asymmetric relation|asymmetric]], [[transitive relation|transitive]], [[total relation|total]], {{ml|Binary_relation|Relations_over_a_set|trichotomous}}, a [[partial order]], [[total order]], [[strict weak order]], {{ml|Strict_weak_order|Total_preorders|total preorder}} (weak order),  or an [[equivalence relation]], its restrictions are too.

However, the transitive closure of a restriction is a subset of the restriction of the transitive closure, i.e., in general not equal.

Also, the various concepts of [[completeness (order theory)|completeness]] (not to be confused with being &quot;total&quot;) do not carry over to restrictions. For example, on the set of [[real number]]s a property of the relation &quot;≤&quot; is that every [[empty set|non-empty]] subset ''S'' of '''R''' with an [[upper bound]] in '''R''' has a [[supremum|least upper bound]] (also called supremum) in '''R'''. However, for a set of rational numbers this supremum is not necessarily rational, so the same property does not hold on the restriction of the relation &quot;≤&quot; to the set of rational numbers.

The ''left-restriction'' (''right-restriction'', respectively) of a binary relation between ''X'' and ''Y'' to a subset ''S'' of its domain (codomain) is the set of all pairs (''x'', ''y'') in the relation for which ''x'' (''y'') is an element of ''S''.

==Sets versus classes==
Certain mathematical &quot;relations&quot;, such as &quot;equal to&quot;, &quot;member of&quot;, and &quot;subset of&quot;, cannot be understood to be binary relations as defined above, because  their domains and codomains cannot be taken to be sets in the usual systems of [[axiomatic set theory]].

For example, if we try to model the general concept of &quot;equality&quot; as a binary relation =, we must take the domain and codomain to be the &quot;set of all sets&quot;, which is not a set in the usual set theory.  The usual work-around to this problem is to select a &quot;large enough&quot; set ''A'', that contains all the objects of interest, and work with the restriction =&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; instead of =.

Similarly, the &quot;subset of&quot; relation ⊆ needs to be restricted to have domain and codomain ''P''(''A'') (the  power set of a specific set ''A''):  the resulting set relation can be denoted ⊆&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;. Also, the &quot;member of&quot; relation needs to be restricted to have domain ''A'' and codomain ''P''(''A'') to obtain a binary relation ∈&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; that is a set.

Another solution to this problem is to use a set theory with proper classes, such as [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]] or [[Morse–Kelley set theory]], and allow the domain and codomain (and so the graph) to be [[proper class]]es:  in such a theory, equality, membership, and subset are binary relations without special comment.  (A minor modification needs to be made to the concept of the ordered triple (''X'', ''Y'', ''G''), as normally a proper class cannot be a member of an ordered tuple; or of course one can identify the function with its graph in this context.)

In most mathematical contexts, references to the relations of equality, membership and subset are harmless because they can be understood implicitly to be restricted to some set in the context.

== The number of binary relations ==

The number of distinct binary relations on an ''n''-element set is 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; {{OEIS|id=A002416}}:
{{number of relations}}

Notes:
*The number of irreflexive relations is the same as that of reflexive relations.
*The number of {{ml|Partially_ordered_set|Strict_and_non-strict_partial_orders|strict partial orders}} (irreflexive transitive relations) is the same as that of partial orders.
*The number of strict weak orders is the same as that of total preorders.
*The total orders are the partial orders that are also total preorders. The number of preorders that are neither a partial order nor a total preorder is, therefore, the number of preorders, minus the number of partial orders, minus the number of total preorders, plus the number of total orders: 0, 0, 0, 3, and 85, respectively.
*the number of equivalence relations is the number of [[Partition of a set|partition]]s, which is the [[Bell number]].

The binary relations can be grouped into pairs (relation, {{ml|Binary_relation|Complement|complement}}), except that for ''n'' = 0 the relation is its own complement. The non-symmetric ones can be grouped into [[quadruple]]s (relation, complement, {{ml|Binary_relation|Operations on binary relations|inverse}}, inverse complement).

==Examples of common binary relations==

*[[order relation]]s, including [[strict order]]s:
** [[greater than]]
** greater than or equal to
** [[less than]]
** less than or equal to
** [[divides]] (evenly)
** is a [[subset]] of

*[[equivalence relation]]s:
** [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]]
** is [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to (for [[affine space]]s)
** is in [[bijection]] with
** [[isomorphism|isomorphy]]

*[[dependency relation]], a symmetric, reflexive relation.
*[[independency relation]], a symmetric, irreflexive relation.

The '''Braille''' system is a method that is widely used by [[blindness|blind]] people to read and write, and was the first digital form of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Daniels, 1996, &quot;Analog and Digital Writing&quot;, in ''The World's Writing Systems,'' p 886&lt;/ref&gt;

Braille was devised in 1825 by [[Louis Braille]], a blind Frenchman.&lt;ref name = &quot; Noëlle Roy &quot;&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each Braille character, or ''cell'', is made up of six dot positions, arranged in a [[rectangle]] containing two columns of three dots each. A dot may be raised at any of the six positions to form sixty-four (2&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) possible subsets, including the arrangement in which no dots are raised. For reference purposes, a particular permutation may be described by naming the positions where dots are raised, the positions being universally numbered 1 to 3, from top to bottom, on the left, and 4 to 6, from top to bottom, on the right. For example, dots 1-3-4 (⠍) would describe a cell with three dots raised, at the top and bottom in the left column and on top of the right column, i.e., the letter ''m''. The lines of horizontal Braille text are separated by a space, much like visible printed text, so that the dots of one line can be differentiated from the Braille text above and below. Punctuation is represented by its own unique set of characters.

==History==
The Braille system was based on a method of communication originally developed by [[Charles Barbier]] in response to [[Napoleon]]'s demand for a [[code]] that soldiers could use to communicate silently and without light at night called [[night writing]]. Barbier's system of sets of 12 embossed dots encoding each letter was too difficult for soldiers to perceive by touch, and was rejected by the military. In 1821 he visited the National Institute for the Blind in [[Paris]], [[France]], where he met Louis Braille. Braille identified the major failing of the code, which was that the human finger could not encompass the whole symbol without moving, and so could not move rapidly from one symbol to another. His modification was to use a 6 dot cell &amp;mdash; the Braille system &amp;mdash; which revolutionized written communication for the blind.

At first the system was a one-to-one transliteration of French, but soon various abbreviations and contractions were developed, creating a system much more like shorthand.

===Derivation===
Braille is derived from the Latin alphabet, albeit indirectly. In Braille's original system, the points were assigned according to the position of the letter within the [[collating sequence|alphabetic order]] of the French alphabet, with [[diacritic]] letters sorted at the end.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Loomis, 1942, ''The Braille Reference Book [for Grades I, I½, and II].''&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ten letters of the alphabet, ''A–J,'' use the upper four dot positions, 1, 2, 4, 5: ⠁⠃⠉⠙⠑⠋⠛⠓⠊⠚. These also stand for the numerals ''1–0'' in a system parallel to Hebrew [[gematria]] and Greek [[isopsephy]]. (Though the dots are assigned in no obvious order, the first three letters and lowest numerals, ''ABC ~ 123'' ⠁⠃⠉, and the vowels, ''AEI'' ⠁⠑⠊, have the fewest dots, whereas the even numerals ''4680'' are corners, ⠙⠋⠓⠚.)

The next ten letters, ''K–T,'' are identical to ''A–J,'' respectively, apart from the addition of a dot at position 3: ⠅⠇⠍⠝⠕⠏⠟⠗⠎⠞. The next ten letters are the same again, but with dots at both 3 and 6. Here ''W'' was left out as not being part of the basic alphabet; the order is ''U V X Y Z Ç É À È Ù'' ⠥⠧⠭⠽⠵⠯⠿⠷⠮⠾. The next ten, ending in W, are the same again, except that for this series only position 6 is used. These are ''Â Ê Î Ô Û Ë Ï Ü Ö W'' ⠡⠣⠩⠹⠱⠫⠻⠳⠪⠺. The A–J series lowered in dot space become punctuation: comma, semicolon, colon, period, (not used), exclamation point, parentheses, question mark, (not used), quotation marks: ⠂⠆⠒⠲⠢⠖⠶⠦⠔⠴. ''A'' and ''C'', which only use the top row, were lowered two spaces for the apostrophe and hyphen: ⠄⠤. In addition, a few letters used upper-space patterns which are not letters by themselves: 4 (by itself the [[acute accent]] for letters other than ''É'') with 3, 3-6, and 6 makes ''Ì, Ò,'' decimal point, ⠌⠬⠨; 4-5 with the same makes ''Ä,'' numeral sign, ellipsis: ⠜⠼⠸

==Form==

Braille can be seen as the world's first [[Binary numeral system|binary]] [[Character encoding|encoding]] scheme for representing the [[grapheme|characters]] of a [[writing system]]. The system as originally invented by Braille consists of two parts:
#A [[character encoding]] for mapping characters of the [[French language]] to [[tuple]]s of six [[bit]]s or ''dots''.
#A way of representing six-bit characters as raised dots in a Braille cell.

Today different Braille codes (or [[code page]]s) are used to map character sets of different languages to the six bit cells. Different Braille codes are also used for different uses like mathematics and music. However, because the six-dot Braille cell only offers 63 possible combinations (2&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; - 1 = 63), of which some are omitted because they feel the same (having the same dots pattern in a different position, e.g. ⠊ and ⠔), many Braille characters have different meanings based on their context. Therefore, character mapping is not one-to-one.

In addition to simple encoding, modern Braille transcription uses [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]]s to increase reading speed. (See: [[#Grade_2_Braille_contractions|Grade 2 Braille]])

==Writing Braille==
Braille may be produced using a ''[[slate and stylus]]'' in which each dot is created from the back of the page, writing in mirror image, by hand, or it may be produced on a Braille typewriter or ''[[Perkins Brailler]]'', or produced by a [[Braille embosser]] attached to a computer. It may also be rendered using a [[refreshable Braille display]].

Braille has been extended to an 8-dot code, particularly for use with Braille embossers and refreshable Braille displays. In 8-dot Braille the additional dots are added at the bottom of the cell, giving a matrix 4 dots high by 2 dots wide. The additional dots are given the numbers 7 (for the lower-left dot) and 8 (for the lower-right dot). Eight-dot Braille has the advantages that the case of an individual letter is directly coded in the cell containing the letter and that all the printable [[ASCII]] characters can be represented in a single cell. All 256 (2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;) possible combinations of 8 dots are encoded by the [[Unicode]] standard. Braille with six dots is frequently stored as [[Braille ASCII]].

The first ten letters of the alphabet are formed using only the top four dots (1, 2, 4, and 5). Reminiscent of [[Greek numerals]], these symbols also represent the digits 1 through 9 and 0&lt;ref name=CBA&gt;{{Citation

Omitting dot 3 from the letters U-Z and the five word symbols form nine digraphs (ch, gh, sh, th, wh, ed, er, ou, and ow) and the letter w.

This is just a small sample of some of the [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]]s that are used in Grade 2 Braille. More information about Grade 2 Braille is below in the section on [[#Braille transcription|Braille transcription]].

Braille also includes a number of whole word contractions, for example the word Braille becomes a three cell word brl.

===Unicode rendering table===
The Unicode standard encodes 8-dot Braille glyphs according to their binary appearance, rather than following the alphabetic order of any particular convention. Unicode defines the &quot;Braille Patterns&quot; character block in the hex codepoint range from 2800 to 28FF. Dot 1 corresponds to the [[least significant bit]] of the low byte of the Unicode scalar value, and dot 8 to the high bit of that byte.

Most [[Braille embosser]]s and [[refreshable Braille display]]s do not yet support the Unicode rendering table; instead they use [[Braille ASCII]] for 6-dot Braille.  Some embossers have proprietary control codes for 8-dot Braille and/or for full graphics mode (where dots may be placed anywhere on the page without leaving any space between Braille cells, hence continuous lines can be drawn in diagrams) but these are rarely used and are not standard.

===Page dimensions===
Most [[Braille embosser]]s support between 35 and 37 cells per line, and between 25 and 28 lines per page.

A manually-operated Perkins Braille typewriter supports a maximum of 42 cells per line (its margins are adjustable), and typical paper allows 25 lines per page.

A large interlining Stainsby has 36 cells per line and 18 lines per page.

An A4-sized Marburg Braille frame, which allows interpoint Braille (dots on both sides of the page, positioned [[phase|out of phase]] so they do not interfere with each other) has 30 cells per line and 27 lines per page.

A [[refreshable Braille display]] typically has one line of between 18 and 40 cells, although 80 is possible.

A key turning point for Braille literacy was the passage of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]], an [[act of Congress]] that moved thousands of children from specialized schools for the blind into [[Mainstreaming|mainstream]] public schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ranalli2008&quot;/&gt; Because only a small percentage of public schools could afford to train and hire Braille-qualified teachers, Braille literacy has declined since the law took effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ranalli2008&quot;/&gt; Braille literacy rates have improved slightly since the bill was passed, in part because of pressure from consumers and advocacy groups that has led 27 states to pass legislation mandating that children who are legally blind be given the opportunity to learn Braille.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruby Riles&quot; /&gt;

In 1998-99 there were approximately 55,200 legally blind children, but only 5,500 of them used Braille as their primary reading medium.&lt;ref name=Blind1999&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Braille education is crucial to literacy for a visually impaired child. A study conducted in the state of Washington found that people who learned Braille at an early age did just as well, if not better, than their sighted peers in several areas, including vocabulary and comprehension.  In the preliminary adult study, while evaluating the correlation between adult literacy skills and employment, it was found that 44% of the participants who had learned to read in Braille were unemployed, compared to the 77% unemployment rate of those who had learned to read using print.&lt;ref name=Ph2004&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, among the estimated 85,000 blind adults in the United States, 90% of those who are Braille literate are employed. Among adults who do not know Braille, only 33% are employed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ranalli2008&quot;/&gt; Statistically, history has proven that Braille reading proficiency provides an essential skill set that allows visually impaired children not only to compete with their sighted peers in a school environment, but also later in life as they enter the workforce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruby Riles&quot; /&gt;

Though Braille is thought to be the main way blind people read and write, in Britain (for example) out of the reported 2 million visually impaired population, it is estimated that only around 15-20 thousand people use Braille. Unfortunately, close to 18 thousand people are unable to use Braille because they lack [[Meissner's Corpuscles]], which allows them to feel through their fingers. Younger people are turning to electronic text on computers with [[screen reader]] software instead, a more portable communication method that they can also use with their friends. A debate has started on how to make Braille more attractive and for more teachers to be available to teach it.

==Braille transcription==

Although it is possible to transcribe Braille by simply substituting the equivalent Braille character for its printed equivalent, such a character-by-character transcription (known as ''Grade 1 Braille'') is used only by beginners.

Braille characters are much larger than their printed equivalents, and the standard 11&quot; by 11.5&quot; (28&amp;nbsp;cm &amp;times; 30&amp;nbsp;cm) page has room for only 25 lines of 43 characters. To reduce space and increase reading speed, virtually all Braille books are transcribed in what is known as ''Grade 2 Braille,'' which uses a system of [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]]s to reduce space and speed the process of reading. As with most human linguistic activities, Grade 2 Braille embodies a complex system of customs, styles, and practices. The Library of Congress's ''[http://loc.gov/nls/bds/manual/ Instruction Manual for Braille Transcribing]'' runs to nearly 200 pages. Braille transcription is skilled work, and Braille transcribers need to pass certification tests.

In English, the system of Grade 2 Braille [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]]s begins with a set of 23 words which are contracted to single characters. Thus the word ''but'' is contracted to the single letter ''b,'' ''can'' to ''c'', ''do'' to ''d'', and so on. Even this simple rule creates issues requiring special cases; for example, ''d'' is, specifically, an abbreviation of the verb ''do;'' the noun ''do'' representing the note of the musical scale is a different word, and must be spelled out.

Portions of words may be contracted, and many rules govern this process. For example, the character with dots 2-3-5 (the letter &quot;f&quot; lowered in the Braille cell) stands for &quot;ff&quot; when used in the middle of a word. At the beginning of a word, this same character stands for the word &quot;to&quot; although the character is written in Braille with no space following it; this contraction was removed in the [[Unified English Braille Code]]. At the end of a word, the same character represents an exclamation point.

One problem that can occur when reading Grade 2 Braille is that some contractions are closely similar, even when the words are not.  One example compares the contractions &quot;ll&quot;, meaning little, and &quot;lr&quot;, meaning letter from Barry Hampshire's &quot;Working with Braille&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hampshire, Barry. Working with Braille. Paris: Unesco P, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Braille notation for the letter &quot;r&quot; differs only by adding one dot to the letter &quot;l&quot;.  This causes greater confusion between words that are not as similar in normal print and can hinder the learning process of Grade 2 Braille.

The contraction rules take into account the linguistic structure of the word; thus, [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]]s are not to be used when their use would alter the usual Braille form of a base word to which a prefix or suffix has been added. And some portions of the transcription rules are not fully codified and rely on the judgment of the transcriber. Thus, when the contraction rules permit the same word in more than one way, preference is given to &quot;the contraction that more nearly approximates correct pronunciation.&quot;

[http://web.archive.org/web/20050329073830/http:/www.geocities.com/jyyne_2000/grade3.htm ''Grade 3 Braille''] is a system that includes many additional [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]]s, almost a shorthand; it is not used for publication, but is used mostly for individuals for their personal convenience.

==Braille reading techniques==
Since Braille is one of the few writing systems where tactile perception is used, as opposed to visual perception, a Braille reader must develop new skills.  One skill important for Braille readers is the ability to create smooth and even pressures when running one's fingers along the words.  There are many different styles and techniques used for the understanding and development of Braille, even though a study by B. F. Holland &lt;ref&gt;B.F. Holland, 'Speed and Pressure Factors in Braille Reading', ''Teachers Forum,'' Vol. 7, September 1934 p. 13-17&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that there is no specific technique that is superior to any other.

Another study by Lowenfield &amp; Abel &lt;ref&gt;B. Lowenfield and G. L. Abel, ''Methods of Teaching Braille Reading Efficiency of Children in Lower Senior Classes.'' Birmingham, Research Centre for the Education of the Visually Handicapped, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; shows that Braille could be read &quot;the fastest and best... by students who read using the index fingers of both hands.&quot;  Another important reading skill emphasized in this study is to finish reading the end of a line with the right hand and to find the beginning of the next line with the left hand simultaneously.  One final conclusion drawn by both Lowenfield and Abel is that children have difficulty using both hands independently where the right hand is the dominant hand.  But this hand preference does not correlate to other activities.

==Braille for other scripts==
:'' See main articles: [[Hebrew braille]], [[Japanese braille]], [[Korean braille]], [[Vietnamese braille]], [[Tibetan braille]], and [[Chinese braille]].
[[File:Rapperswil - Duftrosengarten 20080222 005.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Braille plate in ''Duftrosengarten'' in [[Rapperswil]], Switzerland]]

There are many extensions of Braille for additional letters with [[diacritic]]s, such as ''ç, ô, é''.

When Braille is adapted to languages that do not use the [[Latin alphabet]], the blocks are generally assigned to the new alphabet according to how it is transliterated into the Latin alphabet. The alphabetic order of the national script (and therefore the natural order of Latin Braille) is disregarded. Such is the case with Russian, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, and Chinese. Greek, for example, ''gamma'' is written as Latin ''g'', despite the fact that it has the alphabetic position of ''c''; Hebrew ''bet'', the second letter of the alphabet and [[cognate]] with the Latin letter ''b'', is sometimes pronounced /b/ and sometimes /v/, and is written ''b'' or ''v'' accordingly; Russian ''ts'' is written as ''c'', which is the usual letter for /ts/ in those Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet; and Arabic ''f'' is written as ''f'', despite being historically ''p'', and occurring in that part of the Arabic alphabet (between historic ''o'' and ''q''). [[Esperanto]] letters with circumflexes, ''ĉ'', ''ĝ'', ''ĥ'', ''ĵ'' and ''ŝ'', are written as those letters without circumflexes with a filled sixth dot. Therefore the letter ''ĵ'' has the same representation as the English ''w'' (⠺), to write a ''w'' in Esperanto dot 3 is filled (⠾). The ''ŭ'', used in Esperanto also, is as the ''u'' (⠥), but the first dot is moved to the fourth place (⠬).

Greater differences occur in Chinese Braille. In the case of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] Braille, which is based on [[Zhuyin]] rather than the Latin [[Pinyin]] alphabet, the traditional Latin Braille values are used for initial consonants and the simple vowels. However, on Latin Braille for many of the initial consonants and simple vowels (based on romanizations of a century ago){{Clarify|date=July 2010}}, but the blocks pull double duty, with different values depending on whether they are placed in syllable-initial or syllable-final position. For instance, the block for Latin ''k'' represents old-style Cantonese ''k'' (''g'' in [[Yale romanization|Yale]] and other modern romanizations) when initial, but ''aak'' when final, while Latin ''j'' represents Cantonese initial ''j'' but final ''oei''.

At least three adaptations of Braille have completely reassigned the Latin sound values of the blocks: Japanese Braille, Korean Braille, and Tibetan Braille. In [[Japanese Braille]], alphabetic signs for a consonant and vowel are combined into a single syllabic block; in [[Korean Braille]], the consonants have different syllable-initial and syllable-final forms. These modifications made Braille much more compatible with Japanese [[kana]] and Korean [[hangul]] but meant that the Latin sound values could not be maintained.

==Uses==
The current series of [[Banknotes of the Canadian dollar|Canadian banknotes]] has a [[Canadian currency tactile feature|tactile feature]] consisting of raised dots that indicate the denomination, allowing bills to be easily identified by visually impaired people. It does not use standard Braille; rather, the feature uses a system developed in consultation with blind and visually impaired Canadians after research indicated that not all potential users read Braille.

[[Mexican peso#Series D|Mexican bank notes]] and Indian Rupee notes also have special raised symbols to make them identifiable by the visually impaired.

In [[India]] there are instances where the parliament acts have been published in Braille, such as [http://www.hindu.com/2006/07/04/stories/2006070402351200.htm 'The Right to Information Act'].

In the United States, [http://www.ada.gov/ the Americans with Disabilities Act] requires various building signage to be in Braille.

'''Bastille Day''' is the [[France|French]] [[National Day|national holiday]] which is celebrated on July 14th of each year. In France, it is formally called '''La Fête Nationale''' (''The National Celebration'') and commonly '''le quatorze juillet''' (''the fourteenth of July''). It commemorates the 1790 [[Fête de la Fédération]], held on the first anniversary of the [[storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789; the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille fortress-prison was seen as a symbol of the uprising of the modern nation, and of the reconciliation of all the French inside the constitutional monarchy which preceded the [[First Republic (France)|First Republic]], during the [[French Revolution]]. Festivities are held on the morning of 14 July, on the [[Champs-Élysées]] avenue in [[Paris]] in front of the [[President of France|President of the Republic]].

==Events and traditions of the day==
The parade opens with [[cadet]]s from the [[École Polytechnique]], [[École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]], [[École Navale]], and so forth, then other [[infantry]] troops, then motorized troops; [[aircraft]] of the [[Patrouille de France]] arobatics ream fly above. In recent times, it has become customary to invite units from France's allies to the parade; in 2004 during the centenary of the [[Entente Cordiale]], [[British Armed Forces|British troops]] (the band of the [[Royal Marines]], the [[Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment]], [[Grenadier Guards]] and [[King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery]]) led the Bastille Day parade in Paris for the first time, with the [[Red Arrows]] flying overhead.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.entente-cordiale.org/en/6a_c.php?id=1&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the German 26th Airborne Brigade led the march followed by British Royal Marines. 

The [[President of the French Republic|president]] used to give an [[interview]] to members of the press, discussing the situation of the country, recent events and projects for the future. [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], elected [[President of the French Republic|president]] in 2007, has chosen not to give it. The President also holds a [[garden party]] at the [[Élysée Palace|Palais de l'Elysée]].

Article 17 of the [[Constitution of France]] gives the President the authority to [[pardon]] criminals and, since 1991, the President has pardoned many petty offenders (mainly traffic offences) on 14 July. In 2007, President Sarkozy declined to continue the practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plusnews.fr/articles/000942_sarkozy_enterre_la_grace_presidentielle.php Sarkozy enterre la grâce présidentielle du 14 juillet plus news.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===The storming of the Bastille===
{{main|Storming of the Bastille}}

On 17 May 1789, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] convened the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] to hear their grievances. The deputies of the [[Third Estate]] representing the common people (the two others were the [[Catholic Church]] and [[nobility]]) decided to break away and form a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]]. On 20 June the deputies of the Third Estate took the [[Tennis Court Oath]], swearing not to separate until a constitution had been established. They were gradually joined by delegates of the other estates; [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] started to recognize their validity on 27 June. The assembly re-named itself the National Constituent Assembly on 9 July, and began to function as a legislature and to draft a constitution. 

In the wake of the 11 July dismissal of [[Jacques Necker]], the people of [[Paris]], fearful that they and their representatives would be attacked by the royal military, and seeking to gain ammunition and gunpowder for the general populace, stormed the [[Bastille]], a fortress-prison in Paris which had often held people jailed on the basis of ''[[lettre de cachet|lettres de cachet]]'', arbitrary royal indictments that could not be appealed. Besides holding a large cache of ammunition and gunpowder, the Bastille had been known for holding political prisoners whose writings had displeased the royal government, and was thus a symbol of the [[political absolutism|absolutism]] of the monarchy. As it happened, at the time of the siege in July 1789 there were only seven inmates, none of great political significance.

When the crowd—eventually reinforced by mutinous ''[[Gardes Françaises|gardes françaises]]''—proved a fair match for the fort's defenders, Governor de Launay, the commander of the Bastille, capitulated and opened the gates to avoid a mutual massacre. However, possibly because of a misunderstanding, fighting resumed. Ninety-eight attackers and just one defender died in the actual fighting, but in the aftermath, de Launay and seven other defenders were killed, as was the 'prévôt des marchands' (roughly, mayor) [[Jacques de Flesselles]].

The storming of the Bastille was more important as a rallying point and symbolic act of rebellion than a practical act of defiance. 

Shortly after the storming of the Bastille, on 4 August [[feudalism]] was abolished and on 26 August, the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] proclaimed.

===The ''Fête de la Fédération''===
{{main|Fête de la Fédération}}

The Fête de la Fédération of the 14 July 1790 was a huge feast and official event to celebrate the uprising of the short-lived [[constitutional monarchy]] in France and what people considered the happy conclusion of the [[French Revolution]]. The event took place on the Champ de Mars, which was at the time far outside Paris. The place had been transformed on a voluntary basis by the population of Paris itself, in what was recalled as the Journée des brouettes (&quot;Wheelbarrow Day&quot;).

A mass was celebrated by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]], [[bishop of Autun]]. The popular [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|General Lafayette]], as captain of the National Guard of Paris and confidant of the king, took his oath to the constitution, followed by the King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. After the end of the official celebration, the day ended in a huge four-day popular feast and people celebrated with fireworks, as well as fine wine and running naked through the streets in order to display their great freedom.

===Origin of the present celebration===
On 30 June 1878, a feast had been arranged in Paris by official decision to honour the French Republic (the event was commemorated in a painting by [[Claude Monet]]). On the 14 July 1879, another feast took place, with a semi-official aspect; the events of the day included a military review in Longchamp, a reception in the Chamber of Deputies, organised and presided over by [[Léon Gambetta]], and a Republican Feast in the [[Bois de Boulogne|Pré Catelan]] with [[Louis Blanc]] and [[Victor Hugo]]. All through France, as ''[[Le Figaro]]'' wrote on the 16th, &quot;people feasted much  to honour the Bastille&quot;.

On 21 May 1880, [[Benjamin Raspail]] proposed a law to have &quot;the Republic choose the 14 July as a yearly national holiday&quot;. The Assembly voted in favour of the proposol on 21 May and 8 June. The Senate approved on it 27 and 29 June, favouring 14 July against 4 August (honouring the [[French Revolution from the abolition of feudalism to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy#The abolition of feudalism|end of the feudal system]] on 4 August 1789). The law was made official on 6 July 1880, and the Ministry of the Interior recommended to Prefects that the day should be &quot;celebrated with all the brilliance that the local resources allow&quot;. Indeed, the celebrations of the new holiday in 1880 were particularly magnificent.

In the debate leading up to the adoption of the holiday, [[Henri Martin (historian)|Henri Martin]], chairman of the French Senate, addressed that chamber on 29 June 1880. &quot;Do not forget that behind this 14&amp;nbsp;July, where victory of the new era over the ''[[ancien régime]]'' was bought by fighting, do not forget that after the day of 14&amp;nbsp;July 1789, there was the day of 14&amp;nbsp;July 1790. ... This [latter] day cannot be blamed for having shed a drop of blood, for having divided the country. It was the consecration of the unity of France. ... If some of you might have scruples against the first 14&amp;nbsp;July, they certainly hold none against the second. Whatever difference which might part us, something hovers over them, it is the great images of national unity, which we all desire, for which we would all stand, willing to die if necessary.&quot;

=== Bastille Day Military Parade ===
{{main|Bastille Day Military Parade}}
The [[Bastille Day Military Parade]] is the French [[military parade]] that has been held on the morning of 14 July each year in [[Paris]] since 1880. While previously held elsewhere within or near the capital city, since 1918 it has been held on the [[Champs-Elysées]], with the evident agreement of the Allies as represented in the Versailles Peace Conference, and with the exception of the period of German occupation from 1940 to 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garnison-paris.terre.defense.gouv.fr/14juillet2008/les-coulisses/historique-du-defile.htm] 'Défilé du 14 juillet, des origines à nos jours' (14 July Parade, from its origins to the present)&lt;/ref&gt; The parade passes down the Champs-Elysées from the [[Arc de Triomphe]] to the [[Place de la Concorde]], where the [[President of the French Republic]], his government and foreign ambassadors to France stand. This is a popular event in [[France]], broadcast on French TV, and is the oldest and largest regular military parade in the world.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} In some years, invited detachments of foreign troops take part in the parade and foreign statesmen attend as guests. It also has notable connections with war memorials in the United Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} The [[Scottish National War Memorial]] within [[Edinburgh Castle]] was opened on the same day in 1917 by the Prince of Wales, commemorating members of the Scottish military who died during World War I, before the signing of the Treaty of Versailles (which marked the official end of the war).

Smaller military parades are held in French garrison towns, including [[Toulon]] and [[Belfort]], with local troops.

}}
'''Blowfish''' is a [[key (cryptography)|key]]ed, [[symmetric key algorithm|symmetric]] [[block cipher]], designed in 1993 by [[Bruce Schneier]] and included in a large number of cipher suites and encryption products. Blowfish provides a good encryption rate in software and no effective [[cryptanalysis]] of it has been found to date. However, the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] now receives more attention.

Schneier designed Blowfish as a general-purpose algorithm, intended as an alternative to the aging [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] and free of the problems and constraints associated with other algorithms. At the time Blowfish was released, many other designs were proprietary, encumbered by [[patent]]s or were commercial/government secrets. Schneier has stated that, &quot;Blowfish is unpatented, and will remain so in all countries. The algorithm is hereby placed in the [[public domain]], and can be freely used by anyone.&quot;

Notable features of the design include key-dependent [[S-box]]es and a highly complex [[key schedule]].

==The algorithm==
Blowfish has a 64-bit [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] and a variable [[key length]] from 1 bit up to 448 bits.&lt;ref name=blowfish-paper&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Bruce Schneier]] |year=1993 |title=Description of a New Variable-Length Key, 64-Bit Block Cipher (Blowfish) |url=http://www.schneier.com/paper-blowfish-fse.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a 16-round [[Feistel cipher]] and uses large key-dependent [[Substitution box|S-boxes]]. It is similar in structure to [[CAST-128]], which uses fixed S-boxes.

[[Image:BlowfishDiagram.png|left|thumbnail|216px|The Feistel structure of Blowfish]]

The diagram to the left shows the action of Blowfish. Each line represents 32 bits. The algorithm keeps two subkey arrays: the 18-entry P-array and four 256-entry S-boxes. The S-boxes accept 8-bit input and produce 32-bit output. One entry of the P-array is used every round, and after the final round, each half of the data block is [[Exclusive or|XORed]] with one of the two remaining unused P-entries.

The diagram to the upper right shows Blowfish's F-function. The function splits the 32-bit input into four eight-bit quarters, and uses the quarters as input to the S-boxes. The outputs are added [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; and XORed to produce the final 32-bit output.

Decryption is exactly the same as encryption, except that P1, P2,..., P18 are used in the reverse order. This is not so obvious because xor is commutative and associative. A common mistake is to use inverse order of encryption as decryption algorithm (i.e. first XORing P17 and P18 to the ciphertext block, then using the P-entries in reverse order).

Blowfish's [[key schedule]] starts by initializing the P-array and S-boxes with values derived from the [[hexadecimal]] digits of [[pi]], which contain no obvious pattern (see [[nothing up my sleeve number]]). The secret key is then, byte by byte, cycling the key if necessary, XORed with all the P-entries in order. A 64-bit all-zero block is then encrypted with the algorithm as it stands. The resultant ciphertext replaces P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The same ciphertext is then encrypted again with the new subkeys, and P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are replaced by the new ciphertext. This continues, replacing the entire P-array and all the S-box entries. In all, the Blowfish encryption algorithm will run 521 times to generate all the subkeys - about 4KB of data is processed.

Because the P-array is 576 bits long, and the key bytes are XORed through all these 576 bits during the initialization, many implementations support key sizes up to 576 bits. While this is certainly possible, the 448 bits limit is here to ensure that every bit of every subkey depends on every bit of the key,&lt;ref name=blowfish-paper&gt;http://www.schneier.com/paper-blowfish-fse.html&lt;/ref&gt; as the last four values of the P-array don't affect every bit of the ciphertext. This point should be taken in consideration for implementations with a different number of rounds, as even though it increases security against an exhaustive attack, it weakens the security guaranteed by the algorithm. And given the slow initialization of the cipher with each change of key, it is granted a natural protection against brute-force attacks, which doesn't really justify key sizes longer than 448 bits.

==Cryptanalysis of Blowfish==
There is no effective [[cryptanalysis]] on the full-round version of Blowfish known publicly {{as of|2011|lc=on}}. A [[sign extension]] bug in one publication of C code has been identified.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.schneier.com/blowfish-bug.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Serge Vaudenay]] found a known-plaintext attack requiring 2&lt;sup&gt;8''r'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt; known plaintexts to break, where ''r'' is the number of rounds. Moreover, he also found a class of [[weak key]]s that can be detected and broken by the same attack with only 2&lt;sup&gt;4''r'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt; known plaintexts. This attack cannot be used against the regular Blowfish; it assumes knowledge of the key-dependent S-boxes. [[Vincent Rijmen]], in his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis, introduced a second-order differential attack that can break four rounds and no more.&lt;ref name=rijmen-phd /&gt; There remains no known way to break the full 16 rounds, apart from a [[brute-force search]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vaudenay-weak-keys&quot;&gt;

==Blowfish in practice==
Blowfish is a fast [[block cipher]], except when changing keys. Each new [[key (cryptography)|key]] requires pre-processing equivalent to encrypting about 4 kilobytes of text, which is very slow compared to other block ciphers. This prevents its use in certain applications, but is not a problem in others. In one application, it is actually a benefit: the [[password]]-hashing method used in [[OpenBSD]] uses an algorithm derived from Blowfish that makes use of the slow key schedule; the idea is that the extra computational effort required gives protection against [[dictionary attack]]s. ''See'' [[key stretching]].

Blowfish has a memory footprint of just over 4 kilobytes of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]]. This constraint is not a problem even for older desktop and [[laptop computers]], though it does prevent use in the smallest [[embedded systems]] such as early [[smartcard]]s.

Blowfish was one of the first secure block ciphers not subject to any patents and therefore freely available for anyone to use. This benefit has contributed to its popularity in cryptographic software.

[[Image:Bijection.svg|thumb|200px|A bijective function, f:X→Y, where set X is {1,2,3,4} and set Y is {A,B,C,D}. For example, f(1)=D.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''bijection''', or a '''bijective function''', is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' from a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' to a set ''Y'' with the property that, for every ''y'' in ''Y'', there is exactly one ''x'' in ''X'' such that ''f''(''x'') = ''y''. It follows from this definition that no unmapped element exists in either ''X'' or ''Y''.

Alternatively, ''f'' is bijective if it is a '''one-to-one correspondence''' between those sets; [[id est|i.e.]], both '''one-to-one''' ([[injective function|injective]]) and '''onto''' ([[surjective function|surjective]]).

For example, consider the function ''succ'', defined from the set of [[integer]]s &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt;, that to each integer ''x'' associates the integer succ(''x'') = ''x'' + 1.  For another example, consider the function ''sumdif'' that to each pair (''x'',''y'') of real numbers associates the pair sumdif(''x'',''y'') = (''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''y'').

A bijective function from a set to itself is also called a '''[[permutation]]'''.

The set of all bijections from ''X'' to ''Y'' is denoted as ''X'' ↔ ''Y''.  (Sometimes this notation is reserved for [[binary relation]]s, and bijections are denoted by ''X'' ⤖ ''Y'' instead.)  Occasionally, the set of permutations of a single set ''X'' may be denoted ''X''!.

Bijective functions play a fundamental role in many areas of mathematics, for instance in the definition of [[isomorphism]] (and related concepts such as [[homeomorphism]] and [[diffeomorphism]]), [[permutation group]], [[projective map]], and many others.

==Composition and inverses==
A function ''f'' is bijective if and only if its [[inverse relation]]  ''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; is a function.  In that case, ''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; is also a bijection.

The [[composition (mathematics)|composition]] &lt;math&gt;g\circ f&lt;/math&gt; of two bijections &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g:Y\to Z&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection. The inverse of &lt;math&gt;g\circ f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(g\circ f)^{-1}=(f^{-1})\circ(g^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Bijective composition.svg|thumb|300px|A bijection composed of an injection (left) and a surjection (right).]]
Conversely, if the composition &lt;math&gt;g\circ f&lt;/math&gt; of two functions is bijective, we can only say that ''f'' is [[Injective function|injective]] and ''g'' is [[Surjective function|surjective]].

A relation ''f'' from ''X'' to ''Y'' is a bijective function if and only if there exists another relation ''g'' from ''Y'' to ''X'' such that  &lt;math&gt;g\circ f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity function]] on ''X'', and &lt;math&gt;f\circ g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity function]] on ''Y''.  Consequently, the sets have the same cardinality.

==Bijections and cardinality==
If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set]]s, then there exists a bijection between the two sets ''X'' and ''Y'' [[iff]] ''X'' and ''Y'' have the same number of elements. Indeed, in [[axiomatic set theory]], this is taken as the very ''definition'' of &quot;same number of elements&quot;, and generalising this definition to [[infinite set]]s leads to the concept of [[cardinal number]], a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets.

==Examples and counterexamples==
* For any set ''X'', the [[identity function]] id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; from ''X'' to ''X'', defined by id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''x'', is bijective.
* The function ''f'' from the [[real line]] '''R''' to '''R''' defined by ''f''(''x'') = 2''x'' + 1 is bijective, since for each ''y'' there is a unique ''x'' = (''y''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/2 such that ''f''(''x'') = ''y''.
* The [[exponential function]] ''g''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R''' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; '''R''', with ''g''(''x)'' = e&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, is not bijective: for instance, there is no ''x'' in '''R''' such that ''g''(''x'') = −1, showing that ''g'' is not surjective.  However if the [[codomain]] is restricted to the positive real numbers '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = (0,+∞), then ''g'' becomes bijective; its inverse is the [[natural logarithm]] function ln.
* The function ''h''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R''' → [0,+∞) with ''h(x)'' = ''x''² is not bijective: for instance, ''h''(−1) = ''h''(+1) = 1, showing that ''h''  is not injective.  However, if the [[domain of a function|domain]] is restricted to &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,+∞)&lt;/nowiki&gt;, then ''h'' becomes bijective; its inverse is the positive square root function.

== Properties ==
* A function ''f'' from the [[real line]] '''R''' to  '''R''' is bijective if and only if its plot is intersected by any horizontal or vertical line at exactly one point.
* If ''X'' is a set, then the bijective functions from ''X'' to itself, together with the operation of functional composition (∘), form a [[group (algebra)|group]], the [[symmetric group]] of ''X'', which is denoted variously by S(''X''), ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, or ''X''! (the last reads &quot;''X'' [[factorial]]&quot;).
* For a subset ''A'' of the domain with [[cardinality]] |''A''| and subset ''B'' of the codomain with cardinality |''B''|, one has the following equalities:
:|''f''(''A'')| = |''A''| and |''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'')| = |''B''|.
*If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set]]s with the same cardinality, and ''f'':&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'', then the following are equivalent:
:# ''f'' is a bijection.
:# ''f'' is a [[surjection]].
:# ''f'' is an [[injection (mathematics)|injection]].
*At least for a finite set ''S'', there is a bijection between the set of possible [[total ordering]]s of the elements and the set of bijections from ''S'' to ''S''.  That is to say, the number of [[permutation]]s of elements of ''S'' is the same as the number of total orderings of that set—namely, ''n''!.

==Bijections and category theory==
Formally, bijections are precisely the [[isomorphism]]s in the [[category theory|category]] [[Category of sets|'''Set''']] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and functions.  However, the bijections are not always the isomorphisms.  For example, in the category [[Category of topological spaces|'''Top''']] of [[topological space]]s and [[continuous functions|continuous]] functions, the isomorphisms must be [[homeomorphism]]s in addition to being bijections.

{{distinguish|Boolean function|Indicator function}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''binary function''', or '''function of two variables''', is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] which takes two inputs.

Precisely stated, a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is binary if there exists [[Set (mathematics)|set]]s &lt;math&gt;X, Y, Z&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\,f \colon X \times Y \rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;X \times Y&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Cartesian product]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if '''Z''' is the set of [[integer]]s, '''N'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the set of [[natural number]]s (except for zero), and '''Q''' is the set of [[rational number]]s, then [[division (mathematics)|division]] is a binary function from '''Z''' and '''N'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to '''Q'''.

[[Naive set theory|Set-theoretically]], one may represent a binary function as a [[subset]] of the [[Cartesian product]] ''X'' × ''Y'' × ''Z'', where (''x'',''y'',''z'') belongs to the subset [[if and only if]]      ''f''(''x'',''y'') = ''z''.
Conversely, a subset ''R'' defines a binary function if and only if, [[for any]] ''x'' in ''X'' and ''y'' in ''Y'', [[there exists]] a [[unique]] ''z'' in ''Z'' such that (''x'',''y'',''z'') belongs to ''R''.
We then define ''f'' (''x'',''y'') to be this ''z''.

Alternatively, a binary function may be interpreted as simply a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from ''X'' × ''Y'' to ''Z''.
Even when thought of this way, however, one generally writes ''f'' (''x'',''y'') instead of ''f''((''x'',''y'')).
(That is, the same pair of parentheses is used to indicate both [[function application]] and the formation of an [[ordered pair]].)

In turn, one can also derive ordinary functions of one variable from a binary function.
Given any element ''x'' of ''X'', there is a function ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, or ''f'' (''x'',·), from ''Y'' to ''Z'', given by ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;(''y'') := ''f'' (''x'',''y'').
Similarly, given any element ''y'' of ''Y'', there is a function ''f'' &lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, or ''f''  (·,''y''), from ''X'' to ''Z'', given by ''f'' &lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') := ''f''  (''x'',''y''). (In computer science, this identification between a function from ''X'' × ''Y'' to ''Z'' and a function from ''X'' to ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;''Y''&lt;/sup&gt; is called [[Currying]].)

The various concepts relating to functions can also be generalised to binary functions.
For example, the division example above is ''[[surjective function|surjective]]'' (or ''onto'') because every rational number may be expressed as a quotient of an integer and a natural number.
This example is ''[[injective function|injective]]'' in each input separately, because the functions ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''f'' &lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; are always injective.
However, it's not injective in both variables simultaneously, because (for example) ''f'' (2,4) = ''f'' (1,2).

One can also consider ''partial'' binary functions, which may be defined only for certain values of the inputs.
For example, the division example above may also be interpreted as a partial binary function from '''Z''' and '''N''' to '''Q''', where '''N''' is the set of all natural numbers, including zero.
But this function is undefined when the second input is zero.

A [[binary operation]] is a binary function where the sets ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' are all equal; binary operations are often used to define [[algebraic structure]]s.

In [[linear algebra]], a [[bilinear operator|bilinear transformation]] is a binary function where the sets ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' are all [[vector space]]s and the derived functions ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; are all [[linear transformation]]s.
A bilinear transformation, like any binary function, can be interpreted as a function from ''X'' × ''Y'' to ''Z'', but this function in general won't be linear.
However, the bilinear transformation can also be interpreted as a single linear transformation from the [[tensor product]] &lt;math&gt;X \otimes Y&lt;/math&gt; to ''Z''.

The concept of binary function generalises to ''ternary'' (or ''3-ary'') ''function'', ''quaternary'' (or ''4-ary'') ''function'', or more generally to ''n-ary function'' for any [[natural number]] ''n''.
A ''0-ary function'' to ''Z'' is simply given by an element of ''Z''.
One can also define an ''A-ary function'' where ''A'' is any [[Set (mathematics)|set]]; there is one input for each element of ''A''.

In [[category theory]], ''n''-ary functions generalise to ''n''-ary morphisms in a [[multicategory]].
The interpretation of an ''n''-ary morphism as an ordinary morphisms whose domain is some sort of product of the domains of the original ''n''-ary morphism will work in a [[monoidal category]].
The construction of the derived morphisms of one variable will work in a [[closed monoidal category]].
The category of sets is closed monoidal, but so is the category of vector spaces, giving the notion of bilinear transformation above.

'''''Blue Velvet''''' is a 1986 American [[mystery film]] written and directed by [[David Lynch]]. The movie exhibits elements of both [[film noir]] and [[surrealism]]. The film features [[Kyle MacLachlan]], [[Isabella Rossellini]], [[Dennis Hopper]], and [[Laura Dern]]. The title is taken from the 1963 [[Bobby Vinton]] [[Blue Velvet (song)|song of the same name]]. Although initially detested by some mainstream critics, the film is now widely acclaimed,&lt;ref name=&quot;rottentomatoes&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Blue Velvet (1986) | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blue_velvet/ | accessdate=2007-06-17 | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Blue Velvet (1986): Reviews | url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/bluevelvet?q=blue%20velvet/ | accessdate=2007-06-11 | publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned Lynch his second [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Director. As an example of a director casting against the norm, ''Blue Velvet'' is also noted for re-launching Hopper's career and for providing Rossellini with a dramatic outlet beyond the work as a fashion model and a cosmetics spokeswoman for which she had until then been known.

After the commercial and critical failure of Lynch's ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'' (1984), he made attempts at developing a more &quot;personal story&quot;, somewhat characteristic of his surreal style he displayed in his debut ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (1977). The screenplay of ''Blue Velvet'' had been passed around multiple times in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with many major studios declining it because of its strong sexual and violent content.&lt;ref name=&quot;rodley&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Lynch | first=David | authorlink=David Lynch | coauthors=Chris Rodley (editor) | title=Lynch on Lynch | publisher=[[Faber &amp; Faber]] | date=March 24, 2005 | isbn=0-571-22018-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The independent studio [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]], which was owned at the time by Italian film producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]], agreed to finance and produce the film. Since its initial theatrical release, ''Blue Velvet'' has achieved [[cult film|cult]] status, significant academic attention and is widely regarded as one of Lynch's finest works, alongside ''Eraserhead'' and ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001). It is also seen by many critics as representing a modern-day version of film-noir, &quot;[[neo-noir]]&quot;, present in many thrillers from the early 1980s to the mid 1990s.

The film centers on [[college student]] Jeffrey Beaumont (Maclachlan), who, returning from visiting his ill father in the hospital, comes across a human ear in a field in his hometown of Lumberton. He proceeds to investigate the ear with help from a high school student, Sandy Williams (Dern), who provides him with information and leads from her father, a local police detective. Jeffrey's investigation draws him deeper into his hometown's seedy underworld, and sees him forming a sexual relationship with the alluring torch singer, Dorothy Vallens (Rossellini), and uncovering psychotic criminal [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] (Hopper), who engages in [[drug abuse]], kidnapping, and sexual violence.

==Plot==
Jeffrey Beaumont ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]) returns to his logging home town of Lumberton from Oak Lake College after his father (Jack Harvey) suffers a near fatal stroke. While walking home from the hospital, he cuts through a vacant lot and discovers a severed ear. Jeffrey takes the ear to Police Detective John Williams ([[George Dickerson]]), through whom he meets the detective's daughter, Sandy ([[Laura Dern]]). She tells him details about the ear case and a suspicious woman, Dorothy Vallens ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) who may be connected to the case. Increasingly curious, Jeffrey enters Dorothy's apartment by posing as an exterminator, and while Dorothy is distracted by a man (Fred Pickler) dressed in a yellow suit at her door, steals her spare key. Jeffrey and Sandy attend Dorothy's nightclub act at the Slow Club and leave early so Jeffrey can sneak into her apartment to snoop. He hurriedly hides in a closet when she returns home. However, Dorothy, wielding a knife, finds him and threatens to hurt him. Thinking his curiosity is merely sexual and aroused by his voyeurism, Dorothy makes Jeffrey undress at knifepoint and [[fellatio|fellates]] him. Their encounter is interrupted by a knock at the door, and Dorothy hides Jeffrey in the closet. From there, he witnesses the visitor, [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] ([[Dennis Hopper]]), inflict his bizarre sexual proclivities — which include inhaling an unidentified gas, possibly [[Nitrous Oxide]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Flesh and Fantasy&quot; ''New York Magazine'', Sep 29, 1986, p 85&lt;/ref&gt; (although in the 2002 Special edition DVD version of the film, Hopper has stated it was [[Amyl nitrite]]), [[Non-penetrative sex|dry humping]], and [[sadomasochism]] — upon Dorothy. Frank is an extremely foul-mouthed, violent [[Psychopathy|sociopath]] whose orgasmic climax is a fit of both pleasure and rage. Frank has kidnapped Dorothy's husband and son to force her to perform sexual favors. When Frank leaves, a sad and desperate Dorothy tries to [[Seduction|seduce]] Jeffrey again and demands that he hit her, but when he refuses, she loses interest in sex and asks to be left alone. When Jeffrey moves to leave, she asks him to stay.

While attending another of Dorothy's performances at the Slow Club, where she sings the song &quot;[[Blue Velvet (song)|Blue Velvet]]&quot;, Jeffrey spots Frank in the audience fondling a piece of blue-velvet fabric he cut from Dorothy's robe. Later, in the car park, Jeffrey watches Frank and his cohorts drive away before going to Dorothy's apartment again. Jeffrey spends the next few days spying on Frank, whom he sees entering a building. Shortly afterwards, a well-dressed man and the Yellow Man exit the building. He concludes the men are criminal associates of Frank. Jeffrey again visits Dorothy, who seduces him and asks him to strike her. When he refuses, she pressures him, becoming more emotional. In a blind rage he knocks her backwards and is instantly horrified, but Dorothy, as a result of Frank's constant beatings{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, derives pleasure from it. Jeffrey, for the first time experiences a moment of anger and pleasure in a blinding rage when he hits Dorothy during this sexual encounter.

Afterwards, Frank catches Dorothy and Jeffrey together and forces them both to accompany him to the apartment of Ben ([[Dean Stockwell]]), a suave dandy, partner in crime (Ben is holding Dorothy's son) and [[drug dealer]]. In a bizarre but now iconic scene, Ben [[lip-syncs]] a performance of [[Roy Orbison]]'s &quot;[[In Dreams (song)|In Dreams]]&quot;, sending Frank into maudlin sadness, then rage. Frank takes Jeffrey to a lumber yard and savagely beats him to the overture of &quot;In Dreams&quot;. Jeffrey wakes the next day and goes home, where he is overcome with conflicting emotions, chief among them, guilt and despair. He goes to the police station, where he notices that Sandy's father's partner is Gordon — the Yellow Man. Later at Sandy's home, her father is amazed by Jeffrey's story, but warns Jeffrey to stop his amateur sleuthing lest he endanger himself and the investigation. After attending a dance party where they profess their love for each other, Jeffrey and Sandy are tailed on their way home. Fearing the follower is Frank, Jeffrey is relieved to discover that it is only Sandy's jealous ex-boyfriend. A confrontation is averted when the group finds a naked and distressed Dorothy on Jeffrey's front lawn. Barely conscious, Dorothy calls Jeffrey &quot;My lover&quot; and through this reveals that she slept with Jeffrey, causing an upset Sandy to slap Jeffrey, although she later forgives him.

Jeffrey insists on returning to Dorothy's apartment and tells Sandy to send her father there immediately. At Dorothy's apartment, Jeffrey finds the [[catatonic]] Yellow Man and the dead body of Dorothy's husband, with a missing ear.  The Yellow Man stands next to him, [[lobotomy|lobotomized]] by a ricocheted bullet.  When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the well-dressed man coming up the stairs and recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Detective Williams over the Yellow Man's police radio, but lies about his location inside the apartment. Frank enters the apartment and brags about hearing Jeffrey's location over his own police radio. While Frank searches for him in the apartment, Jeffrey retrieves the Yellow Man's gun and shoots Frank with it. Detective Williams arrives with Sandy in tow. With their lives back to normal, Jeffrey and Sandy, along with Dorothy and her son (Jon- Jon Snipes), are reunited.

The actual story of the film originated from three ideas that crystallized in the filmmaker's mind over a period of time starting as early as 1973. The first idea was only &quot;a feeling&quot; and the title ''Blue Velvet'', Lynch told ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'' in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;cineaste&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bouzereau |first=Laurent |year=1987 |title=An Interview with David Lynch |journal=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]] |pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second idea was an image of a severed, human ear lying in a field. &quot;I don't know why it had to be an ear. Except it needed to be an opening of a part of the body, a hole into something else...The ear sits on the head and goes right into the mind so it felt perfect&quot;, Lynch remarked in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nan |last=Robertson |title=The All-American Guy Behind ''Blue Velvet'' |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 11, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third idea was [[Bobby Vinton]]'s classic rendition of the song ''Blue Velvet'' and &quot;the mood that came with that song a mood, a time, and things that were of that time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Borden |last=Lizzie |title=The World According to Lynch |publisher=[[Village Voice]] |date=September 23, 1986 |accessdate=2007-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch and Roth pitched the script to [[Warner Bros.]], who showed interest in the project. Lynch eventually spent two years writing two drafts, which, he stated, were not very good. The problem with them, Lynch has said, was that &quot;there was maybe all the unpleasantness in the film but nothing else. A lot was not there. And so it went away for a while.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rodley&quot;/&gt;

After completing ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980), Lynch met producer [[Richard Roth]] over coffee. Roth had read and enjoyed Lynch's ''[[Ronnie Rocket]]'' script, but did not think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. &quot;I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cineaste&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peary&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Cult Movies 3 | first = Danny | last = Peary | year = 1988 | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. | location = New York | pages = 38–42 | isbn = 0-671-64810-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production was announced in August 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt; Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;/&gt; Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had cut a deal with [[Dino De Laurentiis]] that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;/&gt; This deal meant that ''Blue Velvet'' was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;/&gt; Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;/&gt; &quot;After ''Dune'' I was down so far that anything was up!

The cast of ''Blue Velvet'' included several then-relatively unknown actors. [[Isabella Rossellini]] had gained some exposure before the film for her [[Lancôme]] ads in the early 1980s. [[Dennis Hopper]] was the biggest &quot;name&quot; in the film, having starred in ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), while [[Kyle MacLachlan]] had played the central role in Lynch's ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'' (1984), a [[science fiction]] epic based on [[Dune (novel)|the novel]] of the same name, the film having been a critical and commercial failure. Dennis Hopper—said to be Lynch's third choice—accepted the role, reportedly having exclaimed, &quot;I've got to play Frank! I am Frank!&quot; as Hopper confirmed in the ''Blue Velvet'' &quot;making-of&quot; documentary ''The Mysteries of Love'', produced for the 2002 special edition.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;/&gt; For the role of Dorothy Vallens, Lynch met Isabella Rossellini at a restaurant, and she accepted the role.
[[Image:Lumbertonbv.jpg|thumb|left|230px|''Blue Velvet'''s setting of Lumberton is based in part on Lynch's own childhood hometown of [[Spokane, Washington]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;/&gt;]]

The scene in which Dorothy appears naked outside was inspired by a real-life experience Lynch had during childhood when he and his brother saw a naked woman walking down a neighborhood street at night. The experience was so traumatic to the young Lynch that it made him cry, and he had never forgotten it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Ebert | first=Roger | title=Biting into ''Blue Velvet'' | publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=1986-10-02 | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19861002/PEOPLE/41216001/1023 | accessdate=2007-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Principal photography]] of ''Blue Velvet'' began in February 1986 and completed in April. The film was shot at [[EUE/Screen Gems]] studio in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], which also provided the exterior scenes of Lumberton. The scene with a raped and battered Dorothy proved to be particularly challenging. Several townspeople arrived to watch the filming with picnic baskets and rugs, against the wishes of Rossellini and Lynch. However, they continued filming as normal, and when Lynch yelled cut, the townspeople had left. As a result, police told Lynch they were no longer permitted to shoot in any public areas of Wilmington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Some of Me | first=Isabella | last=Rossellini | year=1997 | publisher=Random House | location=New York | isbn=0-679-452524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch's original rough cut ran for approximately four hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blue Velvet&quot; /&gt; He was contractually obligated to deliver a two-hour movie by De Laurentiis and cut many small subplots and character scenes.&lt;ref&gt;''Blue Velvet''; a two-part search for the films deleted scenes at [http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s87velvet1.htmlHe DVD Talk]; Retrieved July 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He also made cuts at the request of the [[MPAA]]. For example, when Frank slaps Dorothy after the first rape scene, the audience was supposed to see Frank actually hitting her. Instead, the film cuts away to Jeffrey in the closet, wincing at what he has just seen. This cut was made to satisfy the MPAA's concerns about violence. Lynch thought that the change only made the scene more disturbing. Long thought lost, Lynch announced in a radio interview on January 18, 2011 that footage from the [[deleted scene]]s has been discovered and should appear on the upcoming Blu-ray disc release of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=BLUE VELVET Blu-Ray To Include Newly Redisocvered Deleted Footage | url=http://www.filmbuffonline.com/FBOLNewsreel/wordpress/2011/01/24/blue-velvet-blu-ray-to-include-deleted-scenes/ | accessdate=2011-01-24 | publisher=http://www.filmbuffonline.com Film Buff Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final cut produced by Lynch runs for just under two hours.

==Interpretation==
[[Image:Blue Velvet scene.jpg|thumb|right|330px|A strong recurring theme in ''Blue Velvet'' is [[voyeurism]]. In this scene, Jeffrey unwittingly takes the role of the &quot;voyeur&quot;, while he hides in Dorothy's closet watching her get undressed, unbeknownst to her.]]
Despite ''Blue Velvet''{{'}}s initial appearance as a mystery, the film operates on a number of thematic levels. The film owes a large debt to 1950s [[film noir]], containing and exploring such conventions as the [[femme fatale]] (Dorothy Vallens), a seemingly unstoppable villain (Frank Booth), and the questionable moral outlook of the hero (Jeffrey Beaumont), as well as its unusual use of shadowy, sometimes dark cinematography.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rubin&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Thrillers | first=Martin | last=Rubin | year=1999 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | location=Britain | pages=175 | isbn=0-521-58839-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blue Velvet'' represents and establishes Lynch's famous &quot;askew vision,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Johnson | first=J | year=2004 | title=Pervert in the Pulpit: Morality in the Works of David Lynch | pages =38–39 | isbn=0-786-41753-6 | publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduces several common elements of Lynch's work, some of which would later become his trademarks, including distorted characters, a polarized world, and debilitating damage to the skull or brain. Perhaps the most significant &quot;Lynchian&quot; trademark in the film is the depiction of unearthing a dark underbelly in a seemingly idealized small town;&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Heanni&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=White | first=John | year=2009 | title=Fifty Key American Films | pages=270 | isbn=0-415-77297-4 | publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey even proclaims in the film that he is &quot;seeing something that was always hidden,&quot; thus alluding to the film's plot central idea. Lynch's characterization of films, symbols, and motifs have become well-known, and his particular style, characterised largely in ''Blue Velvet'' for the first time, has been written about extensively using descriptions like &quot;ultraweird,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;zacharek&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Stephanie | first=Zacharek | title=David Lynch's latest tour de force | publisher=Salon.com | date=2001-10-12 | url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2001/10/12/mulholland_drive/index.html?source=search&amp;aim=/ent/movies/review | accessdate=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;dark,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nochimson&quot;&gt;Nochimson, Martha (Autumn 2002). &quot;''Mulholland Drive'' by David Lynch&quot;, ''Film Quarterly'', 56 (1), p. 37–45&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;oddball.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;&gt;Johnson, 2005, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Red curtains also show up in key scenes, specifically in Dorothy's apartment, which have since become a Lynch trademark. The film has been compared to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960) because of its stark treatment of psychotic evil.&lt;ref name=&quot;''Taschen Books''&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Jürgen | last=Müller | title=The 25 Greatest Films of the 1980s | publisher=Taschen Books | year=2002 | pages=325 | ISBN 3-8228-4783-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise of both films is curiosity, leading to an investigation that draws the lead characters into a hidden, voyeuristic underworld of crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;orr&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Orr | first=J | year=2005 | title=Hitchcock and Twentieth-century Cinema | publisher=Wallflower Press | pages=167 | isbn=190476455X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's thematic framework hearkens back to Poe, James, and early [[gothic fiction]], as well as films such as ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943) and ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955) and the entire notion of film noir.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denzin&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The cinematic society: The Voyeur's Gaze | first=Norman K. | last=Denzin | year=1995 | publisher=Sage Publications | location=Britain | pages=247 | isbn=0-521-58839-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch has called it a &quot;film about things that are hidden — within a small city and within people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalsocietyoffilmcritics&quot; /&gt; Like many other Lynch films, ''Blue Velvet'' is immersed in [[pop culture]] imagery, both from the 1950s and the 1960s, as well as the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_148/20yearslaterblue.html | title=20 years later, ''Blue Velvet'' is surreal as ever | publisher=''Downtown Express''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist]] psychoanalytic film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]] argues that ''Blue Velvet'' establishes a metaphorical [[Oedipal]] family — &quot;the child&quot;, Jeffrey Beaumont, and his &quot;parents&quot;, Frank Booth and Dorothy Vallens — through deliberate references to film noir and its underlying Oedipal theme.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulvey&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Cult etherworlds and the Unconscious: Oedipus and ''Blue Velvet''&quot;, Fetishism And Curiosity 3 | first = Laura | last = Mulvey | year = 1996 | publisher = British Film Institute | location = Suffolk | pages = 137–154 | isbn = 0-671-64810-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor, Winquist&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of Postmodernism | first = Victor E. | last = Taylor | year = 2001 | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | pages = 466 | isbn = 0415152941}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting violence, she claims, can be read as symbolic of domestic violence within real families. For instance, Frank's violent acts can be seen to reflect the different types of abuse within families, and the control he has over Dorothy might represent the hold an abusive husband has over his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Blue Velvet |last=Atkinson |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Atkinson |coauthors= |year=1997 |publisher=British Film Institute |location=London |isbn=978-0-8517-0559-0 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Atkinson reads Jeffrey as an innocent youth who is both horrified by the violence inflicted by Frank, but also tempted by it as the means of possessing Dorothy for himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = BFI Modern Classics: 'Now It's Dark': The Child's Dream in David Lynch's ''Blue Velvet''&quot;, The Fatal Woman: Sources Of Male Anxiety In American Film Noir&quot;| first = Michael | last = Atkinson| year = 1997 | publisher = British Film Institute | location = Madison | pages = 144–155| isbn = 0-671-64810-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = American Cinema of the 1980s| first = Stephan | last = Prince| year = 2007 | publisher = Rutgers University Press | location = New Brunswick | pages = 160–167| isbn = 0-8135-4034-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Atkinson takes a [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] approach to the film; considering it to be an expression of the traumatised innocence which characterises Lynch's work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt;  He claims that &quot;Dorothy represents the sexual force of the mother [figure] because she is forbidden and because she becomes the object of the unhealthy, infantile impulses at work in Jeffrey's subconscious&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt;

===Symbolism===
Symbolism is used very heavily in ''Blue Velvet''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt; The most consistent symbolism in the film is an [[insect]] motif introduced at the end of the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths, underground, a swarming nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban, [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]esque paradise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt; The severed ear that Jeffrey finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the horrific bug-like [[nitrous oxide]] mask that Frank wears, but also in the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims he is an insect exterminator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt; One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a [[Yellowjacket|type of wasp]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt; Finally, a [[American Robin|robin]] eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt; The Robin, (as mentioned earlier by Sandy recounting her dream) represents love conquering evil.

The severed ear that Jeffrey discovers is also a key symbolic element;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt; the ear is what leads Jeffrey into danger. Indeed, just as Jeffrey's troubles begin, the audience is treated to a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the ear canal of the severed, decomposing ear.  Notably, the camera does not reemerge from the ear canal until the end of the film. When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, the ear canal shot is replayed, only in reverse, zooming out through Jeffrey's own ear as he relaxes in his yard on a summer day. This use of a 'portal' is also quite a common symbolic theme in Lynch's work.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Soundtrack==
{{main|Blue Velvet (soundtrack)}}
The ''Blue Velvet'' soundtrack was supervised by [[Angelo Badalamenti]]. Badalamenti makes a brief cameo appearance as the [[pianist]] at the Slow Club where Dorothy performs. The soundtrack makes heavy usage of vintage pop songs, such as [[Bobby Vinton]]'s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; and [[Roy Orbison]]'s &quot;[[In Dreams (song)|In Dreams]]&quot;, juxtaposed with an orchestral score inspired by [[Shostakovich]]. During filming, Lynch placed speakers on set and in streets and played Shostakovich to set the correct mood he wanted to convey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blue Velvet&quot;&gt;''Mysteries of Love: The Making of Blue Velvet'', ''Blue Velvet'' Special Edition DVD documentary, [2002]&lt;/ref&gt; The score makes direct quotations from Shostakovich's ''15th Symphony'', which Lynch had been listening to regularly while writing the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;''Blue Velvet'' film score at [http://www.thecityofabsurdity.com/bluevelvet/bvsound.html The City of Absurity]; Retrieved June 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked ''Blue Velvet's'' soundtrack  on its list of the ''100 Greatest Film Soundtracks'', at the 100th position. Critic John Alexander wrote, &quot;the haunting soundtrack accompanies the title credits, then weaves through the narrative, accentuating the noir mood of the film.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;British Film Resource&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The Films of David Lynch: 50 Percent Sound | publisher = The British Film Resource | year = 1997 | url=http://www.britishfilm.org.uk/lynch/Schap3.html | accessdate = 2009-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch worked with music composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]] for the first time in this film and asked him to write a score that had to be &quot;like Shostakovich, be very Russian, but make it the most beautiful thing but make it dark and a little bit scary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chion |first=Michael |year=1995 | title = | journal=British Film Institute, London |pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badalamenti's success with ''Blue Velvet'' would lead him to contribute to all of Lynch's future full-length films until ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]''. Also included in the sound team was long time Lynch collaborator [[Alan Splet]], a [[sound editor]] and designer who had won an [[Academy Award]] for his work on ''[[The Black Stallion]]'' (1979), and been nominated for ''[[Never Cry Wolf]]'' (1983).&lt;ref name=&quot;oscars1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Alan Splet | publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | date=1979, 1983 | url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1210406541935 | accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The film received a positive reaction from critics in the United States, with one critic claiming ''Blue Velvet'' would &quot;cause a sensation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rottentomatoes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blue Velvet&quot;/&gt; The film was included in ''[[The New York Times]]'' &quot;10 Best Films of 1986&quot; upon its release. Paul Attanasio of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said &quot;the film showcases a visual stylist utterly in command of his talents&quot; and that Angelo Badalamenti &quot;contributes an extraordinary score, slipping seamlessly from slinky jazz to violin figures to the romantic sweep of a classic Hollywood score&quot;, but claimed that Lynch &quot;isn't interested in communicating, he's interested in parading his personality. The movie doesn't progress or deepen, it just gets weirder, and to no good end.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Attanasio | first = Paul | title = Blue Velvet | publisher = [[The Washington Post]] |date=1986-09-19 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/bluevelvetrattanasio_a0ad54.htm | accessdate = 2006-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' critic [[Janet Maslin]] expressed her admiration for the film, and directed much praise toward the performances of Hopper and Rossellini: &quot;Mr. Hopper and Miss Rossellini are so far outside the bounds of ordinary acting here that their performances are best understood in terms of sheer lack of inhibition; both give themselves entirely over to the material, which seems to be exactly what's called for.&quot; She called it &quot;an instant cult classic.&quot; Maslin concluded by saying that ''Blue Velvet'' &quot;is as fascinating as it is freakish. It confirms Mr. Lynch's stature as an innovator, a superb technician, and someone best not encountered in a dark alley.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Maslin | first = Janet | title = Blue Velvet, Comedy of the Eccentric | publisher = [[The New York Times]] |date=1986-09-19 | url = http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?_r=1&amp;res=9A0DE3D61E38F93AA2575AC0A960948260&amp;oref=slogin  | accessdate = 2006-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheila Benson]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film &quot;the most brilliantly disturbing film ever to have its roots in small-town American life.&quot; She called it &quot;shocking, visionary, rapturously controlled.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/blue-velvet|title=Blue Velvet (1986) Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=''CNET Networks''|accessdate=September 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking back in his ''Guardian/Observer'' review, critic Philip French wrote, &quot;The film is wearing well and has attained a classic status without becoming respectable or losing its sense of danger.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = French | first = Philip | title = Blue Velvet | publisher = [[Guardian Unlimited]] | date = 2001-12-16 | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,619471,00.html | accessdate = 2006-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]], film critic for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', named ''Blue Velvet'' the best film of the 1980s, and referred to the film as an &quot;American masterpiece.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rottentomatoes&quot; /&gt; Film critic [[Gene Siskel]] included ''Blue Velvet'' on his list of the best films of 1986, at #5. Nevertheless, ''Blue Velvet'' was not without its detractors. A general criticism from critics in the United States was the film's often vulgar approach to sexuality and violence that detracts from the film's serious side.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebert&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | title = Blue Velvet | publisher = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=1986-09-19 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19860919/REVIEWS/609190301/1023 | accessdate = 2006-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Blue Velvet'' review at the [http://www.themoviesnobs.com/blue-velvet/ Movie Snobs]; Retrieved September 30, 2007. {{Wayback|url=http://www.themoviesnobs.com/blue-velvet/|date =20071014155915|bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the film's detractors, [[Roger Ebert]], film critic of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', supported that view, although he praised Isabella Rossellini's performance as being &quot;convincing and courageous.&quot; Ebert criticized how she was depicted in the film, even accusing David Lynch of [[misogyny]]: &quot;degraded, slapped around, humiliated and undressed in front of the camera. And when you ask an actress to endure those experiences, you should keep your side of the bargain by putting her in an important film.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ebert&quot; /&gt; During an online Q&amp;A session with Ebert in 2007, he said he still had negativity regarding how Rossellini was depicted but said he should re-visit ''Blue Velvet'' and that David Lynch was a good director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper: Webchat with Roger Ebert | date = 2007-08-02 | accessdate = 2009-08-24 | url = http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/chat/transcript-ebert-070802.html }} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Twitter|Tweet]] honoring David Lynch's birthday, Ebert later revealed though he views Lynch as a great director, his feelings remain unchanged about ''Blue Velvet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Roger Ebert's Twitter Feed | date = 2009-01-20 | accessdate = 2010-01-20 | url = http://twitter.com/ebertchicago/status/8010331149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Although it initially gained a relatively small theatrical audience in North America and was met with controversy over its artistic merit, ''Blue Velvet'' soon became the center of a &quot;national firestorm&quot; in 1986, and over time achieved status as an American classic. In the late 1980s, and early 1990s, after its release on videotape, the film became a widely-known [[cult film]], well-known for its dark depiction of a suburban America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.reelviews.net/movies/b/blue_velvet.html | title = ''Blue Velvet'' | author = Berardinelli, James | authorlink = James Berardinelli | publisher = ''Reelviews'' | accessdate = {{start date|2010|8|28}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Followed by a myriad of [[VHS]], [[Laserdisc]] and [[DVD]] releases, the film became more and more well-known among American audiences. It marked the entrance of David Lynch into the Hollywood mainstream and the comeback of [[Dennis Hopper]] after a significant hiatus from work. Its success has helped propel Hollywood mainstream toward more graphic displays of previously censored themes, a similar case to ''Psycho'' (1960) to which ''Blue Velvet'' has been frequently compared.&lt;ref name=&quot;''Taschen Books''&quot; /&gt; It has become one of the most significant, well-recognized films of its era, spawning countless imitations and parodies in media. The film's dark, stylish and erotic production design has served as a benchmark for a number of films, parodies and even Lynch's own later work, notably ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' (1990–91), and ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001). [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine cited it as one of the most &quot;influential American films&quot;, as did [[Michael Atkinson]], who dedicated a book to the film's themes and motifs.&lt;ref name=&quot;rottentomatoes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt;

''Blue Velvet'' now frequently appears in various critical assessments of all-time great films, also ranked as one of the greatest films of the 1980s, one of the best examples of American surrealism and one of the finest examples of David Lynch's work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt;  In a poll of two American critics ranking the &quot;most outstanding films of the decade&quot;, ''Blue Velvet'' was placed third and fourth, behind ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980), ''[[E.T. The Extra Terrestrial]]'' (1982) and the German film ''[[Wings of Desire]]'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;In an American film poll of fifty-four critics, the top ten domestic movies of the 1980s were ''Raging Bull'', ''E.T.'', ''Blue Velvet'', ''Hannah and Her Sisters'', ''Atlantic City'', ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', ''Platoon'', ''Once Upon a Time in America'', ''Prizzi's Honour'', ''The King of Comedy'' and ''The Fly'', (Milligan and Rowland, pg 23-29)&lt;/ref&gt; An ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' book special released in 1999 ranked ''Blue Velvet'' at thirty-seventh greatest films of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= The 100 Greatest Films of All Time | publisher= [[Entertainment Weekly]] Magazine | url= http://www.filmsite.org/ew100.html| accessdate=2006-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was ranked by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in its list of the 100 Greatest Films.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmsite&quot;&gt;''Blue Velvet'' at [http://www.filmsite.org/movieline.html Filmsite.org]; Retrieved September 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Film Four]]'s'' ranked it on their list of 100 Greatest Films.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmsite&quot; /&gt; In a 2007 poll of the online film community held by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', ''Blue Velvet'' came in at the ninety-fifth greatest film of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thompson, Anne |url=http://weblogs.variety.com/thompsononhollywood/2007/07/top-100-film-li.html?query=%22pulp+fiction%22+1994+tarantino|title=Top 100 Film Lists: Online Cinephiles|publisher=Variety.com|date=2007-07-31|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Total Film]]'' ranked ''Blue Velvet'' as one of the all time best films in both a critics list and a public poll, in 2006 and 2007, respectively.  In December 2002, a UK film critics poll in ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' ranked the film #5 on their list of the 10 Best Films of the Last 25 Years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[Sight and Sound]] | title = Modern Times | date = December 2002 | url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/feature/63/ | accessdate=2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a special ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' issue, 100 new film classics were chosen from 1983 to 2008: ''Blue Velvet'' was ranked at #4.&lt;ref name=&quot;entertainmentweekly2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=entertainment weekly|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207076_20207387_20207063,00.html|title=The New 100 Classics|publisher=EntertainmentWeekly.com|date=2008-06-31|accessdate=2009-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ''Blue Velvet's'' various &quot;all time greatest films&quot; rankings, the [[American Film Institute]] has awarded the film three honors in its lists: #96 on ''[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills|100 Years... 100 Thrills]]'' in 2001, selecting cinema's most thrilling moments and ranked Frank Booth #36 of the 50 greatest villains in ''[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains]]'' in 2003. In June 2008, the AFI revealed its &quot;[[AFI's 10 Top 10|Ten top Ten]]&quot;—the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. ''Blue Velvet'' was acknowledged as the eighth best film in the mystery genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[American Film Institute]] | title = AFI's 10 Top 10 | date = 2008-06-17 | url = http://www.afi.com/10top10/mystery.html | accessdate=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' magazine listed Frank Booth, played by Dennis Hopper, as #54 on its list of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time, calling him &quot;the most monstrously funny creations in cinema history&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Premiere&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]] | date = | url = http://www.premiere.com/features/1539/the-100-greatest-movie-characters-of-all-time-page2.html | accessdate = 2008-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was ranked #84 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo Television]]'s four-hour program ''100 Scariest Movie Moments'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 100 Scariest Movie Moments: 100 Scariest Moments in Movie History when .|url=http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/ |publisher=[[Bravo (US TV channel)|BRAVOtv.com]] |accessdate=2007-06-17|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070608185759/http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/ |archivedate = June 8, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is frequently sampled musically and an array of bands and solo artists have taken their names and inspiration from the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[mathematics]], a '''binary operation''' is a calculation involving two [[operands]], in other words, an operation whose [[arity]] is two. Examples include the familiar [[arithmetic]] operations of [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]].

More precisely, a binary operation on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is a [[binary relation]] that maps elements of the [[Cartesian product]] ''S'' &amp;times; ''S'' to ''S'':
:&lt;math&gt;\,f \colon S \times S \rightarrow S.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''f'' is not a [[Function (mathematics)|function]], but is instead a [[partial function]], it is called a '''partial operation'''. For instance, division of [[real numbers]] is a partial function, because one can't [[divide by zero]]: ''a/0'' is not defined for any real ''a''. Note however that both in [[algebra]] and [[model theory]] the binary operations considered are defined on the whole of &lt;math&gt;S \times S &lt;/math&gt;.

Sometimes, especially in [[computer science]], the term is used for any [[binary function]]. That ''f'' takes values in the same set ''S'' that provides its arguments is the property of [[closure (mathematics)|closure]].

Binary operations are the keystone of algebraic structures studied in [[abstract algebra]]: they form part of [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[monoid]]s, [[semigroup]]s, [[ring (algebra)|ring]]s, and more.
Most generally, a ''[[magma (algebra)|magma]]'' is a set together with any binary operation defined on it.

Many binary operations of interest in both algebra and formal logic are [[commutative]] or [[associative]].
Many also have [[identity element]]s and [[inverse element]]s.
Typical examples of binary operations are the [[addition]] (+) and [[multiplication]] (&amp;times;) of [[number]]s and [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] as well as [[composition of functions]] on a single set.

An example of an operation that is not [[commutative]] is [[subtraction]] (−). Examples of partial operations that are not commutative include [[division (mathematics)|division]] (/), [[exponentiation]](^), and [[super-exponentiation]](↑↑).

Binary operations are often written using [[infix notation]] such as ''a'' ∗ ''b'', ''a'' + ''b'', ''a'' · ''b'' or (by [[wikt:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]] with no symbol) ''ab'' rather than by functional notation of the form ''f''(''a'', ''b''). Powers are usually also written without operator, but with the second argument as [[superscript]].

Binary operations sometimes use prefix or postfix notation; this dispenses with parentheses. Prefix notation is also called [[Polish notation]]; postfix notation, also called [[reverse Polish notation]], is probably more often encountered.

==Pair and tuple==
A binary operation, ''ab'', depends on the [[ordered pair]] (''a'', ''b'') and so (''ab'')''c'' (where the parentheses here mean first operate on the ordered pair (a, b) and then operate on the result of that using the ordered pair ((ab), c)) depends in general on the ordered pair ((''a'',''b''),''c''). Thus, for the general, non-associative case, binary operations can be represented with [[binary tree]]s.

However:
*If the operation is associative, (''ab'')''c''=''a''(''bc''), then the value depends only on the [[tuple]] (''a'',''b'',''c'').
*If the operation is commutative, ''ab''=''ba'', then the value depends only on the [[multiset]] { {''a'',''b''},''c''}.
*If the operation is both associative and commutative then the value depends only on the [[multiset]] {''a'',''b'',''c''}.
*If the operation is both associative and commutative and [[idempotent]], ''aa''=''a'', then the value depends only on the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {''a'',''b'',''c''}.

== External binary operations ==
An '''[[external (mathematics)|external]] binary operation''' is a binary function from ''K'' &amp;times; ''S'' to ''S''.
This differs from a binary operation in the strict sense in that ''K'' need not be ''S''; its elements come from ''outside''.

An example of an [[external (mathematics)|external]] binary operation is [[scalar multiplication]] in [[linear algebra]].
Here ''K'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] and ''S'' is a [[vector space]] over that field.

An [[external (mathematics)|external]] binary operation may alternatively be viewed as an [[group action|action]]; ''K'' is acting on ''S''.

Note that the [[dot product]] of two vectors is not a binary operation, external or otherwise, as it maps from ''S'' &amp;times; ''S'' to ''K'', where ''K'' is a field and ''S'' is a vector space over ''K''.

[[File:Hendrik ter Brugghen - De doedelzakspeler.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Bagpiper'', by [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]] (17th Century, Netherlands).]]

'''Bagpipes''' are a class of [[musical instrument]], [[aerophone]]s, using enclosed [[reed (music)|reeds]] fed from a constant reservoir of air in the form of a bag. Though the Scottish [[Great Highland Bagpipe]] and Irish [[uilleann pipes]] have the greatest international visibility, bagpipes of many different types come from different regions throughout Europe, Northern Africa, the Persian Gulf, and the Caucasus.

The term is equally correct in the singular or plural, although in the English language, pipers most commonly talk of &quot;pipes.&quot;

==Overview==
{|align=right
|{{Listen|filename=Skye Boat Song.ogg|title=Skye Boat Song|description=An adaptation of the [[Skye Boat Song]] for Great Highland bagpipes played by the Clan Stewart Pipe Band.}}
|}

A set of bagpipes minimally consists of an air supply, a bag, a [[chanter]], and usually a [[Drone (music)|drone]]. Most bagpipes also have additional drones (and sometimes chanters) in various combinations, held in place in stocks—connectors that fasten the various pipes to the bag.

===Air supply===
The most common method of supplying air to the bag is by blowing into a [[blowpipe]], or blowstick. In some pipes the player must cover the tip of the blowpipe with his tongue while inhaling, but modern blowpipes have a [[non-return valve]] that eliminates this need.

An innovation, dating from the 16th or 17th centuries, is the use of a [[bellows]] to supply air. In these pipes, sometimes called ''[[cauld wind pipes]]'', air is not heated or moistened by the player's breathing, so bellows-driven bagpipes can use more refined and/or delicate reeds. The most famous of these pipes are the Irish [[uilleann pipes]], the [[Northumbrian smallpipes]] in Britain, and the [[Musette de cour]] in France.

===Bag===
The bag is an airtight [[reservoir]] that can hold air and regulate its flow while the player keeps the bag inflated by blowing into it or pumping with a bellows, enabling the player to maintain continuous sound for some time. Materials used for bags vary widely, but the most common are the skins of local animals such as goats, dogs, sheep, and cows. More recently, bags made of synthetic materials including [[Gore-Tex]] have become common.

Bags cut from larger materials are usually [[saddle stitch|saddle-stitched]] with an extra strip folded over the seam and stitched (for skin bags) or glued (for synthetic bags) to reduce leaks. Holes are cut to accommodate the stocks. In the case of bags made from largely intact animal skins the stocks are typically tied into the points where limbs and the head joined the body of the living animal, a construction technique common in Central and Eastern Europe.

===Chanter===
{{Main|Chanter}}
The chanter is the [[melody]] pipe, played by two hands. A chanter can be bored internally so that the inside walls are parallel for its full length, or it can be bored in the shape of a cone. Additionally, the [[Reed (instrument)|reed]] can be a [[Single-reed instrument|single]] or a [[double reed]]. Double reeds are used with both conical- and parallel-bored chanters while single reeds are generally (although not exclusively) limited to parallel-bored chanters. In general double-reed chanters are found in pipes of Western Europe with single-reed chanters found elsewhere. [[File:Thechanter.jpg‎|thumb|right|The practice chanter]]

The chanter is usually open-ended; thus, there is no easy way for the player to stop the pipe from sounding. This means that most bagpipes share a [[legato]] sound where there are no rests in the music. Primarily because of this inability to stop playing, [[grace note]]s (which vary between types of bagpipe) are used to break up notes and to create the illusion of articulation and accents. Because of their importance, these embellishments (or ''ornaments'') are often highly technical systems specific to each bagpipe, and take much study to master.

A few bagpipes (the ''[[musette de cour]]'', the [[uilleann pipes]], the [[Northumbrian smallpipe]], and the left chanter of the surdulina, a type of [[Calabrian]] [[zampogna]]) have closed ends or stop the end on the player's leg, so that when the player covers all the holes (known as closing the chanter) it becomes silent.

===Drone===
Most bagpipes have at least one drone. A drone is most commonly a cylindrical tube with a single reed, although drones with double reeds exist. The drone is generally designed in two or more parts, with a sliding joint (&quot;'bridle'&quot;) so that the pitch of the drone can be manipulated.

Depending on the type of pipes, the drones may lay over the shoulder, across the arm opposite the bag, or may run parallel to the chanter. Some drones have a tuning screw, which effectively alters the length of the drone by opening a hole, allowing the drone to be tuned to two or more distinct pitches. The tuning screw may also shut off the drone altogether. In most type of pipes, where there is one drone it is pitched two octaves below the tonic of the chanter, and further additions often add the octave below and then a drone consonant with the fifth of the chanter.

==History==
===Possible ancient origins===
Evidence of pre-medieval bagpipes is uncertain, but several textual and visual clues may possibly indicate ancient forms of bagpipes. The &quot;Oxford History of Music&quot; makes mention of the first documented bagpipe being found on a Hittite slab at Eyuk in the Middle East. This sculptured bagpipe has been dated to 1000 BC. In the 2nd century AD, [[Suetonius]] described the Roman Emperor [[Nero]] as a player of the tibia utricularis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#54 (''Life of Nero'', 54)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dio Chrysostom]], who also flourished in the 1st century, wrote about a contemporary sovereign (possibly Nero) who could play a pipe (&quot;aulein&quot;) with his mouth as well as with his &quot;armpit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/71*.html#9 (Or.&amp;nbsp;71.9)]&lt;/ref&gt; From this account, some believe that the ''tibia utricularis'' was a bagpipe.

===Spread and development in Europe===
[[File:Cantiga bagpipes 1.jpg|thumb|right|A detail from the [[Galician language|Galician]] [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]] showing bagpipes with one chanter and a parallel drone (13th Century).]]

In the early part of the second millennium, bagpipes began to appear with frequency in European art and iconography. The [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]], compiled in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] in the mid-13th century, depict several types of bagpipes.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Aubrey [http://books.google.com/books?id=1nqgFob3uV0C&amp;pg=PA261&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;dq=cantigas+bagpipes&amp;source=web&amp;ots=q1GNc31gal&amp;sig=VjVX8WSGbSiV0712SQctsaLB53I&amp;hl=en The Music of the Troubadours] 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Though evidence of bagpipes in the British Isles prior to the 14th century is contested, bagpipes are explicitly mentioned in [[The Canterbury Tales]] (written around 1380): ''A baggepype wel coude he blowe and sowne, /And ther-with-al he broghte us out of towne.''&lt;ref&gt;Chaucer. The Canterbury Tales. [http://www.bartleby.com/40/0103.html Prologue to &quot;The Miller's Tale&quot;], line 565.&lt;/ref&gt;

Actual examples of bagpipes from before the 18th century are extremely rare; however, a substantial number of paintings, carvings, engravings, manuscript illuminations, and so on survive. They make it clear that bagpipes varied hugely throughout Europe, and even within individual regions. Many examples of early folk bagpipes in Continental Europe can be found in the paintings of Brueghel, Teniers, Jordaens and Durer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northport-bagpipes.org/bagpipes.htm] The Great Highland Bagpipes&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 068.jpg|thumb|left|A detail from a painting by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] showing two bagpipers (15th Century).]]

Evidence of the bagpipe in Ireland occurs in 1581, when John Derrick's &quot;[[The Image of Irelande]]&quot; clearly depicts a bagpiper. Derrick's illustrations are considered to be reasonably faithful depictions of the attire and equipment of the English and Irish population of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;John Derrick [http://www.lib.ed.ac.uk/about/bgallery/Gallery/researchcoll/ireland.html The Image of Irelande] London, 1581.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Battle'' sequence from [[My Ladye Nevells Booke]] (1591) by [[William Byrd]], which probably alludes to the Irish wars of 1578, contains a piece entitled ''The bagpipe: &amp; the drone''. In 1760, the first serious study of the Scottish Highland bagpipe and its music was attempted, in Joseph MacDonald's 'Compleat Theory'. Further south, a manuscript from the 1730s by a [[William Dixon manuscript|William Dixon]] from [[Northumberland]] contains music that fits the [[Border pipes]], a nine-note bellows-blown bagpipe whose chanter is similar to that of the modern [[Great Highland Bagpipe]]. However the music in Dixon's manuscript varied greatly from modern Highland bagpipe tunes, consisting mostly of extended variation sets of common dance tunes. Some of the tunes in the Dixon manuscript correspond to tunes found in early 19th century published and manuscript sources of [[Northumbrian smallpipe]] tunes, notably the rare book of 50 tunes, many with variations, by John Peacock.
[[File:The Image of Irelande - plate02.jpg|right|250px|thumb|''Image of Irelande'' (1581)]]

As Western classical music developed, both in terms of musical sophistication and instrumental technology, bagpipes in many regions fell out of favour due to their limited range and function. This triggered a long, slow decline that continued, in most cases, into the 20th century.

Extensive and documented collections of traditional bagpipes can be found in the Musical Instrument section of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, and at the [[International Bagpipe Museum]] in [[Gijón]], Spain, and [[Pitt Rivers Museum]] in England.

===Recent history===
[[File:Afghanistan bagpiper.jpg|thumb|Bagpipes are frequently used during funerals and memorials, especially among the military and police forces.]]
During the expansion of the British Empire, spearheaded by British military forces that included [[Scottish regiment#Highland Regiments|Highland regiments]], the Scottish Great Highland Bagpipe became well-known worldwide. This surge in popularity was boosted by large numbers of pipers trained for military service in the two World Wars. The surge coincided with a decline in the popularity of many traditional forms of bagpipe throughout Europe, which began to be displaced by instruments from the classical tradition and later by gramophone and radio.

In the United Kingdom and Commonwealth Nations such as Canada and New Zealand, the bagpipe is commonly used in the military and is often played in formal ceremonies. Foreign militaries patterned after the British Army have also taken the Highland bagpipe into use, including Uganda, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Oman. Many police and fire forces in Scotland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and the United States have also adopted the tradition of pipe bands.

In recent years, often driven by revivals of native folk music and dance, many types of bagpipes have resurged in popularity, and in many cases instruments that were on the brink of extinction have become extremely popular. In [[Brittany]], the Great Highland Bagpipe and concept of the [[pipe band]] were appropriated to create a Breton interpretation, the [[bagad]]. The pipe band idiom has also been adopted and applied to the [[Spanish bagpipes|Spanish]] [[gaita]] as well. Additionally, bagpipes have often been used in various films depicting moments from Scottish and Irish history; the film [[Braveheart]] and the theatrical show [[Riverdance]] have served to make the [[uilleann pipes]] more commonly known.

In the late 20th century, various models of [[electronic bagpipes]] were invented. The first custom-built [[MIDI]] bagpipes were developed by the Asturian piper known as [[Hevia]] (José Ángel Hevia Velasco).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9911/05/wb.galicia/ CNN - WorldBeat Spotlight - Bagpipes resonate through rugged coastline of... Spain - November 5, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
===Types of bagpipes===
{{Main|List of bagpipes}}

Dozens of types of bagpipes today are widely spread across Europe and the Middle East, as well as through much of the former [[British Empire]]. The name bagpipe has almost become synonymous with its best-known form, the [[Great Highland Bagpipe]], overshadowing the great number and variety of traditional forms of bagpipe. Despite the decline of these other types of pipes over the last few centuries, in recent years many of these pipes have seen a resurgence or even revival as traditional musicians have sought them out; for example, the [[Uilleann pipes|Irish piping tradition]], which by the mid 20th century had declined to a handful of master players is today alive, well, and flourishing a situation similar to that of the [[gaita asturiana|Asturian gaita]], the [[Galician gaita]], the Aragonese [[gaita de boto]], [[Northumbrian smallpipe]]s, the [[Breton people|Breton]] [[biniou]], the [[Balkan]] [[gaida]], the Black Sea [[Tulum (bagpipe)|tulum]], the [[Scottish smallpipes]] and [[pastoral pipes]], as well as other varieties.

Traditionally, one of the main purposes of the bagpipe in most traditions was to provide music for dancing. In most countries this has declined with the growth of dance bands, recordings, and the decline of traditional dance. In turn, this has led to many types of pipes developing a performance-led tradition, and indeed much modern music based on the dance music tradition played on bagpipes is no longer suitable for use as dance music.

'''Biochemistry''', sometimes called '''biological chemistry''', is the study of [[chemistry|chemical]] processes in living [[organism]]s, including, but not limited to, living matter. Biochemistry governs all living organisms and living processes. By controlling information flow through biochemical signalling and the flow of chemical energy through [[metabolism]], biochemical processes give rise to the incredible complexity of life. Much of biochemistry deals with the structures and functions of cellular components such as [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[nucleic acid]]s and other [[biomolecule]]s although increasingly processes rather than individual molecules are the main focus. Over the last 40 years biochemistry has become so successful at explaining living processes that now almost all areas of the [[life sciences]] from [[botany]] to [[medicine]] are engaged in biochemical research. Today the main focus of pure biochemistry is in understanding how biological molecules give rise to the processes that occur within living [[Cell (biology)|cells]] which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of whole organisms.

Among the vast number of different biomolecules, many are complex and large molecules (called ''[[biopolymer]]s''), which are composed of similar repeating subunits (called ''[[monomer]]s''). Each class of polymeric biomolecule has a different set of subunit types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Campbell | first = Neil A. | authorlink = | coauthors = Brad Williamson; Robin J. Heyden | title = Biology: Exploring Life | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | date = 2006 | location = Boston, Massachusetts | pages = | url = http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-250882-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a [[protein]] is a polymer whose subunits are selected from a set of 20 or more [[amino acid]]s.  Biochemistry studies the chemical properties of important biological molecules, like proteins, and in particular the chemistry of [[enzyme]]-[[catalysis|catalyzed]] [[chemical reaction|reaction]]s.

The biochemistry of [[cell (biology)|cell]] [[metabolism]] and the [[endocrine system]] has been extensively described. Other areas of biochemistry include the [[genetic code]] ([[DNA]], [[RNA]]), [[protein synthesis]], [[cell membrane]] [[Membrane transport|transport]], and [[signal transduction]].

== History==
{{Main| History of biochemistry}}
It once was generally believed that life and its materials had some essential property or substance distinct from any found in non-living matter, and it was thought that only living beings could produce the molecules of life. Then, in 1828, [[Friedrich Wöhler]] published a paper on the synthesis of [[urea]], proving that [[organic chemistry|organic]] compounds can be created artificially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wöhler, F. | title = Ueber künstliche Bildung des Harnstoffs | journal = Ann. Phys. Chem. | year=1828 | volume=12 | pages=253–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =  Friedrich Wöhler (1800–1882), on the Bicentennial of His Birth | author = Kauffman, G. B. and Chooljian, S.H. | journal = The Chemical Educator | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–133 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1007/s00897010444a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dawn of biochemistry may have been the discovery of the first enzyme, [[diastase]] (today called [[amylase]]), in 1833 by [[Anselme Payen]]. [[Eduard Buchner]] contributed the first demonstration of a complex biochemical process outside of a cell in 1896: [[Ethanol fermentation|alcoholic fermentation]] in cell extracts of yeast. Although the term “biochemistry” seems to have been first used in 1882, it is generally accepted that the formal coinage of biochemistry occurred in 1903 by [[Carl Neuberg]], a  German [[chemist]]. Previously, this area would have been referred to as [[physiological chemistry]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. Since then, biochemistry has advanced, especially since the mid-20th century, with the development of new techniques such as [[chromatography]], [[X-ray diffraction]], [[dual polarisation interferometry]], [[protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]], [[radioisotopic labeling]], [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]] and [[molecular dynamics]] simulations. These techniques allowed for the discovery and detailed analysis of many molecules and [[metabolic pathway]]s of the [[cell (biology)|cell]], such as [[glycolysis]] and the [[Krebs cycle]] (citric acid cycle).

Another significant historic event in biochemistry is the discovery of the [[gene]] and its role in the transfer of information in the cell. This part of biochemistry is often called [[molecular biology]]. In the 1950s, [[James D. Watson]], [[Francis Crick]], [[Rosalind Franklin]], and [[Maurice Wilkins]] were instrumental in solving DNA structure and suggesting its relationship with genetic transfer of information. In 1958, [[George Beadle]] and [[Edward Tatum]] received the [[Nobel Prize]] for work in fungi showing that one gene produces one enzyme. In 1988, [[Colin Pitchfork]] was the first person convicted of murder with [[DNA]] evidence, which led to growth of [[forensic science]]. More recently, [[Andrew Z. Fire]] and [[Craig C. Mello]] received the 2006 Nobel Prize for discovering the role of [[RNA interference]] ([[RNAi]]), in the silencing of gene expression.

Today, there are three main types of biochemistry. Plant biochemistry involves the study of the biochemistry of [[autotrophic]] organisms such as [[photosynthesis]] and other plant specific [[biochemical]] processes. General biochemistry encompasses both plant and animal biochemistry. Human/medical/medicinal biochemistry focuses on the biochemistry of humans and medical illnesses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Biomolecules==

The four main classes of molecules in biochemistry are [[carbohydrates]], [[lipids]], [[proteins]], and [[nucleic acids]]. Many [[Biomolecule|biological molecules]] are polymers: in this terminology, '''''monomers''''' are relatively small micromolecules that are linked together to create large [[macromolecule]]s, which are known as '''''polymers'''''. When monomers are linked together to synthesize a [[Biopolymer|biological polymer]], they undergo a process called [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration synthesis]].

===Carbohydrates===
{{Main|Carbohydrates|Monosaccharides|Disaccharides|Polysaccharides}}

[[Image:Sucrose-inkscape.svg|thumbnail|125px|A molecule of [[sucrose]] (glucose + fructose), a [[disaccharide]].]]
Carbohydrates are made from monomers called ''[[monosaccharides]]''.  Some of these monosaccharides include [[glucose]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), [[fructose]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[deoxyribose]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  When two monosaccharides undergo dehydration synthesis, water is produced, as two [[hydrogen]] atoms and one [[oxygen]] atom are lost from the two monosaccharides' [[hydroxyl group]].

===Lipids===
{{Main|Lipids|Glycerol|Fatty acids}}

[[Image:Fat triglyceride shorthand formula.PNG|thumbnail|left|150px|A triglyceride with a glycerol molecule on the left and three fatty acids coming off it.]]
'''[[Lipids]]''' are usually made from one molecule of [[glycerol]] combined with other molecules.  In [[triglycerides]], the main group of bulk lipids, there is one molecule of glycerol and three [[fatty acids]].  Fatty acids are considered the monomer in that case, and may be [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] (no [[double bond]]s in the carbon chain) or unsaturated (one or more double bonds in the carbon chain).

Lipids, especially [[phospholipids]], are also used in various pharmaceutical products, either as co-solubilisers (e.g. in [[parenteral]] infusions) or else as drug carrier components (e.g. in a [[liposome]] or [[transfersome]]).

===Proteins===
{{Main|Proteins|Amino Acids}}

[[Image:AminoAcidball.svg|thumbnail|100px|The general structure of an α-amino acid, with the [[amine|amino]] group on the left and the [[carboxyl]] group on the right.]]
[[Proteins]] are very large molecules – macro-biopolymers – made from monomers called ''amino acids''.  There are 20 [[proteinogenic amino acid|standard amino acids]], each containing a [[carboxyl group]], an [[amino group]], and a [[Substituent|side chain]] (known as an &quot;R&quot; group).  The &quot;R&quot; group is what makes each amino acid different, and the properties of the side chains greatly influence the overall [[Protein tertiary structure|three-dimensional conformation]] of a protein.  When amino acids combine, they form a special bond called a [[peptide bond]] through dehydration synthesis, and become a [[Peptide|'''''polypeptide''''']], or protein.

To determine if two proteins are related or in other words to decide whether they are homologous or not, scientists use sequence-comparison methods. Methods like Sequence Alignments and Structural Alignments are powerful tools that help scientist identify homologies between related molecules.
The relevance of finding homologies among proteins goes beyond forming an evolutionary pattern of protein families. By finding how similar two protein sequences are, we acquire knowledge about their structure and therefore their function.

===Nucleic acids===
{{Main|Nucleic acid|DNA|RNA|Nucleotides}}

[[Image:DNA chemical structure.svg|thumbnail|200px|left|The structure of [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA), the picture shows the monomers being put together.]]
[[Nucleic acids]] are the molecules that make up [[DNA]], an extremely important substance which all cellular organisms use to store their genetic information. The most common nucleic acids are [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] and [[ribonucleic acid]].  Their monomers are called [[nucleotides]].  The most common nucleotides are [[Adenine]], [[Cytosine]], [[Guanine]], [[Thymine]], and [[Uracil]].  Adenine binds with thymine and uracil; Thymine only binds with Adenine; and Cytosine and Guanine can only bind with each other.

==Carbohydrates==
{{Main|Carbohydrate}}
The function of [[carbohydrates]] includes energy storage and providing structure. [[Sugar]]s are carbohydrates, but not all carbohydrates are sugars. There are more carbohydrates on Earth than any other known type of biomolecule; they are used to store energy and genetic information, as well as play important roles in cell to cell interactions and communications.

===Monosaccharides===
[[Image:Beta-D-Glucose.svg|thumb|[[Glucose]]]]
The simplest type of carbohydrate is a [[monosaccharide]], which among other properties contains carbon, [[hydrogen]], and [[oxygen]], mostly in a ratio of 1:2:1 (generalized formula C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''n'' is at least 3). [[Glucose]], one of the most important carbohydrates, is an example of a monosaccharide. So is [[fructose]], the sugar commonly associated with the sweet taste of [[fruit]]s.&lt;ref name=Whiting1970&gt;{{Cite book |date=1970 |author=Whiting, G.C |chapter=Sugars |editor=A.C. Hulme |title=The Biochemistry of Fruits and their Products |pages=1=31 |volume=Volume 1|place=London &amp; New York |publisher=Academic Press |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|a|a|none}}  Some carbohydrates (especially after [[condensation reaction|condensation]] to oligo- and polysaccharides) contain less carbon relative to H and O, which still are present in 2:1 (H:O) ratio. Monosaccharides can be grouped into [[aldoses]] (having an [[aldehyde]] group at the end of the chain, e. g. glucose) and [[ketoses]] (having a [[ketone|keto]] group in their chain; e. g. fructose). Both aldoses and ketoses occur in an [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] (starting with chain lengths of C4) cyclic forms. These are generated by bond formation between one of the hydroxyl groups of the sugar chain with the carbon of the aldehyde or keto group to form a [[hemiacetal]] bond. This leads to saturated five-membered (in furanoses) or six-membered (in pyranoses) [[heterocyclic]] rings containing one O as heteroatom.

===Disaccharides===
[[Image:Saccharose.svg|thumb|[[Sucrose]]: ordinary table sugar and probably the most familiar carbohydrate.]]
Two monosaccharides can be joined together using [[dehydration synthesis]], in which a hydrogen atom is removed from the end of one molecule and a [[hydroxyl]] group (&amp;mdash;OH) is removed from the other; the remaining residues are then attached at the sites from which the atoms were removed. The H&amp;mdash;OH or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is then released as a molecule of [[water]], hence the term ''dehydration''. The new molecule, consisting of two monosaccharides, is called a ''[[disaccharide]]'' and is conjoined together by a glycosidic or [[ether bond]]. The reverse reaction can also occur, using a molecule of water to split up a disaccharide and break the glycosidic bond; this is termed ''[[hydrolysis]]''. The most well-known disaccharide is [[sucrose]], ordinary [[sugar]] (in scientific contexts, called ''table sugar'' or ''[[cane sugar]]'' to differentiate it from other sugars). Sucrose consists of a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule joined together. Another important disaccharide is [[lactose]], consisting of a glucose molecule and a [[galactose]] molecule. As most humans age, the production of [[lactase]], the enzyme that hydrolyzes lactose back into glucose and galactose, typically decreases. This results in [[lactase deficiency]], also called ''lactose intolerance''.

Sugar polymers are characterised by having reducing or non-reducing ends. A [[reducing end]] of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom which can be in equilibrium with the open-chain [[aldehyde]] or keto form. If the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom, the free hydroxy group of the [[pyranose]] or [[furanose]] form is exchanged with an OH-side chain of another sugar, yielding a full [[acetal]]. This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety, whereas the galactose moiety form a full acetal with the C4-OH group of glucose. [[Saccharose]] does not have a reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto carbon of fructose (C2).

===Oligosaccharides and polysaccharides===
[[Image:Cellulose-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|[[Cellulose]] as polymer of β-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose]]
When a few (around three to six) monosaccharides are joined together, it is called an ''[[oligosaccharide]]'' (''oligo-'' meaning &quot;few&quot;). These molecules tend to be used as markers and signals, as well as having some other uses. Many monosaccharides joined together make a [[polysaccharide]]. They can be joined together in one long linear chain, or they may be branched. Two of the most common polysaccharides are [[cellulose]] and [[glycogen]], both consisting of repeating [[glucose]] [[monomer]]s.

* ''Cellulose'' is made by [[plant]]s and is an important structural component of their [[cell wall]]s. [[Human]]s can neither manufacture nor digest it.
* ''Glycogen'', on the other hand, is an [[animal]] carbohydrate; humans and other animals use it as a form of energy storage.

===Use of carbohydrates as an energy source===
{{Main|Carbohydrate metabolism}}
Glucose is the major energy source in most life forms. For instance, polysaccharides are broken down into their monomers ([[glycogen phosphorylase]] removes glucose residues from glycogen). Disaccharides like lactose or [[sucrose]] are cleaved into their two component monosaccharides.

====Glycolysis (anaerobic)====
Glucose is mainly metabolized by a very important ten-step pathway called [[glycolysis]], the net result of which is to break down one molecule of glucose into two molecules of [[pyruvate]]; this also produces a net two molecules of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], the energy currency of cells, along with two reducing equivalents in the form of converting [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] to NADH. This does not require oxygen; if no oxygen is available (or the cell cannot use oxygen), the NAD is restored by converting the pyruvate to [[lactic acid|lactate (lactic acid)]] (e. g. in humans) or to [[ethanol]] plus carbon dioxide (e. g. in [[yeast]]). Other monosaccharides like galactose and fructose can be converted into intermediates of the glycolytic pathway.

====Aerobic====
In [[aerobic glycolysis|aerobic]] cells with sufficient oxygen, like most human cells, the pyruvate is further metabolized. It is irreversibly converted to [[acetyl-CoA]], giving off one carbon atom as the waste product [[carbon dioxide]], generating another reducing equivalent as [[NADH]]. The two molecules acetyl-CoA (from one molecule of glucose) then enter the [[citric acid cycle]], producing two more molecules of ATP, six more [[NADH]] molecules and two reduced (ubi)quinones (via [[FADH2|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] as enzyme-bound cofactor), and releasing the remaining carbon atoms as carbon dioxide. The produced NADH and quinol molecules then feed into the enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain, an [[electron transport system]] transferring the electrons ultimately to [[oxygen]] and conserving the released energy in the form of a proton gradient over a membrane (inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes). Thereby, oxygen is reduced to water and the original electron acceptors NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and quinone are regenerated. This is why humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. The energy released from transferring the electrons from high-energy states in NADH and quinol is conserved first as proton gradient and converted to ATP via ATP synthase. This generates an additional ''28'' molecules of ATP (24 from the 8 NADH + 4 from the 2 quinols), totaling to 32 molecules of ATP conserved per degraded glucose (two from glycolysis + two from the citrate cycle). It is clear that using oxygen to completely oxidize glucose provides an organism with far more energy than any oxygen-independent metabolic feature, and this is thought to be the reason why complex life appeared only after Earth's atmosphere accumulated large amounts of oxygen.

====Gluconeogenesis====
{{Main|Gluconeogenesis}}
In [[vertebrate]]s, vigorously contracting [[skeletal muscle]]s (during weightlifting or sprinting, for example) do not receive enough oxygen to meet the energy demand, and so they shift to [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|anaerobic metabolism]], converting glucose to lactate. The [[liver]] regenerates the glucose, using a process called [[gluconeogenesis]]. This process is not quite the opposite of glycolysis, and actually requires three times the amount of energy gained from glycolysis (six molecules of ATP are used, compared to the two gained in glycolysis). Analogous to the above reactions, the glucose produced can then undergo glycolysis in tissues that need energy, be stored as glycogen (or starch in plants), or be converted to other monosaccharides or joined into di- or oligosaccharides. The combined pathways of glycolysis during exercise, lactate's crossing via the bloodstream to the liver, subsequent gluconeogenesis and release of glucose into the bloodstream is called the [[Cori cycle]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Proteins==
{{Main|Protein}}
[[Image:1GZX Haemoglobin.png|thumb|right|150px|A schematic of [[hemoglobin]]. The red and blue ribbons represent the protein [[globin]]; the green structures are the [[heme]] groups.]]
Like carbohydrates, some proteins perform largely structural roles. For instance, movements of the proteins [[actin]] and [[myosin]] ultimately are responsible for the contraction of skeletal muscle. One property many proteins have is that they specifically bind to a certain molecule or class of molecules&amp;mdash;they may be ''extremely'' selective in what they bind. [[Antibody|Antibodies]] are an example of proteins that attach to one specific type of molecule. In fact, the [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA), which uses antibodies, is currently one of the most sensitive tests modern medicine uses to detect various biomolecules. Probably the most important proteins, however, are the [[enzyme]]s. These molecules recognize specific reactant molecules called ''[[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]s''; they then [[catalyze]] the reaction between them. By lowering the [[activation energy]], the enzyme speeds up that reaction by a rate of 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; or more: a reaction that would normally take over 3,000 years to complete spontaneously might take less than a second with an enzyme. The enzyme itself is not used up in the process, and is free to catalyze the same reaction with a new set of substrates. Using various modifiers, the activity of the enzyme can be regulated, enabling control of the biochemistry of the cell as a whole.

In essence, proteins are chains of [[amino acid]]s. An amino acid consists of a carbon atom bound to four groups. One is an [[amino]] group, &amp;mdash;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and one is a [[carboxylic acid]] group, &amp;mdash;COOH (although these exist as &amp;mdash;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and &amp;mdash;COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; under physiologic conditions). The third is a simple [[hydrogen]] atom. The fourth is commonly denoted &quot;&amp;mdash;R&quot; and is different for each amino acid. There are twenty standard amino acids. Some of these have functions by themselves or in a modified form; for instance, glutamate functions as an important [[neurotransmitter]].

[[Image:Amino acids 1.png|thumb|right|350px|Generic amino acids (1) in neutral form, (2) as they exist physiologically, and (3) joined together as a dipeptide.]]
Amino acids can be joined together via a [[peptide bond]]. In this dehydration synthesis, a water molecule is removed and the peptide bond connects the nitrogen of one amino acid's amino group to the carbon of the other's carboxylic acid group. The resulting molecule is called a ''[[dipeptide]]'', and short stretches of amino acids (usually, fewer than thirty) are called ''[[peptide]]s'' or polypeptides. Longer stretches merit the title ''proteins''. As an example, the important blood [[blood plasma|serum]] protein [[human serum albumin|albumin]] contains 585 amino acid residues.

The structure of proteins is traditionally described in a hierarchy of four levels. The [[primary structure]] of a protein simply consists of its linear sequence of amino acids; for instance, &quot;alanine-glycine-tryptophan-serine-glutamate-asparagine-glycine-lysine-…&quot;. [[Secondary structure]] is concerned with local morphology (morphology being the study of structure). Some combinations of amino acids will tend to curl up in a coil called an [[alpha helix|α-helix]] or into a sheet called a [[Beta sheet|β-sheet]]; some α-helixes can be seen in the hemoglobin schematic above. [[Tertiary structure]] is the entire three-dimensional shape of the protein. This shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids. In fact, a single change can change the entire structure. The alpha chain of hemoglobin contains 146 amino acid residues; substitution of the [[glutamate]] residue at position 6 with a [[valine]] residue changes the behavior of hemoglobin so much that it results in [[sickle-cell disease]]. Finally [[quaternary structure]] is concerned with the structure of a protein with multiple peptide subunits, like hemoglobin with its four subunits. Not all proteins have more than one subunit.

Ingested proteins are usually broken up into single amino acids or dipeptides in the [[small intestine]], and then absorbed. They can then be joined together to make new proteins. Intermediate products of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] can be used to make all twenty amino acids, and most bacteria and plants possess all the necessary enzymes to synthesize them. Humans and other mammals, however, can only synthesize half of them. They cannot synthesize [[isoleucine]], [[leucine]], [[lysine]], [[methionine]], [[phenylalanine]], [[threonine]], [[tryptophan]], and [[valine]]. These are the [[essential amino acid]]s, since it is essential to ingest them. Mammals do possess the enzymes to synthesize [[alanine]], [[asparagine]], [[aspartate]], [[cysteine]], [[glutamate]], [[glutamine]], [[glycine]], [[proline]], [[serine]], and [[tyrosine]], the nonessential amino acids. While they can synthesize [[arginine]] and [[histidine]], they cannot produce it in sufficient amounts for young, growing animals, and so these are often considered essential amino acids.

If the amino group is removed from an amino acid, it leaves behind a carbon skeleton called an α-[[keto acid]]. Enzymes called [[transaminase]]s can easily transfer the amino group from one amino acid (making it an α-keto acid) to another α-keto acid (making it an amino acid). This is important in the biosynthesis of amino acids, as for many of the pathways, intermediates from other biochemical pathways are converted to the α-keto acid skeleton, and then an amino group is added, often via [[transamination]]. The amino acids may then be linked together to make a protein.

A similar process is used to break down proteins. It is first hydrolyzed into its component amino acids. Free [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), existing as the [[ammonium]] ion (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in blood, is toxic to life forms. A suitable method for excreting it must therefore exist. Different strategies have evolved in different animals, depending on the animals' needs. [[Unicellular]] organisms, of course, simply release the ammonia into the environment. Similarly, [[osteichthyes|bony fish]] can release the ammonia into the water where it is quickly diluted. In general, mammals convert the ammonia into urea, via the [[urea cycle]].

==Lipids==
{{Main|Lipid}}

The term lipid comprises a diverse range of [[molecules]] and to some extent is a catchall for relatively water-insoluble or [[nonpolar]] compounds of biological origin, including [[wax]]es, [[fatty acid]]s, fatty-acid derived [[phospholipid]]s, [[sphingolipid]]s, [[glycolipid]]s and [[terpenoid]]s (e.g. [[retinoid]]s and [[steroid]]s). Some lipids are linear [[aliphatic]] molecules, while others have ring structures. Some are [[aromatic]], while others are not. Some are flexible, while others are rigid.

Most lipids have some [[polar molecule|polar]] character in addition to being largely nonpolar. Generally, the bulk of their structure is nonpolar or [[hydrophobic]] (&quot;water-fearing&quot;), meaning that it does not interact well with polar solvents like water. Another part of their structure is polar or [[hydrophilic]] (&quot;water-loving&quot;) and will tend to associate with polar solvents like water. This makes them [[amphiphilic]] molecules (having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions). In the case of [[cholesterol]], the polar group is a mere -OH ([[hydroxyl]] or alcohol). In the case of phospholipids, the polar groups are considerably larger and more polar, as described below.

Lipids are an integral part of our daily diet. Most [[oil]]s and [[milk products]] that we use for cooking and eating like [[butter]], [[cheese]], [[ghee]] etc., are composed of [[fat]]s. [[Vegetable oil]]s are rich in various [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s (PUFA). Lipid-containing foods undergo digestion within the body and are broken into fatty acids and [[glycerol]], which are the final degradation products of fats and lipids.

==Nucleic acids==
{{Main|Nucleic acid}}

A nucleic acid is a complex, high-molecular-weight biochemical [[macromolecule]] composed of nucleotide chains that convey [[genetic information]]. The most common nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid ([[RNA]]). Nucleic acids are found in all living cells and viruses.  Aside from the genetic material of the cell, nucleic acids often play a role as [[second messenger]]s, as well as forming the base molecule for [[adenosine triphosphate]], the primary energy-carrier molecule found in all living organisms.

Nucleic acid, so called because of its prevalence in cellular [[cell nucleus|nuclei]], is the generic name of the family of [[biopolymer]]s. The monomers are called [[nucleotide]]s, and each consists of three components: a nitrogenous heterocyclic [[base (chemistry)|base]] (either a [[purine]] or a [[pyrimidine]]), a [[pentose]] [[sugar]], and a [[phosphate]] group. Different nucleic acid types differ in the specific sugar found in their chain (e.g. DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid contains 2-[[deoxyribose]]s). Also, the nitrogenous bases possible in the two nucleic acids are different: [[adenine]], [[cytosine]], and [[guanine]] occur in both RNA and DNA, while [[thymine]] occurs only in DNA and [[uracil]] occurs in RNA.

==Relationship to other &quot;molecular-scale&quot; biological sciences==
[[Image:Schematic relationship between biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology.svg|thumb|250px|right|''Schematic relationship between biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology'']]
Researchers in biochemistry use specific techniques native to biochemistry, but increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas from [[genetics]], [[molecular biology]] and [[biophysics]]. There has never been a hard-line between these disciplines in terms of content and technique. Today the terms ''molecular biology'' and ''biochemistry'' are nearly interchangeable. The following figure is a schematic that depicts one possible view of the relationship between the fields:
[[File:Chemical basis of love.png|thumb|left|230px|Simplistic overview of the [[Chemical basis for love|chemical basis of love]], one of many applications that may be described in terms of biochemistry.]]
*''Biochemistry'' is the study of the chemical substances and vital processes occurring in living [[organism]]s. [[Biochemist]]s focus heavily on the role, function, and structure of [[biomolecules]]. The study of the chemistry behind biological processes and the synthesis of biologically active molecules are examples of biochemistry.
*''Genetics'' is the study of the effect of genetic differences on organisms. Often this can be inferred by the absence of a normal component (e.g. one [[gene]]). The study of &quot;[[mutant]]s&quot; &amp;ndash; organisms which lack one or more functional components with respect to the so-called &quot;[[wild type]]&quot; or normal [[phenotype]]. [[Genetic interactions]] ([[epistasis]]) can often confound simple interpretations of such &quot;knock-out&quot; studies.
*''Molecular biology'' is the study of molecular underpinnings of the process of replication, transcription and translation of the [[genetic material]]. The [[central dogma of molecular biology]] where genetic material is transcribed into RNA and then translated into protein, despite being an oversimplified picture of molecular biology, still provides a good starting point for understanding the field. This picture, however, is undergoing revision in light of emerging novel roles for [[RNA]].
*''Chemical Biology'' seeks to develop new tools based on [[small molecule]]s that allow minimal perturbation of biological systems while providing detailed information about their function. Further, chemical biology employs biological systems to create non-natural hybrids between biomolecules and synthetic devices (for example emptied viral capsids that can deliver [[gene therapy]] or drug molecules).

'''Badminton''' is a [[Outline of sports#Racquet (or racket) sports|racquet sport]] played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles), who take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court that is divided by a net. Players score points by striking a [[shuttlecock]] (also known as a ''shuttle'', ''bird'', or ''birdy'') with their racquet so that it passes over the net and lands in their opponents' half of the court. Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. A rally ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor.

The shuttlecock (or shuttle) is a feathered projectile whose unique aerodynamic properties cause it to fly differently from the balls used in most racquet sports; in particular, the feathers create much higher [[drag (physics)|drag]], causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly than a ball. Shuttlecocks have a much higher top speed, when compared to other racquet sports. Because shuttlecock flight is affected by wind, competitive badminton is played indoors. Badminton is also played outdoors as a casual recreational activity, often as a garden or beach game.

Since 1992, badminton has been an [[Olympic sports|Olympic sport]] with five [[competition|events]]: men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles, and mixed doubles, in which each pair consists of a man and a woman. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good [[motor coordination]] and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.

==History and development==
[[File:Battledore - Youthful Sports.png|thumb|left|Game of [[Battledore and Shuttlecock]] in 1804]]
[[File:Battledore-and-shuttlecock.jpg|right|thumb|280px|''Battledore and Shuttlecock''. ''1854, from the [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] Archive''&lt;ref&gt;Cartoon taken from the [http://john-leech-archive.org.uk John Leech Archive] which gave the artist as John Leech and the date as 1854.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The beginnings of Badminton can be traced to mid-18th century [[British India]], where it was created by [[United Kingdom|British]] military officers stationed there.&lt;ref name=Guillain47/&gt; Early photographs show Englishmen adding a net to the traditional [[England|English]] game of [[battledore and shuttlecock]]. Being particularly popular in the British garrison town Poona (now [[Pune]]), the game also came to be known as ''Poona''.&lt;ref name=Guillain47&gt;{{Cite book|last=Guillain|first=Jean-Yves|title=Badminton: An Illustrated History|publisher=Publibook|date=2004-09-02|isbn=2748305728|accessdate=2009-01-25|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OFB195&gt;{{Cite book|last=Connors|first=M|coauthors=Dupuis, D.

This game was taken by retired officers back to England where it developed and rules were set out.

As early as 1860, [[Isaac Spratt]], a London toy dealer, published a booklet, ''Badminton Battledore - a new game'', but unfortunately no copy has survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Battledore-Shuttlecock.htm|title=Battledore and Shuttlecock|last=Masters|first=James|publisher=The Online Guide to Traditional Games|accessdate=2007-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new sport was definitively launched in 1873 at the [[Badminton House]], [[Gloucestershire]], owned by the [[Duke of Beaufort]]. During that time, the game was referred to as &quot;The Game of Badminton,&quot; and the game's official name became Badminton.&lt;ref name=USM&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usm.edu/~badminton/History.htm|title=The history of Badminton|publisher=The University of Southern Mississippi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1887, the sport was played in England under the rules that prevailed in British India. The Bath Badminton Club standardized the rules and made the game applicable to English ideas. The basic regulations were drawn up in 1887.&lt;ref name=USM/&gt; In 1893, the Badminton Association of England published the first set of rules according to these regulations, similar to today's rules, and officially launched badminton in a house called &quot;Dunbar&quot; at 6 Waverley Grove, [[Portsmouth]], England on September 13 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbadminton.com/newsite/History/index.html|title=History of Badminton: Founding of the BAE and Codification of the Rules|publisher=WorldBadminton.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also started the [[All England Open Badminton Championships]], the first badminton competition in the world, in 1899.

The International Badminton Federation (IBF) (now known as [[Badminton World Federation]]) was established in 1934 with [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Ireland]], New Zealand, Scotland, and Wales as its founding members. [[India]] joined as an affiliate in 1936. The BWF now governs international badminton and develops the sport globally.

While initiated in England, competitive men's badminton in Europe has traditionally been dominated by Denmark. Asian nations, however, have been the most dominant ones at the world level. Indonesia, South Korea, China, and Malaysia along with Denmark are among the nations that have consistently produced world-class players in the past few decades, with China being the greatest force in both men's and women's competition in recent years.

==Laws==
The following information is a simplified summary of the Laws, not a complete reproduction. The definitive source of the Laws is the BWF Statutes publication,&lt;ref name=laws&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationalbadminton.org/page.aspx?id=10513|title=Laws of Badminton|publisher=Badminton World Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the digital distribution of the Laws contains poor reproductions of the diagrams.

===Playing court dimensions===
[[File:Badminton court 3d.svg|right|thumb|400px|Badminton court, [[isometric projection|isometric]] view]]
The court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play, although the laws permit a court to be marked for singles only. The doubles court is wider than the singles court, but both are of same length. The exception, which often causes confusion to newer players, is that the doubles court has a shorter serve-length dimension.

The full width of the court is 6.1&amp;nbsp;metres (20&amp;nbsp;ft), and in singles this width is reduced to 5.18&amp;nbsp;metres (17&amp;nbsp;ft). The full length of the court is 13.4&amp;nbsp;metres (44&amp;nbsp;ft). The service courts are marked by a centre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service line at a distance of 1.98&amp;nbsp;metres (6&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;inch) from the net, and by the outer side and back boundaries. In doubles, the service court is also marked by a long service line, which is 0.76&amp;nbsp;metres (2&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;inch) from the back boundary.

The net is 1.55&amp;nbsp;metres (5&amp;nbsp;ft 1&amp;nbsp;inch) high at the edges and 1.524&amp;nbsp;metres (5&amp;nbsp;ft) high in the centre. The net posts are placed over the doubles sidelines, even when singles is played.

The minimum height for the ceiling above the court is not mentioned in the Laws of Badminton. Nonetheless, a badminton court will not be suitable if the ceiling is likely to be hit on a high serve.

===Equipment laws===
The laws specify which equipment may be used. In particular, the laws restrict the design and size of racquets and shuttlecocks. The laws also provide for testing a shuttlecock for the correct speed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
; 3.1 : To test a shuttlecock, use a full underhand stroke which makes contact with the shuttlecock over the back boundary line. The shuttlecock shall be hit at an upward angle and in a direction parallel to the side lines.

; 3.2 : A shuttlecock of the correct speed will land not less than 530&amp;nbsp;mm and not more than 990&amp;nbsp;mm short of the other back boundary line.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Scoring system and service===
{{Main|Scoring system development of badminton}}

====The basics====
Each game is played to 21 points, with players scoring a point whenever they win a rally regardless of whether they served &lt;ref name=laws/&gt; (this differs from the old system where players could only win a point on their serve and each game was played to 15 points). A match is the best of three games.

At the start of the rally, the server and receiver stand in diagonally opposite ''service courts'' (see [[#Playing court dimensions|court dimensions]]). The server hits the shuttlecock so that it would land in the receiver's service court. This is similar to [[tennis]], except that a badminton serve must be hit below waist height and with the racquet shaft pointing downwards, the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce and in badminton, the players stand inside their service courts unlike tennis.

When the serving side loses a rally, the serve immediately passes to their opponent(s) (this differs from the old system where sometimes the serve passes to the doubles partner for what is known as a &quot;second serve&quot;).

In singles, the server stands in their right service court when their score is even, and in her/his left service court when her/his score is odd.

In doubles, if the serving side wins a rally, the same player continues to serve, but he/she changes service courts so that she/he serves to a different opponent each time. If the opponents win the rally and their new score is even, the player in the right service court serves; if odd, the player in the left service court serves. The players' service courts are determined by their positions at the start of the previous rally, not by where they were standing at the end of the rally. A consequence of this system is that, each time a side regains the service, the server will be the player who did ''not'' serve last time.

====Details====
When the server serves, the shuttlecock must pass over the short service line on the opponents' court or it will count as a fault.

If the score reaches 20-all, then the game continues until one side gains a two point lead (such as 24-22), up to a maximum of 30 points (30-29 is a winning score).

At the start of a match, the shuttlecock is cast and where ever the shuttlecock is pointing that side begins or a coin is tossed. The winners of the coin toss may choose whether to serve or receive first, or they may choose which end of the court they wish to occupy. Their opponents make the remaining choice. In less formal settings, the coin toss is often replaced by hitting a shuttlecock into the air: whichever side the corked end points will be the side that serves first.

In subsequent games, the winners of the previous game serve first. These can also be called rubbers. If one team wins a game they play once more and if they win again they win that match, but if they lose they play one more match to find the winning team. For the first rally of any doubles game, the serving pair may decide who serves and the receiving pair may decide who receives. The players change ends at the start of the second game; if the match reaches a third game, they change ends both at the start of the game and when the leading pair's score reaches 11 points.

The server and receiver must remain within their service courts, without touching the boundary lines, until the server strikes the shuttlecock. The other two players may stand wherever they wish, so long as they do not unsight the opposing server or receiver.

====Lets====
If a let is called, the rally is stopped and replayed with no change to the score. Lets may occur because of some unexpected disturbance such as a shuttlecock landing on court (having been hit there by players on an adjacent court) or in small halls the shuttle may touch an overhead rail which can be classed as a let.

If the receiver is not ready when the service is delivered, a let shall be called; yet, if the receiver attempts to return the shuttlecock, he shall be judged to have been ready.

There is no let if the shuttlecock hits the tape (even on service).

==Equipment==
[[File:Heads of badminton raquets.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Badminton [[racquet]]s]]

===Racquets===
Badminton [[racquet]]s are lightweight, with top quality racquets weighing between 70 and 95&amp;nbsp;grams (2.4 to 3.3 ounces) not including grip or strings.&lt;ref name=oqgysc&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.badmintoncentral.com/badminton-central/content/view/91/26/ |title=Badminton Central Guide to choosing Badminton Equipment|first=Kwun|date=2005-02-28|publisher=BadmintonCentral.com|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070311234023/http://www.badmintoncentral.com/badminton-central/content/view/91/26/|archivedate=2007-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.karakal.com/index.php/8/product/72/sl-70/|title=SL-70|publisher=Karakal|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071016051147/http://www.karakal.com/index.php/8/product/72/sl-70/|archivedate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are composed of many different materials ranging from [[carbon fiber composite|carbon fibre composite]] ([[graphite reinforced plastic]]) to solid steel, which may be augmented by a variety of materials. [[carbon fiber|Carbon fibre]] has an excellent strength to weight ratio, is stiff, and gives excellent [[kinetic energy]] transfer. Before the adoption of carbon fibre composite, racquets were made of light metals such as aluminium. Earlier still, racquets were made of wood. Cheap racquets are still often made of metals such as steel, but wooden racquets are no longer manufactured for the ordinary market, because of their excessive mass and cost. Nowadays, nanomaterials such as [[fullerene]] and [[carbon nanotubes]] are added to rackets giving them greater durability.

There is a wide variety of racquet designs, although the laws limit the racquet size and shape. Different racquets have playing characteristics that appeal to different players. The traditional oval head shape is still available, but an [[wikt:isometric|isometric]] head shape is increasingly common in new racquets.

===Strings===
Badminton strings are thin, high performing strings in the range of about 0.62 to 0.73&amp;nbsp;mm thickness. Thicker strings are more durable, but many players prefer the feel of thinner strings. String tension is normally in the range of 80 to 160&amp;nbsp;[[newton (unit)|N]] (18 to 36 [[pound-force|lbf]]). Recreational players generally string at lower tensions than professionals, typically between 80 and 110 N (18 and 25 lbf). Professionals string between about 110 and 160 N (25 and 36 lbf). Some string manufacturers measure the thickness of their strings under tension so they are actually thicker then than specified when slack. Ashaway Micropower is actually 0.7mm but Yonex BG-66 is about 0.72mm. 

It is often argued that high string tensions improve control, whereas low string tensions increase power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prospeed.com.my/String.htm |title=String tension relating to power and control|publisher=Prospeed |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071028080241/http://www.prospeed.com.my/String.htm |archivedate = 2007-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arguments for this generally rely on crude mechanical reasoning, such as claiming that a lower tension string bed is more bouncy and therefore provides more power. This is in fact incorrect, for a higher string tension can cause the shuttle to slide off the racquet and hence make it harder to hit a shot accurately. An alternative view suggests that the optimum tension for power depends on the player:&lt;ref name=&quot;oqgysc&quot;/&gt; the faster and more accurately a player can swing their racquet, the higher the tension for maximum power. Neither view has been subjected to a rigorous mechanical analysis, nor is there clear evidence in favour of one or the other. The most effective way for a player to find a good string tension is to experiment.

===Grip===
The choice of grip allows a player to increase the thickness of his racquet handle and choose a comfortable surface to hold. A player may build up the handle with one or several grips before applying the final layer.

Players may choose between a variety of grip materials. The most common choices are [[polyurethane|PU]] synthetic grips or towelling grips. Grip choice is a matter of personal preference. Players often find that sweat becomes a problem; in this case, a drying agent may be applied to the grip or hands, sweatbands may be used, the player may choose another grip material or change his grip more frequently.

There are two main types of grip: ''replacement'' grips and ''overgrips''. Replacement grips are thicker, and are often used to increase the size of the handle. Overgrips are thinner (less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm), and are often used as the final layer. Many players, however, prefer to use replacement grips as the final layer. Towelling grips are always replacement grips. Replacement grips have an adhesive backing, whereas overgrips have only a small patch of adhesive at the start of the tape and must be applied under tension; overgrips are more convenient for players who change grips frequently, because they may be removed more rapidly without damaging the underlying material.
[[File:Shuttlecocks Yonex Aerosensa 20.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Shuttlecock]]s with feathers]]
[[File:ShuttlecockPhoto.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A shuttlecock with a plastic skirt]]

===Shuttlecock===
{{Main|Shuttlecock}}
A shuttlecock (often abbreviated to ''shuttle''; also called a ''birdie'') is a high-drag [[projectile]], with an open [[Cone (geometry)|conical shape]]: the cone is formed from sixteen overlapping [[feathers]] embedded into a rounded cork base. The [[Cork (material)|cork]] is covered with thin [[leather]] or synthetic material.

[[Nylon (material)|Synthetic]] shuttles are often used by recreational players to reduce their costs as feathered shuttles break easily. These nylon shuttles may be constructed with either natural cork or synthetic foam base, and a plastic skirt.

===Shoes===
Badminton [[Athletic shoe|shoes]] are lightweight with soles of [[rubber]] or similar high-grip, non-marking materials.

Compared to running shoes, badminton shoes have little [[lateral support]]. High levels of lateral support are useful for activities where lateral motion is undesirable and unexpected. Badminton, however, requires powerful lateral movements. A highly built-up lateral support will not be able to protect the foot in badminton; instead, it will encourage catastrophic collapse at the point where the shoe's support fails, and the player's ankles are not ready for the sudden loading, which can cause sprains. For this reason, players should choose badminton shoes rather than general trainers or running shoes, because proper badminton shoes will have a very thin sole, lower a person's centre of gravity, and therefore result in fewer injuries. Players should also ensure that they learn safe and proper footwork, with the knee and foot in alignment on all lunges. This is not more than just a safety concern; proper footwork is also critical in order to move effectively around the court.

==Strokes==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
[[File:GGOpen Setiadi.jpg|right|thumb|A player flies high at the Golden Gate Badminton Club (GGBC) in Menlo Park, 2006]]

===Forehand and backhand===
Badminton offers a wide variety of basic strokes, and players require a high level of skill to perform all of them effectively. All strokes can be played either ''forehand'' or ''backhand''. A player's forehand side is the same side as their playing hand: for a right-handed player, the forehand side is their right side and the backhand side is their left side. Forehand strokes are hit with the front of the hand leading (like hitting with the palm), whereas backhand strokes are hit with the back of the hand leading (like hitting with the knuckles). Players frequently play certain strokes on the forehand side with a backhand hitting action, and vice versa.

In the forecourt and midcourt, most strokes can be played equally effectively on either the forehand or backhand side; but in the rearcourt, players will attempt to play as many strokes as possible on their forehands, often preferring to play a ''round-the-head'' forehand overhead (a forehand &quot;on the backhand side&quot;) rather than attempt a backhand overhead. Playing a backhand overhead has two main disadvantages. First, the player must turn their back to their opponents, restricting their view of them and the court. Second, backhand overheads cannot be hit with as much power as forehands: the hitting action is limited by the shoulder joint, which permits a much greater range of movement for a forehand overhead than for a backhand. The ''backhand clear'' is considered by most players and coaches to be the most difficult basic stroke in the game, since precise technique is needed in order to muster enough power for the shuttlecock to travel the full length of the court. For the same reason, ''backhand smashes'' tend to be weak.

===Position of the shuttlecock and receiving player===
[[File:BadmintonService.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A player does a forehand service, 2009, Philadelphia.]]
The choice of stroke depends on how near the shuttlecock is to the net, whether it is above net height, and where an opponent is currently positioned: players have much better attacking options if they can reach the shuttlecock well above net height, especially if it is also close to the net. '''In the forecourt''', a high shuttlecock will be met with a ''net kill'', hitting it steeply downwards and attempting to win the rally immediately. This is why it is best to drop the shuttlecock just over the net in this situation. '''In the midcourt''', a high shuttlecock will usually be met with a powerful ''smash'', also hitting downwards and hoping for an outright winner or a weak reply. Athletic ''jump smashes'', where players jump upwards for a steeper smash angle, are a common and spectacular element of elite men's doubles play. '''In the rearcourt''', players strive to hit the shuttlecock while it is still above them, rather than allowing it to drop lower. This ''overhead'' hitting allows them to play smashes, ''clears'' (hitting the shuttlecock high and to the back of the opponents' court), and dropshots (hitting the shuttlecock so that it falls softly downwards into the opponents' forecourt). If the shuttlecock has dropped lower, then a smash is impossible and a full-length, high clear is difficult.
[[File:BadmintonJumpSmash.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A player prepares for a vertical jump smash]]

===Vertical position of the shuttlecock===
'''When the shuttlecock is well below net height''', players have no choice but to hit upwards. ''Lifts'', where the shuttlecock is hit upwards to the back of the opponents' court, can be played from all parts of the court. If a player does not lift, his only remaining option is to push the shuttlecock softly back to the net: in the forecourt this is called a ''netshot''; in the midcourt or rearcourt, it is often called a ''push'' or ''block''.

'''When the shuttlecock is near to net height''', players can hit ''drives'', which travel flat and rapidly over the net into the opponents' rear midcourt and rearcourt. Pushes may also be hit flatter, placing the shuttlecock into the front midcourt. Drives and pushes may be played from the midcourt or forecourt, and are most often used in doubles: they are an attempt to regain the attack, rather than choosing to lift the shuttlecock and defend against smashes. After a successful drive or push, the opponents will often be forced to lift the shuttlecock.

===Other factors===
'''When defending against a smash''', players have three basic options: lift, block, or drive. In singles, a block to the net is the most common reply. In doubles, a lift is the safest option but it usually allows the opponents to continue smashing; blocks and drives are counter-attacking strokes, but may be intercepted by the smasher's partner. Many players use a backhand hitting action for returning smashes on both the forehand and backhand sides, because backhands are more effective than forehands at covering smashes directed to the body. It is very good tool to play hard shots which are directed towards your body.

'''The service''' is restricted by [[#Laws of the game|the Laws]] and presents its own array of stroke choices. Unlike in tennis, the servers racket must be pointing in a downward direction to deliver the serve so normally the shuttle must be hit upwards to pass over the net. The server can choose a ''low serve'' into the forecourt (like a push), or a lift to the back of the service court, or a flat ''drive serve''. Lifted serves may be either ''high serves'', where the shuttlecock is lifted so high that it falls almost vertically at the back of the court, or ''flick serves'', where the shuttlecock is lifted to a lesser height but falls sooner.

===Deception===
Once players have mastered these basic strokes, they can hit the shuttlecock from and to any part of the court, powerfully and softly as required. Beyond the basics, however, badminton offers rich potential for advanced stroke skills that provide a competitive advantage. Because badminton players have to cover a short distance as quickly as possible, the purpose of many advanced strokes is to deceive the opponent, so that either he is tricked into believing that a different stroke is being played, or he is forced to delay his movement until he actually sees the shuttle's direction. &quot;Deception&quot; in badminton is often used in both of these senses. When a player is genuinely deceived, he will often lose the point immediately because he cannot change his direction quickly enough to reach the shuttlecock. Experienced players will be aware of the trick and cautious not to move too early, but the attempted deception is still useful because it forces the opponent to delay his movement slightly. Against weaker players whose intended strokes are obvious, an experienced player may move before the shuttlecock has been hit, anticipating the stroke to gain an advantage.

''Slicing'' and using a ''shortened hitting action'' are the two main technical devices that facilitate deception. Slicing involves hitting the shuttlecock with an angled racquet face, causing it to travel in a different direction than suggested by the body or arm movement. Slicing also causes the shuttlecock to travel much slower than the arm movement suggests. For example, a good crosscourt ''sliced dropshot'' will use a hitting action that suggests a straight clear or smash, deceiving the opponent about both the power and direction of the shuttlecock. A more sophisticated slicing action involves brushing the strings around the shuttlecock during the hit, in order to make the shuttlecock spin. This can be used to improve the shuttle's trajectory, by making it dip more rapidly as it passes the net; for example, a sliced low serve can travel slightly faster than a normal low serve, yet land on the same spot. Spinning the shuttlecock is also used to create ''spinning netshots'' (also called ''tumbling netshots''), in which the shuttlecock turns over itself several times (tumbles) before stabilizing; sometimes the shuttlecock remains inverted instead of tumbling. The main advantage of a spinning netshot is that the opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has stopped tumbling, since hitting the feathers will result in an unpredictable stroke. Spinning netshots are especially important for high level singles players.

The lightness of modern racquets allows players to use a very short hitting action for many strokes, thereby maintaining the option to hit a powerful or a soft stroke until the last possible moment. For example, a singles player may hold his racquet ready for a netshot, but then flick the shuttlecock to the back instead with a shallow lift when she or he notices the opponent has moved before the actual shot was played. A shallow lift takes less time to reach the ground and as mentioned above a rally is over when the shuttlecock touches the ground. This makes the opponent's task of covering the whole court much more difficult than if the lift was hit higher and with a bigger, obvious swing. A short hitting action is not only useful for deception: it also allows the player to hit powerful strokes when he has no time for a big arm swing. A big arm swing is also usually not advised in badminton because bigger swings make it more difficult to recover for the next shot in fast exchanges. The use of grip tightening is crucial to these techniques, and is often described as ''finger power''. Elite players develop finger power to the extent that they can hit some power strokes, such as net kills, with less than a {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=on}} racquet swing.

It is also possible to reverse this style of deception, by suggesting a powerful stroke before slowing down the hitting action to play a soft stroke. In general, this latter style of deception is more common in the rearcourt (for example, dropshots disguised as smashes), whereas the former style is more common in the forecourt and midcourt (for example, lifts disguised as netshots).

Deception is not limited to slicing and short hitting actions. Players may also use ''double motion'', where they make an initial racquet movement in one direction before withdrawing the racquet to hit in another direction. Players will often do this to send opponents in the wrong direction. The racquet movement is typically used to suggest a straight angle but then play the stroke cross court, or vice versa. ''Triple motion'' is also possible, but this is very rare in actual play. An alternative to double motion is to use a ''racquet head fake'', where the initial motion is continued but the racquet is turned during the hit. This produces a smaller change in direction, but does not require as much time.

==Strategy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
To win in badminton, players need to employ a wide variety of strokes in the right situations. These range from powerful jumping smashes to delicate tumbling net returns. Often rallies finish with a smash, but setting up the smash requires subtler strokes. For example, a netshot can force the opponent to lift the shuttlecock, which gives an opportunity to smash. If the netshot is tight and tumbling, then the opponent's lift will not reach the back of the court, which makes the subsequent smash much harder to return.

Deception is also important. Expert players prepare for many different strokes that look identical, and use slicing to deceive their opponents about the speed or direction of the stroke. If an opponent tries to anticipate the stroke, he may move in the wrong direction and may be unable to change his body momentum in time to reach the shuttlecock.

===Doubles===
Both pairs will try to gain and maintain the attack, smashing downwards when possible. Whenever possible, a pair will adopt an ideal attacking formation with one player hitting down from the rearcourt, and his partner in the midcourt intercepting all smash returns except the lift. If the rearcourt attacker plays a dropshot, his partner will move into the forecourt to threaten the net reply. If a pair cannot hit downwards, they will use flat strokes in an attempt to gain the attack. If a pair is forced to lift or clear the shuttlecock, then they must defend: they will adopt a side-by-side position in the rear midcourt, to cover the full width of their court against the opponents' smashes. In doubles, players generally smash to the middle ground between two players in order to take advantage of confusion and clashes.

At high levels of play, the backhand serve has become popular to the extent that forehand serves have become fairly rare at a high level of play. The straight low serve is used most frequently, in an attempt to prevent the opponents gaining the attack immediately. Flick serves are used to prevent the opponent from anticipating the low serve and attacking it decisively.

At high levels of play, doubles rallies are extremely fast. Men's doubles is the most aggressive form of badminton, with a high proportion of powerful jump smashes.
[[File:Scottish Schools U12 mixed doubles badminton tournament.jpg|right|thumb|340px|A mixed doubles game - Scottish Schools under 12s tournament, [[Tranent]], May 2002]]

===Singles===
The singles court is narrower than the doubles court, but the same length. Since one person needs to cover the entire court, singles tactics are based on forcing the opponent to move as much as possible; this means that singles strokes are normally directed to the corners of the court. Players exploit the length of the court by combining lifts and clears with drop shots and net shots. Smashing is less prominent in singles than in doubles because players are rarely in the ideal position to execute a smash, and smashing often leaves the smasher vulnerable if the smash is returned.

In singles, players will often start the rally with a forehand high serve or with a flick serve. Low serves are also used frequently, either forehand or backhand. Drive serves are rare.

At high levels of play, singles demands extraordinary fitness. Singles is a game of patient positional manoeuvring, unlike the all-out aggression of doubles.

===Mixed doubles===
In mixed doubles, both pairs typically try to maintain an attacking formation with the woman at the front and the man at the back. This is because the male players are usually substantially stronger, and can therefore produce smashes that are more powerful. As a result, mixed doubles require greater tactical awareness and subtler positional play. Clever opponents will try to reverse the ideal position, by forcing the woman towards the back or the man towards the front. In order to protect against this danger, mixed players must be careful and systematic in their shot selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.badmintonplanet.com/cgi-bin/playbetter/strategies.html |title=Badminton Strategies and Tactics for the Novice and Recreational Player|last=Kumekawa|first=Eugene|publisher=BadmintonPlanet |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070126195758/http://www.badmintonplanet.com/cgi-bin/playbetter/strategies.html |archivedate = 2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At high levels of play, the formations will generally be more flexible: the top women players are capable of playing powerfully from the back-court, and will happily do so if required. When the opportunity arises, however, the pair will switch back to the standard mixed attacking position, with the woman in front.

==Governing bodies==
The Badminton World Federation (BWF) is the internationally recognized governing body of the sport. Five regional confederations are associated with the BWF:
* [[Asia]]: [[Badminton Asia Confederation]] (BAC)
* [[Africa]]: [[Badminton Confederation of Africa]] (BCA)
* [[Americas]]: [[Badminton Pan Am]] (North America and South America belong to the same confederation; BPA)
* [[Europe]]: [[Badminton Europe]] (BE)
* [[Oceania]]: [[Badminton Oceania]] (BO)

==Competitions==
[[File:Badminton men's doubles.jpg|thumb|340px|A mens doubles match. The blue lines are those for the badminton court. The other coloured lines denote uses for other sports – such complexity being common in multi-use sports halls.]]

The BWF organizes several international competitions, including the [[Thomas Cup]], the premier men's international team event first held in [[1949 Thomas Cup|1948&amp;ndash;1949]], and the [[Uber Cup]], the women's equivalent first held in [[1957 Uber Cup|1956&amp;ndash;1957]]. The competitions take place once every two years. More than 50 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within continental confederations for a place in the finals. The final tournament involves 12 teams, following an increase from eight teams in 2004.

The [[Sudirman Cup]], a gender-mixed international team event held once every two years, began in 1989. Teams are divided into seven levels based on the performance of each country. To win the tournament, a country must perform well across all five disciplines (men's doubles and singles, women's doubles and singles, and mixed doubles). Like [[association football]] (soccer), it features a promotion and relegation system in every level.

Badminton was a demonstration event in the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1988 Summer Olympics]]. It became an official [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympic]] sport at the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona Olympics]] in [[Badminton at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] and its gold medals now generally rate as the sport's most coveted prizes for individual players.

In the [[BWF World Championships]], first held in [[1977 IBF World Championships|1977]], only the highest ranked 64 players in the world, and a maximum of three from each country, can participate in any category. In both the Olympic and BWF World competitions restrictions  on the number of participants from any one country have caused some controversy because they sometimes result in excluding elite world level players from the strongest badminton powers such as China. The Thomas, Uber, and Sudirman Cups, the Olympics, and the BWF World (and [[BWF World Junior Championships|World Junior Championships]]), are all categorized as level one tournaments.

At the start of 2007, the BWF  introduced a new tournament structure for the highest level tournaments aside from those in level one: the [[BWF Super Series]]. This level two tournament series, a tour for the world's elite players,  stages twelve open tournaments around the world with 32 players (half the previous limit). The players collect points that determine whether they can play in Super Series Final held at the year end. Among the tournaments in this series is the venerable [[All England Open Badminton Championships|All-England Championships]], first held in 1900, which was once considered the unofficial world championships of the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/23/sports/EU_SPT_BAD_Super_Series.php|title=Badminton federation announces 12-event series |date=2006-09-23|work=The Associated Press|publisher=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.badders.com/news/item/849/international-badminton-gets-a-makeover.html|title=International badminton gets a makeover|first=Cybernoon.com|date=2006-12-14|publisher=Badders.com|accessdate=2008-10-25}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Level three tournaments consist of [[BWF Grand Prix Gold and Grand Prix|Grand Prix Gold and Grand Prix event]]. Top players can collect the world ranking points and enable them to play in the BWF Super Series open tournaments. These include the regional competitions in Asia ([[Badminton Asia Championships]]) and Europe ([[European Badminton Championships]]), which produce the world's best players as well as the [[Pan Am Badminton Championships|Pan America Badminton Championships]].

The level four tournaments, known as International Challenge, International Series and Future Series, encourage participation by junior players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.internationalbadminton.org/archivescontent.asp?pageid={4B7714F9-45C1-4199-B1B7-5B62C57FAE1A} |title=New Tournament Structure|date=2006-07-20|publisher=IBF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929134044/http://www.internationalbadminton.org/archivescontent.asp?pageid={4B7714F9-45C1-4199-B1B7-5B62C57FAE1A} |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons with other racquet sports==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2010}}
Badminton is frequently compared to tennis. The following is a list of uncontentious comparisons:
* In tennis, the ball may bounce once before the player hits it; in badminton, the rally ends once the shuttlecock touches the floor.
* In tennis, the serve is dominant to the extent that the server is expected to win most of his service games (at advanced level &amp; onwards); a ''break'' of service, where the server loses the game, is of major importance in a match. In badminton a server has far less advantage, and is unlikely to score an 'ace' (unreturnable serve).
* In tennis, the server is allowed two attempts to make a correct serve; in badminton, the server is allowed only one attempt.
* In tennis, a let is played on service if the ball hits the net tape; in badminton, there is no let on service.
* The tennis court is larger than the badminton court.
* Tennis racquets are about four times as heavy as badminton racquets, 10-12&amp;nbsp;ounces (approximately 284-340&amp;nbsp;grams) versus 2-3 ounces (70-105&amp;nbsp;grams).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tennis.about.com/od/tennisracquetsfaq/f/faqracquets43.htm|title=What is the ideal weight for a tennis racquet?|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prospeed.com.my/choosing.htm |title=The contribution of technology on badminton rackets|publisher=Prospeed |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071011150444/http://prospeed.com.my/choosing.htm |archivedate = 2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tennis balls are more than eleven times heavier than shuttlecocks, 57&amp;nbsp;grams versus 5&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/ShefiuAzeez.shtml|title=Mass of a Tennis Ball|year=2000|last=Azeez|first=Shefiu|publisher=Hypertextbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wooster.edu/physics/jrIS/Files/McCreary.pdf|title=A Study of the Motion of a Free Falling Shuttlecock|format=PDF|last=M.

* The fastest recorded tennis stroke is [[Ivo Karlovic]]'s {{convert|156|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} serve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chase|first=Chris|title=Video: Anticlimactically, Karlovic hits the fastest serve in history|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/tennis/blog/busted_racquet/post/Video-Anticlimactically-Karlovic-hits-the-fast?urn=ten-330652|accessdate=2011-03-25|newspaper=Yahoo!

===Comparisons of speed and athletic requirements===
Statistics such as the smash speed, above, prompt badminton enthusiasts to make other comparisons that are more contentious. For example, it is often claimed that badminton is the fastest racquet sport.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Although badminton holds the record for the fastest initial speed of a racket sports projectile, the shuttlecock decelerates substantially faster than other projectiles such as tennis balls. In turn, this qualification must be qualified by consideration of the distance over which the shuttlecock travels: a smashed shuttlecock travels a shorter distance than a tennis ball during a serve. Badminton's claim as the fastest racquet sport might also be based on reaction time requirements, but arguably [[table tennis]] requires even faster reaction times.

While fans of badminton and tennis often claim that their sport is the more physically demanding, such comparisons are difficult to make objectively because of the differing demands of the games. No formal study currently exists evaluating the physical condition of the players or demands during game play. 

===Comparisons of technique===
Badminton and tennis techniques differ substantially. The lightness of the shuttlecock and of badminton rackets allow badminton players to make use of the wrist and fingers much more than tennis players; in tennis the wrist is normally held stable, and playing with a mobile wrist may lead to injury. For the same reasons, badminton players can generate power from a short racket swing: for some strokes such as net kills, an elite player's swing may be less than {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on}}. For strokes that require more power, a longer swing will typically be used, but the badminton racket swing will rarely be as long as a typical tennis swing.

It is often asserted that power in badminton strokes comes mainly from the wrist. This is a misconception and may be criticised for two reasons. First, it is strictly speaking a [[category error]]: the wrist is a joint, not a muscle; the forearm muscles control its movement. Second, wrist movements are weak when compared to forearm or upper arm movements. Badminton [[biomechanics]] have not been the subject of extensive scientific study, but some studies confirm the minor role of the wrist in power generation, and indicate that the major contributions to power come from internal and external rotations of the upper and lower arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home5/PG02259480/badminton_smash.pdf|title=An Analysis of the Biomechanics of Arm Movement During a Badminton Smash|last=Kim|first=Wangdo|date=2002-10-01|publisher=Nanyang Technological University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern coaching resources such as the ''Badminton England Technique DVD'' reflect these ideas by emphasising forearm rotation rather than wrist movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.badmintonengland.co.uk/text.asp?section=0001000100070007|title=Badminton Technique DVD|publisher=Badminton England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinctive characteristics of the shuttlecock===
The shuttlecock differs greatly from the balls used in most other [[racquet sport]]s.

====Aerodynamic drag and stability====
The feathers impart substantial drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate greatly over distance. The shuttlecock is also extremely aerodynamically stable: regardless of initial orientation, it will turn to fly cork-first, and remain in the cork-first orientation.

One consequence of the shuttlecock's drag is that it requires considerable skill to hit it the full length of the court, which is not the case for most racquet sports. The drag also influences the flight path of a lifted (''lobbed'') shuttlecock: the [[parabola]] of its flight is heavily skewed so that it falls at a steeper angle than it rises. With very high serves, the shuttlecock may even fall vertically.

====Spin====
Balls may be spun to alter their bounce (for example, topspin and backspin in tennis), and players may slice the ball (strike it with an angled racket face) to produce such spin; but, since the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce, this does not apply to badminton.

Slicing the shuttlecock so that it spins, however, does have applications, and some are particular to badminton. (See [[#Basic Strokes|Basic strokes]] for an explanation of technical terms.)
* Slicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to travel in a different direction from the direction suggested by the player's racket or body movement. This is used to deceive opponents.
* Slicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to follow a slightly curved path (as seen from above), and the deceleration imparted by the spin causes sliced strokes to slow down more suddenly towards the end of their flight path. This can be used to create dropshots and smashes that dip more steeply after they pass the net.
* When playing a netshot, slicing underneath the shuttlecock may cause it to turn over itself (tumble) several times as it passes the net. This is called a ''spinning netshot'' or ''tumbling netshot''. The opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has corrected its orientation.

Due to the way that its feathers overlap, a shuttlecock also has a slight natural spin about its axis of rotational symmetry. The spin is in a counter-clockwise direction as seen from above when dropping a shuttlecock. This natural spin affects certain strokes: a tumbling netshot is more effective if the slicing action is from right to left, rather than from left to right.&lt;ref&gt;The Spin Doctor, Power &amp; Precision Magazine, July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baroque''' ({{IPAc-en|us|icon|b|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ|k}} {{respell|bə|ROHK|'}}, {{IPAc-en|uk|b|ə|ˈ|r|ɒ|k}}) is an [[artistic style]] prevalent from the late 16th century to the early 18th century in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul|last=Fargis|title=The New York Public Library Desk Reference|year=1998|edition=third|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan General Reference|pages=262|isbn=0-02-862169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], which had decided at the time of the [[Council of Trent]], in response to the Protestant Reformation, that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'' (Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2005), p. 516.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[nobility|aristocracy]] also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumphant power and control. Baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts, grand staircases and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence.

==Etymology==
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the word ''baroque'' is derived from the Portuguese word &quot;barroco&quot;, Spanish &quot;barroco&quot;, or French &quot;baroque&quot;, all of which refer to a &quot;rough or imperfect pearl&quot;, though whether it entered those languages via Latin, Arabic, or some other source is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;''OED'' Online. Accessed 6 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A century ago, the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopedia Britanica 11th edition]], thought the term was derived from the Spanish ''barrueco'', a large, irregularly-shaped pearl, and it was for a time confined to the craft of the jeweller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/b/baroque.html |title=Baroque |work=Encyclopedia Britanica 1911 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others derive it from the [[mnemonic]] term &quot;Baroco&quot; denoting, in logical ''Scholastica'', a supposedly laboured form of [[syllogism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | last=Panofsky | first=Erwin | contribution=What is Baroque? |  title=Three Essays on Style| publisher=The MIT Press | year=1995 | pages=19 | ref=harv | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In informal usage, the word ''baroque'' can simply mean that something is &quot;elaborate&quot;, with many details, without reference to the Baroque styles of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

The word &quot;Baroque&quot;, like most [[Periodization|periodic]] or stylistic designations, was invented by later [[critic]]s rather than practitioners of the arts in the 17th and early 18th centuries.  It is a [[French language|French]] transliteration of the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] phrase &quot;pérola barroca&quot;, which means  &quot;irregular [[pearl]]&quot;, and natural pearls that deviate from the usual, regular forms so they do not have an [[axis of rotation]] are known as &quot;baroque pearls&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The term &quot;Baroque&quot; was initially used with a derogatory meaning, to underline the excesses of its emphasis. In particular, the term was used to describe its eccentric redundancy and noisy abundance of details, which sharply contrasted the clear and sober rationality of the Renaissance. Although it was long thought that the word as a critical term was first applied to architecture, in fact it appears earlier in reference to music, in an anonymous, satirical review of the première in October 1733 of Rameau’s ''Hippolyte et Aricie'', printed in the ''Mercure de France'' in May 1734. The critic implied that the novelty in this opera was &quot;du barocque&quot;, complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was filled with unremitting dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.&lt;ref&gt;Claude V. Palisca, &quot;Baroque&quot;. The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
&lt;div id=&quot;pejor&quot;&gt;In modern usage, the term &quot;Baroque&quot; may still be used, usually pejoratively,  describing works of art, craft, or design that are thought to have excessive ornamentation or complexity of line, or, as a [[synonym]] for &quot;[[Derogatory use of &quot;Byzantine&quot;|Byzantine]]&quot;, to describe literature, computer software, contracts, or laws that are thought to be excessively complex, indirect, or obscure in language, to the extent of concealing or confusing their meaning.

The word was first rehabilitated  by the [[Switzerland|Swiss-born]] [[Art History|art historian]], [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864&amp;ndash;1945) in his ''Renaissance und Barock'' (1888); Wölfflin identified the Baroque as &quot;movement imported into mass,&quot; an art antithetic to [[Renaissance]] art. He did not make the distinctions between [[Mannerism]] and Baroque that modern writers do, and he ignored the later phase, the academic Baroque that lasted into the 18th century. Writers in French and English did not begin to treat Baroque as a respectable study until Wölfflin's influence had made German scholarship pre-eminent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Development==
Beginning around the year 1600, the demands for new art resulted in what is now known as the Baroque.  

[[Image:Aeneas'_Flight_from_Troy_by_Federico_Barocci.jpg|thumb|''Aeneas flees burning Troy,'' [[Federico Barocci]], 1598]] The appeal of Baroque style turned consciously from the witty, intellectual qualities of 16th century [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] art to a visceral appeal aimed at the senses. It employed an [[iconography]] that was direct, simple, obvious, and dramatic.  Baroque art drew on certain broad and heroic tendencies in [[Annibale Carracci]] and his circle, and found inspiration in other artists such as [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]], and [[Federico Barocci]] nowadays sometimes termed 'proto-Baroque'.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Adampromethe.jpg|thumb|right|''Prometheus'', by [[Nicolas-Sébastien Adam]], 1737 ([[Louvre Museum|Louvre]])]] --&gt;
Seminal ideas of the Baroque can also be found in the work of [[Michelangelo Buonarroti|Michelangelo]] and [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]]. 

Some general parallels in music make the expression &quot;Baroque music&quot; useful. Contrasting phrase lengths, harmony and [[counterpoint]] ousted [[polyphony]], and orchestral color made a stronger appearance. (See [[Baroque music]].)

Though Baroque was superseded in many centers by the [[Rococo]] style, beginning in [[Early Modern France|France]] in the late 1720s, especially for interiors, paintings and the decorative arts, Baroque architecture remained a viable style until the advent of [[Neoclassicism]] in the later 18th century.

In paintings, Baroque gestures are broader than Mannerist gestures: less ambiguous, less arcane and mysterious, more like the stage gestures of [[opera]], a major Baroque art form. Baroque poses depend on ''[[contrapposto]]'' (&quot;counterpoise&quot;), the tension within the figures that moves the planes of shoulders and hips in counterdirections. It made the sculptures almost seem like they were about to move. 

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Berndavi.JPG|thumb|left|[[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]'s ''David'' (1623&amp;ndash;24): Baroque freeze-frame stopped action, ''contrapposto'' and theatrical emotion {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
The drier, chastened, less dramatic and coloristic, later stages of 18th century Baroque architectural style are often seen as a separate '''Late Baroque''' manifestation. (See [[Claude Perrault]].)  Academic characteristics in the neo-[[Palladian]] architectural style, epitomized by [[William Kent]], are a parallel development in Britain and the British colonies: within interiors, Kent's furniture designs are vividly influenced by the Baroque furniture of Rome and Genoa, hierarchical tectonic sculptural elements, meant never to be moved from their positions, completed the wall decoration. Baroque is a style of unity imposed upon rich, heavy detail.

==Painting ==
[[Image:JosefaObidos4.jpg|thumb|right|''Still-life'', by Portuguese painter [[Josefa de Óbidos]], c.1679, [[Santarém, Portugal]], Municipal Library]]
{{Main|Baroque painting}}

A defining statement of what ''Baroque'' signifies in painting is provided by the series of paintings executed by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] for [[Marie de Medici]] at the [[Luxembourg Palace]] in Paris (now at the [[Louvre]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.students.sbc.edu/vandergriff04/mariedemedici.html Peter Paul Rubens ''The Life of Marie de' Medici''].&lt;/ref&gt; in which a Catholic painter satisfied a Catholic patron: Baroque-era conceptions of monarchy, iconography, handling of paint, and compositions as well as the depiction of space and movement. 

There were highly diverse strands of Italian baroque painting, from [[Caravaggio]] to [[Pietro da Cortona|Cortona]]; both approaching emotive dynamism with different styles. Another frequently cited work of Baroque art is [[Bernini]]'s ''[[Saint Theresa in Ecstasy]]'' for the Cornaro chapel in Saint Maria della Vittoria, which brings together architecture, sculpture, and theatre into one grand conceit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boglewood.com/cornaro/xteresa.html &quot;Cornaro Chapel&quot; at Bogelwood.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

The later Baroque style gradually gave way to a more decorative [[Rococo]], which, through contrast, further defines Baroque.

The intensity and immediacy of baroque art and its individualism and detail—observed in such things as the convincing rendering of cloth and skin textures—make it one of the most compelling periods of Western art.{{Weasel-inline|date=January 2011}}

A rather different art developed out of northern realist traditions in 17th century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], which had very little religious art, and little [[history painting]], instead playing a crucial part in developing secular genres such as [[still life]], [[genre painting]]s of everyday scenes, and [[landscape painting]].  While the Baroque nature of Rembrandt's art is clear, the label is less often used for [[Vermeer]] and many other Dutch artists.  [[Flemish Baroque painting]] shared a part in this trend, while also continuing to produce the traditional categories.

==Sculpture ==
{{Main|Baroque sculpture}}
In Baroque sculpture, groups of figures assumed new importance, and there was a dynamic movement and energy of human forms&amp;mdash; they spiraled around an empty central vortex, or reached outwards into the surrounding space. For the first time, Baroque sculpture often had multiple ideal viewing angles. The characteristic Baroque sculpture added extra-sculptural elements, for example, concealed lighting, or water [[fountains]]. [[Aleijadinho]] in Brazil was also one of the great names of baroque sculpture, and his master work is the set of statues of the ''Santuário de Bom Jesus de Matosinhos'' in [[Congonhas]]. The soapstone sculptures of old testament prophets around the terrace are considered amongst his finest work.

The architecture, sculpture and fountains of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] (1598&amp;ndash;1680) give highly charged characteristics of Baroque style. Bernini was undoubtedly the most important sculptor of the Baroque period. He approached [[Michelangelo Buonarroti|Michelangelo]] in his omnicompetence:  Bernini sculpted, worked as an architect, painted, wrote plays, and staged spectacles.  In the late 20th century Bernini was most valued for his sculpture, both for his virtuosity in carving marble and his ability to create figures that combine the physical and the spiritual.  He was also a fine sculptor of bust portraits in high demand among the powerful.

===Bernini's Cornaro chapel: the complete work of art===
A good example of Bernini's Baroque work is his ''[[Ecstasy of St Theresa|St. Theresa in Ecstasy]]'' (1645&amp;ndash;52), created for the Cornaro Chapel of the church of [[Santa Maria della Vittoria]], [[Rome]]. Bernini designed the entire chapel, a subsidiary space along the side of the church, for the Cornaro family.  

[[Image:Estasi di Santa Teresa.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Bernini]]'s ''[[Ecstasy of St Theresa|Ecstasy of St. Teresa]]''.]]
Saint Theresa, the focal point of the chapel, is a soft white marble statue surrounded by a polychromatic marble architectural framing. This structure works to conceal a window which lights the statue from above. In shallow relief, sculpted figure-groups of the Cornaro family inhabit in opera boxes along the two side walls of the chapel.  The setting places the viewer as a spectator in front of the statue with the Cornaro family leaning out of their box seats and craning forward to see the mystical ecstasy of the saint. 

St. [[Teresa of Ávila|Theresa]] is highly idealized and in an imaginary setting.  St. [[Theresa of Avila]], a popular saint of the [[Catholic Reformation]], wrote of her mystical experiences aimed at the nuns of her [[Carmelite Order]];  these writings had become popular reading among lay people interested in pursuing spirituality.  In her writings, she described the love of God as piercing her heart like a burning arrow.  Bernini literalizes this image by placing St. Theresa on a cloud while a Cupid figure holds a golden arrow (the arrow is made of metal) and smiles down at her.  The angelic figure is not preparing to plunge the arrow into her heart&amp;mdash; rather, he has withdrawn it. St. Theresa's face reflects not the anticipation of ecstasy, but her current fulfillment.   

This is widely considered the genius of Baroque although this mix of religious and erotic imagery was extremely offensive in the context of neoclassical restraint.  However, Bernini was a devout Catholic and was not attempting to satirize the experience of a [[celibacy|chaste]] nun. Rather, he aimed to portray  religious experience as an intensely physical one.  Theresa described her bodily reaction to spiritual enlightenment in a language of ecstasy used by many mystics, and Bernini's depiction is earnest.

The Cornaro family promotes itself discreetly in this chapel;  they are represented visually, but are placed on the sides of the chapel, witnessing the event from balconies.  As in an [[opera house]], the Cornaro have a privileged position in respect to the viewer, in their private reserve, closer to the saint; the viewer, however, has a better view from the front.  They attach their name to the chapel, but St. Theresa is the focus.  It is a private chapel in the sense that no one could say mass on the altar beneath the statue (in 17th century and probably through the 19th) without permission from the family, but the only thing that divides the viewer from the image is the altar rail.  The spectacle functions both as a demonstration of mysticism and as a piece of family pride.

{{Main|Baroque architecture}}

In Baroque architecture, new emphasis was placed on bold massing, [[colonnade]]s, [[dome]]s, light-and-shade (''[[chiaroscuro]]''), 'painterly' color effects, and the bold play of volume and void. In interiors, Baroque movement around and through a void informed monumental staircases that had no parallel in previous architecture. The other Baroque innovation in worldly interiors was the state apartment, a processional sequence of increasingly rich interiors that culminated in a presence chamber or throne room or a state bedroom. The sequence of monumental stairs followed by a state apartment was copied in smaller scale everywhere in aristocratic dwellings of any pretensions. 

Baroque architecture was taken up with enthusiasm in central [[Germany]] (see, e.g., [[Ludwigsburg Palace]] and [[Zwinger]] Dresden), [[Austria]] and [[Russia]] (see, e.g., [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]]). In [[England]] the culmination of Baroque architecture was embodied in work by Sir [[Christopher Wren]], Sir [[John Vanbrugh]] and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], from ca. 1660 to ca. 1725. Many examples of Baroque architecture and town planning are found in other European towns, and in Latin America. Town planning of this period featured radiating avenues intersecting in squares, which took cues from [[History of gardening|Baroque garden plans]]. In Sicily, Baroque developed new shapes and themes as in Noto, [[Ragusa, Italy|Ragusa]] and [[Acireale]] &quot;Basilica di San Sebastiano&quot;.

Another example of Baroque architecture is the Cathedral of Morelia Michoacan in Mexico.  Built in the 17th century by Vincenzo Barrochio, it is one of the many Baroque cathedrals in Mexico.

Francis Ching described Baroque architecture as &quot;a style of architecture originating in Italy in the early 17th century and variously prevalent in Europe and the New World for a century and a half, characterized by free and sculptural use of the classical orders and ornament, dynamic opposition and interpenetration of spaces, and the dramatic combined effects of architecture, sculpture, painting, and the decorative arts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Francis DK Ching, ''A Visual Dictionary of Architecture'', p.&amp;nbsp;133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre==
In theatre, the elaborate conceits, multiplicity of plot turns, and variety of situations characteristic of [[Mannerism]] ([[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's tragedies]], for instance) were superseded by [[opera]], which drew together all the arts into a unified whole.

Theatre evolved in the Baroque era and became a [[multimedia]] experience, starting with the actual architectural space. In fact, much of the technology used in current Broadway or commercial plays was invented and developed during this era. The stage could change from a romantic garden to the interior of a palace in a matter of seconds. The entire space became a framed selected area that only allows the users to see a specific action, hiding all the machinery and technology - mostly ropes and pulleys.

This technology affected the content of the narrated or performed pieces, practicing at its best the [[Deus ex Machina]] solution. Gods were finally able to come down - literally - from the heavens and rescue the hero in the most extreme and dangerous, even  absurd situations.

The term Theatrum Mundi - the world is a stage - was also created. The social and political realm in the real world is manipulated in exactly the same way the actor and the machines are presenting/limiting what is being presented on stage, hiding selectively all the machinery that makes the actions happen.

The films ''[[Vatel (film)|Vatel]]'', ''[[Farinelli (film)|Farinelli]]'', and the staging of [[Monteverdi]]'s ''Orpheus'' at the [[Gran Teatre del Liceu]] in Barcelona, give a good idea of the style of productions of the Baroque period. The American musician [[William Christie (musician)|William Christie]] and [[Les Arts Florissants (ensemble)|Les Arts Florissants]] have performed extensive research on all the French Baroque Opera, performing pieces from [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier|Charpentier]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], among others that are extremely faithful to the original 17th century creations.

==Literature and philosophy==
{{See|17th century in literature|17th century philosophy|Early Modern literature}}
Baroque actually expressed new values, which often are summarized in the use of [[metaphor]] and [[allegory]], widely found in Baroque literature, and in the research for the &quot;maraviglia&quot; (wonder, astonishment &amp;mdash; as in [[Marinism]]), the use of artifices.  The ''psychological pain of Man'' -- a theme disbanded after the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] and the [[Martin Luther|Lutheran]] revolutions in search of solid anchors, a proof of an &quot;ultimate human power&quot; -- was to be found in both the art and architecture of the Baroque period. Virtuosity was researched by artists (and the [[virtuoso]] became a common figure in any art) together with [[realism (arts)|realism]] and care for details (some talk of a typical &quot;intricacy&quot;).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The privilege given to external forms had to compensate and balance the lack of content that has been observed in many Baroque works: [[Giovan Battista Marino|Marino]]'s &quot;Maraviglia&quot;, for example, is practically made of the pure, mere form. Fantasy and imagination should be evoked in the spectator, in the reader, in the listener.  All was focused around the individual Man, as a straight relationship between the artist, or directly the art and its user, its client.  Art is then less distant from user, more directly approaching him, solving the cultural gap that used to keep art and user reciprocally far, by Maraviglia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  But the increased attention to the individual, also created in these schemes some important genres like the ''Romanzo'' ([[novel]]) and allowed popular or local forms of art, especially dialectal literature, to be put into evidence.  In [[Italy]] this movement toward the single individual (that some define a &quot;cultural descent&quot;, while others indicate it as a possible cause for the classical opposition to Baroque) caused [[Latin]] to be definitely replaced by Italian. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In [[Spain]], the baroque writers are framed in the [[Spanish Golden Age|''Siglo de Oro'']]. Naturalism and sharply critical points of view on Spanish society are common among such ''conceptista'' writers as [[Francisco de Quevedo|Quevedo]], while ''culterano'' authors emphasize the importance of form with complicated images and the use of hyperbaton. In [[Catalonia]] the baroque took hold as well in [[Catalan language]], with representatives including poets and dramaturgs such as [[Francesc Fontanella]] and [[Francesc Vicenç Garcia]] as well as the unique [[emblem|emblem book]] ''[[Atheneo de Grandesa]]'' by [[Josep Romaguera]].  In Colonial Spanish America some of the best-known baroque writers were [[Sor Juana]] and [[Bernardo de Balbuena]], in [[Mexico]], and [[Juan de Espinosa Medrano]] and [[Juan del Valle y Caviedes]], in [[Peru]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In the [[Portuguese Empire]] the most famous baroque writer of the time was [[António Vieira|Father António Vieira]], a [[Jesuit]] who lived in [[Brazil]] during the 18th century. Secondary writers are [[Gregório de Matos]] and [[Francisco Rodrigues Lobo]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In [[English literature]], the [[metaphysical poets]] represent a closely related movement; their poetry likewise sought unusual metaphors, which they then examined in often extensive detail.  Their verse also manifests a taste for paradox, and deliberately inventive and unusual turns of phrase.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Music==
{{Main|Baroque music}}

The term ''Baroque'' is also used to designate the style of music composed during a period that overlaps with that of Baroque art, but usually encompasses a slightly later period.

It is a still-debated question as to what extent Baroque music shares aesthetic principles with the visual and literary arts of the Baroque period. A fairly clear, shared element is a love of ornamentation, and it is perhaps significant that the role of ornament was greatly diminished in both music and architecture as the Baroque gave way to the Classical period. 

It should be noted that the application of the term &quot;Baroque&quot; to music is a relatively recent development. The first use of the word &quot;Baroque&quot; in music was only in 1919, by [[Curt Sachs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sachs |first1=Curt |authorlink1=Curt Sachs |title=Barockmusik |trans_title=Baroque Music |series=Jahrbuch der Musikbibliothek Peters |volume=26 |year=1919 |publisher=Edition Peters |location=Leipzig |language=Deutsch |pages=7–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was not until 1940 that it was first used in English (in an article  published by [[Manfred Bukofzer]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Palisca |first1=Claude V. |title=Baroque Music |edition=3rd |series=Prentice Hall History of Music |year=1991 |origyear=1961 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. |isbn=0130584967 |oclc=318382784 |page= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many musical forms were born in that era, like the [[concerto]] and [[sinfonia]]. Forms such as the [[sonata]], [[cantata]] and [[oratorio]] flourished. Also, [[opera]] was born out of the experimentation of the [[Florentine Camerata]], the creators of [[monody]], who attempted to recreate the theatrical arts of the Ancient Greeks. An important technique used in baroque music was the use of [[ground bass]], a repeated bass line. ''Dido's Lament'' by [[Henry Purcell]] is a famous example of this technique.

In [[abstract algebra]], a '''Boolean algebra''' or '''Boolean lattice''' is a [[complemented lattice|complemented]] [[distributive lattice|distributive]] [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. This type of [[algebraic structure]] captures essential properties of both [[Set (mathematics)|set]] operations and [[logic]] operations. A Boolean algebra can be seen as a generalization of a [[power set]] algebra or a [[field of sets]]. It is also a special case of [[De Morgan algebra]] and [[Kleene algebra]].

__TOC__

==History==  &lt;!-- [[Boolean algebra (history)]] redirects here --&gt;

The term &quot;Boolean algebra&quot; honors [[George Boole]] (1815–1864), a self-educated English mathematician. He introduced the [[algebraic system]] initially in a small pamphlet, ''The Mathematical Analysis of Logic'', published in 1847 in response to an ongoing public controversy between [[Augustus De Morgan]] and [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]], and later as a more substantial book, ''[[The Laws of Thought]]'', published in 1854. Boole's formulation differs from that described above in some important respects. For example, conjunction and disjunction in Boole were not a dual pair of operations. Boolean algebra emerged in the 1860s, in papers written by [[William Jevons]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. The first systematic presentation of Boolean algebra and [[distributive lattice]]s is owed to the 1890 ''Vorlesungen'' of [[Ernst Schröder]]. The first extensive treatment of Boolean algebra in English is [[A. N. Whitehead]]'s 1898 ''Universal Algebra''. Boolean algebra as an axiomatic algebraic structure in the modern axiomatic sense begins with a 1904 paper by [[Edward Vermilye Huntington]]. Boolean algebra came of age as serious mathematics with the work of [[Marshall Stone]] in the 1930s, and with [[Garrett Birkhoff]]'s 1940 ''Lattice Theory''. In the 1960s, [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]], [[Dana Scott]], and others found deep new results in [[mathematical logic]] and [[axiomatic set theory]] using offshoots of Boolean algebra, namely [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] and Boolean-valued models.

== Definition ==

A '''Boolean algebra''' is a [[Tuple|six-tuple]] consisting of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'', equipped with two [[binary operation]]s ∧ (called &quot;meet&quot; or &quot;and&quot;), ∨ (called &quot;join&quot; or &quot;or&quot;), a [[unary operation]] ¬ (called &quot;complement&quot; or &quot;not&quot;) and two elements 0 and 1 (sometimes denoted by the symbols ⊥ and ⊤, respectively), such that for all elements ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' of ''A'', the following [[axioms]] hold:

::{| cellpadding=5
|''a'' ∨ (''b'' ∨ ''c'') = (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∨ ''c''
|''a'' ∧ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∧ ''c''
| [[associativity]]
|-
|''a'' ∨ ''b'' = ''b'' ∨ ''a''
|''a'' ∧ ''b'' = ''b'' ∧ ''a''
| [[commutativity]]
|-
|''a'' ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''b'') = ''a''
|''a'' ∧ (''a'' ∨ ''b'') = ''a''
| [[absorption law|absorption]]
|-
|''a'' ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ (''a'' ∨ ''c'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|''a'' ∧ (''b'' ∨ ''c'') = (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''c'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| [[distributivity]]
|-
|''a'' ∨ ¬''a'' = 1
|''a'' ∧ ¬''a'' = 0
| [[complemented lattice|complements]]
|}

A Boolean algebra with only one element is called a '''trivial Boolean algebra''' or a '''degenerate Boolean algebra'''. (Some authors require 0 and 1 to be ''distinct'' elements in order to exclude this case.) 

It follows from the first three pairs of axioms above (associativity, commutativity and absorption) that
::''a'' = ''a'' ∧ ''b'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if and only if &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''a'' ∨ ''b'' = ''b''.
The relation ≤ defined by ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if and only if the above equivalent conditions hold, is a [[partial order]] with least element 0 and greatest element 1. The meet ''a'' ∧ ''b'' and the join ''a'' ∨ ''b'' of two elements coincide with their [[infimum]] and [[supremum]], respectively, with respect to ≤.

As in every lattice, the relations ∧ and ∨ satisfy the first three pairs of axioms above; the fourth pair is just distributivity. Since the complements in a distributive lattice are unique, to define the [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] ¬ it suffices to define ¬''a'' as the complement of ''a''.

The set of axioms is [[duality (order theory)|self-dual]] in the sense that if one exchanges ∨ with ∧ and 0 with 1 in an axiom, the result is again an axiom. Therefore by applying this operation to a Boolean algebra (or Boolean lattice), one obtains another Boolean algebra with the same elements; it is called its '''dual'''.

== Examples ==

* The simplest non-trivial Boolean algebra has only two elements, 0 and 1, and is defined by the rules:
{|
|-
| width=&quot;70&quot; |
|
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
! ∧ || 0 || 1
|-
! 0
| 0 || 0
|-
! 1
| 0 || 1
|}
|
| width=&quot;30&quot; |
|
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
! ∨ || 0 || 1
|-
! 0
| 0 || 1
|-
! 1
| 1 || 1
|}
|
| width=&quot;40&quot; |
|
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
! ''a'' || 0 || 1
|-
! ¬''a''
| 1 || 0
|}
|}

:* It has applications in [[logic]], interpreting 0 as ''false'', 1 as ''true'', ∧ as ''and'', ∨ as ''or'', and ¬ as ''not''. Expressions involving variables and the Boolean operations represent statement forms, and two such expressions can be shown to be equal using the above axioms if and only if the corresponding statement forms are [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]].

:* The two-element Boolean algebra is also used for circuit design in [[electrical engineering]]; here 0 and 1 represent the two different states of one [[bit]] in a [[digital circuit]], typically high and low [[voltage]]. Circuits are described by expressions containing variables, and two such expressions are equal for all values of the variables if and only if the corresponding circuits have the same input-output behavior. Furthermore, every possible input-output behavior can be modeled by a suitable Boolean expression.

:* The [[two-element Boolean algebra]] is also important in the general theory of Boolean algebras, because an equation involving several variables is generally true in all Boolean algebras if and only if it is true in the two-element Boolean algebra (which can be checked by a trivial [[brute force search|brute force]] algorithm for small numbers of variables). This can for example be used to show that the following laws (''Consensus theorems'') are generally valid in all Boolean algebras:

* The [[power set]] (set of all subsets) of any given nonempty set ''S'' forms a Boolean algebra with the two operations ∨ := ∪ (union) and ∧ := ∩ (intersection). The smallest element 0 is the [[empty set]] and the largest element 1 is the set ''S'' itself.

* The set of all subsets of ''S'' that are either finite or [[cofinite]] is a Boolean algebra.

* Starting with the [[propositional calculus]] with κ sentence symbols, form the [[Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra|Lindenbaum algebra]] (that is, the set of sentences in the propositional calculus modulo [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]).  This construction yields a Boolean algebra.  It is in fact the [[free Boolean algebra]] on κ generators.  A truth assignment in propositional calculus is then a Boolean algebra homomorphism from this algebra to {0,1}.

* Given any [[linearly ordered]] set ''L'' with a least element, the interval algebra is the smallest algebra of subsets of ''L'' containing all of the half-open intervals [''a'', ''b'') such that ''a'' is in ''L'' and ''b'' is either in ''L'' or equal to ∞.  Interval algebras are useful in the study of [[Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra]]s; every countable Boolean algebra is isomorphic to an interval algebra.

* For any [[natural number]] ''n'', the set of all positive [[divisor]]s of ''n'' forms a [[distributive lattice]] if we write ''a'' ≤ ''b'' for ''a'' | ''b''. This lattice is a Boolean algebra if and only if ''n'' is [[square-free integer|square-free]]. The smallest element 0 of this Boolean algebra is the natural number 1; the largest element 1 of this Boolean algebra is the natural number ''n''.

* Other examples of Boolean algebras arise from [[topology|topological spaces]]: if ''X'' is a topological space, then the collection of all subsets of ''X'' which are both open and closed forms a Boolean algebra with the operations ∨ := ∪ (union) and ∧ := ∩ (intersection).

* If ''R'' is an arbitrary [[mathematical ring|ring]] and we define the set of ''central idempotents'' by &lt;br&gt; ''A'' = { ''e'' ∈ ''R'' : ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e'', ''ex'' = ''xe'', ∀''x'' ∈ ''R'' } &lt;br&gt; then the set ''A'' becomes a Boolean algebra with the operations ''e'' ∨ ''f'' := ''e'' + ''f'' - ''ef'' and ''e'' ∧ ''f'' := ''ef''.

== Homomorphisms and isomorphisms ==
&lt;!-- &quot;Boolean homomorphism&quot; redirects here --&gt;

A ''[[homomorphism]]'' between two Boolean algebras ''A'' and ''B'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'' such that for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''A'':

: ''f''(''a'' ∨ ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') ∨ ''f''(''b''),
: ''f''(''a'' ∧ ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') ∧ ''f''(''b''),
: f(0) = 0,
: f(1) = 1.

It then follows that ''f''(¬''a'') = ¬''f''(''a'') for all ''a'' in ''A'' as well. The [[class (set theory)|class]] of all Boolean algebras, together with this notion of morphism, forms a [[full subcategory]] of the [[category theory|category]] of lattices.

== Boolean rings, ideals and filters ==
{{Main|Boolean ring}}
Every Boolean algebra (A, ∧, ∨) gives rise to a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] (''A'', +, ·) by defining ''a'' + ''b'' := (''a'' ∧ ¬''b'') ∨ (''b'' ∧ ¬''a'') (this operation is called [[symmetric difference]] in the case of sets and [[Truth table|XOR]] in the case of logic) and ''a'' · ''b'' := ''a'' ∧ ''b''. The zero element of this ring coincides with the 0 of the Boolean algebra; the multiplicative identity element of the ring is the 1 of the Boolean algebra. This ring has the property that ''a'' · ''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''A''; rings with this property are called [[Boolean ring]]s. 

Conversely, if a Boolean ring ''A'' is given, we can turn it into a Boolean algebra by defining ''x'' ∨ ''y'' := ''x'' + ''y'' + (''x'' · ''y'') and ''x'' ∧ ''y'' := ''x'' · ''y''. Since these two constructions are inverses of each other, we can say that every Boolean ring arises from a Boolean algebra, and vice versa. Furthermore, a map ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'' is a homomorphism of Boolean algebras if and only if it is a homomorphism of Boolean rings. The [[category theory|categories]] of Boolean rings and Boolean algebras are equivalent. 

An ''ideal'' of the Boolean algebra ''A'' is a subset ''I'' such that for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''I'' we have x ∨ y in ''I'' and for all ''a'' in ''A'' we have ''a'' ∧ ''x'' in ''I''. This notion of ideal coincides with the notion of [[ring ideal]] in the Boolean ring ''A''. An ideal ''I'' of ''A'' is called ''prime'' if ''I'' ≠ ''A'' and if ''a'' ∧ ''b'' in ''I'' always implies ''a'' in ''I'' or ''b'' in ''I''. An ideal ''I'' of ''A'' is called ''maximal'' if ''I'' ≠ ''A'' and if the only ideal properly containing ''I'' is ''A'' itself. These notions coincide with ring theoretic ones of [[prime ideal]] and [[maximal ideal]] in the Boolean ring ''A''.

The dual of an ''ideal'' is a ''filter''. A ''filter'' of the Boolean algebra ''A'' is a subset ''p'' such that for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''p'' we have ''x'' ∧ ''y'' in ''p'' and for all ''a'' in ''A'' we have ''a'' ∨ ''x'' in ''p''.

== Representations ==

It can be shown that every ''finite'' Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of all subsets of a finite set.  Therefore, the number of elements of every finite Boolean algebra is a [[power of two]]. 

[[Marshall H. Stone|Stone's]] celebrated ''[[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras|representation theorem for Boolean algebras]]'' states that ''every'' Boolean algebra ''A'' is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of all [[clopen set|clopen]] sets in some ([[compact space|compact]] [[totally disconnected]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]) topological space.

== Axiomatics ==
The first axiomatization of Boolean lattices/algebras in general was given by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in 1898.&lt;ref name=&quot;PadmanabhanRudeanu2008&quot;&gt;Padmanabhan, [http://books.google.com/books?id=JlXSlpmlSv4C&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 73]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, the American mathematician [[Edward Vermilye Huntington]] (1874–1952) set out the following elegant axiomatization for Boolean algebra.  It requires just one binary operation + and a [[unary functional symbol]] ''n'', to be read as 'complement', which satisfy the following laws:

# ''Commutativity'': ''x'' + ''y'' = ''y'' + ''x''.
# ''Associativity'': (''x'' + ''y'') + ''z'' = ''x'' + (''y'' + ''z'').
# ''Huntington equation'': ''n''(''n''(''x'') + ''y'') + ''n''(''n''(''x'') + ''n''(''y'')) = ''x''.

[[Herbert Robbins]] immediately asked: If the Huntington equation is replaced with its dual, to wit:

:4. ''Robbins Equation'': ''n''(''n''(''x'' + ''y'') + ''n''(''x'' + ''n''(''y''))) = ''x'',

do (1), (2), and (4) form a basis for Boolean algebra? Calling (1), (2), and (4) a ''Robbins algebra'', the question then becomes: Is every Robbins algebra a Boolean algebra? This question (which came to be known as the [[Robbins conjecture]]) remained open for decades, and became a favorite question of [[Alfred Tarski]] and his students.  

In 1996, [[William McCune]] at [[Argonne National Laboratory]], building on earlier work by Larry Wos, Steve Winker, and Bob Veroff, answered Robbins's question in the affirmative: Every Robbins algebra is a Boolean algebra. Crucial to McCune's proof was the [[automated reasoning program]] [[EQP]] he designed. For a simplification of McCune's proof, see Dahn (1998).

== Generalizations ==

Removing the requirement of existence of a unit from the axioms of Boolean algebra yields &quot;generalized Boolean algebras&quot;. Formally, a [[distributive lattice]] ''B'' is a generalized Boolean lattice, if it has a smallest element 0 and for any elements ''a'' and ''b'' in ''B'' such that ''a'' ≤ ''b'', there exists an element ''x'' such that a ∧ x = 0 and a ∨ x = b. Defining a ∖ b as the unique ''x'' such that (a ∧ b) ∨ x = a and (a ∧ b) ∧ x = 0, we say that the structure (B,∧,∨,∖,0) is a ''generalized Boolean algebra'', while (B,∨,0) is a ''generalized Boolean semilattice''. Generalized Boolean lattices are exactly the [[Ideal (order theory)|ideals]] of Boolean lattices.

A structure that satisfies all axioms for Boolean algebras except the two distributivity axioms is called an [[orthocomplemented lattice]]. Orthocomplemented lattices arise naturally in [[quantum logic]] as lattices of closed subspaces for separable [[Hilbert space]]s.

'''Banca d'Italia''' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for ''Bank of Italy'') is the [[central bank]] of [[Italy]] and part of the [[European System of Central Banks]]. It is located in Palazzo Koch, [[Rome|Roma]], [[via Nazionale (Rome)|via Nazionale]]. The bank's current governor is [[Mario Draghi]], who took the office on 16 January 2006.

==Functions==
After the charge of monetary and exchange rate policies was shifted in 1998 to the [[European Central Bank]], within the European institutional framework, the bank implements the decisions, issues euro banknotes and withdraws and destroys worn pieces.

The main function has thus become banking and financial supervision. The objective is to ensure the stability and efficiency of the system and compliance to rules and regulations; the bank pursues it through secondary legislation, controls and cooperation with governmental authorities.

Following reform in 2005, which was prompted by takeover scandals, the bank has lost exclusive antitrust authority in the credit sector, which is now shared with [[Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato|Italy's Antitrust Authority]].

Other functions include, market supervision, oversight of the payment system and provision of settlement services, State treasury service, Central Credit Register, economic analysis and institutional consultancy.

Bank of Italy [[Official gold reserves|gold reserves]] are 2,451.8 [[tonnes]] (2006).

==History==
The institution, also called '''Bankitalia''', was founded in 1893, from the fusion of the four major banks in Italy. Until 1928 it was directed by a ''General Manager'', while since then it is directed by a ''Governor''. The Governor is elected by the internal commission of managers, with a decree from the [[President of the Italian Republic]] for a term of 7 years.

===General Managers (1893–1928)===
*[[Giacomo Grillo]] (1893–1894)
*[[Giuseppe Marchiori]] (1894–1900)
*[[Bonaldo Stringher]] (1900–1928)

===Governors (1928 – present)===
*[[Bonaldo Stringher]] (1928–1930)
*[[Vincenzo Azzolini]] (1931–1944)
*[[Luigi Einaudi]] (1945–1948)
*[[Donato Menichella]] (1948–1960)
*[[Guido Carli]] (1960–1975)
*[[Paolo Baffi]] (1975–1979)
*[[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] (1979–1993)
*[[Antonio Fazio]] (1993–2005)
*[[Mario Draghi]] (2006 – present)

==Organization of the Bank of Italy==
===Governing Bodies===
The Bank's governing bodies are the [[Annual General Meeting|General Meeting of Shareholders]], the [[Board of Directors]], the Governor, the [[Director General]] and three Deputy Directors General; the last five constitute the Directorate. 

The general meeting takes place yearly and with the purpose of approving accounts and appointing the [[auditor]]s. The Board of Directors has administrative powers and is chaired by the governor (or by the Director General in his absence). Following reform in 2005, the governor lost exclusive responsibility regarding decisions of external relevance (i.e. banking and financial supervision), which has been transferred to the Directorate (by majority vote). The Director General is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the bank, and acts as governor when absent.

The [[Board of Auditors]] assesses the bank's administration and compliance with the law, regulations and the statute.

===Appointment===
The Directorate's [[term of office]] lasts six years and is renewable once. The appointment of the governor is the responsibility of the government, head of the Board of Directors, with the approval of the President of the Republic (formally a [[decree]] of the President). The Board of Directors is elected by the shareholders according to the bank [[statute]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Beachcomber''' was a [[pen name|''nom de plume'']] used by [[surrealism|surrealist]] humorous columnists [[D. B. Wyndham-Lewis]] and, chiefly, [[J. B. Morton]] as authors of the ''[[Daily Express]]'' column &quot;By the Way&quot; in the period 1919-1975. Other authors who used the name were Major John Bernard Arbuthnot [[MVO]], the column's founder, and [[William Hartston]], the current author of its revived form.

==&quot;By the Way&quot; in print==
&quot;By the Way&quot; was originally a column in the ''[[Globe (London newspaper)|Globe]]'', consisting of unsigned humorous pieces; [[P. G. Wodehouse]] was assistant editor of the column from August 1903 and editor from August 1904 to May 1909, during which time he was assisted by  [[Herbert Westbrook]].&lt;ref&gt;''P.G. Wodehouse: A Portrait of a Master'', David A. Jasen, Music Sales Group, 2002, ISBN 0825672759&lt;/ref&gt; After the ''Globe'''s closure, it was reestablished as a society news column in the ''Daily Express'' from 1917 onwards, initially written by social correspondent Major John Arbuthnot who invented the name &quot;Beachcomber&quot;.

After Arbuthnot was promoted to deputy editor, it was taken over by Wyndham-Lewis some time in 1919 who reinvented it as an outlet for his wit and humour. It was then passed to Morton during 1924 though it is likely there was a period when they overlapped. Morton wrote the column until 1975; it was revived in January 1996 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beachcomber lives again|date=5 January 1996|work=Daily Express|page=2|accessdate=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues today, written by [[William Hartston]], though the name &quot;By the Way&quot; has been dropped in favour of simply &quot;Beachcomber&quot;. The column is unsigned except by &quot;Beachcomber&quot; and it was not publicly known that Morton or Wyndham-Lewis wrote it until the 1930s. The name is mainly associated with Morton who has been credited as an influence by [[Spike Milligan]] amongst others. Morton introduced the recurring characters and continuing stories that were a major feature of the column during his 51-year run.

The format of the column was a random assortment of small paragraphs which were otherwise unconnected. These could be anything, such as:

* court reports, often involving Twelve Red-Bearded Dwarfs before Mr Justice Cocklecarrot.
* angry exchanges of letters between characters such as Florence McGurgle and her dissatisfied boarders.
* interruptions from &quot;Prodnose&quot;, representing the public, who would then be roundly cursed by the author and kicked out.
* installments of serials that could stop, restart from earlier, be abandoned altogether or change direction abruptly without warning.
* parodies of poetry or drama, particularly of the extremely &quot;literary&quot; type such as [[Ibsen]].
* news reports from around the country.
* or just anything that the author thought funny at the time.

Morton's other interest, [[France]], was occasionally represented by epic tales of his rambling walks through the French countryside. These were not intended as humour.

&quot;By the Way&quot; was popular with the readership, and of course, one of the reasons it lasted so long. Its style and randomness could be off-putting, however, and it is safe to say the humour could be something of an acquired taste.  Oddly, one of the column's greatest opponents was the ''Express'' newspaper's owner, [[Lord Beaverbrook]], who had to keep being assured the column was indeed funny. A prominent critic was [[George Orwell]] but &quot;By the Way&quot; was one of the few features kept continuously running in the often seriously reduced ''Daily Express'' throughout [[World War II]], when Morton's lampooning of [[Hitler]], including the British invention of [[Bracerot]] to make the Nazi's trousers fall down at inopportune moments, was regarded as valuable for morale.

The column appeared daily until 1965 when it was changed to weekly. It was cancelled in 1975 and revived as a daily piece in the early 1990s. It continues to the present day in much the same format, but is now entitled &quot;Beachcomber&quot;, not &quot;By the Way&quot;.

==Recurrent characters==

*Mr. Justice Cocklecarrot: well-meaning but ineffectual [[High Court judge]], plagued by litigation involving the '''twelve red-bearded dwarfs'''. Often appears in [[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]].
*Mrs. Justice Cocklecarrot: his wife.  Very silent, until she observes that &quot;Wivens has fallen down a manhole&quot;. An enquiry from the judge as to which Wivens that would be elicits the response &quot;E. D. Wivens&quot;. After a worrying interval she reveals that E. D. Wivens is a cat. His Lordship observes that [[cat]]s do not have initials. &quot;This one does&quot;, says she.
*Tinklebury Snapdriver and Honeygander Gooseboote: two [[Barrister|counsel]].  The elbow of one has a mysterious tendency to become jammed in the jaws of the other.
*Twelve red-bearded dwarfs, with a penchant for farcical [[litigation]]. Their names are Scorpion de Rooftrouser, Cleveland Zackhouse, Frums Gillygottle, Edeledel Edel, [[Churm Rincewind]], Sophus Barkayo-Tong, Amaninter Axling, Guttergorm Guttergormpton, Badly Oronparser, Listenis Youghaupt, Molonay Tubilderborst and Farjole Merrybody.
*Captain Foulenough: archetypal cad and gatecrasher who impersonates the upper class in order to wreck their social events.  Educated at '''Narkover''', a school specializing in [[card games|card-playing]], [[horse-racing]] and [[bribery]].
*Mountfalcon Foulenough: his [[prig]]gish nephew, who brings havoc to Narkover and &quot;makes virtue seem even more horrifying than usual&quot;.
*Vita Brevis: debutante frequently plagued by, but with a certain reluctant admiration for, Captain Foulenough.
*Dr. Smart-Allick: genteel, but ludicrous and [[criminal]], [[headmaster]] of Narkover.
*Miss Topsy Turvey: neighbouring [[headmistress]], courted by Smart-Allick.
*Dr. Strabismus (whom God preserve) of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]: eccentric [[scientist]] and [[inventor]].
*Lord Shortcake: absent-minded [[peer]] obsessed by his enormous collection of [[goldfish]].
*Mrs. McGurgle: [[seaside]] [[landlady]].  Fearsomely [[United Kingdom|British]], until she decides to reinvent her house as &quot;Hôtel McGurgle et de l'Univers&quot; to attract the [[tourist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;There is some inconsistency about her maiden name.  One [[correspondent]] calls her &quot;Florrie Palmer as was&quot;, but the [[narrator]] says that she was a Gurricle, from Crabhampton.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ministry of Bubbleblowing: possible [[ancestor]] of [[Monty Python]]'s [[The Ministry of Silly Walks|Ministry of Silly Walks]].
*Charlie Suet: disastrous [[civil servant]].
*Mimsie Slopcorner: his on-off girlfriend, an ill-informed and irritating social activist.
*The Filthistan Trio: Ashura, Kazbulah and Rizamughan, three [[Persian people|Persians]] from &quot;Thurralibad&quot;, two of whom play see-saw on a plank laid across the third.  They have a series of contretemps with British [[bureaucracy]] and the artistic [[The Establishment|establishment]], in which the trio generally represents the voice of reason.
*Dingi-Poos: the Tibetan Venus.  She obtains desirable commercial contracts by using her charms to hoodwink visiting British [[envoy]]s, principally Colonel Egham and Duncan Mince.
*Big White Carstairs: [[John Buchan|Buchanesque]] [[Empire builder]], with a tendency to mislay his [[white tie|dress trousers]].
*O. Thake: naive, accident-prone [[Old Etonian]] and man-about-town.
*Lady Cabstanleigh: [[upper class|Society]] [[hospitality|hostess]].
*Stultitia: her niece, a [[playwright]].
*Boubou Flaring: glamorous but vacuous actress.
*Emilia Rustiguzzi: voluminous (both in bulk and in decibels) opera singer.
*Tumbelova, Serge Trouserin, Chuckusafiva: ballet dancers.
*Colin Velvette: ballet impresario.
*&quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Footle: handsome, socially celebrated boxer (who can do everything except actually fight)
*The M'Babwa of M'Gonkawiwi: African chief, who occasions great administrative problems in connection with his invitation to the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]].
*The Clam of Chowdah: oriental potentate
*Mrs. Wretch: formerly the glamorous circus performer Miss Whackaway, now wife to Colonel Wretch and &quot;horrible welfare worker&quot;.
*Roland Milk: insipid poet (possible ancestor of [[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'s &quot;[[E. J. Thribb]]&quot;).
*Prodnose: humourless, reasonable oaf who interrupts Beachcomber's flights of fancy. (The name is journalistic slang for a sub-editor.)

==Other media==

The [[Will Hay]] film ''[[Boys Will Be Boys (film)|Boys Will Be Boys]]'' (1935) was set at Morton's [[Narkover]] school.

In 1969, Spike Milligan based a BBC television series named ''[[The World of Beachcomber]]'' on the columns. According to Milligan, the columns had been an influence on the comedic style of his radio series, ''[[The Goon Show]]''.  A small selection was issued on a 1971 [[LP (format)|LP]] and a 2-cassette set of the series' soundtrack was made available in the late 1990s.

In 1989, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast the first of three series based on Morton's work. This featured [[Richard Ingrams]], [[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]], [[Patricia Routledge]] and [[John Sessions]] from compilations prepared by [[Mike Barfield]].  Series 1 was also made available as a 2-cassette set.

==Influence on later writers==

The work of Beachcomber is in some ways parallel to that of [[Brian O'Nolan|Myles na gCopaleen]], and the influence of both writers is evident in the [[Michael Wharton|Peter Simple]] columns in the [[Daily Telegraph]].

References to Beachcomber are strongly pervasive in [[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]], and there is a possible, but more tenuous, line of descent from it, via [[the Goon Show]], to [[Monty Python]].

'''William Nelson Joy''' (born November 8, 1954), commonly known as '''Bill Joy''', is an American [[computer scientist]].  Joy co-founded [[Sun Microsystems]] in 1982 along with [[Vinod Khosla]], [[Scott McNealy]] and [[Andy Bechtolsheim]], and served as chief scientist at the company until 2003. He is widely known for having written the essay &quot;[[Why the future doesn't need us]]&quot;, where he expresses deep concerns over the development of modern technologies.

==Early career==

Joy was born in the Detroit suburb [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]] to William Joy, a school vice-principal and counselor, and Ruth Joy.  Joy received his B.S. in [[Electrical Engineering]] from the [[University of Michigan]] and his M.S. in [[Electrical Engineering and Computer Science|EECS]] from [[UC Berkeley]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://berkeley.edu/tour/students/famous_alumni2.html | title = UC Berkeley Online Tour: Famous Alumni | accessdate = 2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joy's [[PhD]] advisor was [[Bob Fabry]].

As a UC Berkeley graduate student, Joy worked for Fabry's Computer Systems Research Group [[CSRG]] in managing the BSD support and rollout where many claim he was largely responsible for managing the authorship of  [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] [[Unix|UNIX]], from which sprang many modern forms of UNIX, including [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], and [[OpenBSD]]. [[Apple Inc.]] has based much of the [[Mac OS X]] kernel and OS Services on the BSD technology.

Some of his most notable contributions were the [[vi]] editor, and [[C shell|csh]]. Joy's prowess as a computer programmer is legendary, with an oft-told anecdote that he wrote the [[vi]] editor in a weekend.  Joy denies this assertion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/09/11/bill_joys_greatest_gift/ Bill Joy's greatest gift to man – the vi editor, The Register]&lt;/ref&gt;  Joy's accomplishments have been sometimes exaggerated; [[Eric Schmidt]], CEO of [[Novell]] at the time, inaccurately reported during an interview in [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s documentary [[Nerds 2.0.1]] that Joy had personally rewritten the BSD kernel in a weekend.

According to a [[Salon.com]] article, during the early 1980s [[DARPA]] had contracted the company [[BBN Technologies|Bolt, Beranek and Newman]] (BBN) to add [[TCP/IP]] to Berkeley UNIX. Joy had been instructed to plug BBN's stack into Berkeley Unix, but he refused to do so, as he had a low opinion of BBN's TCP/IP. So, Joy wrote his own high-performance TCP/IP stack. According to [[John Gage]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;BBN had a big contract to implement TCP/IP, but their stuff didn't work, and grad student Joy's stuff worked. So they had this big meeting and this grad student in a T-shirt shows up, and they said, &quot;How did you do this?&quot; And Bill said, &quot;It's very simple&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; you read the protocol and write the code.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rob Gurwitz, who was working at BBN at the time, disputes this version of events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/fsp/2000/05/16/chapter_2_part_one/index.html?pn=3 BSD Unix: Power to the people, from the code - Salon.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sun==
In 1982, Joy co-founded [[Sun Microsystems]].

In 1986, Joy was awarded a [[Grace Murray Hopper Award]] by the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] for his work on the Berkeley UNIX Operating System.

At Sun Joy was an inspiration for the development of [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]], the [[SPARC]] microprocessors, the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]], [[Jini]] / [[JavaSpaces]] and [[JXTA]].

On September 9, 2003 Sun announced that Bill Joy was leaving the company and that he &quot;is taking time to consider his next move and has no definite plans&quot;.

==Post-Sun activities==
In 1999 Joy co-founded a venture capital firm, [[HighBAR Ventures]], with two Sun colleagues: [[Andreas Bechtolsheim]] and [[Roy Thiele-Sardiña]]. In January 2005 he was named a partner in venture capital firm [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]], where he has made investments in the green energy space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20005814-56.html Bill Joy on Green Tech, Sun's downfall, Microsoft's prospects (Q&amp;A) May 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; He has once said, &quot;My method is to look at something that seems like a good idea and assume it's true&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html Shirky: A Group Is Its Own Worst Enemy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology concerns==
In 2000 Joy gained notoriety with the publication of his article in ''[[Wired Magazine]]'', &quot;[[Why the future doesn't need us]]&quot;, in which he declared, in what some have described as a &quot;[[neo-Luddite]]&quot; position, that he was convinced that growing advances in [[genetic engineering]] and [[nanotechnology]] would bring [[existential risk|risks]] to humanity. He argued that intelligent [[robot]]s would replace humanity, at the very least in intellectual and social dominance, in the relatively near future. He advocates a position of relinquishment of GNR ([[Genetics]], [[Nanotechnology]], and [[Robotics]]) technologies, rather than going into an [[arms race]] between negative uses of the technology and defense against those negative uses (good nano-machines patrolling and defending against [[Grey Goo]] &quot;bad&quot; nano-machines). Many of his arguments have been addressed by Ray Kurzweil&lt;ref&gt;Ray Kurzweil, Are We Becoming an Endangered Species? Technology and Ethics in the Twenty First Century, November 20, 2001. http://www.kurzweilai.net/are-we-becoming-an-endangered-species-technology-and-ethics-in-the-twenty-first-century&lt;/ref&gt; and by others.&lt;ref&gt;Tihamer Toth-Fejel, Why the future needs Bill Joy, May 20, 2000, http://www.islandone.org/MMSG/BillJoyWhyCrit.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Catherine Borden, Letter to the Editor, The New York Times,
http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/20/magazine/l-the-money-issue-976857.html?src=pm&lt;/ref&gt;  

A bar-room discussion of these technologies with inventor and [[technological singularity|technological-singularity]] thinker [[Ray Kurzweil]] started to set his thinking along this path. He states in his essay that during the conversation, he became surprised that other serious scientists were considering such possibilities likely, and even more astounded at what he felt was a lack of considerations of the contingencies. After bringing the subject up with a few more acquaintances, he states that he was further alarmed by what he felt was the fact that although many people considered these futures possible or probable, that very few of them shared as serious a concern for the dangers as he seemed to. This concern led to his in-depth examination of the issue and the positions of others in the scientific community on it, and eventually, to his current activities regarding it.

Despite this he is a [[venture capitalist]], investing in GNR technology companies. He has also raised a specialty venture fund to address the dangers of pandemic diseases, such as H5N1 [[Avian influenza]] and biological weapons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Baseband.svg|right|300px|thumb|'''Baseband bandwidth'''. Here the bandwidth equals the upper frequency.]]

'''Bandwidth''' is the difference between the upper and lower frequencies in a contiguous set of frequencies.  It is typically measured in [[hertz]], and may sometimes refer to ''passband bandwidth'', sometimes to ''baseband bandwidth'', depending on context. '''Passband bandwidth''' is the difference between the upper and lower [[cutoff frequencies]] of, for example, an [[electronic filter]], a [[communication channel]], or a [[signal spectrum]]. In case of a [[low-pass filter]] or [[baseband]] signal, the bandwidth is equal to its upper cutoff frequency. The term '''baseband bandwidth''' always refers to the upper cutoff frequency, regardless of whether the filter is bandpass or low-pass.

Bandwidth in hertz is a central concept in many fields, including [[electronics]], [[information theory]], [[radio]] [[communication]]s, [[signal processing]], and [[spectroscopy]].
A key characteristic of bandwidth is that a band of a given width can carry the same amount of information, regardless of where that band is located in the [[frequency spectrum]] (assuming equivalent [[noise (electronics)| noise]] level). For example, a 5&amp;nbsp;kHz band can carry a telephone conversation whether that band is at baseband (as in your [[plain old telephone service|POTS]] telephone line) or  [[modulated]] to some higher ([[passband]]) frequency.

In [[computer networking]] and other digital fields, the term [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] often refers to a [[data rate]] measured in bits per second, for example network [[throughput]], sometimes denoted ''network bandwidth'', ''data bandwidth'' or ''digital bandwidth''. The reason is that according to [[Hartley's law]], the digital data rate limit (or [[channel capacity]]) of a physical communication link is proportional to its bandwidth in hertz, sometimes denoted '''radio frequency (RF) bandwidth''', '''signal bandwidth''', '''frequency bandwidth''', '''spectral bandwidth''' or '''analog bandwidth'''. For [[bandwidth (computing)|''bandwidth'' as a computing term]], less ambiguous terms are [[bit rate]], [[throughput]], [[maximum throughput]], [[goodput]] or channel capacity.

== Overview ==

Bandwidth is a key concept in many [[telephony]] applications. In [[radio]] communications, for example, bandwidth is the [[frequency range]] occupied by a [[modulated]] [[carrier wave]], whereas in [[optics]] it is the width of an individual [[spectral line]] or the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectral range]].

In many signal processing contexts, bandwidth is a valuable and limited resource.  For example, an [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio receiver's tuner spans a limited range of frequencies.  A government agency (such as the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in the United States) may apportion the regionally available bandwidth to licensed broadcasters so that their signals do not mutually interfere.  Each transmitter owns a slice of bandwidth, a valuable (if intangible) commodity.

For different applications there are different precise definitions. For example, one definition of bandwidth could be the range of frequencies beyond which the [[frequency function]] is zero. This would correspond to the mathematical notion of the [[support (mathematics)|support]] of a function (i.e., the total &quot;length&quot; of values for which the function is nonzero).  A less strict and more practically useful definition will refer to the frequencies where the frequency function is ''small''. Small could mean less than 3&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dB]] below (i.e., less than half of) the maximum value, or more rarely 10&amp;nbsp;dB below, or it could mean below a certain absolute value. As with any definition of the ''width'' of a function, many definitions are suitable for different purposes.

Bandwidth typically refers to baseband bandwidth in the context of for example [[sampling theorem]] and [[Nyquist rate|Nyquist sampling rate]], while it refers to passband bandwidth in the context of [[Nyquist rate|Nyquist symbol rate]] or [[Shannon-Hartley]] [[channel capacity]] for communication systems.

== X-dB bandwidth ==

[[Image:Bandwidth 2.svg|right|300px|thumb|A graph of a [[bandpass filter]]'s gain magnitude, illustrating the concept of −3 dB bandwidth at a gain of 0.707. The frequency axis of this symbolic diagram can be linear or [[logarithm]]ically scaled.]]

In some contexts, the signal bandwidth in [[hertz]] refers to the frequency range in which the signal's [[spectral density]] is nonzero or above a small threshold value.  That definition is used in calculations of the lowest sampling rate that will satisfy the [[sampling theorem]].  Because this range of non-zero amplitude may be very broad or infinite, this definition is typically relaxed so that the bandwidth is defined as the range of frequencies in which the signal's spectral density is above a certain threshold relative to its maximum. Most commonly, bandwidth refers to the [[3dB-point|3-dB bandwidth]], that is, the frequency range within which the [[spectral density]]  (in W/Hz or V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/Hz) is above half its maximum value (or the spectral amplitude, in V or V/Hz, is more than 70.7% of its maximum); that is, above &amp;minus;3&amp;nbsp;[[Decibel|dB]] relative to the peak.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word bandwidth applies to signals as described above, but it could also apply to ''systems'', for example [[Electronic filter|filter]]s or [[communication channel]]s. To say that a system has a certain bandwidth means that the system can process signals of that bandwidth, or that the system reduces the bandwidth of a white noise input to that bandwidth. 

The 3&amp;nbsp;dB bandwidth of an [[electronic filter]] or communication channel is the part of the system's frequency response that lies within 3 dB of the response at its peak, which in the passband filter case is typically at or near its [[center frequency]], and in the lowpass filter is near 0 hertz. If the maximum gain is 0 dB, the 3 dB gain is the range where the gain is more than -3dB, or the attenuation is less than + 3dB. This is also the range of frequencies where the amplitude gain is above 70.7% of the maximum amplitude gain, and above half the maximum power gain. This same &quot;half power gain&quot; convention is also used in [[spectral width]], and more generally for extent of functions as [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM). 

In [[electronic filter]] design, a filter specification may require that within the filter [[passband]], the gain is nominally 0 dB +/- a small number of dB , for example within the +/- 1 dB interval. In the [[stopband]](s), the required attenuation in dB is above a certain level, for example &gt;100 dB. In a [[transition band]] the gain is not specified. In this case, the filter bandwidth corresponds to the passband width, which in this example is the 1dB-bandwidth. If the filter shows amplitude ripple within the passband, the x dB point refers to the point where the gain is x dB below the nominal passband gain rather than x dB below the maximum gain.

A commonly used quantity is ''fractional bandwidth''.  This is the bandwidth of a device divided by its center frequency. E.g., a passband filter that has a bandwidth of 2&amp;nbsp;MHz with center frequency 10&amp;nbsp;MHz will have a fractional bandwidth of 2/10, or 20%. 

In communication systems, in calculations of the [[Shannon–Hartley]] [[channel capacity]], bandwidth refers to the 3dB-bandwidth. In calculations of the maximum [[symbol rate]], the [[Nyquist sampling rate]], and maximum bit rate according to the [[Shannon–Hartley#Hartley's_law|Hartley formula]], the bandwidth refers to the frequency range within which the gain is non-zero, or the gain in dB is below a very large value.  

The fact that in equivalent [[baseband]] models of communication systems, the signal spectrum consists of both negative and positive frequencies, can lead to confusion about bandwidth, since they are sometimes referred to only by the positive half, and one will occasionally see expressions such as &lt;math&gt;B = 2W&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is the total bandwidth (i.e. the maximum passband bandwidth of the carrier-modulated RF signal and the minimum passband bandwidth of the physical passband channel), and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the positive bandwidth (the baseband bandwidth of the equivalent channel model).  For instance, the baseband model of the signal would require a [[lowpass filter]] with cutoff frequency of at least &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; to stay intact, and the physical passband channel would require a passband filter of at least &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; to stay intact.

In signal processing and [[control theory]] the bandwidth is the frequency at which the [[closed-loop]] system gain drops 3&amp;nbsp;dB below peak.

In basic electric circuit theory, when studying band-pass and band-reject filters, the bandwidth represents the distance between the two points in the frequency domain where the signal is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt; of the maximum signal amplitude (half power).

== Antenna systems ==

In the field of [[antennas]], two different methods of expressing relative bandwidth are used for [[narrowband]] and [[wideband]] antennas.&lt;ref&gt; 
Stutzman, Warren L., and Gary A. Theiele. ''Antenna Theory and Design''. 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Ed. New York: 1998. ISBN 0-471-02590-9&lt;/ref&gt; For either, a set of criteria is established to define the extents of the bandwidth, such as [[input impedance]], [[pattern]], or [[Polarization (antenna)|polarization]].

''Percent bandwidth'', usually used for [[narrowband]] antennas, is used defined as &lt;math&gt;%B=\frac{f_H-f_L}{f_c}=2 \frac{f_H-f_L}{f_H+f_L} &lt;/math&gt;. The theoretical limit to fractional bandwidth is 200%, which occurs for &lt;math&gt;f_L = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

''Fractional bandwidth'', usually used for [[wideband]] antennas, is defined as &lt;math&gt;B = f_H/f_L,&lt;/math&gt; and is typically presented in the form of &lt;math&gt;B:1&lt;/math&gt;. Fractional bandwidth is used for wideband antennas because of the compression of the percent bandwidth that occurs mathematically with percent bandwidths above 100%, which corresponds to a fractional bandwidth of 3:1.

== Photonics ==

In [[photonics]], the term ''bandwidth'' occurs in a variety of meanings:
*the bandwidth of the output of some light source, e.g., an ASE source or a laser; the bandwidth of ultrashort optical pulses can be particularly large
*the width of the frequency range that can be transmitted by some element, e.g. an optical fiber
*the gain bandwidth of an optical amplifier
*the width of the range of some other phenomenon (e.g., a reflection, the phase matching of a nonlinear process, or some resonance)
*the maximum modulation frequency (or range of modulation frequencies) of an optical modulator
*the range of frequencies in which some measurement apparatus (e.g., a powermeter) can operate
*the [[data rate]] (e.g., in Gbit/s) achieved in an optical communication system; see [[bandwidth (computing)]].

A related concept is the [[spectral linewidth]] of the radiation emitted by excited atoms.

In [[Buddhism]], a '''bodhisattva''' ([[Sanskrit]]: बोधिसत्त्व ''bodhisattva''; [[Pali]]: बोधिसत्त ''bodhisatta'') is either an enlightened (''[[bodhi]]'') existence (''[[sattva]]'') or an enlightenment-being or, given the variant [[Sanskrit]] spelling ''satva'' rather than ''sattva,'' &quot;heroic-minded one (''[[satva]]'') for enlightenment (''[[bodhi]]'').&quot; Another term is &quot;wisdom-being.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coomaraswamy|first=Ananda |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Buddha and the Gospel of Buddhism |year=1975 |publisher=University Books, Inc. |location=Boston|pages=225 |lccn=64056434}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is anyone who, motivated by great compassion, has generated ''[[bodhicitta]]'', which is a spontaneous wish to attain [[Buddhahood]] for the benefit of all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Bodhisattva Vow'': A Practical Guide to Helping Others, page 1, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1995) ISBN 978-0-948006-50-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The bodhisattva is a popular subject in [[Buddhist art]].

==In Theravāda Buddhism==
The term &quot;''bodhisatta''&quot; ([[Pali|Pāli]] language) was used by [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] in the [[Pāli Canon|Pāli canon]] to refer to himself both in his previous lives and as a young man in his current life, prior to his enlightenment, in the period during which he was working towards his own [[moksha|liberation]]. When, during his discourses, he recounts his experiences as a young aspirant, he regularly uses the phrase &quot;When I was an unenlightened bodhisatta...&quot; The term therefore connotes a being who is &quot;bound for enlightenment&quot;, in other words, a person whose aim is to become fully enlightened. In the Pāli canon, the bodhisatta is also described as someone who is still subject to birth, illness, death, sorrow, defilement and delusion. Some of the previous lives of the Buddha as a bodhisattva are featured in the ''[[Jataka|Jātaka]]'' tales.

In the [[Pāli Canon|Pāli canon]], the bodhisatta Siddhartha Gotama is described thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.026.than.html|title=Ariyapariyesana Sutta|accessdate=2009-03-23|publisher=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|before my Awakening, when I was an unawakened bodhisatta, being subject myself to birth, sought what was likewise subject to birth. Being subject myself to aging... illness... death... sorrow... defilement, I sought [happiness in] what was likewise subject to illness... death... sorrow... defilement.|''Ariyapariyesana Sutta''}}

While [[Maitreya]] (Pāli: Metteya) is mentioned in the Pāli canon, he is not referred to as a bodhisattva, but simply the next fully awakened Buddha to come into existence long after the current teachings of the Buddha are lost.

In later [[Theravada|Theravāda]] literature, the term &quot;bodhisatta&quot; is used fairly frequently in the sense of someone on the path to [[moksha|liberation]]. The later tradition of commentary also recognizes the existence of two additional types of bodhisattas: the ''paccekabodhisatta'' who will attain [[Pratyekabuddha|Paccekabuddhahood]], and the ''savakabodhisatta'' who will attain enlightenment as a disciple of a Buddha. According to the Theravāda teacher [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] the bodhisattva path was not taught by Buddha [http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha335.htm].

Theravadin bhikku and scholar [[Walpola Rahula]] (Sri Rahula Maha Thera) has stated that the bodhisattva ideal has traditionally been held to be higher than the state of a ''śrāvaka'' not only in Mahāyāna, but also in Theravāda Buddhism. He also quotes an inscription from the 10th Century king of Sri Lanka, [[List_of_Sri_Lankan_monarchs#House_of_Lambakanna_II_.28691.E2.80.931017.29|Mahinda IV]] (956-972 CE) who had the words inscribed &quot;none but the bodhisattvas would become kings of Sri Lanka&quot;, among other examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha126.htm|title=Bodhisattva Ideal in Buddhism|accessdate=2010-04-18|publisher=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There is a wide-spread belief, particularly in the West, that the ideal of the Theravada, which they conveniently identify with Hinayana, is to become an Arahant while that of the Mahayana is to become a Bodhisattva and finally to attain the state of a Buddha. It must be categorically stated that this is incorrect. This idea was spread by some early Orientalists at a time when Buddhist studies were beginning in the West, and the others who followed them accepted it without taking the trouble to go into the problem by examining the texts and living traditions in Buddhist countries. But the fact is that both the Theravada and the Mahayana unanimously accept the Bodhisattva ideal as the highest.|Walpola Rahula, ''Bodhisattva Ideal in Buddhism''}}

==In Mahāyāna Buddhism==
===Bodhisattva ideal===
[[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism is based principally upon the path of a bodhisattva. 
According to Jan Nattier, the term ''Mahāyāna'' (&quot;Great Vehicle&quot;) was originally even an honorary synonym for ''Bodhisattvayāna'', or the &quot;Bodhisattva Vehicle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 174&quot;&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; The ''{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra}}'' contains an simple and brief definition for the term ''bodhisattva'', which is also the earliest known Mahāyāna definition.&lt;ref&gt;Mall, Linnart. ''Studies in the Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita and Other Essays.'' Motilal Banarsidass. 2005. pp. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa, Akira. ''A history of Indian Buddhism: from Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna.'' Motilal Banarsidass. 2007. p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is given as the following.&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward. ''The Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines and its Verse Summary.'' Grey Fox Press. 2001. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|&quot;Because he has enlightenment as his aim, a bodhisattva-mahāsattva is so called.&quot;}}

Mahāyāna Buddhism encourages everyone to become bodhisattvas and to take the [[bodhisattva vows]]. With these vows, one makes the promise to work for the complete enlightenment of all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] by practicing the six perfections.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bodhisattva Vow: A Practical Guide to Helping Others'', pages 4-12, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1995) ISBN 978-0-948006-50-0&lt;/ref&gt; Indelibly entwined with the bodhisattva vow is [[parinamana|merit transference]] (''pariṇāmanā'').

In Mahāyāna Buddhism life in this world is compared to people living in a house that is on fire. People take this world as reality pursuing worldly projects and pleasures without realising that the house is on fire and will soon burn down (due to the inevitability of death). A bodhisattva is one who has a determination to free sentient beings from [[samsara]] and its cycle of death, rebirth and suffering. This type of mind is known as the [[bodhicitta|mind of awakening]] (''bodhicitta''). Bodhisattvas take [[bodhisattva vows]] in order to progress on the spiritual path towards [[buddhahood]].

There are a variety of different conceptions of the nature of a bodhisattva in Mahāyāna. According to some Mahāyāna sources a bodhisattva is someone on the path to full Buddhahood. Others speak of bodhisattvas renouncing Buddhahood. According to the ''Kun-bzang bla-ma'i zhal-lung'', a bodhisattva  can choose any of three paths to help sentient beings in the process of achieving buddhahood. They are: 
# king-like bodhisattva - one who aspires to become buddha as soon as possible and then help sentient beings in full fledge;
# boatman-like bodhisattva - one who aspires to achieve buddhahood along with other sentient beings and
# shepherd-like bodhisattva - one who aspires to delay buddhahood until all other sentient beings achieve buddhahood. Bodhisattvas like [[Avalokiteshvara|Avalokiteśvara]] and [[Shantideva|Śāntideva]] are believed to fall in this category.

According to the doctrine of some Tibetan schools (like Theravāda but for different reasons), only the first of these is recognized.  It is held that Buddhas remain in the world, able to help others, so there is no point in delay. [[Kelsang Gyatso|Geshe Kelsang Gyatso]] notes:&lt;ref&gt;Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, ''Joyful Path of Good Fortune: the Complete Buddhist Path to Enlightenment,'' p. 422&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In reality, the second two types of bodhicitta are wishes that are impossible to fulfill because it is only possible to lead others to enlightenment once we have attained enlightenment ourself. Therefore, only king-like bodhicitta is actual bodhicitta. Je Tsongkhapa says that although the other Bodhisattvas wish for that which is impossible, their attitude is sublime and unmistaken.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Nyingma]] school, however, holds that the lowest level is the way of the king, who primarily seeks his own benefit but who recognizes that his benefit depends crucially on that of his kingdom and his subjects. The middle level is the path of the boatman, who ferries his passengers across the river and simultaneously, of course, ferries himself as well. The highest level is that of the shepherd, who makes sure that all his sheep arrive safely ahead of him and places their welfare above his own.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrul Rinpoche]],  ''Words of My Perfect Teacher,&quot; page 218, &quot;The king's way, called 'arousing bodhicitta with the great wish,' is the least courageous of the three. The boatman's way, called 'arousing bodhicitta with sacred wisdom,' is more courageous. It is said that Lord Maitreya aroused bodhicitta in this way. The shepherd's way, called 'the arousing of bodhicitta beyond compare,' is the most courageous of all. It is said to be the way Lord Mañjuśrĩ aroused bodhicitta.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ten grounds===

According to many traditions within Mahāyāna Buddhism, on the way to becoming a Buddha, a bodhisattva proceeds through ten, or sometimes fourteen, grounds or ''[[Bhumi (Buddhism)|bhūmis]].'' Below is the list of the ten ''bhūmis'' and their descriptions according to the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]'' and ''The Jewel Ornament of Liberation,'' a treatise by [[Gampopa]], an influential teacher of the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] [[Kagyu]] school. (Other schools give slightly variant descriptions.)

Before a bodhisattva arrives at the first ground, he or she first must travel the first two of the five paths: 
#the path of accumulation
#the path of preparation

The ten grounds of the bodhisattva then can be grouped into the next three paths
#''bhūmi'' 1 the path of insight
#''bhūmis'' 2-7 the path of meditation
#''bhūmis'' 8-10 the path of no more learning

The chapter of ten grounds in the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]'' refers to 52 stages. The 10 grounds are:

#'''Great Joy:''' It is said that being close to enlightenment and seeing the benefit for all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]], one achieves great joy, hence the name. In this ''bhūmi'' the bodhisattvas practice all [[paramita|perfections]] (''pāramitās''), but especially emphasizing [[dana (Buddhism)|generosity]] (''dāna'').
#'''Stainless:''' In accomplishing the second ''bhūmi'', the bodhisattva is free from the stains of immorality, therefore, this ''bhūmi'' is named &quot;stainless&quot;. The emphasized perfection is [[śila|moral discipline]] (''śīla'').
#'''Luminous:''' The third ''bhūmi'' is named &quot;luminous&quot;, because, for a bodhisattva who accomplishes this ''bhūmi'', the light of Dharma is said to radiate for others from the bodhisattva. The emphasized perfection is [[kṣanti|patience]] (''{{IAST|kṣānti}}'').
#'''Radiant:''' This ''bhūmi'' is called &quot;radiant&quot;, because it is said to be like a radiating light that fully burns that which opposes enlightenment. The emphasized perfection is [[vīrya|vigor]] (''vīrya'').
#'''Very difficult to train:''' Bodhisattvas who attain this ''bhūmi'' strive to help sentient beings attain maturity, and do not become emotionally involved when such beings respond negatively, both of which are difficult to do. The emphasized perfection is [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|meditative concentration]] (''dhyāna'').
#'''Obviously Transcendent:''' By depending on the perfection of wisdom, [the bodhisattva] does not abide in either ''[[saṃsāra|{{IAST|saṃsāra}}]]'' or ''[[nirvāṇa|{{IAST|nirvāṇa}}]]'', so this state is &quot;obviously transcendent&quot;.  The emphasized perfection is [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]] (''prajñā'').
#'''Gone afar:''' Particular emphasis is on the perfection of [[upaya|skilful means]] (''upāya''), to help others.
#'''Immovable:''' The emphasized virtue is aspiration. This, the &quot;immovable&quot; ''bhūmi'', is the ''bhūmi'' at which one becomes able to choose his place of rebirth.
#'''Good Discriminating Wisdom:''' The emphasized virtue is power.
#'''Cloud of Dharma:''' The emphasized virtue is the practice of primordial wisdom.

After the ten ''bhūmis'', according to Mahāyāna Buddhism, one attains complete enlightenment and becomes a Buddha.

With the 52 stages, the ''[[Shurangama Sutra|Śūraṅgama Sūtra]]'' in East Asia recognizes 57 stages. With the 10 grounds, various [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] schools recognize 3–10 additional grounds,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jingangsi.com/wencui/yizuo8.htm 大圆满隆钦宁提派前行念诵文编一遍智妙道]&lt;/ref&gt; mostly 6 more grounds with variant descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chandao.com/zangchuanfojiao/35/43381.htm 大圆满心性休息颂]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://akanistha.blogspot.com/2009/08/blog-post_4818.html 吉祥鄔金密嚴寺: 八地在般若乘和金剛乘的分別]&lt;/ref&gt;

A bodhisattva above the 7th ground is called a ''[[:fr:Mahâsattva|mahāsattva]]''. Some bodhisattvas such as [[Samantabhadra]] are also said to have already attained buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wisdom.buddhistdoor.com/alankwan/2009/09/13/459-因地菩薩和果地菩薩/ 459 因地菩薩和果地菩薩]&lt;/ref&gt;

===School doctrines===

Some sutras said a beginner would take 3–22 countless eons (''[[asaṃkhyeya|mahāsaṃkhyeya]] [[kalpa]]s'') to become a buddha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinawts.com/list/budedu1/082718255.htm 三大阿僧祇劫]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aaa.org.tw/Chen_voice/a_2008_11_25.pdf 成佛的目的是到每一個世界去度眾生.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hwayue.org.tw/lama/question4_08.htm 即身成就與三大阿僧祇劫之修行]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pure Land Buddhism]] suggests buddhists go to the [[pure land]]s to practice. [[Tiantai]], [[Huayan school|Huayan]], [[Zen]] and [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] schools say they teach ways to attain buddhahood within one karmic cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bukon.idv.tw/mantra/b11.htm 顯教與密教]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yinshun.org/Enlightenment/1997/1997oct/1999oct1.htm 「無諍之辯」導讀]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various traditions within Buddhism believe in specific bodhisattvas. Some bodhisattvas appear across traditions, but due to language barriers may be seen as separate entities. For example, [[Tibetan Buddhists]] believe in various forms of [[Chenrezig]], who is [[Avalokitesvara|Avalokiteśvara]] in Sanskrit, [[Guanyin]] (Kwan-yin or Kuan-yin) in China and Korea, Quan Am in Vietnam, and [[Kannon]] (formerly spelled and pronounced: Kwannon) in Japan. Followers of Tibetan Buddhism consider the [[Dalai Lamas]] and the [[Karmapas]] to be an emanation of Chenrezig, the Bodhisattva of Compassion.
 
[[Ksitigarbha|Kṣitigarbha]] is another popular bodhisattva in Japan and China. He is known for aiding those who are lost. His greatest compassionate vow is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If I do not go to the hell to help the suffering beings there, who else will go? ... if the hells are not empty I will not become a Buddha. Only when all living beings have been saved, will I attain Bodhi.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The place of a bodhisattva's earthly deeds, such as the achievement of [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] or the acts of [[dharma]], is known as a ''[[bodhimanda]]'', and may be a site of [[pilgrimage]]. Many temples and monasteries are famous as ''bodhimandas''; for instance, the island of [[Putuoshan]], located off the coast of [[Ningbo]], is venerated by Chinese Buddhists as the ''bodhimanda'' of [[Avalokitesvara|Avalokiteśvara]]. Perhaps the most famous ''bodhimanda'' of all is the [[bodhi tree]] under which [[Shakyamuni|Śākyamuṇi]] achieved buddhahood.

{{For|an earlier house owned by the Dukes of Buckingham and also called Buckingham Palace|Macclesfield Castle}}
[[File:Buckingham Palace, London - April 2009.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Buckingham Palace. This is the principal [[Facade|façade]], the East Front; originally constructed by [[Edward Blore]] and completed in 1850. It acquired its present appearance following a remodelling, in 1913, by Sir [[Aston Webb]].]]
[[File:Dronning victoria.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], the first monarch to reside at Buckingham Palace, moved into the newly completed palace upon her accession in 1837.]]

'''Buckingham Palace''' is the London home and primary residence of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].&lt;ref&gt; By tradition, the British Royal Court is still officially resident at [[St. James's Palace]] which means that, while foreign ambassadors assuming their new position are received by the British sovereign at Buckingham Palace, they are in fact accredited to the &quot;Court of St. James's Palace&quot;. This anomaly continues for the sake of tradition as Buckingham Palace is to all intents and purposes the official residence. See [http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page589.asp History of St James's Palace] (Royal website).&lt;/ref&gt; Located in the [[City of Westminster]], the [[palace]] is a setting for state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focus for the British people at times of national rejoicing and crisis.

Originally known as '''Buckingham House''', the building which forms the core of today's palace was a large [[townhouse]] built for the [[John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|Duke of Buckingham]] in 1705 on a site which had been in private ownership for at least 150 years.  It was subsequently acquired by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in 1761&lt;ref name=&quot;rob14&quot;&gt;Robinson, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; as a private residence for [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]], and known as &quot;The Queen's House&quot;. During the 19th century it was enlarged, principally by architects [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and [[Edward Blore]], forming three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace finally became the official royal palace of the British monarch on the accession of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1837. The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the East front which contains the well-known balcony on which the Royal Family traditionally congregate to greet crowds outside. However, the palace chapel was destroyed by a German bomb in World War II; the [[Queen's Gallery]] was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the [[Royal Collection]].

The original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which still survive, included widespread use of brightly coloured [[scagliola]] and blue and pink [[Lapis lazuli|lapis]], on the advice of Sir Charles Long. [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] oversaw a partial redecoration in a ''[[Belle Époque]]'' cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese [[Chinoiserie|regency]] style with furniture and fittings brought from the [[Royal Pavilion]] at [[Brighton]] and from [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]]. The [[Buckingham Palace Garden]] is the largest private garden in London.

The state rooms, used for official and state entertaining, are open to the public each year for most of August and September, as part of the Palace's Summer Opening. The palace is sometimes colloquially referred to as [[Buck House]].

==History==
[[File:Buckingham House 1710.jpeg|thumb|right|350px|Buckingham House, c.1710, was designed by [[William Winde]] for the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby.&lt;!--note - &quot;Normanby&quot; is correct spelling, do not change please --&gt; This façade evolved into today's Grand Entrance on the west (inner) side of the quadrangle, with the Green Drawing Room above.]]

===The site===
In the [[Middle Ages]], Buckingham Palace's site formed part of the Manor of Ebury (also called Eia). The marshy ground was watered by the river [[Tyburn (stream)|Tyburn]], which still flows below the courtyard and south wing of the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Goring, P.15&lt;/ref&gt; Where the river was fordable (at Cow Ford), the village of Eye Cross grew. Ownership of the site changed hands many times; owners included [[Edward the Confessor]] and his [[queen consort]] [[Edith of Wessex]] in late Saxon times, and, after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], [[William the Conqueror]]. William gave the site to [[Geoffrey de Mandeville (11th century)|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], who bequeathed it to the monks of [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;The topography of the site and its ownership are dealt with in Wright, chapters 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1531, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] acquired the Hospital of St James (later [[St. James's Palace]])&lt;ref&gt;Goring, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Eton College]], and in 1536 he took the Manor of Ebury from Westminster Abbey.&lt;ref&gt;Goring, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; These transfers brought the site of Buckingham Palace back into royal hands for the first time since William the Conqueror had given it away almost 500 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41820 The Acquisition of the Estate]'', ''[[Survey of London]]'': volume 39: The Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair, Part 1 (General History) (1977), pp. 1–5. Date accessed: 3 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Various owners leased it from royal landlords and the [[Fee simple|freehold]] was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th century. By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay, and the area was mostly wasteland.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 76–8&lt;/ref&gt; Needing money, [[James I of England|James I]] sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a {{convert|4|acre|m2|adj=on}} mulberry garden for the production of silk. (This is at the northwest corner of today's palace.)&lt;ref&gt;Goring, pp. 31&amp;36&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clement Walker]] in ''Anarchia Anglicana'' (1649) refers to &quot;new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S. James's&quot;; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. Eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon Sir [[Hugh Audley]] by the great heiress Mary Davies.&lt;ref&gt;Audley and Davies were key figures in the development of Ebury Manor and also the Grosvenor Estate (see [[Duke of Westminster|Dukes of Westminster]]), which still exists today. (They are remembered in the streetnames North Audley Street, South Audley Street, and Davies Street, all in [[Mayfair]].)&lt;/ref&gt;

===First houses on the site===
====Goring House====
Possibly the first house erected within the site was that of a Sir William Blake, around 1624.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The next owner was [[George Goring, 1st Earl of Norwich|Lord Goring]], who from 1633 extended Blake's house and developed much of today's garden, then known as Goring Great Garden.&lt;ref&gt;Goring, Chapter V&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, p.21&quot;&gt;Harris, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; He did not, however, manage to obtain freehold interest in the mulberry garden. Unbeknown to Goring, in 1640 the document &quot;failed to pass the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] before [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] fled London, which it needed to do for [[Capital punishment|legal execution]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; (It was this critical omission that helped the British royal family regain the freehold under [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]].)&lt;ref&gt;Goring, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arlington House====
The improvident Goring defaulted on his rents;&lt;ref&gt;Goring, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington]] obtained the mansion and was occupying it, now known as Goring House, when it burned down in 1674.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, p.21&quot; /&gt; Arlington House rose on the site—the southern wing of today's palace—the next year,&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, p.21&quot; /&gt; and its freehold was bought in 1702.

====Buckingham House====
The house which forms the architectural core of the present palace was built for the first [[John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|Duke of Buckingham and Normanby]]&lt;!--note - &quot;Normanby&quot; is correct spelling, do not change please --&gt; in 1703 to the design of [[William Winde]]. The style chosen was of a large, three-floored central block with two smaller flanking service wings.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Buckingham House was eventually sold by Buckingham's descendant, Sir Charles Sheffield, in 1761&lt;ref name=&quot;rob14&quot; /&gt; to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] for [[Pound (currency)|£]]21,000&lt;ref&gt;Nash, p. 18, although the purchase price is given by Wright p. 142 as £28,000&lt;/ref&gt; (£{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|21000|1761|2011|r=-4}}}} as of 2011).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}

Like his grandfather, George II, George III refused to sell the mulberry garden interest, so that Sheffield had been unable to purchase the full freehold of the site.  When Sheffield sold Buckingham House it came into the hands of the Royal Family.

[[File:Buckingham palace 1897.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Buckingham Palace and Gardens in 1897.]]

===From Queen's House to palace===
The house was originally intended as a private retreat, and in particular for [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]], and was known as The Queen's House&lt;ref&gt;In 1775, an Act of Parliament settled the property on Queen Charlotte, in exchange for her rights to [[Somerset House]] (see ''Old and New London'' (below)&lt;/ref&gt;—14 of their 15 children were born there. [[St. James's Palace]] remained the official and ceremonial royal residence.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45183 Westminster: Buckingham Palace]'', ''Old and New London'': Volume 4 (1878), pp. 61–74. Date accessed: 3 February 2009. The tradition persists of foreign [[ambassador]]s being formally accredited to &quot;the [[Court of St. James's]]&quot;, even though it is at Buckingham Palace that they present their credentials and staff to the Queen upon their appointment.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remodelling of the structure began in 1762.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; After his accession to the throne in 1820, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pp.30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Some furnishings were transferred from [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]], and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The external facade was designed in the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew exponentially and by 1829, the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] hired [[Edward Blore]] to finish the work.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page568.asp |title=The Royal Residences &gt; Buckingham Palace &gt; History|publisher=www.royal.gov.uk|accessdate=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one stage, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament, after the destruction of the [[Palace of Westminster|existing namesake]] by fire in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ziegler|first=Phillip|title=King William IV|publisher=Collins|year=1971|page=280|isbn=0-00-211934-X.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home of the monarch==

[[File:Buckingham Palace engraved by J.Woods after Hablot Browne &amp; R.Garland publ 1837 edited.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The palace c. 1837, depicting the [[Marble Arch]], which served as the ceremonial entrance to the Palace [[precinct]]s. It was moved to make way for the east wing, built in 1847, which enclosed the quadrangle.]]

Buckingham Palace finally became the principal royal residence in 1837, on the accession of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page555.asp|title=The Royal Residences &gt; Buckingham Palace|publisher=www.royal.gov.uk|accessdate=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was the first monarch to reside there as her predecessor William IV had died before its completion.&lt;ref&gt;Hedley, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[state room]]s were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence.&lt;ref name=&quot;ws249&quot;&gt;Woodham-Smith, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when a decision was taken to install gas lamps, there was a serious worry about the build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that the staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty.&lt;ref name=&quot;ws249&quot; /&gt; Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], concerned himself with a reorganisation of the [[Royal Household|household]] offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace. The problems were all rectified by the close of 1840. However, the builders were to return within the decade.

By 1847, the couple had found the palace too small for court life and their growing family,&lt;ref&gt;Harris, de Bellaigue &amp; Miller, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently the new wing, designed by [[Edward Blore]], was built by [[Thomas Cubitt]],&lt;ref&gt;''Holland &amp; Hannen and Cubitts – The Inception and Development of a Great Building Firm'', published 1920, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; enclosing the central quadrangle. The large East Front facing [[The Mall, London|The Mall]] is today the &quot;public face&quot; of Buckingham Palace and contains the balcony from which the [[Royal family|Royal Family]] acknowledge the crowds on momentous occasions and annually after [[Trooping the Colour]]. The [[ballroom]] wing and a further suite of state rooms were also built in this period, designed by Nash's student [[James Pennethorne|Sir James Pennethorne]].

Before Prince Albert's death, the palace was frequently the scene of musical entertainments,&lt;ref&gt;Hedley, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and the greatest contemporary musicians entertained at Buckingham Palace. The composer [[Felix Mendelssohn]] is known to have played there on three occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Healey, pp.137–138&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Strauss II]] and his orchestra played there when in England.&lt;ref&gt;Healey, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss's &quot;Alice Polka&quot; was first performed at the palace in 1849 in honour of the Queen's daughter, [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Alice]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen's Indian Mail, and Register of British and Foreign India, China, and all parts of the East. 1850, Vol. VIII. [http://books.google.ca/books?id=axgYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=%22Alice+polka%22&amp;num=30&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA117,M1 Google Book link]&lt;/ref&gt; Under Victoria, Buckingham Palace was frequently the scene of lavish costume balls, in addition to the routine royal ceremonies, investitures and presentations.

Widowed in 1861, the grief-stricken Queen withdrew from public life and left Buckingham Palace to live at [[Windsor Castle]], [[Balmoral Castle]], and [[Osborne House]]. For many years the palace was seldom used, and even neglected. Eventually, public opinion forced her to return to London, though even then she preferred to live elsewhere whenever possible. Court functions were still held at Windsor Castle rather than at the palace, presided over by the sombre Queen habitually dressed in mourning black while Buckingham Palace remained shuttered for most of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;rob9&quot;&gt;Robinson, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interior===
[[File:Plan of Buckingham palace.gif|thumb|350px|''[[Piano nobile]]'' of Buckingham Palace. A:&amp;nbsp;State Dining Room; B:&amp;nbsp;Blue Drawing Room; C:&amp;nbsp;Music Room; D:&amp;nbsp;White Drawing Room; E:&amp;nbsp;Royal Closet; F:&amp;nbsp;Throne Room; G:&amp;nbsp;Green Drawing Room; H:&amp;nbsp;Cross Gallery; J:&amp;nbsp;Ball Room; K:&amp;nbsp;East Gallery; L:&amp;nbsp;Yellow Drawing Room; M:&amp;nbsp;Centre/Balcony Room; N:&amp;nbsp;Chinese Luncheon Room; O:&amp;nbsp;Principal Corridor; P:&amp;nbsp;Private Apartments; Q:&amp;nbsp;Service Areas; W:&amp;nbsp;The Grand staircase. ''On the ground floor'': R:&amp;nbsp;Ambassador's Entrance; T:&amp;nbsp;Grand Entrance. The areas defined by shaded walls represent lower minor wings. '''Note''': This is an unscaled sketch plan for reference only. Proportions of some rooms may slightly differ in reality.]]

The Palace measures 108 metres by 120 metres, is 24 metres high and contains over {{convert|77000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of floorspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Factfiles/40factsaboutBuckinghamPalace.aspx|publisher=The British Monarchy|title=40 facts about Buckingham Palace}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal rooms of the palace are contained on the ''[[piano nobile]]'' behind the west-facing garden facade at the rear of the palace. The centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the facade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White Drawing rooms. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is top-lit and 55&amp;nbsp;yards (50&amp;nbsp;m) long.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, p.41&quot;&gt;Harris, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallery is hung with numerous works including some by [[Rembrandt]], [[Anthony van Dyck|van Dyck]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]];&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pp.78–79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Healey, pp.387–388&lt;/ref&gt; other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the [[Throne room|Throne Room]] and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the [[throne]] from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand staircase.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, p.41&quot; /&gt; The Guard Room contains white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in Roman costume, set in a [[Tribune (architecture)|tribune]] lined with tapestries. These very formal rooms are used only for ceremonial and official entertaining, but are open to the public every summer.

Directly underneath the [[State room|State Apartments]] is a suite of slightly less grand rooms known as the semi-state apartments. Opening from the Marble Hall, these rooms are used for less formal entertaining, such as luncheon parties and private [[Head of state|audiences]]. Some of the rooms are named and decorated for particular visitors, such as the ''1844 Room'', which was decorated in that year for the State visit of [[Tsar|Emperor]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] of Russia, and, on the other side of the Bow Room, the ''1855 Room'', in honour of the visit of Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p.81&lt;/ref&gt; At the centre of this suite is the Bow Room, through which thousands of guests pass annually to the Queen's [[Garden party|Garden Parties]] in the Gardens beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen uses privately a smaller suite of rooms in the North wing.
[[File:Salon de musica.jpg|thumb|left|Prince Albert's music room, one of the smaller less formal rooms at the palace, in 1887]]
Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was building the new east wing, the [[Royal Pavilion|Brighton Pavilion]] was once again plundered of its fittings. As a result, many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton banqueting and music rooms, but has a chimney piece designed by W.M. Feetham. The Yellow Drawing Room has wall paper which had been supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and the chimney piece in this room is a European vision of what the Chinese equivalent would look like, complete with nodding [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarins]] in [[Niche (architecture)|niche]]s and fearsome winged [[Chinese dragon|dragons]], designed by Robert Jones.&lt;ref&gt;Healey, pp.159–160&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pynequeensbreakfastroombuckinghamhouse edited.jpg|thumb|The Queen's Breakfast Room]]
At the centre of this wing is the famous balcony, with the Centre Room behind its glass doors. This is a Chinese-style saloon enhanced by Queen Mary, who, working with the designer [[Charles Allom|Sir Charles Allom]], created a more &quot;binding&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, de Bellaigue &amp; Miller, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese theme in the late 1920s, although the [[lacquer]] doors were brought from Brighton in 1873. Running the length of the ''piano nobile'' of the east wing is the great gallery, modestly known as the Principal Corridor, which runs the length of the eastern side of the quadrangle.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, de Bellaigue &amp; Miller, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; It has mirrored doors, and mirrored cross walls reflecting [[porcelain]] pagodas and other oriental furniture from Brighton. The Chinese Luncheon Room and Yellow Drawing Room are situated at each end of this gallery, with the Centre Room obviously placed in the centre.

The original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which still survive, included widespread use of brightly coloured [[scagliola]] and blue and pink [[Lapis lazuli|lapis]], on the advice of Sir Charles Long. [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] oversaw a partial redecoration in a [[Belle Époque|Belle epoque]] cream and gold colour scheme.&lt;ref name=Jones43&gt;Jones, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

When paying a state visit to Britain, foreign [[Head of state|heads of state]] are usually entertained by the Queen at Buckingham Palace. They are allocated a large suite of rooms known as the Belgian suite, situated at the foot of the Minister's Staircase, on the ground floor of the North-facing garden wing. The rooms of the suite are linked by narrow corridors, one given extra height and perspective by [[Dome|saucer dome]]s designed by Nash in the style of Soane.&lt;ref name=&quot;harrisp82&quot;&gt;Harris, p.82.&lt;/ref&gt; A second corridor in the suite has Gothic influenced [[Vault (architecture)|cross over vaulting]].&lt;ref name=&quot;harrisp82&quot; /&gt; The Belgian rooms themselves were decorated in their present style and named after Prince Albert's uncle [[Leopold I of Belgium|Léopold I]], first King of the Belgians. However, at this time the suite was not reserved exclusively for foreign heads of state; in 1936, the suite briefly became the private apartments of the palace when they were occupied by [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]].&lt;ref name=fact&gt;''[http://www.royalinsight.gov.uk/output/Page5495.asp 40 facts about Buckingham Palace]'' (Royal Insight: The British Monarchy Media Centre) accessed 3 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court ceremonies===
[[File:Louis Haghe The New Ballroom 1856.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Ballroom is the largest room at Buckingham Palace. It was added by Queen Victoria and is used for ceremonies such as investitures and state banquets. This picture dates from 1856. The polychrome colour scheme has been replaced by mainly white decoration with gold details and red upholstery.]]

====Court dress====
Formerly, men not wearing [[military uniform]] would wear knee [[breeches]] of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included obligatory trains and [[tiara]]s or feathers in their hair (or both).

The dress code governing formal [[court uniform and dress]] has progressively relaxed. After World War I, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground, she requested a [[Lady-in-waiting|Lady-in-Waiting]] to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the King's reaction. King George V was horrified and her hemline remained unfashionably low.&lt;ref&gt;Healey, p.233, quoting ''The Memoirs of Mabell, Countess of Airlie'', edited and arranged by Jennifer Ellis, London:Hutchinson, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] and his consort, [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]], allowed daytime skirts to rise.

Today, there is no official dress code.&lt;ref&gt;Advice given by HM's representatives&lt;/ref&gt; Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear [[Uniform|service uniform]] or lounge suits, a minority wear [[Tailcoat|morning coats]], and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, [[black tie]] or [[white tie]]. If the occasion is &quot;white tie&quot; then women, if they possess one, wear a tiara.&lt;ref name=fact/&gt;

====Presentation of debutantes====
Court presentations of [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]]ic girls as to the monarch took place in the [[throne room|Throne Room]]. These girls were known as [[Debutante|débutante]]s, and the occasion—termed their &quot;coming out&quot;—represented their first entrée into society.  Débutantes wore full court dress, with three tall ostrich feathers in their hair. They entered, curtsied, performed a choreographed backwards walk and a further curtsy, while manoeuvring a dress train of prescribed length. (The ceremony, known as evening courts, corresponded to the &quot;[[Drawing room|court drawing rooms]]&quot; of earlier reigns.)

In 1958, the Queen abolished the presentation parties for débutantes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page5299.asp |title=Mailbox|publisher=Royal Insight Magazine|accessdate=23 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080123231607/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page5299.asp |archivedate = 23 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing them with Garden Parties.&lt;ref&gt;The late [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] is reputed to have remarked of the débutante presentations: &quot;We had to put a stop to it, every tart in London was getting in.&quot;  See Blaikie, Thomas (2002). ''You look awfully like the Queen: Wit and Wisdom from the House of Windsor''. London: Harper Collins. ISBN 0-00-714874-7&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Throne Room is used for the reception of formal addresses such as those given to the Queen on her Jubilees. It is here on the throne dais that royal wedding portraits and family photographs are taken.

====Investitures====
[[Investiture]]s, which include the conferring of [[knight]]hoods by dubbing with a sword, and other awards take place in the palace's Ballroom, built in 1854. At {{convert|36.6|m|2|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|18|m|2|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|13.5|m|2|abbr=on}} high&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Factfiles/40factsaboutBuckinghamPalace.aspx |title=Fact files &gt; 40 facts about Buckingham Palace |publisher=Royal.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (120' X 59' X 44' 3.5&quot;), it is the largest room in the palace. It has replaced the throne room in importance and use. During investitures, the Queen stands on the throne dais beneath a giant, domed velvet canopy, which is known as a shamiana or a [[baldachin]] and was used at the coronation [[Delhi Durbar|Durbar]], [[Delhi]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; A military band plays in the musicians' gallery as award recipients approach the Queen and receive their [[honour]]s, watched by their families and friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Healey, p.364&quot;&gt;Healey, p.364&lt;/ref&gt;

====State banquets====
[[File:Buckingham Palace Grand Staircase The Graphic 1870.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Guests ascending the Grand Staircase in 1870.]]
State [[banquet]]s also take place in the Ballroom; these formal dinners take place on the first evening of a state visit by a visiting Head of State.&lt;ref name=&quot;Healey, p.364&quot; /&gt; On these occasions, 150 or more guests in formal &quot;white tie and decorations&quot;, including tiaras for women, may dine off gold plate. The largest and most formal reception at Buckingham Palace takes place every November, when the Queen entertains members of the foreign diplomatic corps resident in London.&lt;ref&gt;Healey, p.362&lt;/ref&gt; On this occasion, all the state rooms are in use, as the Royal Family proceed through them&lt;ref&gt;Hedley, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; beginning through the great north doors of the Picture Gallery. As Nash had envisaged, all the large, double-mirrored doors stand open, reflecting the numerous crystal chandeliers and sconces, causing a deliberate optical illusion of space and light.

====Other ceremonies and functions====
Smaller ceremonies such as the reception of new ambassadors take place in the &quot;1844 Room&quot;. Here too the Queen holds small lunch parties, and often meetings of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]]. Larger lunch parties often take place in the curved and domed Music Room, or the State Dining Room. On all formal occasions the ceremonies are attended by the [[Yeomen of the Guard]] in their historic uniforms, and other officers of the court such as the [[Lord Chamberlain]].&lt;ref&gt;Healey, pp.363–365&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the bombing of the palace chapel in World War II, royal christenings have sometimes taken place in the Music Room. The Queen's first three children were all baptised here.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest functions of the year are the Queen's Garden Parties for up to 8,000 invitees in [[Buckingham Palace Garden|the Garden]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Modern history==
[[File:Buckingham palace 1909.jpg|thumb|right|400px||Buckingham Palace panorama, 1909]]

In 1901 the accession of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] saw new life breathed into the palace. The new King and his wife [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]] had always been at the forefront of London high society, and their friends, known as &quot;the [[Marlborough House]] Set&quot;, were considered to be the most eminent and fashionable of the age. Buckingham Palace—the Ballroom, Grand Entrance, Marble Hall, Grand Staircase, vestibules and galleries redecorated in the Belle epoque cream and gold colour scheme they retain today—once again became a setting for entertaining on a majestic scale. Many people feel King Edward's heavy redecoration of the palace does not complement Nash's original work.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (Page 9) asserts that the decorations, including plaster swags and other decorative motifs, are &quot;finicky&quot; and &quot;at odds with Nash's original detailing&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been allowed to remain for over one hundred years.

The last major building work took place during the reign of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] when, in 1913, [[Aston Webb|Sir Aston Webb]] redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part [[Giacomo Leoni]]'s [[Lyme Park]] in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal facade (of [[Portland stone]]) was designed to be the backdrop to the [[Victoria Memorial (London)|Victoria Memorial]], a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties.&lt;ref&gt;Healey, p.185&lt;/ref&gt; He arranged a series of [[Royal Command Performance|command performances]] featuring [[jazz]] musicians such as the [[Original Dixieland Jazz Band]] (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, [[Sidney Bechet]], and [[Louis Armstrong]] (1932) which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a [[Brecon Jazz Festival#(Kind of) Blue Plaque|(Kind of) Blue Plaque]] by the [[Brecon Jazz Festival]] as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23727267-buckingham-palace-hits-right-note-with-jazz-fans.do |title=Buckingham Palace hits right note with jazz fans |work=London Evening Standard |date=3 August 2009) |publisher=Thisislondon.co.uk |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephen Bates |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/aug/03/buckingham-palace-jazz-plaque-brecon |title= By royal approval: Buckingham Palace's place in jazz history|work=The Guardian |date= 3 August 2009|accessdate=11 August 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  George V's wife [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] was a [[connoisseur]] of the arts, and took a keen interest in the [[Royal Collection]] of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble [[Empire style|Empire-style]] chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden facade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room.&lt;ref&gt;Healey pp.221–222&lt;/ref&gt; This room, 69 feet (21 m) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p.63&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1999 book published by the [[Royal Collection|Royal Collection Department]] reported that the palace contained 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; While this may seem large, it is small when compared to the [[Russian Empire|Russian imperial]] palaces in [[Saint Petersburg]] and at [[Tsarskoye Selo|Tsarskoe Selo]], the [[Apostolic Palace|Papal Palace]] in Rome, the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]], the [[Stockholm Palace]], or indeed the former [[Palace of Whitehall]], and tiny compared to the [[Forbidden City]] and [[Potala Palace]]. The relative smallness of the palace may be best appreciated from within, looking out over the inner quadrangle. A minor change was made in 1938, in which the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash as a conservatory and altered in 1911–13 to a racquets court, was converted into a swimming pool.
[[File:victoria.memorial.london.arp.jpg|thumb|upright|left|200px|The [[Victoria Memorial (London)|Victoria Memorial]] was created by sculptor Sir [[Thomas Brock]] in 1911 and erected in front of the main gates at Buckingham Palace on a surround constructed by architect Sir [[Aston Webb]].]]
During World War I the palace, then the home of King George V and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. Its more valuable contents were evacuated to Windsor but the Royal family remained ''in situ''. The King imposed rationing at the palace, much to the dismay of his guests and household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Kenneth Rose|last=Rose|first=Kenneth|title=King George V|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|year=1983|isbn=0-297-78245-2|pages=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the King's later regret, [[David Lloyd George]] persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol, to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt;

The palace fared worse during World War II; it was bombed no less than seven times, the most serious and publicised of which resulted in the destruction of the palace chapel in 1940. Coverage of this event was played in cinemas all over the UK to show the common suffering of rich and poor. One bomb fell in the palace quadrangle while King George VI and Queen Elizabeth were in residence, and many windows were blown in and the chapel destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Royal Feud|last=Thornton|first=Michael|year=1984|publisher=M.Joseph|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; War-time coverage of such incidents was severely restricted, however. The King and Queen were filmed inspecting their bombed home, the smiling Queen, as always, immaculately dressed in a hat and matching coat seemingly unbothered by the damage around her. It was at this time the Queen famously declared: &quot;I'm glad we have been bombed. Now I can look the [[East End of London|East End]] in the face&quot;. The Royal family were seen as sharing their subjects' hardship, as ''[[Sunday Graphic|The Sunday Graphic]]'' reported:

{{quote|By the Editor: The King and Queen have endured the ordeal which has come to their subjects. For the second time a German bomber has tried to bring death and destruction to the home of Their Majesties...When this war is over the common danger which King George and Queen Elizabeth have shared with their people will be a cherished memory and an inspiration through the years.&lt;ref&gt;The Sunday Graphic, 18 September 1939, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 15 September 1940, known as the [[Battle of Britain Day]], an RAF pilot, [[Ray Holmes]] of [[No. 504 Squadron RAF]] rammed a German bomber he believed was going to bomb the Palace. Holmes had run out of ammunition and made the quick choice to ram it. Holmes bailed out. Both aircraft crashed. In fact the [[Dornier Do 17]] bomber was empty. It had already been damaged, two of its crew had been killed and the remainder bailed out. Its pilot, [[Feldwebel]] Robert Zehbe, landed only to suffer mortal wounds from a civilian mob. During the Dornier's descent, it somehow unloaded its bombs, one of which hit the Palace. It then crashed into the forecourt of [[London Victoria station]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Price|Price, Alfred]].

Aurum Press, London, 2000, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; The bomber's engine was later exhibited at the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London. The British pilot became a [[Queen's Messenger|King's Messenger]] following the war, and died at the age of 90 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/4398484.stm|title=Pilot who 'saved Palace' honoured |date= 2 November 2005|work=BBC news website|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)|accessdate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]]—8 May 1945—the palace was the centre of British celebrations, with the King, Queen and the Princess Elizabeth, the future Queen, and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] appearing on the balcony, with the palace's blacked-out windows behind them, to the cheers from a vast crowd in [[The Mall, London|the Mall]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/8/newsid_3580000/3580163.stm 1945: Rejoicing at end of war in Europe]'' (BBC ''On this day''.) Retrieved 3 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The boy Jones]] was an intruder who gained entry to the palace on three occasions between 1838 and 1841 as recorded by [[Charles Dickens]] some 40 years later.&lt;ref name=dickens&gt;[[Charles Dickens|Dickens, Charles]] (5 July 1885) &quot;[http://john-adcock.blogspot.com/2008/10/boy-jones.html  The boy Jones]&quot;, ''[[All the Year Round]]'', pp. 234–37.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, [[Michael Fagan incident|Michael Fagan]], was able to break into the palace twice, and conversed with the Queen on one of these.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922952,00.html God Save the Queen, Fast]'' Spencer Davidson and Arthur White ''Time Magazine'' 26 July 1982 accessed 3 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Her Majesty maintained her composure while the palace police were en route and Fagan made no threatening motions towards the Queen.

===The Garden, the Royal Mews and the Mall===
[[File:West facade of Buckingham Palace.JPG|thumb|350px|The west façade of Buckingham Palace, faced in [[Bath Stone|Bath stone]], seen from the [[Buckingham Palace Garden|Palace Gardens]].]]
{{details|Buckingham Palace Garden}}

At the rear of the palace, is the large and park-like garden which, together with its lake, is the largest private garden in London.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://web.archive.org/web/20080502231028/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/OnlineResources/X20L/Themes/1381/1092/ Buckingham Palace]'' ([[Museum of London]].) Retrieved 2 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Here the Queen hosts her annual garden parties each summer, and also holds large functions to celebrate royal milestones, such as jubilees. Originally landscaped by [[Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown|Capability Brown]], it was redesigned by [[William Townsend Aiton]] of [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew Gardens]] and John Nash. The artificial lake was completed in 1828 and is supplied with water from the [[River Westbourne|Serpentine]], a river which runs through [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Adjacent to the palace is the [[Royal Mews]], also designed by Nash, where the royal carriages, including the [[Gold State Coach]], are housed. This [[rococo]] gilt coach, designed by Sir [[Sir William Chambers|William Chambers]] in 1760, has painted panels by [[Giovanni Battista Cipriani|G. B. Cipriani]]. It was first used for the State Opening of Parliament by George III in 1762 and is used by the monarch only for coronations or jubilee celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page1210.asp|title=Kid's Zone:The Gold State Coach|publisher=The official website of the British Monarchy|accessdate=25 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also housed in the Mews are the carriage horses used in royal ceremonial processions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page556.asp|title=The Royal Residences &gt; The Royal Mews|publisher=www.royal.gov.uk|accessdate=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Mall, London|The Mall]], a ceremonial approach route to the palace, was designed by Sir [[Aston Webb]] and completed in 1911 as part of a grand memorial to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. It extends from [[Admiralty Arch]], up around the [[Victoria Memorial (London)|Victoria Memorial]], bounded by the [[Canada Gate and Canada Memorial (London)|Canada Gate]], South Africa Gate and Australia Gate, to the palace [[forecourt]]. This route is used by the cavalcades and motorcades of all visiting heads of state, and by the Royal Family on state occasions such as the annual [[State Opening of Parliament]] as well as [[Trooping the Colour]] each year.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===21st century: Royal use and public access===

[[File:Buckinghampalacebalcony.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The Royal Family on the balcony in 1986]]

Every year some 50,000 invited guests are entertained at garden parties, receptions, audiences, and banquets. The [[Garden party|Garden Parties]], usually three, are held in the summer, usually in July. The Forecourt of Buckingham Palace is used for [[Queen's Guard#Changing the Queen's Life Guard|Changing of the Guard]], a major ceremony and tourist attraction (daily during the summer months; every other day during the winter).

The palace, like [[Windsor Castle]], is owned by the British state. It is not the monarch's personal property, unlike [[Sandringham House]] and [[Balmoral Castle]]. Many of the contents from Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, [[Kensington Palace]] and [[St. James's Palace]] are known collectively as the [[Royal Collection]]; owned by the Sovereign, they can, on occasions, be viewed by the public at the [[Queen's Gallery]], near the Royal Mews. Unlike the palace and the castle, the gallery is open continually and displays a changing selection of items from the collection. The rooms containing the Queen's Gallery are on the site of the former chapel, which was damaged by one of the seven bombs to fall on the palace during World War II. The palace's [[state room]]s have been open to the public during August and September since 1993. The money raised in entry fees was originally put towards the rebuilding of [[Windsor Castle]] following the [[1992 Windsor Castle fire|1992 fire]] which destroyed many of its state rooms.

In May 2009, in response to a request from the Royal Family to the government for money for a backlog of repairs to the palace, a group of MPs on the Public Accounts Committee proposed that in return for the extra £4&amp;nbsp;million in annual funds requested, the palace should be open to the public more than the 60 days it is now, as well as when members of the Royal Family are in residence.&lt;ref name=&quot;MPs 60 days&quot;&gt;{{cite news  |title = Queen must open palace more in return for extra funds  |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date = 30 May 2009 |url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/5407953/Queen-must-open-palace-more-in-return-for-extra-funds.html |accessdate = 4 June 2009 | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Pierce}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Government currently provides £15&amp;nbsp;million yearly for the palace's upkeep.

Thus, Buckingham Palace is a symbol and home of the British monarchy, an art gallery and tourist attraction. Behind the gilded railings and gates which were made by the [[Bromsgrove Guild]]&lt;ref name=&quot;rob9&quot; /&gt; and Webb's famous facade which has been described in a book published by the Royal Collection as looking &quot;like everybody's idea of a palace&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;rob9&quot; /&gt; is not only the weekday home of the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] but also the London residence of the [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Duke of York]] and the [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Earl]] and [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex|Countess of Wessex]]. The palace also houses the offices of the [[Royal Household]] and is the workplace of 450 people.

'''British Airways plc''' ('''BA''') is the [[flag carrier]] airline of the [[United Kingdom]] which is based and headquartered in [[Waterside (building)|Waterside]], near its main [[Airline hub|hub]] at [[London Heathrow Airport]]. British Airways operates a second hub at [[Gatwick Airport]] and a third hub, served through its fully owned subsidiary, [[BA CityFlyer]], at [[London City Airport]]. British Airways is the largest airline in the UK based on fleet size, international flights and international destinations. BA's UK passengers originating at non-London airports must connect via London after British Airways discontinued all direct overseas flights from UK airports outside London following the sale of [[BA Connect]] to British regional carrier [[Flybe]] in 2007. 

The British Airways Board was established in 1971 to control the two nationalised airline corporations, [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] and [[British European Airways|BEA]], and two much smaller regional airlines, [[Cambrian Airways]] from [[Cardiff]] and [[Northeast Airlines (UK)|Northeast Airlines]] from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. On 31 March 1974 all four companies were dissolved to form British Airways (BA). After almost 13 years as a nationalised company, British Airways was privatised in February 1987 as part of the privatisation plan by the Conservative Government of the time. The carrier soon expanded with the acquisition of [[British Caledonian]] (BCAL) in 1987 and Gatwick-based carrier [[Dan-Air]] in 1992. 

A longtime [[Boeing]] customer, British Airways placed a major order for [[Airbus]] aircraft in August 1998 with the purchase of 59 [[Airbus A320 family]] aircraft. In 2007, the carrier placed its next major order, marking the start of its [[flight length|long-haul]] fleet replacement, ordering 12 [[Airbus A380]]s and 24 [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]s. The centrepiece of the airline's long-haul fleet is the [[Boeing 747-400]]; with 57 examples in service, British Airways is the largest operator of the type in the world. 

British Airways is a founding member of the [[oneworld|'''one'''world]] airline alliance, along with [[American Airlines]], [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Qantas]] and the now defunct [[Canadian Airlines]]. The alliance has since grown to become the third largest airline alliance after [[SkyTeam]] and [[Star Alliance]]. British Airways' parent company, [[International Airlines Group]], is listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[FTSE 100 Index]]. 

On 12 November 2009, British Airways confirmed that it had reached a preliminary agreement to merge with [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]]. The merger between the two carriers will create the world's third-largest airline in terms of annual revenue and the second largest airline group in Europe. The merger was confirmed on 8 April 2010, and it was expected to be completed by the end of the same year. On 14 July 2010, the [[European Commission]] gave the two carriers permission to merge and also agreed to allow [[American Airlines]] to co-operate with the merged entity on [[transatlantic flight|transatlantic]] routes to the United States of America. The British Airways merger with Iberia was finally completed on 21 January 2011, formally creating the [[International Airlines Group]], IAG.

{{Main|History of British Airways}}
[[File:British Concorde.jpg|thumb|left|British Airways [[Concorde]] at London Heathrow Airport]]

In 1967 the government established a committee of inquiry into Civil Aviation under Sir Ronald Edwards. The Edwards Committee reported in 1969 with one of the recommendations being the formation of a National Air Holding Board to control finances and polices of the two government-controlled airlines, the [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) and [[British European Airways Corporation]] (BEA).&lt;ref name=&quot;times57549&quot; /&gt; The recommendation was enacted in 1971 with the passing of the Civil Aviation Act 1971 which formed a British Airways Board to control all the activities of the two airlines.&lt;ref name=&quot;act1971&quot; /&gt;

British Airways (BA) was created in 1974, when BOAC and BEA managements were combined under the newly formed ''British Airways Board''.&lt;ref name = EOP7&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/history-1970-1979/public/en_gb|work=British Airways|title=Explore our past: 1970–1979|accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following two years of fierce competition with [[British Caledonian]], the second-largest airline in Britain at the time, the Government changed its aviation policy in 1976 so the carriers were no longer permitted to compete on long-haul routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%201427.html |title = UK abandons long-haul competition |work=Flight International |date = 7 August 1975 |page = 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Airways was one of only two airlines, the other being [[Air France]], to operate the [[supersonic]] airliner [[Aerospatiale-BAC Concorde]], inaugurating the world's first supersonic passenger service in January 1976 from London Heathrow to [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref name = 'Concordeintro3'&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=inkRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PeADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5479,5052446&amp;dq=concorde|title=Concorde starts regular service|work=Eugene Register-Guard|date= 26 January 1976|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Services to the eastern seaboard of the US, which Concorde had been designed for, were inaugurated with a service to [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington Dulles]] airport on 24 May 1976 and with flights to [[New York JFK]] airport starting on 22 September 1977. This was followed by a service to [[Singapore]] in cooperation with [[Singapore Airlines]] as a continuation of the flight to Bahrain.&lt;ref name = EOP7/&gt; Concorde operations soon expanded with charter services inaugurated in 1982 and a service to Miami (served as a continuation of the Washington flight) beginning in March 1984.&lt;ref name = BAP/&gt; Following the [[Air France Flight 4590|Air France Concorde crash]] in Paris and the slump in demand for air travel after the [[11 September attacks|11 September Attacks]] in New York, the announcement was made on 23 April 2003, that both Air France and British Airways would cease Concorde operations by the end of October 2003, after 27 years of service. The final commercial Concorde flight flew as BA002 from New York JFK to London Heathrow on 24 October 2003.&lt;ref name = EOP2000&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.britishairways.com/travel/history-2000-present/public/en_gb|title=Explore Our Past:2000 – present|work=British Airways|accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the airline was instructed to prepare for privatisation by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government leading to the appointment of [[John King, Baron King of Wartnaby|Sir John King]], later Lord King, as Chairman with the goal of bringing the airline back into profitability. King was credited with transforming the loss-making giant into one of the most profitable air carriers in the world, while many other large airlines struggled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4896070.html|title=A-Z of Employers|work=The Independent| date=12 February 1998|first=Rachelle|last=Thackray|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag carrier was privatised and was floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]] in February 1987 by the Conservative government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/danair-swallowed-up-by-ba-rivals-say-competition-and-choice-will-be-cut-by-takeover-that-will-axe-1900-jobs-1559258.html|title=After much fanfare, sale of British Airways set to begin|work=The Independent| accessdate=10 February 1987|last=Marshall|first=Tyler | date=24 October 1992 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1987, British Airways effected the controversial takeover of Britain's &quot;second&quot; airline, British Caledonian.&lt;ref name = BAP&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/history-1980-1989/public/en_gb|work=British Airways|title=Explore our past: 1980–1989|accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, British Airways expanded through the acquisition of financially troubled Gatwick-based carrier [[Dan-Air]], giving BA a much larger presence at Gatwick airport. In March 1993, the rapid expansion continued with the formation of British Asia Airways, a subsidiary based in the Taiwan, to operate between London and [[Taipei]]. Throughout 1993, British Airways expanded through the purchase of a 25% stake in Australian airline [[Qantas]] in March, and the acquisition [[Brymon Airways]] in May to form [[BA Connect]].&lt;ref name = EOP9&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/history-1990-1999/public/en_gb|work=British Airways|title=Explore our past: 1990–1999|accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of [[Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]] in 1984 began a tense relationship with BA. In 1993, the intense rivalry between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic culminated with British Airways being sued £610,000 for a &quot;dirty tricks&quot; campaign against Virgin and around £3&amp;nbsp;million in Virgin's legal costs. British Airways' campaign against Virgin included poaching Virgin Atlantic customers and tampering with private files belonging to Virgin. Following a court case, British Airways was forced to pay Virgin damages and legal costs causing BA management to apologise &quot;unreservedly&quot; for the alleged &quot;dirty tricks&quot; campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;dirtytricks&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=BA dirty tricks against Virgin cost £3m|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/11/newsid_2520000/2520189.stm|publisher=BBC: On This Day|date=11 January 1993|accessdate=23 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months after the &quot;dirty tricks&quot; campaign, Lord King stepped down as chairman in 1993 and was replaced by former deputy, Colin Marshall, while [[Robert Ayling]] took over as CEO.&lt;ref name = EOP9/&gt; Benefits under his management included cost savings of £750m and the establishment of [[Go Fly|Go]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=aylingquits&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/11/business/international-business-british-airways-ousts-chief-after-four-tumultuous-years.html|title=International Business; British Airways Ousts Chief After Four Tumultuous Years|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 June 2009|last=|first= | date=11 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one year on, in 1999, British Airways reported an 84 percent drop in profits, its worst for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/29/business/market-insight-seeing-fool-s-gold-in-airlines-cheap-seats.html|title=Market Insight: Seeing Fool's Gold In Airlines' Cheap Seats|work=New York Times|date=29 August 1999|last=Sorkin|first=Andrew|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2000, Robert Ayling was removed from his position and British Airways announced [[Rod Eddington]] as his successor. Eddington set about cutting the workforce further, in response to the slump caused by 11 September attacks in 2001.&lt;ref name = EOP2000/&gt; On 8 September 2004, British Airways announced that it was to sell its 18.5 percent stake in [[Qantas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CWU/is_2004_Sept_8/ai_n6186551 FindArticles.com], &quot;British Airways to sell its Qantas stake&quot; ''Airline Industry Information''. 8 September 2004.

In September 1998, British Airways, along with [[American Airlines]], [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Qantas]] and the now defunct [[Canadian Airlines]], agreed to form the [[oneworld|'''one'''world]] [[airline alliance]] in order to better compete with the growing [[Star Alliance]] members. '''one'''world began operations on 1 February 1999 and has since grown to include 11 carriers with 2 pending and has become one of the largest airline alliances in the world, behind only [[SkyTeam]] and Star Alliance&lt;ref name = BAP/&gt;

In September 2005, new CEO [[Willie Walsh (Irish businessman)|Willie Walsh]], former [[Aer Lingus]] pilot and then boss, took charge of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E5DF163CF93AA35750C0A9639C8B63 |title=International Business; Former Chief of Aer Lingus To Get British Air's Top Post |work=The New York Times |last=Lavery |first=Brian |date=9 March 2005|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, BA unveiled its new subsidiary [[OpenSkies]] which takes advantage of the liberalisation of transatlantic traffic rights between Europe and the United States. OpenSkies flies non-stop from Paris to New York and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/Discipline/Advertising/News/775685/BA-brands-new-airline-OpenSkies/|title=BA brands new airline &quot;Open Skies&quot;|publisher=Brand Republic|date=9 January 2008|author=Jemima Bokaie|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, British Airways received permission from the European regulators of aviation, the [[European Commission]], to merge with Spanish carrier, [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]], and to co-ordinate with [[American Airlines]] on fares and scheduling for [[transatlantic flight|transatlantic]] routes. On 20 July 2010, the [[United States Department of Transportation|US Department of Transport]] approved the deal with American Airlines, finalising their tentative decision made on 13 February 2010.&lt;ref name = DAOAIA/&gt; The deal is expected to save British Airways £560&amp;nbsp;million every year once all the cost-overlaps between the companies have been eliminated.&lt;ref name = BAIAAS&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/article-1294778/British-Airways-way-alliance-cleared-takeoff.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|title=British Airways' three-way alliance cleared for takeoff|work=The Daily Mail|date=14 July 2010|accessdate=16 July 2010 | location=London | first=Elliot | last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Airways ceased trading on the London Stock Exchange on 21 January 2011, after nearly 24 years as a constituent of the [[FTSE 100]] index. The move came in preparation for the merger with Iberia, while the merged entity, [[International Airlines Group]], became the name under which British Airways now trades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jan/20/british-airways-trades-last-time-merger|title=British Airways trades for last time ahead of Iberia merger|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=21 January 2011|date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 October 2010, British Airways unveiled one of its last [[Boeing 757]]s (G-CPET) in a 'retro' livery, to celebrate the retirement of the 757 fleet after 27 years. The aircraft, named '[[Stokesay Castle]]' is wearing an identical livery to that worn by the 757s during their introduction to service, as joint launch customer, in February 1983. The 757s were retired from commercial service on 30 October 2010. However, the Retro-Jet (G-CPET) flew her last passenger flight on Saturday, 6 November as a charity &quot;round routed&quot; trip from LHR to LHR. This flight was open to staff and their families, with all proceeds going to British Airways joint venture with Comic Relief, Flying Start.&lt;ref name=Flight348135&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/10/05/348135/picture-british-airways-unveils-retro-livery-as-757-era-ends.html |title=PICTURE: British Airways unveils 'retro' livery as 757 era ends |publisher=Flight International |first=David |last=Kaminski-Morrow |accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merger with Iberia==

On 30 July 2008, British Airways and Spanish carrier [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]], a fellow [[Oneworld|'''one'''world]] partner, announced a merger plan that would result in the two airlines joining forces in an all-stock transaction while retaining their separate brands, similar to [[KLM]] and [[Air France]] in [[Air France-KLM|their merger agreement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;baiberiamerger&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/30/business/worldbusiness/30air.html?ref=todayspaper|title=British Airways in Merger Talks|last=Brothers|first=Caroline|work=The New York Times|date=30 July 2008|accessdate=30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November 2009, British Airways confirmed that it had reached a preliminary agreement to merge with [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8356780.stm |title = BA and Iberia agree merger deal |publisher=BBC News |date = 12 November 2009 | accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was confirmed on 8 April 2010, and was expected to be completed by the end of 2010.&lt;ref name = BAIM&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8608667.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=British Airways and Iberia sign merger agreement| date=8 April 2010 | accessdate=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July 2010, the [[European Commission]], granted both airlines permission to merge as well as permission to include [[American Airlines]] in co-operation on ticket prices and schedules on [[transatlantic flight|transatlantic]] routes for all three airlines.&lt;ref name = ECABAIB&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/epic/bay/7890648/EC-approves-BA-alliance-with-American-Airlines-and-Iberia.html|work=The Telegraph|title=EC approves BA alliance with American Airlines and Iberia|date=15 July 2010|accessdate=15 July 2010 | location=London | first=Emma | last=Rowley}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 July 2010, the [[United States Department of Transportation|US Department of Transport]] approved the deal with American Airlines, finalising their tentative decision made on 13 February 2010.&lt;ref name = DAOAIA&gt;{{Cite press release |title=DOT Approves oneworld Antitrust Immunity Application|url=http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot14010.html|publisher=United States Department of Transportation|date=20 July 2010 |accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 October 2010, the alliance between British Airways, American Airlines and Iberia formally began operations for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/airlines-unveil-new-deal-for-transatlantic-flyers-2101207.html|work=The Independent|location=London|title=Airlines unveil 'new deal for transatlantic flyers'|date=8 October 2010|accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shareholders from British Airways and Iberia approved the merger on 29 November 2010, allowing the creation of the world's third largest airline by revenue.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/Timeline-BA-Iberia-reuters_molt-1258343248.html?x=0&lt;/ref&gt; Both carriers completed their merger on 21 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/business/news/Iberia%20expects%20to%20complete%20merger%20with%20BA%20in%20January/-/1006/1041268/-/x2a6bh/-/index.html|work=Daily Nation|title=Iberia expects to complete merger with British Airways in January|accessdate=18 November 2010|date=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger between British Airways and Iberia has created the world's third-largest airline in terms of annual revenue and the second largest airline group in Europe.&lt;ref name=BAIM/&gt;

British Airways holds a [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority]] Type A Operating Licence, and is permitted to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?categoryid=183&amp;pagetype=90&amp;pageid=340|title=Description of UK Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence|work=Civil Aviation Authority|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Airways is the largest airline based in the United Kingdom in terms of fleet size, international flights and international destinations and was, until 2008, the largest airline based in the UK in terms of passenger numbers as well. The airline carried 34.6&amp;nbsp;million passengers in 2008 but rival UK low-cost carrier [[easyJet]] carried 44.5&amp;nbsp;million passengers in the same year, taking the title from British Airways for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Airways Traffic Statistics&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=British Airways Traffic Statistics 2008

British Airways' main base is at London Heathrow Airport in west London, England but it also has a major presence at [[Gatwick Airport]] and at one time operated a significant hub at [[Manchester Airport]]. However, hub operations at Manchester, and international services from outside London, ceased after the airline sold their subsidiary, BA Connect, citing lack of profitability. Passengers wishing to travel internationally with BA either to or from regional UK destinations must now transfer in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Flights hit by BA sale to Flybe |date=5 March 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6418391.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heathrow airport in particular is dominated by British Airways, due to their ownership of 40% of the slots available at the airport.&lt;ref name='slotsref'&gt;{{Cite news|first=David|last=Gow|coauthors=|title=BA outbid for Heathrow slots|date=21 January 2004|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/ba/story/0,,1127473,00.html|work=The Guardian |location=UK |pages=|accessdate=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 2008, British Airways moved almost half of their Heathrow operating staff, equipment, and aircraft to the new [[London Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5]]. The vast majority of British Airways services to and from Heathrow operate from Terminal 5, with the exception of some service flights which will operate out of [[London Heathrow Terminal 3|Terminal 3]].&lt;ref name=abtn&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abtn.co.uk/news/2613309-news-in-brief-october-26-2009|title=News In Brief|work=Air &amp; Travel Business News

In August 2007, British Airways agreed to plead guilty and pay a $300&amp;nbsp;million fine as a result of felony antitrust charges in the United States for conspiring to fix air cargo prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/press_releases/2007/224928.htm|accessdate=18 December 2010|title=British Airways PLC and Korean Airlines Co.

BA CityFlyer is a subsidiary with [[Embraer]] aircraft based at [[London City Airport]]. In December 2008 CityFlyer signed a contract with [[Embraer]] to modernise the fleet with an order for 11 [[E-Jet]] aircraft which are replacing the existing Avro RJ aircraft. BA CityFlyer operates around 250 flights per week from London City Airport.&lt;ref name='cityref'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.easier.com/view/Travel/Flights/British_Airways/article-104619.html|title=BA plans major expansion at London City|accessdate=27 September 2007|date=14 March 2007|work=easier Travel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Airways previously was the full owner of Airways Aero Associations Limited, which operates the [[British Airways flying club]] and runs its own aerodrome under the British Airways brand at [[Wycombe Air Park]], [[High Wycombe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bafc.co.uk/history.shtml|title=History of BAFC|work=Airways Aero Associations|accessdate=11 September 2009|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080311174217/http://www.bafc.co.uk/history.shtml |archivedate = 11 March 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the creation of an Open Skies agreement between Europe and the United States in March 2008, British Airways started a new subsidiary airline called OpenSkies (previously known as &quot;Project Lauren&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7178673.stm|title=BA to launch 'open skies' airline|publisher=BBC News|date=9 January 2008 | accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airline started operations in June 2008, and now flies direct from Paris to New York JFK and Washington Dulles.&lt;ref name='os13'&gt;{{Cite news |first=Kevin |last=Done |title=BA takes OpenSkies to Amsterdam |date=28 July 2008 |work=Financial Times  |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4c1e5b64-5cd6-11dd-8d38-000077b07658.html |accessdate=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BA is, through its subsidiary British Airways World Cargo, the world's twelfth-largest [[cargo airline]] based on total freight tonne-kilometres flown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=BA World Cargo Adds to Surcharge|work=Traffic World|work=Journal of Commerce, Inc.|date=25 August 2005|accessdate=7 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; BA World Cargo has global freight opportunities through the British Airways flight routes. In addition to the main fleet, BA World Cargo [[wet lease]] three [[Boeing 747-400]]F aircraft from [[Global Supply Systems]] on a multi-year basis, as well as utilising space on dedicated freighters operated by other carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Atlas Air invests in new UK airline|work=Atlas Air Inc.|date=12 April 2001|url=http://www.atlasair.com/aa/press/press2.asp?Pressid=8|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030226090144/http://www.atlasair.com/aa/press/press2.asp?Pressid=8|archivedate=26 February 2003|accessdate=19 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dedicated freighter services gives British Airways World Cargo the opportunity to service destinations that are not available on their passenger route network.
In 2010 it was announced that BAWC would wet lease three [[Boeing 747-8F]] aircraft from Global Supply Systems to replace the 747-400s. The replacement aircraft will be painted in full British Airways Livery.

British Airways opened a World Cargo centre at Heathrow in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=British Airways unveils cargo center plan|work=Air Cargo World|date=1 June 1995|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6335276_ITM|last=Andren|first =Emily|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an advanced automated freight handling centre, it can handle unusual and premium cargo, and fresh produce, of which it handles over 80,000 tons per year.&lt;ref name='freightref'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freight-int.com/companies/british-airways-world-cargo.asp|title=British Airways World Cargo|accessdate=27 September 2007|work=Freight International}}&lt;/ref&gt; BA World Cargo also handles freight at London's Gatwick and Stansted airports, and, through its partner British Airways Regional Cargo, at all of the main regional airports throughout the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6161349_ITM|date=23 February 2004|title=British Airways Regional Cargo.(People Watch)(general manager appointed)|work=Traffic World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial relations===

Staff working for British Airways are represented by a number of trade unions, which include:
* [[BALPA]], who represent pilots
* [[British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association|BASSA]], who represent some of the cabin crew
* [[Unite the Union]] for other employees

British Airways, under [[Bob Ayling]]'s management, faced strike action by cabin crew over the £1&amp;nbsp;billion cost-cutting drive that was made to return the carrier to profitability in 1997. This was the last time cabin crew at BA went on strike until 2009. Following these strikes, and the cost-cutting programme implemented by Ayling, staff morale never recovered leading to unrest within the company ever since.&lt;ref name = CCSA&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/dec/15/british-airways-strike-background|work=The Guardian|title=BA strike: conflict that was always on airline's flight path|date=15 December 2009|accessdate=4 July 2010 | The airline did have some success in the form of a workshop which was attended by more than 1800 managers and 220 union representatives.

(2009). &quot;Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees&quot;. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2005, wildcat action was taken by union members over the decision by [[Gate Gourmet]] to lock out 670 workers and replace them with agency staff after a contract with British Airways was not renewed. It is estimated that the strike cost British Airways £30&amp;nbsp;million and caused disruption to 100,000 passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4162036.stm|title=Gate Gourmet probes union claims|publisher=BBC News|date=18 August 2005|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2006, a [[British Airways cross controversy|dispute]] over the right of a Christian check-in worker to wear a visible symbol of faith occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Woman to sue BA in necklace row|publisher=BBC News|date=15 October 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6052608.stm|accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The employee lost an employment tribunal in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/jan/08011603.html|title=Court rules BA may prohibit crosses but not other religious symbols|work=lifesitenews.com|date=16 January 2008|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, cabin crew threatened strike action over salary changes to be imposed by the British Airways Board. The strike was then confirmed but called off just before the start of the action, leading to British Airways losing £80&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name = CCSA/&gt;

Relations have been turbulent between BA and Unite, particularly in 2009 and 2010 with regard to proposed changes to working conditions for cabin crew in response to the global financial crisis. A strike ballot was held in December 2009 over changes to working practices which received overwhelming support for planned action over Christmas 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8411214.stm|title=British Airways cabin crew vote for Christmas strike |publisher=BBC News|date=14 December 2009|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This industrial action was blocked by a court injunction deeming the ballot illegal. A re-ballot was held in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8527100.stm|title=British Airways cabin crew back strike action|publisher=BBC News|date=22 February 2010|accessdate=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing negotiations failed to stop strike action in March, and the company withdrew travel perks for those participating in the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8584720.stm|title=BA Strikers to forfeit cheap travel perks|publisher=BBC News|date=24 March 2010|accessdate=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Allegations made in the ''Guardian'' newspaper that BA had sought consultancy on how to undermine the unions operating in BA were withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2010/apr/02/frank-burchill-apology|title=Apology to Frank Burchill|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=2 April 2010|accessdate=6 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further strike was announced for May 2010 and British Airways again sought an injunction on a technicality which was initially granted, but overturned on appeal during the first aborted planned action. The attempts to avert strike action were delayed after members of the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]] broke up the negotiations between BA leadership and Unite the Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=21303|title=Right to Work conference shows opposition to BA boss Willie Walsh|work=Socialist Worker |date=22 May 2010|accessdate=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations were further strained when Unite co-leader [[Derek Simpson (trade unionist)|Derek Simpson]] was found to be using his [[Blackberry]] to update his Twitter account with progress of the confidential negotiations under the chairmanship of conciliation service [[Acas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/10143076.stm|title=Unite union says BA strike to go ahead|publisher=BBC News|date=23 May 2010|accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
In April 2000 British Airways selected [[Amadeus IT Group|Amadeus]]' Altéa platform to replace their inhouse [[Passenger Service System]] known as BABS.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.speedwing.com/latest_news/press_releases/pr_amadeus.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Migration to the new reservations and inventory system was completed in 2002.

== Fleet ==
With the exception of the [[Boeing 707]] and early [[Boeing 747]] variants from BOAC, the airline as formed in 1972-4 inherited a mainly UK-built fleet of aircraft. The airline introduced the [[Boeing 737]] and [[Boeing 757]] into the fleet in the 1980s, followed by the [[Boeing 747-400]], [[Boeing 767]] and [[Boeing 777]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name = BAP/&gt;&lt;ref name = EOP9/&gt;

Boeing-built aircraft for British Airways are allocated the [[List of Boeing customer codes|customer code]] ''36'', which appears in their aircraft designation as a suffix, such as 737-436, 747–436 and 777-236.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/application.aspx?catid=60&amp;pagetype=65&amp;appid=1&amp;mode=summary&amp;aircrafttype=Boeing&amp;owner=British%20Airways|title=CAA Aircraft Register (Boeing aircraft registered to British Airways)|work=Civil Aviation Authority|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engine choice ===

The majority (77%) of the British Airways fleet is either powered by [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] or [[International Aero Engines|IAE]] alliance [[Aircraft engines|engines]], of which Rolls-Royce is a major contributor. The remaining 23% of the fleet is equally divided between [[GE Aviation|General Electric]] and the [[CFM International]] consortium:&lt;ref name=&quot;G-INFO&quot; /&gt;

;Rolls-Royce &lt;!-- (42% of fleet) --&gt;
*The [[Rolls-Royce RB211|RB211-524]] power all the Boeing 747-400s and Boeing 767s.
*The [[Trent 800]] powers 19 of the Boeing 777s.

;International Aero Engines (IAE) &lt;!-- (35% of fleet)  --&gt;
*All the [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A319]]s and [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A321]]s are powered by variants of the [[IAE V2500|V2500]] as well as 37 of the [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]]s.

;General Electric &lt;!-- (13% of fleet) --&gt;
* The [[General Electric GE90]] powers 27 of the Boeing 777-200/-200ERs and all of the Boeing 777-300ERs.

;CFM International &lt;!-- (10% of fleet) --&gt;
* Different variants of the [[CFM International CFM56]] power both Airbus A318 aircraft, all the Boeing 737s, and four of the Airbus A320s.

=== Recent aircraft orders ===
British Airways has 32 outstanding options with Airbus, which may be taken as any member of the A320 family. Secured delivery positions on 10 Boeing 777 aircraft are held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.corporate-ir.net/library/69/694/69499/items/219506/Interim_2007.pdf|title=BA Interim Financial Results 2006 Q3, Page 12|work=British Airways|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 2007, British Airways placed a firm order for four 777-200ER aircraft with an option for four more, with the order totalling more than US$800&amp;nbsp;million at list price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-30158167_ITM|title=Boeing and British Airways complete deal for four 777-200ERs; Boeing 777 is logical complement to British Airways' wide-body fleet|work=M2 Presswire|date=28 March 2007|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has stated that these are for fleet expansion. BA's first 777s were fitted with [[General Electric GE90]] engines, but BA switched to [[Rolls-Royce Trent 800]]s for the most recent 19 aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60879579.html|title=Rolls-Royce lands US jets deal|work=Birmingham Evening Mail|accessdate=18 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; This engine choice has been continued with the most recent four orders as Trent 800 engines were selected as the powerplant for the new aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2007/04/02/afx3572632.html|title=BA picks Rolls-Royce engines for new Boeing 777 jets|work=Forbes |accessdate=2 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boeing 787s will replace 14 of British Airways' Boeing 767 fleet while the Airbus A380s will replace 20 of BA's oldest Boeing 747-400s and will most likely be used to increase capacity on key routes from London Heathrow, such as Hong Kong and Los Angeles.&lt;ref name='nextorderref'&gt;{{Cite news|first=Victoria|last=Moores|title=BA to decide on remaining long-haul renewal in 2008–09|date=27 September 2007|work=FlightGlobal|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/09/27/217256/ba-to-decide-on-remaining-long-haul-renewal-in-2008-09.html|accessdate=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical theme predominantly used on British Airways advertising is &quot;[[The Flower Duet]]&quot; by [[Léo Delibes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chrisworthproductions.com/track_details.php?id=858|title=Flower Duet (From Lakme) by Leo Delibes|work=Chris Worth Productions|accessdate=8 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, and the slogan &quot;The World's Favourite Airline&quot; were introduced in 1989 with the launch of the iconic [[British Airways face advertisement|&quot;Face&quot; advertisement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxs106rp5RQ|title=1989 British Airways Commercial|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan was dropped in 2001, after having been overtaken by Lufthansa in terms of passenger numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=British Airways takes off|date=22 May 2001|url=http://money.cnn.com/2001/05/22/europe/ba/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, &quot;Flower Duet&quot; is still used by the airline, and has been through several different arrangements since 1989. The recent version of this melody was shown in 2007, with a new slogan, &quot;Upgrade to British Airways&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.upgradetobritishairways.ba.com/|title=BA official website – &quot;Upgrade to British Airways&quot; homepage|work=British Airways|accessdate=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising agency used for 23 years by BA was [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]], who created many of the most famous advertisements for the airline including the influential &quot;Face&quot; commercial. However, following the termination of its relationship with BA, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi made an imitation of this commercial for rival airline [[Silverjet]] in 2007.&lt;ref name = SJA&gt;{{Cite news|title=Saatchi ad gets revenge on BA|date=5 October 2007|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/oct/05/advertising|work=The Guardian |location=UK |first=Mark|last=Sweney|accessdate=28 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2007, BA's advertising agency is [[Bartle Bogle Hegarty]].&lt;ref name='adref'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleboglehegarty.com/Europe/Clients+Work.aspx|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070211202941/http://www.bartleboglehegarty.com/Europe/Clients+Work.aspx|archivedate=11 February 2007|title=Clients &amp; Work|work=Bartle Bogle Hegarty|accessdate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to &quot;The World's Favourite Airline&quot;, advertising slogans included:
* &quot;The World's Best Airline&quot;.
* &quot;We'll Take More Care Of You&quot;.
* &quot;Fly the Flag&quot;.

Online, the value of the British Airways Brand was pushed in 2002 as the company was given an opportunity to buy its acronym,
and its [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] Airline code the letters &quot;BA&quot; as their [[internet domain]] ba.com. The domain was previously owned by [[Bell Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vb.com/ba.htm|title=The History of the ba.com Domain|work=VB.com|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March 2011 the airline set a new Guinness World Records title for 'Highest stand up comedy gig in the world' in support of Comic Relief, with comedians Dara O Briain, Jack Whitehall and Jon Richardson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Website|title=BA Website|url=http://press.ba.com/?p=1681|work=Press Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux30pnqvQQE&amp;feature=channel_video_title Highlight clip]

As official airline partner of the London 2012 Games, British Airways launched a 'mentor opportunity' through the BA Great Britons Programme on May 5, 2011. It offers the opportunity to collaborate with [[Heston Blumenthal]], [[Tracey Emin]] and [[Richard E Grant]] on one of three projects. In the food category, the winner will be mentored by [[Heston Blumenthal]] to produce a menu served on BA flights in the run up to the Games. In film, the winner will partner with [[Richard E. Grant]] to draft a script, which will be made into a short film and shown on BA flights and at the pre opening of the Olympic Games.  Finally, the protégé in the art category, will collaborate with [[Tracey Emin]] to produce artwork for 12 BA flights in the run up to the London 2012 Games.

=== Tail fins ===

{{further|[[British Airways ethnic liveries]]}}
Since its formation in 1974, though to a limited extent until all aircraft were repainted, British Airways' aeroplanes carried a [[Union Flag]] scheme painted on their tail fins. The original predominantly red tail scheme was changed with the launch of a new livery designed by the New York design agency, Landor Associates{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. The new tail was predominantly dark blue and carried the British Airways Coat of Arms. On 10 June 1997 there was a highly controversial change from the use of the British colours to ethnic logos and abstract world images,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/by-their-tailfins-shall-we-know-them-1256015.html|title=By their tailfins shall we know them?|work=The Independent|date=15 June 1997|first=Hugh|last=Aldersey-Williams|accessdate=28 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as Delftware or Chinese calligraphy for example. All the designs related to countries on the company's network of routes. This caused problems with [[air traffic control]]: whereas previously controllers had been able to tell pilots to follow a BA plane, they were now harder to visually identify because each plane was painted in a range of different colours and colour schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/people--business-1155362.html|title=People &amp; Business|work=The Independent|date=9 April 1998|first=John|last=Willcock|accessdate=28 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several people spoke out against the change from the traditional Union Flag Scheme, including the former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] who covered the tail of a model BA plane with a white hankerchief captured by BBC News cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/287813.stm|title=Virgin to create 2,000 jobs|publisher=BBC News|date=1 March 1999 | accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; BA's traditional rival, Virgin Atlantic, quickly adopted the British flag along with the slogan &quot;Britain's national flagcarrier&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60450784.html|title=Tony Parsons' column: Don't Jack it in yet|work=The Mirror|date=14 June 1999|last=Parsons|first=Tony|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 June 1999, BA CEO Bob Ayling announced that all BA planes would be repainted with the &lt;!--[[Chatham Dockyard (tail fin livery)|Chatham Dockyard]]--&gt; Union Flag, based on a design first used on Concorde.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/union-jack-is-back-on-the-worlds-favourite-airline-1098648.html|title=Union Jack is back on the world's favourite airline|work=The Independent|date=7 June 1999|accessdate=28 June 2010 | location=London | first=Warwick | last=Mansell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cabins ==
=== Short haul ===
'''UK Domestic''' is British Airways' [[economy class]] offering on domestic UK flights, with the majority of flights into Heathrow operated by Airbus A320 series aircraft.  The seat pitch is 31&quot; on all aircraft and the aircraft are in a one-class configuration.&lt;ref name = ST/&gt; Food on these services depends on the destination and time of day. On  Domestic services within England before 10&amp;nbsp;am, a hot breakfast baguette is served, while a hot breakfast tray is served on Scottish services. After 10&amp;nbsp;am there is a drinks service with a light snack on all services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/uk-domestic-seating/public/en_gb|title=UK Domestic: On-board|work=British Airways|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British Airways A321 Y cabin, GB (GT) March 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Short haul [[Economy class|Euro Traveller]] cabin.]]

'''Business UK''' operates in exactly the same cabin as UK Domestic but with a fully flexible ticket and pre-flight lounge access.

'''Euro Traveller''' is British Airways' economy class offering on flights from the UK to the rest of Europe. Seat pitch is 31&quot;, except on Airbus A321 aircraft where it is 30&quot;.&lt;ref name = ST/&gt; Food on board depends on the destination &quot;band&quot; (e.g. Band 1 to Paris, Band 2 to Frankfurt, Band 3 to Rome, Band 4 to Athens). Band 1 and 2 receive a bar service with a choice of sweet or salty snacks, Band 3 receive a filled sub roll and Band 4 flights are served with hot meals. On all flights before 10&amp;nbsp;am, a cold breakfast roll and a drinks service is offered.
[[In-flight entertainment|In-Flight Entertainment]] (IFE) is offered on Band 4 flights on all 767-300ER aircraft and on some A320 flights where an IFE system is fitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/euro-traveller-seating/public/en_gb|title=Euro Traveller: On-board|work=British Airways|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Club Europe''' is the short-haul business class product offered by British Airways on all short-haul flights (except within the UK). Passengers have access to business lounges at most airports and are also served a full English breakfast in the mornings or 'extended breakfast' on later flights (ham, salami etc.) and afternoon tea later in the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/club-europe-lounges/public/en_gb|title=Club Europe: Lounges|work=British Airways|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/club-europe-dining/public/en_gb|title=Club Europe: In-flight dining|work=British Airways|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Club Europe seat pitch is 31&quot;, the same as in Euro Traveller on most aircraft. Club Europe used to offer the same number of seats across as Euro Traveller, but with the middle seats kept free. Since 2 September 2009, Club Europe has seats in a 2–3 configuration on narrow-body aircraft; this change is being implemented progressively across the fleet. The remaining middle seat in the new configuration is also being kept free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/ba6.jsp/wider-club-europe/public/en_gb|title=Wider seats in Club Europe|work=British Airways|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Club Europe was originally launched on 5 January 1988, along with Club World, British Airways' long-haul business class cabin.&lt;ref name = BAP/&gt;

=== Long haul ===
'''First''' (rebranded from 'FIRST' in 2009) is the long-haul [[first class (aviation)|first class]] service on British Airways and is offered only on Boeing 747 and Boeing 777 aircraft. There are 14 private &quot;demi-cabins&quot; per aircraft, each with a {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} bed, a 15&amp;nbsp;inch wide in-flight entertainment screen, in-seat power for laptops and personal phones. Menus are upgraded from Club World, British Airways' long-haul business class product, and offer greater choice and quality. Some airports boast dedicated First check-in desks but in airports without a dedicated First check-in, passengers use Club World check-in. 

[[File:BA New Club World seat.jpg|thumb|A Next-Generation [[Business class|Club World]] seat.]]

In 2009, British Airways announced that the first major upgrade to the cabin since 1996 was to be inaugurated by January 2010, with a minor refresh taking place immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/cms/global/microsites/ba_reports/business_review/br_future.html|title=British Airways 2007/08 Annual Report and Accounts|work=British Airways|accessdate=3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this upgrade program, British Airways has introduced a private concierge service provided by Quintessentially exclusively for First passengers. The new cabin was originally meant to have been launched on the London – New York Route, but due to the US East Coast Snowstorm the new cabin was launched on 10 February 2010, on the London-Chicago Route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/news/article7007869.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1|title= Times report on BA First Class | work=The Times | first=Chris | last=Haslam | date=31 January 2010 | accessdate=1 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The majority of the longhaul fleet based at Gatwick Airport do not feature First as they fly predominantly to high capacity family holiday destinations – instead they carry a 3 class configuration of Club World, World Traveller Plus and World Traveller.

'''Club World''' is the long-haul [[business class]] product on British Airways 767, 777 and 747 aircraft, and the only class on its two Airbus A318 aircraft. Passengers have access to departure lounges at most airports and an exclusive arrivals lounge at London Heathrow Terminal 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/cwonarrival/public/en_gb|title=Club World: On arrival|work=British Airways|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = CWL&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/club-world-lounges/public/en_gb|title=Club World: Lounges|work=British Airways|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 November 2006, British Airways launched a new Club World service, termed Next Generation New Club World, offering larger seats and a service revamp. The Club World cabin provides a {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=on}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} long fully flat bed ({{convert|6|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} long in Next Generation New Club World cabins when in Z-bed position, which is not fully flat). There are 24 old generation Club World seats fitted on Boeing 767-300ER aircraft but these aircraft will be replaced by the Boeing 787 which will feature the Next-Generation Club World cabin from 2012 onwards. There are 48 Next-Generation Club World seats on all of British Airways' Boeing 777s and since 2007 there are either 52 or 70 Next-Generation seats on Boeing 747–400 aircraft. Club World was originally launched on 5 January 1988, along with British Airways' short-haul business class product, Club Europe.&lt;ref name = BAP/&gt;

[[File:BA World Traveller cabin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Economy class|World Traveller]] cabin.]]'''World Traveller Plus''' is the [[premium economy]] offering provided by British Airways on all long-haul aircraft. World Traveller Plus features a 38&amp;nbsp;inch seat pitch, 7&amp;nbsp;inches more than World Traveller (British Airways' long-haul economy class).&lt;ref name = ST&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airlinequality.com/Product/seats_europe.htm|title=British Airways seat-pitch guide|work=Skytrax|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also provides fewer seats per row, two armrests per seat, an adjustable headrest, lumbar support, additional recline and in-seat laptop power.&lt;ref name = WTP&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/world-traveller-plus-seating/public/en_gb|title= World Traveller Plus Information|work=British Airways|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; World Traveller Plus is situated in a separate cabin from World Traveller and in a quieter location of the aircraft.&lt;ref name = WTP/&gt; A new World Traveller Plus Cabin was revealed on 28 August 2010 along with a new [[Thales]] Entertainment System. This cabin is available on the 777-300ER and will be rolled out across the entire longhaul fleet within the next 2 years. World Traveller Plus was originally launched in 2000.&lt;ref name = WTPNC&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/new-world-traveller-plus/public/en_gb|title= World Traveller Plus – Preview our new Cabin|work=British Airways|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Traveller''' is the long-haul [[economy class]] offered on international flights by British Airways to destinations outside Europe. World Traveller offers a 31&quot; seat pitch, lumbar support and fully adjustable headrests, seat-back entertainment systems, a free bar-service and complimentary three-course meals.

==== Special cabin configuration ====
In 2001, British Airways became the first carrier to introduce a ten-abreast economy class configuration on the [[Boeing 777]], an aircraft which is designed for nine-abreast seating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Boeing 777: Jetliner for a New Century|work=Investor's Business Daily|date=20 June 2001|last=Haddock|first=Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; This utilised specially built narrow seats and aisles, and was applied to three GE-engined 777-200ERs used predominantly on Caribbean routes, but sometimes flown to and from Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7345603_ITM|title=Squeeze Picking Right Plane For Best Seats|work=Zenith Imprint|year=2008|last=Birtles|first=Philip|isbn=0760305811}}&lt;/ref&gt; After British Airways piloted this development, the configuration has been emulated by [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Air France]], [[KLM]] and [[China Southern Airlines]] among others. British Airways has since removed this unpopular arrangement, returning to standard nine-abreast seating.

===Seating policies===
{{Main|Airline sex discrimination policy controversy}}
In March 2001, it was revealed that British Airways has a [[Airline sex discrimination policy|policy]] of not seating adult male passengers next to children who are sitting by themselves, even if a child's parents are elsewhere on the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Revealed: How BA bans men sitting next to children they don't know|work=Daily Mail |location=UK|date=4 November 2006|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=414550&amp;in_page_id=1770|accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to accusations of [[sex discrimination]], with the company eventually admitting the offence in 2010 during a case brought by Mirko Fischer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=BA seat policy made man 'feel like a child molester'|publisher=BBC News|date=24 June 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/10182869.stm|accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was dropped in August 2010 with the airline instead seating unaccompanied minors in a non discriminatory manner near the cabin crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/7957982/British-Airways-changes-discriminatory-seating-policy-for-men.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=British Airways changes 'discriminatory' seating policy for men | first=Alastair | last=Jamieson | date=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Airport lounges ==
[[File:British Airways Heathrow Concorde Room.jpg|thumb||British Airways Concorde Room at Heathrow Terminal 5A.]]

British Airways operates several different types of lounge for passengers travelling in the premium cabins and passengers with Silver or Gold status in the Executive Club, British Airways' main loyalty programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/lounges/public/en_gb|title=Lounges|work=British Airways|accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Club World and Club Europe passengers, British Airways' business classes, as well as Silver Executive Club card holders are entitled to use the 70 dedicated British Airways Terraces or Executive Club lounges.&lt;ref name = CWL/&gt; Both these lounges are being replaced by Galleries Club lounges. 

First passengers, as well as Gold Executive Club card holders, are entitled to use the 60 dedicated British Airways First lounges. The Concorde Room at Heathrow Terminal 5 and New York JFK Terminal 7 are only accessible to First travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/first-lounges/public/en_gb|title=First Lounges|work=British Airways|accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; First lounges are being replaced by Galleries First lounges, an upgraded version of the First lounge. 

At airports in which BA does not operate a departure lounge, a third party departure lounge is usually provided for premium/status passengers. A third party arrivals lounge is provided at Gatwick Airport within the Sofitel hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/ecbenftloungelist/public/en_gb|title=Lounge locations|work=British Airways|accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Loyalty programmes ==
[[File:British Airways Executive Club Logo.png|thumb|British Airways Executive Club logo]]

British Airways operates two loyalty, or frequent-flyer, schemes; the Executive Club is the primary programme and the other, highly exclusive, programme is known simply as Premier.

'''Executive Club'''

The Executive Club is part of the network of frequent flyer programmes in the [[Oneworld|'''one'''world]] alliance and is split into three tiers of membership: Blue, Silver and Gold. The benefits of the Silver and Gold cards include access to airport lounges and dedicated reservation lines.&lt;ref name=execclub&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/consumer_affairs/article711216.ece|title=Now you can fly further with air loyalty plans|work=The Times|accessdate=13 June 2009| first=Jessica | last=Bown | date=30 April 2006 | location=London}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most airlines' frequent flyer programmes, the Executive Club keeps separate account of the redeemable '''BA Miles''' and the loyalty '''Tier Points'''. Flying in higher Classes of Service, i.e. Premium Economy, Business or First, will earn extra BA Miles and Tier Points. As of August 2009, Tier Points can be earned on any flight, including discounted economy fares.&lt;ref name=execclubnew&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/epic/bay/6073303/British-Airways-extends-loyalty-scheme-to-passengers-on-cheapest-fares.html|title=British Airways extends loyalty scheme to passengers on cheapest fares|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=25 August 2009| first=Alastair | last=Jamieson | date=22 August 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Premier'''

BA operates an invitation-only Premier programme which gives more benefits than the Executive Club Gold Card scheme including an increased number of BA miles per flight and access to the Concorde Lounge regardless of travel class. It is given only by the BA board and has 1,200 members{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

[[File:BA38 Crash.jpg|thumb|The damaged British Airways Flight 38]]
* On 17 January 2008, [[British Airways Flight 38]], a [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] ''G-YMMM'', flying from Beijing to London, crash-landed approximately {{convert|1000|ft|m}} short of London Heathrow Airport's runway 27L, and slid onto the runway's [[Displaced threshold|threshold]]. This resulted in damage to the landing gear, the wing roots, and the engines, resulting in the first hull loss of a Boeing 777. There were 136 passengers and 16 crew on board. 1 serious and 12 minor injuries were sustained. The initial report from the [[Air Accidents Investigation Branch]] stated that the engines repeatedly failed to respond to commands for more [[thrust]] from both the [[autothrottle]] system and from manual intervention, beginning when the aircraft was at an altitude of {{convert|600|ft|m}} and {{convert|2|mi|km}} from touchdown.&lt;ref name=AAIB080118&gt;{{Cite news|title=Accident to Boeing 777–236, G-YMMM at London Heathrow Airport on 17&amp;nbsp;January 2008: Initial Report|date=18 January 2008|work=Air Accidents Investigation Branch|url=http://www.aaib.dft.gov.uk/latest_news/archive/heathrow_17_january_2008/accident__heathrow_17_january_2008___initial_report.cfm|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, it was revealed that ice in the fuel might have caused the crash.

[[File:Marin bike.jpg|250px|thumb|A [[mountain bike]], a popular multi-use bicycle.]]

A '''bicycle''', also known as a '''bike''', '''pushbike''' or '''cycle''', is a pedal-driven, [[human-powered transport|human-powered]], [[single-track vehicle]], having two [[bicycle wheel|wheels]] attached to a [[bicycle frame|frame]], one behind the other. A person who rides a bicycle is called a '''[[Cycling|cyclist]]''' or a '''bicyclist'''. 

Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number about one billion worldwide, twice as many as automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;DidYouKnow.org. [http://www.didyouknow.org/bicycles.htm There are about a billion or more bicycles in the world.]. Retrieved 30 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They are the principal [[Mode of transport|means of transportation]] in many regions.{{where?}} They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for such uses as children's toys, adult fitness, military and police applications, courier services and [[bicycle racing]].

The basic shape and configuration of a typical [[upright bicycle]] has changed little since the first chain-driven model was developed around 1885.&lt;ref name=&quot;herlihy&quot;&gt;{{cite book

| year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many details have been improved, especially since the advent of modern materials and [[computer-aided design]]. These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for particular types of [[cycling]].

The invention of the bicycle has had an enormous impact on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing modern industrial methods. Several components that eventually played a key role in the development of the automobile were originally invented for the bicycle, including [[ball bearings]], [[pneumatic tires]], chain-driven [[sprockets]], and [[spoke]]-tensioned wheels.&lt;ref&gt;Heitmann JA. The Automobile and American Life. McFarland, 2009, ISBN 0786440139, pp. 11 and following&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the bicycle}}

Being the first human means of transport to use only two wheels in [[tandem]], the [[Draisienne]], [[Laufmaschine]], or [[dandy horse]], invented by the German [[Freiherr|Baron]] [[Karl Drais|Karl von Drais]], is regarded as the forerunner of the modern bicycle. It was introduced by Drais to the public in [[Mannheim]] in summer 1817 and in Paris in 1818.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSTM&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Michauxjun.jpg|thumb|left|Michaux' son on velocipede 1868]]
[[File:McCall1869.jpg|thumb|Thomas McCall in 1869 on his velocipede]]
The first mechanically-propelled 2-wheel vehicle was built by [[Kirkpatrick MacMillan]], a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839. He is also associated with the first recorded instance of a cycling traffic offence, when a [[Glasgow]] newspaper reported in 1842 an accident in which an anonymous &quot;gentleman from Dumfries-shire... bestride a velocipede... of ingenious design&quot;  knocked over a little girl in Glasgow and was fined five [[shilling]]s. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13040607|title=Is dangerous cycling a problem?|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=13 April 2011|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1860s, Frenchmen [[Pierre Michaux]] and [[Pierre Lallement]] took bicycle design in a new direction by adding a mechanical [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] drive with pedals on an enlarged front wheel (the [[velocipede]]). Another French inventor by the name of Douglas Grasso had a failed prototype of Pierre Lallement's bicycle several years earlier. Several inventions followed using rear wheel drive, the best known being the rod-driven velocipede by Scotsman [[Thomas McCall]] in 1869. The French creation, made of iron and wood, developed into the &quot;[[penny-farthing]]&quot; (historically known as an &quot;ordinary bicycle&quot;, a [[retronym]], since there was then no other kind).&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, Glen. ''The Ride to Modernity: The Bicycle in Canada, 1869-1900'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001), p.50, citing Derek Roberts.&lt;/ref&gt; It featured a tubular steel frame on which were mounted wire-spoked wheels with solid rubber tires. These bicycles were difficult to ride due to their very high seat and poor [[weight distribution]].  In 1868 a Michaux cycle was brought to [[Coventry]], England by Rowley Turner, sales agent of the Coventry Sewing Machine Company (which soon became the Coventry Machinist Company).  His uncle, Josiah Turner, together with business partner [[James Starley]] used this as a basis for the 'Coventry Model' in what became Britain's first cycle factory.&lt;ref&gt;McGrory, David. ''A History of Coventry'' (Chichester: Phillimore, 2003), p.221.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ordinary bicycle01.jpg|thumb|A ''[[penny-farthing]]'' or ''ordinary bicycle'' photographed in the [[Škoda Auto]] museum in the [[Czech Republic]]]]

[[File:BicyclePlymouth.jpg|thumb|left|Bicycle in [[Plymouth, England|Plymouth]], England at the start of the 20th century]]
The ''dwarf ordinary'' addressed some of these faults by reducing the front wheel diameter and setting the seat further back. This necessitated the addition of gearing, effected in a variety of ways, to efficiently use the power available. However, having to both pedal and steer via the front wheel remained a problem. [[John Kemp Starley|J. K. Starley]] (nephew of James Starley), J. H. Lawson, and Shergold solved this problem by introducing the [[chain drive]] (originated by the unsuccessful &quot;bicyclette&quot; of Englishman Henry Lawson),&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; connecting the frame-mounted cranks to the rear wheel. These models were known as ''dwarf safeties'', or ''safety bicycles'', for their lower seat height and better weight distribution.  (Although without pneumatic tires the ride of the smaller wheeled bicycle would be much rougher than that of the larger wheeled variety.) Starley's 1885 Rover, manufactured in Coventry, England,&lt;ref&gt;McGrory, p.222.&lt;/ref&gt; is usually described as the first recognizably modern bicycle. Soon, the ''seat tube'' was added, creating the double-triangle ''diamond frame'' of the modern bike.

Further innovations increased comfort and ushered in a second [[bicycle craze]], the 1890s' ''Golden Age of Bicycles''. In 1888, Scotsman [[John Boyd Dunlop]] introduced the first practical [[pneumatic tire]], which soon became universal. Soon after, the rear [[freewheel]] was developed, enabling the rider to coast. This refinement led to the 1890s invention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[coaster brake]]s. [[Derailleur gears]] and hand-operated [[Bicycle brake systems|cable-pull brakes]] were also developed during these years, but were only slowly adopted by casual riders. By the turn of the century, [[cycling club]]s flourished on both sides of the Atlantic, and touring and racing became widely popular.

Bicycles and horse buggies were the two mainstays of private transportation just prior to the automobile, and the grading of smooth roads in the late 19th century was stimulated by the widespread advertising, production, and use of these devices.

==Technical aspects==
[[File:Half Wheeler - bike.JPG|right|thumb|A Half Wheeler [[trailer bike]] at the Golden Gate Bridge]]
The bicycle has undergone continual adaptation and improvement since its inception. These innovations have continued with the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design, allowing for a proliferation of specialized bicycle types.

===Types===
{{Main|List of bicycle types}}

[[File:BMX bicycle.JPG|left|thumb|A [[BMX bike]], an example of a bicycle designed for sport]] Bicycles can be categorized in different ways: e.g. by function, by number of riders, by general construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion. The more common types include [[utility bicycle]]s, [[mountain bicycle]]s, [[racing bicycle]]s, [[touring bicycle]]s, [[hybrid bicycle]]s, [[cruiser bicycle]]s, and [[BMX bike|BMX Bikes]]. Less common are [[tandem bicycle|tandems]], [[Lowrider bicycle|lowriders]], [[tall bike]]s, [[Fixed-gear bicycle|fixed gear]], [[folding bicycle|folding models]], [[amphibious bicycles]] and [[recumbent bicycle|recumbents]] (one of which was used to set the [[Hour record#IHPVA Hour record|IHPVA Hour record]]).

[[Unicycle]]s, [[tricycle]]s and [[Quadracycle (human-powered vehicle)|quadracycle]]s are not strictly bicycles, as they have respectively one, three and four wheels, but are often referred to informally as &quot;bikes&quot;.

The combined center of mass of a bicycle and its rider must lean into a turn to successfully navigate it. This lean is induced by a method known as [[countersteering]], which can be performed by the rider turning the handlebars directly with the hands&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;{{cite book

===Performance===
{{Main|Bicycle performance}}
The bicycle is extraordinarily efficient in both biological and mechanical terms. The bicycle is the most efficient self-powered means of transportation in terms of energy a person must expend to travel a given distance.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bicycle Technology&quot;, S.S. Wilson, [[Scientific American]], March 1973&lt;/ref&gt; From a mechanical viewpoint, up to 99% of the energy delivered by the rider into the pedals is transmitted to the wheels, although the use of gearing mechanisms may reduce this by 10–15%.&lt;ref&gt;

In terms of the ratio of cargo weight a bicycle can carry to total weight, it is also an efficient means of cargo transportation.

[[File:Corsa bacchetta.jpg|thumb|left|A [[recumbent bicycle]] ]]

A human traveling on a bicycle at low to medium speeds of around 10–15&amp;nbsp;mph (15–25&amp;nbsp;km/h) uses only the energy required to walk. Air drag, which is proportional to the square of speed, requires dramatically higher power outputs as speeds increase. If the rider is sitting upright, the rider's body creates about 75% of the total drag of the bicycle/rider combination. Drag can be reduced by seating the rider in a [[supine position]] or a [[prone position]], thus creating a [[recumbent bicycle]] or [[human powered vehicle]]. Drag can also be reduced by covering the bicycle with an aerodynamic [[Bicycle fairing|fairing]].

In addition, the [[carbon dioxide]] generated in the production and transportation of the food required by the bicyclist, per mile traveled, is less than 1/10 that generated by energy efficient cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenkifer.com/bikepages/advocacy/bike_co2.htm How Much Do Bicycles Pollute?

===Construction and parts===
In its early years, bicycle construction drew on pre-existing technologies. More recently, bicycle technology has in turn contributed ideas in both old and new areas.

====Frame====
{{Main|Bicycle frame}}

[[File:Bicycle diagram-en.svg|thumb|Diagram of a bicycle.]]

The great majority of today's bicycles have a frame with upright seating which looks much like the first chain-driven bike.&lt;ref name=&quot;herlihy&quot;&gt;{{cite book
| title = Bicycle: the history
| last = Herlihy
| first = David V.

Such [[upright bicycle]]s almost always feature the ''diamond frame'', a [[truss]] consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down tube and seat tube. The head tube contains the [[headset (bicycle part)|headset]], the set of bearings that allows the [[bicycle fork|fork]] to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The top tube connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the [[bottom bracket]]. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the [[bicycle chain|chain]], connecting the bottom bracket to the rear [[Dropout (bicycle part)|fork ends]]. The seat stays connect the top of the seat tube (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.

[[File:Triumph Bicycle.JPG|left|thumb|A [[Triumph Cycle Co. Ltd.|Triumph]] with a [[step-through frame]].]]
Historically, women's bicycle frames had a top tube that connected in the middle of the seat tube instead of the top, resulting in a lower [[Frame geometry|standover height]] at the expense of compromised structural integrity, since this places a strong bending load in the seat tube, and bicycle frame members are typically weak in bending. This design, referred to as a ''[[step-through frame]]'', allows the rider to mount and dismount in a dignified way while wearing a skirt or dress. While some women's bicycles continue to use this frame style, there is also a variation, the ''[[mixte]]'', which splits the top tube laterally into two thinner top tubes that bypass the seat tube on each side and connect to the rear fork ends. The ease of stepping through is also appreciated by those with limited flexibility or other joint problems. Because of its persistent image as a &quot;women's&quot; bicycle, step-through frames are not common for larger frames.

Another style is the [[recumbent bicycle]]. These are inherently more [[aerodynamic]] than upright versions, as the rider may lean back onto a support and operate pedals that are on about the same level as the seat. The world's fastest bicycle is a recumbent bicycle but this type was banned from competition in 1934 by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recumbent-bikes-truth-for-you.com/history.html History Loudly Tells Why The Recumbent Bike Is Popular Today&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, materials used in bicycles have followed a similar pattern as in aircraft, the goal being high strength and low weight. Since the late 1930s alloy steels have been used for frame and fork tubes in higher quality machines. [[Celluloid]] found application in mudguards, and [[Aluminium alloy|aluminum alloys]] are increasingly used in components such as handlebars, [[Seatpost|seat post]], and brake levers. In the 1980s aluminum alloy frames became popular for their lightness, and their affordability now makes them common. More expensive carbon fiber and titanium frames are now also available, as well as advanced steel alloys and even bamboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bamboo bikes|work=AboutMyPlanet.com|last=Lukenbill|first=Jen|date=13 February 2008|url=http://www.aboutmyplanet.com/environment/bamboo-bikes/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drivetrain and gearing====
[[File:Shimano xt rear derailleur.jpg|right|thumb|A set of rear sprockets (also known as a cassette) and a derailleur]]

{{details|Bicycle drivetrain systems}}
The ''drivetrain'' begins with [[bicycle pedal|pedals]] which rotate the [[Crank set|cranks]], which are held in axis by the [[bottom bracket]]. Most bicycles use a chain to transmit power to the rear wheel. A relatively small number of bicycles use a shaft drive to transmit power. A very small number of bicycles (mainly [[single-speed bicycle]]s intended for short-distance commuting) use a belt drive as an oil-free way of transmitting power.

Since cyclists' legs are most efficient over a narrow range of pedaling speeds ([[Cadence (cycling)|cadence]]), a variable [[gear ratio]] helps a cyclist to maintain an optimum pedalling speed while covering varied terrain. As a first approximation, [[utility bicycle]]s often use a [[hub gear]] with a small number (3 to 8) of widely spaced gears, [[road bicycle]]s and [[racing bicycle]]s use [[derailleur gears]] with a moderate number (10 to 22) of closely spaced gear ratios, while [[mountain bike|mountain bicycles]], [[hybrid bicycle]]s, and [[touring bicycle]]s use dérailleur gears with a larger number (15 to 33) of moderately spaced gear ratios, often including an extremely low gear (&quot;granny gear&quot;) for climbing steep hills.

Different gears and ranges of gears are appropriate for different people and styles of cycling. Multi-speed bicycles allow gear selection to suit the circumstances: a cyclist could use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill. In a lower gear every turn of the pedals leads to fewer rotations of the rear wheel. This allows the energy required to move the same distance to be distributed over more pedal turns, reducing fatigue when riding uphill, with a heavy load, or against strong winds. A higher gear allows a cyclist to make fewer pedal turns to maintain a given speed, but with more effort per turn of the pedals.

[[File:Dsb-1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Shaft-driven bicycle|bicycle with shaft drive]] instead of a chain]]

With a ''chain drive'' transmission, a ''chainring'' attached to a crank drives the [[bicycle chain|chain]], which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear [[sprocket]](s) ([[cassette (bicycle part)|cassette]] or [[Cogset#Freewheels|freewheel]]). There are four gearing options: two-speed hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 sprockets, hub gear built in to rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple sprockets (other combinations of options are possible but less common).

With a [[Shaft-driven bicycle|''shaft drive'']] transmission, a gear set at the bottom bracket turns the shaft, which then turns the rear wheel via a gear set connected to the wheel's hub. There is some small loss of efficiency due to the two gear sets needed. The only gearing option with a shaft drive is to use a [[hub gear]].

====Steering and seating====
The [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebars]] turn the [[bicycle fork|fork]] and the front wheel via the [[Stem (bike)|stem]], which rotates within the [[headset (bicycle part)|headset]]. Three styles of handlebar are common. ''Upright handlebars'', the norm in Europe and elsewhere until the 1970s, curve gently back toward the rider, offering a natural grip and comfortable upright position. ''Drop handlebars'' &quot;drop&quot; as they curve forward and down, offering the cyclist best braking power from a more aerodynamic &quot;crouched&quot; position, as well as more upright positions in which the hands grip the brake lever mounts, the forward curves, or the upper flat sections for increasingly upright postures. Mountain bikes generally feature a 'straight handlebar' or 'riser bar' with varying degrees of sweep backwards and centimeters rise upwards, as well as wider widths which can provide better handling due to increased leverage against the wheel.

[[File:San marco selle1.jpg|thumb|left|A Selle San Marco saddle designed for women]]
[[Bicycle saddle|Saddles]] also vary with rider preference, from the cushioned ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow more room for leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist for male and female cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men.

A recumbent bicycle has a reclined [[Bicycle seat|chair-like seat]] that some riders find more comfortable than a saddle, especially riders who suffer from certain types of seat, back, neck, shoulder, or wrist pain. Recumbent bicycles may have either under-seat or over-seat [[Recumbent bicycle#Steering|steering]].

====Brakes====
{{Main|Bicycle brake systems}}
[[File:Brake.agr-edit.jpg|thumb|Linear-pull brake, also known by the [[Shimano]] trademark: V-Brake, on rear wheel of a [[mountain bike]]]]
Modern bicycle ''brakes'' may be: ''rim brakes'', in which friction pads are compressed against the wheel rims; ''internal hub brakes'', in which the friction pads are contained within the wheel hubs; or ''disc brakes'', with a separate rotor for braking. [[Disc brakes]] are more common for off-road bicycles, [[tandem bicycle|tandem]]s and recumbent bicycles than on road-specific bicycles.

[[File:BrakeDiskVR.JPG|thumb|left|A front disc brake, mounted to the [[Bicycle fork|fork]] and hub]]
With hand-operated brakes, force is applied to brake levers mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via [[Bowden cable]]s or hydraulic lines to the friction pads. A rear hub brake may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal ''coaster brakes'' which were popular in North America until the 1960s, and are common in children's bicycles.

[[Track bicycle]]s do not have dedicated brakes. Brakes are not required for riding on a track because all riders ride in the same direction around a track which does not necessitate sharp deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all track bicycles are [[Fixed-gear bicycle|fixed-gear]], meaning that there is no [[freewheel]]. Without a freewheel, coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is moving, the crank is moving. To slow down, the rider applies resistance to the pedals &amp;ndash; this acts as a braking system which can be as effective as a friction-based rear wheel brake, but not as effective as a front wheel brake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Suspension====
{{Main|Bicycle suspension}}

Bicycle suspension refers to the system or systems used to ''suspend'' the rider and all or part of the bicycle. This serves two purposes:

* To keep the wheels in continuous contact with rough surfaces to improve control.

* To isolate the rider and luggage from jarring due to rough surfaces.

Bicycle suspensions are used primarily on mountain bicycles, but are also common on hybrid bicycles, and can even be found on some road bicycles, as they can help deal with problematic vibration. Suspension is especially important on recumbent bicycles, since while an upright bicycle rider can stand on the pedals to achieve some of the benefits of suspension, a recumbent rider cannot.

====Wheels and tires====
{{Main|Bicycle wheel}}

The wheel axle fits into [[Dropout (bicycle part)|fork ends]] in the [[bicycle frame|frame]] and [[bicycle fork|forks]]. A pair of wheels may be called a wheelset, especially in the context of ready-built &quot;off the shelf&quot;, performance-oriented wheels.

{{Main|Bicycle tire}}

Tires vary enormously. Skinny 18 to 25 millimeters wide, road-racing tires may be completely smooth, or ([[slick tire|slick]]). On the opposite extreme, off-road tires are 38 to 64 millimeters wide and usually have a deep tread for gripping in muddy conditions or metal studs for ice.

====Accessories, repairs, and tools====
[[File:Loaded touring bicycle.JPG|right|thumb|Touring bicycle equipped with front and rear [[Luggage carrier|racks]], fenders/mud-guards, water bottles in [[Bottle cage|cages]], four panniers and a handlebar bag.]]
[[File:Puncture-repaire-kit.jpg|right|thumb|Puncture repair kit with tire levers, sandpaper to clean off an area of the inner tube around the puncture, a tube of rubber solution (vulcanizing fluid), round and oval patches, a metal grater and piece of chalk to make chalk powder (to dust over excess rubber solution). Kits often also include a wax crayon to mark the puncture location.]]

Some components, which are often optional accessories on sports bicycles, are standard features on [[utility bicycles]] to enhance their usefulness and comfort. [[Mudguard]]s, or [[Fender (vehicle)|fender]]s, protect the cyclist and [[moving parts]] from spray when riding through wet areas and [[chainguard]]s protect clothes from oil on the chain while preventing clothing from being caught between the chain and [[crankset]] teeth. [[Kick stand]]s keep a bicycle upright when parked, while a [[bike lock]] will help prevent it from being stolen. Front-mounted [[bicycle basket|baskets]] for carrying goods are often used. [[Luggage carrier]]s and [[pannier]]s mounted above the rear tire can be used to carry equipment or cargo. Parents sometimes add rear-mounted [[Baby transport|child seats]] and/or an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar to transport children.

[[Clipless#Clipless pedals|''Toe-clips'']] and ''toestraps'' and [[Bicycle pedal#Clipless pedals|clipless pedals]] help keep the foot locked in the proper position on the pedals, and enable the cyclist to pull as well as push the pedals&amp;mdash;although not without their hazards, e.g. may lock foot in when needed to prevent a fall. Technical accessories include [[cyclocomputer]]s for measuring speed, distance, heart rate, GPS data etc. Other accessories include [[bicycle lighting|lights]], reflectors, [[Bicycle lock|security locks]], mirror, water bottles and [[Bottle cage|cages]], and bell.&lt;ref name=&quot;bicycleuniverse&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bicycleuniverse.info/eqp/accessories.html#safety |title=Safety Accessories |accessdate=2006-09-13 |last=Bluejay |first=Michael |work=Bicycle Accessories |publisher=BicycleUniverse.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bicycle helmet]]s may help reduce injury in the event of a collision or accident, and a certified helmet is legally required for some riders in some jurisdictions. Helmets are classified as an accessory&lt;ref name=&quot;bicycleuniverse&quot; /&gt; or an item of clothing by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bicycling.about.com/library/weekly/aa041098.htm |title=The Essentials of Bike Clothing |accessdate=2006-09-13 |work=About Bicycling |publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cyclists carry ''tool kits''. These may include a tire patch kit (which, in turn, may contain any combination of a [[Bicycle pump|hand pump]] or [[Bicycle pump#CO2 Inflators|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Pump]], [[tire lever]]s, spare [[Inner tube|tubes]], self-adhesive patches, or tube-patching material, an adhesive, a piece of sandpaper or a metal grater (for roughing the tube surface to be patched),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are also cycling specific [[multi-tool]]s that combine many of these implements into a single compact device. More specialized bicycle components may require more complex tools, including proprietary tools specific for a given manufacturer.

Some bicycle parts, particularly hub-based gearing systems, are complex, and many cyclists prefer to leave [[repair and maintenance|maintenance and repairs]] to professional [[bicycle mechanic]]s. In some areas it is possible to purchase road-side assistance from companies such as the [[Better World Club]]. Other cyclists maintain their own bicycles, perhaps as part of their enjoyment of the hobby of cycling or simply for economic reasons. The ability to repair and maintain your own bicycle is also celebrated within the [[DIY]] movement.

====Standards====
A number of formal and industry standards exist for bicycle components to help make spare parts exchangeable and to maintain a minimum product safety.

The [[International Organization for Standardization]], [[ISO]], has a special technical committee for cycles, TC149, that has the following scope: &quot;Standardization in the field of cycles, their components and accessories with particular reference to terminology, testing methods and requirements for performance and safety, and interchangeability.&quot;

[[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]], European Committee for Standardisation, also has a specific Technical Committee, TC333, that defines European standards for cycles. Their mandate states that EN cycle standards shall harmonize with [[List of ISO standards|ISO standards]]. Some CEN cycle standards were developed before ISO published their standards, leading to strong European influences in this area. European cycle standards tend to describe minimum safety requirements, while ISO standards have historically harmonized parts geometry.&lt;ref&gt;The TC149 ISO bicycle committee, including the TC149/SC1 (&quot;Cycles and major sub-assemblies&quot;) subcommittee, has published the following standards:
* [[ISO 4210]] Cycles&amp;mdash;Safety requirements for bicycles
* [[ISO 6692]] Cycles&amp;mdash;Marking of cycle components
* [[ISO 6695]] Cycles&amp;mdash;Pedal axle and crank assembly with square end fitting&amp;mdash;Assembly dimensions
* [[ISO 6696]] Cycles&amp;mdash;Screw threads used in bottom bracket assemblies

* [[ISO 6701]] Cycles&amp;mdash;External dimensions of spoke nipples
* [[ISO 6742]] Cycles&amp;mdash;Lighting and retro-reflective devices&amp;mdash;Photometric and physical requirements
* [[ISO 8090]] Cycles&amp;mdash;Terminology (same as BS 6102-4)
* [[ISO 8098]] Cycles&amp;mdash;Safety requirements for bicycles for young children
* [[ISO 8488]] Cycles&amp;mdash;Screw threads used to assemble head fittings on bicycle forks
* [[ISO 8562]] Cycles&amp;mdash;Stem wedge angle
* [[ISO 10230]] Cycles&amp;mdash;Splined hub and sprocket&amp;mdash;Mating dimensions
* [[ISO 11243]] Cycles&amp;mdash;Luggage carriers for bicycles&amp;mdash;Concepts, classification and testing

Other ISO Technical Committees have published various cycle relevant standards, for example:
* [[ISO 5775]] Bicycle tire and rim designations
* [[ISO 9633]] Cycle chains&amp;mdash;Characteristics and test methods

Published cycle standards from CEN TC333 include:
* [[EN 14764]] City and trekking bicycles – Safety requirements and test methods
* [[EN 14765]] Bicycles for young children – Safety requirements and test methods
* [[EN 14766]] Mountain-bicycles – Safety requirements and test methods
* [[EN 14781]] Racing bicycles – Safety requirements and test methods
* [[EN 14782]] Bicycles – Accessories for bicycles – Luggage carriers
* [[EN 15496]] Cycles – Requirements and test methods for cycle locks

Yet to be approved cycle standards from CEN TC333:
* [[EN 15194]] Cycles&amp;mdash;Electrically power assisted cycles ([[EPAC]] bicycle)
* [[EN 15532]] Cycles&amp;mdash;Terminology
* 00333011 Cycles – Bicycles trailers – safety requirements and test methods&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and historical aspects==
The bicycle has had a considerable effect on human society, in both the cultural and industrial realms.

===In daily life===

Around the turn of the 20th century, bicycles reduced crowding in inner-city tenements by allowing workers to [[Bicycle commuting|commute]] from more spacious dwellings in the suburbs. They also reduced dependence on horses. Bicycles allowed people to travel for leisure into the country, since bicycles were three times as energy efficient as walking and three to four times as fast.
[[File:Estacio bicing bcn.jpg|left|thumb|A [[bike-sharing]] [[Bicing|station in Barcelona]]]]

Recently, several European cities and [[Montreal]] have implemented successful schemes known as [[community bicycle program]]s or bike-sharing. These initiatives complement a city's public transport system and offer an alternative to motorized traffic to help reduce congestion and pollution. In Europe, especially in The Netherlands and parts of Germany and Denmark, commuting by bicycle is very common. In the Danish capital of [[Copenhagen]], a cyclists' organization runs a ''Cycling Embassy'', that promotes biking for commuting and sightseeing.  In the UK there's a tax break scheme (IR 176) that allows employees to buy a new bicycle tax free to use for commuting.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In The Netherlands, all train stations are equipped with provisions for bicycle parking for a small fee and the larger ones also with bicycle repair shops, and cycling is so popular that the parking capacity is sometimes exceeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Action buses In Canberra, Australia, offers bicycle rack on the front of the bus to allow riders to mount their bicycle free of charge, and previously it would allow bicycle riders to ride on buses for free.

In cities where the bicycle is not an integral part of the planned transportation system, commuters often use bicycles as elements of a [[mixed-mode commuting|mixed-mode commute]], where the bike is used to travel to and from train stations or other forms of rapid transit. [[Folding bicycles]] are useful in these scenarios, as they are less cumbersome when carried aboard. Los Angeles removed a small amount of seating on some trains to make more room for bicycles and wheel chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Bicycles offer an important mode of transport in many developing countries. Until recently, bicycles have been a staple of everyday life throughout Asian countries. They are the most frequently used method of transport for commuting to work, school, shopping, and life in general.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Poverty Alleviation===

Experiments done in Africa (Uganda and Tanzania) and Srilanka on hundreds of households have shown that a bicycle can increase the income of a poor family by as much as 35% &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bicyclepotential.org/&lt;/ref&gt;. Transport, if analyzed for the cost-benefit analysis for rural poverty alleviation, has given one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3-10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. Bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate  poverty in poor nations.


===Female emancipation===

[[File:Woman with Bicycle 1890s.jpg|thumb|right|Woman with bicycle, 1890s]]
The [[safety bicycle]] gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to [[Emancipation of women|their emancipation]] in Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom they embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolize the [[New Woman]] of the late 19th century, especially in Britain and the United States.
The bicycle was recognized by 19th-century feminists and [[suffragist]]s as a &quot;freedom machine&quot; for women. American [[Susan B. Anthony]] said in a ''[[New York World]]'' interview on February 2, 1896: &quot;Let me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel...the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood.&quot; In 1895 Frances Willard, the tightly laced president of the [[Women’s Christian Temperance Union]], wrote a book called ''How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle'', in which she praised the bicycle she learned to ride late in life, and which she named &quot;Gladys&quot;, for its &quot;gladdening effect&quot; on her health and political optimism. Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action, proclaiming, &quot;I would not waste my life in friction when it could be turned into momentum.&quot;

The [[bicycle craze]] in the 1890s also led to a movement for so-called [[rational dress]], which helped liberate women from corsets and ankle-length skirts and other restrictive garments, substituting the then-shocking [[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]].

===Economic implications===
[[File:Columbia Bicycles 1886 Advertisement.svg|left|thumb|[[Columbia Bicycles]] advertisement from 1886]]
Bicycle manufacturing proved to be a training ground for other industries and led to the development of advanced metalworking techniques, both for the frames themselves and for special components such as [[Bearing (mechanical)|ball bearings]], [[washer (mechanical)|washer]]s, and [[sprocket]]s. These techniques later enabled skilled metalworkers and mechanics to develop the components used in early automobiles and aircraft.

They also served to teach the industrial models later adopted, including mechanization and [[mass production]] (later copied and adopted by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors]]),&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, Glen. ''The Ride to Modernity: The Bicycle in Canada, 1869-1900'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001), pp.23, 106, &amp; 108. GM's practice of sharing chassis, bodies, and other parts is exactly what the early bicycle manufacturer Pope was doing.&lt;/ref&gt; vertical integration&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, p.106.&lt;/ref&gt; (also later copied and adopted by Ford), aggressive advertising&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, pp.142–47.&lt;/ref&gt; (as much as 10% of all advertising in U.S. periodicals in 1898 was by bicycle makers),&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, p.145.&lt;/ref&gt; lobbying for better roads (which had the side benefit of acting as advertising, and of improving sales by providing more places to ride),&lt;ref name=&quot;Norcliffe, p.108&quot;&gt;Norcliffe, p.108.&lt;/ref&gt; all first practised by Pope.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norcliffe, p.108&quot; /&gt; In addition, bicycle makers adopted the annual model change&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Babaian, Sharon. ''The Most Benevolent Machine: A Historical Assessment of Cycles in Canada'' (Ottawa: National Museum of Science and Technology, 1998), p.97.&lt;/ref&gt; (later derided as [[planned obsolescence]], and usually credited to General Motors), which proved very successful.&lt;ref&gt;Babaian, p.98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, early bicycles were an example of [[conspicuous consumption]], being adopted by the fashionable elites.&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, pp.8, 12, 14, 23, 147–8, 187–8, 208, &amp; 243–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, by serving as a platform for accessories, which could ultimately cost more than the bicycle itself, it paved the way for the likes of the [[Barbie doll]].&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, pp.23, 121, &amp; 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, they helped create, or enhance, new kinds of businesses, such as bicycle messengers,&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, p.212.&lt;/ref&gt; travelling seamstresses,&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, p.214.&lt;/ref&gt; riding academies,&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, p.131.&lt;/ref&gt; and racing rinks&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, p.30 &amp; 131.&lt;/ref&gt; (Their board tracks were later adapted to early [[motorcycle racing|motorcycle]] and [[automobile racing]].) Also, there were a variety of new inventions, such as spoke tighteners,&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, p.125.&lt;/ref&gt; and specialized lights,&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, p.123 &amp; 125.&lt;/ref&gt; socks and shoes,&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, p.125 &amp; 126.&lt;/ref&gt; and even cameras (such as the [[Eastman Kodak|Eastman Company]]'s ''Poco'').&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, p.238.&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the best known and most widely used of these inventions, adopted well beyond cycling, is Charles Bennett's Bike Web, which came to be called the &quot;[[jock strap]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, p.128.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Person mit fahrrad feb07.jpg|thumb|A man uses a bicycle to carry goods in [[Ouagadougou]], [[Burkina Faso]]]]
They also presaged a move away from public transit&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, p.214–5.&lt;/ref&gt; that would explode with the introduction of the automobile.

J. K. Starley's company became the Rover Cycle Company Ltd. in the late 1890s, and then simply the [[Rover Company]] when it started making cars. The [[Morris Motor Company]] (in [[Oxford]]) and [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] also began in the bicycle business, as did the [[Wright brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alistair Craig, whose company eventually emerged to become the engine manufacturers [[Ailsa Craig Engines|Ailsa Craig]], also started from manufacturing bicycles, in Glasgow in March 1885.

In general, U.S. and European cycle manufacturers used to assemble cycles from their own frames and components made by other companies, although very large companies (such as Raleigh) used to make almost every part of a bicycle (including bottom brackets, axles, etc.) In recent years, those bicycle makers have greatly changed their methods of production. Now, almost none of them produce their own frames.

Many newer or smaller companies only design and market their products; the actual production is done by Asian companies. For example, some 60% of the world's bicycles are now being made in China. Despite this shift in production, as nations such as [[China]] and [[India]] become more wealthy, their own use of bicycles has declined due to the increasing affordability of cars and motorcycles.&lt;ref&gt;

One of the major reasons for the proliferation of Chinese-made bicycles in foreign markets is the lower cost of labor in China.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Economist]], 15 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the profound economic implications of bicycle use is that it liberates the user from oil consumption (Ballantine, 1972). The bicycle is an inexpensive, fast, healthy and environmentally friendly mode of transport (Illich, 1974)

=== Manufacturing ===

The global bicycle market is $61 billion in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seekingalpha.com/article/133109-high-growth-and-big-margins-in-the-61-billion-bicycle-industry]&lt;/ref&gt; 130 million bicycles are sold every year globally and 66% of them are made in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dare.co.in/opportunities/manufacturing/the-business-of-bicycles.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal requirements===
[[File:Bicycle diagram reflectors.jpg|left|thumb|Reflectors for riding after dark]]

Early in its development, as with [[automobile]]s, there were restrictions on the operation of bicycles. Along with advertising, and to gain free publicity, [[Albert A. Pope]] litigated on behalf of cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;Norcliffe, Glen. ''The Ride to Modernity: The Bicycle in Canada, 1869-1900'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001), p.108.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1968 [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] of the [[United Nations]] considers a bicycle to be a vehicle, and a person controlling a bicycle (whether actually riding or not) is considered an operator. The traffic codes of many countries reflect these definitions and demand that a bicycle satisfy certain legal requirements before it can be used on public roads. In many [[jurisdiction]]s, it is an offense to use a bicycle that is not in a roadworthy condition.

In most jurisdictions, bicycles must have functioning front and rear lights when ridden after dark. As some generator or [[dynamo]]-driven lamps only operate while moving, rear [[retroreflectors|reflectors]] are frequently also mandatory. Since a moving bicycle makes little noise, some countries insist that bicycles have a warning bell for use when approaching pedestrians, equestrians, and other cyclists.

Some countries require child and/or adult cyclists to wear [[Bicycle helmet|helmets]], as this may protect riders from head trauma. Countries which require adult cyclists to wear helmets include Spain, Canada, [[Bicycle helmets in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and Australia.

'''Biopolymers''' are [[polymer]]s produced by living organisms. Since they are [[polymer]]s, Biopolymers contain [[monomeric]] units that are covalently bonded to form larger structures. There are three main classes of biopolymers based on the differing monomeric units used and the structure of the biopolymer formed. [[Polynucleotide]]s long polymers which are composed of 13 or more [[nucleotide]] [[monomers]], [[Polypeptides]] short polymers of amino acids, and [[Polysaccharides]] which are often linear bonded polymeric carbohydrate structures.

&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Biopolymers versus polymers ==

A major but defining difference between polymers and biopolymers can be found in their structures. Polymers, including '''biopolymers''', are made of repetitive units called [[monomer]]s. Biopolymers often have a well-defined structure, though this is not a defining characteristic (example:ligno-cellulose): 
The exact chemical composition and the sequence in which these units are arranged is called the [[primary structure]], in the case of proteins. Many biopolymers spontaneously fold into characteristic compact shapes (see also &quot;[[protein folding]]&quot;  as well as [[secondary structure]] and [[tertiary structure]]), which determine their biological functions and depend in a complicated way on their primary structures. [[Structural biology]] is the study of the structural properties of the biopolymers.
In contrast most '''synthetic polymers''' have much simpler and more random (or stochastic) structures. This fact leads to a molecular mass distribution that is missing in biopolymers.
In fact, as their synthesis is controlled by a template directed process in most in vivo systems all biopolymers of a type (say one specific protein) are all alike: they all contain the similar sequences and numbers of monomers and thus all have the same mass. This phenomenon is called [[monodispersity]] in contrast to the [[polydispersity]] encountered in synthetic polymers. As a result biopolymers have a [[polydispersity index]] of 1.
&lt;ref&gt;
Stupp, S.I and Braun, P.V., &quot;Role of Proteins in Microstructural Control: Biomaterials, Ceramics &amp; Semiconductors&quot;, Science, Vol. 277, p. 1242 (1997)
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conventions and nomenclature ==

=== Polypeptides ===

The convention for a [[polypeptide]] is to list its constituent amino acid residues as they occur from the amino terminus to the carboxylic acid terminus. The amino acid residues are always joined by [[peptide bond]]s. [[Protein]], though used colloquially to refer to any polypeptide, refers to larger or fully functional forms and can consist of several polypeptide chains as well as single chains. Proteins can also be modified to include non-peptide components, such as [[saccharide]] chains and [[lipid]]s.

=== Nucleic acids ===
The convention for a nucleic acid sequence is to list the nucleotides as they occur from the 5' end to the 3' end of the [[polymer chain]], where 5' and 3' refer to the numbering of carbons around the ribose ring which participate in forming the phosphate diester linkages of the chain. Such a sequence is called the primary structure of the biopolymer.

=== Sugars ===
Sugar-based biopolymers are often difficult with regards to convention. Sugar polymers can be linear or branched are typically joined with [[glycosidic bond]]s. However, the exact placement of the linkage can vary and the orientation of the linking functional groups is also important, resulting in α- and β-glycosidic bonds with numbering definitive of the linking carbons' location in the ring. In addition, many saccharide units can undergo various chemical modification, such as [[amination]], and can even form parts of other molecules, such as [[glycoprotein]]s.

== Structural characterization ==
There are a number of [[biophysics|biophysical]] techniques for determining sequence information. [[Peptide sequence|Protein sequence]] can be determined by [[Edman degradation]], in which the N-terminal residues are hydrolyzed from the chain one at a time, derivatized, and then identified. Mass [[spectrometer]] techniques can also be used. Nucleic acid sequence can be determined using gel [[electrophoresis]] and capillary electrophoresis. Lastly, mechanical properties of these biopolymers can often be measured using [[optical tweezers]] or [[atomic force microscopy]]. [[Dual polarisation interferometry]] can be used to measure the conformational changes or self assembly of these materials when stimulated by pH, temperature, ionic strength or other binding partners.

== Biopolymers as materials ==
Some biopolymers- such as [[polylactic acid]] (PLA), naturally occurring [[zein]], and [[poly-3-hydroxybutyrate]] can be used as plastics, replacing the need for [[polystyrene]] or [[polyethylene]] based plastics. 

Some plastics are now referred to as being 'degradable', 'oxy-degradable' or 'UV-degradable'. This means that they break down when exposed to light or air, but these plastics are still primarily (as much as 98 per cent) [[oil]]-based and are not currently certified as 'biodegradable' under the [[European Union directive]] on Packaging and Packaging Waste (94/62/EC). Biopolymers, however, will break down and some are suitable for domestic [[composting]]&lt;ref name=&quot;nnfcc&quot;&gt;[http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-renewable-polymers-factsheet-bioplastics NNFCC Renewable Polymers Factsheet: Bioplastics]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Biopolymers (also called renewable polymers) are produced from [[biomass]] for use in the packaging industry. Biomass comes from crops such as sugar beet, potatoes or wheat: when used to produce biopolymers, these are classified as [[non food crops]]. These can be converted in the following pathways:

Sugar beet &gt; Glyconic acid &gt; Polyglonic acid 

Starch &gt; (fermentation) &gt; [[Lactic acid]] &gt; [[Polylactic acid]] (PLA) 

[[Biomass]] &gt; (fermentation) &gt; [[Bioethanol]] &gt; [[Ethene]] &gt; [[Polyethylene]] 

Many types of packaging can be made from biopolymers: food trays, blown starch pellets for shipping fragile goods, thin films for wrapping.

===Environmental Impacts of Biopolymers===

Biopolymers can be sustainable, carbon neutral and are always [[renewable]], because they are made from plant materials which can be grown year on year indefinitely. These plant materials come from agricultural [[non food crops]]. Therefore, the use of biopolymers would create a [[sustainable]] industry. In contrast, the feedstocks for polymers derived from petrochemicals will eventually run out. In addition, biopolymers have the potential to cut [[carbon emissions]] and reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantities in the atmosphere: this is because the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; released when they degrade can be reabsorbed by crops grown to replace them: this makes them close to [[carbon neutral]].

Biopolymers are biodegradable, and some are also compostable. Some biopolymers are [[biodegradable]]: they are broken down into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water by [[microorganisms]]. Some of these biodegradable biopolymers are [[compostable]]: they can be put into an industrial composting process and will break down by 90% within six months. Biopolymers that do this can be marked with a 'compostable' symbol, under European Standard EN 13432 (2000). Packaging marked with this symbol can be put into industrial composting processes and will break down within six months or less. An example of a compostable polymer is PLA film under 20μm thick: films which are thicker than that do not qualify as compostable, even though they are biodegradable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-newsletter-issue-5-biopolymers-a-renewable-resource-for-the-plastics-industry NNFCC Newsletter – Issue 5. Biopolymers: A Renewable Resource for the Plastics Industry]&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe there is a home composting standard and associated logo that enables consumers to identify and dispose of packaging in their compost heap.

The '''United Kingdom general election, 2001''' was held on Thursday 7 June 2001 to elect [[List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 2001|659 members]] to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]]. It was dubbed &quot;the quiet landslide&quot; by the media, as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was re-elected with another landslide result and only suffered a net loss of 6 seats. [[Tony Blair]] went on to become the first Labour [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] to serve a full second consecutive term in office.

There was little change at all - outside [[Northern Ireland]] - with 620 out of 641 seats remaining unchanged. Labour boasted a strong economy, as well as having delivered on many key election pledges made in 1997. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], under [[William Hague]]'s leadership, was still deeply divided on the issue of [[European Union|Europe]] and the party's policy platform was considered to have shifted to a [[right-wing]] focus. Hague was also hindered by a series of embarrassing publicity stunts, which overshadowed his talents as a skilled orator.

The election was essentially a repeat of the 1997 election, with Labour losing a mere 6 seats overall and the Conservatives making a net gain of 1 seat (gaining 9 seats, but losing 8). The Conservatives did manage to gain a seat in [[Scotland]], which ended the party's status as an 'England-only' party in the 1997-2001 parliament. For the [[Liberal Democrats]], success in the form of 6 new seats was achieved. Conservative leader [[William Hague]] resigned immediately, becoming the first Conservative leader since [[Austen Chamberlain]] to leave office without becoming [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. 

Change was seen in [[Northern Ireland]], with the moderately [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] [[Ulster Unionist Party]] losing 4 seats to the more hardline [[Democratic Unionist Party]]. This transition was mirrored in the [[Irish Republicanism|republican]] community with the moderate [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]] losing votes to the more staunchly republican and abstentionist [[Sinn Fein]]. The election was also marked with exceptionally low voter turnout, falling below 60% for the first time in British history. The election was broadcast live on the BBC, and presented by [[Jeremy Paxman]], [[Andrew Marr]], [[Peter Snow]] and [[David Dimbleby]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6weF6Q37F2w&amp;feature=mfu_in_order&amp;playnext=1&amp;videos=UsHbCo8smUk| BBC Vote 2001 Coverage&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The elections were marked by voter apathy, with turnout falling to 59.4%, the lowest since the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|Coupon Election]] of 1918. Throughout the election the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had maintained a significant lead in the opinion polls and the result was deemed to be so certain that some [[bookmaker]]s paid out for a Labour majority before the election day. However, the opinion polls the previous autumn had shown the first Tory lead (though only by a narrow margin) in the opinion polls for eight years as the opposition benefited from the public anger towards the government over the [[Fuel protests in the United Kingdom|fuel protests]] which had led to a severe shortage of motor fuel. By the end of 2000, however, the dispute had been solved and Labour were firmly back in the lead of the opinion polls.

In total, a mere 29 parliamentary seats changed hands at the 2001 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/basics/4393329.stm | work=BBC News | title=2001: Labour claims second term | date=5 April 2005 | accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The election had been expected on 3 May, to coincide with local elections, but both were postponed because of rural movement restrictions imposed in response to a [[2001 UK foot and mouth crisis|foot and mouth outbreak]]. One of the more noted events of a quiet campaign was when a countryside protester Craig Evans threw an egg at [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Prescott]] in [[Rhyl]]; Prescott then punched him and a struggle ensued, in front of [[television]] cameras. 2001 also saw the rare election of an independent. [[Richard Taylor (UK politician)|Dr. Richard Taylor]] of [[Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern]] (usually now known simply as &quot;Health Concern&quot;) unseated a government minister. There was also a high vote for [[British National Party]] leader [[Nick Griffin]] in [[Oldham]], in the wake of recent race riots in the town.

In [[Northern Ireland]], the election was far more dramatic and marked a move by [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionists]] away from support for the [[Good Friday Agreement]], with the moderate unionist [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) losing to the more hardline [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP). This polarisation was also seen in the nationalist community, with the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) vote losing out to more left-wing and republican [[Sinn Féin]]. It also saw a tightening of the parties as the small [[UK Unionist Party]] lost its only seat.

==Campaign==

For Labour the last 4 years had run relatively smoothly. The party had successfully defended all their [[List of United Kingdom by-elections|by-election]] seats, and many suspected a Labour win was inevitable from the start. Many in the party however were afraid of voter apathy, which was epitomised in the iconic &quot;Thatcher in a wig&quot; poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/election2001/poster/0,,498578,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Get out and vote. Or they get in.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour however could rely on a strong economy, putting to rest any fears of a Labour government putting the economic situation at risk.

For William Hague however the Conservative party had still not fully recovered from the loss in 1997. The party was still divided over Europe, and talk of a referendum on the Euro was rife. As Labour remained at the political centre the Tories inevitably moved to the right. A policy gaffe by Oliver Letwin over public spending cuts left the party with an own goal that Labour soon took advantage of. Margaret Thatcher also added to Hague's troubles when speaking out strongly against the Euro to applause. Hague himself, although a witty performer at PMQs, was dogged in the press and reminded of his speech at Conservative conference at the age of 16. The Sun newspaper only added to the Conservatives woes by backing Labour once again, calling Hague a &quot;dead parrot&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ThhguC97EdA/STaU-tJdVzI/AAAAAAAAASA/GVBGsJaLKAI/s400/PARROT-HAGUE.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Liberals, this was the first election for leader Charles Kennedy, who received a good amount of coverage and ultimately left the campaign for the better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393329.stm | work=BBC News | title=2001: Labour claims second term | date=5 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
During the election, Sharron Storer, a resident of [[Birmingham]], criticised [[Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] in front of television cameras about conditions in the [[National Health Service]]. The widely-televised incident happened on 16 May during a campaign visit by Blair to the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]] in Birmingham. Sharron Storer's [[domestic partner|partner]], Keith Sedgewick, a [[cancer]] patient with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and therefore highly susceptible to infection, was being treated at the time in the [[bone marrow]] unit, but no bed could be found for him and he was transferred to the casualty unit for his first 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=British Government and Politics: A Comparative Guide |author=Duncan Watts|year=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MiTDykvtbEkC&amp;pg=PA320&amp;lpg=PA320&amp;dq=%22Sharron+Storer%22|isbn=9780748623235|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1334000/1334131.stm BBC story from 16 May 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1334000/1334903.stm BBC story from 17 May 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
The election was effectively a repeat of 1997, as the Labour party vindicated the faith placed in it 4 years ago, and thus retained its overwhelming majority. Having presided over relatively serene political, economic and social conditions, the feeling of prosperity in the UK had been maintained into the new millennium, and Labour would have a free hand to assert its ideals in the subsequent parliament.
Despite the victory, voter apathy was a major issue, as turnout fell below 60% for the first time in history, 12% down on 1997. All of the 3 main parties saw their total votes fall, with Labour's total vote dropping by 2.8 million on 1997, the Conservatives 1.3 million, and the Liberal Democrats 428,000. Some suggested this dramatic fall was a sign of the general acceptance of the status quo and the likelihood of Labour's majority remaining unassailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1383000/1383403.stm | work=BBC News | title=The poll that never was | date=11 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Conservatives' the huge loss they had sustained in 1997 was repeated. Despite gaining 9 seats the Tories lost 8 behind them to the Liberals Democrats and one even to Labour. The inevitable result was the speedy resignation of William Hague in the election aftermath. Some believed that Hague had been unlucky, although most considered him to be a talented orator and an intelligent statesman, he had come up against the charismatic Tony Blair in the pomp of his political career, and it was no surprise that little progress was made in reducing Labour's majority after a relatively smooth parliament. Staying at what they considered rock-bottom however showed that the Conservatives had failed to improve their negative public image, had remained somewhat disunited over Europe and had not regained the trust that they had lost in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1377000/1377378.stm | work=BBC News | title=Labour romps home again | date=8 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberal Democrats could point to steady progress under Charles Kennedy, gaining more seats than the main two parties - albeit only six overall - and maintaining the performance of a pleasing 1997 election, where the party doubled its number of seats from 20 to 46. While they had yet to become electable as a government, they underlined their growing reputation as a worthwhile alternative to Labour and Conservative, offering plenty of debate in parliament and not just representing a protest vote.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Meanwhile it was a disappointing night for the SNP, they failed to gain any seats and lost a seat to the Conservatives by just 79 votes. Plaid Cymru gained and lost a seat to Labour respectively. In Northern Ireland it was a poor night for the Ulster Unionists, and despite gaining North Down they lost 5 seats behind them.
