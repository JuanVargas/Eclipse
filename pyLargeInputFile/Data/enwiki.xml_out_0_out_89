Concorde also acquired an unusual [[nomenclature]] for an aircraft.

===Testing===
Construction of two prototypes began in February 1965: 001, built by Aerospatiale at Toulouse, and 002, by BAC at [[Filton]], [[Bristol]].

These trips led to orders for over 70 aircraft, but a combination of factors led to order cancellations: the [[1973 oil crisis]], financial difficulties of airlines, a spectacular Paris Le Bourget air show crash of the competing Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-144]], and environmental concerns such as the [[sonic boom]], [[takeoff]]-noise and pollution. By 1976 four nations remained as prospective buyers: Britain, France, China, and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=XJcUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9a0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4991,607322&amp;dq=second+generation+concorde&amp;hl=en |title = Concordes limited to 16 |publisher=Virgin Islands Daily News |date = 5 June 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end only Air France and British Airways (the successor to BOAC) took up their orders, with the two governments taking a cut of any profits made. In the case of BA, 80% of the profit was kept by the government until 1984, while the cost of buying the aircraft was covered by a state loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.britishairways.com/concorde/faq.html#6 |title = Payments for Concorde |publisher=British Airways |accessdate = 2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States cancelled the [[Boeing 2707]], its supersonic transport programme, in 1971. Industry observers in France and the United Kingdom suggested that part of the American opposition to Concorde on grounds of noise pollution was orchestrated, or at least encouraged, by the [[United States Government]], out of spite at not being able to propose a viable competitor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D16F93C54137A93C0A81789D85F478785F9 |title = Britain and France have wasted billions on the Concorde |work=New York Times |first = Anthony |last = Lewis |date = 12 February 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite President [[John F.

Demonstration and test flights were flown from 1974 onwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlyhist&quot;/&gt; The testing of Concorde set records that have not been surpassed; the prototype, pre-production and first production aircraft undertook 5,335 flight hours; 2,000 test hours were at supersonic speeds. During one such test flight, on 7 November 1974, 001 performed the fastest civil flight across the North Atlantic, setting a record that still stands. Unit costs were £23&amp;nbsp;million (US$46&amp;nbsp;million, EUR 50 million) in 1977, and development costs were six times the projected amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1352927/Is-this-the-end-of-the-Concorde-dream.html |title = Is this the end of the Concorde dream? |work=Daily Telegraph |first = Paul |last = Marston |date = 16 August 2000 |quote = ...the estimated development costs of £160&amp;nbsp;million.

Concorde is an [[ogive|ogival]] (also &quot;ogee&quot;) [[delta-wing]]ed aircraft with four [[Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593‎|Olympus]] engines based on those originally developed for the [[Avro Vulcan]] [[strategic bomber]]. Concorde was the first airliner to have an (in this case, analogue) [[fly-by-wire]] flight-control system; the avionics of Concorde were unique because it was the first commercial aircraft to employ [[Hybrid integrated circuit|hybrid circuit]]s.&lt;ref name='elecflybywire' /&gt; The principal designer for the project was Pierre Satre, with [[Archibald Russell|Sir Archibald Russell]] as his deputy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Peter |last = Masefield |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19950601/ai_n13985814 |title = Obituary: Sir Archibald Russell |work=The Independent |location=UK |date = 1 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement of centre of pressure===
[[File:2001concordewingduxfordJM.jpg|thumb|G-AXDN, Duxford, close up of pre-production engine nozzles. The nozzle/thrust reverser design was altered for the production Concordes.]]

When any aircraft passes the [[critical mach]] of that particular airframe, the [[centre of pressure]] shifts rearwards. This causes a pitch down force on the aircraft, as the centre of mass remains where it was. The engineers designed the wings in a specific manner to reduce this shift. However, there was still a shift of about 2&amp;nbsp;metres. This could have been countered by the use of [[airfoil|trim controls]], but at such high speeds this would have caused a dramatic increase in the drag on the aircraft. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of mass, effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control.&lt;ref name = 'fueltrim'&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1108/eb035344 |url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&amp;hdAction=lnkpdf&amp;contentId=1682642 |title = Flight Refuelling Limited and Concorde: The fuel system aboard is largely their work |journal=Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |publisher=MCB UP |volume = 48 |issue = 9 |issn = 0002-2667 |pages = 20–21 |date = September 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engines===
{{Main|Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593}}

To be economically viable, Concorde needed to be able to fly long distances, and this required high efficiency. For optimum supersonic flight, turbofan engines were considered, but rejected, due to their larger cross-section which would cause excessive drag. [[Turbojet]]s were found to be the best choice of engines.&lt;ref&gt;Birtles, Philip. ''Concorde'', pp. 62–63. Vergennes, Vermont: Plymouth Press, 2000. ISBN 1-882663-44-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The engine developed was the twin spool [[Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593]], a development of the Bristol engine first used for the [[Avro Vulcan]] bomber, and developed into an afterburning supersonic variant for the [[BAC TSR-2]] strike bomber.&lt;ref name=&quot;wingweb&quot;&gt;[http://www.wingweb.co.uk/engines/Olympus593_MK610.html &quot;Rolls Royce Olympus history.&quot;] ''wingweb.co.uk''. Retrieved: 15 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Concordeintake.gif|thumb|Concorde's intake system schematics]]
[[File:Concorde Ramp.jpg|thumb|Concorde's intake system]]

The intake design for Concorde’s engines was critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = https://www.sae.org/technical/papers/912180 |title = Concorde Propulsion--Did we get it right? The Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593 Engine reviewed |publisher=SAE International |author=Ganley, G. A.  |date = September 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional jet engines can take in air at only around Mach 0.5; therefore the air has to be slowed from the Mach 2.0 airspeed that enters the engine intake. In particular, Concorde needed to control the shock waves that this reduction in speed generates to avoid damage to the engines. This was done by a pair of [[intake ramp]]s and an auxiliary spill door, whose position was moved during flight to slow the air down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/rm/3711.pdf |title = On the sub-critical stability of variable ramp intakes at Mach numbers around 2 |journal=Aeronautical Research Council |author=Fisher, S.A. |coauthors = M.C. Neale and A.J. Brooks |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |year = 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the intake system is such that, during supersonic flight, 63% of the aircraft's thrust is attributed to the intakes whilst the exhaust nozzles generate 29% and the engines just 8% of the thrust.&lt;ref name = 'powerplant'/&gt;

Engine failure causes problems on conventional subsonic aircraft; not only does the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag, causing the aircraft to yaw and bank in the direction of the failed engine. If this had happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds, it could theoretically cause a catastrophic failure of the airframe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4935682.html |title = Full authority engine-out control augmentation subsystem: United States Patent 4935682 |publisher=freepatentsonline.com |first = Michael S. |last = Mccuen |date = 8 June 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during an engine failure, air intake needs are virtually zero, so in Concorde, the immediate effects of the engine failure were countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps, which deflected the air downwards past the engine, gaining lift and streamlining the engine, minimising the drag effects of the failed engine. Although computer simulations predicted considerable difficulties, in practice Concorde was able to shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without any of the predicted control problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2003/10/21/172657/concorde-special-the-test-pilot-john-cochrane.html |title = Concorde Special - The test pilot - John Cochrane |publisher=Flight International |date = 21 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concorde pilots were routinely trained in simulators to deal with a double engine failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63710463.html |title = How a Concorde pilot would handle a nightmare failure |publisher=Birmingham Post |first = Peter |last = Woodman |date = 27 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft used reheat ([[afterburner]]s) at takeoff and to pass through the [[transonic]] regime (i.e., &quot;go supersonic&quot;) between Mach 0.95 and Mach 1.7, and were switched off at all other times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=A9110958AH&amp;q=Rolls-Royce%2FSnecma+Olympus+593&amp;uid=788858323&amp;setcookie=yes |title = The Rolls Royce/SNECMA Olympus 593 engine operational experience and the lessons learned |publisher=''European Symposium on the Future of High Speed Air Transport'' |author=Ganley, G. |coauthors = G. Laviec |year = 1989 |pages = 73–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to jet engines being [[propulsive efficiency|highly inefficient at low speeds]], Concorde burned two tonnes of fuel (almost 2% of the maximum fuel load) taxiing to the runway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5195964.stm |title = Are the skies turning green? |publisher=BBC News |first = Joe |last = Lynam |date = 19 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; To conserve fuel only the two outer engines were run after landing for taxiing to the ramp.

===Heating issues===
Beside engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the [[nose cone|nose]]. The engineers wanted to use [[duralumin]], an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft due to its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was 127 °C, which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.2307/3951418 |title = When the SST Is Too Slow... |publisher=Society for Science &amp; the Public |journal=Science News |first = Jonathan |last = Eberhart |volume = 91 |issue = 22 |date = 3 June 1967 |pages = 528–529 |jstor = 3951418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1108/eb034143 |url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&amp;hdAction=lnkpdf&amp;contentId=1681441 |title = The Concorde takes shape : Test programme and construction proceeding according to schedule |publisher=MCB UP |journal=Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |pages = 38 |year = 1966 |volume = 38 |issue = 4 |issn = 0002-2667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode = 1972NASSP.309..631N |volume = 309 |title = Fatigue Tests on Big Structure Assemblies of Concorde Aircraft |pages = 631 |publisher=NASA |year = 1972 |author=N'guyen, V.P. |coauthor = J.P. Perrais}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the heat generated by compression of air as Concorde travelled supersonically, the fuselage would extend by as much as 300&amp;nbsp;mm (almost 1&amp;nbsp;ft), the most obvious manifestation of this being a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the [[flight engineer]]’s console and the bulkhead. On all Concordes that had a supersonic retirement flight, the flight engineers placed their hats in this gap before it cooled, where the hats remain to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.seattlepi.com/business/147276_pilot07.html |first = James |last = Wallace |title = Those who flew the Concorde will miss it |publisher=Seattle Post |date = 7 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a [[heat sink]] for the heat from the air conditioning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mcb/127/1993/00000040/00000003/art00002 |title = Introduction to Concorde: A brief review of the Concorde and its prospects |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited |journal=Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |author=Gedge, G.T.  |coauthor = M.I. Prod |year = 1993 |volume = 40 |issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated, a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.&lt;ref&gt;Owen 2001, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concorde also had restrictions on [[aircraft livery|livery]]; the majority of the surface had to be painted with a [[Anti-flash white|highly reflective white]] paint to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects from supersonic flight at Mach 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concordesst.com/history/orders.html &quot;Concorde SST: orders.&quot;] ''concordesst.com''. Retrieved: 2 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, however, Air France briefly painted F-BTSD in a predominantly blue livery (with the exception of the wings) as part of a promotional deal with [[Pepsi|Pepsi Cola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4794332.html |title = Is this the colour of the new millennium? |work=The Independent |location=UK |date = 3 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this paint scheme, Air France were advised to remain at Mach 2 for no more than 20 minutes at a time, but there was no restriction at speeds under Mach 1.7. F-BTSD was chosen for the promotion because the aircraft was not then scheduled to operate any long flights that required extended Mach 2 operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.elmundo.es/papel/hemeroteca/1996/04/05/comunicacion/100521.html |title = Azul contra rojo |publisher=El Mundo |first = Cristina |last = Frade |date = 5 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural issues===
Due to the high speeds at which Concorde travelled, large forces were applied to the aircraft's structure during banks and turns. This caused twisting and the distortion of the aircraft’s structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds; both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard [[elevons]], varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which are attached to the stiffest area of the wings, are active at high speed.&lt;ref&gt;Owen 2001, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed.&lt;ref name=&quot;nova&quot; /&gt; This was visible from the rear passengers’ viewpoints.&lt;ref name=&quot;popular&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lpiMSzja6W4C&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=concorde%20flexing&amp;pg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q=concorde%20flexing&amp;f=false Popular Science Oct 1973]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brakes and undercarriage===
[[File:Concorde undercarriage Speyer 02 with disc brakes.JPG|thumb|Concorde tyres&lt;!--this article uses UK English spellings--&gt; and brakes]]
[[File:Concorde tail gear.JPG|thumb|right| Tail bumper of Concorde G-BOAG at the [[Museum of Flight]] in Seattle]]
Due to a high average takeoff speed of {{convert|250|mph|km/h}}, Concorde needed upgraded brakes. Like most airliners, Concorde has [[anti-lock braking system|anti-skid braking]] – a system which prevents the t{{H:title|tires (US) - this article uses UK English spellings|y|link=no}}res from losing traction when the brakes are applied for greater control during roll-out. The brakes, developed by [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]], were the first carbon-based brakes used on an airliner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.jstor.org/pss/36383 |title = Design and Engineering of Carbon Brakes |publisher=The Royal Society |author=Stimson, I. L. |coauthors = R. Fisher |date = January 1980 |volume = 294 |issue = 1411 |pages = 583–590 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London}}&lt;/ref&gt; They could bring Concorde to a stop from an aborted takeoff within one mile (1600 m) when weighing up to 185 tons (188 [[tonnes]]) and travelling at {{convert|190|mph|km/h}}. This braking manoeuvre brought the brakes to temperatures of 300–500 °C, requiring several hours for cooling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concordesst.com/gear.html &quot;Concorde SST: Landing Gear.&quot;] ''concordesst.com''. Retrieved: 2 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the way Concorde's delta-wing generated lift, the undercarriage had to be unusually strong. At [[Rotation (aviation)|rotation]], Concorde would rise to a high angle of attack, about 18 degrees. Prior to rotation the wing generated almost no lift, unlike typical aircraft wings. Combined with the high airspeed at rotation (199 KIAS), this unexpectedly increased the stresses on the rear undercarriage and during the development required a major redesign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.iasa.com.au/folders/Safety_Issues/others/concordespacer.html |title = The real story of Flight 4590: Special Investigation |publisher=iasa.com.au |first = David |last = Rose |date = 13 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high alpha needed at rotation, a small set of wheels were added aft to prevent tailstrikes. The rear main undercarriage units swing towards each other to be stowed but due to their great height also need to retract telescopically before swinging in order to clear each other when stowed.&lt;ref&gt;Brooklands Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

===Range===
In order to travel between London and New York, or Washington, non-stop, Concorde was developed to have the greatest supersonic range of any aircraft. This was achieved by a combination of engines which were highly efficient at supersonic speeds (The world's most energy-efficient jet engine&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;), a slender fuselage with high [[fineness ratio]], and a complex wing shape delivering a high [[lift to drag ratio]]. This also required carrying only a modest payload and a high fuel capacity, and the aircraft was trimmed with precision to avoid unnecessary drag.&lt;ref name = 'deltawing'/&gt;&lt;ref name = 'fueltrim'/&gt;&lt;ref name = 'powerplant'/&gt;

Nevertheless, soon after Concorde began flying, a Concorde &quot;B&quot; model was designed with slightly larger fuel capacity and slightly larger wings with [[leading edge slats]] to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds. It featured more powerful engines with sound deadening and without the fuel-hungry and noisy reheat. It was speculated that it was reasonably possible to create an engine with up to 25% gain in efficiency over the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=N9222540AH&amp;q=Concorde+engines&amp;uid=788858323&amp;setcookie=yes |title = Propulsion challenges and opportunities for high-speed transport aircraft |publisher=Aeropropulsion |author=Strack, William  |year = 1987 |pages = 437–452}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have given {{convert|500|mi|0|abbr=on}} additional range and a greater payload, making new commercial routes possible. This was cancelled due in part to poor sales of Concorde, but also to the rising cost of aviation fuel in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=Q-0cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rGcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6914,3256355&amp;dq=tu+144&amp;hl=en |title = Fuel costs kill Second Generation of Concordes |first = Alison |last = Smale |publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date = 22 September 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increased radiation exposure===
[[File:ConcordeFuselageSinsheim.jpg|thumb|Concorde [[fuselage]]]]

The high altitude at which Concorde cruised meant passengers received almost twice the [[flux]] of extraterrestrial [[ionising radiation]] as those travelling on a conventional long-haul flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.britishairways.com/travel/healthcosmic/public/en_gb#4 |title = How much radiation might I be exposed to? |publisher=British Airways |accessdate = 11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 'concradi'&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1108/eb035011 |url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do;jsessionid=E0A02B0587619C9A40D5736FCE7B3F02?contentType=Article&amp;hdAction=lnkpdf&amp;contentId=1682309 |title = Electronic safety test replaces radioactive test source |author=Guerin, D.W.  |journal=Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |year = 1973 |volume = 45 |issue = 4 |issn = 0002-2667 |pages = 10 |publisher=MCB UP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Concorde's introduction, it was speculated that this exposure during supersonic travels would increase the likelihood of skin cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=GfUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dnkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2948,4208&amp;dq=second+generation+concorde&amp;hl=en |title = Skin cancer danger linked to stratospheric jet planes |publisher=St. Petersburg Times |date = 1 April 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the proportionally reduced flight time, the overall [[equivalent dose]] would normally be ''less'' than a conventional flight over the same distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.britishairways.com/travel/healthcosmic/public/en_gb |title = Cosmic radiation |publisher=British Airways |accessdate = 11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual [[Solar variation|solar activity]] might lead to an increase in incident radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arctowski |first=Henryk |year=1940 |title=On Solar Faculae and Solar Constant Variations |journal=Proc.

===Cabin pressurisation===
[[File:Concorde interior2.jpg|thumb|right|[[British Airways]] Concorde interior before 2000. The narrow fuselage needed for efficient supersonic flight permitted only 4 seats across the aircraft, and gave limited headroom and locker space.]]

Airliner cabins were usually maintained at a pressure equivalent to 6,000–8,000&amp;nbsp;feet (1,800–2,400 m) elevation. Concorde’s pressurisation was set to an altitude at the lower end of this range, {{convert|6000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1093/occmed/17.2.47 |url = http://occmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/17/2/47.pdf |title = Human Factors in the Concorde |journal=Occupational Medicine |last = Hepburn |first = A.N. |volume = 17 |issue = 2 |year = 1967 |pages =47–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concorde’s maximum cruising altitude was {{convert|60000|ft|m}}; subsonic airliners typically cruise below {{convert|40000|ft|m}}. Above {{convert|50000|ft|m}}, the lack of air pressure would give a &quot;[[Time of Useful Consciousness|time of useful consciousness]]&quot; in even a conditioned athlete of no more than 10–15 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.theairlinepilots.com/medical/decompressionandhypoxia.htm |title=Cabin Decompression and Hypoxia |first = Mark |last = Wolff |date = 6 January 2006 |publisher=PIA Air Safety Publication}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sudden reduction in cabin pressure is hazardous to all passengers and crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Flight Training Handbook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ioRTAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|accessdate=28 July 2007|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Transportation, [[Federal Aviation Administration]], Flight Standards Service|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Concorde’s altitude, the air density is very low; a breach of cabin integrity would result in a loss of pressure severe enough so that the plastic emergency oxygen masks installed on other passenger jets would not be effective, and passengers would quickly suffer from [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] despite quickly donning them. Concorde was equipped with smaller windows to reduce the rate of loss in the event of a breach,&lt;ref name = 'nunn'&gt;{{cite book |title=Nunn's applied respiratory physiology |first = John Francis |last = Nunn |publisher=Butterworth-Heineman |isbn = 075061336X |year = 1993 |page = 341}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reserve air supply system to augment cabin air pressure, and a rapid descent procedure to bring the aircraft to a safe altitude. The FAA enforces minimum emergency descent rates for aircraft and made note of Concorde’s higher operating altitude, concluding that the best response to a loss of pressure would be a rapid descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgPolicy.nsf/0/90AA20C2F35901D98625713F0056B1B8?OpenDocument |title= Interim Policy on High Altitude Cabin Decompression - Relevant Past Practice |first = Steve |last = Happenny |date = 24 March 2006 |publisher=Federal Aviation Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Continuous Positive Airway Pressure]] would have delivered pressurised oxygen directly to the pilots through masks.&lt;ref name = 'nunn'/&gt;

===Droop nose===
[[File:Heathrow Airport - geograph.org.uk - 293.jpg|thumb|Concorde with droop nose in fully down position during rollout after landing]]
Concorde’s drooping nose enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimum aerodynamic efficiency, and not obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, takeoff, and landing operations. A delta-wing aircraft takes off and lands with a high angle of attack (a high nose angle) due to the way the delta wing generates lift; which increased the obstruction of a long pointed nose and necessitates the capability to droop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=A7138343AH&amp;q=Concorde+nose+droop&amp;uid=788872723&amp;setcookie=yes |title = Droop Nose |publisher=Flight International |year = 1971 |pages = 257–260 |author=Goff, W.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The droop nose was accompanied by a moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would raise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.&lt;ref name = &quot;Concorde nose&quot;/&gt;

A controller in the cockpit allowed the visor to be retracted and the nose to be lowered to 5° below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and takeoff. Following takeoff and after clearing the airport, the nose and visor were raised. Shortly before landing, the visor was again retracted and the nose lowered to 12.5° below horizontal for maximum visibility. Upon landing the nose was raised to the five-degree position to avoid the possibility of damage.&lt;ref name = &quot;Concorde nose&quot;/&gt; On rare occasions, the aircraft could take off with the nose fully down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concordesst.com/209.html &quot;Air France fleet: Aircraft no. 209.&quot;] ''concordesst.com''. Retrieved: 2 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A final position had the visor retracted into the nose but the nose in the standard horizontal position. This setup was used for cleaning the windscreen and for short subsonic flights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Concorde nose&quot;&gt;[http://www.concordesst.com/nose.html &quot;Concorde nose.&quot;] ''concordesst.com''.

Retrieved: 2 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] objected to that restrictive visibility and demanded a different design before it would permit Concorde to serve US airports, which led to the redesigned visor used on the production aircraft and the four &quot;pre-production&quot; aircraft (101, 102, 201, and 202).&lt;ref&gt;Owen 2001, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The re-designed nose window and visor glass needed to endure temperatures in excess of 100°C at supersonic flight were developed by [[Pilkington|Triplex]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%202105.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight characteristics===
[[File:Concorde at Baginton - geograph.org.uk - 156846.jpg|thumb|right|Concorde performing a low-level flypast at an air show]]

While commercial jets take eight hours to fly from New York to Paris, the average supersonic flight time on the transatlantic routes was just under 3.5 hours. Concorde had a maximum cruise altitude of {{convert|18,300|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} and an average cruise speed of [[Mach number|Mach]] 2.02, about 1155 [[Knot (unit)|knots]] (2140&amp;nbsp;km/h or 1334&amp;nbsp;mph), more than twice the speed of conventional aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Schrader 1989, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; BA flights flown by Concorde added &quot;''Concorde''&quot; to the standard &quot;''[[Speedbird]]''&quot; callsign to notify air traffic control of the aircraft’s unique abilities and restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7422409257931235094 |title = BA Tribute to Concorde.

With no other civil traffic operating at its cruising altitude of about {{convert|56000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, dedicated [[North Atlantic Tracks|oceanic airways]] or &quot;tracks&quot; were used by Concorde to cross the Atlantic. Due to the nature of high altitude winds, these SST tracks were fixed in terms of their co-ordinates, unlike the [[North Atlantic Tracks]] at lower altitudes whose co-ordinates alter daily according to forecast weather patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orlebar p. 84&quot;&gt;Orlebar 2002, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Concorde would also be cleared in a {{convert|15000|ft|m|sing=on}} block, allowing for a slow climb from 45,000 to {{convert|60000|ft|m|abbr=on}} during the oceanic crossing as the fuel load gradually decreased.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shanwick Oceanic Control|Prestwick Oceanic Area Control Centre]]: Manual of Air Traffic Services (Part 2). [[National Air Traffic Services|NATS]]&lt;/ref&gt; In regular service, Concorde employed an efficient ''cruise-climb'' flight profile following take-off.&lt;ref&gt;Orlebar 2002, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a landing approach Concorde was on the &quot;back side&quot; of the [[Parasitic drag|drag force]] curve, where raising the nose would increase the sink rate.&lt;ref&gt;Orlebar 2002, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The delta-shaped wings allowed Concorde to attain a higher [[angle of attack]] than conventional aircraft, as it allowed the formation of large low pressure vortices over the entire upper wing surface, maintaining lift.&lt;ref&gt;Orlebar 2002, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The normal landing speed was {{convert|170|mph|km/h|0|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;Schrader 1989, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[US Secretary of Transportation]], [[William Thaddeus Coleman, Jr.|William Coleman]], gave permission for Concorde service to [[Washington Dulles International Airport]], and Air France and British Airways simultaneously began service to Dulles on 24 May 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/tportl8&amp;div=7&amp;id=&amp;page= |title = Safety Regulation of the Concorde Supersonic Transport: Realistic Confinement of the National Environmental Policy Act |first = Robert B. |last = Donin |publisher=HeinOnline |year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the US ban on JFK Concorde operations was lifted in February 1977, New York banned Concorde locally. The ban came to an end on 17 October 1977 when the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] declined to overturn a lower court’s ruling rejecting efforts by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]] and a grass-roots campaign led by [[Carol Berman]] to continue the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = O'Grady |first = Jim |url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E2DC153DF934A15757C0A9659C8B63 |title = Neighborhood Report: The Rockaways; Ears Ringing?

The routing between Washington or New York and Mexico City included a deceleration, from Mach 2.02 to Mach 0.95, to cross Florida subsonically and avoid unlawfully creating a sonic boom over the state; Concorde then re-accelerated back to its original speed to cross the Gulf of Mexico. On 1 April 1989, on an around-the-world luxury tour charter, British Airways implemented a new version of this routing that allowed G-BOAF to maintain Mach 2.02 by passing around Florida to the east and south. From time to time, Concorde came back to the region on similar chartered flights to Mexico City and Acapulco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-5212185.html |title = Air France offering 'New Year's Eve in Paris.' |publisher=PR Newswire |date = 2 October 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1978 to 1980, [[Braniff International Airways]] leased 10 Concordes, five each from Air France and British Airways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/646052352.html?dids=646052352:646052352&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Feb+10%2C+1977&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Braniff+Seeks+Deal+to+Fly+Concorde+in+U.S.&amp;pqatl=google |title = Braniff seeks deal to fly Concorde in U.S. |work=Los Angeles Times |first = John |last = Getze |date = 10 February 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were used on subsonic flights between [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas-Fort Worth]] and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]], flown by Braniff flight crews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/647634162.html?dids=647634162:647634162&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+22%2C+1978&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Concorde+Flights+to+Texas+OKd&amp;pqatl=google |title = Concorde flights to Texas Ok'd |work=Los Angeles Times |date = 22 June 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air France and British Airways crews then took over for the continuing supersonic flights to London and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=VAQkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MO4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6783,4192544&amp;dq=concorde+braniff&amp;hl=en |title = Concorde now reaping profits on N.Y. route |publisher=The Spokesman-Review |date = 23 November 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft were registered in both the United States and their home countries; the European registration was covered for the hours it was being operated by Braniff, retaining the full AF/BA liveries.

===BA buys its Concordes outright===
By around 1981 in the UK, the future for Concorde looked bleak. The British government had lost money operating Concorde every year, and moves were afoot to cancel the service entirely. A cost projection came back with greatly reduced metallurgical testing costs because the test rig for the wings had built up enough data to last for 30 years and could be shut down. Despite this, the government was not keen to continue. In late 1983, the managing director of BA, [[John King, Baron King of Wartnaby|Sir John King]], convinced the government to sell the aircraft outright to (the then state owned, later privatised) BA for £16.5&amp;nbsp;million plus the first year’s profits.&lt;ref&gt;Backroom boys&amp;nbsp;— Francis Spufford&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 'concewhitele'&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/632500842.html?dids=632500842:632500842&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Apr+01%2C+1984&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=The+plane+fact+is%2C+Concorde+has+broken+the+profit+barrier+for+the+first+time&amp;pqatl=google |title = The plane fact is, Concorde has broken the profit barrier for the first time |work=Chicago Tribune |date=1 April 1984 |first = Peter |last = Greenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir John King realised that he had a premier product that was underpriced, and after carrying out a market survey, British Airways discovered that customers thought Concorde was more expensive than it actually was.

===Concorde Flight 4590 crash===
{{Main|Air France Flight 4590}}

On 25 July 2000, Air France Flight 4590, registration F-BTSC, crashed in [[Gonesse]], France, killing all 100 passengers and nine crew members on board the flight, and four people on the ground. It was the only fatal incident involving Concorde.

According to the official investigation conducted by the French accident investigation bureau (BEA), the crash was caused by a [[titanium]] strip that fell from a [[Continental Airlines]] [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]] that had taken off minutes earlier. This metal fragment punctured a [[tire|tyre]]&lt;!-- please leave British spelling of &quot;tyres&quot; on British/French aircraft ---&gt; on the Concorde's left main wheel bogie during takeoff. The tyre exploded, a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank, and while the fuel tank was not punctured, the impact caused a shock-wave which caused one of the fuel valves in the wing to burst open. This caused a major fuel leak from the tank, which then ignited due to sparking electrical landing gear wiring severed by another piece of the same tyre. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain height or speed. The aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a violent descent, rolling left and crashing tail-low into the Hotelissimo Hotel in Gonesse.&lt;ref&gt;Endres 2001, pp. 110–113.&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 December 2010, Continental Airlines and John Taylor, one of their mechanics, were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;Cody, E.

''Washington Post'', 6 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the accident, Concorde had been arguably the safest operational passenger airliner in the world in terms of passenger deaths-per-kilometres travelled with zero, but with a history of tyre explosions 60 times higher than subsonic jets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0UBT/is_6_16/ai_82753359/ |accessdate= 1 February 2010 |title= Human Factor Issues Emerge from Concorde Crash Investigation |journal= Air Safety Week |year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safety improvements were made in the wake of the crash, including more secure electrical controls, [[Kevlar]] lining to the fuel tanks and specially developed burst-resistant tyres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1442061.stm |title= Concorde's safety modifications |publisher= BBC News |date= 17 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Further details belong at [[Air France Flight 4590]]. --&gt;

The first flight after the modifications departed from [[London Heathrow airport|London Heathrow]] on 17 July 2001, piloted by BA Chief Concorde Pilot [[Mike Bannister]]. During the 3-hour 20-minute flight over the mid-Atlantic towards Iceland, Bannister attained [[Mach number|Mach]] 2.02 and {{convert|60000|ft|m|abbr=on}} before returning to [[RAF Brize Norton]]. The test flight, intended to resemble the London–New York route, was declared a success and was watched on live TV, and by crowds on the ground at both locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,29732,00.html |title = Concorde Completes Successful Test Flight |publisher=Fox News |date = 17 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first flight with passengers after the accident took place on 11 September 2001, which landed shortly before the [[September 11 attacks|World Trade Center attacks]] in the United States.

On 10 April 2003, Air France and British Airways simultaneously announced that they would retire Concorde later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2934257.stm |title = Concorde grounded for good |publisher=BBC News |date = 10 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concordesst.com/retire/announcements.html &quot;Text of British Airways and Air France retirement announcements.&quot;] ''concordesst.com''.

Although Concorde was a technological marvel when introduced into service in the 1970s, 30&amp;nbsp;years later its cockpit, cluttered with analogue controls and dials, looked dated, as there had been little commercial pressure or reason to upgrade Concorde due to a lack of competing aircraft, unlike other airliners of the same vintage, for example the Boeing&amp;nbsp;747.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1108/eb035646 |url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do;jsessionid=E7C9404F2C91DC6FD5BC8C45D43CED69?contentType=Article&amp;hdAction=lnkpdf&amp;contentId=1682944 |title = New Aircraft: Where are we heading in the 1980s and 1990s |journal=Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |publisher=MCB UP |first = Ian S. |last = Macdonald |volume = 52 |issue = 7 |issn = 0002-2667 |page = 23-17 |year = 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; By its retirement, it was the last aircraft in British Airways' fleet that still had a [[flight engineer]]; other aircraft, such as the modernised [[747-400]], had eliminated that role.&lt;ref name = &quot;fliengi&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB106504293992222300.html?mod=googlewsj |title = Final Boarding Call: As Concorde Departs, so do 3-Man Crews: In New Cockpits, Engineers are seen as Extra Baggage |work=Wall Street Journal |first = Danial |last = Michaels |date = 2 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, [[Richard Branson|Sir Richard Branson]] offered to buy British Airways’ Concorde fleet at their &quot;original price of&amp;nbsp;£1&quot; for service with [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]].

French Concorde F-BTSD has been retired to the &quot;[[Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace]]&quot; at [[Le Bourget]] (near Paris) and, unlike the other museum Concordes, a few of the systems are being kept functional, so that, for instance, the famous &quot;droop nose&quot; can still be lowered and raised.

In a week of farewell flights around the United Kingdom, Concorde visited [[Birmingham]] on 20 October, [[Belfast]] on 21 October, [[Manchester]] on 22 October, [[Cardiff]] on 23 October and [[Edinburgh]] on 24 October. Each day the aircraft made a return flight out and back into [[Heathrow]] to the cities, often overflying them at low altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/bristol/somerset/3238674.stm |title = Last Concorde lands |publisher=BBC News |date = 27 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3205915.stm |title = Concorde enjoys Cardiff farewell |work=BBC News |date = 23 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.amazon.co.uk/Concorde-Farewell-collection-final-flights/dp/B0001DI57G |title = Concorde - The Farewell - A collection of the final flights of the last days of Concorde |publisher=Simply Media |date = 19 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 October, Heathrow ATC arranged for the inbound flight BA9021C, a special from Manchester, and BA002 from New York to land simultaneously on the left and right runways respectively. On the evening of 23 October 2003, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] consented to the illumination of [[Windsor Castle]] as Concorde's last west-bound commercial flight departed London overhead, an honour normally reserved for major state events and visiting dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rockawave.com/news/2003-10-31/Front_Page/028.html |title = The Concorde Makes A Comeback |first = Brian |last = Magoolaghan |publisher=Wave of Long Island |date = 31 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Airways retired its Concorde fleet on 24 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;jlfin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/concorde_031024.html |title=Final Concorde flight lands at Heathrow |first=Jill |last=Lawless|publisher=Associated Press |date=26 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; G-BOAG left New York to a fanfare similar to that given for Air France’s F-BTSD, while two more made round trips, G-BOAF over the Bay of Biscay, carrying VIP guests including former Concorde pilots, and G-BOAE to Edinburgh. The three aircraft then circled over London, having received special permission to fly at low altitude, before landing in sequence at Heathrow. The captain of the New York to London flight was [[Mike Bannister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3211053.stm |title = End of an era for Concorde |publisher=BBC News |date = 24 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; G-BOAE (212) took its retirement flight on 17 November 2003 from Heathrow to [[Grantley Adams International Airport]] on Barbados, where the plane is now on display.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concordesst.com/retire/baretire.html British Airways Retirement]. concordesst.com&lt;/ref&gt;

All of BA's Concorde fleet have been grounded, drained of hydraulic fluid and their airworthiness certificates withdrawn. Jock Lowe, ex-chief Concorde pilot and manager of the fleet estimated in 2004 that it would cost £10–15&amp;nbsp;million to make G-BOAF airworthy again.&lt;ref name = &quot;vafhtk&quot;/&gt; BA maintain ownership and have stated that they will not fly again as Airbus ended support of the aircraft in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.britishairways.com/concorde/faq.html#17 |title = Will Concorde ever come out of retirement - e.g. for a Coronation flypast or airshows? |publisher=British Airways |accessdate = 14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2003, [[Bonhams]] held an auction of British Airways’ Concorde artefacts, including a nose cone, at [[Olympia Exhibition Centre|Kensington Olympia]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2003-12-02-concorde_x.htm |title=Concorde nose cone sells for half-million at auction |work=USA Today |date=12 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-87889450.html |title=Concorde Memorabilia Auction |publisher=Getty Images |date=1 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeds of around £750,000 were raised, with the majority going to charity. In 2007, BA announced that the advertising spot at the entrance to Heathrow Airport where a 40% scale model of Concorde was located would not be retained, the model is now on display at the [[Brooklands Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6509667.stm |title = Heathrow Concorde model removed |publisher=BBC News |date = 30 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration===
Although only used for spares after being retired from test flying and trials work in 1981, Concorde G-BBDG was dismantled and transported by road from [[Filton]] then restored from essentially a shell at the [[Brooklands Museum]] in [[Surrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.concordeproject.com/ |title = The Brooklands Concorde Project |publisher=Brooklands Museum |accessdate = 15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the youngest Concordes (F-BTSD) is on display at [[French Air and Space Museum|Le Bourget Air and Space Museum]] in Paris. In February 2010, it was announced that the museum and a group of volunteer Air France technicians intend to restore F-BTSD so it can taxi under its own power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/02/05/338114/air-france-concorde-to-taxi-again-under-own-power.html |title= Air France Concorde to taxi again under own power |publisher= Flightglobal |date=5 February 2010 |accessdate= 5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 May 2010, it was reported that a group comprising the British Save Concorde Group and the French Olympus 593 had begun work on inspecting the engines of a Concorde at Le Bourget Air and Space Museum, with the intent to restore the plane to be able to fly again in demonstrations and air shows. Flying in the opening ceremony for the 2012 London Olympics is also a goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8712806.stm  |title = Work starts in £15m plan to get Concorde Flying  |work= BBC News  |date= 29 May 2010 |accessdate = 29 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
===Environmental===
Prior to Concorde’s flight trials, the developments made by the civil aviation industry were largely accepted by governments and their respective electorates. The opposition to Concorde’s noise, particularly on the eastern coast of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918012,00.html |title = Here Comes the Concorde, Maybe |work=Time |date = 16 February 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jalc42&amp;div=28&amp;id=&amp;page= |title = Legal and Environmental ramifications of the Concorde |first = Robert M. |last = Allen |publisher=J. Air L. &amp; Com. |year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; forged a new political agenda on both sides of the Atlantic, with scientists and technology experts across a multitude of industries beginning to take the environmental and social impact more seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=N7422661AH&amp;q=Concorde+noise&amp;uid=788872723&amp;setcookie=yes |title = Recent studies into Concorde noise reduction |author=Hock, R. |coauthors = R.

Air L. &amp; Com |year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Concorde led directly to the introduction of a general noise abatement programme for aircraft flying out of [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|John F. Kennedy Airport]], many found that Concorde was quieter than expected,&lt;ref name=nova/&gt; partly due to the pilots temporarily throttling back their engines (known as &quot;noise abatement&quot; - spoken by the pilots as the command &quot;Noise&quot; during take off) to reduce noise during overflight of residential areas.&lt;ref&gt;Endres 2001, p 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the launch of revenue earning services, it had been noted that Concorde was quieter than several aircraft already commonly in service at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1108/eb035013 |url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&amp;hdAction=lnkpdf&amp;contentId=1682311 |title = Reducing noise with type 28 nozzle |journal=Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |year = 1973 |volume = 45 |issue = 4 |pages = 14 |publisher=MCB UP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{supersonic fuel efficiency}}
Concorde produced nitrogen oxides in its exhaust, which, despite complicated chemical interactions with other ozone-depleting chemicals, are understood to result in degradation to the [[ozone layer]] at the [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] altitudes it cruised.&lt;ref name = 'emissions'&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1126/science.270.5233.70 |url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;270/5233/70 |title = Emission Measurements of the Concorde Supersonic Aircraft in the Lower Stratosphere |author=Fahey, D. W. |coauthors =et al. |journal=Science |year = 1995 |volume = 270 |pages = 70 |issue = 5233}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been pointed out that other, lower-flying, airliners produce ozone during their flights in the troposphere, but vertical transit of gases between the layers is restricted. The small fleet operated meant overall ozone-layer degradation caused by Concorde was negligible.&lt;ref name = 'emissions'/&gt;

Concorde’s technical leap forward boosted the public’s understanding of conflicts between technology and the environment as well as the awareness of the complex decision analysis processes that surround such conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/cjel5&amp;div=9&amp;id=&amp;page= |title = Decision Analysis in Environmental Decisionmaking: Improving the Concorde Balance |first = Jon |last = Anderson |publisher=HeinOnline |year = 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the use of [[noise barrier|acoustic fencing]] alongside [[TGV]] tracks might not have been achieved without the 1970s controversy over aircraft noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Environmental Science and Engineering |date = November 2001 |url = http://www.esemag.com/1101/1101ed.html |title = Train à grande vitesse causes distress}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the [[CPRE]] have issued [[tranquillity]] maps since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cpre.org.uk/campaigns/landscape/tranquillity/national-and-regional-tranquillity-maps |title = National and regional tranquillity maps |publisher=Campaign to Protect Rural England |accessdate = 25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip disembark from a British Airways Concorde.jpg|thumb|right|[[Elizabeth II|HM The Queen]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|HRH The Duke of Edinburgh]] disembark Concorde.]]

Concorde was normally perceived as a privilege of the rich, but special circular or one-way (with return by other flight or ship) charter flights were arranged to bring a trip within the means of moderately well-off enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Business-and-Industry/24962872 |title = British Airways Concorde is expected to begin flying passengers again in next 6 weeks |publisher=Dallas Morning News |date = 23 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a symbol of great national pride to many in the UK and France; in France it was thought of as a French aircraft, in the UK as British.&lt;ref name = 'rus144'/&gt;{{verify source|Another reference is probably needed here.|date=October 2010}}

37 years after her first test flight, Concorde was announced the winner of the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the [[Design Museum]].

===Records===
The fastest transatlantic airliner flight was from [[London Heathrow]] to [[John F.

The only other supersonic airliner in direct competition with Concorde was the Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-144]], which was nicknamed &quot;Concordski&quot; by Western Europeans for its outward similarity to Concorde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912014,00.html |title = Soviet Union: Christening the Concordski |work=Time |date = 14 November 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet [[espionage]] efforts had resulted in the theft of Concorde blueprints, ostensibly to assist in the design of the Tu-144.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Yefim.

The American designs, the [[Boeing 2707]] and the [[Lockheed L-2000]] were to have been larger, with seating for up to 300 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%200377.html |title = The United States SST Contenders |publisher=Flight International |date = 13 February 1964 |pages = 234–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winchester 2005, p 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Running a few years behind Concorde, the winning Boeing 2707 was redesigned to a cropped delta layout; the extra cost of these changes helped to kill the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D11F6395F127A93C7A9178AD85F4D8685F9 |title = The Russians Lead With the SST.... |first = Richard D |last = Lyons |work=New York Times |date = 5 January 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation of US military aircraft such as the [[XB-70 Valkyrie]] and [[B-58 Hustler]] had shown that sonic booms were quite capable of reaching the ground,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/574189232.html?dids=574189232:574189232&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;date=Dec+19%2C+1961&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Daily+Tribune&amp;desc=B-58%27s+SONIC+BOOM+RATTLES+KENTUCKIANS&amp;pqatl=google  |title = B-58's Sonic Boom Rattles Kentuckians |publisher=Chicago Daily Tribune |date = 19 December 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the experience from the [[Oklahoma City sonic boom tests]] led to the same environmental concerns that hindered the commercial success of Concorde. The American government cancelled the project in 1971, after having spent more than $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944291,00.html |title = The Nation: Showdown on the SST |work=Time |date = 29 May 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only other large supersonic aircraft comparable to Concorde are [[strategic bombers]], principally the Russian [[Tupolev Tu-22]]/[[Tupolev Tu-22M|Tu-22M]] and [[Tupolev Tu-160|Tu-160]] and the American [[B-1B Lancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/tu160/ |title = Tu-160 Blackjack Strategic Bomber, Russia |publisher=airforce-technology.com |accessdate = 16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replacements in development===

The desire for a second-generation supersonic aircraft has remained within some elements of the aviation industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=APAB&amp;d_place=APAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F89C550A53D43FD&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title = French transport chief speculates about new-generation Concorde |publisher=Associated Press |date = 17 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72587838.html?dids=72587838:72587838&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+10%2C+1990&amp;author=Edward+Cody&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Partnership+Gears+Up+For+Concorde+Sequel%3B+British%2C+French+Firms+Sign+Plane+Pact&amp;pqatl=google |title = Partnership gears up for Concorde sequel; British, French firms sign plane pact |work=Washington Post |first = Edward |last = Cody |date = 10 May 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several concepts emerged quickly following the retirement of Concorde.

In November 2003, [[EADS]]—the parent company of the [[Airbus]] aircraft manufacturing company—announced that it was considering working with Japanese companies to develop a larger, faster replacement for Concorde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3231354.stm |title = Firm considers 'son of Concorde' |publisher=BBC News |date = 23 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8229113/ |title = Japan, France working on new supersonic jet |publisher=MSNBC |date = 15 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2005, [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|JAXA]], the Japan Aerospace eXploration Agency, undertook aerodynamic testing of a scale model of an airliner designed to carry 300 passengers at Mach 2 (working name ''[[NEXST]]''). If pursued to commercial deployment, it would be expected to be in service around 2020–2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4325634.stm |title = Japan tests supersonic jet model |publisher=BBC News |date = 10 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British company [[Reaction Engines Limited]], with 50% EU money, has been engaged in a research programme called ''[[LAPCAT]]'', which examined a design for a hydrogen-fuelled plane carrying 300 passengers called the ''[[Reaction Engines A2|A2]]'', potentially capable of flying at Mach 5+ non-stop from Brussels to Sydney in 4.6 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmowatch.com/entry/lapcat-aims-at-supersonic-civil-aviation/ |title= LAPCAT aims at supersonic civil aviation |date=30 August 2007 |author=|publisher=Gizmo Watch |accessdate= 3 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The follow-on research effort, ''LAPCAT II'' began in 2008 and is to last four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Space_Engineering/SEMD0G5KXMF_0.html |title=LAPCAT II - Facts and figures |date= 17 November 2009 |publisher=[[European Space Agency]] |accessdate= 10 August 2010 |quote=Starting date 01/10/2008 ... Duration 48 months}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, it was reported that [[Aerion]] Corporation had $3&amp;nbsp;billion of pre-order sales on its [[Aerion SBJ]] supersonic business jet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article3953823.ece |title = Orders for Aerion's Concorde executive jet are more than $3&amp;nbsp;billion |work=The Times |location=UK |first = Dominic |last = O'Connell |date = 18 May 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2010, the project continued with a testbed flight of a section of the wing.&lt;ref&gt;Nanveen.

Retrieved: 28 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Supersonic Aerospace International]]'s [[SAI Quiet Supersonic Transport|Quiet Supersonic Transport]] was a 12 passenger design from [[Lockheed Martin]] that was to cruise at Mach 1.6, and was to have created a sonic boom only 1% as strong as that generated by Concorde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/02/16/quiet.supersonic/index.html |publisher=CNN |title = Supersonic jet promises to fly nearly silent |date = 16 February 2007 |first = Eric |last = Hagerman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cannon}}

A '''cannon''' is any piece of [[artillery]] that uses [[gunpowder]] or other usually explosive-based propellants to launch a projectile. Cannon vary in [[caliber]], range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire, and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the battlefield. The word ''cannon'' is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as ''tube'', ''cane'', or ''reed''. The plural of cannon is cannon, the same word. In modern times, ''cannon'' has fallen out of common usage, usually replaced by &quot;guns&quot; or &quot;artillery&quot;, if not a more specific term, such as &quot;mortar&quot; or &quot;howitzer&quot;.

[[Technology of the Song Dynasty#Gunpowder warfare|First used in China]], cannon were among the earliest forms of gunpowder artillery, and over time replaced [[siege engine]]s—among other forms of aging weaponry—on the battlefield. The first [[hand cannon]] appeared during the 1260 [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] between the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] and [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] in the Middle East. The [[Cannon in the Middle Ages#Spread to Europe|first cannon in Europe]] were probably used in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], during the [[Reconquista]], in the 13th century, and [[English cannon]] were first deployed in the [[Hundred Years' War]], at the [[Battle of Crécy]], in 1346. It was during this period, the [[Middle Ages]], that cannon became standardized, and more effective in both the anti-infantry and siege roles. After the Middle Ages most large cannon were abandoned in favor of greater numbers of lighter, more maneuverable pieces. In addition, new technologies and tactics were developed, making most defenses obsolete; this led to the construction of [[star fort]]s, specifically designed to withstand artillery bombardment and the associated siege tactics. 

Cannon also transformed [[naval warfare]] in the [[early modern period]], as European navies took advantage of their firepower. As [[rifling]] became more commonplace, the accuracy of cannon was significantly improved, and they became deadlier than ever, especially to infantry. In [[World War I]], the majority of all deaths were caused by cannon; they were also used widely in [[World War II]]. Most modern cannon are similar to those used in the Second World War, except for heavy naval guns, which have been replaced by [[missile]]s. In particular, [[autocannon]] have remained nearly identical to their World War II counterparts.

In addition to their widespread use in warfare, cannon are also used for a number of peaceful purposes such as [[avalanche control]].

==Etymology and terminology==
[[File:Jaivan Cannon 2.jpg|thumb|[[Jaivana|Jaivan Cannon]] - World's largest Cannon on wheels]]
''Cannon'' is derived from the [[Old Italian]] word ''cannone'', meaning ''large tube'', which came from [[Latin]] ''canna'', in turn originating from the ''kannē''—[[Greek language|Greek]] for ''cane'', or ''reed'', and then generalized to mean any hollow tube-like object; ultimately deriving from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] term ''qanu'', meaning ''tube'' or ''reed''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Definition and etymology of cannon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Cannon|title=Definition and etymology of &quot;cannon&quot;|publisher=[[Webster's Dictionary]]|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cane|title=Etymology of &quot;Cane&quot;|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Definition and etymology of cane&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cane|title=Definition and etymology of &quot;cane&quot;|publisher=[[Webster's Dictionary]]|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word has been used to refer to a [[Gun#Terminology|gun]] since 1326 in Italy, and 1418 in England.

Prior to the invention of the cannon, [[projectile]] weapons existed using compressed air and steam. The invention of the cannon, driven by gunpowder, was first developed in China.

The first metal cannon was the ''[[pot-de-fer]]''.

By the 16th century, cannon were made in a great variety of lengths and bore diameters, but the general rule was that the longer the barrel, the longer the range. Some cannon made during this time had barrels exceeding {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length, and could weigh up to {{convert|20000|lb|kg}}.

The end of the Middle Ages saw the construction of larger, more powerful cannon, as well their spread throughout the world. As they were not effective at breaching the newer fortifications resulting from the development of cannon, [[siege engine]]s—such as [[siege tower]]s and [[trebuchet]]s—became less widely used. However, wooden &quot;battery-towers&quot; took on a similar role as siege towers in the [[gunpowder]] age—such as that used at [[Siege of Kazan (1552)|siege of Kazan]] in 1552, which could hold ten large-caliber cannon, in addition to 50 lighter pieces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kazan&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Nossov|first=Konstantin|pages=53–55|title=Russian Fortresses, 1480–1682|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|year=2006|isbn=1-84176-916-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable effect of cannon on warfare during this period was the change in conventional fortifications. [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] wrote, &quot;There is no wall, whatever its thickness that artillery will not destroy in only a few days.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Art of War (Machiavelli)&quot;/&gt; Although [[castle]]s were not immediately made obsolete by cannon, their use and importance on the battlefield rapidly declined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castles&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=Philip|title=Castles|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|date=1997-09-09|isbn=978-0-7894-2047-3|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of majestic [[tower]]s and [[merlon]]s, the walls of new fortresses were thicker, angulated, and sloped, while towers became lower and stouter; increasing use was also made of earthen, brick, and stone [[Breastwork (fortification)|breastworks]] and [[redoubt]]s. These new defenses became known as &quot;[[star fort]]s&quot;, after their characteristic shape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castles&quot;/&gt; A few of these featured [[Artillery battery|cannon batteries]], such as the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]]s' [[Device Forts]], in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castles&quot;/&gt; Star forts soon replaced castles in Europe, and, eventually, those in the Americas, as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpanishMain&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Chartrand|first=René|title=Spanish Main: 1492–1800|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|isbn=1-84603-005-6|year=2006|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cvcBWivXlekC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 15th century, several technological advancements were made, making cannon more mobile. Wheeled gun carriages and [[trunnion]]s became common, and the invention of the [[Limbers and caissons (military)|limber]] further facilitated the transportation of artillery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manucy, p. 5&quot;&gt;Manucy, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[field artillery]] became viable, and began to emerge, often used alongside the larger cannon intended for sieges.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manucy, p. 5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sadler&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Flodden 1513: Scotland's Greatest Defeat|last=Sadler|first=John|isbn=978-1-84176-959-2|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|year=2006|pages=22–23|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ZXX1SrxKTg0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA23,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Better gunpowders, improved cast-iron projectiles, and the standardization of calibers meant that even relatively light cannon could be deadly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manucy, p. 5&quot;/&gt; In ''[[The Art of War (Machiavelli)|The Art of War]]'', [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] observed that &quot;It is true that the [[arquebus]]es and the small artillery do much more harm than the heavy artillery.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Art of War (Machiavelli)&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Niccolò|last=Machiavelli|title=The Art of War|isbn=0-226-50046-2|page=74|year=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Ill.|authorlink3=Niccolò Machiavelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the case at [[Battle of Flodden Field|Flodden]], in 1513: the English [[field gun]]s outpaced the Scottish siege artillery, firing twice, or even thrice, as many rounds.&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the increased maneuverability, however, cannon were still much slower than the rest of the army: a heavy [[English cannon]] required 23 horses to transport, while a [[culverin]], nine, yet, even with this many animals transporting them, they still moved at a walking pace. Due to their relatively slow speed, and lack of organization, discipline, and tactics, the combination of [[pike and shot]] still dominated the battlefields of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Manucy, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Innovations continued, notably the German invention of the [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]], a thick-walled, short-barreled gun that blasted shot upward at a steep angle. Mortars were useful for sieges, as they could fire over walls and other defenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9053839/mortar|title=Encyclopedia Britannica Online - Mortar|accessdate=13 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cannon found more use with the Dutch, who learned to shoot bombs filled with powder from them. However, setting the bomb fuse in the mortar was a problem. &quot;Single firing&quot; was the first technique used to set the fuse, where the bomb was placed with the fuse down against the propelling charge. This practice often resulted in the fuse being blown into the bomb, causing it to blow up in front of the mortar. Because of this danger, &quot;double firing&quot; was developed, where the fuse was turned up and the gunner lighted the fuse and the [[touch hole]] simultaneously. This, however, required much skill and timing, and was especially dangerous when the gun failed to fire, leaving a lighted bomb in the barrel. Not until 1650 was it accidentally discovered that double-lighting was a superfluous process: the heat of firing was enough to light the fuse.&lt;ref&gt;Tunis, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] emphasized the use of light cannon and mobility in his army, and created new formations and tactics that revolutionized artillery. He discontinued using all 12&amp;nbsp;pounder—or heavier—cannon as field artillery, preferring, instead, to use cannon that could be manned by only a few men. One gun, called the &quot;leatheren&quot;, could be serviced by only two persons, but was abandoned, replaced by 4&amp;nbsp;pounder and 9&amp;nbsp;pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. These could be operated by three men, and pulled by only two horses. Also, Adolphus's army was the first to use a special cartridge that contained both powder and shot, which sped up loading, and therefore increased the rate of fire.&lt;ref&gt;Manucy, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he pioneered the use of [[canister shot]] against infantry, which was essentially a can, filled with musket balls.&lt;ref&gt;Tunis, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, for each thousand infantrymen, there was one cannon on the battlefield; Gustavus Adolphus increased the number of cannon in his army so dramatically, that there were six cannon for each one thousand infantry. Each regiment was assigned two pieces, though he often decided to arrange his artillery into [[Artillery battery|batteries]], instead. These were to destroy the enemy's infantry, while his cavalry [[flanking|outflanked]] their heavy guns.&lt;ref&gt;Manucy, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)|Battle of Breitenfeld]], in 1631, Adolphus proved the effectiveness of the changes made to his army, in particular his artillery, by defeating [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]]. Although severely outnumbered, the Swedes were able to fire between three and five times as many volleys of artillery without losing ground, due to their infantry's [[line (formation)|linear]] formations. Battered by cannon fire, and low on morale, Tilly's men broke rank, and fled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Archer|last=Jones|title=The Art of War in the Western World|location=New York City|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|year=2001|isbn=0-252-06966-8|page=235|url=http://books.google.com/?id=z2FRzcz2W0oC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA235,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fortbourtange.jpg|175px|thumb|right||[[Bourtange (fort)|Fort Bourtange]], a [[star fort]], was built with angles and sloped walls specifically to defend against cannon.]]
Around this time also came the idea of aiming the cannon to hit a target. Gunners controlled the range of their cannon by measuring the angle of elevation, using a &quot;gunner's [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]].&quot; Cannon did not have [[Sight (device)|sights]], therefore, even with measuring tools, aiming was still largely guesswork.&lt;ref&gt;Tunis, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter half of the 17th century, the French engineer [[Vauban]] introduced a more systematic and scientific approach to attacking gunpowder fortresses, in a time when many field commanders &quot;were notorious dunces in siegecraft.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffith&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffith|first=Paddy|title=The Vauban Fortifications of France|url=http://books.google.com/?id=eH1NtNGWQZ8C&amp;printsec=frontcover|year=2006|page=5|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-84176-875-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Careful [[sapping]] forward, supported by [[enfilading]] [[ricochet fire]], was a key feature of this system, and it even allowed Vauban to calculate the length of time a siege would take.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffith&quot;/&gt; He was also a prolific builder of star forts, and did much to popularize the idea of &quot;depth defense&quot; in the face of cannon.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p 29&lt;/ref&gt; These principles were followed into the mid-19th century, when changes in armaments necessitated greater depth defense than Vauban had provided for. It was only in the years prior to [[World War I]] that new works began to break radically away from his designs.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the century, principles long adopted in Europe specified the characteristics of the [[Royal Navy]]'s cannon, as well as the acceptable defects, and their severity. The [[United States Navy]] tested guns by measuring them, firing them two or three times—termed &quot;proof by powder&quot;—and using pressurized water to detect leaks.&lt;ref name=&quot;NavyBarbaryI&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Knox|first=Dudley W.|title=Naval Documents related to the United States Wars with the Barbary Powers, Volume I|year=1939|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[carronade]] was adopted by the Royal Navy in 1779; the lower muzzle velocity of the [[round shot]] when fired from this cannon was intended to create more wooden [[wikt:splinter|splinters]] when hitting the structure of an enemy vessel, as they were believed to be deadly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carronade&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dS4yZLvS0soC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA83,M1|title=Siege Train: The Journal of a Confederate Artilleryman in the Defense of Charleston|year=1996|publisher=[[University of South Carolina Press]]|location=[[Charleston, South Carolina]]|last=Manigault|first=Edward|coauthors=Warren Ripley|page=83|isbn=1-57003-127-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carronade was much shorter, and weighed between a third to a quarter of the equivalent [[long gun]]; for example, a 32&amp;nbsp;pounder carronade weighed less than a [[ton]], compared with a 32&amp;nbsp;pounder long gun, which weighed over 3&amp;nbsp;tons. The guns were, therefore, easier to handle, and also required less than half as much gunpowder, allowing fewer men to crew them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hms.org.uk/nelsonsnavycarronade.htm|title=The Historical Maritime Society|accessdate=2008-05-26|publisher=The Historical Maritime Society|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carronades were manufactured in the usual naval gun [[caliber]]s,&lt;ref&gt;12, 18, 24, 32, and 42&amp;nbsp;[[pound (weight)#Imperial_pound|pounders]], but 6&amp;nbsp;pounder and 68&amp;nbsp;pounder versions are known.&lt;/ref&gt; but were not counted in a [[ship of the line]]'s rated number of guns. As a result, the classification of Royal Navy vessels in this period can be misleading, as they often carried more cannon than were listed.

In the 1810s and 1820s, greater emphasis was placed on the accuracy of long-range gunfire, and less on the weight of a broadside. The carronade, although initially very successful and widely adopted, disappeared from the Royal Navy in the 1850s, after the development of steel, jacketed cannon, by [[William George Armstrong]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]]. Nevertheless, carronades were used in the American Civil War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carronade&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hms.org.uk/nelsonsnavycarronade.htm|title=Carronade|accessdate=2008-03-06|publisher=The Historical Maritime Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The superior cannon of the [[Western world]] brought them tremendous advantages in warfare. For example, in the [[Opium War]] in China, during the 19th century, British battleships bombarded the coastal areas and fortifications from afar, safe from the reach of the Chinese cannon. Similarly, the shortest war in recorded history, the [[Anglo-Zanzibar War]] of 1896, was brought to a swift conclusion by shelling from British battleships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Mark C.|title=Guinness Book of World Records, 2002 edition|page=112|publisher=[[Bantam Books]]|isbn=0-553-58378-6|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cynical attitude toward recruited infantry in the face of ever more powerful field artillery is the source of the term ''[[cannon fodder]]'', first used by [[François-René de Chateaubriand]], in 1814;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [[:wikisource:fr:De Buonaparte et des Bourbons|&quot;De Buonaparte et des Bourbons&quot;]] – full text in the French [[Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt; however, the concept of regarding soldiers as nothing more than &quot;food for powder&quot; was mentioned by [[William Shakespeare]] as early as 1598, in [[Henry IV, Part 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shakespeare|first=William|title=Henry IV, Part 1|year=1598}} Part 1, act 4, sc. 2, l. 65-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannon in the 20th and 21st centuries are usually divided into sub-categories, and given separate names. Some of the most widely used types of modern cannon are [[howitzer]]s, [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s, [[gun]]s, and [[autocannon]], although a few [[supergun]]s—extremely large, custom-designed cannon—have also been constructed. [[Nuclear artillery]] were experimented with, but were abandoned as impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear artillery|url=http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/films/film.aspx?ID=1|accessdate=2008-05-26|publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern artillery is used in a variety of roles, depending on its type. According to [[NATO]], the general role of artillery is to provide fire support, which is defined as &quot;the application of fire, coordinated with the maneuver of forces to destroy, neutralize, or suppress the enemy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=AAP-6 NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions|year=2007|publisher=[[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]|accessdate=2008-05-26|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/stanag/aap006/aap-6-2007.pdf|format=PDF|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to cannon, the term ''gun'' is often used incorrectly. In military usage, a gun is a cannon with a high muzzle velocity and [[indirect fire|comparatively flat trajectory]],&lt;ref name = &quot;mutuur&quot;/&gt; as opposed to other types of artillery, such as howitzers or mortars, which have lower muzzle velocities, and usually fire [[indirect fire|indirectly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Howitzer|title=Definition of &quot;Howitzer&quot;|accessdate=2008-05-26|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Mortar|title=Definition of &quot;Mortar&quot;|accessdate=2008-05-26|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Artillery====
{{main|Artillery}}
[[Image:4-14 Marines in Fallujah.jpg|thumb|Nine-person crew firing a US [[M198 howitzer]]|175px]]
By the early 20th century, [[infantry weapon]]s became more powerful and accurate, forcing most artillery away from the front lines. Despite the change to [[indirect fire]], cannon still proved highly effective during [[World War I]], causing over 75% of casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Manucy, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of [[trench warfare]] after the first few months of World War I greatly increased the demand for howitzers, as they fired at a steep angle, and were thus better suited than guns at hitting targets in trenches. Furthermore, their shells carried larger amounts of explosives than those of guns, and caused considerably less barrel wear. The German army took advantage of this, beginning the war with many more howitzers than the French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bruce I.|last=Gudmundsson|title=On Artillery|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=0-275-94047-0|year=1993|url=http://books.google.com/?id=O_-0w2WUDd0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP1,M1|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; World War I also marked the use of the [[Paris Gun]], the longest-ranged gun ever fired. This {{convert|200|mm|in|0|sing=on|abbr=on}} caliber gun was used by the Germans to bombard Paris, and was capable of hitting targets more than {{convert|122|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World War II|Second World War]] sparked new developments in cannon technology. Among them were [[sabot|sabot rounds]], hollow-charge projectiles, and [[proximity fuse]]s, all of which were marginally significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCamley|first=Nicholas J.|title=Disasters Underground|publisher=Pen &amp; Sword Military|year=2004|isbn=1-84415-022-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity fuse emerged on the battlefields of Europe in late December 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq96-1.htm|title=Radio Proximity (VT) Fuzes|accessdate=2008-05-26|date=2000-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used to great effect in [[anti-aircraft]] projectiles, proximity fuses were fielded in both the [[European Theater of Operations|European]] and [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific]] Theaters of Operations; they were particularly useful against [[V-1 flying bomb]]s and [[kamikaze]] planes. Although extensively used in naval warfare in anti-air guns, both the British and Americans feared unexploded proximity fuses could be reverse engineered, leading to their limited use in continental battles. During the [[Battle of the Bulge]], however, the fuses became known as the American artillery's &quot;Christmas present&quot; for the German army because of their effectiveness against German personnel in the open; frequently, they were used to disperse attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|title=Variable Time Fuse Contributed to the Victory of United Nations|year=2007|accessdate=2007-10-05|url=http://scienceservice.si.edu/pages/102001.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-tank gun]]s were also tremendously improved during the war: in 1939, the British used primarily [[Ordnance QF 2 pounder|2&amp;nbsp;pounder]] and [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|6&amp;nbsp;pounder]] guns.  By the end of the war, [[Ordnance QF 17 pounder|17&amp;nbsp;pounders]] had proven much more effective against German tanks, and 32&amp;nbsp;pounders had entered development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anti-tank guns&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=4IYXxrcx1_0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA29,M1|title=World War II: A Visual Encyclopedia|last=Keegan|first=John|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|year=2000|isbn=1-85585-878-9|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avalanchepress.com/BritainsAntiTankGuns.php|title=British Anti-Tank Guns|publisher=[[Avalanche Press]]|last=Rahman|first=Jason|date=2007-11|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, German tanks were continuously upgraded with better [[tank gun|main guns]], in addition to other improvements.

The tendency to create larger caliber cannon during the World Wars has been reversed in more recent years. The [[United States Army]], for example, sought a lighter, more versatile howitzer, to replace their aging pieces. As it could be towed, the [[M198 howitzer|M198]] was selected to be the successor to the World War II–era cannon used at the time, and entered service in 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;M198 Info&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.military.com/equipment/view/146534/m198-155mm-towed-howitzer.html|title=M198 information|accessdate=2008-05-26|publisher=Military.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still in use today, the M198 is, in turn, being slowly replaced by the [[M777 howitzer|M777]] Ultralightweight howitzer, which weighs nearly half as much and can be more easily moved.  Although land-based artillery such as the [[M198 howitzer|M198]] are powerful, long-ranged, and accurate, naval guns have not been neglected, despite being much smaller than in the past, and, in some cases, having been replaced by [[cruise missile]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cruise missile&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/issues/2001/Mar/Naval_Guns.htm|title=Affordable precision|publisher=National Defense Magazine|accessdate=2008-05-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061008233620/http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/issues/2001/Mar/Naval_Guns.htm |archivedate = October 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the {{Sclass|Zumwalt|destroyer|1}}'s planned armament includes the [[Zumwalt class destroyer#Advanced Gun System (AGS)|Advanced Gun System (AGS)]], a pair of 155&amp;nbsp;mm guns, which fire the [[Long Range Land-Attack Projectile]].

The AGS's barrels will be water cooled, and will be capable of firing 10 rounds per minute, per gun. The combined firepower from both turrets will give ''Zumwalt''-class destroyers the firepower equivalent to 18 conventional [[M-198]] howitzers.&lt;ref name=&quot;global_dd-x&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/dd-x.htm |title=DDG-1000 Zumwalt / DD(X) Multi-Mission Surface Combatant |accessdate=2008-05-26 |last=Pike |first=John |publisher=Global Security |date=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raytheon.com/products/ddg_1000/tech/ags/index.html |title=Raytheon Company: Products &amp; Services: Advanced Gun System (AGS) |accessdate=2008-05-26 |publisher=Raytheon, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the re-integration of cannon as a main armament in [[United States Navy]] ships is because satellite-guided munitions fired from a gun are far less expensive than a cruise missile, and are therefore a better alternative to many combat situations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cruise missile&quot;/&gt;

====Autocannon====
{{main|Autocannon}}
Autocannon have an automatic firing mode, similar to that of a [[machine gun]]. They have mechanisms to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a faster rate of fire than artillery, often approaching — and, in the case of [[Gatling gun]]s, surpassing — that of a machine gun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Autocannon Rate of Fire&quot;/&gt; While there is no minimum bore for autocannon, they are usually larger than machine guns, typically 20&amp;nbsp;mm or greater since World War II.

Most nations use these rapid-fire cannon on their light vehicles, replacing a more powerful, but heavier, [[tank gun]]. A typical autocannon is the [[25 mm caliber|25&amp;nbsp;mm]] &quot;[[M242 Bushmaster|Bushmaster]]&quot; [[chain gun]], mounted on the [[LAV-25]] and [[M2 Bradley]] [[Infantry fighting vehicle|armored vehicles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bushmaster&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:GAU-8 in A-10.jpg|thumb|right|135px|The [[GAU-8/A Avenger]] [[autocannon]], mounted in an [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]]]]
Autocannon are often found in aircraft, augmenting or replacing machine guns, providing greater firepower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aircraft Cannon&quot;/&gt;

==Use in Aircraft==
The first documented installation of a cannon on an aircraft was on the Voisin Canon in 1911, displayed at the Paris Exposition that year.
By [[World War I]], all of the major powers were experimenting with aircraft mounted cannon however their low rate of fire and great size and weight precluded any of them from being anything other than experimental. The most successful (or least unsuccessful) was the SPAD 12 Ca.1 with a single 37mm Puteaux mounted to fire between the cylinder banks and through the propeller boss of the aircraft's Hispano-Suiza 8C. The pilot (by necessity an ace) had to manually reload each round.{{cite book | last = Woodman | first = Harry | authorlink = Harry Woodman | title = Early Aircraft Armament - The Aircraft and the Gun up to 1918 | publisher = [[Arms and Armour Press]] | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-85368-990-3}} 

Between the wars trials with various weapons continued, with the Coventry Ordinance Works &quot;[[COW Gun]]&quot; being the most unusual as it was fixed at a sharp angle upwards. During this period autocannon finally became available for the first time and several fighters with the German Luftwaffe and Japanese Air Forces were fitted with 20mm cannon. They were continued to be installed as an adjunct to machine guns rather than as a replacement as the rate of fire was still too low and the rounds too heavy. There was a some debate in the RAF as to whether the greater number of possible rounds being fired from a machine gun, or a smaller number of explosive rounds from a cannon was preferable. Improvements during the war in regards to rate of fire allowed the cannon to displace the machine gun entirely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aircraft Cannon&quot;/&gt;

Cannon, as with machine guns, could be fixed to fire forwards in fighters (in the wings, in the nose or in a [[pannier]] under the wings or fuselage) or mounted in [[turrets]] on heavier aircraft though the latter was less common until the end of [[World War 2]].

As cannon were more effective against armor, they were increasingly used during the course of the [[Second World War]], and newer fighters usually carried two or four autocannon. The [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404]], [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20&amp;nbsp;mm cannon]], [[MG FF cannon|MG FF]], and their numerous variants became among the most widely used autocannon in the war.

Nearly all modern [[fighter aircraft]] are armed with an autocannon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aircraft Cannon&quot;/&gt; The largest, heaviest, and most powerful airborne cannon used by the [[military of the United States]] is the 30mm [[GAU-8/A Avenger]] Gatling-type rotary cannon;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.442fw.afrc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123055695|title=GAU-8/A|publisher=442nd Fighter Wing|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is surpassed only by the specialized artillery pieces carried on the [[AC-130]] gunship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.123exp-warfare.com/t/03804237449/|title=Information on the GAU-8/A|publisher=The Language of Weaponry|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannon are in principle capable of a very high rate of fire, but the ammunition is heavy, limiting the amount that can be carried. For this reason, both the 25&amp;nbsp;mm Bushmaster and the 30&amp;nbsp;mm [[RARDEN]] are deliberately designed with relatively slow rates of fire, so that they can operate for longer with a limited supply of ammunition. The typical rate of fire of modern autocannon ranges from 90 to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels — gatling guns — can have rates of fire of several thousand rounds per minute; the fastest of these is the [[Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-23|GSh-6-23]], which has a rate of fire of over 10,000&amp;nbsp;rounds per minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Autocannon Rate of Fire&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Anthony G.|page=241|title=Rapid Fire|publisher=Shrewsbury: Airlife Publishing Ltd.|year=2000|isbn=1-84037-435-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
{{main|Cannon operation}}
[[Image:Cannoniere 1652.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The parts of a cannon described in John Roberts' ''The Compleat Cannoniere'', London, 1652]]
[[File:Canon firing mvi 3662.ogg|thumb|Firing of a field gun of the early 17th century with a [[linstock]]]]
In the 1770s, cannon operation worked as follows: each cannon would be manned by two gunners, six soldiers, and four officers of artillery. The right gunner was to prime the piece and load it with powder, and the left gunner would fetch the powder from the magazine and be ready to fire the cannon at the officer's command. On each side of the cannon, three soldiers stood, to ram and sponge the cannon, and hold the ladle. The second soldier on the left tasked with providing 50 bullets.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1771&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Britannica|year=1771|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|location=Edinburgh|chapter=Gunnery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before loading, the cannon would be cleaned with a wet sponge to extinguish any smoldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by [[wadding]] of paper or hay, and the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1771&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Artillery gun crew-illustration.jpeg|right|thumb|175px|Cannon operation as described in the 1771 edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'']]
During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], a British gun team consisted of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore with a damp sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and another to load the gun with a bag of powder and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would prick the bagged charge through the vent hole, and fill the vent with powder. On command, the fifth gunner would fire the piece with a slowmatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Richard|title=Redcoat: the British Soldier in the age of Horse and Musket|year=2002|publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]|isbn=0-393-05211-7|url=http://books.google.com/?id=p5XamBYUu0AC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a cannon had to be abandoned such as in a retreat or surrender, the touch hole of the cannon would be plugged flush with an iron spike, disabling the cannon (at least until metal boring tools could be used to remove the plug). This was called &quot;spiking the cannon&quot;.

==Deceptive use==
{{main|Quaker Gun|Military deception}}
Historically, logs or poles have sometimes been used to simulate cannon, in order to mislead the enemy as to the strength of an emplacement. The &quot;[[Quaker Gun|Quaker gun trick]]&quot; was used by Colonel [[William Washington]]'s [[Continental army|Continentals]], during the [[American Revolutionary War]]; in 1780, approximately 100 Loyalists surrendered to them, rather than face &quot;bombardment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/revwar/revolution_day_by_day/1780_bottom.html|title=December of 1780|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[American Civil War]], Quaker guns were also used by the [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]], to compensate for their shortage of artillery. The decoy cannon were painted black at the &quot;muzzle&quot;, and positioned behind fortifications to delay [[Union Army|Union]] attacks on those positions. On occasion, real gun carriages were used to complete the deception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwarhome.com/terms.htm|title=Definitions of Civil War terms|publisher=www.civilwarhome.com/|accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Cannon have sometimes been used in classical pieces with a military theme. [[Giuseppe Sarti]] is believed to be the first composer to orchestrate real cannon in a musical work.  His ''[[Te Deum]]'' celebrates the Russian victory at [[Siege of Ochakov (1789)|Ochakov]] (1789) with the firing of a real cannon and the use of fireworks, to heighten the martial effect of the music.

One of the best known examples of such a piece is another Russian work, [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[1812 Overture]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/works/tchaikovsky/1812.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070828153345/http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/works/tchaikov/1812.html |archivedate=2007-08-28 |title=&quot;1812&quot; Overture in E Flat Major Op. 49 (1880) |author=Dave Lampson |last=Lampson |first=Dave |publisher=Classical Net |accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overture is properly performed using an artillery section together with the orchestra, resulting in noise levels requiring musicians to wear [[Earplug|ear protection]].&lt;ref name=july4 /&gt; The cannon fire simulates Russian artillery bombardments of the [[Battle of Borodino]], a critical battle in [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia]], whose defeat the piece celebrates.&lt;ref name=july4 /&gt; When the overture was first performed, the cannon were fired by an electric current triggered by the conductor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|accessdate=2008-05-26|title=Tchaikovsky|last=Lee|first=Ernest Markham|year=1906|publisher=G.

The [[hard rock]] band [[AC/DC]] also used cannon in their song &quot;[[For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=acdcsong&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t1014039|pure_url=yes}} |title=For Those About to Rock We Salute You |accessdate=2008-05-26 |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[For Those About to Rock We Salute You|album of the same name]] also featured a cannon on its cover;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r85|pure_url=yes}} |title=For Those About to Rock We Salute You |accessdate=2008-05-26 |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in live shows, replica Napoleonic cannon and [[pyrotechnics]] were used to perform the piece.&lt;ref name=acdcsong/&gt;

==Restoration==
Cannon recovered from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water; because of this, [[Extractive metallurgy|electrolytic reduction treatment]] is required to forestall the process of corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Welss|first=Carmen|title=Rescue Project &quot;Endeavour Cannon&quot;|publisher=[[Foundation for National Parks &amp; Wildlife]]|url=http://fnpw.com.au/enews4/cannon.htm|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cannon is then washed in [[Purified water#Deionization|deionized]] water to remove the [[electrolyte]], and is treated in [[tannic acid]], which prevents further [[rust]] and gives the metal a bluish-black color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Canadian Conservation Institute|url=http://www.preservation.gc.ca/gallery/cannon_e.asp|title=Preserving My Heritage - Before &amp; After Gallery - Cannon|accessdate=2008-05-26| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050329181011/http://www.preservation.gc.ca/gallery/cannon_e.asp| archivedate = March 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;union&quot;/&gt; After this process, cannon on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a [[wax]] sealant. A coat of [[polyurethane]] may also be painted over the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays.&lt;ref name=&quot;union&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/crl/Report6/union.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050101190851/http://nautarch.tamu.edu/crl/Report6/union.htm|archivedate=2005-01-01|title=Civil War Union Cannon Conservation, CRL Report 5|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Recently archaeologists say six cannon recovered from a river in Panama that could have belonged to legendary pirate [[Henry Morgan]] are being studied and could eventually be displayed after going through a restoration process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/28/AR2011022807113.html Retrieval March 02 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:3-Tastenmaus Microsoft.jpg|thumb|300px|A computer mouse with the most common standard features: two buttons and a scroll wheel, which can also act as a third button]]

In [[computing]], a '''mouse''' is a [[pointing device]] that functions by detecting [[two-dimensional]] motion relative to its supporting surface. Physically, a mouse consists of an object held under one of the user's hands, with one or more buttons. It sometimes features other elements, such as &quot;wheels&quot;, which allow the user to perform various system-dependent operations, or extra buttons or features that can add more control or dimensional input. The mouse's motion typically translates into the motion of a [[cursor (computing)|cursor]] on a [[computer display|display]], which allows for fine control of a [[graphical user interface]].

== Naming ==

The first known publication of the term &quot;''mouse''&quot; as a pointing device is in Bill English's 1965 publication &quot;Computer-Aided Display Control&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, &quot;mouse&quot;, sense 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Compact Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (third edition) and the fourth edition of ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' endorse both '''''computer mice''''' and '''''computer mouses''''' as correct plural forms for ''computer mouse''. Some authors of technical documents may prefer either ''mouse devices'' or the more generic ''pointing devices''. The plural ''mouses'' treats ''mouse'' as a &quot;[[English plural#Plurals (and singulars) of headless nouns|headless noun]]&quot;.

== Early mice ==

[[File:Mouse-patents-englebart-rid.png|thumb|Early mouse patents. From left to right: Opposing track wheels by Engelbart, Nov. 1970, {{US Patent|3541541}}. Ball and wheel by ''Rider'', Sept. 1974, {{US Patent|3835464}}. Ball and two rollers with spring by Opocensky, Oct. 1976, {{US Patent|3987685}}]]

The [[trackball]] was invented by Tom Cranston, Fred Longstaff and [[Kenyon Taylor]] working on the [[Royal Canadian Navy|Royal Canadian Navy's]] [[DATAR]] project in 1952. It used a standard Canadian [[five-pin bowling]] ball. It was not patented, as it was a secret military project.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=CrzgS5SoMzcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:%22Pioneers+in+Canadian+Electrical+Manufacturing%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=bvUPSK7vGIfWtgOmmdyaBg&amp;sig=lq7kwJoiGEoVuZi4kmnLjuUqxmU#PPA228,M1 Ferranti-Packard: Pioneers in Canadian Electrical Manufacturing]'', Norman R. Ball, John N. Vardalas, McGill-Queen's Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently, [[Douglas Engelbart]] at the [[Stanford Research Institute]] invented the first mouse prototype in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.macworld.com/article/137400/2008/12/mouse40.html The computer mouse turns 40]. Retrieved 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; with the assistance of his colleague [[William English (computer engineer)|Bill English]]. They christened the device the ''mouse'' as early models had a cord attached to the rear part of the device looking like a tail and generally resembling the common [[mouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxmouses.html|title=&quot;Mouses&quot; vs &quot;mice&quot;|work=alt.usage.english fast-access FAQ|accessdate = 2006-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engelbart never received any royalties for it, as his patent ran out before it became widely used in personal computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Shiels |last=Maggie |title= Say goodbye to the computer mouse |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7508842.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-07-17 |accessdate=2008-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the mouse was just a small part of Engelbart's much larger project, aimed at augmenting human intellect.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Evolving Collective Intelligence&quot; by Engelbart, Landau and Clegg&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:firstmouseunderside.jpg|thumb|left|The first computer mouse, held by inventor [[Douglas Engelbart]], showing the wheels that make contact with the working surface]]

Several other experimental pointing-devices developed for Engelbart's oN-Line System ([[NLS (computer system)|NLS]]) exploited different body movements{{ndash}} for example, head-mounted devices attached to the chin or nose{{ndash}} but ultimately the mouse won out because of its simplicity and convenience. The first mouse, a bulky device (pictured) used two gear-wheels perpendicular to each other: the rotation of each wheel translated into motion along one [[coordinate axis|axis]]. Engelbart received [[patent]] US3,541,541 on November 17, 1970 for an &quot;X-Y Position Indicator for a Display System&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/53.html |title=Retrieved 31 December 2006 |publisher=Invent.org |date=1925-01-30 |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Engelbart envisaged that users would hold the mouse continuously in one hand and type on a five-key [[chord keyset]] with the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/~encyclop/Engelbart.htm Retrieved 31 December 2006]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was preceded in the 19th century by the [[telautograph]], which also anticipated the [[fax machine]].

[[File:SmakyMouseAG.jpeg|thumb|A [[Smaky]] mouse, as invented at the [[EPFL]] by [[Jean-Daniel Nicoud]] and [[André Guignard]]]]

Just a few weeks before Engelbart released his demo in 1968, a mouse has already been developed and published by the German company [[Telefunken]]. Unlike Engelbart's mouse, the Telefunken model had a ball, as it can be seen in most later models until today. Since 1970 it was shipped as a part and sold together with Telefunken Computers. Some models from the year 1972 are still well preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;heise.de&quot;&gt;http://www.heise.de/newsticker/Auf-den-Spuren-der-deutschen-Computermaus--/meldung/136901&lt;/ref&gt;

The second marketed integrated mouse shipped as a part of a computer and intended for personal computer navigation came with the [[Xerox Star|Xerox 8010 Star Information System]] in 1981. However, the mouse remained relatively obscure until the appearance of the [[Macintosh 128k|Apple Macintosh]], which included an updated version of the original [[Apple Mouse#Lisa Mouse (A9M0050)|Lisa Mouse]]. In 1984 PC columnist [[John C. Dvorak]] dismissively commented on the newly-released computer with a mouse: &quot;There is no evidence that people want to use these things&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[John C. Dvorak]], ''San Francisco Examiner'', 19 February 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaplinvestors.net/2009/01/10/25-years-of-macintosh/ |title=25 Years of Macintosh |publisher=AAPLinvestors |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William English (computer engineer)|Bill English]], builder of Engelbart's original mouse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.superkids.com/aweb/pages/features/mouse/mouse.html | title = Doug Engelbart: Father of the Mouse (interview) | accessdate = 2007-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; invented the ball mouse in 1972 while working for [[Xerox PARC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | publisher = Byte | issue = 9/1981 | pages = 58–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ball-mouse replaced the external wheels with a single ball that could rotate in any direction. It came as part of the hardware package of the [[Xerox Alto]] computer. Perpendicular [[Optical chopper|chopper wheels]] housed inside the mouse's body chopped beams of light on the way to light sensors, thus detecting in their turn the motion of the ball. This variant of the mouse resembled an inverted [[trackball]] and became the predominant form used with [[personal computer]]s throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The Xerox PARC group also settled on the modern technique of using both hands to type on a full-size keyboard and grabbing the mouse when required.

[[File:Logitechms48.jpg|thumb|left|Mechanical mouse, shown with the top cover removed]]

The ball mouse has two freely rotating rollers. They are located 90 degrees apart. One roller detects the forward–backward motion of the mouse and other the left–right motion. Opposite the two rollers is a third one (white, in the photo, at 45 degrees) that is spring-loaded to push the ball against the other two rollers. Each roller is on the same shaft as an [[Rotary encoder#Incremental rotary encoder|encoder]] wheel that has slotted edges; the slots interrupt infrared light beams to generate electrical pulses that represent wheel movement.  Each wheel's disc, however, has a pair of light beams, located so that a given beam becomes interrupted, or again starts to pass light freely, when the other beam of the pair is about halfway between changes. Simple logic circuits interpret the relative timing to indicate which direction the wheel is rotating. This scheme is sometimes called [[quadrature encoder|quadrature encoding]] of the wheel rotation, as the two optical sensor produce signals that are in approximately [[quadrature phase]]. The mouse sends these signals to the computer system via the mouse cable, directly as logic signals in very old mice such as the Xerox mice, and via a data-formatting IC in modern mice. The driver software in the system converts the signals into motion of the mouse cursor along X and Y axes on the screen.

The ball is mostly steel, with a precision spherical rubber surface. The weight of the ball, given an appropriate working surface under the mouse, provides a reliable grip so the mouse's movement is transmitted accurately.

[[File:HawleyMarkIImice.jpg|thumb|left|Hawley Mark II Mice from the Mouse House]]

Ball mice and wheel mice were manufactured for Xerox by Jack Hawley, doing business as The Mouse House in Berkeley, California, starting in 1975.&lt;ref name=hawley&gt;{{cite web|url = http://library.stanford.edu/mac/primary/images/hawley1.html|title = The Xerox Mouse Commercialized|work = Making the Macintosh: Technology and Culture in Silicon Valley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.oldmouse.com/mouse/hawley/|title = Hawley Mark II X063X Mouses|work = oldmouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on another invention by Jack Hawley, proprietor of the Mouse House, [[Honeywell]] produced another type of mechanical mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=http://www.bergen.org/AAST/Projects/Engineering_Graphics/_EG2001/mouse/improvements.html#honeywell

[[Keytronic]] later produced a similar product.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=http://www.keytronic.com/home/products/specs/2hw73-1es.htm|title=Keytronic 2HW73-1ES Mouse|accessdate=2007-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern computer mice took form at the [[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]] (EPFL) under the inspiration of Professor [[Jean-Daniel Nicoud]] and at the hands of [[engineer]] and [[watchmaker]] [[André Guignard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Of-Mice-and-Men-and-PCs-43129.shtml |title=Retrieved 31 December 2006 |publisher=News.softpedia.com |date=1970-11-17 |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new design incorporated a single hard rubber mouseball and three buttons, and remained a common design until the mainstream adoption of the scroll-wheel mouse during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2004/explorers/interactive/profiles/computer.mouse/content.html|title=Inventions, computer mouse{{ndash}} the CNN site|accessdate=2006-12-31|work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050424150438/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2004/explorers/interactive/profiles/computer.mouse/content.html |archivedate = April 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, [[René Sommer]] added a [[microprocessor]] to Nicoud's and Guignard's design.&lt;ref name=wrs&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |title= Computer mouse inventor dies in Vaud |url=http://worldradio.ch/wrs/news/wrsnews/computer-mouse-inventor-dies-in-vaud.shtml?16283|work=[[World Radio Switzerland]] |publisher=|date=2009-10-14 |accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this innovation, Sommer is credited with inventing a significant component of the mouse, which made it more &quot;intelligent;&quot;&lt;ref name=wrs/&gt; though optical mice from Mouse Systems had incorporated microprocessors by 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = InfoWorld | title = People | author = Denise Caruso | volume = 6 | issue = 20 | publisher = InfoWorld Media Group, Inc. | page = 16 | issn = 0199-6649 | date = May 14, 1984 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=sy4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=optical-mouse+kirsch+microprocessor&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=optical-mouse%20kirsch%20microprocessor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of mechanical mouse, the &quot;analog mouse&quot; (now generally regarded as obsolete), uses [[potentiometers]] rather than encoder wheels, and is typically designed to be plug-compatible with an analog joystick. The &quot;Color Mouse&quot;, originally marketed by [[Radio Shack]] for their [[Color Computer]] (but also usable on [[MS-DOS]] machines equipped with analog joystick ports, provided the software accepted joystick input) was the best-known example.

=== Optical and Laser mice ===

[[File:WirelessMouse.JPG|thumb|A wireless optical mouse on a mouse pad]]

{{Main|Optical mouse}}

Optical mice make use of one or more [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) and an imaging array of [[photodiode]]s to detect movement relative to the underlying surface, rather than internal moving parts as does a mechanical mouse. A Laser mouse is an optical mouse that uses coherent (Laser) light.

=== Inertial and gyroscopic mice ===

Often called &quot;air mice&quot; since they do not require a surface to operate, inertial mice use a tuning fork or other [[accelerometer]] ([http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4787051.html US Patent 4787051]) to detect rotary movement for every axis supported. The most common models (manufactured by Logitech and Gyration) work using 2 degrees of rotational freedom and are insensitive to spatial translation. The user requires only small wrist rotations to move the cursor, reducing user fatigue or &quot;[[gorilla arm]]&quot;. Usually cordless, they often have a switch to deactivate the movement circuitry between use, allowing the user freedom of movement without affecting the cursor position. A patent for an inertial mouse claims that such mice consume less power than optically based mice, and offer increased sensitivity, reduced weight and increased [[ease of use|ease-of-use]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.freshpatents.com/Highly-sensitive-inertial-mouse-dt20060727ptan20060164393.php Fresh Patents&amp;nbsp;– Highly Sensitive Inertial Mouse]. Retrieved 31 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In combination with a wireless keyboard an inertial mouse can offer alternative ergonomic arrangements which do not require a flat work surface, potentially alleviating some types of repetitive motion injuries related to workstation posture.

=== 3D mice ===

Also known as bats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = 3D user interfaces | author = Doug A. Bowman, Ernst Kruijff and Ivan Poupyrev | publisher = Addison-Wesley | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780201758672 | page = 111 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=It5QAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=bat+3d-mouse&amp;dq=bat+3d-mouse }}&lt;/ref&gt; flying mice, or wands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Exploring advanced manufacturing technologies | author = Stephen F. Krar and Arthur Gill | publisher = Industrial Press Inc | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780831131500 | pages = 8–6–4 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=TGkfsC77pdwC&amp;pg=PT247&amp;dq=flying-mouse+3d+wand }}&lt;/ref&gt; these devices generally function through ultrasound and provide at least three [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. Probably the best known example would be [[3DConnexion]]/Logitech's SpaceMouse from the early 1990s.

In the late 1990s Kantek introduced the 3D RingMouse. This wireless mouse was worn on a ring around a finger, which enabled the thumb to access three buttons. The mouse was tracked in three dimensions by a base station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byte.com/art/9602/sec17/art6.htm |title=Retrieved 31 December 2006 |publisher=Byte.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a certain appeal, it was finally discontinued because it did not provide sufficient resolution.

A recent consumer 3D pointing device is the [[Wii Remote]]. While primarily a motion-sensing device (that is, it can determine its orientation and direction of movement), Wii Remote can also detect its spatial position by comparing the distance and position of the lights from the [[Infrared|IR]] emitter using its integrated IR camera (since the [[Wii Nunchuk|nunchuk]] accessory lacks a camera, it can only tell its current heading and orientation). The obvious drawback to this approach is that it can only produce spatial coordinates while its camera can see the sensor bar.

A mouse-related controller called the SpaceBall™ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vrlogic.com/html/3dconnexion/space_ball.html |title=Space Ball |publisher=Vrlogic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a ball placed above the work surface that can easily be gripped. With spring-loaded centering, it sends both translational as well as angular displacements on all six axes, in both directions for each.

November 2010 a German Company called Axsotic introduced a new concept of 3D mouse called 3D Spheric Mouse. This new concepts of a true 6 DOF input-device uses a ball to rotate in 3 Achses without any limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.axsotic.com|title=axsotic|publisher=axsotic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tactile mice ===

In 2000, [[Logitech]] introduced the &quot;tactile mouse&quot;, which contained a small [[actuator]] that made the mouse vibrate. Such a mouse can augment user-interfaces with [[Haptic technology|haptic]] feedback, such as giving feedback when crossing a [[window (computer)|window]] boundary. To surf by touch requires the user to be able to feel depth or hardness; this ability was realized with the first electrorheological tactile mice&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite journal | author8 = Heckner. T., C. Kessler, S. Egersdörfer, G. J. Monkman | title = Computer based platform for tactile actuator analysis | location = Actuator'06, Bremen | date = 14–16 June 2006 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; but never marketed.

== Connectivity and communication protocols ==
[[File:MS-Arc-Mouse.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Microsoft wireless Arc mouse]]
To transmit their input, typical cabled mice use a thin electrical cord terminating in a standard connector, such as [[RS-232C]], [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]], [[Apple Desktop Bus|ADB]] or [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]]. Cordless mice instead transmit data via [[infrared]] radiation (see [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]]) or [[radio]] (including [[Bluetooth]]), although many such cordless interfaces are themselves connected through the aforementioned wired serial buses.

While the electrical interface and the format of the data transmitted by commonly available mice is currently standardized on USB, in the past it varied between different manufacturers. A [[bus mouse]] used a dedicated interface card for connection to an [[IBM PC]] or compatible computer.

Mouse use in DOS applications became more common after the introduction of the Microsoft mouse, largely because Microsoft provided an open standard for communication between applications and mouse driver software. Thus, any application written to use the Microsoft standard could use a mouse with a Microsoft compatible driver (even if the mouse hardware itself was incompatible with Microsoft's). An interesting footnote is that the Microsoft driver standard communicates mouse movements in standard units called &quot;[[Mouse (computing)#Mouse speed|mickeys]]&quot;.

=== Serial interface and protocol ===

Standard PC mice once used the [[RS-232]]C serial port via a [[D-subminiature]] connector, which provided power to run the mouse's circuits as well as data on mouse movements. The Mouse Systems Corporation version used a five-byte protocol and supported three buttons. The Microsoft version used an incompatible three-byte protocol and only allowed for two buttons. Due to the incompatibility, some manufacturers sold serial mice with a mode switch: &quot;PC&quot; for MSC mode, &quot;MS&quot; for Microsoft mode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedos-32.sourceforge.net/showdoc.php?page=sermouse FreeDOS-32&amp;nbsp;– Serial Mouse driver]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PS/2 interface and protocol ===
{{details|PS/2 connector}}

With the arrival of the [[IBM Personal System/2|IBM PS/2]] personal-computer series in 1987, IBM introduced the [[eponymous]] PS/2 interface for mice and keyboards, which other manufacturers rapidly adopted. The most visible change was the use of a round 6-pin [[mini-DIN connector|mini-DIN]], in lieu of the former 5-pin connector. In default mode (called ''stream mode'') a PS/2 mouse communicates motion, and the state of each button, by means of 3-byte packets.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.computer-engineering.org/ps2mouse/ Computer Engineering Tips&amp;nbsp;– PS/2 Mouse Interface]
&lt;/ref&gt; For any motion, button press or button release event, a PS/2 mouse sends, over a bi-directional serial port, a sequence of three bytes, with the following format:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- align=center
!||Bit 7||Bit 6||Bit 5||Bit 4||Bit 3||Bit 2||Bit 1||Bit 0
|- align=center
!Byte 1
|YV||XV||YS||XS||1||MB||RB||LB
|- style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;
!Byte 2
|colspan=&quot;8&quot;|X movement
|- style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;
!Byte 3
|colspan=&quot;8&quot;|Y movement
|}

Here, XS and YS represent the sign bits of the movement vectors, XV and YV indicate an overflow in the respective vector component, and LB, MB and RB indicate the status of the left, middle and right mouse buttons (1 = pressed). PS/2 mice also understand several commands for reset and self-test, switching between different operating modes, and changing the resolution of the reported motion vectors.

In Linux, a PS/2 mouse is detected as a /dev/psaux device.

A [[Microsoft IntelliMouse]] relies on an extension of the PS/2 protocol: the ImPS/2 or IMPS/2 protocol (the abbreviation combines the concepts of &quot;IntelliMouse&quot; and &quot;PS/2&quot;). It initially operates in standard PS/2 format, for backwards compatibility. After the host sends a special command sequence, it switches to an extended format in which a fourth byte carries information about wheel movements. The IntelliMouse Explorer works analogously, with the difference that its 4-byte packets also allow for two additional buttons (for a total of five).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/input/mcompat.mspx Retrieved 31 December 2006]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Typhoon mouse uses 6-byte packets which can appear as a sequence of two standard 3-byte packets, such that an ordinary PS/2 [[device driver|driver]] can handle them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-13.html |title=Retrieved 31 December 2006 |publisher=Win.tue.nl |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mouse vendors also use other extended formats, often without providing public documentation.

For 3-D (or 6-degree-of-freedom) input, vendors have made many extensions both to the hardware and to software. In the late 90's Logitech created ultrasound based tracking which gave 3D input to a few millimeters accuracy, which worked well as an input device but failed as a profitable product. In 2008, Motion4U introduced its &quot;OptiBurst&quot; system using IR tracking for use as a Maya (graphics software) plugin.

=== Apple Desktop Bus ===
[[File:Apple Macintosh Plus mouse.jpg|thumb|[[Apple Macintosh Plus]] mice (left) Beige mouse (right) Platinum mouse 1986]]

In 1986 [[Apple Computer|Apple]] first implemented the [[Apple Desktop Bus]] allowing the daisy-chaining together of up to 16 devices, including arbitrarily many mice and other devices on the same bus with no configuration whatsoever. Featuring only a single data pin, the bus used a purely polled approach to computer/mouse communications and survived as the standard on mainstream models (including a number of non-Apple workstations) until 1998 when [[iMac]] joined the industry-wide switch to using [[USB]].
Beginning with the &quot;Bronze Keyboard&quot; PowerBook G3 in May 1999, Apple dropped the external ADB port in favor of USB, but retained an internal ADB connection in the [[PowerBook G4]] for communication with its built-in keyboard and trackpad until early 2005.

=== USB ===

The industry-standard [[USB]] protocol and its connector have become widely used for mice; it's currently among the most popular types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date = November 2007 | title = USB: A Technological Success Story | author = Jon Gan | journal = HWM | issn = 0219-5607 | publisher = SPH Magazines | page = 114 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=MesDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA49&amp;dq=imac+usb+1998&amp;cd=14#v=onepage&amp;q=imac%20usb%201998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cordless or wireless ===

[[File:Microsoft-wireless-mouse.jpg|thumb|A wireless mouse made for notebook computers]]

Cordless or wireless mice transmit data via [[infrared]] radiation (see [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]]) or [[radio]] (including [[Bluetooth]]).  The receiver is connected to the computer through a serial or USB port.  The newer nano receivers were designed to be small enough to remain connected in a laptop or notebook computer during transport, while still being large enough to easily remove.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Johnston. [http://peripherals.about.com/od/glossaryofpcterms/g/WhatIsANanoReceiver.htm What Is a Nano Wireless Receiver?] About.com. Accessed 2010-09-03&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==

A mouse typically controls the motion of a [[cursor (computers)|cursor]] in two dimensions in a graphical user interface (GUI). Clicking or hovering (stopping movement while the cursor is within the bounds of an area) can select files, programs or actions from a list of names, or (in graphical interfaces) through small images called &quot;icons&quot; and other elements. For example, a text file might be represented by a picture of a paper notebook, and clicking while the cursor hovers this icon might cause a text editing program to open the file in a window. (See also [[point-and-click]])

Users can also employ mice ''gesturally''; meaning that a stylized motion of the mouse cursor itself, called a &quot;[[mouse gesture|gesture]]&quot;, can issue a command or map to a specific action. For example, in a drawing program, moving the mouse in a rapid &quot;x&quot; motion over a shape might delete the shape.

Gestural interfaces occur more rarely than plain pointing-and-clicking; and people often find them more difficult to use, because they require finer motor-control from the user. However, a few gestural conventions have become widespread, including the [[drag-and-drop]] gesture, in which:

#The user presses the mouse button while the mouse cursor hovers over an interface object
#The user moves the cursor to a different location while holding the button down
#The user releases the mouse button

For example, a user might drag-and-drop a picture representing a file onto a picture of a [[Recycle bin (computing)|trash can]], thus instructing the system to delete the file.

Other uses of the mouse's input occur commonly in special application-domains. In interactive [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional graphics]], the mouse's motion often translates directly into changes in the virtual camera's orientation. For example, in the first-person shooter genre of games (see below), players usually employ the mouse to control the direction in which the virtual player's &quot;head&quot; faces: moving the mouse up will cause the player to look up, revealing the view above the player's head. A related function makes an image of an object rotate, so that all sides can be examined.

When mice have more than one button, software may assign different functions to each button. Often, the primary (leftmost in a [[right-handed]] configuration) button on the mouse will select items, and the secondary (rightmost in a right-handed) button will bring up a menu of alternative actions applicable to that item. For example, on platforms with more than one button, the [[Mozilla]] web browser will follow a link in response to a primary button click, will bring up a contextual menu of alternative actions for that link in response to a secondary-button click, and will often open the link in a new [[Tab (GUI)|tab]] or [[window (computing)|window]] in response to a click with the tertiary (middle) mouse button.

Different ways of operating the mouse cause specific things to happen in the GUI:

*Click: pressing and releasing a button.
**(left) [[Point-and-click|Single-click]]: clicking the main button.
**(left) [[Double-click]]: clicking the button two times in quick succession counts as a different gesture than two separate single clicks.
**(left) [[Triple-click]]: clicking the button three times in quick succession.
**Right-click: clicking the secondary button.
**Middle-click: clicking the ternary button.
*Drag: pressing and holding a button, then moving the mouse without releasing. (Use the command &quot;drag with the right mouse button&quot; instead of just &quot;drag&quot; when you instruct a user to drag an object while holding the right mouse button down instead of the more commonly used left mouse button.)
*Button [[Mouse chording|chord]]ing (a.k.a. Rocker navigation).
**Combination of right-click then left-click.

== Multiple-mouse systems ==

Some systems allow two or more mice to be used at once as input devices. 16-bit era [[home computer]]s such as the [[Amiga]] used this to allow computer games with two players interacting on the same computer. The same idea is sometimes used in [[collaborative software]], e.g. to simulate a [[whiteboard]] that multiple users can draw on without passing a single mouse around.

[[Microsoft Windows]], since [[Windows 98]], has supported multiple simultaneous pointing devices. Because Windows only provides a single screen cursor, using more than one device at the same time generally results in seemingly random movements of the cursor. However, the advantage of this support lies not in simultaneous use, but in simultaneous availability for ''alternate'' use: for example, a laptop user editing a complex document might use a handheld mouse for drawing and manipulation of graphics, but when editing a section of text, use a built-in [[trackpad]] to allow movement of the cursor while keeping his hands on the keyboard. Windows' multiple-device support means that the second device is available for use without having to disconnect or disable the first.

[[DirectInput]] originally allowed access to multiple mice as separate devices, but [[Windows NT]] based systems could not make use of this. When [[Windows XP]] was introduced, it provided a feature called &quot;Raw Input&quot; that offers the ability to track multiple mice independently, allowing for programs that make use of separate mice. Though a program could, for example, draw multiple cursors if it was a [[fullscreen]] application, Windows still supports just one cursor and keyboard.

As of 2009, [[Linux]] distributions and other [[operating system]]s that use [[Xorg|X.Org]], such as [[OpenSolaris]] and [[FreeBSD]], support unlimited numbers of cursors and keyboards through [[Multi-Pointer X]].

There have also been propositions of having a single operator use two mice simultaneously as a more sophisticated means of controlling various graphics and multimedia applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/7568/20620/00953558.pdf |title= Design and implementation of the double mouse system for a Window environment |publisher=IEEE Xplore |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buttons ==
[[File:Generic computer mouse with scrollwheel.jpg|thumb|right|A three-button scrollmouse]]
{{Main|Mouse button}}

[[Mouse button]]s are [[microswitch]]es which can be pressed (&quot;clicked&quot;) in order to select or interact with an element of a [[graphical user interface]].

The three-button scrollmouse has become the most commonly available design. As of 2007 (and roughly since the late 1990s), users most commonly employ the second button to invoke a [[context menu|contextual menu]] in the computer's software user interface, which contains options specifically tailored to the interface element over which the mouse cursor currently sits. By default, the primary mouse button sits located on the left-hand side of the mouse, for the benefit of right-handed users; left-handed users can usually reverse this configuration via software.

== Mouse speed ==

The computer industry often measures mouse sensitivity in terms of counts per inch (CPI), commonly expressed incorrectly as dots per inch (DPI){{ndash}} the number of steps the mouse will report when it moves one inch. In early mice, this specification was called pulses per inch (ppi).&lt;ref name=hawley/&gt; If the default mouse-tracking condition involves moving the cursor by one screen-pixel or dot on-screen per reported step, then the CPI does equate to DPI: dots of cursor motion per inch of mouse motion. The CPI or DPI as reported by manufacturers depends on how they make the mouse; the higher the CPI, the faster the cursor moves with mouse movement. However, software can adjust the mouse sensitivity, making the cursor move faster or slower than its CPI. {{As of|2007|alt=Current}} software can change the speed of the cursor dynamically, taking into account the mouse's absolute speed and the movement from the last stop-point. In most software{{Specify|date=April 2009}} this setting is named &quot;speed&quot;, referring to &quot;cursor precision&quot;. However, some software{{Specify|date=April 2009}} names this setting &quot;acceleration&quot;, but this term is in fact incorrect. The mouse acceleration, in the majority of mouse software, refers to the setting allowing the user to modify the cursor acceleration: the change in speed of the cursor over time while the mouse movement is constant.

For simple software, when the mouse starts to move, the software will count the number of &quot;counts&quot; received from the mouse and will move the cursor across the screen by that number of pixels (or multiplied by a rate factor, typically less than 1). The cursor will move slowly on the screen, having a good precision. When the movement of the mouse passes the value set for &quot;threshold&quot;, the software will start to move the cursor more quickly, with a greater rate factor. Usually, the user can set the value of the second rate factor by changing the &quot;acceleration&quot; setting.

Operating systems sometimes apply acceleration, referred to as &quot;[[ballistics]]&quot;, to the motion reported by the mouse. For example, versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] prior to [[Windows XP]] doubled reported values above a configurable threshold, and then optionally doubled them again above a second configurable threshold. These doublings applied separately in the X and Y directions, resulting in very [[nonlinear]] response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pointer ballistics for Windows XP | url = http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/pointer-bal.mspx | work = Windows Hardware Developer Center Archive | publisher = [[Microsoft Corporation]] | year = 2002 | accessdate = April 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mousepads ==

{{Main|Mousepad}}

Engelbart's original mouse did not require a mousepad;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gruntville.com/reviews/mousepads/corepad_roundup/index.php|title = Corepad Victory &amp; Deskpad XXXL|author = Eric &quot;Unit24&quot; Guy|accessdate = 2007-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the mouse had two large wheels which could roll on virtually any surface. However, most subsequent mechanical mice starting with the steel roller ball mouse have required a mousepad for optimal performance.

The mousepad, the most common mouse accessory, appears most commonly in conjunction with mechanical mice, because in order to roll smoothly, the ball requires more friction than common desk surfaces usually provide. So-called &quot;hard mousepads&quot; for gamers or optical/laser mice also exist.

Most optical and laser mice do not require a pad. Whether to use a hard or soft mousepad with an optical mouse is largely a matter of personal preference. One exception occurs when the desk surface creates problems for the optical or laser tracking, for example, a transparent or reflective surface.

== In the marketplace ==

Around 1981 Xerox included mice with its [[Xerox Star]], based on the mouse used in the 1970s on the Alto computer at [[Xerox PARC]]. [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Symbolics]], [[Lisp Machines]] Inc., and [[Tektronix]] also shipped workstations with mice, starting in about 1981. Later, inspired by the Star, [[Apple Computer]] released the [[Apple Lisa]], which also used a mouse. However, none of these products achieved large-scale success. Only with the release of the [[Apple Macintosh]] in 1984 did the mouse see widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;

The Macintosh design, commercially successful and technically influential, led many other vendors to begin producing mice or including them with their other computer products (by 1986, [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore Amiga]], [[Windows 1.0]], [[GEOS (8-bit operating system)|GEOS]] for the [[Commodore 64]], and the [[Apple IIGS]]).&lt;ref&gt;

The widespread adoption of graphical user interfaces in the software of the 1980s and 1990s made mice all but indispensable for controlling computers.

In November 2008, [[Logitech]] built their billionth mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shiels |first=Maggie |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/technology/7751627.stm |title=Logitech's billionth mouse |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-12-03 |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in gaming ==

[[File:Logitech-G5-Mouse-Rust.jpg|thumb|[[Logitech G5]] [[Optical mouse#Laser mice|laser mouse]] designed for gaming]]

Mice often function as an interface for PC-based [[video game|computer game]]s and sometimes for [[video game console]]s.

=== First-person shooters ===

Due to the cursor-like nature of the crosshairs in [[first-person shooter]]s (FPS), a combination of mouse and keyboard provides a popular way to play FPS games. Players use the X-axis of the mouse for looking (or turning) left and right, leaving the Y-axis for looking up and down. Many gamers prefer this primarily in FPS games over a [[gamepad]] or [[joypad]] because it provides a higher resolution for input.  This means they are able to make small, precise motions in the game more easily. The left button usually controls primary fire. If the game supports multiple fire-modes, the right button often provides secondary fire from the selected weapon. The right button may also provide bonus options for a particular weapon, such as allowing access to the scope of a sniper rifle or allowing the mounting of a bayonet or silencer.

Gamers can use a scroll wheel for changing weapons, or for controlling scope-zoom magnification. On most FPS games, programming may also assign more functions to additional buttons on mice with more than three controls. A keyboard usually controls movement (for example, [[Wasd|WASD]], for moving forward, left, backward and right, respectively) and other functions such as changing posture. Since the mouse serves for aiming, a mouse that tracks movement accurately and with less lag (latency) will give a player an advantage over players with less accurate or slower mice.

An early technique of players, [[circle strafing]], saw a player continuously strafing while aiming and shooting at an opponent by walking in circle around the opponent with the opponent at the center of the circle. Players could achieve this by holding down a key for strafing while continuously aiming the mouse towards the opponent.

Games using mice for input have such a degree of popularity that many manufacturers, such as [[Logitech]], [[Cyber Snipa]], [[Razer USA Ltd]] and [[SteelSeries]], make peripherals such as mice and keyboards specifically for gaming. Such mice may feature adjustable weights, high-resolution optical or laser components, additional buttons, ergonomic shape, and other features such as adjustable [[#Mouse speed|DPI]].

Many games, such as first- or third-person shooters, have a setting named &quot;invert mouse&quot; or similar (not to be confused with &quot;button inversion&quot;, sometimes performed by [[left-handedness|left-handed]] users) which allows the user to look downward by moving the mouse forward and upward by moving the mouse backward (the opposite of non-inverted movement). This control system resembles that of aircraft control sticks, where pulling back causes pitch up and pushing forward causes pitch down; computer [[joystick]]s also typically emulate this control-configuration.

After [[id Software]]'s ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'', the game that popularized FPS games but which did not support vertical aiming with a mouse (the y-axis served for forward/backward movement), competitor [[3D Realms]]' ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'' became one of the first games that supported using the mouse to aim up and down. This and other games using the [[Build engine]] had an option to invert the Y-axis. The &quot;invert&quot; feature actually made the mouse behave in a manner that users {{As of|2006|alt=now}} regard as non-inverted (by default, moving mouse forward resulted in looking down). Soon after, id Software released ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', which introduced the invert feature as users {{As of|2007|alt=now}} know it. Other games using the [[Quake engine]] have come on the market following this standard, likely due to the overall popularity of ''Quake''.

=== Home consoles ===

In 1988 the educational video game system, the [[VTech Socrates]], featured a wireless mouse with an attached mouse pad as an optional controller used for some games. In the early 1990s the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] video game system featured a [[SNES mouse|mouse]] in addition to its controllers. The [[Mario Paint]] game in particular used the mouse's capabilities, as did its successor on the [[Nintendo 64]]. [[Sega]] released official mice for their [[Sega Mega Drive|Genesis/Mega Drive]], [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] and [[Dreamcast]] consoles. [[NEC]] sold official mice for its [[PC Engine]] and [[PC-FX]] consoles. [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] released an official mouse product for the [[PlayStation]] console, and included one along with the [[Linux for PlayStation 2]] kit. However, users can attach virtually any [[USB]] mouse to the [[PlayStation 2]] console. In addition the [[PlayStation 3]] also fully supports [[USB]] mice. Recently the Wii also has this latest development added on in a recent software update.

[[Image:CivilDefence.svg|thumb|right|The international distinctive sign of civil defense, defined by the rules of [[International Humanitarian Law]] and to be used as a [[protective sign]]]]

'''Civil defense''', '''civil defence''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences]]) or '''civil protection''' is an effort to protect the citizens of a state (generally [[non-combatant]]s) from military attack. It uses the principles of [[emergency operation]]s: [[Hazard prevention|prevention]], [[#Mitigation|mitigation]], preparation, response, or [[emergency evacuation]], and recovery. Programmes of this sort were initially discussed at least as early as the 1920s and were implemented in many countries, but only became widespread in the USA after the threat of [[nuclear weapon]]s was realized.

Since the end of the [[Cold War]], the focus of civil defense has largely shifted from military attack to emergencies and disasters in general. The new concept is described by a number of terms, each of which has its own specific shade of meaning, such as '''crisis management''', '''[[emergency management]]''', '''emergency preparedness''', '''contingency planning''', '''emergency services''', and '''civil protection'''. In some countries, civil defence is seen as a key part of &quot;[[total defence|total defense]]&quot;. For example in [[Sweden]], the [[Swedish language|Swedish word]] ''totalförsvar'' refers to the commitment of a wide range of resources of the nation to its defence - including to civil protection.

== History ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Joan Baez]] --&gt;
[[Image:falloutprotection.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Civil Defense literature such as [[Fallout Protection]] were common during the cold war era.]]
In most of the N.A.T.O. states, such as the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] or [[Germany]] as well as the [then] [[Soviet Bloc]], and especially in the neutral countries, such as [[Switzerland]] and in [[Sweden]] during the 1950s and 1960s, many civil defense practices took place to prepare for the aftermath of a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], which seemed quite likely at that time. Such efforts were opposed by the [[Catholic Worker Movement]] and by peace activists such as [[Ralph DiGia]], on the grounds that these programs gave the public false confidence that they could survive a nuclear war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McReynolds |first=David |title=Ralph DiGia, 1914-2008 |journal=The [[Catholic Worker]] |year=2008 |volume=LXXV |issue=March–April |pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There was never strong civil defense policy because it fundamentally violated the doctrine of &quot;[[mutual assured destruction]]&quot; (M.A.D.) by making provisions for survivors. Also, a fully fledged total defense would have been too expensive. Above all, compared to the power of destruction a defense would have been ineffective. In the M.A.D. doctrine, there are not supposed to be any survivors for a civil defense system to assist (thus the acronym). Governments in the West sought to implement [[duck and cover|civil defense measures against nuclear war]] in the face of popular apathy and scepticism. The civil defense has different sirens like the [[thunderbolt siren]] to warn people of a coming attack.

[[Public Service Announcements]] including children's songs were created by government institutes and then distributed and released by radio stations to educate the public in case of nuclear attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocrcat.com/civildefense.htm Civil Defense &amp; CONELRAD recordings]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], civil defense was seen largely as defending against and recovering from an attack involving [[nuclear weapons]]. After the end of the Cold War, the focus moved from defense against nuclear war to defense against a terrorist attack possibly involving [[chemical weapon|chemical]] or [[biological weapon]]s; in the context of the United States this eventually led to the replacement of the [[United States civil defense]] with the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA). After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, in the United States the concept of civil defense has been revisited under the umbrella term of [[homeland security]] and all-hazards emergency management.

In [[Europe]], the triangle CD logo continues to be widely used. The old US civil defense logo was used in the FEMA logo until recently and is hinted at in the United States [[Civil Air Patrol]] logo. Created in 1939 by Charles Coiner of the N. W. Ayer Advertising Agency, it was used throughout World War II and the Cold War era. In 2006, the National Emergency Management Association&amp;mdash;a U.S. organization made up of state emergency managers&amp;mdash;&quot;officially&quot; retired the Civil Defense triangle logo, replacing it with a stylized EM (standing for [[Emergency management]]).[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/01/washington/01civil.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin]. The name and logo, however, continue to be used by [[Hawaii]] State Civil Defense [http://www.scd.hawaii.gov/] and [[Guam]] Homeland Security/Office of Civil Defense [http://www.guamhs.org/main/].

The term &quot;civil protection&quot; is currently widely used within the [[European Union]] to refer to government-approved systems and resources tasked with protecting the non combat population, primarily in the event of natural and technological disasters.  In recent years there has been emphasis on preparedness for technological disasters resulting from terrorist attack. Within EU countries the term &quot;crisis management&quot; emphasises the political and security dimension rather than measures to satisfy the immediate needs of the population.

In Australia, civil defense is the responsibility of the volunteer-based [[State Emergency Service]].

== Importance ==
Relatively small investments in preparation can speed up recovery by months or years and thereby prevent millions of deaths by hunger, cold and disease.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} According to [[human capital]] theory in [[economics]], a country's population is more valuable than all of the land, factories and other assets that it possesses. People rebuild a country after its destruction, and it is therefore important for the economic security of a country that it protect its people. According to [[psychology]], it is important for people to feel like they are in control of their own destiny, and preparing for uncertainty via civil defense may help to achieve this. If the people are not in control, and the preparations ineffective, the government loses its credibility and the respect of its citizens.

In the United States, the federal civil defense program was authorized by statute and ran from 1951 to 1994. Originally authorized by Public Law 920 of the 81st Congress it was repealed by Public Law 93-337 in 1994. Small portions of that statutory scheme were incorporated into the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Public Law 100-707) which superseded in part, amended in part, and supplemented in part the [[Disaster Relief Act of 1974]] (Public Law 93-288). In the portions of the civil defense statute incorporated into the [[Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act]] the primary modification was to use the term &quot;[[Emergency Preparedness]]&quot; wherever the term &quot;Civil Defense&quot; previously appeared in the statutory language.

An important concept initiated by President [[Jimmy Carter]] was the so-called &quot;Crisis Relocation Program&quot; administered as part of the federal civil defense program. That effort largely failed under President Ronald Reagan who continued the Carter initiative because of opposition from areas potentially hosting the relocated population. SEE Presidential Review Memorandum/NSC-32 [http://www.fas.or/irp/offdocs/prm/prm32.pdf] (September 30, 1977) and Presidential Decision Memorandum 42 [http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/pd/pd41.pdf].

== Threat assessment ==

Threats to civilians and civilian life include NBC ([[Nuclear warfare|Nuclear]], [[Biological warfare|Biological]], and [[Chemical warfare]]) and others, like the more modern term [[CBRN]], Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear. Threat assessment involves studying each threat so that preventative measures can be built into civilian life.

;Conventional

This would be conventional explosives. A [[blast shelter]] designed to protect only from radiation and fallout, however, would be much more vulnerable to conventional explosives,also see [[fallout shelter]].

;Nuclear

Shelter intended to protect against nuclear blast effects would include thick concrete and other sturdy elements which are resistant to conventional explosives. The biggest threats from a nuclear attack are effects from the blast, fires and radiation. One of the most prepared countries for a nuclear attack is [[Switzerland]]. Almost every building in Switzerland has an ''abri'' (shelter) against the initial nuclear bomb and explosion followed by the fallout. Because of this, many people use it as a safe to protect valuables, photos, financial information and so on. Switzerland also has air-raid and nuclear raid sirens in every village.

;Dirty Bomb
A &quot;radiologically enhanced weapon,&quot; or &quot;[[dirty bomb]]&quot; uses an explosive to spread radioactive material. This is a theoretical risk, and such weapons have not been used by terrorists. Depending on the quantity of the radioactive material, the dangers may be mainly psychological. Toxic effects can be managed by standard [[dangerous goods|hazmat]] techniques.

;Biological

The threat here is primarily from disease-causing microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses.

;Chemical

Various chemical agents are a threat such as [[nerve gas]] ([[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], [[Sarin]], and so on.).

== Stages ==
=== Mitigation ===
[[Image:cdpatch.png|thumb|right|250px|A [[United States civil defense]] patch from [[Cuyahoga County]], [[Ohio]]]]
[[Image:T38.jpg|thumb|Civil defense logo on an Air raid siren in [[Topeka, Kansas]].]]
[[Image:Civil Defense Logo.JPG|thumb|Civil Defense logo on a Thunderbolt 1003 siren.]]
Mitigation is the process of actively preventing the war or the release of [[nuclear weapon]]s. It includes policy analysis, diplomacy, political measures, [[nuclear disarmament]] and more military responses such as a [[National Missile Defense]] and [[air defense artillery]]. In the case of counter-terrorism, mitigation would include diplomacy, [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] gathering and direct action against terrorist groups. Mitigation may also be reflected in long-term planning such as the design of the [[interstate highway]] system and the placement of military bases further away from populated areas.

=== Preparation ===

Preparation consists of building [[blast shelter]]s, and pre-positioning information, supplies and emergency infrastructure. For example, most larger cities in the U.S. now have underground emergency operations centers that can perform civil defense coordination. FEMA also has many underground facilities located near major railheads such as the one in [[Denton, Texas]] and [[Mount Weather]], Virginia for the same purpose. Other measures would include continuous government inventories of grain silos, the [[Strategic National Stockpile]], the uncapping of the [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve]], the dispersal of truck-transportable bridges, water purification, mobile refineries, mobile decontamination facilities, mobile general and special purpose disaster mortuary facilities such as [[Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team]] (DMORT) and [[DMORT-WMD]], and other aids such as temporary housing to speed civil recovery.

On an individual scale, one means of preparation for exposure to [[nuclear fallout]] is to obtain [[potassium iodide]] (KI) tablets as a safety measure to protect the human [[thyroid]] gland from the uptake of dangerous radioactive [[iodine]]. Another measure is to cover the nose, mouth and eyes with a piece of cloth and sunglasses to protect against [[alpha particle]]s, which are only an internal hazard.

To support and supplement efforts at national, regional and local level with regard to disaster prevention, the [[wikt:preparedness|preparedness]] of those responsible for civil protection and the intervention in the event of disaster
* To establish a framework for effective and rapid cooperation between different civil protection services when mutual assistance is needed (police, [[fire service]], [[healthcare]] service, [[public utility]] [[wikt:provider|provider]], voluntary agencies).
*To set up and implement training programs for intervention and coordination teams as well as assessment experts including joint courses and exchange systems.
*To enhance the coherence of actions undertaken at international level in the field of civil protection especially in the context of cooperation.

Preparing also includes sharing information:
*To contribute to the information of the public in view of increasing the level of self-protection of citizens
*To collect and disseminate validated emergency information
*To pool information on national civil protection capabilities, military and medical resources.
*To ensure efficient information sharing between the different authorities.

=== Response ===

[[Image:Air-raid-siren-downtown-losangeles.png|thumb|This Federal Signal SD-10 in Los Angeles shows signs of neglect.]]
Response consists first of warning civilians so they can enter [[Fallout Shelter]]s and protect assets.

Staffing a response is always full of problems in a civil defense emergency. After an attack, conventional full-time emergency services are dramatically overloaded, with conventional fire fighting response times often exceeding several days. Some capability is maintained by local and state agencies, and an emergency reserve is provided by specialized military units, especially [[Civil Affairs|civil affairs]], [[Military Police]], [[Judge Advocate]]s and [[combat engineer]]s.

However, the traditional response to massed attack on civilian population centers is to maintain a mass-trained force of volunteer emergency workers. Studies in [[World War II]] showed that lightly trained (40 hours or less) civilians in organized teams can perform up to 95% of emergency activities when trained, liaised and supported by local government. In this plan, the populace rescues itself from most situations, and provides information to a central office to prioritize professional emergency services.

In the 1990s, this concept was revived by the [[Los Angeles Fire Department]] to cope with civil emergencies such as [[earthquake]]s. The program was widely adopted, providing standard terms for organization. In the U.S., this is now official federal policy, and it is implemented by [[community emergency response team]]s, under the Department of Homeland Security, which certifies training programs by local governments, and registers &quot;certified disaster service workers&quot; who complete such training.

=== Recovery ===

Recovery consists of rebuilding damaged infrastructure, buildings and production. The recovery phase is the longest and ultimately most expensive phase. Once the immediate &quot;crisis&quot; has passed, cooperation fades away and recovery efforts are often politicized or seen as economic opportunities.

Preparation for recovery can be very helpful. If mitigating resources are dispersed before the attack, cascades of social failures can be prevented. One hedge against bridge damage in riverine cities is to subsidize a &quot;tourist ferry&quot; that performs scenic cruises on the river. When a bridge is down, the ferry takes up the load.

== Implementation ==

Some advocates&lt;!-- &quot;Who&quot; would only make sense if the advocates were doing an action --&gt; believe that government should change building codes to require [[autonomous building]]s in order to reduce civil societies' dependence on complex, fragile networks of social services.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

An example of a crucial need after a general nuclear attack would be the fuel required to transport every other item for recovery. However, [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] are large, immobile, and probable targets. One proposal is to preposition truck-mounted fuel refineries near oil fields and bulk storage depots. Other critical infrastructure needs would include road and bridge repair, [[telecommunication|communications]], electric power, food production, and potable water.

== Civil defense organizations ==
[[Image:United States Civil Defense Roundel.svg|right|thumb|The old [[United States civil defense]] logo. The triangle emphasized the 3-step Civil Defense philosophy used before the foundation of FEMA and [[Comprehensive Emergency Management]]. ]]
Civil Defense is also the name of a number of organizations around the world dedicated to protecting civilians from military attacks, as well as to providing rescue services after natural and human-made disasters alike.

In a few countries such as [[Jordan]] and [[Singapore]] (see [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]]), civil defense is essentially the same organization as the [[fire brigade]]. In most countries however, civil defense is a government-managed, volunteer-staffed organization, separate from the fire brigade and the [[ambulance]] service. As the threat of Cold War eased, a number of such civil defense organizations have been disbanded or mothballed (as in the case of the [[Royal Observer Corps]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States civil defense]]), while others have changed their focuses into providing rescue services after natural disasters (as for the [[State Emergency Service]] in [[Australia]]). However the ideals of Civil Defense have been brought back in the [[United States]] under FEMA's [[Citizen Corps]] and [[Community Emergency Response Team]] (CERT). In the [[United Kingdom]] the roles carried out by Civil Defence (note UK spelling) fall to voluntary groups such as [[RAYNET]], [[Search and Rescue]] Teams and [[4x4 Response]]. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the Civil Defence is still very much an active organisation and is occasionally called upon for its [[Auxiliary Fire Service]] and ambulance/rescue services when emergencies such as flash flooding occur and require additional manpower. The organisation has units of trained firemen and medical responders based in key areas around the country.

These [[amino acid]]s contain an [[aromatic]] ring in their [[substituent|sidechain]] that fits into a '[[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] pocket' (the S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; position) of the enzyme.

==Activation of chymotrypsin==
Chymotrypsin is synthesized in the [[pancreas]] by [[protein biosynthesis]] as a [[wiktionary:Precursor|precursor]] called [[chymotrypsinogen]] that is enzymatically inactive. On cleavage by [[trypsin]] into two parts that are still connected via an S-S bond, cleaved chymotrypsinogen molecules can activate each other by removing two small peptides in a ''trans''-proteolysis. The resulting molecule is active chymotrypsin, a three-[[peptide|polypeptide]] molecule interconnected via [[disulfide bond]]s.

==Action and kinetics of chymotrypsin==
''In vivo'', chymotrypsin is a proteolytic enzyme (Serine protease) acting in the digestive systems of mammals and other organisms. It facilitates the cleavage of peptide bonds by a [[hydrolysis]] reaction, a process that, albeit thermodynamically favourable, occurs extremely slowly in the absence of a catalyst. The main substrates of chymotrypsin include [[tryptophan]], [[tyrosine]], [[phenylalanine]], [[leucine]], and [[methionine]], which are cleaved at the carboxyl terminal. Like many proteases, chymotrypsin will also hydrolyse amide bonds ''in vitro'', a virtue that enabled the use of substrate analogs such as N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine p-nitrophenyl amide for enzyme assays.

[[Image:Mechanismus.gif|thumb|left|450px|Mechanism of peptide bond cleavage in &amp;alpha;-chymotrypsin]]

Chymotrypsin cleaves peptide bonds by attacking the unreactive carbonyl group with a powerful nucleophile, the [[Sequence of proteases - chymotrypsin A - trypsin - elastase|serine 195 residue]] located in the active site of the enzyme, which briefly becomes covalently bonded to the substrate, forming an enzyme-substrate intermediate. 

These findings rely on inhibition assays and the study of the kinetics of cleavage of the aforementioned substrate, exploiting the fact that the enzyme-substrate intermediate [[4-Nitrophenol|''p''-nitrophenolate]] has a yellow colour, enabling us to measure its concentration by measuring light absorbance at 410 nm.

It was found that the reaction of chymotrypsin with its substrate takes place in two stages, an initial “burst” phase at the beginning of the reaction and a steady-state phase following [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics]]. It is also called &quot;ping-pong&quot; mechanism. The mode of action of chymotrypsin explains this as hydrolysis takes place in two steps. First acylation of the substrate to form an acyl-enzyme intermediate and then deacylation in order to return the enzyme to its original state.

In the [[United States]] a '''community emergency response team''' ('''CERT''') can refer to
* one of five federal programs promoted under the umbrella organization [[Citizen Corps]], which is funded in part by the Stafford Act;
* an implementation of the federal CERT program, administered by a local sponsoring agency, which receives Stafford grant funding, and provides standardized training and an implementation framework to community members;
* an organization of [[volunteer]] emergency workers who have received specific training in basic disaster response skills, and who agree to supplement existing [[emergency responder]]s in the event of a major disaster.

Sometimes programs and organizations take different names, such as '''neighborhood emergency response team''' ('''NERT'''), or '''neighborhood emergency team''' ('''NET''').

The concept of civilian auxiliaries is similar to [[civil defense]], which has a longer history. The CERT concept differs because it includes nonmilitary emergencies, and is coordinated with all levels of emergency authorities, local to national, via an overarching [[incident command system]].

&lt;!-- basic training in [[disaster]] [[preparedness]], the [[incident command system]],disaster [[fire suppression]], basic disaster [[medical]] operations, light [[search and rescue]], and team operations. --&gt;

== History ==
The concept of widespread local volunteer emergency responders was implemented and developed by the [[Los Angeles Fire Department]] in 1985. The [[Whittier Narrows]] [[earthquake]] of 1987 showed the need for preparing citizens to take care of themselves and their loved ones after a disaster.[http://www.citizencorps.gov/cert/about.shtm]

In the 1989 [[Loma Prieta Earthquake]], residents of [[San Francisco|San Francisco's]] Marina District help run lengths of fire hose from a fireboat to firefighters ashore after the hydrant system failed. Later, the Fire Department worked with the community to form the City's NERT program (Neighborhood Emergency Response Team).[http://www.sfgov.org/site/sfnert_index.asp]

By 1993, the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] had made the program available nationwide; by 2003, CERT programs were offered in 45 states. [http://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/display?theme=15&amp;content=835]

CERT and Citizen Corps were transferred to the Office of Domestic Preparedness (now the Office of Grants and Training) in August 2004.

== CERT Organization ==
A [[local government]] agency, often a [[fire department]] or [[emergency management]] agency, agrees to sponsor CERT within its jurisdiction. The sponsoring agency liases with, deploys and may train or supervise the training of CERT members. The sponsoring agency receives and disburses federal and state Citizen Corps grant funds allocated to its CERT program. Many sponsoring agencies employ a full-time community-service person as liaison to the CERT members. In some communities, the liaison is a volunteer and CERT member. 

As people are trained and agree to join the community emergency response effort, a CERT is formed. Initial efforts may result in a team with only a few members from across the community. As the number of members grow, a single community-wide team may subdivide. Multiple CERTs are organized into a hierarchy of teams consistent with [[Incident Command System|ICS]] principles. This follows the [[Incident Command System]] (ICS) principle of [[Span of control]] until the ideal distribution is achieved: one or more teams are formed at each neighborhood within a community.

Some CERTs form a club or service corporation, and recruit volunteers to perform training on behalf of the sponsoring agency. This reduces the financial and human resource burden on the sponsoring agency. 

When not responding to disasters, CERTs may
* raise funds for emergency response equipment in their community;
* provide first-aid, crowd control or other services at community events;
* hold planning, training, or recruitment meetings;
* conduct or participate in disaster response exercises.

Some sponsoring agencies use Citizen Corps grant funds to purchase response tools and equipment for their members and team(s) (subject to Stafford Act limitations). Most CERTs also acquire their own supplies, tools, and equipment. As community members, CERTs are aware of the specific needs of their community and equip the teams accordingly.

== CERT Response ==
The basic idea is to use CERT to perform the large number of tasks needed in emergencies. This frees highly trained professional responders for more technical tasks. Much of CERT training concerns the Incident Command System and organization, so CERT members fit easily into larger command structures.

A team may self-activate (self-deploy) when their own neighborhood is affected by disaster. An effort is made to report their response status to the sponsoring agency. A self-activated team will size-up the loss in their neighborhood and begin performing the skills they have learned to minimize further loss of life, property, and environment. They will continue to respond safely until redirected or relieved by the sponsoring agency or professional responders on-scene.

Teams in neighborhoods not affected by disaster may be deployed or activated by the sponsoring agency. The sponsoring agency may communicate with neighborhood CERT leaders through an [[Organic (military)|organic]] communication team. In some areas the communications may be by [[amateur radio]], [[Family Radio Service|FRS]], [[GMRS]] or [[MURS]] radio, dedicated telephone or fire-alarm networks. In other areas, relays of bicycle-equipped runners can effectively carry mail between the teams and the local emergency operations center.

The sponsoring agency may activate and dispatch teams in order to gather or respond to intelligence about an incident. Teams may be dispatched to affected neighborhoods, or organized to support operations. CERT members may augment support staff at an [[incident command post]] or [[Emergency Operations Center]]. Additional teams may also be created to guard the morgue, locate supplies and food, convey messages to and from other CERT teams and local authorities, and other duties on an as-needed basis as identified by the team leader.

In the short term, CERTs perform data gathering, especially to locate mass-casualties requiring professional response, or situations requiring professional rescues, simple fire-fighting tasks (for example, small fires, turning off gas), light search and rescue, damage evaluation of structures, [[triage]] and [[first aid]]. In the longer term, CERTs may assist in the evacuation of residents, or assist with setting up a neighborhood shelter.

While responding, CERT members are temporary volunteer government workers. In some areas, (such as [[California]] and [[Kansas]]) registered, activated CERT members are eligible for worker's compensation for on-the-job injuries during declared disasters.

== CERT Team Member Roles ==
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommends that the standard, ten-person team be comprised as follows:
* '''CERT Team Leader.''' Generally, the first CERT team member arriving on the scene becomes team leader, and is the designated Incident Commander (IC) until the arrival of someone more competent. This person makes the IC initial assessment of the scene and determines the appropriate course of action for team members; assumes role of Safety Officer until assigned to another team member; assigns team member roles if not already assigned; designates triage area, treatment area, morgue, and vehicle traffic routes; coordinates and directs team operations; determines logistical needs (water, food, medical supplies, transportation, equipment, and so on.) and determines ways to meet those needs through team members or citizen volunteers on the scene; collects and writes reports on the operation and victims; and communicates and coordinates with the incident commander, local authorities, and other CERT team leaders. The team leader is identified by two pieces of crossed tape on the hard hat.
* '''Safety Officer.''' Checks team members prior to deployment to ensure they are safe and equipped for the operation; determines safe or unsafe working environments; ensures team accountability; supervises operations (when possible) where team members and victims are at direct physical risk, and alerts team members when unsafe conditions arise.
* '''Fire Suppression Team (2 people).''' Work under the supervision of the Team Leader to suppress small fires in designated work areas or as needed; when not accomplishing their primary mission, assist the search and rescue team or triage team; assist in evacuation and transport as needed; assist in the triage or treatment area as needed, other duties as assigned; communicate with Team Leader.
* '''Search and Rescue Team (2).''' Work under the supervision of the Team Leader, searching for and providing rescue of victims as is prudent under the conditions; when not accomplishing their primary mission, assist the Fire Suppression Team, assist in the triage or treatment area as needed; other duties as assigned; communicate with Team Leader.
* '''Medical Triage Team (2).''' Work under the supervision of the Team Leader, providing [[simple triage and rapid treatment|START]] triage for victims found at the scene; marking victims with category of injury per the standard operating procedures; when not accomplishing their primary mission, assist the Fire Suppression Team if needed, assist the Search and Rescue Team if needed, assist in the Medical Triage Area if needed, assist in the Treatment Area if needed, other duties as assigned; communicate with Team Leader.
* '''Medical Treatment Team (2).''' Work under the supervision of the Team Leader, providing medical treatment to victims within the scope of their training. This task is normally accomplished in the Treatment Area, however, it may take place in the affected area as well. When not accomplishing their primary mission, assist the Fire Suppression Team as needed, assist the Medical Triage Team as needed; other duties as assigned; communicate with the Team Leader.

Because every CERT member in a community receives the same core instruction, any team member has the training necessary to assume any of these roles. This is important during a disaster response because not all members of a regular team may be available to respond. Hasty teams may be formed by whichever members are responding at the time. Additionally, members may need to adjust team roles due to stress, fatigue, injury, or other circumstances.

== CERT Training ==
While state and local jurisdictions will implement training in the manner that best suits the community, the Citizen Corps CERT program has an established curriculum. Jurisdictions may augment the training, but are strongly encouraged to deliver the entire core content. The Citizen Corps CERT core curriculum for the basic course is composed of the following nine units (time is instructional hours):
* '''Unit 1: Disaster Preparedness''' (2.5 hrs). Topics include (in part) identifying local disaster threats, disaster impact, mitigation and preparedness concepts, and an overview of Citizen Corps and CERT. Hands on skills include [[team-building]] exercises, and shutting off utilities.
* '''Unit 2: Fire Safety''' (2.5 hrs). Students learn about fire chemistry, mitigation practices, [[hazardous materials]] identification, suppression options, and are introduced to the concept of size-up. Hands-on skills include using a [[fire extinguisher]] to suppress a live flame, and wearing basic protective gear.
* '''Unit 3: Disaster Medical Operations part 1''' (2.5 hrs). Students learn to identify and treat certain life-threatening conditions in a disaster setting, as well as [[START triage]]. Hands-on skills include performing head-tilt/chin-lift, practicing bleeding control techniques, and performing triage as an exercise.
* '''Unit 4: Disaster Medical Operations part 2''' (2.5 hrs). Topics cover mass casualty operations, public health, assessing patients, and treating injuries. Students practice patient assessment, and various treatment techniques.
* '''Unit 5: Light Search and Rescue Operations''' (2.5 hrs). Size-up is expanded as students learn about assessing structural damage, marking structures that have been searched, search techniques, as well as rescue techniques and [[Cribbing (rescue)|cribbing]]. Hands-on activities include lifting and cribbing an object, and practicing rescue carries.
* '''Unit 6: CERT Organization''' (1.5 hrs). Students are introduced to several concepts from the Incident Command System, and local team organization and communication is explained. Hands-on skills include a table-top exercise focusing on incident command and control.
* '''Unit 7: Disaster Psychology''' (1 hr). Responder [[critical incident stress management|well-being]] and dealing with victim [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] are the topics of this unit.
* '''Unit 8: Terrorism and CERT''' (2.5 hrs). Students learn how [[terrorism|terrorists]] may choose targets, what weapons they may use, and identifying when [[CBRNE|chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive]] weapons may have been deployed. Students learn about CERT roles in preparing for and responding to terrorist attacks. A table-top exercise highlights topics covered.
* '''Unit 9: Course Review and Disaster Simulation''' (2.5 hrs). Students take a written exam, then participate in a real-time practical disaster simulation where the different skill areas are put to the test. A critique follows the exercise where students and instructors have an opportunity to learn from mistakes and highlight exemplary actions. Students may be given a certificate of completion at the conclusion of the course.

Citizen Corps CERT training emphasizes safely 'doing the most good for the most people as quickly as possible' when responding to a disaster. For this reason, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) training is not included in the core curriculum, as it is time- and responder-intensive. However, many jurisdictions encourage or require CERT members to obtain CPR training.

Each unit of Citizen Corps CERT training is ideally delivered by professional responders or other experts in the field addressed by the unit. This is done to help build unity between CERT members and responders, keep the attention of students, and help the professional response organizations be comfortable with the training which CERT members receive. 

Each course of instruction is ideally facilitated by one or more instructors certified in the CERT curriculum by the state or sponsoring agency. Facilitating instructors provide continuity between units, and help ensure that the CERT core curriculum is being delivered successfully. Facilitating instructors also perform set-up and tear-down of the classroom, provide instructional materials for the course, record student attendance and other tasks which assist the professional responder in delivering their unit as efficiently as possible.

Citizen Corps CERT training is provided free to interested members of the community, and is delivered in a group classroom setting. People may complete the training without obligation to join a CERT. Citizen Corps grant funds can be used to print and provide each student with a printed manual. Some sponsoring agencies use Citizen Corps grant funds to purchase disaster response tool kits. These kits are offered as an incentive to join a CERT, and must be returned to the sponsoring agency when members resign from CERT.

Because uniformed volunteer disaster responders are accorded a higher level of trust than unaffiliated volunteers when responding in a disaster, many sponsoring agencies require a criminal background-check of all trainees before allowing them to participate on a CERT. 

The Citizen Corps CERT curriculum (including the Train-the-Trainer course) was updated during the last half of 2008 to reflect feedback from instructors across the nation. The update is in final review, and is scheduled for release during the first quarter of 2009.

A '''catapult''' is a device used to throw or hurl a [[projectile]] a great distance without the aid of explosive devices—particularly various types of ancient and medieval [[siege engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |title= The art of the catapult : build Greek ballista, Roman onagers, English trebuchets, and more ancient artillery|last= Gurstelle|first= William|authorlink= William Gurstelle |year= 2004|publisher= Chicago Review Press|location=Chicago|isbn= 1556525265 9781556525261 9781417643233 1417643234

&lt;/ref&gt; Although the catapult has been used since ancient times, it has proven to be one of the most effective mechanisms during warfare. The word 'Catapult' comes from the two Greek words &quot;kata&quot; (downward) and &quot;pultos&quot; (a small circular battle shield).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/catapults.htm  Middle Ages: Catapults]&lt;/ref&gt; Katapultos was then taken to mean &quot;shield piercer&quot;. Catapults were invented by the [[ancient Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;Schellenberg, Hans Michael (2006), [http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/volltexte/2006/3642/pdf/Schellenberg.pdf &quot;Diodor von Sizilien 14,42,1 und die Erfindung der Artillerie im Mittelmeerraum&quot;], Frankfurter Elektronische Rundschau zur Altertumskunde 3: 14–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. W. Marsden: &quot;Greek and Roman Artillery. Historical Development&quot;, At the Clarendon Press, Oxford 1969, pp.&amp;nbsp;48–64&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greek and Roman catapults ==
[[File:Ancient Mechanical Artillery. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|200px|Ancient mechanical artillery: Catapults (standing), the chain drive of [[Polybolos]] (bottom center), [[Gastraphetes]] (on wall)]]
[[File:047 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianssäule, Tafel XLVII (Ausschnitt 02).jpg|thumb|200px|Roman 'catapult-nest' in the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]]]

The early history of the catapult and the crossbow in [[Greece]] are closely intertwined.  Primitive catapults were essentially “the product of relatively straightforward attempts to increase the range and penetrating power of missiles by strengthening the bow which propelled them”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barton C. Hacker&quot; /&gt; The historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] (fl. 1st century BC), described the invention of a mechanical arrow firing catapult (''katapeltikon'') by a Greek task force in 399 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. Sic. 14.42.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan Campbell, p.3&quot;&gt;Duncan Campbell: ''Greek and Roman Artillery 399 BC-AD 363'', Osprey Publishing, Oxford 2003, ISBN 1-84176-634-8, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The weapon was soon after employed against [[Sicilian Wars#The Second Sicilian War (410 BC–340 BC)|Motya]] (397 BC), a key [[Carthaginian]] stronghold in [[Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;Diod. Sic. 14.50.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan Campbell, p.8&quot;&gt;Duncan Campbell: ''Greek and Roman Artillery 399 BC-AD 363'', Osprey Publishing, Oxford 2003, ISBN 1-84176-634-8, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Diodorus is assumed to have drawn his description from the highly rated&lt;ref&gt;Eric William Marsden: ''Greek and Roman Artillery: Historical Development'', The Clarendon Press, Oxford 1969, ISBN 978-0-19-814268-3, p. 48f.&lt;/ref&gt; history of [[Philistus]], a contemporary of the events then. The introduction of crossbows however, can be dated further back: According to the inventor [[Hero of Alexandria]] (fl. 1st c. AD), who referred to the now lost works of the 3rd century BC engineer [[Ctesibius]], this weapon was inspired by an earlier foot-held crossbow, called the ''[[gastraphetes]]'', which could store more energy than the Greek bows.  A detailed description of the ''gastraphetes'', or the “belly-bow”,&lt;ref name=&quot;Serafina Cuomo&quot;&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3836219] , The Sinews of War: Ancient Catapults.&lt;/ref&gt; along with a watercolor drawing, is found in Heron's technical treatise ''Belopoeica''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan Campbell, p.4&quot;&gt;Duncan Campbell: ''Greek and Roman Artillery 399 BC-AD 363'', Osprey Publishing, Oxford 2003, ISBN 1-84176-634-8, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley M. Burstein, Walter Donlan, Sarah B. Pomeroy, and Jennifer Tolbert Roberts (1999). ''Ancient Greece: A Political, Social, and Cultural History''. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-509742-4, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; 

A third Greek author, Biton (fl. 2nd c. BC), whose reliability has been positively reevaluated by recent scholarship,&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan Campbell, p.3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.J.T. Lewis: ''When was Biton?'', ''[[Mnemosyne]]'', Vol. 52, No. 2 (1999), pp. 159-68&lt;/ref&gt; described two advanced forms of the ''gastraphetes'', which he credits to [[Zopyrus of Tarentum|Zopyros]], an engineer from [[Taranto|southern Italy]]. Zopyrus has been plausibly equated with a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] of that name who seems to have flourished in the late 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pythagoreanism/ Peter Kingsley: Ancient Philosophy, Mystery and Magic, Clarendon Press, Oxford 1995, p. 150ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis established a lower date of no later than the mid-fourth century (M.J.T. Lewis: ''When was Biton?'', ''[[Mnemosyne]]'', Vol. 52, No. 2 (1999), pp. 159-68 (160)).  Same de Camp (L. Sprague de Camp: ''Master Gunner Apollonios'', ''[[Technology and Culture]]'', Vol. 2, No. 3 (1961), pp. 240-4 (241)&lt;/ref&gt; He probably designed his bow-machines on the occasion of the sieges of [[Cumae]] and [[Milet]] between 421 BC and 401 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Biton Biton 65.1-67.4 &amp; 61.12-65.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan Campbell, p.5&quot;&gt;Duncan Campbell: ''Greek and Roman Artillery 399 BC-AD 363'', Osprey Publishing, Oxford 2003, ISBN 1-84176-634-8, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The bows of these machines already featured a winched pull back system and could apparently throw two missiles at once.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan Campbell, p.8&quot;/&gt;

Philo of Byzantium provides probably the most detailed account on the establishment of a theory of belopoietics (“belos” = projectile; “poietike” = (art) of making) circa 200 BC. The central principle to this theory was that “all parts of a catapult, including the weight or length of the projectile, were proportional to the size of the torsion springs”.  This kind of innovation is indicative of the increasing rate at which geometry and physics were being assimilated into military enterprises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serafina Cuomo&quot;/&gt; 

From the mid-fourth century BC onwards, evidence of the Greek use of arrow-shooting machines becomes more dense and varied: Arrow firing machines (''katapaltai'') are briefly mentioned by [[Aeneas Tacticus]] in his treatise on siegecraft written around 350 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan Campbell, p.8&quot;/&gt; An extant inscription from the [[Athens|Athenian]] arsenal, dated between 338 and 326 BC, lists a number of stored catapults with shooting bolts of varying size and springs of sinews.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eric William Marsden, p.57&quot;&gt;Eric William Marsden: ''Greek and Roman Artillery: Historical Development'', The Clarendon Press, Oxford 1969, ISBN 978-0-19-814268-3, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; The later entry is particularly noteworthy as it constitutes the first clear evidence for the switch to [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] catapults which are more powerful than the flexible crossbows and came to dominate Greek and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] artillery design thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan Campbell, p.8&quot;&gt;Duncan Campbell: ''Greek and Roman Artillery 399 BC-AD 363'', Osprey Publishing, Oxford 2003, ISBN 1-84176-634-8, p.8ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This move to torsion springs was likely spurred by the engineers of Philip II of Macedonia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serafina Cuomo&quot;/&gt; Another Athenian inventory from 330-329 BC includes catapults bolts with heads and flights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eric William Marsden, p.57&quot;/&gt; As the use of catapults became more commonplace, so did the training required to operate them. Many Greek children were instructed in catapult usage, as evidenced by “a 3rd Century B.C. inscription from the island of Ceos in the Cyclades [regulating] catapult shooting competitions for the young”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serafina Cuomo&quot;/&gt; Arrow firing machines in action are reported from [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]'s siege of [[Perinth]] ([[Thrace]]) in 340 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eric William Marsden, p.60&quot;&gt;Eric William Marsden: ''Greek and Roman Artillery: Historical Development'', The Clarendon Press, Oxford 1969, ISBN 978-0-19-814268-3, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Greek fortifications began to feature high towers with shuttered windows in the top, which could have been used to house anti-personnel arrow shooters, as in [[Aigosthena]].&lt;ref&gt;Josiah Ober: ''Early Artillery Towers: Messenia, Boiotia, Attica, Megarid'', ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 91, No. 4. (1987), S. 569-604 (569)&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman times machine known as an [[arcuballista]] was probably similar to the crossbow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dagr.univ-tlse2.fr/sdx/dagr/feuilleter.xsp?tome=1&amp;partie=1&amp;numPage=400&amp;filtre=arbal%C3%A8te%20&amp;nomEntree=ARCUBALLISTA Dictionnaire des antiquites grecques et romaines]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander the Great]] introduced the idea of using them to provide cover on the battlefield in addition to using them during sieges. Projectiles included both arrows and (later) stones that were sometimes lit on fire

The Romans started to use catapults as arms for their wars against [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], Macedon, Sparta and Aetolia (3rd–2nd century BC). Later the Romans used [[ballista]] catapults on their warships.

== Medieval catapults ==
[[File:Replica catapult.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Replica of a catapult]]

[[Castle]]s and fortified [[walled cities]] were common during this period - and catapults were used as a key [[siege weapon]] against them.  As well as attempting to breach the walls, [[Early thermal weapons|incendiary missiles]] could be thrown inside&amp;mdash;or early [[biological warfare]] attempted with diseased carcasses or putrid garbage catapulted over the [[walls]]. 

Defensive techniques in the Middle Ages progressed to a point that rendered catapults ineffective for the most part. The Viking siege of Paris (885–6 A.D.) “saw the employment by both sides of virtually every instrument of siege craft known to the classical world, including a variety of catapults,” to little effect, resulting in failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barton C. Hacker&quot;&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3102042  Greek Catapults and Catapult Technology]: Science, Technology, and War in Ancient World&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely used catapults throughout the Middle Ages were as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;Middle Ages&quot;&gt;[http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/catapults.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Ballista]] : Ballistas were similar to giant crossbows and were designed to work through torsion. The ammunition used were basically giant arrows or darts made from wood with an iron tip. These arrows were then shot “along a flat trajectory” at a target. Ballistas are notable for their high degree of accuracy, but also their lack of firepower compared to that of a Mangonel or Trebuchet. Because of their immobility, most Ballistas were constructed on site following a siege assessment by the commanding military officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Middle Ages&quot;/&gt;

; [[Springald]] : The springald's design is similar to that of the Ballista's, in that it was effectively a crossbow propelled by tension. The Springald's frame was more compact, allowing for use inside tighter confines, such as the inside of a castle or tower. This compromised the firepower though, making it an anti-personnel weapon at best.&lt;ref name=&quot;Middle Ages&quot;/&gt;

; [[Mangonel]] : These machines were designed to throw heavy projectiles from a “bowl-shaped bucket at the end of its arm”. Mangonels were mostly used for “firing various missiles at fortresses, castles, and cities,” with a range of up to 1300 feet. These missiles included anything from stones to excrement to rotting carcasses. Mangonels were relatively simple to construct, and eventually wheels were added to increase mobility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Middle Ages&quot;/&gt;

; [[Onager (siege weapon)|Onager]] : Mangonels are also sometimes referred to as Onagers.  Onager catapults initially launched projectiles from a sling, which was later changed to a “bowl-shaped bucket”.  The word 'Onager' is derived from the Greek word 'onagros' for wild ass, referring to the “kicking motion and force”&lt;ref name=&quot;Middle Ages&quot;/&gt; that were recreated in the Mangonel's design. In terms of historical records, there's not much to go on. The most detailed account of Mangonel use is from “Eric Marsden's translation of a text written by Ammianus Marcellius in the 4th Century AD” describing its construction and combat usage.&lt;ref name=&quot;catapults.info&quot;&gt;[http://www.catapults.info/  Catapults info].&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Trebuchet]] : Trebuchets were probably the most powerful catapult employed in the Middle Ages. The most commonly used ammunition were stones, but “darts and sharp wooden poles” could be substituted if necessary. The most effective kind of ammunition though involved fire, such as “firebrands, and deadly [[Greek Fire]]”. Trebuchets came in two different designs: Traction, which were powered by people, or Counterpoise, where the people were replaced with “a weight on the short end”.&lt;ref name= &quot;Middle Ages&quot;/&gt;  The most famous historical account of trebuchet use dates back to the siege of Stirling Castle in 1304, when the army of Edward I constructed a giant trebuchet known as “Warwolf”, which then proceeded to “level a section of [castle] wall, successfully concluding the siege.”&lt;ref name=&quot;catapults.info&quot;/&gt;

; [[Couillard]] : A simplified trebuchet, where the trebuchet's single counterweight is split, swinging on either side of a central support post.

; [[Leonardo da Vinci's catapult]] : [[Leonardo da Vinci]] sought to improve the efficiency and range of earlier designs. His design incorporated used a large wooden [[leaf spring]] as an [[accumulator]] to power the catapult.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Both ends of the bow are connected by a rope, similar to the design of a [[bow and arrow]]. The leaf spring was not used to pull the catapult armature directly, rather the rope was wound around a drum. The catapult armature was attached to this drum which would be turned until enough potential energy was stored in the deformation of the spring. The drum would then be disengaged from the winding mechanism, and the catapult arm would snap around.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Though no records exist of this design being built during Leonardo's lifetime, contemporary enthusiasts have reconstructed it.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Modern Use ==
[[File:French grenade catapult.jpg|left|thumb|200px|French troops using a catapult to throw [[hand grenade]]s and other explosives during [[World War I]]]]

The last large scale military use of catapults was during the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]]. During the early stages of the war, catapults were used to throw [[hand grenade]]s across [[no man's land]] into enemy trenches. (These were eventually replaced by small [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]]).

Special variants called [[aircraft catapult]]s are used to launch planes from land bases and sea carriers when the takeoff runway is too short for a powered takeoff or simply impractical to extend. Ships also use them to launch torpedoes and deploy bombs against submarines.
Small catapults, referred to as ''traps'' are still widely used to launch [[Clay target]]s into the air in the sport of [[Clay pigeon shooting]].

Until recently, catapults were used by thrill-seekers to experience being catapulted through the air. The practice has been discontinued due to fatalities, when the participants failed to land onto the safety net.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

[[Pumpkin Chunking]] is another widely popularized use, in which people compete to see who can launch a pumpkin the farthest by mechanical means (although the world record is held by a pneumatic air cannon).

In January 2011, popsci.com , the news blog version of [[Popular Science]] magazine reported a group of smugglers used a homemade catapult to deliver [[marijuana]] into the [[United States of America]] from [[Mexico]].  The machine was found 20 feet from the border fence with {{convert|4.4|lb}} bales of marijuana ready to launch.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2011-01/mexican-authorities-seize-homemade-marijuana-hurling-catapult-border&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models ==
[[Image:Greek and Roman Ballista Catapult.jpg|thumb|A commercial model of a Greek and Roman Ballista]] 

Catapults of all types and sizes are being built for school science and history fairs, competitions or as a hobby. Catapult projects can inspire students to study different subjects including physics, engineering, science, math and history. These kits can be purchased from [[Renaissance fair|Renaissance Fair]]s, or from several online stores, and the three types of catapults are ballista, trebuchet, and Mangonel.

In her 1915 collection titled ''Verse'', published one year after her death, Crapsey included 28 cinquains.&lt;ref&gt;Toleos, Aaron.  [http://www.cinquain.org/verse.html ''Verse'' and its legacy.]  [http://www.cinquain.org/ Cinquain.org.]  Retrieved 2010-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crapsey's cinquains utilized an increasing [[Meter (poetry)|syllable count]] in the first four lines, namely two in the first, four in the second, six in the third, and eight in the fourth, before returning to two syllables on the last line.  In addition, though little emphasized by critics, each line in the majority of Crapsey cinquains has a fixed number of [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed syllables]], as well, following the pattern one, two, three, four, one.  The most common [[Foot (prosody)|metrical foot]] in her twenty-eight published examples is the [[iamb]], though this is not exclusive.  Lines generally do not rhyme.  In contrast to the Eastern forms upon which she based them, Crapsey always titled her cinquains, effectively utilizing the title as a sixth line.

The form is illustrated by Crapsey's &quot;November Night&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;Crapsey, Adelaide (1922).  ''Verse'', p. 31.  Quoted in [http://www.cinquain.org/cinquain.html 28 cinquains from Adelaide Crapsey's ''Verse''], at [http://www.cinquain.org/ Cinquain.org.]  Retrieved 2010-06-09.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Listen... &lt;br&gt;
With faint dry sound, &lt;br&gt;
Like steps of passing ghosts, &lt;br&gt;
The leaves, frost-crisp'd, break from the trees &lt;br&gt;
And fall.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Crapsey cinquain has subsequently seen a number of variations by modern poets, including:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

==Didactic cinquain==
The [[didactic cinquain]] is also closely related to the Crapsey cinquain.  It is an informal cinquain widely taught in elementary schools and has been featured in, and popularized by, children's media resources, including [[Junie B. Jones]] and [[PBS Kids]]. This form is also embraced by young adults and older poets for its expressive simplicity.  The prescriptions of this type of cinquain refer to word count, not syllables and stresses.  Ordinarily, the first line is a one-word title, the subject of the poem; the second line is a pair of adjectives describing that title; the third line is a three word phrase that gives more information about the subject; the fourth line consists of four words describing feelings related to that subject; and the fifth line is a single word synonym or other reference for the subject from line one.

The '''Cook Islands''' {{IPA-en|ˈkʊk ˈaɪləndz||en-us-Cook Islands.ogg}} ([[Cook Islands Maori|Cook Islands Māori]]: ''Kūki 'Āirani'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cook+islands+dictionary&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ivHYTZGWKo-gsQOLg_SNDA&amp;sa#v=onepage&amp;q=Kuki%20Airani&amp;f=false ''Cook Islands Maori dictionary''] by Jasper Buse &amp; Raututi Taringa, Cook Islands Ministry of Education (1995) page 200&lt;/ref&gt; is a self-governing parliamentary democracy in [[Associated state|free association]] with [[New Zealand]]. The 15 small islands in this [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific Ocean]] country have a total land area of {{convert|240|km2|sqmi|1|lk=out}}, but the Cook Islands [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ) covers {{convert|1800000|km2|sqmi|lk=out}} of ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sopac.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Cook+Islands A View from the Cook Islands] SOPAC&lt;/ref&gt;

The main population centres are on the island of [[Rarotonga]] (14,153 as of 2006), where there is an international airport. There is also a much larger population of Cook Islanders in New Zealand, particularly the [[North Island]]. In the 2006 census, 58,008 self-identified as being of ethnic [[Cook Island Māori]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/census/2006-census-data/quickstats-about-culture-identity/quickstats-about-culture-and-identity.htm?page=para016Master |title=QuickStats About Culture and Identity - Pacific Peoples |accessdate=2007-06-12  |work=2006 Census |publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070829173025/http://www.stats.govt.nz/census/2006-census-data/quickstats-about-culture-identity/quickstats-about-culture-and-identity.htm?page=para016Master &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With over 90,000 visitors travelling to the islands in 2006, [[tourism]] is the country's main industry, and the leading element of the [[economy of the Cook Islands|economy]], far ahead of offshore banking, pearls, marine and fruit exports.

Defence and foreign affairs are the responsibility of [[New Zealand]], in consultation with the Cook Islands. In recent times, the Cook Islands have adopted an increasingly independent foreign policy. Although [[Cook Islanders]] are citizens of New Zealand, they have the status of Cook Islands nationals, which is not given to all New Zealand citizens.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of the Cook Islands}}
[[Image:Wyspy Cooka.png|thumb|250px|Map of the Cook Islands.]]
The Cook Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean, north-east of New Zealand, between [[French Polynesia]] and [[American Samoa]]. There are 15 major islands, spread over 2.2 million km² of ocean, divided into two distinct groups: the Southern Cook Islands, and the Northern Cook Islands of [[Atoll|coral atolls]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cook Islands Travel Guide&quot; (with description), ''World Travel Guide'', Nexus Media Communications, 2006. Webpage: [http://www.worldtravelguide.net/country/65/country_guide/Australia-and-South-Pacific/Cook-Islands.html WTGuide-Cook-Islands].&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands were formed by volcanic activity; the northern group is older and consists of six [[atoll]]s (sunken volcanoes topped by [[coral]] growth). The climate is moderate to tropical.

The 15 islands and two reefs are grouped as follows:
*'''Southern Cook Islands:'''
**[[Nga-pu-Toru]] (&quot;Three Roots&quot;, the group name for the easternmost islands of Southern Group):
***[[Atiu]] (Enua Manu or Island of Birds)
***[[Ma'uke]] (Akatokamanava)
***[[Mitiaro]] (Nukuroa)
***[[Takutea]]
**Remaining islands of the South:
***[[Aitutaki]] (Araura Enua)
***[[Mangaia]] (Auau Enua)
***[[Rarotonga]] (Tumutevarovaro) and also with the capital, Avarua.
***[[Palmerston Island]] (Pamati) sometimes grouped with the Northern Group.
***[[Manuae (Cook Islands)|Manuae]]
***[[Winslow Reef, Cook Islands|Winslow Reef]] (submerged)
*'''Northern Cook Islands:'''
**[[Manihiki]] (Te Fuinga o Niva)
**[[Nassau (Cook Islands)|Nassau]] (Te Nuku o Ngalewu )
**[[Penrhyn Island]] (Tongareva or Mangarongaro)
**[[Pukapuka]] (Te Ulu o te Watu)
**[[Rakahanga]] (Tapuahua)
**[[Suwarrow]] also called Suvorov
**[[Tema Reef]] (submerged)

==History==
{{Main|History of the Cook Islands}}

[[Image:rarotonga beach.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Beach on [[Rarotonga]].]]
The Cook Islands were first settled in the 6th century [[Common Era|CE]] by [[Polynesian people]] who migrated from nearby [[Tahiti]], to the southeast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samoa2007.ws/index.php?id=224 Cook Islands] Samoa2007.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spain|Spanish]] ships visited the islands in the 16th century; the first written record of contact with the Islands came with the sighting of [[Pukapuka]] by Spanish sailor [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira]] in 1595 who called it ''San Bernardo'' (Saint Bernard). Portuguese-Spaniard [[Pedro Fernández de Quirós]], made the first recorded European landing in the islands when he set foot on [[Rakahanga]] in 1606, calling it ''Gente Hermosa'' (Beautiful People).&lt;ref&gt;[http://findingnz.co.nz/av/gav2_cook_isl.htm European discovery of the Cook Islands by Brian Hooker]&lt;/ref&gt;

British navigator Captain [[James Cook]] arrived in 1773 and 1777&lt;ref&gt;''Cook : the extraordinary voyages of Captain James Cook'', 2003, by Nicholas Thomas, page 310-311.&lt;/ref&gt; and named the islands the ''Hervey Islands''; the name &quot;Cook Islands&quot;, in honour of Cook, appeared on a Russian naval chart published in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cook-islands.gov.ck/history.php Cook Islands Government website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1813, [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]], a missionary on the ''Endeavour'' (not the same ship as that of Cook), made the first official sighting of the [[Rarotonga|island of Rarotonga]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chr.org.au/fpbooks/tendecades/TEN%20DECADES%20Chapter%203.doc TEN DECADES: The Australasian Centenary History of the London Missionary Society, Rev. Joseph King (Word document)]&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded landing on Rarotonga by Europeans was in 1814 by the Cumberland; trouble broke out between the sailors and the Islanders and many were killed on both sides.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;[http://www.ck/history.htm History of the Cook Islands]&lt;/ref&gt; The islands saw no more Europeans until missionaries arrived from England in 1821. Christianity quickly took hold in the culture and many islanders continue to be Christian believers today.

The Cook Islands became a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[protectorate]] in 1888, due largely to community fears that France might occupy the territory as it had Tahiti. In 1901, the New Zealand Government decided to annex the country despite opposition from the country's traditional chiefs. As many of the islands were independent and ruled by local chiefs, the Cook Islands had no federal statutory law to decide the constitutional constraints regarding whether to agree to the country's annexation by the New Zealand Government. Nonetheless, the country remained a New Zealand protectorate until 1965, when the New Zealand Government decided to offer self governing status to its former colony. In that year, [[Albert Henry]] of the [[Cook Islands Party]] was elected as the first [[Prime Minister]]. Sir Albert Henry led the country until he was accused of vote-rigging. He was succeeded in 1978 by [[Tom Davis (Cook Islands)|Tom Davis]] of the [[Democratic Party (Cook Islands)|Democratic Party]].

Today, the Cook Islands are essentially independent (&quot;self-governing in free association with New Zealand&quot;) but New Zealand is tasked with overseeing the country's defence.

On 11 June 1980, the [[United States]] signed [[Cook Islands – United States Maritime Boundary Treaty|a treaty]] with the Cook Islands specifying the [[maritime boundary|maritime border]] between the Cook Islands and [[American Samoa]] and also relinquishing its claim to the islands of [[Penrhyn Island|Penrhyn]], [[Pukapuka]], [[Manihiki]], and [[Rakahanga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/pits/en/treaty_database/1980/6.html|title=Treaty Between the United States of America and the Cook Islands on Friendship and Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary Between the United States of America and the Cook Islands (and Exchange of Notes)|work=Pacific Islands Treaty Series|publisher=University of the South Pacific School of Law|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the Cook Islands signed [[Maritime Delimitation Agreement (Cook Islands – France)|a treaty]] with [[France]] which [[boundary delimitation|delimited]] the boundary between the Cook Islands and [[French Polynesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/pits/en/treaty_database/1990/4.html|title=Agreement on Maritime Delimitation Between the Government of the Cook Islands and the Government of the French Republic|work=Pacific Islands Treaty Series|publisher=University of the South Pacific School of Law|accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of the Cook Islands}}

[[Image:Parliament of the Cook Islands - 2006.JPG|right|250px|thumb|The parliament building of the Cook Islands, formerly a hotel.]]
The politics of the Cook Islands takes place in a framework of a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[associated state]], whereby the [[Monarchy in New Zealand|Queen of New Zealand]], represented in the Cook Islands by the [[Queen's Representative]], is [[Head of State]] and the Chief Minister is the [[head of government]]. There is a pluriform multi-party system and the islands are self-governing in [[Associated state|free association]] with [[New Zealand]] and fully responsible for both internal and external affairs.

New Zealand retains some responsibility for external affairs, in consultation with the Cook Islands. As of 2005, it has diplomatic relations in its own name with 18 other countries.&amp;nbsp;[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government.&amp;nbsp;[[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[Parliament of the Cook Islands]].

The Cook Islands is not a [[United Nations]] full member but participates in [[WHO]] and [[UNESCO]], and is an associate member of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ([[UNESCAP]]).

The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

==Administrative subdivisions==
There are island councils on all of the inhabited outer islands (Outer Islands Local Government Act 1987, with amendments up to 2004 and Palmerston Island Local Government Act 1993) except [[Nassau (Cook Islands)|Nassau]], which is governed by [[Pukapuka]] ([[Suwarrow]], with only one caretaker living on the island, also governed by Pukapuka, is not counted with the inhabited islands in this context). Each council is headed by a [[mayor]].

&lt;center&gt;
;The ten Outer Islands councils are:

The three ''vaka'' councils of main island [[Rarotonga]] established in 1997 (''Rarotonga Local Government Act 1997''), that were also headed by mayors,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transparency.org.au/documents/cookislands.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; were abolished in February 2008, despite much controversy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cook-islands.gov.ck/view_release.php?release_id=990 RAROTONGA LOCAL GOVERNMENT (REPEAL) BILL TO BE TABLED, Cook Islands Government] and [http://www.ciherald.co.ck/articles/h392b.htm HERALD WEEKLY ISSUE 393 :09 February 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

;The three ''Vaka'' councils on the main island [[Rarotonga]] were:

| (equivalent to [[Avarua]], the national capital of the Cook Islands)
|-
| [[Puaikura]]
|Arorangi
|-
| [[Takitumu]]
|Ngatangiia
|}

On the lowest level, there are village committees. [[Nassau (Cook Islands)|Nassau]], which is governed by [[Pukapuka]], has an island committee (Nassau Island Committee), which advises the Pukapuka Island Council on matters concerning its own island.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Cook Islands}}
The Economy of the Cook Islands is strongly affected by the Cook Islands geography. It is isolated from foreign markets, and has inadequate infrastructure. Furthermore, it lacks major natural resources and suffers greatly from natural disasters. Agriculture provides the economic base and manufacturing is limited.
The economy is supported by foreign aid, largely from New Zealand. The Peoples Republic of China has also contributed foreign aid which has resulted, among other projects, in the Police Headquarters building. The Cook Islands is expanding its tourism, banking, mining and fishing sectors, with varying success.

==Culture==
[[Image:Rarotonga-8-Maeva-Nui.jpg|thumb|300px|Float parade during the annual Maeva Nui celebrations.]]

===Language===
The languages of the Cook Islands include [[English language|English]], [[Cook Islands Māori]], or &quot;Rarotongan,&quot; and [[Pukapukan language|Pukapukan]]. Dialects of Cook Islands Maori include [[Penrhyn language|Penrhyn]]; [[Rakahanga-Manihiki language|Rakahanga-Manihiki]]; the Ngaputoru dialect of [[Atiu]], [[Mitiaro]], and [[Mauke]]; the [[Aitutaki]] dialect; and the [[Mangaia]]n dialect. Cook Islands Maori and its dialectic variants are closely related to both [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] and to [[New Zealand]] [[Māori language|Māori]]. [[Pukapukan]], by contrast, is considered closely related to the [[Samoan language]]. English and Cook Islands Maori are considered [[official language]]s of the Cook Islands.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of the Cook Islands}}
Music in the Cook Islands is varied, with Christian songs being quite popular, but traditional dancing and songs in Polynesian languages remain popular.

===Art===
====Carving====
[[Woodcarving]] is a common art form in the Cook Islands. Sculpture in stone is much rarer although there are some excellent carvings in basalt by Mike Tavioni. The proximity of islands in the southern group helped produce a homogeneous style of carving but which had special developments in each island. Rarotonga is known for its fisherman's gods and staff-gods, [[Atiu]] for its wooden seats, [[Mitiaro]], [[Ma'uke]] and [[Atiu]] for mace and slab gods and [[Mangaia]] for its ceremonial adzes. Most of the original wood carvings were either spirited away by early European collectors or were burned in large numbers by missionary zealots. Today, carving is no longer the major art form with the same spiritual and cultural emphasis given to it by the Maori in New Zealand. However, there are continual efforts to interest young people in their heritage and some good work is being turned out under the guidance of older carvers. Atiu, in particular, has a strong tradition of crafts both in carving and local fibre arts such as tapa. Mangaia is the source of many fine adzes carved in a distinctive, idiosyncratic style with the so-called double-k design. Mangaia also produces food pounders carved from the heavy calcite found in its extensive limestone caves.

====Weaving====
The outer islands produce traditional [[weaving]] of mats, basketware and hats. Particularly fine examples of rito hats are worn by women to church. They are made from the uncurled immature fibre of the coconut palm and are of very high quality. The Polynesian equivalent of Panama hats, they are highly valued and are keenly sought by Polynesian visitors from Tahiti. Often, they are decorated with hatbands made of minuscule pupu shells which are painted and stitched on by hand. Although pupu are found on other islands the collection and use of them in decorative work has become a speciality of Mangaia. The weaving of rito is a speciality of the northern island of Penrhyn.

====Tivaevae====
A major art form in the Cook Islands is [[tivaevae]]. This is, in essence, the art of handmade Island scenery patchwork quilts. Introduced by the wives of missionaries in the 19th century, the craft grew into a communal activity and is probably one of the main reasons for its popularity.

====Contemporary Art====
The Cook Islands has produced internationally recognised contemporary artists, especially in the main island of Rarotonga. Artists include painter (and photographer) Mahiriki Tangaroa, sculptors Eruera (Ted) Nia (originally a film maker) and master carver Mike Tavioni, painter (and Polynesian tattoo enthusiast) Upoko’ina Ian George, Aitutakian-born painter Tim Manavaroa Buchanan, Loretta Reynolds, Judith Kunzlé, Joan Rolls Gragg, Kay George (who is also known for her fabric designs), Apii Rongo, and multi-media, installation and community-project artist Ani O'Neil, all of whom currently live on the main island of Rarotonga. Atiuan-based Andrea Eimke is an artist who works in the medium of tapa and other textiles, and also co-authored the book 'Tivaivai - The Social Fabric of the Cook Islands' with British academic Susanne Kuechler. Many of these artists have studied at university art schools in New Zealand and continue to enjoy close links with the New Zealand art scene.

New Zealand-based Cook Islander artists include Michel Tuffrey, print-maker David Teata, Richard Shortland Cooper, Sylvia Marsters, and Jim Vivieaere.

On Rarotonga, the main commercial galleries are Beachcomber Contemporary Art (Taputapuatea, Avarua) run by Ben Bergman, and The Art Gallery ('Arorangi). The Cook Islands National Museum also exhibits art.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Patepou.jpg|thumb|Pa te Pou Ariki, Chief of the Takitumu tribe, [[Rarotonga]] (c. 1837)]]

The '''[[Cook Islands]]''' are named after [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]], who visited the islands in 1773 and 1777.&lt;ref&gt;''Cook : the Extraordinary voyages of Captain James Cook'', 2003, by Nicholas Thomas, pages 310-311.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cook Islands]] became a British [[protectorate]] in 1888.

By 1900, administrative control was transferred to [[New Zealand]]; in 1965 residents chose self-government in free association with New Zealand.

The Cook Islands contain 15 islands in the group spread over a vast area in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. The majority of islands are low coral atolls in the Northern Group, with [[Rarotonga]], a volcanic island in the Southern Group, as the main administration and government centre. The main Cook Islands language is [[Cook Islands Maori|Rarotongan Māori]]. There are some variations in dialect in the 'outer' islands.

==History==
The Cook Islands were first settled around 600 [[Anno Domini|AD]] by [[Polynesian people]] who migrated from nearby [[Tahiti]], to the southeast. Over-population on many of the tiny islands of Polynesia led to these oceanic migrations. Tradition has it that this was the reason for the expedition of Ru, from Tupua'i in French Polynesia, who landed on [[Aitutaki]] and Tangiia, also from French Polynesia, who are believed to have arrived on [[Rarotonga]] around 800 AD. Some evidence for this is that the old road of Toi, the ''Ara Metua'', which runs round most of Rarotonga, is believed to be at least 1200 years old. This 29 km long, paved road is a considerable achievement of ancient engineering, unsurpassed elsewhere in Polynesia.&lt;ref name=wondermondo&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/Au/NZ/Cook/AraMetua.htm|title=Ara Metua - ancient Polynesian road|publisher=Wondermondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the northern islands were probably settled by expeditions from [[Samoa]] and [[Tonga]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ck/history.htm History of the Cook Islands www.ck]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spain|Spanish]] ships visited the islands in the 16th century; the first written record of contact with the Islands came with the sighting of [[Pukapuka]] by Spanish sailor [[Álvaro de Mendaña]] in 1595 who called it ''San Bernardo'' (Saint Bernard). Portuguese-Spaniard [[Pedro Fernández de Quirós]], made the first recorded European landing in the islands when he set foot on [[Rakahanga]] in 1606, calling it ''Gente Hermosa'' (Beautiful People).&lt;ref name=&quot;findingnz.co.nz&quot;&gt;[http://findingnz.co.nz/av/gav2_cook_isl.htm European discovery of the Cook Islands by Brian Hooker]&lt;/ref&gt;

British navigator Captain [[James Cook]] arrived in 1773 and 1777; Cook named the islands the 'Hervey Islands' to honour a British Lord of the Admiralty; Half a century later the [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] Admiral [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]] published the ''Atlas de l'Ocean Pacifique'', in which he renamed the islands the Cook Islands to honour Cook. [[Captain Cook]] navigated and mapped much of the group. Surprisingly, Cook never sighted the largest island, [[Rarotonga]], and the only island that he personally set foot on was tiny, uninhabited [[Palmerston Island|Palmerston Atoll]].&lt;ref&gt;Lonely Planet Guidebook : Rarotonga &amp; the Cook Islands, by Errol Hunt &amp; Nancy J. Keller p10-11 ISBN 1-74059-083-X&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1813, [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]], a missionary on the Endeavour (not the same ship as Cook's), made the first official sighting of the island [[Rarotonga]]. [http://www.chr.org.au/fpbooks/tendecades/TEN%20DECADES%20Chapter%203.doc] The first recorded landing by Europeans was in 1814 by the Cumberland; trouble broke out between the sailors and the Islanders and many were killed on both sides.

The islands saw no more Europeans until missionaries arrived from England in 1821. Christianity quickly took hold in the culture and retains that grip today.

Brutal [[Peruvian]] [[slave traders]], known as [[blackbirding|blackbirders]], took a terrible toll on the islands of the Northern Group in 1862 and 1863. At first the traders may have genuinely operated as labour recruiters, but they quickly turned to subterfuge and outright kidnapping to round up their human cargo. The [[Cook Islands]] was not the only island group visited by the traders, but [[Penrhyn Island|Penrhyn Atoll]] was their first port of call and it has been estimated that three-quarters of the population was taken to [[Callao]], [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;Discoverers Of The Cook Islands And The Names They Gave, by Alphons M.J. Kloosterman Chap 10. Penrhyn&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rakahanga]] and [[Pukapuka]] also suffered tremendous losses.&lt;ref&gt;Lonely Planet Guidebook : Rarotonga &amp; the Cook Islands, by Errol Hunt &amp; Nancy J. Keller p11-12 ISBN 1-74059-083-X&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kingdom of Rarotonga]] was established in 1858 and in 1888 it became a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[protectorate]] by the request of [[Queen Makea Takau]], mainly to thwart French expansionism. Then later were transferred to [[New Zealand]] in 1901. They remained a New Zealand protectorate until 1965, at which point they became a [[self-government|self-governing]] territory in [[free association]] with New Zealand. The first Prime Minister Sir [[Albert Henry]] led the county until 1978 when he was accused of [[vote-rigging]].

Today, the Cook Islands are essentially independent (self-governing in free association with New Zealand), but are still officially placed under New Zealand [[sovereignty]]. New Zealand is tasked with overseeing the country's foreign relations and defence. The Cook Islands are one of four New Zealand [[Dependent territory|dependencies]], along with [[Tokelau]], [[Niue]] and the [[Ross Dependency]].

After achieving autonomy in 1965, the Cook Islands elected [[Albert Henry]] of the [[Cook Islands Party]] as their first [[Prime Minister]]. He was succeeded in 1978 by [[Tom Davis (Cook Islands)|Tom Davis]] of the [[Democratic Party (Cook Islands)|Democratic Party]].

On 11 June 1980, the [[United States]] signed [[Cook Islands – United States Maritime Boundary Treaty|a treaty]] with the Cook Islands specifying the maritime [[border]] between the Cook Islands and [[American Samoa]] and also relinquishing its claim to the islands of [[Penrhyn Island|Penrhyn]], [[Pukapuka]], [[Manihiki]], and [[Rakahanga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/pits/en/treaty_database/1980/6.html|title=Treaty Between the United States of America and the Cook Islands on Friendship and Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary Between the United States of America and the Cook Islands (and Exchange of Notes)|work=Pacific Islands Treaty Series|publisher=University of the South Pacific School of Law|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the Cook Islands signed [[Cook Islands – France Maritime Delimitation Agreement|a treaty]] with [[France]] which [[boundary delimitation|delimited]] the [[maritime boundary]] between the Cook Islands and [[French Polynesia]]. 

On June 13, 2008, a small majority of members of the [[House of Ariki]] attempted a coup, claiming to dissolve the elected government and to take control of the country's leadership. &quot;Basically we are dissolving the leadership, the prime minister and the deputy prime minister and the ministers,&quot; chief Makea Vakatini Joseph Ariki explained. The ''Cook Islands Herald'' suggested that the ''[[ariki]]'' were attempting thereby to regain some of their traditional prestige or ''[[mana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/536641/1845025 &quot;Cooks heading for internal strife&quot;], TVNZ, June 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/4583560a12.html &quot;NZ Maori stirs Cooks sovereignty stoush&quot;], Stuff.co.nz, June 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Jim Marurai]] described the take-over move as &quot;ill-founded and nonsensical&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/4587067a12.html &quot;NZ Maori behind strange Cook's 'coup'&quot;], Stuff.co.nz, June 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; By June 23, the situation appeared to have normalised, with members of the House of Ariki accepting to return to their regular duties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=40504 &quot;Cook Islands chiefs drop take over claim, return to normal duties&quot;], Radio New Zealand International, June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The emigration of skilled workers to New Zealand and government deficits are continuing problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of the Cook Islands}}
The '''politics of the Cook Islands''', an [[associated state]], takes place in a framework of a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]] within a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The [[Monarchy in New Zealand|Queen of New Zealand]], represented in the Cook Islands by the [[Queen's Representative]], is the [[Head of State]]; the Chief Minister is the [[head of government]] and of a  [[multi-party system]]. The Islands are self-governing in free association with [[New Zealand]] and are fully responsible for internal affairs. New Zealand retains some responsibility for external affairs, in consultation with the Cook Islands. In recent years, the Cook Islands has taken on more of its own external affairs; as of 2005, it has diplomatic relations in its own name with eighteen other countries. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government, while [[legislative power]] is vested in both the government and [[Parliament of the Cook Islands|the islands' parliament]].  The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislatures. 

==Constitution==
The [[Constitution of the Cook Islands]] took effect on August 4, 1965, when the Cook Islands became a [[Self-government|self-governing]] territory in [[Associated state|free association]] with [[New Zealand]]. The anniversary of these events in 1965 is commemorated annually on [[Constitution Day]], with week long activities known as ''Te Maevea Nui Celebrations'' locally.

== Executive ==
{{office-table}}
| Queen || [[Elizabeth II of New Zealand|Elizabeth II]] || || 6 February 1952&lt;/tr&gt;
| Queen's Representative || [[Order of the British Empire|Sir]] [[Frederick Tutu Goodwin|Frederick Goodwin]] [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] || || 9 February 2001&lt;/tr&gt;
| [[Prime Minister of the Cook Islands|Prime Minister]] || [[Henry Puna]] || [[Cook Islands Party|CIP]] || 30 November 2010&lt;/tr&gt;
|}
The monarch is hereditary; her representative is appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the Cook Islands Government. The cabinet is chosen by the prime minister and collectively responsible to Parliament.

Ten years of rule by the Cook Islands Party (CIP) came to an end 18 November 1999 with the resignation of Prime Minister Joe Williams. Williams had led a minority government since October 1999 when the New Alliance Party (NAP) left the government coalition and joined the main opposition [[Democratic Alliance Party (Cook Islands)|Democratic Party]] (DAP). On 18 November 1999, DAP leader Dr. Terepai Maoate was sworn in as prime minister. He was succeeded by his co-partisan [[Robert Woonton]]. When Dr Woonton lost his seat in the 2004 elections, [[Jim Marurai]] took over. In the 2010 elections, the CIP regained power and [[Henry Puna]] was sworn in as prime minister on 30 November 2010.

Following uncertainty about the ability of the government to maintain its majority, the Queen's representative dissolved parliament mid-way through its term and a 'snap' election was held on 26 September 2006. Jim Marurai's Democratic Party retained the Treasury benches with an increased majority.

The New Zealand High Commissioner is appointed by the New Zealand Government.

== Legislature ==
[[Image:Parliament of the Cook Islands - 2006.JPG|right|250px|thumb|The parliament building of the Cook Islands, formerly a hotel.]]
The [[Parliament of the Cook Islands]] has 24 members, elected for a five year term in single-seat constituencies. There is also a [[House of Ariki]], composed of [[ali'i|chiefs]], which has a purely advisory role. The [[Koutu Nui]] is a similar organization consisting of sub-chiefs. It was established by an amendment in 1972 of the 1966 House of Ariki Act. The current President is [[Te Tika Mataiapo Dorice Reid]].

On June 13, 2008, a small majority of members of the House of Ariki attempted a coup, claiming to dissolve the elected government and to take control of the country's leadership. &quot;Basically we are dissolving the leadership, the prime minister and the deputy prime minister and the ministers,&quot; chief Makea Vakatini Joseph Ariki explained. The ''Cook Islands Herald'' suggested that the ''[[ali'i|ariki]]'' were attempting thereby to regain some of their traditional prestige or ''[[mana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/536641/1845025 &quot;Cooks heading for internal strife&quot;], TVNZ, June 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/4583560a12.html &quot;NZ Maori stirs Cooks sovereignty stoush&quot;], Stuff.co.nz, June 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Jim Marurai]] described the take-over move as &quot;ill-founded and nonsensical&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/4587067a12.html &quot;NZ Maori behind strange Cook's 'coup'&quot;], Stuff.co.nz, June 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; By June 23, the situation appeared to have normalised, with members of the House of Ariki accepting to return to their regular duties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=40504 &quot;Cook Islands chiefs drop take over claim, return to normal duties&quot;], Radio New Zealand International, June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent political history==

The [[Cook Islands general election, 1999|1999 election]] produced a [[hung Parliament]].  Cook Islands Party leader [[Geoffrey Henry]] remained Prime Minister, but was replaced after a month by [[Joe Williams (Cook Islands)|Joe Williams]] following a coalition realignment.  A further realignment three months later saw Williams replaced by Democratic Party leader [[Terepai Maoate]].  A third realignment saw Maoate replaced mid-term by his deputy [[Robert Woonton]] in 2002, who ruled with the backing of the CIP.

The Democratic Party won a majority in the [[Cook Islands general election, 2004|2004 election]], but Woonton lost his seat, and was replaced by [[Jim Marurai]].  In 2005 Marurai left the Democrats due to an internal disputes, founding his own [[Cook Islands First Party]].  He continued to govern with the support of the CIP, but in 2005 returned to the Democrats.  The loss of several by-elections forced a snap-election in [[Cook Islands general election, 2006|2006]], which produced a solid majority for the Democrats and saw Marurai continue as Prime Minister.

In December 2009, Marurai sacked his Deputy Prime Minister, [[Terepai Maoate]], sparking a mass-resignation of Democratic Party cabinet members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=51125 |title=Cooks Deputy Prime Minister replaced, prompting a walkout |publisher=Radio New Zealand International |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2009-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democookislands.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=129:cabinet-ministers-resign-in-support-of-party-leader&amp;catid=1:latest-news |title=Cabinet Ministers Resign in Support of Party Leader |publisher=Democratic Party - Cook Islands |date=2009-12-23 |accessdate=2009-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and new Deputy Prime Minister [[Robert Wigmore]] were subsequently expelled from the Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciherald.co.ck/articles/h491a.htm |title=PM sacked by Demo Party |publisher=Cook Islands Herald |date=2009-12-23 |accessdate=2009-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marurai appointed three junior members of the Democratic party to Cabinet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinews.co.ck/2009/December/Wed30/local.htm#0912240106 |title=PM appoints new ministers |publisher=Cook Islands News |date=2009-12-26 |accessdate=2010-01-01}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on 31 December 2009 the party withdrew its support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democookislands.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=133:marurai-wilkie-coalition-falling-apart&amp;catid=1:latest-news |title=Marurai Wilkie coalition falling apart  |publisher=Democratic Party - Cook Islands |date=2009-12-31 |accessdate=2010-01-04}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''[[economic system|Economy]] of the [[Cook Islands]]''', as in many other [[Polynesia|South Pacific]] island nations, is hindered by the isolation of the country from foreign markets, lack of natural resources, periodic devastation from natural disasters, and inadequate [[infrastructure]].

Agriculture provides the economic base with major exports made up of [[copra]] and citrus fruit. Manufacturing activities are limited to fruit-processing, clothing, and handicrafts.

Trade deficits are made up for by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid, overwhelmingly from [[New Zealand]]. Efforts to exploit tourism potential, encourage offshore banking, and expand the mining and fishing industries have been partially successful in stimulating investment and growth.

== Banking &amp; finance ==
The [[Cook Islands]] has &quot;Home Rule&quot; with respect to banking, similar to [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. 

This &quot;Home Rule&quot; banking confuses New Zealanders on vacation in the Cooks. Cook [[automated teller machine]]s often fail to fully disclose the fact that the Cooks are not part of the New Zealand banking system, thus legally requiring banks to charge the same fees for withdrawing or transferring money as if the person was in Australia or the EU. The New Zealand Dollar is the official currency of the Cook Islands, adding to the confusion. Cook Islanders are NZ citizens.

The banking and incorporation laws of the Cook Islands make it an important centre for setting up companies that are involved in global trade.

{{moreref|date=June 2009}}
A '''computer file''' is a block of arbitrary information, or resource for storing information, which is available to a [[computer program]] and is usually based on some kind of durable [[computer storage|storage]]. A file is durable in the sense that it remains available for programs to use after the current program has finished. Computer files can be considered as the modern counterpart of paper [[document]]s which traditionally are kept in offices' and libraries' [[Filing cabinet|files]], and this is the source of the term.

==History==
[[File:PunchCardDecks.agr.jpg|right|thumb|A [[punched card]] file]]
[[File:BRL61-IBM 305 RAMAC.jpeg|right|thumb|The twin [[disk drive|disk files]] of an [[IBM 305]] system]]
The word &quot;file&quot; appeared in the context of computer storage as early as 1952, referring to information stored on [[punched card]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Casey, et al. ''Punched Cards: Their Applications to Science and Industry'', 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; In early usage people regarded the underlying hardware (rather than the contents) as a file. For example, the [[IBM 350]] disk drives were called &quot;disk files&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Martin H. Weik. Ballistic Research Laboratories Report #1115. March 1961. [http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL61-ibm03.html#IBM-305-RAMAC pp. 314-331].&lt;/ref&gt; Systems like the 1962 [[Compatible Time-Sharing System]] featured file systems, which gave the appearance of several &quot;files&quot; on one storage device, leading to the modern usage of the term. File names in CTSS had two parts, a user-readable &quot;primary name&quot; and a &quot;secondary name&quot; indicating the file type.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando J. Corbató et al. &quot;[http://larch-www.lcs.mit.edu:8001/~corbato/sjcc62/ An Experimental Time-Sharing System].&quot; May 3, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerome H. Saltzer ''[http://www.lcs.mit.edu/publications/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TR-016.pdf CTSS Technical Notes]''. Project MIT-LCS-TR016&lt;/ref&gt; This convention remains in use by several operating systems today, including [[Microsoft Windows]]. Although the current term &quot;[[register file]]&quot; shows the early concept of files, it has largely disappeared.

==File contents==
On most modern [[operating systems]], files are organized into one-dimensional arrays of [[byte]]s. The [[file format|format]] of a file is defined by its content since a file is solely a container for data, although, on some platforms the format is usually indicated by its file extension, specifying the rules for how the bytes must be organized and interpreted meaningfully. For example, the bytes of a plain text file (&lt;tt&gt;.txt&lt;/tt&gt; in Windows) are associated with either [[ASCII]] or [[UTF-8]] characters, while the bytes of image, video, and audio files are interpreted otherwise. Most files also allocate a few bytes for [[metadata]] which allows a file to remember some basic information about itself.

=== File size ===
At any instant in time, a file might have a size, normally expressed as number of [[byte]]s, that indicates how much storage is associated with the file. In most modern operating systems the size can be any non-negative whole number of bytes up to a system limit.  However, the general definition of a file does not require that its instant size has any real meaning, unless the data within the file happens to correspond to data within a pool of persistent storage. A special case is a [[zero byte file]]; these files are either an accident (a result of an aborted disk operation) or serve as some kind of [[Flag (computing)|flag]] in the file system.

For example, the file to which the link &lt;tt&gt;/bin/ls&lt;/tt&gt; points in a typical [[Unix-like]] system probably has a defined size that seldom changed. Compare this with &lt;tt&gt;[[/dev/null]]&lt;/tt&gt; which is also a file, but its size may be obscure.

=== Organizing the data in a file ===
Information in a computer file can consist of smaller packets of information (often called &quot;[[Row (database)|records]]&quot; or &quot;lines&quot;) that are individually different but share some trait in common. For example, a payroll file might contain information concerning all the employees in a company and their payroll details; each record in the payroll file concerns just one employee, and all the records have the common trait of being related to payroll—this is very similar to placing all payroll information into a specific filing cabinet in an office that does not have a computer. A text file may contain lines of text, corresponding to printed lines on a piece of paper. Alternatively, a file may contain an arbitrary binary image (a [[BLOB]]) or it may contain an [[executable]].

The way information is grouped into a file is entirely up to how it is designed. This has led to a plethora of more or less standardized file structures for all imaginable purposes, from the simplest to the most complex. Most computer files are used by [[computer programs]] which create, modify or delete the files for their own use on an as-needed basis. The programmers who create the programs decide what files are needed, how they are to be used and (often) their names.

In some cases, computer programs manipulate files that are made visible to the computer user. For example, in a [[word-processing program]], the user manipulates document files that the user personally names. Although the content of the document file is arranged in a format that the word-processing program understands, but the user is able to choose the name and location of the file and provide the bulk of the information (such as words and text) that will be stored in the file.

Many applications pack all their data files into a single file called [[archive file]], using internal markers to discern the different types of information contained within. The benefits of the archive file are to lower the number of files for easier transfer, to reduce storage usage, or just to organize outdated files. The archive file must often be unpacked before next using.

=== File operations ===
At the most basic level there are only two types of file operations; read and write. For example: adding text to a document involves; opening the file (read), inputting the text and saving the file (write)

Files on a computer can be created, moved, modified, grown, shrunk and deleted. In most cases, computer programs that are executed on the computer handle these operations, but the user of a computer can also manipulate files if necessary. For instance, [[Microsoft Word]] files are normally created and modified by the Microsoft Word program in response to user commands, but the user can also move, rename, or delete these files directly by using a [[file manager|file manager program]] such as [[Windows Explorer]] (on Windows computers).

In [[Unix-like]] systems, user-space processes do not normally deal with files at all; the [[operating system]] provides a level of [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] which means that almost all interaction with files from user-space is through [[hard links]].  Hard links allow a name to be associated with a file (or they can be anonymous - and therefore temporary); files do not have names in the OS.  For example, a user-space program cannot delete a file; it can delete a link to a file (for example, using the [[Shell (computing)|shell]] commands &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;mv&lt;/tt&gt; or, in the anonymous case, simply by exiting), and if the kernel determines that there are no more existing links to the file, it may then delete the file.  In fact, it really is only the kernel that deals with files, but it serves to handle all user-space interaction with (virtual) files in a manner that is transparent to the user-space programs

==Semantics==
Although the way programs manipulate files varies according to the operating system and file system involved, the following operations are typical:
*''Creating'' a file with a given name
*Setting ''attributes'' that control operations on the file
*''Opening'' a file to use its contents
*''Reading'' or ''updating'' the contents
*''Committing'' updated contents to durable storage
*''Closing'' the file, thereby losing access until it is opened again

==Identifying and organizing files==
[[File:FileFolders.svg|thumb|200px|right|Files and folders arranged in a hierarchy]]
In modern computer systems, files are typically accessed using names ([[filename]]s).  In some operating systems, the name is associated with the file itself. In others, the file is anonymous, and is pointed to by links that have names. In the latter case, a user can identify the name of the link with the file itself, but this is a false analogue, especially where there exists more than one link to the same file.

Files (or links to files) can be located in directories. However, more generally, a [[File directory|directory]] can contain either a list of files or a list of links to files.  Within this definition, it is of paramount importance that the term &quot;file&quot; includes directories.  This permits the existence of directory hierarchies, i.e., directories containing sub-directories.  A name that refers to a file within a directory must be typically unique. In other words, there must be no identical names within a directory.  However, in some operating systems, a name may include a specification of type that means a directory can contain an identical name for more than one type of object such as a directory and a file.

In environments in which a file is named, a file's name and the path to the file's directory must uniquely identify it among all other files in the computer system—no two files can have the same name and path.  Where a file is anonymous, named references to it will exist within a namespace.  In most cases, any name within the namespace will refer to exactly zero or one file.  However, any file may be represented within any namespace by zero, one or more names.

Any string of characters may or may not be a well-formed name for a file or a link depending upon the context of application. Whether or not a name is well-formed depends on the type of computer system being used. Early computers permitted only a few letters or digits in the name of a file, but modern computers allow long names (some up to 255 characters) containing almost any combination of [[unicode]] letters or unicode digits, making it easier to understand the purpose of a file at a glance. Some computer systems allow file names to contain spaces; others do not. Case-sensitivity of file names is determined by the [[file system]]. Unix file systems are usually case sensitive and allow user-level applications to create files whose names differ only in the case of characters. [[Microsoft Windows]] supports multiple file systems, each with different policies regarding case-sensitivity. The common [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] file system can have multiple files whose names differ only in case if the user uses a [[disk editor]] to edit the file names in the [[File Allocation Table#Directory table|directory entries]]. User applications, however, will usually not allow the user to create multiple files with the same name but differing in case.

Most computers organize files into hierarchies using folders, directories, or catalogs. The concept is the same irrespective of the terminology used. Each folder can contain an arbitrary number of files, and it can also contain other folders. These other folders are referred to as subfolders. Subfolders can contain still more files and folders and so on, thus building a tree-like structure in which one &quot;master folder&quot; (or &quot;root folder&quot; — the name varies from one operating system to another) can contain any number of levels of other folders and files. Folders can be named just as files can (except for the root folder, which often does not have a name). The use of folders makes it easier to organize files in a logical way.

When a computer allows the use of folders, each file and folder has not only a name of its own, but also a path, which identifies the folder or folders in which a file or folder resides. In the path, some sort of special character—such as a slash—is used to separate the file and folder names. For example, in the illustration shown in this article, the path &lt;tt&gt;/Payroll/Salaries/Managers&lt;/tt&gt; uniquely identifies a file called &lt;tt&gt;Managers&lt;/tt&gt; in a folder called &lt;tt&gt;Salaries&lt;/tt&gt;, which in turn is contained in a folder called &lt;tt&gt;Payroll&lt;/tt&gt;. The folder and file names are separated by slashes in this example; the topmost or root folder has no name, and so the path begins with a slash (if the root folder had a name, it would precede this first slash).

Many (but not all) computer systems use [[filename extension|extensions]] in file names to help identify what they contain, also known as the file type. On Windows computers, extensions consist of a dot (period) at the end of a file name, followed by a few letters to identify the type of file. An extension of &lt;tt&gt;.txt&lt;/tt&gt; identifies a text file; a &lt;tt&gt;.doc&lt;/tt&gt; extension identifies any type of document or documentation, commonly in the [[Microsoft Word]] [[file format]]; [[List of file formats|and so on]]. Even when extensions are used in a computer system, the degree to which the computer system recognizes 
and heeds them can vary; in some systems, they are required, while in other systems, they are completely ignored if they are presented.

==Protecting files==
Many modern computer systems provide methods for protecting files against accidental and deliberate damage. Computers that allow for multiple users implement [[file permissions]] to control who may or may not modify, delete, or create files and folders. For example, a given user may be granted only permission to read a file or folder, but not to modify or delete it; or a user may be given permission to read and modify files or folders, but not to execute them. Permissions may also be used to allow only certain users to see the contents of a file or folder. Permissions protect against unauthorized tampering or destruction of information in files, and keep private information confidential from unauthorized users.

Another protection mechanism implemented in many computers is a ''read-only flag.'' When this flag is turned on for a file (which can be accomplished by a computer program or by a human user), the file can be examined, but it cannot be modified. This flag is useful for critical information that must not be modified or erased, such as special files that are used only by internal parts of the computer system. Some systems also include a ''[[Hidden file and hidden directory|hidden flag]]'' to make certain files invisible; this flag is used by the computer system to hide essential system files that users should not alter.

==Storing files==
The discussion above describes a file as a concept presented to a user or a high-level operating system.  However, any file that has any useful purpose, outside of a thought experiment, must have some physical manifestation. That is, a file (an abstract concept) in a real computer system must have a real physical analogue if it is to exist at all. 

In physical terms, most computer files are stored on some type of data storage device. For example, there is a [[hard disk]], from which most [[operating system]]s run and on which most store their files. Hard disk has been the ubiquitous form of [[non-volatile]] storage since the early 1960s. &lt;ref name=&quot;Mee&quot;&gt;Magnetic Storage Handbook 2nd Ed., Section 2.1.1, Disk File Technology, Mee and Daniel, (c)1990,&lt;/ref&gt; Where files contain only temporary information, they may be stored in [[RAM]]. Computer files can be also stored on other media in some cases, such as [[magnetic tape]]s, [[compact disc]]s, [[Digital Versatile Disc]]s, [[Zip drive]]s, [[USB flash drive]]s, etc.

In Unix-like operating systems, many files have no direct association with a physical storage device: &lt;tt&gt;[[/dev/null]]&lt;/tt&gt; is a prime example, as are just about all files under &lt;tt&gt;/dev&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/proc&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;/sys&lt;/tt&gt;.  These can be accessed as files in user space. They are really virtual files that exist, in reality, as objects within the operating system kernel.

==Backing up files==
When computer files contain information that is extremely important, a ''[[back-up]]'' process is used to protect against disasters that might destroy the files. Backing up files simply means making copies of the files in a separate location so that they can be restored if something happens to the computer, or if they are deleted accidentally.

There are many ways to back up files. Most computer systems provide utility programs to assist in the back-up process, which can become very time-consuming if there are many files to safeguard. Files are often copied to removable media such as writable CDs or cartridge tapes. Copying files to another hard disk in the same computer protects against failure of one disk, but if it is necessary to protect against failure or destruction of the entire computer, then copies of the files must be made on other media that can be taken away from the computer and stored in a safe, distant location.

The [[grandfather-father-son backup]] method automatically makes three back ups, the grandfather file is the oldest copy of the file and the son is the current copy.

==File systems and file managers==
The way a computer organizes, names, stores and manipulates files is globally referred to as its ''[[file system]].'' Most computers have at least one file system. Some computers allow the use of several different file systems. For instance, on newer MS Windows computers, the older FAT-type file systems of [[MS-DOS]] and old versions of Windows are supported, in addition to the [[NTFS]] file system that is the normal file system for recent versions of Windows. Each system has its own advantages and disadvantages. Standard FAT allows only eight-character file names (plus a three-character extension) with no spaces, for example, whereas NTFS allows much longer names that can contain spaces. You can call a file &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Payroll records&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; in NTFS, but in FAT you would be restricted to something like &lt;tt&gt;payroll.dat&lt;/tt&gt; (unless you were using [[Vfat#Long_file_names|VFAT]], a FAT extension allowing long file names).

[[File manager]] programs are utility programs that allow users to manipulate files directly. They allow you to move, create, delete and rename files and folders, although they do not actually allow you to read the contents of a file or store information in it. Every computer system provides at least one file-manager program for its native file system. Under Windows, the most commonly used file manager program is Windows Explorer.

'''Christian Andreas Doppler''' (29 November 1803 &amp;ndash; 17 March 1853) was an [[Austria]]n [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]].

==Life and work==
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}
Christian Doppler was raised in [[Salzburg, Austria]], the son of a stone-mason. Doppler could not work in his father's business because of his generally weak physical condition. After completing high school Doppler studied astronomy and mathematics in [[Vienna]] and [[Salzburg]] and started to work at the [[Prague Polytechnic]] (now [[Czech Technical University]]), where he was appointed.

[[File:Christan Doppler österreichischer Pysiker.JPG|thumb|rechts|House in Prague in which Christian lived from 1843 to 1847]]
Only a year later, at the age of 39, Doppler published his most notable work, &quot;[[Über das farbige Licht der Doppelsterne und einiger anderer Gestirne des Himmels]]&quot; ''(On the coloured light of the binary stars and some other stars of the heavens)''. There is a facsimile edition with an English translation by Alec Eden.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlecEden&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last = Eden |first = Alec |title = The search for Christian Doppler |publisher = Springer-Verlag |location = Wien |year = 1992 |isbn = 0387823670 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Doppler postulated his principle (later coined the [[Doppler effect]]) that the observed frequency of a wave depends on the relative speed of the source and the observer, and he tried to use this concept for explaining the colour of binary stars. The Doppler effect of sound was verified by [[C. H. D. Buys Ballot|Buys Ballot]] in 1845. In Doppler's time in [[Prague]] as a professor he published over 50 articles on mathematics, physics and astronomy. In [[1847]] he left Prague for the professorship of mathematics, physics, and mechanics at the [[Academy of Mines and Forests]] in [[Schemnitz]] (Banská Štiavnica, [[Slovakia]]), and in [[1849]] he moved to Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/3039.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Doppler's research in [[Prague]] was interrupted by the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary incidents]] of March 1848, when he fled to [[Vienna]]. There he was appointed head of the Institute for Experimental Physics at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1850. During his time there, Doppler, along with [[Franz Unger]], played an influential role in the development of young [[Gregor Mendel]], known as the founding father of [[genetics]], who was a student at the [[University of Vienna]] from 1851 to 1853.

Doppler died on 17 March 1853 at age 49 from a [[pulmonary disease]] in [[Venice]] (also at that time part of the Austrian Empire). His tomb is just inside the entrance of the Venetian island cemetery of [[San michele|San Michele]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Štoll | first = Ivan | authorlink = | title = Christian Doppler &amp;mdash; Man, Work and Message | encyclopedia = The Phenomenon of Doppler | volume = | pages = 28 | publisher = The Czech National University | location = Prague | year = 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Full name==
Some confusion exists about Doppler's full name. Doppler referred to himself as Christian Doppler. The records of his birth and baptism stated Christian ''Andreas'' Doppler. Forty years after Doppler's death the misnomer ''Johann'' Christian Doppler was introduced by the astronomer [[Julius Scheiner]]. Scheiner's mistake has since been copied by many.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlecEden&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''clerihew''' is a whimsical, four-line biographical poem invented by [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]].  One of his best known is this (1905):

:Sir Christopher Wren
:Said, &quot;I am going to dine with some men.
:If anyone calls
:Say I am designing St. Paul's.&quot;&lt;ref name=bentley&gt;{{cite book||first=E. Clerihew|last=Bentley|year=1905|title=Biography for Beginners|isbn=978-1443753159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
A clerihew has the following properties:
* It is biographical and usually whimsical, showing the subject from an unusual point of view; it pokes fun at mostly famous people
* It has four lines of irregular length and metre (for comic effect)
* The rhyme structure is AABB; the subject matter and wording are often humorously contrived in order to achieve a rhyme
* The first line contains, and may consist solely of, the subject's name.

Clerihews are not satirical or abusive, but they target famous individuals and reposition them in an absurd, [[anachronism|anachronistic]] or commonplace setting, often giving them an over-simplified and slightly garbled description (similar to the schoolboy style of ''[[1066 and All That]]'').

The unbalanced and unpolished [[poetic meter]] and line length parody the [[limerick (poetry)|limerick]], and the clerihew form also parodies the [[eulogy]].

==Practitioners==
The form was invented by and is named after [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]]. When he was a 16-year-old pupil at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London, the lines about [[Humphry Davy]] came into his head during a science class.&lt;ref name=gale&gt;{{cite book|last=Gale|first=Steven H.|year=1996|title=Encyclopedia of British Humorists: Geoffrey Chaucer to John Cleese|page=139|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-8240-5990-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his schoolfriends, he filled a notebook with examples.&lt;ref name=First&gt;{{cite book|first=E. Clerihew|last=Bentley|title=The First Clerihews|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0-19-212980-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of the word in print was in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clerihew published three volumes of his own clerihews: ''Biography for Beginners'' (1905), published as &quot;edited by E. Clerihew&quot;;&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; ''More Biography'' (1929); and ''Baseless Biography'' (1939), a compilation of clerihews originally published in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' illustrated by the author's son [[Nicolas Bentley]].

Bentley's friend, [[G. K. Chesterton]], was also a practitioner of the clerihew and one of the sources of its popularity. Chesterton provided verses and illustrations for the original schoolboy notebook and illustrated ''Biography for Beginners''.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; Other serious authors also produced clerihews, including [[W. H. Auden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=Michael|year=2007|title=The All-sustaining Air: Romantic Legacies and Renewals in British, American, and Irish Poetry Since 1900|page=94|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-929928-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains a popular humorous form among other writers and the general public. Among contemporary writers, the satirist [[Craig Brown (satirist)|Craig Brown]] has made considerable use of the clerihew in his columns for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

==Examples==
The first ever clerihew was written about Sir Humphry Davy:
:Sir Humphry Davy
:Was not fond of gravy.
:He lived in the odium
:Of having discovered [[sodium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A25568445 BBC - h2g2 - Sir Humphry Davy FRS (1778 - 1829)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

When this clerihew was published in 1905, &quot;Was not fond of&quot;&lt;ref name=First/&gt; was replaced by &quot;Abominated&quot;. Other classic clerihews by Bentley include:
:[[George III of the United Kingdom|George the Third]]
:Ought never to have occurred.
:One can only wonder
:At so grotesque a blunder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Morton S. (ed.)|year=1997|title=A New Dictionary of Eponyms|page=50|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-509354-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[John Stuart Mill]],
:By a mighty effort of will,
:Overcame his natural bonhomie
:And wrote ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography for Beginners''. {{cite book|last=Swainson|first=Bill (ed.)|year=2000|title=Encarta Book of Quotations|pages=642–43|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-23000-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auden's &quot;Literary Graffitti&quot; includes:
:Sir [[Henry Rider Haggard]]
:Was completely staggered
:When his bride-to-be
:Announced, &quot;I am [[She (novel)|She]]!

A clerihew much appreciated by chemists is cited in ''Dark Sun'' by [[Richard Rhodes]] regarding the inventor of the thermos bottle (or [[Dewar flask]]): 
:[[Sir James Dewar]]
:Is smarter than you are
:None of you asses
:Can liquify gases.

A modern literary example is:
:[[Ted Hughes]],
:[[Sylvia Plath|Sylvia's]] muse,
:was rather good-looking.
:Let his wife [[Sylvia Plath#Death|do the cooking]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askaword.com/?q=clerihew&amp;d=ls&amp;libs= Credited to Caroline Dworin]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' Magazine ran a contest titled &quot;Do You Clerihew?&quot; The winning entry was:
:Did [[Descartes]]
:Depart
:With the thought
:&quot;[[Cogito ergo sum|Therefore I'm not]]&quot;?

A '''civil war''' is a [[war]] between organized groups within the same [[nation state]] or [[republic]],&lt;ref name=fearon&gt;[[James Fearon]], [http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070301faessay86201/james-d-fearon/iraq-s-civil-war.html &quot;Iraq's Civil War&quot;] in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', March/April 2007. For further discussion on civil war classification, see [[#Definition|the section &quot;Definition&quot;]].&lt;/ref&gt; or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly-united nation state.&lt;ref name=&quot;EH&quot;&gt;[http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/1130 Nations, Markets, and War: Modern History and the American Civil War | Book Reviews], EH.net. &quot;Two nations [within the U.S.] developed because of slavery.&quot; October 2006.  Retrieved July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region, or to change government policies.&lt;ref name=fearon /&gt; 
The term is a calque of the Latin ''[[:wikt:bellum civile|bellum civile]]'' which was used to refer to the various [[Roman civil wars|civil wars of the Roman Republic]] in the 1st century BC. 

A civil war is a high-intensity conflict, often involving [[Regular Army|regular armed forces]], that is sustained, organized and large-scale. Civil wars may result in large numbers of [[casualty (person)|casualties]] and the consumption of significant resources.&lt;ref name=hironaka3&gt;Ann Hironaka, ''Neverending Wars: The International Community, Weak States, and the Perpetuation of Civil War'', Harvard University Press: Cambridge, Mass., 2005, p. 3, ISBN 0674015320&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil wars since the end of [[World War II]] have lasted on average just over four years, a dramatic rise from the one-and-a-half year average of the 1900-1944 period. While the rate of emergence of new civil wars has been relatively steady since the mid-19th century, the increasing length of those wars resulted in increasing numbers of wars ongoing at any one time. For example, there were no more than five civil wars underway simultaneously in the first half of the 20th century, while over 20 concurrent civil wars were occurring at the end of the [[Cold War]], before a significant decrease as conflicts strongly associated with the superpower rivalry came to an end.  Since 1945, civil wars have resulted in the deaths of over 25 million people, as well as the [[forced migration|forced displacement]] of millions more. Civil wars have further resulted in economic collapse; [[Burma]] (Myanmar), [[Uganda]] and [[Angola]] are examples of nations that were considered to have promising futures before being engulfed in civil wars.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka (2005), pp. 1-2, 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:T-55s civil war.JPG|thumb|left|Remains of a [[T-62]] tank after rebels enter [[Addis Ababa]] at the end of the [[Ethiopian Civil War]], 1991]]
[[James Fearon]], a scholar of civil wars at [[Stanford University]], defines a civil war as &quot;a violent conflict within a country fought by organized groups that aim to take power at the center or in a region, or to change government policies&quot;.&lt;ref name=fearon/&gt; Ann Hironaka further specifies that one side of a civil war is the [[state (polity)|state]].&lt;ref name=hironaka3/&gt; The intensity at which a civil disturbance becomes a civil war is contested by academics. Some political scientists define a civil war as having more than 1000 casualties,&lt;ref name=fearon/&gt; while others further specify that at least 100 must come from each side.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Wong, [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/world/middleeast/26war.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin &quot;A Matter of Definition: What Makes a Civil War, and Who Declares It So?&quot;] ''New York Times'' November 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Correlates of War]], a dataset widely used by scholars of conflict, classifies civil wars as having over 1000 war-related casualties per year of conflict. This rate is a small fraction of the millions killed in the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] and [[Cambodian Civil War]], for example, but excludes several highly publicized conflicts, such as [[The Troubles]] of [[Northern Ireland]] and the struggle of the [[African National Congress]] in [[History of South Africa in the Apartheid era|Apartheid]]-era [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=hironaka3/&gt;

Based on the 1000 casualties per year criterion, there were 213 civil wars from 1816 to 1997, 104 of which occurred from 1944 to 1997.&lt;ref name=hironaka3/&gt; If one uses the less-stringent 1000 casualties total criterion, there were over 90 civil wars between 1945 and 2007, with 20 ongoing civil wars as of 2007.&lt;ref name=fearon/&gt;

The [[Geneva Conventions]] do not specifically define the term &quot;civil war&quot;. They do, however, describe the criteria for acts qualifying as &quot;armed conflict not of an international character&quot;, which includes civil wars. Among the conditions listed are four requirements:&lt;ref&gt;Final Record of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention|Diplomatic Conference of Geneva of 1949]], (Volume II-B, p. 121)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590006?OpenDocument commentary] on Third 1949 Geneva Convention, Article III, Section &quot;A. Cases of armed conflict&quot; for the ICRC's reading of the definition and a listing of proposed alternate wording&lt;/ref&gt;

* The party in revolt must be in possession of a part of the national territory.
* The [[Insurgency|insurgent]] civil authority must exercise ''de facto'' authority over the population within the determinate portion of the national territory.
* The insurgents must have some amount of recognition as a belligerent.
* The legal Government is &quot;obliged to have recourse to the regular military forces against insurgents organized as military.&quot;

==Causes of civil war in the Collier-Hoeffler Model==

Scholars investigating the cause of civil war are attracted by two opposing theories, [[greed versus grievance]]. Roughly stated: are conflicts caused by who people are, whether that be defined in terms of ethnicity, religion or other social affiliation, or do conflicts begin because it is in the economic best interests of individuals and groups to start them? Scholarly analysis supports the conclusion that economic and structural factors are more important than those of identity in predicting occurrences of civil war.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Hironaka (2005), pp. 9-10, and [[Paul Collier|Collier, Paul]], Anke Hoeffler and Nicholas Sambanis, &quot;The Collier-Hoeffler Model of Civil War Onset and the Case Study Project Research Design,&quot; in Collier &amp; Sambanis, Vol 1, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive studies of civil war was carried out by a team from the [[World Bank]] in the early 21st century. The study framework, which came to be called the Collier-Hoeffler Model, examined 78 five-year increments when civil war occurred from 1960 to 1999, as well as 1,167 five-year increments of &quot;no civil war&quot; for comparison, and subjected the data set to [[regression analysis]] to see the effect of various factors. The factors that were shown to have a statistically-significant effect on the chance that a civil war would occur in any given five-year period were:&lt;ref name=cs17&gt;Collier &amp; Sambanis, Vol 1, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

;Availability of finance
[[Image:Childrenmining 300.jpg|thumb|left|An economic dependence on commodities, such as [[diamond]]s being mined by these children in [[Sierra Leone]], is correlated with an increased risk of civil war.  ''(See also [[blood diamond]].)'']]
A high proportion of primary [[commodity|commodities]] in national exports significantly increases the risk of a conflict. A country at &quot;peak danger&quot;, with commodities comprising 32% of [[gross domestic product]], has a 22% risk of falling into civil war in a given five-year period, while a country with no primary commodity exports has a 1% risk. When disaggregated, only [[petroleum]] and non-petroleum groupings showed different results: a country with relatively low levels of dependence on petroleum exports is at slightly less risk, while a high-level of dependence on oil as an export results in slightly more risk of a civil war than national dependence on another primary commodity. The authors of the study interpreted this as being the result of the ease by which primary commodities may be extorted or captured compared to other forms of wealth, for example, it is easy to capture and control the output of a gold mine or oil field compared to a sector of garment manufacturing or hospitality services.&lt;ref name=cs16&gt;Collier &amp; Sambanis, Vol 1, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

A second source of finance is national [[diaspora]]s, which can fund rebellions and insurgencies from abroad. The study found that statistically switching the size of a country's diaspora from the smallest found in the study to the largest resulted in a sixfold increase in the chance of a civil war.&lt;ref name=cs16/&gt;

[[File:Arab volunteers.jpg|thumb|Armed [[Arab]] volunteers during the [[1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|1947-1948 civil war]] in the [[British Mandate of Palestine]]]]
;Opportunity cost of rebellion
Higher male secondary school enrollment, per capita income and economic growth rate all had significant effects on reducing the chance of civil war. Specifically, a male secondary school enrollment 10% above the average reduced the chance of a conflict by about 3%, while a growth rate 1% higher than the study average resulted in a decline in the chance of a civil war of about 1%. The study interpreted these three factors as proxies for earnings foregone by rebellion, and therefore that lower foregone earnings encourages rebellion.&lt;ref name=cs16/&gt; Phrased another way: young males (who make up the vast majority of combatants in civil wars) are less likely to join a rebellion if they are getting an education and/or have a comfortable salary, and can reasonably assume that they will prosper in the future.

Low per capita income has been proposed as a cause for grievance, prompting armed rebellion. However, for this to be true, one would expect economic inequality to also be a significant factor in rebellions, which it is not. The study therefore concluded that the economic model of [[opportunity cost]] better explained the findings.&lt;ref name=cs17/&gt;

;Military advantage
[[Image:Battle of Siping01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Communist Party of China|Communist]] soldiers during the [[Battle of Siping]], [[Chinese Civil War]], 1946]]
High levels of population dispersion and, to a lesser extent, the presence of mountainous terrain increased the chance of conflict. Both of these factors favor rebels, as a population dispersed outward toward the borders is harder to control than one concentrated in a central region, while mountains offer terrain where rebels can seek sanctuary.&lt;ref name=cs16/&gt;

;Grievance
Most proxies for &quot;grievance&quot; - the theory that civil wars begin because of issues of identity, rather than economics - were statistically insignificant, including economic equality, political rights, ethnic polarization and religious fractionalization. Only ethnic dominance, the case where the largest ethnic group comprises a majority of the population, increased the risk of civil war. A country characterized by ethnic dominance has nearly twice the chance of a civil war. However, the combined effects of ethnic and religious fractionalization, i.e. the more chance that any two randomly chosen people will be from separate ethnic or religious groups the less chance of a civil war, were also significant and positive, as long as the country avoided ethnic dominance.  The study interpreted this as stating that minority groups are more likely to rebel if they feel that they are being dominated, but that rebellions are more likely to occur the more homogeneous the population and thus more cohesive the rebels. These two factors may thus be seen as mitigating each other in many cases.&lt;ref name=cs18&gt;Collier &amp; Sambanis, Vol 1, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

;Population size
The various factors contributing to the risk of civil war rise increase with population size. The risk of a civil war rises approximately proportionately with the size of a country's population.&lt;ref name=cs17/&gt;

;Time
The more time that has elapsed since the last civil war, the less likely it is that a conflict will recur. The study had two possible explanations for this: one opportunity-based and the other grievance-based. The elapsed time may represent the [[depreciation]] of whatever [[Capital (economics)|capital]] the rebellion was fought over and thus increase the opportunity cost of restarting the conflict. Alternatively, elapsed time may represent the gradual process of healing of old hatreds. The study found that the presence of diaspora substantially reduced the positive effect of time, as the funding from diasporas offsets the depreciation of rebellion-specific capital.&lt;ref name=cs18/&gt;

== Duration of civil wars ==

Ann Hironaka, author of ''Neverending Wars'', divides the modern history of civil wars into the pre-19th century, 19th century to early 20th century, and late 20th century. In 19th century Europe, the length of civil wars fell significantly, largely due to the nature of the conflicts as battles for the power center of the state, the strength of centralized governments, and the normally quick and decisive intervention by other states to support the government. Following [[World War II]] the duration of civil wars grew past the norm of the pre-19th century, largely due to weakness of the many postcolonial states and the intervention by major powers on both sides of conflict. The most obvious commonality to civil wars are that they occur in [[fragile state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil wars in the 19th and early 20th centuries ===
[[File:Tykistokoulun harjoiitus.jpg|thumb|An artillery school set up by the anti-socialist &quot;Whites&quot; during the [[Finnish Civil War]], 1918]]
Civil wars through the 19th century to early 20th century tended to be short; the average length of a civil war between 1900 and 1944 was one and half years.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The state itself was the obvious center of authority in the majority of cases, and the civil wars were thus fought for control of the state. This meant that whoever had control of the capital and the military could normally crush resistance. If a rebellion failed to quickly seize the capital and control of the military for itself, it was normally doomed to a quick destruction. For example, the fighting associated with the 1871 [[Paris Commune]] occurred almost entirely in [[Paris]], and ended quickly once the military sided with the government.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, pp. 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;

The power of non-state actors resulted in a lower value placed on [[sovereignty]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, which further reduced the number of civil wars. For example, the [[Barbary pirate|pirates]] of the [[Barbary Coast]] were recognized as ''de facto'' states because of their military power. The Barbary pirates thus had no need to rebel against the [[Ottoman Empire]], who were their nominal state government, to gain recognition for their sovereignty. Conversely, states such as [[Virginia]] and [[Massachusetts]] in the [[United States|United States of America]] did not have sovereign status, but had significant political and economic independence coupled with weak federal control, reducing the incentive to secede.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; 

The two major global ideologies, [[monarchism]] and [[democracy]], led to several civil wars. However, a bi-polar world, divided between the two ideologies, did not develop, largely due the dominance of monarchists through most of the period. The monarchists would thus normally intervene in other countries to stop democratic movements taking control and forming democratic governments, which were seen by monarchists as being both dangerous and unpredictable. The [[Great power|Great Powers]], defined in the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]] as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Austrian Empire|Habsburg Austria]], [[Prussia]], [[France]], and [[Russia]], would frequently coordinate interventions in other nations' civil wars, nearly always on the side of the incumbent government. Given the military strength of the Great Powers, these interventions were nearly always decisive and quickly ended the civil wars.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Savoia-Marchetti SM.81.jpg|thumb|A [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81|plane]], supported by [[Fiat CR.32|smaller fighter planes]], of [[Francisco Franco]]'s Nationalists bombs [[Madrid]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-1939)]] 
There were several exceptions from the general rule of quick civil wars during this period. The [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) was unusual for at least two reasons: it was fought around regional identities, rather than political ideologies, and it was ended through a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]], rather than over a decisive battle over control of the capital, as was the norm. The [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939) was exceptional because ''both'' sides of the war received support from intervening great powers: [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Portugal]] supported opposition leader [[Francisco Franco]], while [[France]] and [[Russia]] supported [[Second Spanish Republic|the government]]&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[proxy war]]).

=== Civil wars since 1945 ===
In the 1990s, about twenty civil wars were occurring concurrently during an average year, a rate about ten times the historical average since the 19th century. However, the rate of new civil wars had not increased appreciably; the drastic rise in the number of ongoing wars after [[World War II]] was a result of the tripling of the average duration of civil wars to over four years.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, p. 1, 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; This increase was a result of the increased number of states, the [[fragile state|fragility of states]] formed after 1945, the decline in interstate war, and the Cold War rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, pp. 7 &amp; 23&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following World War II, the major European powers divested themselves of their colonies at an increasing rate: the number of ex-colonial states jumped from about 30 to almost 120 after the war. The rate of state formation leveled off in the 1980s, at which point few colonies remained.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, pp. 36&lt;/ref&gt; More states also meant more states in which to have long civil wars. Hironaka statistically measures the impact of the increased number of ex-colonial states as increasing the post-WWII incidence of civil wars by +165% over the pre-1945 number.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the new ex-colonial states appeared to follow the blueprint of the idealized state - centralized government, territory enclosed by defined borders, and citizenry with defined rights -, as well as accessories such as a national flag, an anthem, a seat at the [[United Nations]] and an official economic policy, they were in actuality far weaker than the Western states they were modeled after.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  In Western states, the structure of governments closely matched states' actual capabilities, which had been arduously developed over centuries. The development of strong administrative structures, in particular those related to extraction of taxes, is closely associated with the intense warfare between predatory European states in the 17th and 18th centuries, or in [[Charles Tilly]]'s famous formulation: &quot;War made the state and the state made war&quot;.&lt;ref name=H6&gt;Hironaka, 2005, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the formation of the modern states of [[Germany]] and [[Italy]] in the 19th century is closely associated with the wars of expansion and consolidation led by [[Prussia]] and [[Sardinia]], respectively.&lt;ref name=H6/&gt; The Western process of forming effective and impersonal bureaucracies, developing efficient tax systems, and integrating national territory continued into the 20th century; as late as [[World War I]], some French military conscripts from rural regions were unable to name the country they were fighting for.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Western states that survived into the latter half of the 20th century were considered &quot;strong&quot; by simple reason that they had managed to develop the institutional structures and military capability required to survive predation by their fellow states.

In sharp contrast, [[decolonization]] was an entirely different process of state formation. Most imperial powers had not foreseen a need to prepare their colonies for independence; for example, Britain had given limited self-rule to [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]], while treating [[British Somaliland]] as little more than a trading post, while all major decisions for French colonies were made in Paris and [[Belgium]] prohibited any self-government up until it suddenly granted independence to its colonies in 1960. Like Western states of previous centuries, the new ex-colonies lacked autonomous bureaucracies, which would make decisions based on the benefit to society as a whole, rather than respond to [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[nepotism]] to favor a particular interest group. In such a situation, factions manipulate the state to benefit themselves or, alternatively, state leaders use the bureaucracy to further their own self-interest. The lack of credible governance was compounded by the fact that most colonies were economic loss-makers at independence, lacking both a productive economic base and a taxation system to effectively extract resources from economic activity. Among the rare states profitable at decolonization was India, to which scholars credibly argue that [[Uganda]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Angola]] may be included. Neither did imperial powers make territorial integration a priority, and may have discouraged nascent nationalism as a danger to their rule. Many newly independent states thus found themselves impoverished, with minimal administrative capacity in a fragmented society, while faced with the expectation of immediately meeting the demands of a modern state.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, pp. 59-61&lt;/ref&gt; Such states are considered &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;[[Fragile state|fragile&quot;]].  The &quot;strong&quot;-&quot;weak&quot; categorization is not the same as &quot;Western&quot;-&quot;non-Western&quot;, as some Latin American states like [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]] and Middle Eastern states like [[Egypt]] and [[Israel]] are considered to have &quot;strong&quot; administrative structures and economic infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Checkpoint 4, Beirut 1982.jpg|thumb|left|A checkpoint manned by the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] army and [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]], 1982. The [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975–1990) was characterized by multiple foreign interventions.]] 
Historically, the international community would have targeted weak states for territorial absorption or colonial domination or, alternatively, such states would fragment into pieces small enough to be effectively administered and secured by a local power. However, international norms towards sovereignty changed in the wake of WWII in ways that support and maintain the existence of weak states. Weak states are given ''[[de jure]]'' sovereignty equal to that of other states, even when they do not have ''[[de facto]]'' sovereignty or control of their own territory, including the privileges of international diplomatic recognition and an equal vote in the United Nations. Further, the international community offers [[development aid]] to weak states, which helps maintain the facade of a functioning modern state by giving the appearance that the state is capable of fulfilling its implied responsibilities of control and order.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, pp. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of a strong [[international law]] regime and norms against territorial aggression is strongly associated with the dramatic drop in the number of interstate wars, though it has also been attributed to the effect of the Cold War or to the changing nature of economic development. Consequently, military aggression that results in territorial annexation became increasingly likely to prompt international condemnation, diplomatic censure, a reduction in international aid or the introduction of economic sanction, or, as in the case of 1990 [[invasion of Kuwait]] by [[Iraq]], international military intervention to reverse the territorial aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the international community has largely refused to recognize secessionist regions, while keeping some states such as [[Cyprus]] and [[Taiwan]] in diplomatic recognition limbo. While there is not a large body of academic work examining the relationship, Hironaka's statistical study found a correlation that suggests that every major international anti-secessionist declaration increased the number of ongoing civil wars by +10%, or a total +114% from 1945-1997.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, pp. 37-40&lt;/ref&gt; The diplomatic and legal protection given by the international community, as well as economic support to weak governments and discouragement of secession, thus had the unintended effect of encouraging civil wars.

There has been an enormous amount of international intervention in civil wars since 1945 that served to extend wars. While intervention has been practiced since the international system has existed, its nature changed substantially. It became common for both the state and opposition group to receive foreign support, allowing wars to continue well past the point when domestic resources had been exhausted. Superpowers, such as the European [[great powers]], had always felt no compunction in intervening in civil wars that affected their interests, while distant regional powers such as the United States could declare the interventionist [[Monroe Doctrine]] of 1821 for events in its Central American &quot;backyard&quot;.  However, the large population of weak states after 1945 allowed intervention by former colonial powers, regional powers and neighboring states who themselves often had scarce resources. On average, a civil war with interstate intervention was 300% longer than those without. When disaggregated, a civil war with intervention on only one side is 156% longer, while intervention on both sides lengthens the average civil war by an addition 92%. If one of the intervening states was a superpower, a civil war is extended a further 72%; a conflict such as the [[Angolan Civil War]], in which there is two-sided foreign intervention, including by a superpower (actually, two superpowers in the case of Angola), would be 538% longer on average than a civil war without any international intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, pp. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect of the Cold War ===
The [[Cold War]] (1945–1989) provided a global network of material and ideological support that perpetuated civil wars, which were mainly fought in weak ex-colonial states, rather than the relatively strong states that were aligned with the [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]. In some cases, superpowers would superimpose Cold War ideology onto local conflicts, while in others local actors using Cold War ideology would attract the attention of a superpower to obtain support. Using a separate statistical evaluation than used above for interventions, civil wars that included pro- or anti-communist forces lasted 141% longer than the average non-Cold War conflict, while a Cold War civil war that attracted superpower intervention resulted in wars typically lasting over three times as long as other civil wars. Conversely, the end of the Cold War marked by the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989 resulted in a reduction in the duration of Cold War civil wars of 92% or, phrased another way, a roughly ten-fold increase in the rate of resolution of Cold War civil wars. Lengthy Cold War-associated civil conflicts that ground to a halt include the wars of [[Guatemalan Civil War|Guatemala]] (1960–1996), [[Salvadoran Civil War|El Salvador]] (1979–1991), [[History of Nicaragua|Nicaragua]] (1970–1990) and [[Internal conflict in Peru|Peru]] (1980–2000).&lt;ref&gt;Hironaka, 2005, pp. 48-50&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chocolate.jpg|300px|thumb|Chocolate most commonly comes in dark, milk, and white varieties, with [[cocoa solids]] contributing to the [[brown]] coloration.]] '''Chocolate''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|En-us-chocolate.ogg|ˈ|tʃ|ɒ|k|l|ɨ|t}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɒ|k|əl|ɨ|t}}) is a raw or processed food produced from the seed of the tropical ''[[Theobroma cacao]]'' tree. Cacao has been cultivated for at least three millennia in [[Mexico]], Central and South America, with its earliest documented use around 1100 BC. The majority of the [[Mesoamerican]] people made chocolate beverages, including the [[Aztec]]s, who made it into a beverage known as ''xocolātl'' ({{IPA|/ʃo.ko.laːtɬ/}}), a [[Nahuatl]] word meaning &quot;bitter water&quot;. The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense [[bitter (taste)|bitter]] taste, and must be [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] to develop the flavor.

After fermentation, the beans are dried, then cleaned, and then roasted, and the shell is removed to produce cacao nibs. The nibs are then ground to [[cocoa mass]], pure chocolate in rough form. Because this cocoa mass usually is liquefied then molded with or without other ingredients, it is called [[chocolate liquor]]. The liquor also may be processed into two components: [[cocoa solids]] and [[cocoa butter]]. Unsweetened [[Types of chocolate|baking chocolate]] (bitter chocolate) contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of [[sweet chocolate]], combining cocoa solids, cocoa butter or other fat, and sugar. [[Milk chocolate]] is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. [[White chocolate]] contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk but no cocoa solids.

Cocoa solids contain [[alkaloid]]s such as [[theobromine]] and [[phenethylamine]], which have physiological effects on the body. It has been linked to [[serotonin]] levels in the [[brain]]. Some research found that chocolate, eaten in moderation, can lower blood pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;JAMA&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Effects of Low Habitual Cocoa Intake on Blood Pressure and Bioactive Nitric Oxide|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=4 July 2007|first=Dirk|last=Taubert|coauthors=Renate Roesen, Clara Lehmann, Norma Jung, Edgar Schömig|volume=298|issue=1|pages=49–60|doi= 10.1001/jama.298.1.49|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/298/1/49|format=|accessdate=12 January 2010|pmid=17609490 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of [[theobromine]] renders chocolate toxic to some animals,&lt;ref name=&quot;dogs&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vetmedicine.about.com/cs/nutritiondogs/a/chocolatetoxici.htm|title=Veterinary Q &amp; A: Chocolate Toxicity|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=20 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially dogs and cats.

Chocolate has become one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes have become traditional on certain holidays: chocolate bunnies and [[Easter egg|eggs]] are popular on [[Easter]], chocolate coins on [[Hanukkah]], [[Santa Claus]] and other holiday symbols on [[Christmas]], and chocolate [[heart (symbol)|heart]]s or chocolate in heart-shaped boxes on [[Valentine's Day]]. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, to produce [[chocolate milk]] and [[hot chocolate]]. Around three quarters of the world's cacao bean production takes place in [[West Africa]].

==Etymology==
The word &quot;chocolate&quot; entered the English language from [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref name=heritagedictionary&gt;{{Cite web|title=The American Heritage Dictionary |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/68/C0316800.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080517202741/http://www.bartleby.com/61/68/C0316800.html |archivedate=2008-05-17 |accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; How the word came into Spanish is less certain, and there are multiple competing explanations. Perhaps the most cited explanation is that &quot;chocolate&quot; comes from [[Nahuatl]], the language of the [[Aztec]]s, from the word &quot;chocolātl&quot;, which many sources derived from the Nahuatl word &quot;xocolātl&quot; ({{IPA|/ʃo.ko.laːtɬ/}}) made up from the words &quot;xococ&quot; meaning [[sour]] or [[bitter (taste)|bitter]], and &quot;ātl&quot; meaning water or drink.&lt;ref name=heritagedictionary/&gt; However, as [[William Bright]] noted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Campbell |first=Lyle |title=Quichean Linguistic Prehistory; University of California Publications in Linguistics No. 81 |location=Berkeley, California |publisher=University of California Press |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; the word &quot;chocolatl&quot; does not occur in central Mexican [[Colonisation|colonial]] sources, making this an unlikely derivation. [[Francisco J. Santamaría|Santamaria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Santamaria |first=Francisco |title=Diccionario de Mejicanismos |place=Mexico |publisher=Editorial Porrúa S. A.|pages=412–413}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives a derivation from the [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya]] word &quot;chokol&quot; meaning hot, and the Nahuatl &quot;atl&quot; meaning water. More recently, Dakin and [[Søren Wichmann|Wichmann]] derive it from another Nahuatl term, &quot;chicolatl&quot; from eastern Nahuatl, meaning &quot;beaten drink&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0956536100111058 |title=Cacao and Chocolate: A Uto-Aztecan perspective |year=2000 |last1=Dakin |first1=Karen |last2=Wichmann |first2=Søren |journal=Ancient Mesoamerica |volume=11 |pages=55–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; They derive this term from the word for the frothing stick, &quot;chicoli&quot;.

==History==
[[File:Mayan people and chocolate.jpg|thumb|A Mayan chief forbids a person to touch a jar of chocolate]]
{{See also|History of chocolate}}
''[[Theobroma cacao]]'', native to Mexico, Central and South America, has been cultivated for at least three millennia in that region. Cocoa mass was used originally in Mesoamerica both as a beverage and as an ingredient in foods.

Chocolate has been used as a drink for nearly all of its history. The earliest record of using chocolate dates back before the [[Olmec]]. In November 2007, archaeologists reported finding evidence of the oldest known cultivation and use of cacao at a site in Puerto Escondido, [[Honduras]], dating from about 1100 to 1400&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;alc&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.upenn.edu/new/news/fullrelease.php?which=306|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071202095415/http://www.museum.upenn.edu/new/news/fullrelease.php?which=306|archivedate=2007-12-02|title=New Chemical Analyses Take Confirmation Back 500 Years and Reveal that the Impetus for Cacao Cultivation was an Alcoholic Beverage|publisher=Penn Museum|accessdate = 13 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residues found and the kind of vessel they were found in indicate the initial use of cacao was not simply as a beverage, but the white pulp around the cacao beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink.&lt;ref name=&quot;alc&quot;/&gt; The Maya civilization grew cacao trees in their backyards,&lt;ref name=&quot;mayanrule&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/Chocolate/history_mesoamerican3.html|title=Chocolate: A Mesoamerican Luxury 250-900 C.E.

In the [[New World]], chocolate was consumed in a bitter, spicy drink called ''xocoatl'', and was often flavored with [[vanilla]], [[chili pepper]], and [[achiote]] (known today as [[annatto]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lasculturas.com/lib/rcp/rcpAchiote.htm|title=Achiote (Annatto) Cooking|publisher=las Culturas|accessdate=21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xocoatl was believed to fight fatigue, a belief that is probably attributable to the [[theobromine]] content. Chocolate was also an important luxury good throughout [[pre-Columbian]] Mesoamerica, and cacao beans were often used as [[currency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.athenapub.com/chocolat.htm|work=Athena Review |title=A Brief History of Chocolate, Food of the Gods|publisher=Athena Pub|accessdate=8 June 2007 |volume=2| issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost one hundred cacao beans and one fresh [[avocado]] was worth three beans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Bill|last=Buford|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/10/29/071029fa_fact_buford|title=Notes of a Gastronome: Extreme Chocolate: Reporting &amp; Essays: The New Yorker|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=17 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; South American and European cultures have used cocoa to treat diarrhea for hundreds of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-09/chr-dch092905.php|title=Dark chocolate helps diarrhea|publisher=Children's Hospital &amp; Research Center at Oakland|accessdate=2 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the areas that were conquered by the Aztecs that grew cacao beans were ordered to pay them as a [[tax]], or as the Aztecs called it, a &quot;[[tribute]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/Chocolate/history_mesoamerican7.html|title=Chocolate: A Mesoamerican Luxury 1200—1521 - Obtaining Cacao|publisher=Field Museum|accessdate=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 16th century, no European had ever heard of the popular drink from the [[Central America|Central]] and South American peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jus&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/Chocolate/history_european.html|title=Chocolate: A European Sweet|publisher=Field Museum|accessdate=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs that chocolate could be imported to Europe. In Spain, it quickly became a court favorite. In a century it had spread and become popular throughout the European continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jus&quot;/&gt; To keep up with the high demand for this new drink, Spanish armies began enslaving Mesoamericans to produce cacao.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/Chocolate/history_european3.html|title=Chocolate: A European Sweet - 1521—1600 - Obtaining Cacao|publisher=Field Museum|accessdate=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with cacao harvesting becoming a regular business, only royalty and the well-connected could afford to drink this expensive import.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/Chocolate/history_european5.html|title=Chocolate: A European Sweet 1521–1600 - Using Chocolate|publisher=Field Museum|accessdate=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before long, the Spanish began growing cacao beans on plantations, and using an African workforce to help manage them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/Chocolate/history_european8.html|title=Chocolate: A European Sweet - 1600–1750 - Obtaining Cacao|publisher=Field Museum|accessdate=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was different in England. Put simply, anyone with money could buy it.&lt;ref name=&quot;ten&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/Chocolate/history_european10.html|title=Chocolate: A European Sweet - 1600–1750 - Using Chocolate|publisher=Field Museum|accessdate=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first chocolate house opened in London in 1657.&lt;ref name=&quot;ten&quot;/&gt; In 1689, noted physician and collector [[Hans Sloane]] developed a milk chocolate drink in [[Jamaica]] which was initially used by [[apothecaries]], but later sold to the [[John Cadbury|Cadbury]] brothers in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/projects/sloane-herbarium/hanssloane.htm|title=About Hans Sloane|publisher=[[Natural History Museum]]|accessdate=8 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chocolate in its solid form was invented in 1847. [[Joseph Fry]] and Son discovered a way to mix some of the cocoa butter back into the [[Dutch process chocolate|Dutched]] chocolate, and added sugar, creating a paste that could be moulded. The result was the first modern chocolate bar.

For hundreds of years, the chocolate-making process remained unchanged. When the [[Industrial Revolution]] arrived, many changes occurred that brought about the food today in its modern form. A Dutch family's ([[Coenraad Johannes van Houten|van Houten]]) inventions made mass production of shiny, tasty chocolate bars and related products possible. In the 18th century, mechanical mills were created that squeezed out cocoa butter, which in turn helped to create hard, durable chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/Chocolate/history_contemp4.html|title=Chocolate: A Contemporary Confection 1750—1910 - Making Chocolate|publisher=Field Museum|accessdate=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, it was not until the arrival of the Industrial Revolution that these mills were put to bigger use. Not long after the revolution cooled down, companies began advertising this new invention to sell many of the chocolate treats we see today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/Chocolate/history_contemp5.html|title=Chocolate: A Contemporary Confection 1750—1910 - Using Chocolate|publisher=Field Museum|accessdate=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When new machines were produced, people began experiencing and consuming chocolate worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/Chocolate/history_contemp6.html|title=Chocolate: A Contemporary Confection 1910—Today - Today's Global Treat|publisher=Field Museum|accessdate=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

[[File:Salmiakki chocolate.jpg|thumb|right|A half beat of milk chocolate with [[salmiak]] filling by [[Fazer]]]]

Several types of chocolate can be distinguished. Pure, unsweetened chocolate contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of [[sweet chocolate]], combining chocolate with sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. European rules specify a minimum of 25% total dry cocoa solids for milk chocolate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0036:EN:NOT|title=Directive 2000/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 June 2000 relating to cocoa and chocolate products intended for human consumption|publisher=[[Publications Office of the European Union]]|accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;White chocolate&quot; contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids. Chocolate contains [[alkaloid]]s such as [[theobromine]] and [[phenethylamine]], which have some physiological effects in humans, but the presence of theobromine renders it toxic to some animals, such as dogs and cats.&lt;ref name=&quot;dogs&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|first=Janet Tobiassen|last=Crosby|url=http://vetmedicine.about.com/cs/nutritiondogs/a/chocolatetoxici.htm|work=Veterinary Q &amp; A |title=Chocolate Toxicity|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=20 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been linked to serotonin levels in the brain. [[Dark chocolate]] has been promoted {{Who|date=April 2009}} for unproven health benefits, as it seems to possess substantial amount of [[antioxidant]]s that reduce the formation of [[free radical]]s.

White chocolate is formed from a mixture of sugar, cocoa butter and milk solids. Although its texture is similar to milk and dark chocolate, it does not contain any cocoa solids. Because of this, many countries do not consider white chocolate as chocolate at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr021004.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080321150727/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr021004.html|archivedate=2008-03-21|title=US Federal Register – White Chocolate; Establishment of a Standard of Identity|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=1 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although first introduced by [[Hebert Candy Mansion|Hebert Candies]] in 1955, [[Mars, Incorporated]] was the first to produce white chocolate within the United States. Because it does not contain any cocoa solids, white chocolate does not contain any theobromine, meaning it can be consumed by animals.

Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cacao mixture. The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] calls this &quot;sweet chocolate&quot;, and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa&quot;/&gt; Dark chocolate, with its high cocoa content, is a rich source of [[epicatechin]] and [[gallic acid]], which are thought to possess cardioprotective properties. Dark chocolate has also been said to reduce [[#Health benefits|the possibility of a heart attack]] when consumed regularly in small amounts.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Emma|last=Ross|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/08/30/health/main639325.shtml|title=Dark Chocolate Could Help Hearts
|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=29 May 2008 | date=30 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semisweet chocolate is a dark chocolate with a low sugar content. Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third), more cocoa butter, vanilla and sometimes [[lecithin]] have been added. It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking.

Unsweetened chocolate is pure [[chocolate liquor]], also known as bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor.

Raw chocolate, often referred to as raw cacao, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cacao.  Because the act of processing results in the loss of certain vitamins and minerals (such as magnesium), some consider raw cacao to be a more nutritious form of chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=hEkOVtE1SCIC&amp;pg=PT95&amp;dq=raw+cacao&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3S6fTaqsDOjYiALH7vT8Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=raw%20cacao&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people who purchase chocolate off the store shelf can be disappointed when they see whitish spots on the dark chocolate part. This is called [[chocolate bloom]] and is not an indication of chocolate gone bad. Instead, this is just an indication that sugar and/or fat has separated due to poor storage.

Despite some disagreement in the [[European Union|EU]] about the definition,{{Clarify|date=December 2008}} chocolate is any product made primarily of cocoa solids and cocoa butter.

Production costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solid content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat. Cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called &quot;chocolate&quot;, due to the risk of lower demand for their crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;pantograph&quot; /&gt; The sequencing in 2010 of genome of the cacao tree may allow yields to be improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chocolate industry avoids collapse as genome published|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11747616|accessdate=15 November 2010|newspaper=BBC|date=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cacao varieties===
Cacao trees are small, understory trees that need rich, well-drained soils. They naturally grow within 20 degrees of either side of the equator because they need about 2000 millimeters of rainfall a year, and temperatures in the range of 21 to 32°C. Cacao trees cannot tolerate a temperature lower than 15°C (59°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xocoatl.org/tree.htm|title=All About Chocolate: The Cacao Tree|publisher=Xocoatl|accessdate=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three main varieties of [[cacao bean]]s used in chocolate are [[criollo (cocoa bean)|criollo]], forastero, and trinitario.

Representing only five percent of all cocoa beans grown,&lt;ref name=&quot;ww&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|first=Kristine|last=Kowalchuk|url=http://www.ama.ab.ca/cps/rde/xchg/ama/web/membership_WWarticle-Feb08-UpFront-10192.htm|title=Cuckoo for Cocoa|publisher=[[Westworld Alberta]]|accessdate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; criollo is the rarest and most expensive cocoa on the market, and is native to Central America, the [[Caribbean islands]] and the northern tier of South American states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metaefficient.com/food-and-drink/criollo-chocolate-efficient-food-of-the-gods.html|title=Criollo Chocolate: Efficient Food of the Gods|publisher=MetaEfficient|accessdate=17 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some dispute about the genetic purity of cocoas sold today as criollo, as most populations have been exposed to the genetic influence of other varieties. Criollos are particularly difficult to grow, as they are vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and produce low yields of cocoa per tree. The flavor of criollo is described as delicate yet complex, low in classic chocolate flavor, but rich in &quot;secondary&quot; notes of long duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sensationalchocolates.com/ingredients.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080328013647/http://www.sensationalchocolates.com/ingredients.html|archivedate=2008-03-28|title=Sensational Chocolates: Discover the Intense Robust flavor of 100% &quot;Grand Cru&quot; Chocolate|publisher=Sensational Chocolates|accessdate=17 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly grown bean is forastero,&lt;ref name=&quot;ww&quot; /&gt; a large group of wild and cultivated cacaos, most likely native to the [[Amazon basin]]. The African cocoa crop is entirely of the forastero variety. They are significantly hardier and of higher yield than criollo. The source of most chocolate marketed,&lt;ref name=&quot;ww&quot; /&gt; forastero cocoas are typically strong in classic &quot;chocolate&quot; flavor, but have a short duration and are unsupported by secondary flavors, producing &quot;quite bland&quot; chocolate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ww&quot; /&gt;

Trinitario is a natural hybrid of criollo and forastero. Trinitario originated in [[Trinidad]] after an introduction of forastero to the local criollo crop. Nearly all cacao produced over the past five decades is of the forastero or lower-grade trinitario varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icco.org/questions/varieties.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060218083848/http://www.icco.org/questions/varieties.htm |archivedate=18 February 2006 |title=What are the varieties of cocoa? |date=21 July 1998 |accessdate=27 June 2006 |publisher=International Cocoa Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Processing {{Anchor|Harvesting|Refining|Processing|Chocolate liquor}}===
[[File:Making Chocolate in Oaxaca.ogg|thumb|Video of cacao beans being ground and mixed with other ingredients to make chocolate at a [[Mayordomo]] store in [[Oaxaca de Juarez|Oaxaca]], Mexico]]
[[Cacao pod]]s are harvested by cutting the pods from the tree using a [[machete]], or by knocking them off the tree using a stick. The beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins to [[fermentation (food)|ferment]]. The fermentation process is what gives the beans their familiar chocolate taste. It is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or there will be insufficient sugars in the white pulp for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days.&lt;ref name=&quot;beans&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xocoatl.org/harvest.htm|title=Harvesting the seeds|publisher=Xocoatl|accessdate=20 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility. The beans are cleaned (removing twigs, stones, and other debris), [[dry roasting|roasted]], and graded. Next, the shells are removed to extract the nib. Finally, the nibs are ground and liquefied, resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form: [[chocolate liquor]]. The liquor can be further processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.&lt;ref name=&quot;tree&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cocoatree.org/frombeantobar/atthechocolatefactory.asp|title=At the chocolate factory|publisher=The Cocoa Tree|accessdate=20 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blending===
{{Main|Types of chocolate}}
Chocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couvertures. The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate (in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first), are as follows:
[[File:Chocolate fountain.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Chocolate is made with high levels of cocoa butter, allowing it to flow gently over a [[chocolate fountain]] to serve as [[Chocolate fondue|dessert fondue]].]]
* Dark chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and (sometimes) vanilla
* Milk chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla
* White chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla

Usually, an [[emulsifying agent]], such as [[soy lecithin]], is added, though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain [[Genetically modified organism|GMO]]-free, sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using [[Polyglycerol polyricinoleate|PGPR]], an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same [[mouthfeel]].

The texture is also heavily influenced by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus have a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.

Different manufacturers develop their own &quot;signature&quot; blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used.  The finest, plain dark chocolate couvertures contain at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white chocolate couvertures contain only about 35% cocoa.

Producers of high quality, small batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad quality chocolate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ww&quot;/&gt; Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than cocoa butter. Vegetable oils and [[artificial flavor|artificial]] [[vanilla]] flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans.&lt;ref name=&quot;ww&quot;/&gt;

In 2007, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include [[The Hershey Company|Hershey]], [[Nestlé]], and [[Archer Daniels Midland]], [[lobbying|lobbied]] the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute [[partially hydrogenated vegetable oils]] for cocoa butter, in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Bragg | first = Lynn | title = Letter to CMA from President (pdf) |year=2007 | url = http://www.chocolateusa.org/pdfs/CMA-stakeholder.pdf | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070604203647/http://www.chocolateusa.org/pdfs/CMA-stakeholder.pdf | archivedate = 2007-06-04 | accessdate = 8 June 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) does not allow a product to be referred to as &quot;chocolate&quot; if the product contains any of these ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/07p0085/07p-0085.htm|title=Adopt Regulations of General Applicability to all Food Standards that would Permit, within Stated Boundaries, Deviations from the Requirements of the Individual Food Standards of Identity|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.typetive.com/blogimages/07p-0085AppendixC.pdf|title = 2007P-0085 Appendix C Changes Allowed to Modernize Food Standards While Retaining The Basic Nature and Essential Characteristics of Standardized Food|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=9 June 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{-}}

===Conching===
{{Main|Conching}}
[[File:Chocolate melanger.jpg|thumb|Chocolate melanger mixing raw ingredients]]
The penultimate process is called ''conching''. A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate prior to conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72&amp;nbsp;hours, lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to approximately {{convert|45|–|50|C|F}} until final processing.&lt;ref name=&quot;conch&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|first=Stephanie|last=Zonis|url=http://www.sallys-place.com/food/columns/zonis/conching.htm|title=Conching: Crucial Step in Chocolate’s Flavor and Texture?
|publisher=Sally's Place|accessdate=20 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tempering===
The final process is called ''[[temper]]ing''. Uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size, some or all large enough to be clearly seen with the naked eye. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken.&lt;ref name=&quot;temp&quot;/&gt; The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the result of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.

The fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms ([[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphous crystallization]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;temp&quot;/&gt; The primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present. The six different crystal forms have different properties.

[[File:Chocolate02.jpg|thumb|Molten chocolate and a piece of a chocolate bar]]
Making chocolate considered &quot;good&quot; is about forming as many type V crystals as possible. This provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals, so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time. To accomplish this, the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization.

Generally, the chocolate is first heated to {{convert|45|°C|°F|abbr=on}} to melt all six forms of crystals.&lt;ref name=
&quot;temp&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|first=Elizabeth|last=LaBau|url=http://candy.about.com/od/candybasics/ht/temperchoc.htm|title=How To Temper Chocolate|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=20 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, the chocolate is cooled to about {{convert|27|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, which will allow crystal types IV and V to form. At this temperature, the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal &quot;seeds&quot; which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate. The chocolate is then heated to about {{convert|31|°C|°F|abbr=on}} to eliminate any type IV crystals, leaving just type V. After this point, any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated. However, there are other methods of chocolate tempering used. The most common variant is introducing already tempered, solid &quot;seed&quot; chocolate. The temper of chocolate can be measured with a [[chocolate temper meter]] to ensure accuracy and consistency. A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.

Two classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:
* Working the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal &quot;seeds&quot;; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.
* Stirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to &quot;inoculate&quot; the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to &quot;seed&quot; the molten chocolate).

Chocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate, particularly for large volume applications.

===Storage===
Chocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between {{convert|15|and|17|C|F}}, with a relative humidity of less than 50%. Chocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper. Various types of &quot;[[Chocolate bloom|blooming]]&quot; effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly. If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Moving chocolate from one temperature extreme to another, such as from a refrigerator on a hot day, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is perfectly safe for consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| publisher=[[Ghirardelli]]| title=Tips for Chocolate Care | url=http://www.ghirardelli.com/chocopedia/tips.aspx | accessdate=16 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Teresa|last=Miller|url=http://www.cals.wisc.edu/media/news/01_97/milkfat_chocolate.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070609144511/http://www.cals.wisc.edu/media/news/01_97/milkfat_chocolate.html|archivedate=2007-06-09|title=Milkfat Fractions Help Beat Blooming Chocolate|publisher=College of Agricultural Life and Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison|accessdate=16 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cocoabella.com/chocolates02.php|publisher=CocoaBella|title=How to Store Chocolate|accessdate=16 April 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070208160345/http://www.cocoabella.com/chocolates02.php |archivedate = February 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential health effects==
{{Main|Health effects of chocolate}}
Even though chocolate is regularly eaten for [[Epicureanism|pleasure]], there are potentially a lot of health effects, both negative and positive. [[Cocoa bean|Cocoa]] or [[dark chocolate]] may positively affect the [[circulatory system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dark&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|first=Daniel J.|last=DeNoon|url=http://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20030827/dark-chocolate-is-healthy-chocolate|title=Dark Chocolate Is Healthy Chocolate|publisher=[[WebMD]]|accessdate=20 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible effects under [[basic research]] include [[anticancer]], [[nootropic|brain stimulator]], [[cough medicine|cough preventor]] and [[antidiarrhoeal]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Marjorie|last=Ingall|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/12/20/health.chocolate/|title=Chocolate can do good things for your heart, skin and brain|publisher=[[CNN|CNN Health]]|accessdate=20 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[aphrodisiac]] effect is yet unproven.

According to research, limited amounts of dark chocolate appear to help prevent heart disease. The oxidation of LDL cholesterol is considered a major factor in the promotion of coronary disease. When this waxy substance oxidizes, it tends to stick to artery walls, increasing the risk of a heart attack or stroke. Research has shown the polyphenols in chocolate inhibit oxidation of LDL cholesterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-robbins/chocolates-startling-heal_b_825978.html|title=Chocolate's Startling Health Benefits|author=John Robbins|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the unconstrained consumption of large quantities of any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity, is thought to increase the risk of [[obesity]]. Raw chocolate is high in [[cocoa butter]], a fat which is removed during chocolate refining, then added back in in varying proportions during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers may add other fats, [[sugar]]s, and [[milk]] as well, all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate.

Chocolate absorbs lead from the environment during production, and there is a slight concern of mild [[lead poisoning]] for some types of chocolate. The average lead concentration of cocoa beans was a very low ≤ 0.5&amp;nbsp;ng/g, one of the lowest reported values for a natural food. Lead concentration of chocolate was as high as 70&amp;nbsp;ng/g for chocolate products and 230&amp;nbsp;ng/g for manufactured cocoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rankin|first=Charley W.|coauthors=Jerome O.

A [[BBC]] report indicated that melting chocolate in one's mouth produced an increase in brain activity and [[heart rate]] that was more intense than that associated with passionate [[kissing]], and also lasted four times as long after the activity had ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCchocokiss&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

In later research, chocolate has been linked with multiple health benefits and liabilities. Research on elderly people showed chocolate might cause [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chocolate consumption and bone density in older women|url=http://www.ajcn.org/content/87/1/175.abstract?sid=8776dd95-b0a2-4299-835f-98ed2561a48c}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more research has shown that it will boost [[cognitive abilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intake of Flavonoid-Rich Wine, Tea, and Chocolate by Elderly Men and Women Is Associated with Better Cognitive Test Performance|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/139/1/120.abstract?sid=8776dd95-b0a2-4299-835f-98ed2561a48c}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, dark chocolate and cocoa butter have been linked with multiple positive effects. Scientific evidence has suggested dark chocolate can help reduce the risk of [[cardiovascular]] problems &lt;ref name=&quot;jn.nutrition.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Blood Pressure Is Reduced and Insulin Sensitivity Increased in Glucose-Intolerant, Hypertensive Subjects after 15 Days of Consuming High-Polyphenol Dark Chocolate|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/138/9/1671.abstract?sid=8776dd95-b0a2-4299-835f-98ed2561a48c}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also reduce [[blood pressure]] in both overweight and normal adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;jn.nutrition.org&quot;/&gt; Finally, studies have shown dark chocolate can lower [[cholesterol]] levels in adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daily Consumption of a Dark Chocolate Containing Flavanols and Added Sterol Esters Affects Cardiovascular Risk Factors in a Normotensive Population with Elevated Cholesterol|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/138/4/725.abstract?sid=8776dd95-b0a2-4299-835f-98ed2561a48c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labelling==
Some manufacturers provide the percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of &quot;cocoa&quot; or &quot;cacao&quot;. It should be noted that this refers to the combined percentage of both [[cocoa solids]] and [[cocoa butter]] in the bar, not just the percentage of [[cocoa solids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Molly|last=Stevens|url=http://www.taunton.com/finecooking/articles/sorting-out-chocolate.aspx|title=Sorting Out Chocolate|publisher=[[Taunton Press|Taunton]]|accessdate=17 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, some large chocolate manufacturers lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper [[hydrogenated vegetable oil]] in place of [[cocoa butter]] to be sold as &quot;chocolate&quot;. In June 2007, as a response to consumer concern after the proposed change, the FDA reiterated &quot;Cacao fat, as one of the signature characteristics of the product, will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/consumer/updates/foodstandards061807.html|title=FDA's Standards for High Quality Foods|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=17 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturers==
{{Main|List of bean-to-bar chocolate manufacturers}}

Many chocolate manufacturers have created products from [[chocolate bar]]s to [[fudge]], hoping to attract more consumers with each creation. Both The Hershey Company and Mars have become the largest manufacturers in the world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Other significant players include [[Nestlé]], [[Kraft Foods]]  and [[Lindt]].

[[The Hershey Company]], known for their [[Hershey bar]], [[Hershey's Kisses]] and [[Reese's Peanut Butter Cups]], is the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;paul&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|first=Andrew|last=Duncan|url=http://www.booksense.com/readup/news/archive/0919hershey.jsp|title=Hershey Kisses Potential Buyers Goodbye|publisher=[[Book Sense]]|accessdate=30 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mars, Incorporated]], one of the largest privately owned U.S. corporations, is a worldwide manufacturer of confectionery and other food products, with US$21&amp;nbsp;billion in annual sales in 2006. Mars is known for [[Mars Bar]], [[Milky Way bar|Milky Way]], [[M&amp;M's]] , [[Twix]] and [[Snickers]], as well as other confectionery items, such [[Skittles (confectionery)|Skittles]].

Food conglomerates Nestlé SA and Kraft Foods both have chocolate brands. [[Nestlé]] acquired [[Rowntree's]] in 1988 and now market chocolates under their own brand, including ''[[Smarties]]'' and ''[[Kit Kat]]''; [[Kraft Foods]] through its 1990 acquisition of Jacobs Suchard, now own ''[[Milka]]'' and ''Suchard''. In February 2010, Kraft also acquired British-based [[Cadbury plc]], the world's largest confectionery manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=a5dPcReemm4w&amp;refer=uk|title=U.K. Stocks Fluctuate as Mining Shares Rally; Cadbury Declines|last=Jones|first=Sarah|date=9 April 2009|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=14 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cadbury is well known for its [[Cadbury Dairy Milk|''Dairy Milk'' range]] and ''[[Cadbury Creme Egg|Creme Egg]]''; [[J.

==In popular culture==
[[File:White-Box-of-Chocolates.jpg|thumb|250px|A box of assorted chocolates, often given as a gift.]]

===Holidays===
Chocolate is one of the most popular holiday gifts. On [[Valentine's Day]], a box of chocolates is traditional, usually presented with [[flower]]s and a [[greeting card]]. It may be gifted on other holidays, including [[Christmas]], [[Easter]], [[Thanksgiving]], and [[birthday]]s. At Easter, chocolate eggs are traditional. This is a confectionery made primarily of chocolate, and can either be solid, hollow, or filled with other sweets or fondant.

===Books and film===
Chocolate has been the center of several successful book and film adaptations. In 1964, [[Roald Dahl]] published a children's novel titled ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''. The novel centers on a poor boy named Charlie Bucket who takes a tour through the greatest chocolate factory in the world, owned by [[Willy Wonka]]. Two film adaptations of the novel were produced. The first was ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'', a 1971 film which later became a [[cult classic]]. Thirty-four years later, a second film adaptation was produced, titled ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''. The 2005 film was very well received by critics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/charlie_and_the_chocolate_factory/|title=''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' at Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=29 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the highest grossing films that year, earning over US$470,000,000 worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;box&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=charliechocolate.htm|title=Charlie and the Chocolate Factory at Box Office Mojo|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=29 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was also recognized at the [[78th Academy Awards]], where it was nominated for [[Academy Award for Costume Design#2000s|Best Costume Design]] for Gabriella Pesucci.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/78academyawards/nomswins.html|title=Nominees and Winners - 78th Annual Academy Awards|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=7 June 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080408052925/http://www.oscars.org/78academyawards/nomswins.html |archivedate = April 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Like Water for Chocolate]]'' (''Como agua para chocolate''), a 1989 love story by novelist [[Laura Esquivel]], was adapted to film in 1992. The plot incorporates [[magical realism]] with Mexican cuisine, and the title is a [[double entendre]] in its native language, referring both to a recipe for [[hot chocolate]] and to an idiom that is a metaphor for sexual arousal. The film earned 11 [[Ariel Award]]s from the [[Academia Mexicana de Artes y Ciencias Cinematográficas]], including Best Picture.

''[[Chocolat]]'', a 1999 [[novel]] by [[Joanne Harris]], tells the story of Vianne Rocher, a young mother, whose confections change the lives of the townspeople. The 2000 film adaptation, ''[[Chocolat (2000 film)|Chocolat]]'', also proved successful, grossing over US$150,000,000 worldwide,&lt;ref name=&quot;mojo&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=chocolat.htm|title=''Chocolat'' at Box Office Mojo|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=29 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and receiving [[Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe]] nominations for [[Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], and Best Original Score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearch?action=searchLink&amp;displayType=3&amp;BSFilmID=38520|title=''Chocolat'' at the Academy Awards database|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/film/23848|title=''Chocolat'' at the Golden Globes database|publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|accessdate=30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cornet''' is a [[brass instrument]] very similar to the [[trumpet]], distinguished by its conical [[Bore (wind instruments)|bore]], compact shape, and mellower tone quality.  The most common cornet is a [[transposing instrument]] in B{{music|flat}}. It is not related to the renaissance and early baroque [[cornett]] or [[cornetto (musical instrument)|cornetto]].

==History==
The cornet was originally derived from the [[post horn]] around 1820 in France. Among the first manufacturers of modern cornets were Parisian Jean Aste' in 1928.{{dubious|Jean_Aste|date=March 2011}} Cornets first appear as separate instrumental parts in 19th century French compositions.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB2&quot;&gt;Encyclopaedia Britanica, Micropedia, Volume III, William Benton, Chicago Illinois, 1974, P.156&lt;/ref&gt; 

This instrument could not have been developed without the improvement of [[piston valve]]s by [[Heinrich Stölzel]] and [[Friedrich Blühmel]]. In the early 19th century, these two instrument makers almost simultaneously invented the modern valves, as still used today. They jointly applied for a patent and were granted this for a period of ten years. The first notable virtuoso player was [[Jean-Baptiste Arban]], who studied the cornet extensively and published ''La grande méthode complète de cornet à piston et de saxhorn'', commonly referred to as the ''[[Arban method]]'', in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Method for Trumpet, Jean-Baptiste Arban, Carl Fisher &amp; Co, NY, NY 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the early 20th century, the trumpet and cornet coexisted in musical ensembles. In symphonic repertoire one will often find separate parts for both trumpet and cornet. As several instrument builders made improvements to both instruments, they started to look and sound more alike. The modern day cornet is used in [[Brass band (British style)|brass band]]s, [[concert band]]s, and in specific [[Orchestra|symphonic]] repertoire that requires a more mellow sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;American&quot;&gt;The American History and Encyclopedia of Music, W.C. Hunbbard Editor, &quot;Musical Instruments&quot;, George W. Andrews, Irving Square, NY, NY, 1924&lt;/ref&gt;

The name cornet is derived from [[wikt:corne|corne]], meaning ''horn'', itself from Latin cornus. While not musically related, instruments of the Zink family (which includes serpents) are named &quot;cornetto-    &quot; with a tonal or pitch related Latin word following the hyphen to describe the particular varriant. The 11th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica referred to serpents as &quot;old wooden cornets&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1&quot;&gt;A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Knowledge, Hugh Chisolm, editor, Encyclopaedia Britanica, NY, NY, 1911, P.675&lt;/ref&gt; The lingual ancestor of these, which is a predecessor of the [[post horn]] from which the cornet evolved, is the Roman/Etruscan [[cornu]] (or simply &quot;horn&quot;) which was utilized in a bugle like capacity to signal orders on the battlefield in Roman times.&lt;ref name=&quot;American&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia page [[cornu]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The instrument was once sometimes referred to as a cornopean, referencing the earliest cornets with the [[Stölzel valve system]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Relationship to trumpet==
The cornet was invented by adding valves to the [[post horn]] in 1814. The valves allowed for melodic playing throughout the register of the cornet. Trumpets were slower to adopt the new valve technology, so for the next 100 years or more, composers often wrote separate parts for trumpet and cornet. The trumpet would play [[fanfare]]-like passages, while the cornet played more melodic passages. The modern trumpet has valves that allow it to play the same notes and fingerings as the cornet.&lt;ref&gt;The Technique of Orchestration, Kent Wheeler Kennan, Prentice Hall, NY, NY 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornets and trumpets made in a given [[Key (music)|key]] (usually the key of B{{music|flat}}) play at the same pitch, and the technique for playing the instruments is nearly identical.  However, cornets and trumpets are not entirely interchangeable, as they differ in [[timbre]]. Also available, but usually seen only in the brass band, is an E{{music|flat}} soprano model, pitched a fourth above the standard B{{music|flat}}. There is usually only one E{{music|flat}} cornet in a band, adding an extreme high register to the brass band sound. It can be effective in cutting through even the loudest [[tutti]] climax.&lt;ref&gt;An Illustrated Catalogue of the [[Boston Musical Instrument Company|Boston Musical Instrument Manufactury]], Press of Hollis and Gunn, Boston, Massachusetts, 1869, pp. 4-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the trumpet, which has a cylindrical bore up until the bell section, the tubing of the cornet has a mostly conical bore, starting very narrow at the [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]] and gradually widening towards the bell. Cornets following the 1913 patent of [[E.A. Couturier]] can have a continuously conical bore. The conical bore of the cornet is primarily responsible for its characteristic warm, mellow tone, which can be distinguished from the more penetrating sound of the trumpet. The conical bore of the cornet also makes it more agile than the trumpet when playing fast passages, but correct pitching is often less assured.&lt;ref name=&quot;American&quot;/&gt; The cornet is often preferred for young beginners as it is easier to hold, with its centre of gravity much closer to the player. 

The cornet [[mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]] has a shorter and narrower shank than a trumpet mouthpiece, in order to fit the cornet's smaller mouthpiece receiver. The cup size is often deeper than that of a trumpet mouthpiece.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Cornet2.png|thumb|250px|A drawing of a cornet from Webster's Dictionary 1911.]]
The cornet in the Webster's Dictionary illustration is a short model traditional cornet, also known as a ''&quot;Shepherd's crook&quot;'' shaped model. These are most often large–bore instruments with a rich mellow sound. There is also a long-model cornet, usually with a smaller bore and a brighter sound, which is closer to a trumpet in appearance. The Shepherd's Crook model is preferred by cornet traditionalists. The long-model cornet is generally used in concert bands in the United States, but has found little following in British-style brass and concert bands.&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement for the &quot;King&quot; Long Model Cornet, [[H.N. White Company]], Cleveland, Ohio, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement for the &quot;King&quot; Large Bore Model Cornet, [[H.N. White Company]], Cleveland, Ohio, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing technique==
Like the trumpet and all other modern brass wind instruments, the cornet makes a sound when the player vibrates (&quot;buzzes&quot;) the lips in the mouthpiece, creating a vibrating column of air in the tubing. The [[frequency]] of the air column's vibration can be modified by changing the lip aperture or &quot;[[embouchure]]&quot;. In addition, the column of air can be lengthened by engaging one or more valves, thus lowering the pitch.

Without valves, the player could only produce a [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] of notes like those played by the [[Bugle (instrument)|bugle]] and other &quot;natural&quot; brass instruments. These notes are far apart for most of the instrument's range, making [[diatonic and chromatic]] playing impossible except in the extreme high register. The valves change the length of the vibrating column and provide the cornet with the ability to play chromatically.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1&quot;/&gt;

==Ensembles with cornets==
===Brass band (British style)===
[[Brass band (British style)|British style brass band]] ensembles consist completely of brass instruments (except for the [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] section). The cornet is the leading melodic instrument in this ensemble and trumpets are never used. The ensemble consists of about thirty musicians, including nine B{{music|flat}} cornets and one E{{music|flat}} cornet ([[soprano cornet]]) in the higher registers. In England, companies such as [[Besson (company)|Besson]] and [[Boosey and Hawkes]] specialized in these instruments. In America, 19th century manufacturers such as Graves and Company, Hall and Quinby, E.G. Wright and the [[Boston Musical Instrument Company|Boston Musical Instrument Manufactury]] built lines of instruments for this format of ensmble.

===Concert band===
The cornet also features in the British-style [[concert band]], unlike the American concert band or wind band, where it is replaced by the [[trumpet]]. This slight difference in instrumentation derives from the British concert band's heritage in [[military band]]s, where the highest brass instrument is always the cornet. There are usually four to six B{{music|flat}} cornets present in a concert band, but no E{{music|flat}} instrument, as this role is taken by the [[E-flat clarinet|E{{music|flat}} clarinet]].

[[File:Cornet.jpg|thumb|left|Cornet that looks like a [[French horn]]]]

===Fanfare orkest===
Fanfare orkesten (&quot;fanfare orchestras&quot;), only found in the Netherlands, Belgium, Northern France and Lithuania use the complete [[saxhorn]] family of instruments. The standard instrumentation includes both the cornet and the trumpet; however, in recent decades, the cornet has largely been replaced by the trumpet.

===Jazz ensemble===
In old style [[jazz band]]s, the cornet was preferred to the trumpet, but from the swing era onwards it has been largely replaced by the trumpet, although it has never passed completely out of use. The cornet is now rarely found in [[big bands]] mainly because of its limited volume and less piercing tone in comparison to the trumpet. A growing taste for louder and more aggressive sounding instruments has been the chief cause of this trend, especially since the advent of [[bebop]] in the post [[World War II]] era.

The legendary jazz pioneer [[Buddy Bolden]] played the cornet, and [[Louis Armstrong]] started off on the cornet but later switched to the trumpet. Cornetists such as [[Bubber Miley]] and [[Rex Stewart]] contributed substantially to the [[Duke Ellington Orchestra]]'s early sound. Other influential jazz cornetists include [[King Oliver]], [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[Ruby Braff]] and [[Nat Adderley]]. Notable performances on cornet by players generally associated with the trumpet include [[Freddie Hubbard]]'s on ''[[Empyrean Isles]]'' by [[Herbie Hancock]] and [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]]'s on ''[[The Shape of Jazz to Come]]'' by [[Ornette Coleman]].

'''Cotton Mather''', [[Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society#Fellows|FRS]] (February 12, 1663 &amp;ndash; February 13, 1728; A.B. 1678, [[Harvard University|Harvard College]]; A.M. 1681, honorary doctorate 1710, [[University of Glasgow]]) was a socially and politically influential [[History of New England|New England]] [[Puritan]] minister, prolific author and [[pamphleteer]]; he is often remembered for his role in the [[Salem witch trials]]. He was the son of [[Increase Mather]], and grandson of both [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]] and [[Richard Mather]], all also prominent Puritan ministers.

==Biography==
[[Image:Mather1.gif|thumb|right|100px|Richard Mather]]
[[Image:JohnCotton.jpg|right|100px|thumb|John Cotton (1585–1652)]]

Mather was named after his maternal grandfather, John Cotton. He attended [[Boston Latin School]], where his name was posthumously added to its [[Boston_Latin_School#Hall_of_Fame|Hall of Fame]], and graduated from Harvard in 1678 at age 16. After completing his post-graduate work, he joined his father as assistant pastor of Boston's original [[Second Church, Boston|North Church]].&lt;ref&gt;(not to be confused with the Anglican/Episcopal [[Old North Church]])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1685 Mather assumed full responsibilities as pastor at the Church.

Cotton Mather wrote more than 450 books and pamphlets, and his ubiquitous literary works made him one of the most influential religious leaders in America. Mather set the moral tone in the colonies, and sounded the call for second- and third-generation Puritans, whose parents had left [[England]] for the [[New England]] colonies of [[North America]], to return to the [[Theology|theological]] roots of [[Puritan]]ism.

The most important of these, ''[[Magnalia Christi Americana]]'' (1702), comprises seven distinct books, many of which depict biographical and historical narratives to which later American writers, such as [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Elizabeth Drew Stoddard]], and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], would look in describing the cultural significance of New England for later generations after the American Revolution. Mather's text thus is one of the more important documents in American history, because it reflects a particular tradition of seeing and understanding the significance of place. Mather, as a Puritan thinker and social conservative, drew on the figurative language of the Bible to speak to contemporary audiences. In particular, Mather's review of the American experiment sought to explain signs of his time and the types of individuals drawn to the colonies as predicting the success of the venture. From his religious training, Mather viewed the importance of texts for elaborating meaning and for bridging different moments of history—linking, for instance, the Biblical stories of Noah and Abraham with the arrival of such eminent leaders as [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]]; [[John Winthrop]]; and his own father, Increase Mather.

The struggles of first- through third-generation Puritans, both intellectual and physical, thus became elevated in the American way of thinking about its appointed place among other nations. The unease and self-deception that characterized that period of colonial history would be revisited in many forms at political and social moments of crisis (such as the Salem witch trials, which coincided with frontier warfare and economic competition among Indians and French and other European settlers) and during lengthy periods of cultural definition (such as the American Renaissance of the late 18th- and early 19th-century literary, visual, and architectural movements, which sought to capitalize on unique American identities). 

Highly influential because of his prolific writing, Mather was a force to be reckoned with in secular, as well as in spiritual, matters. After the fall of [[James II of England]], in 1688, Mather was among the leaders of a successful revolt against James's governor of the consolidated [[Dominion of New England]], Sir [[Edmund Andros]].

Mather also influenced early American science. In 1716, because of observations of corn varieties, he conducted one of the first recorded experiments with plant [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]]. This observation was memorialized in a letter to a friend:

:My friend planted a row of Indian corn that was colored red and blue; the rest of the field being planted with yellow, which is the most usual color. To the windward side this red and blue so infected three or four rows as to communicate the same color unto them; and part of ye fifth and some of ye sixth. But to the leeward side, no less than seven or eight rows had ye same color communicated unto them; and some small impressions were made on those that were yet further off.

Of Mather's three wives and 15 children, only his last wife and two children survived him. Mather was buried on [[Copp's Hill]], near [[Old North Church]].

== Writing ==
Cotton Mather was not known for writing in a neutral, unbiased perspective. Many, if not all, of his writings had bits and pieces of his own personal life in them or were written for personal reasons. According to literary historian Sacvan Bercovitch:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Few puritans more loudly decried the bosom serpent of egotism than did Cotton Mather; none more clearly exemplified it. Explicitly or implicitly, he projects himself everywhere in his writings. In the most direct compensatory sense, he does so by using literature as a means of personal redress. He tells us that he composed his discussions of the family to bless his own, his essays on the riches of Christ to repay his benefactors, his tracts on morality to convert his enemies, his funeral discourses to console himself for the loss of a child, wife, or friend&quot; (106).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Boyle's influence on Mather ===
A huge influence throughout Mather’s career was [[Robert Boyle]]. While coming to terms with who he was,  Mather read Robert Boyle’s book “The Usefulness of Experimental Natural Philosophy.” Mather read Boyle’s work closely throughout the 1680s and his early works on science and religion borrowed greatly from it. He even uses almost identical language to Boyle.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauf, Robert. The Mathers: Three Generations of Puritan Intellectuals, 1596-1728. Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mather's relationship with his father and the aftereffects in Mather's Works ===
Cotton Mather's relationship with his well-known father, Increase Mather, was often a strained and difficult one. Increase Mather was a pastor of the Old North Church and led an accomplished life that Cotton was determined to live up to. Despite Cotton Mather's efforts, he never became quite as well known and successful in politics as his father. He did surpass his father's talents as a writer, writing over 400 books. One of the most public displays of their strained relationship appeared during the Salem Witch Trials. Despite the fact that Increase Mather did not support the trials, Cotton Mather documented them (Hovey 531-2).

==Smallpox inoculation controversy==

The practice of smallpox [[inoculation]] (as opposed to the later practice of [[vaccination]]) was developed centuries ago in Africa and Asia. Spreading its reach in seventeenth-century Turkey, inoculation or, rather, variolation involved infecting a person through a cut in the skin with [[exudate]] from a patient with a relatively mild case of smallpox ([[variola]]), in order to bring about a manageable and recoverable infection that will provide later immunity.

By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Royal Society in England was discussing the practice of inoculation, and the smallpox epidemic in 1713 spurred further interest.&lt;ref&gt;Blake 1952, 489-90&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1721, however, that England recorded its first case of inoculation.

===Early New England===
Smallpox was a serious threat in colonial America, most devastatingly to Native Americans, but also to Anglo-American settlers. New England suffered smallpox epidemics in 1677, 1689–90, and 1702.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson and Newman 2002&lt;/ref&gt; It was highly contagious, and mortality could reach as high as 30 percent or more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gronim 2007, 248&quot;&gt;Gronim 2007, 248&lt;/ref&gt;

Boston had been plagued by smallpox outbreaks in 1690 and 1702. During this era, public authorities in Massachusetts dealt with the threat primarily by means of quarantine. Incoming ships were quarantined in Boston harbor, and any smallpox patients in town were held under guard or in a &quot;pesthouse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Blake 1952, 489&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1706 a slave, Onesimus, explained to Cotton Mather how he had been inoculated as a child in [[Africa]]. Mather was fascinated by the idea. By July 1716, Mather had read an endorsement of inoculation by Dr. Emanuel Timonius of Constantinople in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]''.  Mather then declared, in a letter to Dr. [[John Woodward]] of Gresham College in London, that he planned to press Boston's doctors to adopt the practice of inoculation should smallpox reach the colony again.&lt;ref&gt;Blake 1952, 490-91&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1721, a whole generation of young Bostonians was disease-prone and memories of the last epidemic's horrors had by and large disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Winslow 1974, 24-29&lt;/ref&gt; On April 22 of that year, the HMS ''Seahorse'' arrived from the West Indies carrying smallpox on board. Despite attempts to protect the town through quarantine, eight known cases of smallpox appeared in Boston by May 27, and by mid-June, the disease was spreading at an alarming rate. As a new wave of smallpox hit the area and continued to spread, many residents fled to outlying rural settlements. The combination of exodus, quarantine, and outside traders' fears disrupted business in the capital of the Bay Colony for weeks. Guards were stationed at the House of Representatives to keep Bostonians from entering without special permission. The death toll reached 101 in September, and the [[Selectmen]], powerless to stop it, &quot;severely limited the length of time funeral bells could toll.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blake 1952, 495&quot;&gt;Blake 1952, 495&lt;/ref&gt; As one response, legislators delegated a thousand pounds from the treasury to help the people who, under these conditions, could no longer support their families.

On June 6, 1721, Mather sent an abstract of reports on inoculation by Timonius and Jacobus Pylarinus to local physicians, urging them to consult about the matter. He received no response. Next, Mather pleaded his case to Dr. [[Zabdiel Boylston]], who tried the procedure on his only son and two slaves&amp;mdash;one grown and one a boy. All recovered in about a week. Boylston inoculated seven more people by mid-July.

The epidemic peaked in October 1721, with 411 deaths; by February 26, 1722, Boston was, once again, free of smallpox. The total number of cases since April 1721 came to 5,889, with 844 deaths&amp;mdash;more than three quarters of all the deaths in Boston during 1721.&lt;ref&gt;Blake 1952, 496&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Dr. Boylston had inoculated 242 people, with only six resulting in death.

===Inoculation debate===
Boylston and Mather's inoculation crusade &quot;raised a horrid Clamour&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mather, ''Diary,'' 11, 628&lt;/ref&gt; amongst the people of Boston. Both Boylston and Mather were &quot;Object[s] of their Fury; their furious Obloquies and Invectives,&quot; which Mather acknowledges in his diary. Boston's Selectmen, consulting a doctor who claimed that the practice caused many deaths and only spread the infection, forbade Boylston from performing it again.&lt;ref&gt;Blake 1952, 493&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Courant|New England Courant]]'' published writers who opposed the practice. The editorial stance was that the Boston populace feared that inoculation spread, rather than prevented, the disease; however, some historians, notably [[H. W. Brands]], have argued that this position was a result of editor-in-chief [[James Franklin (printer)|James Franklin]]'s ([[Benjamin Franklin]]'s brother) [[contrarian]] positions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/cowpocklge.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Public discourse ranged in tone from organized arguments by tobacconist and medical practitioner John Williams, who posited that &quot;several arguments proving that inoculating the smallpox is not contained in the law of Physick, either natural or divine, and therefore unlawful,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 1721&lt;/ref&gt; to more slanderous attacks, such as those put forth in a pamphlet by Dr. [[William Douglass (physician)|William Douglass]] of Boston entitled ''The Abuses and Scandals of Some Late Pamphlets in Favour of Inoculation of the Small Pox'' (1721), on the qualifications of inoculation's proponents. (Douglass was exceptional at the time for holding a medical degree from Europe.) At the extreme, in November 1721, someone hurled a lighted grenade into Cotton Mather's house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blake 1952, 495&quot;/&gt;

====Medical opposition====

Several opponents of smallpox inoculation, among them John Williams, stated that there were only two laws of physick (medicine): sympathy and antipathy. In his estimation, inoculation was neither a sympathy toward a wound or a disease, or an antipathy toward one, but the creation of one. For this reason, its practice violated the natural laws of medicine, transforming health care practitioners into those who harm rather than heal.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 1721 13&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many colonists, Williams' Puritan beliefs were enmeshed in every aspect of his life, and he used the [[Bible]] to state his case. He quoted [[Matthew 9:12]] when [[Jesus]] said: &quot;It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.&quot;

In contrast, Dr. William Douglass proposed a more [[secular]] argument against inoculation, stressing the importance of reason over passion and urging the public to be pragmatic in their choices. In addition, he demanded that ministers leave the practice of medicine to physicians, and not meddle in areas where they lacked expertise. According to Douglass, smallpox inoculation was &quot;a medical experiment of consequence,&quot; one not to be undertaken lightly. He believed that not all learned individuals were qualified to doctor others, and while ministers took on several roles in the early years of the colony, including that of caring for the sick, they were now expected to stay out of state and civil affairs.

Douglass also felt that inoculation caused more deaths than it prevented. The only reason Cotton Mather had success in it, he said, was because Mather had used it on children, who are naturally more resilient. Douglass vowed to always speak out against &quot;the wickedness of spreading infection.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Douglass 1722, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Speak out he did: &quot;The battle between these two prestigious adversaries [Douglass and Mather] lasted far longer than the epidemic itself, and the literature accompanying the controversy was both vast and venomous.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Van de Wetering 1985, 46&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Douglass grew to accept inoculation, but he stood his ground on the need for professional standards.

====Puritan resistance====

Puritan principles were core to the religious arguments against inoculation. They believed that they were &quot;elected&quot; by God to establish a godly nation in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. As such, the notion of God’s will being evident in their daily life was paramount, and they strove to accept every affliction as proof of God's special interest in their affairs.

God's authority was absolute, and Williams questioned whether the smallpox &quot;is not one of the strange works of God; and whether inoculation of it be not a fighting with the most High.&quot; He also asked his readers if the smallpox epidemic may have been given to them by God as &quot;punishment for sin,&quot; and warned that attempting to shield themselves from God's fury (via inoculation), would only serve to &quot;provoke him more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Williams 1721, 4&lt;/ref&gt; The Puritans found meaning in affliction, and they did not yet know why God was showing them disfavor through smallpox. Not to address their errant ways before attempting a cure could set them back in their &quot;errand.&quot;

Many Puritans believed that creating a wound and inserting poison was doing violence and therefore was antithetical to the healing art. They grappled with adhering to the [[Ten Commandments]], with being proper church members and good caring neighbors. The apparent contradiction between harming or murdering a neighbor through inoculation and the Sixth Commandment--&quot;thou shalt not kill&quot;--seemed insoluble and hence stood as one of thee main objections against the procedure.

Williams maintained that because the subject of inoculation could not be found in the Bible, it was not the will of God, and therefore &quot;unlawful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Williams 1721, 2&lt;/ref&gt; He also explained that inoculation violated [[The Golden Rule]], because if one neighbor voluntarily infected another with disease, he was not doing unto others as he would have done to him. With the Bible as the Puritans’ source for all decision-making, lack of scriptural evidence concerned many, and Williams vocally scorned Rev. Mather for not being able to reference an inoculation edict directly from the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 1721, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inoculation defended====

With the smallpox epidemic catching speed and racking up a staggering death toll, a solution to the crisis was becoming more urgently needed by the day. The use of quarantine and various other efforts, such as balancing the body's [[humors]], did not slow the disease's spread. As news rolled in from town to town and correspondence arrived from overseas, reports of horrific stories of suffering and loss due to smallpox stirred mass panic among the people. &quot;By circa 1700, smallpox had become among the most devastating of epidemic diseases circulating in the Atlantic world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gronim 2007, 248&quot;/&gt;

Cotton Mather strongly challenged the perception that inoculation was against the will of God and argued that the procedure was not outside of Puritan principles. He wrote that &quot;whether a Christian may not employ this Medicine (let the matter of it be what it will) and humbly give Thanks to God’s good Providence in discovering of it to a miserable World; and humbly look up to His Good Providence (as we do in the use of any other Medicine) It may seem strange, that any wise Christian cannot answer it. And how strangely do Men that call themselves Physicians betray their Anatomy, and their Philosophy, as well as their Divinity in their invectives against this Practice?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mather 1721, 25.15&lt;/ref&gt; The Puritan minister began to embrace the sentiment that smallpox was an inevitability for anyone, both the good and the wicked, yet God had provided them with the means to save themselves. Mather reported that, from his view, &quot;none that have used it ever died of the Small Pox, tho at the same time, it were so malignant, that at least half the People died, that were infected With it in the Common way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mather 1721, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of smallpox inoculation was eventually accepted by the general population due to first-hand experiences and personal relationships. Although many were initially wary of the concept, it was because people were able to witness the procedure's consistently positive results, within their own community of ordinary citizens, that it became widely utilized and supported. One important change in the practice after 1721 was regulated quarantine of inoculees.&lt;ref&gt;Van de Wetering 1985, 66, n.55&lt;/ref&gt;

Inoculation visibly and directly aided man's control of the disease, the level of infection, mortality rates and the spreading of the epidemic. Planned inoculation led to better observation of the body's responses and allowed people the ability to time the onset of the pox and control the disease's intensity. For example, by inoculating in the months of milder climate, one had a better chance of fighting the infection and becoming immune instead of the alternative: natural exposure to the disease during harsher weather, when the body's defenses were already challenged.

Additionally, by the 1750s, innovations and experience with inoculation focused on better insertion of pox fluid and preparation of body to withstand the disease. By controlling the point and time of infection, bodies could be conditioned to optimal state before contracting smallpox, therefore providing a better opportunity to fight and achieve immunity. Dependent upon a person's constitution, by adhering to a specific diet or purging, one could physically handle the infection more successfully. It was also discovered that inoculation produced less scarring and physical defects than a common, naturally contracted case.

===The aftermath===

Although Cotton Mather and Dr. Boylston were able to demonstrate the efficacy of the practice, the debate over inoculation would continue even beyond the epidemic of 1721-22. After overcoming considerable difficulty and achieving notable success, Boylston traveled to [[London]] in 1724 where he published his results and was elected to the [[Royal Society]] in 1726.

The responses of the Boston clergymen to the reproaches put forth by the anti-inoculation camp highlighted seminal changes the Puritan church was undergoing at the time. By prescribing recent advances in medicine, the Boston ministers modified the doctrine of theological pathogenesis in an attempt to maintain the old order according to which it was the clergy’s duty and privilege to interpret illnesses and their cures. However, the contradiction of simultaneously upholding tradition and embracing innovations was impossible to resolve and, as a consequence, the clergy continued to lose influence over secular affairs in eighteenth-century New England.

In the end, lives were saved by inoculation, and the epidemic was halted. Even today, the procedure is credited with ending the devastation caused by the early epidemics, and vaccination, in many ways an updated and modernized form of the procedure, continues to be recommended by the [[Centers for Disease Control]] for at-risk populations, such as potential victims of bioterrorism, and research scientists who work with surviving strains of the virus.

==Salem witch trials==

A friend of a number of the judges charged with hearing the [[Salem witch trials]], Mather admitted the use of ''[[spectral evidence]]'', (compare [http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/mather/devil.htm &quot;The Devil in New England&quot;]) but warned that, though it might serve as evidence to begin investigations, it should not be heard in court as evidence to decide a case. Despite this, he later wrote in defense of those conducting the trials, stating:

:&quot;If in the midst of the many Dissatisfaction among us, the publication of these Trials may promote such a pious Thankfulness unto God, for Justice being so far executed among us, I shall Re-joyce that God is Glorified...&quot; '' - [[Wonders of the Invisible World]].''

New Englanders perceived themselves abnormally susceptible to the Devil’s influence in the 17th century. The idea that New Englanders now occupied the Devil’s land established this fear.&lt;ref name=Lovelace16&gt;{{cite book |author= Richard F. Lovelace |title= The American Pietism of Cotton Mather: Origins of American Evangelicalism |publisher= Christian College Consortium |location= Washington D.C |year=1979 |isbn= 0802817505}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}} In their mind it would only be natural for the Devil to fight back against the pious invaders. Cotton Mather shared this general concern; and combined with New England’s lack of piety, Mather feared divine retribution.&lt;ref name=Werking283&gt;{{cite book |author= Richard H. Werking |title= Reformation is our only preservation: Cotton Mather and Salem Witchcraft, |publisher= The William and Mary Quarterly |location= Third Series, Vol. 29, No. 2., |year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|283}} English writers, who shared Mather’s fears, cited evidence of divine actions to restore the flock.&lt;ref name=Werking283/&gt;{{rp|283}}

In 1681 a conference of ministers met to discuss how to rectify the lack of faith. In an effort to combat the lack of piety, Cotton Mather considered it his duty to observe and record illustrious providences. Cotton Mather’s first action related to the Salem Witch Trials was the publication of his 1684 essay ''Illustrious Providences.''&lt;ref name=Werking283/&gt;{{rp|284}} Mather, being an ecclesiastical man, believed in the spiritual side of the world and attempted to prove its existence with stories of sea rescues, strange apparitions and witchcraft. Mather aimed to combat [[materialism]] in New England.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Chadwick Hansen |title= Witchcraft at Salem |publisher= George Braziller, Inc |location= New York |year=1969 |isbn= 0451619471}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}}

Such was the social climate of New England when the Goodwin children received a strange illness. Mather, seeing an opportunity to explore the spiritual world, attempted to treat the children with fasting and prayer.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen&quot;/&gt;{{rp|24}} After treating the children of the Goodwin family, Mather wrote ''Memorable Providences,'' a detailed account of the illness.&lt;ref name=Lovelace16/&gt;{{rp|16}} In January 1692 Abigail Williams and Betty Parris had a similar illness to the Goodwin children; and Mather emerged as an important figure in the Salem Witch trials.&lt;ref name=Lovelace16/&gt;{{rp|16}} Even though Mather never presided in the jury, he exhibited great influence over the witch trials. On May 31, 1692, Mather sent a letter ''Return of the Several Ministers,'' to the trial. This article advised the judges to limit the use of [[Spectral evidence]], and recommended the release of confessed criminals.&lt;ref name=Lovelace16/&gt;{{rp|17}}

''[[Wonders of the Invisible World]],'' describing the Salem Witch Trials, is one of Cotton Mather's best-known books, and the witch trials themselves are what Mather is well known for. One of the main reasons that Mather wrote about the witch trials was that he believed it would &quot;encourage a spiritual awakening in the face of widespread religious complacency&quot; (Hovey 532).

===Mather as a negative influence on the trials===

Critics of Cotton Mather assert that he caused the trials because of his 1688 publication ''Remarkable Providences,'' and attempted to revive the trial with his 1692 book ''[[Wonders of the Invisible World]],'' and in general encouraged witch hunting zeal.&lt;ref name=Werking283/&gt;{{rp|283}} Others have stated, “His own reputation for veracity on the reality of witchcraft prayed, &quot;for a good issue.”&lt;ref name=Bancroft85&gt;{{cite book |author= George Bancroft |title= History of the United States of America, from the discovery of the American continent |publisher= Little, Brown, and company |location= Boston |date=1874-1878 |isbn= 0665614047}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|85}} Charles Upham mentions Mather called accused witch Martha Carrier a rampant hag.&lt;ref name=&quot;upham&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Charles Upham |title= Salem Witchcraft |publisher= Frederick Ungar Publishing Co |location= New York |year=1859 |isbn= 0548150346}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|211}} The critical evidence of Mather’s zealous behavior comes later, during the trial execution of George Burroughs {Harvard Class of 1670}. Upham gives the Robert Calef account of the execution of Mr. Burroughs; it is this:

{{quote|Mr. Burroughs was carried in a cart with others, through the streets of Salem, to execution. When he was upon the ladder, he made a speech for the clearing of his innocency, with such solemn and serious expressions as were to the admiration of all present. His prayer (which he concluded by repeating the Lord’s Prayer) was so well worded, and uttered with such composedness as such fervency of spirit, as was very affecting, and drew tears from many, so that if seemed to some that the spectators would hinder the execution. The accusers said the black man stood and dictated to him. As soon as he was turned off, Mr. Cotton Mather, being mounted upon a horse, addressed himself to the people, partly to declare that he (Mr. Burroughs) was no ordained minister, partly to possess the people of his guilt, saying that the devil often had been transformed into the angel of light…When he [Mr. Burroughs] was cut down, he was dragged by a halter to a hole, or grave, between the rocks, about two feet deep; his shirt and breeches being pulled off, and an old pair of trousers of one executed put on his lower parts: he was so put in, together with Willard and Carrier, that one of his hands, and his chin, and a foot of one of them, was left uncovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;upham&quot;/&gt;{{rp|301}} }}

The second issue with Cotton Mather was his influence in construction of the court for the trials. Bancroft quotes Mather as having said: “Intercession had been made by Cotton Mather for the advancement of William Stoughton, a man of cold affections, proud, self-willed and covetous of distinction.”&lt;ref name=Bancroft85/&gt;{{rp|83}} Later, referring to the placement of William Stoughton on the trial, which Bancroft noted was against the popular sentiment of the town,&lt;ref name=Bancroft85/&gt;{{rp|83}} Bancroft referred to a statement in Mather’s diary; that statement is quoted here:

{{quote|“The time for a favor is come,” exulted Cotton Mather; “Yea, the set time is come. Instead of my being a made a sacrifice to wicked rulers, my father-in-law, with several related to me, and several brethren of my own church, are among the council. The Governor of the province is not my enemy, but one of my dearest friends.”&lt;ref name=Bancroft85/&gt;{{rp|84}}}}

Bancroft also noted that Mather considered witches &quot;among the poor, and vile, and ragged beggars upon Earth,&quot;&lt;ref name=Bancroft85/&gt;{{rp|85}} and Bancroft asserts that Mather considered the people against the witch trials to be witch advocates.&lt;ref name=Bancroft85/&gt;{{rp|85}}

===Mather as a positive influence on the trials===

Chadwick Hansen’s ''Witchcraft at Salem,'' published in 1969, defined Mather as a positive influence on the Salem Trials. Hansen considered Mather's handling of the Goodwin Children to be sane and temperate.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen&quot;/&gt;{{rp|168}} Hansen also noted that Mather was more concerned with helping the affected children than witch-hunting.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen&quot;/&gt;{{rp|60}} Mather treated the affected children through prayer and fasting.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen&quot;/&gt;{{rp|24}}

Mather also tried to convert accused witch [[Ann Glover|Goodwife Glover]] after she was accused of practicing witchcraft on the Goodwin children.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen&quot;/&gt;{{rp|24}} Most interestingly, and out of character with the previous depictions of Mather, was Mather’s decision not to tell the community of the others whom Goodwife Clover claimed practiced witch craft.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen&quot;/&gt;{{rp|23}} Lastly, Hansen claimed Mather acted as a moderating influence in the trials by opposing the death penalty for lesser criminals, such as Tituba and Dorcas Good.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen&quot;/&gt;{{rp|123}} Hansen also notes that the negative impressions of Cotton Mather stem from his defense of the trials in ''Wonders of the Invisible World.'' Mather became the chief defender of the trial, which diminished accounts of his earlier actions as a moderate influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen&quot;/&gt;{{rp|189}}

Some historians who have examined the life of Cotton Mather after Chadwick Hansen’s book share his view of Cotton Mather. For instance, Bernard Rosenthal noted that Mather often gets portrayed as the rabid witch hunter.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenthal&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Bernard Rosenthal |title= Salem Story |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |year=1993 |isbn= 0521440610}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|169}} Rosenthal also described Mather’s guilt about his inability to restrain the judges during the trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenthal&quot;/&gt;{{rp|202}} Larry Gregg highlights Mather’s sympathy for the possessed, when Mather stated, “the devil have sometimes represented the shapes of persons not only innocent, but also the very virtuous.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Larry Gregg |title= The Salem Witch Crisis |publisher= Praeger Publishers |location= New York |year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|88}} And John Demos considered Mather a moderating influence on the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= John Demos |title=  Entertaining Satan: Witchcraft and the Culture of Early New England |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |year=2004 |isbn= 0195031318}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|305}}

===Post-trial===

After the trial, Cotton Mather was unrepentant for his role. Of the principal actors in the trial, whose lives are recorded after it, only Cotton Mather and William Stoughton never admitted any guilt.&lt;ref name=Bancroft85/&gt;{{rp|98}} Indeed, in the years after the trial Mather became an increasingly vehement defender of the trial. At the request of then Lt.-Gov. William Stoughton, Mather wrote ''[[Wonders of the Invisible World]]'' in 1693.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Babette Levy |title=  Cotton Mather |publisher= Twayne Publishers |location= Boston |year=1979 |isbn= 0805772618}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} The book contained a few of Mather’s sermons, the conditions of the colony and a description of witch trials in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;craker&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Wendel D.

The last event in Cotton Mather's involvement with witchcraft was his attempt to cure Mercy Short and Margaret Rule.&lt;ref name=Lovelace16/&gt;{{rp|202}} Mather later wrote ''A Brand Pluck’d Out of the Burning'' and ''Another Brand Pluckt Out of the Burning'' about curing the women.

=== ''Magnalia Christi Americana'' ===

''[[Magnalia Christi Americana]]'', considered Mather's greatest work, was published in 1702, when he was 39. The book, which was done through several biographies of saints, describes the process of the New England settlement (Meyers 23-24). It was composed of seven total books. Despite being one of Mather's most well-known works, many have openly criticized it{{By whom|date=March 2010}}, labeling it as hard to follow and understand, and poorly paced and organized. Random quotes in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew appear throughout. However, other critics have praised Mather's works, believing it to be one of the best efforts at properly documenting the establishment of America and growth of the people (Halttunen 311).

=== ''The Biblia Americana'' ===

When Cotton Mather died, he had an abundance of unfinished writings left behind, including one entitled ''The Biblia Americana''.  Mather believed that ''Biblia Americana'' was the best thing he had ever written, believing it to be his masterwork (Hovey 533).

''Biblia Americana'' contained Cotton Mather's thoughts and opinions on the Bible and how he interpreted it. ''Biblia Americana'' is incredibly large and Mather worked on it from 1693–1728, when he died. Mather tried to convince others that philosophy and science could work together with religion instead of against it. People did not have to choose one or the other and in ''Biblia Americana'' Mather looked at the Bible through a scientific perspective, the complete opposite of when he wrote ''The Christian Philosopher'', in which he decided to approach science in a religious manner (Smolinski 280-281).

=== ''The Christian Philosopher'' ===

In 1721 ''The Christian Philosopher'' was published. Written by Mather, it was the first systematic book on science published in America. Mather attempted to show how Newtonian science and religion were in harmony. It was in part based on Robert Boyle's ''The Christian Virtuoso'' (1690).[13]

Mather also took inspiration from ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'', a philosophical novel by Abu Bakr [[Ibn Tufail]] (who he refers to as &quot;Abubekar&quot;), a 12th-century Islamic philosopher. Despite condemning the 'Mahometans' as infidels, he viewed the protagonist of the novel, Hayy, as a model for his ideal Christian philosopher and monotheistic scientist'. Mather also viewed Hayy as a noble savage and applied this in the context of attempting to understand the Native American Indians in order to convert them to Puritan Christianity.[14]

=== ''Pillars of Salt'' ===

The Puritan execution sermon, preached on the occasion of a public hanging, then quickly printed up in pamphlet form and sold for a few pence, was an early form of true-crime literature. Mather's first published sermon, which appeared in 1686, concerned the crime and punishment of James Morgan, a reprobate who in a drunken rage impaled a man with an iron spit. Thirteen years later, following the execution of a Boston woman named Sarah Threeneedles for killing her baby, Mather issued ''Pillars of Salt''. This compilation of a dozen accounts (half of which, including the case of Morgan, had been previously published) stands as a landmark work, a Puritan precursor of the true-crime miscellanies that, stripped of all religious intent, would become a staple of the genre in subsequent centuries. In 2008 [[The Library of America]] reprinted the entirety of ''Pillars of Salt'' in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime.

=== ''Boston Ephemeris'' ===

The Boston Ephemeris was an [[almanac]] written by Mather in 1686. The content was similar to what is known today as the Farmer’s Almanac. This was particularly important because it shows that Cotton Mather had influence in mathematics during the time of Puritan New England. This almanac contained a significant amount of astronomy, celestial motions of the sun, planets, and stars, as did many almanacs of the time. It also included “information such as weather forecasts, farmers' planting dates, astronomical information, and tide tables, Astronomical data and various statistics, such as the times of the rising and setting of the sun and moon, eclipses, hours of full tide, stated festivals of churches, terms of courts, lists of all types, timelines, and more.” Mather had within the text of the Almanac the positions and motions of these celestial bodies, which he must have calculated by hand.&lt;ref&gt;Burdick, Bruce. &quot;Mathematical Works Printed in the Americas, 1554-1700&quot;. Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cordwainer Smith''' &amp;ndash; pronounced ''CORDwainer''&lt;ref&gt;Elms, Alan C., [http://www.ulmus.net/ace/csmith/cspronunciation.html Cordwainer Smith Pronunciation Guide], [[Ulmus.net]], accessed August 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; was the [[pseudonym]] used by [[United States|American]] [[author]] '''Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger''' (July 11, 1913–August 6, 1966) for his [[science fiction]] works. Linebarger was a noted [[East Asia]] scholar and expert in [[psychological warfare]]. (&quot;Cordwainer&quot; is an archaic word for &quot;A worker in cordwain or cordovan leather; a shoemaker&quot;,&lt;ref name=OED&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; and a &quot;smith&quot; is &quot;One who works in iron or other metals; esp. a blacksmith or farrier&quot;&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;: two kinds of skilled workers with traditional materials.)

Linebarger also employed the literary pseudonyms &quot;Carmichael Smith&quot; (for his political thriller ''[[Atomsk (novel)|Atomsk]]''), &quot;Anthony Bearden&quot; (for his [[poetry]]) and &quot;Felix C. Forrest&quot; (for the novels ''Ria'' and ''Carola'').

==Early life and education==
Linebarger was born in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. His father was [[Paul M. W. Linebarger]], a [[lawyer]] and political [[activism|activist]] with close ties to the leaders of the [[Xinhai Revolution|Chinese revolution of 1911]]. As a result of those connections, Linebarger's [[Godparent|godfather]] was [[Sun Yat-sen]], considered the father of Chinese nationalism. 

As a child, Linebarger was [[blindness|blinded]] in his right eye; the vision in his remaining eye was impaired by infection. His father moved his family to [[France]] and then [[Germany]] while Sun Yat-sen was struggling against contentious warlords in China. As a result, Linebarger was familiar with six languages by adulthood. 

At the age of 23, he received a Ph.D. in Political Science from [[Johns Hopkins University]].

==Career==
From 1937 to 1946, Linebarger held a faculty appointment at [[Duke University]], where he began producing highly regarded works on Far Eastern affairs.  

While retaining his professorship at Duke after the beginning of [[World War II]], Linebarger began serving as a second lieutenant of the [[United States Army]], where he was involved in the creation of the [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]] and the [[Operation Planning and Intelligence Board]]. He also helped organize the Army's first psychological warfare section. In 1943, he was sent to China to coordinate military intelligence operations. When he later pursued his interest in [[China]], Linebarger became a close confidant of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. By the end of the war, he had risen to the rank of major.

[[File:Psychological Warfare Linebarger.jpg|frame|left]]

In 1947, Linebarger moved to the Johns Hopkins University's [[School of Advanced International Studies]] in Washington, DC, where he served as Professor of Asiatic Studies. He used his experiences in the war to write the book ''Psychological Warfare'' (1948). It is regarded by many in the field as a classic text. 

He eventually rose to the rank of colonel in the reserves. He was recalled to advise the British forces in the [[Malayan Emergency]] and the U.S. Eighth Army in the [[Korean War]]. While he was known to call himself a &quot;visitor to small wars&quot;, he refrained from becoming involved in [[Vietnam]], but is known to have done undocumented work for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. He traveled extensively and became a member of the [[Foreign Policy Association]], and was called upon to advise then–U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]].

==Marriage and family==
In 1936, Linebarger married Margaret Snow. They had a daughter in 1942 and another in 1947. They divorced in 1949. 

In 1950, Linebarger married again to Genevieve Collins; they had several children. They were married until his death from a heart attack in 1966, in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. Linebarger had expressed a wish to retire to [[Australia]], which he had visited in his travels, but died at age 53.

Colonel Linebarger is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]], Section 35, Grave Number 4712. After her death, his widow, Genevieve Collins Linebarger, was interred with him on November 16, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/linebarg.htm Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case history debate==
Linebarger was long rumored to have been the original for &quot;Kirk Allen,&quot; the fantasy-haunted subject of &quot;The Jet-Propelled Couch,&quot; a chapter in [[psychologist]] [[Robert M. Lindner]]'s best-selling 1954 collection, ''The Fifty-Minute Hour.''&lt;ref&gt;Lindner, Robert. ''The Fifty-Minute Hour.'' New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cordwainer Smith scholar Alan C. Elms,&lt;ref&gt;Elms, Alan C. &quot;[http://www.ulmus.net/ace/csmith/behindjetcouch.html Behind the Jet-Propelled Couch: Cordwainer Smith &amp; Kirk Allen],&quot; ''New York Review of Science Fiction,'' May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; this speculation first reached print in [[Brian Aldiss]]'s 1973 history of science fiction, ''Billion Year Spree''; Aldiss, in turn, claimed to have gotten the information from [[Leon Stover]].&lt;ref&gt;Aldiss, Brian W. ''Billion Year Spree: The True History of Science Fiction.'' New York: Doubleday, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, both Elms and librarian Lee Weinstein&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Lee. &quot;In Search of Kirk Allen,&quot; ''New York Review of Science Fiction'', April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; have gathered circumstantial evidence to support the case for Linebarger's being &quot;Allen,&quot; but both concede there is no direct proof that Linebarger was ever a patient of Lindner's or that he suffered from a disorder similar to that of &quot;Kirk Allen.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;See also '[http://www.cordwainer-smith.com/scholarly.htm Cordwainer Smith Scholarly Corner] by [[Alan C. Elms]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science fiction==
A notable characteristic of Linebarger's science fiction is that most of his stories are set in the same universe, with a unified chronology. Some [[anthologies]] of Linebarger's fiction include a chart, with each of his stories inserted into the appropriate slot in the timeline. All his writings suggest a rich universe developing over a long period of time, but leave much to be guessed at by the reader. 

Linebarger's stories are unusual, sometimes being written in narrative styles closer to traditional [[Chinese literature|Chinese stories]] than to most English-language fiction. The total volume of his science fiction output is relatively small, due to his time-consuming profession and his early death. 

Smith's works consist of: a single novel, originally published in two volumes in edited form as ''The Planet Buyer'', also known as ''The Boy Who Bought Old Earth'' (1964) and ''The Underpeople'' (1968), and later restored to its original form as ''[[Norstrilia]]'' (1975); and 32 short stories (collected in ''[[The Rediscovery of Man]]'' (1993), including two versions of the short story &quot;War No. 81-Q&quot;). 

Linebarger's cultural links to China are partially expressed in the pseudonym &quot;Felix C. Forrest&quot;, which he used in addition to &quot;Cordwainer Smith&quot;: his godfather [[Sun Yat-Sen]] suggested to Linebarger that he adopt the Chinese name &quot;Lin Bai-lo&quot; ({{zh|t=林白樂|s=林白乐|p=Lín Báilè}}), which may be roughly translated as &quot;Forest of Incandescent Bliss&quot;. In his later years, Linebarger proudly wore a tie with the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters for this name embroidered on it.

As an expert in psychological warfare, Linebarger was very interested in the newly developing fields of [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]]. He used many of their concepts into his fiction. His fiction often has religious overtones or motifs, particularly evident in characters who have no control over their actions. James P. Jordan argued for the importance of [[Anglicanism]] to Linebarger's works back to 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, James B., [http://www.sunpopblue.com/Music-Art-Books/Cordwainer-Smith.html &quot;Christianity in the Science Fiction of 'Cordwainer Smith'], ''Contra Mundum'', No. 2 Winter 1992&lt;/ref&gt; But, Linebarger's daughter Rosana Hart has indicated that he did not become an Anglican until 1950 and was not strongly interested in religion until later still.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cordwainer-smith.com/remember.htm &quot;Biography and memories of Paul M. A. Linebarger, who was Cordwainer Smith]&quot;, www.cordwainer-smith.com&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction to the collection ''Rediscovery of Man'' notes that from around 1960 Linebarger became more devout and expressed this in his writing. Linebarger's works are sometimes included in analyses of Christianity in fiction, along with the works of authors such as [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

Most of Smith's stories are set in an era starting some 14,000 years in the future. The [[Instrumentality of Mankind]] rules Earth and goes on to control other planets later inhabited by humanity. The Instrumentality attempts to revive old cultures and languages in a process known as the Rediscovery of Man. This rediscovery can be seen as the initial period when humankind emerges from a mundane utopia and the nonhuman Underpeople gain freedom from slavery. It may also be viewed as part of a continuing process begun by the Instrumentality, encompassing the whole cycle, where mankind is constantly at risk of falling back into bad old ways.

Smith's stories describe a long [[future history]] of Earth. The settings range from a [[postapocalyptic]] landscape with [[walled cities]], defended by agents of the Instrumentality, to a state of sterile utopia, in which freedom can be found only deep below the surface, in long-forgotten and buried [[anthropogenic]] strata. These features may place Smith's works within the [[Dying Earth subgenre]] of [[science fiction]]. They are ultimately more optimistic and distinctive.

Smith's most celebrated short story is his first-published, &quot;[[Scanners Live in Vain]]&quot;, which led many of its earliest readers to assume that &quot;Cordwainer Smith&quot; was a new pen name for one of the established giants of the genre. It was selected as one of the best science fiction short stories of the pre-[[Nebula Award]] period by the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]]. It was selected for ''[[The Science Fiction Hall of Fame Volume One, 1929-1964]]''.

Linebarger's stories feature strange and vivid creations, such as:
* The planet Norstrilia (Old North Australia), a semi-arid planet where an immortality drug called ''stroon'' is harvested from gigantic, virus-infected sheep each weighing more than 100 tons. Norstrilians are nominally the richest people in the galaxy and defend their immensely valuable stroon with sophisticated weapons (as shown in the story &quot;[[Mother Hitton's Littul Kittons]]&quot;). However, extremely high taxes ensure that everyone on the planet lives a frugal, rural life, like the farmers of old Australia, to keep the Norstrilians tough.
* The punishment world of ''Shayol'' (cf. [[Sheol]]), where criminals are punished by the regrowth and harvesting of their organs for transplanting
* ''planoforming'' [[spacecraft]], which are crewed by humans telepathically linked with cats to defend against the attacks of malevolent entities in space, who are perceived by the humans as dragons, and by the cats as gigantic rats, in &quot;The Game of Rat and Dragon&quot;.
* the ''Underpeople'', animals modified into human form and intelligence to fulfill servile roles, and treated as property. Several stories feature clandestine efforts to liberate the Underpeople and grant them [[civil rights]]. They are seen everywhere throughout regions controlled by the Instrumentality. Names of Underpeople are based on their animal species. Thus C'Mell (&quot;[[The Ballad of Lost C'Mell]]&quot;) is cat-derived; and D'Joan (&quot;[[The Dead Lady of Clown Town]]&quot;), a [[Joan of Arc]] figure, is descended from dogs.
* ''Habermans'' and their supervisors, ''Scanners'', who are essential for space travel, but at the cost of having their sensory [[nerve]]s cut to block the &quot;pain of space&quot;, and who perceive only by vision and various life-support implants. A technological breakthrough removes the need for the treatment, but resistance among the Scanners to their perceived loss of status ensues, forming the basis of the story &quot;Scanners Live in Vain&quot;.
* Early works in the timeline include [[neologism]]s which are not explained to any great extent, but serve to produce an atmosphere of strangeness. These words are usually derived from non-English words. For instance, ''manshonyagger'' derives from the German words &quot;menschen&quot; meaning, in some senses, &quot;men&quot; or &quot;mankind&quot;, and &quot;jäger&quot;, meaning a hunter; referring to war machines that roam the wild lands between the walled cities and prey on men, except for those they can identify as Germans. Another example is &quot;Meeya Meefla&quot;, the only city to have preserved its name from the pre-atomic era: evidently [[Miami]], Florida, from its abbreviated form (as on road signs) &quot;'''MIAMI FLA'''&quot;.
* Character names in the stories often derive from words in languages other than English. Smith seemed particularly fond of using numbers for this purpose. For instance, the name &quot;Lord Sto Odin&quot; in the story &quot;Under Old Earth&quot; is derived from the Russian words for &quot;One hundred and one&quot;, сто один. Quite a few of the names mean &quot;five-six&quot; in different languages, including both the robot Fisi (fi[ve]-si[x]), the dead Lady Panc Ashash (in Sanskrit &quot;pañcha&quot; [पञ्च] is &quot;five&quot; and &quot;ṣaṣ&quot; [षष्] is &quot;six&quot;), Limaono ([[wikt:lima#Hawaiian|lima]]-[[wikt:ono#Hawaiian|ono]], both in Hawaiian and/or Fijian), Englok (ng&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-luk&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[wikt:五#Cantonese|五]]-[[wikt:六#Cantonese|六]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, in Cantonese), Goroke (go-roku &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[wikt:五#Japanese|五]]-[[wikt:六#Japanese|六]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Japanese) and Femtiosex (&quot;[[wikt:femtio|fifty]]-[[wikt:sex#Swedish|six]]&quot; in Swedish) in &quot;The Dead Lady of Clown Town&quot; as well as the main character in &quot;Think Blue, Count Two&quot;, Veesey-koosey, which is an English transcription of the Finnish words &quot;[[wikt:viisi|viisi]]&quot; (five) and &quot;[[wikt:kuusi|kuusi]]&quot; (six). Four of the characters in &quot;Think Blue, Count Two&quot; are called &quot;Thirteen&quot; in different languages: Tiga-belas (both in [[:id:13 (angka)|Indonesian]] and [[:ms:13 (nombor)|Malay]]), Trece ([[wikt:trece|Spanish]]), Talatashar (based on an Arabic dialect form &lt;big&gt;ثلاث عشر&lt;/big&gt;, ''thalāth ʿashar'') and Sh'san (based on Mandarin 十三‎, ''shísān'', where the &quot;í&quot; is never pronounced). Other names, notably that of Lord Jestocost (Russian Жестокость, Cruelty), are non-English but not numbers.
* Remnants of contemporary culture accordingly appear as valued antiquities or sometimes just as unrecognized survivals, lending a rare feeling of nostalgia for the present to the stories.

{{main|Geography of Colorado}}
The '''Colorado Front Range''' is a colloquial geographic term for the most populous region of the state of [[Colorado]] in the [[United States]]. The area is located just east of the [[foothills]] of the [[Front Range]], aligned in a north-south configuration on the western edge of the [[Great Plains]], where they meet the Rockies. [[Geology|Geologically]], the region lies mostly within the [[Colorado Piedmont]], in the valley of the [[South Platte River|South Platte]] and [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] rivers on the east side of the Rockies. The region contains the largest cities and the majority of the population of Colorado.

The Colorado Front Range communities include (in a roughly north-to-south order):
* [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]]
* [[Greeley, Colorado|Greeley]]
* [[Loveland, Colorado|Loveland]]
* [[Longmont, Colorado|Longmont]]
* [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]]
* [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]]
* [[Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Area]]
* [[Castle Rock, Colorado|Castle Rock]]
* [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]
* [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]]

The addition of the adjacent [[Wyoming]] community of [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]] to the Colorado Front Range forms the full [[Front Range Urban Corridor]].

'''Churnsike Lodge''' ({{gbmapping|NY664771}}) was an early [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[hunting lodge]] situated in the parish of Greystead,  West [[Northumberland]], [[England]]. It was built in 1850 as a shooting lodge and was part of the Hesleyside estate (Hesleyside house is situated in the North Tyne valley near Bellingham). When the estate was sold in 1889, Churnsike Lodge was purchased by the Chesters Estate (near Hexham, Northumberland). The &quot;cairnsyke&quot; estate comprised several thousand acres of grouse moor and is referred to in the sale catalogue of 1889 as the &quot;Finest grouse moor in the Kingdom&quot;. The property included stables for 6 horses, a gamekeepers bothy and well appointed dog kennels which housed the Irthing head and Kielder hounds (headed by famous fox hunter William Dodd, as referred to in &quot;Wanny Blossoms&quot;). Situated 10 miles north of Gilsland and 13 miles west of Bellingham, the former grouse moor is now part of the Wark forest but there are areas still not covered by conifers where grouse can be found. Churnsike Lodge is now in private ownership.

'''William &quot;Captain&quot; Kidd''' ([[circa|c.]] 1645 – May 23, 1701)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year =2003| title =William Kidd| publisher =UXL Encyclopedia of World Biography| url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5229/is_2003/ai_n19152123| accessdate =2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] sailor remembered for his [[trial]] and [[execution]] for [[piracy]] after returning from a voyage to the [[Indian Ocean]].  Some modern historians deem his piratical reputation unjust, as there is evidence that Kidd acted only as a [[privateer]].  Kidd's fame springs largely from the sensational circumstances of his questioning before the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] and the ensuing trial.  His actual depredations on the high seas, whether piratical or not, were both less destructive and less lucrative than those of many other contemporary pirates and privateers.

==Biography==
Captain William Kidd was either one of the most notorious pirates in history, or one of its most unjustly vilified and prosecuted privateers in an age typified by the rationalization of empire. Despite the legends and fiction surrounding this character, his actual career was punctuated by only a handful of skirmishes followed by a desperate quest to clear his name.

Kidd was born in [[Greenock]], Scotland in 1645.  He is also said, in the book ''[[American Folklore and Legend]]'', to be from a family of Cornish [[gold-miners]].  According to myth or other stories, his &quot;father was thought to have been a Church of Scotland minister.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Pirates: William Kidd| publisher =Genealogy &amp; Family History Achievements Heraldry and Research| url =http://www.achievements.co.uk/articles/william_kidd.html| accessdate =2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =WELCOME TO THE ULTIMATE CAPTAIN WILLIAM KIDD WEB SITE |url =http://www.pfrh.supanet.com/HISTORYBODY.htm| accessdate =2007-12-13}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of his father, when he was five years old, Kidd moved to the new colony in [[New York]]. It was here that he befriended many prominent [[Colonialism|colonial]] citizens, including three [[governor]]s.  There is some information that suggests he was a seaman's apprentice on a pirate ship much earlier than his own more famous pirating.

The first records of his life date from 1689, when he was about 44 years old and a member of a French-English pirate crew that sailed in the Caribbean. Kidd and other members of the crew mutinied, ousted the captain of the ship, and sailed to the English colony of [[Nevis]]. There they renamed the ship the ''[[Blessed William]]''. Kidd became captain, either the result of an election of the ship's crew or because of appointment by Christopher Codrington, governor of the island of Nevis. Captain Kidd and the ''Blessed William'' became part of a small fleet assembled by Codrington to defend Nevis from the French, with whom the English were at war. In either case, he must have been an experienced leader and sailor by that time. As the governor did not want to pay the sailors for their defensive services, he told them they could take their pay from the French. Kidd and his men attacked the French island of Mariegalante, destroyed the only town, and looted the area, gathering for themselves something around 2,000 pounds Sterling.
During the [[War of the Grand Alliance]], on orders from the province of New York, [[Massachusetts]], Kidd captured an enemy [[privateer]], which duty he was commissioned to perform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =WILLIAM KIDD| publisher =Online Encyclopedia| url =http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/KHA_KRI/KIDD_WILLIAM.html| accessdate =2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; off of the [[New England]] coast. Shortly thereafter, Kidd was awarded [[Pound sterling|£]]150 for successful privateering in the [[Caribbean]]. One year later, [[Robert Culliford|&quot;Captain&quot; Culliford]], a notorious pirate, stole Kidd's ship while he was ashore at [[Antigua]] in the [[West Indies]]. In 1695, [[William III of England]] replaced the corrupt governor [[Benjamin Fletcher]], known for accepting [[bribe]]s of one hundred dollars to allow illegal trading of pirate loot, with [[Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont|Richard Coote]], Earl of Bellomont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date =2001-05 |title =Bellomont, Richard Coote, earl of| publisher =The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition| url =http://www.bartleby.com/65/be/Bellomon.html| accessdate =2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In New York City, Kidd was active in the building of [[Trinity Church, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Trinity Wall Street Historical Timeline |url =http://www.trinitywallstreet.org/history/?timeline| accessdate =2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 1691, Kidd married Sarah Bradley Cox Oort, an English woman in her early twenties, who had already been twice widowed and was one of the wealthiest women in New York, largely due to her inheritance from her first husband.&lt;ref&gt;Zacks, p. 82-83, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparing his expedition===
[[File:Captain Kidd in New York Harbor cph.3f06373.jpg|thumb|250px|''Captain Kidd in New York Harbor'', ca. 1920 painting by [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]]]]
On December 11, 1695, Bellomont, who was now governing [[New York]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[New Hampshire]], asked the &quot;''trusty and well beloved Captain Kidd''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton, 1961 p&quot;&gt;Hamilton, (1961) p.?&lt;/ref&gt; to attack [[Thomas Tew]], John Ireland, Thomas Wake, William Maze, and all others who associated themselves with pirates, along with any enemy [[France|French]] ships.  This request preceded the voyage which established Kidd's reputation as a pirate, and marked his image in history and [[folklore]].

Four-fifths of the cost for the venture was paid for by noble lords, who were among the most powerful men in England: the [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Earl of Orford]], The Baron of Romney, the [[Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury|Duke of Shrewsbury]] and [[John Somers, 1st Baron Somers|Sir John Somers]].  Kidd was presented with a [[letter of marque]], signed personally by King [[William III of England]].  This letter reserved 10% of the loot for the Crown, and Henry Gilbert's ''The Book of Pirates'' suggests that the King may have fronted some of the money for the voyage himself. Kidd and an acquaintance, Colonel [[Robert Livingston the Elder|Robert Livingston]], orchestrated the whole plan and paid for the rest. Kidd had to sell his ship ''Antigua'' to raise funds.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The new ship, the ''[[Adventure Galley]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =&quot;Buccaneers and Pirates of Our Coasts&quot; &quot;The Real Captain Kidd&quot;| author =Frank R. Stockton| publisher =The Baldwin Online Children's Literature Project| url =http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=stockton&amp;book=buccaneers&amp;story=kidd| accessdate =2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; was well suited to the task of catching pirates; weighing over 284 [[tonnage|tons]], she was equipped with 34 [[Naval artillery in the Age of Sail|cannon]], oars, and 150 men. The oars were a key advantage as they would enable the ''Adventure Galley'' to maneuver in a battle when the winds had calmed and other ships were dead in the water. Kidd took pride in personally selecting the crew, choosing only those he deemed to be the best and most loyal officers.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

{{quote |As the Adventure Galley sailed down the [[Thames]], Kidd unaccountably failed to salute a Navy yacht at Greenwich as custom dictated.  The [[Navy]] yacht then fired a shot to make him show respect, and Kidd’s crew… responded with an astounding display of impudence—by turning and slapping their backsides in [disdain].&lt;ref&gt;Botting (1978) p.106&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because of Kidd's refusal to salute, the Navy vessel's captain retaliated by [[impressment|pressing]] much of Kidd's crew into [[Royal Navy|naval service]], this despite rampant protests.  Thus short-handed, Kidd sailed for [[New York City]], capturing a French vessel en route (which was legal under the terms of his commission).  To make up for the lack of officers, Kidd picked up replacement crew in New York, the vast majority of whom were known and hardened criminals, some undoubtedly former pirates.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Among Kidd's officers was his [[quartermaster]], Hendrick van der Heul.  The quartermaster was considered 'second in command' to the captain in pirate culture of this era.  It is not clear, however, if Van der Heul exercised this degree of responsibility because Kidd was nominally a privateer.  Van der Heul is also noteworthy because he may have been [[African]] or of [[African-American]] descent.  A contemporary source describes him as a &quot;''small black Man''.&quot;  However, the meaning of this term is not certain as, in late seventeenth-century usage, the term ''negro'' would have been normally used, and the phrase &quot;''black Man''&quot; could mean either black-skinned or black-haired.  If van der Heul was indeed of African ancestry, this fact would make him the highest ranking black pirate so far identified.  Van der Heul went on to become a [[master's mate]] on a merchant vessel, and was never convicted of piracy.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Hunting for pirates===
In September 1696, Kidd weighed anchor and set course for the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. A third of his crew soon perished on the [[Comoros]] due to an outbreak of [[cholera]], the brand-new ship developed many leaks, and he failed to find the pirates he expected to encounter off [[Madagascar]].  Kidd then sailed to the Strait of [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] at the southern entrance of the [[Red Sea]], one of the most popular haunts of rovers on the [[Pirate Round]].  Here he again failed to find any pirates.  According to [[Edward Barlow]], a captain employed by the [[English East India Company]], Kidd attacked a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] convoy here under escort by Barlow's [[East Indiaman]], and was repelled.  If the report is true, this marked Kidd's first foray into piracy.

As it became obvious his ambitious enterprise was failing, he became understandably desperate to cover its costs. But, once again, Kidd failed to attack several ships when given a chance, including a Dutchman and New York privateer. Some of the crew deserted Kidd the next time the ''Adventure Galley'' anchored offshore, and those who decided to stay behind made constant [[coercion|open-threats]] of [[mutiny]].

[[File:Pyle pirates burying2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Howard Pyle's fanciful painting of Kidd burying treasure]]
Kidd killed one of his own crewmen on October 30, 1697. While Kidd's gunner, William Moore, was on deck sharpening a [[chisel]], a Dutch ship hove in sight.  Moore urged Kidd to attack the Dutchman, an act not only piratical but also certain to anger the Dutch-born King William.  Kidd refused, calling Moore a lousy dog. Moore retorted, &quot;''If I am a lousy dog, you have made me so; you have brought me to ruin and many more''.&quot;  Kidd snatched up and heaved an ironbound bucket at Moore. Moore fell to the deck with a [[Skull fracture|fractured skull]] and died the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly (1995), p.?&lt;/ref&gt;

While seventeenth century English [[admiralty law]] allowed captains great leeway in using [[violence]] against their crew, outright [[murder]] was not permitted.  But Kidd seemed unconcerned, later explaining to his surgeon that he had &quot;''good friends in England, that will bring me off for that''.&quot;

===Accusations of piracy===
Acts of savagery on Kidd's part were reported by escaped prisoners, who told stories of being hoisted up by the arms and [[beating up|drubbed]] with a drawn [[cutlass]]. On one occasion, crew members ransacked the trading ship ''Mary'' and tortured several of its crew members while Kidd and the other captain, Thomas Parker, conversed privately in Kidd's cabin. When Kidd found out what had happened, he was outraged and forced his men to return most of the stolen property.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Kidd was declared a pirate very early in his voyage by a Royal Navy officer to whom he had promised &quot;''thirty men or so''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton, 1961 p&quot;/&gt; Kidd sailed away during the night to preserve his crew, rather than subject them to Royal Navy [[impressment]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

On January 30, 1698, he raised French colours and took his greatest prize, an [[Armenia]]n ship, the 400 ton [[Quedagh Merchant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Pirates of the High Seas - Capt. William Kidd| url =http://library.thinkquest.org/05aug/01841/kidd.html| accessdate =2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =“Quedagh Merchant” (ship)| publisher =Encyclopedia Online| url =http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-486764/Quedagh-Merchant| accessdate =2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was loaded with [[satin]]s, [[muslin]]s, [[gold]], [[silver]], an incredible variety of [[East India]]n [[merchandise]], as well as extremely valuable [[silk]]s. The captain of the Quedagh Merchant was an Englishman named Wright, who had purchased passes from the French East India Company promising him the protection of the French Crown. After realizing the captain of the taken vessel was an Englishman, Kidd tried to persuade his crew to return the ship to its owners{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, but they refused, claiming that their prey was perfectly legal as Kidd was commissioned to take French ships, and that an Armenian ship counted as French if it had French passes. In an attempt to maintain his tenuous control over his crew, Kidd relented and kept the prize.  When this news reached England, it confirmed Kidd's reputation as a pirate, and various naval commanders were ordered to &quot;pursue and seize the said Kidd and his accomplices&quot; for the &quot;notorious piracies&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; they had committed.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Kidd kept the French passes of the ''Quedagh Merchant'', as well as the vessel itself.  While the passes were at best a dubious defence of his capture, British admiralty and vice-admiralty courts (especially in North America) heretofore had often winked at privateers' excesses into piracy, and Kidd may have been hoping that the passes would provide the legal fig leaf that would allow him to keep the ''Quedagh Merchant'' and her cargo.  Renaming the seized merchantman the ''Adventure Prize'', he set sail for Madagascar.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

On April 1, 1698, Kidd reached Madagascar. Here he found the first pirate of his voyage, [[Robert Culliford]], (the same man who had stolen Kidd’s ship years before) and his crew aboard the ''Mocha Frigate''.  Two contradictory accounts exist of how Kidd reacted to his encounter with Culliford.  According to ''The General History of the Pirates'', published more than 25 years after the event by an author whose very identity remains in dispute, Kidd made peaceful overtures to Culliford: he &quot;drank their Captain's health,&quot; swearing that &quot;he was in every respect their Brother,&quot; and gave Culliford &quot;a Present of an Anchor and some Guns.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Johnson (1728).  ''The History of the Pyrates'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;  This account appears to be based on the testimony of Kidd's crewmen Joseph Palmer and Robert Bradinham at his trial.  The other version was presented by Richard Zacks in his 2002 book ''The Pirate Hunter: The True Story of Captain Kidd.''  According to Zacks, Kidd was unaware that Culliford had only about 20 crew with him, and felt ill manned and ill equipped to take the ''Mocha Frigate'' until his two prize ships and crews arrived, so he decided not to molest Culliford until these reinforcements came.  After the ''Adventure Prize'' and ''Rouparelle'' came in, Kidd ordered his crew to attack Culliford's ''Mocha Frigate''.  However, his crew, despite their previous eagerness to seize any available prize, refused to attack Culliford and threatened instead to shoot Kidd.  Zacks does not refer to any source for his version of events.&lt;ref&gt;Zacks, p. 185-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both accounts agree that most of Kidd's men now abandoned him for Culliford. Only 13 remained with the ''Adventure Galley.''  Deciding to return home, Kidd left the ''[[Adventure Galley]]'' behind, ordering her to be burnt because she had become worm-eaten and leaky. By burning the ship, he was able to salvage every last scrap of metal, for example hinges. With the loyal remnant of his crew, he returned to the Caribbean aboard the ''Adventure Prize.''{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Trial and Execution===
[[Image:Hanging of William Kidd.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Captain Kidd hanging in chains.]]
Prior to Kidd returning to New York City, he learned that he was a wanted pirate, and that several English [[men-of-war]] were searching for him.  Realizing that the ''Adventure Prize'' was a marked vessel, he cached it in the [[Caribbean Sea]] and continued toward New York aboard a sloop.  He is alleged{{By whom|date=May 2011}} to have deposited some of his treasure on [[Gardiners Island]], hoping to use his knowledge of its location as a bargaining tool.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Bellomont (an investor) was away in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].  Aware of the accusations against Kidd, Bellomont was justifiably afraid of being implicated in piracy himself, and knew that presenting Kidd to England in chains was his best chance to save his own neck.  He lured Kidd into Boston with false promises of clemency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =The Quest for the Armenian Vessel, Quedagh Merchant| publisher =AYAS Nautical Research Club| url =http://www.amarasonline.com/amaras/events/cillicia-flyer-1.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate =2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; then ordered him arrested on July 6, 1699. Kidd was placed in Stone Prison, spending most of the time in [[solitary confinement]].  His wife, Sarah, was also imprisoned.  The conditions of Kidd's imprisonment were extremely harsh, and appear to have driven him at least temporarily insane.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

He was eventually (after over a year) sent to England for questioning by [[British Parliament|Parliament]].  The new Tory ministry hoped to use Kidd as a tool to discredit the Whigs who had backed him, but Kidd refused to name names, naively confident his patrons would reward his loyalty by interceding on his behalf. There is speculation that he probably would have been spared if he'd talked. Finding Kidd politically useless, the Tory leaders sent him to stand trial before the [[Admiralty court|High Court of Admiralty]] in London for the charges of piracy on high seas and the murder of William Moore. Whilst awaiting trial, Kidd was confined in the infamous [[Newgate Prison]] and wrote several letters to King William requesting clemency.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Kidd had two lawyers to assist in his defence, Dr. Oldish and Mr. Lemon.&lt;ref&gt;Zacks, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was shocked to learn at his trial that he was charged with murder. He was found guilty on all charges (murder and five counts of piracy). He was hanged on 23 May 1701, at '[[Execution Dock]]', [[Wapping]], in [[London]]. During the execution, the hangman's rope broke and Kidd was hanged on the second attempt. His body was ''[[gibbet]]ed''—left to hang in an iron cage over the [[River Thames]] at Tilbury Point&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_piracy.htm A brief history of piracy]&lt;/ref&gt;—as a warning to future would-be pirates for twenty years.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

His associates  Richard Barleycorn, Robert Lamley, William Jenkins, Gabriel Loffe, Able Owens, and Hugh Parrot were convicted, but pardoned just prior to hanging at Execution Dock.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Kidd's [[British Whig Party|Whig]] backers were embarrassed by his trial. Far from rewarding his loyalty, they participated in the effort to convict him by depriving him of the money and information which might have provided him with some legal defense.  In particular, the two sets of French passes he had kept were missing at his trial.  These passes (and others dated 1700) resurfaced in the early twentieth century, misfiled with other government papers in a [[London]] building. These passes call the extent of Kidd's guilt into question. Along with the papers, many goods were brought from the ships and soon auctioned off as &quot;pirate plunder.&quot; They were never mentioned in the trial.  Nevertheless, none of these items would have prevented his conviction for murdering Moore.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

A [[Broadside (music)|broadside song]] ''Captain Kidd's Farewell to the Seas, or, the Famous Pirate's Lament'' was printed shortly after his execution and popularized the common belief that Kidd had confessed to the false charges.&lt;ref&gt;The complete words of the original broadside song “Captain Kid's Farewel to the Seas, or, the Famous Pirate's Lament, to the tune of Coming Down” are at [http://www.davidkidd.net/Captain_Kidd_Lyrics.html www.davidkidd.net/Captain_Kidd_Lyrics.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology and legend==
The belief that Kidd had left a buried [[treasure]] contributed considerably to the growth of his legend. The 1701 [[Broadside (music)|broadside]] song ''Captain Kid's Farewel to the Seas, or, the Famous Pirate's Lament'' &lt;ref&gt;the complete words of the original song are at [http://www.davidkidd.net/CaptainKiddLyrics.html www.davidkidd.net/CaptainKiddLyrics.html], and also the genealogy of the  [http://www.davidkidd.net/CaptainKiddMusic.html historic tune.]&lt;/ref&gt; lists “Two hundred bars of gold, and [[Rixdollar|rix dollars]] manifold, we seized uncontrolled”. This belief made its contributions to [[literature]] in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s &quot;[[The Gold-Bug]]&quot;, [[Washington Irving]]'s ''[[The Devil and Tom Walker]]'' , [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Treasure Island]]'' and [[Nelson DeMille]]'s ''[[Plum Island (novel)|Plum Island]]''.  It also gave impetus to the never-ending treasure hunts conducted on [[Oak Island]] in [[Nova Scotia]], in [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], [[Long Island]] in [[New York]] where [[Gardiner's Island]] is located, [[Charles Island]] in Milford, [[Connecticut]]; the [[Thimble Islands]] in [[Connecticut]] and on the island of [[Grand Manan]] in the [[Bay of Fundy]].

Captain Kidd did bury a small cache of treasure on [[Gardiners Island]] in a spot known as Cherry Tree Field; however, it was removed by Governor Bellomont and sent to England to be used as evidence against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title =The Pirate Hunter: The True Story of Captain Kidd| author =Richard Zacks| publisher =Hyperion| isbn =0786884517| url =http://books.google.com/?id=8bu7WAHrd9kC&amp;pg=PA241&amp;lpg=PA241&amp;vq=gardiners+island&amp;dq=pirate+hunter |  accessdate =2007-12-14| year =2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://books.google.com/books?id=tmFDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=Lutine+Salvage&amp;lr=&amp;cd=22#v=onepage&amp;q=Lutine%20Salvage&amp;f=false .p.68 The Book of Buried treasure 1911]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kidd also visited [[Block Island]] around 1699, where he was supplied by Mrs. Mercy (Sands) Raymond, daughter of the mariner James Sands.  The story has it that, for her hospitality, Mrs. Raymond was bid to hold out her apron, into which Kidd threw gold and jewels until it was full.  After her husband Joshua Raymond died, Mercy moved with her family to northern [[New London, Connecticut]] (later Montville), where she bought much land.  The Raymond family was thus said to have been &quot;enriched by the apron&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of New London, Connecticut |last=Caulkins |first=Frances Manwaring |year=1895 |page=293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Grand Manan]] in the [[Bay of Fundy]], as early as 1875, reference was made to searches on the West side of the island for treasure allegedly buried by Kidd during his time as a [[privateer]]. For nearly 200 years, this remote area of the island has been called &quot;Money Cove&quot;.

There is also a mention of Kidd attacking one of the Japanese islands of the [[Tokara]] archipelago, south of [[Kagoshima Prefecture|Kagoshima]].  It is the most southern island, named [[Takarajima]], which translates literally as &quot;Treasure Island&quot;.  The legend says that the pirates requested food and cattle from the inhabitants of the island.  Their offer was refused and so 23 of the pirates landed and burned the inhabitants alive in a lime cave.  Afterwards, Kidd hid his treasure in one of the caves, never coming back for it due to his execution in England.

In 1983, [[Cork Graham]] and Richard Knight went looking for Captain Kidd's buried treasure off the [[Vietnam]]ese island of [[Phú Quốc]].  Knight and Graham were caught, convicted of [[Illegal entry|illegally landing]] on Vietnamese territory, and assessed each a $10,000 [[fine (penalty)|fine]].  They were imprisoned for 11 months until they paid the fine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Post12may&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Tracking Captain Kidd's Treasure Puts Pair in Vietnamese Captivity|last=Branigin|first=William|date=12 May 1984|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dominican Republic's small Catalina Island has been studied since December 13, 2007, by a team of underwater archeologists from Indiana University, after an Italian tourist announced the discovery of an old wreck at just {{convert|10|ft|m}} under the clear blue waters, at a distance of no more than {{convert|70|ft|m}} offshore.  There was no evidence of looting at the site, despite its remains being believed to have been buried since the 17th century.  It has been proven to be the ''[[Quedagh Merchant]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

'''Calreticulin''' also known as  '''calregulin''', '''CRP55''', '''CaBP3''', '''calsequestrin-like protein''', and '''endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 60''' (ERp60) is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''CALR'' [[gene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2365822&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = McCauliffe DP, Zappi E, Lieu TS, Michalak M, Sontheimer RD, Capra JD | title = A human Ro/SS-A autoantigen is the homologue of calreticulin and is highly homologous with onchocercal RAL-1 antigen and an aplysia &quot;memory molecule&quot; | journal = J. Clin. Invest. | volume = 86 | issue = 1 | pages = 332–5 | year = 1990 | month = July | pmid = 2365822 | pmc = 296725 | doi = 10.1172/JCI114704 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;entrez&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: calreticulin| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=811| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calreticulin is a multifunctional [[protein]] that binds [[calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[ion]]s (a [[second messenger]] in [[signal transduction]]), rendering it inactive. The Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is bound with low [[Chemical affinity|affinity]], but high [[Valence (chemistry)|capacity]], and can be released on a signal (see [[inositol triphosphate]]). Calreticulin is located in storage compartments associated with the [[endoplasmic reticulum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;entrez&quot;/&gt;

The term &quot;Mobilferrin&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Mobilferrin}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered to be the same as calreticulin by some sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beutler E, West C, Gelbart T |title=HLA-H and associated proteins in patients with hemochromatosis |journal=Mol. Med. |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=397–402 |year=1997 |pmid=9234244 |doi= |pmc=2230203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

Calreticulin binds to misfolded proteins and prevents them from being exported from the [[Endoplasmic reticulum]] to the [[Golgi apparatus]].

A similar quality-control chaperone, [[calnexin]], performs the same service for soluble proteins as does calreticulin.  Both proteins, Calnexin and calreticulin, have the function of binding to [[oligosaccharide]]s containing terminal glucose residues, thereby targeting them for degradation.  In normal cellular function, trimming of glucose residues off the core oligosaccharide added during N-linked [[glycosylation]] is a part of protein processing.  If &quot;overseer&quot; enzymes note that residues are misfolded, proteins within the [[Rough endoplasmic reticulum|RER]] will re-add glucose residues so that other Calreticulin/Calnexin can bind to these proteins and prevent them from proceeding to the Golgi.  This leads these aberrantly folded proteins down a path whereby they are targeted for degradation.

Studies on transgenic mice reveal that calreticulin is cardiac embryonic gene that is essential during development.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12445456&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Michalak M, Lynch J, Groenendyk J, Guo L, Robert Parker JM, Opas M | title = Calreticulin in cardiac development and pathology | journal = Biochim. Biophys. Acta | volume = 1600 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 32–7 | year = 2002 | month = November | pmid = 12445456 | doi = | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transcription regulation ===

Calreticulin is also found in the nucleus, suggesting that it may have a role in transcription regulation. Calreticulin binds to the [[synthetic peptide]] KLGFFKR, which is almost identical to an amino acid sequence in the [[DNA-binding domain]] of the superfamily of [[nuclear receptor]]s. The [[N-terminus|amino terminus]] of calreticulin interacts with the DNA-binding domain of the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] and prevents the receptor from binding to its specific [[glucocorticoid response element]]. Calreticulin can inhibit the binding of [[androgen receptor]] to its hormone-responsive DNA element and can inhibit androgen receptor and [[retinoic acid receptor]] transcriptional activities in vivo, as well as retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation. Thus, calreticulin can act as an important modulator of the regulation of gene transcription by nuclear hormone receptors.

== Clinical significance ==

Calreticulin binds to [[antibody|antibodies]] in certain sera of [[Lupus erythematosus|systemic lupus]] and [[Sjögren's syndrome|Sjogren]] patients that contain anti-Ro/SSA antibodies. Systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with increased autoantibody titers against calreticulin, but calreticulin is not a Ro/SS-A antigen. Earlier papers referred to calreticulin as an Ro/SS-A antigen, but this was later disproven. Increased autoantibody titer against human calreticulin is found in infants with complete congenital heart block of both the [[IgG]] and [[IgM]] classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: CALR calreticulin| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=811| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in cancer ==

Calreticulin (CRT) is expressed in many cancer cells and plays a role to promote [[macrophage]]s to engulf hazardous cancerous cells. The reason why most of the cells are not destroyed, is the presence of another molecule with signal [[CD47]], which blocks CRT.  Hence antibodies that block CD47 might be useful as a cancer treatment. In mice models of [[myeloid leukemia]] and [[non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma]], anti-CD47 were effective in clearing cancer cells while normal cells were unaffected.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21178137&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chao MP, Jaiswal S, Weissman-Tsukamoto R, Alizadeh AA, Gentles AJ, Volkmer J, Weiskopf K, Willingham SB, Raveh T, Park CY, Majeti R, Weissman IL | title = Calreticulin is the dominant pro-phagocytic signal on multiple human cancers and is counterbalanced by CD47 | journal = Sci Transl Med | volume = 2 | issue = 63 | pages = 63ra94 | year = 2010 | month = December | pmid = 21178137 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.3001375 | laysummary = http://med.stanford.edu/ism/2010/december/crt-signal.html | laysource = Stanford School of Medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''crannóg''' ({{IPA-ga|ˈkɾˠan̪ˠoːɡ}}), or preferably ''crannog'', the most commonly accepted form in both Ireland and Scotland&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan, A. 2000. Crannogs: Lake Dwellings of Ireland, Irish Treasure Series, Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, C. J. 1983.  ‘Some 'early' ring forts and crannogs’, Journal of Irish Archaeology, vol. 1, pp. 47-58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, T.N. 2004.

Landscape with Lake Dwellings, University Press, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;, is typically a partially or entirely [[artificial island]], usually built in [[lake]]s, [[river]]s and [[estuarine]] waters. Crannogs were used as dwellings over five millennia from the [[Neolithic#Europe|European Neolithic]]&lt;ref&gt;Armit, I. 2003. ‘The Drowners: permanence and transience in the Hebridean Neolithic,’ in Armit, I, Murphy, E. and Simpson, D (eds.)

The Crannogs of Scotland, Tempus, Stroud.&lt;/ref&gt; although in Scotland, Bronze Age and Norse Period use is not apparent in the archaeological record.

The Crannogs of Scotland, Tempus, Stroud.&lt;/ref&gt;,although more commonly they exist as brush, stone or timber mounds which can be revetted with timber piles. However, in areas such as the Western Isles of Scotland, timber was unavailable from the Neolithic onwards&lt;ref&gt;Edwards K J &amp; Ralston I (eds.) 1997. Scotland After the Ice Age: Environment, Archaeology and History, 8000 BC-1000 AD Wiley &amp; Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;. As a result, completely stone crannogs supporting drystone architecture are common here. &lt;ref&gt;Armit, I. 1996. ''The Archaeology of Skye and the Western Isles'', University Press, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;. Today, crannogs typically appear as small, circular islets, often {{convert|10|to|30|m|sigfig=1}} in diameter, covered in dense vegetation due to their inaccessibility to grazing livestock.

==Etymology and uncertain meanings==
The commonly accepted modern term crannog, and the less-used Irish spelling ''crannóg'' (and the [[Scottish Gaelic]] term ''crannag'') and [[Middle Irish]] ''crannóc'' stems from ''crann'' meaning &quot;tree&quot; plus a [[diminutive]] ending-literally 'young tree'&lt;ref&gt;Fredengren, C. 2002. ''Crannogs: a study of people's interaction with lakes, with special reference to Loch Gara in the North West of Ireland'' Wordwell, Bray&lt;/ref&gt;. This term first appears sometime around the 12th century; its popularity spread in the medieval period along with the terms ''isle'', ''ylle'', ''inis'', ''eilean'', ''oileán'' &lt;ref&gt;Morrison, I. 1985. Landscape with Lake Dwellings, University Press, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A New History of Ireland: Prehistoric and early Ireland'' By Theodore William Moody et al. &lt;/ref&gt; There is some confusion on what the term crannog originally referred to, the structure atop the island or the island itself&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, I. 1985. Landscape with Lake Dwellings, University Press, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; The additional meanings of crannog can be variously related as ''structure/piece of wood; wooden pin; [[crow's nest]]; [[pulpit]]; driver's box on a coach and vessel/box/chest'' for crannóg.&lt;ref&gt;Dinneen, P. ''Foclóir Gaedhilge agus Béarla'' (1927, reprinted 1979) [[Irish Texts Society]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scottish Gaelic]] form is ''crannag'' and has the additional meanings of [[pulpit]] and [[churn]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark, C. ''The Gaelic English Dictionary'' [[Routledge]] (2004) ISBN 0-415-29761-3&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is clear there is no real consensus of what the term 'crannog' actually implies, although the modern adoption in the English language broadly refers to a partially or completely artificial islet which saw use from the prehistoric to the Post-Medieval period in Ireland and Scotland&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, I. 1985. ''Landscape with Lake Dwellings'', University Press, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Location==
Crannogs are widespread in [[Ireland]] with an estimated 1200 examples &lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, A. 1998. The Archaeology of Lake Settlement in Ireland, Discovery Programme, Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Scotland]] 'officially' contains 347 sites listed as such. [http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/results/?sitename=&amp;site_type_term=CRANNOG+&amp;site_discipline=1&amp;numlink=&amp;mapno=&amp;site=&amp;council_code=&amp;parish=&amp;region_code=&amp;district_code=&amp;county_code=&amp;ngr=&amp;locat_xy_radius_m=&amp;collection_name=&amp;biblio_surname=&amp;biblio_inits=&amp;biblio_title=&amp;biblio_date=&amp;biblio_journal=&amp;site_country=1&amp;submit=Search Canmore Database/Royal Commission on Ancient and Historic Monuments Scotland]. The actual number in Scotland varies considerably-between approximately 350 to 500 due to the use of the term 'island dun' for well over one hundred Hebridean examples-a distinction that has created a divide between mainland Scottish crannog and Hebridean islet settlement studies&lt;ref&gt;Harding, D. W. 2000.  ‘Crannogs and Island Duns: classification, dating and function’, Oxford Journal of Archaeology, vol. 19, no. 3. pp. 301-317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harding, D.W. 2007. ‘Crannogs and island duns: an aerial perspective’  In: Barber, J., Clarke, C., Crone, A., Hale, A, Henderson, J., Housley, R., Sands, R., Sheridan, A., (eds). Archaeology From The Wetlands: Proceedings of the 11th WARP Conference, Edinburgh 2007. Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, pp. 267-273.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously unknown crannogs in Scotland and Ireland are still being found as underwater survey continues to investigate loch beds for completely submerged examples&lt;ref&gt;Lenfert, R (2009a) 'Uist Island Dun Investigation - Dun Borosdale, Western Isles (South Uist parish), preliminary investigation', Discovery Excav Scot, New, vol.10 Cathedral Communications Limited, Wiltshire, England. &lt;/ref&gt; The largest concentrations of crannogs in Ireland are found in the Drumlin Belt of the midlands, the north and the northwest. In Scotland, crannogs favour a western or 'Atlantic distribution', with high concentrations in Argyll and Dumfries and Galloway&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J. C. 1998, ‘Islets through time: the definition, dating and distribution of Scottish crannogs’, Oxford Journal of Archaeology, vol. 17, no. 2, pp. 227-244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J. C. 2000. ‘Shared Traditions? The Drystone Settlement Records of Atlantic Scotland and Ireland 700 BC- AD 200,’ J. C. Henderson, ed., BAR 861, Oxford, pp. 117-154.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the Western Isles contains the highest density of lake-settlement in Scotland, yet they are recognised under varying terms besides crannog&lt;ref&gt;Armit, I. 1992.  The Later Prehistory of the Western Isles of Scotland; Oxford: BAR Brit Ser. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;. One lone Welsh example at [[Llangorse Lake]] exists, likely a product of Irish influence across the Irish Sea&lt;ref&gt;Redknap, Mark and Alan Lane. 1994. ‘The Early Medieval crannog at Llangors, Powys: an interim statement on the 1989-1993 seasons’ . The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology 23(3):189-205. &lt;/ref&gt;

Reconstructed Irish crannógs are located in [[Craggaunowen]], [[Ireland]]; the [[Irish National Heritage Park]], in [[Wexford, Ireland]]; and in Scotland at the &quot;Scottish Crannog Centre&quot; at Loch Tay, Perthshire. This centre offers guided tours and hands-on activities, including wool spinning, wood-turning and making fire, holds events to celebrate wild cooking and crafts, and hosts yearly [[Midsummer]], [[Lughnasadh]] and [[Samhain]] festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crannog.co.uk &quot;The Scottish Crannog Centre&quot;]. www.crannog.co.uk. Retrieved 16 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and problems with definition==
[[Image:Crannog Loch Tay.jpg|thumb|right|Replica Crannóg on [[Loch Tay]]]]In reality, crannogs took on many different forms and methods of construction based upon what was available in the immediate landscape; there is no single 'correct' way to construct a crannog. The classic image of a prehistoric crannog stems from both Post-Medieval illustrations&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, A. 1998. The Archaeology of Lake Settlement in Ireland, Discovery Programme, Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt; and highly influential excavations such as Milton Loch in Scotland by C.M. Piggot after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Piggott, C. M. 1953. ‘Milton Loch Crannog: a native house of the second century AD in Kirkcudbrightshire’, Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, vol. 87, pp. 134-52&lt;/ref&gt; The Milton Loch interpretation is of a small islet surrounded or defined at its edges by timber piles and a gangway, topped by a typical Iron Age roundhouse. The choice of a small islet as a home may seem odd today, yet waterways were the main channels for both communication and travel until the 19th century in much of Ireland and especially Highland Scotland. Crannogs are traditionally interpreted as being simple farmsteads in prehistory. Additional interpretations see them used as boltholes in times of danger, as status symbols with limited access and as inherited locations of power which imply a sense of legitimacy and ancestry towards ownership of the surrounding landscape. 

If one employs the strict, limited definition of crannog which requires the use of timber,&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, C. J. 1983.  &quot;Some 'early' ring forts and crannogs&quot;, ''Journal of Irish Archaeology'', vol. 1, pp. 47–58.&lt;/ref&gt; then sites in the Western Isles are stricken from the discussion. This caveat regarding definition has caused some debate over the years while the exclusion of Hebridean sites from most major syntheses can be seen as a shortcoming which fails to unite the common concept of living on water due to superficial typologies.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, C. J. 1983.  ‘Some 'early' ring forts and crannogs’, Journal of Irish Archaeology, vol. 1, pp. 47-58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harding, D. W. 2000.  ‘Crannogs and Island Duns: classification, dating and function’, Oxford Journal of Archaeology, vol. 19, no. 3. pp. 301-317.&lt;/ref&gt; If not 'true' crannogs, small occupied islets (often at least partially artificial in nature) may be referred to as island duns,&lt;ref&gt;Armit, I. 1996. ''The Archaeology of Skye and the Western Isles'', University Press, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; although rather confusingly, 22 islet-based sites are classified as 'proper' crannogs due to the different interpretations of the inspectors or excavators who drew up field reports [http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/results/?sitename=&amp;site_type_term=CRANNOG+&amp;site_discipline=1&amp;numlink=&amp;mapno=&amp;site=&amp;council_code=410&amp;parish=&amp;region_code=&amp;district_code=&amp;county_code=&amp;ngr=&amp;locat_xy_radius_m=&amp;collection_name=&amp;biblio_surname=&amp;biblio_inits=&amp;biblio_title=&amp;biblio_date=&amp;biblio_journal=&amp;site_country=1&amp;submit=Search Canmore search for crannog in the Western Isles] Hebridean island dwellings or crannogs were commonly built on both natural and artificial islets, usually reached by means of a stone causeway. The visible structural remains are traditionally interpreted&lt;ref&gt;Beveridge, E. 1911. North Uist: Its Archaeology and Topography, William Brown, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[dun]], or by the more recent terminology as an ''Atlantic roundhouse''. This terminology has gained in recent popularity when describing the entire range of robust, drystone structures which exist in later prehistoric Atlantic Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Armit, I. 1992.  The Later Prehistory of the Western Isles of Scotland; Oxford: BAR Brit Ser. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of crannog excavations were poorly conducted (by modern standards) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by early antiquarians, or were indeed purely accidental finds as lochs were drained during the improvements to increase usable farmland or pasture &lt;ref&gt;Munro, R. 1882.

IX, pp. 388-92.&lt;/ref&gt;. Some early digs merely saw labourers haul away tons of materials with little regard to anything that was not of immediate economic value. Conversely, the vast majority of early attempts at proper excavation  techniques failed to accurately measure or record stratigraphy, thereby failing to provide a secure context for artefact finds making interpretations extremely limited in scope. Preservation and conservation techniques for waterlogged materials such as logboats or structural material were all but non-existent and a number of extremely important finds perished as a result, in some instances dried out for firewood&lt;ref&gt;Munro, R. 1882.  Ancient Scottish Lake Dwellings, or Crannogs, David Douglas, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;. The years from approximately 1900 to the late 1940's saw very little in the way of crannog excavation in Scotland while Ireland did witness some important and highly-influential contributions&lt;ref&gt;Hencken, H.

This has direct implications for the way in which the re-occupiers perhaps viewed crannogs as a legacy that remained alive in local tradition and memory. The importance of crannog reoccupation is therefore evident and full of meaning, especially when many instances see crannogs built near natural islets that were often completely unused. 
This long chronology of use has been verified by both radiocarbon dating and more precisely, by dendrochronology&lt;ref&gt;Crone, B. A. 2000. The History of a Scottish Lowland Crannog: Excavations at Buiston, Ayrshire, 1989-90, STAR Monograph 4, AOC/Historic Scotland, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;. Intrepretations of crannog function are not static through time; instead they appear to change in both the archaeological and historic records. Rather than largely simple domestic residences in prehistory, Medieval crannogs were increasingly seen as strongholds of the upper class or regional 'political players' such as Gaelic chieftains like the O'Boylans and McMahons in County [[Monaghan]] and the ancient Kingdom of [[Airgíalla]] up until the 17th century. In Scotland, their medieval use is also well documented into the early 18th century&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, I. 1985.

==History==
The earliest construction of a crannog is the completely artificial Neolithic islet of [[Eilean Domhnuill]], Loch Olabhat on [[North Uist]] in Scotland. Eilean Domhnuill (pronounced 'Ellen Donall'&lt;ref&gt;Armit, I. 1996. The Archaeology of Skye and the Western Isles, University Press, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;) has produced radiocarbon dates ranging from 3650-2500 [[Before Christ|BC]] &lt;ref&gt;Armit, I. 2003. ‘The Drowners: permanence and transience in the Hebridean Neolithic,’ in Armit, I, Murphy, E. and Simpson, D (eds.) Neolithic Settlement in Ireland and Western Britain, Oxbow, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; while Irish crannogs appear from middle Bronze Age layers at Ballinderry (1200-600BC)&lt;ref&gt;national handbook of underwater archaeology By Carol Ruppé, Jan Barstadch&lt;/ref&gt;. Prior to the Bronze Age, the existence of artificial island settlement in Ireland is not as clear. While lake-side settlements are evident in Ireland from 4500BC these settlements are not crannogs in that they were not intended to be islands. Despite having a tremendous chronology, their use was not at all consistent or unchanging.  Crannog construction and occupation reached a flourit in Scotland from approximately 800BC to AD200&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J. C. 1998, ‘Islets through time: the definition, dating and distribution of Scottish crannogs’, Oxford Journal of Archaeology, vol. 17, no. 2, pp. 227-244.&lt;/ref&gt;. Not surprisingly, crannogs have useful defensive properties, although there appears to be more significance to prehistoric use than simple defense as very few weapons or evidence for destruction appear in excavations of prehistoric crannogs. In Ireland, crannogs tend to reach a flourit during the Early Historic period&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan, A. 2000. Crannogs: Lake Dwellings of Ireland, Irish Treasure Series, Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt; when they were the homes and retreats of kings, lords, prosperous farmers and occasionally socially marginalised groups such as monastic hermits or metalsmiths who could work in isolation. However, despite earlier concepts of a strict Early Historic evoloution&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, C. J. 1983.  ‘Some 'early' ring forts and crannogs’, Journal of Irish Archaeology, vol. 1, pp. 47-58.&lt;/ref&gt;, Irish excavations are increasingly uncovering examples which date to the 'missing' Iron Age in Ireland&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan, A. &amp; Sands, R. 2007. ‘Impressive, well appointed, rich and enigmatic: Collure Demense crannog, Lough Derravaragh, County Westmeath’ in: Barber, J., Clarke, C., Crone, A., Hale, A, Henderson, J., Housley, R., Sands, R., Sheridan, A., (eds).

==Construction==
[[Image:Loughbrickland Crannog.jpg|thumb|[[Loughbrickland Crannóg]] in [[Northern Ireland]].]]
The construction techniques for a crannog (prehistoric or otherwise) are as varied as the multitude of finished forms witnessed in the archaeological record. Island settlement in Scotland and Ireland is manifest through the entire range of possibilities ranging from entirely natural, small islets to completely artificial islets, therefore definitions will invariably remain contentious. For 'crannogs' in the strict sense, typically this effort began on a shallow reef or rise in the lochbed. When timber was available, many were surrounded by a circle of wooden [[Deep foundation|piles]] with axe-sharpened bases that were driven into the bottom, forming a circular enclosure that helped to retain the main mound and prevent erosion. The piles could also be joined together by mortise and tenon, or large holes cut to carefully accept specially shaped timbers designed to interlock together and provide structural rigidity. On other examples, interior surfaces were built up with any mixture of clay, peat, stone, timber or brush-what ever was available. In some instances, more than one structure was built on crannogs&lt;ref&gt;Armit, I. 2003a. ‘The Drowners: permanence and transience in the Hebridean Neolithic,’ in Armit, I, Murphy, E. and Simpson, D (eds.) Neolithic Settlement in Ireland and Western Britain, Oxbow, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;. Other types of crannogs simply saw the occupants add large stones to the waterline of small natural islets, extending and enlarging them over successive phases of renewal.
Larger crannogs could be occupied by extended families or communal groups, and access was either by logboats or coracles while evidence for timber or stone causeways exists on a large number of crannogs. The causeways themselves may have been slightly submerged; this has been interpreted as a device to make access difficult&lt;ref&gt;Beveridge, E. 1911. North Uist: Its Archaeology and Topography, William Brown, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; yet this can also simply be a by-product of loch level fluctuations over the ensuing centuries or indeed millennia. Organic remains are often found in excellent condition on these water-logged sites. The bones of [[cattle]], [[deer]], and [[Pig|swine]] have been found in excavated crannogs while remains of wooden utensils and even dairy products can remain completely preserved for several millennia&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, T.N. 2004. The Crannogs of Scotland, Tempus, Stroud.&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Selfref|For the use of dates on Wikipedia, see the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Dates|Manual of Style]].}}
A '''date''' in a calendar is a reference to a particular day represented within a [[calendar]] system. The calendar date allows the specific day to be identified. The number of days between two dates may be calculated. For example, &quot;24 January 2011&quot; is ten days after &quot;14 January 2011&quot; in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. The date of a particular event depends on the observed [[UTC offset]]. For example the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] that began at 1941-12-07T18:18Z took place on 7 December according to [[Hawaii Time]] ([[UTC-10:30]]), and on 8 December according to [[Japan Standard Time]] ([[UTC+09]]).

A particular day may be represented by a different date in another calendar as in the Gregorian calendar and the [[Julian calendar]], which have been used simultaneously in different places. In most calendar systems, the date consists of three parts: the ''day of month'', ''month'', and the ''year''. There may also be additional parts, such as the ''day of week''. Years are usually counted from a particular starting point, usually called the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], with [[era]] referring to the particular period of time (Note [[geologic time scale|the different use]] of the terms in [[geology]]).

The most widely used epoch is a [[Convention (norm)|conventional]] [[Historical Jesus#Birth|birthdate of Jesus]] (which was established by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in the sixth century). A date without the year part may also be referred to as a ''date'' or ''calendar date'' (such as &quot;{{CURRENTDAY}} January&quot; rather than &quot;{{CURRENTDAY}} January 2011&quot;). As such, it defines the day of an annual event, such as a birthday or Christmas on 25 December.

==Date format==
&lt;!--Linked from [[Endianness]]; please update there if section title changed--&gt;
{{See also|Date format by country}}
Related to the classification of a day as a specific calendar date is the format used to express that date. The differing formats of dates are an example of [[endianness]]. Even for a specific calendar system, different formats are used. For example, the following formats all express the same date in the Gregorian calendar.

===Little endian forms, starting with the day===
This sequence is common to the vast majority of the world's countries. This date format originates from the custom of writing the date as 'the 9th day of November in the year of our Lord 2003' in western religious and legal documents, which at one time were the majority of documents created. The format has shortened over time but the order of the elements has remained constant.

*&quot;9 November 2003&quot; or &quot;9. November 2003&quot; (the latter is common in German-speaking regions)
*9/11/2003 or 9.11.2003
*09-Nov-2003 (used in the USA)
*9-11-2003 (used in parts of [[Ireland]] and [[United Kingdom]], and is accepted in [[South Africa]], [[Australia]] &amp; [[New Zealand]])
*[The] 9th [of] November 2003 (The 'of' and 'the' may be included in speech; they are omitted in all but the most formal writing.)
*Sunday, 9 November 2003
*9/xi/03, 9.xi.03, 9-xi.03, or 9.XI.2003 (using the [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] for the month) – This is usually confined to handwriting only and is not put into any form of print. It is associated with a number of schools and universities. It has also been used by the Vatican as an alternative to using months named after Roman deities.
*9 November 2003 [[Anno Domini|AD]]

===Big endian forms, starting with the year===
In this format the most significant data item is written before lesser data items i.e. year before month before day. It is consistent with the big endianness of the [[Indian decimal numbering system]], which progresses from the highest to the lowest order magnitude. That is, using this format textual orderings and chronological orderings are identical. This form is standard in Asian countries, Hungary, Sweden and the [[US armed forces]].

Examples for the 9th of November 2003:
*2003-11-09: the '''[[ISO 8601]]''' [[International standard|'''international standard''']] orders the components of a date like this, and additionally uses leading zeros, for example, 0813-03-01, to be easily read and sorted by computers. It is used with [[UTC]] in the '''Internet date/time format''' (see the [[#External links|external link below]]). This format is also favoured in certain [[Asia]]n countries, mainly [[East Asian]] countries, as well as in some European countries. The big endian convention is also frequently used in [[Canada]], but all three conventions are used there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdnpay.ca/news/new_cheque_specs.asp Canadian Payments Association – Specifications for Imageable Cheques and Other Payment Items&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*2003 November 9
*2003Nov9
*2003Nov09
*2003-Nov-9
*2003-Nov-09
*2003-Nov-9, Sunday
*2003. november 9. – The official format in [[Hungary]], point after year and day, month name with small initial. Following shorter formats also can be used: 2003. nov. 9., 2003. 11. 9., 2003. XI. 9.
*2003.11.9 using dots and no leading zeros, common in [[China]]
It is also extended through the universal big-endian format clock time: 9 November 2003, 18h 14m 12s, or 2003/11/9/18:14:12 or (ISO 8601) 2003-11-09T18:14:12.

===Middle endian forms, starting with the month===
This sequence is used primarily in the United States, Canada, and a few other countries. This date format was commonly used alongside the small endian form in the United Kingdom until the early 20th Century, and can be found in both defunct and modern print media such as the [[London Gazette]] and [[The Times]], respectively. In the UK, it would be verbally expressed as '''Sunday, November the 9th''', whereas in the United States and Canada, it is usually '''Sunday, November 9th''', although usage of &quot;the&quot; isn't uncommon.

*Sunday, November 9, 2003
*November 9, 2003
*Nov. 9, 2003 or Nov/9/2003
*11-9-2003, 11.9.2003, 11.09.03, or 11/09/03

===Usage issues===
The many numerical forms can create confusion when used in international correspondence, particularly when abbreviating the year to its final two digits.

For example, '9/11' can refer to both [[Berlin Wall#The Fall|'The fall of the Berlin Wall']] on 9 November 1989 and to [[September 11 attacks]]. In the [[United States]], dates are rarely written in purely numerical forms in formal writing. In the United Kingdom, while it is regarded as acceptable to write ''monthname day, year'', this order is never used when written numerically, although, due to American media influence, the American shorthand &quot;9/11&quot; is widely understood as referring to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-ADOT&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/americas/2001/day_of_terror/ BBC News – America's Day of Terror&quot;] (Example of British website using &quot;9/11&quot; shorthand)&lt;/ref&gt;

When numbers are used to represent months, a significant amount of confusion can arise from the ambiguity of a date order; especially when the numbers representing the day, month or year are low, it can be impossible to tell which order is being used. This can be clarified by using four digits to represent years, and naming the month; for example, &quot;Feb&quot; instead of &quot;02&quot;. Many Internet sites use year-month-day, and those using other conventions often write out the month (9-MAY-2001, MAY 09 2001, and so on.) so there is no ambiguity. The ISO 8601 date order, with four-digit years, is specifically chosen to be unambiguous. The ISO 8601 standard also has the advantage of being language independent and is therefore useful when there may be no language context and a universal application is desired (expiration dating on export products, for example).

In addition, the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] considers its [[ISO 8601]] standard to make sense from a logical perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.iso.org/iso/date_and_time_format | accessdate=2008-04-27 | title=Numeric representation of Dates and Time }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed units, for example feet and inches, or pounds and ounces, are normally written with the largest unit first, in decreasing order. Numbers are also written in that order, so the digits of 2006 indicate, in order, the millennium, the century within the millennium, the decade within the century, and the year within the decade. The only date order that is consistent with these well-established conventions is year-month-day. A plain text list of dates with this format can be easily sorted by [[word processor]]s, [[spreadsheet]]s and other software tools with built-in sorting functions.

An early U.S. [[Federal Information Processing Standard]] recommended 2-digit years. This is now widely recognized as a bad idea, because of the [[year 2000 problem]]. Some U.S. government agencies now use [[ISO 8601]] with 4 digit year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyecounty.net/iso8601.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iprocessmart.com/techsmart/iso-time.htm International Standard Date and Time Notation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

When transitioning from one date notation to another, people often write both [[Old Style and New Style dates]].

==World locations by date format in use==
{{See also|Date and time notation by country|Date notation by country}}

==Advantages for ordering in sequence==
One of the advantages of using the [[ISO 8601]] [[standardization|standard]] date format is that the [[lexicographical order]] ([[ASCIIbetical]]) of the representations is equivalent to the chronological order of the dates. Thus dates can be sorted using simple string comparison algorithms, and indeed by any left to right [[collation]]. For example:

 1998-02-28 (28 February 1998) sorts before
 1999-03-01 ( 1 March  1999) which sorts before
 2000-01-30 (30 January 2000)

The YYYY MM DD layout is the only common format that can provide this.&lt;ref name=W3CFAQ&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-date-format | accessdate=2008-10-21 | title=FAQ: Date formats | publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorting other date representations involves some [[parsing]] of the date strings. This also works when a time in 24-hour format is included after the date, as long as all times are understood to be in the same time zone.

ISO 8601 is used widely where concise, human readable yet easily computable and unambiguous dates are required, although many applications store dates internally as [[UNIX time]] and only convert to ISO 8601 for display. It is worth noting that all modern computer [[Operating Systems]] retain date information of files outside of their titles, allowing the user to choose which format they prefer and have them sorted thus, irrespective of the files' names.

==Specialized usage==
===Day and year only===
{{See also|calendar|time|date-time group|Japanese calendar|Wikibooks:English:Time}}

The U.S. military sometimes uses a system, which they call &quot;Julian date format&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hynes, John (?). A summary of time formats and standards. Retrieved on 2011-02-09 from http://www.decimaltime.hynes.net/p/dates.html.&lt;/ref&gt; that indicates the year and the actual day out of the 365 days of the year (and thus a designation of the month would not be needed). For example, &quot;11 December 1999&quot; can be written in some contexts as &quot;1999345&quot; or &quot;99345&quot;, for the 345th day of 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Markus (2004-12-19). A summary of the international standard date and time notation. University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. Retrieved on 2006-08-01 from http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html.&lt;/ref&gt; This system is most often used in US military logistics, since it makes the process of calculating estimated shipping and arrival dates easier. For example: say a tank engine takes an estimated 35 days to ship by sea from the US to Korea. If the engine is sent on 99104, it should arrive on 99139. Note that outside of the US military, this format is usually referred to as &quot;[[ordinal date]]&quot;, rather than &quot;Julian date&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Such ordinal date formats are also used by many computer programs (especially those for mainframe systems). Using a three-digit [[Julian date|Julian day number]] saves one byte of computer storage over a two-digit month plus two-digit day, for example,, &quot;January 17&quot; is 017 in Julian versus 0117 in month-day format. [[OS/390]] or its successor, [[z/OS]], display dates in yy.ddd format for most operations. It is important to not confuse any of these formats with [[UNIX time]], which stores time as a number in seconds since 1970-01-01.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Another &quot;ordinal&quot; date system (&quot;ordinal&quot; in the sense of advancing in value by one as the date advances by one day) is in common use in astronomical calculations and referencing and uses the same name as this &quot;logistics&quot; system. The continuity of representation of period regardless of the time of year being considered is obviously highly useful to both groups of specialists. The astronomers describe their system too as being a &quot;Julian date&quot;, and it is described in more detail in the article [[Julian date]]. Unlike the system described above, the astronomical system does not consider years, it only counts days. Thus it is unperturbed by complications such as leap years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Week number used===
Companies in Europe often use year, week number and day for planning purposes.
So, for example, an event in a project can happen on w43 (week 43) or w43-1 (Monday, week 43) or, if the year needs to be indicated, on w0543 or w543 (year 2005 week 43).

The ISO does present a standard for [[ISO week date|identifying weeks]], but as it does not match up with Gregorian calendar (the beginning and ending days of a given year do not match up), this standard is somewhat more problematic than the other standards for dates.

===Expressing dates in spoken English===
In [[British English]], full dates are usually written as ''7 December 1941'' (or ''7th December 1941'') and spoken as &quot;the seventh of December, nineteen forty-one&quot; (exceedingly common usage of &quot;the&quot; and &quot;of&quot;), with the occasional usage of ''December 7, 1941'' (&quot;December the seventh, nineteen forty-one&quot;). In common with continental European usage, however, all-numeric dates are invariably ordered dd/mm/yyyy.

In the [[United States]], the usual written form is ''December 7, 1941'', spoken as &quot;December seventh, nineteen forty-one&quot; or colloquially &quot;December the seventh, nineteen forty-one&quot;. [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|Ordinal]] numerals, however, are not always used when writing and pronouncing dates, and &quot;December seven, nineteen forty-one&quot; is also an accepted pronunciation of the date written ''December 7, 1941''. A notable exception to this rule is the [[Fourth of July]].

A cist may have been associated with other monuments, perhaps under a [[cairn]] or long [[tumulus|barrow]].  It would not be uncommon to find several cists close together within the same cairn or barrow. Often ornaments have been found within an excavated cist, indicating the wealth or prominence of the interred individual.

In Devonshire a local word for a cist in [[Cornish language|Modern Cornish]] is ''[[kistvaen]]''. There are numerous [[Dartmoor kistvaens]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Dihedral group of order 8; Cayley table (element orders 1,2,2,2,2,4,4,2); subgroup of S4.svg|thumb|[[Cayley table]] of [[Dihedral group of order 8|Dih&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;The center is {0,7}: Row 7 is the [[transpose]] of column 7, and the entries 7 are symmetric to the main diagonal. (Only for the neutral element this is granted in all groups.)]]
In [[abstract algebra]], the '''centre''' of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'', denoted ''Z''(''G''),&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The notation ''Z'' is from German ''[[wikt:Zentrum|Zentrum]],'' meaning &quot;centre&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of elements that [[Commutative|commute]] with every element of ''G''.  In [[set-builder notation]],

:&lt;math&gt;Z(G) = \{z \in G \mid \forall g\in G, zg = gz \}&lt;/math&gt;.

The centre is a [[subgroup]] of ''G'', which by definition is [[abelian group|abelian]] (that is commutative).  As a subgroup, it is always [[normal subgroup|normal]], and indeed [[characteristic subgroup|characteristic]], but it need not be [[fully characteristic subgroup|fully characteristic]].  The [[quotient group]] ''G''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''Z''(''G'') is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the group of [[inner automorphism]]s of ''G''.

A group ''G'' is abelian if and only if ''Z''(''G'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''G''.  At the other extreme, a group is said to be '''centreless''' if ''Z''(''G'') is trivial, i.e. consists only of the [[identity element]].

The elements of the centre are sometimes called '''central'''.

==As a subgroup==
The center of ''G'' is always a [[subgroup]] of ''G''.  In particular:
#''Z''(''G'') contains ''e'', the [[identity element]] of ''G'', because ''eg'' = ''g'' = ''ge'' for all ''g'' ∈ G by definition of ''e'', so by definition of ''Z''(''G''), ''e'' ∈ ''Z''(''G'');
#If ''x'' and ''y'' are in ''Z''(''G''), then (''xy'')''g'' = ''x''(''yg'') = ''x''(''gy'') = (''xg'')''y'' = (''gx'')''y'' = ''g''(''xy'') for each ''g'' ∈ ''G'', and so ''xy'' is in ''Z''(''G'') as well (i.e., ''Z''(''G'') exhibits closure);
#If ''x'' is in ''Z''(''G''), then ''gx'' = ''xg'', and multiplying twice, once on the left and once on the right, by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, gives ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''g'' = ''gx''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; — so ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ∈ ''Z''(''G'').
Furthermore the center of ''G'' is always a [[normal subgroup]] of ''G'', as it is closed under [[Conjugate closure|conjugation]].

==Conjugation==
Consider the map ''f'': ''G'' → Aut(''G'') from ''G'' to the [[automorphism group]] of ''G'' defined by ''f''(''g'') = &amp;#966;&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;, where &amp;#966;&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; is the automorphism of ''G'' defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_g(h) = ghg^{-1} \,&lt;/math&gt;.
This is a [[group homomorphism]], and its [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is precisely the center of ''G'', and its image is called the [[inner automorphism group]] of ''G'', denoted Inn(''G''). By the [[first isomorphism theorem]] we get
:&lt;math&gt;G/Z(G)\cong \rm{Inn}(G).&lt;/math&gt;
The [[cokernel]] of this map is the group &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Out}(G)&lt;/math&gt; of [[outer automorphism]]s, and these form the [[exact sequence]]
:&lt;math&gt;1 \to Z(G) \to G \to \operatorname{Aut}(G) \to \operatorname{Out}(G) \to 1.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
* The center of an [[abelian group]] ''G'' is all of ''G''.
* The center of a [[Nonabelian group|nonabelian]] [[simple group]] is trivial.
* The center of the [[dihedral group]] D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is trivial when ''n'' is odd.  When ''n'' is even, the center consists of the identity element together with the 180&amp;deg; rotation of the [[polygon]].
* The center of the [[quaternion group]] &lt;math&gt;Q_8 = \{1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k\}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{1, -1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The center of the [[symmetric group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is trivial for ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;3.
* The center of the [[alternating group]] ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is trivial for ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;4.
* The center of the [[general linear group]] &lt;math&gt;\mbox{GL}_n(F)&lt;/math&gt; is the collection of [[Diagonal matrix|scalar matrices]] &lt;math&gt;\{ sI_n | s \in F\setminus\{0\} \}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The center of the [[orthogonal group]] &lt;math&gt;O(n, F)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{ I_n,-I_n \}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The center of the multiplicative group of non-zero [[quaternion]]s is the multiplicative group of non-zero real numbers.
* Using the [[class equation]] one can prove that the center of any non-trivial [[finite group|finite]] [[p-group]] is non-trivial.
* If the [[quotient group]] &lt;math&gt;G/Z(G)&lt;/math&gt; is [[cyclic group|cyclic]], G is [[abelian group|abelian]] (and so G = Z(G), and &lt;math&gt;G/Z(G)&lt;/math&gt; is trivial).

==Higher centers==
Quotienting out by the center of a group yields a sequence of groups called the '''[[upper central series]]''':
:&lt;math&gt;G_0 = G \to G_1 = G_0/Z(G_0) \to G_2 = G_1/Z(G_1) \to \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
The kernel of the map &lt;math&gt;G \to G_i&lt;/math&gt; is the '''''i''th center''' of ''G'' ('''second center''', '''third center''', etc.), and is denoted &lt;math&gt;Z^i(G).&lt;/math&gt; Concretely, the &lt;math&gt;(i+1)&lt;/math&gt;-st center are the terms that commute with all elements up to an element of the ''i''th center. Following this definition, one can define the 0th center of a group to be the identity subgroup. This can be continued to [[transfinite ordinals]] by [[transfinite induction]]; the union of all the higher centers is called the '''[[hypercenter]]'''.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;This union will include transfinite terms if the UCS does not stabilize at a finite stage.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ascending chain of subgroups
:&lt;math&gt;1 \leq Z(G) \leq Z^2(G) \leq \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
stabilizes at ''i'' (equivalently, &lt;math&gt;Z^i(G) = Z^{i+1}(G)&lt;/math&gt;) [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;G_i&lt;/math&gt; is centerless.

===Examples===
*For a centerless group, all higher centers are zero, which is the case &lt;math&gt;Z^0(G)=Z^1(G)&lt;/math&gt; of stabilization.
*By [[Grün's lemma]], the quotient of a [[perfect group]] by its center is centerless, hence all higher centers equal the center. This is a case of stabilization at &lt;math&gt;Z^1(G)=Z^2(G)&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Commonwealth of England''' was the [[republic]] which ruled first [[Kingdom of England|England]], and then [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] from 1649 to 1660. Between 1653–1659 it was known as the '''Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/scotland/01_laws.php |title=Scotland and the Commonwealth: 1651–1660 |publisher=Archontology.org |date=2010-03-14 |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[English Civil War]] and the [[regicide#The regicide of Charles I of England|execution]] of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], the republic's existence was initially declared by &quot;An Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:An Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth]]&lt;/ref&gt; adopted by the [[Rump Parliament]], on 19 May 1649. Executive power had already been entrusted to a [[English Council of State|Council of State]]. The government during 1653 to 1659 is properly called [[The Protectorate]], and took the form of direct personal rule by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and, after his death, his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]], as [[Lord Protector]]; this arrangement led to the state being labelled a &quot;[[crowned republic]]&quot;. The term Commonwealth is, however, loosely used to describe the system of government during the whole of 1649 to 1660, when England was ''[[de facto]]'', and arguably ''[[de jure]]'', a republic (or, to monarchists, under the [[English Interregnum]]).

== The Commonwealth (1649–1653) ==
=== The Rump Parliament (1648–1653) ===
{{Main|Rump Parliament}}

The Rump was created by [[Pride's Purge]] of those members of the [[Long Parliament]] who did not support the political position of the ''[[Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandee]]s'' in the [[New Model Army]]. Just before and after the execution of King Charles I on 30 January 1649, the Rump passed a number of acts of Parliament creating the legal basis for the republic. With the abolition of the monarchy, [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and the [[House of Lords]], it had unchecked executive, as well as legislative, power. The [[Council of State (England)|Council of State]], which replaced the Privy Council, took over many of the executive functions of the monarchy.  It was selected by the Rump, and most of its members were MPs. Ultimately, however, the Rump depended on the support of the Army with which it had a very uneasy relationship.

==== Structure of the Rump ====
In [[Pride's Purge]], all MPs (including most of the political Presbyterians) who would not accept the need to bring the King to trial had been removed. Thus the Rump never had more than 200 members (less than half the number of the Commons in the original Long Parliament). They included: supporters of religious independents who did not want an established church and some of whom had sympathies with the Levellers; [[Presbyterians]] who were willing to countenance the trial and execution of the King; and later admissions, such as formerly excluded MPs who were prepared to denounce the Newport Treaty negotiations with the King.

Most Rumpers were [[gentry]], though there was a higher proportion of lesser gentry and lawyers than in previous parliaments.  Less than one-quarter of them were [[regicide]]s. This left the Rump basically a conservative body whose vested interests in the existing land ownership and legal systems made them unlikely to want to reform these.

==== Rump issues and achievements ====
For the first two years of the Commonwealth, the Rump faced economic depression and the risk of invasion from [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]]. (By 1653 Cromwell and the Army had largely eliminated these threats).

There were many disagreements amongst factions of the Rump. Some wanted a republic, but others favoured retaining some type of monarchical government. Most of England's traditional ruling classes regarded the Rump as an illegal government made up of regicides and upstarts. However, they were also aware that the Rump might be all that stood in the way of an outright [[martial law|military dictatorship]]. High taxes, mainly to pay the Army, were resented by the gentry. Limited reforms were enough to antagonise the ruling class but not enough to satisfy the radicals.

Despite its unpopularity, the Rump was a link with the old constitution, and helped to settle England down and make it secure after the biggest upheaval in its history. By 1653, both [[France]] and [[Spain]] had recognised England's new government.

==== Rump reforms ====
Though the [[Church of England]] was retained, episcopacy was suppressed and the [[Act of Uniformity 1559|Act of Uniformity]] was repealed in 1650. Mainly on the insistence of the Army, many independent churches were tolerated, although everyone still had to pay [[tithe]]s to the established church.

Some small improvements were made to law and court procedure, for example all court proceedings were now conducted in English rather than in [[Law French]] or [[Latin]]. However, there were no widespread reforms of the [[Common Law]]. This would have upset the gentry, who regarded the Common Law as reinforcing their status and property rights.

The Rump passed many restrictive moral laws to regulate people's behaviour, such as closing down theatres and requiring [[Blue law|strict observance of Sunday]]. This antagonised most of the gentry.

==== The dismissal of the Rump ====
Cromwell, aided by [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Thomas Harrison]], forcibly dismissed the Rump on 20 April 1653, for reasons that are unclear. Theories are that he feared the Rump was trying to perpetuate itself as the government, or that the Rump was preparing for an election which could return an anti-Commonwealth majority. Many former members of the Rump continued to regard themselves as England's only legitimate constitutional authority. The Rump had not agreed to its own dissolution when it was dispersed by Cromwell and legislation from the period immediately before the Civil War the Act against dissolving the Long Parliament without its own consent (11 May 1641) gave them the legal basis for this view.
[[File:Commonwealth Unite 1653 692157.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A gold [[Unite (English coin)|Unite]] from 1653.]]

=== Barebone's Parliament, July–December 1653 ===
The dissolution of the Rump was followed by a short period in which Cromwell and the Army ruled alone. Nobody had the constitutional authority to call an election, but Cromwell did not want to impose a military dictatorship. Instead, he ruled through a 'nominated assembly' which he believed would be easy for the Army to control, since Army officers did the nominating.

[[Barebone's Parliament]] was opposed by former Rumpers and ridiculed by many gentry as being an assembly of 'inferior' people. However, over 110 of its 140 members were lesser gentry or of higher social status. (An exception was [[Praise-God Barbon]], a Baptist merchant after whom the Assembly got its derogatory nickname.) Many were well educated.

The assembly reflected the range of views of the officers who nominated it. The Radicals (approximately 40) included a hard core of [[Fifth Monarchists]] who wanted to be rid of Common Law and any state control of religion. The Moderates (approximately 60) wanted some improvements within the existing system and might move to either the radical or conservative side depending on the issue. The Conservatives (approximately 40) wanted to keep the status quo (since Common Law protected the interests of the gentry, and tithes and [[advowson]]s were valuable property).

Cromwell saw Barebone's Parliament as a temporary legislative body which he hoped would produce reforms and develop a constitution for the Commonwealth. However, members were divided over key issues, only 25 had previous parliamentary experience, and although many had some legal training, there were no qualified lawyers.

Cromwell seems to have expected this group of 'amateurs' to produce reform without management or direction. When the radicals mustered enough support to defeat a bill which would have preserved the status quo in religion, the conservatives, together with many moderates, surrendered their authority back to Cromwell who sent soldiers to clear the rest of the Assembly.  Barebone's Parliament was over.

In 1653, Cromwell established his [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]], making himself a king-like figure until the year of his death in 1658.

== The Commonwealth (1659–1660) ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The Protectorate]] --&gt;
The Protectorate might have continued if Cromwell's son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]], who was made [[Lord Protector]] on his father's death, had been capable of carrying on his father's policies. Richard Cromwell's main weakness was that he did not have the confidence of the [[New Model Army]]. 

After seven months the Grandees in the New Model Army army removed him and, on 6 May 1659, they reinstalled the [[Rump Parliament]]. [[Charles Fleetwood]] was appointed a member of the [[English Committee of Safety|Committee of Safety]] and of the [[Council of State (England)|Council of State]], and one of the seven commissioners for the army. On 9 June he was nominated lord-general (commander-in-chief) of the army. However, his power was undermined in parliament, which chose to disregard the army's authority in a similar fashion to the pre–Civil War parliament. The Commons on 12 October 1659, cashiered [[John Lambert (general)|General John Lambert]] and other officers, and installed Fleetwood as chief of a military council under the authority of the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|speaker]]. The next day Lambert ordered that the doors of the House be shut and the members kept out. On 26 October a &quot;Committee of Safety&quot; was appointed, of which Fleetwood and Lambert were members. Lambert was appointed major-general of all the forces in England and Scotland, Fleetwood being general. Lambert was now sent, by the Committee of Safety, with a large force to meet [[George Monck]], who was in command of the English forces in Scotland, and either negotiate with him or force him to come to terms. 

It was into this atmosphere that General [[George Monck]], governor of Scotland under the Cromwells, marched south with his army from [[Scotland]]. Lambert's army began to desert him, and he returned to London almost alone. On 21 February 1660, Monck reinstated the Presbyterian members of the Long Parliament 'secluded' by Pride, so that they could prepare legislation for a new parliament. Fleetwood was deprived of his command and ordered to appear before parliament to answer for his conduct. On 3 March Lambert was sent to the Tower, from which he escaped a month later. Lambert tried to rekindle the civil war in favour of the Commonwealth by issuing a proclamation calling on all supporters of the &quot;[[Good Old Cause]]&quot; to rally on the battlefield of Edgehill. But he was recaptured by Colonel [[Richard Ingoldsby]], a [[regicide]] who hoped to win a pardon by handing Lambert over to the new regime. The Long Parliament dissolved itself on 16 March. 

On 4 April 1660, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] issued the [[Declaration of Breda]], which made known the conditions of his acceptance of the crown of England. Monck organised the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]], which met for the first time on 25 April. On 8 May it proclaimed that King Charles II had been the lawful monarch since the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in January 1649.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26183#s2 House of Commons Journal Volume 8, 8 May 1660]&lt;/ref&gt; Charles returned from exile on 23 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;pepysdiary23&quot;&gt;[http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/04/23/index.php Pepys Diary 23 April 1661]&lt;/ref&gt; He entered [[London]] on 29 May, his birthday. To celebrate &quot;his Majesty's Return to his Parliament&quot; May 29 was made a public holiday, popularly known as [[Oak Apple Day]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26202#s3 House of Commons Journal Volume 8, 30 May 1660]&lt;/ref&gt; He was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1661.&lt;ref name=&quot;pepysdiary23&quot; /&gt;

== Radicals vs. conservatives ==
Parliament had, to a large degree, encouraged the radical political groups which emerged when the usual social controls broke down during the [[English Civil War]]. It had also unwittingly established a new political force when it set up the [[New Model Army]]. Not surprisingly, all these groups had their own hopes for the new Commonwealth.

=== Levellers ===
Led by [[John Lilburne]], [[Levellers]] drew their main support from London and the Army. In the [[Agreement of the People]], 1649, they asked for: a more representative and accountable parliament, to meet every two years; a reform of law so it would be available to, and fair to all; and religious toleration. Though they wanted a more [[democracy|democratic]] society, their proposed franchise did not extend to women or to the lowest orders of society.

Levellers saw the Rump as little better than the monarchy it had replaced, and they showed their displeasure in demonstrations, pamphlets and mutinies. While their numbers did not pose a serious threat to the government, they scared the Rump into action and a [[Treasons Act]] was passed against them in 1649.

=== Diggers ===
Led by [[Gerrard Winstanley]], [[Diggers]] wanted an even more equal society than the Levellers. They advocated a lifestyle that bore many similarities to later understandings of [[communism]], with communal ownership of land, and absolute equality for males and females in law and education. They existed in only very small numbers and faced a very strong opposition, even from the Levellers.

=== Religious sects ===
The breakdown of religious uniformity and incomplete [[Presbyterian]] Settlement of 1646 enabled independent churches to flourish. The main sects (''see also [[English Dissenters]]'') were [[Baptists]], who advocated adult re[[baptism]]; [[Ranters]], who claimed that sin did not exist for the &quot;chosen ones&quot;; and [[Fifth Monarchy Men]], who opposed all &quot;earthly&quot; governments, believing they must prepare for God's kingdom on earth by establishing a &quot;government of saints&quot;.

Despite greater toleration, extreme sects were opposed by the upper classes as they were seen as a threat to social order and property rights.
[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] were also excluded from the toleration applied to the other groups.

=== Conservatives ===
Conservatives were still dominant in both [[central government]] and [[local government]]. In the former, the Rump was anxious not to offend the traditional ruling class whose support it needed for survival, so it opposed radical ideas. In the latter, that ruling class dominated through the influence of traditional regional gentry.

'''James Charles Evers''' (born  September 11, 1922) is a prominent American [[civil rights]] advocate.  The older brother of civil rights martyr [[Medgar Evers]], Charles Evers is a leading civil rights spokesman within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in his native [[Mississippi]].  He was the first African American elected since the Reconstruction era as mayor in a Mississippi city, in Fayette in 1969.  He ran for [[governor]] in 1971 and the [[United States Senate]] in 1978, both times as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]].

==Early life and education==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Dahmer demonstration.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Demonstration on morning of [[Vernon Dahmer|Vernon Dahmer's]] funeral, January 15, 1966 ([[Hattiesburg, Mississippi|Hattiesburg, MS]]).  Charles Evers is shown left of flag bearer.]] --&gt;
Born in [[Decatur, Mississippi]], Evers had a strong, devoutly [[Christian]] mother and father. 

During [[World War II]], Charles and Medgar Evers both served in the U.S. Army. Charles fell in love with a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] woman overseas. He could not marry her and go to his native Mississippi because of her &quot;white&quot; skin color.  Mississippi had enshrined [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] rules in its constitution, which prohibited interracial marriages.

==Career==
In Mississippi about 1951, Charles and Medgar Evers grew interested in African freedom movements. They were interested in [[Jomo Kenyatta]] and the rise of the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] tribal resistance to colonialism in [[Kenya]], known as the &quot;[[Mau-Mau]]&quot; Rebellion as it moved to open violence.  Along with his brother, Charles became active in the [[Regional Council of Negro Leadership]] (RCNL), a civil rights organization that also promoted self-help and business ownership. He drew inspiration from Dr. [[T.R.M. Howard]], the president of the RCNL, who was one of the wealthiest blacks in the state.  Between 1952 and 1955, Evers often spoke at the RCNL's annual conferences in [[Mound Bayou, Mississippi|Mound Bayou]] on such issues as voting rights.

Around 1956, Evers's entrepreneurial gifts and his civil rights activism landed him in trouble in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]]. He left town and moved to [[Chicago]].  There, he vowed to support the movement back home, and fell into a life of hustling, running numbers for the Mob, and managing prostitutes. The money he made was said to have been substantial, and much of it was sent back to help the Civil Rights Movement.

In 1963, [[Byron De La Beckwith]] shot Medgar Evers as he arrived home from work. Evers died in an ambulance on the way to the hospital.  Charles Evers was shocked and deeply upset by news of his brother's death.  Over the opposition of more establishment figures in the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) like [[Roy Wilkins]], Charles took over Medgar's post as head of the [[NAACP]] in [[Mississippi]]. 

In 1969, Charles Evers was elected [[mayor]] of [[Fayette, Mississippi]], the first [[African-American]] mayor in his state since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].  By then, Fayette had a majority of black residents, but African Americans had been effectively disfranchised in Mississippi from 1890 to 1965 and passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]].  Fayette had no industry, which meant it had almost no residents who had grown up outside the area. Its white community was known to be hostile towards black people.  

Evers' election as mayor had enormous symbolic significance statewide and national resonance. The NAACP named Evers the 1969 Man of the Year. [[John Updike]] mentioned Evers in his popular novel ''[[Rabbit Redux]]''. Evers popularized the slogan, &quot;Hands that picked cotton can now pick the mayor.&quot;

Evers served many terms as mayor of Fayette.  Admired by some, he alienated others with his inflexible stands on various town issues. Evers did not like to share or delegate power.  The political rival who finally defeated Evers in a mayoral election used the slogan: &quot;We've seen what Fayette can do for one man.  Now let's see what one man can do for Fayette.&quot;

In 1971 Evers ran but was defeated in the gubernatorial [[general election]] by Democrat [[Bill Waller|William &quot;Bill&quot; Waller]], 601,222 (77 percent) to 172,762 (22.1 percent).  (Waller had been the original prosecutor of De La Beckwith.) In 1978, Evers ran for the Senate seat vacated by [[James O. Eastland]].  He finished in third place, behind his opponents, Democrat [[Maurice Dantin]] and Republican [[Thad Cochran]], but he received 24 percent of the vote.  Cochran won the election and still holds the Senate seat.

Evers attracted controversy for his support of judicial nominee [[Charles W. Pickering]], a fellow Republican, who was nominated by President Bush for a seat on the US Court of Appeals.  Evers criticized the NAACP and other organizations for opposing Pickering despite what he claimed was a record of supporting the civil rights movement in Mississippi.

Evers has befriended a range of people from [[sharecropper]]s to presidents. He was an informal advisor to politicians as diverse as [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], [[George Wallace]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Robert Kennedy]]. On the other hand, Evers has severely criticized black leaders who, he believes, are charlatans or have not &quot;paid the price&quot;.  Charles Evers has been highly critical of such black community leaders as [[Roy Wilkins]], [[Stokely Carmichael]], [[H. Rap Brown]] and [[Louis Farrakhan]].

'''Code division multiple access''' ('''CDMA''') is a [[channel access method]] used by various radio communication  technologies. It should not be confused with the [[List of mobile phone standards|mobile phone standards]] called [[IS-95|cdmaOne]] and [[CDMA2000]] (which are often referred to as simply ''CDMA''), which use CDMA as an underlying [[channel access method]].

One of the basic concepts in data communication is the idea of allowing several transmitters to send information simultaneously over a single communication channel.  This allows several users to share a band of frequencies (see [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]).  This concept is called [[Multiple Access]].  CDMA employs [[spread-spectrum]] technology and a special coding scheme (where each transmitter is assigned a code) to allow multiple users to be multiplexed over the same physical channel.  By contrast, [[time division multiple access]] (''TDMA'') divides access by [[time]], while [[frequency-division multiple access]] (''FDMA'') divides it by [[frequency]].  CDMA is a form of [[spread spectrum|spread-spectrum]] signalling, since the modulated coded signal has a much higher [[bandwidth (computing)|data bandwidth]] than the data being communicated.

An analogy to the problem of multiple access is a room (channel) in which people wish to talk to each other simultaneously.  To avoid confusion, people could take turns speaking (time division), speak at different pitches (frequency division), or speak in different languages (code division).  CDMA is analogous to the last example where people speaking the same language can understand each other, but other languages are perceived as [[noise]] and rejected.  Similarly, in radio CDMA, each group of users is given a shared code.  Many codes occupy the same channel, but only users associated with a particular code can communicate. Technology  code division multiple access channels has long been known. In the USSR, the first work devoted to this subject was published in 1935 by professor D.V. Aggeev  in the &quot;CDMA&quot;. It was shown that the use of linear methods, there are three types of signal separation: the frequency, time and compensatory. Technology of CDMA was used in 1957, the young military radio engineer Leonid Kupriyanovich in Moscow,  made the experimental model of wearable automatic mobile phone, called him as LK-1, with base station. LK-1 has 3 kg weight, 20-30 km operating distance, and 20-30 hours of battery life (&quot;Nauka i zhizn&quot;, 8, 1957, p. 49, &quot;Yuniy technik&quot;, 7, 1957, p. 43-44).  The base station, in accordance with author's description, could serve several customers. In 1958, Kupriyanovich made the new experimental &quot;pocket&quot; model of mobile phone. This phone has 0,5 kg weight. To serve more customers, Kupriyanovich proposed the device, named him as correllator. (&quot;Nauka i zhizn&quot;, 10, 1958, p.66, &quot;Technika-molodezhi&quot;, 2, 1959, 18-19)
In 1958 USSR also started the developing of &quot;Altay&quot; national civil mobile phone service for cars, based on Soviet MRT-1327 standard. The main developers of Altay system were VNIIS (Voronezh Science Research Institute of Communications)and GSPI (State Specialized Project Institute). In 1963 this service started in Moscow and in 1970 Altay service used in USSR for 30 cities.

==Steps in CDMA Modulation==
CDMA is a spread spectrum multiple access&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; technique. A spread spectrum technique spreading the bandwidth of the data uniformly for the same transmitted power. Spreading code is a pseudo-random code that has a narrow [[Ambiguity function]], unlike other narrow pulse codes. In CDMA a locally generated code runs at a much higher rate than the data to be transmitted.  Data for transmission is combined via bitwise [[XOR#Bitwise_operation|XOR]] (exclusive OR) with the faster code.  The figure shows how spread spectrum signal is generated. The data signal with pulse duration of &lt;math&gt;T_{b}&lt;/math&gt; is XOR’ed with the code signal with pulse duration of &lt;math&gt;T_{c}&lt;/math&gt;.  (Note: [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] is proportional to &lt;math&gt;1/T&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; = bit time) Therefore, the bandwidth of the data signal is &lt;math&gt;1/T_{b}&lt;/math&gt; and the bandwidth of the spread spectrum signal is &lt;math&gt;1/T_{c}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;T_{c}&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than &lt;math&gt;T_{b}&lt;/math&gt;, the bandwidth of the spread spectrum signal is much larger than the bandwidth of the original signal. The ratio &lt;math&gt;T_{b}/T_{c}&lt;/math&gt; is called spreading factor or processing gain and determines to a certain extent the upper limit of the total number of users supported simultaneously by a base station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Generation of CDMA.svg|Generation of a CDMA signal]]

Each user in a CDMA system uses a different code to modulate their signal. Choosing the codes used to modulate the signal is very important in the performance of CDMA systems.  The best performance will occur when there is good separation between the signal of a desired user and the signals of other users. The separation of the signals is made by [[Cross-correlation|correlating]] the received signal with the locally generated code of the desired user. If the signal matches the desired user's code then the correlation function will be high and the system can extract that signal.  If the desired user's code has nothing in common with the signal the correlation should be as close to zero as possible (thus eliminating the signal); this is referred to as cross correlation. If the code is correlated with the signal at any time offset other than zero, the correlation should be as close to zero as possible.  This is referred to as auto-correlation and is used to reject multi-path interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, CDMA belongs to two basic categories: synchronous (orthogonal codes) and asynchronous (pseudorandom codes).

==Code division multiplexing (Synchronous CDMA)==
Synchronous CDMA exploits mathematical properties of [[orthogonality]] between [[coordinate vector|vectors]] representing the data strings. For example, binary string ''1011'' is represented by the vector (1, 0, 1, 1). Vectors can be multiplied by taking their [[dot product]], by summing the products of their respective components.  If the dot product is zero, the two vectors are said to be ''orthogonal'' to each other (note: if u = (a, b) and v = (c, d), the dot product u·v = ac + bd). Some properties of the dot product aid understanding of how [[W-CDMA]] works. If vectors ''a'' and ''b'' are orthogonal, then &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} \,=\, 0&lt;/math&gt; and:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{a}\cdot(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}) &amp;= ||\mathbf{a}||^2 &amp;\quad\mathrm{since}\quad \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} &amp;= ||a||^2+0 \\
\mathbf{a}\cdot(-\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}) &amp;= -||\mathbf{a}||^2 &amp;\quad\mathrm{since}\quad -\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} &amp;= -||a||^2+0 \\
\mathbf{b}\cdot(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}) &amp;= ||\mathbf{b}||^2 &amp;\quad\mathrm{since}\quad \mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{b} &amp;= 0+||b||^2 \\
\mathbf{b}\cdot(\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}) &amp;= -||\mathbf{b}||^2 &amp;\quad\mathrm{since}\quad \mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{b} &amp;= 0-||b||^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Each user in synchronous CDMA uses a code orthogonal to the others' codes to modulate their signal.  An example of four mutually orthogonal digital signals is shown in the figure.  Orthogonal codes have a cross-correlation equal to zero; in other words, they do not interfere with each other.  In the case of IS-95 64 bit [[Walsh code]]s are used to encode the signal to separate different users.  Since each of the 64 Walsh codes are orthogonal to one another, the signals are channelized into 64 orthogonal signals.  The following example demonstrates how each user's signal can be encoded and decoded.

===Example===
[[Image:Cdma orthogonal signals.png|thumb|left|An example of four mutually orthogonal digital signals.]]
Start with a set of vectors that are mutually [[orthogonality|orthogonal]]. (Although mutual orthogonality is the only condition, these vectors are usually constructed for ease of decoding, for example columns or rows from [[Walsh matrix|Walsh matrices]].) An example of orthogonal functions is shown in the picture on the left.  These vectors will be assigned to individual users and are called the ''code'', ''[[chip (CDMA)|chip]] code'', or ''chipping code''.  In the interest of brevity, the rest of this example uses codes, '''v''', with only 2 bits.

Each user is associated with a different code, say '''v'''. A 1 bit is represented by transmitting a positive code, '''v''', and a 0 bit is represented by a negative code, –'''v'''.  For example, if '''v''' = (1, –1) and the data that the user wishes to transmit is (1, 0, 1, 1), then the transmitted symbols would be (1, –1, 1, 1) ⊗ '''v''' = (v&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, –v&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, –v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = (1, –1, –1, 1, 1, –1, 1, –1), where ⊗ is the [[Kronecker product]].  For the purposes of this article, we call this constructed vector the ''transmitted vector''.

Each sender has a different, unique vector '''v''' chosen from that set, but the construction method of the transmitted vector is identical.

Now, due to physical properties of interference, if two signals at a point are in phase, they add to give twice the amplitude of each signal, but if they are out of phase, they subtract and give a signal that is the difference of the amplitudes. Digitally, this behaviour can be modelled by the addition of the transmission vectors, component by component.

If sender0 has code (1, –1) and data (1, 0, 1, 1), and sender1 has code (1, 1) and data (0, 0, 1, 1), and both senders transmit simultaneously, then this table describes the coding steps:

|-
| valign=top | 2
|signal0 = encode0 ⊗ code0&lt;br /&gt;

|signal1 = encode1 ⊗ code1&lt;br /&gt;
= (–1, –1, 1, 1) ⊗ (1, 1)&lt;br /&gt;
= (–1, –1, –1, –1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
|}

Because signal0 and signal1 are transmitted at the same time into the air, they add to produce the raw signal:

:(1, –1, –1, 1, 1, –1, 1, –1) + (–1, –1, –1, –1, 1, 1, 1, 1) = (0, –2, –2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0)

This raw signal is called an interference pattern.  The receiver then extracts an intelligible signal for any known sender by combining the sender's code with the interference pattern, the receiver combines it with the codes of the senders. The following table explains how this works and shows that the signals do not interfere with one another:

{|style=&quot;border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; background-color:#f7f8ff&quot;
|align=center bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;|Step
|align=center bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;|Decode sender0
|align=center bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;|Decode sender1
|-
|0
|code0 = (1, –1), signal = (0, –2, –2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0)
|code1 = (1, 1), signal = (0, –2, –2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0)
|-
|1
|decode0 = pattern.vector0
|decode1 = pattern.vector1
|-
|2
|decode0 = ((0, –2), (–2, 0), (2, 0), (2, 0)).(1, –1)
|decode1 = ((0, –2), (–2, 0), (2, 0), (2, 0)).(1, 1)
|-
|3
|decode0 = ((0 + 2), (–2 + 0), (2 + 0), (2 + 0))
|decode1 = ((0 – 2), (–2 + 0), (2 + 0), (2 + 0))
|-
|4
|data0=(2, –2, 2, 2), meaning (1, 0, 1, 1)
|data1=(–2, –2, 2, 2), meaning (0, 0, 1, 1)
|}

Further, after decoding, all values greater than 0 are interpreted as 1 while all values less than zero are interpreted as 0. For example, after decoding, data0 is (2, –2, 2, 2), but the receiver interprets this as (1, 0, 1, 1). Values of exactly 0 means that the sender did not transmit any data, as in the following example:

Assume signal0 = (1, –1, –1, 1, 1, –1, 1, –1) is transmitted alone.  The following table shows the decode at the receiver:

{|style=&quot;border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; background-color:#f7f8ff&quot;
|align=center bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;|Step
|align=center bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;|Decode sender0
|align=center bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;|Decode sender1
|-
|0
|code0 = (1, –1), signal = (1, –1, –1, 1, 1, –1, 1, –1)
|code1 = (1, 1), signal = (1, –1, –1, 1, 1, –1, 1, –1)
|-
|1
|decode0 = pattern.vector0
|decode1 = pattern.vector1
|-
|2
|decode0 = ((1, –1), (–1, 1), (1, –1), (1, –1)).(1, –1)
|decode1 = ((1, –1), (–1, 1), (1, –1), (1, –1)).(1, 1)
|-
|3
|decode0 = ((1 + 1), (–1 – 1),(1 + 1), (1 + 1))
|decode1 = ((1 – 1), (–1 + 1),(1 – 1), (1 – 1))
|-
|4
|data0 = (2, –2, 2, 2), meaning (1, 0, 1, 1)
|data1 = (0, 0, 0, 0), meaning no data
|}

When the receiver attempts to decode the signal using sender1's code, the data is all zeros, therefore the cross correlation is equal to zero and it is clear that sender1 did not transmit any data.


==Asynchronous CDMA==
{{See also|Direct-sequence spread spectrum|near-far problem}}
The previous example of orthogonal Walsh sequences describes how 2 users can be multiplexed together in a synchronous system, a technique that is commonly referred to as ''code division multiplexing'' (CDM). The set of 4 Walsh sequences shown in the figure will afford up to 4 users, and in general, an NxN Walsh matrix can be used to multiplex N users.  Multiplexing requires all of the users to be coordinated so that each transmits their assigned sequence '''v''' (or the complement, –'''v''') so that they arrive at the receiver at exactly the same time. Thus, this technique finds use in base-to-mobile links, where all of the transmissions originate from the same transmitter and can be perfectly coordinated.

On the other hand, the mobile-to-base links cannot be precisely coordinated, particularly due to the mobility of the handsets, and require a somewhat different approach.  Since it is not mathematically possible to create signature sequences that are both orthogonal for arbitrarily random starting points and which make full use of the code space, unique &quot;pseudo-random&quot; or &quot;pseudo-noise&quot; (PN) sequences are used in ''asynchronous'' CDMA systems. A PN code is a binary sequence that appears random but can be reproduced in a deterministic manner by intended receivers. These PN codes are used to encode and decode a user's signal in Asynchronous CDMA in the same manner as the orthogonal codes in synchronous CDMA (shown in the example above). These PN sequences are statistically uncorrelated, and the sum of a large number of PN sequences results in ''multiple access interference'' (MAI) that is approximated by a Gaussian noise process (following the [[central limit theorem]] in statistics).  [[Gold code]]s are an example of a PN suitable for this purpose, as there is low correlation between the codes. If all of the users are received with the same power level, then the variance (e.g., the noise power) of the MAI increases in direct proportion to the number of users. In other words, unlike synchronous CDMA, the signals of other users will appear as noise to the signal of interest and interfere slightly with the desired signal in proportion to number of users.

All forms of CDMA use [[spread spectrum]] [[process gain]] to allow receivers to partially discriminate against unwanted signals. Signals encoded with the specified PN sequence (code) are received, while signals with different codes (or the same code but a different timing offset) appear as wideband noise reduced by the process gain.

Since each user generates MAI, controlling the signal strength is an important issue with CDMA transmitters. A CDM (synchronous CDMA), TDMA, or FDMA receiver can in theory completely reject arbitrarily strong signals using different codes, time slots or frequency channels due to the orthogonality of these systems. This is not true for Asynchronous CDMA; rejection of unwanted signals is only partial. If any or all of the unwanted signals are much stronger than the desired signal, they will overwhelm it. This leads to a general requirement in any asynchronous CDMA system to approximately match the various signal power levels as seen at the receiver. In CDMA cellular, the base station uses a fast closed-loop power control scheme to tightly control each mobile's transmit power.


===Advantages of asynchronous CDMA over other techniques===
#

'''Efficient Practical utilization of Fixed Frequency Spectrum'''

In theory, CDMA, TDMA and FDMA have exactly the same spectral efficiency but practically, each has its own challenges – power control in the case of CDMA, timing in the case of TDMA, and frequency generation/filtering in the case of FDMA.

TDMA systems must carefully synchronize the transmission times of all the users to ensure that they are received in the correct timeslot and do not cause interference.  Since this cannot be perfectly controlled in a mobile environment, each timeslot must have a guard-time, which reduces the probability that users will interfere, but decreases the spectral efficiency.  Similarly, FDMA systems must use a guard-band between adjacent channels, due to the unpredictable [[doppler shift]] of the signal spectrum because of user mobility. The guard-bands will reduce the probability that adjacent channels will interfere, but decrease the utilization of the spectrum.

#

'''Flexible Allocation of Resources'''

Asynchronous CDMA offers a key advantage in the flexible allocation of resources i.e. allocation of a PN codes to active users.  In the case of CDM (synchronous CDMA), TDMA, and FDMA the number of simultaneous orthogonal codes, time slots and frequency slots respectively is fixed hence the capacity in terms of number of simultaneous users is limited. There are a fixed number of orthogonal codes, timeslots or frequency bands that can be allocated for CDM, TDMA, and FDMA systems, which remain underutilized due to the bursty nature of telephony and packetized data transmissions.  There is no strict limit to the number of users that can be supported in an asynchronous CDMA system, only a practical limit governed by the desired bit error probability, since the SIR (Signal to Interference Ratio) varies inversely with the number of users.  In a bursty traffic environment like mobile telephony, the advantage afforded by asynchronous CDMA is that the performance (bit error rate) is allowed to fluctuate randomly, with an average value determined by the number of users times the percentage of utilization.  Suppose there are 2N users that only talk half of the time, then 2N users can be accommodated with the same ''average'' bit error probability as N users that talk all of the time.  The key difference here is that the bit error probability for N users talking all of the time is constant, whereas it is a ''random'' quantity (with the same mean) for 2N users talking half of the time.

In other words, asynchronous CDMA is ideally suited to a mobile network where large numbers of transmitters each generate a relatively small amount of traffic at irregular intervals. CDM (synchronous CDMA), TDMA, and FDMA systems cannot recover the underutilized resources inherent to bursty traffic due to the fixed number of [[orthogonal]] codes, time slots or frequency channels that can be assigned to individual transmitters. For instance, if there are N time slots in a TDMA system and 2N users that talk half of the time, then half of the time there will be more than N users needing to use more than N timeslots.  Furthermore, it would require significant overhead to continually allocate and deallocate the orthogonal code, time-slot or frequency channel resources. By comparison, asynchronous CDMA transmitters simply send when they have something to say, and go off the air when they don't, keeping the same PN signature sequence as long as they are connected to the system.

===Spread-spectrum characteristics of CDMA===
Most modulation schemes try to minimize the bandwidth of this signal since bandwidth is a limited resource.  However, spread spectrum techniques use a transmission bandwidth that is several orders of magnitude greater than the minimum required signal bandwidth.  One of the initial reasons for doing this was military applications including guidance and communication systems. These systems were designed using spread spectrum because of its security and resistance to jamming.  Asynchronous CDMA has some level of privacy built in because the signal is spread using a pseudo-random code; this code makes the spread spectrum signals appear random or have noise-like properties.  A receiver cannot demodulate this transmission without knowledge of the pseudo-random sequence used to encode the data.  CDMA is also resistant to jamming.  A jamming signal only has a finite amount of power available to jam the signal.  The jammer can either spread its energy over the entire bandwidth of the signal or jam only part of the entire signal.&lt;ref&gt;

CDMA can also effectively reject narrow band interference.  Since narrow band interference affects only a small portion of the spread spectrum signal, it can easily be removed through notch filtering without much loss of information.  [[Convolution encoding]] and [[interleaving]] can be used to assist in recovering this lost data.  CDMA signals are also resistant to multipath fading.  Since the spread spectrum signal occupies a large bandwidth only a small portion of this will undergo fading due to multipath at any given time.  Like the narrow band interference this will result in only a small loss of data and can be overcome.

Another reason CDMA is resistant to multipath interference is because the delayed versions of the transmitted pseudo-random codes will have poor correlation with the original pseudo-random code, and will thus appear as another user, which is ignored at the receiver.  In other words, as long as the multipath channel induces at least one chip of delay, the multipath signals will arrive at the receiver such that they are shifted in time by at least one chip from the intended signal.  The correlation properties of the pseudo-random codes are such that this slight delay causes the multipath to appear uncorrelated with the intended signal, and it is thus ignored.

Some CDMA devices use a [[rake receiver]], which exploits multipath delay components to improve the performance of the system.
A rake receiver combines the information from several correlators, each one tuned to a different path delay, producing a stronger version of the signal than a simple receiver with a single correlation tuned to the path delay of the strongest signal.&lt;ref&gt;

Frequency reuse is the ability to reuse the same radio channel frequency at other cell sites within a cellular system.  In the FDMA and TDMA systems frequency planning is an important consideration.  The frequencies used in different cells must be planned carefully to ensure signals from different cells do not interfere with each other.  In a CDMA system, the same frequency can be used in every cell, because channelization is done using the pseudo-random codes.  Reusing the same frequency in every cell eliminates the need for frequency planning in a CDMA system; however, planning of the different pseudo-random sequences must be done to ensure that the received signal from one cell does not correlate with the signal from a nearby cell.&lt;ref name = &quot;xtsphp&quot;&gt;

Since adjacent cells use the same frequencies, CDMA systems have the ability to perform soft hand offs.  Soft hand offs allow the mobile telephone to communicate simultaneously with two or more cells.  The best signal quality is selected until the hand off is complete.  This is different from hard hand offs utilized in other cellular systems.  In a hard hand off situation, as the mobile telephone approaches a hand off, signal strength may vary abruptly. In contrast, CDMA systems use the soft hand off, which is undetectable and provides a more reliable and higher quality signal.&lt;ref name = &quot;xtsphp&quot;/&gt;

==Collaborative CDMA==
In a recent study, a novel collaborative multi-user transmission and detection scheme called Collaborative CDMA &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article
 | first = Indu L.
 | last = Shakya
 | year = 2011
 | title = High User Capacity Collaborative CDMA
 | edition =
 | publisher = IET Communications
}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been investigated for the uplink that exploits the differences between users’ fading channel
signatures to increase the user capacity well beyond the spreading length in multiple access interference (MAI)
limited environment. The authors show that it is possible to achieve this increase at a low complexity and high bit
error rate (BER) performance in ﬂat fading channels, which is a major research challenge for overloaded CDMA
systems. In this approach, instead of using one sequence per user as in conventional CDMA, the authors group a
small number of users to share the same spreading sequence and enable group spreading and despreading
operations. The new collaborative multi-user receiver consists of two stages: group multi-user detection
(MUD) stage to suppress the MAI between the groups and a low complexity maximum-likelihood detection
stage to recover jointly the co-spread users’ data using minimum Euclidean distance measure and users’
channel gain coefﬁcients.

{{Censorship}}
'''Content-control software''', also known as '''censorware''' or '''web filtering software''', is a term for [[Computer software|software]] designed and optimized for controlling what content is permitted to a reader, especially when it is used to restrict material delivered over the [[World Wide Web|Web]]. Content-control software determines what content will be available.

The restrictions can be applied at various levels: a government can attempt to apply them nationwide (see [[Internet censorship]]), or they can, for example, be applied by an [[ISP]] to its clients, by an employer to its personnel, by a school to its students, by a library to its visitors, by a parent to a child's computer, or by an individual user to his or her own computer.

The motive is often to prevent persons from viewing content which the computer's owner(s) or other authorities may consider objectionable; when imposed without the consent of the user, content control can constitute [[censorship]]. Some content-control software includes time control functions that empowers parents to set the amount of time that child may spend accessing the [[Internet]] or playing games or other computer activities.

In some countries, such software is ubiquitous. [[Censorship in Cuba|In Cuba]], if a computer user at a government controlled Internet cafe types certain words, the word processor or browser is automatically closed, and a &quot;state security&quot; warning is given.&lt;ref name=&quot;cubaonline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/rapport_gb_md_1.pdf|title=Going online in Cuba: Internet under surveillance|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
This article uses the term &quot;content control&quot;, a term also used on occasion by [[CNN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/04/27/eyeonchina.internet/ |title= Young, angry ... and wired - May 3, 2005 |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date= 2005-05-03|accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6336423.html |title=Playboy Preaches Control |first=R. Thomas |last=Umstead newspaper=Multichannel News |date=2006-05-21 |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:u6Golw6fCu8J:www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ffile%3D/news/archive/2002/10/25/financial1400EDT0155.DTL%26type%3Dprintable+internet+%22content+control%22+site:sfgate.com |title= ? }}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bickerton |first=Derek |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E1D8143BF933A05752C1A961958260 |title=Digital Dreams - The |publisher=New York Times |date=1997-11-30 |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two other terms, ''censorware'' and ''web filtering'', while more controversial, are often used. ''Nannyware'' has also been used in both product marketing and by the media.

Companies that make products that selectively block Web sites do not refer to these products as censorware, and prefer terms such as &quot;Internet filter&quot; or &quot;URL Filter&quot;; in the specialized case of software specifically designed to allow parents to monitor and restrict the access of their children, &quot;parental control software&quot; is also used. Some products log all sites that a user accesses and rates them based on content type for reporting to an &quot;accountability partner&quot; of the person's choosing, and the term [[accountability software]] is used. Internet filters, parental control software, and/or accountability software may also be combined into one product.

Those critical of such software, however, use the term &quot;censorware&quot; freely: consider the Censorware Project, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://censorware.net/ |title=Censorware Project |publisher=censorware.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term ''censorware'' in editorials criticizing makers of such software is widespread and covers many different varieties and applications: [[Xeni Jardin]] used the term in a 9 March 2006 editorial in the New York Times when discussing the use of American-made filtering software to suppress content in China; in the same month a high school student used the term to discuss the deployment of such software in his school district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://159.54.226.83/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060319/COLUMN0203/603190309/1064 |title=? }}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sethf.com/anticensorware/hearing_dc.php |title=DMCA 1201 Exemption Transcript, April 11 - Censorware |publisher=Sethf.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, outside of editorial pages as described above, traditional newspapers do not use the term censorware in their reporting, preferring instead to use terms such as ''content filter'', ''content control'', or ''web filtering''; the New York Times and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' both appear to follow this practice. On the other hand, Web-based newspapers such as [[CNET]] use the term in both editorial and journalistic contexts, for example,, &quot;Windows Live to Get Censorware.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/windows/0,39020396,39257292,00.htm |title=Windows Live to get censorware - ZDNet.co.uk |publisher=News.zdnet.co.uk |date=2006-03-14 |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of filtering==
Filters can be implemented in many different ways: by a software program on a personal computer or by servers providing Internet access. Choosing an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP) that blocks objectionable material before it enters the home can help parents who worry about their children viewing objectionable content.

Most content control software is marketed to organizations or parents. It is, however, also advertised on occasion to facilitate self-censorship by people struggling with Internet addiction. Those obsessed by online pornography or gambling, chat rooms or the Internet in general, may wish to prevent or restrict their own access. A number of [[accountability software]] products marketed as ''self-censorship'' or ''accountability software''. These are promoted at churches and via religious media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PostBlog |url=http://www.urbanministry.org/wiki/accountability-software |title=SafeFamilies.org &amp;#124; Accountability Software: Encyclopedia of Urban Ministry |publisher=Urbanministry.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions as to when this software is moral (and sometimes legal) to use vary widely with individual people being strongly in favor and against the same software used in different scenarios.

'''Client-side filters''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/netsafekids/pro_fm_filter.html |title=Client-side filters |publisher=nap.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of filter is installed as software on your computer. This filter can be customized to meet a family's needs. This filter can only be disabled only by someone with the password. Client-side filters usually work great for places like libraries. Libraries are great places for these filters, because only some access points need to be filtered. An example would be, the computers in the children's playing and reading section.

'''Content-limited (or filtered) ISPs''': Content-limited (or filtered) ISPs are Internet service providers that offer access to only a set portion of Internet content. Anyone who subscribes to this type of service is subject to the same type of restrictions. These types of filters are especially designed for kids. It offers webpages that have been carefully reviewed multiple times and assessed for their appropriateness and safety. Content, entertainment, and education are key aspects as well. There are strict rules for those who break chat room and bulletin board rules. Those who break the rules are uninvited. Email and instant messages can only be received from specified parties.

Content limited ISPs that are intended for both children and adults allows access to almost everything, except what the ISP considers inappropriate. Limits and monitoring on email are very rare or do not exist at all. There are ISPs that provide both filtered/unfiltered access as well. Filtered access is available when there are ISPs that offer parental controls and passwords.

'''Server filter-sides''': These servers are in demand and very useful in institutional settings. Some example settings include schools or library systems. All users are subject to the access policy defined by the institution. The filtering comes from the institutions ISPs directly or from the institution itself. The filtering can be customized. A school district's high school library can have a different filtering profile than the district's junior high school library.

'''Search-engine filters''': Many search engines, such as Google and Alta Vista offer users the option of turning on a safety filter. When this safety filter is activated, it filters out the inappropriate links from all of the search results. If one knows the actual URL of a website that features sexual explicit or 18 + content, they have the ability to access it without using a search engine. Engines like Lycos, Yahoo, and Bing offer kid-oriented versions of their engines that permit only children friendly websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/netsafekids/pro_fm_filter.html |title=Filtering |publisher=nap.edu |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pros and Cons ===

'''Overblocking''':A filter that is highly effective at taking out content can be described as over blocking. Over blocking can filter out very important and acceptable material, such as health related information. Still, in many cases parents will still accept over blocking just to prevent exposure to other sites.

'''Underblocking''': Whenever new information is uploaded to the Internet, filters can under block&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/filter07.pdf|title=The Effectiveness of Internet Content Filters |first=Philip B. |last=Stark |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |date=November 10, 2007 |accessdate=22 November 2010|format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; content if the people responsible for the parties do not update their systems.

'''Default Setting''':The default setting has the ability to block out many categories from the Internet entirely. Some of these categories include: sexual images, nudity, artwork showing nudity, sex education, violence, weapons, drugs, alcohol, types of abortions, homosexual lifestyles and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/filter07.pdf |title=The Effectiveness of Internet Content Filters |first=Philip B. |last=Stark |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |date=November 10, 2007 |accessdate=22 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

=== Morality and Opinion ===
Many&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/340550/microsoft_google_yahoo_speak_isp_filter_consultation/?fp=16&amp;fpid=1 |title=Microsoft, Google and Yahoo! speak out in ISP filter consultation
 |first=Spandas |last=Lui |date=23 March 2010 |publisher=arnnet.com |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; would disapprove of government filtering viewpoints on moral or political issues, agreeing that this could become support for [[propaganda]]. Many&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8517829.stm | work=BBC News | title=Net giants query Australia filter | date=2010-02-16 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; would also find it unacceptable that an ISP, whether by law or by the ISP's own choice, should deploy such software without allowing the users to disable the filtering for their own connections. 

Critics argue that content-filtering software allows private companies to censor as they please. (See [[#Religious or political censorship|Religious or political censorship]], below). They further argue that government encouragement of content filtering, or legal requirements for content-labeling software, would be equivalent to censorship.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Some people contrast content-control with censoring, claiming that limiting the content one can view is similar to how communist governments limit the content its citizens can view in order to promote one idea. They argue that there is a chance for the content-filtering software to be abused.

=== Legal Actions ===
In 1998, a United States federal district court in Virginia ruled that the imposition of mandatory filtering in a public library violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomwbell.com/NetLaw/Ch04/Loudoun.html |title=Mainstream Loudon v. Board of Trustees of the Loudon County Library, 24 F. Supp. 2d 552 (E.D. Va. 1998) |publisher=Tomwbell.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the US Congress passed the [[Communications Decency Act]], banning indecency on the Internet. Civil liberties groups challenged the law under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and in 1997 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in their favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9703/cda.scotus/transcript.ruling.html |title=Tuling transcript |publisher=[[CNN]]}}{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the civil liberties argument, especially from groups like the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], was that parents who wanted to block sites could use their own content-filtering software, making government involvement unnecessary.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In the late 1990s, groups such as the Censorware Project began reverse-engineering the content-control software and decrypting the blacklists to determine what kind of sites the software blocked. This led to legal action alleging violation of the &quot;Cyber Patrol&quot; [[EULA|license agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eff.org/legal/cases/Microsystems_v_Scandinavia_Online/?f=20000316_verif_complaint.html |title=Microsystems v Scandinavia Online |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered that such tools routinely blocked unobjectionable sites while also failing to block intended targets. (See [[#Over-zealous filtering|Over-zealous filtering]], below).

Some content-control software companies responded by claiming that their filtering criteria were backed by intensive manual checking. The companies' opponents argued, on the other hand, that performing the necessary checking would require resources greater than the companies possessed and that therefore their claims were not valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/itas/whitepaper_1.html  |title=National Academies whitepaper |publisher=nationalacademies.org |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060419190143/http://www7.nationalacademies.org/itas/whitepaper_1.html |archivedate = 2006-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Over-zealous filtering ===
{{Main|Scunthorpe problem}}
Content-control software was mentioned as blocking access to Beaver College before its name change to [[Arcadia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/03/01/2230240&amp;tid=146 |title=Web Censors Prompt College To Consider Name Change  |publisher=slashdot.org |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example was the filtering of [[Horniman Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/10/08/horniman_museum_filtered/ |title=Porn filters have a field day on Horniman Museum |newspaper=theregister.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious or political censorship ===

Many types of content-control software have been shown to block sites based on the religious and political leanings of the company owners. Examples include blocking several religious sites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kelly Wilson |url=http://hometown.aol.com/Mjolnir13/test.htm |title=Hometown Has Been Shutdown - People Connection Blog: AIM Community Network |publisher=Hometown.aol.com |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~Trifold/NOTICE.html |title=Notice!! |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including the Web site of the Vatican), many political sites, and sites about gay/lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glaad.org/media/archive_detail.php?id=103&amp; |title=?}}{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''X-Stop'' was shown to block sites such as the [[Quaker Oats Company|Quaker]] web site, the [[National Journal of Sexual Orientation Law]], the [[Heritage Foundation]], and parts of [[The Ethical Spectacle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectacle.org/cs/burt.html |title=The Mind of a Censor |publisher=Spectacle.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; CYBERsitter blocks out sites like [[National Organization for Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectacle.org/alert/peace.html |title=CYBERsitter: Where do we not want you to go today? |publisher=Spectacle.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Willard, an academic researcher and attorney, reported on the close relationships between conservative Christian organizations and filtering software companies providing filters in U.S. public schools and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csriu.org/onlinedocs/documents/religious2.html |title=See: Filtering Software: The Religious Connection |publisher=Csriu.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; From her review of publicly available documentation, she concluded that seven of the filtering software companies were blocking Web sites based on religious or other inappropriate bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csriu.org/onlinedocs/documents/religious2.html |title=Filtering Software: The Religious Connection |publisher=Csriu.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may block sites about things like birth control, drug use and date rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-119917597.html |title=Chicago Tribune: Web porn filters block health data, study finds |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date=2002-12-10 |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content labeling==
Content labeling may be considered another form of content-control software. In 1994, the [[Internet Content Rating Association]] (ICRA) &amp;mdash; now part of the [[Family Online Safety Institute]] &amp;mdash; developed a content rating system for online content providers. Using an online questionnaire a webmaster describes the nature of his web content. A small file is generated that contains a condensed, computer readable digest of this description that can then be used by content filtering software to block or allow that site.

ICRA labels come in a variety of formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fosi.org/icra/#tech |title=ICRA: Technical standards used |accessdate=2008-07-04 |work= |publisher=FOSI |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the World Wide Web Consortium's [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF) as well as [[Platform for Internet Content Selection]] (PICS) labels used by [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]] Content Advisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie6/using/howto/security/contentadv/config.mspx |title=Browse the Web with Internet Explorer 6 and Content Advisor |accessdate= |work= |publisher=Microsoft |date=March 26, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICRA labels are an example of self-labeling. Similarly, in 2006 the [[Association of Sites Advocating Child Protection (ASACP)]] initiated the [http://rtalabel.org Restricted to Adults] self-labeling initiative. ASACP members were concerned that various forms of legislation being proposed in the [[United States]] were going to have the effect of forcing adult companies to label their content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asacp.org/page.php?content=news&amp;item=511 |title=ASACP Participates in Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography  |accessdate=2008-07-04 |work= |publisher= |date=November 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RTA label, unlike ICRA labels, does not require a webmaster to fill out a questionnaire or sign up to use. Like ICRA the RTA label is free. Both labels are recognized by a [[List of Content Control Software|wide variety of content-control software]].

The [[Voluntary Content Rating]] (VCR) system was devised by [[Solid Oak Software]] for their [[CYBERsitter]] filtering software, as an alternative to the PICS system, which some critics deemed too complex. It employs [[HTML]] [[meta element|metadata]] tags embedded within web page documents to specify the type of content contained in the document. Only two levels are specified, ''mature'' and ''adult'', making the specification extremely simple.

== Use in public libraries ==
===USA===
The use of Internet filters or content-control software varies widely in public libraries in the United States, since Internet use policies are established by the local library board. Many libraries adopted Internet filters after Congress conditioned the receipt of universal service discounts on the use of Internet filters through the [[Children's Internet Protection Act]] (CIPA). Other libraries do not install content control software, believing that acceptable use policies and educational efforts address the issue of children accessing age-inappropriate content while preserving adult users' right to freely access information. Some libraries use Internet filters on computers used by children only. Some libraries that employ content-control software allow the software to be deactivated on a case-by-case basis on application to a librarian; libraries that are subject to CIPA are required to have a policy that allows adults to request that the filter be disabled without having to explain the reason for their request.

Many legal scholars believe that a number of legal cases, in particular ''[[Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union]]'', established that the use of content-control software in libraries is a violation of the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spectacle.org/cs/library.bak |title=Purchase of blocking software by public libraries is unconstitutional |accessdate= |last=Wallace |first=Jonathan D. |coauthors= |date=November 9, 1997 |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Children's Internet Protection Act [CIPA] and the June 2003 case ''[[United States v. American Library Association]]'' found CIPA constitutional as a condition placed on the receipt of federal funding, stating that First Amendment concerns were dispelled by the law's provision that allowed adult library users to have the filtering software disabled, without having to explain the reasons for their request. The plurality decision left open a future &quot;as-applied&quot; Constitutional challenge, however. In November 2006, a lawsuit was filed against the North Central Regional Library District (NCRL) in Washington State for its policy of refusing to disable restrictions upon requests of adult patrons, but CIPA was not challenged in that matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aclu-wa.org/detail.cfm?id=557 |title=ACLU Suit Seeks Access to Information on Internet for Library Patrons |accessdate= |work= |publisher=ACLU of Washington |date=November 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, the Washington State Supreme Court provided an opinion after it was asked to certify a question referred by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington: “Whether a public library, consistent with Article I, § 5 of the Washington Constitution, may filter Internet access for all patrons without disabling Web sites containing constitutionally-protected speech upon the request of an adult library patron.” The Washington State Supreme Court ruled that NCRL’s internet filtering policy did not violate Article I, Section 5 of the Washington State Constitution. The Court said: “It appears to us that NCRL’s filtering policy is reasonable and accords with its mission and these policies and is viewpoint neutral. It appears that no article I, section 5 content-based violation exists in this case. NCRL’s essential mission is to promote reading and lifelong learning. As NCRL maintains, it is reasonable to impose restrictions on Internet access in order to maintain an environment that is conducive to study and contemplative thought.” The case now returns to federal court.

In March 2007, Virginia passed a law similar to CIPA that requires public libraries receiving state funds to use content-control software. Like CIPA, the law requires libraries to disable filters for an adult library user when requested to do so by the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Sluss |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Kaine signs library bill: The legislation requires public libraries to block obscene material with Internet filters |url=http://www.roanoke.com/politics/wb/wb/xp-109919 |work= |publisher=The Roanoke Times |date=March 23, 2007 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The Australian Internet Safety Advisory Body has information about &quot;practical advice on Internet safety, parental control and filters for the protection of children, students and families&quot; that also includes public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netalert.gov.au/ |title=NetAlert |publisher=NetAlert |date=2009-06-30 |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NetAlert, the software made available free of charge by the Australian government, was allegedly cracked by a 16 year old student, Tom Wood, less than a week after its release in August 2007. Wood supposedly bypassed the $84 million filter in about half an hour to highlight problems with the government's approach to Internet content filtering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Higginbottom |first=Nick |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22304224-2,00.html |title= Top stories |publisher=News.com.au |date=2007-08-26 |accessdate=2009-10-25}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Government has introduced legislation that requires ISP's to &quot;restrict access to age restricted content (commercial MA15+ content and R18+ content) either hosted in Australia or provided from Australia&quot; that was due to commence from 20 January 2008, known as [[Cleanfeed (content blocking system)|Cleanfeed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_310905 |title=New restricted access arrangements |publisher=ACMA |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleanfeed is a proposed mandatory ISP level content filtration system. It was proposed by the [[Kim Beazley|Beazley]] led [[Australian Labor Party]] opposition in a 2006 press release, with the intention of protecting children who were vulnerable due to claimed parental computer illiteracy. It was announced on 31 December 2007 as a policy to be implemented by the [[Kevin Rudd|Rudd]] ALP government, and initial tests in [[Tasmania]] have produced a 2008 report. Cleanfeed is funded in the current budget, and is moving towards an Expression of Interest for live testing with ISPs in 2008. Public opposition and criticism have emerged, led by the [[EFA]] and gaining irregular mainstream media attention, with a majority of Australians reportedly &quot;strongly against&quot; its implementation.&lt;ref name=&quot;nocleanfeed.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nocleanfeed.com/learn.html |title=Learn - No Clean Feed - Stop Internet Censorship in Australia |publisher=No Clean Feed |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms include its expense, inaccuracy (it will be impossible to ensure only illegal sites are blocked) and the fact that it will be compulsory, which can be seen as an intrusion on free speech rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;nocleanfeed.com&quot;/&gt; Another major criticism point has been that although the filter is claimed to stop certain materials, the underground rings dealing in such materials will not be affected. The filter might also provide a false sense of security for parents, who might supervise children less while using the Internet, achieving the exact opposite effect. Cleanfeed is a responsibility of [[Stephen Conroy|Senator Conroy's]] portfolio.

===Denmark===
In Denmark it is stated policy that it will &quot;prevent inappropriate Internet sites from being accessed from children's libraries across Denmark.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/07-27-2006/0004404991&amp;EDATE= |title=Danish Ministry of Culture Chooses SonicWALL CMS 2100 Content Filter to Keep Children's Libraries Free of Unacceptable Material |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;'It is important that every library in the country has the opportunity to protect children against pornographic material when they are using library computers. It is a main priority for me as Culture Minister to make sure children can surf the net safely at libraries,' states Brian Mikkelsen in a press-release of the Danish Ministry of Culture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saferinternet.org/ww/en/pub/insafe/news/articles/0606/dk.htm |title=Danish Minister of Culture offers Internet filters to libraries |publisher=Saferinternet.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bypassing filters ==
Content filtering in general can &quot;be bypassed entirely by tech-savvy individuals&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;techsoup&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techsoup.org/learningcenter/ctc/page7091.cfm|title=Understanding Content Filtering: An FAQ for Nonprofits|last=Satterfield|first=Brian|date=2007-06-04|publisher=Techsoup.org|accessdate=2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blocking content on circumvention advice &quot;[will not]...guarantee that users won't eventually be able to find a way around the filter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;techsoup&quot;/&gt;

Some software may be bypassed successfully by using alternative protocols such as [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] or [[telnet]] or [[HTTPS]], conducting searches in a different language, using a [[proxy server]] or a circumventor such as [[Psiphon]]. Also cached web pages returned by Google or other searches could bypass some controls as well. Web syndication services may provide alternate paths for content. Some of the more poorly-designed programs can be shut down by killing their processes: for example, in [[Microsoft Windows]] through the Windows [[Task Manager]], or in [[Mac OS X]] using [[Activity Monitor]]. Numerous workarounds and counters to workarounds from content-control software creators exist.
[[Google]] services are often blocked by filters, but these may most often be bypassed by using ''https://'' in place of ''http://'' since content filtering software is not able to interpret content under secure connections (in this case SSL).

Many content filters have an option which allows authorized people to bypass the content filter. This is especially useful in environments where the computer is being supervised and the content filter is aggressively blocking Web sites that need to be accessed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

As a reaction to the fact that some filters can be so easily bypassed, new computer auditing software has emerged to fill the gap between what a filter can block and what it cannot. [[SurfRecon]] is one company whose auditing software focuses on pornography detection.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

An encrypted [[VPN]] can also be used as means of bypassing content control software, especially if the content control software is installed on an Internet gateway or firewall.

==Products and services==
{{See also|List of content-control software|Category:Content-control software}}
Some ISPs offer [[parental control]] options. Some offer security software which includes parental controls. [[Mac OS X v10.4]] offers parental controls for several applications ([[Mail (application)|Mail]], [[Macintosh Finder|Finder]], [[iChat]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] &amp; [[Dictionary (software)|Dictionary]]). Microsoft's [[Windows Vista]] operating system also includes content-control software.

Some companies implement content-control solutions using network gateway security appliances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telemate.net |title=telemate |publisher=telemate.net |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netsweeper.com |title=Netsweeper |publisher=Netsweeper |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Webmaster (webmaster@smoothwall.net) |url=http://www.smoothwall.net |title=SmoothWall |publisher=SmoothWall |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloxx.com |title=Bloxx |publisher=Bloxx |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secpoint.com/protector.html |title=SecPoint Protector |publisher=Secpoint.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censornet.com |title=CensorNet |publisher=CensorNet |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Proxy server#Content Filtering Web Proxy|proxy servers]].

Content filtering technology exists in two major forms: [[Application-level gateway|application gateway]] or [[Deep packet inspection|packet inspection]]. For HTTP access the application gateway is called a web-proxy or just a proxy. Such web-proxies can inspect both the initial request and the returned web page using arbitrarily complex rules and will not return any part of the page to the requester until a decision is made. In addition they can make substitutions in whole or for any part of the returned result. Packet inspection filters do not initially interfere with the connection to the server but inspect the data in the connection as it goes past, at some point the filter may decide that the connection is to be filtered and it will then disconnect it by injecting a TCP-Reset or similar faked packet. The two techniques can be used together with the packet filter monitoring a link until it sees an HTTP connection starting to an IP address that has content that needs filtering. The packet filter then redirects the connection to the [[Proxy_server#Intercepting_proxy_server|web-proxy]] which can perform detailed filtering on the website without having to pass through all unfiltered connections. This combination is [[Cleanfeed (content blocking system)|quite popular]] because it can significantly reduce the cost of the system.

Gateway-based content control software may be more difficult to bypass than desktop software as the user does not have physical access to the filtering device. However, many of the techniques in the [[Content-control_software#Bypassing_filters|Bypassing filters]] section still work.

A '''chambered cairn''' is a burial monument, usually constructed during the [[Neolithic]], consisting of a [[cairn]] of stones inside which a sizeable (usually stone) chamber was constructed. Some chambered cairns are also [[passage grave|passage-graves]].

Typically, the chamber is larger than a [[cist]], and will contain a larger number of interments, which are either [[Excarnation|excarnated]] bones or inhumations (cremations). Most were situated near a settlement, and served as that community's &quot;graveyard&quot;.

== In Scotland ==
[[File:Cairn Holy, Galloway.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Cairn Holy I.]]
[[File:Cairnholy2.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Cairn Holy II - a chambered cairn near [[Newton Stewart]].]]
Scotland has a particularly large number of chambered cairns, many of radically different type. Because of the lack of other remains (the only other significant remains we have are [[hut circles]] and field systems), they are perhaps the most important clue we have to what civilisation in Scotland was like in the Neolithic. Here is a short description of each type as the classification currently stands:

===Clyde-Carlingford court cairns===
{{Main|Court cairn}}
The Clyde-Carlingford type are to be found in northern and western [[Ireland]] and in mostly southwestern Scotland. Lacking a significant passage, they are a form of [[gallery grave]]. The very basic burial chamber is normally located at one end of the cairn, while a roofless, semi-circular forecourt at the entrance provided access from the outside (although the entrance was usually blocked), and gives this type of chambered cairn its alternate name of [[Court tomb|court tomb or court cairn]]. They are generally considered to be the earliest in Scotland, dating perhaps to as early as 4000&amp;nbsp;BCE, and probably spread to Scotland from [[Ireland]].

===Hebridean===
Sharing some features with the Clyde-Carlingford group is the Hebridean group. As their name suggests they are normally found in the [[Hebrides]], and have a crude polygonal chamber and a very short passage to one end of the cairn.

===Orkney-Cromarty===
[[Image:Unstan chambered cairn entrance by Bruce McAdam.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to [[Unstan Chambered Cairn]], [[Orkney]]]]
The Orkney-Cromarty group is by far the largest and most diverse. It has been subdivided into Yarrows, Camster and Cromarty subtypes but the differences are extremely subtle. In general, they all have dividing slabs at either side of a rectangular chamber, separating it into compartments. The number of these compartments ranges from 4 in the earliest examples to over 24 in an extreme example on [[Orkney]]. The actual shape of the cairn varies from simple circular designs to elaborate 'forecourts' protruding from each end, creating what look like small [[Amphitheatres]]. It is likely that these are the result of cultural influences from mainland [[Europe]], as they are similar to designs found in [[France]] and [[Spain]].

===Bookan===
The Bookan type is thought to be the earliest to be found on [[Orkney Islands|Orkney]]. Because of Orkney's archaeological richness, Bookan type tombs are very hard to find. They are extremely unusual, some being double-deckered! They all seem to have features which suggest some early stage in the development of Maeshowe type tombs.

===Maeshowe===
The [[Maeshowe]] group, named after the famous monument on Orkney, is among the most elaborate. Like their counterparts on [[Shetland Islands|Shetland]], they are unlike anything else in Scotland, so it is possible these were the result of local development, or influences from [[Scandinavia]]. They consist of a central chamber from which lead small compartments, into which burials would be placed.

===Shetland===
A final category is the Shetland group, of which little is known. On plan, they do look similar to the Maeshowe group although the whole chamber is cross-shaped and there are no small compartments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Aged Canadian Whisky.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A bottle of Canadian whisky]]
'''Canadian whisky''' is a type of [[whisky]] produced in Canada. Most Canadian whiskies are [[Blended whisky|blended]] multi-grain liquors containing a large percentage of [[corn]] spirits, and are typically lighter and smoother than other whisky styles.&lt;ref name = Whisky.com&gt;[http://www.whisky.com/canadian_whiskey_brands.html What is Canadian Whisky?], ''Whiskey.com''. (Access date December 15, 2010.)&lt;/ref&gt;  

While the lighter and smoother Canadian whiskies are the most widely familiar, the range of products is actually broad and includes some robust whiskies as well.&lt;ref name = Whisky.com&gt;[http://www.whisky.com/canadian_whiskey_brands.html What is Canadian Whisky?], ''Whiskey.com''. (Access date December 15, 2010.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Canadian Whisky|title=Wiser’s Legacy Canadian Rye Whisky|url=http://www.canadianwhisky.org/news-views/introducing-the-new-wiser’s-legacy-canadian-rye-whisky-45-alc-vol.html|publisher=Canadianwhisky.org|accessdate=March 02, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CanadianWhisky.org|title=Whistlepig 10 Year Old Straight 100% Rye Whisky|url=http://www.canadianwhisky.org/news-views/whistlepig-10-year-old-straight-100-rye-whiskey.html|publisher=Canadianwhisky.org|accessdate=March 02 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the laws of Canada, a Canadian whisky must be mashed, distilled and aged in Canada. It may contain [[caramel]] (as may [[Scotch whisky]]) and flavouring, in addition to the distilled mash spirits. As with Scotch and [[Irish whiskey]], the alcohol content of the spirits used may exceed 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scotch Whisky Association|title=What is Scotch whisky?|url=http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/swa/43.html|work=What is Scotch whisky?|publisher=Scotch Whisky Association|accessdate=March 0, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = B.02.020/&gt; Thus, much of the spirits used in making a Canadian whisky, prior to aging, may have less grain-derived flavor than typical [[single malt]]s or [[straight whiskey|U.S. &quot;straight&quot; whiskies]]. While this aspect is similar to Scotch and Irish whisky regulations, it contrasts with the maximum [[alcoholic proof]] limits on distillation (80% [[alcohol by volume|abv]]) and aging (62.5% abv) purity allowed in the production of &quot;[[straight whiskey|straight]]&quot; whisky in the [[American whiskey|United States]]. All spirits used in making a Canadian whisky must be aged for at least three years in wooden barrels of not greater than 700 L capacity (a requirement similar to that for Scotch and Irish whisky and stricter than for U.S. whisky). The final whisky must contain at least 40 percent alcohol by volume.&lt;ref name = B.02.020&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/F-27/C.R.C.-c.870/section-B.02.020.html &quot;Canadian Food and Drug Regulations (C.R.C., c. 870) - Canadian Whisky, Canadian Rye Whisky or Rye Whisky (B.02.020)&quot;]. (Access date December 15, 2010.)&lt;/ref&gt; As with Scotch and most other whiskies, the barrel used for aging may be new or re-used and may be toasted, charred or left raw.

Historically, in Canada, whisky that had some rye grain added to the [[mash ingredients|mash bill]] to give it more flavour came to be called “rye”.&lt;ref name=Essence/&gt; Although many Canadian whiskies are still labeled as “rye”, the modern mash bill for a Canadian “rye” whisky often contains little or no rye grain, and their flavour is derived in other ways (such as flavour development from the aging process, blending with stronger-tasting Canadian whiskies, and the addition of flavourings).&lt;ref name =Essence&gt;{{cite web|last=CanadianWhisky.org|title=The essence of Canadian rye|url=http://www.canadianwhisky.org/news-views/the-essence-of-canadian-rye.html|work=The essence of Canadian rye|publisher=canadianwhisky.org|accessdate=March 02, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws in some other countries, such as the [[United States of America|United States]], recognize Canadian whisky as an indigenous product of Canada, and require that products labeled as Canadian whisky must satisfy the laws of Canada that regulate the manufacture of Canadian whisky for consumption in Canada.&lt;ref name = USdistilledSpirits/&gt; When sold in another country, Canadian whisky is typically also required to conform to the local product requirements that apply to whisky in general when sold in that country, which may in some aspects involve stricter standards than the Canadian law.

==Characteristics and historical background==
[[Image:CanadianWhisky.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Various Canadian whiskies]]
It is a common misconception that Canadian whiskies are primarily made using [[rye]] grain.&lt;ref name = Whisky.com/&gt; Although many Canadian whiskies are labelled as &quot;[[rye whisky]]&quot;, the use of rye grain is not dictated by law, and whisky products of all grain types are often generically referred to as (and may legally be labelled as) &quot;rye whisky&quot; in [[Canada]]. Under Canadian law, the term &quot;Canadian rye whisky&quot; is simply synonymous with &quot;Canadian whisky&quot;,&lt;ref name = B.02.020/&gt; and the primary [[mash ingredients|mash ingredient]] in most Canadian whisky is [[corn]].

In contrast, the [[United States of America|U.S.]] definition of &quot;rye whisky&quot; prevents a low rye content whisky from being labelled &quot;rye&quot; unless it is labeled as a &quot;blended&quot; rye whisky, and approximately 10% of such a &quot;blended rye whisky&quot; must still be from rye.&lt;ref name = USdistilledSpirits/&gt; The U.S. also requires that if a whisky contains coloring, flavoring or [[neutral spirits|distillates with 80% or greater alcohol content]], this must be acknowledged on the label by including the term &quot;blended&quot; in the description on the label.&lt;ref name = USdistilledSpirits/&gt; Canadian law does not have these requirements. Moreover, U.S. law requires at least 20% of the content of a blended whisky to be &quot;[[straight whiskey|straight whisky]]&quot; rather than [[neutral spirits]] or &quot;light&quot; (near-neutral) whisky,&lt;ref name = USdistilledSpirits/&gt; which is not required under Canadian law. However, U.S. law permits &quot;blended&quot; whisky to contain up to 80% un-aged grain neutral spirits (with an age statement on the label that refers only to the &quot;straight&quot; part of the blend), while Canadian law requires that all of the spirits in a Canadian whisky be aged for at least three years.

The basic definition of &quot;whisky&quot; in many countries other than Canada (including the U.S.) does not include any specific aging duration requirement. However, Canadian products aged less than three years (or failing to meet the domestic Canadian whisky standards in some other way) cannot be called &quot;Canadian whisky&quot; within Canada and in some other countries (such as the U.S.&lt;ref name = USdistilledSpirits&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=27:1.0.1.1.3.3.25.2&amp;idno=27 Title 27: Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Part 5 — Labeling and Advertising of Distilled Spirits, Subpart C — Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits, § 5.22 — The standards of identity], U.S. Government Printing Office, current as of December 13, 2010. (Access date December 15, 2010.)&lt;/ref&gt;).

Canadian whisky featured prominently in [[rum-running]] into the U.S. during [[Prohibition]]. [[Hiram Walker]]'s distillery in [[Windsor, Ontario]], directly across the [[Detroit River]] from [[Detroit, Michigan]], easily served [[rum-running|bootleggers]] using small, fast smuggling boats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cocktailtimes.com/people/hiram_walker.shtml People Profile: Hiram Walker (1816–1899)] ''Coctail Times''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Merge to|Noun|discuss=Talk:Noun#Merger|date=October 2010}}
In [[linguistics]], a '''collective noun''' is a word used to define a group of objects, where objects can be people, animals, emotions, inanimate things, concepts, or other things. For example, in the phrase &quot;a pride of lions,&quot; ''pride''  is a collective noun.

Most collective nouns encountered in everyday speech, such as &quot;group,&quot; are mundane and are not specific to one kind of constituent object.  For example, the terms &quot;group of people,&quot; &quot;group of dogs,&quot; and &quot;group of ideas&quot; are all correct uses. Others, especially words belonging to the large subset of collective nouns known as '''[[#Terms of venery (words for groups of animals)|terms of venery]]''' (words for groups of animals), are specific to one kind of constituent object.  For example, &quot;pride&quot; as a term of venery refers to lions, but not to [[dog]]s or [[llama]]s.

Collective nouns should not be confused with [[mass noun]]s, or with the [[Singulative number|collective grammatical number]].

== Derivational collectives ==

Derivation accounts for many collective words. Because derivation is a slower and less productive [[word formation]] process than the more overtly [[Syntax|syntactical]] morphological methods, there are fewer collectives formed  this way. As with all derived words, derivational collectives often differ [[Semantics|semantically]] from the original words, acquiring new [[connotation]]s and even new [[denotation]]s.

The English endings ''-age'' and ''-ade'' often signify a collective. Sometimes the relationship is easily recognizable: ''baggage, drainage, blockade.'' However, even though the etymology is plain to see, the derived words take on quite a special meaning.

[[German Language|German]] uses the [[prefix]] ''Ge-'' to create collectives.  The root word often undergoes [[I-mutation|umlaut]] and [[suffix]]ation as well as receiving the ''Ge-'' prefix. Nearly all nouns created in this way are of [[neuter gender]]. Examples include:

* ''das Gebirge,'' &quot;group of mountains,&quot; from ''der Berg,'' &quot;mountain&quot;
* ''das Gepäck,'' &quot;luggage, baggage&quot; from ''der Pack,'' &quot;pack, bundle, pile&quot;
* ''das Geflügel,'' &quot;poultry, fowl (birds)&quot; from late [[MHG]] ''gevlügel(e),'' under the influence of ''der Flügel,'' &quot;wing,&quot;  from MHG ''gevügel,'' from [[OHG]] ''gifugili'' = collective formation, from ''fogal,'' &quot;bird&quot;
* ''das Gefieder,'' &quot;plumage&quot; from ''die Feder,'' &quot;feather&quot;

==Metonymic merging of grammatical number==

{{main|Synesis|Plurale tantum}}

Two good examples of collective nouns are &quot;team&quot; and &quot;government,&quot; which are both words referring to groups of (usually) people. Both &quot;team&quot; and &quot;government&quot; are [[count noun]]s. (Consider: &quot;one team,&quot; &quot;two teams,&quot; &quot;most teams&quot;; &quot;one government,&quot; &quot;two governments,&quot; &quot;many governments&quot;). However, confusion often stems from the fact that plural verb forms can often be used, at least in English as it is used in several countries, with the singular forms of these count nouns (for example: &quot;The team have finished the project&quot;). Conversely, singular verb forms can often be used with nouns ending in &quot;-s&quot; that were once considered plural (for example: &quot;Physics is my favorite academic subject&quot;). This apparent &quot;number mismatch&quot; is actually a quite natural and logical feature of human language, and its mechanism is a subtle [[metonymy|metonymic]] shift in the thoughts underlying the words.

In [[British English]], it is generally accepted that collective nouns can take either singular or plural verb forms depending on the context and the metonymic shift that it implies. For example, &quot;the team is in the dressing room&quot; (''formal agreement'') refers to ''the team'' as an ensemble, whilst &quot;the team are fighting among themselves&quot; (''notional agreement'') refers to ''the team'' as individuals. This is also British English practice with names of countries and cities in sports contexts; for example, &quot;Germany have won the competition,&quot; &quot;Madrid have lost three consecutive matches,&quot; etc. In [[American English]], collective nouns usually take singular verb forms (formal agreement), but either a singular or plural verb is correct American usage where the noun is understood as a group of individual components. In cases where a metonymic shift would be otherwise revealed nearby, the whole sentence may be recast to avoid the metonymy. (For example, &quot;the team are fighting among themselves&quot; may become &quot;the team ''members'' are fighting among themselves&quot; or simply &quot;the team is fighting.&quot;) See [[American and British English differences#Formal and notional agreement|American and British English differences - Formal and notional agreement]].

A good example of such a metonymic shift in the singular-to-plural direction (designated by the Latin term ''plurale tantum'') is the following sentence: &quot;The team have finished the project.&quot; In that sentence, the underlying thought is of the individual members of the team working together to finish the project. Their accomplishment is collective, and the emphasis is not on their individual identities, yet they are at the same time still discrete individuals; the word choice &quot;team have&quot; manages to convey both their collective and discrete identities simultaneously. A good example of such a metonymic shift in the plural-to-singular direction is the following sentence: &quot;Mathematics is my favorite academic subject.&quot; The word &quot;mathematics&quot; may have originally been plural in concept, referring to mathematic endeavors, but metonymic shift—that is, the shift in concept from &quot;the endeavors&quot; to &quot;the whole set of endeavors&quot;—produced the usage of &quot;mathematics&quot; as a singular entity taking singular verb forms. (A true [[mass noun|mass-noun]] sense of &quot;mathematics&quot; followed naturally.)

Nominally singular pronouns can be collective nouns taking plural verbs, according to the same rules that apply to other collective nouns.  For example, it is correct [[British English]] or [[American English]] usage to say:  &quot;None are so fallible as those who are sure they're right.&quot;  In this case, the plural verb is used because the context for &quot;none&quot; suggests more than one thing or person.&lt;ref&gt;Strunk &amp; White, The Elements of Style (4th ed., 2000), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confounding of collective noun and mass noun==
There is often confusion about, and confounding of, the two different concepts of ''collective noun'' and ''[[mass noun]].'' Generally, collective nouns are not mass (non-count) nouns, but rather are a special subset of [[count noun]]s. However, the term &quot;collective noun&quot; is often used to mean &quot;mass noun&quot; (even in some dictionaries {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} ), because users confound two different kinds of verb number invariability:
# that seen with mass nouns such as &quot;water&quot; or &quot;furniture&quot;, with which only singular verb forms are used because the constituent matter is ''grammatically'' nondiscrete (although it may [&quot;water&quot;] or may not [&quot;furniture&quot;] be ''[[Emic and etic|etically]]'' nondiscrete); and
# that seen with collective nouns, which is the result of the metonymical shift, discussed earlier, between the group and its (both grammatically and etically) discrete constituents.

Some words, including &quot;mathematics&quot; and &quot;physics&quot;, have developed true mass-noun senses despite having grown from count-noun roots.

==Terms of venery (words for groups of animals)==
{{Animalnouns}}
The tradition of using collective nouns that are specific to certain kinds of animals stems from an English [[Medieval hunting|Medieval]] [[hunting]] tradition, dating back to at least the fifteenth century. Terms of venery &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= An Exaltation of Larks: The Ultimate Edition |last= Lipton |first= James |authorlink= James Lipton |year= 1993 |publisher= [[Penguin Books]]|location= USA |isbn= 0 14 01.7096 0 |pages= 5–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or nouns of assembly were used by gentlemen to distinguish themselves from yeomen and others and formed part of their education. Only a few of the terms were for groups of animals; others, such as &quot;singular&quot; for boars, described their characteristics or habits of life. &quot;Singular&quot; may also be a corruption of the French (&quot;sanglier&quot;). Misunderstandings over the centuries led to all the terms being regarded as collective nouns and some became unrecognisable through changes to the language and [[transcription error]]s: &quot;besynys&quot; (for ferrets) became &quot;fesynes&quot; instead of &quot;busy-ness.&quot;

Sometimes a term of venery will apply to a group only in a certain context. &quot;Herd&quot; can properly refer to a group of wild horses, but not to a group of domestic horses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} A &quot;paddling of ducks&quot; only refers to ducks on water.  A group of geese on the ground is referred to as a &quot;gaggle of geese&quot; while a &quot;skein of geese&quot; would refer to them in flight.

Usage authorities have said that the lesser-known words of this type are not needed for practical purposes&lt;ref name=Todd&amp;Hancock&gt;{{cite book | last = Todd | first = Loreto | coauthor = Hancock, Ian | year = 1986 | title = International English Usage | publisher = Psychology Press | page = 133–134 | isbn = 0415051029 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=iccd5KAUnYQC&amp;pg=PA133 | accessdate = 2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that some are &quot;the result of light-hearted creativity rather than observation&quot;&lt;ref name=Todd&amp;Hancock/&gt; or &quot;facetious&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Harris | first = Theodore L. | coauthor = Hodges, Richard E. | year = 1995 | publisher = International Reading Association | page = 271 | isbn = 0872071383 | accessdate = 2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Nevertheless, interest in constituent-object-specific collective nouns has always remained high, and the [[neologism|coining]] of candidate collective nouns has been a pastime (usually humorous) of many writers, including for non-animal nouns, such as professions, e.g., a &quot;sequitur of logicians.&quot;
&lt;!--
Most recently, one author of a [[computer]] book invented some obviously joking collective nouns which systems developers could relate to, including a &quot;bleat&quot; of users; a &quot;retreat&quot; of consultants; and a &quot;trough&quot; of salespersons.

The '''carat''' is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[mass]] equal to 200&amp;nbsp;[[gram|mg]] (0.007055 [[ounce|''oz'']]), and it is used for measuring [[gemstone]]s and [[pearl]]s.

The current definition, sometimes known as the '''metric carat''', was adopted in 1907 at the Fourth [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, and soon afterwards in many countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;The [[United States]] adopted the metric carat definition on July 1, 1913, the [[United Kingdom]] on 1 April 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; The carat is divisible into one hundred ''points'' of two milligrams each. Other subdivisions, and slightly different mass values, have been used in the past in different locations.

In terms of [[diamond]]s, a ''paragon'' is a flawless stone of at least 100 carats (20&amp;nbsp;g).

The [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] [[Electronic Data Interchange|X.12 EDI]] standard abbreviation for the carat is '''CD'''.

==Etymology==
First attested in English in the middle 15th century, the word ''carat'' came to English from [[Middle French]] ''carat'', in turn from Italian ''carato'', which came from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''qīrāṭ'' (قيراط), a term for a very small unit of weight defined by reference to a small seed, which in turn comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] κεράτιον (''kerátion''), literally meaning &quot;small horn&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkera%2Ftion κεράτιον],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; (diminutive of κέρας - ''keras'', &quot;horn&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dke%2Fras κέρας], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) but also &quot;carob seed&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Summarized by {{OEtymD|carat}} Greater details in Walter W. Skeat (1888), ''[http://www.archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00skeauoft An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language]''&lt;/ref&gt; which was used as a unit of weight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0122990#m_en_gb0122990 carat], Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin language|Latin]] word for carat is ''siliqua''. The [[Ceratonia siliqua|carob]] tree is Ceratonia siliqua.

In past centuries, different countries each had their own carat unit, all roughly equivalent to the mass of a carob seed, though the carob seed itself was not used as the standard reference point for the weight. These units were often used for weighing gold.

==Historical definitions in the United Kingdom==
===Board of Trade carat===
In the [[United Kingdom]], before 1888, the '''Board of Trade carat''' was exactly &lt;math&gt;3\,\tfrac{1647}{9691}&lt;/math&gt; (≈&amp;nbsp;3.170) [[Grain (unit)|grain]]s;&lt;ref&gt;The pre-1888 [[Board of Trade]] carat, of which there were exactly &lt;math&gt;151\,\tfrac{27}{64}&lt;/math&gt; per [[ounce#International troy ounce|ounce troy]], was approximately 205.4094&amp;nbsp;''mg''.&lt;/ref&gt; after 1887, the [[Board of Trade]] carat was exactly &lt;math&gt;3\,\tfrac{17}{101}&lt;/math&gt; (≈&amp;nbsp;3.168) grains.&lt;ref&gt;The post-1887 Board of Trade carat, of which there were exactly 151&amp;frac12; per ounce troy, was approximately 205.3035&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite it being a non-metric unit, a number of metric countries used this unit for its limited range of application.

The Board of Trade carat was divisible into four ''diamond grains'',&lt;ref&gt;Unlike the modern carat, the Board of Trade carat was not used for measuring pearls; those were measured with ''pearl grains''.&lt;/ref&gt; but measurements were typically made in multiples of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{64}&lt;/math&gt; carat.

===Pound carat and ounce carat===
There were also two varieties of ''refiners’ carats'' once used in the United Kingdom &amp;mdash; the '''pound carat''' and the '''ounce carat'''.&lt;ref&gt;The refiners&amp;rsquo; carats were the offspring of the [[carat (purity)|carat as a measure of fineness for gold]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pound (mass)#Troy pound|pound troy]] was divisible into 24 ''pound carats'' of 240 grains troy each; the pound carat was divisible into four ''pound grains'' of 60 grains troy each; and the pound grain was divisible into four ''pound quarters'' of 15 grains troy each. Similarly, the [[ounce#International troy ounce|ounce troy]] was divisible into 24 ''ounce carats'' of 20 grains troy each; the ounce carat was divisible into four ''ounce grains'' of 5 grains troy each; and the ounce grain was divisible into four ''ounce quarters'' of 1¼ grains troy each.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffers, William. 1883. ''Hall Marks on Gold and Silver Plate''. 6th edition. [[London]]: Bickers &amp; Son.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The carat of the Romans and Greeks==
The ''solidus'' was also a Roman weight unit. There is literary evidence that the weight of 72 coins of the type called [[solidus (coin)|''solidus'']] was exactly a Roman pound, and that the weight of a ''solidus'' was 24 ''siliquae''. The weight of a Roman pound is generally believed to have been 327.45&amp;nbsp;''g'' or possibly up to 5&amp;nbsp;''g'' less. Therefore the metric equivalent of 1 ''siliqua'' was approximately 189&amp;nbsp;''mg''. The Greeks had a similar unit of the same value.&lt;ref name=&quot;grierson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/sho/1960/00000003/00000003/art00001 | last=Grierson | first=Philip | title=The Monetary Reforms of'Abd Al-Malik | journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient | volume=3 | year=1960 | pages=241–264 | doi = 10.1163/156852060X00098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gold fineness in carats, comes from carats and grains of gold in a solidus of coin. One solidus = 24 carats, 1 carat = 4 grains, is preserved right up to this day. A book &lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, W.S.B.  &quot;Measures, Weights and Moneys of all Nations&quot; 1891&lt;/ref&gt; gives gold fineness in carats of 4 grains, and silver in (pound) of 12 ounces each 20 dwt.

==The carat in Byzantine Egypt==
A carob based weight unit was also used in Egypt in the [[Byzantine]] and early Arab periods. In this region, glass weights were used for weighing coins. From these the weight of the Egypt carat has been reconstructed as 196&amp;nbsp;''mg''. This is consistent with the average weights of carob seeds in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;grierson&quot; /&gt;

==The Syrian and Arabic carat in the First Millennium CE==
According to literary sources, the Arabic carat was only 2% less than the Syrian carat. Based on coins and glass weights their weight was reconstructed as approximately 212&amp;nbsp;''mg''. This is consistent with literary information that a solidus weighed slightly less than 22&amp;nbsp;carats.&lt;ref name=&quot;grierson&quot; /&gt;

The '''European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations''' (CEPT) was established on June 26, 1959 as a coordinating body for [[Europe]]an state [[telecommunications]] and [[postal organizations]]. The [[acronym]] comes from the [[French language|French]] version of its name ''Conférence européenne des administrations des postes et des télécommunications''.

CEPT was responsible for the creation of the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI) in 1988.

CEPT is organised into two main components: 
* Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) - responsible for radiocommunications and telecommunications matters
**The permanent secretariat of the ECC is the European Radiocommunications Office (ERO)
* European Committee for Postal Regulation (CERP, after the [[French language|French]] ''&quot;Comité européen des régulateurs postaux&quot;'') - responsible for postal matters

'''Tramlink''' (originally and sometimes still called '''Croydon Tramlink''') is a tramway system in [[south London]] in the United Kingdom which began operation in May 2000. The service is operated by [[London Tramlink]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/1566.aspx |title=Transport for London -London Tramlink |publisher=Tfl.gov.uk |date=30 May 2000 |accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of [[Transport for London]] (TfL).

Tramlink serves seven [[National Rail]] stations but has only one interchange with the [[London Underground]] (at [[Wimbledon station]] to the [[District Line]]) and one with [[London Overground]] (at [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]]); one of the factors leading to its creation was that the area around [[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]] has no Underground service.

Tramlink runs on a mixture of street track shared with other traffic, dedicated track in public roads, and off-street track consisting of new rights-of-way, former railway lines, and one section of alignment, though not track, shared with a [[third rail]] electrified [[Network Rail]] line.

==History==
{{ Main | Trams in London }}

===Construction===
In 1990 [[Croydon Council]] with the then [[London Regional Transport]] (LRT) put the project to Parliament and the Croydon Tramlink Act 1994 resulted which gave LRT the legal power to build and run Tramlink.&lt;ref name=tramlinkact&gt;{{Cite web | title = Croydon Tramlink Act | year = 1994 | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/localact1994/ukla_19940011_en_2#pt1-l1g4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 Tramtrack Croydon Limited (TCL) won a 99 year [[Private Finance Initiative]] (PFI) contract to design, build, operate and maintain the Tramlink system. Under this contract Tramtrack Croydon Ltd kept the revenue generated by Tramlink and LRT had to pay compensation to TCL for any changes to the fares and ticketing policy introduced later.&lt;ref name = tfln7741/&gt;

TCL subcontracted the operation of the tram system to CentreWest Buses, now part of [[First London]]. TCL was a partnership comprising [[First Group]], [[Bombardier Transportation]] (the builders of the system's tramcars), [[Sir Robert McAlpine]] and [[Amey Construction Ltd]] (who built the system), and [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] and [[3i]] (who arranged the finances).

===Former lines re-used===
[[Image:028140 tramlink mitcham.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gauntlet track]] near Mitcham]] There are three routes on the tram link, detailed in a later section: Route 1 – Elmers End to Croydon; Route 2 – Beckenham Junction to Croydon; and Route 3 – New Addington to Wimbledon.

Route 2 runs parallel to the Crystal Palace to Beckenham Junction line of the [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]] network between [[Birkbeck station|Birkbeck]] and [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]], the [[National Rail]] track had been singled some years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/croydon/croydon1.html|title=Map of current system using existing and former British rail lines|accessdate=16 November 2007 |publisher=[[Newsquest|This is Local London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Elmers End to Woodside route 1, and also route 2 from Arena, take part of the former [[British Rail]] branch line to [[Addiscombe railway station|Addiscombe]] then diverges to reach Addiscombe tram stop which is 500 metres west of the now demolished railway station. At Woodside, the old station buildings still stand disused, and the original platforms have been replaced by accessible low platforms.

From Woodside to near Sandilands (routes 1 &amp; 2) and from near Sandilands almost to Lloyd Park (route 3) Tramlink follows the former [[Woodside and South Croydon Railway]], including the Park Hill (or Sandilands) tunnels.

The section of Route 3 between [[Wimbledon railway station|Wimbledon]] and [[West Croydon railway station|West Croydon]] follows the old single-track [[British Rail]] route for the most part, which was closed on 31 May 1997 so that it could be converted for Tramlink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2002|journal=[[Railway Magazine]]|publisher=IPC Media |volume=148|page=51|issn=0033-8923}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this section, from near Phipps Bridge to near Reeves Corner, route 3 follows the [[Surrey Iron Railway]]. This gives Tramlink a claim to the world's oldest aligned trackbed. {{gbmapscaled|TQ273680|300|Tramway Path}} beside Mitcham tram stop had its name long before Tramlink. A partial obstruction of the route near this point has necessitated the use of [[gauntlet track]]. 

A Victorian footbridge beside Waddon New Road was dismantled to make way for the flyover&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.transport-of-delight.com/Tramlink/Pages/TramsinAction/Flyover-1.htm |title=Flyover 1 |publisher=Transport-of-delight.com |date= |accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that takes Tramlink over the [[West Croydon railway station|West Croydon]] to [[Sutton railway station (London)|Sutton]] railway line. The footbridge has been re-erected at [[Corfe Castle railway station|Corfe Castle]] station on the [[Swanage Railway]].

===Buyout by Transport for London===
In March 2008 TfL announced that it had reached agreement to buy Tramtrack Croydon Limited (TCL) for £98m. The purchase was finalised on 28 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/6-Statement-of-Acounts-2008.pdf|title=Statement of Accounts for the Year Ending 31&amp;nbsp;March 2008|date=25 June 2008|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=27 June 2008 |at=p. 71, para. 30. c) }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The background to this purchase relates to the requirement that TfL (who took over from London Regional Transport in 2000) compensates TCL for the consequences of any changes to the fares and ticketing policy introduced since 1996. In 2007 that payment was £4m, with an annual increase in rate.&lt;ref name=tfln7741&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx|title=TfL announces plans to take over Tramlink services|accessdate=18 March 2008 |publisher=[[Transport for London]]|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080412011803/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx |archivedate = 12 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008 TfL introduced a new colour scheme to the vehicles, using the blue, white and green of the routes' symbol on TfL maps, to distinguish the trams from its buses operating in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/latestnews/s-green-Tramlink/article-385546-detail/article.html|title=It's green for go at Tramlink|last=Kottegoda|first=Maheesha |date=9 October 2008|work=Croydon Advertiser|accessdate=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current system==
===Stops===
[[Image:Croydon Tramlink Addiscombe Road.jpg|thumb|right|Tram 2530 in the second livery on 24 August 2004, leaving Croydon on an [[Elmers End station|Elmers End]] service]]

The tram stops have low platforms, {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} above rail level. Stops are un-staffed and have automated ticket machines for ticket sales. In general, access between the platforms involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing.
There are 39 tram stops, most being {{convert|32.2|m|abbr=on}} long. They are virtually level with the doors and are all wider than {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}}. This allows for wheelchairs, prams, pushchairs and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps. In street sections, the pavement is integrated with the tram stop.

Tramlink uses some former main-line stations on the Wimbledon–West Croydon and Elmers End–Coombe Road stretches of line that were taken over. The railway platforms have been demolished and rebuilt to Tramlink specifications, except at Elmers End and Wimbledon where the track level was raised to meet the higher platforms, to enable [[cross-platform interchange]].

Thirty eight stops opened as part of the phased introduction of tram services in May 2000. [[Centrale tram stop]] in Tamworth Road opened on 10 December 2005, increasing journey times slightly. As turnround times are already quite tight this raised the issue of buying an extra tram to maintain punctuality. Partly for this reason, but also to take into account the planned restructuring of services (subsequently introduced in July 2006), TfL had issued tenders for a new tram. However, nothing resulted from this.

All stops have disabled access, raised paving, CCTV, a Passenger Help Point, a Passenger Information Display (PID), litter bins, a ticket machine, a noticeboard and lamp-posts, and most also have seats and a shelter.

The PIDs display the destination and expected arrival times of the next two trams. They can also display any message the controllers want to display, such as information on delays or even direct instructions to vandals to stop placing objects on the track.

===Routes===
Tramlink is not shown on the standard [[tube map]], but is shown on the [[Tube map#Official versions of the tube map|&quot;London Connections&quot; map]]. The original route structure was Line 1 [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] to [[Elmers End station|Elmers End]], Line 2 Croydon to [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]], and Line 3 Croydon to [[New Addington tram stop|New Addington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tramlink p 10&quot;&gt;''Tramlink: Your top 10 questions answered…'' Poster, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 July 2006 the route network was restructured, with route 1 from Elmers End to Croydon and route 2 from Beckenham Junction to Croydon, running every 10 minutes Monday – Saturday daytime, every 30 minutes at other times, and route 3 from New Addington to Wimbledon every 7.5 minutes Monday – Saturday daytime, every 15 minutes at other times.

Since being taken over by TfL all routes have a maximum service interval of fifteen minutes service during all operational hours.

===Change in Route Colours===
When Transport for London took over operation and ownership a new network map was designed, combining Routes 1 and 2 as one service, coloured &quot;Trams Green&quot; (lime). (Originally, Line 1 was coloured yellow, Line 2 was red, and Line 3 was a darker ([[District line]]) green.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tramlink p 10&quot;/&gt;) However, the distinction is still made in practice, as trams from Elmers End on Route 1 change their numbers in central [[Croydon]] to Route 2 (Beckenham Junction) and do the reverse when working in the other direction.

===Fares and ticketing===
[[Image:Gb-tramlink-tickets.jpg|thumb|A Tramlink Ticket Machine]]

As part of the TfL network, all TfL Bus Passes are valid on Tramlink – as are [[Travelcard]]s that include any of zones 3, 4, 5 and 6.

Cash fares and pay-as-you-go [[Oyster Card]] fares are the same as on [[London Buses]], although special fares may apply when using Tramlink feeder buses.

When using Oyster Cards, passengers must touch in on the platform before boarding the tram. Special arrangements apply at [[Wimbledon station]], where the Tramlink stop is located within the [[National Rail]] and [[London Underground]] station.

==Rolling stock==
{{Main|CR4000}}

Tramlink is operated with 24 articulated [[low floor]] [[Flexity Swift]] [[CR4000]] trams built by [[Bombardier Transportation]] in [[Vienna]]. The trams are numbered beginning at 2530, continuing from the highest-numbered tram, number 2529 on [[Trams in London|London's former tram network]], which closed in 1952.

All trams have now been refurbished, including a repaint into a new livery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/news/Exclusive-End-era-Croydon-s-red-tram-turns-green/article-869210-detail/article.html|title=End of an era as Croydon's last red tram turns green}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2009|9}}, it was reported that four more trams were planned, and to avoid the extra costs of a short production run, Tramlink was seeking to lease these from [[Edinburgh Trams]], where the construction of new track and depot is facing long delays, but the rolling stock was due for delivery from early in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/4587166.Scottish_trams_diverted_to_Croydon/|title=Scottish trams diverted to Croydon |last=Truman|first=Peter|date=9 September 2009|work=[[Croydon Guardian]]|accessdate=10 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Edinburgh Tram (vehicle)|Edinburgh Tram]] will be manufactured by [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edinburghtrams.com/index.php/story_so_far/view_details/21/|title=Preparation and Procurement...Tram Vehicles|work=Edinburgh Trams: The story so far|publisher=Transport Initiatives Edinburgh|accessdate=10 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To accommodate the extra capacity, some sections of single-track line may be doubled.&lt;ref name=railnewsapril09&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.railnews.co.uk/news/metro/2009/04/01-tfl-croydon-tramlink.html|title=Hunt for trams in Europe as passenger numbers soar|last=Staff writer|date=1 April 2009|work=[[Railnews]]|accessdate=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2011 Tramtrack Croydon began tendering for the supply of an additional 10 new or second-hand trams for Tramlink to be supplied from the end of summer 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/london-tramlink-seeks-bids-for-additional-trams.html | title=London Tramlink seeks bids for additional trams | date=31 January 2011 | publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trams will be used between Central Croydon (or Therapia Lane) to Elmers End.&lt;ref&gt; Rail Magazine page 16, 'News In Brief – New Trams for Croydon' Issue 663, 9th – 22 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future Developments==
=== Projected extensions===
The Mayor's Transport Strategy for London states that extensions to the Tramlink network could be developed at relatively modest cost where there is potential demand from existing and new development to support concentrated passenger movements, and where Tramlink technology might be cost effective. Proposal 4D7 says that &quot;The Mayor will explore the potential for extending the Tramlink network where doing so could help meet the objectives of the Transport Strategy cost effectively&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/transport/pdf/final_ch04d.pdf London Dockland and Croydon Tramlink Extensions]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and sought initial views on the viability of a number of extensions by summer 2002.

An initial review of potential Tramlink extensions has been prepared and discussed with interested parties. TfL now wishes to carry out initial development and evaluation work on the following routes:

Other extension proposals include Lewisham, Bromley town centre, Biggin Hill Airport/Village and a local spur/loop to penetrate further into Purley Way retail/industrial park.

Starting in the west, there are two corridors that suggest bringing Tramlink to Sutton town centre. The first of these, proposing operations principally between Wimbledon and Sutton, has been in view even before Tramlink opened. Indeed, presumptuously, the trams were delivered with destination displays for this as “line 4” already included on blind sets.

''Then to East Croydon and back to Beckenham Junction or Crystal Palace''
|}
[[Tramlink route 4]], was the only extension being formally developed. The proposed route linked Harrington Road stop with Crystal Palace, and Crystal Palace directly with Beckenham Junction, both terminating at Crystal Palace Parade. There were three options on how to get to the Parade: on-street, off-street and a mixture of the two.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/trams/pdf/Crystal-Palace-2006-10-19.pdf Crystal Palace extension options to reach the Parade] [[Portable Document Format|PDF]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following recent consultation the off-street option is favoured, with trams running along existing railway as far as [[Crystal Palace railway station|Crystal Palace Station]], and then running round the western edge of [[Crystal Palace Park]] (within the current park's perimeter) to the bus terminus near the parade. TfL have currently stated that due to lack of funding the plans for this extension will not be taken forward,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/2055.aspx Tramlink extension to Crystal Palace]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also say that they are committed to including new proposals for extensions to the tram as part of a future bid to Government.

===Extension A===
The Sutton to Wimbledon proposal utilises the existing Tramlink infrastructure between Wimbledon and Morden Road stop. The cramped tram terminus inside Wimbledon station is barely adequate for its present function. If another service is to arrive at Wimbledon a new terminus will need to be created. Diverging from the present Croydon route the Sutton line might adopt segregated alignment within the highway along Morden Road, serving Morden station interchange. It would probably use Aberconway Road to reach Morden Hall Road before using the spacious St Helier Avenue as the direct route to St Helier, Rose Hill. St Helier Hospital is an important local traffic objective that Tramlink ought to serve, despite the need to deviate from the direct route into Sutton via Angel Hill. A number of variants in Sutton Town centre are to be examined to see how the shopping centre, station and office complex can be accessed.
The alignment is presently served by a number of busy bus services and if built, would give Tramlink patrons direct interchange with the Northern Line at Morden. A south-to-east curve may also be considered at Morden Road to permit direct operations that link St Helier to Mitcham and Croydon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/19 Proposals to extend the Tramlink system] Always Touch Out&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extension B===
The other Sutton proposal – to Tooting – is more ambitious and undoubtedly contains many more challenges than Sutton/Wimbledon link. Apart from workshop/depot facilities and a curve required to link the line into the existing system, this extension would share no infrastructure with the existing Tramlink. Were “line 4” to be realised ahead of this proposal, the Tooting line would of course then have the St Helier to Sutton section in common. North of St Helier, the alignment is likely to fit across parkland and open space to take in the Willow Lane Industrial Estate before serving Mitcham town centre. Some commonality would be enjoyed here with the short separate proposal to provide a spur from Mitcham Junction to Mitcham town centre. From here, the Tooting projection would seek to use the pedestrianised town centre section before sharing carriageway with all traffic in the part of London Road south of Figge’s Marsh, with room for segregation beyond the junction with Streatham Road. The most difficult leg arises immediately the Merton/Wandsworth boundary is crossed and the most effective way of reaching Tooting Broadway from this point will stir much debate.

===North and south from Croydon===
[[Image:Gb-tramlink-croydoncentre-09.jpg|right|thumb|A tram travelling on Church Street, Croydon]]
To the north and south of Croydon are some busy bus corridors, which themselves derive from earlier tram routes. These include the [[Purley, London|Purley]] – Croydon – [[Streatham]] corridor, which is proposed for conversion to tram operation.&lt;ref name=SLTBrochure&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.tramlink.co.uk/extensions/SLTBrochure.pdf | format = PDF | title = South London Trams – Transport for Everyone – The case for extensions to Tramlink | publisher=South London Partnership | accessdate = 2 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spext&gt;{{Cite web | title = Tramlink Extensions | url = http://www.tramlink.co.uk/extensions/index.shtml | publisher=Croydon Tramlink – The Unofficial Site | accessdate = 2 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the south of Croydon, the proposal is for the new route to diverge from the existing central Croydon loop and use a highway alignment, probably using South End and Brighton Road, to Purley. Beyond Purley, an extension to [[Coulsdon]] will be investigated. As this would be close to the [[M23 motorway]], a possibility would be the construction of a [[park and ride]] site. However, finding a good alignment will be more difficult south of Purley, where Brighton Road carries the heavy traffic of the [[A23 road|A23 trunk road]].&lt;ref name=&quot;spext&quot;/&gt;

To the north of Croydon, it is again proposed to use a highway alignment based on London Road. To the south of [[Thornton Heath Pond]], the use of a shared carriageway is a possibility. North of this point, the road becomes the A23 again, but there are likely to be some opportunities for [[trambaan]] type segregation to [[Norbury]] and between Norbury and Streatham, although Norbury itself is a pinch point. The proposal is to terminate the line at [[Streatham railway station]], providing an interchange to the extended [[East London Line]].&lt;ref name=&quot;spext&quot;/&gt;

===Other extensions===
Work currently commissioned will also check out proposals to extend Tramlink to [[Biggin Hill]], [[Bromley]] town centre, [[Lewisham]], and [[Purley Way]]. If initial examination shows promise, further work could follow to firm up more detailed routings for these proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/misc/print.php?artid=572767|title=Tram network prepares to spread its wings across southern region|accessdate=16 November 2007 |publisher=[[Newsquest|This is Local London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SpiderCatenary.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The silk on a spider's web forming multiple elastic catenaries.]]
In [[physics]] and [[geometry]], the '''catenary ''' is the curve that an idealised hanging [[chain]] or [[cable]] assumes when supported at its ends and acted on only by its own weight. The curve is the graph of the [[hyperbolic cosine]] function, and has a U-like shape, superficially similar in appearance to a [[parabola]] (though mathematically quite different). Its [[surface of revolution]], the [[catenoid]], is a [[minimal surface]] and is the shape assumed by a soap film bounded by two parallel circular rings.

==History==
The word ''catenary'' is derived from the Latin word ''catena,'' which means &quot;[[chain]]&quot;. Huygens first used the term ''catenaria'' in a letter to Leibniz in 1690. However, [[Thomas Jefferson]] is usually credited with the English word ''catenary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pballew.net/arithme8.html#catenary |title=&quot;Catenary&quot; at Math Words |publisher=Pballew.net |date=1995-11-21 |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The curve is also called the &quot;alysoid&quot;, &quot;chainette&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;MathWorld&quot;&gt;MathWorld&lt;/ref&gt; or, particularly in the material sciences, &quot;funicular&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'':  {{cite book |title=Structures |last=Shodek |first=Daniel L. |year=2004 |edition=5th |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=9780130488794 |page=22 |oclc=148137330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often stated&lt;ref&gt;For example Lockwood p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] thought that the curve followed by a hanging chain is a parabola. A careful reading of his book ''Two new sciences''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dialogues concerning two new sciences|last=Galileo Galilei|others=Trans.

&lt;/ref&gt; shows this to be an oversimplification. Galileo discusses the catenary in two places; in the dialog of the Second Day he states that a hanging chain resembles a parabola. But later, in the dialog of the Fourth Day, he gives more details, and states that a hanging cord is approximated by a parabola, correctly observing that this approximation improves as the curvature gets smaller and is almost exact when the elevation is less than 45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;. That the curve followed by a chain is not a parabola was proven by [[Joachim Jungius]] (1587–1657) and published [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously]] in 1669.&lt;ref&gt;Swetz, Faauvel, Bekken, &quot;Learn from the Masters,&quot; 1997, MAA ISBN 0-88385-703-0, pp.128-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lockwood p. 124&quot;&gt;Lockwood p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of the catenary to the construction of arches is due to [[Robert Hooke]], who discovered it in the context of the rebuilding of [[St Paul's Cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/532102 &quot;Monuments and Microscopes: Scientific Thinking on a Grand Scale in the Early Royal Society&quot; by Lisa Jardine]&lt;/ref&gt; possibly having seen Huygens' work on the catenary. (Some much older arches are also approximate catenaries.)

In 1671, Hooke announced to the [[Royal Society]] that he had solved the problem of the optimal shape of an arch, and in 1675 published an encrypted solution as a Latin [[anagram]]&lt;ref&gt;[[cf.]] the anagram for [[Hooke's law]], which appeared in the next paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; in an appendix to his ''Description of Helioscopes,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindahall.org/events_exhib/exhibit/exhibits/civil/design.shtml |title=Arch Design |publisher=Lindahall.org |date=2002-10-28 |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
where he wrote that he had found &quot;a true mathematical and mechanical form of all manner of Arches for Building.&quot; He did not publish the solution of this anagram&lt;ref&gt;The original anagram was &quot;abcccddeeeeefggiiiiiiiillmmmmnnnnnooprrsssttttttuuuuuuuux&quot;: the letters of the Latin phrase, alphabetized.&lt;/ref&gt; in his lifetime, but in 1705 his executor provided it as ''Ut pendet continuum flexile, sic stabit contiguum rigidum inversum,'' meaning &quot;As hangs a flexible cable so, inverted, stand the touching pieces of an arch.&quot;

In 1691 [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Christiaan Huygens]], and [[Johann Bernoulli]] derived the [[equation]] in response to a challenge by [[Jakob Bernoulli]]. [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]] wrote a treatise on the catenary in 1697.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lockwood p. 124&quot;/&gt;

[[Euler]] proved in 1744 that the catenary is the curve which, when rotated about the ''x''-axis, gives the surface of minimum [[surface area]] (the [[catenoid]]) for the given bounding [[circle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MathWorld&quot;/&gt;

Catenary arches are often used in the construction of [[kiln]]s.

==Simple suspension bridges==
[[Image:CapilanoBridge.jpg|thumb|right|250px|In simple suspension bridges such as the [[Capilano Suspension Bridge]], where the weight runs parallel to the cables, the cables follow a catenary curve.]]
Free-hanging chains follow the catenary curve, but [[suspension bridge]] chains or cables do not hang freely since they support the weight of the bridge. In most cases the weight of the cable is negligible compared with the weight being supported. When the force exerted is uniform with respect to the length of the chain, as in a [[simple suspension bridge]], the result is a catenary.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

When the force exerted is uniform with respect to horizontal distance, as in a suspension bridge, the result is a parabola.&lt;ref&gt;

When suspension bridges are constructed, the suspension cables initially sag as the catenary curve, before being tied to the deck below, and then gradually assume a parabolic curve as additional connecting cables are tied to connect the main suspension cables with the bridge deck below.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Anchoring of marine objects==
The catenary form given by gravity is taken advantage of in its presence in heavy [[wikt:rode#Noun|anchor rodes]]. An anchor rode (or anchor line) usually consists of chain and/or cable. Anchor rodes are used by ships, oilrigs, docks, [[Floating wind turbine|wind turbines]] and other marine assets which must be anchored to the seabed.

Particularly with larger vessels, the catenary curve given by the weight of the rode presents a lower angle of pull on the anchor or mooring device. This assists the performance of the anchor and raises the level of force it will resist before dragging. With smaller vessels and in shallow water it is less effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petersmith.net.nz/boat-anchors/catenary.php |title=Chain, Rope, and Catenary - Anchor Systems For Small Boats |publisher=Petersmith.net.nz |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The catenary curve in this context is only fully present in the anchoring system when the rode has been lifted clear of the seabed by the vessel's pull, as the seabed obviously affects its shape while it supports the chain or cable. There is also typically a section of rode above the water and thus unaffected by buoyancy, creating a slightly more complicated curve.

:&lt;math&gt;y = a \, \cosh \left ({x \over a} \right ) = {a \over 2} \, \left (e^{x/a} + e^{-x/a} \right )&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\cosh&lt;/math&gt; is the [[hyperbolic function|hyperbolic cosine function]].

The [[Whewell equation]] for the catenary is
:&lt;math&gt;\tan \varphi = \frac{s}{a}&lt;/math&gt;.

Differentiating gives
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\varphi}{ds} = \frac{\cos^2\varphi}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
and eliminating &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; gives the [[Cesàro equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\kappa=\frac{a}{s^2+a^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Other properties===

All catenary curves are [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to each other. Changing the parameter ''a'' is equivalent to a uniform scaling of the curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xahlee.org/SpecialPlaneCurves_dir/Catenary_dir/catenary.html |title=Catenary |publisher=Xahlee.org |date=2003-05-28 |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A parabola rolled along a straight line traces out a catenary (see [[roulette (curve)|roulette]]) with its [[Focus (geometry)|focus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MathWorld&quot;/&gt;

[[Square wheel]]s can roll perfectly smoothly if the road has evenly spaced bumps in the shape of a series of inverted catenary curves. The wheels can be any regular polygon except a triangle, but the catenary must have parameters corresponding to the shape and dimensions of the wheels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/RouletteAComfortableRideOnAnNGonBicycle/ &quot;Roulette: A Comfortable Ride on an n-gon Bicycle&quot;] by Borut Levart, [[Wolfram Demonstrations Project]], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[surface of revolution]] with fixed radii at either end that has minimum surface area is a catenary revolved about the x-axis.

Over any horizontal interval, the ratio of the area under the caternary to its length equals a, independent of the interval selected. The catenary is the only plane curve other than a horizontal line with this property. Also, the geometric centroid of the area under a stretch of catenary is the midpoint of the perpendicular segment connecting the centroid of the curve itself and the x-axis.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Edward (2010), &quot;A Property Characterizing the Catenary&quot;, ''Mathematics Magazine'' '''83''': 63-64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis===

We assume that the path followed by the chain is given [[parametric equations|parametrically]] by
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = (x, y) = (x(s),\ y(s))&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; represents [[arc length]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[position vector]]. This is the
[[Unit speed parametrization|natural parameterization]] and has the property that &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{ds}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[unit tangent vector]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;. The derivation of the curve for an optimal arch is similar except that the forces of tension become forces of compression and everything is inverted.

It is now possible to derive two equations which together define the shape of the curve and the [[Tension (physics)|tension]] of the chain at each point. This is done by a careful inspection of the various forces acting on a small segment of the chain and using the fact that these forces must be in balance if the chain is in [[static equilibrium]].

First, let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}=\mathbf{T}(s)&lt;/math&gt; be the force of tension as a function of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. The chain is flexible so it can only exert a force parallel to itself. Since tension is defined as the force that the chain exerts on itself, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; must be parallel to the chain. In other words,
:&lt;math&gt;(1)\qquad\mathbf{T} = T \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt;, a positive scalar function of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.

Second, let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}=\mathbf{G}(s)&lt;/math&gt; be the external force per unit length acting on a small segment of a chain as a function of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. The forces acting on the segment of the chain between &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s+\Delta s&lt;/math&gt; are the force of tension &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}(s+\Delta s)&lt;/math&gt; at one end of the segment, the nearly opposite force &lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{T}(s)&lt;/math&gt; at the other end, and the external force acting on the segment which is
approximately &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}\Delta s&lt;/math&gt;. These forces must balance so
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}(s+\Delta s)-\mathbf{T}(s)+\mathbf{G}\Delta s \approx \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;.
Divide by &lt;math&gt;\Delta s&lt;/math&gt; and take the limit as &lt;math&gt;\Delta s \to 0&lt;/math&gt; to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;(2)\qquad\frac{d\mathbf{T}}{ds} + \mathbf{G} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that, up till now, no assumptions have been made regarding the force &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}&lt;/math&gt;, so equations (1) and (2) can be used as the starting point in the analysis of a flexible chain acting under any external force. The next step is to put in the specific expression for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}&lt;/math&gt; and solve the resulting equations.

In this case, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G} = (0, -\lambda g)&lt;/math&gt; where the chain has constant mass per unit length &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and the only external force acting on the chain is that of a uniform [[gravitational field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g} = (0, -g)&lt;/math&gt;. So we have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{T}}{ds} = (0, \lambda g)&lt;/math&gt;.

Integrating we get,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = (c, \lambda g s + d)&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that at the minimum the curve is horizontal and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = T \mathbf{u} = T (1, 0) = (T, 0) = (c, \lambda g s + d)&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the tension of the chain at its lowest point this point occurs at &lt;math&gt;s = -d/\lambda g&lt;/math&gt;. The point from which &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is measured is arbitrary, so pick this point to be the minimum, giving &lt;math&gt;d = 0&lt;/math&gt;. The equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = (c, \lambda g s)&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the horizontal component of the tension is a constant.

From here, we can continue the derivation in two ways.

====Alternative 1====

If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[tangential angle]] of the curve then
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; is parallel to &lt;math&gt;(1, \tan \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; so

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \varphi = \frac{\lambda g s}{c}&lt;/math&gt;.

Write &lt;math&gt;a = \frac{c}{\lambda g}&lt;/math&gt; to combine constants and obtain the [[Whewell equation]] for the curve,

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \varphi = \frac{s}{a}&lt;/math&gt;.

In general, parametric equations can be obtained from a Whewell equation by integrating:

: &lt;math&gt;x = \int \cos \varphi \, ds&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y = \int \sin \varphi \, ds&lt;/math&gt;

To find these integrals, make the substitution &lt;math&gt;\tan{\varphi} = \sinh u&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\varphi = \mbox{gd} u&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mbox{gd}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gudermannian function]]).

Then &lt;math&gt;s = a \ \sinh u&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;x = \int \cos {\varphi} ds = \int \mbox{sech} u \, a \cosh u du = a \int du = au + \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = \int \sin {\varphi} ds = \int \tanh u \, a \cosh u du = a \int \sinh u du = a \cosh u + \beta&lt;/math&gt;.

We can eliminate u to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;y = a \cosh \frac{x-\alpha}{a} + \beta&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are constants to be determined, along with &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, by the [[boundary conditions]] of the problem. Usually these conditions include two points from which the chain is being suspended and the length of the chain.

====Alternative 2====

From
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = T \mathbf{u} = T \left(\frac{dx}{ds}, \frac{dy}{ds}\right) = (c, \lambda g s)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{ds}\left/\frac{dx}{ds}\right. = \frac{\lambda g s}{c} = \frac{s}{a}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;a = \frac{c}{\lambda g},&lt;/math&gt; same as before. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{ds} =1\left/\frac{ds}{dx}\right. = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\left(\dfrac{dy}{dx}\right)^2}} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+s^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{ds} = \frac{dy}{dx}\cdot\frac{dx}{ds} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{a^2+s^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The integrals of the right hand sides of these equations can be found using [[List of integrals of irrational functions|standard techniques]] giving

:&lt;math&gt;x = a\ \operatorname{arcsinh}(s/a) + \alpha,\ y = \sqrt{a^2+s^2} + \beta&lt;/math&gt;.

Isolating &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in the first equation and using the result to substitute &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in the second equation gives

:&lt;math&gt;y = a \cosh \frac{x-\alpha}{a} + \beta&lt;/math&gt;

as before, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are constants to be determined, along with &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, by the [[boundary conditions]] of the problem, which is exact the same result as that obtained with [[Catenary#Alternative 1|alternative 1]].

==Variations==
===Elastic catenary===
In an elastic catenary, the cable replaced by a spring and is no longer assumed to be of fixed density, but is allowed to stretch in accordance with [[Hooke's Law]]. In this case, the mass per unit length is no longer constant but can be given as

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{\lambda_0}{1+\epsilon T}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt; is the mass per unit length for the chain in its relaxed state and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the [[spring constant]]. As in the earlier derivation,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{T}}{ds} = (0, \lambda g)&lt;/math&gt;.

So the horizontal component of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T \cos \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a constant c. Putting this into the equation for density produces

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{\lambda_0}{1+ c\epsilon \sec \varphi}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the equation for the vertical component of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{ds}(T \sin \varphi) = c\frac{d}{ds} (\tan \varphi) = \frac{g\lambda_0}{1+ c\epsilon \sec \varphi}&lt;/math&gt;,

or, combining constants,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{ds} (\tan \varphi) = \frac{1}{a+ b\sec \varphi}&lt;/math&gt;.

Using the substitution &lt;math&gt;\tan{\varphi} = \sinh u&lt;/math&gt; gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{ds} (\sinh u) = \cosh u \frac{du}{ds} = \frac{1}{a+ b\cosh u}&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; \cosh u (a+ b\cosh u) = \frac{ds}{du}&lt;/math&gt;.

Parametric equations can be obtained by integrating:

: &lt;math&gt;x = \int \cos \varphi \, ds = \int \mbox{sech} u \cosh u (a+ b\cosh u)du = \int (a+ b\cosh u)du= au + b\sinh u + \alpha &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;y = \int \sin \varphi \, ds = \int \tanh u \cosh u (a+ b\cosh u)du = \int \sinh u(a+ b\cosh u)du = a\cosh u + \tfrac{b}{2}\sinh^2 u + \beta &lt;/math&gt;.

When ''b'' = 0, corresponding to a completely inelastic cable, this is simply the catenary. When ''a'' = 0, corresponding to the case there the cable essentially has length 0 in its relaxed state, similar to a [[Slinky]], this is a [[parabola]]. When ''a'' and ''b'' are both &gt;0 then the curve is intermediate between a catenary and a parabola.

===Equal resistance catenary===
In an equal resistance catenary, cable is strengthened according to the magnitude of the tension at each point, so its resistance to breaking is constant along its length. Assuming that the strength of the cable is proportional to its density, the mass per unit length can be given as

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \lambda_r T&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_r&lt;/math&gt; is the mass per unit length per unit of tension force required for the chain to resist breaking. As in the earlier derivation,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{T}}{ds} = (0, \lambda g)&lt;/math&gt;.

So the horizontal component of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T \cos \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a constant c. Putting this into the equation for density produces

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \lambda_r c \sec \varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the equation for the vertical component of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{ds}(T \sin \varphi) = c\frac{d}{ds} (\tan \varphi) = g \lambda_r c \sec \varphi&lt;/math&gt;,

or, combining constants,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{ds} (\tan \varphi) = \frac{1}{a} \sec \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{ds}\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right) = \frac{1}{a} \frac{ds}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;.

Multiplying both sides by &lt;math&gt;ds/dx&lt;/math&gt; gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{1}{a} \left(\frac{ds}{dx}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{a} \left[1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

This can be reduced to a differential equation of degree one using [[separation of variables]] to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\arctan \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{x}{a}-\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \tan\left(\frac{x}{a}-\alpha\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Another integration produces

:&lt;math&gt;y = -a\ln \cos\left(\frac{x}{a}-\alpha\right) + \beta&lt;/math&gt;.

===Towed cables===
Instead of gravity, we assume we have a cylindrical cable that is acted on by drag forces due to the movement of some surrounding fluid (for example, air or water). The velocity relative to the cable is assumed to be a constant &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = (0, -v)&lt;/math&gt;. (Velocity is assumed to be vertical here to preserve similarities with the gravitational case.) To compute the force due to drag, write &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}_u + \mathbf{v}_n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_n&lt;/math&gt; respectively are the components parallel to and orthogonal to the cable. The cable is assumed to be smooth so the force on the cable due to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_u&lt;/math&gt; is taken to be negligible. The force acting on the cable, following the [[Drag equation]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G} = -c |\mathbf{v}_n|^2 \mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a constant depending on the density of the fluid, the diameter of the cable, and the [[Drag coefficient]]. If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} = (-\sin\varphi,\ \cos\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the unit normal vector, then
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_n = \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n}\ \mathbf{n} = -\cos\varphi\ \mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;.
So
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G} = -c \cos^2\varphi\ \mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

From equations (1) and (2) above,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{T}}{ds} = \frac{dT}{ds} \mathbf{u} + T\frac{d\mathbf{u}}{ds} 
= \frac{dT}{ds} \mathbf{u} + T\frac{d\varphi}{ds}\mathbf{n} = c \cos^2\varphi\ \mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;.
Setting the coefficients of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; equal produces
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dT}{ds} = 0,\,T\frac{d\varphi}{ds} = c \cos^2\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.
So T is a constant in this case and combining constants in the second equation gives
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\varphi}{ds} = \frac{\cos^2\varphi}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
which is one of the equations for the catenary given above. This is a case where a different expression for the force acting on the chain/cable produce the same curve but a different expression for tension.

In applications, the force of gravity and additional terms in the force due to drag may be added to the expression for force, yielding equations that must be solved numerically.

==Alternative analysis==
[[File:Catenary.gif|thumb|350px|Figure 1: The forces acting on the two extremes of a segment of a catenary decomposed into horizontal and vertical components]]
The forces acting on a segment of catenary curve are shown in the figure at right.

The vector sum of the forces acting on the segment from the two extremities and from the gravitational force must be zero. As the gravitational force is directed downwards the horizontal components of the forces acting on the extremes must have the same magnitude. As this is true for any segment of the catenary this is a fixed constant for the whole of the catenary. Denoting this constant with &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; one gets that the vertical component of the force at the left extreme &lt;math&gt; x_1&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; -f \ y^\prime(x_1)&lt;/math&gt; and at the right extreme &lt;math&gt; x_2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; f \ y^\prime(x_2)&lt;/math&gt;
The path length of the curve representing a function &lt;math&gt; y(x)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; varying from &lt;math&gt; x_1 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; x_2 &lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt; 
\int\limits_{x_1}^{x_2}\sqrt{1+{y^\prime}^2} dx
&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational constant and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mass per length unit of the chain the gravitational force acting on the arc from &lt;math&gt; x_1 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; x_2 &lt;/math&gt; is 
&lt;math&gt;g \rho \int\limits_{x_1}^{x_2}\sqrt{1+{y^\prime}^2} dx \,&lt;/math&gt;

This force must be compensated by the vertical components of the forces acting on the two extremes of the arc, i.e.
#  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;f \ (y^\prime(x_2)-y^\prime(x_1)) \,= g \rho \int\limits_{x_1}^{x_2}\sqrt{1+{y^\prime}^2} dx&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Denoting the constant ratio &lt;math&gt;\frac {f}{ g \rho}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and taking the derivative of equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) with respect to the upper limit of the integral, i.e. with respect to &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;, one gets

:&lt;math&gt;y^{\prime\prime} = \frac{1 }{a} \sqrt{1+{y^\prime}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Denoting &lt;math&gt;y^\prime&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; this equation takes the form 
:&lt;math&gt;z^\prime = \frac{dz}{dx}= \frac{1 }{a} \sqrt{1+z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

which means that for the inverse function &lt;math&gt;x(z)&lt;/math&gt; one has

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dz}= \frac{a }{\sqrt{1+z^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

which integrates to

:&lt;math&gt;x= a \ \sinh^{-1}(z) + x_0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is the constant of integration or equivalently
:&lt;math&gt;z=y^\prime=\sinh(\frac{x-x_0 }{a})&lt;/math&gt;

Again integrating with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; one gets
#  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;y=a \ \cosh(\frac{x-x_0 }{a})\ +\ y_0&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; is the second constant of integration

The lowest point of this curve has the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\ x_0\ ,\ y_0 + a)&lt;/math&gt;

The length of the curve given by ({{EquationNote|2}}) from &lt;math&gt;x=x_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x=x_2&lt;/math&gt; is
#  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;l=\int\limits_{x_1}^{x_2}\sqrt{1+{y^\prime}^2} dx = \left [a \sinh \frac{x-x_0}{a} \right ]_{x_1}^{x_2}\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

This family of solutions is parametrized with the 3 parameters &lt;math&gt;a,\ x_0,\ y_0 &lt;/math&gt;. For any concrete case these 3 parameters must be computed to fit the boundary value conditions. In a typical case the form of a chain having a given length l and being attached 
in two fixed point with the coordinates &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2,\ y_2&lt;/math&gt; relative a vertical coordinate system should be computed.

This means that &lt;math&gt;a,\ x_0,\ y_0 &lt;/math&gt; have to be determined such that 
#  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;y_1=a \ \cosh(\frac{x_1-x_0 }{a})\ +\ y_0&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}
#  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;y_2=a \ \cosh(\frac{x_2-x_0 }{a})\ +\ y_0&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}
#  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;l= a \left (\sinh \frac{x_2-x_0}{a}\ -\ \sinh \frac{x_1-x_0}{a} \right )&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

Setting 
:&lt;math&gt;x_m=\frac{x_2+x_1 }{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x=\frac{x_2-x_1 }{2}&lt;/math&gt;
subtracting ({{EquationNote|4}}) from ({{EquationNote|5}}) and then dividing with &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; one gets

#  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{y_2-y_1 }{a} = \cosh\left (\frac{x_m-x_0 }{a}+\frac{\Delta x}{a}\right) - 
\cosh\left (\frac{x_m-x_0 }{a}-\frac{\Delta x}{a}\right) =
2 \sinh \frac{x_m-x_0 }{a} \sinh \frac{\Delta x }{a}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

For any given values &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ y_1,\ x_2,\ y_2,\ a&lt;/math&gt; one can determine &lt;math&gt;\sinh \frac{x_m-x_0 }{a}&lt;/math&gt; from ({{EquationNote|7}}) 

When &lt;math&gt;\sinh \frac{x_m-x_0 }{a}&lt;/math&gt; has been determined &lt;math&gt;\frac{x_m-x_0 }{a}&lt;/math&gt; is computed by solving a quadratic equation. 

In case &lt;math&gt;y_1=y_2&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. in the case that the two attachment points are at the same height, one has that &lt;math&gt;x_0=x_m&lt;/math&gt; and that the length is 
&lt;math&gt;l= 2\ a \left (\sinh \frac{\Delta x}{a} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

With &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; known ({{EquationNote|4}}) or ({{EquationNote|5}}) can subsequently be used to determine &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt;.

Having determined &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; with the algorithm just described the curve length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the selected &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; value can be computed from ({{EquationNote|6}}). With an iterative algorithm the &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; value that corresponds to a certain curve length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; can finally be derived.

[[File:Catenary boundary values.svg|thumb|right|350px|Figure 2:The red line corresponds to parameters X&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and Y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + a determined with the algorithm described above for different values of a]]

From figure 1 it is further clear that the tension of the chain at any point &lt;math&gt;(x\ ,\ y)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f \sqrt{1+{y^\prime}^2} = f \cosh \frac{x-x_0}{a}=f\ \frac{y-y_0}{a}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f=a\ g\ \rho&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the constant horizontal force component

If the mass density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is not constant but varies depending on some law the resulting differential equation will in most cases not have a closed form analytic solution. But the resulting curve can still be determined with arbitrary accuracy by the numerical integration of the differential equations

:&lt;math&gt;y^\prime = z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z^\prime = \frac{g}{f}\ \ \rho(z) \sqrt{1+z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Given any initial values for &lt;math&gt;y(x1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z(x1)&lt;/math&gt; and any value for the parameter &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; these differential equations can be propagated to &lt;math&gt;x=x_2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; specified as any function of the state variable &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. The free parameters to be iteratively adjusted to fit the boundary constraints are now &lt;math&gt;z(x1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. They can for example be adjusted iteratively such that &lt;math&gt;y(x2)=y_2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;(x_2\ ,\ y_2)&lt;/math&gt; is the second attachment point. This leaves an additional degree of freedom for the two parameters that can be used to get the correct length of the curve.

An example is the &quot;elastic catenary&quot; for which the force 
:&lt;math&gt;f \sqrt{1+{y^\prime}^2} =  f \sqrt{1+z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

stretches the material with a factor 
:&lt;math&gt;1\ +\ \epsilon f \ \sqrt{1+z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is an elasticity coefficient and that therefore the mass density (mass per unit length) is 
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac {\rho_0}  {1\ +\ \epsilon f\ \sqrt{1+z^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the mass density of the material in the absence of stress.

A case where a closed form mathematical solution is possible is the case of &quot;the equal resistance catenary&quot; where the mass density (mass per unit length) is proportional to the force &lt;math&gt;f \sqrt{1+{y^\prime}^2} =  f \sqrt{1+z^2}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. 
:&lt;math&gt;\rho =  \rho_0  \sqrt{1+z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_0  &lt;/math&gt; is the density at the lowest point

Setting &lt;math&gt;a=\frac {f}{ g \rho_0}&lt;/math&gt; the differential equations now take the form

:&lt;math&gt;y^\prime = z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z^\prime = \frac{1}{a}\  \left( 1+z^2 \right )&lt;/math&gt;

what means that for the inverse function &lt;math&gt;x(z)&lt;/math&gt; one has

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dz}= \frac{a }{1+z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

which is integrate to

:&lt;math&gt;x= a \ \arctan(z) + x_0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is the constant of integration or equivalently
:&lt;math&gt;z=y^\prime=\tan(\frac{x-x_0 }{a})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is constraint to an interval &lt;math&gt;x_0 -a \ \frac{\pi}{2} &lt; x &lt; x_0 +a \  \frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Again integrating with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; one gets
:&lt;math&gt;y=y_0 \ -a\ln \left (\cos \left (\frac{x-x_0 }{a}\right )\right )&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; is the second constant of integration.

As &lt;math&gt;a \ \sinh \frac{C}{a} \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;a \ \to 0&lt;/math&gt; for any constant &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; it follows from ({{EquationNote|6}}) that by making a catenary that is fixed at two points sufficiently long the constant horizontal force component &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can be made arbitrarily small. For this generalized &quot;catenary of equal resistance&quot; this is no longer true, as &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; must be larger than &lt;math&gt;\frac{|x-x_0|}{\frac{\pi}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt; x_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x_2 &lt;/math&gt; the positions of the two attachment points and the density &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; at the lowest point impose a lower limit for the fixed horizontal force component &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;

==Alternative analysis &quot;towed cables&quot; ==
The following figure illustrates a segment of a cable that is fixed in both ends and exposed to drag.
[[File:Catenary drag.svg|thumb|300px|The forces acting on a cable subject to drag. The medium causing the drag is moving downwards. The drag force is orthogonal to the cable and the forces acting on the two extremities of the segment compensate the net drag force on the segment]]

The velocity relative to the cable is assumed to be constant and the coordinate system is selected such that this velocity is in the -y direction, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = (0, -v)&lt;/math&gt;. To compute the force due to drag, write &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}_u + \mathbf{v}_n&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_n&lt;/math&gt; respectively are the components parallel to and orthogonal to the cable. The cable is assumed to be smooth so the force on the cable due to 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_u&lt;/math&gt; is taken to be negligible. The force acting on the cable, per unit length, following the [[Drag equation]] is therefore
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G} = f(x) \mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;
with 

#  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;f(x)= c\ v^2 \ {n_y}^2&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a constant depending on the density of the fluid, the diameter of the cable, and the [[Drag coefficient]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} = (n_x\ ,\ n_y)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the unit normal vector.

For any curve &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt; the tangent (unit vector) is 
#  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;(t_x\ ,\ t_y)=\frac{(1\ ,\ y^')}{\sqrt{1+{y^'}^2}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

and the normal (unit vector) is 
#  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;(n_x\ ,\ n_y)=\frac{(y^'\ ,\ -1)}{\sqrt{1+{y^'}^2}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

From ({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|3}}) follows that

#  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;f(x)= c\ v^2 \ \frac{1}{1+{y^'}^2}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

From ({{EquationNote|3}}) and ({{EquationNote|4}}) follows that the x-component of the total force on the segment of the curve from &lt;math&gt;x= x_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x= x_2&lt;/math&gt; is

#  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;F_x = \int\limits_{x_1}^{x_2} f(x)\ n_x\ \sqrt{1+{y^'}^2}  dx = c\ v^2 \int\limits_{x_1}^{x_2}\frac{y^'}{1+{y^'}^2}\ dx&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

and the component in the y-direction is
#  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;F_y =\int\limits_{x_1}^{x_2} f(x)\ n_y\ \sqrt{1+{y^'}^2}  dx
=   c\ v^2 \int\limits_{x_1}^{x_2}\frac{-1}{1+{y^'}^2}\ dx&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

If now
:&lt;math&gt;y^'=\sinh(\frac{x-x_0}{a})&lt;/math&gt;

one has that

:&lt;math&gt;1+{y^'}^2=\cosh^2(\frac{x-x_0}{a})&lt;/math&gt;

and from ({{EquationNote|2}}),({{EquationNote|5}}) and ({{EquationNote|6}}) that
#  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
F_x = &amp;  c\ v^2 \int\limits_{x_1}^{x_2}
\frac{\sinh(\frac{x-x_0}{a})}{\cosh^2(\frac{x-x_0}{a})}\ dx =
 -\left[\frac{c\ v^2\ a}{\cosh(\frac{x-x_0}{a})}\right]_{x_1}^{x_2}= \\
&amp;-\left[\frac{c\ v^2\ a}{\sqrt{1+{y^'}^2}}\right]_{x_1}^{x_2} \ = -c\ v^2\ a\ (t_x(x_2)-t_x(x_1)) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

#  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
F_y = &amp;   c\ v^2 \int\limits_{x_1}^{x_2}\frac{-1}{\cosh^2(\frac{x-x_0}{a})}\ dx =
 -\left[\frac{c\ v^2\ a\ \sinh(\frac{x-x_0}{a})}{\cosh(\frac{x-x_0}{a})}\right]_{x_1}^{x_2}= \\
 &amp;-\left[\frac{c\ v^2\ a\ y^'}{\sqrt{1+{y^'}^2}}\right]_{x_1}^{x_2}= -c\ v^2\ a\ (t_y(x_2)-t_y(x_1)) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

If the now the force in the cable is 
:&lt;math&gt;F\ =c\ v^2\ a\ &lt;/math&gt;

the force at the right extreme of the cable segment is 
:&lt;math&gt;  c\ v^2 \ a\ ( t_x(x_2)\ ,\ t_y(x_2) ) &lt;/math&gt;

and at the left extreme 
:&lt;math&gt; -c\ v^2 \ a\ ( t_x(x_1)\ ,\ t_y(x_1) ) &lt;/math&gt;
 
From ({{EquationNote|7}}) and ({{EquationNote|8}}) follows that the vector sum of these forces is precisely the force needed to counteract the forces on the segment caused by the drag

'''Color temperature''' is a characteristic of [[visible light]] that has important applications in lighting, photography, videography, publishing, manufacturing, astrophysics, and other fields. The color temperature of a light source is the [[temperature]] of an ideal [[black body|black-body radiator]] that radiates light of comparable [[hue]] to that of the light source.  Color temperature is conventionally stated in the unit of absolute temperature, the [[kelvin]], having the unit symbol K.

Color temperatures over {{gaps|5,000|K}} are called ''cool colors'' (blueish white), while lower color temperatures (2,700–3,000&amp;nbsp;K) are called ''warm colors'' (yellowish white through red).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color12.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This permits the definition of a standard by which light sources are compared.

To the extent that a hot surface emits [[thermal radiation]] but is not an ideal black-body radiator, the color temperature of the light is not the actual temperature of the surface. An [[incandescent light bulb]]'s light is thermal radiation and the bulb approximates an ideal black-body radiator, so its color temperature is essentially the temperature of the filament.

Many other light sources, such as [[fluorescent lamp]]s, emit light primarily by processes other than thermal radiation. This means the emitted radiation does not follow the form of a [[planck's law|black-body spectrum]]. These sources are assigned what is known as a [[Color temperature#Correlated color temperature|correlated color temperature]] (CCT). CCT is the color temperature of a black body radiator which to [[color vision|human color perception]] most closely matches the light from the lamp. Because such an approximation is not required for incandescent light, the CCT for an incandescent light is simply its unadjusted temperature, derived from the comparison to a black body radiator.

===The Sun===
As the Sun crosses the sky, it may appear to be red, orange, yellow or white depending on its position. The changing color of the sun over the course of the day is mainly a result of [[scattering]] of light, and is not due to changes in black-body radiation. The blue color of the sky is caused by [[Rayleigh scattering]] of the sunlight from the atmosphere, which tends to scatter blue light more than red light.

Daylight has a spectrum similar to that of a black body with a correlated color temperature of 6500K (D65 viewing standard) or 5500K (daylight-balanced photographic film standard).

For colors based on black body theory, blue occurs at higher temperatures, while red occurs at lower, cooler, temperatures. This is the opposite of the cultural associations attributed to colors, in which &quot;red&quot; is &quot;hot&quot;, and &quot;blue&quot; is &quot;cold&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

==Color temperature applications==
===Lighting===
[[File:Incand-3500-5500-color-temp-comparison.png|thumb|alt=Color Temperature comparison of common electric lamps.|Color Temperature comparison of common electric lamps.]]

For lighting building interiors, it is often important to take into account the color temperature of illumination. For example, a warmer (i.e., lower color temperature) light is often used in public areas to promote relaxation, while a cooler (higher color temperature) light is used to enhance concentration in offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Aquaculture===
In fishkeeping, color temperature has different functions and foci, for different branches.

* In freshwater aquaria, color temperature is generally of concern only for producing a more attractive display. Lights tend to be designed to produce an attractive spectrum, sometimes with secondary attention to keeping plants alive.

* In saltwater/reef aquaria, color temperatures are an essential part of tank health. Cooler temperatures are seen as getting through the water better, providing essential energy sources to the algae hosted in coral, that sustains it. Because coral receives intense, direct tropical sunlight, the focus was once on simulating this with 6,500&amp;nbsp;K lights. Higher temperature light sources have become more popular as their success became widely known...first 10,000&amp;nbsp;K, more recently 16,000&amp;nbsp;K and 20,000&amp;nbsp;K. Meanwhile, [[actinic]] lighting is used to make the somewhat [[fluorescent]] colors of many corals and fish &quot;pop&quot;, creating brighter &quot;display&quot; tanks.

===Digital photography===
In [[digital photography]], ''color temperature'' is sometimes used interchangeably with ''[[white balance]]'', which allow a remapping of color values to simulate variations in ambient color temperature. Most digital cameras and RAW image software provide presets simulating specific ambient values (e.g., sunny, cloudy, tungsten, etc.) while others allow explicit entry of [[white balance]] values in Kelvin. These settings vary color values along the blue–yellow axis, while some software includes additional controls (sometimes labeled ''tint'') adding the magenta–green axis, and are to some extent arbitrary and subject to artistic interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chriskern.net/essay/realityCheck.html |title=Reality Check: Ambiguity and Ambivalence in Digital Color Photography |last=Kern |first=Chris |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photographic film===
Photographic emulsion film sometimes appears to exaggerate the color of the light, since it does not adapt to lighting color as human visual perception does. An object that appears to the eye to be white may turn out to look very blue or orange in a photograph. The [[color balance]] may need to be corrected while shooting or while printing to achieve a neutral color print.

Photographic film is made for specific light sources (most commonly daylight film and [[tungsten film]]), and used properly, will create a neutral color print. Matching the [[sensitometry|sensitivity of the film]] to the color temperature of the light source is one way to balance color. If tungsten film is used indoors with incandescent lamps, the yellowish-orange light of the [[tungsten]] incandescent bulbs will appear as white (3,200&amp;nbsp;K) in the photograph.

[[filter (photography)|Filters]] on a camera lens, or [[color gel]]s over the light source(s) may also be used to correct color balance. When shooting with a bluish light (high color temperature) source such as on an overcast day, in the shade, in window light or if using tungsten film with white or blue light, a yellowish-orange filter will correct this. For shooting with daylight film (calibrated to 5,600&amp;nbsp;K) under warmer (low color temperature) light sources such as sunsets, candle light or tungsten lighting, a bluish (e.g., #80A) filter may be used.

If there is more than one light source with varied color temperatures, one way to balance the color is to use daylight film and place color-correcting gel filters over each light source.

Photographers sometimes use color temperature meters. Color temperature meters are usually designed to read only two regions along the visible spectrum (red and blue); more expensive ones read three regions (red, green, and blue). However, they are ineffective with sources such as fluorescent or discharge lamps, whose light varies in color and may be harder to correct for. Because it is often greenish, a magenta filter may correct it. More sophisticated [[colorimetry]] tools can be used where such meters are lacking.

===Desktop publishing===
In the desktop publishing industry, it is important to know a monitor’s color temperature. Color matching software, such as [[ColorSync]] will measure a monitor's color temperature and then adjust its settings accordingly. This enables on-screen color to more closely match printed color. Common monitor color temperatures, along with matching [[standard illuminant]]s in parentheses, are as follows:
*5,000 K (D50)
*5,500 K (D55)
*6,500 K ([[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]])
*7,500 K (D75)
*9,300 K.

Note: D50 is scientific shorthand for a [[Standard illuminant]]: the daylight spectrum at a correlated color temperature of 5,000&amp;nbsp;K.  (Similar definition for D55, D65 and D75.) Designations such as ''D50'' are used to help classify color temperatures of [[light table]]s and viewing booths. When viewing a [[Reversal film|color slide]] at a light table, it is important that the light be balanced properly so that the colors are not shifted towards the red or blue.

[[Digital camera]]s, web graphics, [[DVD]]s, etc. are normally designed for a 6,500&amp;nbsp;K color temperature. The [[sRGB color space|sRGB standard]] commonly used for images on the internet stipulates (among other things) a 6,500&amp;nbsp;K display whitepoint.

===TV, video, and digital still cameras===
The [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]] TV norms call for a compliant TV screen to display an electrically black and white signal (minimal color saturation) at a color temperature of 6,500&amp;nbsp;K. On many consumer-grade televisions, there is a very noticeable deviation from this requirement. However, higher-end consumer-grade televisions can have their color temperatures adjusted to 6,500&amp;nbsp;K by using a preprogrammed setting or a custom calibration. Current versions of [[ATSC (standards)|ATSC]] explicitly call for the color temperature data to be included in the data stream, but old versions of ATSC allowed this data to be omitted. In this case, current versions of ATSC cite default colorimetry standards depending on the format. Both of the cited standards specify a 6,500&amp;nbsp;K color temperature.

Most video and digital still cameras can adjust for color temperature by zooming into a white or neutral colored object and setting the manual &quot;white balance&quot; (telling the camera that &quot;this object is white&quot;); the camera then shows true white as white and adjusts all the other colors accordingly. White-balancing is necessary especially when indoors under fluorescent lighting and when moving the camera from one lighting situation to another. Most cameras also have an automatic white balance function that attempts to determine the color of the light and correct accordingly. While these settings were once unreliable, they are much improved in today's digital cameras, and will produce an accurate white balance in a wide variety of lighting situations.

===Artistic application via control of color temperature===
[[Image:Example different color temp.jpg|right|thumb|180px|The house above appears a light cream during the midday, but seems a bluish white here in the dim light before full sunrise. Note the different color temperature of the sunrise in the background.]]

Experimentation with color temperature is obvious in many [[Stanley Kubrick]] films; for instance in ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'' the light coming in from a window was almost always conspicuously blue, whereas the light from lamps on end tables was fairly orange. Indoor lights typically give off a yellow hue; fluorescent and natural lighting tends to be more blue.

Video [[camera operator]]s can white-balance objects which aren't white, downplaying the color of the object used for white-balancing. For instance, they can bring more warmth into a picture by white-balancing off something light blue, such as faded blue denim; in this way white-balancing can serve in place of a filter or lighting gel when those aren't available.

[[Cinematographer]]s do not &quot;white balance&quot; in the same way as video camera operators; they can use techniques such as filters, choice of film stock, [[pre-flashing]], and after shooting, [[color grading]] (both by exposure at the labs and also digitally). Cinematographers also work closely with set designers and lighting crews to achieve the desired effects.

For artists, most pigments and papers have a cool or warm cast, as the human eye can detect even a minute amount of saturation. Gray mixed with yellow, orange or red is a &quot;warm gray&quot;. Green, blue, or purple, create &quot;cool grays&quot;. Note that this sense of ''temperature'' is the reverse of that of real temperature; bluer is described as &quot;cooler&quot; even though it corresponds to a higher-temperature [[blackbody]].

[[Lighting designers]] sometimes select [[filter (optics)|filter]]s by color temperature, commonly to match light that is theoretically white. Since fixtures using [[Metal halide lamp|discharge]] type lamps produce a light of considerably higher color temperature than [[Incandescent light bulb|tungsten lamps]], using the two in conjunction could potentially produce a stark contrast, so sometimes fixtures with HID lamps, commonly producing light of 6,000–7,000&amp;nbsp;K, are fitted with
