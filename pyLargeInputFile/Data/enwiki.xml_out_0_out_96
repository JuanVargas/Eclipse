 in contexts that were later lost. For instance, in Sanskrit [[Velar consonant|velars]] (''k''-like sounds) were replaced by [[Palatal consonant|palatals]] (''ch''-like sounds) whenever the following vowel was ''*i'' or ''*e''.&lt;ref&gt;The asterisk (*) means that the sound is inferred/reconstructed, rather than historically documented or attested&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to this change, all instances of ''*e'' were replaced by ''a''.&lt;ref&gt;Or, more accurately, earlier ''*e'', ''*o'', and ''*a'' merged as ''a''.&lt;/ref&gt; The situation would have been unreconstructable, had not the original distribution of ''e'' and ''a'' been recoverable from the evidence of other [[Indo-European languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|pp=60–61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Latin]] suffix ''que'', &quot;and&quot;, preserves the original ''*e'' vowel that caused the consonant shift in Sanskrit:

[[Verner's Law]], discovered by [[Karl Verner]] in about 1875, is a similar case: the [[Voice (phonetics)|voicing]] of consonants in [[Germanic languages]] underwent a change that was determined by the position of the old Indo-European [[Stress (linguistics)|accent]]. Following the change, the accent shifted to initial position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|pp=130–131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Verner solved the puzzle by comparing the Germanic voicing pattern with Greek and Sanskrit accent patterns.

This stage of the comparative method, therefore, involves examining the correspondence sets discovered in step 2 and seeing which of them apply only in certain contexts. If two (or more) sets apply in [[complementary distribution]], they can be assumed to reflect a single original [[phoneme]]: &quot;some sound changes, particularly conditioned sound changes, can result in a proto-sound being associated with more than one correspondence set&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the following potential cognate list can be established for [[Romance languages]], which descend from [[Latin]]:

They evidence two correspondence sets, ''k : k'' and ''k : {{IPAlink|ʃ}}:

| align=center | &amp;nbsp;{{IPA|ʃ}}&amp;nbsp;
|}

Since French ''{{IPA|ʃ}}'' only occurs before ''a'' where the other languages also have ''a'', while French ''k'' occurs elsewhere, the difference is due to different environments (post-initial a or non-a) and the sets are complementary. They can therefore be assumed to reflect a single proto-phoneme (in this case ''*k'', spelled &lt;c&gt; in [[Latin language|Latin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The original words are corpus, crudus, catena and captiare, all with an initial k-sound. If more evidence along these lines were given, one might conclude to an alteration of the original k because of a different environment.

A more complex case involves consonant clusters in [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]]. The Algonquianist [[Leonard Bloomfield]] used the reflexes of the clusters in four of the daughter languages to reconstruct the following correspondence sets:&lt;ref&gt;The table is modified from that in {{harvnb|Campbell|2004|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

| align=center | &amp;nbsp;hk&amp;nbsp;
|}

Although all five correspondence sets overlap with one another in various places, they are not in complementary distribution, and so Bloomfield recognized that a different cluster must be reconstructed for each set; his reconstructions were, respectively, ''*hk'', ''*xk'', ''*čk'' (={{IPA|[t͡ʃk]}}), ''*šk'' (={{IPA|[ʃk]}}), and ''çk'' (where ''‘x’'' and ''‘ç’'' are arbitrary symbols, not attempts to guess the phonetic value of the proto-phonemes).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1925}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Step 4, reconstruct proto-phonemes====
Typology assists in deciding what reconstruction best fits the data. For example, the voicing of voiceless plosives between vowels is common, but not the devoicing of voiced plosives there. If a correspondence ''-t-'' : ''-d-'' between vowels is found in two languages, the proto-[[phoneme]] is more likely to be ''*-t-'', with a development to the voiced form in the second language. The opposite reconstruction would create a rare type.

However, unusual sound changes do occur. The [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word for ''two'', for example, is reconstructed as ''*dwō'', which is reflected in [[Classical Armenian]] as ''erku''. Several other cognates demonstrate a regular change ''*dw-'' → ''erk-'' in Armenian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p=28}}; citing {{harvnb|Szemerényi| 1960|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Bearlake, a dialect of the [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan language]] of [[Slavey language|Slavey]], there has been a sound change of Proto-Athabaskan ''*ts'' → Bearlake ''{{IPA|kʷ}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|1997|p=113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is very unlikely that ''*dw-'' changed directly into ''erk-'' and ''*ts'' into ''{{IPA|kʷ}}'', but instead they must have gone through several intermediate steps to arrive at the later forms. It is not phonetic similarity which matters when utilizing the comparative method, but regular sound correspondences.&lt;ref name=&quot;ltwo&quot;/&gt;

By the [[Principle of Economy]], the reconstruction of a proto-phoneme should require as few sound changes as possible to arrive at the modern reflexes in the daughter languages. For example, [[Algonquian languages]] exhibit the following correspondence set:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.native-languages.org/famalg_words.htm|title=Vocabulary Words in the Algonquian Language Family|date=1998-2009|publisher=Native Languages of the Americas|first=Laura|last=Redish|first2=Orrin|last2=Lewis|accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goddard|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

! &amp;nbsp;[[Mi'kmaq language|Míkmaq]]&amp;nbsp;
! &amp;nbsp;[[Cree language|Cree]]&amp;nbsp;
! &amp;nbsp;[[Munsee language|Munsee]]&amp;nbsp;

| align=center | &amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;
| align=center | &amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;
| align=center | &amp;nbsp;b&amp;nbsp;
|}

The simplest reconstruction for this set would be either ''*m'' or ''*b''. Both ''*m'' → ''b'' and ''*b'' → ''m'' are likely. Because ''m'' occurs in five of the languages, and ''b'' in only one, if ''*b'' is reconstructed, then it is necessary to assume five separate changes of ''*b'' → ''m'', whereas if ''*m'' is reconstructed, it is only necessary to assume a single change of ''*m'' → ''b''. ''*m'' would be most economical.

====Step 5, examine the reconstructed system typologically====
In the final step, the linguist checks to see how the proto-[[phoneme]]s fit the known [[linguistic typology|typological constraints]]. For example, in a hypothetical system,
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! &amp;nbsp; p &amp;nbsp;
! &amp;nbsp; t &amp;nbsp;
! &amp;nbsp; k &amp;nbsp;
|-
! &amp;nbsp; b &amp;nbsp;
!
!
|-
!
! &amp;nbsp; n &amp;nbsp;
! &amp;nbsp; ŋ &amp;nbsp;
|-
!
! &amp;nbsp; l &amp;nbsp;
!
|}

there is only one [[Voiced bilabial plosive|voiced plosive]], ''*b'', and although there is an [[alveolar nasal|alveolar]] and a [[velar nasal]], ''*n'' and ''*ŋ'', there is no corresponding [[Bilabial nasal|labial nasal]]. However, languages generally (though not always) tend to maintain symmetry in their phonemic inventories. In this case, the linguist might attempt to find evidence that what was earlier reconstructed as ''*b'' is in fact ''*m'', or that the ''*n'' and ''*ŋ'' are in fact ''*d'' and ''*g''.

Even a symmetrical system can be typologically suspicious. For example, the traditional [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] plosive inventory is:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

An earlier voiceless aspirated row was removed on grounds of insufficient evidence. Since the mid-20th century, a number of linguists have argued that this phonology is implausible;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p=143}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that it is extremely unlikely for a language to have a voiced aspirated ([[breathy voice]]) series without a corresponding voiceless aspirated series. A potential solution was provided by [[Thomas Gamkrelidze]] and [[Vyacheslav V. Ivanov]], who argued that the series traditionally reconstructed as plain voiced should in fact be reconstructed as [[Glottalization|glottalized]] — either [[Implosive consonant|implosive]] {{IPA|(ɓ, ɗ, ɠ)}} or [[Ejective consonant|ejective]] {{IPA|(pʼ, tʼ, kʼ)}}. The plain voiceless and voiced aspirated series would thus be replaced by just voiceless and voiced, with aspiration being a non-distinctive quality of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|pp=109–113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This example of the application of linguistic typology to linguistic reconstruction has become known as the [[Glottalic theory|Glottalic Theory]]. It has a large number of proponents but is not generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi| 1996|pp=151–152}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative, the voiceless aspirated row was restored.

The reconstruction of proto-sounds logically precedes the reconstruction of grammatical [[morpheme]]s (word-forming affixes and inflectional endings), patterns of [[declension]] and [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]], and so on. The full reconstruction of an unrecorded protolanguage is an open-ended task.

==Limitations==
===Problems with the history of historical linguistics===
The limitations of the comparative method were recognized by the very linguists who developed it,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|pp=4–5, 7–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is still seen as a valuable tool. In the case of Indo-European, the method seemed to at least partially validate the centuries-old search for an [[Ursprache]], the original language of the [[Garden of Eden]], from which all others not assigned by [[God]] in the confusion resulting from construction of the [[Tower of Babel]] descended. These others were presumed ordered in a [[family tree]], becoming the [[Tree model]] of the [[neogrammarians]].

The archaeologists followed suit, attempting to find archaeological evidence of a culture or cultures that could be presumed to have spoken a [[proto-language]], such as [[Vere Gordon Childe]]'s ''The Aryans: a study of Indo-European origins'', 1926. Childe was a philologist turned archaeologist. These views culminated in the ''Siedlungsarchaologie'', or &quot;settlement-archaeology&quot;, of [[Gustaf Kossinna]], becoming known as &quot;Kossinna's Law.&quot; He asserted that cultures represent ethnic groups, including their languages. It was rejected as a law in the post-World-War-II era. The fall of Kossinna's Law removed the temporal and spatial framework previously applied to many proto-languages. Fox concludes:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|1995|pp=141–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Comparative Method ''as such'' is not, in fact, historical; it provides evidence of linguistic relationships to which we may give a historical interpretation. ...[Our increased knowledge about the historical processes involved] has probably made historical linguists less prone to equate the idealizations required by the method with historical reality. ...Provided we keep [the interpretation of the results and the method itself] apart, the Comparative Method can continue to be used in the reconstruction of earlier stages of languages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proto-languages can be verified in many historical instances, such as Latin. Although no longer a law, settlement-archaeology is known to be essentially valid for some cultures that straddle history and prehistory, such as the Celtic Iron Age (mainly Celtic) and [[Mycenaean civilization]] (mainly Greek). None of these models can be or have been completely rejected, and yet none alone are sufficient.

===Problems with the neogrammarian hypothesis===
The foundation of the comparative method, and of comparative linguistics in general, is the [[Neogrammarian]]s' fundamental assumption that &quot;sound laws have no exceptions.&quot; When it was initially proposed, critics of the Neogrammarians proposed an alternate position, summarized by the maxim &quot;each word has its own history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several types of change do in fact alter words in non-regular ways. Unless identified, they may hide or distort laws and cause false perceptions of relationship.

====Borrowing====
All languages [[loanword|borrow words]] from other languages in various contexts. They are likely to have followed the laws of the languages from which they were borrowed rather than the laws of the borrowing language.

====Areal diffusion====
Borrowing on a larger scale occurs in [[Areal feature (linguistics)|areal diffusion]], when features are adopted by contiguous languages over a geographical area. The borrowing may be [[Phonology|phonological]], [[Morpheme|morphological]] or [[Lexeme|lexical]]. A false proto-language over the area may be reconstructed for them or may be taken to be a third language serving as a source of diffused features.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aikhenvald|2001|pp=2–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several areal features and other influences may converge to form a [[sprachbund]], a wider region sharing features that appear to be related but are diffusional. For instance, the [[East Asian languages|East Asian Sprachbund]] suggested several false classifications of such languages as [[Chinese languages|Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] before it was recognized.

====Random mutations====
Sporadic changes, such as irregular inflections, compounding, and abbreviation, do not follow any laws. For example, the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words ''palabra'' ('word'), ''peligro'' ('danger') and ''milagro'' ('miracle') should have been ''parabla'', ''periglo'', ''miraglo'' by regular sound changes from the Latin ''parabŏla'', ''perĩcǔlum'' and ''mĩrãcǔlum'', but the ''r'' and ''l'' changed places by sporadic [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Analogy====
[[Analogy#Linguistics|Analogy]] is the sporadic change of a feature to be like another feature in the same or a different language. It may affect a single word or be generalized to an entire class of features, such as a verb paradigm. For example, the [[Russian language|Russian]] word for ''nine'', by regular sound changes from [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]], should have been {{IPA|/nʲevʲatʲ/}}, but is in fact {{IPA|/dʲevʲatʲ/}}. It is believed that the initial ''{{IPA|nʲ-}}'' changed to ''{{IPA|dʲ-}}'' under influence of the word for &quot;ten&quot; in Russian, {{IPA|/dʲesʲatʲ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p=79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gradual application====
Students of contemporary language changes, such as [[William Labov]], note that even a systematic sound change is at first applied in an unsystematic fashion, with the percentage of its occurrence in a person's speech dependent on various social factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p=55}}; {{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sound change gradually spreads, a process known as [[lexical diffusion]]. While not invalidating the Neogrammarians' axiom that &quot;sound laws have no exceptions&quot;, their gradual application shows that they do not always apply to all lexical items at the same time. Hock notes,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hock|1991|pp=446–447}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;While it probably is true in the long run every word has its own history, it is not justified to conclude as some linguists have, that therefore the Neogrammarian position on the nature of linguistic change is falsified.&quot;

===Problems with the Tree Model===
The comparative method is used to construct a [[Tree model]] (German ''Stammbaum'') of language evolution,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|pp=7–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which daughter languages are seen as branching from the [[proto-language]], gradually growing more distant from it through accumulated [[phonology|phonological]], [[morpho-syntactic]], and [[lexicon|lexical]] changes.
[[File:Uto-Aztecan Family Tree.jpg|thumb|720px|center|An example of the Tree Model, used to represent the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] language family spoken throughout the southern and western [[United States]] and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;The diagram is based on the hierarchical list in {{harvnb|Mithun|1999|pp=539–540}} and on the map in {{harvnb|Campbell| 1997|p=358}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Families are in '''bold''', individual languages in ''italics''. Not all branches and languages are shown.]]

====The presumption of a well-defined node====
[[File:Wave Model Schmidt.jpeg|thumb|300px|The [[Wave model (linguistics)|Wave Model]] has been proposed as an alternative model of language change.&lt;ref&gt;This diagram is based partly on the one found in Fox 1995:128, and Johannes Schmidt, 1872. ''Die Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse der indogermanischen Sprachen''. Weimar: H. Böhlau&lt;/ref&gt; Each wave, an [[isogloss]], is a circle in the [[Venn diagram]], but the circles are not to be seen as simultaneous or extending over the same areas. The language must be found most certainly at the intersection of the greatest number of circles. It tapers off to intermediate times and locations. Some isoglosses may not even be found in languages of the same family. The tree model presumes that all the circles coincide in time and space.]]
The [[tree model]] features nodes that are presumed to be distinct proto-languages existing independently in distinct regions during distinct historical times. The reconstruction of unattested proto-languages lends itself to that illusion: they cannot be verified and the linguist is free to select whatever definite times and places for them seem best. Right from the outset of Indo-European studies, however, [[Thomas Young]] said:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Miscellaneous works of the late Thomas Young|first=Thomas |last=Young|contribution=Languages, From the Supplement to the Encyclopedia Britannica, vol. V, 1824|volume=Volume III, Hieroglyphical Essays and Correspondence, &amp;c.|editor-first=John|editor-last=Leitch|location=London|publisher=John Murray|year=1855|page=480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not, however, very easy to say what the definition should be that should constitute a separate language, but it seems most natural to call those languages distinct, of which the one cannot be understood by common persons in the habit of speaking the other ....Still, however, it may remain doubtfull whether the Danes and the Swedes could not, in general, understand each other tolerably well ... nor is it possible to say if the twenty ways of pronouncing the sounds, belonging to the Chinese characters, ought or ought not to be considered as so many languages or dialects .... But, ... the languages so nearly allied must stand next to each other in a systematic order ....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The assumption of uniformity in a proto-language, implicit in the comparative method, is problematic. Even in small language communities there are always [[Dialect|dialect differences]], whether based on area, gender, class, or other factors. The [[Pirahã language]] of [[Brazil]] is spoken by only several hundred people, but it has at least two different dialects, one spoken by men and one by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aikhenvald|1999|p=354}}; {{harvnb|Ladefoged|2003|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell points out:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|pp=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not so much that the comparative method 'assumes' no variation; rather, it is just that there is nothing built into the comparative method which would allow it to address variation directly....This assumption of uniformity is a reasonable idealization; it does no more damage to the understanding of the language than, say, modern reference grammars do which concentrate on a language's general structure, typically leaving out consideration of regional or social variation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Different dialects, as they evolve into separate languages, remain in contact with one another and influence each other. Even after they are considered distinct, languages near to one another continue to influence each other, often sharing grammatical, phonological, and lexical innovations. A change in one language of a family may spread to neighboring languages; and multiple waves of change are communicated like waves across language and dialect boundaries, each with its own randomly delimited range.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|1995|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a language is divided into an inventory of features, each with its own time and range ([[isogloss]]es), they do not all coincide. History and prehistory may not offer a time and place for a distinct coincidence, as may be the case for [[Italic languages|proto-Italic]], in which case the proto-language is only a concept. However, Hock&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hock|1991|p=454}}.&lt;/ref&gt; observes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The discovery in the late nineteenth century that [[isogloss]]es can cut across well-established linguistic boundaries at first created considerable attention and controversy. And it became fashionable to oppose a wave theory to a tree theory... Today, however, it is quite evident that the phenomena referred to by these two terms are complementary aspects of linguistic change...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Subjectivity of the reconstruction====
The reconstruction of unknown proto-languages is inherently subjective.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In the [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]] example above, the choice of ''*m'' as the parent [[phoneme]] is only ''likely'', not ''certain''. It is conceivable that a Proto-Algonquian language with ''*b'' in those positions split into two branches, one which preserved ''*b'' and one which changed it to ''*m'' instead; and while the first branch only developed into [[Arapaho language|Arapaho]], the second spread out wider and developed into all the other [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes. It is also possible that the nearest common ancestor of the [[Algonquian languages]] used some other sound instead, such as ''*p'', which eventually mutated to ''*b'' in one branch and to ''*m'' in the other. Since reconstruction involves many of these choices, some linguists prefer to view the reconstructed features as abstract representations of sound correspondences, rather than as objects with a historical time and place.

The existence of proto-languages and the validity of the comparative method is verifiable in cases where the reconstruction can be matched to a known language, which may only be known as a shadow in the [[loanword]]s of another language. For example [[Finnic languages]] such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]] have borrowed many words from an early stage of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], and the shape of the loans matches the forms that have been reconstructed for [[Proto-Germanic]]. Finnish ''kuningas'' 'king' and ''kaunis'' 'beautiful' match the Germanic reconstructions *''kuningaz'' and *''skauniz'' (&gt;German ''König'' 'king', ''schön'' 'beautiful').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kylstra|1996|p=62}} for KAUNIS, p. 122 for KUNINGAS.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Additional models====
As alternatives to the [[tree model]], the [[Wave model (linguistics)|wave model]] dates to the 19th century, [[glottochronology]] and [[mass lexical comparison]] to the 20th. Most historical linguists consider the latter two methods flawed and unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|p=201}}; {{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Council of Constance''' is the 15th [[ecumenical council]] recognized by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], held from 1414 to 1418. The council ended the [[Western Schism|Three-Popes Controversy]], by deposing or accepting the resignation of the remaining Papal claimants and electing [[Pope Martin V]].

The Council also condemned and executed [[Jan Hus]] and  ruled on issues of national sovereignty, the rights of pagans, and just war in response to a conflict between the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Teutonic Knights|Order of the Teutonic Knights]]. The Council is important for its relationship to ecclesial [[Counciliarism]] and [[Papal supremacy]].

==Origin and background==
[[Image:Meister der Chronik des Konzils von Konstanz 001.jpg|thumb|left|Emperor Sigismund and his second wife [[Barbara of Celje]] at the council of Constance]]
The council was called by the German [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|King Sigismund]] (later Holy Roman Emperor), a supporter of [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}, the pope recently elected at Pisa (and later declared an [[Antipope]]). The council was held from 16 November 1414 to 22 April 1418, in [[Konstanz|Constance (currently known as Konstanz)]].  Its main purpose was to end the Papal schism which had resulted from the confusion following both the [[Avignon Papacy]] and the [[Council of Pisa]] (which had sought to resolve the situation). The Council of Constance marked the high point of the Conciliar movement to reform the Church. According to [[Joseph McCabe]], the council was attended by roughly 29 [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s, 100 &quot;learned doctors of law and divinity,&quot; 134 [[abbot]]s, and 183 [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]]s and [[archbishop]]s.

At the time the council was called, there were three claimants to the [[Papacy]] ([[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]], [[Pope Gregory XII|Gregory XII]] and [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]]).  A few years earlier, in one of the first blows to the Conciliar movement, the bishops at the Council of Pisa had deposed the two claimant popes and elected a third pope, claiming that in such a situation, a council of bishops had greater authority than just one bishop, even if he were the bishop of Rome.

An innovation at the Council was that instead of voting as individuals, the bishops voted in national blocs, explicitly confirming the national pressures that had fueled the schism since 1378.

==Decrees and doctrinal status==
[[Image:Richental Konzilssitzung Muenster.jpg|thumb|right|Bishops debating with the pope at the Council of Constance]]
The famous decree ''Haec Sancta Synodus,'' which gave primacy to the authority of the Council and thus became a source for ecclesial conciliarism, was promulgated in the fifth session, 6 April 1415. 

{{quote|Legitimately assembled in the holy Spirit, constituting a general council and representing the Catholic church militant, it has power immediately from Christ; and that everyone of whatever state or dignity, even papal, is bound to obey it in those matters which pertain to the faith, the eradication of the said schism and the general reform of the said church of God in head and members.}}

marks the high water mark of the Conciliar movement of reform.&lt;ref name = &quot;Piar&quot;&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.piar.hu/councils/ecum16.htm | title = Councils | place = Hungary | publisher = Piar}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This decree, however, is not considered valid by the Magisterium of the Catholic Church, since it was never approved by Pope Gregory XII or his successors, and was passed by the Council in a session before his confirmation.  The Church declared the first sessions of the Council of Constance an invalid and illicit assembly of Bishops, gathered under the authority of Emperor Sigismund and Antipope John XXIII.

The acts of the Council were not made public until 1442, at the behest of the [[Council of Basel]]; they were printed in 1500. The creation of a book on how to die was ordered by the council, and thus written in 1415 called ''[[Ars moriendi]]''.

==Ending the Western Schism==
[[Image:Imperia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Imperia (statue)|''Imperia'']], a statue commemorating the Council]]

With the support of [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]], enthroned before the high altar of the cathedral of Constance, the Council of Constance recommended that all three popes abdicate, and that another be chosen. In part because of the constant presence of the emperor, other rulers demanded that they have a say in who would be pope.

Gregory XII then sent representatives to Constance, whom he granted full powers to summon, open and preside over an Ecumenical Council; he also empowered them to present his resignation to the Papacy. This would pave the way for the end of the Western Schism.

The legates were received by Emperor Sigismund and by the assembled Bishops, and the Emperor yielded the presidency of the proceedings to the papal legates, Cardinal Dominici of Ragusa and Prince Charles of Malatesta. On 4 July 1415 the Bull of Gregory XII which appointed Malatesta and Cardinal Dominici of Ragusa as his proxies at the council was formally read before the assembled Bishops. The cardinal then read a decree of Gregory XII which convoked the council and authorized its succeeding acts. Thereupon, the Bishops voted to accept the summons. Prince Malatesta immediately informed the Council that he was empowered by a commission from Pope Gregory XII to resign the Papal Throne on the Pontiff's behalf. He asked the Council whether they would prefer to receive the abdication at that point or at a later date. The Bishops voted to receive the Papal abdication immediately. Thereupon the commission by Gregory XII authorizing his proxy to resign the Papacy on his behalf was read and Malatesta, acting in the name of Gregory XII, pronounced the resignation of the papacy by Gregory XII and handed a written copy of the resignation to the assembly.

Former Pope Gregory XII was then created titular [[Cardinal Bishop of Porto and Santa Ruffina]] by the Council, with rank immediately below the Pope (which made him the highest ranking person in the Church, since, due to his abdication, the See of Peter was vacant). Gregory XII's cardinals were accepted as true cardinals by the Council, but the members of the council delayed electing a new pope for fear that a new pope would restrict further discussion of pressing issues in the Church.

By the time the anti-popes were all deposed and the new Pope, [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]], was elected, two years had passed since Gregory XII's abdication, and Gregory was already dead.  The council took great care to protect the legitimacy of the succession, ratified all his acts and a new pontiff was chosen. The new pope, [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]], elected November 1417, soon asserted the absolute authority of the papal office.

==Condemnation of Jan Hus==
[[Image:Brožík, Václav - Hus před koncilem 6. července 1415.jpg|thumb|right|Painting of [[Jan Hus]] in Council of Constance by [[Václav Brožík]]]]
A second goal of the council was to continue the reforms begun at the Council of Pisa.  These reforms were largely directed against [[John Wycliff]], mentioned in the opening session, and condemned in the eighth, 4 May 1415 and [[Jan Hus]], and their followers. [[Jan Hus]], summoned to Constance under a letter of indemnity, was condemned by council and [[burned at the stake]] notwithstanding on 6 July 1415.

==Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic conflict==
In 1411, the [[Peace of Thorn (1411)|First Peace of Thorn]] ended the [[Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War]], in which the [[Teutonic Knights]] fought the [[Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Kingdom of Poland]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. However, the peace was not stable and further conflicts arose regarding demarcation of the [[Samogitia]]n borders. The tensions erupted into the brief [[Hunger War]] in summer 1414. It was concluded that the disputes would be mediated by the Council of Constance. The propaganda war soon grew from a border quarrel to a fundamental dispute of the Teutonic mission – did the Knights have the right to wage the crusade? was it a [[Just War]]?&lt;ref name=chris/&gt;

The Polish position was defended by [[Paulus Vladimiri]], rector of the [[Jagiellonian University]], who challenged legality of the Teutonic crusade. He argued that a forced conversion was incompatible with free will, which was an essential component of a genuine conversion.&lt;ref name=chris/&gt; Therefore the Knights could only wage a defensive war if pagans violated [[natural rights]] of the Christians. Vladimiri further stipulated that infidels had right which had to be respected and neither the Pope or the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] had the authority to violate them. Poles and Lithuanians also brought a group of Samogitian representatives to testify of atrocities committed by the Knights.&lt;ref name=chris/&gt; However, Vladimiri's ideas proved too radical and were rejected by Catholic theologians.

[[John of Falkenberg]] proved to be the fiercest opponent of the Poles. In his ''Liber de doctrina'', Falkenberg argued that &quot;the Emperor has the right to slay even peaceful infidels simply because they are pagans (...). The Poles deserve death for defending infidels, and should be exterminated even more than the infidels; they should be deprived of their sovereignty and reduced to slavery.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassar&quot;/&gt; In ''Satira'', he attacked Polish King [[Jogaila]], calling him a &quot;mad dog&quot; unworthy to be king. Falkenberg was condemned and imprisoned for such libel, but was not officially accused of heresy.&lt;ref name=chris/&gt; Other opponents included [[Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights|Grand Master's]] proctor Peter Wormditt, Dominic of San Gimignano, John Urbach,  Ardecino de Porta of Novara, and [[Bishop of Ciudad Rodrigo]] Andrew Escobar. They argued that the Knights were perfectly justified in their crusade as it was a sacred duty of Christians to spread the true faith.&lt;ref name=chris/&gt; Cardinal [[Pierre d'Ailly]] published an independent opinion that attempted to somewhat balance both Polish and Teutonic positions.&lt;ref name=chris/&gt;

The Council did not make any political decisions. It established  [[Diocese of Samogitia]], with seat in [[Varniai|Medininkai]] and subordinated to Lithuanian dioceses, and appointed [[Matthias of Trakai]] as the first bishop. Pope Martin V appointed Polish King [[Jogaila]] and Lithuanian Grand Duke [[Vytautas]] as [[vicar general]]s in [[Pskov]] and [[Veliky Novgorod]] in recognition of their Catholicism.&lt;ref name=chris/&gt; After another round of futile negotiations, [[Gollub War]] broke out in 1422. It ended with the [[Treaty of Melno]] that resolved the territorial disputes for good.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Denominations of the United States}}
'''Churches Uniting in Christ''' (CUIC) brings together ten [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline]] [[United States|American]] [[religious denomination|denominations]] (including both predominantly [[whites|white]] and predominantly [[African American|black]] churches), and was inaugurated on January 20, 2002.

CUIC is the successor organization to the '''[[Consultation on Church Union]]''' (COCU) founded in 1962. The original task of COCU was to negotiate a [[merger]] between its ten member denominations; however, the membership of the denominations overwhelmingly rejected a merger when it was proposed in 1969. With the failure of the merger proposal, COCU then turned to negotiating &quot;[[full communion]]&quot;, whereby each member church would retain its own autonomy and identity, while recognizing the validity of the rites and [[religious minister|ministry]] of the others and accepting them as true churches. In 1991 it was proposed that this was to be done on the historic model of [[bishop]], [[presbyter]] and [[deacon]]. However, the [[Presbyterian Church USA]] was unwilling to implement some of the changes to its internal rules that this model would require, and the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] did not feel able to participate at the time. It was then proposed that [[intercommunion]] be established without a resolution of the ministry issue, which would be resolved by 2007 by means of intensive dialog between the churches. This modified proposal was then accepted by the member churches.

CUIC is not a merger, but rather an intercommunion agreement whereby each member recognizes the others as part of the true church, and recognizes its rites ([[baptism]], [[Eucharist|communion]]) as valid. The original proposal for CUIC also had a full recognition of each other's ministers, but the Episcopal Church's insistence on the [[historic episcopate]], which conflicts with the system of organization and governance in some other member churches (especially in the [[Presbyterian Church USA]] and the [[United Church of Christ]]), has meant that this part of the CUIC proposal has been put on hold. CUIC will however hold negotiations once it is established, possibly leading to a full recognition of each other's ministers within the next few years.

The [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] and [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]] have withdrawn from CUIC. They feel the other churches were not doing enough to counter the history of racial injustice between black and white churches. In response to this, the remaining churches in CUIC have decided to suspend its work while they seek reconciliation with those two churches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cuicinfo.org/pdf/cuic_april_09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cuicinfo.org/Letter%20CUIC%20President.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Unitarian Council''' (CUC) is the national body for [[Unitarian Universalist]]s in [[Canada]].

The CUC is a member of the [[International Council of Unitarians and Universalists]].

== Principles and sources ==
''&quot;The Principles and Sources of Our Religious Faith&quot;'' from the Canadian Unitarian Council &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuc.ca/who_we_are/principles/principles_sources.htm Principles and Sources&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principles ===
We, the member [[wikt:congregation|congregations]] of the Canadian Unitarian Council, covenant to affirm and promote:
* the inherent worth and dignity of every person;
* justice, equity, and compassion in human relations;
* acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations;
* a free and responsible search for truth and meaning;
* the right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in society at large;
* the goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all;
* respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.

=== Sources ===
The living tradition which we share draws from many sources:
* direct experience of that transcending mystery and wonder, affirmed in all cultures, which moves us to a renewal of the spirit and an openness to the forces which create and uphold life;
* words and deeds of prophetic women and men which challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil with justice, compassion, and the transforming power of love;
* wisdom from the world's religions which inspires us in our [[ethical]] and spiritual life;
* Jewish and Christian teachings which call us to respond to God's love by loving our neighbours as ourselves;
* Humanist teachings which counsel us to heed the guidance of reason and the results of [[science]], and warn us against idolatries of the mind and spirit;
* spiritual teachings of Earth-centred traditions which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature.

Grateful for the religious pluralism which enriches and ennobles our faith, we are inspired to deepen our understanding and expand our vision. As free congregations we enter into this covenant, promising to one another our mutual trust and support.

The current [http://www.cuc.ca/who_we_are/principles/principles_sources.htm Principles and Sources] are based on the UUA's [http://www.uua.org/aboutuua/principles.html Principles and Purposes]. The CUC has created a [http://cuc.ca/sptf/ task force] to consider revising them.

== Organization ==
[[Image:CUC Regions Map.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A map of all four CUC regions]]

The CUC is divided into four regions: &quot;BC&quot; ([[British Columbia]]), &quot;Western&quot; ([[Alberta]] to [[Thunder Bay]]), &quot;Central&quot; (between Thunder Bay and [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]), and &quot;Eastern&quot; (Kingston, [[Ottawa]] and everything east of that).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuc.ca/programs/regions.htm Regions of the CUC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, for [[Young Religious Unitarian Universalists]] (YRUU) programming in Canada, the &quot;Central&quot; and &quot;Eastern&quot; regions are combined to form a youth region known as &quot;QuOM&quot; (Quebec, Ontario and the Maritimes), giving the youth only three regions for their activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuc.ca/youth/regions.htm Regions and Congregations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Member congregations are served by volunteer Service Consultants, Congregational Networkers, and a series of other committees. There are two directors of regional services, one for the Western two regions, and one for the Eastern two regions. The Director of Lifespan Learning oversees development of [[religious education]] programming.

== Founding ==
This section quoted from [http://www.cuc.ca/who_we_are/colony_to_nation.htm THE CUC: FROM COLONY TO NATION 1961-2002] by Rev. Dr. Charles W. Eddis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The formation of the CUC was a long-held dream. Proposals to form a Canadian organization were made by G.C. Holland, minister of the Ottawa church, in 1898, Samuel A. Eliot, President of the American Unitarian Association in 1908, Charles Huntingdon Pennoyer, minister of the Halifax Universalist Church in 1909, and Horace Westwood, a Unitarian minister in Winnipeg in 1913. In 1946 The Commission on the Work of the Churches of the British Unitarians recommended that “the Assembly should interest itself in the formation of a Canadian Unitarian Association which many Unitarians there believe to be necessary.”

The first native seeds were planted with the publication of The Canadian Unitarian in Ottawa from 1940 to 1946, a small newsletter distributed with the newsletters of Canadian churches. After the Second World War, the growth of the Unitarians in Canada began to show the strength which would make some Canadian organization feasible, if not imperative. Unitarians, most notably Toronto ministers, generated considerable media attention from the centre of Canada’s English language media. The Unitarian Service Committee of Canada, founded in 1945, was receiving considerable attention both in city newspapers and on television, so much so that the word “Unitarian” became a household world, though its meaning was not that widely known. In 1946 there were six Icelandic Unitarian churches with 272 members, and five English-speaking churches with 1,049 members. The Universalists had five churches with 459 members. In 1961 there were three Universalist churches with 68 members, and three Icelandic and eleven English-speaking Unitarian churches with 3,476 members, and in addition 22 Unitarian fellowships with 773 members. The Universalists almost disappeared in Canada, outside of a small rural church in southwest Ontario, and were probably saved in the other two surviving locations by influx of Canadian Unitarians. By contrast, Unitarian membership more than tripled in the same fifteen years. In 1953 there were six Unitarian ministers serving congregations in Canada. Ten years later there were five ministers in the Toronto area alone.

In early April, 1961, a meeting with delegates from ten congregations was held in Montreal. The plan was approved 8 to 1, with the understanding that “The Council will function within the framework of the continental Unitarian Universalist Association.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Relationship to the Unitarian Universalist Association ==
Up until July 2002, almost all member congregations of the CUC were also members of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] (UUA). In the past, most services to CUC member congregations were provided by the UUA. However, with an agreement in 2001 between the UUA and CUC, from July 2002 onwards most services have been provided by the CUC to its own member congregations.

The Canadian Unitarian Universalist youth of the day disapproved of this change in relationship.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} It is quite evident in the words of this statement, which was adopted by the attendees of the 2001 youth conference held at the Unitarian Church of Montreal: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;We the youth of Canada are deeply concerned about the direction the CUC seems to be taking. As stewards of our faith, adults have a responsibility to take into consideration the concerns of youth. We are opposed to making this massive jump in our evolutionary progress.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cuc.ca/canu/canu_july2001.pdf Debating the autonomy resolution&amp;nbsp;— Youth are worried&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The UUA continues to provide services relating to ministerial settlement as well as a very small amount of the youth (14–20) and young adult (18–35) programming and services.

== Unitarians and Universalists ==
While the name of the organization is the Canadian Unitarian Council, the CUC includes congregations with Unitarian, Universalist, Unitarian Universalist and Universalist Unitarian in their names. Changing the name of the CUC has occasionally been debated, but there have been no successful motions. To recognize the diversity, the abbreviation is often written as U*U (and playfully read as &quot;You star, you&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuc.ca/whos_who/ed/ed_letter_nov_2003.htm Unitarian*Universalist-You Star, You!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Note, not all CUC members like this playful reading and so when these people write the abbreviation they leave out the star(*), just writing UU instead.&lt;ref&gt;http://cuc.ca/canu/canu_spring2004_final.pdf Letters to the Editor&amp;nbsp;— NO ASTERISKS PLEASE&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Mingus Jr.''' (April 22, 1922 &amp;ndash; January 5, 1979) was an [[United States|American]] [[jazz]] [[musician]], [[composer]], bandleader, and civil rights activist.

Mingus's compositions retained the hot and soulful feel of [[hard bop]] and drew heavily from black [[gospel music]] while sometimes drawing on elements of [[Third stream]], [[free jazz]], and [[classical music]]. Yet Mingus avoided categorization, forging his own brand of music that fused tradition with unique and unexplored realms of jazz.

Mingus focused on collective improvisation, similar to the old New Orleans Jazz parades, paying particular attention to how each band member interacted with the group as a whole. In creating his bands, Mingus looked not only at the skills of the available musicians, but also their personalities. Many musicians passed through his bands and later went on to impressive careers. He recruited talented and sometimes little-known artists whom he assembled into unconventional and revealing configurations. As a performer, he was a pioneer in double bass technique. 

Nearly as well known as his ambitious music was Mingus' often fearsome temperament, which earned him the nickname &quot;The Angry Man of Jazz.&quot; His refusal to compromise his musical integrity led to many on-stage eruptions, exhortations to musicians, and dismissals.&lt;ref&gt;NYT review of 1965 UCLA concert http://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/23/arts/an-irrepressible-65-mingus-concert.html?&amp;pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his brilliant writing for mid-size ensembles—and his catering to and emphasizing the strengths of the musicians in his groups—Mingus is often considered the heir apparent to [[Duke Ellington]], for whom he expressed great admiration. Indeed, [[Dizzy Gillespie]] had once claimed Mingus reminded him &quot;of a young Duke&quot;, citing their shared &quot;organizational genius.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzinchicago.org/educates/journal/reviews/myself-when-i-am-real-life-and-music-charles-mingus|title=Myself When I Am Real: The Life and Music of Charles Mingus, by Gene Santoro|author=David Simpson|work=Jazz Institute of Chicago book review|accessdate=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Mingus' music was once believed to be too difficult to play without Mingus' leadership, many musicians play Mingus compositions today, from those who play with the repertory bands [[Mingus Big Band]], [[Mingus Dynasty (band)|Mingus Dynasty]], and Mingus Orchestra, to the high school students who play the charts and compete in the Charles Mingus High School Competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Thirty Years On, The Music Remains Strong; Charles Mingus’ legacy revisited at the Manhattan School of Music | author=Ernest Barteldes | url=http://www.nypress.com/article-19427-thirty-years-on-the-music-remains-strong.html | publisher=nypress.com | date=2009-02-18 | accessdate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]&lt;ref name=&quot;arts.endow.gov&quot;&gt;NEA press release http://arts.endow.gov/about/40th/mingus.html&lt;/ref&gt; made possible the cataloging of Mingus compositions, which were then donated to the Music Division of the New York Public Library&lt;ref&gt;NYPL catalog page http://catalog.nypl.org/record=b11250454&lt;/ref&gt; for public use. In 1993, The Library of Congress acquired Mingus's collected papers—including scores, sound recordings, correspondence and photos—in what they described as &quot;the most important acquisition of a manuscript collection relating to jazz in the Library's history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress press release http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/1993/93-081.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Charles Mingus was born in [[Nogales, Arizona]]. He was raised largely in the [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]] area of Los Angeles, California. His mother's paternal heritage was Chinese and English, while historical records indicate that his father was the illegitimate offspring of a black farmhand and his Swedish employer's white granddaughter.&lt;ref&gt;''Myself When I am Real: The Life and Music of Charles Mingus,'' Gene Santoro (Oxford University Press, 1994) ISBN 0-19-509733-5&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother allowed only church-related music in their home, but Mingus developed an early love for jazz, especially the music of [[Duke Ellington]]. He studied trombone and later cello. Much of the cello technique he learned was applicable to [[double bass]] when he took up the instrument in high school. He studied five years with H. Rheinshagen, principal bassist of the [[New York Philharmonic]], and compositional techniques with [[Lloyd Reese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=7105 |title=Charles Mingus &amp;#124; Charles &quot;Baron&quot; Mingus: West Coast, 1945-49 |publisher=Allaboutjazz.com |date=2001-02-01 |accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in his teen years, Mingus was writing quite advanced pieces; many are similar to [[Third Stream]] because they incorporate elements of [[classical music]]. A number of them were recorded in 1960 with conductor [[Gunther Schuller]], and released as ''Pre-Bird'', referring to [[Charlie Parker|Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker]]; Mingus was one of many musicians whose perspectives on music were altered by Parker into &quot;pre- and post-Bird&quot; eras. 

Mingus gained a reputation as a bass prodigy. His first major professional job was playing with former Ellington clarinetist [[Barney Bigard]]. He toured with [[Louis Armstrong]] in 1943, and by early 1945 was recording in Los Angeles in a band led by [[Illinois Jacquet|Russell Jacquet]] and which also included [[Teddy Edwards]], [[Maurice Simon]], [[Wild Bill Davis|Bill Davis]] and [[Chico Hamilton]], and in May that year, in Hollywood, again with Teddy Edwards, in a band led by [[Howard McGhee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jazz Discography Project |url=http://www.jazzdisco.org/charles-mingus/catalog/ |title=Charles Mingus Catalog at JazzDisc.org |publisher=Jazzdisco.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then played with [[Lionel Hampton]]'s band in the late 1940s; Hampton performed and recorded several of Mingus's pieces. A popular trio of Mingus, [[Red Norvo]] and [[Tal Farlow]] in 1950 and 1951 received considerable acclaim, but Mingus' mixed origin caused problems with club owners and he left the group. Mingus was briefly a member of Ellington's band in 1953, as a substitute for bassist [[Wendell Marshall]]. Mingus's notorious temper led to him being one of the few musicians personally fired by Ellington ([[Bubber Miley]] and drummer [[Bobby Durham (jazz musician)|Bobby Durham]] are among the others), after an on-stage fight between Mingus and [[Juan Tizol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hentoff, Nat | title= Jazz Is | publisher=W H Allen | year=1978|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the early 1950s, before attaining commercial recognition as a bandleader, Mingus played gigs with [[Charlie Parker]], whose compositions and improvisations greatly inspired and influenced him. Mingus considered Parker the greatest genius and innovator in jazz history, but he had a love-hate relationship with Parker's legacy. Mingus blamed the Parker mythology for a derivative crop of pretenders to Parker's throne. He was also conflicted and sometimes disgusted by Parker's self-destructive habits and the romanticized lure of drug addiction they offered to other jazz musicians. In response to the many sax players who imitated Parker, Mingus titled a song, &quot;If [[Charlie Parker]] were a Gunslinger, There'd be a Whole Lot of Dead Copycats&quot; (released on ''[[Mingus Dynasty]]'' as &quot;Gunslinging Bird&quot;).

===Based in New York===
In 1952 Mingus co-founded [[Debut Records]] with [[Max Roach]], in order to conduct his recording career as he saw fit; the name originated with a desire to document unrecorded young musicians. Despite this, the best-known recording the company issued was of the most prominent figures in bebop. On May 15, 1953, Mingus joined [[Dizzy Gillespie]], Parker, [[Bud Powell]], and Roach for a concert at [[Massey Hall]] in Toronto, which is the [[Jazz at Massey Hall|last recorded documentation]] of the two lead instrumentalists playing together. After the event, Mingus chose to overdub his barely audible bass part back in New York; the original version was issued later. The two 10&quot; albums of the Massey Hall concert (one featured the trio of Powell, Mingus and Roach) were among Debut Records' earliest releases. Mingus may have objected to the way the major record companies treated musicians, but Gillespie once commented that he did not receive any royalties &quot;for years and years&quot; for his Massey Hall appearance. The records though, are often regarded as among the finest live jazz recordings. 

In 1955, Mingus was involved in a notorious incident while playing a club date billed as a &quot;reunion&quot; with Parker, Powell, and Roach. Powell, who suffered from alcoholism and mental illness (possibly exacerbated by a severe police beating and electroshock treatments), had to be helped from the stage, unable to play or speak coherently. As Powell's incapacitation became apparent, Parker stood in one spot at a microphone, chanting &quot;Bud Powell...Bud Powell...&quot; as if beseeching Powell's return. Allegedly, Parker continued this incantation for several minutes after Powell's departure, to his own amusement and Mingus' exasperation. Mingus took another microphone and announced to the crowd, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, this is not jazz; these are very sick men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/rexroth/jazz2.htm|title=Five More Articles on Jazz (Rexroth)|work=Bureau of Public Secrets article}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Parker's last public performance; about a week later he died after years of substance abuse.

Mingus often worked with a mid-sized ensemble (around 8–10 members) of rotating musicians known as the '''Jazz Workshop'''. Mingus broke new ground, constantly demanding that his musicians be able to explore and develop their perceptions on the spot. Those who joined the Workshop (or Sweatshops as they were colorfully dubbed by the musicians) included [[Pepper Adams]], [[Jaki Byard]], [[Booker Ervin]], [[John Handy]], [[Jimmy Knepper]], [[Charles McPherson (musician)|Charles McPherson]] and [[Horace Parlan]]. Mingus shaped these musicians into a cohesive improvisational machine that in many ways anticipated [[free jazz]]. Some musicians dubbed the workshop a &quot;university&quot; for jazz.

===''Pithecanthropus Erectus'' among other creations===
The decade which followed is generally regarded as Mingus's most productive and fertile period. Impressive new compositions and albums appeared at an astonishing rate: some ''thirty'' records in ten years, for a number of record labels ([[Atlantic Records]], [[Candid Records|Candid]], [[Columbia Records]], [[Impulse! Records]] and others), a pace perhaps unmatched by any other musician except Ellington. 

Mingus had already recorded around ten albums as a bandleader, but 1956 was a breakthrough year for him, with the release of ''[[Pithecanthropus Erectus (album)|Pithecanthropus Erectus]]'', arguably his first major work as both a bandleader and composer. Like Ellington, Mingus wrote songs with specific musicians in mind, and his band for ''Erectus'' included adventurous, though distinctly [[blues]]-oriented musicians, piano player [[Mal Waldron]], alto saxophonist [[Jackie McLean]] and the [[Sonny Rollins]]-influenced tenor of [[J. R. Monterose]]. The title song is a ten-minute [[tone poem]], depicting the rise of man from his [[hominidae|hominid]] roots ([[Java Man|''Pithecanthropus erectus'']]) to an eventual downfall. A section of the piece was [[free improvisation]], free of structure or theme.

Another album from this period, ''[[The Clown (album)|The Clown]]'' (1957 also on [[Atlantic Records]]), with an improvised story on the title track by humorist [[Jean Shepherd]], was the first to feature drummer [[Dannie Richmond]]. Richmond would be his preferred drummer until Mingus's death in 1979. The two men formed one of the most impressive and versatile [[rhythm section]]s in jazz. Both were accomplished performers seeking to stretch the boundaries of their music while staying true to its roots. When joined by pianist [[Jaki Byard]], they were dubbed &quot;The Almighty Three&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Saying Something: Jazz Improvisation and Interaction,'' Ingrid Monson (University of Chicago Press, 1997) ISBN 0-226-53478-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mingus Ah Um'' and other works===

Mingus witnessed [[Ornette Coleman]]'s legendary—and controversial—1960 appearances at [[New York City]]'s [[Five Spot]] jazz club. Though he initially expressed rather mixed feelings for Coleman's innovative music: &quot;...if the free-form guys could play the same tune twice, then I would say they were playing something...Most of the time they use their fingers on the saxophone and they don't even know what's going to come out. They're experimenting.&quot; Mingus was in fact a prime influence of the early [[free jazz]] era. He formed a quartet with Richmond, trumpeter [[Ted Curson]] and saxophonist [[Eric Dolphy]]. This ensemble featured the same instruments as Coleman's quartet, and is often regarded as Mingus rising to the challenging new standard established by Coleman. ''[[Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus]]'' was the quartet's only album.

Only one misstep occurred in this era: 1962's ''Town Hall Concert''. An ambitious program, it was unfortunately plagued with troubles from its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0023/santoro.php|title=Town Hall Train Wreck|author=Gene Santoro|date=2000-06-06|publisher=The Village Voice|accessdate=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mingus's vision, now known as ''[[Epitaph (Mingus)|Epitaph]]'', was finally realized by conductor Gunther Schuller in a concert in 1989, 10 years after Mingus's death.

===''The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady'' and the other Impulse! albums===
In 1963, Mingus released ''[[The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady]]'', a sprawling, multi-section masterpiece, described as &quot;one of the greatest achievements in orchestration by any composer in jazz history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=A4f867ur070jd|title=The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady|work=Album overview on Allmusic}} {{Dead link|date=January 2011|bot=CactusBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was also unique in that Mingus asked his psychotherapist to provide notes for the record. 

1963 also saw the release of an unaccompanied album ''Mingus Plays Piano''. A few pieces were entirely improvised and drew on classical music as much as jazz, preceding [[Keith Jarrett]]'s landmark ''[[The Köln Concert]]'' in those respects by some 12 years.

In 1964 Mingus put together one of his best-known groups, a sextet including [[Dannie Richmond]], [[Jaki Byard]], [[Eric Dolphy]], trumpeter [[Johnny Coles]], and tenor saxophonist [[Clifford Jordan]]. The group was recorded frequently during its short existence; Coles fell ill during a European tour. On June 28, 1964 Dolphy died while in Berlin. 1964 was also the year that Mingus met his future wife, [[Sue Mingus|Sue Graham Ungaro]]. The couple were married in 1966 by [[Allen Ginsberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/iviews/smingus.htm |title=Jazz |publisher=AllAboutJazz.com |date=1979-01-05 |accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing financial hardship, Mingus was evicted from his New York home in 1966.

===''Changes''===
Mingus's pace slowed somewhat in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1974 he formed a quintet with Richmond, pianist [[Don Pullen]], trumpeter [[Jack Walrath]] and saxophonist [[George Adams (musician)|George Adams]]. They recorded two well-received albums, ''[[Changes One (Mingus)|Changes One]]'' and ''[[Changes Two]]''. Mingus also played with [[Charles McPherson (musician)|Charles McPherson]] in many of his groups during this time. ''Cumbia and Jazz Fusion'' in 1976 sought to blend Colombian music (the &quot;[[Cumbia]]&quot; of the title) with more traditional jazz forms. In 1971, Mingus taught for a semester at the [[University at Buffalo|University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]] as the Slee Professor of Music.&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Styles of Charles Mingus,'' (Warner Bros. Publications, Jazz Workshop, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career and death===
By the mid-1970s, Mingus was suffering from [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], popularly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, a wastage of the musculature. His once formidable bass technique suffered, until he could no longer play the instrument. He continued composing, however, and supervised a number of recordings before his death.

He did not complete his final project of [[Mingus (album)|an album named after him]] with singer [[Joni Mitchell]], which included lyrics added by Mitchell to Mingus compositions, including &quot;[[Goodbye Pork Pie Hat]]&quot;, among Mitchell originals and short, spoken word duets and home recordings of Mitchell and Mingus. The album featured the talents of [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and another influential bassist and composer, [[Jaco Pastorius]]. Mingus died aged 56 in [[Cuernavaca]], Mexico where he had traveled for treatment and convalescence. His ashes were scattered in the [[Ganges River]].

==Legacy==
===The Mingus Big Band===
The music of Charles Mingus is currently being performed and reinterpreted by the [[Mingus Big Band]], which, starting October 2008, plays every Monday at Jazz Standard in New York City, and often tours the rest of the U.S. and Europe. [[Elvis Costello]] has written lyrics for a few Mingus pieces. He had once sung lyrics for one piece, &quot;Invisible Lady&quot;, being backed by the Mingus Big Band on the album, ''Tonight at Noon: Three of Four Shades of Love''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r584078|pure_url=yes}}|title= Tonight at Noon: Three of Four Shades of Love|work=Album overview on Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Mingus Big Band, there is the Mingus Orchestra and the [[Mingus Dynasty (band)|Mingus Dynasty]], each of which are managed by Jazz Workshop, Inc., and run by Mingus's widow Sue Graham Mingus.

===Epitaph===
''[[Epitaph (Mingus)|Epitaph]]'' is considered to be one of Charles Mingus' masterpieces. The composition is 4,235 measures long, requires two hours to perform, and is one of the longest jazz pieces ever written. ''Epitaph'' was only completely discovered during the cataloging process after his death by musicologist Andrew Homzy. With the help of a grant from the [[Ford Foundation]], the score and instrumental parts were copied, and the piece itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra, conducted by [[Gunther Schuller]]. This concert was produced by Mingus's widow, Sue Graham Mingus, at Alice Tully Hall on June 3, 1989, ten years after his death. It was performed again at several concerts in 2007. The performance at Walt Disney Concert Hall is available on [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92884124 NPR]. The complete score was published in 2008 by Hal Leonard.

===Autobiography===
Written throughout the 1960s, Mingus's sprawling, exaggerated, quasi-autobiography, ''Beneath the Underdog: His World as composed by Mingus''.,&lt;ref&gt;Mingus, Charles. Beneath the Underdog: His Life as Composed by Mingus. New York, NY: Vintage, 1991.
&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1971. Written in a &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; style, it covered several aspects of Mingus's life that had previously been off-record. 

In addition to his musical and intellectual proliferation, Mingus goes into great detail about his perhaps overstated sexual exploits. He claims to have had over 31 affairs over the course of his life (including 26 prostitutes in one sitting). This does not include any of his five wives (he claims to have been married to two of them simultaneously). In addition, he asserts that he held a brief career as a pimp. This has never been confirmed. 

Mingus's autobiography also serves as an insight into his psyche, as well as his attitudes about race and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ratliff |first=Ben |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E3D81339F93BA25752C0A96E958260 |title=JAZZ VIEW; Hearing Mingus Again, Seeing Him Anew - The |publisher=New York Times |date=1998-01-18 |accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autobiographic accounts of abuse at the hands of his father from an early age, being bullied as a child, his removal from a white musician's union, and grappling with disapproval while married to white women and other examples of the hardship and prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Friday, Oct. 02, 1964 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940521-2,00.html |title=Jazz: Beneath the Underdog |publisher=TIME |date=1964-10-02 |accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cover versions===
Considering the number of compositions that Charles Mingus wrote, his works have not been recorded as often as comparable jazz composers. About the only Mingus tribute album recorded in his lifetime was baritone saxophonist [[Pepper Adams]]'s album, ''Pepper Adams Plays Charlie Mingus'' in 1963. Of all his works, his elegant elegy for [[Lester Young]], &quot;[[Goodbye Pork Pie Hat]]&quot; (from ''[[Mingus Ah Um]]'') has probably had the most recordings. Besides recordings from the expected jazz artists, the song has also been recorded by musicians as disparate as [[Jeff Beck]], [[Andy Summers]], [[Eugene Chadbourne]], and [[Bert Jansch]] and [[John Renbourn]] with and without [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]]. [[Joni Mitchell]] sang a version with lyrics that she wrote for the song. 

[[Elvis Costello]] has recorded &quot;Hora Decubitus&quot; (from ''[[Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus]]'') on ''My Flame Burns Blue'' (2006). &quot;Better Git It in Your Soul&quot; was covered by [[Davey Graham]] on his album &quot;Folk, Blues, and Beyond.&quot; Trumpeter Ron Miles performs a version of &quot;Pithecanthropus Erectus&quot; on his EP &quot;Witness.&quot; New York Ska Jazz Ensemble has done a cover of Mingus' &quot;Haitian Fight Song&quot;, as have Pentangle and others. [[Hal Willner]]'s 1992 tribute album ''Weird Nightmare: Meditations on Mingus'' ([[Columbia Records]]) contains idiosyncratic renditions of Mingus's works involving numerous popular musicians including [[Chuck D]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Henry Rollins]] and [[Dr. John]]. The Italian band [[Quintorigo]] recorded an entire album devoted to Mingus' music, titled ''Play Mingus''. &quot;[[We Suck Young Blood]]&quot; by [[Radiohead]] (2003) is based heavily on Mingus' &quot;Freedom&quot; (also from ''[[Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus]]'').

[[Gunther Schuller]]'s edition of Mingus' &quot;Epitaph&quot; which premiered at [[Lincoln Center]] in 1989 was subsequently released on Columbia/Sony Records.

One of the ultimate tributes to Mingus came on September 29, 1969 at a festival honoring him. [[Duke Ellington]] performed ''The Clown'' at the festival. Duke himself did [[Jean Shepherd]]'s naration. As of this date, this recording has not been issued.

===Personality and temper===
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2010}}
As respected as Mingus was for his musical talents, he was sometimes feared for his occasional violent onstage temper, which was at times directed at members of his band, and other times aimed at the audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;wynnkatz&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last =Wynn | first =Ron | authorlink= Ron Wynn | last2=Katz | first2=Mike |editor=[[Ron Wynn]]|others=M. Erlewine, V. Bogdanov| year =1994 | title =[[All Music Guide to Jazz]] | place =San Francisco | publisher =Miller Freeman | isbn =0879303085 | page=461}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was physically large, prone to obesity (especially in his later years), and was by all accounts often intimidating and frightening when expressing anger or displeasure. Mingus was prone to clinical depression. He tended to have brief periods of extreme creative activity, intermixed with fairly long periods of greatly decreased output.

When confronted with a nightclub audience talking and clinking ice in their glasses while he performed, Mingus stopped his band and loudly chastised the audience, stating &quot;[[Isaac Stern]] doesn't have to put up with this shit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MvpncVMGp_AC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=isaac+stern+mingus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mjLkNuWdkj&amp;sig=KswJqcTPJE85PcE2CygyGDrFdhs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WJCXSvjqJ8iOlQeXo_nJBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#v=onepage&amp;q=isaac%20stern%20mingus&amp;f=false | title=Tonight at Noon | author=Sue Graham Mingus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Passed VERIFICATION|date=APRIL 2008--&gt; He once played a prank on a similar group of nightclub chatterers by silencing his band for several seconds, allowing the loud audience members to be clearly heard, then continuing as the rest of the audience snickered at the oblivious &quot;soloists&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Mingus reportedly destroyed a $20,000 bass in response to audience [[heckler|heckling]] at New York's [[Five Spot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wynn&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last =Wynn | first =Ron | authorlink= Ron Wynn |editor=[[Ron Wynn]]|others=M.

Guitarist and singer [[Jackie Paris]] was a first-hand witness to Mingus's irascibility. Paris recalls his time in the Jazz Workshop: &quot;He chased everybody off the stand except [drummer] [[Paul Motian]] and me... The three of us just wailed on the blues for about an hour and a half before he called the other cats back.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackieparis.com/sizzles.htm|title=Paris When He Sizzles|work=Village Voice article by Will Friedwald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 1962, Mingus punched [[Jimmy Knepper]] in the mouth while the two men were working together at Mingus's apartment on a score for his upcoming concert at New York Town Hall and Knepper refused to take on more work. The blow from Mingus broke off a crowned tooth and its underlying stub.&lt;ref&gt;Santoro, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- (that's the Village Voice article cited earlier) --&gt; According to Knepper, this ruined his [[embouchure]] and resulted in the permanent loss of the top octave of his range on the trombone - a significant handicap for any professional trombonist. This attack temporarily ended their working relationship and Knepper was unable to perform at the concert. Charged with assault, Mingus appeared in court in January, 1963 and was given a suspended sentence. Knepper would again work with Mingus in 1977 and played extensively with the [[Mingus Dynasty]], formed after Mingus' death in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jimmy-knepper-548287.html |title=Jimmy Knepper - Obituaries, News |publisher=The Independent |date= June 16, 2003|accessdate=2009-10-08 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mingus was evicted from his apartment at 5 Great Jones Street in New York City for nonpayment of rent, captured in the film ''Mingus: 1968'', by Thomas Reichman, which also features Mingus performing in clubs and in the apartment, shooting a shotgun, composing at the piano, and discussing love, art, and politics and the music school he had hoped to create.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Unit of length|m=0.01|accuracy=4&lt;!--number of significant figures--&gt;}}
A '''centimetre''' ([[American English|American spelling]]: '''centimeter''', symbol '''cm''') is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[length]] in the [[metric system]], equal to one hundredth of a [[metre]], which is the current [[International System of Units|SI]] [[SI base unit|base unit]] of length. Centi is the [[SI prefix]] for a factor of {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter3/prefixes.html BIPM - SI prefixes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Hence a centimetre can be written as {{nowrap|10{{e|&amp;minus;3}}&amp;nbsp;m}} ([[engineering notation]]) or {{nowrap|1E&amp;minus;2&amp;nbsp;m}} ([[Scientific notation#E notation|scientific E notation]]) — meaning {{nowrap|10&amp;nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]]}} or {{nowrap|1&amp;nbsp;m/100}} respectively.  The centimetre is the base unit of length in the now deprecated [[centimetre-gram-second]] (CGS) system of units.

Though for many physical quantities, [[SI prefix]]es for factors of 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;—like ''milli-'' and ''kilo-''—are often preferred by technicians, the centimetre remains a practical unit of length for many everyday measurements. A centimetre is approximately the width of the fingernail of an adult person (between 3/8 [[inch|in]] and 7/16 inch on an English inch ruler).  
[[Image:1cm.PNG|right|frame|1 centimetre]]
==Equivalence to other units of length==
[[Image:CarpentersRule.png|thumb|A carpenters' ruler with centimetre divisions]]
1 centimetre is ''[[equal]]'' to:
* 0.01 metre, which can be represented by [[1 E-2 m|1.00 E-2 m]] (1 metre is equal to 100 centimetres)
* about 0.393700787401575 [[inch]] (1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimetres) &lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Inch.html Inch - from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- More: .3937007874015748031496062992125984251968503937007874015748031496062992125984251968503937 --&gt;
1 cubic centimetre is equal to 1 [[litre|millilitre]], under the current [[SI]] system of units.

==Uses of centimetre==
In addition to its use in the measurement of [[length]], the centimetre is used:
* sometimes, to report the level of rainfall as measured by a [[rain gauge]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weathershack.com/education/rain-measurement.html Rain Measurement, Rain Gauge, Wireless Rain Gauge, Rain Gage, Rain Gauge Data&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* in the CGS system, the centimetre is used to measure [[capacitance]], where 1 cm of capacitance = 1.113&amp;times;10&lt;math&gt;^{-12}&lt;/math&gt; [[Farad]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Capacitance.html Capacitance - from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* in  maps, centimetres are used to make conversions from map scale to real world scale (kilometres)
* to represent second moment of areas (cm^4)
==Unicode symbols==
For the purposes of compatibility with [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korea]]n ([[CJK]]) characters, [[Unicode]] has symbols for: &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U3300.pdf] CJK Compatibility excerpt from The Unicode Standard, Version 4.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
* centimetre (㎝) - code 339D
* square centimetre (㎠) - code 33A0
* cubic centimetre (㎤) - code 33A4

They are mostly used only with East Asian fixed-width [[CJK]] fonts, because they are equal in size to one Chinese character.

*[[1 E-2 m]]
*[[Conversion of units]], for comparison with other units of length
*[[Reciprocal centimetre]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Committee on Data for Science and Technology''' ('''CODATA''') was established in 1966 as an interdisciplinary committee of the ''[[International Council for Science]]''. It seeks to improve the compilation, critical evaluation, storage, and retrieval of data of importance to [[science]] and [[technology]].

The CODATA Task Group on Fundamental Constants was established in 1969. Its purpose is to periodically provide the international scientific and technological communities with an internationally accepted set of values of the fundamental [[physical constant]]s and closely related [[conversion factor]]s for use worldwide. The first such CODATA set was published in 1973, later in 1986, 1998, 2002 and the fifth in 2006.

The CODATA recommended values of fundamental physical constants are published at the NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty.&lt;ref name=&quot;CODATA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/codata.pdf |title=CODATA Recommended Values of the Fundamental Physical Constants: 2006 |work=Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) |publisher=[[NIST]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

CODATA sponsors the [http://www.codata.org/archives/conferences.html CODATA international conference] every two years.

'''Charles Martin &quot;Chuck&quot; Jones''' (September 21, 1912 &amp;ndash; February 22, 2002) was an American [[animator]], [[cartoon artist]], [[screenwriter]], [[film producer|producer]], and [[film director|director]] of [[animation|animated]] films, most memorably of ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' shorts for the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] studio. He directed many of the classic short [[animated cartoon]]s starring [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], the [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner|Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote]], [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]], [[Pepé Le Pew]] and a slew of other Warner characters. Three of these shorts (''[[Duck Amuck]]'', ''[[One Froggy Evening]]'' and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]'') were later inducted into the [[National Film Registry]]. Chief among Jones' other works was the famous &quot;Hunting Trilogy&quot; of ''[[Rabbit Fire]]'', ''[[Rabbit Seasoning]]'', and ''[[Duck! Rabbit, Duck!]]'' (1951–1953).

After his career at Warner Bros. ended in 1962, Jones started [[MGM Animation/Visual Arts|Sib Tower 12 Productions]] and began producing cartoons for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], including a new series of [[Tom and Jerry, The Chuck Jones Collection|''Tom and Jerry'' shorts]] and the television adaptation of [[Dr. Seuss]]' ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas (animated short)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]''. He later started his own studio, '''Chuck Jones Productions''', which created several one-shot specials, and periodically worked on ''Looney Tunes'' related works.

==Early life==
Jones was born in [[Spokane, Washington]] on September 21, 1912. He later moved with his parents and three siblings to the [[Los Angeles, California]] area. 

In his autobiography, ''Chuck Amuck'', Jones credits his artistic bent to circumstances surrounding his father, who was an unsuccessful businessman in California in the 1920s. His father, Jones recounts, would start every new business venture by purchasing new stationery and new pencils with the company name on them. When the business failed, his father would quietly turn the huge stacks of useless stationery and pencils over to his children, requiring them to use up all the material as fast as possible. Armed with an endless supply of high-quality paper and pencils, the children drew constantly. Later, in one art school class, the professor gravely informed the students that they each had 100,000 bad drawings in them that they must first get past before they could possibly draw anything worthwhile. Jones recounted years later that this pronouncement came as a great relief to him, as he was well past the 200,000 mark, having used up all that stationery. Jones and several of his siblings went on to artistic careers. 

After graduating from [[Chouinard Art Institute]], Jones held a number of low-ranking jobs in the animation industry, including washing cels at the [[Ub Iwerks]] studio and assistant animator at the [[Walter Lantz]] studio. While at Iwerks, he met a cel painter named Dorothy Webster, who would later become his first wife.

==Warner Bros.==
Chuck Jones joined Leon Schlesinger Productions, the independent studio that produced ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' for [[Warner Bros.]], in 1933 as an assistant animator. In 1935, he was promoted to animator, and assigned to work with new Schlesinger director [[Tex Avery]]. There was no room for the new Avery unit in Schlesinger's small studio, so Avery, Jones, and fellow animators [[Bob Clampett]], [[Virgil Ross]], and [[Sid Sutherland]] were moved into a small adjacent building they dubbed &quot;Termite Terrace&quot;. When Clampett was promoted to director in 1937, Jones was assigned to his unit; the Clampett unit was briefly assigned to work with Jones' old employer, Ub Iwerks, when Iwerks subcontracted four cartoons to Schlesinger in 1937. Jones became a director (or &quot;supervisor&quot;, the original title for an animation director in the studio) himself in 1938 when [[Frank Tashlin]] left the studio. Jones' first cartoon was ''[[The Night Watchman]]'', which featured a cute kitten who would later evolve into [[Sniffles]] the mouse.

Many of Jones' cartoons of the 1930s and early 1940s were lavishly animated, but audiences and fellow Schlesinger staff members found them lacking in genuine humor.  Often slow-moving and overbearing with &quot;cuteness&quot;, Jones' early cartoons were an attempt to follow in the footsteps of [[Walt Disney]]'s shorts (especially with such cartoons as ''[[Tom Thumb in Trouble]]'' and the Sniffles cartoons). Jones finally left traditional animation conventions with the cartoon ''[[The Dover Boys]]'' in 1942.  Jones credits this cartoon as the film where he &quot;learned how to be funny.&quot; ''The Dover Boys'' is also one of the first uses of [[limited animation|stylized animation]] in American film, breaking away from the more realistic animation styles influenced by the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney Studio]]. This was also the period where Jones created many of his lesser-known characters, including [[Charlie Dog]], [[Hubie and Bertie]], and [[The Three Bears (Looney Tunes)|The Three Bears]]. Despite their relative obscurity today, the shorts starring these characters represent some of Jones' earliest work that was strictly intended to be ''funny''.

During the [[World War II]] years, Jones worked closely with Theodor Geisel, better known as [[Dr. Seuss]], to create the ''[[Private Snafu]]'' series of Army educational cartoons. Private Snafu comically educated soldiers on topics like [[espionage|spies]] and laziness in a more risque way than general audiences would have been used to at the time. Jones would later collaborate with Seuss on a number of adaptations of Seuss' books to animated form, most importantly ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' in 1966.  

Also, during World War II, Jones directed such shorts as ''[[The Weakly Reporter]]'', a 1944 short that related to shortages and rationing on the home front.  During the same year, he directed ''[[Hell-Bent for Election]]'', a campaign film for [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

Not widely known, he also directed [[Angel Puss]] in this period which contains portrayals of [[African American|African-Americans]] that are now considered offensive; it is no longer available in any type of authorized release and is among the group of controversial cartoons known to animation buffs as the [[Censored Eleven]]. 

[[Image:Whats Opera Doc still.png|thumb|A still from ''[[What's Opera Doc|What's Opera, Doc?]]''.]]
Jones hit his stride in the late 1940s, and continued to make his best-regarded works through the 1950s. Jones-created characters from this period includes [[Claude Cat]], [[Marc Antony and Pussyfoot]], Charlie Dog, [[Michigan J. Frog]], and his three most popular creations, [[Pepe LePew]], the Road Runner, and Wile E. Coyote.  The Road Runner cartoons, in addition to the cartoons that are considered his masterpieces (all written and conceived by [[Michael Maltese]]), ''Duck Amuck'', ''One Froggy Evening'', and ''What's Opera, Doc?'' are today hailed by critics as some of the best cartoons ever made.

The staff of the Jones' Unit A were as important to the success of these cartoons as Jones himself. Key members included writer Maltese, layout artist/background designer/co-director [[Maurice Noble]], animator and co-director [[Abe Levitow]], and animators [[Ken Harris]] and [[Ben Washam]].

In 1950, Jones and Maltese began working on ''Rabbit Fire'', a short that changed Daffy Duck's personality forever. They decided to make him a totally different character; instead of the wacky, [[comic relief]] character he had been, they turned Daffy into a vain, egomaniacal prima donna wanting to steal the spotlight from Bugs Bunny. Of his versions of Bugs and Daffy, Chuck Jones has said, &quot;Bugs is who we want to be. Daffy is who we are.&quot;

Jones remained at Warner Bros. throughout the 1950s, except for a brief period in 1953 when Warner closed the animation studio. During this interim, Jones found employment at [[Walt Disney Pictures]], where he teamed with [[Ward Kimball]] for a four month period of uncredited work on ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959). Upon the reopening of the Warner animation department, Jones was rehired and reunited with most of his unit.

In the early-1960s, Jones and his wife Dorothy wrote the [[screenplay]] for the animated feature ''[[Gay Purr-ee]]''. The finished film would feature the voices of [[Judy Garland]], [[Robert Goulet]] and [[Red Buttons]] as [[cat]]s in [[Paris, France]]. The feature was produced by [[United Productions of America|UPA]], and directed by his former Warner collaborator, Abe Levitow. Jones moonlighted to work on the film, since he had an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. UPA completed the film and made it available for distribution in 1962; it was picked up by Warner Bros. When Warner discovered that Jones had violated his exclusive contract with them, they terminated him.&lt;ref name=&quot;endofstudio&quot;&gt;Barrier, Michael (1999). ''Hollywood Cartoons''. New York: Oxford University Press. Pg. 562-563. ISBN 0-19-516729-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones' former animation unit was laid off after completing the final cartoon in their pipeline, ''[[The Iceman Ducketh]]'', and the rest of the Warner Bros. Cartoons studio was closed in early 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;endofstudio&quot; /&gt; (Jones frequently claimed, including in the aforementioned autobiography, that this happened because Warner finally learned ''they'' weren't making [[Mickey Mouse]] cartoons).

==Jones on his own==
With business partner [[Les Goldman]], Jones started an independent animation studio Sib Tower 12 Productions, bringing on most of his unit from Warner Bros., including Maurice Noble and Michael Maltese. In 1963, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contracted with Sib Tower 12 to have Jones and his staff produce new ''[[Tom and Jerry (MGM)|Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons. In 1964, Sib Tower 12 was absorbed by MGM and was renamed [[MGM Animation/Visual Arts]]. Jones' animated short film ''[[The Dot and the Line|The Dot and the Line: A Romance in Lower Mathematics]]'' won the 1965 [[Academy award|Oscar]] for Best Animated Short. Jones also directed the classic animated short &quot;[[The Bear That Wasn't]]&quot;.

As the ''Tom and Jerry'' series wound down (it would be discontinued in 1967), Jones moved on to television. In 1966, he produced and directed the TV special ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas!'', featuring the voice and facial features of [[Boris Karloff]]. Jones continued to work on TV specials such as ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (TV special)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (1970), but his main focus during this time was producing the feature film ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth (film)|The Phantom Tollbooth]]'', which did lukewarm business when [[MGM]] released it in 1970. Jones co-directed 1969's ''The Pogo Special Birthday Special'', based on the [[Walt Kelly]] comic strip, and voiced the characters of Porky Pine and Bun Rab.

MGM closed the animation division in 1970, and Jones once again started his own studio, Chuck Jones Productions. He produced a Saturday morning children's TV series for the [[American Broadcasting Company]] called ''[[Curiosity Shop|The Curiosity Shop]]'' in 1971. In 1973, he produced an animated version of the [[George Selden (author)|George Selden]] book ''[[The Cricket in Times Square]]'', and would go on to produce two sequels. His most notable work during this period was three animated TV adaptations of short stories from [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'': ''[[Mowgli]]'s Brothers'', ''The White Seal'' and ''[[Rikki-Tikki-Tavi]]''. Jones resumed working with Warner Bros. in 1976 with the animated TV adaptation of ''[[Bugs and Daffy's Carnival of the Animals|The Carnival of the Animals]]'' with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. Jones also produced the 1979 movie ''[[The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie]]''  which was a compilation of Jones' best theatrical shorts; Jones produced new Road Runner shorts for ''[[The Electric Company]]'' series and ''Bugs Bunny's Looney Christmas Tales'' (1979), and even newer shorts were made for ''Bugs Bunny's Bustin' Out All Over'' (1980).

From 1977-1978, Jones wrote and drew the syndicated comic strip ''Crawford'' (also known as ''Crawford &amp; Morgan'') for the [[Chicago Tribune-NY News Syndicate]].  IDW will collect the strip in 2011 as part of their Library of American Comic Strips.

In 1978, Jones' wife Dorothy died; three years later, he married [[Marian Dern]], the writer of the comic strip ''[[Rick O'Shay]]''.

==The Chuck Jones Show==
From 2001 - 2002 [[Cartoon Network]] aired ''The Chuck Jones Show'' which features shorts directed by him. The show won the [[Annie Award]] for Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Special Project.

==Later years==
Through the 1980s and 1990s, Jones was painting cartoon and parody art, sold through animation galleries by his daughter's company, Linda Jones Enterprises. Jones was the creative consultant and character designer for 2 [[Raggedy Ann]] animated specials and the first ''Alvin and the Chipmunks'' Christmas special &quot;[[A Chipmunk Christmas]]&quot;. He was also creating new cartoons for the [[Internet]] based on his new character, [[Thomas Timberwolf]]. He made a cameo appearance in the 1984 film ''[[Gremlins]]'' and directed the Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck animated sequences that bookend ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]'' (1990). Jones also directed animated sequences various features such as a lengthy sequence in the 1992 film ''[[Stay Tuned (film)|Stay Tuned]]'' and a shorter one seen at the start of the 1993 film ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]''. Jones was not a fan of much contemporary animation, terming most of it, especially [[television]] cartoons such as those of [[Hanna-Barbera]], &quot;[[illustrated radio]]&quot;.

In 1988, Jones contributed to the creation of London's [[Museum of the Moving Image (London)|Museum of the Moving Image]] by spending several days working high on scaffolding creating a chase sequence directly onto the high walls of the museum.

Jones was a historical authority as well as a major contributor to the development of animation throughout the 20th century. He received an honorary degree from [[Oglethorpe University]] in 1993.

In his later years, Jones became the most vocal alumnus of the Termite Terrace studio, frequently giving lectures, seminars, and working to educate newcomers in the animation field. Many of his principles, therefore, found their way back into the mainstream animation consciousness, and can be seen in films such as ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'' and ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch]]''.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Jones has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 7011 Hollywood Blvd.  

Jones, whose work had been nominated eight times over his career for an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] (winning thrice: ''For Scent-imental Reasons'', ''[[So Much for So Little]]'', and ''The Dot and the Line''), received an [[Honorary Academy Award]] in 1996 by the Board of Governors of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], for &quot;the creation of classic cartoons and cartoon characters whose animated lives have brought joy to our real ones for more than half a century.&quot;  At that year's awards show, [[Robin Williams]], a self-confessed &quot;Jones-aholic,&quot; presented the Honorary award to Jones, calling him &quot;The [[Orson Welles]] of cartoons.&quot;

Jones' final Looney Tunes cartoon was ''[[From Hare to Eternity]]'' in 1996, which starred Bugs Bunny and [[Yosemite Sam]], with [[Greg Burson]] voicing Bugs. The cartoon was dedicated to [[Friz Freleng]], who had passed on in 1995. Jones did produce a few more Looney Tunes-based and non-related cartoons, a noticeable one being ''[[Chariots of Fur]]'', his final Road Runner cartoon, in 1994.

Jones, the second to last surviving animation director from the &quot;[[Termite Terrace]]&quot; days of the WB cartoons, died of [[heart failure]] in 2002. He was [[cremation|cremated]] and his ashes were scattered at sea. [[Cartoon Network (United States)|Cartoon Network]] aired a 30-second segment with black dots tracing Jones'  [[portrait]] with the words &quot;We'll miss you - Cartoon Network&quot; fading in on the right-hand side, which aired during a four-hour installment of ''The Looney Tunes Show'' that featured nothing but Chuck Jones' most memorable cartoon shorts.

After his death, the Looney Tunes cartoon ''[[Daffy Duck for President]]'', based on [[Daffy Duck for President|the book]] that Jones had written and using Jones' style for the characters, originally scheduled to be released in 2000, was released in 2004.

The term '''costume''' can refer to [[Wardrobe (clothing)|wardrobe]] and [[style of dress|dress]] in general, or to the distinctive style of dress of a particular people, class, or period. Costume may also refer to the artistic arrangement of accessories in a [[picture]], [[statue]], [[poem]], or [[Play (theatre)|play]], appropriate to the time, place, or other circumstances represented or described, or to a particular style of [[clothing]] worn to portray the wearer as a [[Character (arts)|character]] or type of character other than their regular persona at a social event such as a [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]], a [[fancy dress party]] or in an artistic [[Theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]].

==Major categories==
===Theatrical costume===

{{main|Stage clothes}}

[[Image:yakshagana vesha.jpg|thumb|left| Costume used in [[yakshagana]]-a theater art from India.]]

One of the more prominent places people see costumes is in theatre, film and on television. In combination with other aspects, theatrical costumes can help actors portray characters' age, gender role, profession, social class, personality, ethnicity, and even information about the historical period/era, geographic location and time of day, as well as the season or weather of the theatrical performance. Often, stylized theatrical costumes can exaggerate some aspect of a character; for example Harlequin and Pantaloon in the Commedia dell'arte.

===National costume===
[[National costume]] or regional costume expresses local (or [[exile]]d) [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and emphasises a culture's unique attributes.  It is often a source of national pride.  Examples of such are a [[Scotland|Scotsman]] in a [[kilt]] or a [[Japan]]ese person in a [[kimono]].

===Holidays and festivals===
[[Image:Oldfashioned.jpg‎|thumb|right|200px|A traditional, European-style [[Santa suit]]]]

The wearing of costumes has become an important part of such [[holidays]] and [[festivals]] as [[Mardi Gras]] and [[Halloween]] (see [[Halloween costume]] for more information), and (to a lesser extent) people may also wear costumes in conjunction with other [[religious holiday|holiday]]s, such as [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]]. Mardi Gras costumes usually take the form of [[jester]]s and other fantasy characters, while Halloween costumes traditionally take the form of [[supernatural]] creatures such as [[ghosts]], [[vampires]], pop culture icons and [[angels]]. Christmas and Easter costumes typically portray mythical characters such as [[Santa Claus]] (by donning a [[santa suit]] and [[beard]]) or the [[Easter Bunny]] by putting on an animal costume. Costumes may serve to portray various other characters during secular holidays, such as an [[Uncle Sam]] costume worn on the [[Independence Day (US)|Independence day]] for example.

In [[Judaism]], a common practice is to dress up on [[Purim]]. The Jews celebrate the change of their destiny. They were delivered from being the victims of an evil decree against them and were instead allowed by the King to destroy their enemies. A quote from the [[Book of Esther]], which says: &quot;On the contrary&quot; ([[hebrew]]: ונהפוך הוא ) is the reason that wearing a costume has become so popular among the Jews on this holiday.

===Children===
Costumes also serve as an avenue for children to explore and roleplay.  Children can dress up in various forms; for example characters from history or fiction like pirates, [[princesses]] or cowboys, common jobs like nurses or police officers, or animals such as those seen in zoos or farms.

===Mascots===
Another very popular situation where costumes are employed are for sporting events, where people dressed as their team's representative [[mascot]] help the club or team rally round their team's cause. Animal costumes which are visually very similar to mascot costumes are also popular among the members of the [[furry fandom]] where they are referred to as [[fursuit]]s.

[[Image:Cable Car.jpg|thumb|right|Cable Car in San Francisco - double-ended car (California line)]]

A '''cable car''' or '''cable railway''' is a [[mass transit]] system using rail cars that are hauled by a continuously moving [[Wire rope|cable]] running at a constant speed. Individual cars stop and start by releasing and gripping this cable as required. Cable cars are distinct from [[funicular]]s, where the cars are permanently attached to the cable, and [[cable railway]]s, which are similar to funiculars, but where the rail vehicles are attached and detached manually.

== History ==
[[Image:Minories stationLBR.jpg|thumb|left|Winding drums on the [[London and Blackwall Railway|London and Blackwall]] cable-operated railway, 1840.]]
The first cable-operated railway was the [[London and Blackwall Railway]], which opened in east [[London]], England, in 1840. However the rope available at the time proved too susceptible to wear and the system was abandoned in favour of [[steam locomotives]] after eight years. Though there may have been earlier attempts to pull cars by endless ropes, the first cable car installation in operation was the [[IRT Ninth Avenue Line|West Side and Yonkers Patent Railway]] in [[New York]], which ran from 1 July 1868 to 1870. The cable technology used in this elevated railway involved collar-equipped cables and claw-equipped cars, and proved cumbersome. The line was closed and rebuilt, and reopened with [[steam locomotives]].

The first cable cars to use grips were those of the [[Clay Street Hill Railroad]], which later became part of the [[San Francisco cable car system]]. The building of this line was promoted by [[Andrew Smith Hallidie]] with design work by [[William Eppelsheimer]], and it was first tested in 1873. The success of these grips ensured that this line became the model for other cable car transit systems, and this model is often known as the ''Hallidie Cable Car''.

In 1881 the [[Dunedin cable tramway system]] opened in [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]] and became the first such system outside San Francisco. For Dunedin, [[George Smith Duncan]] further developed the Hallidie model, introducing the pull curve and the slot brake; the former was a way to pull cars through a curve, since Dunedin's curves were too steep to allow coasting, while the latter forced a wedge down into the cable slot to stop the car. Both of these innovations were generally adopted by other cities, including San Francisco.

Cable cars rapidly spread to other cities, although the major attraction for most was the ability to displace [[horse]]-drawn (or other animal-drawn) systems rather than the ability to climb hills. Many people at the time viewed horse-drawn transit as unnecessarily cruel, and the fact that a typical horse could work only four or five hours per day necessitated the maintenance of large stables of draft animals that had to be fed (typically {{convert|30|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of feed each day), housed, groomed, medicated and rested. Thus for a period economics worked in favour of cable cars even in relatively flat cities.

For example, the [[Chicago City Railway]], also designed by Eppelsheimer, opened in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]] in 1882 and went on to become the largest and most profitable cable car system. As with many cities, the problem in flat Chicago was not one of grades but of transportation capacity. This caused a different approach to the combination of grip car and trailer. Rather than using a grip car and single trailer, as many cities did, or combining the grip and trailer into a single car, like San Francisco's ''California Cars'', Chicago used grip cars to pull trains of up to three trailers.

In 1883 the [[New York and Brooklyn Bridge Railway]] was opened, which had a most curious feature: though it was a cable car system, it used [[steam locomotive]]s to get the cars into and out of the terminals. After 1896 the system changed to one where a motor car was added to each train to maneuver at the terminals, while en route the trains were still propelled by the cable.
[[Image:Cablecarpicjpg.jpg|thumb|right|A San Francisco cable car travels along California Street in the city's Financial District.]]
On 25 September 1883 a test of a cable car system was held by [[Liverpool United]] in [[Kirkdale, Liverpool|Kirkdale]]. This would have been the first cable car system in Europe, but Liverpool United decided against implementing it. Instead the distinction went to the 1884 route from [[Archway, London|Archway]] to [[Highgate]], north London, which used a continuous cable and grip system on the 1 in 11 (9%) climb of Highgate Hill. The installation was not reliable and was replaced by electric traction in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Sheila|title=The Moving Metropolis|publisher=Calmann and King|location=London|year=2001|page=82|isbn=1-856692-41-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cable car systems were implemented in Europe, though, among which was the [[Glasgow Subway|Glasgow District Subway]], the first underground cable car system, in 1896. ([[London]]'s first deep-level tube railway, the [[City &amp; South London Railway]], had earlier also been built for cable haulage but had been converted to electric traction before opening in 1890.) A few more cable car systems were built in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Portugal]] and [[France]], but European cities, having many more curves in their streets, were less suitable for cable cars than American cities.

Though some new cable car systems were still being built, by 1890 the cheaper to construct and simpler to operate [[electricity|electrically]]-powered [[tram|trolley]] or tram started to become the norm, and eventually started to replace existing cable car systems. For a while hybrid cable/electric systems operated, for example in Chicago where electric cars had to be pulled by grip cars through the loop area, due to the lack of trolley wires there. Eventually, San Francisco became the only street-running manually-operated system to survive - Dunedin, the second city with such cars, was also the second-last city to operate them, closing down in 1957.

In the last decades of the 20th century cable traction in general has seen a limited revival as [[People mover|automatic people movers]], used in resort areas, airports (for example,, [[LINK Train|Toronto Airport]]) and huge hospital centers. Whilst many of these systems involve cars permanently attached to the cable, the system developed by [[Poma-Otis]], a company formed by the merger of the cable car interests of the [[Pomagalski]] ski lift company and the [[Otis Elevator Company]], allows the car to be decoupled from the cable under computer control, and can thus be considered a modern interpretation of the cable car.

==Operation==
[[Image:San Francisco Cable Car Power House.jpg|thumb|left|Machinery driving the San Francisco cable car system]]
The cable is itself powered by a stationary motor or engine situated in a cable house or power house. The speed at which it moves is relatively constant, although affected by the current load.

The cable car begins moving when a clamping device, called a ''[[Cable grip|grip]]'', is connected to the moving cable, and applies pressure. Conversely the car is stopped by releasing pressure on the cable (with or without completely detaching) and applying the brakes. This gripping and ungripping action may be manual, as was the case in all early cable car systems, or automatic, as is the case in some recent cable operated [[people mover]] type systems. Gripping must be an even and gradual process in order to avoid bringing the car to cable speed too quickly and unacceptably jarring the [[passenger]]s.

In the case of manual systems, the grip resembles a very large pair of [[pliers]], and considerable strength and skill are required to operate the car. As many early cable car operators discovered the hard way, if the grip is not applied properly, it can damage the cable, or even worse, become entangled in the cable. In the latter case, the cable car may not be able to stop and can wreak havoc along its route until the cable house realizes the mishap and halts the cable.

One claimed advantage of the cable car is its relative energy efficiency, because of the economy of centrally-located power stations, and the ability of descending cars to transfer energy to ascending cars. This advantage is not unique to cable cars, as electric cars with [[regenerative braking]] offer the same advantages, and in any case they must be offset against the cost of moving the cable. In the case of steep grades, however, cable traction has the advantage of not depending on [[rail adhesion|adhesion between wheels and rails]].

Because of the constant and relatively low speed, cable cars can be underestimated in an accident. Even with a cable car traveling at only 9 miles per hour, the mass of the cable car and the combined strength of the cables can do quite a lot of harm in a collision.

== Relation to Funiculars == &lt;!-- Do not make this section about funiculars --&gt;
A cable car is superficially similar to a [[funicular]], but differs from such a system in that its cars are not permanently attached to the cable and can stop independently, whereas a funicular has cars that are permanently attached to the propulsion cable, which is itself stopped and started. A cable car cannot climb as steep a grade as a funicular, but many more cars can be operated with a single cable, making it more flexible, and allowing a higher capacity. During the rush hour on San Francisco's Market Street Railway, a car would leave the terminal every 15 seconds.

A few funicular railways operate in street traffic, and because of this operation are often incorrectly described a cable cars. Examples of such operation, and the consequent confusion, are:
* The [[Great Orme Tramway]] in [[Llandudno]], [[Wales]].
* Several street funiculars in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].

Even more confusingly, a hybrid cable car/funicular line once existed in the form of the original [[Wellington Cable Car]], in the [[New Zealand]] city of [[Wellington]]. This line had both a continuous loop haulage cable that the cars gripped using a cable car gripper, and a balance cable permanently attached to both cars over an undriven pulley at the top of the line. The descending car gripped the haulage cable and was pulled downhill, in turn pulling the ascending car (which remained ungripped) uphill by the balance cable. This line was rebuilt in 1979 and is now a standard funicular, although it retains its old cable car name.

== Cities currently operating cable cars ==
&lt;!-- Please do not add funiculars here--&gt;

=== Traditional cable car systems ===
The best known existing cable car system is the [[San Francisco cable car system]] in the city of [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. San Francisco's cable cars constitute the oldest and largest such system in permanent operation, and it is the only one to still operate in the traditional manner with manually operated cars running in street traffic.

=== Modern cable car systems ===
&lt;!-- Please do not add funiculars here--&gt;
Several cities operate a modern version of the cable car system. These systems are fully automated and run on their own reserved right of way. They are commonly referred to as [[people mover]]s, although that term is also applied to systems with other forms of propulsion, including funicular style cable propulsion.

These cities include:

{{phonation}}

In [[linguistics]], '''creaky voice''' (sometimes called '''laryngealisation''', '''pulse phonation''', '''vocal fry''', or '''glottal fry'''), is a special kind of [[phonation]]&lt;ref&gt;Titze, I. R. (2008). The human instrument. Sci.Am. 298 (1):94-101. PM 18225701&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Titze, I. R. (1994). Principles of Voice Production, Prentice Hall, ISBN 978-0-13-717893-3.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[arytenoid cartilage]]s in the [[larynx]] are drawn together; as a result, the [[vocal folds]] are compressed rather tightly, becoming relatively slack and compact. They vibrate irregularly at 20&amp;ndash;50 pulses per second, about two octaves below the frequency of normal voicing, and the airflow through the [[glottis]] is very slow. However, although creaky voice may occur with very low pitch, as at the end of a long [[intonation unit]], it can occur with any pitch. 

A slight degree of [[laryngealisation]], occurring in some [[Korean language|Korean]] consonants for example, is called &quot;[[stiff voice]]&quot;. The [[Danish language|Danish]] [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] feature ''[[stød]]'' is an example of a form of laryngealisation that has a [[phoneme|phonemic]] function. Creaky voice is also prevalent in English as spoken in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/A-Northwest-dialect-That-s-Goofy-some-say-1174476.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kuow.org/program.php?id=9198&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], creaky voice of a [[Phone (phonetics)|phone]] is represented by a [[diacritic]]al [[tilde]] {{IPA diacritic description|0330|COMBINING TILDE BELOW|,}} for example {{IPA|[d̰]}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:LG L194WT-SF LCD monitor.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A 19-inch, 16:10 wide screen  [[LCD monitor]].]]

A '''monitor''' or '''display''' (sometimes called a '''visual display unit''') is an [[electronic visual display]] for [[computer]]s. The monitor comprises the display device, [[electronic circuit|circuitry]], and an enclosure. The display device in modern monitors is typically a [[thin film transistor liquid crystal display]] (TFT-LCD) thin panel, while older monitors use a cathode ray tube about as deep as the screen size.

The first computer monitors used [[Cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs), which was the dominant technology until they were replaced by [[LCD monitor]]s in the 21st Century.

Originally computer monitors were used for [[data processing]] while [[television receiver]]s were used for entertainment. From the 80s onwards, computers have been used for both data processing and entertainment, while televisions have implemented some computer functionality. The common [[aspect ratio]] of televisions, and then computer monitors, has also changed from 4:3 to 16:9.

{{TOC limit|2}}

==Technologies==
{{See|Comparison CRT, LCD, Plasma}}
Different image techniques have been used for Computer monitors. Until the [[21st century]] most monitors were CRT but they have been phased out for [[LCD monitors]].

===Cathode ray tube===
{{Main|Cathode ray tube}}
[[File:Viewsonic-crt.png|thumb|A CRT monitor.]]
The first computer monitors used [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRT). Until the early 1980s, they were known as video display terminals and were physically attached to the computer and keyboard. The monitors were [[monochrome]], flickered and the image quality was poor. In 1981, IBM  invented the [[Color Graphics Adapter]], which could display four colors with a resolution of 320 by 200 pixels. They introduced the [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter]] in 1984, which was capable of producing 16 colors and had a resolution of 640 by 350.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infodingo.com/electronics/computer-monitors/types-of-computer-monitors/crt/ |title=Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Monitors |publisher=Infodingo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRT remained the standard for computer monitors through the 1990s. CRT technology remained dominant in the PC monitor market into the new millennium partly because it was cheaper to produce and offered viewing angles close to 180 degrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;pctech1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pctechguide.com/crt-monitors |title=CRT Monitors |publisher=PCTechGuide.Com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liquid Crystal ===
{{Main|Liquid crystal display}}
There are multiple technologies that have been used to implement Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs).  Throughout the 1990s the primary use of LCD technology as computer monitors was in laptops where the lower power consumption, lighter weight, and smaller physical size of LCDs justified the higher price verses a CRT.  Commonly, the same laptop would be offered with an assortment of display options at increasing price points (active or passive monochrome, passive color, active matrix color (TFT)).  As volume and manufacturing capability have improved the monochrome and passive color technologies were dropped from most product lines.

TFT is a variant of [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD) which is now the dominant technology used for computer monitors. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/content/panel_technologies_content.htm |title=TFT Central |publisher=TFT Central |date=2011-04-30 |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first standalone LCD displays appeared in the mid 1990s selling for high prices. As prices declined over a period of years they became more popular.  During the 2000's TFT LCDs gradually displaced CRTs, eventually becoming the primary technology used for computer monitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;pctech1&quot;/&gt; The main advantages of LCDs over CRT displays are that LCDs consume less power, take up much less space, and are considerably lighter.  The, now common, active matrix TFT-LCD technology also has less flickering than CRTs, which reduces eye strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infodingo.com/electronics/computer-monitors/types-of-computer-monitors/lcd/why-choose-an-lcd.aspx |title=Is the LCD monitor right for you? |publisher=Infodingo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future ===
[[Organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED) monitors provide higher contrast and better viewing angles than LCDs, and are predicted to replace them. In 2011 a 25 inch OLED monitor costs $6000, but the prices are expected to drop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Agoraquest, LLC - The only place for the Sony Enthusiast |url=http://www.agoraquest.com/article.php?sid=615 |title=Sony’s Outs Two New OLED Monitors |publisher=Agoraquest |date= |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance measurements==
The performance of a monitor is measured by the following parameters:
*[[Luminance]] is measured in candelas per square meter (cd/m2 also called a Nit).
*[[Aspect ratio (image)|Aspect ratios]] is the ratio of the horizontal length to the vertical length. Monitors usually have the aspect ratio [[4:3]], [[16:10]] or [[16:9]].
*[[Viewable image size]] is usually measured diagonally, but the actual widths and heights are more informative since they are not affected by the aspect ratio in the same way. For CRTs, the viewable size is typically {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}} smaller than the tube itself.
*[[Display resolution]] is the number of distinct pixels in each dimension that can be displayed. Maximum resolution is limited by dot pitch.
*[[Dot pitch]] is the distance between subpixels of the same color in millimeters. In general, the smaller the dot pitch, the sharper the picture will appear.
*[[Refresh rate]] is the number of times in a second that a display is illuminated. Maximum refresh rate is limited by response time.
*[[Response time]] is the time a pixel in a monitor takes to go from active (black) to inactive (white) and back to active (black) again, measured in milliseconds. Lower numbers mean faster transitions and therefore fewer visible image artifacts.
*[[Contrast ratio]] is the ratio of the luminosity of the brightest color (white) to that of the darkest color (black) that the monitor is capable of producing.
*[[Power consumption]] is measured in watts.
*[[Viewing angle]] is the maximum angle at which images on the monitor can be viewed, without excessive degradation to the image. It is measured in degrees horizontally and vertically.

===Size===
{{Main|Display size}}
[[File:Diameter-rectangle.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.45|For any rectangular section on a round tube, the diagonal measurement is also the diameter of the tube]]
[[File:Screens png.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|The area, height and width of displays with identical diagonal measurements vary dependent on [[aspect ratio]]]]

On [[two-dimensional display device]]s such as computer monitors the display size or viewable image size is the actual amount of screen space that is available to display a [[picture]], [[video]] or working space, without obstruction from the case or other aspects of the unit's [[design]]. The main measurements for display devices are: width, height, total area and the diagonal. 

The size of a display is usually by monitor manufacturers given by the diagonal i.e. the distance between two opposite screen corners. This method of measurement is inherited from the method used for the first generation of CRT television, when picture tubes with circular faces were in common use. Being circular, only their diameter was needed to describe their size. Since these circular tubes were used to display rectangular images, the diagonal measurement of the rectangle was equivalent to the diameter of the tube's face. This method continued even when cathode ray tubes were manufactured as rounded rectangles; it had the advantage of being a single number specifying the size, and was not confusing when the aspect ratio was universally 4:3.

The estimation of the monitor size by the distance between opposite corners does not take into account the display [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], so that for example a 16:9 {{convert|21|in|cm|abbr=on}} [[widescreen]] display has less [[area]], than a {{convert|21|in|cm|abbr=on}} 4:3 screen. The 4:3 screen has dimensions of {{convert|16.8|×|12.6|in|cm|abbr=on}} and area {{convert|211|sqin|cm2|lk=on|abbr=on}}, while the widescreen is {{convert|18.3|×|10.3|in|cm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|188|sqin|cm2|abbr=on}}.

===Aspect ratio===
{{Main|Display aspect ratio}}
Until about 2003, most computer monitors had a [[4:3]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] and some had [[5:4]]. Between 2003 and 2006, monitors with [[16:9]] and mostly [[16:10]] (8:5) aspect ratios became commonly available, first in [[laptop]]s and later also in standalone monitors. Reasons for this transition was productive uses for such monitors, i.e. besides [[Field of view in video games|widescreen computer game play]] and movie viewing, are the word processor display of two standard letter pages side by side, as well as CAD displays of large-size drawings and CAD application menus at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;NEMATech Computer Display Standards http://www.millertech.com/Technical_Specs.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070315085244/http://www.necdisplay.com/support/css/monitortechguide/index05.htm |archivedate=2007-03-15 |url=http://www.necdisplay.com/support/css/monitortechguide/index05.htm |title=Introduction--Monitor Technology Guide |publisher=necdisplay.com}} (currently offline)&lt;/ref&gt; 2008 16:10 became the most common sold aspect ratio for [[LCD monitor]]s and the same year 16:10 was the mainstream standard for [[laptop]]s and [[notebook]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;displaysearch1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/SID-0A424DE8-28DF6E59/displaysearch/hs.xsl/070108_16by9_PR.asp |title=Product Planners and Marketers Must Act Before 16:9 Panels Replace Mainstream 16:10 Notebook PC and Monitor LCD Panels, New DisplaySearch Topical Report Advises |publisher=DisplaySearch |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the computer industry started to move over from 16:10 to 16:9. According to a report by displaysearch the reasons for this were/are:&lt;ref name=&quot;displaysearch1&quot;/&gt;
* Innovative product concepts drives a new product cycle and stimulating the growth of the notebook PC and LCD monitor market.
* 16:9 provides better economic cut (panelization) in existing TFT LCD fabs.
* 16:9 products provide higher resolution and wider aspect ratio.
* The widespread adoption of [[High-definition video|High Definition]] in the consumer entertainment sector will help end users readily adopt the new products with the wider aspect ratio.
* The 16:9 panels provide an opportunity for PC brands to further diversify their products.

In 2011 Bennie Budler, product manager of IT products at Samsung South Africa, confirmed that monitors capable of 1920&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;1200 resolutions are no longer being manufactured. “It is all about reducing manufacturing costs. The new 16:9 aspect ratio panels are more cost effective to manufacture locally than the previous 16:10 panels”&lt;ref name=&quot;mybroadband1&quot;&gt;http://mybroadband.co.za/news/hardware/17621-Widescreen-monitors-Where-did-1920x1200.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 non-widescreen displays with 4:3 aspect ratios were only being manufactured in small quantities. According to Samsung this was because the “Demand for the old 'Square monitors' has decreased rapidly over the last couple of years,” and “I predict that by the end of 2011, production on all 4:3 or similar panels will be halted due to a lack of demand.”&lt;ref name=&quot;mybroadband1&quot;/&gt;

===Resolution===
{{Main|Display resolution}}
The resolution for computer monitors have increased over time. From 320x200 during the early 80s, to 800x600 during the late 90s. In March 2011 1920x1080 became the most common used resolution among [[Steam (software)|Steam]] users. The earlier most common resolution was 1680x1050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey |title=Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey |publisher=Store.steampowered.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional features==
===Power saving===
Most modern monitors will switch to a power-saving mode if no video-input signal is received. This allows modern operating systems to turn off a monitor after a specified period of inactivity. This also extends the monitor's service life.

Some monitors will also switch themselves off after a time period on standby.

Most modern laptops provide a method of screen dimming after periods of inactivity or when the battery is in use. This extends battery life and reduces wear.

===Integrated accessories===
Many monitors have other accessories (or connections for them) integrated. This places [[Computer port (hardware)|standard ports]] within easy reach and eliminates the need for another separate [[USB hub|hub]], [[Webcam|camera]], [[microphone]], or set of [[Computer speaker|speakers]]. These monitors have advanced microprocessors which contain codec information, Windows Interface drivers and other small software which help in proper functioning of these functions.

===Glossy screen===
{{Main|Glossy display}}

Some displays, especially newer LCD monitors, replace the traditional anti-glare matte finish with a glossy one. This increases [[color saturation]] and sharpness but reflections from lights and windows are very visible.

===Directional screen===
Narrow viewing angle screens are used in some security conscious applications.

===Autostereoscopic (3D) screen===
{{Main|Autostereoscopy}}

A directional screen which generates 3D images without headgear.

===Touch screen===
{{Main|Touchscreen}}

These monitors use touching of the screen as an input method. Items can be selected or moved with a finger, and finger gestures may be used to convey commands. The screen will need frequent cleaning due to image degradation from fingerprints.

===Tablet screens===
{{Main|Graphics tablet/screen hybrid}}

A combination of a monitor with a [[graphics tablet]]. Such devices are typically unresponsive to touch without the use of one or more special tools' pressure. Newer models however are now able to detect touch from any pressure and often have the ability to detect tilt and rotation as well.

Touch and tablet screens are used on LCD displays as a substitute for the light pen, which can only work on CRTs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''ClearType''' is a trademark for [[Microsoft]]'s implementation of [[subpixel rendering]] technology. ClearType attempts to improve the appearance of text on certain types of [[computer display]] screens by sacrificing color fidelity for additional intensity variation. This trade-off is asserted to work well on [[LCD]] [[flat panel]] monitors.

ClearType was first announced at the November 1998 [[COMDEX]] exhibition. The technology was first introduced in software in January 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=1135|title=First ClearType screens posted|publisher=Microsoft Typography|date=2000-01-26|accessdate=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an always-on feature of [[Microsoft Reader]], which was released to the public in August 2000. ClearType was later introduced as an [[operating system]] feature in [[Windows XP]], where it was kept turned off by default. In [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]], ClearType is turned on by default. In [[Microsoft Office 2007]] and further versions, [[Internet Explorer 7]] and further versions and [[Windows Live Messenger]] ClearType is also turned on by default, even if it is not enabled throughout the operating system. ClearType is also an integrated component of the [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] text-rendering engine.

==Background==
Computer displays in which the positions of individual pixels are permanently fixed by the design of the hardware—such as most modern [[flat panel]] displays—can show saw-tooth edges when displaying small, high-contrast graphic elements such as text. ClearType uses [[anti-aliasing]] at the subpixel level to allegedly reduce visible artifacts on such displays when text is rendered, making the text appear &quot;smoother&quot; and less jagged. ClearType also uses very heavy [[font hinting]] to force the font to fit into the pixel grid. This increases edge contrast and readability of small fonts at the expense of font rendering fidelity and has been criticised by graphic designers for making different fonts look similar.

Like most other types of subpixel rendering, ClearType actually involves a compromise, sacrificing one aspect of image quality (color or ''[[chrominance]]'' detail) for another (light and dark or ''[[luminance]]'' detail). The compromise can improve text appearance when luminance detail is more important than chrominance.

ClearType is applied only to text that is rendered as such by user and system applications. Other graphic display elements (including text that has already been converted to [[bitmap]]s) are not altered by ClearType. For example, text in [[Microsoft Office Word|Microsoft Word]] will be rendered on the screen with ClearType enhancement, but text placed in a bitmapped image in a program such as [[Photoshop|Adobe Photoshop]] will not be modified. In theory, the method (called &quot;RGB Decimation&quot; internally) can be applied to enhance the [[antialiasing]] of any digital image.&lt;ref&gt;Betrisey et al., &quot;Displaced Filtering for Patterned Displays&quot;, Proc. Society for Information Display Symposium, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

ClearType is not used when printing text. Most printers already use such small pixels that aliasing is rarely a problem and, in any case, they don't have the addressable fixed subpixels ClearType requires. Nor does ClearType  affect text stored in files. ClearType only applies any processing to the text while it is being rendered onto the screen.

ClearType was invented in the Microsoft e-Books team by Bert Keely and Greg Hitchcock.  It was then analyzed by researchers in the company, and signal processing expert [[John Platt]] designed an improved version of the algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;Platt, J.C., &quot;Optimal Filtering for Patterned Displays&quot;, IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 7(7) 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dick Brass]], a Vice President at Microsoft from 1997&amp;ndash;2004, complained that the company was slow in moving ClearType to market in the portable computing field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/opinion/04brass.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=opinion Microsoft’s Creative Destruction]&lt;/ref&gt;

==How ClearType works==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2008}}
Normally, the software in a computer treats the computer’s display screen as a rectangular array of square, indivisible ''[[pixel]]s,'' each of which has an intensity and color that are determined by the blending of three [[primary color]]s: red, green, and blue. However, actual display hardware usually implements each pixel as a group of three adjacent, independent ''[[subpixel]]s,'' each of which displays a different primary color. Thus, on a real computer display, each pixel is actually composed of separate red, green, and blue subpixels. For example, if a flat-panel display is examined under a magnifying glass, the pixels may appear as follows:

[[Image:27 subpixels.svg|center|Subpixels|thumb]]

In the illustration above, there are nine pixels, but there are 27 subpixels.

If the computer controlling the display knows the exact position and color of all the subpixels on the screen, it can take advantage of this to improve the apparent resolution of the images on the screen in certain situations. If each pixel on the display actually contains three rectangular subpixels of red, green, and blue, in that fixed order, then things on the screen that are smaller than one full pixel in size can be rendered by lighting only one or two of the subpixels. For example, if a diagonal line with a width smaller than a full pixel must be rendered, then this can be done by lighting only the subpixels that the line actually touches. If the line passes through the leftmost portion of the pixel, only the red subpixel is lit; if it passes through the rightmost portion of the pixel, only the blue subpixel is lit. This effectively triples the horizontal resolution of the image at normal viewing distances; but the drawback is that the line thus drawn will show color fringes (at some points it might look green, at other points it might look red or blue).

[[Image:Antialias-vrs-Cromapixel.png|center|frame|1) A diagonal line on a 1-bit display. 2) Grayscale anti-aliasing. 3) Identical to 1, but on a color monitor. 4) Rendered with direct control of each color pixel. 5) Smaller version of 1-4. 6) 1 pixel lines without and with anti-aliasing.]]

ClearType uses this method to improve the smoothness of text. When the elements of a type character are smaller than a full pixel, ClearType lights only the appropriate subpixels of each full pixel in order to more closely follow the outlines of the character. Text rendered with ClearType looks “smoother” than text rendered without it, provided that the pixel layout of the display screen exactly matches what ClearType expects.

The following picture shows a 4× enlargement of the word ''Wikipedia'' rendered using ClearType.
The word was originally rendered using a [[Times New Roman]] 12 [[Point (typography)|pt]] [[typeface|font]].

:[[Image:Wikipedia ClearType.png|center|frame|The word &quot;Wikipedia&quot; rendered using ClearType]]

In this magnified view, it becomes clear that, while the overall smoothness of the text seems to improve, there is also color fringing of the text.

[[Image:ClearTypePixels.svg|thumb|center|283px| (a) text rendered without ClearType and (b) text rendered with ClearType]]

An extreme close-up of a color display shows (a) text rendered without ClearType and (b) text rendered with ClearType. Note the changes in subpixel intensity that are used to increase effective resolution when ClearType is enabled&amp;mdash;without ClearType, all sub-pixels of a given pixel have the same intensity.

[[Image:Cleartype-vs-Standard-Antialiasing.gif|center| (a) text rendered without ClearType and (b) text rendered with ClearType]]

The above shows an animation with some lines of text. In the frame with the orange circle present, the text is rendered using Cleartype (RGB subpixel rendering), and in the one without it, the text is rendered using normal (full pixel greyscale) antialiasing.

==ClearType and human vision==
ClearType and similar technologies work on the theory that variations in intensity are more noticeable than variations in color. Thus, when ClearType sacrifices color accuracy in order to increase luminance detail, the overall effect—as seen by human eyes—should be an improvement for most people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

According to [[MSDN]] website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa970267.aspx Windows Presentation Foundation ClearType Registry Settings]&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft acknowledges that &quot;[t]ext that is rendered with ClearType can also appear significantly different when viewed by individuals with varying levels of color sensitivity. Some individuals can detect slight differences in color better than others.&quot;

This opinion is shared&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.typophile.com/node/33005#comment-197028 |title=ClearType, in XP and Vista |publisher=Typophile |date= |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the font designer [[Thomas Phinney]], program manager for fonts and core technologies at [[Adobe Systems]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfonts.com/person/phinney/thomas/ |title=Thomas Phinney |publisher=MyFonts |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;There is also considerable variation between individuals in their sensitivity to color fringing. Some people just notice it and are bothered by it a lot more than others.&quot;

The hinting expert [[Beat Stamm]], who worked on ClearType at Microsoft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfonts.com/person/stamm/beat/ |title=Beat Stamm |publisher=MyFonts |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; agrees that ClearType may look blurry at [[Dots per inch#96 DPI as the Windows Standard|96 dpi]], which was a typical&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.zdnet.com/definition/Dpi.html |title=Dpi: Definition and additional resources from ZDNet |publisher=Dictionary.zdnet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; resolution for [[LCD]]s in 2008, but adds that higher resolution displays improve on this aspect:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.typophile.com/node/33005#comment-197660 |title=ClearType, in XP and Vista |publisher=Typophile |date= |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people are ok with the blur in Method C, some aren’t. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some people are fine with Method C when reading continuous text at 96 dpi (e.g. Times Reader, etc.) but not in UI scenarios.

[[Image:FontSmoothingExample.gif|center| Text without rendering (upper portion) and text with ClearType rendering (lower portion)]]

The above image demonstrates the same portion of text without and with ClearType rendering (as opposed to Standard and ClearType in the previous image).  This and the previous image demonstrate the blurring introduced.  For many observers this blurring is beneficial.  Some observers, however, do not find the use of ClearType beneficial.  According to a study at the University of Texas&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~ct/chi_p618.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, ClearType &quot;may not be universally beneficial&quot;.  The study notes that maximum benefit may be seen when the information worker is spending large proportions of their time reading text (which is not necessarily the case for the majority of computer users today).  Additionally, over one third of the study participants experienced some disadvantage when using ClearType.  Whether ClearType, or other rendering, should be used is very subjective and it must be the choice of the individual, with the report recommending &quot;to allow users to disable [ClearType] if they find it produces effects other than improved performance&quot;.

==Display requirements==
ClearType and allied technologies require display hardware with fixed pixels and subpixels. More precisely, the positions of the pixels and subpixels on the screen must be exactly known to the computer to which it is connected. This is the case for flat-panel displays, on which the positions of the pixels are permanently fixed by the design of the screen itself. Almost all flat panels have a perfectly rectangular array of square pixels, each of which contains three rectangular subpixels in the three primary colors, with the normal ordering being red, green, and blue, arranged in vertical bands. ClearType assumes this arrangement of pixels when rendering text.

ClearType does not work properly with flat-panel displays that are operated at resolutions other than their “native” resolutions, since only the native resolution corresponds exactly to the actual positions of pixels on the screen of the display.

If a display does not have the type of fixed pixels that ClearType expects, text rendered with ClearType enabled actually looks worse than type rendered without it. Some flat panels have unusual pixel arrangements, with the colors in a different order, or with the subpixels positioned differently (in three horizontal bands, or in other ways). ClearType needs to be manually tuned for use with such displays (see below).

Displays that have no fixed pixel positions, such as [[shadow mask]] [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays, may be harder to read if ClearType is enabled. However, on CRT displays with a similar pixel arrangement as flat-panel displays, such as [[aperture grille]] and [[Trinitron]] CRT displays, it can also result in a slightly improved readability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ClearType FAQ|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartypefaq.mspx|publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensitivity to display orientation==
Because ClearType utilizes the physical layout of the red, green and blue [[pigments]] of the LCD screen, it is sensitive to the orientation of the display.

ClearType in [[Windows XP]] currently supports the [[RGB]] and [[BGR color model|BGR]] sub pixel structures. Rotated displays, in which the subpixels are arranged vertically rather than horizontally, are ''not'' currently supported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brandonfurtwangler.com/?p=54 brandon.furtwangler blog » Blog Archive » Tablets and cleartype, and a requested feature of Avalon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Using ClearType on these display configurations will actually reduce the display quality. The best option for users of Windows XP having rotated LCD displays ([[Tablet PC]]s or swivel-stand LCD displays) is using regular anti-aliasing, or switching off font-smoothing altogether.

The software developer documentation for [[Windows CE]] states that ClearType for rotated screens is supported on that platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms901093.aspx Working with ClearType Fonts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertical sub pixel structures are not supported in Windows XP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brandonfurtwangler.com/?p=54 Tablets and cleartype, and a requested feature of Avalon at Brandon Furtwangler blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==ClearType in GDI==
ClearType can be globally enabled or disabled for [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI]] applications. A control panel applet is available to let the users tune the GDI ClearType settings. The GDI implementation of ClearType does not support sub-pixel positioning&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms749295.aspx Windows Presentation Foundation ClearType Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===ClearType tuning===
[[Microsoft Windows]], out of the box, only allows ClearType to be turned on or off. However, there are other parameters that can be set via a ClearType tuner utility that Microsoft makes available as a free download from its site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypePowerToy.mspx | title = Microsoft's ClearType Tuner PowerToy | accessdate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool can also be used for tuning [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]] ClearType settings, on Windows 7 it comes preinstalled and is located inside ''Control Panel\Appearance and Personalization\Display\Adjust ClearType text''. Switching off ClearType disables ClearType completely, as expected, unless the application uses its own ClearType controls, separate from the OS level ones.

The tuner has wizard and advanced modes that adjust the same parameters visually or by direct selection:
#Cleartype on/off
#[[RGB]] or [[RGB color model|BGR]] sub pixel structure, though BGR is quite rare, so the default works for most monitors
#Contrast

[[Microsoft Reader]] has a similar ClearType tuner that only affects that program.

==ClearType in WPF==
All text in [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] is anti-aliased and rendered using ClearType. There are separate ClearType registry settings for GDI and WPF applications, but by default the WPF entries are absent, and the GDI values are used in their absence. WPF registry entries can be tuned using the instructions&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/text/archive/2006/10/18/tips-for-improving-your-wpf-text-rendering-experience.aspx Tips for improving your WPF text rendering experience]&lt;/ref&gt; from the MSDN WPF Text Blog.

ClearType in WPF supports sub-pixel positioning, natural advance widths, Y-direction anti-aliasing and [[hardware acceleration]]. However, due to the [[resolution independence|resolution-independent]] architecture of WPF, ClearType cannot be optionally turned off in WPF applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=791660&amp;SiteID=1 WPF ClearType anti-aliasing cannot be turned off]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=August 2008}} WPF supports aggressive caching of pre-rendered ClearType text in [[video memory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms749295.aspx MSDN Library : .NET Development : WPF : ClearType Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which this is supported is dependent on the [[video card]]. [[DirectX]] 10 cards will be able to cache the font glyphs in [[video memory]], then perform the composition (assembling of character glyphs in the correct order, with the correct spacing), [[alpha blending]] (application of anti-aliasing), and RGB blending (ClearType's sub-pixel color calculations), entirely in hardware. This means that only the original glyphs need to be stored in video memory once per font (Microsoft estimates that this would require 2 MB of video memory per font), and other operations such as the display of anti-aliased text on top of other graphics &amp;mdash; including video &amp;mdash; can also be done with no computation effort on the part of the CPU. DirectX 9 cards will only be able to cache the alpha-blended glyphs in memory, thus requiring the CPU to handle glyph composition and alpha-blending before passing this to the video card.  Caching these partially-rendered glyphs requires significantly more memory (Microsoft estimates 5 MB per process). Cards that don't support DirectX 9 have no hardware-accelerated text rendering capabilities.

==ClearType in DirectWrite==
The font rendering engine in [[DirectWrite]] supports rendering to sub-pixel positions, as demonstrated at [[Professional Developers Conference|PDC]] 2008.&lt;ref name=DirectWrite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC18|title=PC18: Introducing Direct2D and DirectWrite|author=Kam VedBrat, Leonardo Blanco|publisher=Microsoft|date=2008-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ciliogenesis==
{{Unreferenced section|September 2010|date=September 2010}}
In organisms with [[flagella]] and [[cilia]], the position of these organelles is determined by the mother centriole, which becomes the [[basal body]].   An inability of cells to use centrioles to make functional cilia and flagella has been linked to a number of genetic and developmental diseases. In particular, the inability of centrioles to properly migrate prior to ciliary assembly has recently been linked to [[Meckel-Gruber syndrome]].

==Animal development==
Proper orientation of cilia via centriole positioning toward the posterior of embryonic node cells is critical for establishing left–right asymmetry during mammalian development.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Centriole duplication==
Cells in [[G0 phase|G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[G1 phase|G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] usually contain two complete centrioles. The older of the two centrioles in a pair is termed the ''mother centriole'', whereas the younger is termed the ''daughter centriole''. During the [[Cell cycle|cell division cycle]], a new centriole grows from the side of each of the existing &quot;mother&quot; centrioles. After centriole duplication, the two pairs of centrioles remain attached to each other in an [[orthogonal]] configuration until [[mitosis]], when the mother and daughter centrioles separate in a manner dependent upon the [[enzyme]] [[separase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=16862117|year=2006|last1=Tsou|first1=MF|last2=Stearns|first2=T|title=Mechanism limiting centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle|volume=442|issue=7105|pages=947–51|doi=10.1038/nature04985|journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two centrioles in the centrosome are connected to each other by unidentified proteins. The mother centriole has  radiating appendages at the [[distal]] end of its long axis and is attached to the daughter centriole at the other [[proximal]] end. Each daughter cell formed after cell division will inherit one of these pairs (one older and one newer centriole). Duplication of centrioles starts at the time of the [[G1/S transition|G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/S transition]] and ends before the onset of [[mitosis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Salisbury&quot; /&gt;

==Origin==
The last common ancestor of all [[eukaryote]]s was a [[cilia]]ted cell with centrioles. Some lineages of eukaryotes do not have centrioles anymore, for example [[land plants]]. It is unclear if the last common ancestor had one&lt;ref name=&quot;Bornens07&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1007/978-0-387-74021-8_10}}&lt;/ref&gt; or two cilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1093/gbe/evp011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important genes required for centriole duplication, like [[centrins]], are only found in eukaryotes and neither in [[prokaryotes]] or [[archea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bornens07&quot;/&gt;

'''Creation Science''' or '''scientific creationism''' is a branch of [[creationism]], which attempts to provide scientific support for the [[Genesis creation narrative]] in the [[Book of Genesis]] and disprove generally accepted [[fact#Fact in science|scientific facts]], [[Scientific theory|theories]] and [[Paradigm|scientific paradigms]] about the history of the [[Earth]], [[cosmology]] and biological [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Plavcan |first= J.

Proponents of creation science claim that it is a genuine scientific challenge to [[historical geology]], the antiquity of the universe, and the theory of evolution.

The [[scientific community]] states that Creation Science is a religious, not a scientific view, and that Creation science does not qualify as science because it lacks [[empirical]] support, supplies no tentative [[Hypothesis#Scientific hypothesis|hypotheses]], and resolves to describe natural history in terms of scientifically untestable [[Supernatural#Naturalization vs. supernaturalization|supernatural]] causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences,  2nd edition | author = [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Science]] | publisher = National Academy Press | year = 1999 | url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=6024 | pages = 48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amicus&gt;{{wayback|url:http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard/amicus1.html|title=Amicus Curiae Brief Of 72 Nobel Laureates, 17 State Academies Of Science, And 7 Other Scientific Organizations}}, ''[[Edwards v.

The earliest creation science texts and curricula focused upon concepts derived from a [[Biblical literalism|literal interpretation of the Bible]] and were overtly religious in nature, most notably linking [[Noah's flood]] in the Biblical Genesis account to the geological and [[fossil record]] in a system termed &quot;[[flood geology]]&quot;. These works attracted little notice beyond the schools and congregations of conservative fundamental and [[Evangelical Christianity|evangelical]] Christians until the 1970s when its followers [[Creation–evolution controversy|challenged the teaching of evolution]] in the public schools and other venues in the United States, bringing it to the attention of the public-at-large and the [[scientific community]]. Many school boards and lawmakers were persuaded to include the teaching of creation science alongside [[Darwinian evolution]] in the science curriculum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Numbers2002&quot;/&gt; Creation science texts and curricula used in churches and Christian schools were revised to eliminate their Biblical and [[theology|theological]] references, and less explicitly sectarian versions of creation science education were introduced in public schools in [[Louisiana]], [[Arkansas]], and other regions in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Numbers2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Numbers, R.L. | year = 2002 | title = 21 Creationism since 1859 | journal = Science and Religion: A Historical Introduction | url = http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;id=weOOCfiDhDcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA277&amp;dq=Creationism+since+1859&amp;ots=ENWRYp2fdQ&amp;sig=CqhbBD3RyigyikOsnstZMTJ4kg4  | accessdate = 2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toumey | first = Christopher P. | title = God's Own Scientists: Creationists in a Secular World | publisher = Rutgers University Press | date = 1997-04-01 | location = New Brunswick, New Jersey | pages = 38 | isbn = 978-0813520445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1982 ruling in ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' found that creation science fails to meet the essential characteristics of science and that its chief intent is to advance a particular religious view.&lt;ref name=&quot;larson2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Larson |first=Edward J. |title=Trial and Error: The American Controversy over Evolution |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |pages=288 |isbn=0195154711}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teaching of creation science in public schools in the United States effectively ended in 1987 following the [[United States Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;larson&quot;/&gt; The court affirmed that a statute requiring the teaching of creation science alongside evolution when evolution is taught in Louisiana public schools was [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] because its sole true purpose was to [[Lemon v. Kurtzman#Lemon test|advance a particular religious belief]].&lt;ref name = &quot;larson2&quot;/&gt;

==Beliefs and activities==
===Religious basis===
Creation science is based largely upon chapters 1-11 of the book of Genesis. These describe how God (Hebrew [[Elohim]]) calls the world into existence through the power of speech (&quot;God said, 'Let there be light',&quot; etc) in six days, calls all the animals and plants into existence, and molds the first man from clay and the first woman from a rib taken from the man's side; a world-wide flood destroys all life except for [[Noah's ark|Noah]] and his family and representatives of the animals, and Noah becomes the ancestor of the 70 &quot;nations&quot; of the world; the nations live together and speak one language until the incident of the [[Tower of Babel]], when God disperses them and gives them their different languages. Creation science rarely goes beyond these stories, but the bible also contains a complex internal chronology which places the initial act of creation some six thousand years ago, and creation science therefore frequently attempts to explain history and science within this timeframe.

===Modern religious affiliations===
Most creation science proponents hold fundamentalist or evangelical Christian beliefs in [[biblical literalism]] or [[biblical inerrancy]], as opposed to [[the higher criticism]] supported by [[Liberal Christianity]] in the [[Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy]]. However, there are also examples of [[Islamic creationism|Islamic]] and [[Jewish views on evolution|Jewish]] scientific creationism that conform to the accounts of creation as recorded in their religious doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamic Scientific Creationism: A New Challenge in Turkey |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/19/6/islamic-scientific-creationism |coauthors=Ümit Sayin and Aykut Kence |year=1999 |publisher=National Center for Science Education }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Eugene|last=Scott|authorlink=Eugene Scott|url=http://ncse.com/creationism/general/antievolutionism-creationism-united-states|title=Antievolutionism and Creationism in the United States|publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]]|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] has a history of support for Creation Science. This dates back to [[George McCready Price]], an active Seventh-day Adventist who developed views of [[flood geology]],&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) pp 88-119&lt;/ref&gt; which formed the basis of Creation Science.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p 268&lt;/ref&gt; This work was continued by the [[Geoscience Research Institute]], an official institute of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, located on its [[Loma Linda University]] campus in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grisda.org/about.htm GRI 'About Us' page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) pp 320-328&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on science===
Creation science rejects evolution's theory of the [[common descent]] of all living things on the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026809 creationism].&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 20 Oct. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it asserts that the field of [[evolutionary biology]] is itself [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v20/i2/superstition.asp Antidote to superstition], [[Answers in Genesis]]&lt;/ref&gt; or even a [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/wright-v-hisd1.html Wright v. Houston I.S.D.]&lt;/ref&gt; Creation scientists argue instead for a system called baraminology, which considers the living world to be descended from uniquely created kinds or ''baramins''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/faq/kinds.asp Get Answers: Created Kinds (Baraminology)], Answers in Genesis&lt;/ref&gt;

Creation science incorporates the concept of [[catastrophism]] to account for Earth's geological formations. Creation scientists employ the concept to attempt to reconcile current landforms and fossil distributions with Biblical interpretations, proposing the remains resulted from successive cataclysmic events, such as a world wide flood and subsequent [[ice age]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/Home/Area/AnswersBook/iceage16.asp What About The Ice Age?]&lt;/ref&gt; It rejects one of the [[Geology#Relative dating|fundamental principles of modern geology]] (and of modern science generally): [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], which means applying the same physical and geological laws observed on the Earth today to interpret the Earth's geological history.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences, 2nd edition&quot;, Steering Committee on Science and Creationism, National Academy of Sciences, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes creation scientists attack other scientific concepts, like the [[Big Bang]] cosmological model or methods of scientific dating which measure [[Geochronology#Radiometric dating|radioactive decay]]. The [[Young Earth Creationist]] branch of the creation scientists also rejects current estimates of the [[age of the Universe]] and the [[age of the Earth]], arguing for creationist cosmologies with timescales much shorter than those determined by modern [[physical cosmology]] and [[Geological history of Earth|geological science]], typically less than 10,000 years. (See [[Objections to evolution#Evolution's evidence is unreliable or inconsistent|The objection that evolution's evidence is unreliable or inconsistent]] and [[RATE]] for details of the rejection.)

One young earth creationist concept proposed by [[Russell Humphreys|D. Russell Humphreys]], called &quot;[[white hole]] cosmology&quot;, proposes that while the Earth has been in existence for only several thousand years, the universe has been in existence for billions of years even while God created them at the same time. The difference in time frames is explained as being due to the effects of relativity within a short span of time on Earth after the Earth's creation. This model places the Earth at or near the center of the Universe and inside a kind of white hole at the time it was created. This idea has been endorsed by the [[Institute for Creation Research]] and Answers in Genesis, but has been criticised by the scientific community for: failing to explain why that white hole no longer exists; badly mangling the standard [[general relativity]] treatment of [[gravitational time dilation]] (which would require a [[black hole]], not a white hole for time to pass more rapidly far away from the Earth).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/astronomy/bigbang.html#humphreys Evidence for the Big Bang], Björn Feuerbacher and Ryan Scranton, [[TalkOrigins Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific community has overwhelmingly rejected the ideas put forth in creation science as lying outside the boundaries of a legitimate science.&lt;ref name = &quot;NAS&quot;&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/html/creationism/introduction.html National Academy of Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Larson| last = Edward J.

The foundational premises underlying scientific creationism disqualify it as a science because the answers to all inquiry therein are preordained to conform to Bible [[doctrine]], and because that inquiry is constructed upon theories which are not [[empiricism|empirically testable]] in nature. Scientists also deem creation science's attacks against biological evolution to be without scientific merit. Those views of the scientific community were accepted in two significant court decisions in the 1980s which found the field of creation science to be a religious mode of inquiry, not a scientific one.

==History==
{{main|History of creationism}}
The teaching of evolution was gradually introduced into more and more public high school textbooks in the United States after 1900,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Skoog |first=Gerald |authorlink= |year= 1979 |month=April |title= Topic of evolution in secondary school biology textbooks: 1900–1977 |journal= Science Education (1979 Wiley Periodicals) |volume= 63 |issue=5 |pages=621–640}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the aftermath of the [[First World War]] the growth of [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christianity]] gave rise to a [[creationism|creationist]] opposition to such teaching. Legislation prohibiting the teaching of evolution was passed in certain regions, most notably Tennessee's [[Butler Act]] of 1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;evc&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Scott

In 1958 the United States passed [[National Defense Education Act]] which introduced new education guidelines for science instruction. With federal grant funding, the [[Biological Sciences Curriculum Study]] (BSCS) drafted new standards for the public schools' science textbooks which included the teaching of evolution. Almost half the nation's high schools were using textbooks based on the guidelines of the BSCS soon after they were published in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=GQ3TI5njXfIC&amp;pg=PA265 265]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tennessee legislature did not repeal the Butler Act until 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/tennstat.htm Tennessee Evolution Statutes], Chapter No. 27, House Bill No. 185 (1925) and Chapter No. 237, House Bill No. 46 (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

Creation science (dubbed '''Scientific Creationism''' at the time) emerged as an organized movement during the 1960s. It was strongly influenced by the earlier work of Canadian armchair [[geologist]] and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] [[George McCready Price]] who wrote works such as ''The New Geology'' to advance what he termed &quot;new catastrophism&quot; and dispute the current geological time frames and explanations of [[geologic history]]. Price's work was cited at the [[Scopes Trial]] of 1925, yet although he frequently solicited feedback from geologists and other scientists, they consistently disparaged his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=[http://books.google.com/books?id=GQ3TI5njXfIC&amp;pg=PA88 88–119]}} In one of his many correspondences with Price, [[David Starr Jordan]] of Stanford University, who was then the United States' foremost authority on fish fossils, explained to Price his flawed works were &quot;based on scattering mistakes, omissions, and exceptions against general truths that anybody familiar with the facts in a general way can not possibly dispute.&quot; p106&lt;/ref&gt; Price's &quot;new catastrophism&quot; also went largely unnoticed by other creationists until its revival with the 1961 publication of ''[[The Genesis Flood]]'' by [[Henry M. Morris]] and [[John C. Whitcomb]], a work which quickly became an important text on the issue to fundamentalist Christians&lt;ref name=&quot;larson&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--location 3236 kindle ed--&gt; and expanded the field of creation science beyond critiques of geology into [[biology]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] as well. Soon after its publication, a movement was underway to have the subject taught in United States' public schools.

===Court determinations===
The various state laws prohibiting teaching of evolution were overturned in 1968 when the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' such laws were [[Constitution|unconstitutional]]. This inspired a new creationist movement to promote laws requiring that schools give balanced treatment to creation science when evolution is taught. The 1981 Arkansas Act 590 was one such law that carefully detailed the principles of creation science that were to receive equal time in public schools alongside evolutionary principles.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ266199&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=EJ266199 Act 590 of 1981--General Acts, 73rd General Assembly, State of Arkansas].'' Abstract available at ERIC.&lt;/ref&gt; The act defined creation science as follows:

&quot;Creation science means the scientific evidences for creation and inferences from those evidences. Creation science includes the scientific evidences and related inferences that indicate:
:#Sudden creation of the Universe, energy and life from nothing.
:#The insufficiency of mutation and natural selection in bringing about development of all living kinds from a single organism.
:#Changes only with fixed limits of originally created kinds of plants and animals.
:#Separate ancestry for man and apes.
:#Explanation of the Earth's geology by catastrophism, including the occurrence of worldwide flood.
:#A relatively recent inception of the Earth and living kinds.&quot;

This legislation was examined in ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'', and the ruling handed down on January 5, 1982, concluded that creation-science as defined in the act &quot;is simply not science&quot;. The judgement defined the following as essential characteristics of science:
:#It is guided by natural law;
:#It has to be explanatory by reference to nature law;
:#It is testable against the empirical world;
:#Its conclusions are tentative, i.e. are not necessarily the final word; and
:#It is falsifiable.

The court ruled that creation science failed to meet these essential characteristics and identified specific reasons. After examining the key concepts from creation science, the court found:
:#Sudden creation &quot;from nothing&quot; calls upon a supernatural intervention, not natural law, and is neither testable nor falsifiable
:#Objections in creation science that mutation and natural selection are insufficient to explain common origins was an incomplete negative generalization
:#'Kinds' are not scientific classifications, and creation science's claims of an outer limit to the evolutionary change possible of species are not explained scientifically or by natural law
:#Separate ancestry of man and apes is an assertion rather than scientific explanation, and did not derive from any scientific fact or theory
:#Catastrophism, including its identification of the worldwide flood, failed as a science
:#&quot;Relatively recent inception&quot; was the product of religious readings and had no scientific meaning, and was neither the product of, nor explainable by, natural law; nor is it tentative

The court further noted that no recognized [[Science journal|scientific journal]] had published any article espousing the creation science theory as described in the Arkansas law, and stated that the testimony presented by defense attributing the absence to censorship was not credible.

In its ruling, the court wrote that for any theory to qualify as scientific, the theory must be tentative, and open to revision or abandonment as new facts come to light. It wrote that any methodology which begins with an immutable conclusion which cannot be revised or rejected, regardless of the evidence, is not a scientific theory. The court found that creation science does not culminate in conclusions formed from scientific inquiry, but instead begins with the conclusion, one taken from a literal wording of the Book of Genesis, and seeks only scientific evidence to support it.

The law in Arkansas adopted the same two-model approach as that put forward by the [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR), one allowing only two possible explanations for the origins of life and existence of man, plants and animals: it was either the work of a creator or it was not. Scientific evidence that failed to support the theory of evolution was posed as necessarily scientific evidence in support of creationism, but in its judgment the court ruled this approach to be no more than a &quot;[[False dilemma|contrived dualism]] which has not scientific factual basis or legitimate educational purpose.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Decision by U.S. District Court Judge William R. Overton, ''McLean v Arkansas'', sec IV(A), copy available [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html Talkorigins Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge concluded that &quot;Act 590 is a religious crusade, coupled with a desire to conceal this fact&quot;, and that it violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s [[Establishment Clause]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision was not appealed to a [[United States federal courts|higher court]], but had a powerful influence on subsequent rulings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/intelligent-design.pdf Understanding the Intelligent Design Creationist Movement: Its True Nature and Goals.] A Position Paper from the Center for Inquiry, Office of Public Policy Barbara Forrest.

Keith]] of [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], judged in the 1987 United States Supreme Court case ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'', and was handed a similar ruling. It found the law to require the balanced teaching of creation science with evolution had a particular religious purpose and was therefore unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

===Intelligent Design splits off===
In 1984, ''The Mystery of Life's Origin'' was first published. It was co-authored by [[chemist]] and creationist [[Charles B. Thaxton]] with Walter L. Bradley and Roger L. Olsen, the foreword written by [[Dean H. Kenyon]], and sponsored by the Christian based [[Foundation for Thought and Ethics]] (FTE). The work presented scientific arguments against current theories of [[abiogenesis]] and offered an hypothesis of [[special creation]] instead. While the focus of creation science had until that time centered primarily on the criticism of the [[fossil]] evidence for evolution and validation of the [[creation myth]] of the [[Bible]], this new work posed the question whether science reveals that even the simplest living systems were far too complex to have developed by natural, unguided processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=[http://books.google.com/books?id=GQ3TI5njXfIC&amp;pg=PA178 178], [http://books.google.com/books?id=GQ3TI5njXfIC&amp;pg=PA218 218], [http://books.google.com/books?id=GQ3TI5njXfIC&amp;pg=PA373 373], [http://books.google.com/books?id=GQ3TI5njXfIC&amp;pg=PA383 383]}}

Kenyon later co-wrote with creationist [[Percival Davis]] a book intended as a &quot;scientific brief for creationism&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=GQ3TI5njXfIC&amp;pg=PA375 375]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to use as a supplement to public high school biology textbooks. Thaxton was enlisted as the book's editor, and the book received publishing support from the FTE. Prior to its release, the 1987 Supreme Court ruling in ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' barred the teaching of creation science and creationism in public school classrooms. The book, originally titled ''Biology and Creation'' but renamed ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'', was released in 1989 and became the first published work to promote the anti-evolutionist design argument under the name [[intelligent design]]. The contents of the book later became a focus of evidence in the federal court case, ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', when parents filed suit to halt the teaching of intelligent design in [[Dover, Pennsylvania]] public schools. School board officials there had attempted to include ''Of Pandas and People'' in their biology classrooms and testimony given during the trial revealed the book was originally written as a creationist text but following the adverse decision in the Supreme court it underwent simple cosmetic editing to remove the explicit allusions to &quot;creation&quot; or &quot;creator&quot;, and replace them instead with references to &quot;design&quot; or &quot;designer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;numbers&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid 1990s, [[Intelligent design]] had become a separate movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;numbers&quot;/&gt; The creation science movement is distinguished from the [[intelligent design movement]], or [[neo-creationism]], because most advocates of creation science accept scripture as a literal and inerrant historical account, and their primary goal is to corroborate the scriptural account through the use of science. In contrast, as a matter of principle, neo-creationism eschews references to scripture altogether in its [[polemics]] and stated goals (see [[Wedge strategy]]). By so doing, intelligent design proponents have attempted to succeed where creation science has failed in securing a place in public school science curricula. Carefully avoiding any reference to the identity of the [[intelligent designer]] as God in their public arguments, intelligent design proponents sought to reintroduce the creationist ideas into science classrooms while sidestepping the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s prohibition against religious infringement.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson_bible_out&quot;&gt;&quot;...the first thing that has to be done is to get the Bible out of the discussion. ...This is not to say that the biblical issues are unimportant; the point is rather that the time to address them will be after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific fact.&quot; Phillip Johnson. &quot;The Wedge&quot;, Touchstone: A Journal of Mere Christianity. July/August 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;debate_won&quot;&gt;[http://www.coralridge.org/specialdocs/evolutiondebate.asp the Evolution Debate Can Be Won.] Phillip Johnson. Truths that Transform.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the intelligent design curriculum was struck down as a violation of the Establishment Clause in ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', the judge in the case ruling &quot;that ID is nothing less than the progeny of creationism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;wikisource [[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context#Page 31 of 139|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context Page 31 of 139]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, creation science as an organized movement is primarily centered within the [[United States]]. However, creation science organizations are known in other countries, most notably [[Creation Ministries International]] which was founded (under the name Creation Science Foundation) in [[Australia]]. Proponents are usually aligned with a [[Christianity|Christian]] denomination, primarily with those characterized as [[evangelicalism|evangelical]], conservative, or [[fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]]. While creationist movements also exist in [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]], these movements do not use the phrase ''creation science'' to describe their beliefs.

==Issues==
Creation science has its roots in the work of young-earth creationist [[George McCready Price]] disputing [[science|modern science]]'s account of [[natural history]], focusing particularly on [[geology]] and its concept of [[uniformitarianism]], and his efforts instead to furnish an alternative empirical explanation of observable phenomena which was compatible with strict [[Biblical literalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=[http://books.google.com/books?id=GQ3TI5njXfIC&amp;pg=PA107 107–111]}}, chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; Price's work was later discovered by civil engineer and [[Gideons International|Gideon]] [[Henry M. Morris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|2006|[http://books.google.com/books?id=GQ3TI5njXfIC&amp;pg=PA217 217-219]}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is now considered to be the father of creation science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Scott |first= Eugenie C. |editor= Andrew J.

Scott |title=Evolution vs. creationism |year=2004 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California |isbn=0520246500 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proponents of creation science often say that they are concerned with religious and moral questions as well as natural observations and predictive hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.originsresource.org/creationsci.htm How can creation have anything to do with science?], Origins Research Center.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creationism.org/heinze/Universe.htm How The Universe Began], Thomas F. Heinze&lt;/ref&gt; Many state that their opposition against scientific evolution is primarily based on religion.

The overwhelming majority of scientists are in agreement that the claims of science are necessarily limited to those that develop from natural observations and experiments which can be replicated and substantiated by other scientists, and that claims made by creation science do not meet those criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/html/creationism/introduction.html &quot;Introduction&quot;, ''Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duane Gish]], a prominent creation science proponent, has similarly claimed, &quot;We do not know how the [[God|Creator]]{{sic}} created, what processes He used, for He used processes which are not now operating anywhere in the natural universe. This is why we refer to creation as special creation. We cannot discover by scientific investigation anything about the creative processes used by the [[God|Creator]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DG&quot;&gt;&quot;Where Is the Science in Creation Science?&quot;, Roger Lewin in ''Science'', vol.215, 8 January 1982, pp.142–146,  [http://people.hofstra.edu/faculty/robert_l_hall/ISB1F01/ScienceInCreationScience.html Copy used in class lesson]; {{wayback|http://people.hofstra.edu/faculty/robert_l_hall/ISB1F01/ScienceInCreationScience.html}}; Lewin attributes Duane Gish's quote to, '' Evolution: the Fossils Say No!''; Lewin attributes Gish's claim that scientific evolution is equally religious to Gish's letter to '''Discover''' magazine, published July 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; But Gish also makes the same claim against science's evolutionary theory, maintaining that on the subject of origins, scientific evolution is a religious theory which cannot be validated by science.&lt;ref name=&quot;DG&quot;/&gt;

===Metaphysical assumptions===
Creation science makes the [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|''a priori'']] metaphysical assumption that there exists a creator of the life whose origin is being examined. Christian creation science holds that the description of creation is given in the Bible and that empirical scientific evidence corresponds with that description. Creation scientists also view the preclusion of all supernatural explanations within the sciences as a doctrinaire commitment to exclude the supreme being and miracles. They claim this to be the motivating factor in science's acceptance of [[Darwinism]], a term used in creation science to refer to [[evolutionary biology]] which is also often used as a disparagement. Critics consider creation science to be religious rather than scientific because it stems from [[faith]] in a religious text rather than by the application of the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html talkorigins.org Mclean-v-Arkansas]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) has noted, &quot;Religious opposition to evolution propels antievolutionism. Although antievolutionists pay lip service to supposed scientific problems with evolution, what motivates them to battle its teaching is apprehension over the implications of evolution for religion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/creationism/general/antievolutionism-creationism-united-states Antievolutionism and Creationism in the United States] [[National Center for Science Education]], February 13th, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Creation science advocates argue that [[scientific theories]] of the origins of the [[universe]], Earth, and [[Origin of life|life]] are rooted in ''a priori'' presumptions of [[Methodology|methodological]] [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], each of which is disputed. In some areas of science such as [[chemistry]], [[meteorology]] or [[medicine]], creation science proponents do not challenge the application of naturalistic or uniformitarian assumptions. Traditionally, creation science advocates have singled out those scientific theories judged to be in conflict with held religious beliefs, and it is against those theories that they concentrate their efforts.

===Religious criticism===
Mainstream Christian churches criticize creation science on theological grounds, asserting either that religious faith alone should be a sufficient basis for belief in the truth of creation, or that efforts to prove the Genesis account of creation on scientific grounds are inherently futile because reason is subordinate to faith and cannot thus be used to prove it.

Many [[Christian theology|Christian theologies]], including [[Liberal Christianity]], consider the [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis creation myth]] to be a [[poetry|poetic]] and [[allegory|allegorical]] work rather than a literal history, and many Christian churches&amp;nbsp;– including the [[Roman Catholic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/media/voices/roman-catholic-church-1996 Roman Catholic Church (1996)] National Center for Science Education&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anglican]] and the more liberal denominations of the [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] and [[Presbyterian]] faiths&amp;nbsp;– have either rejected creation science outright or are ambivalent to it.

[[Theistic evolution]] and evolutionary creationism are theologies that reconcile belief in a creator with biological evolution. Each holds the view that there is a creator but that this creator has employed the natural force of evolution to unfold a divine plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/creationism/general/creationevolution-continuum |title=The Creation/Evolution Continuum |publisher=National Center for Science Education |last=Scott |first=Eugenie C. |publication-date=2000-12-07 |accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious representatives from faiths compatible with theistic evolution and evolutionary creationism have challenged the growing perception that belief in a creator is inconsistent with the acceptance of evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncccusa.org/news/060330evolution.html Teaching Evolution], March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,424942,00.html |title=Vatican Official Defends Evolution Against 'Useless' Creationism |publisher=Associated Press |publication-date=2008-09-19 |accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spokespersons from the Catholic Church have specifically criticized biblical creationism for relying upon literal interpretations of biblical scripture as the basis for determining scientific fact.&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican&quot;/&gt;

{{main|Creation-evolution controversy}}
The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] states that &quot;creation science is in fact [[pseudoscience|not science]] and should not be presented as such.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;NAS&quot;/&gt; and that &quot;the claims of creation science lack empirical support and cannot be meaningfully tested.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;NAS&quot; /&gt; According to ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]'', the &quot;creation 'science' movement gains much of its strength through the use of distortion and scientifically unethical tactics''&quot; and &quot;''seriously misrepresents the theory of evolution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Arthur, [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)]], Vol. 4, No. 4, 1996, pp. 88–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mypage.direct.ca/w/writer/gish.html Creationism: Bad Science or Immoral Pseudoscience?]&lt;/ref&gt;

For a [[theory]] to qualify as [[Scientific method|scientific]] it must be:
* consistent (internally and externally)
* [[Parsimony|parsimonious]] (sparing in proposed entities or explanations)
* useful (describing and explaining observed phenomena)
* empirically testable and [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]]
* based upon controlled, repeatable experiments
* correctable and dynamic (changing to fit with newly discovered data)
* progressive (achieving all that previous theories have and more)
* tentative (admitting that it might not be correct rather than asserting certainty)

For any [[hypothesis]] or [[conjecture]] to be considered scientific, it must meet at least most, but ideally all, of the above criteria. The fewer which are matched, the less scientific it is. If it meets two or fewer of these criteria, it cannot be treated as scientific in any useful sense of the word.

Scientists have considered the hypotheses proposed by creation science and have rejected them because of a lack of evidence. Furthermore, the claims of creation science do not refer to natural causes and cannot be subject to meaningful tests, so they do not qualify as scientific hypotheses. In 1987, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled that creationism is [[religion]], not science, and cannot be advocated in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;&lt;cite&gt;The legislative history demonstrates that the term &quot;creation science,&quot; as contemplated by the state legislature, embraces this religious teaching.&lt;/cite&gt;&quot; [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0482_0578_ZS.html Edwards v. Aguillard]&lt;/ref&gt; Most major religious groups have concluded that the concept of evolution is not at odds with their descriptions of creation and human origins.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;&lt;cite&gt;Indeed, many scientists are deeply religious. But science and religion occupy two separate realms of human experience. Demanding that they be combined detracts from the glory of each.&lt;/cite&gt;&quot; [http://newton.nap.edu/html/creationism/preface.html Science and creationism]&lt;/ref&gt;

A summary of the objections to creation science by scientists follows:
* ''Creation science is not falsifiable'' : The act of creation as defined in creation science is not falsifiable because no testable bounds can be imposed on the creator. In creation science, the creator is defined as limitless, with the capacity to create (or not), through fiat alone, infinite universes, not just one, and endow each one with its own unique, unimaginable and incomparable character. It is impossible to disprove a claim when that claim as defined encompasses every conceivable contingency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Root-Bernstein |first= Robert |editor= M. F. Ashley Montagu |title= Science and Creationism |publisher= Oxford University Press |location=USA |isbn= 978-0195032536 |chapter=On Defining a Scientific Theory: Creationism Considered |year= 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Creation science violates the principle of parsimony'' : [[Occam's Razor|Parsimony]] favours those explanations which rely on the fewest assumptions. Scientists prefer explanations which are consistent with known and supported facts and evidence and require the fewest assumptions to fill remaining gaps. Many of the alternative claims made in creation science retreat from simpler scientific explanations and introduce more complications and conjecture into the equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Alston |first= Jon P. |title= The Scientific Case Against Scientific Creationism |publisher= iUniverse |location=USA |isbn= 9780595291083 |page=21 |year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Creation science is not,  and cannot be, empirically or experimentally tested'' : Creationism posits [[supernatural|supernatural causes]] which lie outside the realm of [[naturalism (Philosophy)|methodological naturalism]] and scientific experiment. Science can only test empirical, natural claims.
* ''Creation science is not correctable, dynamic, tentative or progressive'' : Creation science adheres to a fixed and unchanging premise or &quot;absolute truth&quot;, the &quot;word of God,&quot; which is not open to change. Any evidence that runs contrary to that truth must be discarded.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}  In science, all claims are tentative, they are forever open to challenge, and must be discarded or adjusted when the weight of evidence demands it.

===Historical, philosophical, and sociological criticism===
Historically, the debate of whether creationism is compatible with science can be traced back to 1874, the year science historian [[John William Draper]] published his ''History of the Conflict between Religion and Science''. In it Draper portrayed the entire history of scientific development as a war against religion. This presentation of history was propagated further by followers such as [[Andrew Dickson White]] in his essay ''A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom''. Their conclusions have been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bede.org.uk/university.htm Medieval Science, the Church and Universities]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the principal focus of creation science advocates is on the [[government]]-supported [[Public school (government funded)|public school systems]], which are prohibited by the [[Establishment Clause]] from promoting specific religions (see ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'').

==Areas of study==
Subjects within creation science correspond to the scientific disciplines of [[biology]], [[earth science]]s and [[astronomy]].

===Creation biology===
{{See also|Baraminology}}
Creation biology centers on an idea derived from Genesis that states that life was created by [[God]], in a finite number of &quot;[[created kind]]s&quot;, rather than through biological evolution from a common ancestor. Creation scientists consider that any observable [[speciation]] descends from these distinctly created kinds through inbreeding, deleterious mutations and other genetic mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;E. Scott, &quot;[http://www.goucher.edu/x16509.xml The Evolution of Creationism]&quot;, Goucher College lecture March 13, 2006, mp3 format.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas evolutionary biologists and creation scientists share similar views of [[microevolution]], creation scientists disagree that the process of [[macroevolution]] can explain common ancestry among organisms far beyond the level of common species.&lt;ref name=&quot;evc&quot;/&gt; Creationists contend that there is no empirical evidence for [[speciation|new plant or animal species]], and deny fossil evidence has ever been found documenting the process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=260 The Vanishing Case for Evolution], [[Henry M. Morris]], [[Institute for Creation Research]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular arguments against evolution have changed since the publishing of [[Henry M. Morris]]'s first book on the subject, ''Scientific Creationism'' in October 1974, but some consistent themes remain: that [[missing links]] or gaps in the fossil record are proof against evolution; that the increased complexity of organisms over time through evolution is not possible due to the law of increasing [[entropy]]; that it is impossible that the mechanism of natural selection could account for common ancestry; and that evolutionary theory is untestable. The [[human evolution|origin of the human species]] is particularly hotly contested; the fossil remains of purported [[Hominidae|hominid]] ancestors are not considered by advocates of creation biology to be evidence for a speciation event involving [[Homo sapiens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/compare.html Comparison of all skulls], [[TalkOrigins Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologists challenge creation scientists who claim the fossil evidence disproves evolution. [[Richard Dawkins]] has explained evolution as &quot;a theory of gradual, incremental change over millions of years, which starts with something very simple and works up along slow, gradual gradients to greater complexity&quot;, and described the existing fossil record as entirely consistent with that process. Biologists emphasize that transitional gaps between those fossils recovered are to be expected, that the existence of any such gaps cannot be invoked to disprove evolution, and that instead the fossil evidence that could be used to disprove the theory would be those fossils which are found and which are entirely inconsistent with what can be predicted or anticipated by the evolutionary model. One example given by Dawkins was, &quot;If there were a single [[Hippopotamus|hippo]] or [[Precambrian rabbit|rabbit in the Precambrian]], that would completely blow evolution out of the water. None have ever been found.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1090909,00.html Time Magazine, 15 August 2005, page 32]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth sciences and geophysics===
{{main|Creation geophysics}}

====Flood geology====
{{main|Flood geology}}
[[Flood]] geology is a concept based on the belief that most of Earth's [[geology|geological]] record was formed by the [[Great Flood]] described in the story of [[Noah's ark]]. [[Fossil]]s and [[fossil fuels]] are believed to have formed from animal and plant matter which was buried rapidly during this flood, while [[submarine canyon]]s are explained as having formed during a rapid runoff from the continents at the end of the flood. [[Sedimentation|Sedimentary]] [[rock strata|strata]] are also claimed to have been predominantly laid down during or after Noah's flood&lt;ref name=&quot;HoweEtAl1999&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

For example, the [[Creation Research Society]] argues that &quot;uniformitarianism is wishful thinking.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq/notes/39/39_1/Note0206.htm creationresearch.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Geologists conclude that no evidence for such a flood is observed in the preserved [[rock layers]] and moreover that such a flood is physically impossible, given the current layout of land masses. For instance, since [[Mount Everest]] currently is approximately 8.8 kilometres in elevation and the Earth's surface area is 510,065,600 [[kilometer|km]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the volume of water required to cover [[Mount Everest]] to a depth of 15 [[cubits]] (6.8 m), as indicated by [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 7:20, would be 4.6 billion cubic kilometres. Measurements of the amount of precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere have ranged between zero and approximately 70mm, depending on the measurement date and location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwcsaf.org/HTMLContributions/TPW/Prod_TPW.htm Total Precipitable Water], NWCSAF.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there continue to be many adherents to flood geology, and in recent years new theories have been introduced such as [[catastrophic plate tectonics]] and [[catastrophic orogeny]].&lt;ref name=Froede1995&gt;{{Cite journal

====Radiometric dating====
{{See also|Radiometric dating}}

Creationists point to experiments they have performed, which they claim demonstrate that 1.5 billion years of [[nuclear decay]] took place over a short period of time, from which they infer that &quot;billion-fold speed-ups of nuclear decay&quot; have occurred, a massive violation of the principle that [[Radioactive decay|radioisotope decay]] rates are constant, a core principle underlying [[nuclear physics]] generally, and [[radiometric dating]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=302 ''Nuclear Decay: Evidence For A Young World''], [[Russell Humphreys|D. Russell Humphreys]], Impact, Number 352, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific community points to numerous flaws in the creationists' experiments, to the fact that their results have not been accepted for publication by any peer-reviewed scientific journal, and to the fact that the creationist scientists conducting them were untrained in experimental [[geochronology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/helium/zircons.html ''Young-Earth Creationist Helium Diffusion &quot;Dates&quot; Fallacies Based on Bad Assumptions and Questionable Data''], Kevin R.

The constancy of the decay rates of [[isotope]]s is well supported in science. Evidence for this constancy includes the correspondences of date estimates taken from different radioactive isotopes as well as correspondences with non-radiometric dating techniques such as [[dendrochronology]], ice core dating, and historical records. Although scientists have noted slight increases in the decay rate for isotopes subject to extreme pressures, those differences were too small to significantly impact date estimates. The constancy of the decay rates is also governed by first principles in [[quantum mechanics]], wherein any deviation in the rate would require a change in the fundamental constants. According to these principles, a change in the fundamental constants could not influence different elements uniformly, and a comparison between each of the elements' resulting unique chronological timescales would then give inconsistent time estimates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CF/CF210.html ''Claim CF210''], Mark Isaak (editor), Index to Creationist Claims, [[TalkOrigins]] website, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In refutation of young-Earth claims of inconstant decay rates affecting the reliability of radiometric dating, Roger C. Wiens, a physicist specializing in isotope dating states:
{{quote|There are only three quite technical instances where a half-life changes, and these do not affect the dating methods [under discussion]&lt;ref&gt;Dating methods discussed were [[potassium-argon dating]], [[argon-argon dating]], [[rubidium-strontium dating]], [[samarium-neodymium dating]], lutetium-hafnium, [[rhenium-osmium dating]], and [[uranium-lead dating]].&lt;/ref&gt;:
#Only one technical exception occurs under terrestrial conditions, and this is not for an isotope used for dating. ... The artificially-produced isotope, beryllium-7 has been shown to change by up to 1.5%, depending on its chemical environment. ... [H]eavier atoms are even less subject to these minute changes, so the dates of rocks made by electron-capture decays would only be off by at most a few hundredths of a percent.
# ... Another case is material inside of stars, which is in a plasma state where electrons are not bound to atoms. In the extremely hot stellar environment, a completely different kind of decay can occur. 'Bound-state beta decay' occurs when the nucleus emits an electron into a bound electronic state close to the nucleus. ... All normal matter, such as everything on Earth, the Moon, meteorites, etc. has electrons in normal positions, so these instances never apply to rocks, or anything colder than several hundred thousand degrees. ...
#The last case also involves very fast-moving matter. It has been demonstrated by [[atomic clock]]s in very fast spacecraft. These atomic clocks slow down very slightly (only a second or so per year) as predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity. No rocks in our solar system are going fast enough to make a noticeable change in their dates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/resources/Wiens.html#page%2020 Radiometric Dating, A Christian Perspective], Roger C. Wiens, [[American Scientific Affiliation]], p20-21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Radiohaloes====
{{see also|Radiohalo}}

In the 1970s, young Earth creationist [[Robert V. Gentry]] proposed that radiohaloes in certain granites represented evidence for the Earth being created instantaneously rather than gradually. This idea has been criticized by physicists and geologists on many grounds including that the rocks Gentry studied were not primordial and that the radionuclides in question need not have been in the rocks initially.

Thomas A. Baillieul, a geologist and retired senior environmental scientist with the [[United States Department of Energy]], disputed Gentry's claims in an article entitled,''&quot;Polonium Haloes&quot; Refuted: A Review of &quot;Radioactive Halos in a Radio-Chronological and Cosmological Perspective&quot;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polonium Haloes&quot;&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/po-halos/gentry.html &quot;Polonium Haloes&quot; Refuted - A Review of &quot;Radioactive Halos in a Radio-Chronological and Cosmological Perspective&quot; by Robert V. Gentry] by Thomas A. Baillieul. Copyright 2001–2005. Last Updated 22 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Baillieul noted that Gentry was a physicist with no background in geology and given the absence of this background, Gentry had misrepresented the geological context from which the specimens were collected. Additionally, he noted that Gentry relied on research from the beginning of the 20th century, long before radioisotopes were thoroughly understood; that his assumption that a Polonium isotope caused the rings was speculative; and that Gentry falsely argued that the [[half-life]] of radioactive elements varies with time. Gentry claimed that Baillieul could not publish his criticisms in a reputable scientific journal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halos.com/faq-replies/creation-halos-stand-unrefuted.htm Polonium Halos: Unrefuted]&lt;/ref&gt; although some of Baillieul's criticisms rested on work previously published in reputable scientific journals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polonium Haloes&quot;/&gt;

===Astronomy and cosmology===
====Creationist cosmologies====
{{main|Creationist cosmologies}}
Several attempts have been made by creationists to construct a cosmology consistent with a young universe rather than the standard cosmological [[age of the universe]], based on the belief that Genesis describes the creation of the universe as well as the Earth. The primary challenge for young-universe cosmologies is that the accepted distances in the universe require millions or billions of years for [[speed of light|light to travel]] to Earth (the [[starlight problem]]). An older creationist idea, proposed by creationist astronomer [[Barry Setterfield]], is that the [[speed of light]] has [[c-decay|decayed]] in the history of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/c-decay.html|title=The Decay of c-decay|author=Robert Day|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, creationist physicist [[Russell Humphreys]] has proposed a theory called &quot;white hole cosmology&quot; which suggests that the universe expanded out of a [[white hole]] less than 10,000 years ago; the apparent age of the universe results from [[general relativity|relativistic]] effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Russell Humphreys]]|title=Starlight and Time|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humphreys' theory is advocated by creationist organisations such as Answers in Genesis; however because the predictions of Humphreys' cosmology conflict with current well-established observations, it is not accepted by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CE/CE412.html|title=Claim CE412], [[TalkOrigins Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Planetology====
{{see also|Planetary science}}
Various claims are made by creationists concerning alleged evidence that the age of the [[solar system]] is of the order of thousands of years, in contrast to the scientifically accepted age of 4.6 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interacademies.net/Object.File/Master/6/150/Evolution%20statement.pdf IAP STATEMENT ON THE TEACHING OF EVOLUTION], Interacademy Panel on International Issues.&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly argued that the number of [[comet]]s in the solar system is much higher than would be expected given its supposed age. Creationist astronomers express scepticism about the existence of the [[Kuiper belt]] and [[Oort cloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In response to increasing evidence suggesting that [[Mars]] once possessed a wetter climate, some creation scientists have proposed that the [[flood geology|global flood]] affected not only the Earth but also Mars and other planets. People who support this claim include creationist astronomer Wayne Spencer and creationist cosmologist [[Russell Humphreys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Cirth''' ({{IPA|[ˈkirθ]}}; &quot;''[[Runic alphabet|Runes]]''&quot;) are the letters of an [[artificial script]] which was invented by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] for the [[constructed language]]s he devised and used in his works. The initial C in Cirth is pronounced as a K, never as an S.

The runic alphabet used by the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] of Middle-earth was adapted by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] from real-life runes. In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the [[Anglo-Saxon futhorc]] was used in the publication with few changes; in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' a new system of runes, the Cirth, was devised.

Since the Cirth is an alphabet, one rune generally stands for one sound ([[phoneme]]) and sounds that would be written with a [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] in English (such as &quot;sh&quot; and &quot;th&quot;) are written with one rune. Words are separated by a dot rather than a space, and double consonants are grouped together into one rune, the same as if it were a single consonant. Presumably this alphabet was meant to be used in conjunction with a Dwarf language, but mostly it is used for transliterations.

In the fictional history of [[Middle-earth]], the original '''''Certhas Daeron''''' was created by the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elf]] [[Daeron]], the [[minstrel]] of king [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]] and was later expanded into what was known as the '''''Angerthas Daeron'''''. Although the Cirth were later largely replaced by the [[Tengwar]] (which were enhanced and brought by [[Fëanor]]), they were adopted by [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] to write down their Khuzdul language ('''''Angerthas Moria''''' and '''''Angerthas [[Erebor]]''''') because their straight lines were better suited to carving than the curved strokes of the Tengwar. Some examples of Cirth writings are the inscription on [[Balin (Middle-earth)|Balin's]] tomb in [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] and the inscriptions on the top of the title pages for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Cirth was also adapted, in its older and simpler form, by various kinds of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] and even [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]]. For example, it was used by the Men of Dale and the [[Rohan#People|Rohirrim]] and the Orcs of Moria.

''Cirth'' is plural and is written with a capital ''C'' when referring to the writing system—the runes themselves can be called ''cirth''. A single rune is a ''certh''.

Many letters have shapes also found in the historical [[Runic alphabet|futhorc]] runes (used in ''[[The Hobbit]]''), but their sound values are dissimilar. Rather, the system of assignment of sound values is much more systematic in the Cirth than in the historical runes (e.g., voiced variants of a voiceless sound are expressed by an additional stroke). A similar system has been proposed for a few historical runes (e.g. ''p'' ᛈ  and ''w'' ᚹ as variants of ''b'' ᛒ), but is in any case much more obscure. There are a few coincidental identities between cirth and runic letters, ''i'' with runic ᛁ, ''k'' with Younger Futhark ᚴ  and ''ch'' with the Futhorc ᚳ; ''p'' is furthermore reminiscent of Latin P (runic ᚹ ''w'').

Cirth is written according to a certain mode specifically adapted for a language, and the values of individual certh may vary greatly according to the mode used. Three modes for Cirth are described in detail in Appendix E of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and others are known to exist or have been developed by enthusiasts.

The Cirth are not yet part of the [[Unicode]] Standard. However the [[ConScript Unicode Registry]] has defined the {{U+|E080}} to U+E0FF range of the Unicode &quot;Private Use Area&quot; for Cirth.

The Angerthas Daeron consists of 60 letters:

This chart showing the runes shared by the ''Angerthas Daeron'' and ''Angerthas Moria'' is presented in Appendix E of ''[[The Return of the King (book)|The Return of the King]]''. Some of the ''cirth'' had different values for the [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish]] and [[Khuzdul|Dwarvish]] languages and some were used in only one system or the other.  Where two values are given connected with a hyphen, the first is that of the older Angerthas, the second that of the dwarvish Angerthas Moria. Letters with asterisk are dwarvish only, values in brackets elvish only.

The '''Lockheed C-130 Hercules''' is a four-engine [[turboprop]] [[military transport aircraft]] designed and built originally by [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], now [[Lockheed Martin]]. Capable of using unprepared [[runway]]s for takeoffs and landings, the C-130 was originally designed as a troop, [[MEDEVAC|medical evacuation]], and cargo transport aircraft. The versatile [[airframe]] has found uses in a variety of other roles, including as a [[gunship]] ([[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130]]), for [[airborne infantry|airborne assault]], [[search and rescue]], scientific research support, weather reconnaissance, [[aerial refueling]], maritime patrol and [[aerial firefighting]]. It is the main [[tactical airlift]]er for many military forces worldwide. Over 40 models and variants of the Hercules serve with more than 60 nations.

During its years of service, the Hercules family has participated in countless military, civilian and [[humanitarian aid]] operations. The family has the longest continuous production run of any military aircraft in history. In 2007, the C-130 became the fifth aircraft—after the [[English Electric Canberra]], [[B-52 Stratofortress]], [[Tupolev Tu-95]], and [[KC-135 Stratotanker]]—to mark 50 years of continuous use with its original primary customer, in this case, the [[United States Air Force]]. The C-130 is also the only military aircraft to remain in continuous production for 50 years with its original customer, as the updated [[C-130J Super Hercules]].

==Design and development==
===Background and requirements===

The [[Korean War]], which began in June 1950, showed that [[World War II]]-era [[Reciprocating engine|piston-engine]] transports—[[C-119 Flying Boxcar]]s, [[C-47 Skytrain]]s and [[C-46 Commando]]s—were inadequate for modern warfare. Thus on 2 February 1951, the [[United States Air Force]] issued a General Operating Requirement (GOR) for a new transport to [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]], [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]], [[Chase Aircraft]], [[North American Aviation|North American]], [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]], and [[Airlifts Inc]]. The new transport would have a capacity for 92 passengers, 72 combat troops or 64 paratroopers in a cargo compartment that is approximately {{convert|41|ft|m}} long, {{convert|9|ft|m}} high, and {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide. Unlike transports derived from passenger airliners, it was to be designed from the ground-up as a combat transport with loading from a ramp at the rear of the fuselage. This innovation for military cargo aircraft was first pioneered on the WW II German [[Junkers Ju 252]] and Ju 253 &quot;Hercules&quot; transport prototypes in WWII. The [[Boeing C-97]] also had a retracting ramp through clamshell doors, but could not be used for airdrops of cargo.

The Hercules also resembled a larger four-engine brother to the [[C-123 Provider]] with a similar wing and cargo ramp layout. That plane evolved from the Chase XCG-20 Avitruc, which was first designed and flown as a cargo glider in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/cg-20.htm &quot;Chase XCG-20 Avitruc.&quot;] ''globalsecurity.org.'' Retrieved: 2 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The rear ramp not only makes it possible to drive vehicles onto the plane (also possible with forward ramp on a [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II|C-124]]), but to airdrop or use low-altitude extraction for [[M551 Sheridan|Sheridan tanks]] or even dropping improvised &quot;[[BLU-82|daisy cutter]]&quot; bombs.

A key feature was the introduction of the T56 [[turboprop]], which was first developed specifically for the C-130. At the time, the turboprop was a new application of turbine engines that used exhaust gases to turn a shafted propeller, which offered greater range at propeller-driven speeds compared to pure turbojets, which were faster but thirstier. As was the case on helicopters of that era such as the UH-1 Huey, [[turboshaft]]s produced much more power for their weight than piston engines. Lockheed would subsequently use the same engines and technology in the [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]]. That plane failed to perform efficiently in its civilian configuration but quite successfully adapted as the [[P-3 Orion]] patrol plane where speed and endurance of turboprops excelled.

The new Lockheed cargo plane design possessed a range of {{convert|1100|nmi|mi km|-2|abbr=on}}, takeoff capability from short and unprepared strips, and the ability to fly with one engine shut down. Fairchild, North American, Martin and Northrop declined to participate. The remaining five companies tendered a total of 10 designs: Lockheed two, Boeing one, Chase three, Douglas three, and Airlifts Inc. one. The contest was a close affair between the lighter of the two Lockheed (preliminary project designation L-206) proposals and a four-turboprop Douglas design.

[[File:YC-130s formation usaf.jpg|thumb|The two YC-130 prototypes; the blunt nose was replaced with [[radar]] on later production models.]]

The Lockheed design team was led by [[Willis Hawkins]], starting with a 130 page proposal for the ''Lockheed L-206''.&lt;ref name='rhodes'&gt;Rhodes, Jeff. [http://www.codeonemagazine.com/archives/2004/articles/aug_04/hawkins/ &quot;Willis Hawkins and the Genesis of the Hercules.&quot;] ''Code One Magazine'', Volume 19, Issue 3, 2004. Retrieved: 2 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hall Hibbard]], Lockheed vice president and chief engineer, saw the proposal and directed it to [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]], who did not care for the low-speed, unarmed aircraft, and remarked, &quot;If you sign that letter, you will destroy the Lockheed Company.&quot;&lt;ref name='rhodes'/&gt; Both Hibbard and Johnson signed the proposal and the company won the contract for the now-designated Model 82 on 2 July 1951.&lt;ref name='boyne'&gt;Boyne, Walter J. ''Beyond the Horizons: The Lockheed Story.'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 1998. ISBN 978-0312192372.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first flight of the ''YC-130'' [[prototype]] was made on 23 August 1954 from the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] plant in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], [[California]]. The aircraft, [[United States military aircraft serials|serial number]] ''53-3397'', was the second prototype but the first of the two to fly. The YC-130 was piloted by Stanley Beltz and Roy Wimmer on its 61-minute flight to [[Edwards Air Force Base]]; Jack Real and Dick Stanton served as flight engineers. Kelly Johnson flew chase in a [[P2V Neptune]].&lt;ref name='dabney'&gt;Dabney, Joseph E.

Retrieved: 2 October 2010.&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Excerpted from ''HERK: Hero of the Skies'' in ''Lockheed Martin Service News, Lockheed Martin Air Mobility Support '' Volume 29, Issue 2, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production===
[[File:C-130 Hercules cockpit hg.jpg|thumb|C-130H Hercules flight deck]]

After the two prototypes were completed, production began in [[Marietta, Georgia]], where over 2,300 C-130s have been built through 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Olausson 2009, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial production model, the ''C-130A'', was powered by [[Allison T56]]-A-9 turboprops with three-blade [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s. Deliveries began in December 1956, continuing until the introduction of the ''C-130B'' model in 1959. Some A models were re-designated ''C-130D'' after being equipped with [[ski]]s. The newer C-130B had [[aileron]]s with increased boost—3,000&amp;nbsp;[[pounds per square inch|psi]] (21&amp;nbsp;MPa) versus 2,050&amp;nbsp;psi (14&amp;nbsp;MPa)—as well as uprated engines and four-bladed propellers that were standard until the J-model's introduction.

===C-130A model===
[[File:Mexican Air Force C-130A.jpg|thumb|[[Mexican Air Force]] C-130A]]

The first production C-130s were designated as A-models, with deliveries in 1956 to the [[463d Troop Carrier Wing]] at [[Ardmore AFB]], Oklahoma and the [[314th Troop Carrier Wing]] at [[Sewart AFB]], Tennessee. Six additional squadrons were assigned to the [[322d Air Division]] in Europe and the [[315th Air Division]] in the Far East. Additional airplanes were modified for electronics intelligence work and assigned to [[Rhein-Main Air Base]], Germany while modified RC-130As were assigned to the [[Military Air Transport Service]] (MATS) photo-mapping division. Airplanes equipped with giant skis were designated as C-130Ds, but were essentially A-models except for the conversion. Australia became the first non American force to operate the C130A Hercules with 12 examples being delivered during late 1958-early 1959. These aircraft were fitted with three-blade AeroProducts propeller of 15' diameter. As the C-130A became operational with [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC), the C-130's lack of range became apparent and additional fuel capacity was added in the form of external pylon-mounted tanks at the end of the wings. The A-model continued in service through the [[Vietnam War]], where the airplanes assigned to the four squadrons at [[Naha AB]], Okinawa and one at [[Tachikawa Airfield|Tachikawa Air Base]], Japan performed yeoman's service, including operating highly classified special operations missions such as the BLIND BAT FAC/Flare mission and FACT SHEET leaflet mission over Laos and North Vietnam. The A-model was also provided to the South Vietnamese Air Force as part of the Vietnamization program at the end of the war, and equipped three squadrons based at Tan Son Nhut AFB. The last operator in the world is the Honduran Air Force, which is still flying one of five A model Hercules (FAH ''558'', c/n 3042) as of October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Olausson 2010, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===C-130B model===
The C-130B model was developed to complement the A models that had previously been delivered, and incorporated new features, particularly increased fuel capacity in the form of auxiliary tanks built into the center wing section and an AC electrical system. Four-bladed Hamilton Standard propellers replaced the Aero Product three-bladed propellers that distinguished the earlier A-models. B-models replaced A-models in the 314th and 463rd Troop Carrier Wings. During the Vietnam War four squadrons assigned to the 463rd Troop Carrier/Tactical Airlift Wing based at Clark Air Force Base and Mactan Air Force Base in the Philippines were used primarily for tactical airlift operations in South Vietnam. In the spring of 1969, 463rd crews commenced COMMANDO VAULT bombing missions dropping &quot;daisy cutter&quot; [[M-121 (bomb)|M-121]] 10,000&amp;nbsp;lb (4,534&amp;nbsp;kg) bombs to clear &quot;instant LZs&quot; for helicopters. These would later be used by South Vietnam forces in a last-ditch air support effort to turn back communist troops. As the Vietnam War wound down, the 463rd B-models and A-models of the 374th Tactical Airlift Wing were transferred back to the United States where most were assigned to [[Air Force Reserve]] and [[Air National Guard]] units. Another prominent role for the B model was with the [[United States Marine Corps]], where Hercules initially designated as GV-1s replaced C-119s. After Air Force C-130Ds proved the type's usefulness in Antarctica, the US Navy purchased a number of B-models equipped with skis that were designated as LC-130s. The Royal Canadian Air Force became another early user of the C130 with the delivery of its first B model in 1960.

An electronic reconnaissance variant of the C-130B was designated C-130B-II. A total of 13 aircraft were converted and operated under the SUN VALLEY program name. They were operated primarily from Yokota Air Base, Japan. All reverted to standard C-130B cargo aircraft after their replacement in the reconnaissance role by other aircraft. The C-130B-II was distinguished by its false external wing fuel tanks, which were disguised signals intelligence (SIGINT) receiver antennas. These pods were slightly larger than the standard wing tanks found on other C-130Bs. Most aircraft featured a swept blade antenna on the upper fuselage, as well as extra wire antennas between the vertical fin and upper fuselage not found on other C-130s. Radio call numbers on the tail of these aircraft were regularly changed so as to confuse observers and disguise their true mission.

===C-130E model===
[[File:C130 Hercules, Brazilian Air Force I.jpg|thumb|[[Brazilian Air Force]] C-130E]]

The extended range ''C-130E'' model entered service in 1962 after it was developed as an interim long-range transport for the Military Air Transport Service. Essentially a B-model, the new designation was the result of the installation of 1,360&amp;nbsp;US [[gallon|gal]] (5,150&amp;nbsp;L) ''Sargent Fletcher'' external fuel tanks under each wing's mid-section and more powerful [[Allison Engine Company|Allison]] T56-A-7A turboprops. The hydraulic boost pressure to the [[ailerons]] was reduced back to 2050 psi as a consequence of the external tanks weight in the middle of the wingspan. The E model also featured structural improvements, [[avionics]] upgrades and a higher gross weight. Australia took delivery of 12 C130E Hercules during 1966-67 to supplement the 12 C-130A models already in service with the RAAF. Sweden and Spain fly the TP-84T version of the C-130E fitted for aerial refueling capability.

===C-130F / KC-130F / C-130G models===
The ''KC-130'' [[Tanker (aircraft)|tankers]], originally ''C-130F''s procured for the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] (USMC) in 1958 (under the designation ''GV-1'') are equipped with a removable 3,600&amp;nbsp;US gal (13,626&amp;nbsp;l) [[stainless steel]] [[fuel tank]] carried inside the cargo compartment. The two wing-mounted hose and drogue aerial refueling pods each transfer up to 300&amp;nbsp;US gal per minute (19&amp;nbsp;l per second) to two aircraft simultaneously, allowing for rapid cycle times of multiple-receiver aircraft formations, (a typical tanker formation of four aircraft in less than 30 minutes). The [[United States Navy|US Navy]]'s ''C-130G'' has increased structural strength allowing higher gross weight operation.

===C-130H model===
[[File:C-130 Hercules 2.jpg|thumb|[[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] C-130H]]

The ''C-130H'' model has updated Allison T56-A-15 turboprops, a redesigned outer [[wing]], updated avionics and other minor improvements. Later ''H'' models had a new, fatigue-life-improved, center wing that was retro-fitted to many earlier H-models. The H model remains in widespread use with the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] (USAF) and many foreign air forces. Initial deliveries began in 1964 (to the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force|RNZAF]]), remaining in production until 1996. An improved C-130H was introduced in 1974, with Australia purchasing 12 of type in 1978 to replace the original 12 C-130A models which had first entered RAAF Service in 1958.

The United States Coast Guard employs the HC-130H for long range search and rescue, drug interdiction, illegal migrant patrols, homeland security, and logistics.

C-130H models produced from 1992 to 1996 were designated as C-130H3 by the USAF. The 3 denoting the third variation in design for the H series. Improvements included ring laser gyros for the INUs, GPS receivers, a partial [[glass cockpit]] (ADI and HSI instruments), a more capable APN-241 color radar, [[night vision device]] compatible instrument lighting, and an integrated radar and missile warning system. The electrical system upgrade included Generator Control Units (GCU) and Bus Switching units (BSU)to provide stable power to the more sensitive upgraded components.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

===C-130K model===
[[File:raf.hercules.c-130k.c3.arp.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Air Force]] C-130K (C.3)]]

The equivalent model for export to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] is the ''C-130K'', known by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) as the ''Hercules C.1''. The ''C-130H-30'' (''Hercules C.3'' in RAF service) is a stretched version of the original Hercules, achieved by inserting a 100&amp;nbsp;in (2.54&amp;nbsp;m) plug aft of the cockpit and an 80&amp;nbsp;in (2.03&amp;nbsp;m) plug at the rear of the fuselage. A single C-130K was purchased by the [[Met Office]] for use by its Meteorological Research Flight, where it was classified as the ''Hercules W.2''. This aircraft was heavily modified (with its most prominent feature being the long red and white striped atmospheric probe on the nose and the move of the weather radar into a pod above the forward fuselage). This aircraft, named ''[[Snoopy]]'', was withdrawn in 2001 and was then modified by [[Marshall Aerospace|Marshall of Cambridge Aerospace]] as flight-test bed for the [[A400M]] turbine engine, the [[TP400]]. The C-130K is used by the [[RAF Falcons]] for parachute drops. Three C-130K (Hercules C Mk.1P) were upgraded and sold to the Austrian Air Force in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/luftfahrzeuge/c130.htm &quot;C-130K in the Austrian Air Force.&quot;] ''doppeladler.com.'' Retrieved: 2 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later C-130 models &amp; variants===
The ''[[Lockheed MC-130|MC-130E Combat Talon]]'' was developed for the USAF during the [[Vietnam War]] to support [[special operations]] missions throughout Southeast Asia, and spawned a family of special missions aircraft. 37 of the earliest models currently operating with the [[United States Special Operations Command]] are scheduled to be replaced by new-production MC-130J versions. The [[Lockheed EC-130|EC-130]] and [[EC-130H Compass Call]] versions are also Special variants but are assigned to Air Combat Command (ACC).
[[File:HC-130P-N refuels HH-60G.jpg|thumb|USAF HC-130P refuels a [[HH-60G Pavehawk]] helicopter]]

The ''[[Lockheed HC-130|HC-130]]'' is a family of long-range search and rescue variants used by the USAF and the US Coast Guard. Equipped for deep deployment of [[Air Force Pararescue|Pararescuemen]] (PJs), survival equipment, and aerial refueling of combat rescue helicopters, HC-130s are usually the on-scene command aircraft for combat SAR missions. Early versions were equipped with the [[Fulton surface-to-air recovery system]], designed to pull a person off the ground using a wire strung from a helium balloon. The John Wayne movie ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' features its use. The Fulton system was later removed when aerial refueling of helicopters proved safer and more versatile. The movie ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]'' depicts a real life SAR mission involving aerial refueling of a [[New York Air National Guard]] [[HH-60 Pave Hawk|HH-60G]] by a New York Air National Guard HC-130P.

The ''C-130R'' and ''C-130T'' are US Navy and USMC models, both equipped with underwing external fuel tanks. The USN C-130T is similar, but has additional avionics improvements. In both models, aircraft are equipped with Allison T56-A-16 engines. The USMC versions are designated ''KC-130R'' or ''KC-130T'' when equipped with underwing refueling pods and pylons and are fully [[Night vision device|night vision]] system compatible.

The RC-130 is a [[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance]] version. A single example is used by the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]], the aircraft having originally been sold to the former [[Imperial Iranian Air Force]].

The ''[[Lockheed L-100 Hercules|Lockheed L-100 (L-382)]]'' is a civilian variant, equivalent to a C-130E model without military equipment. The L-100 also has two stretched versions.

===Next generation===
{{Main|Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules}}

In the 1970s, Lockheed proposed a C-130 variant with [[turbofan]] engines rather than turboprops, but the US Air Force preferred the takeoff performance of the existing aircraft. In the 1980s, the C-130 was intended to be replaced by the [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport]] project. The project was canceled and the C-130 has remained in production.

In the 1990s, the improved [[C-130J Super Hercules]] was developed by Lockheed (later Lockheed Martin). This model is the newest version and the only model in production. Externally similar to the classic Hercules in general appearance, the J model has new turboprop engines, six-bladed propellers, digital avionics, and other new systems.

===Improvements and upgrades===
In 2000, Boeing was awarded a {{US$|1.4 billion}} contract to develop an Avionics Modernization Programme kit for the C-130. The program was beset with delays and cost overruns until project restructuring in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;fg_c130amp&quot;&gt;Trimble, Stephen.

Retrieved: 2 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 September 2009, Bloomberg news reported that the planned Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) upgrade to the older C-130s would be dropped to provide more funds for the F-35, CV-22 and airborne tanker replacement programs.&lt;ref&gt;Capaccio, Tony.

A total of 198 aircraft are expected to feature the AMP upgrade. The current cost per aircraft is {{US$|14 million}} although Boeing expects that this price will drop to US$7 million for the 69th aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;fg_c130amp&quot;/&gt;

The Hercules holds the record for the largest and heaviest aircraft to land on an [[aircraft carrier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenceaviation.com/2007/06/c-130-hercules-on-aircraft-carrier.html &quot;C-130 Hercules on Aircraft carrier.&quot;] ''Defence Aviation,'' 2 May 2007. Retrieved: 2 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In October and November 1963, a USMC KC-130F (BuNo ''149798''), loaned to the US Naval Air Test Center, made 29 [[touch-and-go landing]]s, 21 [[Arresting gear|unarrested]] full-stop landings and 21 unassisted take-offs on the [[USS Forrestal (CVA-59)|USS ''Forrestal'']] at a number of different weights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://navysite.de/cvn/cv59.htm &quot;USS Forrestal (CV 59).&quot;] ''navysite.de (Unofficial US Navy site).'' Retrieved: 2 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot, LT (later [[Rear Admiral|RADM]]) [[James H. Flatley III]], USN, was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his role in this test series. The tests were highly successful, but the idea was considered too risky for routine &quot;[[Carrier onboard delivery|Carrier Onboard Delivery]]&quot; (COD) operations. Instead, the [[C-2 Greyhound]] was developed as a dedicated COD aircraft. The Hercules used in the test, most recently in service with Marine Aerial Refueler Squadron 352 ([[VMGR-352]]) until 2005, is now part of the collection of the [[National Museum of Naval Aviation]] at [[NAS Pensacola]], [[Florida]].

[[File:C-130 Kham Duc.jpg|thumb|250px|The C-130 Hercules were used in the [[Battle of Kham Duc]], when the North Vietnamese army forced U.S.-led forces to abandon the Kham Duc Special Forces Camp.]]
In 1958, a US reconnaissance C-130A-II was shot down over Armenia by [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17s]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nsagov2009&quot;&gt;[http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/vigilance_park/shootdown_flight60528.shtml &quot;The Shootdown of Flight 60528.&quot;] ''National Vigilance Park- NSA/CSS'' via ''nsa.gov,'' 12 January 2009. Retrieved: 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the C-130 is involved in cargo and resupply operations daily, it has been a part of some notable offensive operations.

In 1964 C-130 crews from the 6315th Operations Group at [[Naha]] AB, Okinawa commenced [[FAC/Flare]] missions over the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] in [[Laos]] supporting USAF strike aircraft. In April 1965 the mission was expanded to [[North Vietnam]] where C-130 crews led formations of [[B-57]] bombers on night reconnaissance/strike missions against communist supply routes leading to South Vietnam. In early 1966 Project BLIND BAT/LAMPLIGHTER was established at [[Ubon]] RTAFB, [[Thailand]]. After the move to Ubon the mission became a four-engine forward air controller (FAC) mission with the C-130 crew searching for targets then calling in strike aircraft. Another little-known C-130 mission flown by Naha-based crews was COMMANDO SCARF, which involved the delivery of chemicals onto sections of the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos that were designed to produce mud and landslides in hopes of making the truck routes impassable.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In November 1964, on the other side of the globe, C-130Es from the 464th Troop Carrier Wing but loaned to [[322d Air Division]] in [[France]], flew one of the most dramatic missions in history in the former [[Belgian Congo]]. After a Congolese rebel group named &quot;Simba&quot; took white residents of the city of [[Stanleyville]] hostage, [[Simba Rebellion|the US and Belgian developed a joint rescue mission]] that used the C-130s to airlift and then drop and air-land a force of [[Belgia]]n paratroopers to rescue the hostages. Two missions were flown, one over Stanleyville and another over [[Paulis (Congo)|Paulis]] during Thanksgiving weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Odom, Maj. T. [http://www.cgsc.edu/carl/resources/csi/odom/odom.asp &quot;Dragon Operations: Hostage Rescues in the Congo, 1964-1965.&quot;] ''Combat Studies Institute.,'' January 2009. Retrieved: 2 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The headline-making mission resulted in the first award of the prestigious [[MacKay Trophy]] to C-130 crews.

In October 1968 a C-130B from the 463rd Tactical Airlift Wing dropped a pair of M121 10,000 pound bombs that had been developed for the massive [[B-36]] bomber but had never been used. The US Army and US Air Force resurrected the huge weapons as a means of clearing landing zones for helicopters and in early 1969 the 463rd commenced [[BLU-82|Commando Vault]] missions. Although the stated purpose of COMMANDO VAULT was to clear LZs, they were also used on enemy base camps and other targets.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The [[MC-130 Combat Talon]] variant carries and deploys the among the largest conventional [[bomb]]s in the world, the [[BLU-82]] &quot;Daisy Cutter&quot; and [[GBU-43/B]] [[Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb]], also known as the MOAB. Daisy Cutters were used during the [[Vietnam War]] to clear landing zones and to eliminate [[land mine|mine fields]]. The weight and size of the weapons make it impossible or impractical to load them on conventional [[bomber aircraft|bombers]]. The GBU-43/B MOAB is a successor to the BLU-82 and can perform the same function, as well as perform strike functions against hardened targets in a low air threat environment.

The AC-130 also holds the record for the longest sustained flight by a C-130. From 22 October to 24 October 1997, two AC-130U gunships flew 36.0 hours nonstop from Hurlburt Field Florida to Taegu (Daegu), South Korea while being refueled 7 times by KC-135 tanker aircraft. This record flight shattered the previous record longest flight by over 10 hours while the 2 gunships took on {{convert|410000|lb|abbr=on}} of fuel. The gunship has been used in every major U.S. combat operation since Vietnam, except for [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]], the 1986 attack on Libya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afsoc.af.mil/library/afsocheritage/index.asp &quot;AFSOC Heritage.&quot;] ''US Air Force Special Operations Command.'' Retrieved: 31 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], the [[Pakistan Air Force]] modified/improvised several aircraft for use as heavy bombers, and attacks were made on Indian bridges and troop concentrations with some successes. No aircraft were lost in the operations, though one was slightly damaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;pakdef&quot;&gt;Shafi, Saqib.

Retrieved: 2 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also used in the 1976 [[Operation Entebbe|Entebbe raid]] in which [[Israel]]i [[commando]] forces carried a surprise assault to rescue 103 passengers of an airliner hijacked by [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] and [[Germany|German]] [[terrorists]] at [[Entebbe Airport]], [[Uganda]]. The rescue force—200 soldiers, jeeps, and a black [[Mercedes-Benz]] (intended to resemble Ugandan [[Dictator]] [[Idi Amin]]'s vehicle of state)—was flown {{convert|2200|nmi|mi km|0|abbr=on}} from Israel to Entebbe by four [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF) Hercules aircraft without mid-air refueling (on the way back, the planes refueled in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]).

During the [[Falklands War]] ({{lang-es|Guerra de las Malvinas}}) of 1982, [[Argentine Air Force]] C-130s undertook highly dangerous, daily re-supply night flights as blockade runners to the Argentine garrison on the [[Falkland Islands]]. They also performed daylight maritime survey flights. One [[Nigel Ward|was lost]] during the war. Argentina also operated two KC-130 [[Aerial refueling|tankers]] during the war, and these refueled both the [[A-4 Skyhawk|Skyhawk]] and Navy [[Super Etendards]] which sank [[Argentine air forces in the Falklands War|6 British ships]]. The British also used their C-130s to support their logistical operations.

During the [[Gulf War]] of 1991 (Operation Desert Storm), the C-130 Hercules was used operationally by the US Air Force, US Navy and US Marine Corps, along with the air forces of Australia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the UK.

===Recent history===
During the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan in 2001]] and the ongoing support of the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (Operation Enduring Freedom), the C-130 Hercules has been used operationally by Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, the UK and the United States.

During the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] (Operation Iraqi Freedom), the C-130 Hercules has been used operationally by Australia, the UK and the United States. After the initial invasion, C-130 operators as part of the [[Multinational force in Iraq]] used their C-130s to support their forces in Iraq.

One RAF C-130 was shot down on 30 January 2005, when an Iraqi insurgent brought it down firing with a [[ZU-23]] anti-aircraft artillery gun while the plane was flying at 164&amp;nbsp;ft (50&amp;nbsp;m) after it had dropped [[Special Air Service|SAS]] special forces paratroopers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2005/05/17/1370123.htm &quot;Anti-aircraft fire blamed for Iraq plane downing: report.&quot;] ''ABC News Australia,''17 May 2005.

A prominent C-130T aircraft named ''Fat Albert'' serves as the support aircraft for the US Navy [[Blue Angels]] flight demonstration team. Although Fat Albert supports a Navy squadron, it is operated by the US Marine Corps (USMC) and its crew consists solely of USMC personnel. At some [[Air Show|air shows]] featuring the team, Fat Albert takes part, performing flyovers and sometimes demonstrating its jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) capabilities, but the JATO demonstration ended in 2009 due to dwindling supplies of rockets.&lt;ref name=&quot;FA JATO&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Abort Launch: Air shows to do without Fat Albert’s famed JATO|last=McCullough|first=Amy|date=2009-11-09|work=[[Marine Corps Times]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|pages=6|accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Forest Service]] developed the [[Modular Airborne FireFighting System]] for the C-130 in the 1970s, which allows regular aircraft to be temporarily converted to an [[airtanker]] for fighting [[wildfire]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/aviation/fixed_wing/maffs/index.html &quot;Modular Airborne FireFighting Systems.&quot;] ''U.S. Forest Service,'' 16 March 2010.

After one of these aircraft crashed due to wing separation in flight as a result of fatigue stress cracking, the entire fleet of C-130A air tankers was permanently grounded in 2004 (see [[2002 airtanker crashes]]). C-130s have been used to spread chemical dispersants onto the massive oil slick in the Gulf Coast in 2010.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Accidents and losses==
{{Main|List of C-130 Hercules crashes}}
The C-130 Hercules has had a low accident rate in general. The Royal Air Force recorded an accident rate of about one aircraft loss per 250,000 flying hours over the last forty years, placing it behind [[Vickers VC10]]s and [[Lockheed TriStar]]s with no flying losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;dasa&quot;&gt;[http://www.dasa.mod.uk/natstats/accidents/accdam/acctab2.html &quot;Aircraft Air Accidents and Damage Rates.&quot;] {{Dead link|date=February 2011}} ''Defence Analytical Services Agency.'' Retrieved: 2 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; USAF C-130A/B/E-models had an overall attrition rate of 5 percent as of 1989 as compared to 1 to 2 percent for commercial airliners in the U.S., according to the [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]], 10 percent for [[B-52]] bombers, and 20 percent for fighters ([[F-4 Phantom II|F-4]], [[F-111]]), trainers ([[T-37 Tweet|T-37]], [[T-38 Talon|T-38]]), and helicopters ([[Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King|H-3]]).&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, Alan E., Ph.D, Former Senior USAF Safety Scientist, &quot;Silent Knights: Blowing the Whistle on Military Accidents and Their Cover-ups&quot;, Brassey's Inc., Dulles, Virginia, 2002, Library of Congress card number 2001052726, ISBN 1-57488-544-8, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 70 aircraft were lost by the [[United States Air Force]] and the [[United States Marine Corps]] during combat operations in the [[Vietnam War]] in [[Southeast Asia]].

The '''Commodore 1570''' was a 5¼&quot; [[floppy disk]] drive for the [[Commodore 128]] [[home computer|home]]/[[personal computer]]. It was a single-sided, 170KB version of the double-sided [[Commodore 1571]], released as a [[stopgap]] measure when [[Commodore International]] was unable to provide large enough quantities of 1571s due to a shortage of double-sided drive mechanisms.  Like the 1571, it could read and write both [[Group Code Recording|GCR]] and [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] disk formats.
The 1570 utilized a 1571 logic board in a cream-colored [[Commodore 1541]] case with a drive mechanism similar to the 1541 except that it was equipped with track zero detection. Like the 1571, its built-in DOS provided a data burst mode for transferring data to the C128 computer at a faster speed than a 1541. Its [[Read-only memory|ROM]] also contained some DOS bug fixes that didn't appear in the 1571 until much later.  The 1570 could read and write all single-sided [[CP/M operating system|CP/M]] format disks that the 1571 could access.

Although the 1570 was compatible with the [[Commodore 64]], the C64 wasn't capable of taking advantage of the drive's higher-speed operation, and when used with the C64 it was little more than a pricier 1541.  Also, many early buyers of the C128 chose to temporarily make do with a 1541 drive, perhaps owned as part of a previous C64 setup, until the 1571 became more widely available.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Commodore 1571.png|thumb|right|250px|The '''Commodore 1571''' disk drive]]
The '''Commodore 1571''' was [[Commodore International|Commodore's]] high-end 5¼[[inch|&quot;]] [[floppy disk]] drive. With its [[Double-sided disk|double-sided]] drive mechanism, it had the ability to utilize double-sided, double-density (DS/DD) floppy disks natively. This was in contrast to its predecessors, the [[Commodore 1541|1541]] and [[Commodore 1570|1570]], which could read or write such disks only if the user manually [[Flippy disk|flipped them over]] to access the second side. (However, the two methods were not interchangeable; disk which had their back side created in a 1541 by flipping them over would have to be flipped in the 1571 too, and the back side of disks written in a 1571 using the native support for two-sided operation could not be read in a 1541).

The 1571 was released to match the [[Commodore 128]], both design-wise and feature-wise. It was announced in the summer of [[1985]], at the same time as the C128, and became available in quantity later that year. The later C128''D'' had a 1571-compatible drive integrated in the system unit. A double-sided disk on the 1571 would have a capacity of 340 [[kilobyte|KB]] (70 tracks, 1,360 disk blocks of 256 [[byte]]s each); as 8 KB are reserved for system use (directory and block availability information) and, under CBM DOS, 2 bytes of each block serve as pointers to the next logical block, 254 x 1,328 = 337,312 [[byte|B]] or about 329.4 KB were available for user data. (However, with a program organizing disk storage on its own, all space could be used, e.g. for data disks.)

Depending on format, CP/M disks would format to 360 KB, with a mechanical maximum capacity of a 400 KB format (as with DD 5.25&quot; drives generally). 

The 1571 featured a &quot;burst mode&quot; when used in conjunction with the C128 (although not when used with the [[Commodore 64]] or [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]]). This mode replaced the slow [[bit-banging]] serial routines of the 1541 with a true serial [[shift register]] implemented in hardware, thus dramatically increasing the drive speed. Although this originally had been planned when Commodore first switched from the parallel [[IEEE-488]] interface to a custom serial interface, hardware bugs in the VIC-20's [[MOS Technology 6522|6522 VIA]] shift register prevented it from working properly [http://www.binarydinosaurs.co.uk/Museum/Commodore/c64/c64notes.php].

For compatibility with copy-protected software, the 1571 could closely emulate the 1541. This mode was the default when the drive was used in conjunction with a C64; while always being able to read and write the 1541's GCR format of 170 KB DD single-sided, in this mode it also would format disks single-sided and transfer data at 1541 speed.  An undocumented command allowed the drive to format and use the second side of a disk, but only in single-sided mode.

The 1571 was noticeably quieter than its predecessor and tended to run cooler as well, even though, like the 1541, it had an internal power supply (later Commodore drives, like the 1541-II and the 3½&quot; [[Commodore 1581|1581]], came with external power supplies). The 1541-II/1581 power supply makes mention of a 1571-II, hinting that Commodore may have intended to release a version of the 1571 with an external power supply. However, no 1571-IIs are known to exist. The embedded OS in the 1571 was [[Commodore DOS|CBM DOS V3.0 1571]], an improvement over the 1541's V2.6.

Early 1571s had a bug in the ROM-based disk operating system that caused relative files to corrupt if they occupied both sides of the disk.  A version 2 ROM was released, but though it cured the initial bug, it introduced some minor quirks of its own - particularly with the 1541 emulation.  Curiously, it was also identified as V3.0.

Unlike the 1541, which was limited to [[Group Code Recording|GCR]] formatting, the 1571 could do both GCR and [[MFM]] disk formats. A C128 in CP/M mode equipped with a 1571 was capable of reading and writing floppy disks formatted for many [[CP/M]] computers; specifically, the following formats:

* [[IBM PC]] [[CP/M-86]]
* [[Osborne 1]]
* [[Epson]] QX10
* [[Kaypro]] II, IV
* CBM CP/M FORMAT SS 
* CBM CP/M FORMAT DS

Other MFM formats were possible if their characteristics were added to the CP/M C128-specific source code (available from Commodore) and the CP/M operating system were re-assembled. However, booting CP/M was only supported from disks in the standard Commodore GCR format; the MFM formats could only be used once the system was running.

With additional software, it was possible to read and write to [[DOS]]-formatted floppies as well. Numerous commercial and public-domain programs for this purpose became available, the best-known being [[SOGWAP]]'s &quot;Big Blue Reader&quot;. Although the C128 could not run any DOS-based software, this capability allowed data files to be exchanged with PC users. Reading [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 8-bit]] 130kB or 180kB disks was possible as well with special software, but the standard Atari 8-bit 90kB format, which used FM rather than MFM encoding, could not be handled by the 1571 hardware without modifying the drive circuitry as the control line that determines if FM or MFM encoding is used by the disc controller chip was permanently wired to ground (MFM mode) rather than being under software control.

As with the 1541, Commodore initially could not meet demand for the 1571, and that lack of availability and the drive's relatively high price (about US$300) presented an opportunity for cloners. Two 1571 clones appeared, one from Oceanic and one from Blue Chip, but legal action from Commodore quickly drove them from the market.

Commodore announced a dual-drive version of the 1571, to be called the [[Commodore 1572|1572]], but quickly cancelled it, reportedly due to technical difficulties with the 1572 DOS.

The 1571 built into the European plastic-case C128 D computer is electronically identical to the stand-alone version, but 1571 version integrated into the later metal-case C128 D (often called C128 DCR, for D Cost Reduced) differs a lot from the stand-alone 1571. It includes a newer DOS, version 3.1, replaces the [[MOS Technology CIA]] interface chip, of which only a few features were used by the 1571 DOS, with a very much simplified chip called 5710, and has some compatibility issues with the stand-alone drive. Because this internal 1571 does not have an unused 8-bit input/output port on any chip, unlike most other Commodore drives, it is not possible to install a parallel cable in this drive, such as that used by [[SpeedDOS]], [[Dolphin DOS]] and some other fast third-party Commodore DOS replacements.

In the 1541 format, while 40 tracks are possible for a 5.25&quot; DD drive like the 154x/157x, only 35 tracks are used. Commodore chose not to use the upper five tracks by default (or at least to use more than 35) due to the bad quality of some of the drive mechanisms, which did not always work reliably on those tracks. By reducing the number of tracks used (and thus the capacity), Commodore could further reduce cost - in contrast to the double-density drives used e.g. in IBM PCs of the day which saved 180 KB on one side (by using a 40-track format).

For compatibility and ease of implementation, the 1571's double-sided format of one logical disk side with 70 tracks was created by putting together the lower 35 physical tracks on each of the physical sides of the disk rather than using two times 40 tracks, even though there were no more quality problems with the mechanisms of the 1571 drives.

'''Cocaine (benzoylmethylecgonine)''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is a [[crystal]]line [[tropane]] [[alkaloid]] that is obtained from the leaves of the [[coca]] plant.&lt;ref name= aggrawal1&gt;Aggrawal, Anil. ''[[Narcotic|Narcotic Drugs]]''. National Book Trust, India (1995), p. 52-3. ISBN 978-81-237-1383-0.&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from &quot;coca&quot; in addition to the alkaloid suffix ''-ine'', forming ''cocaine''. It is a [[stimulant]] of the [[central nervous system]], an [[Anorectic|appetite suppressant]], and a [[topical anesthetic]]. Specifically, it is a [[serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor]], which mediates functionality of these neurotransmitters as an [[exogeny|exogenous]] [[catecholamine|catecholamine transporter]] [[ligand]]. Because of the way it affects the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic reward pathway]], cocaine is [[Substance use disorder|addictive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fattore L, Piras G, Corda MG, Giorgi O |title=The Roman high- and low-avoidance rat lines differ in the acquisition, maintenance, extinction, and reinstatement of intravenous cocaine self-administration |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=1091–101 |year=2009|pmid=18418365 |doi=10.1038/npp.2008.43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its possession, cultivation, and distribution are illegal for non-medicinal and non-government sanctioned purposes in virtually all parts of the world. Although its free commercialization is illegal and has been severely penalized in virtually all countries, its use worldwide remains widespread in many social, cultural, and personal settings.

== Medical effects ==
[[File:Rational scale to assess the harm of drugs (mean physical harm and mean dependence).svg|thumb|250px|Data from ''[[The Lancet]]'' suggests cocaine is ranked both the 2nd most addictive and the 2nd most harmful of 20 popular [[recreational drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|17382831}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Cocaine is a powerful nervous system stimulant.&lt;ref name=WHO2004&gt;World Health Organization (2004). [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G9OhG-dZdAwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA89#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Neuroscience of psychoactive substance use and dependence]&lt;/ref&gt; Its effects can last from 15–30&amp;nbsp;minutes to an hour, depending upon the method of ingestion.&lt;ref name=WHO2007&gt;World Health Organization (2007).

Cocaine increases alertness, feelings of well-being and euphoria, energy and motor activity, feelings of competence and sexuality. Athletic performance may be enhanced in sports where sustained attention and endurance is required. Anxiety, paranoia and restlessness are also frequent. With excessive dosage, tremors, convulsions and increased body temperature are observed.&lt;ref name=WHO2004/&gt;

Health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater than health problems from cocaine use. Occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{Ref improve section|date=June 2009}}
{{Main|Cocaine intoxication}}
With excessive or prolonged use, the drug can cause [[itch]]ing, [[tachycardia]], [[hallucination]]s, and [[formication|paranoid delusions]]. Overdoses cause [[cardiac arrhythmia|tachyarrhythmias]] and a marked elevation of blood pressure, which can be life-threatening.

=== Chronic ===
[[File:Side effects of chronic use of Cocaine.png|thumb|250px|Side effects of chronic cocaine use]]
[[File:Cocaine hydrochloride CII for medicinal use.jpg|thumb|upright|Cocaine hydrochloride]]
Chronic cocaine intake causes brain cells to adapt functionally to strong imbalances of transmitter levels in order to compensate extremes. Thus, receptors disappear from the cell surface or reappear on it, resulting more or less in an &quot;off&quot; or &quot;working mode&quot; respectively, or they change their susceptibility for binding partners (ligands){{ndash}} mechanisms called [[downregulation|down-]]/[[upregulation]]. However, studies suggest cocaine abusers do not show normal age-related loss of [[striatum|striatal]] [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT) sites, suggesting cocaine has neuroprotective properties for dopamine neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ZMSNFtyjtEAC&amp;pg=PA528&amp;lpg=PA528&amp;dq=neuroprotective+dat+cocaine |title=Biological Psychiatry By H.

Depression with suicidal ideation may develop in very heavy users. Finally, a loss of [[vesicular monoamine transporter]]s, neurofilament proteins, and other morphological changes appear to indicate a long term damage of dopamine neurons. All these effects contribute a rise in tolerance thus requiring a larger dosage to achieve the same effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Substance abuse: a comprehensive textbook |last=Lowinson |first=Joyce, H |coauthors=Ruiz, Pedro.

The lack of normal amounts of serotonin and dopamine in the brain is the cause of the dysphoria and depression felt after the initial high. Physical withdrawal is not dangerous, and is in fact restorative. Physiological changes caused by cocaine withdrawal include vivid and unpleasant dreams, insomnia or hypersomnia, increased appetite and psychomotor retardation or agitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Substance abuse: a comprehensive textbook |last=Lowinson |first=Joyce, H |coauthors=Ruiz, Pedro.

Physical side effects from chronic smoking of cocaine include hemoptysis, bronchospasm, pruritus, fever, diffuse alveolar infiltrates without effusions, pulmonary and systemic [[eosinophilia]], chest pain, lung trauma, sore throat, asthma, hoarse voice, [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath), and an aching, [[flu]]-like syndrome. A common but untrue belief is that the smoking of cocaine chemically breaks down [[tooth enamel]] and causes [[tooth decay]]. However, cocaine does often cause involuntary tooth grinding, known as [[bruxism]], which can deteriorate tooth enamel and lead to [[gingivitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baigent |first=Michael|year=2003|title=Physical complications of substance abuse: what the psychiatrist needs to know |journal=Curr Opin Psychiatry |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=291–296|doi=10.1097/00001504-200305000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronic intranasal usage can degrade the [[cartilage]] separating the [[nostrils]] (the [[septum nasi]]), leading eventually to its complete disappearance. Due to the absorption of the cocaine from cocaine hydrochloride, the remaining hydrochloride forms a dilute hydrochloric acid.&lt;ref name=&quot;pagliaros&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Louis|last=Pagliaro|coauthors=Ann Marie Pagliaro|title=Pagliaros’ Comprehensive Guide to Drugs and Substances of Abuse|publisher=[[American Pharmacists Association]]|location=Washington, D.C.|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58212-066-9|curly=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Addiction ===
{{Main|Cocaine dependence}}
Cocaine dependence (or '''addiction''') is psychological dependency on the regular use of cocaine. Cocaine dependency may result in physiological damage, lethargy, psychosis, depression, [[akathisia]], and fatal overdose.

== Biosynthesis ==
{{Main|Biosynthesis of cocaine}}
The first synthesis and elucidation of the '''cocaine''' molecule was by [[Richard Willstätter]] in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Humphrey AJ, O'Hagan D |title=Tropane alkaloid biosynthesis. A century old problem unresolved |journal=Nat Prod Rep |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=494–502 |year=2001|pmid=11699882 |doi=10.1039/b001713m}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willstätter's synthesis derived cocaine from [[tropinone]]. Since then, [[Robert Robinson (scientist)|Robert Robinson]] and Edward Leete have made significant contributions to the mechanism of the synthesis.

=== Biosynthesis of ''N''-methyl-pyrrolinium cation ===
[[File:Biosynthesis of N-methyl-pyrrolinium cation.png|right|thumb|Biosynthesis of ''N''-methyl-pyrrolinium cation]]
[[File:Biosynthesis of cocaine.png|thumb|right|Biosynthesis of cocaine]]
[[File:Robinson biosynthesis of tropane.png|right|thumb|Robinson biosynthesis of tropane]]
[[File:Reduction of tropinone.png|right|thumb|Reduction of tropinone]]

The [[biosynthesis]] begins with L-[[Glutamine]], which is derived to L-[[ornithine]] in plants. The major contribution of L-ornithine and L-[[arginine]] as a precursor to the [[tropane]] ring was confirmed by Edward Leete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leete E, Marion L, Sspenser ID |title=Biogenesis of hyoscyamine |journal=Nature |volume=174 |issue=4431 |pages=650–1 |year=1954 |pmid=13203600 |doi=10.1038/174650a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ornithine then undergoes a [[Pyridoxal phosphate]]-dependent decarboxylation to form putrescine. In animals, however, the urea cycle derives putrescine from ornithine. L-ornithine is converted to L-arginine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robins RJ, Waltons NJ, Hamill JD, Parr AJ, Rhodes MJ |title=Strategies for the genetic manipulation of alkaloid-producing pathways in plants |journal=Planta Med. |volume=57 |issue=7 Suppl |pages=S27–35 |year=1991 |pmid=17226220 |doi=10.1055/s-2006-960226}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is then decarboxylated via PLP to form agmatine. Hydrolysis of the imine derives ''N''-carbamoylputrescine followed with hydrolysis of the urea to form putrescine. The separate pathways of converting ornithine to putrescine in plants and animals have converged. A SAM-dependent ''N''-methylation of putrescine gives the ''N''-methylputrescine product, which then undergoes oxidative deamination by the action of diamine oxidase to yield the aminoaldehyde. Schiff base formation confirms the biosynthesis of the ''N''-methyl-Δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-pyrrolinium cation.

=== Biosynthesis of cocaine ===
The additional carbon atoms required for the synthesis of cocaine are derived from acetyl-CoA, by addition of two acetyl-CoA units to the ''N''-methyl-Δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-pyrrolinium cation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dewick, P. M. |title=Medicinal Natural Products |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Chicester|year=2009 |isbn=978-0-470-74276-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first addition is a [[Mannich reaction|Mannich]]-like reaction with the enolate anion from acetyl-CoA acting as a [[nucleophile]] towards the pyrrolinium cation. The second addition occurs through a Claisen condensation. This produces a racemic mixture of the 2-substituted pyrrolidine, with the retention of the thioester from the Claisen condensation. In formation of [[tropinone]] from [[racemic]] ethyl [2,3-13C2]4(Nmethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-3-oxobutanoate there is no preference for either stereoisomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ja964461p|title = The Biosynthesis of Tropane Alkaloids in Datura stramonium: The Identity of the Intermediates between ''N''-Methylpyrrolinium Salt and Tropinone|year = 1997|author = R. J. Robins, T. W. Abraham, A. J. Parr, J. Eagles and N. J. Walton|journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc.|volume = 119|page = 10929}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the biosynthesis of cocaine, however, only the (S)-enantiomer can cyclize to form the tropane ring system of cocaine. The stereoselectivity of this reaction was further investigated through study of prochiral methylene hydrogen discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hoye TR, Bjorklund JA, Koltun DO, Renner MK |title=''N''-methylputrescine oxidation during cocaine biosynthesis: study of prochiral methylene hydrogen discrimination using the remote isotope method |journal=Org. Lett. |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=3–5 |year=2000|pmid=10814231 |doi=10.1021/ol990940s}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the extra chiral center at C-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ja00024a039|title = Late intermediates in the biosynthesis of cocaine: 4-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-3-oxobutanoate and methyl ecgonine|year = 1991|author = E. Leete, J. A. Bjorklund, M. M. Couladis and S. H. Kim|journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc.|volume = 113|page = 9286}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process occurs through an oxidation, which regenerates the pyrrolinium cation and formation of an enolate anion, and an intramolecular Mannich reaction. The tropane ring system undergoes [[hydrolysis]], SAM-dependent methylation, and reduction via [[NADPH]] for the formation of methylecgonine. The [[benzoyl]] moiety required for the formation of the cocaine diester is synthesized from phenylalanine via cinnamic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/0031-9422(88)87026-2|title = The biosynthesis of the benzoyl moiety of cocaine|year = 1988|author = E.

=== Robert Robinson's acetonedicarboxylate ===
The biosynthesis of the [[tropane alkaloid]], however, is still uncertain. Hemscheidt proposes that Robinson's acetonedicarboxylate emerges as a potential intermediate for this reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/3-540-48146-X|title = Tropane and Related Alkaloids|year = 2000|author = T.

Decarboxylation leads to tropane alkaloid formation.

=== Reduction of tropinone ===
The reduction of tropinone is mediated by [[NADPH]]-dependent reductase enzymes, which have been characterized in multiple plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/0031-9422(92)80247-C|title = Two tropinone reducing enzymes from Datura stramonium transformed root cultures|year = 1992|author = A.

TRI produces tropine and TRII produces pseudotropine. Due to differing kinetic and pH/activity characteristics of the enzymes and by the 25-fold higher activity of TRI over TRII, the majority of the tropinone reduction is from TRI to form tropine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Boswell HD, Dräger B, McLauchlan WR |title=Specificities of the enzymes of ''N''-alkyltropane biosynthesis in Brugmansia and Datura |journal=Phytochemistry |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=871–8 |year=1999|pmid=10626376 |doi=10.1016/S0031-9422(99)00293-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cocaine in its purest form is a white, pearly product. Cocaine appearing in powder form is a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]], typically cocaine [[hydrochloride]] ([[CAS registry number|CAS]] 53-21-4). Street market cocaine is frequently adulterated or “cut” with various powdery fillers to increase its weight; the substances most commonly used in this process are [[baking soda]]; sugars, such as [[lactose]], [[dextrose]], [[inositol]], and [[mannitol]]; and local anesthetics, such as [[lidocaine]] or [[benzocaine]], which mimic or add to cocaine's numbing effect on mucous membranes. Cocaine may also be &quot;cut&quot; with other stimulants such as [[methamphetamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://designer-drugs.com/pte/12.162.180.114/dcd/chemistry/psychedelicchemistry/chapter8.html|title=Psychedelic Chemistry: Cocaine|accessdate=2007-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adulterated cocaine is often a white, off-white or pinkish powder.

The color of [[crack cocaine|“crack” cocaine]] depends upon several factors including the origin of the cocaine used, the method of preparation – with [[ammonia]] or [[baking soda]] – and the presence of impurities, but will generally range from white to a yellowish cream to a light brown. Its texture will also depend on the adulterants, origin and processing of the powdered cocaine, and the method of converting the base. It ranges from a crumbly texture, sometimes extremely oily, to a hard, almost crystalline nature.

=== Forms of cocaine ===
==== Salts ====
Cocaine is a weakly alkaline compound (an &quot;alkaloid&quot;), and can therefore combine with acidic compounds to form various salts. The hydrochloride (HCl) salt of cocaine is by far the most commonly encountered, although the sulfate (-SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and the nitrate (-NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are occasionally seen. Different salts dissolve to a greater or lesser extent in various solvents - the hydrochloride salt is polar in character and is quite soluble in water.

==== Basic ====
{{Main|Freebase (chemistry)}}
As the name implies, “freebase” is the [[base (chemistry)|base]] form of cocaine, as opposed to the [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] form. It is practically insoluble in water whereas hydrochloride salt is water soluble.

Smoking freebase cocaine has the additional effect of releasing [[methylecgonidine]] into the user's system due to the [[pyrolysis]] of the substance (a side effect which insufflating or injecting powder cocaine does not create). Some research suggests that smoking freebase cocaine can be even more cardiotoxic than other [[routes of administration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scheidweiler|url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/307/3/1179/F6.expansion|first1=K.

Pure cocaine is prepared by neutralizing its compounding salt with an alkaline solution which will precipitate to non-polar basic cocaine. It is further refined through aqueous-solvent [[Liquid-liquid extraction]].

==== Crack cocaine ====
{{Main|Crack cocaine}}

[[File:Smoking Crack.jpg|thumb|A woman smoking crack cocaine]]
Crack is a lower purity form of free-base cocaine that is usually produced by neutralization of cocaine hydrochloride with a solution of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and water, producing a very hard/brittle, off-white-to-brown colored, amorphous material that contains sodium carbonate, entrapped water, and other by-products as the main impurities.

The &quot;freebase&quot; and &quot;crack&quot; forms of cocaine are usually administered by vaporization of the powdered substance into smoke, which is then inhaled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/chibps/cocaine &quot;Substances – Cocaine&quot; The Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development]. Retrieved August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the name &quot;crack&quot; comes from the &quot;crackling&quot; sound (and hence the [[onomatopoeic]] moniker “crack”) that is produced when the cocaine and its impurities (i.e. water, sodium bicarbondate) are heated past the point of vaporization.&lt;ref&gt;George, Nelson. &quot;Hip Hop America&quot;. 1998. Viking Penguin.(Page 40)&lt;/ref&gt; Pure cocaine base/crack is easy to smoke because it vaporizes smoothly, with little or no decomposition at around 98 degrees Centigrade, which is below the boiling point of water. The smoke produced from cocaine base is usually described as having a very distinctive, pleasant taste. 

In contrast, cocaine hydrochloride does not vaporize until heated to a much higher temperature (about 197 degrees Centigrade), and considerable decomposition/burning occurs at these high temperatures. This effectively destroys some of the cocaine, and yields a sharp, acrid, and foul-tasting smoke.

Smoking or vaporizing cocaine and inhaling it into the lungs produces an almost immediate &quot;high&quot; that can be very powerful (and addicting) quite rapidly - this initial crescendo of stimulation is known as a &quot;rush&quot;.

==== Coca leaf infusions ====
Coca herbal [[infusion]] (also referred to as [[Coca tea]]) is used in coca-leaf producing countries much as any herbal medicinal infusion would elsewhere in the world. The free and legal commercialization of dried coca leaves under the form of filtration bags to be used as &quot;coca tea&quot; has been actively promoted by the governments of [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] for many years as a drink having medicinal powers. Visitors to the city of [[Cuzco]] in Peru, and [[La Paz]] in Bolivia are greeted with the offering of coca leaf infusions (prepared in tea pots with whole coca leaves) purportedly to help the newly arrived traveler overcome the malaise of high altitude sickness. The effects of drinking coca tea are a mild stimulation and mood lift. It does not produce any significant numbing of the mouth nor does it give a rush like snorting cocaine. In order to prevent the demonization of this product, its promoters publicize the unproven concept that much of the effect of the ingestion of coca leaf infusion would come from the secondary alkaloids, as being not only quantitatively different from pure cocaine but also qualitatively different.

It has been promoted as an adjuvant for the treatment of cocaine dependence. In one controversial study, coca leaf infusion was used -in addition to counseling- to treat 23 addicted coca-paste smokers in [[Lima]], Peru. Relapses fell from an average of four times per month before treatment with coca tea to one during the treatment. The duration of abstinence increased from an average of 32 days prior to treatment to 217 days during treatment. These results suggest that the administration of coca leaf infusion plus counseling would be an effective method for preventing relapse during treatment for cocaine addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Teobaldo, Llosa|title=The Standard Low Dose of Oral Cocaine: Used for Treatment of Cocaine Dependence|journal=Substance Abuse|year=1994|volume=15|issue=4|pages=215–220|curly=true |issn=0889-7077 | url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/library/prellos.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, these results also suggest strongly that the primary pharmacologically active metabolite in coca leaf infusions is actually cocaine and not the secondary alkaloids.

The cocaine metabolite [[benzoylecgonine]] can be detected in the urine of people a few hours after drinking one cup of coca leaf infusion.

=== Routes of administration ===
==== Oral ====
[[File:Crack Crack.JPG|thumb|A spoon containing baking soda, cocaine, and a small amount of water. Used in a &quot;poor-man's&quot; crack-cocaine production]]

Many users rub the powder along the gum line, or onto a cigarette filter which is then smoked, which numbs the gums and teeth – hence the colloquial names of &quot;numbies&quot;, &quot;gummers&quot; or &quot;cocoa puffs&quot; for this type of administration. This is mostly done with the small amounts of cocaine remaining on a surface after insufflation. Another oral method is to wrap up some cocaine in rolling paper and swallow ([[Parachute (drugs)|parachute]]) it. This is sometimes called a &quot;snow bomb.&quot;

===== Coca leaf =====
Coca leaves are typically mixed with an alkaline substance (such as lime) and chewed into a wad that is retained in the mouth between gum and cheek (much in the same as [[chewing tobacco]] is chewed) and sucked of its juices. The juices are absorbed slowly by the mucous membrane of the inner cheek and by the gastrointestinal tract when swallowed. Alternatively, coca leaves can be infused in liquid and consumed like tea. Ingesting coca leaves generally is an inefficient means of administering cocaine. Advocates of the consumption of the coca leaf state that coca leaf consumption should not be criminalized as it is not actual cocaine, and consequently it is not properly the illicit drug. Because cocaine is hydrolyzed and rendered inactive in the acidic stomach, it is not readily absorbed when ingested alone. Only when mixed with a highly alkaline substance (such as lime) can it be absorbed into the bloodstream through the stomach. The efficiency of absorption of orally administered cocaine is limited by two additional factors. First, the drug is partly catabolized by the liver. Second, capillaries in the mouth and esophagus constrict after contact with the drug, reducing the surface area over which the drug can be absorbed. Nevertheless, cocaine metabolites can be detected in the urine of subjects that have sipped even one cup of coca leaf infusion. Therefore, this is an actual additional form of administration of cocaine, albeit an inefficient one.

Orally administered cocaine takes approximately 30&amp;nbsp;minutes to enter the bloodstream. Typically, only a third of an oral dose is absorbed, although absorption has been shown to reach 60% in controlled settings. Given the slow rate of absorption, maximum [[physiological]] and [[psychotropic]] effects are attained approximately 60&amp;nbsp;minutes after cocaine is administered by ingestion. While the onset of these effects is slow, the effects are sustained for approximately 60&amp;nbsp;minutes after their peak is attained.

Contrary to popular belief, both ingestion and insufflation result in approximately the same proportion of the drug being absorbed: 30 to 60%. Compared to ingestion, the faster absorption of insufflated cocaine results in quicker attainment of maximum drug effects. Snorting cocaine produces maximum physiological effects within 40&amp;nbsp;minutes and maximum psychotropic effects within 20&amp;nbsp;minutes, however, a more realistic activation period is closer to 5 to 10&amp;nbsp;minutes, which is similar to ingestion of cocaine. Physiological and psychotropic effects from nasally insufflated cocaine are sustained for approximately 40–60&amp;nbsp;minutes after the peak effects are attained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Barnett | first1= G | last2= Hawks | first2= R | last3= Resnick | first3= R | title= Cocaine pharmacokinetics in humans. | journal= Journal of ethnopharmacology | volume= 3 | issue= 2-3 | pages= 353–66 | year= 1981 | pmid= 7242115 | doi=10.1016/0378-8741(81)90063-5 }}; Jones, supra note 19; Wilkinson ''et al.'', Van Dyke ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Mate de coca]]'' or coca-leaf infusion is also a traditional method of consumption and is often recommended in coca producing countries, like Peru and Bolivia, to ameliorate some symptoms of [[altitude sickness]]. This method of consumption has been practiced for many centuries by the native tribes of South America. One specific purpose of ancient coca leaf consumption was to increase energy and reduce fatigue in messengers who made multi-day quests to other settlements.

In 1986 an article in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' revealed that U.S. [[health food store]]s were selling dried coca leaves to be prepared as an infusion as “Health Inca Tea.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Siegel RK, Elsohly MA, Plowman T, Rury PM, Jones RT|title=Cocaine in herbal tea|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=January 3, 1986|volume=255|issue=1| page=40 |curly=true|doi=10.1001/jama.255.1.40|pmid=3940302}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the packaging claimed it had been &quot;decocainized,&quot; no such process had actually taken place. The article stated that drinking two cups of the tea per day gave a mild [[stimulation]], increased [[heart rate]], and [[Emotional mood|mood]] elevation, and the tea was essentially harmless. Despite this, the [[Drug Enforcement Agency|DEA]] seized several shipments in [[Hawaii]], [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and several locations on the [[East Coast of the United States]], and the product was removed from the shelves.

==== Insufflation ====
[[File:Man sniffing.jpg|thumb|A man sniffing cocaine]]
Nasal [[Insufflation (medicine)|Insufflation]] (known colloquially as &quot;snorting,&quot; &quot;sniffing,&quot; or &quot;blowing&quot;) is the most common method of ingestion of recreational powdered cocaine in the Western world. The drug coats and is absorbed through the [[mucous membrane]]s lining the [[Paranasal sinus|sinuses]]. When insufflating cocaine, absorption through the nasal membranes is approximately 30–60%, with higher doses leading to increased absorption efficiency. Any material not directly absorbed through the mucous membranes is collected in [[mucus]] and swallowed (this &quot;drip&quot; is considered pleasant by some and unpleasant by others). In a study&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkow&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of cocaine users, the average time taken to reach peak subjective effects was 14.6&amp;nbsp;minutes. Any damage to the inside of the nose is because cocaine highly constricts blood vessels{{ndash}} and therefore blood and oxygen/nutrient flow{{ndash}} to that area. Nosebleeds after cocaine insufflation are due to irritation and damage of mucus membranes by foreign particles and adulterants and not the cocaine itself; as a vasoconstrictor, cocaine acts to reduce bleeding.

Prior to insufflation, cocaine powder must be divided into very fine particles. Cocaine of high purity breaks into fine dust very easily, except when it is moist (not well stored) and forms &quot;chunks,&quot; which reduces the efficiency of nasal absorption.

Rolled up [[currency|banknotes]], hollowed-out [[pen]]s, cut [[drinking straw|straws]], pointed ends of keys, [[cocaine spoon|specialized spoons]], long [[fingernails]], and (clean) tampon applicators are often used to insufflate cocaine. Such devices are often called &quot;tooters&quot; by users. The cocaine typically is poured onto a flat, hard surface (such as a [[mirror]], CD case or book) and divided into &quot;bumps&quot;, &quot;lines&quot; or &quot;rails&quot;, and then insufflated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/cocaine.asp#Terminology cesar.umd.edu] – Cocaine terminology&lt;/ref&gt; As tolerance builds rapidly in the short-term (hours), many lines are often snorted to produce greater effects.

In the United States, as far back as 1992 many of the people sentenced by federal authorities for charges related to powder cocaine were [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]]; more Hispanics than non-Hispanic [[White American|White]] and non-Hispanic [[African American|Black]] people received sentences for crimes related to powder cocaine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.summerhousedetoxcenter.com/blog/archives/29 |title=White Powder Cocaine No Longer Just for Yuppies - Summer House |format= |work= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Injection ====
[[Drug injection]] provides the highest blood levels of drug in the shortest amount of time. Subjective effects not commonly shared with other methods of administration include a ringing in the ears moments after injection (usually when in excess of 120 milligrams) lasting 2 to 5&amp;nbsp;minutes including [[tinnitus]] &amp; audio distortion. This is colloquially referred to as a &quot;bell ringer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bell+ringer |title=Bell ringer |publisher=Urban Dictionary |accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkow&quot; /&gt; of cocaine users, the average time taken to reach peak subjective effects was 3.1&amp;nbsp;minutes. The euphoria passes quickly. Aside from the toxic effects of cocaine, there is also danger of circulatory [[embolism|emboli]] from the insoluble substances that may be used to cut the drug. As with all injected illicit substances, there is a risk of the user contracting blood-borne infections if sterile injecting equipment is not available or used.

An injected mixture of cocaine and [[heroin]], known as “[[speedball (drug)|speedball]]” is a particularly dangerous combination, as the converse effects of the drugs actually complement each other, but may also mask the symptoms of an overdose. It has been responsible for numerous deaths, including celebrities such as [[John Belushi]], [[Chris Farley]], [[Mitch Hedberg]], [[River Phoenix]] and [[Layne Staley]].

Experimentally, cocaine injections can be delivered to animals such as [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] to study the mechanisms of cocaine addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Dimitrijevic N, Dzitoyeva S, Manev H|title=An automated assay of the behavioral effects of cocaine injections in adult Drosophila|journal=J Neurosci Methods|year=2004|volume=137|issue=2|pages=181–184|pmid=15262059|curly=1|doi=10.1016/j.jneumeth.2004.02.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Inhalation ====
{{See also|Crack cocaine}}
Inhalation or smoking is one of the several means cocaine is administered. Cocaine is smoked by inhaling the vapor by sublimating solid cocaine by heating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/9712/appb.htm Appendix B: Production of Cocaine Hydrochloride and Cocaine Base], US Justice Dep.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2000 Brookhaven National Laboratory medical department study, based on self reports of 32 abusers who participated in the study,&quot;peak high&quot; was found at mean of 1.4min +/- 0.5&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkow&quot; /&gt;

Smoking freebase or crack cocaine is most often accomplished using a pipe made from a small glass tube, often taken from &quot;[[Love rose]]s,&quot; small glass tubes with a paper rose that are promoted as romantic gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.journalstar.com/news/local/article_28e66c86-1ef8-52dc-ac0a-f3933ed6ec5a.html|title=A rose by another name: crack pipe|newspaper=[[Lincoln Journal Star]]|author=Margaret Reist|date=January 16, 2005|accessdate=2009-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are sometimes called &quot;stems&quot;, &quot;horns&quot;, &quot;blasters&quot; and &quot;straight shooters&quot;. A small piece of clean heavy copper or occasionally stainless steel scouring pad{{ndash}} often called a [[Brillo Pad|&quot;brillo&quot;]] (actual Brillo pads contain soap, and are not used), or [[Chore Boy|&quot;chore&quot;]], named for ''Chore Boy'' brand copper scouring pads,{{ndash}} serves as a reduction base and flow modulator in which the &quot;rock&quot; can be melted and boiled to vapor. Crack smokers also sometimes smoke through a [[soda can]] with small holes in the bottom.

Crack is smoked by placing it at the end of the pipe; a flame held close to it produces vapor, which is then inhaled by the smoker. The effects, felt almost immediately after smoking, are very intense and do not last long{{ndash}} usually 5 to 15 minutes.

When smoked, cocaine is sometimes combined with other drugs, such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], often rolled into a joint or [[blunt (drug culture)|blunt]]. Powdered cocaine is also sometimes smoked, though heat destroys much of the chemical; smokers often sprinkle it on [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].

The language referring to paraphernalia and practices of smoking cocaine vary, as do the packaging methods in the street level sale.

==== Suppository ====
Little research has been focused on the [[suppository]] (anal or vaginal insertion) method of administration, also known as &quot;plugging&quot;. This method of administration is commonly administered using an [[oral syringe]]. Cocaine can be dissolved in water and withdrawn into an oral syringe which may then be lubricated and inserted into the anus or vagina before the plunger is pushed. Anecdotal evidence of its effects are infrequently discussed, possibly due to social taboos in many cultures. The rectum and the vaginal canal is where the majority of the drug would likely be taken up, through the membranes lining its walls.

=== Physical mechanisms ===
[[File:DAT1regulation.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Cocaine binds directly to the [[Dopamine transporter|DAT1]] transporter, inhibiting reuptake with more efficacy than [[amphetamines]] which [[phosphorylation|phosphorylate]] it causing [[Internalization#Biology|internalization]]; instead primarily releasing DAT (which cocaine does not do) and only inhibiting its reuptake as a secondary, and much more minor, mode of action than cocaine and in another manner: from the opposite conformation/orientation to DAT.]]
The pharmacodynamics of cocaine involve the complex relationships of neurotransmitters (inhibiting [[monoamine]] uptake in rats with ratios of about: [[5HT|serotonin]]:[[dopamine]] = 2:3, serotonin:[[norepinephrine]] = 2:5&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, et al. &quot;Amphetamine-Type Central Nervous System Stimulants Release Norepinepehrine more Potently than they Release [[Dopamine]] and [[Serotonin]].&quot; (2001): Synapse ''39'', 32-41 (Table V. on page 37)&lt;/ref&gt;) The most extensively studied effect of cocaine on the [[central nervous system]] is the blockade of the [[dopamine transporter]] protein. Dopamine [[transmitter]] released during neural signaling is normally recycled via the transporter; i.e., the transporter binds the transmitter and pumps it out of the synaptic cleft back into the [[presynaptic]] neuron, where it is taken up into storage [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]]. Cocaine binds tightly at the dopamine transporter forming a complex that blocks the transporter's function. The dopamine transporter can no longer perform its reuptake function, and thus [[dopamine]] accumulates in the [[synaptic cleft]]. This results in an enhanced and prolonged postsynaptic effect of [[dopaminergic]] signaling at dopamine receptors on the receiving neuron. Prolonged exposure to cocaine, as occurs with habitual use, leads to homeostatic dysregulation of normal (i.e. without cocaine) dopaminergic signaling via down-regulation of dopamine receptors and enhanced [[signal transduction]]. The decreased dopaminergic signaling after chronic cocaine use may contribute to depressive mood disorders and sensitize this important brain reward circuit to the reinforcing effects of cocaine (for example, enhanced dopaminergic signalling only when cocaine is self-administered). This sensitization contributes to the intractable nature of addiction and relapse.

Dopamine-rich brain regions such as the ventral tegmental area, [[nucleus accumbens]], and prefrontal [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] are frequent targets of cocaine addiction research. Of particular interest is the pathway consisting of dopaminergic neurons originating in the ventral tegmental area that terminate in the nucleus accumbens. This projection may function as a &quot;reward center&quot;, in that it seems to show activation in response to drugs of abuse like cocaine in addition to natural rewards like food or sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10529820&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spanagel R, Weiss F |title=The dopamine hypothesis of reward: past and current status |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=22 |issue=11 |pages=521–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10529820 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(99)01447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the precise role of dopamine in the subjective experience of reward is highly controversial among neuroscientists, the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens is widely considered to be at least partially responsible for cocaine's rewarding effects. This hypothesis is largely based on laboratory data involving rats that are trained to self-administer cocaine. If dopamine antagonists are infused directly into the nucleus accumbens, well-trained rats self-administering cocaine will undergo extinction (i.e. initially increase responding only to stop completely) thereby indicating that cocaine is no longer reinforcing (i.e. rewarding) the drug-seeking behavior. &lt;!-- which of these are the pleasure centers? --&gt;

Cocaine's effects on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) show across multiple serotonin receptors, and is shown to inhibit the re-uptake of [[5-HT3 receptor|5-HT3]] specifically as an important contributor to the effects of cocaine.

In addition to the mechanism shown on the above chart, cocaine has been demonstrated to bind as to directly stabilize the DAT transporter on the open outward-facing conformation whereas other stimulants (namely phenethylamines) stabilize the closed conformation. Further, cocaine binds in such a way as to inhibit a hydrogen bond innate to DAT that otherwise still forms when amphetamine and similar molecules are bound. Cocaine's binding properties are such that it attaches so this hydrogen bond will not form and is blocked from formation due to the tightly locked orientation of the cocaine molecule. Research studies have suggested that the affinity for the transporter is not what is involved in habituation of the substance so much as the conformation and binding properties to where &amp; how on the transporter the molecule binds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: author=Beuming T ''et al.''|author=Nature Neuroscience |url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v11/n7/fig_tab/nn.2146_F1.html |doi=10.1038/nn.2146|title=The binding sites for cocaine and dopamine in the dopamine transporter overlap|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=11|page=780|year=2008|pmid=18568020|last2=Kniazeff|first2=J|last3=Bergmann|first3=ML|last4=Shi|first4=L|last5=Gracia|first5=L|last6=Raniszewska|first6=K|last7=Newman|first7=AH|last8=Javitch|first8=JA|last9=Weinstein|first9=H|issue=7|pmc=2692229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigma receptor]]s are effected by cocaine, as cocaine functions as a sigma ligand agonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/05/030506073758.htm |title=Sigma Receptors Play Role In Cocaine-induced Suppression Of Immune System |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2003-05-06 |accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further specific receptors it has been demonstrated to function on are [[NMDA]] and the D1 dopamine receptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lluch J, Rodríguez-Arias M, Aguilar MA, Miñarro J |title=Role of dopamine and glutamate receptors in cocaine-induced social effects in isolated and grouped male OF1 mice |journal=Pharmacol.

Cocaine also blocks [[ion channel|sodium channels]], thereby interfering with the propagation of [[action potential]]s; thus, like [[lignocaine]] and [[novocaine]], it acts as a local anesthetic. It also functions on the binding sites to the dopamine &amp; serotonin sodium dependent transport area as targets as separate mechanisms from its reuptake of those transporters; unique to its local anesthetic value which makes it in a class of functionality different from both its own derived phenyltropanes analogues which have that removed and the amphetamine class of stimulants which as well altogether lack that. In addition to this cocaine has some target binding to the site of the Kappa-opioid receptor as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00907 |title=Drugbank website &quot;drug card&quot;, &quot;(DB00907)&quot; for Cocaine: Giving ten targets of the molecule in vivo, including dopamine/serotonin sodium channel affinity &amp; K-opioid affinity |publisher=Drugbank.ca |accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cocaine also causes [[vasoconstriction]], thus reducing bleeding during minor surgical procedures. The locomotor enhancing properties of cocaine may be attributable to its enhancement of dopaminergic transmission from the [[substantia nigra]]. Recent research points to an important role of circadian mechanisms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Uz T, Akhisaroglu M, Ahmed R, Manev H|title = The pineal gland is critical for circadian Period1 expression in the striatum and for circadian cocaine sensitization in mice|journal = Neuropsychopharmacology|volume = 28|issue = 12|pages = 2117–23|year = 2003|pmid = 12865893|doi = 10.1038/sj.npp.1300254}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[clock genes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = McClung C, Sidiropoulou K, Vitaterna M, Takahashi J, White F, Cooper D, Nestler E|title = Regulation of dopaminergic transmission and cocaine reward by the Clock gene|journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume = 102|issue = 26|pages = 9377–81|year = 2005|pmid = 15967985|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0503584102|pmc = 1166621}}&lt;/ref&gt; in behavioral actions of cocaine.

Because [[nicotine]] increases the levels of dopamine in the brain, many cocaine users find that consumption of [[tobacco]] products during cocaine use enhances the euphoria. This, however, may have undesirable consequences, such as uncontrollable [[chain smoking]] during cocaine use (even users who do not normally smoke [[cigarettes]] have been known to chain smoke when using cocaine), in addition to the detrimental health effects and the additional strain on the cardiovascular system caused by tobacco.

In addition to irritability, mood disturbances, restlessness, paranoia, and auditory hallucinations, cocaine use can cause several dangerous physical conditions. It can lead to disturbances in heart rhythm and heart attacks, as well as chest pains or even respiratory failure. In addition, strokes, seizures and headaches are common in heavy users.

Cocaine can often cause reduced food intake, many chronic users lose their appetite and can experience severe malnutrition and significant weight loss. Cocaine effects, further, are shown to be potentiated for the user when used in conjunction with new surroundings and stimuli, and otherwise novel environs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carey RJ, Damianopoulos EN, Shanahan AB |title=Cocaine effects on behavioral responding to a novel object placed in a familiar environment |journal=Pharmacol.

=== Metabolism and excretion ===
Cocaine is extensively [[metabolism|metabolized]], primarily in the [[liver]], with only about 1% excreted unchanged in the urine. The metabolism is dominated by [[hydrolysis|hydrolytic]] [[ester]] cleavage, so the eliminated metabolites consist mostly of [[benzoylecgonine]] (BE), the major [[metabolite]], and other significant metabolites in lesser amounts such as ecgonine methyl ester (EME) and [[ecgonine]]. Further minor metabolites of cocaine include [[norcocaine]], p-hydroxycocaine, m-hydroxycocaine, p-hydroxybenzoylecgonine (pOHBE), and m-hydroxybenzoylecgonine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kolbrich EA, Barnes AJ, Gorelick DA, Boyd SJ, Cone EJ, Huestis MA |title=Major and minor metabolites of cocaine in human plasma following controlled subcutaneous cocaine administration |journal=J Anal Toxicol |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=501–10 |year=2006 |pmid=17132243|url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&amp;issn=0146-4760&amp;volume=30&amp;issue=8&amp;spage=501&amp;aulast=Kolbrich}}&lt;/ref&gt; These do not include metabolites created beyond the standard metabolism of the drug in the human body, like for example by the process of pyrolysis such as is the case with methylecgonidine; or the binding of other exogenous subsumed chemicals in administration concurrently with any constituent cocaine molecule conformation ''in vivo'' to be enumerated within the user as a conditionate dependant on tertiary measures to form as a novel metabolite too vast in potential instances to account for beyond the tertiary measure of their otherwise notability.

Depending on liver and kidney function, cocaine metabolites are detectable in urine. Benzoylecgonine can be detected in urine within four hours after cocaine intake and remains detectable in concentrations greater than 150&amp;nbsp;ng/ml typically for up to eight days after cocaine is used. Detection of accumulation of cocaine metabolites in hair is possible in regular users until the sections of hair grown during use are cut or fall out.

If consumed with [[ethanol|alcohol]], cocaine combines with alcohol in the [[liver]] to form [[cocaethylene]]. Studies have suggested cocaethylene is both more [[wiktionary:euphorigenic|euphorigenic]], and has a higher [[cardiovascular]] toxicity than cocaine by itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilson LD, Jeromin J, Garvey L, Dorbandt A |title=Cocaine, ethanol, and cocaethylene cardiotoxity in an animal model of cocaine and ethanol abuse |journal=Acad Emerg Med |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=211–22 |year=2001|pmid=11229942 |doi=10.1111/j.1553-2712.2001.tb01296.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pan WJ, Hedaya MA |title=Cocaine and alcohol interactions in the rat: effect of cocaine and alcohol pretreatments on cocaine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics |journal=J Pharm Sci |volume=88 |issue=12 |pages=1266–74 |year=1999|pmid=10585221 |doi=10.1021/js990184j}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hayase T, Yamamoto Y, Yamamoto K |title=Role of cocaethylene in toxic symptoms due to repeated subcutaneous cocaine administration modified by oral doses of ethanol |journal=J Toxicol Sci |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=227–35 |year=1999 |pmid=10478337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in mice has suggested that [[capsaicin]] found in [[pepper spray]] may interact with cocaine with potentially fatal consequences. The method through which they would interact however, is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427345.300-cocaine-and-pepper-spray--a-lethal-mix.html|title=Cocaine and pepper spray – a lethal mix? |last=Barley|first=Shanta|date=13 November 2009 |publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=2009-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mendelson|first=John E.|date=October 2, 2009|title=Capsaicin, an active ingredient in pepper sprays, increases the lethality of cocaine |journal=Forensic Toxicology|issn=1860-8973|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x3p1m2471j835582/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Detection in biological fluids ===
Cocaine and its major metabolites may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in the forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a sudden death. Most commercial cocaine immunoassay screening tests cross-react appreciably with the major cocaine metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish and separately measure each of these substances. When interpreting the results of a test, it is important to consider the cocaine usage history of the individual, since a chronic user can develop tolerance to doses that would incapacitate a cocaine-naive individual, and the chronic user often has high baseline values of the metabolites in his system. Cautious interpretation of testing results may allow a distinction between passive or active usage, and between smoking versus other routes of administration.&lt;ref&gt;R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 349-355.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cocaine as a local anesthetic ===
Cocaine was historically useful as a topical anesthetic in eye and nasal surgery, although it is now predominantly used for nasal and [[lacrimal duct]] surgery. The major disadvantages of this use are cocaine's intense [[vasoconstrictor]] activity and potential for [[cardiovascular]] toxicity. Cocaine has since been largely replaced in Western medicine by synthetic local anesthetics such as [[benzocaine]], [[proparacaine]], [[lignocaine]]/[[xylocaine]]/[[lidocaine]], and [[tetracaine]] though it remains available for use if specified. If vasoconstriction is desired for a procedure (as it reduces bleeding), the anesthetic is combined with a vasoconstrictor such as [[phenylephrine]] or [[epinephrine]]. In Australia it is currently prescribed for use as a local anesthetic for conditions such as mouth and lung ulcers. Some [[otolaryngology|ENT]] specialists occasionally use cocaine within the practice when performing procedures such as nasal [[cauterization]]. In this scenario dissolved cocaine is soaked into a ball of cotton wool, which is placed in the nostril for the 10–15&amp;nbsp;minutes immediately prior to the procedure, thus performing the dual role of both numbing the area to be cauterized and also vasoconstriction. Even when used this way, some of the used cocaine may be absorbed through oral or nasal mucosa and give systemic effects.

In 2005, researchers from [[Kyoto University|Kyoto University Hospital]] proposed the use of cocaine in conjunction with [[phenylephrine]] administered in the form of an [[eye drop]] as a diagnostic test for [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2005-02-23|title=Cocaine and Phenylephrine Eye Drop Test for Parkinson Disease|publisher=[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]|volume=293|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/293/8/932.3.full|pmid=15728162|doi=10.1001/jama.293.8.932-c|author=Sawada, H.|journal=JAMA the Journal of the American Medical Association|page=932|last2=Yamakawa|first2=K|last3=Yamakado|first3=H|last4=Hosokawa|first4=R|last5=Ohba|first5=M|last6=Miyamoto|first6=K|last7=Kawamura|first7=T|last8=Shimohama|first8=S|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coca leaf ===
[[File:Folha de coca.jpg|thumb|[[Coca leaf]] in [[Bolivia]]]]
For over a thousand years [[South America]]n [[Native American (Americas)|indigenous peoples]] have chewed the leaves of ''[[coca|Erythroxylon coca]]'', a plant that contains vital nutrients as well as numerous [[alkaloids]], including cocaine. The coca leaf was, and still is, chewed almost universally by some [[tribe|indigenous communities]]. The remains of coca leaves have been found with ancient Peruvian mummies, and pottery from the time period depicts humans with bulged cheeks, indicating the presence of something on which they are chewing.&lt;ref name=&quot;mummies&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Altman AJ, Albert DM, Fournier GA |title=Cocaine's use in ophthalmology: our 100-year heritage |journal=Surv Ophthalmol |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=300–6 |year=1985 |pmid=3885453 |doi=10.1016/0039-6257(85)90153-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that these cultures used a mixture of coca leaves and saliva as an anesthetic for the performance of [[trepanation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;trepanning&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gay GR, Inaba DS, Sheppard CW, Newmeyer JA |title=Cocaine: history, epidemiology, human pharmacology, and treatment. a perspective on a new debut for an old girl |journal=Clin.

When the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish arrived in South America]], most at first ignored aboriginal claims that the leaf gave them strength and energy, and declared the practice of chewing it the work of the [[Satan|Devil]]. But after discovering that these claims were true, they legalized and taxed the leaf, taking 10% off the value of each crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1569, [[Nicolás Monardes]] described the practice of the natives of chewing a mixture of tobacco and coca leaves to induce &quot;great contentment&quot;:

In 1609, [[Military Chaplain|Padre]] [[Blas Valera]] wrote:
{{quote|Coca protects the body from many ailments, and our doctors use it in powdered form to reduce the swelling of wounds, to strengthen broken bones, to expel cold from the body or prevent it from entering, and to cure rotten wounds or sores that are full of maggots.

=== Isolation and naming ===
Although the stimulant and hunger-suppressant properties of coca had been known for many centuries, the isolation of the cocaine [[alkaloid]] was not achieved until 1855. Various European scientists had attempted to isolate cocaine, but none had been successful for two reasons: the knowledge of chemistry required was insufficient at the time. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Additionally contemporary conditions of sea-shipping from South America could degrade the cocaine in the plant samples available to Europeans. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The cocaine alkaloid was first isolated by the German [[chemist]] [[Friedrich Gaedcke]] in 1855. Gaedcke named the alkaloid &quot;erythroxyline&quot;, and published a description in the journal ''Archiv der Pharmazie.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1856, [[Friedrich Wöhler]] asked Dr. [[Carl Scherzer]], a scientist aboard the ''[[SMS Novara|Novara]]'' (an [[Austria]]n [[frigate]] sent by Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria|Franz Joseph]] to circle the globe), to bring him a large amount of coca leaves from South America. In 1859, the ship finished its travels and Wöhler received a trunk full of coca. Wöhler passed on the leaves to [[Albert Niemann (chemist)|Albert Niemann]], a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] student at the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany, who then developed an improved purification process.&lt;ref name=nie1860&gt;{{cite journal

Niemann described every step he took to isolate cocaine in his [[dissertation]] titled ''[[On a New Organic Base in the Coca Leaves|Über eine neue organische Base in den Cocablättern]]'' (''On a New Organic Base in the Coca Leaves''), which was published in 1860—it earned him his Ph.D. and is now in the [[British Library]]. He wrote of the alkaloid's &quot;colourless transparent prisms&quot; and said that, &quot;Its solutions have an alkaline reaction, a bitter taste, promote the flow of saliva and leave a peculiar numbness, followed by a sense of cold when applied to the tongue.&quot; Niemann named the alkaloid &quot;cocaine&quot; from &quot;coca&quot; (from [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] &quot;cuca&quot;) + [[Affix|suffix]] &quot;ine&quot;.&lt;ref name=nie1860/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|Cocaine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its use as a [[local anesthetic]], a suffix &quot;-caine&quot; was later extracted and used to form names of synthetic [[local anesthetic]]s.

The first synthesis and elucidation of the structure of the cocaine molecule was by [[Richard Willstätter]] in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Humphrey AJ, O'Hagan D |title=Tropane alkaloid biosynthesis. A century old problem unresolved |journal=Nat Prod Rep |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=494–502 |year=2001 |pmid=11699882 |doi=10.1039/b001713m}}&lt;/ref&gt; The synthesis started from [[tropinone]], a related natural product and took five steps.

=== Medicalization ===
&lt;!--yes, this is a word, go look it up in the OED ;)--&gt;
With the discovery of this new alkaloid, Western medicine was quick to exploit the possible uses of this plant.

[[File:Cocaine_for_kids.gif|thumb|Used for [[toothache|dental pain]] in children]]
In 1879, Vassili von Anrep, of the [[University of Würzburg]], devised an experiment to demonstrate the analgesic properties of the newly discovered alkaloid. He prepared two separate jars, one containing a cocaine-salt solution, with the other containing merely salt water. He then submerged a frog's legs into the two jars, one leg in the treatment and one in the control solution, and proceeded to stimulate the legs in several different ways. The leg that had been immersed in the cocaine solution reacted very differently than the leg that had been immersed in salt water.&lt;ref name=&quot;anrep_frog&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yentis SM, Vlassakov KV |title=Vassily von Anrep, forgotten pioneer of regional anesthesia |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=890–5 |year=1999|pmid=10078692 |doi=10.1097/00000542-199903000-00033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Koller]] (a close associate of [[Sigmund Freud]], who would write about cocaine later) experimented with cocaine for [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] usage. In an infamous experiment in 1884, he experimented upon himself by applying a cocaine solution to his own eye and then pricking it with pins. His findings were presented to the Heidelberg Ophthalmological Society. Also in 1884, Jellinek demonstrated the effects of cocaine as a [[respiratory system]] anesthetic. In 1885, [[William Halsted]] demonstrated nerve-block anesthesia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Practical comments on the use and abuse of cocaine|curly=true|author=Halsted W|journal=New York Medical Journal|year=1885|pages=294–295|volume=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and James Corning demonstrated [[peridural]] anesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Corning JL|year=1885|journal=New York Medical Journal|title=An experimental study|volume=42|page=483|curly=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1898 saw [[Heinrich Quincke]] use cocaine for [[spinal anesthesia]].

=== Popularization ===
[[File:Mariani pope.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Leo XIII]] purportedly carried a hipflask of the coca-treated Vin Mariani with him, and awarded a [[Vatican City|Vatican]] [[gold medal]] to [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.cocanaturally.com/ |title=Experience Vin Mariani today &amp;#124; Grupo Mariani S.A |publisher=Cocanaturally.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1859, an Italian [[physician|doctor]], [[Paolo Mantegazza]], returned from [[Peru]], where he had witnessed first-hand the use of coca by the natives. He proceeded to experiment on himself and upon his return to [[Milan]] he wrote a paper in which he described the effects. In this paper he declared coca and cocaine (at the time they were assumed to be the same) as being useful medicinally, in the treatment of &quot;a furred tongue in the morning, [[flatulence]], and whitening of the teeth.&quot;

A chemist named [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]] who read Mantegazza's paper became immediately intrigued with coca and its economic potential. In 1863, Mariani started marketing a [[wine]] called [[Vin Mariani]], which had been treated with coca leaves, to become [[cocawine]]. The [[alcohol|ethanol]] in wine acted as a solvent and extracted the cocaine from the coca leaves, altering the drink's effect. It contained 6&amp;nbsp;mg cocaine per ounce of wine, but Vin Mariani which was to be exported contained 7.2&amp;nbsp;mg per ounce, to compete with the higher cocaine content of similar drinks in the United States. A &quot;pinch of coca leaves&quot; was included in [[John Pemberton|John Styth Pemberton]]'s original 1886 recipe for [[Coca-Cola]], though the company began using decocainized leaves in 1906 when the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] was passed. The actual amount of cocaine that Coca-Cola contained during the first twenty years of its production is practically impossible to determine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

In 1879 cocaine began to be used to treat [[morphine]] addiction. Cocaine was introduced into clinical use as a [[local anesthetic]] in Germany in 1884, about the same time as [[Sigmund Freud]] published his work ''Über Coca'', in which he wrote that cocaine causes:

{{quote|Exhilaration and lasting euphoria, which in no way differs from the normal euphoria of the healthy person. You perceive an increase of self-control and possess more vitality and capacity for work. In other words, you are simply normal, and it is soon hard to believe you are under the influence of any drug. Long intensive physical work is performed without any fatigue. This result is enjoyed without any of the unpleasant after-effects that follow exhilaration brought about by alcohol. Absolutely no craving for the further use of cocaine appears after the first, or even after repeated taking of the drug.}}

In 1885 the U.S. manufacturer [[Parke-Davis]] sold cocaine in various forms, including cigarettes, powder, and even a cocaine mixture that could be injected directly into the user's veins with the included needle. The company promised that its cocaine products would &quot;supply the place of food, make the coward brave, the silent eloquent and render the sufferer insensitive to pain.&quot;

By the late [[Victorian era]] cocaine use had appeared as a vice in [[literature]]. For example, it was injected by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s fictional [[Sherlock Holmes]].

In early 20th-century [[Memphis, Tennessee]], cocaine was sold in neighborhood drugstores on [[Beale Street]], costing five or ten cents for a small boxful. Stevedores along the Mississippi River used the drug as a stimulant, and white employers encouraged its use by black laborers.&lt;ref name= barlow&gt;Barlow, William.

In 1909, [[Ernest Shackleton]] took &quot;Forced March&quot; brand cocaine tablets to [[Antarctica]], as did [[Captain Scott]] a year later on his ill-fated journey to the [[South Pole]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dominic_streatfeild&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Dominic|last=Streatfeild|title=Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography|publisher=Picador|year=2003|isbn=978-0-312-42226-4|curly=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid 1940's amidst WWII cocaine was considered for inclusion as an ingredient of a future generation of 'pep pills' for the German military code named [[D-IX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amphetamines.com/nazidrug.html |title=Jeevan Vasagar: cocaine-based &quot;wonder drug&quot; tested on concentration camp inmates |publisher=Amphetamines.com |date=2002-11-19 |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prohibition ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}
By the turn of the 20th century, the addictive properties of cocaine had become clear, and perceived problems with cocaine use began to capture public attention in the United States. The dangers of cocaine use became part of a [[moral panic]] that was tied to the dominant racial and social anxieties of the day. In 1903, the ''American Journal of Pharmacy'' stressed that most cocaine abusers were &quot;[[bohemianism|bohemians]], gamblers, high- and low-class [[prostitutes]], night porters, [[bellhop|bell boys]], burglars, racketeers, pimps, and casual laborers.&quot; In 1914, Dr. Christopher Koch of [[Pennsylvania]]'s State Pharmacy Board made the racial innuendo explicit, testifying that, “Most of the attacks upon the white women of the South are the direct result of a cocaine-crazed Negro brain.&quot; Mass media manufactured an epidemic of cocaine use among [[African Americans]] in the [[Southern United States]] to play upon racial prejudices of the era, though there is little evidence that such an epidemic actually took place. In the same year, the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] outlawed the sale and distribution of cocaine in the United States. This law incorrectly referred to cocaine as a [[narcotic]], and the misclassification passed into popular culture. As stated above, cocaine is a stimulant, not a narcotic. Although technically illegal for purposes of distribution and use, the distribution, sale and use of cocaine was still legal for registered companies and individuals. Because of the misclassification of cocaine as a narcotic, the debate is still open on whether the government actually enforced these laws strictly. Cocaine was not considered a controlled substance until 1970, when the United States listed it as such in the [[Controlled Substances Act]]. Until that point, the use of cocaine was open and rarely prosecuted in the US due to the moral and physical debates commonly discussed.

=== Modern usage ===
In many countries, cocaine is a popular [[recreational drug]]. In the United States, the development of [[crack cocaine|&quot;crack&quot; cocaine]] introduced the substance to a generally poorer inner-city market. Use of the powder form has stayed relatively constant, experiencing a new height of use during the late 1990s and early 2000s in the U.S., and has become much more popular in the last few years in the UK. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Cocaine use is prevalent across all socioeconomic strata, including age, demographics, economic, social, political, religious, and livelihood. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The estimated U.S. cocaine market exceeded [[United States dollar|$]]70 billion in street value for the year 2005, exceeding revenues by corporations such as [[Starbucks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080617113902/http://www.applesanity.com/fetish/blow/ Apple Sanity – Fetish – Blow: War on Drugs VS. Cocaine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.havocscope.com/Drugs/cocaine.htm |title=Cocaine Market |publisher=Havocscope.com |accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tremendous demand for cocaine in the U.S. market, particularly among those who are making incomes affording [[luxury good|luxury]] spending, such as single adults and professionals with discretionary income. Cocaine’s status as a [[club drug]] shows its immense popularity among the &quot;party crowd&quot;.

In 1995 the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute]] (UNICRI) announced in a press release the publication of the results of the largest global study on cocaine use ever undertaken. However, a decision by an American representative in the [[World Health Assembly]] banned the publication of the study, because it seemed to make a case for the positive uses of cocaine. An excerpt of the report strongly conflicted
with accepted paradigms, for example &quot;that occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to
severe or even minor physical or social problems.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Cocaine Project |year=1995|author=WHO/UNICRI|url=http://www.tni.org/archives/drugscoca-docs_sixhorsemen}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sixth meeting of the B committee the US representative threatened that &quot;If [[World Health Organization|WHO]] activities relating to drugs failed to reinforce proven drug control approaches, funds for the relevant programs should be curtailed&quot;. This led to the decision to discontinue publication. A part of the study has been recuperated. Available are profiles of cocaine use in 20 countries.

It was reported in October 2010, that the use of cocaine in Australia has doubled since monitoring began in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cocaine use doubles in a decade|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/wellbeing/cocaine-use-doubles-in-a-decade-20101015-16mli.html |publisher=Sydney Morning Hearld |date=15 October 2010 |accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A problem with illegal cocaine use, especially in the higher volumes used to combat fatigue (rather than increase euphoria) by long-term users, is the risk of ill effects or damage caused by the compounds used in adulteration. Cutting or &quot;stepping on&quot; the drug is commonplace, using compounds which simulate ingestion effects, such as [[Novocain]] (procaine) producing temporary anesthaesia as many users believe a strong numbing effect is the result of strong and/or pure cocaine, ephedrine or similar stimulants that are to produce an increased heart rate. The normal adulterants for profit are inactive sugars, usually mannitol, creatine or glucose, so introducing active adulterants gives the illusion of purity and to 'stretch' or make it so a dealer can sell more product than without the adulterants.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The adulterant of sugars therefore allows the dealer to sell the product for a higher price because of the illusion of purity and allows to sell more of the product at that higher price, enabling dealers to make a lot of revenue with little cost of the adulterants. Cocaine trading carries large penalties in most jurisdictions, so user deception about purity and consequent high profits for dealers are the norm.{{Or|date=May 2009}} A study by the [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] in 2007 showed that the purity levels for street purchased cocaine was often under 5% and on average under 50% pure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EMCDDA Retail Cocaine Purity Study|year=2007|author=EMCDDA|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/stats09/ppptab7a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
=== Legal status ===
{{Main|Legal status of cocaine}}
The production, distribution and sale of cocaine products is restricted (and illegal in most contexts) in most countries as regulated by the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], and the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]]. In the United States the manufacture, importation, possession, and distribution of cocaine is additionally regulated by the 1970 [[Controlled Substances Act]].

Some countries, such as Peru and Bolivia permit the cultivation of coca leaf for traditional consumption by the local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous population]], but nevertheless prohibit the production, sale and consumption of cocaine. In addition, some parts of Europe and Australia allow processed cocaine for medicinal uses only.

=== Interdiction ===
In 2004, according to the [[United Nations]], 589 [[metric ton]]s of cocaine were seized globally by law enforcement authorities. [[Colombia]] seized 188&amp;nbsp;tons, the United States 166&amp;nbsp;tons, Europe 79&amp;nbsp;tons, Peru 14&amp;nbsp;tons, Bolivia 9&amp;nbsp;tons, and the rest of the world 133 [[metric ton|tons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;un-wdr2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Drug Report 2006|publisher=[[United Nations]]|location=New York|url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/WDR_2006/wdr2006_chap4_cocaine.pdf|year=2006|format=PDF|chapter=Cocaine: Seizures, 1998–2003|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Illicit trade ==
[[File:Drugpackscorpion.png|thumb|Bricks of cocaine, a form in which it is commonly transported.]]
Because of the extensive processing it undergoes during preparation, cocaine is generally treated as a '[[hard and soft drugs|hard drug']], with severe penalties for possession and trafficking. Demand remains high, and consequently black market cocaine is quite expensive. Unprocessed cocaine, such as [[coca leaves]], are occasionally purchased and sold, but this is exceedingly rare as it is much easier and more profitable to conceal and smuggle it in powdered form. The scale of the market is immense: 770 tonnes times $100 per gram retail = up to $77 billion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

=== Production ===
Colombia is the world's leading producer of cocaine.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA World Factbook&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/co.html CIA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Three-quarters of the world's annual yield of cocaine has been produced in Colombia, both from cocaine base imported from Peru (primarily the [[Huallaga Valley]]) and Bolivia, and from locally grown coca. There was a 28% increase from the amount of potentially harvestable coca plants which were grown in Colombia in 1998. This, combined with crop reductions in Bolivia and Peru, made Colombia the nation with the largest area of coca under cultivation after the mid-1990s. Coca grown for traditional purposes by indigenous communities, a use which is still present and is permitted by Colombian laws, only makes up a small fragment of total coca production, most of which is used for the illegal drug trade.

An interview with a coca farmer published in 2003 described a mode of production by [[acid-base extraction]] that has changed little since 1905. Roughly 625&amp;nbsp;pounds of leaves were harvested per [[hectare]], six times per year. The leaves were dried for half a day, then chopped into small pieces with a strimmer and sprinkled with a small amount of powdered cement (replacing [[sodium carbonate]] from former times). Several hundred pounds of this mixture was soaked in {{convert|50|USgal|L}} of gasoline for a day, then the gasoline was removed and the leaves were pressed for remaining liquid, after which they could be discarded. Then [[battery acid]] (weak [[sulfuric acid]]) was used, one bucket per 25 kilograms of leaves, to create a [[phase separation]] in which the cocaine free base in the gasoline was acidified and extracted into a few buckets of &quot;murky-looking smelly liquid&quot;. Once powdered [[caustic soda]] was added to this, the cocaine precipitated and could be removed by filtration through a cloth. The resulting material, when dried, was termed ''pasta'' and sold by the farmer. The 3750&amp;nbsp;pound yearly harvest of leaves from a hectare produced 2.5 kilos of ''pasta''&lt;!--- note that this figure is only about 1/3 of the figure inferred from the numbers below ---&gt;, approximately 40–60% cocaine. Repeated recrystallization from solvents, producing ''pasta lavada'' and eventually crystalline cocaine, were performed at specialized laboratories after the sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9ceLzaeHsZAC&amp;pg=PA462|title=Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography|author=Dominic Streatfeild|publisher=Macmillan|year=2003|isbn=9780312422264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to eradicate coca fields through the use of defoliants have devastated part of the farming economy in some coca growing regions of Colombia, and strains appear to have been developed that are more resistant or immune to their use. Whether these strains are natural mutations or the product of human tampering is unclear. These strains have also shown to be more potent than those previously grown, increasing profits for the drug cartels responsible for the exporting of cocaine. Although production fell temporarily, coca crops rebounded as numerous smaller fields in Colombia, rather than the larger plantations.

The cultivation of coca has become an attractive, and in some cases even necessary, economic decision on the part of many growers due to the combination of several factors, including the persistence of worldwide demand, the lack of other employment alternatives, the lower profitability of alternative crops in official crop substitution programs, the eradication-related damages to non-drug farms, and the spread of new strains of the coca plant.

=== Synthesis ===
Synthetic cocaine would be highly desirable to the illegal drug industry, as it would eliminate the high visibility and low reliability of offshore sources and international smuggling, replacing them with clandestine domestic laboratories, as are common for illicit [[methamphetamine]]. However, natural cocaine remains the lowest cost and highest quality supply of cocaine. Actual full synthesis of cocaine is rarely done. Formation of inactive [[enantiomers]] (cocaine has 4 chiral centres – 1R,2R,3S,5S – hence a total potential of 16 possible enantiomers and disteroisomers) plus synthetic by-products limits the yield and purity.
Names like &quot;synthetic cocaine&quot; and &quot;new cocaine&quot; have been misapplied to [[phencyclidine]] (PCP) and various [[designer drug]]s.

=== Trafficking and distribution ===
[[File:CocaineUkelele-Opened.jpg|thumb|Cocaine smuggled in a [[charango]], 2008]]
[[Organized crime|Organized criminal]] gangs operating on a large scale dominate the cocaine trade. Most cocaine is grown and processed in [[South America]], particularly in [[Colombia]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], and smuggled into the United States and Europe, the United States being the worlds largest consumer of cocaine,&lt;ref name=&quot;WFK Illicit drugs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2086.html |title=Field Listing – Illicit drugs (by country) |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is sold at huge markups; usually in the US at $80–$120 for 1&amp;nbsp;gram, and $250–300 for 3.5&amp;nbsp;grams (1/8 of an ounce, or an &quot;eight ball&quot;).

==== Caribbean and Mexican routes ====
Cocaine shipments from [[South America]] transported through [[Mexico]] or [[Central America]] are generally moved over land or by air to staging sites in northern Mexico. The cocaine is then broken down into smaller loads for smuggling across the [[US-Mexico border|U.S.–Mexico border]]. The primary cocaine importation points in the United States are in [[Arizona]], southern [[California]], southern [[Florida]], and [[Texas]]. Typically, land vehicles are driven across the U.S.-Mexico border. Sixty five percent of cocaine enters the United States through Mexico, and the vast majority of the rest enters through Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Robert. &quot;Illegal Drugs: America's Anguish&quot;. Farmington Hills, MI: Thomson Gale, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Cocaine traffickers from Colombia, and recently [[Mexico]], have also established a labyrinth of [[smuggling]] routes throughout the [[Caribbean]], the [[Bahama]] Island chain, and South [[Florida]]. They often hire traffickers from [[Mexico]] or the [[Dominican Republic]] to transport the drug. The traffickers use a variety of smuggling techniques to transfer their drug to U.S. markets. These include airdrops of 500–700&amp;nbsp;kg in the [[Bahama Islands]] or off the coast of [[Puerto Rico]], mid-ocean boat-to-boat transfers of 500–2,000&amp;nbsp;kg, and the commercial shipment of tonnes of cocaine through the port of [[Miami]].

==== Chilean route ====
Another route of cocaine traffic goes through Chile, this route is primarily used for cocaine produced in Bolivia since the nearest seaports lie in northern Chile. The arid Bolivia-Chile border is easily crossed by 4x4 vehicles that then head to the seaports of [[Iquique]] and [[Antofagasta]]. While the price of cocaine is higher in Chile than in Peru and Bolivia, the final destination is usually Europe, especially [[Spain]] where drug dealing networks exist among South American immigrants.

==== Techniques ====
Cocaine is also carried in small, concealed, kilogram quantities across the border by couriers known as “[[mule (smuggling)|mules]]” (or “mulas”), who cross a border either legally, for example, through a port or airport, or illegally elsewhere. The drugs may be strapped to the waist or legs or hidden in bags, or hidden in the body. If the mule gets through without being caught, the gangs will reap most of the profits. If he or she is caught however, gangs will sever all links and the mule will usually stand trial for trafficking alone.

Bulk cargo ships are also used to smuggle cocaine to staging sites in the western [[Caribbean]]–[[Gulf of Mexico]] area. These vessels are typically 150–250-foot (50–80&amp;nbsp;m) coastal freighters that carry an average cocaine load of approximately 2.5 tonnes. Commercial fishing vessels are also used for smuggling operations. In areas with a high volume of recreational traffic, smugglers use the same types of vessels, such as [[go-fast boat]]s, as those used by the local populations.

Sophisticated [[Narco submarine|drug subs]] are the latest tool drug runners are using to bring cocaine north from Colombia, it was reported on March 20, 2008. Although the vessels were once viewed as a quirky sideshow in the drug war, they are becoming faster, more seaworthy, and capable of carrying bigger loads of drugs than earlier models, according to those charged with catching them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/03/20/drug.subs/index.html |title=Coast Guard hunts drug-running semi-subs|accessdate=2008-03-20|work=CNN|date=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sales to consumers ===
[[File:Flavcocaine.jpg|thumb|Cocaine adulterated with fruit flavoring]]

Cocaine is readily available in all major countries' metropolitan areas. According to the ''Summer 1998 Pulse Check,'' published by the U.S. [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], cocaine use had stabilized across the country, with a few increases reported in [[San Diego]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], and [[Boston]]. In the West, cocaine usage was lower, which was thought to be due to a switch to [[methamphetamine]] among some users; methamphetamine is cheaper, three and a half times more powerful, and lasts 12 to 24 times longer with each dose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.methproject.org/Meth_Info/education.php Meth Info | The Meth Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denisonia.com/policeDept/amphetamines.asp Drugs of Abuse | City of Denison Iowa]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the number of cocaine users remain high, with a large concentration among urban youth.

In addition to the amounts previously mentioned, cocaine can be sold in &quot;bill sizes&quot;: for example, $10 might purchase a &quot;dime bag,&quot; a very small amount (0.1–0.15&amp;nbsp;g) of cocaine. Twenty dollars might purchase 0.15–0.3&amp;nbsp;g. However, in lower Texas, it is sold cheaper due to it being easier to receive: a dime for $10 is 0.4g, a 20 is 0.8-1.0&amp;nbsp;gram and a 8-ball (3.5g) is sold for $60 to $80 dollars, depending on the quality and dealer. These amounts and prices are very popular among young people because they are inexpensive and easily concealed on one's body. Quality and price can vary dramatically depending on supply and demand, and on geographic region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economist.com/daily/chartgallery/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9414607 &quot;Pricing powder&quot;], [[The Economist]], June 28, 2007, Prices: USA around $110/g, Israel/ Germany/ Britain around $46/g, Colombia $2/g, New Zealand recordbreaking $714.30/g.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] reports that the typical retail price of cocaine varied between 50€ and 75€ per gram in most European countries, although Cyprus, Romania, Sweden and Turkey reported much higher values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] |title=Annual report: the state of the drugs problem in Europe |year=2008 |publisher=Office for Official Publications of the European Communities |location=Luxembourg |isbn=978-92-9168-324-6 |page=59 |url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_64227_EN_EMCDDA_AR08_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consumption ===
World annual cocaine consumption currently stands at around 600 [[metric ton]]s, with the United States consuming around 300 metric tons, 50% of the total, Europe about 150 metric tons, 25% of the total, and the rest of the world the remaining 150 metric tons or 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dod.mil/policy/sections/policy_offices/solic/cn/cocaine2.pdf|title=The Cocaine Threat: A Hemispheric Perspective|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]]|format=PDF}} {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
{{Globalize|section|date=March 2010}}
According to a 2007 United Nations report, Spain is the country with the highest rate of cocaine usage (3.0% of adults in the previous year).&lt;ref name=&quot;unodc&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/research/wdr07/WDR_2007.pdf|publisher=United Nations|title=World Drug Report 2007|location=New York|year=2007|format=PDF}}, p243.&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries where the usage rate meets or exceeds 1.5% are the United States (2.8%), England and Wales (2.4%), Canada (2.3%), Italy (2.1%), Bolivia (1.9%), Chile (1.8%), and Scotland (1.5%).&lt;ref name=&quot;unodc&quot;/&gt;

=== In the United States ===
==== General usage ====
Cocaine is the second most popular illegal recreational drug in the U.S. (behind [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/cocaine/cocaine.shtml|title=erowid.org|accessdate=2007-07-10|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071006230957/http%3A//www.erowid.org/chemicals/cocaine/cocaine.shtml |archivedate = October 6, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the U.S. is the world's largest consumer of cocaine.&lt;ref name=&quot;WFK Illicit drugs&quot;/&gt; Cocaine is commonly used in middle to upper class communities. It is also popular amongst college students, as a party drug. Its users span over different ages, races, and professions. In the 1970s and 80's, the drug became particularly popular in the [[disco]] culture as cocaine usage was very common and popular in many discos such as [[Studio 54]].

The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) reported in 1999 that cocaine was used by 3.7 million Americans, or 1.7% of the household population age 12 and older. Estimates of the current number of those who use cocaine regularly (at least once per month) vary, but 1.5 million is a widely accepted figure within the research community. In 2001, more [[Hispanic]]s received sentences for crimes relating to powder cocaine than any other ethnicity while more [[African American]]s were convicted of crimes relating to crack cocaine in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rjhresearch.com/adr/drugs/cocaine.htm RJHresearch.com]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although cocaine use had not significantly changed over the six years prior to 1999, the number of first-time users went up from 574,000 in 1991, to 934,000 in 1998{{ndash}} an increase of 63%. While these numbers indicated that cocaine is still widely present in the United States, its use was significantly less prevalent than during the early 1980s.

==== Usage among youth ====
The 1999 [[Monitoring the future|Monitoring the Future]] (MTF) survey found the proportion of American students reporting use of powdered cocaine rose during the 1990s. In 1991, 2.3% of eighth-graders stated that they had used cocaine in their lifetime. This figure rose to 4.7% in 1999. For the older grades, increases began in 1992 and continued through the beginning of 1999. Between those years, lifetime use of cocaine went from 3.3% to 7.7% for tenth-graders and from 6.1% to 9.8% for high school seniors. Lifetime use of crack cocaine, according to MTF, also increased among eighth-, tenth-, and twelfth-graders, from an average of 2% in 1991 to 3.9% in 1999.

Perceived risk and disapproval of cocaine and crack use both decreased during the 1990s at all three grade levels. The 1999 NHSDA found the highest rate of monthly cocaine use was for those aged 18–25 at 1.7%, an increase from 1.2% in 1997. Rates declined between 1996 and 1998 for ages 26–34, while rates slightly increased for the 12–17 and 35+ age groups. Studies also show people are experimenting with cocaine at younger ages. NHSDA found a steady decline in the mean age of first use from 23.6 years in 1992 to 20.6 years in 1998.

=== In Europe ===
==== General usage ====
Cocaine is the second most popular illegal recreational drug in Europe (behind [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]). Since the mid-1990s, overall cocaine usage in Europe has been on the rise, but usage rates and attitudes tend to vary between countries. Countries with the highest usage rates are: The United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, and Ireland.

Approximately 12 million Europeans (3.6%) have used cocaine at least once, 4 million (1.2%) in the last year, and 2 million in the last month (0.5%).

==== Usage among young adults ====
About 3.5 million or 87.5% of those who have used the drug in the last year are young adults (15–34 years old). Usage is particularly prevalent among this demographic: 4% to 7% of males have used cocaine in the last year in Spain, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The ratio of male to female users is approximately 3.8:1, but this statistic varies from 1:1 to 13:1 depending on country.&lt;ref name=&quot;European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_64227_EN_EMCDDA_AR08_en.pdf|publisher=European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction|title=The State of the Drugs Problem in Europe 2008|location=Luxembourg|year=2008|format=PDF|pages=58–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg|thumb|right|250px|Illustration of a Cartesian coordinate plane. Four points are marked and labeled with their coordinates: (2, 3) in green, (−3, 1) in red, (−1.5, −2.5) in blue, and the origin (0, 0) in purple.]]

A '''Cartesian coordinate system''' specifies each [[point (geometry)|point]] uniquely in a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] by a pair of [[number|numerical]] '''coordinates''', which are the [[positive and negative numbers|signed]] distances from the point to two fixed [[perpendicular]] directed lines, measured in the same [[unit length|unit of length]].

Each reference line is called a '''coordinate axis''' or just '''axis''' of the system, and the point where they meet is its '''[[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]'''. The coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the [[orthogonal projection|perpendicular projections]] of the point onto the two axes, expressed as signed distances from the origin.

One can use the same principle to specify the position of any point in three-[[dimension]]al [[space (mathematics)|space]] by three Cartesian coordinates, its signed distances to three mutually perpendicular planes (or, equivalently, by its perpendicular projection onto three mutually perpendicular lines). In general, one can specify a point in a space of any [[dimension]] ''n'' by use of ''n'' Cartesian coordinates, the signed distances from ''n'' mutually perpendicular [[hyperplanes]].

[[Image:Cartesian-coordinate-system-with-circle.svg|thumb|right|250px|Cartesian coordinate system with a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin marked in red. The equation of a circle is (''x'' - ''a'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (''y'' - ''b'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; where ''a'' and ''b'' are the coordinates of the center (''a'', ''b'') and ''r'' is the radius.]]

The invention of Cartesian coordinates in the 17th century by [[René Descartes]] revolutionized mathematics by providing the first systematic link between [[Euclidean geometry]] and [[algebra]]. Using the Cartesian coordinate system, geometric shapes (such as [[curve]]s) can be described by '''Cartesian equations''': algebraic [[equations]] involving the coordinates of the points lying on the shape. For example, a circle of radius 2 may be described as the set of all points whose coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' satisfy the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4.

Cartesian coordinates are the foundation of [[analytic geometry]], and provide enlightening geometric interpretations for many other branches of mathematics, such as [[linear algebra]], [[complex number|complex analysis]], [[differential geometry]], multivariate [[calculus]], [[group theory]], and more. A familiar example is the concept of the [[graph (mathematics)|graph]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]]. Cartesian coordinates are also essential tools for most applied disciplines that deal with geometry, including [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[engineering]], and many more. They are the most common coordinate system used in [[computer graphics]], [[computer-aided geometric design]], and other [[computational geometry|geometry-related data processing]].

==History==
The adjective ''Cartesian'' refers to the [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]] [[René Descartes]] (who used the name ''Cartesius'' in [[Latin]]).

The idea of this system was developed in 1637 in two writings by Descartes and independently by [[Pierre de Fermat]], although Fermat used three dimensions, and did not publish the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=analytic geometry|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2008|edition=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=02-08-2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes introduces the new idea of specifying the position of a [[point (geometry)|point]] or object on a surface, using two intersecting axes as measuring guides.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} In ''[[La Géométrie]]'', he further explores the above-mentioned concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Descartes, R|title=La Géométrie|url=http://gallica2.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k29040s.image.f1.langEN |page=Livre Premier: Des problèmes qu'on peut construire sans y employer que des cercles et des lignes droites (Book one: Problems whose construction requires only circles and straight lines)|nopp=true}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the Cartesian coordinate system enabled the development of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and [[projective geometry]]. It would later play an intrinsic role in the development of [[calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].&lt;ref&gt;A Tour of the Calculus, David Brezinsky&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicole Oresme#Mathematics|Nicole Oresme]], a French philosopher of the 14th Century, used constructions similar to Cartesian coordinates well before the time of Descartes.

Many other coordinate systems have been developed since Descartes, such as the [[polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] for the plane, and the [[spherical coordinates|spherical]] and [[cylindrical coordinates]] for three-dimensional space.

==Definitions==
===Number line===
{{Main|Number line}}
Choosing a Cartesian coordinate system for a one-dimensional space—that is, for a straight line—means choosing a point ''O'' of the line (the origin), a unit of length, and an orientation for the line. The latter means choosing which of the two half-lines determined by ''O'' is the ''positive'', and which is ''negative''; we then say that the line ''is oriented'' (or ''points'') ''from'' the negative half ''towards'' the positive half. Then each point ''p'' of the line can be specified by its distance from ''O'', taken with a + or − sign depending on which half-line contains ''p''.

A line with a chosen Cartesian system is called a '''number line'''. Every real number, whether integer, rational, or irrational, has a unique location on the line. Conversely, every point on the line can be interpreted as a [[number]] in an ordered continuum which includes the real numbers.

===Cartesian coordinates in two dimensions===
The modern Cartesian coordinate system in two dimensions (also called a rectangular coordinate system) is defined by an [[ordered pair]] of [[perpendicular]] lines (axes), a single unit of length for both axes, and an orientation for each axis. (Early systems allowed &quot;oblique&quot; axes, that is, axes that did not meet at right angles.) The lines are commonly referred to as the ''x'' and ''y''-axes where the ''x''-axis is taken to be horizontal and the ''y''-axis is taken to be vertical. The point where the axes meet is taken as the origin for both, thus turning each axis into a number line. For a given point ''P'', a line is drawn through ''P'' perpendicular to the ''x''-axis to meet it at ''X'' and second line is drawn through ''P'' perpendicular to the ''y''-axis to meet it at ''Y''. The coordinates of ''P'' are then ''X'' and ''Y'' interpreted as numbers ''x'' and ''y'' on the corresponding number lines. The coordinates are written as an ordered pair (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'').

The point where the axes meet is the common origin of the two number lines and is simply called the ''origin''. It is often labeled ''O'' and if so then the axes are called ''Ox'' and ''Oy''. A plane with ''x'' and ''y''-axes defined is often referred to as the Cartesian plane or ''xy'' plane. The value of ''x'' is called the ''x''-coordinate or [[abscissa]] and the value of ''y'' is called the ''y''-coordinate or [[ordinate]].

The choices of letters come from the original convention, which is to use the latter part of the alphabet to indicate unknown values. The first part of the alphabet was used to designate known values.

===Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions===
[[Image:Coord system CA 0.svg|thumb|240px|A three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, with origin ''O'' and axis lines ''X'', ''Y'' and ''Z'', oriented as shown by the arrows. The tic marks on the axes are one length unit apart. The black dot shows the point with coordinates ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, and ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, or (2,3,4).]]

Choosing a Cartesian coordinate system for a three-dimensional space means choosing an ordered triplet of lines (axes), any two of them being perpendicular; a single unit of length for all three axes; and an orientation for each axis.  As in the two-dimensional case, each axis becomes a number line.  The coordinates of a point ''p'' are obtained by drawing a line through ''p'' perpendicular to each coordinate axis, and reading the points where these lines meet the axes as three numbers of these number lines.

Alternatively, the coordinates of a point ''p'' can also be taken as the (signed) distances from ''p'' to the three planes defined by the three axes. If the axes are named ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', then the ''x'' coordinate is the distance from the plane defined by the ''y'' and ''z'' axes. The distance is to be taken with the + or &amp;minus; sign, depending on which of the two [[half-space]]s separated by that plane contains ''p''.  The ''y'' and ''z'' coordinates can be obtained in the same way from the (''x'',''z'') and (''x'',''y'') planes, respectively.

[[Image:Cartesian coordinate surfaces.png|thumb|240px|right| The [[Coordinate system#Coordinate surface|coordinate surfaces]] of the Cartesian coordinates (''x'', ''y'', ''z'').  The ''z''-axis is vertical and the ''x''-axis is highlighted in green.  Thus, the red plane shows the points with ''x''=1, the blue plane shows the points with ''z''=1, and the yellow plane shows the points with ''y''=-1. The three surfaces intersect at the point '''P''' (shown as a black sphere) with the Cartesian coordinates (1, -1, 1).]]

===Generalizations===
One can generalize the concept of Cartesian coordinates to allow axes that are not perpendicular to each other, and/or different units along each axis.  In that case, each coordinate is obtained by projecting the point onto one axis along a direction that is parallel to the other axis (or, in general, to the hyperplane defined by all the other axes). In those '''oblique coordinate systems''' the computations of distances and angles is more complicated than in standard Cartesian systems, and many standard formulas (such as the Pythagorean formula for the distance) do not hold.

== Notations and conventions ==&lt;!-- [[Abscissa]] redirects here --&gt;
The Cartesian coordinates of a point are usually written in parentheses and separated by commas, as in (10,5) or (3,5,7).  The origin is often labelled with the capital letter ''O''. In analytic geometry, unknown or generic coordinates are often denoted by the letters ''x'' and ''y'' on the plane, and ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in three-dimensional space. ''w'' is often used for four-dimensional space, but the rarity of such usage precludes concrete convention here. This custom comes from an old convention of algebra, to use letters near the end of the alphabet for unknown values (such as were the coordinates of points in many geometric problems), and letters near the beginning for given quantities.

These conventional names are often used in other domains, such as physics and engineering.  However, other letters may be used too.  For example, in a graph showing how a [[pressure]] varies with [[time]], the graph coordinates may be denoted ''t'' and ''P''.  Each axis is usually named after the coordinate which is measured along it; so one says the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''-axis''', the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''y''-axis''', the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''t''-axis''', etc.

Another common convention for coordinate naming is to use subscripts, as in ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for the ''n'' coordinates in an ''n''-dimensional space; especially when ''n'' is greater than 3, or variable.  Some authors (and many [[programmer]]s) prefer the numbering ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  These notations are especially advantageous in [[computer programming]]: by storing the coordinates of a point as an [[Array data type|array]], instead of a [[record (computer science)|record]], one can use [[Iteration|iterative command]]s or [[subroutine|procedure]] [[parameter]]s instead of repeating the same commands for each coordinate.

In mathematical illustrations of two-dimensional Cartesian systems, the first coordinate (traditionally called the [[abscissa]]) is measured along a [[horizontal plane|horizontal]] axis, oriented from left to right.  The second coordinate (the [[ordinate]]) is then measured along a [[vertical direction|vertical]] axis, usually oriented from bottom to top.

However, in  computer graphics  and [[image processing]] one often uses a coordinate system with the ''y'' axis pointing down (as displayed on the computer's screen). This convention developed in the 1960s (or earlier) from the way that images were originally stored in [[display buffer]]s.

For three-dimensional systems, mathematicians usually draw the ''z'' axis as vertical and pointing up, so that the ''x'' and ''y'' axes lie on an horizontal plane.  There is no prevalent convention for the directions of these two axes, but the orientations are usually chosen according to the [[#Orientation and handedness|right-hand rule]]. In three dimensions, the names &quot;abscissa&quot; and &quot;ordinate&quot; are rarely used for ''x'' and ''y'', respectively. When they are, the ''z''-coordinate is sometimes called the '''applicate'''.

The words ''abscissa'', ''ordinate'' and ''applicate'' are sometimes used to refer to coordinate axes rather than values.&lt;ref&gt;Springer online reference Encyclopaedia of Mathematics[http://eom.springer.de/a/a010970.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quadrants and octants===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Heraldry]] and from [[Quadrant (Cartesian coordinate system)]]--&gt;
[[Image:Cartesian coordinates 2D.svg|thumb|240px|The four quadrants of a Cartesian coordinate system.]]
The axes of a two-dimensional Cartesian system divide the plane into four infinite regions, called '''quadrants''', each bounded by two half-axes. These are often numbered from 1st to 4th and denoted by [[Roman numeral]]s: I (where the signs of the two coordinates are I (+,+), II (−,+), III (−,−), and IV (+,−).  When the axes are drawn according to the mathematical custom, the numbering goes [[clockwise|counter-clockwise]] starting from the upper right (&quot;northeast&quot;) quadrant.

Similarly, a three-dimensional Cartesian system defines a division of space into eight regions or '''octants''', according to the signs of the coordinates of the points.  The octant where all three coordinates are positive is sometimes called the '''first octant'''; however, there is no established nomenclature for the other octants. The n-dimensional generalization of the quadrant and octant is the [[orthant]].

==Cartesian space==
A [[Euclidean plane]] with a chosen Cartesian system is called a '''Cartesian plane'''.  Since Cartesian coordinates are unique and non-ambiguous, the points of a Cartesian plane can be identified with all possible pairs of [[real number]]s; that is with the [[Cartesian product]] &lt;math&gt;\R^2 = \R\times\R&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all reals.  In the same way one defines a '''Cartesian space''' of any dimension ''n'', whose points can be identified with the [[tuple]]s (lists) of ''n'' real numbers, that is, with &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Cartesian formulas for the plane==
=== Distance between two points ===
The [[Euclidean distance]] between two points of the plane with Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_2,y_2)&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is the Cartesian version of [[Pythagoras' theorem]].  In three-dimensional space, the distance between points &lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1,z_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_2,y_2,z_2)&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2+ (z_2-z_1)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
which can be obtained by two consecutive applications of Pythagoras' theorem.

===Euclidean transformations===
==== Translation ====
[[translation (geometry)|Translating]] a set of points of the plane, preserving the distances and directions between them, is equivalent to adding a fixed pair of numbers (''X'',''Y'') to the Cartesian coordinates of every point in the set.  That is, if the original coordinates of a point are (''x'',''y''), after the translation they will be
:&lt;math&gt;(x',y') = (x + X, y + Y).\,&lt;/math&gt;

====Scaling====
To make a figure larger or smaller is equivalent to multiplying the Cartesian coordinates of every point by the same positive number ''m''. If (''x'',''y'') are the coordinates of a point on the original figure, the corresponding point on the scaled figure has coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;(x',y') = (m x, m y).\,&lt;/math&gt;
If ''m'' is greater than 1, the figure becomes larger; if ''m'' is between 0 and 1, it becomes smaller.

====Rotation====
To [[rotation (geometry)|rotate]] a figure [[clockwise|counterclockwise]] around the origin by some angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to replacing every point with coordinates (''x'',''y'') by the point with coordinates  (''x&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'',''y&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''), where
:&lt;math&gt;x'=x \cos \theta - y \sin \theta\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y'=x \sin \theta + y \cos \theta.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Thus:
&lt;math&gt;(x',y') = ((x \cos \theta - y \sin \theta\,) , (x \sin \theta + y \cos \theta\,)).&lt;/math&gt;

====Reflection====
If (''x'', ''y'') are the Cartesian coordinates of a point, then (&amp;minus;''x'', ''y'') are the coordinates of its [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] across the second coordinate axis (the Y axis), as if that line were a mirror.  Likewise, (''x'', &amp;minus;''y'') are the coordinates of its reflection across the first coordinate axis (the X axis).

====General transformations====
The [[Euclidean transformation]]s of the plane are the translations, rotations, scalings, reflections, and arbitrary [[composition (mathematics)|compositions]] thereof.  The result &lt;math&gt;(x', y')&lt;/math&gt; of applying a Euclidean transformation to a point &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is given by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;(x',y') = (x,y) A + b\,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' is a 2×2 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] and ''b'' is a pair of numbers, that depend on the transformation; that is,
:&lt;math&gt;x' = x A_{1 1} + y A_{2 1} + b_{1}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y' = x A_{1 2} + y A_{2 2} + b_{2}.\,&lt;/math&gt;
The matrix ''A'' must have [[orthogonal]] rows with same Euclidean length, that is,
:&lt;math&gt;A_{1 1} A_{2 1} + A_{1 2} A_{2 2} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;A_{1 1}^2 + A_{1 2}^2 = A_{2 1}^2 + A_{2 2}^2.&lt;/math&gt;
This is equivalent to saying that ''A'' times its [[transpose]] must be a [[diagonal matrix]].  If these conditions do not hold, the formula describes a more general [[affine transformation]] of the plane.

The formulas define a translation [[if and only if]] ''A'' is the [[identity matrix]].  The transformation is a rotation around some point if and only if ''A'' is a [[rotation matrix]], meaning that
:&lt;math&gt;A_{1 1}^2 + A_{1 2}^2 = A_{2 1}^2 + A_{2 2}^2 = A_{1 1} A_{2 2} - A_{2 1} A_{1 2} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

==Orientation and handedness==
{{Main|Orientation (mathematics)}}
{{See also|right-hand rule}}
{{See also|Axes conventions}}
===In two dimensions===
[[Image:Rechte-hand-regel.jpg|left|thumb|The [[right hand rule]].]]
Fixing or choosing the ''x''-axis determines the ''y''-axis up to direction.  Namely, the ''y''-axis is necessarily the [[perpendicular]] to the ''x''-axis through the point marked 0 on the ''x''-axis.  But there is a choice of which of the two half lines on the perpendicular to designate as positive and which as negative.  Each of these two choices determines a different orientation (also called ''handedness'') of the Cartesian plane.

The usual way of orienting the axes, with the positive ''x''-axis pointing right and the positive ''y''-axis pointing up (and the ''x''-axis being the &quot;first&quot; and the ''y''-axis the &quot;second&quot; axis) is considered the ''positive'' or ''standard'' orientation, also called the ''right-handed'' orientation.

A commonly used mnemonic for defining the positive orientation is the ''[[right hand rule]]''. Placing a somewhat closed right hand on the plane with the thumb pointing up, the fingers point from the ''x''-axis to the ''y''-axis, in a positively oriented coordinate system.

The other way of orienting the axes is following the ''left hand rule'', placing the left hand on the plane with the thumb pointing up.

When pointing the thumb away from the origin along an axis, the curvature of the fingers indicates a positive rotation along that axis.

Regardless of the rule used to orient the axes, rotating the coordinate system will preserve the orientation.  Switching any two axes will reverse the orientation.

===In three dimensions===
[[Image:Cartesian coordinate system handedness.svg|left|250px|thumb|Fig. 7 – The left-handed orientation is shown on the left, and the right-handed on the right.]]

[[Image:Right hand cartesian.svg|right|thumb|250px|Fig. 8 – The right-handed Cartesian coordinate system indicating the coordinate planes.]]

Once the ''x''- and ''y''-axes are specified, they determine the [[line (geometry)|line]] along which the ''z''-axis should lie, but there are two possible directions on this line.  The two possible coordinate systems which result are called 'right-handed' and 'left-handed'.  The standard orientation, where the ''xy''-plane is horizontal and the ''z''-axis points up (and the ''x''- and the ''y''-axis form a positively oriented two-dimensional coordinate system in the ''xy''-plane if observed from ''above'' the ''xy''-plane) is called '''right-handed''' or '''positive'''.

The name derives from the [[right-hand rule]]. If the [[index finger]] of the right hand is pointed forward, the [[middle finger]] bent inward at a right angle to it, and the [[thumb]] placed at a right angle to both, the three fingers indicate the relative directions of the ''x''-, ''y''-, and ''z''-axes   in a ''right-handed'' system.  The thumb indicates the ''x''-axis, the index finger the ''y''-axis and the middle finger the ''z''-axis.  Conversely, if the same is done with the left hand, a left-handed system results.

Figure 7 depicts a left and a right-handed coordinate system.  Because a three-dimensional object is represented on the two-dimensional screen, distortion and ambiguity result. The axis pointing downward (and to the right) is also meant to point ''towards'' the observer, whereas the &quot;middle&quot; axis is meant to point ''away'' from the  observer.  The red circle is ''parallel'' to the horizontal ''xy''-plane and indicates rotation from the ''x''-axis to the ''y''-axis (in both cases).  Hence the red arrow passes ''in front of'' the ''z''-axis.

Figure 8 is another attempt at depicting a right-handed coordinate system. Again, there is an ambiguity caused by projecting the three-dimensional coordinate system into the plane. Many observers see Figure 8 as &quot;flipping in and out&quot; between a [[wikt:convex|convex]] cube and a [[wikt:concave|concave]] &quot;corner&quot;.  This corresponds to the two possible orientations of the coordinate system.  Seeing the figure as convex gives a left-handed coordinate system.  Thus the &quot;correct&quot; way to view Figure 8 is to imagine the ''x''-axis as pointing ''towards'' the observer and thus seeing a concave corner.

==Representing a vector in the standard basis==
A point in space in a Cartesian coordinate system may also be represented by a [[coordinate vector|vector]], which can be thought of as an arrow pointing from the origin of the coordinate system to the point. If the coordinates represent spatial positions (displacements) it is common to represent the vector from the origin to the point of interest as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;. In three dimensions, the vector from the origin to the point with Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes written as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = David J. Griffith | title = Introduction to Electromagnetics | publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1999|isbn= 0-13-805326-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} = x \mathbf{i} + y \mathbf{j} + z \mathbf{k} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; are [[unit vectors]] and the respective [[versor]]s of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axes.  This is the [[quaternion]] representation of the vector, and was introduced by [[Sir William Rowan Hamilton]].  The unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; are called the '''versors''' of the coordinate system, and are the vectors of the [[standard basis]] in three-dimensions.

==Applications==
Each axis may have different [[units of measurement]] associated with it (such as kilograms, seconds, pounds, etc.).  Although four- and higher-dimensional spaces are difficult to visualize, the algebra of Cartesian coordinates can be extended relatively easily to four or more variables, so that certain calculations involving many variables can be done.  (This sort of algebraic extension is what is used to define the geometry of higher-dimensional spaces.)  Conversely, it is often helpful to use the geometry of Cartesian coordinates in two or three dimensions to visualize algebraic relationships between two or three of many non-spatial variables.

The graph of a function or relation is the set of all points satisfying that function or relation. For a function of one variable, ''f'', the set of all points (''x'',''y'') where ''y'' = ''f''(''x'') is the graph of the function ''f''. For a function of two variables, ''g'', the set of all points (''x'',''y'',''z'') where ''z'' = ''g''(''x'',''y'') is the graph of the function ''g''. A sketch of the graph of such a function or relation would consist of all the salient parts of the function or relation which would include its relative extrema, its concavity and points of inflection, any points of discontinuity and its end behavior. All of these terms are more fully defined in calculus. Such graphs are useful in calculus to understand the nature and behavior of a function or relation.

The '''California Department of Transportation''' ('''Caltrans''') is a [[government]] department in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. Its mission is to improve mobility across the state. It manages the [[State highways in California|state highway system]] (which includes the [[California Freeway and Expressway System]]) and is actively involved with [[public transportation]] systems throughout the state. The department is part of the state [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]-level [[California Business, Transportation and Housing Agency]]. Its headquarters is in [[Sacramento]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.dot.ca.gov/mail.htm Caltrans Mail Addresses].&quot; California Department of Transportation. Retrieved on November 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Cal Trans District7 HD.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Caltrans District 7 Headquarters|District 7 Headquarters]], Los Angeles, birds-eye view (designed by [[Thom Mayne]] (2004))]]

The earliest predecessor of Caltrans was the Bureau of Highways, which was created by the [[California Legislature]] and signed into law by Governor [[James Budd]] in 1895.&lt;ref name=ForsythHagwood11&gt;Raymond Forsyth and Joseph Hagwood, ''One Hundred Years of Progress'' (Sacramento: California Transportation Foundation, 1996): 11&lt;/ref&gt;  This agency consisted of three commissioners who were charged with analyzing the state road system and making recommendations.  At the time, there was no state highway system, since roads were purely a local responsibility.  The roads of California consisted of crude dirt roads maintained by county governments as well as some paved roads within city boundaries, and this ''ad hoc'' system was no longer adequate for the needs of the state's rapidly growing population.  After the commissioners submitted their report to the Governor on November 25, 1896, the Legislature replaced the Bureau with the Department of Highways.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Forsyth and Joseph Hagwood, ''One Hundred Years of Progress'' (Sacramento: California Transportation Foundation, 1996): 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the state's weak fiscal condition and corrupt politics, little progress was made until 1907, when the Legislature replaced the Department of Highways with the Department of Engineering, within which there was a Division of Highways.&lt;ref name=ForsythHagwood11/&gt;  The voters approved a $18 million bond issue for the construction of a state highway system in 1910 and the first [[California Highway Commission|Highway Commission]] was convened in 1911.&lt;ref name=ForsythHagwood11/&gt;  On August 7, 1912, the Department broke ground on its first construction project, the section of [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] between [[South San Francisco, California|South San Francisco]] and [[Burlingame, California|Burlingame]] (now part of [[California State Route 82]]).&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Forsyth and Joseph Hagwood, ''One Hundred Years of Progress'' (Sacramento: California Transportation Foundation, 1996): 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  1912 also saw the founding of the Transportation Laboratory and the creation of seven administrative divisions (the predecessors of the 12 district offices that exist today).&lt;ref name=ForsythHagwood11/&gt;

In 1913, the Legislature started requiring vehicle registration and allocated the resulting funds to support regular highway maintenance, which began the next year.&lt;ref name=ForsythHagwood11/&gt;

In 1921, the Legislature turned the Department of Engineering into the Department of Public Works.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Forsyth and Joseph Hagwood, ''One Hundred Years of Progress'' (Sacramento: California Transportation Foundation, 1996): 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Caltrans and its predecessor agencies during the 20th century was marked by many firsts.  It was one of the first agencies in the U.S. to implement the painting of centerlines on highways statewide (thanks to [[June McCarroll]]); the first to build a freeway west of the Mississippi (the [[Pasadena Freeway]]); the first to build a [[Four Level Interchange|four-level stack interchange]]; the first to develop and deploy nonreflective raised pavement markers, better known as [[Botts' dots]]; and one of the first to implement dedicated freeway-to-freeway connector ramps for [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s.

In late 1972, the Legislature approved a reorganization (suggested by a study initiated by Governor [[Ronald Reagan]]), in which the Department of Public Works was merged with the Department of Aeronautics to become the modern Department of Transportation.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Forsyth and Joseph Hagwood, ''One Hundred Years of Progress'' (Sacramento: California Transportation Foundation, 1996): 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
For administrative purposes, Caltrans has divided the state of California into 12 districts supervised by district offices. Most districts cover multiple [[County (United States)|counties]]; District 12 ([[Orange County, California|Orange County]]) is the only district with one county. The largest districts by population are District 4 ([[San Francisco Bay Area]]) and District 7 ([[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Ventura County, California|Ventura]] counties). Like most state agencies, Caltrans maintains its headquarters in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], which is covered by District 3.

{{Campaignbox Continuation War}}

The '''Continuation War''' ({{lang-fi|jatkosota}}, {{lang-sv|fortsättningskriget}}, 25 June 1941–19 September 1944) was the second of two wars fought between Finland and the Soviet Union during World War II.

At the time of the war, the Finnish side used the name to make clear its perceived relationship to the preceding [[Winter War]].&lt;ref name=lavery&gt;{{cite book|title=The history of Finland|page=126| author=Jason Edward Lavery|publisher=Greenwood Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union saw the war as a part of its struggle against [[Third Reich|Germany]] and [[The Axis|its allies]], the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front of World War II]] or, as it was known in the Soviet Union, the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jokipii-3&quot;&gt;{{fi icon}} [[Mauno Jokipii|Jokipii, Mauno]], ''Jatkosodan synty'' (&quot;The Launching of the Continuation War&quot;), page 607. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], ''Finland'', Moscow, 1974. ISBN 0-02-880010-9&lt;/ref&gt; Germany regarded its operations in the region as a part of its overall war efforts of World War II. It provided critical material support and military cooperation to Finland. 

Acts of war between the two countries started on 22 June 1941, the day Germany launched its [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]]. Open warfare started with a Soviet air offensive on 25 June.  Subsequent Finnish operations undid its post-[[Winter War]] cessations on the [[Finnish reconquest of the Karelian Isthmus (1941)|Karelian Isthmus]] and [[Finnish reconquest of Ladoga Karelia (1941)|Ladoga Karelia]], and [[Finnish conquest of East Karelia (1941)|captured East Karelia]] by September 1941. Furthermore Finland passively participated in the [[siege of Leningrad]] for two and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Siege of Leningrad, Ballantines Illustrated History of WWII |last=Wykes |first=Alan |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1972 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=9-21 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World War II.

Eventually the Soviet [[Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive|strategic offensive]] in the summer of 1944 drove the Finns from most of the territories they had gained during the war but the Finnish Army later fought it to a standstill, leading to the [[Moscow Armistice]] in September. The [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaty]] concluded the war formally in 1947. Finland ceded [[Petsamo]] and rented [[Porkkala]] to the Soviet Union, and paid reparations of $300,000,000 equaling half of its annual gross domestic product in 1939, while Finland retained its independence.

==Background==
===Winter War===
{{Main|Background of the Winter War|Winter War}}
[[Image:Finn ski troops.jpg|thumb|Finnish ski troops in Northern Finland on 12 January 1940]]

On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Germany signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] where parties divided the independent countries of Finland, [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]] and [[Romania]] into [[spheres of interest]], with Finland falling to the Soviet sphere of interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-30&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, Germany [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded Poland]] and [[Great Britain]] and [[France]] declared war against Germany. The Soviet Union [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded eastern Poland]] on 17 September.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-31&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Next, Moscow demanded that the [[Baltic states]] allow the establishment of Soviet military bases and the stationing of troops on their soil. The Baltic governments [[Background of the occupation and annexation of the Baltic states|accepted ultimatums]], signing the corresponding agreements in September and in October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-33&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1939, the Soviet Union attempted to negotiate for Finnish territories on the [[Karelian Isthmus]], the islands of the [[Gulf of Finland]] and a military base near the Finnish capital [[Helsinki]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-39&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; The Finnish government refused, and the [[Red Army]] attacked on 30 November 1939.&lt;ref name= &quot;Vehvilainen2002-44&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Condemnation by the [[League of Nations]] and by countries all over the world had no effect on Soviet policy.&lt;ref name= &quot;Vehvilainen2002-49&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foreign support in the Winter War|International help to Finland]] was planned, but very little actual help materialized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-65&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Moscow Peace Treaty (1940)|Moscow Peace Treaty]], which was signed on 12 March 1940, ended the Winter War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-69&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The Treaty was severe for Finland as the country lost one eleventh of its national territory and about 13 per cent of its economic capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby2006-215&quot;&gt;[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; However, Finland had avoided having the Soviet Union annex the whole country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-70&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interim peace===
[[File:Finnish flag at half-mast interim pece helsinki 1940.jpg|thumb|Finnish flags are at [[half-mast]] after the publication of the peace terms.]]
{{Main|Interim Peace}}

The outcome of the Winter War was bitter for Finland and left a deep trauma. The country's foreign policy had been based on [[multilateralism|multilateral]] guarantees for support from the [[League of Nations]] and [[Nordic countries]] and was considered a failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-74&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Public opinion favored the re-conquest of [[Finnish Karelia]]. The defence of the country was declared first priority and military expenditures rose to nearly half of government spending. Finland received war material purchased and donated during and immediately after the Winter War. On the southern frontier, the Soviet Union had acquired a military base in [[Hanko]] near the Finnish capital of [[Helsinki]], employing over 30,000 military personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-75&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Finland also had to resettle [[Evacuation of Finnish Karelia|some 420,000 evacuees from the lost territories]]. To ensure the supply of food, it was necessary to clear new land for them to cultivate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-75&quot;/&gt; This issue was facilitated with the [[Rapid Settlement Act]]. The Finnish leadership wanted to preserve the [[Spirit of the Winter War|sprit of unanimity]] that was commonly felt throughout the country during the Winter War. The divisive [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guard]] tradition of the [[Finnish Civil War|Civil War]] 16th of May victory day celebration was therefore discontinued.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-76&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between Finland and the Soviet Union remained strained despite the signing of the one-sided peace treaty and there were disputes regarding the implementation of the conditions of the treaty. Finland sought security against further territorial depredations by the Soviet Union and proposed mutual defence agreements with [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]], but these initiatives were quashed by Moscow.&lt;ref name= &quot;Vehvilainen2002-77&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Kirby2006-216&quot;&gt;[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

===German and Soviet expansion in Europe===
[[File:Europe before Operation Barbarossa, 1941 (in German).png|thumb|Situation in Europe by May/June 1941, immediately before the [[Operation Barbarossa]].]]

After the Winter War, Germany was not popular in Finland as it was considered an ally of the Soviet Union. However, the Finnish government began to restore diplomatic relations with Germany. Finland continued its Western orientation policy and negotiated a war trade agreement with the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-77&quot;/&gt; but the agreement was renounced after the [[Operation Weserübung|German invasion of Denmark and Norway]] on 9 April, when Britain cut all trade and traffic communications with [[Scandinavia]]. With the [[Battle of France|fall of France]], a policy of Western orientation was no longer considered an option in Finnish foreign policy.&lt;ref name= &quot;Vehvilainen2002-78&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; On 15–16 June, the Soviet Union [[Occupation of the Baltic states|occupied the Baltic states]] without resistance. [[Puppet state|Puppet regimes]] were installed and within two months Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were incorporated as Soviet Republics within the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-79&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-1940, both the northern democracies of Finland and [[Sweden]] were encircled by the totalitarian states of Germany and the Soviet Union.

On 23 June, a short time after the Soviet occupation in the Baltic states, the Soviet foreign minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] contacted the Finns and demanded a mining licence in the [[nickel]] mines in [[Petsamo]] for the Soviet Union or to a joint Soviet-Finnish company. The licence to mine the deposit had earlier been granted to a British-Canadian company and the proposition was rejected. Next month, the Soviets demanded Finland destroy the fortifications built in the Åland islands and give the right to use Finnish railways for transporting troops to the newly acquired Soviet base at Hanko. The Finns very reluctantly agreed to these demands.&lt;ref name= &quot;Vehvilainen2002-80&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 July, Molotov accused the Finnish government of persecuting the so-called [[Finland – Soviet Union Peace and Friendship Society|Society for Peace and Friendship between Finland and USSR]], a pro-communist group, and soon after he publicly supported it. The society organized demonstrations, some of which turned into riots.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-81&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby2006-218&quot;&gt;[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finnish relations with Germany and the USSR===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-1206-523, Berlin, Verabschiedung Molotows.jpg|thumb|German [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] welcoming Soviet [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] in Berlin on 14 November 1940.]]

On 31 July 1940, the German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] gave the order to start planning an assault on the Soviet Union. This meant that Germany had to re-assess the positions of both Finland and [[Romania]]. Until then, Germany had rejected Finnish appeals to purchase arms but in August the Germans allowed the secret sale of weapons. Military authorities made an agreement on 12 September and an official exchange of diplomatic notes were sent on 22 September. At the same time, German troops [[Transit of German troops through Scandinavia (World War II)|were allowed to transit their troop]] through Sweden and Finland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby2006-220&quot;&gt;[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, this meant redrawing of the border between German and Soviet spheres of influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-83&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the changed situation, Molotov made a visit to [[Berlin]] on 12–13 November.&lt;ref name= &quot;Kirby2006-219&quot;&gt;[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted Germany to withdraw its troops from Finland and stop enabling Finnish anti-Soviet sentiments. He also reminded the Germans of the 1939 Soviet–German non-aggression pact. Hitler asked how the Soviet Union planned to settle the &quot;Finnish question&quot;. Molotov answered that it would happen in the same manner as in [[Bessarabia]] and the Baltic states. Hitler rejected this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-84&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Next December, The Soviet Union, Germany and Great Britain all voiced opinions concerning suitable Finnish presidential candidates. [[Risto Ryti]] was the only one of the candidates to whom none of three superpowers objected. He was elected on 19 December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-85&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1941, the Soviet Union demanded to take control of the Petsamo mining area. Finland rejected this, as it had by then a re-built defense force and the encouragement of Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-85&quot;/&gt; On 18 December 1940, Hitler had officially approved [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby2006-221&quot;&gt;[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Both Finland and Romania were expected to join in the campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-86&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Two days earlier, Finnish Major General [[Paavo Talvela]] had met German Colonel General [[Franz Halder]] and, a couple days later, [[Herman Göring]], in Berlin. This was the first time the Germans advised them, in carefully couched diplomatic terms, that they were preparing for a war with the Soviet Union. Outlines of the actual plan were revealed in January 1941 and regular contacts between Finnish and German military leaders started from February.&lt;ref name= &quot;Vehvilainen2002-86&quot;/&gt;

In late Spring 1941, the Soviet Union made a number of goodwill gestures in order to prevent Finland from completely falling under German influence. Soviet ambassador [[Ivan Zotov]] was replaced with the more flexible [[Pavel Orlov (diplomat)|Pavel Orlov]]. Furthermore, the Soviet government announced that it no longer opposed an approchement between Finland and Sweden. However, these conciliatory measures did not have effect on Finnish policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-87&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Path to war==
===Finnish-German agreement===
On 20 May, Germany invited Finnish officers to Germany to discuss the coordination of Operation Barbarossa. The participants met on 25–28 May in [[Salzburg]] and Berlin, and continued in [[Helsinki]] on 3–6 June. They agreed upon the arrival of German troops, Finnish mobilization and general division of operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-87&quot;/&gt; It was also agreed that the Finnish Army would start [[mobilization]] on 15 June, but the Germans did not reveal the final date for the assault. The Finnish decisions were made by a small group of political and military leaders and the rest of the government was largely kept in the dark. They were not told until the 9th of June that the country would start mobilization of [[reservist]]s due to tensions between Germany and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby2006-221&quot;/&gt;

===Deployments and pre-assaults===
[[File:Continuation War July 1941 English.jpg|thumb|Finnish, German and Soviet troops at the start of the Continuation War in June/July 1941. The Germans assaulted on 29 June from [[Petsamo]] area and the Finns assaulted on 1 July from [[Suomussalmi]] and [[Kuusamo]] area.]]

The Germans took responsibility for a {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} stretch of the front in the northern Finland, the [[Lapland (Finland)|Finnish Lapland]]. The Finnish army was now much stronger than it had been during the Winter War. Its total strength was 475,000 men and the [[artillery]] was relatively strong. However, there was only one [[tank]] battalion and a lack of motorized transportation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-90&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the war, the Soviet Union had only eighteen divisions in the region, against fifteen Finnish and four German divisions. The Finns also enjoyed [[air supremacy]]. Furthermore, the Soviet Union needed its best units and most up-to-date [[materiel]] on its western front.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-91&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

The German troops assaulted the Soviet Union on 22 June elsewhere but not in Finland. However, German minelayers hiding in the [[Archipelago Sea]] laid two large minefields across the [[Gulf of Finland]] in the late hours of 21 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nordberg&quot;&gt;{{fi icon}} Nordberg, Erkki, ''Arvio ja ennuste Venäjän sotilaspolitiikasta Suomen suunnalla'', 2003, ISBN 951-884-362-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Premium, 2006, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/207424/Finland ''Finland'']&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same night, German bombers flew along the Gulf of Finland to [[Leningrad]] and mined the harbour and the river [[Neva]]. On the return trip, these bombers landed for refueling on an airfield in Utti. Finland was concerned that the Soviet Union would occupy [[Åland]], so [[Operation Kilpapurjehdus]] (&quot;Regatta&quot;) was launched in the early hours of 22 June to occupy the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jokipii&quot;/&gt;

On 21 June, Finnish units began to concentrate at the Finnish-Soviet border, where they were arranged into defensive formations. Finland mobilised 16 infantry divisions, one cavalry brigade, and two [[Jäger (military)|jäger]] brigades, which were standard infantry brigades, except for an armoured battalion in the 1st [[Jaeger Brigade|Jäger Brigade]]. There were separate battalions mostly formed from border guard units and used mainly for reconnaissance. Soviet military plans estimated that Finland would be able to mobilise only 10 infantry divisions, as it had done in the Winter War, but they failed to take into account the materiel Finland had purchased between the wars and its training of all available men. Two German mountain divisions were stationed at [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]] and two infantry divisions at [[Salla]]. On the morning of 22 June, the German Mountain Corps Norway [[Operation Renntier|began its advance]] from northern Norway to Petsamo. Finland did not allow direct German attacks from its soil into the Soviet Union. On the same day, another German infantry division was moved in from Oslo to face [[Ladoga Karelia]].

The Soviet mobilisation had been underway since 18 June. The Karelian Isthmus was covered by the [[23rd Army (Soviet Union)|23rd Army]]. Ladoga Karelia was defended by the [[7th Army (Soviet Union)|7th Army]]. In the [[Murmansk]]–[[Salla]] region, there was the [[14th Army (Soviet Union)|14th Army]] with  the 42nd Corps. The Red Army also had around 40 battalions of separate regiments and fortification units present. Leningrad was garrisoned by three infantry divisions and one mechanized corps. As the initial devastating German strike against the Soviet Air Force had not affected air units located near Finland, the Soviets deployed 700 planes as well as some aircraft from the [[Soviet Navy|Navy]] against 300 Finnish planes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jokipii&quot;&gt;[[Mauno Jokipii|Jokipii, Mauno]], ''Jatkosodan synty'', 1987, ISBN 951-1-08799-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign of 1941==
[[File:Continuation War December 1941 English.jpg|thumb|The front in December 1941.]]

In the morning of 25 June, the Soviet Union launched an air offensive of 460 fighter bombers against 18 Finnish cities. There was considerable destruction in the cities and 23 planes were shot down. This offered the Finnish government a ground for claiming that the country had become the target of a new assault and the parliament approved the &quot;defend war&quot; as a ''[[fait accompli]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-88&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The message was more for public opinion in Finland than abroad, where it was seen that the country was in the German camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby2006-222&quot;&gt;[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, most Finns thought it was only to regain back what had been wrongly taken in the Winter War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-89&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union claimed the air attack was directed against German targets, especially airfields, in Finland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Platonov&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Platonov, S.P. (editor)|year=1964|title=Битва за Ленинград (&quot;The Battle for Leningrad&quot;)|publisher=Voenizdat Ministerstva oborony SSSR}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the British embassy verified that only Finnish targets, mainly civilian ones, were hit while no German targets were hit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} At the same time, Soviet artillery stationed at the Hanko base began to shell Finnish targets and a minor Soviet infantry attack was launched over the Finnish side of the border in [[Parikkala]].

The Soviet Union's war against Germany did not go as well as pre-war Soviet war games had envisioned{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and soon the [[Stavka|Soviet High Command]] had to call all available units to the rapidly deteriorating front line. Because of this, the initial air offensive against Finland could not be followed by a supporting land offensive in the scale originally planned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manninen2008-1&quot;&gt;[[#Manninen2008|Manninen (2008)]], ''Miten Suomi valloitetaan: Puna-armeijan operaatiosuunnitelmat 1939–1944'', Helsinki: Edita, 2008. ISBN 978-951-37-5278-1&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the 10th Mechanized Corps and the 237th Infantry Division were withdrawn from Ladoga Karelia, thus stripping reserves from the remaining defending units.

===Reconquest of Ladoga Karelia===
{{Main|Finnish reconquest of Ladoga Karelia (1941)}}

The Finnish offensive in Ladoga Karelia started on 4 July, and by 16 July it had already reached the shore of [[Lake Ladoga]] and cut the defending Soviet army in two, hindering the Soviet defense of the area. Finnish HQ stopped the offensive in Ladoga Karelia on 25 July after reconquering the area of Ladoga Karelia lost to Soviet Union in 1940 and advancing as far as Vitele, and then moved onto the offensive at other sections of the front.

===Reconquest of the Karelian Isthmus===
[[File:Viipuri recaptured.jpg|thumb|right|Finnish military parade in [[Vyborg|Viipuri]] on 31 August 1941, after its recapture.]]
{{Main|Finnish reconquest of the Karelian Isthmus (1941)}}

Finnish troops started their offensive in the region of the Karelian Isthmus on 31 July. Finnish troops reached the shores of lake Ladoga on 9 August, surrounding most of three defending Soviet divisions on the north-western coast of the lake from where they were evacuated across the lake. By 23 August, the Finns had reached the [[Vuoksi River|Vuoksi waterway]] from the east and continued to surround Soviet forces defending the [[Vyborg|Viipuri]]. The Soviet withdrawal order came too late, and divisions lost much of their equipment, although a sizable portion of their manpower was later evacuated via the [[Beryozovye Islands|Koivisto islands]]. The badly mauled defending Soviet army was unable to halt the Finnish offensive, and by 2 September they had reached the 1939 border along its whole length. On 31 August, Finnish HQ ordered the offensive to halt at a straightened line just past the former border and by mid-September the front had become quiet.

===Conquest of East Karelia===
{{Main|Finnish conquest of East Karelia (1941)}}

Finnish offensive in East Karelia started in early July in the northern section of the front. In early September, the attack in the northern section reached the Rukajärvi (Ругозеро, Rugozero) village and HQ halted the offensive there. In the southern area on August 27, Finnish HQ ordered the offensive to reach [[Svir River|Svir river]]. Finnish troops cut the Kirov railroad on 7 September and crossed the Svir on 15 September and then halted the offensive. Advance troops reached shores of [[Lake Onega]] on 24 September and the town of [[Petrozavodsk]] was captured on 1 October after the Soviets withdraw from the town to avoid encirclement. On 6 November, the Finnish HQ ordered their forces to capture [[Medvezhyegorsk|Karhumäki]] and then move to defense. The Finnish forces captured the area of [[Medvezhyegorsk|Karhumäki]] and [[Povenets]] and halted the offensive in early December.

===Operation Silver Fox on the North===
{{Main|Operation Silver Fox}}

The German objective in northern Finland was to take [[Murmansk]] and seize control of the [[Murman Railway]]. Murmansk was the only [[ice-free port]] year round in the north and a threat to the nickel mine of Petsamo. The [[Operation Silver Fox]] was run by the German [[Army Norway (Germany)|AOK Norwegen]] and had two Finnish divisions under its command. The German soldiers were from central Europe and they had difficulties moving over a roadless terrain of [[swamp]] and [[forest]]. Troops managed to advance some distance with heavy casualties, but the terrain offered good defensive positions for the Soviet resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-95&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

The order for German–Finnish troops to move to defensive operations was given on 17 November and attempts to reach the Murman Railway had failed.

===Naval campaign===
{{See|Baltic Sea Campaigns (1939–1945)}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MN-2787-30, Baltikum, gesunkenes russisches Schiff.jpg|thumb|Soviet troop transporter nearly sunk by German mines on 3 December 1941 in the Finnish Gulf during the Hanko evacuation]]

Though the [[Baltic Fleet|Red Banner Baltic fleet]] started the war in a strong position, the naval mine warfare, aerial supremacy and rapid changes to the land forces forced Soviet Navy to evacuate its bases to [[Kronstadt]] and [[Leningrad]]. Evacuations from [[Soviet evacuation of Tallinn|Tallinn]] and [[Battle of Hanko (1941)|Hanko]] proved to be very costly operations. As the Soviet Navy withdrew to the eastern end of the [[Gulf of Finland]] it left the nearly the whole of the [[Baltic Sea]] as well as many of the islands to the [[Kriegsmarine|Germans]] and the [[Finnish Navy|Finns]]. Though submarines caused some threat to German traffic on the Baltic, the withdrawal of the Soviet Navy made the Baltic Sea a 'German lake' until the second half of 1944. Though the Soviet navy left in a hurry, the naval mines it had managed to lay before and during the evacuations caused casualties both to the Germans and to the Finns, including the loss of one of the two Finnish coastal defence ships, the {{Ship|Finnish coastal defence ship|Ilmarinen||2}}.

===Political development===
The main forces of Germany advanced rapidly deep into the Soviet territory during the first weeks of campaign. The Finns believed the Germans would defeat the Soviet Union soon. President Ryti visionized [[Greater Finland]], where the country and other [[Finnic people]] would live inside &quot;natural defence borderline&quot; by incorporating the [[Kola Peninsula]], [[East Karelia]] and perhaps even northern [[Ingria]]. In public the proposed frontier was introduced by the slogan &quot;A short border – a long peace&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-92&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Some of members of parliament opposed the idea, such [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|social democrats]] and [[Swedish People's Party of Finland|Swedish-speaking party people]], and argument that 1939 frontier would be enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-92&quot;/&gt; The Commander-in-Chief [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|C.G.E. Mannerheim]] gave an order of the day on 10 July, the [[Sword scabbard declaration]], in which he pledged to liberate Karelia. The Finnish government assured to Americans that it was unaware of the order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby2006-224&quot;&gt;[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Finland had prepared for a short war, but in late autumn it was clear that there was no decisive outcome in the short term. The Finnish troops suffered losses during its advance, and overall German victory became unsure as their troops were [[Battle of Moscow|halted near Moscow]]. The Finnish economy suffered from a lack of labour, food shortages and increased prices. The Finnish government had to demobilize part of the army so that industrial and agricultural production would not collapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-96&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; In October, the Finns informed Germany that it would need {{convert|175000|ST|t|lk=on|abbr=on}} of [[grain]]s to manage till next year's harvest. German authorities would have rejected the request, but Hitler himself agreed. The annual grain deliveries {{convert|200000|ST|t|abbr=on}} amounted to almost ½ of the Finnish domestic crop. In November Finland decided to join the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-101&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; The advance in East Karelia was halted on 6 December. The Finns had suffered 75,000 casualties of whom 25,000 died during the advance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-96&quot;/&gt;

===Finland and Western Allies===
Finland worked to maintain good relations with the Western powers. The government stressed that Finland was fighting as a co-belligerent of Germany only against the Soviet Union to protect itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-96&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, Finland stressed that it was still the same democratic country as it had been in the Winter War. However, Great Britain had signed with the Soviet Union an agreement of joint action on 12 July. Furthermore, Finland had to close, under German pressure, the British [[legation]] in Helsinki. As a result, diplomatic relations between Finland and Great Britain were broken on 1 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-97&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 November, Britain presented Finland an ultimatum, in which it demanded that Finland cease military operations by 3 December.&lt;ref name= &quot;Vehvilainen2002-99&quot;/&gt; Unofficially Finland informed the Western powers that troops would halt their advance in the next few days. The reply did not satisfy Great Britain. It declared war on Finland on 6 December, following [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]] of [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[India]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-100&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between Finland and the [[United States]] were more complex. The American public was sympathetic to the 'brave little democracy' and there were still anti-communist feelings. At first, the U.S. empathised with the Finnish cause; however, the situation became problematic after Finnish troops crossed the 1939 border. Finnish and German troops were a threat to the [[Murmansk Railway]] and northern communication supply line between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-98&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 October, the U.S. demanded that Finland cease all hostilities against the Soviet Union and withdraw behind the 1939 border. In public President Ryti rejected the demands, but in private he wrote Mannerheim on 5 November asking him to halt the offensive. Mannerheim agreed and secretly instructed General [[Hjalmar Siilasvuo]] to break off the assault against the Murmansk Railway.&lt;ref name =&quot;Vehvilainen2002-99&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==1942–1943: Trench warfare==
[[File:Continuation War 1942 and Soviet assaults English.jpg|thumb|Trench warfare of the Continuation War in 1942. Soviets made four major assaults which all were repelled.]]

===Military operations===
{{See also|Baltic Sea Campaigns (1939–1945)}}

Though military operations during 1942–1943 were limited, the front did see some action. In early 1942, Soviet Karelian Front forces attempted to retake the [[Medvezhyegorsk]] which had been lost to the Finns in late 1941. As the spring came, the Soviet forces also went onto the offensive in the [[Svir River|Svir]] front as well as in Kiestinki region. All Soviet offensives started promisingly but either due to overextending their lines or by stubborn resistance, the Soviet offensives were stopped and repulsed. After Finnish and German (in Kiestinki) counterattacks, the eventual front lines had moved very little. On September 1942, the Soviets tried again at [[Kriv]] near [[Medvezhyegorsk]], but despite of five days of fighting, the Soviets managed to push back the Finnish lines only {{convert|500|m|yd|abbr=on}} on a roughly {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}}-long stretch of the front.

Unconventional warfare was fought in both the Finnish and Soviet wilderness. Finnish [[LRRP]]s organized both by Finnish HQ—4th Separate Battalion (Er.P 4)—and by local units patrolled beyond Soviet lines. In the summer of 1942, the Soviet Union had formed the 1st Partisan Brigade. The unit was only 'partisan' in the name as it was essentially more than 600 men and women on long range patrol. The 1st Partisan Brigade was able to infiltrate beyond Finnish patrol lines but was found out and largely destroyed.

On the naval front, the Soviet [[Baltic Fleet]] still operated from the besieged city of [[Leningrad]]. In early 1942, Soviet forces recaptured the island of [[Gogland]] but lost both [[Gogland]] and [[Bolshoy Tyuters]] to the Finns later in the spring of 1942. During the winter of 1941/1942, the Soviet Baltic Fleet made the decision to use the large Soviet submarine fleet to carry the fight to the enemy. Though initial submarine operations in the summer of 1942 were successful, the German [[Kriegsmarine]] and [[Finnish Navy]] soon stepped up their anti-submarine efforts, making the Soviet submarine operations later in 1942 very costly. The underwater offensive carried out by the Soviets convinced the Germans to lay [[anti-submarine net]]s as well as supporting minefields between [[Porkkala]] and [[Naissaar]] which proved to be an insurmountable obstacle for the Soviet submarines.

===Diplomatic manoeuvers===
[[Image:Hitler Mannerheim Ryti.jpg|thumb|Hitler, Marshal Mannerheim (Finnish Army chief) and Finnish President [[Risto Ryti|Ryti]] meet, [[Imatra]] — June 1942]]

Operation Barbarossa was planned as a ''[[blitzkrieg]]'' intended to last a few weeks. British and U.S. observers believed that the invasion would be concluded before August.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In the autumn of 1941, this turned out to be wrong, and leading Finnish military officers started to doubt Germany's capability to finish the war quickly. German troops in Northern Finland faced circumstances they were not properly prepared for, and failed to reach their targets, most importantly [[Murmansk]]. As the lines stabilized, Finland sent out peace feelers to the Soviet Union several times.&lt;ref name= &quot;EinoJutikkala1988&quot;&gt;[[#EinoJutikkala1988|Jutikkala 1988]], p.248&lt;/ref&gt; Germany was alarmed by this, and reacted by drawing down shipments of desperately needed materials each time. The idea that Finland had to continue the war while putting its own forces in the least possible danger gained increasing support, perhaps in the hope that the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' and the Red Army would wear each other down enough for negotiations to begin, or to at least get them out of the way of Finland's independent decisions. Nationalist elements, including the IKL, may also have continued to hope for an eventual victory by Germany.

Finland's participation in the war brought major benefits to Germany. The Soviet fleet was blockaded in the [[Gulf of Finland]], so that the Baltic was freed for the training of German submarine crews as well as for German shipping, especially for the transport of vital [[Swedish iron ore |iron ore from northern Sweden]] and [[Nickel deposits of Finland|nickel and rare metals]] (needed in steel processing) from the Petsamo area. The Finnish front secured the northern flank of the German [[Army Group North]] in the Baltic states. The sixteen Finnish divisions tied down numerous Soviet troops, put pressure on [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] (although Mannerheim refused to attack it directly), and threatened the Murmansk railway. Additionally, Sweden was further isolated and was increasingly pressured to comply with German and Finnish wishes, though with limited success.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Despite Finland's contributions to the German cause, the Western Allies had ambivalent feelings, torn between residual goodwill for Finland and the need to accommodate their vital ally, the Soviet Union. As a result, Britain declared war against Finland, but the U.S. did not. With few exceptions, there was no combat between these countries and Finland, but Finnish sailors were interned overseas. In the U.S., Finland was denounced for naval attacks made on American [[Lend-Lease]] shipments, but received approval for continuing to make payments on its World War I debt throughout the [[interbellum|inter-war period]].

Because Finland joined the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] and signed other agreements with Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Allies characterized Finland as one of the [[Axis Powers]], although the term used in Finland is &quot;[[co-belligerence]] with Germany&quot;, emphasizing the lack of a formal military alliance treaty.

===International volunteers and support===
Like in the [[Winter War]], Swedish volunteers were recruited. Until December they were tasked with guarding the Soviet naval base at [[Hanko]]. When it was evacuated by sea in December 1941, the Swedish unit was officially disbanded. During the Continuation War, the volunteers signed for three to six months of service. In all, over 1,600 fought for Finland, though only about 60 remained by the summer of 1944. About ⅓ of the volunteers had previously participated in the Winter War. Another significant group—about ¼ of the men—were Swedish officers on leave.

From 1942 to 1944 there was also a ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) battalion of volunteers on the northern Finnish front that was recruited from Norway, then under German occupation, and similarly, a [[Frikorps Danmark|some Danes]]. About 3,400 [[Finnish Infantry Regiment 200|Estonian volunteers]] took part. On other occasions, the Finns received around 2,100 Soviet prisoners of war in return for those POWs they turned over to the Germans. These POWs were mainly [[Estonians]] and [[Karelians]] who were willing to join the Finnish army. These, as well as some volunteers from occupied Eastern Karelia, formed the ''Kinship Battalion'' (Finnish: ''&quot;Heimopataljoona&quot;''). At the end of the war the USSR requested members of the Kinship Battalion to be handed over. Some managed to escape before or during transport, but most of them were either sent to the labor camps or executed.

===Finnish occupation policy===
{{Main|Finnish military administration in Eastern Karelia|East Karelian concentration camps}}

On 19 July 1941, the Finns set up the [[Finnish military administration in Eastern Karelia, 1941–1944|military administration]] in the occupied [[East Karelia]]. The goal of the administration was to prepare the region for eventual incorporation into Finland. In the early stage, the Finns aimed at [[ethnic cleansing]] where the Russian population would be moved out of the area once the war was over. They would be replaced with [[Finnic peoples]] such as [[Karelians]], [[Finns]], [[Estonians]], [[Ingrian Finns|Ingrians]], and [[Vepsians]]. The Russian population was deemed &quot;non-national&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby2006-225&quot;/&gt; Most of the East Karelian population had been evacuated before the Finnish forces arrived. About 85,000 people — mostly the elderly, women and children — were left behind, and less than ½ of them were [[Karelians]]. A significant number of civilians —almost 30% of the remaining Russians — were [[East Karelian concentration camps|interned in concentration camps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby2006-225&quot;&gt;[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

The winter of 1941–1942 was hard for the Finnish urban population due to poor harvests and a shortage of agricultural laborers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby2006-225&quot;/&gt; However, for the interned it was disastrous and over 3,500 of them died, mostly from [[famine]]. The figure was equivalent to 13.8% of the inmates, where the corresponding figure for the free population of the occupiped territories was 2.6% and for Finland proper 1.4%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-107&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions were gradually improved, and the following year ethnic discrimination in wage levels and food rations was terminated, and schools were established also for the Russian section of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby2006-226&quot;&gt;[[#DavidKirby2006|Kirby 2006]], p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the occupation the death rate dropped to the same level as in Finland proper.&lt;ref name= &quot;Vehvilainen2002-107&quot;/&gt;

===Soviet partisans===
{{Main|Soviet partisans#Finland and Karelia}}

Soviet partisans conducted a number of operations in Finland and in [[Eastern Karelia]] from 1941 to 1944. The major one failed when the 1st Partisan Brigade was destroyed in the beginning of August 1942 at lake [[Seesjärvi]]. Partisans distributed propaganda newspapers, &quot;[[Pravda]]&quot; in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and &quot;Lenin's Banner&quot; in [[Russian language|Russian]]. One of the leaders of the partisan movement in Finland and Karelia was [[Yuri Andropov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}}''[http://www.hrono.ru/biograf/andropov.html Andropov Yuri Vladimirovich]''.

===Jews in Finland===
{{Main|Jews in Finland}}

Finland had a small (approx. 2,300) [[jewish]] population. They had full civil rights and fought shoulder to shoulder with other Finns in the ranks of the Finnish Army. The Germans had mentioned the Finnish Jews at the [[Wannsee Conference]] in January 1942, wishing to transport them to [[Majdanek]] in [[General Gouvernment]]. SS leader [[Heinrich Himmler]] mentioned the Finnish Jews during his visit in Finland in the summer of 1942. Finnish Prime Minister [[Jukka Rangell]] replied that Finland had no ''[[Jewish question]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-102&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were differences for Jewish refugees in Finland. In November 1942, the Finns handed eight Jewish refugees over to the [[Gestapo]]. This raised protests among the Finnish Social Democrat ministers, and after this no more refugees were handed over.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vehvilainen2002-103&quot;&gt;[[#OlliVehvilainen2002|Vehviläinen 2002]], p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Over 500 Jewish refugees were granted [[right of asylum|asylum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yadvashem&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=|last=|author-link=|first2=| last2=|author2-link=|editor-last=|editor-first=|editor2-last=|editor2-first=|contribution=| contribution-url=|title=Finland|year=|pages=|place=|publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|url=http://yad-vashem.org.il/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%205852.pdf|format=PDF|doi=|id=|accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field [[synagogue]] in [[Eastern Karelia]] was one of the very few functioning synagogues on the Axis side during the war. There were even several cases of Jewish officers of Finland's army awarded the German [[Iron Cross]], which they declined. German soldiers were treated by Jewish medical officers who succeeded in saving their lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rautkallio&quot;&gt;{{fi icon}} Rautkallio, Hannu, ''Suomen juutalaisten aseveljeys'' (Finnish Jews as German Brothers in Arms), Tammi, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tuulikki Vuonokari (2003), ''Jews in Finland During the Second World War'', Finnish Institutions Student Paper: FAST Area Studies Program Department of Translation Studies, University of Tampere, Autumn 2003 [http://www.uta.fi/FAST/FIN/HIST/tv-jews.html].

===Finland and the Western Allies===
The Continuation War represents the only case of a genuinely democratic state participating in World War II on the side of the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]], albeit without being a signatory of the [[Tripartite Pact]]. The United Kingdom declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941 (Finnish Independence Day), with Canada and New Zealand declaring war on Finland on 7 December and Australia and South Africa declaring war the next day. The U.S. Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] congratulated the Finnish envoy on 3 October 1941 for the liberation of Karelia but warned Finland not to enter Soviet territory; furthermore, the U.S. did not declare war on Finland when they went to war with the Axis countries and, together with UK, approached Stalin in the [[Tehran Conference]] about acknowledging Finnish independence. However, the U.S. government seized Finnish [[merchant vessel|merchant ships]] in American ports, and in the summer of 1944 shut down Finnish diplomatic and commercial offices in the U.S. as a result of President Ryti's treaty with Germany. The U.S. government later warned Finland about the consequences of continued adherence to the Axis.&lt;ref&gt;World War II: [http://worldwar2database.com/html/finland.htm Finland]&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-known British action on Finnish soil was an aircraft carrier [[Raid on Kirkenes and Petsamo|strike on German and Finnish ships]] in the Finnish harbour of [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]] on 31 July 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;pvfkvi&quot;&gt;FAA archive: [http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/RollofHonour/Battlehonour_crewlists/Petsamo_Kirkenes_1941.html Raid on Petsamo]&lt;/ref&gt; This attack achieved little except the loss of three British aircraft, but it was intended as a demonstration of British support for its Soviet ally. Later in 1941, [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] of [[No. 151 Wing RAF]], based at Murmansk, provided local air cover for Soviet troops and fighter escorts for Soviet bombers.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Royal Air Force]] in Russia :[http://ww2airfronts.org/Theaters/eto/rinr/pages/rinr-1.html Hurricanes at Murmansk]&lt;/ref&gt; The British contribution to the war was occasional but significant.

[[Finnish radio intelligence]] is said to have participated effectively in German actions against British convoys to [[Murmansk]].&lt;ref&gt;Ahtokari, Reijo and Pale, Erkki: ''Suomen Radiotiedustelu 1927–1944'' (Finnish radio intelligence 1927–1944), Helsinki, Hakapaino Oy, pp. 191–198, ISBN 952-90-9437-X&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the war, German aircraft operating from airfields in northern Finland attacked British air and naval units based in Murmansk and [[Archangelsk]].

===Overtures for peace===
{{Main|Bombing of Helsinki in World War II|Battle of Narva (1944)|Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive}}

Finland began to actively seek a way out of the war after the disastrous German defeat at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in February 1943. [[Edwin Linkomies]] formed a new cabinet with peace as the top priority. Negotiations were conducted intermittently in 1943–44 between Finland and its representative—[[Juho Kusti Paasikivi]]—on one side and the Western Allies and the Soviet Union on the other, but no agreement was reached. Stalin decided to force Finland to surrender; a [[Bombing of Helsinki in World War II|bombing campaign on Helsinki]] followed. The air campaign in February 1944 included three major air attacks involving a total of over 6,000 [[sortie]]s. Finnish anti-aircraft defences managed to repel the raids as only 5% of the dropped [[Aerial bomb|bomb]]s hit their planned targets. Major air attacks also hit [[Oulu]] and [[Kotka]] but, because of radio intelligence and effective [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defence]]s, the number of casualties was small.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mäkelä_67&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Mäkelä|first1=Jukka|title=Helsinki liekeissä|publisher=Werner Söderström osakeyhtiö|year=1967|location=Helsinki|page=20|url=|doi=|id=| isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the lengthy and ferocious [[Battle of Narva (1944)|German defence in Narva]] aided by [[20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian)|Estonians]] denied a Soviet-occupied Estonia as a favorable base for amphibious invasions and air attacks against Helsinki and other Finnish cities. The tactical success of the army detachment &quot;Narwa&quot; from mid-February to April diminished the hopes of the Stavka to assault Finland and force it into [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] from Estonia.&lt;ref name=paulman&gt;{{cite book|language=Russian|author =F.I.Paulman|title=Ot Narvy do Syrve (From Narva to Sõrve)|publisher=Eesti Raamat|location=Tallinn|year=1980|pages=7–119|chapter=Nachalo osvobozhdeniya Sovetskoy Estoniy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=laar2&gt;{{cite book |title=Estonia in World War II|last=Laar|first=Mart|year=2005|publisher=Grenader|authorlink=Mart Laar|location=Tallinn|pages=32–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=baltic&gt;{{cite book|title=Battle of the Baltic: The Wars 1918-1945|author=Robert Jackson|year=2007|location=Barnsley|publisher=Pen &amp; Sword Maritime}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finland terminated the negotiations in mid-April of 1944&lt;ref name=&quot;Gebhardt-1&quot;&gt;[[#Gebhardt|Gebhardt 1989]], p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; when it became apparent that Soviet terms were impossible to fulfill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moisala&quot;&gt;[[#Moisala|Moisala 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Tali-Ihantala.jpg|thumb|Finnish troops passing by the remains of a destroyed Soviet T-34 at the battle of Tali-Ihantala]]

===Soviet strategic offensive===
On 9 June 1944, the Soviet Union opened [[Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive|a major offensive]] against Finnish positions on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] and in the area of [[Lake Ladoga]] (it was timed to accompany [[D-Day]]&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Tehran Conference|Declaration of the Three Powers, December 1, 1943, Tehran Conference]]&lt;/ref&gt;). On the {{convert|21.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}-wide breakthrough segment the Red Army had concentrated 3,000 guns and mortars. In some places, the concentration of artillery pieces exceeded 200 guns for every kilometer of the front (one every {{convert|5|m|yd|abbr=on}}). On that day, Soviet artillery fired over 80,000 rounds along the front on the Karelian Isthmus. On the second day of the offensive, the Soviet forces broke through the Finnish front lines. The Soviets penetrated the [[VT-line|second line of defence]] by the sixth day. The Soviet pressure on the Karelian Isthmus forced the Finns to reinforce the area. This allowed the second Soviet offensive in Eastern Karelia to meet less resistance and to capture [[Petrozavodsk]] by 28 June 1944. The main objective of the offensives was to force Finland from the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gebhardt-2&quot;&gt;[[#Gebhardt|Gebhardt 1989]], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Finland especially lacked modern antitank weaponry which could stop Soviet heavy tanks, and German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] offered these in exchange for a guarantee that Finland would not seek a separate peace again. On 26 June, President [[Risto Ryti]] gave [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement|this guarantee as a personal undertaking]], which he intended to last for the remainder of his presidency. In addition to delivering thousands of hand-held ''[[Panzerfaust]]'' and ''[[Panzerschreck]]'' antitank weapons (German equivalents of American [[bazooka]]s), Hitler sent the 122nd Infantry Division, ½-strength 303rd Assault Gun Brigade, and a ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' ''[[Detachment Kuhlmey|Gefechtsverband Kuhlmey]]'' to provide temporary support in the most threatened defense sectors.

With new supplies from Germany, the Finnish army halted the Soviet advance in early July 1944. At this point, the Finnish forces had retreated about one hundred kilometres, which brought them to approximately the same line of defence they had held at the end of the Winter War. This line was known as the [[VKT-line]] (short for &quot;''Viipuri–Kuparsaari–Taipale''&quot;, running from [[Vyborg]] to [[River Vuoksi]] to Lake Ladoga at [[Taipale]]), where the Finnish Army stopped the Soviet offensive in the [[Battle of Tali-Ihantala]] in spite of the Soviet numerical and material superiority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Bg8drRyDGhEC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=%22Battle+of+Tali-Ihantala%22&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Battle%20of%20Tali-Ihantala%22&amp;f=false 500 Days: The War in Eastern Europe ... – Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=p58vtOKyVy8C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22Tali-Ihantala%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tali-Ihantala%22&amp;f=false Finland at War 1939–45 – Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Dh6jydKXikoC&amp;pg=PA467&amp;dq=Ihantala+battle&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Ihantala%20battle&amp;f=false Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: F-O – Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; The front stabilized once again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Bg8drRyDGhEC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=%22Battle+of+Tali-Ihantala%22&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Battle%20of%20Tali-Ihantala%22&amp;f=false 500 Days: The War in Eastern Europe ... – Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=p58vtOKyVy8C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22Tali-Ihantala%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tali-Ihantala%22&amp;f=false Finland at War 1939–45 – Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Dh6jydKXikoC&amp;pg=PA467&amp;dq=Ihantala+battle&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Ihantala%20battle&amp;f=false Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: F-O – Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; A few battles were fought in the latter stages of the war.

==Prisoners of war==

===Soviet prisoners of war in Finland===
{{Main|Soviet prisoners of war in Finland}}

The number of Soviet prisoners of war was estimated to be around 64,000 persons. Of these, 56,000 were captured in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Juutilainen &amp; Leskinen (ed.); Kujansuu, Juha (2005), p. 1036&lt;/ref&gt; About 2,600–2,800 Soviet prisoners of war were handed over to the Germans in exchange for roughly 2,200 [[Finnic peoples|Finnic]] prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'': [http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20031118IE7  &quot;Wartime refugees made pawns in cruel diplomatic game.&quot;] 8 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Food was especially scarce in 1942 in Finland due to a bad harvest, and this was the primary reason for the number of deaths. Out of 64,188 Soviet POWs, 18,318 died in Finnish [[prisoner of war camp]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ylikangas&quot;&gt;{{fi icon}} Ylikangas, Heikki, ''[http://www2.vnk.fi/julkaisukansio/2004/j05-heikki-ylikankaan/pdf/fi.pdf Heikki Ylikankaan selvitys Valtioneuvoston kanslialle]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}'', Government of Finland&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finnish prisoners of war in the Soviet Union===
{{Main|Finnish prisoners of war in the Soviet Union}}

There are two views of the number of Finnish prisoners of war. The Soviet and Russian view is that of 2,377 Finnish prisoners of war who reached the prison camps 1,954 were returned after [[Moscow Armistice]]. The Finnish view is that of original ~3,500 prisoners of war only ~2,000 were returned (more than 40% perished). The difference can be at least partially explained by Soviet practice of counting only the prisoners who survived to reach a prison camp.

Mannerheim had repeatedly reminded the Germans that in case [[Battle of Narva (1944)|their troops in Estonia]] retreated, Finland would be forced to make peace even on extremely unfavourable terms.&lt;ref&gt;Howard D. Grier. ''Hitler, Dönitz, and the Baltic Sea'', Naval Institute Press, 2007, ISBN 1-59114-345-4. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=u4IbqxEQeBMC&amp;sig=ACfU3U1y5qvHJPiPkpX74WKLzPbPX7KK5g&amp;pg=PA121#PPA121,M1 p. 121]&lt;/ref&gt; The territory of Estonia would have provided the Soviet army with a favourable base for amphibious invasions and air attacks against Finland's capital, [[Helsinki]], and other strategic targets in Finland, and would have strangled Finnish access to the sea. The initial German reaction to Finland's announcement of ambitions for a separate peace was limited to only verbal opposition. However, the Germans arrested hundreds of sailors on Finnish merchant ships in Germany, Denmark and Norway.

Previously, in return for critically needed food and defense materiel from the Germans, President Ryti had personally committed, in writing, that no separate peace with the Soviets would be attempted. Accordingly, it became clear that he must resign, paving the way for a separate peace. Finland's military leader and national hero, [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]], was extraordinarily appointed president by the parliament, accepting responsibility for ending the war.

On 4 September, the cease-fire ended military actions on the Finnish side. The Soviet Union ended hostilities exactly 24 hours after the Finns. An [[Moscow armistice|armistice]] between the Soviet Union and Finland was signed in Moscow on 19 September. Finland had to make many concessions: the Soviet Union regained the borders of 1940, with the addition of the Petsamo area (now [[Pechengsky District]], Russia); the [[Porkkala]] peninsula (adjacent to Helsinki) was leased to the USSR as a naval base for fifty years and transit rights were granted; Finland's army was to be demobilized with haste, and Finland was required to expel all German troops from its territory within 14 days. As the Germans did not leave Finland in time for the given deadline, the Finns fought their former allies in the [[Lapland War]]. Finland was also to clear the [[Land mine|minefields]] in Karelia (including East Karelia) and in the Gulf of Finland. Retreating German forces had also mined northern Finland heavily. The [[demining]] was a long operation, especially in the sea areas, lasting until 1952. 100 Finnish army personnel were killed and over 200 wounded during this process, most of them in Lapland.

Nevertheless, in contrast to the rest of the Eastern front countries, where the war was fought to the end, a Soviet occupation of Finland did not occur and the country retained sovereignty. Neither did Communists rise to power as they had in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. A policy called the ''[[Paasikivi–Kekkonen line]]'' formed the basis of Finnish foreign policy towards the Soviet Union until its [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|dissolution in 1991]].

Finland's main goal during World War II—although it was nowhere openly stated—was to survive the war as an independent democratic country, capable of maintaining its sovereignty in a politically hostile environment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Specifically for the Continuation War, Finland also aimed at reversing its territorial losses under the March 1940 [[Moscow Peace Treaty (1940)|Moscow Peace Treaty]] and by extending its territory further east, to have more non-Finnish land to defend before armies from the USSR could enter Finnish territories. Some small{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} right-wing groups also supported a [[Greater Finland]] ideology. Finland's efforts during World War II were, as regards [[Finlandization|survival]] and with hindsight, successful, although the price was high in war casualties, reparation payments, territorial loss, bruised international reputation, and subsequent careful consideration of Soviet international perspectives during the [[Cold War]]. The Finnish–German alliance was different from most of the other Axis relationships, an example of which is represented by the participation of Finnish Jews in the fight against the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uta.fi/~tuulikki.vuonokari/fin-1.html|title=Jews in Finland During the Second World War|accessdate=2008-01-17|author=Tuulikki Vuonokari|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=2003-11-21|work=|publisher=University of Tampere

[[Image:Mannerheim studying a map.jpg|left|thumb|Finland's supreme commander Field Marshal Mannerheim at his headquarters.]]

Finland adopted the concept of a &quot;parallel war&quot; whereby it sought to pursue its own objectives in concert with, but separate from, Nazi Germany.

Major events of World War II, and the tides of war in general, had a significant impact on the course of the Continuation War:
*Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union ([[Operation Barbarossa]]) is closely connected to the Continuation War's beginning.
*The [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invasion of France ([[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]]) was coordinated with the [[Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive|Soviet major offensive]] against Finland (9 June-15 July 1944).&lt;ref name= &quot;EinoJutikkala1988&quot;/&gt;
*The subsequent Soviet and Allied advances towards Germany drew away the interest in military operations from [[Northern Europe]] hastening the end of the Continuation War.

Soviet war goals are harder to assess due to the secretive nature of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] Soviet Union. Soviet sources maintain that Soviet policies up to the Continuation War were best explained as defensive measures by offensive means: the division of occupied Poland with Germany, the occupation of [[Lithuanian SSR|Lithuania]], [[Soviet occupations of Latvia|Latvia]] and [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]], and the attempted invasion of Finland in the Winter War are described as elements in the construction of a security zone or buffer region between the perceived threat from the [[capitalism|capitalist]] powers of Western Europe and the [[Communism|Communist]] Soviet Union—as some see the post-war establishment of Soviet [[satellite state]]s in the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries and the [[Finno–Soviet Treaty of 1948|Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance]] concluded with post-war Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}}[http://www.aroundspb.ru/finnish/baryshnikov/pvp1932.php The problem of ensuring the security of Leningrad from the north in light of Soviet war planning of 1932–1941] by V.

Being a buffer zone between Germany and the USSR, the Baltic states were bound to them by a system of economic and non-aggression treaties of 1926, 1932 and 1939''&lt;/ref&gt; Western historians such as [[Norman Davies]] and [[John Lukacs]] dispute this view and describe the prewar Soviet policy as attempting to stay out of the war and regaining land lost after the fall of the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''No simple victory'', 2007, ISBN 978-0-670-01832-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Finland was the only German co-belligerent that did not signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] in 1940. For Adolf Hitler the matter was irrelevant and he saw Finland as an ally.&lt;ref name= &quot;Vehvilainen2002-102&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Chinese remainder theorem''' is a result about [[modular arithmetic|congruences]] in [[number theory]] and its generalizations in [[abstract algebra]].

== Theorem statement ==

The original form of the theorem, contained in a third-century AD book ''Sun Zi suanjing'' (孫子算經 The Mathematical Classic by Sun Zi) by [[China|Chinese]] mathematician [[Sun Tzu (mathematician)|Sun Tzu]] and later republished in a 1247 book by [[Qin Jiushao]], the ''Shushu Jiuzhang'' (數書九章 [[Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections]]) is a statement about simultaneous congruences (see [[modular arithmetic]]).

Suppose ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are positive [[integer]]s which are [[pairwise coprime]]. Then, for any given set of integers ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, there exists an integer ''x'' solving the system of simultaneous congruences

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 x &amp;\equiv a_1 \pmod{n_1} \\
 x &amp;\equiv a_2 \pmod{n_2} \\
   &amp;{}\  \  \vdots \\
 x &amp;\equiv a_k \pmod{n_k}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, all solutions ''x'' to this system are congruent modulo the product ''N'' = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;…''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Hence &lt;math&gt;x \equiv y \pmod{n_i}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;1\leq i \leq k&lt;/math&gt;, if and only if &lt;math&gt;x \equiv y \pmod{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

Sometimes, the simultaneous congruences can be solved even if the ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''s are not pairwise coprime. A solution ''x'' exists if and only if:

:&lt;math&gt;a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{\gcd(n_i,n_j)} \qquad \mbox{for all }i\mbox{ and }j . \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

All solutions ''x'' are then congruent modulo the [[least common multiple]] of the ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.

An alternative method for solving similar systems of equations was described by [[Aryabhata]] (6th century; see {{harvnb|Kak|1986}}). Special cases of the Chinese remainder theorem were also known to [[Brahmagupta]] (7th century), and appear in [[Fibonacci]]'s [[Liber Abaci]] (1202).

A modern restatement of the theorem in the algebraic language is that for a positive integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; with prime factorization &lt;math&gt;p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} \cdots p_k^{r_k}&lt;/math&gt; we have the isomorphism between a ring and the direct product of its prime power parts:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/p_1^{r_1}\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/p_2^{r_2}\mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}/p_k^{r_k}\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

== Existence ==

Existence can be seen by an explicit construction of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. We will use the notation &lt;math&gt;[a^{-1}]_b&lt;/math&gt; to denote the inverse of &lt;math&gt;a \pmod b&lt;/math&gt;, it is defined exactly when &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are coprime - the following construction explains why the coprimality condition is needed.

=== Case of two equations ===

Given the system (corresponding to &lt;math&gt;k=2&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 x &amp;\equiv a_1 \pmod{n_1} \\
 x &amp;\equiv a_2 \pmod{n_2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

We define the value

:&lt;math&gt;x := a_1 n_2 [n_2^{-1}]_{n_1} + a_2 n_1 [n_1^{-1}]_{n_2}&lt;/math&gt;

and it is seen to satisfy both congruences by reducing. For example

:&lt;math&gt;a_1 n_2 [n_2^{-1}]_{n_1} + a_2 n_1 [n_1^{-1}]_{n_2} \equiv a_1 1 + a_2 0 [n_1^{-1}]_{n_2} \equiv a_1 \pmod {n_1}&lt;/math&gt;

=== General case ===

The same type of construction works in the general case of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; congruence equations. Let &lt;math&gt;N = n_1 n_2 \cdots n_k &lt;/math&gt; be the product of every modulus then define

:&lt;math&gt;x := \sum_{i} a_i \frac{N}{n_i} \left[\left(\frac{N}{n_i}\right)^{-1}\right]_{n_i}&lt;/math&gt;

and this is seen to satisfy the system of congruences by a similar calculation as before.

== A constructive algorithm to find the solution ==

The following algorithm only applies if the &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;'s are [[pairwise coprime]]. (For simultaneous congruences when the moduli are not pairwise coprime, the [[method of successive substitution]] can often yield solutions.)

Suppose, as above, that a solution is required for the system of congruences:

:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_i \pmod{n_i} \quad\mathrm{for}\; i = 1, \ldots, k.&lt;/math&gt;

Again, to begin, the product &lt;math&gt; N=n_1n_2\ldots n_k&lt;/math&gt; is defined. Then a solution ''x'' can be found as follows.

For each ''i''&amp;nbsp;the integers &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N/n_i&lt;/math&gt; are coprime. Using the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] we can find integers &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;r_in_i + s_iN/n_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Then, choosing the label &lt;math&gt;e_i=s_iN/n_i&lt;/math&gt;, the above expression becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; r_i n_i + e_i = 1 \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

Consider &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt;. The above equation guarantees that its remainder, when divided by &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;, must be 1. On the other hand, since it is formed as &lt;math&gt;s_iN/n_i&lt;/math&gt;, the presence of ''N'' guarantees that it's evenly divisible by any &lt;math&gt;n_j&lt;/math&gt; so long as &lt;math&gt;j\ne i&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;e_i \equiv 1 \pmod{n_i} \quad \mathrm{and} \quad e_i \equiv 0 \pmod{n_j} \quad \mathrm{for} ~ i \ne j&lt;/math&gt;

Because of this, combined with the multiplication rules allowed in congruences, one solution to the system of simultaneous congruences is:

:&lt;math&gt; x = \sum_{i=1}^k a_i e_i.\! &lt;/math&gt;

For example, consider the problem of finding an integer ''x'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}, \,\! &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 3 \pmod{4}, \,\! &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 1 \pmod{5}. \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

Using the extended Euclidean algorithm for  ''x'' modulo 3 and 20 [4&amp;times;5], we find (−13) &amp;times; 3 + 2 &amp;times; 20 = 1, i.e. ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 40. For ''x'' modulo 4 and 15 [3&amp;times;5], we get (−11) &amp;times; 4 + 3 &amp;times; 15 = 1, i.e. ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 45. Finally, for ''x'' modulo 5 and 12 [3&amp;times;4], we get 5 &amp;times; 5 + (−2) &amp;times; 12 = 1, i.e. ''e''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = −24. A solution ''x'' is therefore 2 &amp;times; 40 + 3 &amp;times; 45 + 1 &amp;times; (−24) = 191. All other solutions are congruent to 191 modulo 60, [3 &amp;times; 4 &amp;times; 5 = 60] which means that they are all congruent to 11 modulo 60.

NOTE: There are multiple implementations of the extended Euclidean algorithm which will yield different sets of &lt;math&gt;e_1=-20&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e_2=-15&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;e_3=-24&lt;/math&gt;. These sets however will produce the same solution i.e. (-20)2+(-15)3+(-24)1=-109=11 modulo 60.

== Statement for principal ideal domains ==

For a [[principal ideal domain]] ''R'' the Chinese remainder theorem takes the following form: If ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''u&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are elements of ''R'' which are [[pairwise coprime]], and ''u'' denotes the product ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''u&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', then the [[quotient ring]] ''R/uR'' and the [[product of rings|product ring]] ''R/u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''R''× ... × ''R/u&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;R'' are isomorphic via the [[ring homomorphism|isomorphism]]

:&lt;math&gt;f : R/uR \rightarrow R/u_1R \times \cdots \times
R/u_k R &lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;f(x +uR) = (x + u_1R, \ldots , x +u_kR) \quad\mbox{ for every } x\in R. &lt;/math&gt;

This isomorphism is unique;
the inverse isomorphism can be constructed as follows. For each ''i'', the elements ''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''u/u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are coprime, and therefore there exist elements ''r'' and ''s'' in ''R'' with

:&lt;math&gt;r u_i + s u/u_i = 1. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Set ''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''s u/u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then the inverse of ''f'' is the map

:&lt;math&gt;g : R/u_1R \times \cdots \times R/u_kR
\rightarrow R/uR &lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;g(a_1+u_1R,\ldots ,a_k+u_kR)=
\left( \sum_{i=1}^k a_i e_i \right) + uR \quad\mbox{ for all }a_1,\ldots,a_k\in R. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that this statement is a straightforward generalization of the above theorem about integer congruences: the ring '''Z''' of [[integer]]s is a principal ideal domain, the [[surjective|surjectivity]] of the map ''f'' shows that every system of congruences of the form
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_i \pmod{u_i} \quad\mathrm{for}\; i = 1, \ldots, k&lt;/math&gt;
can be solved for ''x'', and the [[injective|injectivity]] of the map ''f'' shows that all the solutions ''x'' are congruent modulo ''u''.

== Statement for general rings ==

The general form of the Chinese remainder theorem, which implies all the statements given above, can be formulated for commutative [[ring (algebra)|rings]] and [[ring ideal|ideals]]. If ''R'' is a commutative ring and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''I&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are ideals of ''R'' which are pairwise [[Coprime#Generalizations|coprime]] 
(meaning that &lt;math&gt;I_i+\bigcap_{j\ne i}I_j=R&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;),
then the product ''I'' of these ideals is equal to their intersection, and the [[quotient ring]] ''R/I'' is isomorphic to the [[product of rings|product ring]] ''R''/''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; x ''R''/''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; x ... x ''R''/''I''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; via the [[ring homomorphism|isomorphism]]

:&lt;math&gt;f : R/I \rightarrow R/I_1 \times \cdots \times R/I_k &lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;f(x + I) = (x +I_1, \ldots , x+I_k) \quad\text{ for all } x\in R.&lt;/math&gt;

Here is a version of the theorem where ''R'' is not required to be commutative:

Let ''R'' be any ring with 1 (not necessarily commutative) and &lt;math&gt; I_1, \ldots , I_n &lt;/math&gt; be pairwise coprime 2-sided ideals. Then the canonical R-module homomorphism &lt;math&gt; R \rightarrow R/I_1 \times \cdots \times R/I_k &lt;/math&gt; is onto, with kernel &lt;math&gt;I_1\cap \cdots \cap I_k&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt; R/(I_1\cap \cdots \cap I_k) \simeq R/I_1 \times \cdots \times R/I_k &lt;/math&gt; (as ''R''-modules).

== Applications ==
*In the [[RSA|RSA algorithm]] calculations are made modulo ''n'', where ''n'' is a product of two large [[prime number]]s ''p'' and ''q''. 1024-, 2048- or 4096-[[bit]] integers ''n'' are commonly used, making calculations in &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{Z}/n\Bbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; very time-consuming. By the Chinese remainder theorem, however, these calculations can be done in the isomorphic ring &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{Z}/p\Bbb{Z} \oplus \Bbb{Z}/q\Bbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; instead. Since ''p'' and ''q'' are normally of about the same size, that is about &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;, calculations in the latter representation are much faster. Note that RSA algorithm implementations using this isomorphism are more susceptible to [[fault injection]] attacks.

*The Chinese remainder theorem may also be used to construct an elegant [[Gödel numbering for sequences]], which is needed to prove [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]].

*The following example shows a connection with the classic polynomial interpolation theory. Let ''r'' complex points (&quot;interpolation nodes&quot;) &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_r&lt;/math&gt; be given, together with the complex data &lt;math&gt;a_{j,k}\ &lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 1\leq j\leq r &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 0\leq k&lt;\nu_j&lt;/math&gt;. The general [[Hermite interpolation]] problem asks for a polynomial &lt;math&gt;\textstyle P(x)\in \C[x]&lt;/math&gt; taking the prescribed derivatives in each node &lt;math&gt;\lambda_j\ &lt;/math&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt;P^{(k)}(\lambda_j)=a_{j,k}\quad\forall 1\leq j\leq r\ , 0\leq k&lt;\nu_j&lt;/math&gt;.
:Introducing the polynomials
::&lt;math&gt;\textstyle A_j(x):=\sum_{k=0}^{\nu_j-1}\frac{a_{j,k}}{k!}(x-\lambda_j)^k&lt;/math&gt;,
:the problem may be equivalently reformulated as a system of &lt;math&gt;r\ &lt;/math&gt; simultaneous congruences:
::&lt;math&gt;P(x)\equiv A_j(x)\pmod{(x-\lambda_j)^{\nu_j}},\quad\forall 1\leq j\leq r\ &lt;/math&gt;.
:By the Chinese remainder theorem in the principal ideal domain &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\C[x]&lt;/math&gt;, there is a unique such polynomial &lt;math&gt;\textstyle P(x)&lt;/math&gt; with degree &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\deg(P)&lt;n:=\sum_j\nu_j&lt;/math&gt;. A direct construction, in analogy with the above proof for the integer number case, can be performed as follows. Define the polynomials &lt;math&gt;\textstyle Q:=\prod_{i=1}^{r}(x-\lambda_i)^{\nu_i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle Q_j:=\frac{Q}{(x-\lambda_j)^{\nu_j}}&lt;/math&gt;. The [[partial fraction decomposition]] of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{1}{Q}&lt;/math&gt; gives ''r'' polynomials &lt;math&gt;\textstyle S_j&lt;/math&gt; with degrees &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\deg(S_j)&lt;\nu_j&lt;/math&gt; such that
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Q}=\sum_{i=1}^{r}\frac{S_i}{(x-\lambda_i)^{\nu_i}}&lt;/math&gt;,
:so that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 1=\sum_{i=1}^{r}S_i Q_i&lt;/math&gt;. Then a solution of the simultaneous congruence system is given by the polynomial
::&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^{r} A_i S_i Q_i = A_j + \sum_{i=1}^{r}(A_i-A_j) S_i Q_i\equiv A_j\pmod{(x-\lambda_j)^{\nu_j}}\quad\forall 1\leq j\leq r\  &lt;/math&gt;;
:and the minimal degree solution is this one reduced modulo &lt;math&gt;\textstyle Q&lt;/math&gt;, that is the unique with degree less than ''n''.

*The Chinese remainder theorem can also be used in [[Secret sharing]], which consists of distributing a set of shares among a group of people who, all together (but no one alone), can recover a certain secret from the given set of shares. Each of the shares is represented in a congruence, and the solution of the system of congruences using the Chinese remainder theorem is the secret to be recovered. [[Secret Sharing using the Chinese Remainder Theorem]] uses, along with the Chinese remainder theorem, special sequences of integers that guarantee the impossibility of recovering the secret from a set of shares with less than a certain [[cardinality]].

*The Good-Thomas [[fast Fourier transform]] algorithm exploits a re-indexing of the data based on the Chinese remainder theorem. We refer to the main article [[Prime-factor FFT algorithm]].

*Dedekind's theorem on the linear independence of characters states (in one of its most general forms) that if ''M'' is a [[monoid]] and ''k'' is an [[integral domain]], then any finite family &lt;math&gt;\left(f_i\right)_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; of distinct monoid homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;f_i:M\to k&lt;/math&gt; (where the monoid structure on ''k'' is given by multiplication) is linearly independent, i. e. every family &lt;math&gt;\left(\alpha_i\right)_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; of elements &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i\in k&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in I}\alpha_i f_i=0&lt;/math&gt; must be equal to the family &lt;math&gt;\left(0\right)_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt;.
:''Proof using the Chinese Remainder Theorem:'' First, assume that ''k'' is a field (otherwise, replace the integral domain ''k'' by its quotient field, and nothing will change). We can linearly extend the monoid homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;f_i:M\to k&lt;/math&gt; to ''k''-algebra homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;F_i:k\left[M\right]\to k&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k\left[M\right]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[monoid ring]] of ''M'' over ''k''. Then, the condition &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in I}\alpha_i f_i=0&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in I}\alpha_i F_i=0&lt;/math&gt; by linearity. Now, we notice that if &lt;math&gt;i\neq j&lt;/math&gt; are two elements of the index set ''I'', then the two ''k''-linear maps &lt;math&gt;F_i:k\left[M\right]\to k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_j:k\left[M\right]\to k&lt;/math&gt; are not proportional to each other (because if they were, then &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; would also be proportional to each other, and thus equal to each other since &lt;math&gt;f_i\left(1\right)=1=f_j\left(1\right)&lt;/math&gt; (since &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; are monoid homomorphisms), contradicting the assumption that they be distinct). Hence, their kernels &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ker} F_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ker} F_j&lt;/math&gt; are distinct. Now, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ker} F_i&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal ideal of &lt;math&gt;k\left[M\right]&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt; (since &lt;math&gt;k\left[M\right] / \mathrm{Ker} F_i\cong F_i\left(k\left[M\right]\right)=k&lt;/math&gt; is a field), and the ideals &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ker} F_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ker} F_j&lt;/math&gt; are coprime whenever &lt;math&gt;i\neq j&lt;/math&gt; (since they are distinct and maximal). The Chinese Remainder Theorem (for general rings) thus yields that the map
::&lt;math&gt;\phi: k\left[M\right] /  K\to \prod_{i\in I}k\left[M\right] /  \mathrm{Ker} F_i&lt;/math&gt;
:given by
::&lt;math&gt;\phi\left(x+K\right)=\left(x+\mathrm{Ker} F_i\right)_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in k\left[M\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:is an isomorphism, where &lt;math&gt;K=\prod_{i\in I}\mathrm{Ker} F_i=\bigcap_{i\in I}\mathrm{Ker} F_i&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, the map
::&lt;math&gt;\Phi: k\left[M\right]\to \prod_{i\in I}k\left[M\right] /  \mathrm{Ker} F_i&lt;/math&gt;
:given by
::&lt;math&gt;\Phi\left(x\right)=\left(x+\mathrm{Ker} F_i\right)_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in k\left[M\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:is surjective. Under the isomorphisms &lt;math&gt;k\left[M\right] /  \mathrm{Ker} F_i\to F_i\left(k\left[M\right]\right)=k&lt;/math&gt;, this map &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the map
::&lt;math&gt;\psi: k\left[M\right]\to \prod_{i\in I}k&lt;/math&gt;
:given by
::&lt;math&gt;x\mapsto\left(F_i\left(x\right)\right)_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x\in k\left[M\right]&lt;/math&gt;.
:Now, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in I}\alpha_i F_i=0&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in I}\alpha_i u_i=0&lt;/math&gt; for every vector &lt;math&gt;\left(u_i\right)_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; in the image of the map &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is surjective, this means that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in I}\alpha_i u_i=0&lt;/math&gt; for every vector &lt;math&gt;\left(u_i\right)_{i\in I}\in \prod_{i\in I}k&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, &lt;math&gt;\left(\alpha_i\right)_{i\in I}=\left(0\right)_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt;, qed.

== Non-commutative case: a counter-example ==
The Chinese remainder theorem does not hold in the non-commutative case. Consider the ring ''R'' of non-commutative real polynomials in ''x'' and ''y''. Let ''I'' be the principal two-sided ideal generated by ''x'' and ''J'' the principal two-sided ideal generated by &lt;math&gt;xy+1.&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;I+J=R&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;I\cap J \neq IJ.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Proof ===

Observe that ''I'' is formed by all polynomials with an ''x'' in every term and that every polynomial in ''J'' vanishes under the substitution &lt;math&gt;y=-1/x&lt;/math&gt;. Consider the polynomial &lt;math&gt;p=(xy+1)x&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly &lt;math&gt;p\in I\cap J&lt;/math&gt;. Define a term in ''R'' as an element of the multiplicative monoid of ''R'' generated by ''x'' and ''y''. Define the degree of a term as the usual degree of the term after the substitution &lt;math&gt;y=x&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, suppose &lt;math&gt;q\in J&lt;/math&gt;. Observe that a term in ''q'' of maximum degree depends on ''y'' otherwise ''q'' under the substitution &lt;math&gt;y=-1/x&lt;/math&gt; can not vanish. The same happens then for an element &lt;math&gt;q\in IJ&lt;/math&gt;. Observe that the last ''y'', from left to right, in a term of maximum degree in an element of &lt;math&gt;IJ&lt;/math&gt; is preceded by more than one ''x''. (We are counting here all the
preceding ''x''s. e.g. in &lt;math&gt;x^2yxyx^5&lt;/math&gt; the last ''y'' is preceded by &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; ''x''s.) This proves that &lt;math&gt;(xy+1)x\notin IJ&lt;/math&gt; since that last ''y'' in a term of maximum degree (&lt;math&gt;xyx&lt;/math&gt;) is preceded by only one ''x''. Hence &lt;math&gt;I\cap J\neq IJ&lt;/math&gt;.

On the other hand, it is true in general that &lt;math&gt;I+J = R&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;I \cap J = IJ + JI&lt;/math&gt;. To see this, note that &lt;math&gt; I \cap J = (I \cap J) (I+J) \subset IJ + JI&lt;/math&gt;, while the opposite inclusion is obvious. Also, we have in general that, provided &lt;math&gt;I_1, \ldots, I_m&lt;/math&gt; are
pairwise coprime two-sided ideals in ''R'', the natural map

:&lt;math&gt;R / (I_1 \cap I_2 \cap \ldots \cap I_m) \rightarrow R/I_1 \oplus R/I_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus R/I_m&lt;/math&gt;

is an isomorphism. Note that &lt;math&gt;I_1 \cap I_2 \cap \ldots \cap I_m&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced by a sum over all orderings of
&lt;math&gt;I_1, \ldots, I_m&lt;/math&gt; of their product (or just a sum over enough orderings, using inductively that &lt;math&gt;I \cap J = IJ + JI&lt;/math&gt;
for coprime ideals &lt;math&gt;I, J&lt;/math&gt;).

'''Cyril M. Kornbluth''' (July 23, 1923 – March 21, 1958) was an [[United States|American]] [[science fiction]] [[author]] and a notable member of the [[Futurians]]. He used a variety of [[pen-name]]s, including '''Cecil Corwin''', '''S. D. Gottesman''', '''Edward J. Bellin''', '''Kenneth Falconer''', '''Walter C.

==Biography==
Kornbluth was born and grew up in [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Rich | first = Mark | title = C. M. Kornbluth | publisher = McFarland | year = 2009 | location = Jefferson, NC | pages = 20 | isbn = 9780786443932}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, he became a member of the [[Futurians]], the influential group of [[science fiction fandom|science fiction fans]] and writers. While a member of the Futurians, he met and became friends with [[Isaac Asimov]], Frederik Pohl, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], [[Robert A. W. Lowndes]], and his future wife Mary Byers. He also participated in the [[Fantasy Amateur Press Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fancyclopedia.editme.com/BLITZKRI Fancyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kornbluth served in the [[United States Army|US Army]] during [[World War II]] ([[European Theatre of World War II|European Theatre]]). He received a [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] for his service in the [[Battle of the Bulge]], where he served as a member of a [[heavy machine gun]] crew. Upon his discharge, he returned to finish his education, which had been interrupted by the war, at the [[University of Chicago]].

==Work==
Kornbluth began writing at 15. His first solo story, &quot;The Rocket of 1955,&quot; was published in [[Richard Wilson (author)|Richard Wilson]]'s [[fanzine]] ''Escape'' (Vol 1 No 2, August 1939); his first collaboration, &quot;Stepsons of Mars,&quot; written with Richard Wilson and published under the name &quot;Ivar Towers,&quot; appeared in the April 1940 ''[[Astonishing Stories|Astonishing]]''. His other short fiction includes &quot;[[The Little Black Bag]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Marching Morons]]&quot;, &quot;The Altar at Midnight,&quot; &quot;MS. Found in a Chinese Fortune Cookie,&quot; &quot;Gomez&quot; and &quot;The Advent on Channel 12.&quot;

&quot;MS. Found in a Chinese Fortune Cookie&quot; (1957) is purportedly written by Kornbluth from notes by &quot;Cecil Corwin&quot; who has been declared insane and incarcerated, from where he is smuggling out in fortune cookies the ultimate secret of life. This fate was Kornbluth's response to the unauthorized publication of &quot;Mask of Demeter&quot; (as by &quot;Corwin&quot; and &quot;Martin Pearson&quot; Donald A. Wollheim) in 1953.

&quot;The Little Black Bag&quot; was first televised as a live act on the television show &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot; on May 30, 1952. It was later adapted for television by the [[BBC]] in 1969 for its ''[[Out of the Unknown]]'' series. In 1970, the same story was adapted by [[Rod Serling]] for an episode of his ''[[Night Gallery]]'' series. This dramatization starred [[Burgess Meredith]] as the alcoholic Dr. William Fall, who had long lost his doctors license and become a street wino/alcoholic. He finds a bag containing advanced medical technology from the future (2098), which, after an unsuccessful attempt to pawn it, he uses benevolently — reclaiming his career and redeeming his soul... but not that of the guttersnipe he takes in as his alcoholic money hungry assistant.

&quot;[[The Marching Morons]]&quot; is one of Kornbluth's most famous short stories; it is a satirical look at a far future in which the world's population consists of five billion idiots and a few million geniuses — the precarious minority of the &quot;elite&quot; working desperately to keep things running behind the scenes. Part of its appeal is that readers identify with the beleaguered geniuses (which is entirely compatible with science fiction fans' broadly held opinion of their relationship with the [[mundane]] majority). Some believe that &quot;The Marching Morons&quot; is a direct sequel to &quot;The Little Black Bag&quot;: it is easy to miss this, as &quot;Bag&quot; is set in the contemporary present while &quot;Morons&quot; takes place several centuries from now, and there is no character who appears in both stories. The titular black bag in the first story is actually an artifact from the time period of &quot;The Marching Morons&quot;: a medical kit filled with self-driven instruments enabling a far-future moron to &quot;play doctor.&quot; A future Earth similar to &quot;The Marching Morons&quot; is used in the final stages of ''Search the Sky''.

Many of Kornbluth's novels were written as collaborations: either with [[Judith Merril]] (using the pseudonym [[Cyril Judd]]), or with Frederik Pohl. By far the most successful and important of these were the novels ''[[Gladiator-At-Law]]'' and ''[[The Space Merchants]]''. ''[[The Space Merchants]]'' contributed significantly to the maturing and to the wider academic respectability of the science fiction genre, not only in America but also in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance: [[Zoran Živković (writer)|Zoran Živković]], ''Contemporaries of the Future - Savremenici budućnosti'', Belgrade, Serbia, 1983, pp.&amp;nbsp;250-261.&lt;/ref&gt; Kornbluth also wrote several novels under his own name, the most successful being ''[[The Syndic]]'' and ''[[Not This August]]''.

==Death==
Kornbluth died at age 34 in [[Levittown, New York]]. Scheduled to meet with [[Robert P. Mills|Bob Mills]] in [[New York City]], Kornbluth had to shovel out his driveway, which left him running behind. Racing to make his train, he suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on the platform of the train station.

A number of short stories remained unfinished at Kornbluth's death; these were eventually completed and published by Pohl. One of these stories, &quot;The Meeting&quot; (''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'', November 1972), was the co-winner of the 1973 [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]]; it tied with [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s &quot;Eurema's Dam.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcon.org/hy.html#73&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all of Kornbluth's solo SF stories have been collected as ''His Share of Glory: The Complete Short Science Fiction of C. M. Kornbluth'' ([[NESFA Press]], 1997).

==Personality and habits==
Frederik Pohl, in his autobiography ''The Way the Future Was'', [[Damon Knight]], in his memoir ''[[Futurians|The Futurians]]'', and [[Isaac Asimov]], in his memoirs ''[[In Memory Yet Green]]'' and ''I. Asimov: A Memoir'', all give vivid descriptions of Kornbluth as a man of odd personal habits and vivid eccentricities. Among the traits which they describe:
* Kornbluth decided to educate himself by reading his way through an entire encyclopedia from A to Z; in the course of this effort, he acquired a great deal of esoteric knowledge that found its way into his stories...in alphabetical order by subject. When Kornbluth wrote a story that mentioned the ancient Roman weapon ''ballista'', [[Pohl]] knew that Kornbluth had finished the &quot;A&quot; volume and had started the &quot;B&quot;.
* According to Frederik Pohl, Kornbluth never brushed his teeth, and they were literally green. Deeply embarrassed by this, Kornbluth developed the habit of holding his hand in front of his mouth when speaking.
* Kornbluth disliked black coffee, but felt obliged to acquire a taste for it because he believed that professional authors were &quot;supposed to&quot; drink black coffee. He trained himself by putting gradually less cream into each cup of coffee he drank, until he eventually &quot;weaned himself&quot; (Knight's description) and switched to black coffee.

[[Image:Ch.megacephala wiki.jpg|thumb|A female Oriental Latrine Fly (''[[Chrysomya megacephala]]'') feeds on animal feces.]]
'''Coprophagia''' is the consumption of [[feces]], from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κόπρος ''copros'' (&quot;feces&quot;) and φαγεῖν ''phagein'' (&quot;to eat&quot;).  Many [[animal]] [[species]] practice coprophagia as a matter of course; other species do not normally consume feces but may do so under unusual conditions. Coprophagy refers to many kinds of feces eating including eating feces of other species (heterospecifics), other individuals (allocoprophagy), or its own (autocoprophagy), those once deposited or taken directly from the [[anus]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa, H. 2001. [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/mam/2001/00000031/00000001/art00005 &quot; Coprophagy in leporids and other mammalian herbivores&quot;] Mammal Review, Volume 31, Number 1, pp. 61-80(20)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coprophagia in plants and animals ==
Some carnivorous plants, such as pitcher plants of the genus ''[[Nepenthes]]'', obtain nourishment from the feces of commensal animals.

[[Image:Dscn3200-2-butterflies.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[Common Blue]] [[Butterfly|butterflies]] consume a small lump of [[feces]] lying on a rock.]]
[[Image:Physiphora alceae female.jpg|thumb|A female fly feeding on feces]]
Coprophagous insects consume and [[digestion|redigest]] the [[feces]] of large animals. These feces contain substantial amounts of semi-digested [[food]] ([[herbivore]]s' [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive systems]] are especially inefficient).  The most notable feces-eating insect is the [[dung-beetle]] and the most common is the [[fly]].

[[pig|Pigs]], like the above insects, will eat the feces of herbivores that leave a significant amount of semi-digested matter. In certain cultures, it was common for poor families to collect horse feces to feed their pigs. However, allowing domestic pigs to consume feces contributes to the risk of parasite infection.

[[Capybara]], [[rabbit]]s, [[hamsters]] and other related species do not have a complex [[ruminant]] digestive system. Instead they extract more [[nutrition]] from [[grass]] by giving their food a second pass through the [[Gastrointestinal tract|gut]]. Soft [[fecal pellet]]s of partially digested food are [[excretion|excreted]] and generally consumed immediately. Consuming these [[cecotrope]]s is important for adequate nutritional intake of [[Vitamin B12]].  They also produce normal [[feces|droppings]], which are not eaten.

Young [[elephant]]s, [[Giant Panda|pandas]], [[koala]]s, and [[Hippopotamus|hippo]]s eat the [[feces]] of their [[mother]] or other animals in the herd to obtain the [[bacteria]] required to properly digest [[vegetation]] found on the [[savanna]] and in the [[jungle]]. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/adaptations/Coprophagia] When they are born, their [[intestine]]s do not contain these bacteria (they are completely sterile).  Without them, they would be unable to obtain any nutritional value from [[plant]]s.

[[Gorillas]] eat their own feces and the feces of other gorillas. Similar behavior has also been observed among [[Chimpanzees]].  Such behavior may serve to improve absorption of vitamins or of nutritive elements made available from the re-ingestion of seeds.

[[Hamsters]], [[guinea pigs]] and [[chinchillas]] eat their own droppings, which are thought to be a source of [[vitamin]]s [[B vitamins|B]] and [[Vitamin K|K]], produced by bacteria in the gut. [[Ape]]s have been observed eating [[horse]] feces for the [[salt]] content. [[Monkey]]s have been observed eating elephant feces. Coprophagia also has been observed in the [[naked mole rat]].

[[Cat]] mothers are known to eat the feces of their newborn [[kitten]]s during the very earliest phase after birth, presumably to eliminate cues to potential predators and to keep the den clean. 

Both domesticated and wild mammals are known to consume feces. In the wild they either bury or eat waste to protect their trail from predators. In species of cats, the dominant feline openly displays feces. In domesticated mammals, choosing not to offend the dominant owner, they eat or more prominently bury waste.

=== Coprophagia in dogs ===
{{Original research|section|date=July 2008}}
Coprophagia is a behavior often observed in [[dogs]]. Hofmeister, Cumming, and Dhein (2001) wrote that this behavior in dogs has not been well-researched and prepared a study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Hofmeister, Erik, Melinda Cumming, and Cheryl Dhein | title= Owner Documentation of Coprophagia in the Canine | year=2001 | url=http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/pets/_archive/study.htm  |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070427142031/http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/pets/_archive/study.htm |archivedate = 2007-04-27}}  Accessed November 17, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a [http://home.gci.net/~divs/behavior/coprophagia.html preliminary paper], they write that there are various hypotheses for this behavior in [[Canidae|canine]]s, although none have been proven:
*Dogs are, by nature, [[scavenger]]s, and this might be within the range of scavenger behavior.
*Dogs might want attention from their caretakers.
*They might have [[anxiety]] or [[stress (biological)|stress]].
*To clean up in crowded surroundings
*They had been punished for having [[defecation|defecated]] in the past, and attempt to clean up out of fear of being punished again.
*They may be trying to prevent the [[scent]] from attracting [[predator]]s.
*The texture and [[temperature]] of fresh feces approximates that of [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitated]] food, which is how mothers in the wild provide solid food to their pups.
*Feces (particularly [[cat]] feces) contain [[protein]]; overfeeding can also increase the quantity of undigested matter in the feces.
*The coprophagia may be due to assorted health problems, including:
**[[Pancreatitis]]
**[[Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency|Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency]]
**[[Intestine|Intestinal]] infections
**[[Food allergy|Food allergies]], leading to malabsorption
*The dogs might be [[hunger|hungry]], such as when eating routines are changed, food is withheld, or [[nutrient]]s are not properly absorbed.
*[[Carnivore]]s may sometimes eat or roll in the feces of their [[prey]] to [[ingestion|ingest]] and exude scents that mask their own.
Another hypothesis is that dogs want to investigate the diet of their opponents and get more acquainted with their smell.

Some [[veterinarian]]s recommend adding pineapple to dog food, as this makes the feces taste excessively bad to dogs.  Several companies produce [[food additive]]s that can also be added to the animal's food to make feces taste bad. Often, these food additives will contain [[Capsicum Oleoresin]], which gives off a repugnant odor making the fecal matter undesirable to the dog.

== Coprophagia in human beings ==
=== Sexual aspects ===
Some [[Coprophilia|coprophiles]] engage in this practice. Psychologists using the classification system of the [[DSM-IV]] would consider this a symptom of the [[paraphilia]] called [[coprophilia]] &quot;if the behavior, sexual urges, or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning&quot;. Coprophagia is also depicted in [[pornography]], usually under the term ''scat'' (from ''[[scatology]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Holmes |first= Ronald M. |title= Sex Crimes: Patterns and Behavior |publisher= Sage Publications |location= Thousand Oaks |isbn= 0761924175 |oclc= 47893709 |pages= ''p''. 244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical aspects ===
Centuries ago, [[physicians]] used to taste their patients' [[excretion]]s, to better judge their state and condition.&lt;ref&gt;notes to ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=qsv_Y0DOVUsC The Works of Francis Rabelais, Volume II, Volume 2]'', p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fecal bacteriotherapy]] is when feces from a close relative or spouse are given to patients suffering from intractable [[diarrhea]] caused by ''[[Clostridium difficile]]''. The purpose is to repopulate the intestines with the normal [[gut flora]] (intestinal [[bacteria]]) to decimate the clostridium. The healthy stool is administered by [[nasogastric tube]], [[enema]], or in a [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]].

Consuming other [[human feces|people's feces]] carries the risk of contracting diseases and bacteria spread through fecal matter, such as [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]], [[Hepatitis A]], [[Hepatitis E]], [[pneumonia]], [[polio]], and [[influenza]].  Coprophagia also carries a risk of contracting [[intestinal parasite]]s.

Lewin (2001) reports that &quot;... consumption of fresh, warm [[camel]] feces has been recommended by [[Bedouin]]s as a remedy for bacterial [[dysentery]]; its efficacy (probably attributable to the [[antibiotic]] [[subtilisin]] from ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'') was confirmed by [[Afrika Korps|German soldiers]] in [[Africa]] during [[World War II]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lewin, Ralph A.| title=More on Merde| journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine| year=2001| volume=44| issue=4| pages=594–607| doi   = 10.1353/pbm.2001.0067 | pmid = 11600805 }}.  The quotation was found by Google Scholar [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22its+efficacy+(probably+attributable+to+the+antibiotic+subtilisin+from+Bacillus+subtilis)+was+confirmed+by+German+soldiers+in+Africa+during+World+War+II%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search here].&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction of foreign bacteria into the human GI tract via infusion of fecal enemas is, moreover, an established medical practice in cases of ulcerative colitis, especially where the patient's own intestinal flora has been significantly depleted by antibiotic therapy applied for other maladies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journals.lww.com/jcge/Abstract/2003/07000/Treatment_of_Ulcerative_Colitis_Using_Fecal.12.aspx Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis Using Fecal Bacteriotherapy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the psychiatry literature, coprophagia has been observed in a small number of patients with [[schizophrenia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Harada KI, Yamamoto K, Saito T.| title = Effective treatment of coprophagia in a patient with schizophrenia with the novel atypical antipsychotic drug perospirone | journal = Pharmacopsychiatry | year = 2006 | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 113 | doi = 10.1055/s-2006-941487  | pmid = 16721701 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Major depressive disorder|depression]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wise, T.N., and R.L.

=== In literature ===
*[[Francois Rabelais]], in his classic ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'', often employs the expression ''mâche-merde'' or ''mâchemerde'', meaning ''shit-chewer''. It is in turn a citation of the Greek comedians [[Aristophanes]] and particularly [[Menander]], which often use the term skatophagos (''σκατοϕάγος'').&lt;ref&gt;Rabelais, Book 1, ch.40 and Book 3 chap. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In one dialogue, Rabelais speaks of coprophagia as a [[Christian]] gesture, saying that monks ''swallow the shit of the world, that is the sins'', and for this they are ostracized by society.&lt;ref&gt;Rabelais, Book 1, ch.40 quote: &quot;ilz mangent la merde du monde, c'est à dire, les pechez&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Thomas Pynchon]]'s award winning novel ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', contains a very detailed scene of coprophagia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Pynchon]] (1973) ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', Part 2, episode 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'', [[Procompsognathus]] (i.e. &quot;compys&quot;) consume the excrement of [[sauropod]]s and in doing so help keep the park clean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurassicpark.wikia.com/wiki/Procompsognathus#Jurassic_Park_.28novel.29 Procompsognathus at the Jurassic Park Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[The 120 Days of Sodom]], a novel by the [[Marquis de Sade]], is replete with detailed descriptions of erotic sadomasochistic coprophagia.&lt;ref&gt;le Marquis de Sade (1785) Les 120 journées de Sodome, ou L'École du Libertinage&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catherine Lucille Moore''' (January 24, 1911 – April 4, 1987) was an [[United States|American]] [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] [[writer]], as '''C. L. Moore'''. She was one of the first women to write in the genre, and paved the way for many other female writers in [[speculative fiction]].

== Biography ==
She was born on January 24, 1911 in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. She was chronically ill as a child and spent much of her time reading literature of the fantastic. She left college during [[The Great Depression]] to work as a secretary at the Fletcher Trust Company in Indianapolis. Her first stories appeared in [[pulp magazines]] in the 1930s, including two significant series in ''[[Weird Tales]]''. 

One series concerns the rogue and adventurer, [[Northwest Smith]], and his wanderings through the [[Solar System]]; the other is a short [[fantasy]] series about [[Jirel of Joiry]] (one of the first female protagonists in [[sword-and-sorcery]] fiction). 

The most famous of the Northwest Smith stories is &quot;[[Shambleau]]&quot;, which marked Moore’s first professional sale. It appeared in the magazine in November 1933, with the sale netting her a hundred dollars. 

The first and most famous of the [[Jirel of Joiry]] stories is &quot;[[Black God’s Kiss]]&quot;, which received the cover illustration (painted by [[Margaret Brundage]]) in the October 1934 ''Weird Tales''. Her early stories were notable for their emphasis on the senses and emotions, which was highly unusual at the time.

Moore's work also appeared in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' magazine throughout the 1940s. Several stories written for that magazine were later collected in her first published book, ''[[Judgment Night (collection)|Judgment Night]], published by [[Gnome Press]]'' in 1952. 

Included in that collection were “Judgment Night” (first published in August and September, 1943), the lush rendering of a future [[galactic empire]] with a sober meditation on the nature of power and its inevitable loss; “The Code” (July, 1945), an homage to the classic [[Faust]] with modern theories and [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraftian]] dread; “Promised Land” (February, 1950) and “Heir Apparent” (July, 1950) both documenting the grim twisting that mankind must undergo in order to spread into the solar system; and “Paradise Street” (September, 1950), a futuristic take on the [[American Old West|Old West]] conflict between lone hunter and wilderness-taming settlers.

Moore met [[Henry Kuttner]], also a science fiction writer, in 1936 when he wrote her a fan letter (mistakenly thinking that &quot;C. L. Moore&quot; was a man), and they married in 1940. 

Afterwards, almost all of their stories were written in collaboration under various pseudonyms, most commonly “[[Lewis Padgett]]”. (Another pseudonym, one Moore often employed for works that involved little or no collaboration, was &quot;Lawrence O’Donnell&quot;.) 

In this very prolific partnership they managed to combine Moore's style with Kuttner's more cerebral storytelling. Their stories include the classic &quot;[[Mimsy were the Borogoves]]&quot; (the basis for the film ''[[The Last Mimzy]]'') and &quot;[[Vintage Season]]&quot;. 

They also collaborated on a story that combined Moore’s signature characters, Northwest Smith and Jirel of Joiry: &quot;[[Quest of the Starstone]]&quot; (1937). 

After Kuttner's death in 1958, Moore wrote almost no fiction and taught his writing course at the [[University of Southern California]]. She did write for a few [[television]] shows under her married name, but upon marrying Thomas Reggie (who was not a writer) in 1963, she ceased writing entirely.

C. L. Moore was an active member of the Tom and Terri Pinckard Science Fiction literary salon, and was a frequent contributor to literary discussions with the regular membership including Larry Niven, Norman Spinrad. A.E. van Vogt, Jerry Pournelle, Robert Bloch, George Clayton Johnson, and others, as well as many visiting writers and speakers. Over time she developed Alzheimer's but this was not obvious for several years. She had ceased to attend the meetings when she was nominated to be the first woman Grand Master of the Science Fiction Writers of America, but the nomination was withdrawn at the request of her husband, Thomas Reggie, who said that due to the Alzheimer's progress the award and ceremony would be at best confusing and likely upsetting to her. This was a cause of considerable dismay to the SFWA former presidents with whom she was a great favorite for receiving the award.

C. L. Moore died on April 4, 1987 at her home in [[Hollywood, California]] after a long battle with [[Alzheimer's disease]].

The '''Compactron''' is a 12-pin [[vacuum tube]] family introduced in 1961 by [[General Electric]] in [[Owensboro, Kentucky]] &lt;ref&gt;Electronic Design&lt;/ref&gt; to compete with transistorized electronics during the [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] transition.&lt;ref&gt;junkbox&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Television]] sets were a primary application.  Compactrons are electronic vacuum tube units which contain arrangements of [[diode]]s, [[triode]]s, or [[pentode]]s in multiple combination arrays, as well as high or low-[[voltage]] and power types.  Use was prevalent in televisions because transistors were slow to achieve the high power and frequency capabilities needed particularly in color television sets. Furthermore, their integrated valve design helped lower power consumption and heat generation (they were to tubes what [[integrated circuits]] were to [[transistors]]).  Compactrons were also used in a few high end Hi-Fi stereos.&lt;ref&gt;junkbox&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinguishing feature of most Compactrons is the placement of the [[evacuation tip]] on the bottom end, rather than the top end as was customary with &quot;miniature&quot; tubes, and a characteristic 3/4&quot; diameter circle pin pattern.  Most Compactrons ranged in glass envelope diameter from 1 1/8&quot; to 2 3/4&quot; depending upon the internal configuration . Variations of the Compactron design were made by [[Sylvania]] and by some Japanese firms. Manufacture of Compactrons ceased in the early 1990s.

Examples:
*6AG11 high-mu twin triode
*6M11 twin triode - pentode
*12AE10 twin pentode
*8B10 twin triode - twin diode
*38HK7 pentode diode
*6K11 triple triode
*6LF6 beam power tetrode with anode cap

      <comment>/* Overview */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[number theory]], a '''Carmichael number''' is a [[composite number|composite]] positive [[integer]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies the [[Modular arithmetic|congruence]]
:&lt;math&gt;b^{n-1}\equiv 1\pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;
for all integers &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; which are [[relatively prime]] to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (see [[modular arithmetic]]). They are named for [[Robert Daniel Carmichael|Robert Carmichael]]. The Carmichael numbers are the [[Knödel number]]s ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Overview==
[[Fermat's little theorem]] states that all [[prime numbers]] have the above property. In this sense, Carmichael numbers are similar to prime numbers; in fact, they are called [[Fermat pseudoprime]]s. Carmichael numbers are sometimes also called '''absolute Fermat pseudoprimes'''.

Carmichael numbers are important because they pass the [[Fermat primality test]] but are not actually prime. Since Carmichael numbers exist, this primality test cannot be relied upon to prove the primality of a number, although it can still be used to prove a number is composite.

Still, as numbers become larger, Carmichael numbers become very rare. For example, there are 20,138,200 Carmichael numbers between 1 and 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; (approximately one in 50 billion numbers).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pinch2007&quot;&gt;Richard Pinch, [http://www.chalcedon.demon.co.uk/rgep/p82.pdf &quot;The Carmichael numbers up to 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;], May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes tests based on Fermat's Little Theorem slightly risky compared to others such as the [[Solovay-Strassen primality test]].

===Korselt's criterion===
An alternative and equivalent definition of Carmichael numbers is given by '''Korselt's criterion'''.

:'''Theorem''' ([[Alwin Korselt|Korselt]] 1899): A positive composite integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a Carmichael number if and only if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is [[square-free integer|square-free]], and for all [[prime divisor]]s &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, it is true that &lt;math&gt;p - 1 | n - 1&lt;/math&gt; (the notation &lt;math&gt;a | b&lt;/math&gt; indicates that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; [[divisor|divides]] &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;).

It follows from this theorem that all Carmichael numbers are [[odd number|odd]], since any even composite number that is square-free (and hence has only one prime factor of two) will have at least one odd prime factor, and thus &lt;math&gt;p - 1 | n - 1&lt;/math&gt; results in an even dividing an odd, a contradiction. (The oddness of Carmichael numbers also follows from the fact that &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Fermat primality test|Fermat witness]] for any even number.)
From the criterion it also follows that Carmichael numbers are [[Cyclic number (group theory)|cyclic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.numericana.com/data/crump.htm Carmichael Multiples of Odd Cyclic Numbers] &quot;Any divisor of a Carmichael number must be an odd cyclic number&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proof sketch: If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is square-free but not cyclic, &lt;math&gt;p_i | p_j - 1&lt;/math&gt; for two prime factors &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. But if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; satisfies Korselt then &lt;math&gt;p_j - 1 | n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, so by transitivity of the &quot;divides&quot; relation &lt;math&gt;p_i | n - 1&lt;/math&gt;. But &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is also a factor of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
Korselt was the first who observed the basic properties of Carmichael numbers, but he could not find any examples. In 1910, Carmichael found the first and smallest such number, 561, and hence the name &quot;Carmichael number&quot;.

That 561 is a Carmichael number can be seen with Korselt's criterion. Indeed, &lt;math&gt;561 = 3 \cdot 11 \cdot 17&lt;/math&gt; is square-free and &lt;math&gt;2 | 560&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;10 | 560&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;16 | 560&lt;/math&gt;.

J. Chernick proved a theorem in 1939 which can be used to construct a [[subset]] of Carmichael numbers. The number &lt;math&gt;(6k + 1)(12k + 1)(18k + 1)&lt;/math&gt; is a Carmichael number if its three factors are all prime. Whether this formula produces an infinite quantity of Carmichael numbers is an open question (though it is implied by [[Dickson's conjecture]]).

[[Paul Erdős]] heuristically argued there should be infinitely many Carmichael numbers. In 1994 it was shown by [[W. R. (Red) Alford]], [[Andrew Granville]] and [[Carl Pomerance]] that there really do exist infinitely many Carmichael numbers. Specifically, they showed that for sufficiently large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, there are at least &lt;math&gt;n^{2/7}&lt;/math&gt; Carmichael numbers between 1 and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alford1994&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=W. R. Alford, A. Granville, C. Pomerance |title=There are Infinitely Many Carmichael Numbers |journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |volume=139 |year=1994 |pages=703–722 |doi=10.2307/2118576 |url=http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/PDF/paper95.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Löh and Niebuhr in 1992 found some huge Carmichael numbers, including one with 1,101,518 factors and over 16 million digits.

=== Factorizations ===
Carmichael numbers have at least three positive prime factors. The first Carmichael numbers with &lt;math&gt;k = 3, 4, 5, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; prime factors are {{OEIS|id=A006931}}:

The second Carmichael number (1105) can be expressed as the sum of two squares in more ways than any smaller number. The third Carmichael number ([[1729 (number)|1729]]) is the Hardy-Ramanujan Number: the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.

In 1956, Erdős proved that&lt;ref name=&quot;Erdős1956&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Paul Erdős|Erdős, P.]] |year=1956 |title=On pseudoprimes and Carmichael numbers |journal=Publ. Math.

for some constant &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. He further gave a [[heuristic argument]] suggesting that this upper bound should be close to the true growth rate of &lt;math&gt;C(X)&lt;/math&gt;.

In the other direction, [[W. R. (Red) Alford|Alford]], [[Andrew Granville|Granville]] and [[Carl Pomerance|Pomerance]] proved in 1994&lt;ref name=&quot;Alford1994&quot;/&gt; that for sufficiently large ''X'',
:&lt;math&gt;C(X) &gt; X^{2/7}.&lt;/math&gt;
In 2005, this bound was further improved by [[Glyn Harman|Harman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Glyn Harman |title=On the number of Carmichael numbers up to ''x'' |journal=Bull. Lond. Math. Soc. |volume=37 |year=2005 |pages=641–650 |doi=10.1112/S0024609305004686}}&lt;/ref&gt; to
:&lt;math&gt;C(X) &gt; X^{0.332}&lt;/math&gt;
and then has subsequently improved the exponent to just over &lt;math&gt;1/3&lt;/math&gt;.

==Higher-order Carmichael numbers==
Carmichael numbers can be generalized using concepts of [[abstract algebra]].

The above definition states that a composite integer ''n'' is Carmichael
precisely when the ''n''th-power-raising function ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; from the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of integers modulo ''n'' to itself is the identity function. The identity is the only '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-[[algebra over a field|algebra]] [[endomorphism]] on '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; so we can restate the definition as asking that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be an algebra endomorphism of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
As above, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies the same property whenever ''n'' is prime.

The ''n''th-power-raising function ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is also defined on any '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebra '''A'''. A theorem states that ''n'' is prime if and only if all such functions ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are algebra endomorphisms.

In-between these two conditions lies the definition of '''Carmichael number of order m''' for any positive integer ''m'' as any composite number ''n'' such that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is an endomorphism on every '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebra that can be generated as '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-[[module (mathematics)|module]] by ''m'' elements. Carmichael numbers of order 1 are just the ordinary Carmichael numbers.

===Properties===
Korselt's criterion can be generalized to higher-order Carmichael numbers, as shown by Howe.&lt;ref&gt;Everett W. Howe. [http://arxiv.org/abs/math.NT/9812089 &quot;Higher-order Carmichael numbers.&quot;] ''Mathematics of Computation'' '''69''' (2000), pp. 1711–1719.&lt;/ref&gt;

A heuristic argument, given in the same paper, appears to suggest that there are infinitely many Carmichael numbers of order ''m'', for any ''m''. However, not a single Carmichael number of order 3 or above is known.

The '''Controlled Substances Act''' ('''CSA''') was enacted into law by the [[Congress of the United States]] as Title II of the [[Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970]].&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|91|513|84|1236|1970|10|27}}, codified at {{usc|21|801}} et. seq.&lt;/ref&gt; The CSA is the [[federal government of the United States|federal]] [[drug policy of the United States|U.S. drug policy]] under which the manufacture, importation, possession, use and distribution of certain substances is regulated. The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]].

The legislation created five Schedules (classifications), with varying qualifications for a substance to be included in each. Two federal agencies, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] and the [[Food and Drug Administration]], determine which substances are added to or removed from the various schedules, though the statute passed by Congress created the initial listing, and Congress has sometimes scheduled other substances through legislation such as the [[Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Prevention Act of 2000]], which placed [[gamma hydroxybutyrate]] in Schedule I. Classification decisions are required to be made on criteria including potential for abuse (an undefined term),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regulations.gov/search/Regs/home.html#docketDetail?R=DEA-2009-0013] Docket ID: DEA-2009-0013 in [http://www.regulations.gov/search/Regs/home.html#documentDetail?R=0900006480a4ff5b] DEA-2009-0013-0003 HHS recommendation document. Enclosure: BASIS FOR THE RECOMMENDATION TO CONTROL 5-METHOXY-DIMETHYLTRYPTAMINE (5-MeO-DMT) IN SCHEDULE I OF THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT, (B.) (1.) The term &quot;abuse&quot; is not defined in the CSA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[D]rug abuse may refer to any type of drug or chemical without regard to its pharmacologic actions. It is an eclectic concept having only one uniform connotation: societal disapproval. ... The Commission believes that the term drug abuse must be deleted from official pronouncements and public policy dialogue. The term has no functional utility and has become no more than an arbitrary codeword for that drug use which is presently considered wrong.&quot;  -- Second Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse; Drug Use In America: Problem In Perspective (March 1973), p.13&lt;/ref&gt; currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and international treaties.

==History==
{{Regulation of therapeutic goods in the United States}}In 1969, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] announced that the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], [[John N. Mitchell]], was preparing a comprehensive new measure to more effectively meet the narcotic and dangerous drug problems at the federal level by combining all existing federal laws into a single new statute. The CSA did not merely combine existing federal drug laws but changed the nature of federal drug law and policy, expanded the scope of federal drug laws and expanded federal [[police power]] enormously.

Part F of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 established the [[National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse]]—known as the Shafer Commission after its chairman, [[Raymond P. Shafer]]—to study [[marijuana]] abuse in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Part F is printed on the inside cover of Drug Use In America: Problem In Perspective, Second Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, March 1973&lt;/ref&gt; During his presentation of the commission's First Report to Congress, Shafer recommended the [[decriminalization]] of marijuana in small amounts, saying, ''&quot;[T]he criminal law is too harsh a tool to apply to personal possession even in the effort to discourage use. It implies an overwhelming indictment of the behavior which we believe is not appropriate. The actual and potential harm of use of the drug is not great enough to justify intrusion by the criminal law into private behavior, a step which our society takes only 'with the greatest reluctance.&quot;''

Rufus King notes that this stratagem was similar to that used by [[Harry Anslinger]] when he consolidated the previous anti-drug treaties into the Single Convention and took the opportunity to add new provisions that otherwise might have been unpalatable to the international community.&lt;ref name=&quot;dontsit&quot;&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.net/special/king/dhu/dhu28.htm The 1970 Act: Don't Sit There, Amend Something&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to David T. Courtwright, &quot;the Act was part of an omnibus reform package designed to rationalize, and in some respects to liberalize, American drug policy.&quot; (Courtwright noted that the Act became, not libertarian, but instead repressionistic to the point of tyrannical, in its intent.) It eliminated mandatory minimum sentences and provided support for drug treatment and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T63-4CRYBHX-2&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=7a71960ef1dcc659709c274541eccd47|title=The Controlled Substances Act: how a &quot;big tent&quot; reform became a punitive drug law|accessdate=2008-02-12|last=Courtwright|first=David T.|date=2004-10-05|doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2004.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
King notes that the rehabilitation clauses were added as a compromise to Senator Hughes, who favored a moderate approach. The bill, as introduced by Senator Dirksen, ran to 91 pages. While it was being drafted, the [[Uniform Controlled Substances Act]], to be passed by state legislatures, was also being drafted by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]; its wording closely mirrored the Controlled Substances Act.&lt;ref name=&quot;dontsit&quot;/&gt;

Since its enactment in 1970, the Act has been amended several times:
*The [[Psychotropic Substances Act (United States)|Psychotropic Substances Act]] of 1978 added provisions implementing the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].
* The [[Controlled Substances Penalties Amendments Act of 1984]].
*The [[Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act]] of 1988 added provisions implementing the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]].
*The Domestic Chemical Diversion and Control Act of 1993.
*The [[Federal Analog Act]].

==Enforcement authority==
Proceedings to add, delete, or change the schedule of a drug or other substance may be initiated by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), or by petition from any interested party, including the manufacturer of a drug, a medical society or association, a pharmacy association, a public interest group concerned with drug abuse, a state or local government agency, or an individual citizen. When a ''petition'' is received by the DEA, the agency begins its own investigation of the drug.

The DEA also may begin an investigation of a drug at any time based upon information received from laboratories, state and local law enforcement and regulatory agencies, or other sources of information.

Once the DEA has collected the necessary data, the Deputy Administrator of DEA,&lt;ref&gt;Federal Register: August 21, 2009 (Volume 74, Number 161), Page 42220  &quot;Under the authority vested in the [[Attorney General]] by section 201(a) of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 811(a)), and delegated to the Administrator of DEA by Department of Justice regulations (28 CFR 0.100), and redelegated to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 28 CFR 0.104...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; requests from HHS a scientific and medical evaluation and recommendation as to whether the drug or other substance should be controlled or removed from control. This request is sent to the Assistant Secretary of Health of HHS. Then, HHS solicits information from the Commissioner of the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and evaluations and recommendations from the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] and, on occasion, from the scientific and medical community at large. The Assistant Secretary, by authority of the Secretary, compiles the information and transmits back to the DEA a medical and scientific evaluation regarding the drug or other substance, a recommendation as to whether the drug should be controlled, and in what schedule it should be placed.

The medical and scientific evaluations are binding to the DEA with respect to scientific and medical matters. The recommendation on scheduling is binding only to the extent that if HHS recommends that the substance not be controlled, the DEA may not control the substance.

Once the DEA has received the scientific and medical evaluation from HHS, the DEA Administrator will evaluate all available data and make a final decision whether to propose that a drug or other substance be controlled and into which schedule it should be placed.

Under certain circumstances, the Government may temporarily schedule a drug without following the normal procedure. An example is when international treaties require control of a substance. In addition, {{uscsub|21|811|h}} allows the Attorney General to temporarily place a substance in Schedule I &quot;to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety&quot;. Thirty days' notice is required before the order can be issued, and the scheduling expires after a year; however, the period may be extended six months if rulemaking proceedings to permanently schedule the drug are in progress. In any case, once these proceedings are complete, the temporary order is automatically vacated. Unlike ordinary scheduling proceedings, such temporary orders are not subject to [[judicial review]].

The CSA also creates a closed system of distribution for those authorized to handle controlled substances. The cornerstone of this system is the registration of all those authorized by the DEA to handle controlled substances. All individuals and firms that are registered are required to maintain complete and accurate inventories and records of all transactions involving controlled substances, as well as security for the storage of controlled substances.

==Treaty obligations==
The Congressional findings in [[21 U.S.C.]] §§ {{USCSub2|21|801|7}}, {{USCSub2|21|801a|2}}, and {{USCSub2|21|801a|3}} state that a major purpose of the CSA is to &quot;enable the United States to meet all of its obligations&quot; under international [[treaty|treaties]] - specifically, the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and the 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/agency/csa.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The CSA bears many resemblances to these Conventions. Both the CSA and the treaties set out a system for classifying controlled substances in several Schedules in accordance with the binding scientific and medical findings of a public health authority. Under {{usc|21|811}} of the CSA, that authority is the [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] (HHS). Under [http://www.incb.org/e/conv/1961/articles.htm#3 Article 3] of the Single Convention and [http://www.incb.org/e/conv/1971/articles.htm#2 Article 2] of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, the [[World Health Organization]] is that authority.

The domestic and international legal nature of  these treaty obligations must be considered in light of the supremacy of the [[United States Constitution]] over treaties or acts and the equality of treaties and Congressional acts. In [[Reid v. Covert]] the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] addressed both these issues directly and clearly holding:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[N]o agreement with a foreign nation can confer power on the Congress, or on any other branch of Government, which is free from the restraints of the Constitution.

Article VI, the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, declares:

&quot;This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof, and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; . . .&quot;

There is nothing in this language which intimates that treaties and laws enacted pursuant to them do not have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution. Nor is there anything in the debates which accompanied the drafting and ratification of the Constitution which even suggests such a result. These debates, as well as the history that surrounds the adoption of the treaty provision in Article VI, make it clear that the reason treaties were not limited to those made in &quot;pursuance&quot; of the Constitution was so that agreements made by the United States under the Articles of Confederation, including the important peace treaties which concluded the Revolutionary War, would remain in effect. [http://supreme.justia.com/us/354/1/case.html#F31 Footnote 31] It would be manifestly contrary to the objectives of those who created the Constitution, as well as those who were responsible for the Bill of Rights -- let alone alien to our entire constitutional history and tradition -- to construe Article VI as permitting the United States to exercise power under an international agreement without observing constitutional prohibitions.[http://supreme.justia.com/us/354/1/case.html#F32 Footnote 32] In effect, such construction would permit amendment of that document in a manner not sanctioned by Article V. The prohibitions of the Constitution were designed to apply to all branches of the National Government, and they cannot be nullified by the Executive or by the Executive and the Senate combined.

There is nothing new or unique about what we say here. This Court has regularly and uniformly recognized the supremacy of the Constitution over a treaty. [http://supreme.justia.com/us/354/1/case.html#F33 Footnote 33] For example, in Geofroy v. Riggs, 133 U. S. 258, 133 U. S. 267, it declared:

&quot;The treaty power, as expressed in the Constitution, is in terms unlimited except by those restraints which are found in that instrument against the action of the government or of its departments, and those arising from the nature of the government itself and of that of the States. It would not be contended that it extends so far as to authorize what the Constitution forbids, or a change in the character of the government, or in that of one of the States, or a cession of any portion of the territory of the latter, without its consent.&quot;

This Court has also repeatedly taken the position that an Act of Congress, which must comply with the Constitution, is on a full parity with a treaty, and that, when a statute which is subsequent in time is inconsistent with a treaty, the statute to the extent of conflict renders the treaty null. [http://supreme.justia.com/us/354/1/case.html#F34 Footnote 34] It would be completely anomalous to say that a treaty need not comply with the Constitution when such an agreement can be overridden by a statute that must conform to that instrument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/354/1/case.html Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1 at pp 17-19]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the Cato Institute, these treaties only bind (legally obligate)  the United States to comply with them as long as that nation agrees to remain a state party to these treaties. The [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] and the [[President of the United States]] have the absolute [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] right to withdraw from or abrogate at any time these two instruments, in accordance with said nation's [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], at which point these treaties will cease to bind that nation in any way, shape, or form.&lt;ref name=&quot;cato.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/handbook/hb108/hb108-17.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A provision for automatic compliance with treaty obligations is found at {{uscsub|21|811|d|}}, which also establishes mechanisms for amending international drug control regulations to correspond with HHS findings on scientific and medical issues. If control of a substance is mandated by the Single Convention, the Attorney General is required to &quot;issue an order controlling such drug under the schedule he deems most appropriate to carry out such obligations,&quot; without regard to the normal scheduling procedure or the findings of the HHS Secretary. However, the Secretary has great influence over any drug scheduling proposal under the Single Convention, because {{uscsub|21|811|d|2|B}} requires the Secretary the power to &quot;evaluate the proposal and furnish a recommendation to the Secretary of State which shall be binding on the representative of the United States in discussions and negotiations relating to the proposal.&quot;

Similarly, if the United Nations [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] adds or transfers a substance to a Schedule established by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, so that current U.S. regulations on the drug do not meet the treaty's requirements, the Secretary is required to issue a recommendation on how the substance should be scheduled under the CSA. If the Secretary agrees with the Commission's scheduling decision, he can recommend that the Attorney General initiate proceedings to reschedule the drug accordingly. If the HHS Secretary disagrees with the UN controls, however, the Attorney General must temporarily place the drug in Schedule IV or V (whichever meets the minimum requirements of the treaty) and exclude the substance from any regulations not mandated by the treaty, while the Secretary is required to request that the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] take action, through the Commission or the [[UN Economic and Social Council]], to remove the drug from international control or transfer it to a different Schedule under the Convention. The temporary scheduling expires as soon as control is no longer needed to meet international treaty obligations.

This provision was invoked in 1984 to place Rohypnol ([[flunitrazepam]]) in Schedule IV. The drug did not then meet the Controlled Substances Act's criteria for scheduling; however, control was required by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In 1999, an FDA official explained to Congress:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990311b.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Rohypnol is not approved or available for medical use in the United States, but it is temporarily controlled in Schedule IV pursuant to a treaty obligation under the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. At the time flunitrazepam was placed temporarily in Schedule IV (November 5, 1984), there was no evidence of abuse or trafficking of the drug in the United States.''

The [[Cato Institute]]'s ''Handbook for Congress'' calls for repealing the CSA, an action that would likely bring the United States into conflict with [[international law]], were the United States not to exercise its sovereign right to withdraw from and/or abrogate the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and/or the 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] prior to repealing the Controlled Substances Act.&lt;ref name=&quot;cato.org&quot;/&gt; The exception would be if the U.S. were to claim that the treaty obligations violate the [[United States Constitution]]. Many articles in these treaties—such as [http://www.incb.org/e/conv/1961/articles_II.htm?#35 Article 35] and [http://www.incb.org/e/conv/1961/articles_II.htm?#36 Article 36] of the Single Convention—are prefaced with phrases such as &quot;Having due regard to their constitutional, legal and administrative systems, the Parties shall . . .&quot; or &quot;Subject to its constitutional limitations, each Party shall . . .&quot; According to former [[United Nations Drug Control Programme]] Chief of Demand Reduction [[Cindy Fazey]], &quot;This has been used by the USA not to implement part of article 3 of the 1988 Convention, which prevents inciting others to use narcotic or psychotropic drugs, on the basis that this would be in contravention of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|their constitutional amendment guaranteeing freedom of speech]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuoriluogo.it/arretrati/2003/apr_17_en.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schedules of controlled substances==
Placing a drug or other substance in a certain Schedule or removing it from a certain Schedule is primarily based on [[21 U.S.C.]] §§ {{uscsub2|21|801}}, {{uscsub2|21|801a}}, {{uscsub2|21|802}}, {{uscsub2|21|811}}, {{uscsub2|21|812}}, {{uscsub2|21|813}} and {{uscsub2|21|814}}. Every schedule otherwise requires a finding specifying the &quot;potential for abuse&quot; before a substance can be placed in that schedule.&lt;ref&gt;http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode21/usc_sup_01_21_10_13.html&lt;/ref&gt; The specific classification of any given drug or other substance is usually a source of controversy, as is the purpose and effectiveness of the entire regulatory scheme.

&quot;The term 'controlled substance' means a drug or other substance, or immediate precursor, included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V of part B of this subchapter. The term does not include distilled spirits, wine, malt beverages, or tobacco, as those terms are defined or used in subtitle E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.&quot; {{uscsub|21|802|6}} &lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode21/usc_sec_21_00000802----000-.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that this is an important exemption, since alcohol and tobacco are the two most widely used drugs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugabusestatistics.samhsa.gov/Dependence/appendixc.htm Appendix C: Measurement of Dependence, Abuse, Treatment, and Treatment Need - 2000 NHSDA - Substance Dependence, Abuse, and Treatment]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugabuse.gov/Infofacts/Tobacco.html InfoFacts - Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products]&lt;/ref&gt; More significantly the exclusion of alcohol includes wine which is sacramentally used by many  major religious denominations in the United States.

==Alternatives to scheduling==
Recently, in a report published in ''[[The Lancet]] Journal,'' researchers have introduced an alternative method for drug classification in the UK. This new system uses a “nine category matrix of harm, with an expert Delphic procedure, to assess the harms of a range of illicit drugs in an evidence-based fashion.” The new classification system suggested that [[alcohol]] and [[tobacco]] were in the mid-range of harm, while [[cannabis]], [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (&quot;LSD&quot;) and [[MDMA]] (&quot;Ecstacy&quot;) were all less harmful than the two legal drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

===Inconsistencies===
The placement of some drugs or other substances is paradoxical: both [[morphine]] and [[fentanyl]] are in Schedule II, and [[heroin]] is in Schedule I. Fentanyl is approximately 80 times as potent as morphine, and heroin is around three times as potent as morphine. Morphine has been used by physicians for over 150 years. It is very addictive, however it is a very effective analgesic for providing relief from severe pain, so it is licensed for careful medical use. Heroin was introduced in the late 19th century and licensed the same way until it was banned in 1924.&lt;ref name=heroineban&gt;[http://www.suboxone.com/patients/opioiddependence/history.aspx History of Opioids]&lt;/ref&gt; Fentanyl has been used for less than 50 years and has always been carefully restricted.

==Schedule I controlled substances {{anchor|Schedule I drugs}}==
{{Main|List of Schedule I drugs (US)}}

&quot;Placement on schedules; findings required

Except ...  The findings required for each of the schedules are as follows:

(1) Schedule I.—

(A) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.

(B) The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.

(C) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;cornell1&quot;&gt;http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode21/usc_sec_21_00000812----000-.html&lt;/ref&gt;

No prescriptions may be written for Schedule I substances, and such substances are subject to [[production quota]]s by the DEA.

Under the DEA's interpretation of the CSA, a drug does not necessarily have to have the same abuse potential as heroin or cocaine to merit placement in Schedule I (in fact, cocaine is currently a Schedule II drug due to limited medical use):
:''When it comes to a drug that is currently listed in schedule I, if it is undisputed that such drug has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and it is further undisputed that the drug has at least some potential for abuse sufficient to warrant control under the CSA, the drug must remain in schedule I. In such circumstances, placement of the drug in schedules II through V would conflict with the CSA since such drug would not meet the criterion of &quot;a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.&quot; 21 USC 812(b).''&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_register&amp;docid=01-9306-filed Government Printing Office]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentences for first-time, non-violent offenders convicted of trafficking in Schedule I drugs can easily turn into ''de facto'' life sentences when multiple sales are prosecuted in one proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;See ''United States v. Angelos'', 433 F.3d 738 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|10th Cir.]] 2006) (55 years for three sales of marijuana).&lt;/ref&gt; Sentences for violent offenders are much higher.

Drugs in this schedule include:
* [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid]] (GHB), which has been used as a general anaesthetic with minimal side-effects{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} and controlled action but a limited safe dosage range. It was placed in Schedule I in March 2000 after widespread recreational use. Uniquely, this drug is also listed in Schedule III for limited uses, under the trademark '''Xyrem''';
* 12-Methoxyibogamine ([[Ibogaine]]), which is being used successfully in curing opiate addiction (as well as alcoholism) treatment and psychotherapy in clinics in Mexico and Canada{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.
* [[Marijuana]]. Marijuana is a Schedule I drug, although controversy exists about its placement in Schedule I. There have been no reported cases of THC overdose. ''Main article: [[Removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act]]''.
* [[Heroin]] (Diacetylmorphine, morphine diacetate), which is used in some European countries as a potent pain reliever in terminal cancer patients, and as second option, after morphine. (It is about twice as potent, by weight, as morphine.)
* Other strong opiates and opioids used in many other countries, or even in the USA in previous decades for palliation of moderate to severe pain such as [[nicomorphine]] (Vilan), [[dextromoramide]] (Palfium), [[ketobemidone]] (Ketalgin), [[dihydromorphine]] (Paramorfan), [[piritramide]] (Dipidolor), [[diacetyldihydromorphine]] (Paralaudin), [[dipipanone]] (Wellconal), [[phenadoxone]] (Heptalgin) and many others.
* Weak opioids used for relief of moderate pain, diarrhea, and coughing such as [[benzylmorphine]] (Peronine), [[nicocodeine]] (Tusscodin), [[Dihydrocodeinone enol acetate]], [[tilidine]] (Valoron), [[meptazinol]] (Meptid), [[propiram]] (Algeril), [[acetyldihydrocodeine]] and others.
* [[Pholcodine]], a weak opioid cough suppressant with negligible abuse potential{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} which is available over-the-counter in many other countries.
* [[methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA]] (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Ecstasy), which continues to be used medically, notably in the treatment of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). The medical community originally agreed upon placing it as a Schedule III substance, but the government denied this suggestion, despite two court rulings by the DEA's administrative law judge that placing MDMA in Schedule I was illegal. It was temporarily unscheduled after the first administrative hearing from December 22, 1987 - July 1, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.org/dea-mdma/ MAPS Legal History of MDMA]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Psilocybin]], the active ingredient in [[psychedelic mushrooms]];
* [[5-MeO-DIPT]] (Foxy / Foxy Methoxy / 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine)
* [[Lysergic acid diethylamide]] (&quot;LSD&quot; / &quot;Acid&quot;), formerly used in psychotherapy
* [[Peyote]], a cactus growing in nature primarily in northeastern Mexico; one of the few plants specifically scheduled, with a narrow exception to its legal status for religious use by members of the [[Native American Church]];
* [[Mescaline]], the main psychoactive ingredients of the peyote, san pedro, achuma, and Peruvian torch cacti;
* [[Methaqualone]] (Quaalude, Sopor, Mandrax), a sedative that was previously used for similar purposes as barbiturates, until it was rescheduled;
* [[2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine]] (STP / DOM), a psychotropic hallucinogen that rose to prominence in 1967 in San Francisco when it appeared in pill form (known as &quot;STP&quot;, in doses as high as four times the amounts previously considered &quot;safe&quot;) on the black market;
* [[2C-T-7]] (Blue Mystic / T7), a psychotropic [[entheogen]];
* [[2C-B]] (Nexus / Bees / Venus / Bromo Mescaline), a psychotropic hallucinogen and aphrodisiac;
* [[Cathinone]] (β-[[ketone|keto]][[amphetamine]]), a [[monoamine]] [[alkaloid]] found in the [[shrub]] ''[[Catha edulis]]'' ([[Khat]]);
* [[Alphamethyltryptamine|AMT]] (alpha-methyltryptamine), an anti-depressant from the [[tryptamine]] family; first developed in the [[Soviet Union]] and marketed under the brand name Indopan;
* [[Bufotenin]] (5-OH-DMT), a naturally-occurring [[tryptamine]] with hallucinogenic and aphrodisiac properties; named for the ''[[Bufo]]'' genus of toads whose poison contains the chemical;&lt;ref name=&quot;dea_pubs&quot;&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/scheduling.html Drug Scheduling.] ''[[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA.]]'' Accessed on May 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Benzylpiperazine]] (BZP), a synthetic drug with a slight resemblance to MDMA and stimulant effects 10 times less potent than amphetamine (though it was mistakenly said to be 10 times more addictive than amphetamine at the drug's schedule hearing).
* Controlled Substance Analogs intended for human consumption (as defined by the [[Federal Analog Act]])

==Schedule II controlled substances {{anchor|Schedule II drugs}}==
{{Main|List of Schedule II drugs (US)}}

&quot;Placement on schedules; findings required

Except.... The findings required for each of the schedules are as follows:

Schedule II.—

(A) The drug or other substances have a high potential for abuse

(B) The drug or other substances have currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, or currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions

(C) Abuse of the drug or other substances may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;cornell1&quot;/&gt;

Except when dispensed directly by a practitioner, other than a pharmacist, to an ultimate user, no controlled substance in schedule II, which is a prescription drug as determined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], may be dispensed without the written prescription of a practitioner, except that in emergency situations, as prescribed by the Secretary by regulation after consultation with the Attorney General, such drug may be dispensed upon oral prescription in accordance with section 503(b) of that Act [21 U.S.C. 353 (b)]. Prescriptions shall be retained in conformity with the requirements of section 827 of this title. No prescription for a controlled substance in schedule II may be refilled.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell2&quot;&gt;http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode21/usc_sec_21_00000829----000-.html&lt;/ref&gt; Notably no emergency situation provisions exist outside the Controlled Substances Act's &quot;closed system&quot; although this closed system may be unavailable or nonfunctioning in the event of accidents in remote areas or disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes. Acts which would widely be considered morally imperative{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} remain offenses subject to heavy penalties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode21/usc_sup_01_21_10_13_20_I_30_D.html&lt;/ref&gt;

These drugs vary in potency: for example [[Fentanyl]] is about 80 times as potent as [[morphine]]. ([[Heroin]] is roughly four times as potent.) More significantly, they vary in nature. Pharmacology and CSA scheduling have a weak relationship.

Drugs in this schedule include:
* [[Cocaine]] (used as a [[topical anesthetic]]);
* [[Methylphenidate]] ([[Ritalin]] and [[Concerta]]) &amp; [[Dexmethylphenidate]] ([[Focalin]])  (used in treatment of [[Attention Deficit Disorder]]);
* [[Opium]] and [[opium tincture]] ([[laudanum]]), which is used as a potent [[antidiarrheal]];
* [[Methadone]] (used in treatment of [[heroin]] addiction as well as for treatment of extreme chronic pain)
* [[Oxycodone]] (semi-synthetic opioid; active ingredient in [[Percocet]], [[OxyContin]], and [[Percodan]])
* [[Fentanyl]] and most other strong pure opioid agonists, ''i.e.'' [[levorphanol]], [[opium]], or [[oxymorphone]];
* [[Morphine]]
* [[Mixed Amphetamine Salts]] under brand name [[Adderall]]
* [[Lisdexamfetamine]] under brand name [[Vyvanse]]
* [[Dextroamphetamine]] (Dexedrine) [[Desoxyn|Dextromethamphetamine]] (Desoxyn)
* [[Hydromorphone]] (Dilaudid)
* Pure [[codeine]] and any drug for non-parenteral administration containing the equivalent of more than 90&amp;nbsp;mg of codeine per dosage unit.;
* Pure [[hydrocodone]] and any drug for non-parenteral administration containing no other active ingredients or more than 15&amp;nbsp;mg per dosage unit.;
* [[Secobarbital]] (Seconal)
* [[Pethidine]] ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]: Meperidine; Demerol)
* [[Phencyclidine]] (PCP);
* Short-acting [[barbiturates]], such as [[pentobarbital]], Nembutal (now out of production);
* [[Amphetamine]]s were originally placed on Schedule III, but were moved to Schedule II in 1971. Injectable [[methamphetamine]] has always been on Schedule II;
* [[Nabilone]] (Cesamet) A synthetic [[cannabinoid]]. An analogue to [[dronabinol]] (Marinol) which is a Schedule III drug.
* [[Tapentadol]] (Nucynta) A new drug with mixed opioid agonist and norepinepherine re-uptake inhibitor activity.

==Schedule III controlled substances {{anchor|Schedule III drugs}}==
{{Main|List of Schedule III drugs (US)}}

&quot;Placement on schedules; findings required

Except... . The findings required for each of the schedules are as follows:

Schedule III.—

(A) The drug or other substance has a potential for abuse less than the drugs or other substances in schedules I and II.

(B) The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.

(C) Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;cornell1&quot;/&gt;

Except when dispensed directly by a practitioner, other than a pharmacist, to an ultimate user, no controlled substance in schedule III or IV, which is a prescription drug as determined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], may be dispensed without a written or oral prescription in conformity with section 503(b) of that Act [21 U.S.C. 353 (b)]. Such prescriptions may not be filled or refilled more than six months after the date thereof or be refilled more than five times after the date of the prescription unless renewed by the practitioner.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell2&quot;/&gt; Control of wholesale distribution is somewhat less stringent than Schedule II drugs. Provisions for emergency situations are less restrictive within the &quot;closed system&quot; of the Controlled Substances Act than for Schedule II though no schedule has provisions to address circumstances where the closed system is unavailable, nonfunctioning or otherwise inadequate.

Drugs in this schedule include:
* [[Anabolic steroid]]s (including [[prohormone]]s such as androstenedione);
* Intermediate-acting [[barbiturate]]s, such as [[talbutal]] or [[butalbital]];
* [[Buprenorphine]];
* [[Dihydrocodeine]] single-ingredient drugs and the pure drug itself.
* [[Ketamine]], a drug originally developed as a milder substitute for [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] (mainly to use as a human anesthetic) but has since become popular as a veterinary and pediatric anesthetic;
* [[Xyrem]], a preparation of [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]] used to treat [[narcolepsy]]. Xyrem is in Schedule III but with a restricted distribution system. All other forms of GHB are in Schedule I;
* [[Hydrocodone]] / [[codeine]], when compounded with an [[NSAID]] (e.g. Vicoprofen, when compounded with [[ibuprofen]]) or with acetaminophen ([[paracetamol]]) (e.g. [[Hydrocodone|Vicodin]] / [[Co-codamol|Tylenol 3]]);
* [[Marinol]], a synthetic form of [[Tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC) used to treat [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] caused by [[chemotherapy]], as well as [[Appetite|appetite loss]] caused by [[AIDS]];
* [[Paregoric]], an [[antidiarrheal]] and [[anti-tussive]], which contains [[opium]] combined with [[camphor]] (which makes it less addiction-prone than [[laudanum]], which is in Schedule II;
* [[Lysergic acid amide]] (&quot;LSA&quot;), listed as a sedative but considered by some to be hallucinogenic.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, J.H., 2004. &quot;Hallucinogens and dissociative agents naturally growing in the United States,&quot; ''Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics'' 102:131-138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schultes, R.E. and Hofmann, A., 1980.

==Schedule IV controlled substances {{anchor|Schedule IV drugs}}==
{{Main|List of Schedule IV drugs (US)}}

&quot;Placement on schedules; findings required

Except.... The findings required for each of the schedules are as follows:

Schedule IV.—

(A) The drug or other substance has a low potential for abuse relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule III.

(B) The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.

(C) Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule III.&quot;
[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode21/usc_sec_21_00000812----000-.html]

Control measures are similar to Schedule III. Prescriptions for Schedule IV drugs may be refilled up to five times within a six month period.

Drugs in this schedule include:

* [[Benzodiazepine]]s, such as [[alprazolam]] ([[Xanax]]), [[chlordiazepoxide]] ([[Librium]]), [[clonazepam]] ([[Klonopin]]), [[diazepam]] ([[Valium]])
**[[temazepam]] (Restoril) (Note that some states require specially coded prescriptions for [[temazepam]])
**[[flunitrazepam]] (Rohypnol) (Note that flunitrazepam is not used medically in the United States);

==Federal regulation of pseudoephedrine==

Due to [[pseudoephedrine]] being widely used in the manufacture of [[methamphetamine]] (see also: [[pseudoephedrine]], &quot;Misuse and illicit use&quot;), the U.S. Congress passed the [[Methamphetamine Precursor Control Act]] which places restrictions on the sale of any medicine containing pseudoephedrine. That bill was then superseded by the [[Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005]], which was passed as an amendment to the [[Patriot Act]] renewal and included wider and more comprehensive restrictions on the sale of pseudoephedrine containing products. This law requires&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doh.state.fl.us/mqa/pharmacy/info_federallaw.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; customer signature of a &quot;log-book&quot; and presentation of valid photo ID to purchase of pseudoephedrine (PSE) containing products from all retailers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/meth/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The law restricts an individual to the retail sale of such products to no more than three packages or no more than 3.6&amp;nbsp;grams in a single transaction. Additionally, there is a limit of no more than 9&amp;nbsp;grams in one month.  A violation of this statute constitutes a misdemeanor. In states where OTC medications which contain pseudoephedrine are not regulated, many retailers, notably [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Wal-Mart]] have restricted their purchase by requiring it to be sold behind the pharmacy or service counter and/or placing an age restriction on purchase. Additionally, pharmacies such as [[CVS Corporation|CVS]] and [[Walgreens]] also require photo ID and log-book signatures for sales of PSE containing products in compliance with Federal law.

Prior to this, the state of [[Oregon]] passed a law requiring a prescription for pharmacies to dispense any cold remedy containing pseudoephedrine. Likewise, the states of [[Alabama]], [[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[New Mexico]], [[New Jersey]], [[North Carolina]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Tennessee]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Wisconsin]] and [[Wyoming]] restrict sales of pseudoephedrine-containing products to licensed pharmacies and require customers to show photo ID and sign a log book.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} [[California]], [[Maryland]], and [[Maine]] have also enacted degrees of controlled access to over the counter drugs that contain pseudoephedrine. This affects many preparations which were previously available over-the-counter without restriction, such as ''[[Actifed]]'', their generic equivalents, etc. [[California Health and Safety Code]] sections 11100 and 11106 specify the new restrictions regarding [[Over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] (OTC) sale of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine containing products (PSE)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Claude_Piron.jpg|200px|thumb|Piron, Boulogne Congress, 2005]]
'''Claude Piron''' (26 February 1931 &amp;ndash; 22 January 2008) was a [[psychology|psychologist]] and linguist.  He was a translator for the [[United Nations]] (from [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] into [[French language|French]]) from 1956 to 1961.

After leaving the UN, he worked the world over for the [[World Health Organization]].

He was a prolific author of [[Esperanto]] works. He spoke Esperanto from childhood and used it in [[Japan]], the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], in [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]], and in nearly all the countries of [[Europe]].

In some of his books, he used the pseudonym '''Johán Valano'''.

== Life ==
Piron was a psychotherapist and taught from 1973 to 1994 in the psychology department at the [[University of Geneva]] in [[Switzerland]].  His French-language book ''Le défi des langues — Du gâchis au bon sens'' (The Language Challenge: From Chaos to Common Sense, 1994) is a kind of [[psychoanalysis]] of international communication. A [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] version, ''O desafio das linguas'', was published in 2002 (Campinas, São Paulo, Pontes).

In a  lecture on the current system of international communication &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claude-piron.ch/hidden-perverse-effects.html www.claude-piron.ch/hidden-perverse-effects.html]{{Dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piron argued that &quot;Esperanto relies entirely on innate reflexes&quot; and &quot;differs from all other languages in that you can always trust your natural tendency to generalize patterns... The same neuropsychological law...—called by [[Jean Piaget]] ''generalizing assimilation''—applies to word formation as well as to grammar.&quot;

His diverse Esperanto writings include instructional books, books for beginners, novels, short stories, poems, articles and non-fiction books.  His most famous works are ''[[Gerda malaperis!]]'' and ''[[La Bona Lingvo]]'' (The Good Language).

''Gerda malaperis!'' is a novella which uses basic grammar and vocabulary in the first chapter and builds up to expert Esperanto by the end, including word lists so that beginners may easily follow along.

In ''La Bona Lingvo'', Piron captures the basic linguistic and social aspects of Esperanto.  He argues strongly for imaginative use of the basic Esperanto [[morpheme]] inventory and word-formation techniques, and against unnecessary importation of neologisms from European languages.  He also presents the idea that, once one has learned enough vocabulary to express himself, it is easier to think clearly in Esperanto than in many other languages.

Piron is the author of a book in French, ''Le bonheur clés en main'' (The Keys to Happiness), which distinguishes among pleasure, happiness and joy. He shows how one may avoid contributing to his own &quot;anti-happiness&quot; (''l'anti-bonheur'') and how one may expand the areas of happiness in his life. Piron's view is that, while one may desire happiness, desire is not enough. Just as people must do certain things in order to become physically stronger, they must do certain things in order to become happier. Those are the things that he describes in this book.

'''Captain America''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[superhero]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941), from Marvel Comics' 1940s predecessor, [[Timely Comics]],&lt;ref name=&quot;milestone&quot;&gt;The 1995 ''Marvel Milestone Edition: Captain America'' archival reprint has no cover date or number, and its postal indicia says &quot;Originally published... as Captain America #000.&quot; Timely's first comic, ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]]'' #1, likewise had no number on its cover, and was released with two different cover dates.&lt;/ref&gt; and was created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. Over the years, an estimated 210 million copies of &quot;Captain America&quot; comic books have been sold in a total of 75 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17499797/ | title=Death to 'America': Comic-book hero killed off | work=[[MSNBC.com]] | date=March 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For nearly all of the character's publication history, Captain America was the [[alter ego]] of '''Steve Rogers''', a sickly young man who was enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum in order to aid the [[United States]] war effort. Captain America wears a costume that bears an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] motif, and is armed with an indestructible shield that can be thrown as a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bullpen Bulletins: Stan's Soapbox&quot; in Marvel Comics [[cover-date]]d December 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

An intentionally patriotic creation who was often depicted fighting the [[Axis powers]] of [[World War II]], Captain America was Timely Comics' most popular character during the wartime period. After the war ended, the character's popularity waned and he disappeared by the 1950s aside from an ill-fated revival in 1953. Captain America was reintroduced during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age of comics]] when he was revived from [[suspended animation]] by the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in ''The Avengers'' #4 (March 1964). Since then, Captain America has often led the team, as well as starring in his own series.

Steve Rogers was purportedly assassinated in ''Captain America'' vol. 5, #25 (March 2007), although he was later revealed to be alive. The comic-book series ''Captain America'' continued to be published,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=104091 | title=Marvel's Statement on ''Captain America'' #25 | work=[[Newsarama]] | date=March 7, 2007 | first=Matt | last=Brady | accessdate=March 7, 2007 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vZHFKjf3 | archivedate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Rogers' former sidekick, [[Bucky|James &quot;Bucky&quot; Barnes]], having taken up the mantle, and keeping it at the insistence of Rogers, who upon his return began operating as an intelligence agent in the ''[[Secret Avengers]]'' title, and in the [[limited series]] ''Steve Rogers: Super Soldier'' featuring one such field mission.

Captain America was the first Marvel Comics character adapted into another medium with the release of the [[1944 in film|1944]] [[Serial (film)|movie serial]] ''[[Captain America (serial)|Captain America]].'' Since then, the character has been featured in several other films and television series, the most recent being ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]],'' scheduled for release on July 22, 2011.

==Publication history==
In 1940, writer [[Joe Simon]] conceived the idea for Captain America and made a sketch of the character in costume .&lt;ref&gt;1974 [[Comic Art Convention]] program, cover&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I wrote the name 'Super American' at the bottom of the page,&quot; Simon said in his autobiography. &quot;No, it didn't work. There were too many 'Supers' around. 'Captain America' had a good sound to it. There weren't a lot of captains in comics. It was as easy as that. The boy companion was simply named Bucky, after my friend Bucky Pierson, a star on our high school basketball team.&quot;&lt;ref name=joesimonp50&gt;{{Cite book | last=Simon | first=Joe | coauthors=Jim Simon | title=The Comic Book Makers | publisher=Crestwood/II | year=1990 | page=50 | isbn=1-887591-35-4}} Reissued by Vanguard Productions in 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon recalled in his autobiography that [[Timely Comics]] publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] gave him the go-ahead from and directed that a Captain America solo comic book series be published as soon as possible. Needing to fill a full comic with primarily one character's stories, Simon did not believe that his regular creative partner, artist [[Jack Kirby]], could handle the workload alone:

{{bquote|I didn't have a lot of objections to putting a crew on the first issue.... There were two young artists from [[Connecticut]] that had made a strong impression on me. [[Al Avison]] and [[Al Gabriele]] often worked together and were quite successful in adapting their individual styles to each other. Actually, their work was not too far from [that of] Kirby's. If they worked on it, and if one inker tied the three styles together, I believed the final product would emerge as quite uniform. The two Als were eager to join in on the new ''Captain America'' book, but Jack Kirby was visibly upset. 'You're still number one, Jack,' I assured him. 'It's just a matter of a quick deadline for the first issue.'}}

{{bquote|'I'll make the deadline,' Jack promised. 'I'll pencil it [all] myself and make the deadline.' I hadn't expected this kind of reaction ... but I acceded to Kirby's wishes and, it turned out, was lucky that I did. There might have been two Als, but there was only one Jack Kirby.}}

{{bquote|I wrote the first ''Captain America'' book with penciled lettering right on the drawing boards, with very rough sketches for figures and backgrounds. Kirby did his thing, building the muscular anatomy, adding ideas and pepping up the action as only he could. Then he tightened up the penciled drawings, adding detailed backgrounds, faces and figures.&lt;ref name=joesimonp50 /&gt;}}

[[Image:1974ComicArtCon book.jpg|thumb|left|1974 [[Comic Art Convention]] program featuring Simon's original sketch of Captain America.]]
[[Al Liederman]] would ink that first issue, which was lettered by Simon and Kirby's regular letterer, Howard Ferguson.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon said Captain America was a consciously political creation; he and Kirby were morally repulsed by the actions of [[Nazi Germany]] in the years leading up to the United States' involvement in World War II and felt war was inevitable: &quot;The opponents to the war were all quite well organized. We wanted to have our say too.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright 36&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Wright | first=Bradford W. | title=Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America | publisher=Johns Hopkins | year=2001 | isbn=0-8018-7450-5 | page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Captain America Comics'' #1 — [[cover-date]]d March 1941 and on sale in December 1940, a year before the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]], but a full year into World War II — showed the protagonist punching Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]] in the jaw — sold nearly one million copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;fromm&quot;&gt;Per researcher Keif Fromm, ''Alter Ego'' #49, p. 4 (caption).&lt;/ref&gt; While most readers responded favorably to the comic, some took objection. Simon noted, &quot;When the first issue came out we got a lot of... threatening letters and hate mail. Some people really opposed what Cap stood for.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright 36&quot;/&gt; Though preceded as a &quot;patriotically themed superhero&quot; by [[Archie Comics|MLJ]]'s [[The Shield (Archie)|The Shield]], Captain America immediately became the most prominent and enduring of that wave of superheroes introduced in American comic books prior to and during [[World War II]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. With his sidekick Bucky, Captain America faced [[Nazism|Nazis]], [[Japan]]ese, and other threats to wartime America and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Captain America soon became Timely's most popular character and even had a fan-club called the &quot;Sentinels of Liberty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright 36&quot;/&gt; Circulation figures remained close to a million copies per month after the debut issue, which outstripped even the circulation of news magazines like ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' during the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Daniels | first=Les | title=Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics | publisher=Harry N.

The character was also featured in ''[[All Winners Comics]]'' #1-19 (Summer 1941 – Fall 1946), ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #80-84 and #86-92, ''[[USA Comics]]'' #6-17 (Dec. 1942 – Fall 1945), and ''[[All Select Comics]]'' #1-10 (Fall 1943 – Summer 1946).

In the post-war era, with the popularity of superheroes fading, Captain America led Timely/Marvel's first superhero team, the [[All-Winners Squad]], in its two published adventures, in ''[[All Winners Comics]]'' #19 and #21 (Fall–Winter 1946; there was no issue #20). After Bucky was shot and wounded in a 1948 ''Captain America'' story, he was succeeded by Captain America's girlfriend, Betsy Ross, who became the superheroine [[Golden Girl]]. ''Captain America Comics'' ended with issue #75 (February 1950), by which time the series had been titled ''Captain America's Weird Tales'' for two issues, with the finale being a horror/suspense anthology issue with no superheroes.

Marvel's 1950s iteration, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], attempted to revive its superhero titles when it reintroduced Captain America, along with the original Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner, in ''Young Men'' #24 (Dec. 1953). Billed as &quot;Captain America, Commie Smasher!&quot;&lt;!--note: This is a cover nickname on all his 1950s comics, and presented in all caps like &quot;Daredevil, The Man Without Fear.&quot; And in any case, &quot;Commie,&quot; short for &quot;Communist,&quot; a proper noun, is always capped--&gt; Captain America appeared during the next year in ''Young Men'' #24-28 and ''Men's Adventures'' #27-28, as well as in issues #76-78 of an eponymous title. Atlas' attempted superhero revival was a commercial failure,&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; and the character's title was canceled with ''Captain America'' #78 (Sept. 1954).

===Silver Age revival===
In the [[Human Torch]] story titled &quot;Captain America&quot; in Marvel Comics' ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #114 (Nov. 1963),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=18004  | title=Grand Comics Database: ''Strange Tales'' #114 (Nov. 1963) | work=Comics.org | accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist and co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]] depicted the brash young [[Fantastic Four]] member Johnny Storm, the Human Torch, in an exhibition performance with Captain America, described as a legendary [[World War II]] and 1950s superhero who has returned after many years of apparent retirement. The 18-page story ends with this Captain America revealed as an impostor: it was actually the villain the [[Acrobat (comics)|Acrobat]], a former circus performer the Torch had defeated in ''Strange Tales'' #106. Afterward, Storm digs out an old comic book in which Captain America is shown to be Steve Rogers. A caption in the final panel says this story was a test to see if readers would like Captain America to return.

Captain America was then formally reintroduced in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #4 (March 1964), which explained that in the final days of WWII, he had fallen from an experimental [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone plane]] into the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]] and spent decades frozen in a block of ice in a state of [[suspended animation]]. He quickly became leader of that superhero team. Following the success of other Marvel characters introduced during the 1960s, Captain America was recast as a hero &quot;haunted by past memories, and trying to adapt to 1960s society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

After then guest-starring in the feature &quot;[[Iron Man]]&quot; in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #58 (Oct. 1964), Captain America gained his own solo feature in that &quot;split book,&quot; beginning the following issue. Kirby, Captain America's co-creator, was illustrating his hero's solo adventures again for the first time since 1941. Issue #63 (March 1965), which retold Captain America's origin, through issue #71 (Nov. 1965) was a period feature set during World War II and co-starred Captain America's Golden Age sidekick, Bucky.

In the 1970s, the post-war versions of Captain America were [[retcon]]ned into separate, successive characters who briefly took up the mantle of Captain America after Steve Rogers went into [[suspended animation]] near the end of World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;captainamerica153-156&quot;&gt;''Captain America'' #153-156 (Sept.–Dec. 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;whatif4&quot;&gt;''What If?'' #4 (Aug. 1977)&lt;/ref&gt; The hero found a new generation of readers as leader of the all-star superhero team the Avengers, and in a new solo feature beginning in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #59 (Nov. 1964), a &quot;split book&quot; shared with the feature &quot;[[Iron Man]]&quot;. Kirby drew all but two of the stories in ''Tales of Suspense,'' which became ''Captain America'' with #100 (April 1968); [[Gil Kane]] and [[John Romita, Sr.]], each filled in once. Several stories were finished by penciller-inker [[George Tuska]] over Kirby layouts, with one finished by Romita Sr. and another by penciller [[Dick Ayers]] and inker [[John Tartaglione]]. Kirby's regular inkers on the series were [[Frank Giacoia]] (as &quot;Frank Ray&quot;) and [[Joe Sinnott]], though [[Don Heck]] and Golden Age Captain America artist [[Syd Shores]] inked one story each. The new title ''Captain America'' continued to feature artwork by Kirby, as well as a short run by [[Jim Steranko]], and work by many of the industry's top artists and writers. It was called ''Captain America and the Falcon'' from #134-222 (although the Falcon's name was not on the cover for issues #193, 200, and 216).

This series — considered ''Captain America'' volume one by comics researchers and historians,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/capamer2.htm#S35 | title=The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators: ''Captain America'' (I) (1968–1996) | accessdate=March 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the 1940s ''Captain America Comics'' and its 1950s numbering continuation — ended with #454 (Aug. 1996).

There were attempts for a second series such as ''Captain America Sentinel of Liberty'' (Sept. 1998 – Aug. 1999) and ''[[Captain America and the Falcon]]'' (May 2004 – June 2005).

As part of the aftermath of Marvel Comics' company crossover &quot;[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]&quot;,&lt;!--the CROSSOVER STORY ARC is in quote marks; the actual one comic book SERIES titled is in italics--&gt; Steve Rogers was killed in ''Captain America'' vol. 5, #25 (March 2007). Series writer [[Ed Brubaker]] remarked, &quot;What I found is that all the really hard-core left-wing fans want Cap to be standing out on and giving speeches on the street corner against the [[George W.

===1940s===
[[Image:Captainamerica1.jpg|thumb|''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941). Cover art by [[Joe Simon]] (inks and pencils) and [[Jack Kirby]] (pencils).|alt=The front page of the first Captain America comic depicts Captain America punching [[Adolf Hitler]] in the jaw. A nazi soldier's bullet deflects from Captain America's shield, while Adolf Hitler falls onto a map of the [[United States of America]] and a document reading 'Sabotage plans for U.S.A.']]
Steve Rogers was born July 4, 1917, in the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], to [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants Sarah and Joseph Rogers.&lt;ref name=&quot;sentinel&quot;&gt;''Adventures of Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty'' #1-4 (Oct. 1991 – Jan. 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Rogers died when Steve was only a child and his mother, Sarah, died of pneumonia while Steve was a teen. By early 1940, before America's entry into [[World War II]], Rogers is a tall but scrawny [[fine art]]s student specializing in illustration. Disturbed by the rise of the [[Third Reich]], Rogers attempts to enlist, only to be rejected due to being in poor shape. U.S. Army General [[Chester Phillips]], looking for test subjects, offers Rogers the chance to serve his country by taking part in a top-secret defense project — Operation: Rebirth, which seeks to develop a means of creating physically superior soldiers. Rogers volunteers for the research and, after a rigorous selection process, is chosen as the first human test subject for the [[Supersoldier|Super-Soldier]] serum developed by the scientist &quot;Dr. Josef Reinstein,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;captainamericacomics1&quot;&gt;''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;modernorigin&quot;&gt;''Captain America'' #109 (January 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; later [[retcon|retroactively changed]] to a code name for the scientist [[Abraham Erskine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stern origin&quot;&gt;''Captain America'' #255 (March 1981). The name &quot;Erskine&quot; was first used in a Captain America novel by Ted White in ''The Great Gold Steal'' (Bantam Books, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

That night, Operation: Rebirth is implemented and Rogers receives injections and oral doses of the Super-Soldier Serum. He is then exposed to a controlled burst of &quot;Vita-Rays&quot; that activate and stabilize the chemicals in his system. Although the process is arduous physically, it successfully alters his physiology almost instantly from its relatively frail form to the maximum of human efficiency, greatly enhancing his musculature and reflexes. Erskine declares Rogers to be the first of a new breed of man, a &quot;nearly perfect human being.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;modernorigin&quot;/&gt;

The process he underwent has varied from account to account. In the original 1941 story, he was injected with the formula. When the origin was retold in ''Tales of Suspense'' #63, the Comics Code Authority and its prohibitions on demonstrations of drug use were in force, and the injection was replaced with drinking a formula.&lt;ref name=&quot;tos origin&quot;&gt;''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #63 (March 1965)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Captain America'' #109, the Vita-Rays were first introduced, although a dialogue comment preserved continuity by mentioning that he had also drunk the formula beforehand. The retelling of the story in ''Captain America'' #255, however, stated that all three were used in combination.

After the physical transformation, a Nazi [[secret agent|spy]] reveals himself and shoots Erskine. Because the scientist had committed the crucial portions of the Super-Soldier formula to memory, it cannot be duplicated. The spy dies, killed either while running away to escape Rogers or because Rogers threw him into live machinery. In the 1941 origin story and the ''Tales of Suspense'' #63 version, he dies when running into the machinery but is not killed by Rogers; in the ''Captain America'' #109 and #255 revision, however, Rogers causes the spy's death by punching him into the machinery.&lt;ref name=&quot;modernorigin&quot;/&gt;

The [[United States]] government, making the most of its one super-soldier and to hide all information about Operation: Rebirth and its failure, re-imagines him as a superhero who serves as both a [[counter-intelligence]] agent and a [[propaganda]] symbol to counter Nazi [[Germany]]'s head of terrorist operations, the [[Red Skull]]. To that end, Rogers is given a uniform modeled after the [[American flag]] (based on Rogers' own sketches&lt;ref name=&quot;sentinel&quot;/&gt;) a bulletproof shield, a personal [[side arm]], and the codename Captain America. He is also given a cover identity as a clumsy [[infantry]] private at Camp Lehigh in Virginia. Barely out of his teens himself, Rogers makes friends with the camp's teenage [[mascot]], James Buchanan &quot;Bucky&quot; Barnes.&lt;ref name=&quot;captainamericacomics1&quot;/&gt;

Barnes accidentally learns of Rogers' [[secret identity|dual identity]] and offers to keep the secret if he can become Captain America's [[sidekick]]. Rogers agrees and trains Barnes. Rogers meets President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who presents him with [[Captain America's shield|a new shield]], forged from an alloy of [[steel]] and [[vibranium]], fused by an unknown catalyst. The alloy is indestructible, yet the shield is light enough to use as a [[discus]]-like weapon that can be angled to return to him. It proves so effective that Captain America forgoes the sidearm.&lt;ref name=&quot;stern origin&quot;/&gt; Throughout World War II, Captain America and Bucky fight the Nazi menace both on their own and as members of the superhero team the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] (as seen in the 1970s comic of the same name).&lt;ref name=&quot;invaders&quot;&gt;''[[Invaders (comics)|Giant-Sized Invaders]]'' #1 (June 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Captain America also battles a number of criminal menaces on American soil, including a wide variety of costumed villains: the Wax Man,&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America Comics'' #2 (April 1941)&lt;/ref&gt; the Hangman,&lt;ref name=&quot;Captain America Comics #6&quot;&gt;''Captain America Comics'' #6 (Aug. 1941)&lt;/ref&gt; the Fang,&lt;ref name=&quot;Captain America Comics #6&quot;/&gt; the Black Talon,&lt;ref name=&quot;Captain America Comics #9&quot;&gt;''Captain America Comics'' #9 (Nov. 1941)&lt;/ref&gt; and the White Death,&lt;ref name=&quot;Captain America Comics #9&quot;/&gt; among many others.

In late April 1945, during the closing days of World War II, Captain America and Bucky try to stop the villainous [[Baron Heinrich Zemo|Baron Zemo]] from destroying an experimental drone plane. Zemo launches the plane with an armed explosive on it, with Rogers and Barnes in hot pursuit. They reach the plane just before it takes off, but when Bucky tries to defuse the bomb, it explodes in mid-air. The young man is believed killed, and Rogers is hurled into the freezing waters of the North Atlantic. Neither body is found, and both are presumed dead. It is later revealed that neither character actually died.&lt;ref name=&quot;theavengers4&quot;/&gt;

===Late 1940s to 1950s===
Captain America continued to appear in comics for the next few years changing from World War II-era hero fighting against the Nazis to trying to defeat the United States' newest enemy, [[Communism]]. The revival of the character in the mid-1950s is short-lived, and events during that time period are later [[retcon]]ned to show that multiple people operated using the code name in order to explain the changes in the character.

The last of these other Captains was a man who was so devoted to emulating Captain America that he had had his appearance surgically altered to resemble Rogers. Furthermore, he also treated himself and a protege to an acquired Nazi copy of the Super-Soldier serum to become the new Captain America and Bucky, but were unaware of the necessary Vita-Ray component. As a result, the raw chemicals administered began to have serious detrimental effects on the pair's minds, rendering them both violently paranoid and regarding even innocent people as communist sympathizers during the height of the [[Red Scare]] of the 1950s. After it became evident that the two were insane, they were captured and placed in indefinite cryogenic storage.

===1960s to 1970s===

Years later,&lt;ref name=&quot;theavengers4&quot;&gt;''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #4 (March 1964)&lt;/ref&gt; the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] discovers Steve Rogers' body in the North Atlantic, the Captain's uniform under his soldier's fatigues and still carrying his shield. After he revives, they piece together that Rogers had been preserved in a block of ice since 1945, surviving in such a state only because of his enhancements from Operation: Rebirth. The block had begun to melt after the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]], enraged that an [[Arctic]] [[Inuit]] tribe is worshiping the frozen figure, throws it into the ocean. Rogers accepts membership in the Avengers, and although long out of his time, his considerable combat experience makes him a valuable asset to the team. He quickly assumes leadership,&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' #16 (May 1965)&lt;/ref&gt; and has typically returned to that position throughout the team's history.

Captain America is plagued by guilt for having been unable to prevent Bucky's death-—a feeling that does not ease for some time. Although he takes the young [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] (who closely resembles Bucky) under his tutelage, he refuses for some time to allow Jones to take up the Bucky identity, not wishing to be responsible for another youth's death. Insisting that his hero finally move on from that loss, Jones eventually convinces Rogers to let him don the Bucky costume,&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #110 (Feb. 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; but this partnership lasts only a short time; a disguised [[Red Skull]], impersonating Rogers with the help of the [[Cosmic Cube]], drives Jones away.

Rogers also reunites with his old war comrade [[Nick Fury]], who is similarly well-preserved due to the &quot;Infinity Formula.&quot; As a result, Rogers regularly undertakes missions for the security agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] for which Fury is public director.&lt;ref name=&quot;tos78&quot;&gt;''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #78 (June 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; Through Fury, Rogers befriends [[Sharon Carter]], a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent,&lt;ref&gt;''Tales of Suspense'' #75 (March 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he eventually begins a romantic relationship.

Rogers later meets and trains Sam Wilson, who becomes the superhero the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]],&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #117 (Sept. 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[African-American]] superhero in mainstream comic books{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}.&lt;!--Black Panther is African, not African-American; Falcon predates Luke Cage and John Stewart Green Lantern. See [[List of African-American firsts]]. Lion Man debuted in 1947 in All-Negro Comics, but this book did not have national distribution and cannot be considered &quot;mainstream&quot;--&gt; The characters established an enduring friendship and adventuring partnership, sharing the series title for some time as ''Captain America and the Falcon''.&lt;ref name=&quot;falcon&quot;&gt;''Captain America'' #117-119 (Sept.–Nov.1969)&lt;/ref&gt; The two later encounter the revived but still insane [[Grand Director|1950s Captain America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;captainamerica153-156&quot;/&gt; Although Rogers and the Falcon defeat the faux Rogers and Jack Monroe, Rogers becomes deeply disturbed that he could have suffered his counterpart's fate.

The series also dealt with the [[Marvel Universe]]'s version of the [[Watergate scandal]], making Rogers so uncertain about his role that he abandons his Captain America identity in favor of one called [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]]. During this time, several men unsuccessfully assume the Captain America identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;captainamerica176&quot;&gt;''Captain America'' #176-183 (Aug. 1974 – March 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers eventually re-assumes it after coming to consider that the identity could be a symbol of American ideals and not its government; it's a personal conviction epitomized when he later confronted a corrupt Army officer attempting to manipulate him by appealing to his loyalty, &quot;I'm loyal to nothing, General... except the [American] Dream.&quot; Jack Monroe, cured of his mental instability, later takes up the Nomad alias.&lt;ref name=&quot;captainamerica282&quot;&gt;''Captain America'' #282 (June 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Rogers also temporarily gains super strength.&lt;ref name=&quot;captainamerica159&quot;&gt;''Captain America'' #159 (March 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after witnessing Number One's suicide, he is summoned to the future to participate in the [[Avengers Forever|Destiny War]] between [[Kang the Conqueror]] and [[Immortus]] (it is revealed over the course of the story that Rogers was selected from this time frame as, had he been taken from any other time period, his strong personality- shaken at this point by the events he had just witnessed- would have dominated the team and deprived them of the flexibility required to succeed in their mission, although his presence alone still brought cohesion to the group).&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Forever'' #11 (Nov. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; He also learns of the apparent death of Sharon Carter.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #237 (Sept. 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, in addition to runs from such acclaimed creators as [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], the series reveals the true face and full origin of the [[Red Skull]]. Rogers meets law student [[Bernie Rosenthal]],&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #248 (Aug. 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; who becomes his girlfriend. He also takes Jack Monroe, Nomad, as a partner for a time.&lt;ref name=&quot;captainamerica282&quot;/&gt; He also meets [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]] at this time.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #310 (Oct. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; The heroes gathered by the [[Beyonder]] elect Rogers as leader during their stay on [[Battleworld]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Secret Wars]]'' #1 (May 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-time writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] explores numerous political and social themes, such as extreme idealism when Captain America fights the anti-nationalist terrorist [[Flag-Smasher]];&lt;ref name=&quot;flagsmasher&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer=Gruenwald, Mark | Title=Captain America | Issue=312 | Date=Dec. 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[vigilante|vigilantism]] when he hunts the murderous [[Scourge of the Underworld]].&lt;ref name=&quot;scourge&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer=Gruenwald, Mark | Title=Captain America | Issue=318-320 | Date=June–Aug. 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; He takes [[Demolition Man (comics)|D-Man]] as his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer=Gruenwald, Mark | Title=Captain America | Issue=328 | Date=April 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homophobia]] was also dealt with as Steve Rogers runs into a childhood friend named Arnold Roth.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #270 (June 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers receives a large back-pay reimbursement dating back to his disappearance at the end of World War II, and a [[Commission on Superhuman Activities|government commission]] orders him to work directly for the U.S. government. Already troubled by the corruption he had encountered with the [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]] incident in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bornagain&quot;&gt;''Daredevil'' #227-233 (Feb.–Aug. 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers chooses instead to resign his identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer=Gruenwald, Mark | Title=Captain America | Issue=332 | Date=Aug. 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then takes the alias of &quot;the Captain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer=Gruenwald, Mark | Title=Captain America | Issue=335 | Date=Nov. 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; A replacement Captain America, John Walker, struggles to emulate Rogers' ideals until pressure from hidden enemies helps to drive Walker insane. Rogers returns to the Captain America identity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer=Gruenwald, Mark | Title=Captain America | Issue=350 | Date=Feb. 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a recovered Walker becomes the [[U.S. Agent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;captainamerica322-351&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer=Gruenwald, Mark | Title=Captain America | Issue=332-351 | Date=Aug. 1987 – March 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime afterward, Rogers avoids the explosion of a [[methamphetamine]] lab, but the drug triggers a chemical reaction in the Super-Soldier serum in his system. To combat the reaction, Rogers has the serum removed from his body, and trains constantly to maintain his physical condition.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #378 (Oct. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[retcon]] later establishes that the serum was not a drug per se, which would have metabolized out of his system, but in fact a virus-like organism that effected a biochemical and genetic change. This additionally explained how arch-nemesis [[Red Skull]], who at the time inhabited a body [[cloning|cloned]] from Rogers' cells, also has the formula in his body.

Because of his altered biochemistry, Rogers' body begins to deteriorate, and for a time he must wear a powered [[exoskeleton]] and is eventually placed again in suspended animation. During this time, he is given a transfusion of blood from the [[Red Skull]], which cures his condition and stabilizes the Super-Soldier virus in his system. Captain America returns both to crime fighting and the Avengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;captainamerica425-454&quot;&gt;''Captain America'' #425-454 (March 1994 – Aug. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
Rogers reveals his identity to the world, and establishes a residence in the [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;captainamerica1&quot;&gt;''Captain America'' vol. 2, #1-7 (June 2002 – Feb. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the events of ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'', again under the employ of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Rogers discovers that Bucky is alive, having been saved and deployed by Soviet espionage interests as the [[Bucky#Winter Soldier|Winter Soldier]]. Rogers also resumes his on-again, off-again relationship with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Sharon Carter]], who, after his death, believes she is pregnant with Steve Rogers' child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Ed Brubaker|Brubaker, Ed]] | Title=Captain America | Volume=5 | Issue=1 | Date=Nov. 2004 | Publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2006-2007 &quot;[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]&quot; crossover,&lt;!--the EVENT is in quote marks; the actual one comic-book SERIES titled that is italics--&gt; Captain America opposes mandatory federal registration of all super-powered beings, which he sees as an erosion of civil liberties for the superhero community, and leads the Anti-[[Registration Acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Registration]] faction and resistance movement. He becomes a fugitive and opposes the heroes of the Pro-Registration group, including his former friend [[Iron Man]]. He adopts the alias &quot;Brett Hendrick&quot;, a [[Shopping mall|mall]] [[security guard]], to avoid government detection.&lt;ref name=&quot;civilwar1-7&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Mark Millar|Millar, Mark]] | Title=[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] | Issue=1-7 | Date=July 2006 – Jan. 2007 | Publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the War continues, Cap enlists the assistance of several figures with whom he would not choose to ally himself under normal circumstances, such as the [[Punisher]] and the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;civilwar:warcrimes1&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Frank Tieri (comics)|Tieri, Frank]] | Title=[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: War Crimes]] | Issue=1 | Date=Feb. 2007 | Publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain America battles Iron Man during the climactic battle and has victory within his grasp when a group of civilians attempts to restrain him. Rogers realizes that he is endangering the very people he has sworn to protect. He then surrenders to the authorities and orders the Anti-Registration forces to stand down. As Rogers is led away in handcuffs, the [[Punisher]] retrieves Captain America's discarded mask.&lt;ref name=&quot;civilwar7&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Mark Millar|Millar, Mark]] | Title=Civil War | Issue=7 | Date=Jan. 2007 | Publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:capdeath.PNG|thumb|Steve Rogers' presumed death. Art by [[Steve Epting]].]]
''[[The Death of Captain America]]'' story arc follows his surrender. Steve Rogers is indicted on multiple criminal charges; as he is brought to a federal courthouse, a sniper shoots him in the back. In the chaos that ensues, he is wounded three more times in the stomach and chest by [[Sharon Carter]]. Rogers is taken to a hospital, where by all evidence he dies.&lt;ref name=&quot;cav5n25&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer=Brubaker, Ed | Title=Captain America | Volume=5 | Issue=25 | Date=March 2007 | Publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assassination, orchestrated by the Red Skull, involves [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] as the sniper and [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Dr. Faustus]] posing as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] psychiatrist, who gives Carter a hypnotic suggestion to shoot Rogers at a crucial moment.&lt;ref name=&quot;cav5n25&quot;/&gt;

The superhero community is shaken by the assassination. The [[Punisher]] temporarily adopts a costume similar to that of Captain America, while [[Bucky#Winter Soldier|Winter Soldier]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] seek to avenge Rogers' death. The Winter Soldier steals Captain America's shield, and the Punisher provides him with the mask from Steve Rogers' uniform.&lt;ref&gt;''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2, #11 (Nov. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Captain America is publicly laid to rest in [[Arlington National Cemetery]], under a monument built in his honor. The body in Arlington is a fake: Tony Stark, accompanied by [[Hank Pym]] and [[Janet Van Dyne]], returns Rogers' body to the [[Arctic]] where Rogers had been found years before. [[Namor]] attends the small private ceremony and vows no one will disturb the site.&lt;ref&gt;''Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America'' #1-5 (June–Aug. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Stark receives a letter containing Rogers' final requests: Stark should &quot;save&quot; Bucky, and that, despite his demise, the world still needs Captain America.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' vol. 5, #30 (Sept. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Bucky accepts Stark's offer to take on the mantle of Captain America in exchange for a promise of autonomy from Stark.&lt;ref name=&quot;Captain America #34&quot;&gt;''Captain America'' vol. 5, #34 (Jan. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Bucky kept Rogers' trademark shield, but donned a new costume and began carrying a pistol and a knife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Captain America #34&quot;/&gt; The [[Norse god]] superhero [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] communicates with what appears to be Rogers' spirit on the first anniversary of Rogers' death, subsequently using his powers to shut down all communication across America for sixty seconds so that his comrade can have sixty seconds of silence where people are not debating about what he would do or approve of.&lt;ref&gt;''Thor'' vol. 3, #11 (Oct. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Steve Rogers Super Soldier.jpg|thumb|left|Promotional art for ''Steve Rogers: Super Soldier'' #1 (Sept. 2010) by [[Carlos Pacheco]] and [[Tim Townsend]].]]
''[[Captain America: Reborn]]'' #1 revealed that Rogers did not die; instead, the villainous [[Red Skull]] had [[Sharon Carter]] use a gun that transported him to a fixed position in space and time. Since then, Captain America had been phasing in and out of space and time, appearing at events in his lifetime and fighting battles. The Red Skull brings Rogers back to the present, where he takes control of Rogers' mind and body. Rogers eventually regains control, and with help from his allies, defeats the Red Skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer=Brubaker, Ed | Title=Captain America: Reborn | Issue=4 | Date=Nov. 2009 | Publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot comic]] ''Captain America: Who Will Wield the Shield?'', taking place after the conclusion to ''Reborn'', Rogers formally hands Bucky his Captain America shield and asks his former sidekick to continue as Captain America. Later, the [[President of the United States]] grants Rogers a full [[pardon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer=Brubaker, Ed | Title=Captain America: Who Will Wield the Shield? | Issue=1 | Date=Dec. 2009 | Publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
Following the company-wide &quot;[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]&quot; and &quot;[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]&quot; story arcs, the Steve Rogers character became part of the &quot;[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]&quot; arc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Dave | last=Richards | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=26287 | title=Storming Heaven: 'Siege' #4 | work=Comic Book Resources | date=May 18, 2010 | accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. president appoints Rogers, in his civilian identity, as head of the nation's security, replacing [[Norman Osborn]]. The [[Superhuman Registration Act]] is repealed and Rogers reestablishes the [[superhero]] team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. In the [[miniseries]] ''Steve Rogers: Super Soldier'', he encounters Jacob Erskine, the grandson of Professor Abraham Erskine and the son of Tyler Paxton, one of Rogers' fellow volunteers in the Super-Soldier program, the serum in his body being briefly deactivated before Rogers manages to force his enemies to restore it thanks to his combat training allowing him to hold his own despite his weakened physique. Rogers also becomes the leader of the [[Secret Avengers]], a [[black-op]]s team that operates under a veil of secrecy.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:CAtransformation.png|thumb|Steve Rogers' physical transformation, from a reprint of ''Captain America Comics'' #1 (May 1941). Art by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]].]]
Despite the fact that he is specifically described otherwise in early stories, the modern version of Captain America has no superhuman powers, although as a result of the Super-Soldier Serum and &quot;Vita-Ray&quot; treatment, he is transformed from a frail young man into a &quot;perfect&quot; specimen of human development and conditioning. Captain America's strength, endurance, agility, speed, reflexes, durability, and healing are at the highest limits of natural human potential. Rogers' body regularly replenishes the super-soldier serum; it does not wear off.&lt;ref name=&quot;steetsofpoison&quot;&gt;''Captain America'' #372-378 (May–Nov. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula enhances all of his metabolic functions and prevents the build-up of [[lactic acid|fatigue poisons]] in his muscles, giving him endurance far in excess of an ordinary human being. This accounts for many of his extraordinary feats, including bench pressing 1100 pounds (500&amp;nbsp;kg) and running a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) in little more than a minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;captainamerica65anniversary&quot;&gt;''Captain America 65th Anniversary Special'' (May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, his enhancements are the reason why he was able to survive being frozen in suspended animation for decades. Rogers cannot become intoxicated by alcohol, drugs, or impurities in the air and is immune to terrestrial diseases.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} He is also highly resistant to hypnosis or gases that could limit his focus.&lt;ref&gt;''[[JLA/Avengers|Avengers/JLA]]'' #4 (May 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
There have been many attempts to recreate this formula but after the death of its creator the secrets of creating a super-soldier died with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;talesofsuspense63&quot;&gt;''Tales of Suspense'' #63 (March 1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers' battle experience and training make him an expert [[Military tactics|tactician]] and an excellent field commander, with his teammates frequently deferring to his orders in battle. Rogers' reflexes and senses are also extraordinarily keen. He has blended [[judo]], [[Boxing|western boxing]], [[kickboxing]], and gymnastics into his own unique fighting style and is a master of multiple martial arts. Years of practice with his indestructible shield make him able to aim and throw it with almost unerring accuracy. His skill with his shield is such that he can attack multiple targets in succession with a single throw or even cause a [[boomerang]]-like return from a throw to attack an enemy from behind. In canon, he is regarded by other skilled fighters as one of the best [[hand-to-hand combat]]ants in the Marvel Universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;captainamerica302&quot;&gt;''Captain America'' #302 (Feb. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;captainamerica375&quot;&gt;''Captain America'' #375 (Aug. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the super-soldier serum is an important part of his strength, Rogers has shown himself still capable in sufficient ways against stronger opponents even when the serum has been deactivated and he has reverted to his pre-Captain America physique.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Rogers: Super-Soldier #3&quot;&gt;''Steve Rogers: Super-Soldier'' #3 (Nov. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers has vast [[U.S. military]] knowledge and is often shown to be familiar with ongoing, classified Defense Department operations. He is an expert in combat strategy, survival, acrobatics, military strategy, piloting, and demolitions. Despite his high profile as one of the world's most popular and recognizable superheroes, Rogers also has a broad understanding of the espionage community, largely through his ongoing relationship with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] He occasionally makes forays into mundane career fields, including commercial arts, comic book artistry, education (high school history), and law enforcement.

===Weapons and equipment===
{{Further|[[Captain America's shield]]}}
Captain America uses several shields throughout his history, the most prevalent of which is a nigh-indestructible disc-shaped shield made from an experimental [[alloy]] of steel and the fictional [[vibranium]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #303-304 (March–April 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; The shield was cast by American metallurgist [[Dr. Myron MacLain]], who was contracted by the U.S. government, from orders of [[President]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], to create an impenetrable substance to use for tanks during World War II.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} This alloy was created by accident and never duplicated, although efforts to reverse-engineer it resulted in the creation of [[adamantium]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Captain America often uses his shield as an offensive throwing weapon. The first instance of Captain America's trademark ricocheting shield-toss occurs in [[Stan Lee]]'s first comics writing, the two-page text story &quot;Captain America Foils the Traitor's Revenge&quot; in ''Captain America Comics'' #3 (May 1941).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Thomas | first=Roy | title=Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe | publisher=Sterling Publishing | location=New York | year=2006 | page=11 | isbn=1-4027-4225-8}} The line reads: &quot;With the speed of thought, he sent his shield spinning through the air to the other end of the tent, where it smacked the knife out of Haines' hand!&quot; It became a convention starting the following issue, in which the art in a Simon and Kirby comics story illustrates the following caption: &quot;Captain America's speed of thought and action save Bucky's life — as he hurls his shield across the room.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of the shield among other comics characters includes the time-traveling mutant superhero [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] telling Captain America that his shield still exists in one of the possible futures; Cable carries it into battle and brandishes it as a symbol.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cable &amp; Deadpool]]'' #25 (April 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

When without his trademark shield, Captain America sometimes uses other shields made from less durable metals such as steel,{{Issue|date=March 2010}} or even a photonic energy shield designed to mimic a vibranium matrix.{{Issue|date=March 2010}} Rogers, having relinquished his regular shield to Barnes, carries a variant of the energy shield which can be used with either arm, and used to either block attacks or as an improvised offensive weapon able to cut through metal with relative ease.&lt;ref&gt;''Steve Rogers: Super-Soldier'' #4 (Dec. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Much like his vibranium shield, the energy shield can also be thrown, including ricocheting off multiple surfaces and returning to his hand.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain America's uniform is made of a fire-retardant material, and he wears a lightweight, bulletproof &quot;duralumin&quot; [[Mail (armour)|scale armor]] beneath his uniform for added protection.&lt;ref name=&quot;stern origin&quot;/&gt; Originally, Rogers' mask was a separate piece of material, but an early engagement had it dislodged, thus almost exposing his identity. To prevent a recurrence of the situation, Rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform, an added benefit of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck. Since then, events have forced him to reveal his identity to the world. As a member of the Avengers, Rogers has an Avengers priority card, which serves as a communications device.

Captain America has also used a custom special [[Harley Davidson]] motorcycle, modified by the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] weapons laboratory, as well as a custom-built battle van, constructed by the [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]] Design Group with the ability to change its color for disguise purposes, and fitted to store and conceal the custom motorcycle in its rear section.

==Enemies==
{{Main|List of Captain America enemies}}
Captain America has faced numerous foes in over 60 years of published adventures. Many of his recurring foes embody ideals contrary to the American values Captain America is shown to strive for and believe. Some examples of these opposing values are Nazism ([[Red Skull]], [[Baron Zemo]]), [[Neo-Nazism]] ([[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]]), technocratic fascism ([[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], [[Arnim Zola]]), Communism ([[Aleksander Lukin]]), anarchism (Flag Smasher and Viper), and international and domestic terrorism ([[HYDRA]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Christian countercult movement''' is a collective description for many, mostly unrelated, [[Christian ministry|Christian ministries]] and individual [[Christian]]s who oppose religious groups whose doctrines or practices do not fit within their definition of mainstream [[Christianity]], which they consider to be [[cult]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas E Cowan author.  Bearing False Witness? Introduction to the Christian Counter Cult. http://www.amazon.com/dp/0275974596&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known as '''discernment ministries'''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Bowman, ''Orthodoxy and Heresy: A Biblical Guide to Doctrinal Discernment'', Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1992, pp. 10, 106-107, &amp; 123-124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Protagonists generally come from an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] or [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] background, although many have [[Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] or [[Oriental Orthodox|Ancient Oriental Orthodox]] roots.&lt;ref&gt;A survey of Catholic, Eastern orthodox and Protestant Evangelical countercult literature is found in John A. Saliba, ''Understanding New Religious Movements'', 2nd ed, Walnut Creek: AltaMira Press, 2003, pp. 203-239.&lt;/ref&gt;

The countercult movement asserts that non-Christian faiths are spiritually counterfeit and claims the authority to define &quot;true&quot; Christianity, and thus to define &quot;false&quot; Christianity. Christian apologists who write from within this movement argue that a religious body may be defined as a &quot;cult&quot; if its doctrines involve a denial of the teachings which they hold to be essential Christian doctrine (e.g., the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], the person and work of [[Christ]], [[salvation]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Walter R. Martin, ''The Rise of the Cults'', rev.ed. Santa Ana: Vision House, 1978, pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Abanes, ''Defending the Faith: A Beginner's Guide to Cults and New Religions'',Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1997, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Wayne House &amp; Gordon Carle, ''Doctrine Twisting: How Core Biblical Truths are Distorted'', Downers Grove: IVP, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some &quot;countercult&quot; groups consider other similar groups to be non-Christian, due to additional disagreements over doctrine or the use of a different translation of the [[Bible]].   Many of the Protestant groups consider Catholicism to be a cult, due to beliefs regarding the [[Pope]] and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] among others. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Many of the Catholic groups feel the same way about Protestant groups. Countercult ministries also concern themselves with religious groups that regard themselves as Christian, but hold beliefs which are interpreted by the ministries as contradictory to the Bible, including [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[Unification church]],  [[Christian Science]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], although some also target non-Christian  groups, such as [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Wicca]] and other [[Neopagan]] groups, [[New Age]] groups, [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and other Eastern religions.

Often used by anti-Christians as an extreme example, the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] takes issue with nearly all other churches due to a perceived lack of sufficient condemnation of [[homosexuality]]. However, the WBC is primarily a protest organization interested in media coverage and does not minister to cult members or produce information on how to get out of any particular cult. Thus the WBC is not considered to be an actual counter cult ministry by evangelicals or those who hold a fundamentalist viewpoint in Christian denominations.

Countercult literature usually expresses doctrinal or theological concerns and a [[missionary]] or [[apologetics|apologetic]] purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Garry W. Trompf,&quot;Missiology, Methodology and the Study of New Religious Movements,&quot; ''Religious Traditions'' Volume 10, 1987, pp. 95-106.&lt;/ref&gt; It seeks to identify problems with a given group's teachings or practices and present a rebuttal emphasizing doctrinal positions based upon a normal reading of the Holy Bible (i.e. it means what it says). Christian countercult writers also emphasize the need for the evangelization of followers of &quot;cults&quot;, and often present advice and strategies on how Christians may evangelize among targeted groups.&lt;ref&gt;Walter R. Martin, ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', rev.ed. Ravi Zacharias ed. Bloomington: Bethany House, 2003, pp.479-493.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Enroth ed. ''Evangelising the Cults'', Milton Keynes: Word, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman L Geisler &amp; Ron Rhodes, ''When Cultists Ask: A Popular Handbook on Cultic Misinterpretations'', Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their activities and orientation vary: some are [[missionary]] and [[apologetics|apologetically]] oriented, directed at current members of divergent groups, some are therapeutically oriented, directed mainly at former members of divergent groups, and others educationally oriented, directed at members of their own denomination or at the general public.

Some detractors claim a more radical arm actively protests and attempts to disrupt meetings of churches which they have labeled as &quot;cults.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Occasionally these so-called radical activist disruptions have been nothing more than pranks pulled by non-Christians in an effort to discredit Christians or a cause. This is evidenced by their arrival only after TV cameras show up at the event. Such tactics were used to discredit pro-life meetings and provide negative media coverage during speaking tours and visits in the 1980s and continue to this day. Most of these &quot;radicals&quot; are college students.

The Christian countercult movement, with its emphasis on apologetics and evangelism, does not constitute the totality of concerns which some people have about cult practices. Some Christians share concerns similar to those of the secular [[anti-cult movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Martin, ''Cult Proofing Your Kids'', Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joel A. MacCollam, ''Carnival of Souls: Religious Cults and Young People'', New York: Seabury Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Precursors and pioneers===
Christians have applied theological criteria to assess the teachings of non-orthodox movements throughout church history.&lt;ref&gt;Saliba, ''Understanding New Religious Movements'', pp.45-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold O. J. Brown, ''Heresies: The Image of Christ in the Mirror of Heresy and Orthodoxy from the Apostles to the Present'', Garden City: Doubleday, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.W.C.Wand, ''The Four Great Heresies:Nestorian, Eutychian, Apollinarian, Arian,'' London: A.R.Mowbray, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; The Apostles themselves were involved in challenging the doctrines and claims of various teachers. The Apostle Paul wrote an entire epistle, Galatians, antagonistic to the teachings of a Jewish sect that claimed adherence to the teachings of both Jesus and Moses (cf. Acts 15: &amp; Gal. 1:6-10). The Apostle John devoted his first Epistle to countering early proto-gnostic cults that had arisen in the first century, all claiming to be &quot;Christian&quot; (1 Jn. 2:19).

The early Church in the post-apostolic period was much more involved in &quot;defending its frontiers against alternative soteriologies&amp;nbsp;— either by defining its own position with greater and greater exactness, or by attacking other religions, and particularly the Hellenistic mysteries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Sharpe, ''Comparative Religion: A History'', London: Duckworth, 1975, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, a good deal of the early Christian literature is devoted to the exposure and refutation of unorthodox  theology, mystery religions and Gnostic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Heresies'', pp.38-69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald H. Nash, ''Christianity and the Hellenistic World'', Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984, pp.213-224.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]], and [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] were among the greatest early Christian apologists who engaged in critical analyses of unorthodox theology, Greco-Roman pagan religions, and Gnostic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Avery Dulles, ''A History of Apologetics'', Eugene: Wipf &amp; Stock, 1999, pp. 22-58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.K.S.Reid, ''Christian Apologetics'', Grand Rapids: William Eerdmans, 1970, pp. 36-53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bengt Hagglund, ''History of Theology'', trans. Gene J. Lund, St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1968, pp.31-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Protestant traditions some of the earliest writings opposing unorthodox groups like Swedenborg's teachings, can be traced back to [[John Wesley]], [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]] and [[Princeton Theological Seminary|Princeton]] theologians like [[Charles Hodge]] and [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard G. Kyle]], ''The Religious Fringe: A History of Alternative Religions in America'', Downers Grove: IVP, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Jenkins, ''Mystics and Messiahs: Cults and New Religions in American History'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The first known usage of the term &quot;cult&quot; by a Protestant apologist to denote a group is heretical or unorthodox is in ''Anti-Christian Cults'' by A. H. Barrington, published in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;A.H.Barrington, ''Anti-Christian Cults'', Milwaukee:Young Churchman/London:Sampson Low, Marston, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quite a few of the pioneering apologists were [[Baptist]] pastors, like I. M. Haldeman, or participants in the [[Plymouth Brethren]], like [[William Irvine (Scottish evangelist)|William Irvine]] and Sydney Watson.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gordon Melton,&quot;The counter-cult monitoring movement in historical perspective,&quot; in ''Challenging Religion: Essays in Honour of Eileen Barker'', edited by James A. Beckford &amp; James T. Richardson, Routledge, London, 2003, pp. 102–113.&lt;/ref&gt; Watson wrote a series of didactic novels like ''Escaped from the Snare: Christian Science'',&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Watson, ''Escaped from the Snare: Christian Science'', London:William Nichoson &amp; Sons, no date.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bewitched by  [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Watson, The ''Lure of a Soul: Bewitched by Spiritualism'', London: W. Nicholson &amp; Sons, no date.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Gilded Lie'', as warnings of the dangers posed by cultic groups. Watson's use of fiction to counter the cults has been repeated by later novelists like [[Frank Peretti]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Peretti, ''This Present Darkness'', Westchester: Crossway,1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James R. Lewis, &quot;Works of Darkness: Occult Fascination in the Novels of Frank Peretti&quot; in ''Magical Religion and Modern Witchcraft'', James R. Lewis ed. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1996, pp.339-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early twentieth century apologists generally applied the words &quot;[[Christian heresy|heresy]]&quot; and &quot;[[sect]]s&quot; to groups like the [[Christadelphians]], [[Mormonism|Mormons]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualist]]s, and [[Theosophy|Theosophers]]. This was reflected in several chapters contributed to the multi-volume work released in 1915 ''The Fundamentals'', where apologists criticised the teachings of [[Charles Taze Russell]], [[Mary Baker Eddy]] ([[Christian Science]]), the [[Mormons]] and [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualists]].&lt;ref&gt;William G. Moorehead, ‘Millennial Dawn A Counterfeit of Christianity’, in ''The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth'', Volume 7. Chicago: Testimony Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurice E. Wilson, ‘Eddyism, Commonly Called “Christian Science”, in ''The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth'', Volume 9. Chicago: Testimony Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. G. McNiece, ‘Mormonism: Its Origin, Characteristics, and Doctrines’, in ''The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth'', Volume 8. Chicago: Testimony Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Algernon J. Pollock]], ‘Modern Spiritualism Briefly Tested By Scripture’, in ''The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth'', Volume 10. Chicago: Testimony Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid twentieth century apologists===
Since at least the 1940s, the approach of traditional Christians was to apply the meaning of ''cult'' such that it included those religious groups who use other scriptures beside the Bible or have teachings and practices deviating from traditional Christian teachings and practices. Some examples of sources (with published dates where known) that documented this approach are:

*''The Missionary Faces Isms'', by John C. Mattes, pub. 1937 (Board of American Missions of the [[United Lutheran Church in America]]).		
*''Heresies Ancient and Modern'', by J.Oswald Sanders, pub.1948 (Marshall Morgan &amp; Scott, London/Zondervan, Grand Rapids).	
*''Cults and Isms'', by [[J. Oswald Sanders]], pub.1962, 1969, 1980 (Arrowsmith), ISBN 0-551-00458-4.	
*''The Chaos of Cults'', by J.K.van Baalen, pub. 1938, 1944, 1960, 1962 (Eerdmans)ISBN 0-8028-3278-4	
*''Heresies Exposed'', by W.C.Irvine, pub. 1921, 1975 (Loizeaux Brothers).	
*''Confusion of Tongues'', by C.W.Ferguson, pub. 1928 (Doran &amp; Co).	
*''Isms New and Old'', by Julius Bodensieck.	
*''Some Latter-Day Religions'', by G.H.Combs.

One of the first prominent countercult apologists was [[Jan Karel van Baalen]] (1890–1968), an ordained minister in the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]]. His book, ''The Chaos of Cults'', which was first published in 1938, became a classic in the field as it was repeatedly revised and updated until 1962.&lt;ref&gt;J.K.van Baalen, ''The Chaos of Cults'', 4th rev.ed.Grand Rapids: William Eerdmans Publishing, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walter Martin===
Historically, one of the most important protagonists of the movement was [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]] (1928–89), whose numerous books include the 1955 ''The Rise of the Cults: An Introductory Guide to the Non-Christian Cults'' and the 1965 ''The Kingdom of the Cults: An Analysis of Major Cult Systems in the Present Christian Era'', which continues to be influential. He became well known in conservative Christian circles through a radio program, &quot;The Bible Answer Man&quot;, currently hosted by [[Hank Hanegraaff]].

In ''The Rise of the Cults''&lt;ref&gt;Walter R. Martin, ''The Rise of the Cults'', Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1955, pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin gave the following definition of a cult:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By cultism we mean the adherence to doctrines which are pointedly contradictory to orthodox Christianity and which yet claim the distinction of either tracing their origin to orthodox sources or of being in essential harmony with those sources. Cultism, in short, is any major deviation from orthodox Christianity relative to the cardinal doctrines of the Christian faith.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Martin's definition suggests, the countercult ministries concentrate on non-traditional groups that claim to be Christian, so chief targets have been [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Church of Christ, Scientist|Christian Science]] and the [[Unification Church]], but also smaller groups like the [[Swedenborgian Church]]&lt;ref&gt;Each of these movements are treated in separate chapters in Walter R. Martin, ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', rev. ed. Ravi Zacharias ed. Bloomington: Bethany House, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other conservative Christian leaders—among them [[John Ankerberg]] and [[Norman Geisler]]—have emphasized themes similar to Martin's.&lt;ref&gt;John Ankerberg &amp; John Weldon, ''Cult Watch'',Eugene: Harvest House, 1991, pp. i-x.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geisler &amp; Rhodes, ''When Cultists Ask'', pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps more importantly, numerous other well-known conservative Christian leaders as well as many conservative pastors have accepted Martin's definition of a cult as well as his understanding of the groups to which he gave that label. Dave Breese&lt;ref&gt;Dave Breese, ''Know the Marks of Cults'', Wheaton: Victor, 1975, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; summed up this kind of definition&lt;ref&gt;Compare this definition with ''[[Christian heresy|heresy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in these words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A cult is a religious perversion. It is a belief and practice in the world of religion which calls for devotion to a religious view or leader centered in false doctrine. It is an organized heresy. A cult may take many forms but it is basically a religious movement which distorts or warps orthodox faith to the point where truth becomes perverted into a lie. A cult is impossible to define except against the absolute standard of the teaching of Holy Scripture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other technical terminology==
Since the 1980s the term &quot;new religions&quot; or &quot;[[new religious movements]]&quot; has slowly entered into Evangelical usage, alongside the word &quot;cult&quot;. Some book titles use both terms.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Abanes, ''Cults, New Religious Movements, and Your Family'', Wheaton: Crossway, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Enroth ed. ''A Guide to New Religious Movements'', Downers Grove: IVP, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ron Rhodes, ''The Challenge of the Cults and New Religions'', Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The acceptance of these alternatives to the word &quot;cult&quot; in Evangelicalism reflects, in part, the wider usage of such language in the [[sociology of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;On sociological understandings see for example Eileen Barker, ''New Religious Movements: A Practical Introduction'', London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1989. George D. Chryssides, ''Exploring New Religions'', London &amp; New York: Cassell, 1999.Jacob Needleman &amp; George Baker ed. ''Understanding the New Religions'', New York: Seabury Press, 1981. Mikael Rothstein &amp; Reender Kranenborg ed. ''New Religions in a Postmodern World'', Aarhus, Denmark: Aargus University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no unanimity about whether these terms are synonyms.

==Apologetics==
The term &quot;countercult [[apologetic]]s&quot; first appeared in Protestant Evangelical literature as a self-designation in the late 1970s and early 1980s in articles by [[Ronald Enroth]] and David Fetcho, and by Walter Martin in ''Martin Speaks Out on the Cults''.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald M.

Cowan|Douglas Cowan]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas E. Cowan, ''Bearing False Witness? An Introduction ot the Christian Countercult'', Westport: Praeger, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only existing umbrella organization within the countercult movement in the USA is the [[EMNR]] (Evangelical Ministries to New Religions) founded in 1982 which has the evangelical [[Lausanne Covenant]] as governing document and which stresses mission, scholarship, accountability and networking.

==Worldwide organizations==
While the greatest number of countercult ministries are found in the USA, ministries exist in [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Philippines]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]],  [[Sweden]], and [[Ukraine]]. A comparison between the methods employed in the USA and other nations discloses some similarities in emphasis, but also other nuances in emphasis. The similarities are that globally these ministries share a common concern about the evangelization of people in cults and new religions. There is also often a common thread of comparing orthodox doctrines and biblical passages with the teachings of the groups under examination. However, in some of the European and southern hemisphere contexts, confrontational methods of engagement are not always relied on, and dialogical approaches are sometimes advocated.

A group of organizations which originated within the context of established religion is working in more general fields of cult-awareness, especially in Europe. Their leaders are theologians, and they are often social ministries affiliated to big churches.

===Independent===
Some independents like the international [[Dialog Center]], and Anton Hein's Apologetics Index &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apologeticsindex.org/ Apologetics Index : Apologetics and Cult Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in Amsterdam are Evangelical Christians. Hein considers [[Scientology]] a hate group because that religious movement has, in his opinion, a long, documented history of hate and harassment activities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apologeticsindex.org/s04f.html Hate Groups : Church of Scientology - Examining the cult's hate and harassment practices&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which—along with lying and deception—are condoned and encouraged in Scientology's own scriptures. (See, for example, Scientology's [[Fair Game (Scientology)|Fair Game]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apologeticsindex.org/f08.html Scientology's '&amp;#39;Fair Game'&amp;#39; Policy - religious cults, sects and movements&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; policy.)

The members of this group are less concerned with doctrine and focus more on practices and methods, mainly targeting  groups who, in their view, limit the freedom and self-determinism of their members or exploit them. Special concerns are [[Scientology]], [[Unification church]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], VPM, but also some Europe-based NMRs and some fundamentalist charismatic groups.

==Contextual missiology==
The phenomena of &quot;cults&quot; has also entered into the discourses of Christian missions and theology of religions. An initial step in this direction occurred in 1980 when the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization convened a mini-consultation in Thailand. From that consultation a position paper was produced.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.lausanne.org/Brix?pageID=14647 The Thailand Report on New Religious Movements]''&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was revisited at the Lausanne Forum in 2004 with another paper.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.lausanne.org/lcwe/assets/LOP45_IG16.pdf Religious and Non-Religious Spirituality in the Western World]''&lt;/ref&gt; The latter paper adopts a different methodology to that advocated in 1980.

In the 1990s discussions in academic missions and theological journals indicate that another trajectory is emerging which reflects the influence of contextual missions theory. Advocates of this approach maintain that apologetics as a tool needs to be retained, but do not favour a confrontational style of engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Hexham, Stephen Rost &amp; John W. Morehead ed. ''Encountering New Religious Movements: A Holistic Evangelical Approach'', Grand Rapids: Kregel, 2004.Gordon R. Lewis, &quot;Our Mission Responsibility to New Religious Movements&quot; ''International Journal of Frontier Missions'' Volume 15, number 3 July–September 1998,p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations and models==
Countercult apologetics has several variations and methods employed in analysing and responding to cults. The different nuances in countercult apologetics have been discussed by [[John A. Saliba]] and Philip Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Saliba, ''Understanding New Religious Movements'', pp.212-223. Philip Johnson, &quot;Apologetics, Mission and New Religious Movements: A Holistic Approach,&quot; ''Sacred Tribes Journal'', Volume 1, number 1 Fall 2002 5-220.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant method is the emphasis on detecting unorthodox or heretical doctrines and contrasting those with orthodox interpretations of the Bible and early creedal documents. Some apologists, such as [[Francis J. Beckwith]], have emphasised a philosophical approach, pointing out logical, [[epistemological]] and metaphysical problems within the teachings of a particular group.&lt;ref&gt;Francis J. Beckwith &amp; Stephen E. Parrish, ''See the gods fall'', Joplin: College Press, 1997. Francis J. Beckwith, Carl Mosser &amp; Paul Owen ed. ''The New Mormon Challenge'', Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach involves former members of cultic groups recounting their spiritual autobiographies, which highlight experiences of disenchantment with the group, unanswered questions and doubts about commitment to the group, culminating in the person's conversion to Evangelical Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Adair &amp; Ted Miller ed. ''Escape from Darkness'', Wheaton: Victor, 1982.Chris Elkins, ''Heavenly Deception'', Wheaton: Tyndale House, 1980. Joe Hewitt, ''I Was Raised a Jehovah's Witness'', Denver: Accent Books, 1979. Latayne C. Scott, ''Ex-Mormons: Why We Left'', Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pop apologists like [[Dave Hunt]] in ''Peace, Prosperity and the Coming Holocaust'' and [[Hal Lindsey]] in ''The Terminal Generation'' have tended to interpret the phenomena of cults as part of the burgeoning evidence of signs that Christ's Second Advent is close at hand.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Hunt, ''Peace, Prosperity and the Coming Holocaust: The New Age Movement in Prophecy'', Eugene: Harvest House, 1983. Hal Lindsey, ''The Terminal Generation'', Old Tappan: Fleming H. Revell, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hunt, and [[Constance Cumbey]], have applied a conspiracy model to interpreting the emergence of New Age spirituality and linking that to speculations about fulfilled prophecies heralding Christ's reappearance.&lt;ref&gt;Constance E. Cumbey, ''The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow'', Shreveport: Huntington House, 1983. Evaluated in Elliot Miller, ''A Crash Course on the New Age Movement'', Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1989, pp. 193-206. John A. Saliba, ''Christian Responses to the New Age Movement: A Critical Assessment'', London: Geoffrey Chapman, 1999, pp.58-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other apologists like [[Bob Larson]] blend an understanding of cults as heresies with a strongly nuanced emphasis on Satan as the energizing power behind the growth of cults.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Larson, ''Larson’s Book of Cults'', Wheaton: Tyndale House, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; This theme has been portrayed in the anti-New Age novels by [[Frank Peretti]] (''This Present Darkness'' and ''Piercing the Darkness'') where demonic forces empower practitioners of New Age groups while Christians engage in spiritual warfare tactics of prayer and exorcisms to counter the groups.

Today there exist many and very diverse countercult ministries and authors, including everything between scholars and soapbox preachers, and there is no overall agreement regarding which groups are part of traditional Christianity.

Some Protestants classify [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Churches|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] or [[Pentecostal]] churches as cults, because they allegedly have non-Biblical teachings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Others speak out mainly against current non-Christian groups or trends in society like the [[New Age]] movement, the popularity of [[Harry Potter]] books or [[Halloween]].

Some ministries, often led by former members, target single groups like Jehovah's Witnesses or [[Mormon]]s.

Some of the criticisms of contemporary &quot;cults&quot; (heterodoxy, breaking up families, etc.) were, in its early days, originally directed against Christianity itself.

'''Professor Charles Francis Xavier''', also known as '''Professor X''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] known as the leader and founder of the [[X-Men]].

Throughout most of his [[comic book]] history, Xavier is [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]], although his body houses one of the world's most powerful [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] minds. As a high-level [[telepath]], Xavier can read, control and influence human minds. A [[science|scientific]] [[genius]], he is also a leading authority on [[genetics]], [[mutation]], and [[psionics|psionic powers]].

[[Patrick Stewart]] has portrayed Professor X throughout the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]], and the ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' games. Actor [[James McAvoy]] will portray the character in the upcoming 2011 superhero film, ''[[X-Men: First Class (film)|X-Men: First Class]]''.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], the Professor first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 (September 1963).

===Inspirations===
Professor Xavier's character development has been inspired by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = DeCandido, Keith R.A., Haber, Karen, Wein, Len | year = 2006 | month = April 1 | title = The Unauthorized X-Men: SF and Comic Writers on Mutants, Prejudice, and Adamantium (p. 142) | publisher = Benbella Books | isbn = 1-932-10074-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Scott Lobdell]] established Xavier's middle name to be Francis in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #328 (January 1996).

Stan Lee has stated that the physical inspiration of Professor Xavier was from Academy Award–winning actor [[Yul Brynner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stan Lee: Conversations&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=zLmB3GprtboC&amp;dq=Yul+Brynner+Professor+X+Stan+Lee&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Stan Lee: Conversations] {{cite book | author = Lee, Stan, McLaughlin, Jeff | year = 2007 | title = Stan Lee: Conversations (p. 170) | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | isbn = 978-1-57806-984-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Character===
Xavier’s goals are to promote the peaceful affirmation of mutant rights, to mediate the co-existence of mutants and humans, to protect mutants from militant humans and to protect society from antagonistic mutants, including his old friend, the militant [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. To achieve these aims, he founded Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters (later named the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]]) to teach mutants to explore and control their powers. Its first group of students were the original X-Men. Xavier's students consider him a visionary and often refer to their mission as &quot;Xavier's dream&quot;. He is highly regarded by others in the Marvel [[universe]], respected by various governments and trusted by several other superhero teams, including the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]. However, he also has a manipulative streak which has resulted in several significant fallings-out with allies and students.

He often acts as a public advocate for mutant rights and is the authority most of the Marvel superhero community turns to for advice on mutants. Despite this, his status as a mutant himself and leader of the X-Men has only recently become public.

In the comics' history, the X-Men rarely operate without Xavier. He also appears in almost all of the X-Men animated series and in many video games, although usually as a [[non-playable character]] because of his disability. [[Patrick Stewart]] plays him in the 2000s [[X-Men (film)|film series]], as well as providing his voice in some of the X-Men videogames (including some not connected to the film series).

According to ''[[BusinessWeek]]'', Charles Xavier is listed as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional characters in American comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Pisani | first = Joseph | authorlink = Joseph Pisani | title = The Smartest Superheroes | publisher = www.businessweek.com | year = 2006 | url = http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/05/smart_heroes/index_01.htm | accessdate = 2007-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark Xavier===
[[Image:Darkxavier18.jpg‎|thumb|The '''Dark side''' of Xavier emerging.&lt;br&gt;Art by [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]] &amp; [[Dave Cockrum]].]]
In a number of comics, especially more so in recent years, Xavier is shown to have a dark side, a part of himself that he struggles to suppress. Perhaps the most notable appearance of this character element is in the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] storyline, in which the [[crossover (comics)|crossover]] event's antagonist is a physical manifestation of that dark side. Also, Onslaught is created in the most violent act Xavier claims to have done: erasing the mind of Magneto. In ''X-Men'' &lt;!-- only denote volume number after first --&gt; #106 (August 1977), the new X-Men fight images of the original team, which have been created by what Xavier says is his &quot;evil self ... who would use his powers for personal gain and conquest,&quot; which he says he is normally able to keep in check. In the 1984 four-part series titled ''The X-Men and the Micronauts'', Xavier's dark desires manifest themselves as the Entity and threaten to destroy the Micronauts' universe.

In other instances, Xavier is shown to be secretive and manipulative. During the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] storyline, the X-Men find Xavier's files, the &quot;[[Xavier Protocols]]&quot;, which detail how to kill many of the characters, including Xavier himself, should the need ever arise, such as if they went rogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Scott Lobdell]] | Penciller = [[Joe Madureira]] | Inker = [[Tim Townsend]] | Story = &quot;Onslaught, Phase 1: Apocalypse Lives&quot; | Title = Uncanny X-Men | Volume = | Issue = 335 |date=August 1996|Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' vol. 3, #12 (August 2005) reveals that when Xavier realizes that the [[Danger Room]] has become sentient, he keeps it trapped and experiments on it for years, an act that Cyclops calls &quot;the oppression of a new life&quot; and equates to humanity's treatment of mutants. (However, X-Men Legacy #220 - 224 reveals that Xavier did not intend for the Danger Room to become sentient: it was an accident, and Xavier sought a way to free Danger, but was unable to find a way to accomplish this without deleting her sentience as well.)

In ''[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]'' #6, a de-powered Xavier is forced to admit that he had sent a group of hastily trained young mutants to [[Krakoa]] to save the original X-Men, resulting in their deaths. Because one of the mutants is [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]' brother [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], Xavier erased Cyclops' memory of the event. He further manipulated the rescue team of new X-Men by making them think the meaningless noises the island made were intelligible speech—evidence that the island was alive—to match the new memories he had given Cyclops. It has also been revealed that he lied to [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] in an attempt to protect her from evil influences, and that for years he told her he could eventually help her control her abilities, when this was not the case.

Xavier has multiple secrets that he hides from the X-Men beyond the Krakoa and Danger incidents. Since the inception of the X-Men, he has created and maintained a network of mutant espionage agents to work in dealings that are too dubious for the public eye of the X-Men, even entrapping [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] into helping him (even though she killed his dear friend, [[Moira MacTaggert]]). The mutant [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] was recruited at the same point as the original X-Men, however, Xavier forced Tessa into a role as a spy within the Hellfire Club, seeing his team as heroes and Tessa's only ability &quot;the capacity to betray&quot;. He has also been part of the secret [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] society responsible for shooting [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]] into space.

In the ''[[Mutant X]]'' comic book series, set outside the Marvel Universe continuity, Xavier travels the world capturing telepaths for the purpose of stealing their mental energy. Xavier takes control of S.H.I.E.L.D., captures Gambit's daughter, and attempts to kill the X-Men with a nuclear strike. An alternate-reality version of Xavier is the enemy in the first story arc of the ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' series. In ''Ultimate X-Men'', Xavier frequently lies to other characters, including the X-Men, or even manipulates them when he feels it is necessary. Xavier tells the American president that he has killed Magneto, but instead he has blocked Magneto's memories and created a new personality and memories for him, along with a new life working with mentally challenged children. In issue #65, unbeknownst to the rest of the team, he directs Angel to become his mole in Emma Frost's Academy of Tomorrow in the guise of expelling the student. In ''Ultimate X-Men'' #58, he defuses a hostage situation by hiring the mutant bank robbers for a mission in which the X-Men cannot be implicated, and making the police believe they have killed them.

===Romantic interests===
A brilliant student intent on undertaking graduate studies, Xavier was admitted into England's Oxford University, where he studied at Pembroke College. It was in Oxford where he met and fell in love with a young Scot named [[Moira MacTaggert|Moira Kinross]] with a mind that would match his own. Their passionate discussions on genetic mutation gave way to an equally passionate romance. They planned to be married, but after finishing his work at Oxford, Xavier was drafted and sent to Asia. It has been hinted that Mister Sinister interfered with Moira's and Xavier's relationship as he is posing as a professor at Oxford at the time. Deeply depressed when Moira broke off their engagement without explanation, Xavier began traveling abroad after leaving the army.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} He later discovered that Moira married her old boyfriend Joseph MacTaggert, who abused her. He eventually renewed his friendship with Moira MacTaggert, who is now a renowned geneticist, and they began discussing the idea of founding a school for mutants.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} Charles' ex-fiancée has become a lifetime friend who interacts with the X-Men often. He nearly followed her to death to be with her when she was fatally injured.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

Xavier went to [[Haifa]], Israel, where he fell in love with [[Gabrielle Haller]], a catatonic Holocaust victim he forced back to awareness. Xavier and Haller were unaware when he left Israel that she was pregnant with his son, who would become the mentally ill mutant known as [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]]. They separated on good terms.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

American nurse [[Amelia Voght]] helped him recover from his debilitating injuries from his assault by [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)|Lucifer]] in India. She made cheering him up in the hospital her pet project. They lived together both in Bombay and Westchester, but she then left as Xavier gathered students. Xavier felt he failed her, and in a passing &quot;maddened panic&quot; tried to force her to stay, with her feeling betrayed. He encountered her again as an Acolyte of Magneto, and eventually she saved his life.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

Charles became romantically interested in Teri Martin, the mother of a young mutant girl he was trying to help, after the Z'Nox incident, but he decided that he had no room for romance at the time.&lt;ref&gt;(''X-Men: Hidden Years'' #1-22)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shi'ar]] Princess-Majestrix [[Lilandra]] formed an intense psychic bond with Xavier across the vast distance that separates their two planets, which led her to him after she fled her Empire, in search of help against her villainous brother. Xavier dreamt of her and Lilandra knew they were soul mates. They fell in love at first sight. Later, he helped overthrow her sister in order to return the throne to Lilandra. They were wed until the Shi'ar Counsel annulled their marriage on the grounds that involvement with Xavier has caused trouble for the Empire. However, as seen in the recent ''Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire'' storyline, Lilandra still loves him, despite their troubles. No child has resulted from the union in the canon universe (he and Lilandra do have a child together in ''X-Men: The End''). Charles is currently unaware of Lilandra's assassination during ''War of Kings''.&lt;ref&gt;''War of Kings'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

In one instance in the start of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' (issue #3), Professor X privately reflects upon his love for [[Jean Grey]], but does not pursue it due to his feeling inadequate about being in a wheelchair, and the age difference and sacredness of the teacher-student relationship.&lt;ref&gt;X-Men [1st series]: 1&amp;ndash;6, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Although Xavier never again displays a romantic interest in Jean, the idea that he once entertained this thought becomes one of his &quot;dark secrets&quot; and is revisited when the Professor's dark side manifests in the form of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] and reveals it to Jean. There is debate{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}, however, that it is more of a loving father-figure relationship, as Professor X has known Jean from the age of 11.{{Or|date=November 2008}} He also loves her in ''Ultimate X-Men'' as it is said in the ''Phoenix'' arc and in the ''Cable'' arc.

==Fictional character biography==
{{Plot|date=January 2008}}

===Origin===
Charles Francis Xavier was born in [[New York City]] to the wealthy Brian Xavier, a well-respected [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] scientist, and Sharon Xavier. After Brian dies in an accident, his science partner Kurt Marko comforts and marries the grieving Sharon. When Xavier's telepathic mutant powers emerge, he discovers Kurt cares only about his mother's money.
[[Image:Profxy.PNG|240px|A young Charles Xavier. Art by Jack Kirby.|thumb|left]]

After the wedding, Kurt moves in with the Xaviers, bringing with him his son [[Juggernaut (comics)|Cain]]. Kurt quickly grows neglectful of Sharon, driving her to alcoholism, and abuses both Charles and Cain. Cain takes out his frustrations and insecurities on his stepbrother. Charles uses his telepathic powers to read Cain's mind and explore the extent of his psychological damage, which only leads to Cain becoming more aggressive toward him and the young Xavier feeling Cain's pain firsthand.

Sharon dies soon after, and a fight erupts between Cain and Charles that causes some of Kurt's lab equipment to explode. Mortally wounded, Kurt drags the two children out before dying.&lt;ref name = &quot;shfajr&quot;&gt;''[Uncanny] X-Men'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[Uncanny] X-Men'' #38-42&lt;/ref&gt;

With help from his powers and his natural genius, Xavier becomes an excellent student and athlete, though he gives up the latter, believing his powers give him an unfair advantage. Due to his powers, by the time he graduates high school, Charles loses all of his hair. He graduates with [[Latin honors|honors]] at the age of 16 from [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur: Prelude to the House of M'' #11-14&lt;/ref&gt; In graduate studies he receives [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]s in [[Genetics]], [[Biophysics]], and [[Psychology]]&lt;ref name = &quot;ydnsmw&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Yaco, Linc, Haber, Karen | year = 2004 | month = February | title = The Science of the X-Men | page = 24 | publisher = I Books/Marvel | isbn = 0-743-48725-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a two year residence at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name = &quot;xkhfzr&quot;&gt;''[Uncanny] X-Men'' #117&lt;/ref&gt; He is later appointed [[Adjunct Professor]] at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name = &quot;xaqplc&quot;&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #192-193&lt;/ref&gt; ''Origins of Marvel Comics: X-Men'' #1 (2010) presents a different version of events, suggesting a scholarship to Oxford University rescued him from his abusive home, after which he &quot;never looked back&quot;, suggesting he began his academic career as a very young man at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;''Origins of Marvel Comics: X-Men'' #1. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[graduate school]], he meets a [[Scotland|Scottish]] girl named [[Moira MacTaggert|Moira Kinross]], a fellow genetics student with whom he falls in love. The two agree to get married, but soon, Xavier is drafted into the [[Korean War]]. He carves himself a niche as a soldier in search and rescue missions alongside [[Shadowcat (comics)|Shadowcat's]] father, Carmen Pryde,&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' vol. 3 #11-14&lt;/ref&gt; and witnesses Cain's transformation into [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. During the war, he receives a letter from Moira telling him that she is breaking up with him. He later discovers that Moira married her old boyfriend Joseph MacTaggert, who abuses her.&lt;ref name = &quot;shfajr&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;xkhfzr&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #389&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traveling after the army===
Deeply depressed when Moira broke off their engagement without explanation, Xavier began traveling around the world as an adventurer after leaving the army. In [[Cairo]], he meets a young girl named [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]] (later known as Storm), who is a pickpocket, and the [[Shadow King]], a powerful mutant who is posing as Egyptian crime lord Amahl Farouk. Xavier defeats the Shadow King, barely escaping with his life. This encounter leads to Xavier's decision to devote his life to protecting humanity from evil mutants and safeguarding innocent mutants from human oppression.&lt;ref name = &quot;xkhfzr&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Xavmags.png|170px|thumb|Xavier and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] part ways due to the differences in their beliefs on how to help mutants. Art by [[Carlos Pacheco]].]]

===Meeting Magneto===
Xavier visits his friend Daniel Shomron, who runs a clinic for traumatized [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] victims in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]]. There, he meets Erik Lehnsherr (who would later become [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]), a Holocaust survivor who works as a volunteer in the clinic, and [[Gabrielle Haller]], a woman driven into a catatonic coma by the trauma she experienced. Xavier uses his mental powers to break her out of her catatonia and the two fall in love. Xavier and Magneto become good friends, although neither immediately reveals to the other that he is a mutant. The two hold lengthy debates hypothesizing what will happen if humanity is faced with a new super-powered race of humans. While Xavier is optimistic, Magneto's experiences in the Holocaust lead him to believe that humanity will ultimately oppress the new race of humans as they have done with other minorities. The two friends reveal their powers to each other when they fight Nazi [[Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] and his [[HYDRA]] agents, who kidnap Gabrielle because she knows the location of their secret cache of gold. Magneto attempts to kill Strucker but Xavier stops him. Realizing that his and Xavier's views on mutant-human relations are incompatible, Magneto leaves with the gold. Charles stays in Israel for some time, but he and Gabrielle separate on good terms, neither knowing that she is pregnant with his son, who grows up to become the mutant [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #161, 321&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lucifer===
In a strange town near the Himalayas, Xavier encounters an alien calling himself [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)|Lucifer]], the advance scout for an invasion by his race, and foils his plans. In retaliation, Lucifer drops a huge stone block on Xavier, crippling his legs.&lt;ref&gt;''[Uncanny] X-Men'' #20&lt;/ref&gt; After Lucifer leaves, a young woman named [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] hears Xavier's telepathic cries for help and rescues him, bringing him to safety, beginning a long alliance between the two.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Treme X-Men'' #44&lt;/ref&gt;

In a hospital in [[India]] he is brought to an American nurse, [[Amelia Voght]], who looks after him and, as she sees to his recovery, they fall in love. When he is released from the hospital the two move into an apartment in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] together. Amelia is troubled to find Charles studying mutation, as she is a mutant and unsettled by it, though she calms when he reveals himself to be a mutant as well. They eventually move to the [[United States]], living on Xavier's family estate. But the night [[Scott Summers]] moves into Xavier's mansion, Amelia leaves him, believing Charles would have changed his view and that mutants should lie low. Yet he is recruiting them to what she believes is a lost cause. Charles tries to force her to stay with his mental powers, but immediately ashamed by this, lets her go. She later becomes a disciple of Magneto.&lt;ref&gt;''[Uncanny] X-Men'' #39-42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;idwhkk&quot;&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #309&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;cgvzxf&quot;&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 2 #25&lt;/ref&gt;

===The X-Men===
Over the years, Charles makes a name for himself as geneticist and psychologist, apparently renowned enough that the Greys were referred to him when no other expert could help their [[catatonic]] daughter, [[Jean Grey|Jean]]. Xavier trains her in the use of her [[telekinesis]], while inhibiting her [[telepathy|telepathic]] abilities until she matures.&lt;ref&gt;''Bizarre Adventures'' #27&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, he also starts working with fellow mutation expert, [[Karl Lykos]], as well as Moira MacTaggert again, who built a mutant research station on [[Muir Island]]. Apparently, Charles had gotten over Moira in his travels to the [[Greeks|Greek]] island of Kirinos.&lt;ref name = &quot;xkhfzr&quot;/&gt; Xavier discusses his candidates for recruitment to his personal strike force, the X-Men, with Moira, including those he passes over, which are [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]], [[Piotr Rasputin]], [[Pietro Maximoff|Pietro]] and [[Wanda Maximoff]], and [[Ororo Munroe]]. Xavier also trains [[Sage (comics)|Tessa]] in order to spy on [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]].&lt;ref&gt;''Professor Xavier and the X-Men'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #300&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''X-Treme X-Men'' #3, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Xavier founded Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, which provides a safe haven for mutants and teaches them to master their abilities. In addition, he seeks to foster mutant-human relations by providing his superhero team, the X-Men, as an example of mutants acting in good faith, as he told [[FBI]] agent [[Fred Duncan (comics)|Fred Duncan]].&lt;ref&gt;''[Uncanny] X-Men'' #38&lt;/ref&gt; With his inherited fortune, he uses his [[X-Mansion|ancestral mansion]] at 1407 Graymalkin Lane in [[Salem Center]], [[Westchester County]], [[New York]] as a base of operations with technologically advanced facilities, including the [[Danger Room]] - later, [[Fantomex]] mentions that Xavier is a billionaire with a net worth of 3.5 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #129&lt;/ref&gt; Presenting the image of a stern teacher, Xavier makes his students endure a rigorous training regime.&lt;ref&gt;''[Uncanny] X-Men'' #1-6, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Xavier's first five students are [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], who become the original X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''[Uncanny] X-Men'' #46, 56, 53&lt;/ref&gt; After he completes recruiting the original team of X-Men, he sends them into battle with Magneto.&lt;ref&gt;''[Uncanny] X-Men''#1&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout most of his time with the team, Xavier uses his telepathic powers to keep in constant contact with his students and provides instructions and advice when needed. In addition, he uses a special machine called [[Cerebro]], which enhances his ability to detect mutants and to allow the team to find new students in need of the school.&lt;ref&gt;''[Uncanny] X-Men'' #1-7, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the obstacles Xavier faces is his old friend, Magneto, who has grown into an advocate of mutant superiority since their last encounter and who believes the only solution to mutant persecution is domination over humanity.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' # minus 1&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[anthropologist]] [[Bolivar Trask]] resurfaces the &quot;mutant problem&quot;, Xavier counters him in a televised debate, however, he appears arrogant and Trask sends his mutant-hunting robot [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] to terrorize mutants. The X-Men dispatch them, but Trask sees the error in his ways too late as he is killed by his creations.&lt;ref&gt;''[Uncanny] X-Men'' #14-16&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, Xavier seemingly dies during the X-Men's battle with the sub-human [[Grotesk (comics)|Grotesk]], but it is later revealed that Xavier arranged for a reformed former villain named [[Changeling (Marvel Comics)|Changeling]] to impersonate him while he went into hiding to plan a defense against an invasion by the extraterrestrial Z'Nox, imparting a portion of his telepathic abilities to the Changeling to complete the disguise.&lt;ref&gt;''[Uncanny] X-Men'' #41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deadly Genesis X-Men===
When the X-Men are captured by the [[Sentience|sentient]] island [[Krakoa]], Xavier assembles a new team to rescue them, including Cyclops' and Havok's long-lost brother, [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Deadly Genesis #1-5&quot;&gt;''[[Deadly Genesis]]'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], among others. This new team, composed of students of [[Moira MacTaggert|Dr. Moira MacTaggert]], was sent to rescue the original X-Men from Krakoa. However, after rescuing Cyclops, McTaggert's former students were seemingly killed. Upon Cyclops' return, Xavier removed Cyclops' memories of the death of Vulcan and his teammates, and began assembling yet another team of X-Men.

===New Team and Shi'ar===
Xavier's subsequent rescue team consists of [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], and [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]]. After the mission, the older team of X-Men, except for Cyclops, leave the school, believing they no longer belong there, and Xavier mentors the new X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''Giant Size X-Men'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[Uncanny] X-Men'' #94-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Xavier forms a psychic bond across galaxies with Princess [[Lilandra]] from the [[Shi'ar]] Empire. When they finally meet, it is love at first sight. She implores the professor to stop her mad brother, Shi'ar Emperor [[D'Ken]], and he instantly aids her by deploying his X-Men. When Jean Grey returns from the Savage Land to tell him that all the X-Men are dead, he shuts down the school and travels with Lilandra to her kingdom, where she is crowned Empress and he is treated like a child or a trophy husband.&lt;ref&gt;''[Uncanny] X-Men'' #105-109, 114, 117-118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Classic X-Men'' #31&lt;/ref&gt;

Xavier senses the changes taking place in Jean Grey, and returns to Earth to help and resume leadership of the X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #129&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter he battles his pupil after she becomes [[Dark Phoenix]] and destroys a populated planet in the Shi'ar Empire. It hurts Xavier to be on the opposite side of Lilandra, but he has no other choice but to challenge the Shi'ar Imperial Guard to a duel over the fate of the Phoenix. Xavier would have lost against the greater power of the Dark Phoenix, but thanks to the help Jean Grey gives him (fighting her Phoenix persona), Xavier emerges victorious; she later commits suicide in order to prevent herself from endangering more innocent lives.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #129; ''See [[Dark Phoenix Saga]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Xavierwalk.png|250px|thumb|Xavier walks again. Art by [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]] and Bob Wiacek.]]

===The Brood===
When the X-Men fight members of the extraterrestrial race known as the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]], Xavier is captured by them, and implanted with a Brood egg, which places Xavier under the Brood's control. During this time, Xavier assembles a team of younger mutants called the [[New Mutants]], secretly intended to be prime hosts for reproduction of the aliens. The X-Men discover this and return to free Xavier, but they are too late to prevent his body from being destroyed with a Brood Queen in its place; however, his soul remains intact. The X-Men and [[Starjammers]] subdue this monstrous creature containing Xavier's essence, but the only way to restore him is to clone a new body using tissue samples he donated to the Starjammers and transfer his consciousness into the clone body. This new body possesses functional legs, though the [[psychosomatic]] pain Xavier experienced after living so long as a paraplegic takes some time to subside. Subsequently, he even joins the X-Men in the field, but later decides not to continue this practice after realizing that his place is at the school, as the teacher of the New Mutants.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #154–158, 161, 167, 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' #1–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Wars'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;

===More injuries===
After taking a teaching position at [[Columbia University]] in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #192, Xavier is severely injured and left for dead as the victim of a [[hate crime]]. [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] and her [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], a group of underground-dwelling mutants, get him to safety. One of the Morlocks partially restores Xavier's health, but Callisto warns Xavier that he isn't fully healed and that he must spend more time recuperating and restrain himself from exerting his full strength or powers, or his health might fail again. Xavier hides his injuries from the others and resumes his life.&lt;ref name = &quot;xaqplc&quot;/&gt;

===Legion===
Charles meets with former lover [[Gabrielle Haller]] on Muir Isle and discovers that they had a child. The boy, [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David]], is [[autistic]] and suffers from [[multiple personality disorder]] and has vast psionic powers like his father. After helping him and his team to escape from David's mind, Xavier promises he will always be there for him.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' #26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shi'ar Again===
A reformed Magneto is arrested and put on trial. Xavier attends the trial to defend his friend. Andrea and Andreas Strucker, the children of presumed dead Baron von Strucker, crash the courtroom to attack Magneto and Xavier. Xavier is seriously injured. Dying, he asks a shocked Magneto to look after the X-Men for him. Lilandra, who has a psychic bond with Xavier, feels that he is in great danger and heads to Earth. There, she and [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]] take Xavier with them so [[Shi'ar]] advanced technology can heal him.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #199-200&lt;/ref&gt;

Xavier leaves Magneto in charge of the school, but some of the X-Men are unwilling to forgive their former enemy. Cyclops loses a duel for the leadership of the X-Men against Storm, then leaves them and joins the other four original X-Men to form a new team called [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #201&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, Charles becomes stranded in space with the Starjammers, but he is reunited with his lover Lilandra and relishes his carefree lifestyle. He serves as a member of the Starjammers aboard the starship ''Starjammer'', mobile in the Shi'ar Galaxy. He becomes consort to the Princess-Magestrix Lilandra while in exile, and when she later resumes her throne he takes up residence with her in the Imperial palace on the Shi'ar homeworld. Xavier joins Lilandra in her cause to overthrow her sister [[Deathbird]], taking on the powers of Phoenix temporarily wherein he is named Bald Phoenix, but sees that he must return to help the X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' #50-51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Spotlight on... Starjammers'' #1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Cutioner's Song===
Xavier eventually becomes imprisoned by the [[Skrull]]s during their attempted invasion of the Shi'ar Empire. Xavier breaks free from imprisonment by Warskrull Prime, and is reunited with the X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #277&lt;/ref&gt; A healthy Xavier returns from the Shi'ar Empire and is reunited with both the current and original X-Men teams. He resumes his leadership responsibilities of the united teams. In a battle with his old foe, the [[Shadow King]], in the &quot;[[Muir Island Saga]]&quot;, Xavier's spine is shattered, returning him to his former paraplegic state, while his son David is seemingly killed. In the following months, Xavier rebuilds the mansion, which previously was rebuilt with Shi'ar technology, and restructures the X-Men into two teams.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #278-280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #69-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 2 #1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

While holding a mutant rights speech, Xavier is nearly assassinated by [[Stryfe]] in the guise of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], being infected with a fatal [[Legacy Virus|techno-organic virus]]. For reasons of his own, the villain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] saves him. As a temporary side-effect he gains full use of his legs and devotes his precious time to the youngest recruit on his team, [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Cutioner's Song crossover''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #297&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generation X and the Xavier Institute For Higher Learning===
With all his students now highly trained adults, Professor Xavier renames his school the Xavier Institute For Higher Learning. Also, he assumes control of a private institution, the Massachusetts Academy, making it a new School for Gifted Youngsters. Another group of young mutants is trained here, [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], with Banshee and [[Emma Frost]] as headmaster and headmistress, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #318-319&lt;/ref&gt;

===Onslaught===
Professor X is for a time the unknowing host of the evil psionic entity [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], the result of a previous battle with Magneto. In that battle, Magneto uses his powers to rip out the [[adamantium]] bonded to Wolverine's skeleton, and a furious Xavier wipes Magneto's mind, leaving him in a coma.&lt;ref name = &quot;cgvzxf&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fatal Attractions crossover''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #104&lt;/ref&gt; From the psychic trauma of Xavier using his powers so violently and the mixing of Magneto's and Xavier's repressed anger, [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] is born. Onslaught wreaks havoc, destroying much of [[Manhattan]], until many of Marvel's superheroes—including the Avengers, the [[Fantastic Four]] and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]—destroy him.&lt;ref&gt;''Onslaught crossover''&lt;/ref&gt; Xavier is left without his telepathy and, overcome with guilt, leaves the X-Men and is incarcerated for his actions.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 2 #57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Onslaught: Epilogue''&lt;/ref&gt; He later returns to the X-Men after ''[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]'', in which he is shocked by the cruel act of being turned over to the mutant-hating [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], following a clash with the sentient Cerebro and a team of [[Cerebro's X-Men|impostor X-Men]].&lt;ref&gt;''Operation Zero Tolerance crossover''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #360 &amp; 362-364&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' #80 &amp; 82-84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magneto War===
Xavier questions his dream again and Magneto shortly thereafter is confronted by the X-Men. After the battle, the [[United Nations|UN]] concedes [[Genosha]] to Magnus, and Wolverine is angered by Xavier stopping him from getting his revenge on Magneto. Charles and Logan are later trapped in a dimension with different laws of [[physics]], wherein they have to coordinate their moves together and, in the process, gain a better understanding of the other's views.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #368-369&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 2 #88&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Twelve and Cadre K===
Apocalypse kidnaps the fabled &quot;Twelve&quot; special mutants (Xavier included) whose combined energies would grant him omnipotence. After Apocalypse's defeat with the help of [[Skrull]] mutants, Xavier goes with the young Skrulls known as Cadre K to train them and free them from their oppressors, and eventually returns to aid in [[Legacy Virus]] research.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol. 2 #90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #379&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Maximum Security crossover''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;hxotox&quot;&gt;''Dream's End crossover''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moira's death===
[[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and her Brotherhood start a deadly assault on Muir Isle by releasing an altered form of the Legacy Virus, all in retaliation against the election campaign of [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]], a seeming mutant-hater. Mystique blows up Moira MacTaggert's laboratory complex, fatally wounding her. Charles goes to the astral plane to meet with her and retrieve information on the cure to the Legacy Virus, but after gathering the information does not want to leave her alone. If not for Jean pulling him back, the professor would have died with his first love, who states she has no regrets.&lt;ref name = &quot;hxotox&quot;/&gt;

===Crucifixion===
As [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] cures the Legacy Virus, many infected Genoshan mutants recover overnight, providing Magneto, current ruler of Genosha, with an army to start the third World War. He demands Earth's governments to accept him as their leader, and abducts and crucifies Xavier in Magda Square for all to see. A loyal member of Magneto's [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], Amelia Voght, can't stand to see her former lover punished in such a manner and sets him free. Jean Grey and rather untrained newcomers, as most of the team are elsewhere, distract Magneto and Wolverine guts him. Xavier is too late to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;''Eve of Destruction crossover''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cassandra Nova===
Xavier's [[evil twin]] [[Cassandra Nova]], whom Xavier attempted to kill while they were both in their mother's womb, orders a group of rogue Sentinels to destroy the independent mutant nation of Genosha. Magneto, who is Genosha's leader, appears to die along with the vast majority of the nation's inhabitants. Nova then takes over Xavier's body. Posing as Xavier, she reveals his mutation to the world, something he needed to do but did not want to sully his reputation over,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Marvel - Professor X History| publisher = Marvel Store| url = http://www.marvelstore.co.uk/professor_x/history/|accessdate = 2006-11-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060912125120/http://www.marvelstore.co.uk/professor_x/history/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; before going into space and crippling the Shi'ar Empire. The X-Men restore Xavier, but Lilandra, believing that too much disaster has come from the Shi'ar's involvement with the X-Men, annuls her marriage to Xavier. Lilandra previously had gone insane and tried to assassinate Charles on a trip to [[Mumbai]]. During this period, a mutant named [[Xorn]] joins the X-Men. Xorn uses his healing power to restore Xavier's use of his legs.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #114-117, #121-126, #133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juggernaut reformed===
When the X-Men receive a distress call from a Scottish island, they are surprised to find Juggernaut with nowhere to go, as the island was destroyed by his further-mutated partner in crime, [[Black Tom Cassidy]], who died. Xavier reaches out to his stepbrother and offers him a place in his mansion, with Cain reluctantly accepting. The Juggernaut redeems himself over the next few weeks and joins the X-Men. Xavier finds out that Cain's father preferred him to his own flesh and blood and that they both thought they deserved the abuse they incurred by Kurt; Cain believed this because his father loved someone else's child more than him, and Charles felt guilty about getting in the way. That it is why neither of them stopped Kurt Marko with their powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #411-412, 429&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Corporation and &quot;Xorn's&quot; Betrayal===
Now outed as a mutant, Xavier makes speeches to the public about mutant tolerance. He also founds the X-Corporation, or X-Corp (not to be confused with the [[X-Corps]]), with offices all over the world. The purpose of the X-Corp is to watch over mutant rights and help mutants in need. As a result of being outed, the school no longer hides the fact that it is a school for mutants and it opens its doors for more mutant (and even human) students to come in. A student named Quentin Quire and members of his gang start a riot at the Xavier Institute during an open house at the school. As a result, Quire and two other students are killed. Uncertain about his dream's validity, Xavier announces that he will step down as headmaster and be succeeded by Jean Grey. Afterwards, Xorn reveals himself to be Magneto, having apparently not died in the Sentinel raid on Genosha. &quot;Magneto&quot; re-paralyzes Xavier, kidnaps him, and destroys the X-Mansion (killing several of the students). Then Xorn/Magneto assaults New York, where Cyclops, Fantomex and a few students confront him. After the rest of the X-Men arrive, Wolverine decapitates Xorn/Magneto, who shortly before killed Jean with an electromagnetically induced stroke. With Jean dead, Xavier leaves the school to Cyclops and Emma Frost, to bury Xorn/Magneto in Genosha. There he meets the real Magneto, who mysteriously survived Cassandra Nova's assault. The two resolve their differences and attempt to restore their friendship, leading a team of mutants, &quot;The Genoshan Excalibur,&quot; to rebuild and restore order to the destroyed island nation.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #128-132, 135-138, 146-150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' vol. 2 #1-8&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Danger&quot;===
At the mansion, the Danger Room, the X-Men’s [[simulated reality]] training chamber, gains [[sentience]], christens itself &quot;Danger&quot;, assumes a humanoid form, and attacks the X-Men before leaving to kill Xavier. With Magneto's help, Xavier holds off Danger until the X-Men arrive. Danger flees, but not before revealing to Colossus that Xavier has known it to be sentient ever since he upgraded it. Colossus is especially offended by this because he had been held captive and experimented upon by Danger's ally, [[Ord (comics)|Ord]] of the Breakworld. Ashamed, Xavier tries to explain to them that by the time he realized what was happening, he could see no other course. The disgusted X-Men leave.&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' vol. 2 #9-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' 155-156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3 #7, 9-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of M===
Magneto's daughter, the [[Scarlet Witch]], suffers a mental breakdown and [[Avengers Disassembled|causes the death of several Avengers]]. Magneto brings her to Xavier and asks him to use his mental powers to help her. Although aided by [[Doctor Strange]] and the appearance of Cassandra Nova, Xavier is unsuccessful. Xavier orders a meeting of the X-Men and Avengers to decide Wanda's fate.&lt;ref&gt;''[[House of M]]'' [[limited series]]&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], believing the heroes plan to kill her, speeds off to Genosha and convinces Wanda that she could right the wrongs she inflicted by using her powers to alter reality.

Quicksilver somehow forces a tearful Wanda to reveal to him her heart's desires of Magneto, the assembled New Avengers, and the X-Men, and then uses her powers to make them all real. Thanks to Magneto, though, this re-imagined world is a place where a much more numerous mutant-kind are the dominant species, humans a disenfranchised and oppressed 'silent majority', and Magneto himself rules supreme. In this reality, the only proof that Charles Xavier ever existed is a secret monument in Magneto's palace garden, with the engraved message &quot;He died so Genosha could live&quot;.

After mutant [[Layla Miller]] restores the memories of some of the X-Men and Avengers, they head to Genosha where they discover that Magneto has erected a memorial garden for Xavier commemorating his death. Emma is horrified until [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]] fades into the grave and discovers there is no body inside. After a battle, Scarlet Witch again uses her powers to restore reality and, as a slight against her father, causes 91.4 percent of mutants to [[Decimation (comics)|lose their powers]], leaving the mutant race on the brink of extinction and causing the lost powers to become an energy mass, [[The Collective (comics)|the Collective]]. With reality restored, Xavier is still missing and the X-Men are unable to detect him with Cerebro&lt;ref&gt;''House of M #1-8&lt;/ref&gt;''.

===Vulcan===
Xavier returns when Cyclops' and Havok's long-lost brother, [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Deadly Genesis #1-5&quot;/&gt; is revived by the Collective energy released as a result of the &quot;House of M&quot; incident. Vulcan then attacks the X-Men. Xavier, now depowered but able to walk in the wake of &quot;House of M&quot;, reveals that he had gathered and trained another team of X-Men (this one composed of students of [[Moira MacTaggert|Dr. Moira MacTaggert]]) sometime between the original team and the new X-Men team introduced in Giant Size X-Men #1. This team included Vulcan as a member. Like the &quot;Giant Size&quot; X-Men team, McTaggert's former students were sent to rescue the original X-Men from Krakoa, the living island. However, after rescuing Cyclops, McTaggert's former students were seemingly killed. Upon Cyclops' return, Xavier removed Cyclops' memories of the death of Vulcan and his teammates, and began assembling the &quot;Giant Size&quot; X-Men. Vulcan skirmishes with the X-Men and eventually flees into space.

In spite of Cyclops' feelings, Xavier forms a new team including [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] and [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], the lone other survivor of Moira's students.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #475&lt;/ref&gt; Xavier seeks to confront Vulcan before he can enact his vengeance against the Shi'ar empire, which killed Vulcan's mother. While en route to the Shi'ar home world, Xavier is abducted and is later thrown into the [[M'Kraan Crystal]] by Vulcan. Darwin follows Xavier into the crystal and pulls Xavier out. This somehow restores Xavier's lost telepathy. With help from his longtime lover, Lilandra, Xavier escapes back to Earth with several of his X-Men.

===World War Hulk===
Upon Xavier's return to Earth, he begins to search for lost mutants such as Magneto. Charles' search for more mutants is interrupted by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], who was sent into extraterrestal exile by [[Illuminati (comics)|the Illuminati]], a group of powerful superbeings to which Xavier belongs. Xavier had no part in (and did not know of) the Hulk exile decision, but Xavier admits to Hulk that he would have concurred to a temporary exile so [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]] could be cured of transforming into the Hulk. However, he also tells the Hulk he would not have agreed to permanent exile. Xavier attempts to surrender to the Hulk, but after viewing the X-Mansion's large graveyard dedicated to post-M-Day mutant deaths, The Hulk concludes the mutants have suffered enough, and leaves the Mansion grounds on his own accord.

===Messiah Complex===
While using Cerebra and talking to Beast, Charles detects a new mutant so powerful it fries Cerebra's system. He asks Cyclops to send out a team to find out about the mutant. Once the team have come back empty handed, he argues with Scott for not telling him about the team he deployed to find former Acolytes. Scott tells him outright that he doesn't need him to run the X-Men anymore. This upsets Charles and annoys him later on when he overhears Cyclops briefing X-Factor on the situation.{{Issue|date=August 2010}} He also approaches the [[New X-Men]] in an attempt to help them figure out a non-violent way to help against the Purifiers, but is quickly rebuked by [[Surge (comics)|Surge]], who questions where he was when they were getting attacked the first time, and that they didn't need to learn from him. Charles questions Cyclops' decision to send X-Force to hunt down his own son, Cable, in front of the students. Cyclops then tells Xavier that he is a distraction that will keep getting in the way and that he must leave the mansion. Xavier is contacted by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], who lost the mutant newborn to the traitorous actions of [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], who in turn lost the child to the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], and tells him that he is the only one who can help Cable save the future.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men #494''&lt;/ref&gt; In the final fight, Xavier is accidentally shot in the head by Bishop. Immediately afterward Xavier's body disappears and Cyclops declares that there are no more X-Men.{{Issue|date=August 2010}}

===X-Men: Legacy===
Professor Xavier survives Bishop's gunshot but falls into a coma.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Legacy'' #208&lt;/ref&gt; Xavier is kidnapped by Exodus, Tempo, and [[Karima Shapandar]]. Exodus tries to heal Xavier, Xavier mentally fights Exodus. Exodus finally approaches Magneto, who is apparently still depowered, for help.

Magneto and Karima Shapandar are able to stir Xavier's memories and coax him out of his coma, though Xavier remains slightly confused and partly amnesiac. Later, Exodus confronts Magneto about [[Joanna Cargill]]'s injury (Magneto was forced to shoot a laser through her eyeball in order to prevent her attempted assassination of Xavier). Exodus nearly kills Magneto, and Xavier drags Exodus onto the Astral Plane, putting Xavier's own newly-restored mind at stake. Xavier defeats Exodus after a harrowing psionic battle, and Exodus reveals the reason he abducted Xavier and to restore his mind: Exodus wants Xavier to lead the Acolytes and find the mutant messiah child (now under the guardianship of Cable) in order to indoctrinate the child into their cause. Xavier refuses. [[Emma Frost|Emma Frost's]] telepathy picks up on the psychic fight, and Emma informs Cyclops that Xavier is alive. Xavier parts company with Magneto and Karima in order to try and regain his lost memories by visiting people from his past.&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Men Legacy #210&quot;&gt;''X-Men Legacy'' #210&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person Charles visits is [[Hazard (Marvel Comics)|Carter Ryking]], who had gone insane after losing his powers. Charles reads Carter's memories and discovers that when the two were children they were used as test subjects by [[Mister Sinister|Nathan Milbury]] of the Black Womb Project, with the approval of Charles' father, Doctor Brian Xavier. Xavier makes the connection Milbury and X-Men villain, [[Mister Sinister]], who has apparently long been manipulating Charles' life in addition to other X-Men. Afterwards, he discovers he's been targeted by assassins.&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Men Legacy #211&quot;&gt;''X-Men Legacy'' #211&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles eventually discovers Mister Sinister had set up Charles, Sebastian Shaw, Juggernaut, and Ryking as potential new hosts for Sinister's mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Men Legacy #210&quot;/&gt; Bleeding slowly to death, he apparently gives in to Sinister becoming the new Mister Sinister. But in reality, Xavier is still battling Sinister for control of his body.&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Men Legacy #210&quot;/&gt; As Sebastian Shaw and Gambit destroy Sinister's Cronus Machine, the device that he used to transfer his consciousness into new hosts, Xavier drives Sinister out of his body permanently.&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Men Legacy #211&quot;/&gt; Xavier thanks Shaw and Gambit for their help and declares he must go and see Cyclops immediately.&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Men Legacy #214&quot;&gt;''X-Men Legacy'' #214&lt;/ref&gt; Professor X returns to the X-Mansion to find it destroyed after recent events.&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Men Legacy #214&quot;/&gt; Afterwards, Xavier leaves the ruins of the X-Mansion to secretly meet up Cyclops by psychically coercing his former student for the visit. Xavier explains to Cyclops about the recent events with Mr. Sinister and tries to explain to Cyclops how Sinister has been manipulating Scott's and Jean's lives since when they were children. Xavier attempts to have Scott give him permission to scan Scott's mind for traces of Sinister's influences, but instead Scott turns the tables on Xavier by revealing that he has secretly invited Emma Frost into their entire meeting and also into Xavier's mind.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;X-Men Legacy&quot; #215&lt;/ref&gt; While in his mind, Emma forces Xavier to relive each of his morally ambiguous decisions under altruistic pretenses. As the issue continues, Charles realizes his human arrogance and that while some of his decisions were morally wrong, he must move forward with his life and deal with the consequences. Emma ends her incursion into Xavier's mind by reminding him of Moira MacTaggert's last words. As he reflects on Moira's words, Xavier gives Cyclops his blessing to lead the X-Men and leaves to find his own path.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Legacy'' #216&lt;/ref&gt; Following his encounter with Wolverine (in the &quot;Original Sin&quot; Arc) Professor Xavier seeks out his step brother, the unstoppable Juggernaut in an attempt to reform him. After a conversation about the meaning of the word &quot;Juggernaut&quot; and a review of Juggernaut and Xavier's shared history Xavier offers Cain an empty box as a gift. Confused by Xavier's gift Cain attempts to kill the Professor bringing an entire sports bar down over their heads in the process. Later Cain battles the X-Men in his full Juggernaut armor and conquers the planet. Just as everything appears to be under the Juggernaut's control Xavier reappears and informs him that everything that has just taken place except for Juggernaut destroying the bar took place in Cain's mind. A baffled Cain demands to know how Xavier managed to overcome his psychically shielded helmet to which the Professor replies that he decided to visit Cain in his sleep. Professor Xavier then informs him that he now understands Cain as a person and that he will not attempt to get in his way or reform him again. But Xavier also warns Cain that if he gets in the way of the Professor's path to redemption Xavier will stop him permanently.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Legacy'' #219&lt;/ref&gt; Following his encounter with Cain it has been revealed that Xavier is now searching for Rogue.&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Men Legacy #220&quot;&gt;''X-Men Legacy'' #220&lt;/ref&gt;

After his bruising encounter with Cyclops and Emma Frost, Professor X is forced to revisit the biggest challenge and the biggest failure of his career, Wolverine, when the feral mutant asks for Charles' help in freeing his son from the clutches of the Hellfire Club. As the two search for Daken, Wolverine reveals that when he first joined the X-Men he attempted to assassinate Xavier due to some unknown programming. In response, the Professor broke Logan's mind and rebuilt it so that any and all programming he received was forgotten. Logan also revealed that the real reason Xavier asked him to join the X-Men was that Charles &quot;needed a weapon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;X-Men Legacy&quot; #217&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Professor Xavier and Wolverine locate Sebastian Shaw's mansion and attack his minions, just as they are about to enter a bomb explodes from within catching them both off guard. From the wreckage emerges an angry Sebastian who immobilizes Wolverine. Meanwhile, Miss Sinister knocks [[Daken]] unconscious and has him taken to the medlab in the mansion's basement. As Shaw prepares to deliver a killing blow to Xavier, Wolverine recovers and stops him telling Xavier to rescue his son. Professor Xavier locates the medlab and after a quick psychic battle with Miss Sinister enters Daken's fractured mind. While in Daken's mind Xavier discovers Romulus's psychic tampering and comments that Daken's mind is even more broken than Wolverine's was. Before Xavier can heal Daken a psychic bomb explodes causing Xavier to become comatose and Daken to wake up. Miss Sinister arrives and attempts to manipulate Daken who reveals that the psychic bomb in his head restored his memories and stabs Miss Sinister in the chest. Meanwhile Wolverine defeats Shaw and enters the mansion to find Daken standing over an unconscious Xavier preparing to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;X-Men Legacy&quot; #218&lt;/ref&gt; Wolverine tells Daken that he won't let him hurt Xavier and the two fight. Overcome with guilt over what happened to Daken and Itsu, Wolverine allows himself to be beaten. Just as Daken appears to have won Xavier pulls both of them onto the astral plane revealing that the psychic bomb had little effect on him because his psyche was already shattered. Xavier then explains to Wolverine and Daken that Romulus is solely responsible for Itsu's death and that he lied to Daken about everything because he wanted Wolverine to become his weapon. As the three converse Daken returns to the physical plane and prevents Shaw from killing Xavier. With the truth revealed Wolverine and Daken decide to kill Romulus. As the two depart Wolverine tells Xavier that he forgives him for all of the dark moments in their history. Wolverine acknowledges that Professor Xavier allowed him to become a hero. Wolverine then tells the Professor that he hopes he will one day be able to forgive him for choosing to kill Romulus.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #30&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Xavier recruits [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] to go with him to [[Australia]] to find and help Rogue who is currently staying at the X-Men's old base in the outback; unaware Danger is using Rogue as a conduit for her revenge against him.&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Men Legacy #220&quot;/&gt;

===Secret Invasion===
Professor X was at the meeting of the Illuminati when it came to the discussion about the Skrulls planning an invasion by taking out Earth's heroes and posing as them. He claims he was unable to distinguish that [[Black Bolt]] had been replaced by a [[Skrull]], and his powers were bested quickly by the Black Bolt Skrull. Professor X leaves after learning even he can no longer trust the others, yet appears to have severely restricted the number of people he informs of the forthcoming alien invasion, as the X-Men were not prepared for the Skrulls, at least at first.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; Xavier is not seen again during the events of ''Secret Invasion'', though his X-Men in San Francisco are successful at repelling the invaders there through the use of the modified Legacy Virus.

===Dark Reign===
After convincing Exodus to disband the Acolytes, a H.A.M.M.E.R. helicopter arrives and from inside appears [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]], who wants to talk to him.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Legacy'' #225&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Dark Avengers]]' arrival in San Francisco to enforce martial law and squelch the anti-mutant riots occurring in the city, Xavier appears (back in his wheelchair) in the company of Norman Osborn and publicly denounces Cyclops' actions and urges him to turn himself in. However, this Xavier was revealed to be [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] who Osborn recruited to impersonate Xavier in public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uncanny X-Men #513&quot;&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #513&lt;/ref&gt; The real Xavier is shown in prison on Alcatraz and slowly being stripped of his telepathic powers while in psionic contact with Beast, who was arrested earlier for his part in the anti-mutant riots.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Utopia'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; It was also revealed by [[Emma Frost]] that she and Professor X are both Omega Class Telepaths when she manages to detect the real Professor X.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uncanny X-Men #513&quot;/&gt; Professor X helps Emma Frost enter Sentry's mind. However, as Emma frees him of the Void's influence, a minute sliver of the entity itself remains in her mind. Xavier quickly tells her to remain in her diamond armor state to prevent the Void from gaining access to her psi-powers. Professor X is later seen with Emma Frost where Beast is recuperating.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nation X===
After the events of ''Utopia'', Xavier has come to live on the risen Asteroid M, rechristened Utopia, along with the rest of the X-Men, X-Club, and mutant refugees and is also allowed to join the Utopia lead council (Cyclops, Storm, Namor, Iceman, Beast, Wolverine and Emma Frost). While he no longer continues to openly question every move that Cyclops makes, he is still concerned about some of his leadership decisions. Xavier had wanted to return to the mainland in order to clear his name, but in the aftermath of Osborn declaring Utopia as a mutant detention area, Cyclops refused to let him leave, stating that it would be a tactical advantage to have him as an ace in the hole in case the need arose. To that end, he has kept Xavier out of the field and instead relied on Emma Frost, Psylocke and the Stepford Cuckoos respectively for their own psionic talents.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #515&lt;/ref&gt; While attending the funeral of Yuriko Takiguchi, Magneto arrives at Utopia, apparently under peaceful motives. Xavier does not believe it, and attacks Magneto telepathically, causing Cyclops to force him to stand down.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #516&lt;/ref&gt; He later apologizes to Magneto for acting out of his old passions from their complicated relationship, which Magneto accepts.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #520&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Coming===
Professor Xavier is next seen on Utopia delivering a eulogy at Nightcrawler's funeral. Like the other X-Men he is deeply saddened by Kurt's death and anxious about the arrival of Cable and Hope.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' #13&lt;/ref&gt; Xavier is next seen using his powers to help his son Legion control his many personalities and battle the Nimrods.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' #14&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of Second Coming Professor X is next seen surveying the aftermath of the battle from a helicopter. As Hope descends to the ground and cradles Cable's lifeless arm, Xavier reflects on everything that has transpired and states that, while he feels that Hope has indeed come to save mutantkind and revive his dream, she is still only a young woman and will have a long and difficult journey before she can truly achieve her potential.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Second Coming'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:Cerebro film.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Cerebro]], as seen in the ''X-Men'' films.]]
Professor X is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses vast telepathic powers, and is among the most powerful Earth-born telepaths in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Professor X is able to perceive the thoughts of others or project his own thoughts within a radius of approximately {{convert|250|mi|km|-1}}. With extreme effort, he can greatly extend the range of his telepathy. He can learn foreign languages by reading the language centers of the brain of someone adept, and alternately &quot;teach&quot; languages to others in the same manner; Xavier once trained a new group of mutants mentally, subjectively making them experience months of training together, while only hours passed in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Deadly Genesis''&lt;/ref&gt;

Xavier's vast psionic powers enable him to manipulate the minds of others, warp perceptions to make himself seem invisible, project mental illusions, cause loss of particular memories, and induce pain or temporary mental and/or physical paralysis in others. Within close range, he can manipulate almost any number of minds for such simple feats. However, he can only take full possession of one other mind at a time, and must strictly be within that person's physical presence. He is one of the few telepaths skilled enough to communicate with animals and even share their perceptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Men Legacy #211&quot;/&gt; He can also telepathically take away or control people's natural bodily functions and senses, such as sight, hearing, smell, taste, or even mutant powers. A side effect of his telepathy is that he is gifted with an [[eidetic memory]]. He has displayed telepathic prowess sufficient to confront [[Ego the Living Planet]], while aided by [[Cadre K]]&lt;ref&gt;Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet&lt;/ref&gt; as well as narrowly defeat [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]].&lt;ref&gt;X-Men Legacy #210&lt;/ref&gt; However, he cannot permanently 'reprogram' human minds to believe what he might want them to believe even if he wanted to do so, explaining that the mind is an organism that would always recall the steps necessary for it to reach the present and thus 'rewrite' itself to its original setting if he tried to change it.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; However, his initial reprogramming of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] lasted several years, despite how Wolverine's healing factor works around such a reprogramming much faster than an ordinary human mind.&lt;ref&gt;''House of M'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; 

He can cause the loss of specific memories or even total amnesia. He can also project powerful mental 'bolts', enabling him to stun the mind of another person into unconsciousness or even cause death. These 'bolts' inflict damage only upon other minds, having a negligible effect on non-mental beings, if any. The manner in which Xavier's powers function indicates that his telepathy is physical in some way, as it can be enhanced by physical means (for example,, Cerebro) and can be disrupted by physical means (for example,, Magneto's alteration of the Earth's magnetic field).

Xavier can perceive the distinct mental presence/brain waves of other superhuman mutants within a small radius of himself. To detect mutants to a wider area beyond this radius, he must amplify his powers through Cerebro and subsequently Cerebra, computer devices of his own design which are sensitive to the psychic/physical energies produced by the mind.

Professor X can project his 'astral form' into a psychic 'dimension' known as the 'astral plane.' There, he can use his powers to create objects, control his surroundings, and even control and destroy the astral forms of others. He cannot project this form over long distances.

''Uncanny X-Men'' writer [[Ed Brubaker]] has claimed that, after being de-powered by the [[Scarlet Witch]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[House of M]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and then re-powered by the [[M'Kraan Crystal]], Charles' telepathy is more powerful than was previously known. However, the extent of this enhancement is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;''World War Hulk: X-Men'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles is a genius with multiple [[doctorate]]s. He is a world-renowned geneticist, an expert in mutation, possesses considerable knowledge of [[life science]]s, and is the [[inventor]] of [[Cerebro]].&lt;ref name = &quot;ydnsmw&quot;/&gt; He is the leading authority on genetics, mutation, and psionic powers, and possesses considerable expertise in other life sciences. He possesses a Ph.D. in genetics, biophysics, and psychology. He is highly talented in devising equipment for utilizing and enhancing psionic powers.

During his travels in Asia, Xavier learned [[martial arts]], acquiring &quot;refined combat skills&quot; according to Magneto. When these skills are coordinated in tandem with his [[telepathic]] abilities, Xavier is a dangerous unarmed combatant, capable of sensing the intentions of others and countering them with superhuman efficiency. He also has extensive knowledge of [[pressure points]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #321&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Xavier was also given possession of the Mind [[Infinity Gem]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; It allows the user to boost mental power and access the thoughts and dreams of other beings. Backed by the Power Gem, it is possible to access all minds in existence simultaneously. Like all other former Illuminati members, Xavier has sworn to never use the gem and to keep its location hidden.

==Toys==
Professor X has been released as a figure by Toybiz a total of five times, once in 1993, three times with the movie release including two variants, and once in the [[Marvel Legends]] series 9. He has also been released as a part of the Marvel Super Hero Squad line of miniature figures produced by Hasbro.

* [[Chief (comics)|Niles Caulder]] is the paraplegic leader of the original [[Doom Patrol]]. Like Professor X, Caulder recruits a group of reluctant outcasts to fight crime. Much has been made in the striking similarities between these two characters.{{Or|date=August 2010}} They both share a dark side; Caulder, however, surrenders to his dark side while Professor X tries to suppress his. Their respective enemies are also similarly named: the X-Men fight the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], while the Doom Patrol fight the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. However, because of their close proximity to release (roughly a month), there is little merit to the argument that one is a copy of the other, and can be marked up as a coincidence,{{Or|date=August 2010}} akin to the similarities between [[Swamp Thing]] and [[Man-Thing]].

The '''Central Pacific Railroad''' (CPRR) is the former name of the railroad network built between [[California]] and [[Utah]], [[USA]] that formed part of the &quot;[[First Transcontinental Railroad]]&quot; in [[North America]]. It is now part of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]. Many 19th century national proposals to build a transcontinental railroad failed because of the energy consumed by political disputes over [[slavery]]. With the [[secession]] of [[the South]], the modernizers in the [[Republican Party (US)|Republican Party]] controlled the [[US Congress]]. They passed legislation to authorize the railroad, and created financing in the form of government railroad bonds. These were all eventually repaid with interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://CPRR.org/Museum/FAQs.html#repaidDaggett, Stuart (1908). &quot;Railroad Reorganization: Union Pacific,&quot; ''Harvard Economic Studies'', p. 256.]&lt;/ref&gt; The government and the railroads both shared in the increased value of the land grants, which the railroads developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=440&amp;invol=668#t6 ''LEO SHEEP CO. V. UNITED STATES'', 440 U.S. 668 (1979)]&lt;/ref&gt; Once the railroad was constructed, the government saved expenses for the transportation of the mails and the military.

==Authorization and construction==
Planned by [[Theodore Judah]], the Central Pacific Railroad was authorized by Congress in 1862. It was financed and built through &quot;[[The Big Four (Central Pacific Railroad)|The Big Four]]&quot; (who called themselves &quot;The Associates&quot;): [[Sacramento, California]] businessmen [[Leland Stanford]], [[Collis Huntington]], [[Charles Crocker]], and [[Mark Hopkins (railroad)|Mark Hopkins]]. Crocker was in charge of construction. The western labor teams were primarily made up of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] emigrant workers with up to 12,000 such laborers employed by the Central Pacific Railroad representing 90 percent of the entire work force.&lt;ref&gt;George Kraus, &quot;Chinese Laborers and the Construction of the Central Pacific,&quot; ''Utah Historical Quarterly'', vol. 37, no. 1 (Winter 1969), pp. 41-57.&lt;/ref&gt; They laid the first rails in 1863. The &quot;[[Golden spike]]&quot;, connecting the western railroad to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] at [[Promontory, Utah]], was hammered on May 10, 1869. Coast-to-coast train travel in eight days became possible, replacing months-long sea voyages and lengthy, hazardous travel by wagon trains.

In 1885 the Central Pacific Railroad was leased by the [[Southern Pacific Company]]. Technically the CPRR remained a corporate entity until 1959, when it was formally merged into Southern Pacific. (It was reorganized in 1899 as the Central Pacific &quot;Railway&quot;.) The original right-of-way is now controlled by the [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]], which purchased Southern Pacific in 1996.

The Union Pacific-Central Pacific (Southern Pacific) mainline followed the historic [[Overland Trail (United States)|Overland Route]] from [[Omaha, Nebraska]] to [[S
