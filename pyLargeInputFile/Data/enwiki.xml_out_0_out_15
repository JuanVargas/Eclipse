=== Omitting modern medical care ===

Receiving [[alternative medicine]] as a replacement for standard modern medical care could result in inadequate diagnosis or treatment of conditions for which modern medicine has a better treatment record.

As with other alternative medicines, unethical or naive practitioners may also induce patients to exhaust financial resources by pursuing ineffective treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barret|first=S|title=Be Wary of Acupuncture, Qigong, and &quot;Chinese Medicine&quot;|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/acu.html|publisher= [[Quackwatch]] | accessdate= 2010-11-03 | date  =2007-12-30 | authorlink = Stephen Barrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report, Report into Traditional Chinese Medicine| url= http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/ca78e168ce1b6fa2ca2570b400200a34/$FILE/reportversion2.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = [[Parliament of New South Wales]] | accessdate=2010-11-03 | date = 2005-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Profession ethical codes set by accrediting organizations such as the [[National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine]] require referrals to make &quot;timely referrals to other health care professionals as may be appropriate.&quot;&lt;ref name=NCCAOMethics&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nccaom.org/about/pdfdocs/Code_of_Ethics.pdf | publisher = [[National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine]] | title= NCCAOM Code of Ethics | accessdate= 2010-11-03 | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]], public health departments in the provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[British Columbia]] regulate acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Traditional Chinese Medicine Act, 2006 | url = http://www.search.e-laws.gov.on.ca/en/isysquery/f810a2e9-6cd9-42ff-926d-4de171f932ee/1/doc/?search=browseStatutes&amp;context=#hit1 | publisher = [[ServiceOntario]] |accessdate=2010-11-03 | date = 2007-06-04}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Health Professions Act: Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists Regulation | url = http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/32_290_2008 | publisher = Queen’s Printer for British Columbia | accessdate= 2010-11-03 | date = 2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal and political status ==
{{Main|Regulation of acupuncture}}

=== United States ===
Those who specialize in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine are usually referred to as &quot;licensed acupuncturists&quot;, or L.Ac.'s. The abbreviation &quot;Dipl. Ac.&quot; stands for &quot;Diplomate of Acupuncture&quot; and signifies that the holder is board-certified by the NCCAOM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nccaom.org/diplomates/diplomates-home]&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty three states require certification, according to that body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nccaom.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/State%20Licensure%20Table.pdf State Licensure Table]&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll of American doctors in 2005 showed that 59% believe acupuncture was at least somewhat effective for treatment of pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=More than half of the physicians (59%) believed that acupuncture can be effective to some extent. |title=Physicians Divided on Impact of CAM on U.S. Health Care; Aromatherapy Fares Poorly; Acupuncture Touted |publisher=HCD Research |date=9 September 2005 |url=http://www.medicalacupuncture.org/acu_info/pressrelease/physicians_divided.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060110033955/http://publish.hcdhealth.com/P1007/CumulativeReport.htm |archivedate=2006-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] changed the status of acupuncture needles from [[Medical devices#Classification|Class III]] to [[Medical devices#Classification|Class II]] [[medical device]]s, meaning that needles are regarded as safe and effective when used appropriately by licensed practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071219041730/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/departs/596_upd.html Updates-June 1996 FDA Consumer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/PMAApprovals/default.htm US FDA/CDRH: Premarket Approvals]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2004, nearly 50% of Americans who were enrolled in employer health insurance plans were covered for acupuncture treatments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=30006 Report: Insurance Coverage for Acupuncture on the Rise.

=== United Kingdom ===
Acupuncturists are not a regulated profession. The principal body for professional standards in traditional/lay acupuncture is the British Acupuncture Council,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=British Acupuncture Council |url=http://www.acupuncture.org.uk/index.php }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Medical Acupuncture Society &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The British Medical Acupuncture Society |url=http://www.medical-acupuncture.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an inter-disciplinary professional body for regulated health professional using acupuncture as a modality and there is the Acupuncture Association of Chartered Physiotherapists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Acupuncture Association of Chartered Physiotherapists |url=http://www.aacp.org.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
Traditional/lay acupuncture is not a regulated health profession; traditional/lay acupuncture or Chinese Medicine was not included in the National Health Regulation Law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahpra.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt; Acupuncture will not be recognized as a profession in Australia but as a modality, either within Chinese Medicine / traditional Asian healing systems or within the scope of practice of regulated health professions. The practice of acupuncture is governed by a range of state / territory laws relating to consumer protection and infection control. Victoria is the only state of Australia with an operational registration board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmrb.vic.gov.au |title=Welcome to the Chinese Medicine Registration Board of Victoria }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently acupuncturists in New South Wales are bound by the guidelines in the Public Health (Skin Penetration) Regulation 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/public-health/ehb/general/skinpen/skin_pen_reg_2000.pdf |title=Health NSW |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is enforced at local council level. Other states of Australia have their own skin penetration acts.

Traditional/lay acupuncture is not a regulated health profession.

*'''Medical acupuncture''' is using needles to penetrate the skin at the location of real anatomical structures instead of points determined by tradition.
*'''[[Moxibustion]]''' – Acupuncture is often accompanied by moxibustion, the burning of cone-shaped preparations of ''[[Artemisia vulgaris]]'' (mugwort) on or near the skin, often but not always near or on an acupuncture point. Traditionally acupuncture was used to treat [[acute (medicine)|acute conditions]] while moxibustion was used for [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic diseases]].  Moxibustion could be direct (the cone was placed directly on the skin and allowed to burn the skin producing a blister and eventually a scar), or indirect (either a cone of mugwort was placed on a slice of garlic, ginger or other vegetable, or a cylinder of mugwort was held above the skin, close enough to either warm or burn it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=0–0tdqBr58cC&amp;pg=PA170#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 170–173] | last = Needham | first = J | authorlink = Joseph Needham | coauthors = Lu GD | year = 2002 | title = Celestial lancets: a history and rationale of acupuncture and moxa | publisher = [[Routledge]] | isbn = 0700714588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aeneas'_Flight_from_Troy_by_Federico_Barocci.jpg|thumb|280px|''Aeneas flees burning Troy'', [[Federico Barocci]], [[1598]].]] [[File:Aineias Ankhises Louvre F118.jpg|thumb|280px|Aeneas carrying [[Anchises]], black-figured [[oinochoe]], ca. [[520 BC|520]]-[[510 BC]], [[Louvre]] (F 118)]]
'''Aeneas''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ɪ|ˈ|n|iː|ə|s}}; [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{Unicode|Αἰνείας}}, ''Aineías'', derived from Greek Αἰνή meaning &quot;to praise&quot;), in [[Greco-Roman]] [[mythology]], was a [[Troy|Trojan]] [[hero]], the son of the prince [[Anchises]] and the goddess [[Aphrodite]]. His father was the second cousin of King [[Priam]] of Troy. The journey of Aeneas from Troy (with help from Aphrodite), which led to the founding of the city [[Rome]], is recounted in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. He is considered an  important figure in [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Rome|Roman]] legend. Aeneas is a character in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', Quintus Smyrnaeus' ''[[Posthomerica]]'', and [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''.

==Mythology==
In the [[Iliad]], Aeneas is the leader of the Trojan's [[Dardan]]ian allies (Trojans — descendants of Dardanus), as well as a third cousin and principal lieutenant of [[Hector]], son of the Trojan king [[Priam]]. In the poem, Aeneas' mother [[Aphrodite]] frequently comes to his aid on the battlefield; he is a favorite of [[Apollo]]. Aphrodite and Apollo rescue Aeneas from combat with [[Diomedes]] of [[Argos]], who nearly kills him, and carry him away to [[Pergamos]] for healing. Even [[Poseidon]], who normally favors the Greeks, comes to Aeneas' rescue after he falls under the [[assault]] of [[Achilles]], noting that Aeneas, though from a junior branch of the royal family, is destined to become king of the Trojan people.  Aeneas killed 28 people in the Trojan War.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

As seen in the first books of the ''Aeneid,'' Aeneas is one of the few Trojans who were not killed in battle or enslaved when Troy fell.  When Troy was [[looting|sacked]] by the Greeks, Aeneas, after being commanded by the gods to flee, gathered a group, collectively known as the [[Aeneads]], who then traveled to [[Italy]] and became progenitors of the [[Roman Kingdom|Romans]]. The Aeneads included Aeneas' trumpeter [[Misenus]], his father [[Anchises]], his friends [[Achates]], [[Sergestus]] and [[Acmon]], the healer [[Iapyx]], the steady helmsman [[Palinurus]], and his son [[Ascanius]] (also known as Iulus, Julus, or Ascanius Julius.) He carried with him the [[Lares]] and [[Penates]], the statues of the household gods of Troy, and transplanted them to Italy.

(From here on, the context shifts from Greek to Roman, so the Roman names of the gods will be used, except for Aphrodite.)

After a brief but fierce storm sent up against the group at [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]'s request, and several failed attempts to found cities,  Aeneas and his fleet made landfall at [[Carthage]] after six years of wanderings.  Aeneas had a year-long affair with the [[Carthaginian]] queen [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] (also known as Elissa), who proposed that the Trojans settle in her land and that she and Aeneas reign jointly over their peoples. Once again, this was in favour of Juno, who was told of the fact that her favorite city would eventually be defeated by the Trojans' descendants.  However, the messenger god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] was sent by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and Aphrodite to remind Aeneas of his journey and his purpose, thus compelling him to leave secretly and continue on his way. When Dido learned of this, she ordered her sister Anna to construct a pyre, she said, to get rid of Aeneas' possessions, left behind by him in his haste to leave.  Standing on it, Dido uttered a curse that would forever pit Carthage against Rome. She then committed suicide by stabbing herself with the same sword she gave Aeneas when they first met and then falling on the pyre. Anna reproached the mortally wounded Dido. Meanwhile, Juno, looking down on the tragedy and moved by Dido's plight, sent [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]] to make Dido's passage to [[Hades]] quicker and less painful. When Aeneas later traveled to Hades, he called to her ghost but although she recognized him, she turned away (aversa) and kept her eyes fixed on the ground (solo fixos oculos)

The company stopped on the island of [[Sicily]] during the course of their journey. After the first trip, before the Trojans went to Carthage, [[Achaemenides]], one of [[Odysseus]]' crew who had been left behind, traveled with them.  After visiting Carthage, the Trojans returned to Sicily where they were welcomed by [[Acestes]], king of the region and son of the river [[Crinisus]] by a [[Dardania]]n woman.

[[Image:B. PINELLI, Enea e il Tevere.jpg|thumb|right|Aeneas and the god Tiber, by Bartolomeo Pinelli.]]

[[Latinus]], king of the [[Latins]], welcomed Aeneas' army of exiled [[Trojan War|Trojans]] and let them reorganize their lives in [[Latium]]. His daughter [[Lavinia]] had been promised to [[Turnus]], king of the [[Rutuli]], but Latinus received a prophecy that Lavinia would be betrothed to one from another land &amp;mdash; namely, Aeneas. Latinus heeded the prophecy, and Turnus consequently declared war on Aeneas at the urging of Juno, who was aligned with King [[Mezentius]] of [[Etruscan civilization|the Etruscans]] and Queen [[Amata]] of the Latins. Aeneas' forces prevailed. Turnus was killed and his people were captured. According to [[Livy]], Aeneas was victorious but Latinus died in the war. Aeneas founded the city of [[Lavinium]], named after his wife. He later welcomed Dido's sister, [[Anna Perenna]], who then committed suicide after learning of Lavinia's jealousy.

After Aeneas' death, Aphrodite asked Jupiter to make her son immortal. Jupiter agreed and the river god [[Numicus]] cleansed Aeneas of all his mortal parts and Aphrodite anointed him with Ambrosia and Nectar, making him a god. Aeneas was recognized as the god [[Jupiter Indiges]]. Inspired by the work of [[James Frazer]], some have posited that Aeneas was originally a [[life-death-rebirth deity]].

==Family and legendary descendants==

Aeneas had an extensive family tree. His [[wet-nurse]] was [[Caieta]], and he is the father of [[Ascanius]] with [[Creusa]], and of [[Silvius (mythology)|Silvius]] with Lavinia. The former, also known as [[Iulus]] (or Julius), founded [[Alba Longa]] and was the first in a long series of kings. According to the mythology outlined by Virgil in the ''Aeneid,'' [[Romulus and Remus]] were both descendants of Aeneas through their mother Rhea Silvia, making Aeneas progenitor of the Roman people. Some early sources call him their father or grandfather,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4literature.net/Plutarch/Romulus/ Romulus by Plutarch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but considering the commonly accepted dates of the fall of Troy (1184 BC) and the founding of [[Rome]] (753 BC), this seems unlikely. The [[Gens Julia|Julian family]] of Rome, most notably [[Julius Cæsar]] and [[Augustus]], traced their lineage to Ascanius and Aeneas, thus to the goddess Aphrodite. Through the Julians, the [[Palemonids]] make this claim. The legendary [[List of legendary kings of Britain|kings of Britain]] trace their family through a grandson of Aeneas, [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]].

==Physical Appearance==

In [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]], Aeneas is described as strong and handsome, but his hair colour or complexion are not described.&lt;ref&gt;''What Does Aeneas Look like?'', Mark Griffith, Classical Philology, Vol. 80, No. 4 (Oct., 1985), p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; In late antiquity however sources add further physical descriptions. The ''Daretis Phrygii de excidio Trojae historia'' of [[Dares Phrygius]] describes Aeneas as ‘‘auburn-haired, stocky, eloquent, courteous, prudent, pious, and charmin’’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theoi.com/Text/DaresPhrygius.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is also a brief physical description found in [[John Malalas]]' ''Chronographia'':&lt;/br&gt;

‘‘Aeneas: short, fat, with a good chest, powerful, with a ruddy complexion, a broad face,&lt;/br&gt; 
a good nose, fair skin, bald on the forehead, a good beard, grey eyes.’’&lt;ref&gt;''Illuminated prophet books: a study of Byzantine manuscripts of the major and minor prophets'', John Lowden, Penn State Press, 1988, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and film==
In the [[Divine Comedy]] Dante sees the shade of Aeneas among other Roman worthies in the section of Limbo reserved for &quot;virtuous pagans&quot;.

*[[Roman d'Enéas]]

In modern literature, Aeneas appears in [[David Gemmell]]'s Troy series as a main heroic character who goes by the name [[Helikaon]].

Aeneas is a main character in [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s [[Lavinia]], a re-telling of the last six books of the [[Aeneid]] told from the point of view of [[Lavinia]], daughter of King [[Latinus]] of [[Latium]].

Despite the many Hollywood elements, Aeneas has received little interest from the film industry.
Portrayed by [[Steve Reeves]], he was the main character in the 1961 sword-and-sandal [[sword and sandal|peplum]] ''[[Guerra di Troia]]'' (''The Trojan War'').  Reeves reprised the role the following year in the film ''[[The Avenger (1962 film)|The Avenger]]'', about Aeneas's arrival in [[Latium]] and his conflicts with local tribes as he tries to settle his fellow Trojan refugees there.

The most recent cinematic portrayal of Aeneas was in the film [[Troy (film)|Troy]], in which he appears as a youth charged by [[Paris (Trojan)|Paris]] to protect the Trojan refugees, and to continue the ideals of the city and its people. It is at this point that Paris gives Aeneas [[Priam]]'s sword, in order to give legitimacy and continuity to the Royal Line of Troy - and lay the foundations of Rome.

|}}'''''Amaranthus''''', collectively known as '''amaranth''', is a cosmopolitan [[genus]] of herbs. Approximately 60 [[species]] are recognized, with [[inflorescence]]s and foliage ranging from purple and red to gold. Members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus ''[[Celosia]]''. 

Although several species are often considered [[weed]]s, people around the world value amaranths as [[leaf vegetable]]s, [[cereal]]s, and [[ornamental plant|ornamentals]]. A traditional food plant in Africa, amaranth has the potential to improve nutrition, boost [[food security]], foster rural development and support sustainable landcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |author=National Research Council |editor= |others= |title=Lost Crops of Africa: Volume II: Vegetables |origdate= |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763 |format= |accessdate=2008-07-15 |edition= |series=Lost Crops of Africa |volume=2 |date=2006-10-27 |publisher=National Academies Press |location= |isbn=978-0-309-10333-6 |oclc= 34344933 79635740|doi= |id= |pages= |chapter=Amaranth |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763&amp;page=35 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ultimate root of &quot;amaranth&quot; is the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{polytonic|ἀμάραντος}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%234949 Liddell &amp; Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, s.v. ἀμάραντος]&lt;/ref&gt; (''amarantos'') &quot;unfading&quot; with the Greek word for &quot;flower&quot; ἄνθος (''anthos'') factoring into the word's development as &quot;amaranth&quot; - the more correct &quot;amarant&quot; is an archaic variant.

==Systematics==
''Amaranthus'' shows a wide variety of morphological diversity among and even within certain species.  Although the family ([[Amaranthaceae]]) is distinctive, the [[genus]] has few distinguishing characters among the 70 species included.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-8339.2007.00665.x | author = Juan  ''et al.'' | year = 2007 | title = Electrophoretic characterization of ''Amaranthus'' L. seed proteins and its systematic implication | url = | journal = Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 155 | issue = | pages = 57–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This complicates [[taxonomy]] and ''Amaranthus'' has generally been considered among systematists as a “difficult” genus.&lt;ref name = &quot;Costea&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3088717 | author = Costea M., DeMason D. | year = 2001 | title = Stem morphology and anatomy in Amaranthus L. (Amaranthaceae)- Taxonomic significance | url = | journal = Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society | volume = 128 | issue = 3| pages = 254–281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Formerly, Sauer (1955) classified the genus into 2 sub-genera, differentiating only between [[Plant sexuality#Individual plant sexuality|monoecious]] and [[Plant sexuality#Individual plant sexuality|dioecious]] species: ''Acnida'' (L.) Aellen ex K.R. Robertson and ''Amaranthus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Costea&quot; /&gt; Although this classification was widely accepted, further infrageneric classification was (and still is) needed to differentiate this widely diverse group.     

Currently, ''Amaranthus'' includes 3 recognized sub-genera and 70 species, although species numbers are questionable due to [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and species concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Judd et al. (2008). Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach, Third Edition. Sinauer Associates, Inc. Sunderland, MA&lt;/ref&gt; Infrageneric classification focuses on inflorescence, flower characters and whether a species is monoecious/dioecious, as in the Sauer (1955) suggested classification.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot; /&gt; A modified infrageneric classification of ''Amaranthus'' was published by Mosyakin &amp; Robertson (1996) and includes 3 subgenera: ''Acnida'', ''Amaranthus'' and ''Albersia''.  The taxonomy is further differentiated by sections within each of the sub-genera.&lt;ref&gt;Mosyakin &amp; Robertson (1996). New infrageneric taxa and combinations in ''Amaranthus'' (Amaranthaceae). Ann. Bot. Fennici 33: 275-281.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
=== Amaranth Seed ===
Several species are raised for amaranth &quot;grain&quot; in [[Asia]] and the [[Americas]].  This should more correctly be termed &quot;[[pseudograin]]&quot; (see below).   They are highly edible by gluten intolerant individuals because they are not a member of the grass family and contain no gluten.

Ancient amaranth grains still used to this day include the three species, ''[[Amaranthus caudatus]]'', ''[[Amaranthus cruentus]]'', and ''[[Amaranthus hypochondriacus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Costea et al. (2006). Delimitation of Amaranthus cruentus L. and Amaranthus caudatus L. using micromorphology and AFLP analysis: an application in germplasm identification. Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution 53: 1625-1633.&lt;/ref&gt; Although amaranth was (and still is) cultivated on a small scale in parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Peru, India, and Nepal, there is potential for further cultivation in the U.S and tropical countries and it is often referred to as &quot;the crop of the future.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Marx (1977). Speaking of Science: Amaranth: A Comeback for the Food of the Aztecs? Science 198(4312): 40.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed as an inexpensive native crop that could be cultivated by indigenous people in rural areas for several reasons:
# It is easily harvested.
# It produces lots of fruit and thus seeds, which are used as grain.
# It is highly tolerant of arid environments, which are typical of most subtropical and some tropical regions, and
# its seeds contain large amounts of protein and essential amino acids, such as [[lysine]].&lt;ref&gt;De Macvean &amp; Pöll (1997). Chapter 8: Ethnobotany. Tropical Tree Seed Manual, USDA Forest Service, edt. J.A Vozzo.&lt;/ref&gt;  #
# ''Amaranthus'' species contain about thirty percent more protein than most common cereals, like rice, wheat, oats, and rye.&lt;ref&gt;De Macvean &amp; Pöll. (1997). Chapter 8: Ethnobotany. Tropical Tree Seed Manual, USDA Forest Service, edt. J.A Vozzo.&lt;/ref&gt;
# It requires little fuel to cook.  As befits its weedy life history, amaranth grains grow very rapidly and their large seedheads can weigh up to 1 kilogram and contain a half-million seeds.&lt;ref name = &quot;Tucker&quot;&gt;Tucker, J. (1986). Amaranth: the once and future crop. Bioscience 36(1): 9-13.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Amaranth was one of the staple foodstuffs of the [[Inca]]s, and it is known as '''kiwicha''' in the [[Andes]] today. It was also used by the ancient [[Aztec]]s, who called it '''huautli''', and other Native America peoples in [[Mexico]] to prepare ritual drinks and foods. 
To this day, amaranth grains are toasted much like [[popcorn]] or martala and mixed with [[honey]], [[molasses]] or [[chocolate]] to make a treat called ''alegría'' (joy in Spanish).
[[Diego Duran]] described the festivities for [[Huitzilopochtli]]. [[Aztec calendar|Panquetzaliztli]] (7 December to 26 December) was the Aztec month dedicated to Huitzilopochtli. Huitzilopochtli is a blue butterfly god, and in real butterflys, they feed on Amaranth flowers.  People decorated their homes and trees with paper flags; there were ritual races, processions, dances, songs, prayers, and finally human sacrifices. This was one of the more important Aztec festivals, and the people prepared for the whole month. They fasted or ate very little; a statue of the god was made with amaranth ''(huautli)'' seeds and honey, and at the end of the month, it was cut into small pieces so everybody could eat a little piece of the god. After the Spanish conquest, cultivation of amaranth was outlawed, while some of the festivities were [[:wikt:subsume|subsumed]] into the [[Christmas]] celebration.

Amaranth grain is a crop of moderate importance in the [[Himalaya]]. 

Because of its importance as a symbol of indigenous culture, and because it is very palatable, easy to cook, and its protein particularly well suited to human nutritional needs, interest in grain amaranth (especially ''A. cruentus'' and ''A. hypochondriacus'') revived in the 1970s. It was recovered in Mexico from wild varieties and is now commercially cultivated. It is a popular snack sold in [[Mexico City]] and other parts of Mexico, sometimes mixed with [[chocolate]] or [[puffed grain|puffed rice]], and its use has spread to [[Europe]] and parts of [[North America]].  Amaranth and [[quinoa]] are called [[pseudograin]]s because of their flavor and cooking similarities to grains. These are dicot plant seeds, and both contain exceptionally [[complete protein]] for plant sources. Besides [[protein]], [[amaranth grain]] provides a good source of [[dietary fiber]] and [[dietary mineral]]s such as [[iron]], [[magnesium]], [[phosphorus]], [[copper]], and especially [[manganese]]. It has been claimed to be beneficial in preventing greying of hair.  {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Vegetables===
Amaranth species are cultivated and consumed as a leaf vegetable in many parts of the world. There are 4 species of ''Amaranthus'' documented as cultivated vegetables in eastern Asia: ''[[Amaranthus cruentus]]'', ''[[Amaranthus blitum]], [[Amaranthus dubius]]'', and ''[[Amaranthus tricolor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Costea (2003). Notes on Economic Plants. Economic Botany 57(4): 646-649&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], leaf amaranth is called ''bayam'', while the [[Tagalogs]] in the [[Philippines]] call the plant ''alocon.'' In Karnataka state in India it is used to prepare curries like Hulee, palya, Majjigay-hulee and so on. In the state of [[Kerala]], it's called 'Cheera' and is consumed by stir-frying the leaves with spices and red chillies to make 'Cheera Thoran'. In [[Tamilnadu]] State, it is called முளைக்கீரை, and is regularly consumed as a favourite dish, where the greens are steamed, and mashed, with light seasoning of salt, red chillis and cumin. It is  called ''keerai masial (கீரை மசியல்)''.  In [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[India]], this leaf is added in preparation of a popular [[dal]] called ''thotakura pappu'' తొట కూర పప్పు ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]). In [[Maharashtra]], it is called as &quot;Shravani Maath&quot; (literally माठ grown in month of ''Shravan'') and it is available in both red and white colour. In [[Orissa]], it is called as &quot;Khada saga&quot;, it is used to prepare 'Saga Bhaja', in which the leaf is fried with chillies and onions.

Root of mature amaranth is an excellent vegetable. It is white in colour and is cooked with tomatoes or tamarind gravy. It has a milky taste and is alkaline. 

In [[China]], the leaves and stems are used as a stir-fry vegetable, or in soups, and called ''yin choi'' (苋菜; pinyin: xiàncài; and variations on this transliteration in various dialects). Amaranth greens are believed to help enhance eyesight. In [[Vietnam]], it is called ''rau dền'' and is used to make [[soup]]. There are two species popular as edible vegetable in Vietnam: ''dền đỏ''- amaranthus tricolor and ''dền cơm'' or ''dền trắng''- amaranthus viridis. 

In [[East Africa]], Amaranth leaf is known in [[Chewa language|Chewa]] as ''Bonongwe,'' and in [[Swahili language|Swahili]] as ''mchicha'', as ''Terere'' in [[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]], [[Meru language|Meru]] and [[Embu language|Embu]]; and as ''Telele'' in [[Kamba language|Kamba]]. In Bantu-speaking regions of [[Uganda]] it is known as ''Doodo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
 | author=Goode,

 | unused_data=P.M. year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes recommended by some doctors for people having low [[Hematocrit|red blood cell count]]. Also known among the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] as a [[drought]] crop (''chepkerta''). In [[West Africa]] such as in [[Nigeria]], it is a common vegetable, and goes with all Nigerian carbohydrate dishes. It is known in [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] as ''efo tete'' or ''arowo jeja'' (&quot;we have money left over for fish&quot;). In [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]]{{Clarify|date=March 2009}} it is known as ''lenga lenga'' or ''biteku teku''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Caribbean]], the leaves are called ''[[callaloo]]'' and are sometimes used in a soup called pepperpot soup.

In [[Greece]], Green Amaranth (''[[Amaranthus viridis]]'') is a popular dish and is called ''vlita'' or ''vleeta''. It's boiled, then served with [[olive oil]] and [[lemon]] like a [[salad]], usually alongside fried [[fish]]. Greeks stop harvesting the (usually wild-grown) plant when it starts to bloom at the end of August.
In Sri Lanka, it is called &quot;Koora  Thampala&quot;. Sri Lankans cook it and eat it with rice.
Fiji Indians call it choraiya bhaji.

===Dyes===
The flowers of the 'Hopi Red Dye' amaranth were used by the [[Hopi]] (a tribe in the western United States) as the source of a deep red [[natural dye|dye]].  There is also a synthetic dye that has been named &quot;amaranth&quot; for its similarity in color to the natural amaranth [[pigment]]s known as [[betalain]]s. This synthetic dye is also known as [[Red No. 2]] in North America and E123 in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The following color additives are not authorized for use in food products in the United States: (1) Amaranth (C.I. 16185, EEC No. E123, formerly certifiable as FD&amp;C red No. 2);&quot; [http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~comm/cp03803.html FDA/CFSAN Food Compliance Program: Domestic Food Safety Program]&lt;/ref&gt;
'''

===Ornamentals===
The genus also contains several well-known ornamental plants, such as ''[[Amaranthus caudatus]]'' (love-lies-bleeding), a native of [[India]] and a vigorous, hardy annual with dark purplish [[flower]]s crowded in handsome drooping spikes. Another Indian annual, ''A. hypochondriacus'' (prince's feather), has deeply veined lance-shaped leaves, purple on the under face, and deep crimson flowers densely packed on erect spikes.

Amaranths are recorded as food plants for some [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species including the [[Nutmeg (moth)|nutmeg moth]] and various case-bearer moths of the genus ''[[Coleophora]]'': ''C. amaranthella'', ''C. enchorda'' (feeds exclusively on ''Amaranthus''), ''C. immortalis'' (feeds exclusively on ''Amaranthus''), ''C. lineapulvella'' and ''C. versurella'' (recorded on ''A. spinosus'').

==Nutritional value==
'''Amaranth greens''', also called '''Chinese spinach''', '''hinn choy''' or '''yin tsoi''' ({{zh|s=苋菜|t=莧菜|p=xiàncài}}); '''callaloo''', '''dhantinasoppu''' ([[Kannada language|Kannada]]); '''తోటకూర''' ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]); '''Rajgira''' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]); '''முளைக் கீரை''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]), '''cheera''' '''ചീര''' ([[Malayalam]]); '''bayam''' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]); '''phak khom''' '''ผักโขม''' ([[Thai language|Thai]]); '''tampala''', or '''quelite''', ([[Oriya language|Oriya]]); '''Khada Saga''', are a common leaf vegetable throughout the tropics and in many warm temperate regions. It is very popular in India. They are a very good source of [[vitamin]]s including [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin K]], [[vitamin B6]], [[vitamin C]], [[riboflavin]], and [[folate]], and dietary minerals including [[calcium]], [[iron]], [[magnesium]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], and [[manganese]].  Because of its valuable nutrition, some farmers grow amaranth today. 

Amaranth seeds, like [[buckwheat]] and [[quinoa]], contain [[Complete protein|protein that is unusually complete]] for plant sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wholehealthmd.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=17E09E7CFFF640448FFB0B4FC1B7FEF0&amp;nm=Reference+Library&amp;type=AWHN_Foods&amp;mod=Foods&amp;mid=&amp;id=7404261D57C74A058ACB873C7E17627F&amp;tier=2   Reference Library | WholeHealthMD&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Most fruits and vegetables do not contain a complete set of amino acids, and thus different sources of protein must be used.

Its seeds have a protein content greater than that of wheat. However, unlike that found in true grains (i.e. from grass seeds) its protein is not of the problematical type known as [[gluten]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://glutenfreecooking.about.com/od/nutritionmealplanning/a/amaranth.htm 10 Reasons To Use Amaranth in Your Gluten-Free Recipes], by Teri Gruss, URL accessed Oct 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have shown that like [[oats]], amaranth seed or oil may be of benefit for those with [[hypertension]] and [[cardiovascular disease]]; regular consumption reduces [[blood pressure]] and [[cholesterol]] levels, while improving [[antioxidant]] status and some immune parameters.&lt;ref&gt;

==As a weed==
Not all amaranth plants are cultivated.  Most of the species from ''Amaranthus'' are summer annual weeds and are commonly referred to as pigweeds.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bensch&quot;&gt;Bensch et al. (2003). Interference of redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), Palmer amaranth (A. palmeri), and common waterhemp (A. rudis) in soybean. Weed Science 51: 37-43.&lt;/ref&gt; These species have an extended period of germination, rapid growth, and high rates of seed production&lt;ref name = &quot;Bensch&quot;/&gt; and have been causing problems for farmers since the mid-1990s.  This is partially due to the reduction in [[tillage]], reduction in herbicidal use and the evolution of herbicidal resistance in several species where herbicides have been applied more often.&lt;ref&gt;Wetzel et al. (1999). Use of PCR-based molecular markers to identify weedy Amaranthus species. Weed Science 47: 518-523.&lt;/ref&gt; The following 9 species of ''Amaranthus'' are considered invasive and noxious weeds in the U.S and Canada: ''A. albus'', ''A. blitoides'', ''A. hybridus'', ''A. palmeri'', ''A. powellii'', ''A. retroflexus'', ''A. spinosus'', ''A. tuberculatus'', and ''A. viridis''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=AMARA  USDA Plant Database. Plants Profile- ''Amaranthus'' L]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A new herbicide-resistant strain of [[Amaranthus palmeri]] or Palmer amaranth has appeared; it is [[Glyphosate]]-resistant and so cannot be killed by the widely used [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]] herbicide.  Also, this plant can survive in tough conditions.  This could be of particular concern to [[cotton]] farmers using [[Roundup Ready]] cotton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.organicconsumers.org/ge/cotton060404.cfm Herbicide Resistant Weeds Causing Problems for US Cotton Growers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The species ''Amaranthus palmeri'' (Palmer amaranth) causes the greatest reduction in [[soybean]] yields and has the potential to reduce yields by 17-68% in field experiments.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bensch&quot;/&gt;  Palmer amaranth is among the “top five most troublesome weeds” in the southeast and has already evolved resistances to dinitroanilines and acetolactate synthase inhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;Culpepper et al. (2006). Glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) confirmed in Georgia. Weed Science 54: 620-626.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the proper identification of ''Amaranthus'' species at the seedling stage essential for agriculturalists.  Proper herbicide treatment needs to be applied before the species successfully colonizes in the crop field and causes significant yield reductions.

===Beneficial weed===
Pigweed can be a [[beneficial weed]], as well as a [[companion plant]], serving as a trap for leaf miners and some other pests, as well as sheltering ground beetles (which prey upon insect pests) and breaking up hard soil for more delicate neighboring plants.

==Myth, legend and poetry==
'''Amaranth''', or Amarant (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''amarantos'', unwithering), a name chiefly used in poetry, and applied to Amaranth and other plants which, from not soon fading, typified immortality. 

[[Aesop's Fables]] (6th century BC) compares the Rose to the Amaranth to illustrate the difference in fleeting and everlasting beauty.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:A Rose and an Amaranth blossomed side by side in a garden,
:and the Amaranth said to her neighbour,
:&quot;How I envy you your beauty and your sweet scent!
:No wonder you are such a universal favourite.&quot;
:But the Rose replied with a shade of sadness in her voice,
:&quot;Ah, my dear friend, I bloom but for a time:
:my petals soon wither and fall, and then I die.
:But your flowers never fade, even if they are cut;
:for they are everlasting.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Or in story mode:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:An amaranth planted in a garden near a Rose-Tree, thus addressed it:  &quot;What a lovely flower is the Rose, a favorite alike with Gods and with men.  I envy you your beauty and your perfume.&quot;  The Rose replied, &quot;I indeed, dear Amaranth, flourish but for a brief season! If no cruel hand pluck me from my stem, yet I must perish by an early doom.  But thou art immortal and dost never fade, but bloomest for ever in renewed youth.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Thus, in [[John Milton|John Milton's]] epic poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667), iii. 353:  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:&quot;Immortal amarant, a flower which once
:In paradise, fast by the tree of life,
:Began to bloom; but soon for man's offence
:To heaven removed, where first it grew, there grows,
:And flowers aloft, shading the fount of life,
:And where the river of bliss through midst of heaven
:Rolls o'er elysian flowers her amber stream:
:With these that never fade the spirits elect
:Bind their resplendent locks.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], in ''[[q:Samuel Taylor Coleridge#Work Without Hope (1825)|Work Without Hope]]'' (1825), also refers to the herb, likely referencing Milton's earlier work. (ll 7-10 excerpted):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Yet well I ken the banks where Amaranths blow,
:Have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow.
:Bloom, O ye Amaranths! bloom for whom ye may,
:For me ye bloom not! Glide, rich streams, away!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Joachim du Bellay]] mentioned the herb in his &quot;A Vow To Heavenly Venus,&quot; ca. 1500.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:We that with like hearts love, we lovers twain,
:New wedded in the village by thy fane,
:Lady of all chaste love, to thee it is
:We bring these amaranths, these white lilies,
:A sign, and sacrifice; may Love, we pray,
:Like amaranthine flowers, feel no decay;
:Like these cool lilies may our loves remain,
:Perfect and pure, and know not any stain;
:And be our hearts, from this thy holy hour,
:Bound each to each, like flower to wedded flower.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The original spelling is ''amarant''; the more common spelling ''amaranth'' seems to have come from a [[folk etymology]] assuming that the final syllable derives from the Greek word ''anthos'' (&quot;flower&quot;), common in botanical names.

In ancient [[Greece]], the amaranth (also called [[chrysanthemum]] and [[helichrysum]]) was sacred to Ephesian [[Artemis]]. It was supposed to have special healing properties, and as a symbol of immortality was used to decorate images of the gods and [[tomb]]s. In legend, [[Amarynthus]] (a form of Amarantus) was a hunter of Artemis and king of [[Euboea]]; in a village of Amarynthus, of which he was the eponymous hero, there was a famous temple of Artemis Amarynthia or Amarysia (Strabo x. 448; Pausan. i. 31, p.&amp;nbsp;5). It was also widely used by the Chinese for its healing chemicals, curing illnesses such as infections, rashes, and migraines.  The ''&quot;Amarantos&quot;'' is the name of a several-century-old popular Greek folk song:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Look at the amaranth:
:on tall mountains it grows,
:on the very stones and rocks
:and places inaccessible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In novels and fantasy games===
*In the fantasy novel [[Abhorsen]], Amaranth is, along with [[Rosemary]], the smell of Astarael - one of the 9 Bright Shiners and one of the seven who gave themselves to the creation of the Charter (but one of the two who wasn't consumed):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;It's rosemary,&quot; said the Dog shortly. &quot;And there is amaranth, too, though you probably cannot smell it.&quot; &quot;Fidelity in love,&quot; said a small voice from Sam's backpack. &quot;With the flower that never fades. And you still say she is not there?&quot; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*Orson Scott Card's novel ''[[Speaker for the Dead]]'' features a plant called amaranth, genetically modified to survive on the planet Lusitania, where the majority of the story takes place.

*In [[Vampire: The Masquerade]] lore, an amaranth placed on the bed of a vampire was the warning of [[Diablerie]] soon to come. The act of Diablerie was also referred to as &quot;Amaranth&quot;.

===Ships===
*[[Amaranth (barquentine)|''Amaranth'']] was a 1,109 ton 4-masted [[barquentine]] built in 1901 by Capt. Matthew Turner of [[Benicia, California|Benicia]], CA, which sailed between [[Puget Sound]] and [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Gibbs&quot; &gt;

'''''Agapanthus africanus''''' ('''African lily'''; syn. ''Agapanthus umbellatus'') is a native of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in [[South Africa]]. 

It has a short stem bearing a tuft of long, narrow, arching leaves 10–35&amp;nbsp;cm long and 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm broad, and a central flower stalk 25–60&amp;nbsp;cm tall, ending in an umbel of 20-30 white, or bright blue, funnel-shaped [[flower]]s, each flower 2.5–5&amp;nbsp;cm diameter.

==Cultivation==
It was introduced to [[Europe]] at the close of the 17th century as a handsome greenhouse plant, and is hardy outdoors in the south of England and [[Ireland]] if protected from severe frosts. The plants are easy to cultivate and (in areas that have winter) are generally grown in large pots or tubs that can be protected from frost.

Several [[cultivar]]s are known, such as 'Albus' (with white flowers), 'Sapphire' (dark blue flowers), 'Aureus' (leaves striped with yellow), and 'Variegatus' (leaves almost entirely white with a few green bands). There are also double-flowered and larger- and smaller-flowered cultivars.

During the summer they require plenty of water and are very effective on the margins of lakes or by running streams, where they thrive. They may be propagated from offsets or by dividing the rootstock in early spring or autumn.

[[Image:MaskOfAgamemnon.jpg|thumb|right|The so-called '[[Mask of Agamemnon]]' which was discovered by [[Heinrich Schliemann]] in 1876 at [[Mycenae]] (whether it represents an individual, and if so, whom, remains unknown)&lt;/center&gt;]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Agamemnon''' ([[Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: '''{{polytonic|Ἀγαμέμνων}}'''; [[modern Greek]]: Αγαμέμνονας, &quot;leader of the assembly&quot;) was the son of King [[Atreus]] of Mycenae and Queen [[Aerope]]; the brother of [[Menelaus]] and the husband of [[Clytemnestra]]; mythical legends make him the king of [[Mycenae]] or [[Argos]], thought to be different names for the same area.  When [[Helen]], the wife of Menelaus, was abducted by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] of [[Troy]], Agamemnon was the commander of the Greeks in the ensuing [[Trojan War]].

Upon Agamemnon's return from Troy he was murdered (according to the fullest version of the oldest surviving account, [[Odyssey]] Book 11, l.409f.) by Aegisthus, the lover of his wife Clytemnestra. In old versions of the story: &quot;The scene of the murder, when it is specified, is usually the house of Aegisthus, who has not taken up residence in Agamemnon's palace, and it involves an ambush and the deaths of Agamemnon's followers too&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Aeschylus (1986) ''Choephori''; introduction by A. F. Garvie, Oxford U. P., p. x&lt;/ref&gt; In some later versions Clytemnestra herself does the killing, or they do it together, in his own home.

==Early life==
[[Atreus]], Agamemnon's father, murdered the children of his twin brother [[Thyestes]] and fed them to him after discovering Thyestes' adultery with his wife Aerope. Thyestes fathered [[Aegisthus]] with his own daughter, and this son vowed gruesome revenge on Atreus' children. Aegisthus successfully murdered Atreus and restored his father to the throne. Aegisthus took possession of the throne of Mycenae and ruled jointly with Thyestes. During this period Agamemnon and his brother, [[Menelaus]], took refuge with [[Tyndareus]], King of [[Sparta]]. There they respectively married Tyndareus' daughters [[Clytemnestra]] and [[Helen]].  Agamemnon and Clytemnestra had four children: one son, [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]], and three daughters, [[Iphigenia]], [[Electra]] and [[Chrysothemis]]. Menelaus succeeded Tyndareus in Sparta, while Agamemnon, with his brother's assistance, drove out Aegisthus and Thyestes to recover his father's kingdom. He extended his dominion by conquest and became the most powerful prince in Greece.

Agamemnon's family history had been marred by [[rape]], [[murder]], [[incest]], and treachery, consequences of the heinous crime perpetrated by their ancestor, [[Tantalus]], and then of a curse placed upon [[Pelops]], son of Tantalus, by Myrtilus, whom he had murdered. Thus misfortune hounded successive generations of the [[House of Atreus]], until atoned by [[Orestes]] in a court of justice held jointly by human and gods.

===Trojan War===
{{Main|Trojan War}}

Agamemnon gathered the reluctant Greek forces to sail for [[Troy]]. Preparing to depart from [[Aulis]], which was a port in [[Boeotia]], Agamemnon's army incurred the wrath of the goddess [[Artemis]]. There are several reasons throughout myth for such wrath: in [[Aeschylus]]' play ''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]'', Artemis is angry for the young men who will die at Troy, whereas in [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', Agamemnon has slain an animal sacred to Artemis, and subsequently boasted that he was Artemis' equal in hunting. Misfortunes, including a [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and a lack of wind, prevented the army from sailing. Finally, the prophet [[Calchas]] announced that the wrath of the goddess could only be propitiated by the sacrifice of Agamemnon's daughter [[Iphigenia]]. Classical dramatisations differ on how willing either father or daughter were to this fate, some include such trickery as claiming she was to be married to [[Achilles]], but Agamemnon did eventually sacrifice Iphigenia. Her death appeased Artemis, and the Greek army set out for Troy. Several alternatives to the [[human sacrifice]] have been presented in Greek mythology. Other sources, such as ''Iphigenia at Aulis'', claim that Agamemnon was prepared to kill his daughter, but that Artemis accepted a deer in her place, and whisked her away to Taurus in [[Crimea]]. [[Hesiod]] said she became the goddess [[Hecate]].

Agamemnon was the commander-in-chief of the Greeks during the Trojan War. During the fighting, Agamemnon killed [[Antiphus]] and 15 other Trojan soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], &quot;[[Fabulae]]&quot; 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Agamemnon's [[teamster]], [[Halaesus]], later fought with [[Aeneas]] in [[Italy]]. The ''[[Iliad]]'' tells the story of the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles in the final year of the war. Agamemnon took an attractive slave, [[Briseis]],  one of the spoils of war, from Achilles. Achilles, the greatest warrior of the age, withdrew from battle in revenge and nearly cost the Greek armies the war.

Although not the equal of Achilles in bravery, Agamemnon was a  representative of kingly authority. As commander-in-chief, he summoned the princes to the council and led the army in battle. He took the field himself, and performed many heroic deeds until he was wounded and forced to withdraw to his tent. His chief fault was his overwhelming haughtiness; an over-exalted opinion of his position that led him to insult [[Chryses]] and Achilles, thereby bringing great disaster upon the Greeks.

After the capture of Troy, [[Cassandra]], doomed prophetess and daughter of [[Priam]], fell to Agamemnon's lot in the distribution of the prizes of war.

==Return to Greece==

[[Image:Aegisthus.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Orestes]] slaying [[Aegisthus]]]]

After a stormy voyage, Agamemnon and Cassandra either landed in [[Argolis]], or were blown off course and landed in Aegisthus' country.  [[Clytemnestra]], Agamemnon's wife, had taken [[Aegisthus]], son of [[Thyestes]], as a lover.  When Agamemnon came home he was slain by either Aegisthus (in the oldest versions of the story) or Clytemnestra.  According to the accounts given by [[Pindar]] and the tragedians, Agamemnon was slain in a bath by his wife alone, a blanket of cloth or a net having first been thrown over him to prevent resistance.  Clytemnestra also killed Cassandra.  Her jealousy of Cassandra, and her wrath at the sacrifice of Iphigenia and at Agamemnon's having gone to war over [[Helen of Troy]], are said to have been the motives for her crime.   Aegisthus and Clytemnestra then ruled Agamemnon's kingdom for a time,  Aegisthus claiming his right of revenge for Agamemnon's father Atreus having fed Thyestes his own children (Thyestes then crying out &quot;So perish all the race of Pleisthenes!&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Aeschylus, Aga., ln. 1602&lt;/ref&gt; thus explaining Aegisthus' action as justified by his father's curse).  Agamemnon's son [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] later avenged his father's murder, with the help or encouragement of his sister [[Electra]], by murdering Aegisthus and Clytemnestra (his own mother), thereby inciting the wrath of the [[Erinyes]] ([[English language|English]]: the Furies), winged goddesses who tracked down egregiously impious wrongdoers with their hounds' noses and drove them to insanity.

== Genealogy ==
[[Image:GenealogyAgamemnon.jpg|thumb|center|600px|Genealogy of Agamemnon]]

==Other stories==
[[Athenaeus]] tells a story of how Agamemnon mourned the loss of his friend Argynnus, when he drowned in the [[Cephisus]] river. He buried him, honored with a tomb and a shrine to [[Aphrodite]] Argynnis. &lt;ref&gt;The Deipnosophists of Athenaeus of Naucratis, Book XIII Concerning Women, p.&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/ref&gt; This episode is also found in [[Clement of Alexandria]], &lt;ref&gt;Protrepticus II.38.2&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Stephen of Byzantium]] ''(Kopai'' and ''Argunnos),'' and in [[Propertius]], III with minor variations.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Harold Edgeworth &amp; Barber, Eric Arthur, eds. (1933) ''The Elegies of Propertius''. Oxford: Clarendon Press; p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The fortunes of Agamemnon have formed the subject of numerous [[tragedy|tragedies]], ancient and modern, the most famous being the [[Oresteia]] of [[Aeschylus]]. In the legends of the [[Peloponnesus]], Agamemnon was regarded as the highest type of a powerful monarch, and in [[Sparta]] he was worshipped under the title of ''[[Agamemnon (Zeus)|Zeus Agamemnon]]''. His tomb was pointed out among the ruins of Mycenae and at [[Amyclae]].

Another account makes him the son of [[Pleisthenes]] (the son or father of [[Atreus]]), who is said to have been Aerope's first husband.

In works of art there is considerable resemblance between the representations of [[Zeus]], king of the gods, and Agamemnon, king of men. He is generally depicted with a [[sceptre]] and [[diadem]], conventional attributes of kings.

Agamemnon's mare was named Aetha.  She was also one of two horses driven by Menelaus at the funeral games of Patroclus.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece''; 5.8.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. ''Amores'', 21&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Aga Khan]] I''' ({{lang-fa|'''آغا خان اوّل'''}}; {{lang|fa-Latn|'''Āghā Khān-i Awwal'''}} or, less commonly but more correctly  ({{lang-fa|'''آقا خان اوّل'''}}; {{lang|fa-Latn|'''Āqā Khān-i Awwal'''}}), was the title accorded to '''Hasan Ali Shah''' ({{lang-fa|'''حسن علی شاه'''}}; {{lang|fa-Latn|'''Ḥasan ‘Alī Shāh'''}}; 1804 in Kahak, [[Iran]]&amp;nbsp;– 1881 in [[Bombay]], [[India]]), the governor of Kirman, 46th Imam of the [[Nizari]] [[Ismaili]] Muslims, and prominent Muslim leader in Iran and later in the Indian Subcontinent.

==Early Life and Family==
The Imam Hasan Ali Shah was born in 1804 in [[Kahak]], [[Iran]] to [[Shah Khalil Allah]], the 45th Ismaili Imam, and Bibi Sarkara, the daughter of Muhammad Sadiq Mahallati (d. 1815), a poet and a [[Ni‘mat Allahi]] Sufi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary-Ismailis&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Ismā‘īlīs: Their History and Doctrines| last=Daftary| first=Farhad| year=1990| pages=503–516| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-42974-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shah Khalil Allah moved to Yazd in 1815, probably out of concern for his Indian followers, who used to travel to Persia to see their Imam and for whom Yazd was a much closer and safer destination than Kahak. Meanwhile, his wife and children continued to live in Kahak off the revenues obtained from the family holdings in the Mahallat ({{lang|fa-Latn|Maḥallāt}}) region. Two years later, in 1817, Shah Khalil Allah was killed during a conflict between some of his followers and local shopkeepers. He was succeeded by his eldest son Hasan Ali Shah, also known as Muhammad Hasan, who became the 46th Imam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary-Ismailis&quot;/&gt;

Unfortunately, the family was left unprovided for after a conflict between the local Nizaris and Imani Khan Farahani, who had been married to one of the late Imam's daughters Shah Bibi&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cSO9zh61AGEC&amp;pg=PA464&amp;lpg=PA464&amp;dq=Imani+Khan+Farahani,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h5DFHybso1&amp;sig=M6JzaXpFDZWFRx0NDC9ReBLNC18&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KrnYTOqjEo_GvQOaytyaCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Imani%20Khan%20Farahani%2C&amp;f=false The Ismailis &amp; their history]&lt;/ref&gt; and who had been in charge of the Imam's land holdings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary-Ismailis&quot;/&gt; The young Imam and his mother moved to Qumm, but their financial situation worsened. The Imam Hasan Ali Shah's mother decided to go to the Qajar court in Tehran to obtain justice for her husband's death and was eventually successful. Those who had been involved in the Shah Khalil Allah's murder were punished and the Persian king [[Fath Ali Shah]] increased Hasan Ali Shah's land holdings in the Mahallat region and gave him one of his daughters, Sarv-i Jahan Khanum, in marriage. Fath Ali Shah also appointed Hasan Ali Shah as governor of [[Qumm]] and bestowed upon him the honorific of Aga Khan. Hasan Ali Shah thus become known as Aga Khan Mahallati, and the title of Aga Khan was inherited by his successors. Aga Khan I's mother later moved to India where she died in 1851. Until Fath Ali Shah's death in 1834, the Imam Hasan Ali Shah enjoyed a quiet life and was held in high esteem at the Qajar court.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary-Ismailis&quot;/&gt;

==Governorship of Kirman==
[[Image:Aga Khan I 2.jpg|left|200px]]
Soon after the accession of Muhammad Shah Qajar to the throne of his grandfather, Fath Ali Shah, the Imam Hasan Ali Shah was appointed governor of [[Kirman]] in 1835.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary-Ismailis&quot;/&gt; At the time, Kirman was held by the rebellious sons of Shuja al-Saltana, a pretender to the Qajar throne. The area was also frequently raided by the Afghans. Hasan Ali Shah managed to restore order in Kirman, as well as in Bam and Narmishair, which were also held by rebellious groups. Hasan Ali Shah sent a report of his success to Tehran, but did not receive any compensation for his achievements. Despite the service he rendered to the Qajar government, Hasan Ali Shah was dismissed from the governorship of Kirman in 1837, less than two years after his arrival there, and was replaced by Firuz Mirza Nusrat al-Dawla, a younger brother of Muhammad Shah Qajar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary-Ismailis&quot;/&gt; Refusing to accept his dismissal, Hasan Ali Shah withdrew with his forces to the citadel at Bam. Along with his two brothers, he made preparations to resist the government forces that were sent against him. He was besieged at Bam for some fourteen months. When it was clear that continuing the resistance was of little use, Hasan Ali Shah sent one of his brothers to Shiraz in order to speak to the governor of Fars to intervene on his behalf and arrange for safe passage out of Kirman. With the governor having interceded, Hasan Ali Shah surrendered and emerged from the citadel of Bam only to be double-crossed. He was seized and his possessions were plundered by the government troops. Hasan Ali Shah and his dependents were sent to Kirman and remained as prisoners there for eight months. He was eventually allowed to go to Tehran near the end of 1838-39 where he was able to present his case before the Shah. The Shah pardoned him on the condition that he return peacefully to Mahallat. Hasan Ali Shah remained in Mahallat for about two years. He managed to gather an army in Mahallat which alarmed Muhammad Shah, who travelled to [[Delijan]] near [[Mahallat]] to determine the truth of the reports about Hasan Ali Shah. Hasan Ali Shah was on a hunting trip at the time, but he sent a messenger to request permission of the monarch to go to Mecca for the hajj pilgrimage. Permission was given, and Hasan Ali Shah's mother and a few relatives were sent to Najaf and other holy cities in Iraq in which the shrines of his ancestors, the Shiite Imams are found.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary-Ismailis&quot;/&gt;

Prior to leaving Mahallat, Hasan Ali Shah equipped himself with letters appointing him to the governorship of Kirman. Accompanied by his brothers, nephews and other relatives, as well as many followers, he left for Yazd, where he intended to meet some of his local followers. Hasan Ali Shah sent the documents reinstating him to the position of governor of Kirman to Bahman Mirza Baha al-Dawla, the governor of Yazd. Bahman Mirza offered Hasan Ali Shah lodging in the city, but Hasan Ali Shah declined, indicating that he wished to visit his followers living around Yazd. Hajji Mirza Aqasi sent a messenger to Bahman Mirza to inform him of the spuriousness of Hasan Ali Shah's documents and a battle between Bahman Mīrzā and Hasan Ali Shah broke out in which Bahman Mirza was defeated. Other minor battles were won by Hasan Ali Shah before he arrived in Shahr-i Babak, which he intended to use as his base for capturing Kirman. At the time of his arrival in Shahr-i Babak, a formal local governor was engaged in a campaign to drive out the Afghans from the city's citadel, and Hasan Ali Shah joined him in forcing the Afghans to surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary-Ismailis&quot;/&gt;

Soon after March 1841, Hasan Ali Shah set out for Kirman. He managed to defeat a government force consisting of 4,000 men near Dashtab, and continued to win a number of victories before stopping at Bam for a time. Soon, a government force of 24,000 men forced Hasan Ali Shah to flee from Bam to Rigan on the border of Baluchistan, where he suffered a decisive defeat. Hasan Ali Shah decided to escape to Afghanistan, accompanied by his brothers and many soldiers and servants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary-Ismailis&quot;/&gt;

==Afghanistan==
After arriving in Afghanistan in 1841, Hasan Ali Shah proceeded to Kandahar which had been occupied by an Anglo-Indian army in 1839. A close relationship developed between Hasan Ali Shah and the British, which coincided with the final years of the First Anglo-Afghan War (1838–1842). After his arrival, Hasan Ali Shah wrote to Sir William Macnaghten, discussing his plans to seize and govern Harat on behalf of the British. Although the proposal seemed to have been approved, the plans of the British were thwarted by the uprising of Dost Muhammad's son Muhammad Akbar Khan, who defeated the British-Indian garrison on its retreat from Kabul in January 1842. The uprising spread to Kandahar where the Afghans were in active hunt of the &quot;infidel&quot; Hasan Ali Shah. Hasan Ali Shah managed to escape and helped to evacuate the British forces from Kandahar in July 1842. The Afghans in Kandahar claimed that they would not rest until they had captured the &quot;traitor of the Ahl ul Beit.&quot;

==Sindh, Pakistan==
Hasan Ali Shah soon proceeded to Sind, where he rendered further services to the British. The British were able to annex Sind and for his services, Hasan Ali Shah received an annual pension of £2,000 from General Charles Napier, the British conqueror of Sind with whom he had a good relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary-Ismailis&quot;/&gt;

Hasan Ali Shah also aided the British militarily and diplomatically in their attempts to subjugate Baluchistan. He became the target of a Baluchi raid, likely in retaliation for his helping the British and to whom they considered a traitor and a &quot;kufar&quot; or infidel; however, Hasan Ali Shah continued to aid the British, hoping that they would arrange for his safe return to his ancestral lands in Persia, where many members of his family remained.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary-Ismailis&quot;/&gt;

==Bombay==
In October 1844, Hasan Ali Shah left Sind for Bombay, passing through Cutch and Kathiawar where he spent some time visiting the communities of his followers in the area. After arriving in Bombay in February 1846, the Persian government demanded his extradition from India. The British refused and only agreed to transfer Hasan Ali Shah’s residence to Calcutta, where it would be more difficult for him to launch new attacks against the Persian government. The British also negotiated the safe return of Hasan Ali Shah to Persia, which was in accordance with his own wish. The government agreed to Hasan Ali Shah's return provided that he would avoid passing through Baluchistan and Kirman and that he was to settle peacefully in Mahallat. Hasan Ali Shah was eventually forced to leave for Calcutta in April 1847, where he remained until he received news of the death of Muhammad Shah Qajar. Hasan Ali Shah left for Bombay and the British attempted to obtain permission for his return to Persia. Although some of his lands were restored to the control of his relatives, his safe return could not be arranged, and Hasan Ali Shah was forced to remain a permanent resident of India. While in India, Hasan Ali Shah continued his close relationship with the British, and was even visited by the Prince of Wales when the future King Edward VII was on a state visit to India. The British came to address Hasan Ali Shah as His Highness. Hasan Ali Shah received protection from the British government in British India as the spiritual head of an important Muslim community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary-Ismailis&quot;/&gt;

==Khoja Reassumption/Dispute==
The vast majority of his [[Khoja]] Ismaili followers in India welcomed him warmly, but some dissident members, sensing their loss of prestige with the arrival of the Imam, wished to maintain control over communal properties.  Because of this, Hasan Ali Shah decided to secure a pledge of loyalty from the members of the community to himself and to the Ismaili form of Islam. Although most of the members of the community signed a document issued by Hasan Ali Shah summarizing the practices of the Ismailis, a group of dissenting Khojas surprisingly asserted that the community had always been Sunni. This group was outcast by the unanimous vote of all the Khojas assembled in Bombay. In 1866, these dissenters filed a suit in the Bombay High Court against Hasan Ali Shah, claiming that the Khojas had been Sunni Muslims from the very beginning. The case, commonly referred to as the Aga Khan Case, was heard by [[Joseph Arnould|Sir Joseph Arnould]]. The hearing lasted several weeks, and included testimony from Hasan Ali Shah himself. After reviewing the history of the community, Justice Arnould gave a definitive and detailed judgement against the plaintiffs and in favour of Hasan Ali Shah and other defendants. The judgement was significant in that it legally established the status of the Khojas as a community referred to as Shia Imami Ismailis, and of Hasan Ali Shah as the spiritual head of that community. Hasan Ali Shah's authority thereafter was not seriously challenged again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary-Ismailis&quot;/&gt;

==Final years==
Hasan Ali Shah spent his final years in Bombay with occasional visits to Pune. Maintaining the traditions of the Iranian nobility to which he belonged, he kept excellent stables and became a well-known figure at the Bombay racecourse. Hasan Ali Shah died after an imamate of sixty-four years in April 1881. He was buried in a specially built shrine at Hasanabad in the Mazagaon area of Bombay. He was survived by three sons and five daughters. Hasan Ali Shah was succeeded as Imam by his eldest son Aqa Ali Shah, who became [[Aga Khan II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary-Ismailis&quot;/&gt;

'''Sultan Muhammed Shah, Aga Khan III''', [[Order of the Star of India|GCSI]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|GCMG]], [[Order of the Indian Empire|GCIE]], [[Royal Victorian Order|GCVO]], [[Imperial Privy Council|PC]] (November 2, 1877 &amp;ndash; July 11, 1957) was the 48th [[Shia Imam|Imam]] of the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Ismaili]] [[Muslim]]s. He was one of the founders and the first president of the [[All-India Muslim League]], and served as President of the [[League of Nations]] from 1937-38. He was nominated to represent India to the League of Nations in 1932.

== Early life ==
He was born in [[Karachi]] (then under [[British Empire|British]] colonial rule), to [[Aga Khan II]] and his third wife,&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary-Ismailis&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Ismā‘īlīs: Their History and Doctrines| last=Daftary| first=Farhad| year=1990| pages=518| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-42974-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nawab A'lia Shamsul-Muluk, who was a granddaughter of [[Fath Ali Shah]] of Persia ([[Qajar dynasty]]).

Under the care of his mother, he was given not only that religious and Oriental education which his position as the religious leader of the [[Ismailis]] made indispensable, but a sound European training, a boon denied to his father and paternal grandfather. He also attended [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Aga Khan, Fashionable Londoner, Holds Enormous Power in Islam&quot;, The New York Times, July 8, 1923, p. XX5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1885, at the age of seven, he succeeded his father as [[Shia Imam|Imam]] of the [[Shi'a]] [[Isma'ili]] [[Muslim]]s.

The Aga Khan traveled in distant parts of the world to receive the homage of his followers, and with the object either of settling differences or of advancing their welfare by pecuniary help and personal advice and guidance.  The distinction of a [[Order of the Indian Empire|Knight Commander of the Indian Empire]] was conferred upon him by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1897 (and later Knight Grand Commander in 1902 by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]) and he received like recognition for his public services from the German emperor, the sultan of Turkey, the shah of [[Iran|Persia]] and other potentates.

In 1906, the Aga Khan was a founding member and first president of the [[All India Muslim League]], a political party which pushed for the creation of an independent Muslim nation in the north west regions of South Asia, then under British colonial rule, and later established the country of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.

In 1934, he was made a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and served as a member of the [[League of Nations]] (1934–37), becoming the President of the League of Nations in 1937.

He was made a &quot;Knight of the Indian Empire&quot; by Queen Victoria, a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire by Edward VII (1902), and a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India by George V (1912). He was appointed a GCMG in 1923.

== Imamate==
Under the  leadership of Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan III, the first half of the 20th century was a period of significant development for the Ismā'īlī community. Numerous institutions for social and economic development were established in South Asia and in East Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaftaryShort1998p199&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Daftary |first=Farhad |title=A Short History of the Ismailis |year=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh, UK |isbn=0-7486-0687-4 |pages=199–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ismailis have marked the Jubilees of their Imāms with public celebrations, which are symbolic affirmations of the ties that link the [[Ismāʿīlī]] Imām and his followers. Although the Jubilees have no religious significance, they serve to reaffirm the Imamat's worldwide commitment to the improvement of the quality of human life, especially in the developing countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaftaryShort1998p199&quot;/&gt;

The Jubilees of Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan III, are well remembered. During his 72 years of Imamat (1885–1957), the community celebrated his Golden (1937), Diamond (1946) and Platinum (1954) Jubilees. To show their appreciation and affection, the Ismā'īliyya weighed their Imam in gold, diamonds and, symbolically, in platinum, respectively, the proceeds of which were used to further develop major social welfare and development institutions in Asia and Africa.

In [[India]] and later [[Pakistan]], social development institutions were established, in the words of Aga Khan, &quot;for the relief of humanity&quot;. They included institutions such as the Diamond Jubilee Trust and the Platinum Jubilee Investments Limited which in turn assisted the growth of various types of cooperative societies. [[Aga Khan School|Diamond Jubilee Schools]] for girls were established throughout the remote Northern Areas of what is now Pakistan. In addition, scholarship programs, established at the time of the Golden Jubilee to give assistance to needy students, were progressively expanded. In [[East Africa]], major social welfare and economic development institutions were established. Those involved in social welfare included the accelerated development of schools and community centres, and a modern, fully-equipped [[Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi|hospital]] in [[Nairobi]]. Among the economic development institutions established in East Africa were companies such as the Diamond Jubilee Investment Trust (now Diamond Trust of Kenya) and the Jubilee Insurance Company, which are quoted on the Nairobi Stock Exchange and have become major players in national development.

Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah also introduced organizational forms that gave Ismāʿīlī communities the means to structure and regulate their own affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaftaryShort1998p199&quot;/&gt; These were built on the Muslim tradition of a communitarian ethic on the one hand, and responsible individual conscience with freedom to negotiate one's own moral commitment and destiny on the other. In 1905 he ordained the first Ismā'īlī Constitution for the social governance of the community in East Africa. The new administration for the Community's affairs was organized into a hierarchy of councils at the local, national, and regional levels. The constitution also set out rules in such matters as marriage, divorce and inheritance, guidelines for mutual cooperation and support among Ismā'īlīs, and their interface with other communities. Similar constitutions were promulgated in the South Asia, and all were periodically revised to address emerging needs and circumstances in diverse settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaftaryShort1998p199&quot;/&gt;

Following the [[World War II|Second World War]], far-reaching social, economic and political changes profoundly affected a number of areas where Ismāʿīlīs resided. In [[1947]], British rule in the South Asia was replaced by the sovereign, independent nations of [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and later [[Bangladesh]], resulting in the migration of millions people and significant loss of life and property. In the [[Middle East]], the  [[Suez crisis]]  of 1956 as well as the preceding crisis in [[Iran]], demonstrated the sharp upsurge of nationalism, which was as assertive of the region's social and economic aspirations as of its political independence. Africa was also set on its course to [[decolonization]], swept by what [[Harold Macmillan]], the then [[British Prime Minister]], aptly termed the &quot;wind of change&quot;. By the early 1960s, most of East and Central Africa, where the majority of the [[Ismāʿīlī]] population on the continent resided  including [[Tanganyika]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]] and [[Zaire]], had attained their political independence.

== Race horse owner ==
He was an owner of thoroughbred racing horses, including a record equalling five winners of the [[Epsom Derby]], and a total of sixteen winners of [[British Classic Races]]. He was [[British flat racing Champion Owner]] thirteen times.  According to [[Ben Pimlott]], biographer of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], the Aga Khan presented Her Majesty with a [[filly]] called ''Astrakhan'', who won at [[Hurst Park Racecourse]] in 1950.

== Equestrianism ==
In 1926, the Aga Khan gave a cup (the [[Aga Khan Trophy]]) to be awarded to the winners of an international team [[show jumping]] competition held at the annual horse show of the [[Royal Dublin Society]] in Dublin, Ireland every first week in August.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dublinhorseshow.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=22&amp;Itemid=34 The Aga Khan Trophy], Dublin Horse Show, accessed July 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It attracts competitors from all of the main show jumping nations and is carried live on Irish national television.

== Marriages and children ==
* He married, on November 2, 1896, in [[Poona]], India, [[Shahzadi Begum]], his first cousin and a granddaughter of [[Aga Khan I]].

* He married 1908,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ismaili.net/histoire/history08/history833.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cleope Teresa Magliano]] (1888–1926), a dancer with the Ballet Opera of Monte Carlo. They had two sons: Giuseppe Mahdi Khan (d. February 1911) and [[Prince Aly Khan|Ali Solomone Khan]] (1911–1960)&lt;ref&gt;According to &quot;Memoirs of Aga Khan: World Enough and Time&quot; (London: Cassel &amp; Company, 1954), &quot;In the year One thousand nine hundred and eight I was married to CLEOPE TERESA MAGLIANO according to the Muta form of marriage...&quot;. According to [[Anne Edwards]]' history of the Aga Khans (&quot;Throne of Gold: The Lives of the Aga Khans&quot;, NY: William Morrow, 1996), Ali Solomone Khan's birth certificate states that his mother was considered single at the time of his birth, which was recorded as illegitimate. However, Islamic law states that a child born from a Muta marriage is considered legitimate. According to the Aga Khan's memoirs, he legally married Teresa Magliano in 1923, after the death of his first wife. Teresa, who reportedly had converted to Islam prior to the legal wedding in North Africa and was known as Princess Aga Khan, died in 1926, following an operation on December 1, 1926 (&quot;Aga Khan's Wife Dies As He Buys Big Gem&quot;, The New York Times, December 2, 1926, p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

* He married, on December 7, 1929 (civil), in [[Aix-les-Bains]], France, and December 13, 1929 (religious), in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], India, [[Andrée Joséphine Carron]] (1898–1976). A co-owner of a dressmaking shop in Paris, she became known as Princess Andrée Aga Khan. She did not convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Memoirs of Aga Khan&quot; Aga Khan III, p. 207, Cassell &amp; Co Ltd, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; By this marriage, he had one son, Prince [[Sadruddin Aga Khan]], in 1933-2003.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Aga Khan Again a Father&quot;, The New York Times, January 18, 1933, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple were divorced in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Princess Andrée&quot;, The New York Times, December 30, 1976, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

* He married, on October 9, 1944, in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, [[Begum Om Habibeh Aga Khan|Yvonne Blanche Labrousse]] (February 15, 1906 - July 1, 2000). According to an interview she gave to an Egyptian journalist, her first name was Yvonne, though she is referred to as Yvette in most published references. The daughter of a tram conductor and a dressmaker, she was working as the Aga Khan's social secretary at the time of their marriage. She had been &quot;Miss Lyon 1929&quot; and &quot;Miss France 1930&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Aga Khan Marries&quot;, The New York Times, October 10, 1944, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; She converted to Islam and became known as Umm Habiba (Little Mother of the Beloved). In 1954, her husband named her &quot;Mata Salamat&quot; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Begum Aga Khan III&quot;, Daily Telegraph, Issue 45115, July 3, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
He wrote a number of books and papers two of which are of immense importance namely (1).'''India in Transition''', about the prepartition politics of India and (2).'''World Enough &amp; Time - The Memoirs of Sir Sultan Mohammed Shah, Aga Khan III''', his autobiography.

== Death and succession ==
[[File:Aga Khan III, Vanity Fair, 1904-11-10.jpg|200px|thumb|&quot;The Aga Khan&quot;. Caricature by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] published in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]] in 1904.]]
Aga Khan III was succeeded as Aga Khan by his grandson [[Aga Khan IV|Karim Aga Khan]], who is the present [[Shia Imam|Imam]] of the [[Ismaili]] [[Muslim]]s. At the time of his death on July 11, 1957, his family members were in [[Versoix]]. A solicitor brought the will of the Aga Khan III from London to Geneva and read it before the family:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Ever since the time of my ancestor Ali, the first Imam, that is to say over a period of thirteen hundred years, it has always been the tradition of our family that each Imam chooses his successor at his absolute and unfettered discretion from amongst any of his descendants, whether they be sons or remote male issue and in these circumstances and in view of the fundamentally altered conditions in the world in very recent years due to the great changes which have taken place including the discoveries of atomic science, I am convinced that it is in the best interest of the Shia Muslim Ismailia Community that I should be succeeded by a young man who has been brought up and developed during recent years and in the midst of the new age and who brings a new outlook on life to his office as Imam. For these reasons, I appoint my grandson Karim, the son of my own son, Aly Salomone Khan to succeed to the title of Aga Khan and to the Imam and Pir of all Shia Ismailian followers.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He is buried in [[Aswan]], [[Egypt]] at the Mausoleum of Aga Khan {{coord|24.088254|32.878722}}.

==Biography==
Agassiz was born in [[Neuchâtel]], [[Switzerland]] and emigrated to the [[United States]] with his father in 1849. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1855, subsequently studying [[engineering]] and [[chemistry]], and taking the degree of [[bachelor of science]] at the [[Lawrence scientific school]] of the same institution in 1857; and in 1859 became an assistant in the [[United States Coast Survey]].

Thenceforward he became a specialist in marine [[ichthyology]], but devoted much time to the investigation, superintendence and exploitation of [[mining|mine]]s. 
[[E. J. Hulbert]], a friend of Agassiz's brother-in-law, [[Quincy Adams Shaw]], had discovered a rich copper lode known as the [[Calumet conglomerate]] on the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]] [[Lake Superior]] in [[Michigan]]. He persuaded them, along with a group of friends, to purchase a controlling interest in the mines, which later became known as the [[Calumet and Hecla Mining Company]] based in [[Calumet, Michigan]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1862.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the summer of 1866, Agassiz worked as an assistant in the museum of natural history that his father founded at Harvard. That summer, he took a trip to see the mines for himself and he afterwards became treasurer of the enterprise. 

Over the winter of 1866 and early 1867, mining operations began to falter due to the difficulty of extracting copper from the conglomerate. Hulbert had sold his interests in the mines and had moved on to other ventures. But Agassiz refused to give up hope for the mines, and he returned to the mines in March 1867 with his wife and young son. At that time, Calumet was a remote settlement, virtually inaccessible during the winter and very far removed from civilization even during the summer. With insufficient supplies at the mines, Agassiz struggled to maintain order, while back in Boston, Shaw was saddled with debt and the collapse of their interests. Shaw obtained financial assistance from John Simpkins, the selling agent for the enterprise to continue operations. 

Agassiz continued to live at Calumet, making gradual progress in stabilising the mining operations, such that he was able to leave the mines under the control of a general manager and return to Boston in 1868 before winter closed navigation.

The mines continued to prosper and in May 1871, several mines were consolidated to form the [[Calumet and Hecla Mining Company]] with Shaw as its first president. In August, 1871, Shaw &quot;retired&quot; to the board of directors and Agassiz became president, a position he held until his death.

Agassiz was a major factor in the mine's continued success and visited the mines twice a year. He innovated by installing a giant engine, known as the Superior, which was able to lift 24 tons of rock from a depth of 1,200&amp;nbsp;metres (4,000&amp;nbsp;ft). He also built a railroad and dredged a channel to navigable waters. However, after a time the mines did not require his full-time year-round attention and he returned to his interests in natural history at Harvard.

Out of his copper fortune, he gave some US$500,000 to Harvard for the museum of comparative [[zoology]] and other purposes.

In 1875 he surveyed [[Lake Titicaca]], [[Peru]], examined the [[copper]] mines of Peru and [[Chile]], and made a collection of Peruvian antiquities for the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]], of which he was [[curator]] from 1874 to 1885.  He assisted [[Charles Wyville Thomson]] in the examination and classification of the collections of the 1872 [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' Expedition]], and wrote the ''Review of the Echini'' (2 vols., 1872–1874) in the reports.

Between 1877 and 1880 he took part in the three [[dredging]] expeditions of the steamer ''Blake'' of the Coast Survey, and presented a full account of them in two volumes (1888). 

In 1896 Agassiz visited [[Fiji]] and [[Queensland]] and inspected the [[Great Barrier Reef]], publishing a paper on the subject in 1898.

Of Agassiz's other writings on marine zoology, most are contained in the bulletins and memoirs of the museum of comparative zoology; but he published in 1865, with [[Elizabeth Cary Agassiz]], his stepmother, ''Seaside Studies in Natural History'', a work at once exact and stimulating, and in 1871 ''Marine Animals of Massachusetts Bay''.

Agassiz served as a president of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], which since 1913 has awarded the [[Alexander Agassiz Medal]] in his memory. He died in 1910 on board the [[RMS Adriatic (1907)|RMS ''Adriatic'']] en route to New York from [[Southampton]].

[[File:Feuerbach symposium.jpg|thumb| This painting by Anselm Feuerbach reimagines a scene from Plato's ''Symposium,'' in which the tragedian Agathon welcomes the drunken Alcibiades into his home. 1869.]]

'''Agathon''' ({{lang-el|Ἀγάθων}}; ''gen''.: Ἀγάθωνος) (ca. 448&amp;ndash;400 BC) was an [[Athens|Athenian]] tragic poet whose works, up to the present moment, have been lost.  He is best known for his appearance in Plato's ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]],'' which describes the [[Symposium|banquet]] given to celebrate his obtaining a prize for his first tragedy at the [[Lenaia]] in (416).  He is also a prominent character in [[Aristophanes]]' comedy the ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]''.  Agathon was the life-long companion of [[Pausanias (Athenian)|Pausanias]], with whom he appears in both the ''Symposium'' and in Plato's ''Protagoras''.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Leveque, ''Agathon'' (Paris: Societe d'Edition Les Belles Lettres, 1955), pp. 163-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Together with Pausanias, Agathon later moved to the court of [[Archelaus I of Macedon|Archelaus]], king of [[Macedon]], who was recruiting playwrights; it is here that he probably died around 401 BC. Agathon introduced certain innovations into the Greek theater: [[Aristotle]] tells us that the characters and plot of his ''Antheus'' were original and not, as was usual at the time, borrowed from mythological subjects.&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'' 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Agathon was also the first playwright to write choral parts which were apparently independent from the main plot of his plays.

Agathon is portrayed by Plato as a handsome young man, well dressed, of polished manners, courted by the fashion, wealth and wisdom of [[Athens]], and dispensing hospitality with ease and refinement. The [[epideictic]] speech in praise of love which Agathon recites in the ''Symposium'' is full of beautiful but artificial rhetorical expressions, and has led some scholars to believe he may have been a student of [[Gorgias]].   In the ''Symposium,'' Agathon is presented as the friend of the comic poet Aristophanes, but this alleged friendship did not prevent Aristophanes from harshly criticizing Agathon in at least two of his comic plays: the ''Thesmophoriazousae'' and the (now lost) ''Gerytades''.  In a later play, the ''Frogs,'' Aristophanes softens his criticisms, but even so it may be only for the sake of punning on Agathon's name (ἁγαθός = &quot;good&quot;) that he makes Dionysus call him a &quot;good poet&quot;.

Agathon was also a friend of [[Euripides]], another recruit to the court of Archelaus of Macedon.

== Physical Appearance ==

Agathon's extraordinary physical beauty is brought up repeatedly in the sources; the historian W. Rhys Roberts observes that &quot;''ὁ καλός Ἀγάθων'' has become almost a stereotyped phrase.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;W. Rhys Roberts, &quot;Aristophanes and Agathon,&quot; ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies,'' Vol. 20 (1900), p 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  Our most detailed description of Agathon can be found in Aristophanes' comedy, the ''Thesmophoriazousae,'' in which Agathon appears as a pale, cleanshaven young man, dressed in women's clothes.  Regrettably, it is hard to determine how much of Aristophanes' portrayal is fact and how much mere comic invention.

After a close reading of the ''Thesmophoriazousae,'' the historian Jane McIntosh Snyder observed that Agathon's costume was almost identical to that of the famous lyric poet [[Anacreon]], as he is portrayed in early 5th-century vase-paintings.  Snyder theorizes that Agathon might have made a deliberate effort to mimic the sumptuous attire of his famous fellow-poet, although by Agathon's time, such clothing, especially the ''κεκρύφαλος'' (an elaborate covering for the hair) had long fallen out of fashion for men.  According to this interpretation, Agathon is mocked in the ''Thesmophoriazousae'' not only for his notorious effeminacy, but also for the pretentiousness of his dress: &quot;he seems to think of himself, in all his elegant finery, as a rival to the old Ionian poets, perhaps even to Anacreon himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jane McIntosh Snyder, &quot;Aristophanes' Agathon as Anacreon,&quot; ''Hermes,'' 102 (1974) p 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plato's Epigram ==

Agathon has been thought to be the subject of ''Lovers' Lips,'' attributed to the philosopher [[Plato]]:

::::Kissing Agathon, I had my soul upon my lips; for it rose, poor wretch, as though to cross over.

A looser translation reads: 

::::Kissing Agathon, I found my soul at my lips. Poor thing! It went there, hoping--to slip across.

Although the authenticity of this epigram was accepted for many centuries, it was probably ''not'' composed for Agathon the tragedian; nor was it composed by Plato.  Stylistic evidence suggests that the poem (with most of Plato's other alleged epigrams) was actually written some time after Plato had died: for its form is that of the Hellenistic erotic epigram, which did not become popular until after 300 B.C.  According to 20th-century scholar Walther Ludwig, the poems were spuriously inserted into an early biography of Plato—sometime between 250 B.C. and 100 B.C.--and adopted by later writers from this source.&lt;ref&gt;Walther Ludwig, &quot;Plato's Love Epigrams,&quot; ''Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies,'' 4:2 (1963: Spring) pp 59-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agesilaus II''', or '''Agesilaos II''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] '''{{polytonic|Ἀγησίλαος}}''') (444 BC &amp;ndash; 360 BC) was a king of [[Sparta]], of the [[Eurypontid]] dynasty, ruling from approximately 400 BC to 360 BC, during most of which time he was, in [[Plutarch]]'s words, &quot;as good as thought commander and king of all Greece,&quot; and was for the whole of it greatly identified with his country's deeds and fortunes.&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last = Clough  | first = Arthur Hugh  | author-link = Arthur Hugh Clough  | contribution = Agesilaus II  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 69–70  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0078.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early life===
Agesilaus was the son of [[Archidamus II]] and his second wife, Eupolia,
&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last = Cartledge  | first = Paul Anthony  | author-link =   | contribution = Agesilaus II  | editor-last = Hornblower  | editor-first = Simon  | title = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]  | volume =   | pages =   | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | place = Oxford  | year = 1996  | contribution-url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; brother to [[Cynisca]] (the first woman in ancient history to achieve an [[ancient Olympic Games|Olympic victory]]), and younger half-brother of [[Agis II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;livius&quot;&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ag-ai/agesilaus/agesilaus.htm Agesilaus] from [http://www.livius.org Livius.Org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the youth of Agesilaus we have little detail.  We do know that he was not expected to succeed to the throne after his brother king [[Agis II]], largely due to the fact that he was crippled from birth, and since the latter had a son, named [[Leotychidas, son of Agis|Leotychidas]]. Therefore, Agesilaus was trained in the traditional curriculum of Sparta, the ''[[agoge]].''  But Leotychidas was ultimately set aside as illegitimate, contemporary rumors representing him as the son of [[Alcibiades]], and Agesilaus became king around 401 BC, at the age of about forty.  In addition to questions of his nephew's paternity, Agesilaus' succession was largely due to the intervention of his Spartan general, [[Lysander]], who hoped to find in him a willing tool for the furtherance of his political designs.&lt;ref name=&quot;livius&quot;/&gt;

===Early reign===
[[Image:DionysiusMapAgesilaus.png|thumb|right|Agesilaus expels the Illyrians from Epirus]]
We first hear of him as king in the suppression of the [[conspiracy of Cinadon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;/&gt;  Then, in 396 BC, Agesilaus crossed into Asia with a force of 2,000 [[neodamodes]] (freed [[helots]]) and 6,000 allies to liberate [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] cities from [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] dominion.  On the eve of sailing from [[Aulis]] he attempted to offer a sacrifice, as [[Agamemnon]] had done before the [[Troy|Trojan]] expedition, but the [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]] intervened to prevent it, an insult for which he never forgave them.  On his arrival at [[Ephesus]] a three months' truce was concluded with [[Tissaphernes]], the [[satrap]] of [[Lydia]] and [[Caria]], but negotiations conducted during that time proved fruitless, and on its termination Agesilaus raided [[Phrygia]], where he easily won immense booty from the satrap [[Pharnabazus]]; [[Tissaphernes]] could offer no assistance, as he had concentrated his troops in Caria.  After spending the winter in organizing a [[cavalry]] force (''[[hippeis]]''), he made a successful incursion into [[Lydia]] in the spring of 395 BC.  [[Tithraustes]] was thereupon sent to replace Tissaphernes, who paid with his life for his continued failure.  An armistice was concluded between Tithraustes and Agesilaus, who left the southern [[satrap]]y and again invaded [[Phrygia]], which he ravaged until the following spring.  He then came to an agreement with [[Pharnabazus]] and once more turned southward.&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;/&gt;

It was said that in 394 BC, while encamped on the plain of Thebe, he was planning a campaign in the interior, or even an attack on [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] himself, when he was recalled to [[Greece]] owing to the war between Sparta and the combined forces of [[Athens]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], [[Argos]] and several minor states.  A rapid march through [[Thrace]] and [[Macedon]]ia brought him to [[Thessaly]], where he repulsed the Thessalian cavalry who tried to impede him.  Reinforced by [[Phocis|Phocian]] and [[Orchomenus|Orchomenian]] troops and a Spartan army, he met the confederate forces at [[Coronea]] in [[Boeotia]], and in a hotly contested battle was technically victorious, but the success was a barren one and he had to retire by way of [[Delphi]] to the [[Peloponnese]]. Shortly before this battle the Spartan [[navy]], of which he had received the supreme command, was totally defeated off [[Knidos|Cnidus]] by a powerful Persian fleet under [[Conon]] and [[Pharnabazus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;livius&quot;/&gt;

In 393 BC, Agesilaus engaged in a ravaging invasion of [[Argolis]].  In 392 BC he took a prominent part in the [[Corinthian War]], making several successful expeditions into Corinthian territory and capturing [[Lechaeum]] and [[Piraeus]].  The loss, however, of a division (mora), destroyed by [[Iphicrates]], neutralized these successes, and Agesilaus returned to Sparta.  In 389 BC he conducted a campaign in [[Acarnania]], but two years later the [[Peace of Antalcidas]], warmly supported by Agesilaus, put an end to hostilities.  In this interval, we find him declining the command in Sparta's aggression on [[Mantineia]], but heading, from motives of private friendship, that on [[Phlius]], and openly justifying [[Phoebidas]]' seizure of [[Cadmea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;/&gt;

===Decline===
When war broke out afresh with Thebes the king twice invaded [[Boeotia]] (in 378 BC and 377 BC), although he spent the next five years largely out of action due to an unspecified but apparently grave illness.  In the congress of 371 BC an altercation is recorded between him and the Theban general [[Epaminondas]], and due to his influence Thebes was peremptorily excluded from the peace, and orders given for [[Cleombrotus]] to march against [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] in 371 BC.  Cleombrotus was defeated at [[Leuctra]] and the Spartan supremacy overthrown.&lt;ref name=&quot;livius&quot;/&gt;

In 370 BC we find Agesilaus engaged in an embassy to [[Mantineia]], and reassuring the Spartans by an invasion of [[Arcadia]].  His prudence and heroism preserved an un-walled Sparta against the revolts and conspiracies of [[helot]]s, [[perioeci]] and even Spartans, and against her enemies, four different armies led by [[Epaminondas]], that penetrated [[Laconia]] that same year, and again in 362 BC when they all but succeeded in seizing the city by a rapid and unexpected march.  The [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)|Battle of Mantinea]], in which Agesilaus took no part, was followed by a general peace: Sparta, however, stood aloof, hoping even yet to recover her supremacy.  According to [[Xenophon]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''Agesilaus'', ii. 26, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Agesilaus, in order to gain money for prosecuting the war, supported the [[satrap]] [[Ariobarzanes II of Cius|Ariobarzanes II]] in his revolt against [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] in 364 BC, and in 361 BC he went to [[Egypt]] at the head of a [[mercenary]] force to aid the king [[Nectanebo I]] and his regent [[Teos of Egypt|Teos]] against Persia.  He soon transferred his services to Teos's cousin and rival [[Nectanebo II]], who, in return for his help, gave him a sum of over 200 talents.  On his way home Agesilaus died in [[Cyrenaica]], around the age of 84, after a reign of some 41 years.  His body was embalmed in wax, and buried at Sparta.&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;/&gt;

===Legacy===
Agesilaus was of small stature and unimpressive appearance, and was lame from birth. These facts were used as an argument against his succession, an [[oracle]] having warned Sparta against a &quot;lame reign.&quot;  Most ancient writers considered him a highly successful leader in [[guerrilla warfare]], alert and quick, yet cautious—a man, moreover, whose personal bravery was rarely questioned in his own time.  Of his courage, temperance, and hardiness, many instances are cited: and to these were added the less Spartan qualities of kindliness and tenderness as a father and a friend.  Thus we have the story of his riding across a stick (horse made of stick) with his children and upon being discovered by a friend desiring that he not mention till he himself were the father of children; and because of the affection of his son [[Archidamus III|Archidamus]]' for [[Cleonymus, son of Sphodrias|Cleonymus]], he saved [[Sphodrias]], Cleonymus' father, from execution for his incursion into the [[Piraeus]], and dishonorable retreat, in 378 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;/&gt;  Modern writers tend to be slightly more critical of Agesilaus' reputation and achievements, reckoning him an excellent soldier, but one who had a poor understanding of sea power and [[siegecraft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;/&gt;

As a statesman he won himself both enthusiastic adherents and bitter enemies.  Referring to the above sketch of Spartan history, we find Agesilaus shining most in its first and last period, as commencing and surrendering a glorious career in Asia, and as, in extreme age, maintaining his prostrate country.  Other writers acknowledge his extremely high popularity at home, but suppose his occasionally rigid and even irrational political loyalties and convictions contributed greatly to Spartan decline, notably his unremitting hatred of Thebes, which led to Sparta's humiliation at the [[Battle of Leuctra]] and thus the end of Spartan hegemony.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;/&gt;

[[Plutarch]] gives among numerous [[Apophthegmata Laconica|apophthegmata]] his letter to the [[ephor]]s on his recall:
{{quote|We have reduced most of Asia, driven back the barbarians, made arms abundant in Ionia. But since you bid me, according to the decree, come home, I shall follow my letter, may perhaps be even before it. For my command is not mine, but my country's and her allies'.  And a commander then commands truly according to right when he sees his own commander in the laws and ephors, or others holding office in the state.}}

And when asked whether he wanted a memorial erected in his honor:
{{quote|If I have done any noble action, that is a sufficient memorial; if I have done nothing noble, all the statues in the world will not preserve my memory.&lt;ref&gt;In [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{polytonic|Εἰ γάρ τι καλὸν ἔργον πεποίηκα, τοῦτό μου μνημεῖον ἔσται; εἰ δὲ μή, οὐδ' οἱ πάντες ἀνδριάντες}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He lived in the most frugal style alike at home and in the field, and though his campaigns were undertaken largely to secure booty, he was content to enrich the state and his friends and to return as poor as he had set forth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''Hell.'' iii. 3, to the end, ''Agesilaus''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], xiv. xv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' iii. 97 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]] and [[Cornelius Nepos]], ''in vita''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Apophthegmata Laconica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected quotes==
When someone was praising an orator for his ability to magnify small points, he said, &quot;In my opinion it's not a good cobbler who fits large shoes on small feet.&quot;

Another time he watched a mouse being pulled from its hole by a small boy. When the mouse turned around, bit the hand of its captor and escaped, he pointed this out to those present and said, &quot;When the tiniest creature defends itself like this against aggressors, what ought men to do, do you reckon?&quot;

Certainly when somebody asked what gain the laws of Lycurgus had brought Sparta, he answered, &quot;Contempt for pleasures.&quot;

Asked once how far Sparta's boundaries stretched, he brandished his spear and said, &quot;As far as this can reach.&quot;

On noticing a house in Asia roofed with square beams, he asked the owner whether timber grew square in that area. When told no, it grew round, he said, &quot;What then? If it were square, would you make it round?&quot;

As he was dying on the voyage back from Egypt, he gave instructions to those close to him that they should not be responsible for making any image of his person, be it modeled or painted or copied, &quot;For if I have accomplished any glorious feat, that will be my memorial. But if I have not, not even all the statues in the world—the products of vulgar, worthless men—would make any difference.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;plutarch&quot;&gt;[[Plutarch]]: &quot;Sayings of Spartans,&quot; Penguin Classics, 2005 Revised Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Invited to hear an actor who could perfectly imitate the nightingale, Ageselius declined, saying he had heard the nightingale itself.

'''Antonio Agliardi''' (September 4, 1832 &amp;ndash; May 1, 1915) was an Italian [[Roman Catholic]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]], [[archbishop]], and papal diplomat. He was born at  [[Cologno al Serio]], in what is now the [[Province of Bergamo]].

He studied [[theology]] and [[canon law]], and after acting as parish priest in his native diocese for twelve years was sent by the [[pope]] to [[Canada]] as a [[bishop's chaplain]]. On his return he was appointed secretary to the [[Congregation of the Propaganda]].

In 1884, he was created by [[Pope Leo XIII]] [[Archbishop of Caesarea]] ''in partibus'' and sent to [[India]] as an [[Apostolic Delegate]] to report on the establishment of the [[hierarchy]] there.

In 1887 he again visited India, to carry out the terms of the [[concordat]] arranged with [[Portugal]]. The same year he was appointed secretary of the Congregation ''super negotiis ecclesiae extraordinariis''. In 1889 he became papal [[nuncio]] at [[Munich]] and in 1892 at [[Vienna]]. Allowing himself to be involved in the ecclesiastical disputes that divided [[Hungary]] in 1895, he was made the subject of formal complaint by the Hungarian government and in 1896 was recalled.

In the [[consistory]] of 1896 he was elevated to [[Cardinal Priest]] of ''[[Santi Nereo e Achilleo]]''. In 1899 he was made [[Cardinal Bishop]] of [[Albano Laziale|Albano]]. In 1903, he was named vice-chancellor of the Catholic Church, and became the Chancellor of the [[Apostolic Chancery]] in the [[Secretariat of State (Vatican)|Secretariat of State]] in 1908.

He died in [[Rome]] and was buried in [[Bergamo]].

'''Agnes Maria of Andechs-Merania''' (died 1201), queen of [[France]], was the daughter of [[Bertold IV]] (died 1204), who was Count of [[Andechs]], a castle and territory near [[Ammersee]], [[Bavaria]] and  from  1183 duke of [[Merania]] ([[Istria]]). Her mother was [[Agnes of Rochlitz]]. She is called Marie by some of the French chroniclers.

In June 1196 Agnes married [[Philip II of France]], who had repudiated his second wife [[Ingeborg of Denmark, Queen of France|Ingeborg of Denmark]] in 1193. [[Pope Innocent III]] espoused the cause of Ingeborg; but Philip did not submit until 1200, when, nine months after [[Interdict (Roman Catholic Church)|interdict]] had been added to [[excommunication]], he consented to a separation from Agnes. She died broken-hearted in July of the next year, at the castle of [[Poissy]], and was buried in the [[Convent of St Corentin]], near [[Nantes]]. Her two children by Philip II, [[Philip, count of Clermont]] (died 1234), and Mary, who married [[Philip I of Namur]], were legitimized by the pope in 1201 at the request of the king. Little is known of the personality of Agnes, beyond the remarkable influence which she seems to have exercised over Philip II. She has been made the heroine of a [[tragedy]] by [[François Ponsard]], ''Agnès de Méranie'', and of an [[opera]] by [[Vincenzo Bellini]], ''[[La straniera]]''.

Her sister [[Hedwig of Andechs]] married [[Henry I, duke of Silesia]] and was canonized as Saint Hedwig in 1267. Another sister, [[Gertrude of Merania|Gertrude]], married [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and was the mother of [[St. Elizabeth of Hungary]].

'''Agni''' ({{lang-sa|अग्नि}}) is a [[Rigvedic deities|Hindu deity]], one of the most important of the [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] gods. He is the god of fire&lt;ref&gt;Mythology, An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Principal Myths and Religions of the World, by [[Richard Cavendish]] ISBN 1-84056-070-3, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and the acceptor of sacrifices. The sacrifices made to Agni go to the [[deity|deities]] because Agni is a messenger from and to the other gods. He is ever-young, because the fire is re-lit every day, and also immortal. 

Agni, the Vedic god of fire, has made the transition into the Hindu pantheon of gods, without losing his importance. With [[Varuna]] and [[Indra]] he is one of the supreme gods in the Rig Veda. The link between heaven and earth, the deities and the humans, he is associated with Vedic sacrifice, taking offerings to the other world in his fire. In Hinduism, his vehicle is the ram.&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, John. World Religions. New York: DK Publishing, Inc. 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''agni'' is [[Sanskrit]] for &quot;fire&quot; (noun), cognate with [[Latin]] ''ignis'' (the root of English ''ignite''), Russian огонь (''ogon''), Polish &quot;ogień,&quot; Lithuanian - ''ugnis'' - all with the meaning 'fire', with the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European root being ''h₁égni-''. Agni has three forms: fire, lightning and the sun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/concepts/agni.asp Agni, the Vedic God of Fire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Vedas==
{{Classic element}}
Agni is the first word of the first hymn of the [[Rigveda]]:-
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|sa|अग्नि॒म् ई॑ळे पुरो॒हि॑तं यज्ञ॒स्य॑ देव॒म् ऋत्वि॒ज॑म् । होता॑रं रत्नधा॒त॑मम् ॥}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{IAST|agním īḷe puróhitaṃ / yajñásya devám ṛtvíjam / hótāraṃ ratnadhâtamam}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Agni I laud, the [[purohita|high priest]], [[deva (Hinduism)|god]], [[ṛtvíj|minister of sacrifice]], The [[hotar|invoker]], lavishest of wealth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He is the supreme director of religious ceremonies and duties, and figures as messenger between mortals and gods. Vedic rituals all involve Agni, for example the elaborate [[Agnicayana]], that is, the piling of the fire altar, the [[Agnihotra]], viz., offering to Agni.

The [[Rigveda]] often says that Agni arises from water or dwells in the waters. He may have originally been the same as [[Apam Napat]], who is also sometimes described as fire arising from water which in a natural explanation may have referred to flames from natural gas or oil seepages surfacing through water. Other Rigvedic names, epithets or aspects of Agni include [[Matarishvan]], Jatavedas, or Bharata.

Agni is a [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]], second only to [[Indra]] in the power and importance attributed to him in [[Vedic mythology]], with 218 out of 1,028 hymns of the Rigveda dedicated to him. He is [[Indra]]'s twin, and therefore a son of [[Dyaus Pita]] and [[Prthivi]]. However, he is also said to have two mothers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|year=2008|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|publisher=GBD Books|location=Delhi|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=K2H_PgAACAAJ|page=197|quote=Rig Veda 1.31.2 - the term used is ''' Dwimata  shayuah '''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (the two parts of the [[Making fire|firedrill]] used to start the fire), and ten servant maids (the fingers of the man who is lighting the fire) or as the twice-born.&lt;ref&gt;Rig Veda 1.149.4 ''ibid'' p.43&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the [[Guardians of the directions]], representing the southeast. 

In a later Hindu interpretation, Agni stands for [[knowledge]] for it is seen by the learned people, covering all things that move and do not move &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|year=2008|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|publisher=GBD Books|location=Delhi|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=K2H_PgAACAAJ|page=197|quote=Rig Veda 10.5.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because it summons the [[Devatas]] endowed with knowledge &lt;ref&gt;Rig Veda 1.44.7 ''ibid'' p.42&lt;/ref&gt; the light Agni emits is the light of knowledge, therefore, it is also known as the illuminator of knowledge who lights up the path leading to Truth. Agni reveals the true nature of one's own [[Self (spirituality)|self]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|year=2008|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|publisher=GBD Books|location=Delhi|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=K2H_PgAACAAJ|page=214|quote= Rig Veda 10.15.14- Meaning of the cited mantra :-&quot;...these fatherly figures, the learned ones, who keep the fire alight at their homes and those who do not (who have renounced everything this world has to offer),owing to their knowledge of the highest Truth enjoy eternal happiness; the bright fire that burns within the as the very life principle giving them yogic powers...&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it is the innermost light that shines ever so brightly in all things living and nonliving as their inner consciousness (impeller).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|year=2008|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|publisher=GBD Books|location=Delhi|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=K2H_PgAACAAJ|page=120|quote=Rig Veda 10.57.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions==
In Hindu art, Agni is depicted with two or seven hands, two heads and three legs. He has seven fiery tongues with which he licks sacrificial butter. He rides a ram or in a chariot harnessed by fiery horses. His attributes are an axe, torch, prayer beads and a flaming spear.&lt;ref name=Jansen&gt;The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning By Eva Rudy Jansen p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Agni is represented as [[red]] and two-faced, suggesting both his destructive and beneficent qualities, and with [[black]] [[Human eye|eye]]s and [[hair]], three [[Human leg|legs]] and seven arms. He rides a [[ram (sheep)|ram]], or a chariot pulled by goats or, more rarely, parrots. [[Seven rays]] of light emanate from his body. One of his names is ''Saptajihva'', &quot;having seven tongues&quot;.&lt;ref name=Jansen/&gt; Another one of his epithets is Abhimani (from Sanskrit: abhi towards + the verbal root man to think, reflect upon) meaning dignified, proud; Longing for, thinking upon.

==Legends==
Agni is the eldest son of [[Brahma]]. In [[Visnu Purana]], Agni (Abhimani) the fire god is said to have sprung from the mouth of the [[Purusha|Virat purusha]], the Cosmic Man. His wife is Svaha. Abhimani had three sons of surpassing brilliancy: Pavaka, Pavamana, and Suchi, the personifications of the three fires that produced our earth and humanity (VP 1:10).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6JB-KOXy5k8C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=abhimani&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=acLESqPjGKKIkATXlNXJAw&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimani&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; All these three names indicate purity. Abhimanin, his three sons, and their 45 sons constitute the mystic 49 fires of the Puranas and theosophy. (cf [[Agni Purana]].)

As the eldest son of Brahma, Abhimani represents the cosmic [[Logos]], the first force produced in the universe at its evolution, the fire of cosmic creative desire.

His three sons, according to the [[Vayu Purana]], stand for three different aspects of Agni (fire): Pavaka is the electric fire, Pavamana the fire produced by friction, and Suchi the solar fire. Interpreted on the cosmic and human planes, these three fires are &quot;Spirit, Soul, and Body, the three great Root groups, with their four additional divisions&quot; (SD 2:247). They are said to have been cursed by the sage Vasishtha to be born again and again (cf BP 4:24,4; SD 2:247-8). &quot;Every fire has a distinct function and meaning in the worlds of the physical and the spiritual. It has, moreover, in its essential nature a corresponding relation to one of the human psychic faculties, besides its well determined chemical and physical potencies when coming in contact with the terrestrially differentiated matter&quot; (SD 1:521).

Agni is also an important entity in Ayurveda. It is considered to be the one which is responsible for the sustenance of life. Agni helps in the various physiological functions of the body.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

[[Image:Musée Guimet 897 05.jpg|thumb|right|Sculpture of Agni from [[Musée Guimet]]]]

In Newar, Tibetan and Japanese [[Buddhism]], he is a [[Guardians of the directions#Lokapālas|lokapāla]] guarding the Southeast. ''Jigten lugs kyi bstan bcos:'' which translates, &quot;Make your hearth in the southeast corner of the house, which is the quarter of Agni&quot;. He also plays a central role in most Buddhist ''homa'' fire-[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] rites. A typical praise to Agni starts  &quot;Son of Brahma, Lord of the World, King of fire gods empowered by Takki, Whose supreme wisdom burns all delusion [...]&quot; &lt;ref&gt;A Manual of Ritual Fire offerings p20, Sharpa Tulku / Michael Perrott LTWA, 1987 ISBN 81-85102-66-X&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vipsania Agrippina''' or most commonly known as '''Agrippina Major''' or '''Agrippina the Elder''' (''Major'' Latin for ''the elder'', [[Classical Latin]]: &lt;small&gt;AGRIPPINA•GERMANICI&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|E. Groag, A. Stein, L. Petersen - e.a.}} (edd.), ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani saeculi I, II et III'' ('''[[PIR]]'''), Berlin, 1933 - V 463&lt;/ref&gt; 14 BC – [[18 October]] [[33]]) was a distinguished and prominent granddaughter of the Emperor Augustus. Agrippina was the wife of the general, statesman [[Germanicus]] and a relative to the first [[Roman Emperors]]. She was the second granddaughter of the Emperor [[Augustus]], sister-in-law, stepdaughter and daughter-in-law of the Emperor [[Tiberius]], mother of the Emperor [[Caligula]], maternal second cousin and sister-in-law of the Emperor [[Claudius]] and the maternal grandmother of the Emperor [[Nero]].

==Family and early life==
Agrippina was born as the second daughter and fourth child to Roman Statesman and Augustus’ trusted ally [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] and [[Julia the Elder]]. Agrippina’s mother Julia was the only natural child born to Augustus from his second marriage to noblewoman [[Scribonia]].

Her father’s marriage to Julia was his third marriage. From Agrippa’s previous two marriages, Agrippina had two half-sisters: [[Vipsania Agrippina]] and [[Vipsania Marcella]] Agrippina. Vipsania Agrippina was Agrippa’s first daughter and first child from his first marriage to [[Pomponia Caecilia Attica]]. She became Tiberius's first wife and was the mother of his natural son [[Drusus Julius Caesar]]. Vipsania Agrippina later married senator and consul [[Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus]] after Tiberius was forced to divorce her and marry [[Julia the Elder]]. Vipsania Marcella was Agrippa’s second child from his second marriage to Augustus’ first niece and the paternal cousin of Julia the Elder, [[Claudia Marcella]] Major. Vipsania Marcella was the first wife of the general [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]].

Her mother’s marriage to Agrippa was her second marriage, as Julia the Elder was widowed from her first marriage, to her paternal cousin [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] and they had no children. From the marriage of Julia and Agrippa, Agrippina had four full-blood siblings: a sister [[Julia the Younger]] and three brothers: [[Gaius Caesar]], [[Lucius Caesar]] and [[Agrippa Postumus]]. Agrippina was born in [[Athens]], as in the year of her birth Agrippa was in that city completing official duties on behalf of Augustus. Her mother and her siblings had travelled with Agrippa. Later Agrippina’s family returned to [[Rome]].

In 12 BC, Agrippina’s father died. Augustus had forced his first stepson Tiberius to end his happy first marriage to Vipsania Agrippina to marry Julia the Elder. The marriage of Julia and Tiberius was not a happy one. In 2 BC Augustus exiled Agrippina’s mother on the grounds that she had committed adultery, thereby causing a major scandal. Julia was banished for her remaining years and Agrippina never saw her again. Around this time, to avoid any scandals Tiberius divorced Julia and left Rome to live on the [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Rhodes]].

With her siblings, Agrippina was raised in Rome by her maternal grandfather and maternal step-grandmother [[Livia]] Drusilla. Livia was the first Roman Empress and was Augustus’ third wife (from Livia’s first marriage to praetor [[Tiberius Nero]], she had two sons: the emperor Tiberius and the general [[Nero Claudius Drusus]]. Augustus was Livia's second husband).

According to [[Suetonius]], Agrippina had a strict upbringing and education. Her education included how to spin and weave and she was forbidden to say or do anything, either in public or private. Augustus made her record any daily activities she did in the imperial day book and the emperor took severe measures in preventing Agrippina from forming friendships, without his consent. As a member of the imperial family, Agrippina was expected to have and show strict traditional Roman virtues for a woman that was frugality, chastity and domesticity. Agrippina and Augustus had a close relationship.

==The wife of Germanicus==
Between 1 BC-5, Agrippina married her second maternal cousin [[Germanicus]]. Germanicus was the first son born to [[Antonia Minor]] and [[Nero Claudius Drusus]]. Antonia Minor was the second daughter born to [[Octavia Minor]] and triumvir [[Mark Antony]], hence Antonia’s maternal uncle was Augustus. Germanicus was a popular general and politician. Augustus ordered Tiberius to adopt Germanicus as his son and heir. Germanicus was always favored by his great uncle and hoped that he would succeed Tiberius, who had been adopted by Augustus as his heir and successor. Agrippina and Germanicus were devoted to each other. She was a loyal, affectionate wife, who supported her husband. The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] states that Agrippina had an ‘impressive record as wife and mother’.

Agrippina and Germanicus in their union had nine children, whom three died young. The six children who survived to adulthood were the sons: [[Nero (son of Germanicus)|Nero Caesar]], [[Drusus Caesar]] and [[Caligula|Caligula born as Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus]] and the daughters [[Agrippina the Younger|Julia Agrippina or Agrippina the Younger]], [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]] and [[Julia Livilla]]. Caligula would become future Roman Emperor. Agrippina the Younger would become a future Roman Empress and mother to the later Emperor Nero. Their children were born at various places throughout the Roman Empire and Agrippina acquired a well-deserved reputation for successful childbearing. Eventually Agrippina was proud of her large family and this was apart of the reason, she was popular with Roman citizens.

According to Suetonius who had cited from [[Pliny the Elder]], Agrippina had borne to Germanicus, a son called Gaius Julius Caesar who had a lovable character. This son died young. The child was born at Treveri, near the village of Ambitarvium, just before the junction of the [[Moselle River]] and the [[Rhine]] River (modern [[Koblenz]] [[Germany]]). At this spot, there were local altars inscribed as a dedication to Agrippina: “IN HONOR OF AGRIPPINA’S PUERPERIUM”, puerperium means child-bearing for a boy.

Germanicus was a candidate for future succession and had won fame campaigning in [[Germania]] and [[Gaul]]. During the military campaigns, Agrippina accompanied Germanicus with their children. Agrippina’s actions were considered unusual as for a Roman wife, because a conventional Roman wife was required to stay home. Agrippina had earned herself a reputation as a heroic woman and wife. During her time in Germania, Agrippina had proved herself to be an efficient and effective diplomat. Agrippina had reminded Germanicus on occasion of his relation to Augustus.

A few months before Augustus’ death in 14, the emperor wrote and sent a letter to Agrippina mentioning how Caligula must be future emperor because at that time, no other child had this name.

The letter reads:
{{quote|Yesterday I made arrangements for Talarius and Asillius to bring your son Gaius to you on the eighteenth of May, if the gods will. I am also sending with him one of my slaves, a doctor who as I have told Germanicus in a letter, need not be returned to me if he proves of use of you. Goodbye my dear Agrippina! Keep well on the way to your Germanicus!}}

[[Image:Benjamin West 001.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Agrippina landing at [[Brundisium]] with the Ashes of Germanicus'', Oil on canvas, ''c.'' 1768.]]

Agrippina and Germanicus travelled to the [[Middle East]] in 19, incurring the displeasure of [[Tiberius]]. Germanicus quarrelled with [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]], the governor of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and died in [[Antioch]] in mysterious circumstances. It was widely suspected that Germanicus had been poisoned or perhaps on the orders of Tiberius. Agrippina was in grief when Germanicus died. She returned with her children to [[Italy]] with Germanicus’ ashes. The Roman citizens had great sympathy for Agrippina and her family. She returned to Rome to avenge his death and boldly accused Piso of the murder of Germanicus. According to Tacitus (''Annals'' 3.14.1), the prosecution could not prove the poisoning charge, but other charges of treason seemed likely to stick and Piso committed suicide.

==Time in Rome, downfall and posthumous honors==
From 19 to 29, Agrippina lived on the [[Palatine Hill]] in Rome. Her remaining children were raised between her, [[Livia]] Drusilla and Germanicus’ mother [[Antonia Minor]]. Agrippina had become lonely, distressed, physically ill and many of her relatives had died. Agrippina had a hasty, uncomfortable relationship with Tiberius and possibly with Tiberius’ mother Livia. She became involved in politics in Tiberius’ imperial court, became an advocate for her sons to succeed Tiberius, and opposed Tiberius’ natural son and natural grandson [[Tiberius Gemellus]] for succession.

She was unwise in her complaints about Germanicus’ death to Tiberius. Tiberius took Agrippina by her hand and quoted the Greek line: “And if you are not queen, my dear, have I then you wrong?”

Agrippina became involved in a group of Roman Senators who opposed the growing power and influence of the notorious [[Praetorian Guard]] Lucius Aelius [[Sejanus]]. Tiberius began to distrust Agrippina. In 26, Agrippina requested Tiberius to allow her to marry her brother-in-law, Roman Senator Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus. However, Tiberius didn’t allow her to marry Saloninus, because of political implications the marriage could have.

Tiberius carefully staged to invite Agrippina to dinner at the imperial palace. At dinner, Tiberius offered Agrippina an apple as a test of Agrippina’s feelings for the emperor. Agrippina had suspected that the apple could carry a certain death and refused to taste the apple. This was the last time that Tiberius invited Agrippina to his dinner table. Agrippina later stated that Tiberius tried to poison her.

In 29, Agrippina and her sons [[Nero (son of Germanicus)|Nero]] and [[Drusus Caesar|Drusus]], were arrested on the orders of Tiberius. Tiberius falsely accused Agrippina of planning to take sanctuary besides the image of Augustus or with the Roman Army abroad. Agrippina and her sons were put on trial by the [[Roman Senate]]. She was banished on Tiberius’ orders to the island of Pandataria (now called [[Ventotene]]) in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] off the coast of [[Campania]]. This was the island where her mother was banished.

In prison at Pandataria, Agrippina protested violently. On one occasion, Tiberius ordered a centurion to flog her and in the course she lost an eye. Refusing to eat, Agrippina was force-fed but later starved herself to death. There is a possibility malnutrition contributed to her death. She died 18 October 33. Agrippina’s son Drusus died of starvation being imprisoned in Rome and her other son Nero either committed suicide or was murdered after his trial in 29. The notorious guard Sejanus was murdered in 31 on the orders of Tiberius. Tiberius suspected Sejanus of plotting to overthrow the emperor.

After the death of Agrippina, Tiberius wickedly slandered her memory. Tiberius had stated while Agrippina lived, he showed her clemency. Tiberius was able to persuade the Roman Senate to decree Agrippina’s birthday as a day of ill omen.

In March 37, Tiberius died and Agrippina’s remaining son Caligula succeeded as emperor. After Caligula delivered Tiberius’ eulogy, Caligula sailed to Pandataria and the [[Pontine Islands]] and returned with the ashes of his mother and brother Nero. Caligula returned with their ashes in urns in his own hands.

[[Image:Eustache Caligula.jpg|thumb|230px|left|''Caligula Depositing the Ashes of his Mother and Brother in the Tomb of his Ancestors'', by [[Eustache Le Sueur]], 1647]]

As proof of devotion to his family, Caligula arranged the most distinguished soldiers available to carry the urns of his mother and two brothers in two biers at noon in Rome, when the streets were at their busiest, to the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]]. A bronze medal on display in the [[British Museum]] shows Agrippina’s ashes being brought back to [[Rome]] by Caligula.

[[Image:Campitelli - Campidoglio, lapide di Agrippina al Tabularium 2285.JPG|thumb|Cinerary urn of Agrippina, in the [[tabularium]].]]

Caligula appointed an annual day each year in Rome, for people to offer funeral sacrifices to honor their late relatives. As a dedication to Agrippina, Caligula set aside the Circus Games to honor the memory of his late mother. On the day that the Circus Games occurred, Caligula had a statue made of Agrippina’s image to be paraded in a covered carriage at the Games.

After the Circus Games, Caligula ordered written evidence of the court cases from Tiberius’ treason trials to be brought to the Forum to be burnt, first being the cases of Agrippina and her two sons.

=== The historians ===
According to Suetonius, Caligula nursed a rumor that Augustus and Julia the Elder had an incestuous union from which Agrippina the Elder had been born. According to Tacitus, Agrippina’s eldest daughter [[Agrippina the Younger]] had written memoirs for posterity. One memoir was an account of her mother’s life. A second memoir was about the fortunes of her mother’s family and the last memoir recorded the misfortunes (casus suorum) of the family of Agrippina and Germanicus. Unfortunately these memoirs are now lost.

==Personality==
Agrippina is regarded in ancient and modern historical sources as a Roman Matron with a reputation as a great woman, who had an excellent character and had outstanding Roman morals. She was a dedicated, supporting wife and mother who looked out for the interests of her children and the future of her family.

Tacitus describes Agrippina’s character as “determined and rather excitable”. Throughout her life, Agrippina always proudly and arrogantly prized her ancestry from Augustus. However Agrippina’s constant dwelling of her noble birth and her stating being the &quot;sole surviving offspring of Augustus&quot; (Tacitus, Annals 3.4) may have contributed to her downfall.

Although Agrippina was an innocent victim of Tiberius’ [[tyranny]], Agrippina dwelling on her ancestry, was a complete insult to Tiberius and Livia Drusilla. Tiberius was the adopted son and heir of Augustus, while Livia was adopted into the imperial family after the death of Augustus. Agrippina’s attitude in her ancestry became a challenge to the position of Tiberius as successor of Augustus and ruling as an emperor, which effected future succession in the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]].

==Legacy==
Agrippina the Elder is considered the most prominent and distinguished grandchild born to Rome’s first Emperor. She is also considered one of the most prominent women in the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]; one of the most virtuous and heroic women of antiquity and of the first century.

She was the first Roman woman of the Roman Empire to have travelled with her husband to Roman military campaigns; to support and live with the Roman Legions. Agrippina was the first Roman matron to have more than one child from her family to reign on the Roman throne. Apart from being the late maternal grandmother of Nero, she was the late paternal grandmother of Princess [[Julia Drusilla]], the child of Caligula. Through Nero, Agrippina was the paternal great-grandmother of [[Claudia Augusta]], (Nero's only child through his second marriage to [[Poppaea Sabina]]).

Although Agrippina was a great example of a Roman Matron, she set a precedent for many upcoming Roman aristocratic women. She paved the way for women to wield influence and power in Roman politics, particularly in the Imperial Court, Senate and Army. She also set a precedent for wives who were Roman Empresses or female relatives of the ruling Imperial Family of the day to assist in the ruling and decision making policies that could effect, change and shape the Empire. The aristocratic women of the empire had more power and influence, than their predecessors in the [[Roman Republic]]. Through the precedents that were set by Agrippina, some aristocratic women later became patrons of learning, culture or charity and advisors to the later Roman Emperors.

From the memoirs written by Agrippina the Younger, [[Tacitus]] used the memoirs to extract information regarding the family and fate of Agrippina the Elder, when Tacitus was writing The Annals. There is a surviving portrait of Agrippina the Elder in the [[Capitoline Museums]] in [[Rome]].

{{Julio-Claudian dynasty}}

'''Julia Agrippina''', most commonly referred to as '''Agrippina Minor''' or '''Agrippina the Younger''', and after 50 known as '''Julia Augusta Agrippina''' (''Minor'' Latin for the ''‘younger’'', [[Classical Latin]]: &lt;small&gt;IVLIA•AGRIPPINA&lt;/small&gt;; &lt;small&gt;IVLIA•AVGVSTA•AGRIPPINA&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|E. Groag, A. Stein, L. Petersen - e.a.}} (edd.), ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani saeculi I, II et III'' ('''PIR'''), Berlin, 1933 - I 641&lt;/ref&gt; 7 November 15 or 6 November 16&lt;ref&gt;Maike Vogt-Lüerssen, ''Agrippina die Jüngere - Die große römische Politikerin und ihre Zeit'', Norderstedt 2006, ISBN 3-8334-5214-5, pp. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; – 19/23 March 59) was a Roman Empress and one of the more prominent women in the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. She was a great-granddaughter of the Emperor [[Augustus]], great-niece and adoptive granddaughter of the Emperor [[Tiberius]], sister of the Emperor [[Caligula]], niece and fourth wife of the Emperor [[Claudius]], and mother of the Emperor [[Nero]].

Agrippina the Younger has been described by both the ancient and modern sources as ‘ruthless, ambitious, violent and domineering’. She was a beautiful and reputable woman and according to [[Pliny the Elder]], she had a double canine in her upper right jaw, a sign of good fortune. Many ancient historians accuse Agrippina of poisoning Emperor Claudius, though accounts vary.&lt;ref name = &quot;yyroia&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' XII.66; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LXI.34; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Claudius 44; Josephus is less sure, Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XX.8.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
{{See|Julio-Claudian family tree}}
Agrippina was the first daughter and fourth living child of [[Agrippina the Elder]] and [[Germanicus]]. She had three elder brothers; [[Nero Julius Caesar Germanicus]], [[Drusus Caesar]] and the future Emperor [[Caligula]], and two younger sisters; [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]] and [[Livilla (sister of Caligula)|Livilla]]. Agrippina's two elder brothers and her mother were victims of the intrigues of the Praetorian Prefect [[Lucius Aelius Sejanus]].

She was the namesake of her mother. Agrippina the Elder was remembered as a modest and heroic matron, who was the second daughter and fourth child of [[Julia the Elder]] and the statesman [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]]. The father of Julia the Elder was the Emperor [[Augustus]], and Julia was his only natural child from his second marriage to [[Scribonia]], who had close blood relations with [[Pompey the Great]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]. Maternally, Agrippina was a direct descendant of Augustus.

Germanicus, Agrippina's father, was a very popular general and politician. His mother was [[Antonia Minor]] and his father was the general [[Nero Claudius Drusus]]. He was Antonia Minor's first child. Germanicus had two younger siblings; a sister, named [[Livilla (sister of Claudius)|Livilla]], and a brother, the future Emperor [[Claudius]]. Claudius was Agrippina's paternal uncle and third husband.

Antonia Minor was a daughter to [[Octavia the Younger]] by her second marriage to triumvir [[Mark Antony]], and Octavia was the second eldest sister and full-blooded sister of Augustus. Germanicus’ father, [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus the Elder]], was the second son of the Empress [[Livia]] Drusilla by her first marriage to praetor [[Tiberius Nero]], and was the Emperor [[Tiberius]]’s younger brother and Augustus’s stepson. In the year 9, Augustus ordered and forced Tiberius to adopt Germanicus, who happened to be Tiberius's nephew, as his son and heir. Germanicus was a favorite of his great-uncle Augustus, who hoped that Germanicus would succeed his uncle Tiberius, who was Augustus's own adopted son and heir. This in turn meant that Tiberius was also Agrippina's adoptive grandfather in addition to her paternal great-uncle.

==Birth and early life==
Agrippina was born at Oppidum Ubiorum, a Roman outpost on the [[Rhine]] River located in present day [[Cologne]], [[Germany]]. As a small child, she travelled with her parents throughout the empire until she and her siblings (apart from Caligula) returned to Rome to live with and be raised by Antonia. Her parents, in the meantime, journeyed to [[Syria]] to complete official duties. One year later in October, Germanicus died suddenly in [[Antioch]] (modern [[Antakya]], [[Turkey]]).

Germanicus’ death in the year 19 caused much public grief in Rome, and gave rise to rumors that he had been [[murder]]ed by [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]] and [[Munatia Plancina]] on the orders of Tiberius, as his widow Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with his ashes. Agrippina the Younger was thereafter supervised by her mother, her paternal grandmother Antonia Minor, and her great-grandmother, [[Livia]], all of them notable, influential, and powerful figures from whom she learnt how to survive. She lived on the [[Palatine Hill]] in [[Rome]]. Her great-uncle Tiberius had already become emperor and the head of the family after the death of the Emperor Augustus in 14.

==First marriage to Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus==
After her thirteenth birthday in 28, Tiberius arranged for Agrippina to marry her paternal second cousin [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32)|Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]] and ordered the marriage to be celebrated in [[Rome]]. Domitius came from a distinguished family of [[Ahenobarbus|consular rank]]. Through his mother [[Antonia Major]], Domitius was a great nephew of Augustus, first cousin to Claudius, and second cousin to Agrippina and Caligula. He had two sisters; [[Domitia Lepida the Elder]] and [[Domitia Lepida the Younger]]. Domitia Lepida the Younger was the biological mother of the Empress [[Valeria Messalina]].

Antonia Major was the elder sister to Antonia Minor, and the first daughter of Octavia Minor and Mark Antony. According to Suetonius, Domitius was a wealthy man with a despicable and dishonest character, who, according to Suetonius, was “A man who was in every aspect of his life detestable,&quot; and served as consul in 32. Agrippina and Domitius lived between Antium ([[Anzio]]) and Rome. Not much is known about the relationship between them.

==Reign of Caligula==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
[[Image:Caligula RIC 0033.jpg|thumb|right|300px|During the reign of [[Caligula]], coins like the one pictured here were issued depicting his three sisters, Drusilla, Livilla and Agrippina the Younger.]]

Tiberius died on March 16, 37 and her only surviving brother, [[Caligula]], became the new emperor. Being the emperor's sister gave Agrippina some influence.

Agrippina and her younger sisters [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]] and [[Livilla (sister of Caligula)|Julia Livilla]] received various honors from their brother, which included but were not limited to:

* They were given the rights of the [[Vestal Virgin]]s like the freedom to view public games from the upper seats in the stadium.
* Coins were issued depicting images of Caligula and his sisters. Roman coins like these were never issued beforehand. The coins depicted Caligula on one side and his sisters on the opposite.
* Caligula added his sister's names in to motions. In loyalty oaths, it was, ''&quot;I will not value my life or that of my children less highly than I do the safety of the Emperor and his sisters,&quot;'' or, if in consular motions: ''&quot;Good fortune attend to the Emperor and his sisters.&quot;''

Around the time that Tiberius died, Agrippina had become pregnant. Domitius had acknowledged the paternity of the child. In the early morning hours in Antium of December 15, 37, Agrippina gave birth to her first child and the first child born to Domitius, a son. Agrippina and Domitius named their son '''Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus''', after the Domitius's recently deceased father. This child would grow up to become the Emperor [[Nero]]. Nero was Agrippina's only natural child. Suetonius states that Domitius was congratulated by friends on the birth of his son, whereupon he replied &quot;I don't think anything produced by me and Agrippina could possibly be good for the state or the people.&quot;

Caligula and his sisters were accused of having incestuous relationships. On June 10, 38, Drusilla died, possibly of a fever, rampant in Rome at the time. He was particularly fond of Drusilla, claiming to treat her as he would [[Lollia Paulina|his own wife]], even though Drusilla had a [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|husband]]. Following her death, Caligula's relationship with Agrippina and Livilla changed, showing no special love or respect toward them after Drusilla's death. After this point, he was said to have gone insane.

In 39, Agrippina and Livilla, with their maternal cousin, Drusilla's widower [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], were involved in a failed plot to murder Caligula, a plot known as the ''Plot of the Three Daggers'', which was to make Lepidus the new emperor. Lepidus, Agrippina and Livilla were contended to be lovers. Not much is known concerning this plot and the reasons behind it. At the trial of Lepidus, Caligula felt no compunction about denouncing them as adultresses, producing handwritten letters discussing how they were going to kill him.

Lepidus was executed. Agrippina and Livilla were exiled by their brother to the [[Pontine Islands]]. Caligula sold their furniture, jewellery, slaves and freedmen. In January 40, Domitius died of [[edema]] (dropsy) at Pyrgi. Nero had gone to live with his second paternal aunt [[Domitia Lepida the Younger]] after Caligula had taken his inheritance away from him. Caligula, his wife [[Milonia Caesonia]] and their daughter [[Julia Drusilla]] were murdered on January 24, 41. Agrippina's paternal uncle, [[Claudius]], brother of her father [[Germanicus]], became the new Roman Emperor.

==Reign of Claudius==
===Return from exile===
[[Image:Messalinaandbritannicus.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Messalina holding her son Britannicus, [[Louvre]].]]

Claudius ordered Agrippina and Livilla to return from exile. Livilla returned to her husband, while Agrippina was reunited with her estranged son. After the death of her first husband, Agrippina tried to make shameless advances to the future emperor [[Galba]], who showed no interest in her and was devoted to his wife [[Aemilia Lepida]]. On one occasion, Galba's mother-in-law gave Agrippina, in a whole bevy of married women, a public reprimand and a slap in the face.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Galba*.html C. Suetonius Tranquillus] Suetonius. Twelve Caesars: Galba.&lt;/ref&gt;

Claudius had Nero’s inheritance reinstated and arranged for [[Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus]] and [[Domitia Lepida the Elder]] (Lucius' first paternal aunt) to divorce so that Crispus could marry Agrippina. When Agrippina returned, she had nothing to return to. Agrippina married Crispus as her second husband and he became a step father to Nero. Crispus was a prominent, influential, witty, wealthy and powerful man, who served twice as consul. He was the adopted grandson and biological great, great nephew of the historian [[Sallust]]. Little is known on their relationship.

In the first years of Claudius’ reign, Claudius was married to the infamous Empress [[Valeria Messalina]]. Although Agrippina was very influential, she kept a very low profile and stayed away from the imperial palace and the court of the emperor. Messalina was Agrippina’s second paternal cousin. Among the victims of Messalina's intrigues were Agrippina's surviving sister Livilla, who was charged with having adultery with [[Seneca the Younger]]. Seneca was later called back from exile to be a tutor to Nero.

When Agrippina returned from exile, Messalina realised that Agrippina’s son was a threat to her son’s position and sent assassins to strangle Lucius during his siesta. The assassins left in terror, when a snake suddenly darted from beneath Nero’s pillow—but it was only a sloughed-off snake-skin in his bed, near his pillow.

In 47, Crispus died, and at his funeral, the rumor spread around that Agrippina poisoned Crispus to gain his estate. After being widowed a second time, Agrippina was left very wealthy. Later that year at the [[Secular Games]], at the performance of the Troy Pageant, Messalina attended the event with her son Britannicus. Agrippina was also present with Lucius. Agrippina and Lucius received greater applause from the audience than Messalina and [[Britannicus]] did. Many people began to show pity and sympathy to Agrippina, due to the unfortunate circumstances in her life. Agrippina wrote a memoir that recorded the misfortunes of her family (casus suorum) and wrote an account of her mother’s life.

===Rise to power===
After Messalina was executed in 48 for conspiring with [[Gaius Silius]] to overthrow her husband, Claudius considered remarrying for the fourth time. Around this time, Agrippina became the mistress to one of Claudius’ advisers, the former Greek Freedman [[Pallas (freedman)|Marcus Antonius Pallas]]. At that time Claudius’ advisers were discussing which noblewoman Claudius should marry. Claudius had a reputation that he was easily controlled by his wives and freedmen. His freedmen, according to legend, presented him three possible candidates.

The freedman [[Tiberius Claudius Narcissus]] suggested Claudius to remarry his second wife [[Aelia Paetina]], with whom he had a daughter, [[Claudia Antonia]]. Narcissus also stated that Paetina would cherish [[Claudia Octavia]] and [[Britannicus]], Claudius's children with Messalina, in addition to Antonia.

Another freedman, [[Gaius Julius Callistus]], was against Claudius remarrying Paetina and stated to Claudius that he divorced her before and that remarrying Paetina would make her more arrogant. Callistus suggested [[Lollia Paulina]], Caligula's third wife and Agrippina's former sister-in-law instead.

Pallas advised Claudius that he should marry Agrippina. Pallas stated to the emperor that as Lucius was the grandson to Claudius's late brother Germanicus, by marrying Agrippina, Claudius would ally the two branches of the Claudian house and imperial family. In more recent times, it has been suggested that the Senate may have pushed for the marriage between Agrippina and Claudius to end the feud between the Julian and Claudian branches.&lt;ref&gt;Scramuzza (1940) pp.&amp;nbsp;91–92. See also Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 6, 7; Suet. ''Claud.'' 26.&lt;/ref&gt; This feud dated back to Agrippina's [[Agrippina the Elder|mother's]] actions against Tiberius after the death of Germanicus, actions which Tiberius had gladly punished.

Regardless, for Agrippina’s seduction, it was a help that she had the niece’s privilege of kissing and caressing her paternal uncle. Claudius was seduced by her passions.

Claudius made references to her in his speeches: &quot;my daughter and foster child, born and bred, in my lap, so to speak&quot;. When Claudius decided to marry her, he persuaded a group of senators that the marriage should be arranged in the public interest]. In Roman society, an uncle (Claudius) marrying his niece (Agrippina) was considered an incestuous relationship, and a subject of controversy at the time.

Agrippina and Claudius married on New Year’s Day, 49. This marriage caused widespread disapproval. This was a part of Agrippina’s scheming plan to make Lucius the new Emperor. Her marriage to Claudius wasn’t based on love, but on power. She quickly eliminated her rival [[Lollia Paulina]]. In 49, shortly after marrying Claudius, Agrippina charged Paulina with [[black magic]]. Paulina did not receive a hearing. Her property was confiscated, she left Italy and on Agrippina's orders, she committed suicide.

In the months leading up to her marriage to Claudius, Agrippina's maternal second cousin, the [[praetor]] [[Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus]], was betrothed to Claudius’ daughter [[Claudia Octavia]]. This betrothal was broken off in 48 when Agrippina, scheming with consul [[Lucius Vitellius the Elder]], the father of the future Emperor [[Aulus Vitellius]], had falsely charged Silanus with having open incest with his sister [[Junia Calvina]]. Agrippina did this hopefully to secure Octavia to marry her son. Consequently, Claudius broke off the engagement and forced Silanus to resign from public office. Silanus committed suicide on the day that Agrippina married her uncle and Calvina was exiled from [[Italy]] in early 49. Calvina was called back from exile after Agrippina had died. Towards the end of 54, Agrippina would order the murder of Silanus' eldest brother [[Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus]] without Nero's knowledge, so that he wouldn't be able to seek revenge against her over his brother's death.

==Empress of Rome==
[[File:Agrippina Minor with Claudius.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Roman [[aureus]] depicting Agrippina and Claudius, ''c.'' 50/54]]

On the day that Agrippina married her uncle Claudius as her third husband/his fourth wife, she became an Empress and the most powerful woman in the [[Roman Empire]]. She also was a stepmother to [[Claudia Antonia]], Claudius' daughter and only child from his second marriage to [[Aelia Paetina]], and to the young [[Claudia Octavia]] and [[Britannicus]], Claudius' children with Valeria Messalina. Agrippina removed or eliminated anyone from the palace or the imperial court who she thought was loyal and dedicated to the memory of the late Messalina. She also eliminated or removed anyone who she considered was a potential threat to her position and the future of her son, one of her victims being Nero's second paternal aunt and Messalina's mother [[Domitia Lepida the Younger]].

In 49, Agrippina presided over the exercises of Roman legions. The [[Celts|Celtic]] King [[Caratacus]] assumed that she, along with Claudius, was the martial leader and bowed before her throne with the same homage and gratitude as he accorded the emperor.
In 50, Agrippina was granted the honorific title of [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]], a title which, up until this point, no other imperial woman had ever received in the lifetime of her husband. She was only the third Roman woman ([[Livia]] Drusilla and [[Antonia Minor]] received this title) and only the second living Roman woman (the first being Livia) to receive this title. Also that year, Claudius had founded a Roman colony and called the colony ''Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensis'' or ''Agrippinensium'', today known as [[Cologne]], after Agrippina who was born there. This colony was the only Roman colony to be named after a Roman woman. In 51, she was given a carpentum which she used. A carpentum was a sort of ceremonial carriage usually reserved for priests, such as the [[Vestal Virgin]]s, and sacred statues. That same year she appointed [[Sextus Afranius Burrus]] as the head of the [[Praetorian Guard]], replacing the previous head of the Praetorian Guard, [[Rufrius Crispinus]].

Agrippina successfully manipulated and influenced Claudius into adopting her son and having him become his successor. Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus in 50 was adopted by his great maternal uncle and stepfather. Lucius’ name was changed to '''[[Nero]] Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus''' and he became Claudius’s adopted son, heir and recognised successor. Agrippina and Claudius betrothed Nero to Octavia and Agrippina arranged to have [[Seneca the Younger]] return from exile to tutor the future emperor. Claudius chose to adopt Nero because of his Julian and Claudian lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' XII.25&lt;/ref&gt; Agrippina deprived Britannicus of his heritage and further isolated him from his biological father and succession for the throne in every way possible. For instance, in 51, Agrippina ordered the execution of Britannicus’ tutor Sosibius because he had confronted her and was outraged by Claudius’ adoption of Nero and his choice of Nero as successor, instead of choosing his own natural son Britannicus, although it should be noted that Tiberius had chosen Caligula as successor along with his grandson [[Tiberius Gemellus]] without any approbation, at the time - Caligula later had his co-successor killed.

Nero and Octavia were married on June 9, 53. Claudius later repented of marrying Agrippina and adopting Nero, began to favor Britannicus, and started preparing him for the throne. This was the motive that is claimed by many that Agrippina needed to eliminate Claudius. The ancient sources credited her with poisoning Claudius on October 13, 54 with a plate of poisoned [[mushroom]]s at a banquet, thus enabling [[Nero]] to quickly take the throne as emperor. Accounts vary wildly with regard to this private incident and according to more modern sources, it is quite possible that Claudius died of natural causes, a more likely cause considering that he was 63 years old.&lt;ref name = &quot;yyroia&quot;/&gt;

==Reign of Nero==
===Power struggle between mother and son===
[[Image:Nero Palatino Inv618.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Marble bust of [[Nero]]. Antiquarium of the Palatine.]]
Agrippina was named a priestess of the cult of the deified Claudius. She was allowed to visit senate meetings, watch and hear the meetings behind a curtain. This evidently shows that she had real power.

In the first months of Nero’s reign Agrippina controlled her son and the empire. She lost control over Nero when he began to have an affair with the freedwoman [[Claudia Acte]], which Agrippina strongly disapproved of and violently scolded him for. Agrippina began to support [[Britannicus]] in her attempt to make him emperor. Britannicus was secretly poisoned on Nero’s orders during a banquet in February 55. The power struggle between Agrippina and her son had begun.

Agrippina between 55 and 58 became very watchful and had a critical eye over her son. In 55, Agrippina was forced out of the palace by her son to live in imperial residence. Nero deprived his mother of all honors and powers, and even removed her Roman and German bodyguards. Nero even threatened his mother he would abdicate the throne and would go to live on the Greek Island of [[Rhodes]], a place where [[Tiberius]] had lived after divorcing [[Julia the Elder]]. Pallas also was dismissed from the court. The fall of Pallas and the opposition of Burrus and Seneca, contributed to Agrippina's loss of authority.&lt;ref name=power&gt;Simon Hornblower, Antony Spawforth – E.A. (edd.), [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]], [[Oxford University Press]], [[Oxford]], 2003
-  | 777.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards 57, Agrippina was expelled from the palace and went to live in a riverside estate in [[Misenum]]. While Agrippina lived there or when she went on short visits to Rome, Nero had sent people to annoy her. Although living in Misenum, she was still very popular, powerful and influential. Agrippina and Nero would see each other on short visits.

===Death and aftermath===
The circumstances that surround Agrippina's death are uncertain due to historical contradictions and anti-Nero bias.  All surviving stories of Agrippina's death contradict themselves and each other, and are generally fantastical.

====Tacitus's account====
According to [[Tacitus]], in 58, Nero became involved with the noble woman [[Poppaea Sabina]]. With the reasoning that a divorce from Octavia and a marriage to Poppaea was not politically feasible with Agrippina alive, Nero decided to kill Agrippina.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' XIV.1&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, Nero did not marry Poppaea until 62, calling into question this motive.&lt;ref&gt;See Dawson, Alexis, &quot;Whatever Happened to Lady Agrippina?&quot; ''The Classical Quarterly'' (1969) p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, [[Suetonius]] reveals that Poppaea's husband, [[Otho]], was not sent away by Nero until after Agrippina's death in 59, making it highly unlikely that already married Poppaea would be pressing Nero.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Caesars'', Life of Otho 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Some modern historians theorize that Nero's decision to kill Agrippina was prompted by her plotting to set Gaius [[Rubellius Plautus]] (Nero's maternal second cousin) or [[Britannicus]] (Claudius' biological son) on the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Robert. ''Heirs and Rivals to Nero'', Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 86. (1955), p. 202. Silana accuses Agrippina of plotting to bring up Plautus in 55, Tacitus, ''Annals'' XIII.19; Silana is recalled from exile after Agrippina's power waned, Tacitus, ''Annals' XIV.12; Plautus is exiled in 60, Tacitus, ''Annals'' XIV.22&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacitus claims that Nero considered poisoning or stabbing her, but felt these methods were too difficult and suspicious, so he settled on building a self-sinking boat.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' XIV.3&lt;/ref&gt;  Though aware of the plot, Agrippina embarked on this boat and was nearly crushed by a collapsing lead ceiling only to be saved by the side of a sofa breaking the ceiling's fall.&lt;ref name = &quot;lpygle&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' XIV.5&lt;/ref&gt; Though the collapsing ceiling missed Agrippina, it crushed her attendant who was outside by the helm.&lt;ref name = &quot;lpygle&quot;/&gt;  The boat failed to sink from the lead ceiling, so the crew then sank the boat, but Agrippina swam to shore.&lt;ref name = &quot;lpygle&quot;/&gt;  Her friend, [[Acerronia Polla]], was attacked by oarsmen while still in the water, and was either bludgeoned to death or drowned.  Agrippina was met at the shore by crowds of admirers.&lt;ref name = &quot;eezojs&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' XIV.8&lt;/ref&gt; News of Agrippina's survival reached Nero so he sent three assassins to stab her.&lt;ref name = &quot;eezojs&quot;/&gt;

====Suetonius's account====
According to [[Suetonius]], Nero was annoyed at his mother being too watchful and tried three times to poison Agrippina, but she took the antidotes in time and survived.&lt;ref name = &quot;wtjprb&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Caesars'', Life of Nero 34&lt;/ref&gt;  He then tried to crush her with a mechanical ceiling over her bed at her residence.&lt;ref name = &quot;wtjprb&quot;/&gt; After this failed, he devised a collapsable boat, which would either have its cabin fall in or become shipwrecked.  Nero then ordered captains of a different boat to ram this boat while Agrippina was aboard.&lt;ref name = &quot;wtjprb&quot;/&gt;  Nero heard Agrippina survived the wreck so he ordered her to be executed and framed it as a suicide.&lt;ref name = &quot;wtjprb&quot;/&gt;

====Cassius Dio's account====
The tale of [[Cassius Dio]] is also somewhat different. It starts again with Poppaea as the motive behind the murder.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LXIII.11&lt;/ref&gt;  Nero designed a ship that would open at the bottom while at sea.&lt;ref name = &quot;hltdlf&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LXIII.12&lt;/ref&gt;  Agrippina was put aboard and after the bottom of the ship opened up, she fell into the water.&lt;ref name = &quot;hltdlf&quot;/&gt;  Agrippina swam to shore so Nero sent an assassin to kill her.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LXIII.13&lt;/ref&gt;  Nero then claimed Agrippina plotted to kill him and committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LXIII.14&lt;/ref&gt; Her reputed last words, uttered as the assassin was about to strike, were '''&quot;Smite my womb&quot;''', the implication here being she wished to be destroyed first in that part of her body that had given birth to so &quot;abominable a son.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''Europe: A history'' p. 687&lt;/ref&gt;

====Burial====
After Agrippina's death, Nero viewed her corpse and commented how beautiful she was, according to some.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' XIV.9&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was cremated that night on a dining couch. At his mother's funeral, Nero was witless, speechless and rather scared. When the news spread that Agrippina had died, the Roman army, senate and various people sent him letters of congratulations that he had murdered his mother.

====Aftermath====
During the remainder of Nero's reign, Agrippina's grave was not covered or enclosed. Her household later on gave her a modest tomb in [[Misenum]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Nero would have his mother’s death on his conscience. He felt so guilty he would sometimes have nightmares about his mother. He even saw his mother’s ghost and got [[Persia]]n magicians to scare her away. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Years before she died, Agrippina had visited [[astrologer]]s to ask about her son’s future. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The astrologers had rather accurately predicted that her son would become emperor and would kill her. She replied, &quot;Let him kill me, provided he becomes emperor,&quot; according to [[Tacitus]].

==Perspectives on Agrippina's personality==
===Ancient===
*Note that most ancient Roman sources are quite critical of Agrippina the Younger, because she was seen as stepping outside the conservative Roman ideals regarding the roles of women in society.
*[[Tacitus]]: Critical view, considered her vicious and had a strong disposition against her due to her femininity and influential role in politics. Perhaps the most comprehensive of Ancient sources. Others are [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]].

===Modern===

* [[Howard Hayes Scullard|Scullard]]: A critical view of Agrippina, suggesting she was ambitious and unscrupulous and a depraved sexual [[Psychopathy|psychopath]]. &quot;Agrippina struck down a series of victims; no man or woman was safe if she suspected rivalry or desired their wealth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|H.H. Scullard}}, ''From the Gracchi to Nero: History of Rome from 133 B.C.to A.D. 68'', London, 1982&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Guglielmo Ferrero|Ferrero]]: Sympathetic and understanding, suggesting Agrippina has been judged harshly by history. Suggesting her marriage to Claudius was to a weak emperor who was, because of his hesitations and terrors, a threat to the imperial authority and government. She saw it her duty to compensate for the innumerable deficiencies of her strange husband through her own intelligence and strength of will.

{{Cuisine of China}}'''American Chinese cuisine''' refers to the style of food served by many [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] [[restaurants]] in the [[United States]]. This type of cooking typically caters to [[Western World|Western]] tastes, and differs significantly from the [[Chinese cuisine|original Chinese cuisine]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
In the 19th century, Cantonese restaurateurs developed American Chinese cuisine when they modified their food to suit a more Western palate. First catering to [[railroad]] workers, restaurants were established in towns where Chinese food was completely unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coe Chop Suey&quot;&gt; Andrew Coe &quot;Chop Suey: A Cultural History of Chines Food in the United States&quot; New York: Oxford University Press, 2009. Print&lt;/ref&gt; These restaurant workers adapted to using local ingredients and catered to their customers' tastes. Dishes on the menu were often given numbers, and often a roll and butter were offered on the side.

In the process, chefs invented dishes such as [[General Tso's Chicken]], and developed a style of Chinese food not found in China. Restaurants (along with Chinese laundries) provided an ethnic niche for small businesses at a time when the Chinese people were excluded from most jobs in the wage economy by racial discrimination or lack of language fluency.

==Differences from native Chinese cuisines==
{{Ref improve section|date=June 2008}}
American Chinese food typically treats [[vegetable]]s as [[garnish (food)|garnish]] while cuisines of China emphasize vegetables. This can be seen in the use of [[carrots]] and [[tomato]]es. Native Chinese cuisine makes frequent use of Asian [[leafy vegetable]]s like [[bok choy]] and [[kai-lan]] and puts a greater emphasis on fresh [[meat]] and [[seafood]]. As a result, American Chinese food is usually less pungent than authentic cuisine.{{dubious|date=November 2010}}

[[Image:Chinese buffet2.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] [[buffet]] restaurant in the United States of America]]
[[Stir-frying]], [[Pan frying|pan-frying]], and [[deep-frying]] tend to be the most common [[Chinese cooking techniques]] used in this cuisine, which are all easily done using a [[wok]]. The food also has a reputation for high levels of [[Monosodium glutamate|MSG]] to enhance the flavor. The symptoms of a so-called [[Glutamic acid (flavor)#Research into health effects|Chinese restaurant syndrome]] or &quot;Chinese food syndrome&quot; have been attributed to a glutamate sensitivity, but carefully controlled scientific studies have not demonstrated such negative effects of glutamate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2005/jul/10/foodanddrink.features3 &quot;If MSG is so bad for you, why doesn't everyone in Asia have a headache?&quot;], &quot;The Observer&quot;, 10 July 2005, retrieved 18 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Market forces and customer demand have encouraged many restaurants to offer &quot;MSG Free&quot; or &quot;No MSG&quot; menus.
[[File:FriedWonton.jpg|thumb|Carryout Chinese food is typically served in paper carton with a wire bale.]]
American Chinese cuisine often uses ingredients not native and very rarely used in China. One such example is the common use of western [[broccoli]] (xi lan, 西蘭) instead of Chinese broccoli ([[gai lan]], 芥蘭) in American Chinese cuisine. Occasionally western broccoli is also referred to as ''sai lan fa'' (in Cantonese) in order not to confuse the two styles of broccoli. Among Chinese speakers, however, it is typically understood that one is referring to the leafy vegetable unless otherwise specified. This is also the case with the words for [[carrot]] (''luo buo or lo bac'') or (''hong luo buo'' hung meaning red) and [[onion]] (''cong''). ''Lo bac'', in Cantonese, refers to the [[daikon]], a large, blandly flavored white radish. The orange western carrot is known in some areas of China as &quot;foreign Daikon&quot; (or more properly ''hung lo bac'' in Cantonese, ''hung'' meaning &quot;red&quot;). When the word for onion, ''chung'', is used, it is understood that one is referring to &quot;green onions&quot; (otherwise known to English-speakers as ''[[scallion]]s'' or ''spring onions''). The many-layered onion common in the United States is called ''yeung chung''. This translates as &quot;western onion&quot;. These names make it evident that the American broccoli, carrot, and onion are not indigenous to China and therefore are less common in the cuisines of China. Since [[tomato]]es are [[New World]] plants, they are also fairly new to China and Chinese cuisine. Tomato-based sauces can be found in some American Chinese dishes such as the &quot;beef and tomato. Hence, if a dish contains significant amounts of any of these ingredients, it has most likely been Westernized. Even more divergent are American stir-fry dishes inspired by Chinese food, that may contain brown rice instead of white, with grated cheese; milk products are almost always absent from traditional Chinese food.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[Ming Tsai]], the owner of the Blue Ginger restaurant in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], said that American Chinese restaurants typically try to have food representing 3-5 regions of China at one time, have [[chop suey]], or have &quot;fried vegetables and some protein in a thick sauce,&quot; &quot;eight different sweet and sour dishes,&quot; or &quot;a whole page of 20 different chow meins or fried rice dishes.&quot; When asked by a [[CNN]] interviewer about whether American Chinese foods &quot;stand as its own cuisine,&quot; Tsai said &quot;I don’t think so. Chinese-American cuisine is “dumbed-down” Chinese food. It’s adapted for the wrong reasons, to be blander, thicker and sweeter for the American public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2011/01/19/chef-ming-tsai-wants-you-to-have-a-chinese-friend/?hpt=C2 Chef Ming Tsai wants you to have a Chinese friend].&quot; [[CNN]]. January 19, 2011. Retrieved on January 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most American Chinese establishments cater to non-Chinese customers with menus written in English or containing pictures. If separate Chinese-language menus are available, they typically feature delicacies like [[liver (food)|liver]], chicken feet or other exotic meat dishes that might deter Western customers.  In New York's Chinatown, the restaurants were known for having a &quot;phantom&quot; menu with food preferred by ethnic Chinese, but believed to be disliked by non-Chinese Americans.&lt;ref&gt;http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2009/02/anthony_bourdain_plays_it_safe.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dishes==
===American Chinese dishes===
Dishes that often appear on American Chinese menus include:
* [[General Tso's Chicken]]&amp;mdash; chunks of chicken that are dipped in a batter and deep-fried and seasoned with ginger, garlic, sesame oil, scallions, and hot chili peppers.
* [[Sesame chicken]]&amp;mdash; boned, battered, and deep-fried chicken which is then dressed with a translucent red or orange, sweet and mildly spicy sauce, made from soy sauce, corn starch, vinegar, chicken broth, and sugar.
* [[Chinese chicken salad]] &amp;mdash; It usually contains uncooked leafy greens and crispy noodles (or fried wonton skins) and sesame dressing. Some restaurants serve the salad with mandarin oranges.
* [[Chop suey]] &amp;mdash; connotes &quot;leftovers&quot; in Chinese. It is usually a mix of vegetables and meat in a [[brown sauce]] but can also be served in a white sauce.
* [[Chow mein]] &amp;mdash; literally means 'stir-fried [[noodles]].' Chow mein consists of fried crispy noodles with bits of meat and vegetables. It can come with chicken, pork, shrimp or beef, the latter often with red tomatoes.
* [[Chow fun]] &amp;mdash; similar to Lo Mein, but made with thick, broad noodles.
* [[Crab rangoon]] &amp;mdash; Fried [[wonton]] skins stuffed with (usually) artificial [[crab]] meat ([[surimi]]) and [[cream cheese]].
* [[Fortune cookie]] &amp;mdash; Invented in San Francisco as a westernized version of the Japanese [[omikuji]] [[senbei]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/16/dining/16fort.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Solving a Riddle Wrapped in a Mystery Inside a Cookie | date=January 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; fortune cookies have become sweetened and found their way to many American Chinese restaurants. Fortune cookies have become so popular that even some authentic Chinese restaurants serve them at the end of the meal as dessert and may feature Chinese translations of the English fortunes.
* [[Royal Beef]] - deep-fried sliced beef, doused in a wine sauce and often served with steamed broccoli.
* [[Yaka mein]] - Chinese-Creole food found in [[New Orleans]] with similarities to [[Beef noodle soup]]

====Regional American Chinese dishes====
* [[Chow mein sandwich]]&amp;mdash; Sandwich of chow mein and gravy (Southeastern [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]]).
* [[Chicken fingers]]&amp;mdash; boneless pieces of chicken, dipped in egg batter and deep fried. Served as an appetizer, they can also be covered in [[sweet and sour sauce]] and served as an entrée ([[New England]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eagletribune.com/local/x2131359902/Chinese-restaurants-ready-for-years-busiest-night&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chop suey sandwich]] &amp;mdash; Sandwich of chicken chop suey on a hamburger bun (North Shore of [[Massachusetts]] &amp;mdash; the only known remaining restaurants serving this specialty are &quot;Genghis Salem&quot; and &quot;Salem Lowe.&quot; ([[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts]]).
* [[St. Paul sandwich]] &amp;mdash; Egg foo young patty in plain white sandwich bread ([[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]).
* [[Cashew chicken#Springfield-style cashew chicken|Springfield-style cashew chicken]] &amp;mdash; a style of [[cashew chicken]] that combines breaded deep fried chicken, cashews, and oyster sauce. ([[Springfield, Missouri]]).

===Westernized versions of native Chinese dishes===
[[Image:Egg foo young.JPG|thumb|Egg foo young]]
* [[Egg foo young]] &amp;mdash; A Chinese-style omelet with vegetables and meat, usually served with a brown gravy.
* [[Egg roll]] &amp;mdash; While native Chinese [[spring roll]]s have a thin crispy skin with mushrooms, bamboo, and other vegetables inside, the Westernized version (specifically the version found in such American Northeast metro areas as Boston and New York) uses a thick, fried skin stuffed with cabbage and usually bits of meat or seafood (such as pork or shrimp), but no egg.
* [[Fried rice]] &amp;mdash; Fried rice dishes are popular offerings in American Chinese food due to the speed and ease of preparation and their appeal to American tastes. Fried rice is generally prepared with rice cooled overnight, allowing restaurants to put unserved leftover rice to good use. It typically uses more soy sauce than the mainland version.
* [[Ginger beef]] &amp;mdash; 生薑牛肉 Tender beef cut in chunks, mixed with ginger and Chinese mixed vegetables.
* [[Ginger Fried Beef]] &amp;mdash; 乾炒牛肉絲 Tender beef cut in strings, battered, deep dried, then re-fried in wok mixed with a sweet sauce, a variation of a popular Northern Chinese dish.
* [[Kung Pao chicken]] &amp;mdash; The authentic [[Sichuan]] dish is quite spicy, and the Westernized versions tend to be less so if at all.
* [[Lo mein]] &amp;mdash; The term means &quot;stirred noodles&quot;; these noodles are frequently made with eggs and flour, making them chewier than simply using water. Thick, spaghetti shaped noodles are pan fried with vegetables and meat. Sometimes this dish is referred to as &quot;chow mein&quot; (which literally means &quot;fried noodles&quot; in Cantonese).
* Mei Fun (see [[Rice vermicelli]] dishes)
* [[Moo shu pork]] &amp;mdash; The native Chinese version uses more typically Chinese ingredients (including [[wood ear]] fungi and [[daylily]] buds) and thin flour pancakes while the American version uses vegetables more familiar to Americans and thicker pancakes. This dish is quite popular in Chinese restaurants in the United States, but not so popular in China.
* [[Wonton soup]] &amp;mdash; In most American Chinese restaurants, only wonton dumplings in broth are served, while native Chinese versions may come with noodles. Authentic Cantonese Wonton Soup is a full meal in itself consisting of thin egg noodles and several pork and prawn wontons in a pork or chicken soup broth or noodle broth. Westernized wontons, especially in takeout restaurants, are often made with thicker dough than the authentic version.

==Regional variations on American Chinese cuisine==
===San Francisco===
Since the early 1990s, many American Chinese restaurants influenced by [[California cuisine]] have opened in San Francisco and the Bay Area. The trademark dishes of American Chinese cuisine remain on the menu, but there is more emphasis on fresh vegetables, and the selection is vegetarian-friendly.

This new cuisine has exotic ingredients like [[mango]]s and [[portobello mushroom]]s. [[Brown rice]] is often offered as an optional alternative to [[white rice]]. Some restaurants substitute grilled wheat flour tortillas for the rice pancakes in mu shu dishes. This occurs even in some restaurants that would not otherwise be identified as California Chinese, both the more Westernized places and the more authentic places. There is a Mexican bakery that sells some restaurants thinner tortillas made for use with mu shu. Mu shu purists do not always react positively to this trend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.asianweek.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=5b6c82e1ca42c0c4a952c682acd5b192 AsianWeek.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many restaurants serving more native-style Chinese cuisines exist, due to the high numbers and proportion of ethnic Chinese in San Francisco and the Bay Area. Restaurants specializing in Cantonese, Sichuanese, Hunanese, Northern Chinese, Shanghainese, Taiwanese, and Hong Kong traditions are widely available, as are more specialized restaurants such as seafood restaurants, [[Hong Kong-style Western cuisine|Hong Kong-style diners and cafes]] (also known as ''[[Cha chaan teng]]'' (茶餐廳)), [[dim sum]] teahouses, and [[hot pot]] restaurants. Many Chinatown areas also feature Chinese bakeries, [[boba milk tea]] shops, [[siu mei|roasted meat]], [[Chinese Buddhist cuisine|vegetarian cuisine]], and specialized dessert shops. [[Chop suey]] is not widely available in [[San Francisco]], and the city's chow mein is different from Midwestern chow mein.

Authentic restaurants with Chinese-language menus may offer 黃毛雞 ([[Yale romanisation#Cantonese|Cantonese Yale]]: wòhng mouh gāai, [[Pinyin]]: huángmáo jī, literally yellow-feather chicken), essentially a [[free range|free-range]] chicken, as opposed to typical American mass-farmed chicken. Yellow-hair chicken is valued for its flavor, but needs to be cooked properly to be tender due to its lower fat and higher muscle content. This dish usually does not appear on the English-language menu.

[[Dau Miu]] ({{zh|c=豆苗|p=dòumiáo}}) is a Chinese vegetable that has become popular since the early 1990s, and now not only appears on English-language menus, usually as &quot;pea shoots&quot;, but is often served by upscale non-Asian restaurants as well. Originally it was only available during a few months of the year, but it is now grown in greenhouses and is available year-round.

===Boston===
Beginning in the late 20th century, many American Chinese restaurants inspired by the region have opened in [[Boston]] and the North Shore of Massachusetts. The classic dishes of American Chinese cuisine are still on the menu, but there is greater emphasis on spicier dishes than other regions in the United States. The selection is also slightly closer to dishes served in mainland China, albeit with heavier sauces.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surviveandthriveboston.com/2010/12/chinese-people-tastes-differ-f.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hawaii===
Hawaiian-Chinese food developed a bit differently from the continental United States. Owing to the diversity of ethnicities in Hawaii and the history of the [[Chinese immigration to Hawaii|Chinese influence in Hawaii]], resident Chinese cuisine forms a component of the [[cuisine of Hawaii]], which is a [[fusion cuisine|fusion]] of different culinary traditions. Some Chinese dishes are typically served as part of [[plate lunch]]es in Hawaii. The names of foods are different as well, such as ''[[Manapua]]'', from Hawaiian meaning &quot;chewed up pork&quot; for dim sum ''bao'', though the meat is not necessarily pork.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ahenobarbus''' was the name of a [[plebeian]] family of the Domitia [[gens]] in the late Republic and early [[Principate]] of [[ancient Rome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last = Smith  | first = William  | author-link = William Smith (lexicographer)  | contribution = Ahenobarbus  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 83–84  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0092.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name means &quot;red-beard&quot; (literally, &quot;bronze-beard&quot;) in [[Latin]]. According to legend, [[Castor and Pollux]] announced to one of their ancestors the victory of the Romans over the Latins at the [[battle of Lake Regillus]], and, to confirm the truth of what they had just said, they stroked his black hair and beard, which immediately became red.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[Nero]]'' 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Aemil.'' 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], vi. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''Apol.'' 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmad Khan enlisted as a young soldier in the military of the [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid kingdom]] and quickly rose to become a [[commander]] of four thousand [[Durrani|Abdali]] [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durrani-dynasty&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan/21396/The-Durrani-dynasty?anchor=ref306642|title=The Durrani dynasty |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of [[Nader Shah|Nader Shah Afshar]] of [[Iran|Persia]] in June 1747, Abdali became the [[Emir]] of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. Rallying his [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribes and allies, he pushed east towards the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and the [[Maratha Empire]] of [[India]] as well as west towards the disintegrating Afsharid Empire of Persia and north toward the [[Khanate of Bukhara]]. Within a few years he had conquered all of today's Afghanistan and [[Pakistan]], including much of northeastern [[Iran]] and the [[Punjab region]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Engels&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chayes&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Punishment of Virtue: Inside Afghanistan After the Taliban|last1=Chayes|first1=Sarah|authorlink=|coauthors=|volume=|year=2006|publisher=Univ. of Queensland Press|location=|isbn=9781932705546|page=99|pages=402|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4XMSl-aFk1YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defeated the [[Maratha]]s eight times, one of his major victory was at the [[Battle of Panipat (1761)|1761 Battle of Panipat]] which was fought north of [[Delhi]] in India.

Ahmad Khan was from the [[Sadozai (Pastun tribe)|Sadozai]] section of the [[Popalzai]] clan of the [[Durrani|Abdali]] [[Pashtuns]]. His father and grandfather were both killed in a battle, and the young Ahmad Khan fled to take refuge in Kandahar with the [[Ghilzai]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fall of the Mughal Empire, Volume 1, by Sir Jadunath Sarkar (1964), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; During his teenage years, Ahmad Khan and his elder brother, Zulfikar, were imprisoned inside a fortress by [[Hussain Hotaki]], the Ghilzai governor of the [[Kandahar Province]]. Shah Hussain commanded a powerful tribe of Pashtun fighters, having conquered the eastern part of Persia in 1722 with his brother [[Mahmud Hotaki|Mahmud]], and trodden the throne of the Persian [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]].

In around 1731, [[Nader Shah|Nader Shah Afshar]], the new ruler of Persia, began enlisting the Abdali Pashtuns in his army. After conquering Kandahar in 1738, Ahmad Khan and his brother were freed by the new Persian ruler and provided careers in his administration. The Ghilzais were expelled from the city of Kandahar and the Abdalis were allowed to settle there instead.&lt;ref name=EofI&gt;C. Collin-Davies (1999). &quot;Ahmad Shah Durrani&quot;.

== Commander in the Afsharid military ==
{{See|Afsharid dynasty}}
Nader Shah favored Abdali not only because he came from a well respected family or tribe but also due to his handsome features as well as both being Khorasanians. Ahmad Khan proved himself in Nader Shah's service and was promoted from a personal attendant (''yasāwal'') to command a cavalry of Abdali tribesmen. He quickly rose to command a cavalry contingent estimated at four thousand strong,&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffiths&quot;&gt;Griffiths, John. C (2001) Afghanistan: A History of Conflict p12&lt;/ref&gt; composed chiefly of Abdalis, in the service of the Shah on his [[Nader_Shah#Invasion_of_India|invasion of India]].
[[File:A Nawab of Awadh, Lucknow, India. 19th century.jpg|thumb|[[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid forces]] negotiate with a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Nawab]].]]

Popular history has it that the brilliant but megalomaniac Nader Shah could see the talent in his young commander. Later on according to Pashtun legend, it is said that in Delhi Nader Shah summoned Ahmad Shah, and said, &quot;Come forward Ahmad Abdali. Remember Ahmad Khan Abdali, that after me the Kingship will pass on to you.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer&quot;&gt;Singer, Andre (1983) Lords of the Khyber. The story of the North West Frontier&lt;/ref&gt;

Nader Shah's rule abruptly ended in June 1747 when he was assassinated by his own guards. The guards involved in the assassination did so secretly so as to prevent the Abdalis from coming to their King's rescue. However, Ahmad Khan was told that Nader Shah had been killed by one of his wives. Despite the danger of being attacked, the Abdali contingent led by Ahmad Khan rushed either to save Nader Shah or to confirm what happened. Upon reaching the King's tent, they were only to see Nader Shah's body and severed head. Having served him so loyally, the Abdalis wept at having failed their leader,&lt;ref&gt;[[Olaf Caroe]], ''The Pathans'' (1981 reprint)&lt;/ref&gt; and headed back to Kandahar. On their way back to Kandahar, the Abdalis had decided that Ahmad Khan would be their new leader, and already began calling him as ''Ahmad Shah''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EofI&quot;/&gt;
{{quote|''After the capture of Qandahar, Nadir Shah sent him to [[Māzandarān Province|Mazandaran]] where the young Pashtun became governor. At the time of Nadir's death, he commanded a contingent of Abdali Pashtuns. Realizing that his life was in jeopardy if he stayed among the Persians who had murdered Nadir Shah, he decided to leave the Persian camp, and with his 4,000 troops he proceeded to Qandahar. Along the way and by sheer luck, they managed to capture a caravan with booty from India. He and his troops were rich; moreover, they were experienced fighters. In short, they formed a formidable force of young Pashtun soldiers who were loyal to their high-ranking leader.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Vogelsang&quot;/&gt;}}

== Rise to power ==
[[File:Ahmad Shah Durrani - 1747.jpg|thumb|250px|The October 1747 [[coronation]] ceremony of Ahmad Shah Durrani as [[List of leaders of Afghanistan|Emir of Afghanistan]] shown in this contemporary painting.]]
In October 1747, the chiefs of the Abdali tribes met near Kandahar for a [[Loya Jirga]] to choose a leader. For nine days serious discussions were held among the candidates in the Argah. Ahmad Shah kept silent by not campaigning for himself. At last Sabir Shah, a religious figure from the area, came out of his sanctuary and stood before those in the Jirga and said, &quot;He found no one worthy for leadership except Ahmah Shah. He is the most trustworthy and talented for the job. He had Sabir's blessing for the nomination because only his shoulders could carry this responsibility&quot;. The leaders and everyone agreed unanimously. Ahmad Shah was chosen to lead the Afghan tribes. Coins where struck after his coronation as King occurred near the tomb of Shaikh Surkh, adjacent to Nader Abad Fort.

Despite being younger than other claimants, Ahmad Shah had several overriding factors in his favour: 
*He was a direct descendant of [[Sado]], patriarch of the Sadozai clan, the most prominent tribe amongst the Pashtuns at the time;
*He was unquestionably a charismatic leader and seasoned warrior who had at his disposal a trained, mobile force of several thousand cavalrymen;
*Haji Ajmal Khan, the chief of the [[Mohammedzai]]s (also known as [[Barakzai]]s) which were rivals of the Sadodzais, already withdrew out of the election&lt;ref name=&quot;EofI&quot;/&gt;

One of Ahmad Shah's first acts as chief was to adopt the title ''Padshah durr-i dawran'' ('King, &quot;pearl of the age&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC&quot;/&gt;

==Forming the last Afghan empire==
{{See|Durrani Empire}}
[[File:Afghan royal soldiers of the Durrani Empire.jpg|thumb|upright|Afghan royal soldiers of the [[Durrani Empire]] (also referred to as the Afghan Empire).]]
Following his predecessor, Ahmad Shah Durrani set up a special force closest to him consisting mostly of his fellow Durranis and other Pashtuns, as well as [[Tajik people|Tajiks]], [[Qizilbash]] and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;EofI&quot;/&gt; Durrani began his military conquest by capturing [[Ghazni]] from the Ghilzais and then wresting [[Kabul]] from the local ruler, and thus strengthened his hold over eastern Khorasan which is most of present-day Afghanistan. Leadership of the various Afghan tribes rested mainly on the ability to provide booty for the clan, and Durrani proved remarkably successful in providing both booty and occupation for his followers. Apart from invading the [[Punjab region]] three times between the years 1747–1753, he captured [[Herat]] in 1750 and both [[Nishapur]] (Neyshābūr) and [[Mashhad]] in 1751.
[[File:Afghanistan unter Ahmad Schah Durrani.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Map showing the estimated area of the [[Durrani Empire]].]]

Durrani first crossed the [[Indus River]] in 1748, the year after his ascension – his forces sacked and absorbed [[Lahore]] during that expedition. The following year (1749), the Mughal ruler was induced to cede [[Sindh]] and all of the Punjab including the vital trans Indus River to him, in order to save his capital from being attacked by the Afghan forces of the Durrani Empire. Having thus gained substantial territories to the east without a fight, Ahmad Shah and his Afghan forces turned westward to take possession of Herat, which was ruled by Nader Shah's grandson, [[Shah Rukh of Persia]]. The city fell to Ahmad Shah in 1750, after almost a year of siege and bloody conflict; Ahmad Shah and his forces then pushed on into present-day [[Iran]], capturing Nishapur and Mashhad in 1751. He then pardoned Shah Rukh and reconstituted Khorasan, but a tributary of the Durrani Empire. This marked the westernmost border of the Durrani Empire as set by the [[Pul-i-Abrisham]], on the Mashhad-Tehran road.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sykes&quot;&gt;Sykes, Percy (2008)''A History of Persia'' READ books. ISBN 9781443724081&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in the preceding three years, the [[Sikh]]s had occupied the city of Lahore, and Ahmad Shah had to return in 1751 to oust them. In 1752, Ahmad Shah with his forces invaded and reduced [[Kashmir]]. He next sent an army to subdue the areas north of the [[Hindu Kush]]. In short order, the powerful army brought under its control the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]], Tajik and [[Hazara people]]s of northern, central, and western Afghanistan. In 1752, Kashmiri nobles invited Ahmad Shah Durrani to invade the province and oust the ineffectual Mughal rulers.

Then in 1756-57, in what was his fourth invasion of India, Ahmad Shah sacked [[Delhi]] and plundered  [[Agra]], [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], and [[Vrndavana]]. However, he did not displace the Mughal dynasty, which remained in nominal control as long as the ruler acknowledged Ahmad's suzerainty over the Punjab, Sindh, and Kashmir. He installed a puppet emperor, [[Alamgir II]], on the Mughal throne, and arranged marriages for himself and his son [[Timur Shah Durrani|Timur]] into the imperial family that same year. He married the daughter of the Mughal emperor [[Muhammad Shah]]. His de facto suzerainity was accepted by the [[East India Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-2TH8UYeAaoC&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;ots=Q207U6gF1K&amp;dq=Ahmad%20Shah%20Bangash&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q=Panipat&amp;f=false The rise of the Indo-Afghan empire, c.1710-1780 By Jos J. L. Gommans]&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving his second son Timur Shah (who was wed to the daughter of (Alamgir II) to safeguard his interests, Durrani finally left India to return to Afghanistan. 

On his way back he attacked the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] in [[Amritsar]] and filled its sacred pool with the blood of slaughtered cows. Durrani captured Amritsar in 1757, and sacked the [[Harmandir Sahib]] at which point the famous [[Baba Deep Singh]] and some of his loyalists were killed by the Afghans.&lt;ref name=deol&gt;{{cite book

===Third battle of Panipat===
{{Main|Third Battle of Panipat}}
[[File:The Third battle of Panipat 13 January 1761.jpg|thumb|The [[Third Battle of Panipat]], 14 January 1761, ''Hafiz Rahmat Khan'' standing right to Ahmad Shah Durrani, who is shown on a brown horse.]]
The Mughal power in northern India had been declining since the reign of [[Aurangzeb]], who died in 1707. In 1751–52, the ''Ahamdiya'' treaty was signed between the Marathas and Mughals, when [[Balaji Bajirao]] was the [[Peshwa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Panipat&quot;&gt;Patil, Vishwas. ''Panipat''.&lt;/ref&gt; Through this treaty, the Marathas controlled virtually the whole of India from their capital at [[Pune]] and Mughal rule was restricted only to Delhi(Mughals remained the nominal heads of Delhi). Marathas were now straining to expand their area of control towards the Northwest of India. Ahmad Shah sacked the Mughal capital and withdrew with the booty he coveted. To counter the Afghans, Peshwa [[Balaji Bajirao]] sent Raghunathrao. He succeeded in ousting Timur Shah and his court from India and brought Lahore, Multan, Kashmir and other subahs on the Indian side of Attock under Maratha rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;K.

He declared a [[jihad]] ([[Islam]]ic holy war) against the [[Maratha]]s, and warriors from various Pashtun tribes, as well as other tribes such as the Baloch, Tajiks, and Muslims from South Asia answered his call. Early skirmishes ended in victory for the Afghans against the smaller Maratha garrisons in northwest India. By 1759, Durrani and his army had reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced into a big enough army under the command of [[Sadashivrao Bhau]]. Once again, [[Panipat]] was the scene of a battle for control of [[northern India]]. The [[Third battle of Panipat]] (January 1761), fought between largely [[Islam|Muslim]] armies of Abdali and Nawabs and largely [[Hinduism|Hindu]] Maratha army was waged along a twelve-kilometre front, and resulted in a decisive victory for Ahmad Shah.&lt;ref&gt;for a detailed account of the battle fought see Chapter VI of The Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan by H.G. Keene. Available online at [http://emotional-literacy-education.com/classic-books-online-a/tfmeh10.htm]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Turkistan and the Uyghurs===
{{See|Kashgar#Qing_Reconquest}}
Plagued by the plight of the [[Uyghurs]] whose lands were conquered by the warring [[Qing]] dynasty, Ahmad Shah laboriously attempted to rally Muslim nations to check Qing expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Holy War in China, By Ho-dong Kim, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad Shah halted trade with Qing China and dispatched troops to [[Kokand]].&lt;ref&gt;L. J. Newby ''The Empire and the Khanate''p34&lt;/ref&gt; However, with his campaigns in India exhausting the state treasury, and with his troops stretched thin throughout Central Asia, Ahmad Shah did not have enough resources to check Qing forces. In an effort to alleviate the situation in [[East Turkistan]], Ahmad Shah sent envoys to [[Beijing]], but the talks did not yield favorable prospects for the Uyghurs.&lt;ref&gt;John K. Fairbank(1968) ''China and Central Asia, 1368-1884 In The Chinese World Order'' pp. 206–224, 337–68. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of the Sikhs in the Punjab===
During the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] betwee [[Marathas]] and [[Abdali]], The Sikhs did not support either side and decided to sitback and see what would happen. The exception was Ala Singh of [[Patiala]], who sided with the Afghans and was actually being granted and crowned the first Sikh Maharajah at the Sikh holy temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rise of the Sikh power|last=Sinha|first=Narendra Krishna|coauthors=|origyear=1973|year=2008|publisher=University of Michigan|chapter=Ala Singh |location= |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victory at Panipat was the high point of Ahmad Shah's and Afghan power, this situation was not to last long; the empire soon began to unravel. As early as by the end of 1761, the Sikhs had begun to rebel in much of the Punjab. In 1762, Ahmad Shah crossed the passes from Afghanistan for the sixth time to crush the Sikhs. He assaulted Lahore and Amritsar. Within two years, the Sikhs rebelled again, and he launched another campaign against them in 1764, resulting in an even battle. During his 8th invasion of India, the Sikhs vacated Lahore, but faced Abdali's army and general, Jahan Khan. The fear of his Indian territory falling to the Sikhs continued to obsess the Durrani's mind and he let out another campaign against Sikhs towards the close of 1766, which was his eighth invasion into India.

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Mosque in Kandahar.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[mausoleum]] of Ahmad Shah Durrani in the center of [[Kandahar|Kandahar City]], which also serves as the [[Friday Mosque]] and contains the sacred cloak that [[Islamic Prophet]] [[Muhammad]] wore.]]
Ahmad Shah Durrani died in 1772-73 in Kandahar Province. He was buried at a spot in Kandahar City, where a large mausoleum was built. It has been described in the following way:
{{quote|&quot;Under the shimmering turquoise dome that dominates the sand-blown city of Kandahar lies the body of [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]], the young Kandahari warrior who in 1747 became the region's first Durrani king. The mausoleum is covered in deep blue and white tiles behind a small grove of trees, one of which is said to cure toothache, and is a place of pilgrimage. In front of it is a small mosque with a marble vault containing one of the holiest relics in the Islamic World, a ''kherqa'', the Sacred Cloak of Prophet Mohammed that was given to Ahmad Shah by [[Mir Muhammad Murad Beg|Mured Beg]], the Emir of [[Bokhara]]. The Sacred Cloak is kept locked away, taken out only at times of great crisis but the mausoleum is open and there is a constant line of men leaving their sandals at the door and shuffling through to marvel at the surprisingly long marble tomb and touch the glass case containing Ahmad Shah's brass helmet. Before leaving they bend to kiss a length of pink velvet said to be from his robe. It bears the unmistakable scent of jasmine.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Christina (2002). ''The Sewing Circles of Herat''. HarperCollins. First Perennial edition (2004), p. 38. ISBN 0-06-050527-3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his tomb his epitaph is written:
{{quote|
&quot;The King of high rank, Ahmad Shah Durrani,
Was equal to Kisra in managing the affairs of his government.
In his time, from the awe of his glory and greatness,
The lioness nourished the stag with her milk.
From all sides in the ear of his enemies there arrived
A thousand reproofs from the tongue of his dagger.
The date of his departure for the house of mortality
Was the year of the Hijra 1186 (1772&amp;nbsp;A.D.)&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dupree&quot;&gt;[[Nancy Hatch Dupree]] – An Historical Guide To Afghanistan – ''The South (Chapter 16)''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ahmad Shah's victory over the Marathas influenced the history of the subcontinent and, in particular, [[United Kingdom|British]] policy in the region. His refusal to continue his campaigns deeper into India prevented a clash with the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] and allowed them to continue to acquire power and influence after their acquisition of [[Bengal]] in 1757. However, fear of another Afghan invasion was to haunt British policy for almost half a century after the [[Battle of Panipat (1761)|battle of Panipat]]. The acknowledgment of Abdali's military accomplishments is reflected in a British intelligence report on the Battle of Panipat, which referred to Ahmad Shah as the 'King of Kings'.&lt;ref name=&quot;British library&quot;&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelpregion/asia/afghanistan/afghanistancollection/afghansources/sources1747to1809.html &quot;Afghanistan 1747-1809: Sources in the India Office Records&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; This fear led in 1798 to a British envoy being sent to the Persian court in part to instigate the Persians in their claims on Herat to forestall an Afghan invasion of British India.&lt;ref name=&quot;British library&quot;/&gt; [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]] wrote of Ahmad Shah:
{{quote|''His military courage and activity are spoken of with admiration, both by his own subjects and the nations with whom he was engaged, either in wars or alliances. He seems to have been naturally disposed to mildness and clemency and though it is impossible to acquire sovereign power and perhaps, in Asia, to maintain it, without crimes; yet the memory of no eastern prince is stained with fewer acts of cruelty and injustice.''|[[Mountstuart Elphinstone]]}}

His successors, beginning with his son [[Timur Shah Durrani|Timur]] and ending with [[Shuja Shah Durrani]], proved largely incapable of governing the last Afghan empire and faced with advancing enemies on all sides. Much of the territory conquered by Ahmad Shah fell to others by the end of the 19th century. They not only lost the outlying territories but also alienated some [[Pashtun tribes]] and those of other Durrani lineages. Until [[Dost Mohammad Khan]]'s ascendancy in 1826, chaos reigned in Afghanistan, which effectively ceased to exist as a single entity, disintegrating into a fragmented collection of small countries or units. This policy ensured that he did not continue on the path of other conquerors like [[Babur]] or [[Muhammad of Ghor]] and make India the base for his empire.

In Pakistan, a [[short-range ballistic missile]] [[Abdali-I]], is named in the honour of [[Ahmed Shah Abdali]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GI03Df02.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ahmad Shah's poetry==
Ahmad Shah wrote a collection of [[ode]]s in his native [[Pashto language]]. He was also the author of several poems in [[Persian language|Persian]]. The most famous Pashto poem he wrote was ''Love of a Nation'':{{Cquote|
''By blood, we are immersed in love of you.''&lt;br /&gt;
''The youth lose their heads for your sake.''
''I come to you and my heart finds rest''.&lt;br /&gt;
''Away from you, grief clings to my heart like a snake''.
''I forget the throne of [[Delhi]]''&lt;br /&gt;    
''when I remember the mountain tops of my Afghan land.''&lt;br /&gt;    
''If I must choose between the world and you,''&lt;br /&gt;    
''I shall not hesitate to claim your barren deserts as my own&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.afghan-web.com/culture/poetry/poems.html# |title=Ahmad Shah Durrani (Pashto Poet)|work=Abdullah Qazi|publisher=Afghanistan Online|accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://maic.jmu.edu/journal/8.1/features/kim/kim.htm |title=A Profile of Afghanistan - Ahmad Shah Durrani (Pashto Poet)| work=Kimberly Kim |publisher=[[Mine Action Information Center]]|accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Arthur Aikin''' (19 May 1773 – 15 April 1854), [[England|English]] [[chemistry|chemist]], [[mineralogy|mineralogist]] and scientific writer, was born in [[Warrington, England|Warrington]], [[Lancashire]] into a distinguished literary family of prominent [[Unitarians]].

He was born into a family of writers, the most well known of whom was his paternal aunt, [[Anna Letitia Barbauld]], a [[man of letters|woman of letters]] who wrote poetry and essays as well as early [[children's literature]]. His father, Dr. [[John Aikin]], was a medical doctor, historian, and author. His grandfather, also called [[John Aikin (Unitarian)|John Aikin]] (1713–1780), was a Unitarian scholar and theological tutor, closely associated with [[Warrington Academy]]. His sister was [[Lucy Aikin]] (1781–1864), a historical writer.

Arthur Aikin studied chemistry under [[Joseph Priestley]] in the [[New College at Hackney]], and gave attention to the practical applications of the science. In early life he was a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister for a short time.   Aikin lectured on chemistry at Guy's Hospital for thirty-two years.  From 1803 to 1808 he was editor of ''[[Annual Review]]''. He was one of the founders of the [[Geological Society of London]] in 1807 and was its [[honorary secretary]] in 1812-1817. He contributed papers on the [[Telford and Wrekin|Wrekin]] and the [[Shropshire]] coalfield, among others, to the transactions of that society. Later he became secretary of the [[Royal Society of Arts]].  He was founder of the [[Chemical Society|Chemical Society of London]] in 1841, being its first Treasurer and second President.

He was highly esteemed as a man of sound judgment and wide knowledge. He died in [[London]].

'''''Ailanthus''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ə|ˈ|l|æ|n|θ|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;''Sunset Western Garden Book,'' 1995:606–607&lt;/ref&gt; derived from ''ailanto,'' an [[Ambonese]] word probably meaning &quot;tree of the gods&quot; or &quot;tree of heaven&quot;) is a genus of [[tree]]s belonging to the family [[Simaroubaceae]], in the order [[Sapindales]] (formerly [[Rutales]] or [[Geraniales]]). The genus is native from east [[Asia]] south to northern [[Australasia]].

They are fast-growing [[deciduous]] trees growing to 25–45 m tall, with spreading branches and large (40–100&amp;nbsp;cm) pinnate leaves with 15-41 long pointed leaflets, the terminal leaflet normally present, and the basal pairs of leaflets often lobed at their bases. The small yellow to greenish [[flower]]s are borne on branched panicles. They turn reddish later in the year and eventually brown. They stay on the tree for a long time; the male flowers have a strong odour. The odour tends to resemble the smell of strong cat urine or the spray of a male cat. Also, touching the leaves leaves an unpleasant smell on the hands. The [[fruit]] is a [[samara (fruit)|samara]] drawn out into a long wing with the seed in the middle. The wood is fine grained and satiny.

==Species==

The number of species is disputed, with some authorities accepting up to ten species, while others accept six or fewer. Species include:
*''[[Ailanthus altissima]]'' ('''Tree of Heaven''') – northern and central [[mainland China]], [[Taiwan]], arguably the best known species.
*''[[Ailanthus excelsa]]'' – [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]]
*''[[Ailanthus integrifolia]]'' – [[New Guinea]] and [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]
*''[[Ailanthus malabarica]]'' – southeast [[Asia]]
*''[[Ailanthus triphysa]]'' ('''White Siris''') – northern and eastern Australia
*''[[Ailanthus vilmoriniana]]'' ('''Downy Tree of Heaven''') – southwest China

[[File:Ailanthus altissima4.jpg|thumb|''Ailanthus altissima'' flowers]]

This genus is considered [[invasive species|invasive]] in North America and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/oxford/hi/people_and_places/nature/newsid_8582000/8582535.stm|title=Invasive species of Oxfordshire|coauthors=Peter Brown and Dr Helen Roy|date=Tuesday, 23 March 2010|publisher=BBC Oxford|accessdate=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sends out suckers that can damage pavements and walls, and in the right conditions it can spread very quickly.
It has the capacity to get to large heights and can outcompete native plant species around it.

Ailanthus are capable of forming thick blankets of roots and heavy shade to the extent that native species are prevented from being able to reclaim an area that has been logged or deforested, as well as areas that have been heavily developed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

A silk spinning moth, the [[Ailanthus silkmoth]] (''Samia cynthia''), lives on ''Ailanthus'' leaves, and yields a silk more durable and cheaper than mulberry silk, but inferior to it in fineness and gloss.  This moth has been introduced to the eastern United States and is common near many towns; it is about 12&amp;nbsp;cm across, with angulated wings, and in colour olive brown, with white markings. Other [[Lepidoptera]] whose [[larva]]e feed on ''Ailanthus'' include ''[[Endoclita|Endoclita malabaricus]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aimoin''' (c. 960-c. 1010), [[France|French]] chronicler, was born at [[Villefranche-de-Longchat]] about 960, and in early life entered the [[monastery]] of [[Fleury]], where he became a monk and passed the greater part of his life.

His chief work is a ''Historia Francorum'', or ''Libri v de Gestis Francorum'', which deals with the history of the [[Franks]] from the earliest times to 653, and was continued by other writers until the middle of the twelfth century. It was much in vogue during the [[Middle Ages]], but its historical value is now regarded as slight.  It has been edited by [[Georg Waitz|G. Waitz]] and published in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]: Scriptores'', Band xxvi (Hanover and Berlin, 1826–1892).

He also wrote a ''Vita Abbonis'', ''abbatis Floriacensis'', the last of a series of lives of the [[abbot]]s of Fleury, all of which, except the life of [[Abbo of Fleury|Abbo]], have been lost.  This has been published by [[Jean Mabillon|J. Mabillon]] in the ''[[Acta Sanctorum|Acta sanctorum ordinis sancti Benedicti]]'' (Paris, 1668–1701).

Aimoin's third work was the composition of books ii and iii of the ''Miracula sancti Benedicti'', the first book of which was written by another monk of Fleury named Adrevald.  This also appears in the ''Acta sanctorum''.

Aimoin, who died about 1010, must be distinguished from Aimoin, a monk of [[Saint-Germain-des-Pres]], who wrote ''De miraculis sancti Germani'', and a fragment ''De Normanorum gestis circa Parisiacam urbem et de divine in eos ultione tempore Caroli calvi''. Both of these are published in the ''Historiae Francorum Scriptores'', Tome ii (Paris, 1639–1649).

{{Ancient Mesopotamia}}

The '''Akkadian Empire''' ([[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] &lt;sup&gt;[[URU (cuneiform)|URU]]&lt;/sup&gt;''Akkad'' [[KI (cuneiform)|KI]],  [[Hittite cuneiform|Hittite]]  [[KUR (cuneiform)|KUR]] A.GA.DÈ.KI &quot;land of Akkad&quot;; [[Hebrew language|Biblical Hebrew]] אַכַּד ''Akkad'') was an [[empire]] centered in the city of '''Akkad''' ([[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: ''Agade'') and its surrounding region in [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WebsterNinthNewCollege&quot;&gt;Mish, Frederick C., Editor in Chief. “Akkad” ''Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary''. ninth ed. Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster 1985. ISBN 0-87779-508-8).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 3rd millennium BC, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and the [[Akkad]]ians, which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].&lt;ref name='Deutscher'&gt;{{cite book|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press US]]|year=2007|isbn=9780199532223|pages=20–21|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XFwUxmCdG94C}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate).&lt;ref name=&quot;woods&quot;&gt;[Woods C. 2006 “Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian”. In S.L. Sanders (ed) ''Margins of Writing, Origins of Culture'': 91-120 Chicago [http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/OIS2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Akkad reached its political peak between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC, following the conquests of king [[Sargon of Akkad]] (2334-2279 BC), often referred to as [[Sargon the Great]]. Under Sargon and his successors, Akkadian language was briefly imposed on neighboring conquered states such as [[Elam]]. Akkad is sometimes regarded as the first empire in history,&lt;ref&gt;Liverani, Mario, ''Akkad: The First World Empire'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; though there are earlier Sumerian claimants.

==City of Akkad==
The precise archaeological site of the city of Akkad has not yet been found. The form ''Agade'' appears in Sumerian, for example in the [[Sumerian King List]]; the later Assyro-Babylonian form ''Akkadû'' (&quot;of or belonging to Akkad&quot;) was likely derived from this. It is possible that the Sumerian name, despite its unetymological spelling  ''A.GA.DÈ'', is from ''AGA.DÈ'', meaning &quot;Crown of Fire&quot;&lt;ref name=crown&gt;J. D. Prince, &quot;Materials for a Sumerian Lexicon&quot;, pp. 23, 73, and '&quot;Note on Akkad&quot;, pp. 55-57, in ''Journal of Biblical Literature'', 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; in allusion to [[Ishtar]], &quot;the brilliant goddess&quot;, whose cult was observed from very early times in Agade. Centuries later, the neo-Babylonian king [[Nabonidus]] mentioned in his archaeological records&lt;ref name=nabonidus&gt;I. Rawl. 69, col. ii. 48 and iii. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Ishtar]]'s worship in Agade was later superseded by that of the goddess [[Anunit]], whose shrine was at [[Sippar]]—suggesting proximity of Sippar and Agade. Despite numerous searches, the city has never been found. One theory holds that Agade was situated opposite Sippar on the left bank of the Euphrates, and was perhaps the oldest part of the city of Sippar. Another theory is that the ruins of Akkad are to be found beneath modern [[Baghdad]]. Reputedly it was destroyed by invading [[Gutians]] with the fall of the Akkadian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Wall-Romana, An Areal Location of Agade, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, vol. 49, no. 3, pp. 205-245, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known mention of the city of Akkad is in an inscription of [[Enshakushanna]] of [[Uruk]], where he claims to have defeated Agade—indicating that it was in existence well before the days of Sargon of Akkad, who the Sumerian King List claims to have built it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=v4dNDEOke78C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=mieroop+cuneiform+%22yet+there+is+a+year%22&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=3rnKcTvDUKZMN49hzYMVSw5ouuU Cuneiform texts and the writing of history By Marc Van de Mieroop p. 75]&lt;/ref&gt; Akkad is mentioned once in the [[Tanakh]]—[[Book of Genesis]] 10:10: ''And the beginning of his Nimrod's kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar'' ([[KJV]]). The [[Greek language|Greek]] ([[LXX]]) spelling in this passage is ''Archad''.

==History==
===Origins===
[[Semitic languages|Semitic]] speakers of the [[Akkadian]] language seem to have already been present in Mesopotamia at the dawn of the historical period, and soon achieved preeminence with the first Dynasty of [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] and numerous localities to the north of Sumer, where rulers with Semitic Akkadian names had already established themselves by the 3rd millennium BC. Sargon has often been cited as the first ruler of a combined empire of Akkad and Sumer, although more recently discovered data suggests there had been Sumerian expansions under previous kings, including [[Lugal-Anne-Mundu]] of [[Adab]], [[Eannatum]] of [[Lagash]], and [[Lugal-Zage-Si]].

====Sargon and his sons====
[[Image:Sargon of Akkad.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Bronze head of an [[Akkad]]ian, ([[National Museum of Iraq]])]]
The fame of the early establishers of Semitic supremacy was far eclipsed by that of [[Sargon of Akkad]] (''Sharru-kin'' = &quot;legitimate king&quot;, possibly a title he took on gaining power; 24th century BC), who defeated and captured Lugal-Zage-Si in the [[Battle of Uruk]], conquering his empire. The earliest records in the Akkadian language date to the time of Sargon. Sargon was claimed to be the son of La'ibum or Itti-Bel, a humble gardener, and possibly a [[hierodule]], prostitute, or priestess to [[Ishtar]] or [[Inanna]].

One legend related of Sargon in Assyrian times says that
{{quote|&quot;My mother was a changeling (?), my father I knew not. The brothers of my father loved the hills. My city is Azurpiranu (the wilderness herb fields), which is situated on the banks of the Euphrates. My changeling mother conceived me, in secret she bore me. She set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid. She cast me into the river which rose not over me. The river bore me up and carried me to Akki, the drawer of water. Akki, the drawer of water, took me as his son and reared me. Akki the drawer of water, appointed me as his gardener. While I was gardener Ishtar granted me her love, and for four and (fifty?) ... years I exercised kingship.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roux, Georges (1982) &quot;Ancient Iraq&quot; (Penguin, Harmondsworth)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Originally a cupbearer (''Rabshaqe'') to a king of Kish with a Semitic name, [[Ur-Zababa]], Sargon thus became a gardener, responsible for the task of clearing out irrigation canals. This gave him access to a disciplined corps of workers, who also may have served as his first soldiers. Displacing Ur-Zababa, Sargon was crowned king, and he entered upon a career of foreign conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Noah Kramer, The Sumerians, Chicago University Press, 1971, ISBN 0-226-45238-7&lt;/ref&gt; Four times he invaded [[Syria]] and [[Canaan]], and he spent three years thoroughly subduing the countries of &quot;the west&quot; to unite them with Mesopotamia &quot;into a single empire.&quot;

However, Sargon took this process further, conquering many of the surrounding regions to create an empire that reached westward as far as the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and perhaps [[Cyprus]] (''Kaptara''); northward as far as the mountains (a later Hittite text asserts he fought the [[Hattians|Hatti]]te king Nurdaggal of [[Burushanda]], well into [[Anatolia]]); eastward over [[Elam]]; and as far south as [[Magan]] ([[Oman]]) &amp;mdash; a region over which he reigned for purportedly 56 years, though only four &quot;year-names&quot; survive.

Trade extended from the [[silver]] mines of Anatolia to the [[lapis lazuli]] mines in [[Afghanistan]], the [[Cedrus libani|cedars]] of [[Lebanon]] and the [[copper]] of Magan. This consolidation of the city-states of Sumer and Akkad reflected the growing economic and political power of Mesopotamia. The empire's breadbasket was the rain-fed agricultural system of northern Mesopotamia ([[Assyria]]) and a chain of fortresses was built to control the imperial wheat production.

Images of Sargon were erected on the shores of the Mediterranean, in token of his victories, and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands. [[Elam]] and the northern part of Mesopotamia ([[Assyria]]/[[Subartu]]) were also subjugated, and rebellions in [[Sumer]] were put down. Contract tablets have been found dated in the years of the campaigns against [[Canaan]] and against Sarlak, king of [[Gutian period|Gutium]]. He also boasted of having subjugated the &quot;four quarters&quot; &amp;mdash; the lands surrounding Akkad to the north (Assyria), the south (Sumer), the east (Elam) and the west ([[Amorites|Martu]]). Some of the earliest historiographic texts ([[Babylonian Chronicles|ABC 19, 20]]) suggest he rebuilt the city of Babylon (''Bab-ilu'') in its new location near Akkad.&lt;ref&gt;Dalley proposes that these sources may have originally referred to [[Sargon II]] of the [[Assyria]] rather than Sargon of Akkad. Stephanie Dalley, Babylon as a Name for Other Cities Including Nineveh, in [http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/saoc62.pdf] Proceedings of the 51st Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, Oriental Institute SAOC 62, pp. 25-33, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Sargon, throughout his long life, showed special deference to the Sumerian deities, particularly [[Inanna]], his patroness, and [[Zababa]], the warrior god of [[Kish]]. He called himself ''&quot;The anointed priest of [[Anu]]&quot;'' and ''&quot;the great'' '''ensi''' ''of Enlil&quot;'' and his daughter, [[Enheduanna]], was installed as priestess to [[Nanna (Sumerian deity)|Nanna]] at the temple in [[Ur]].

Troubles multiplied toward the end of his reign. A later Babylonian text states
{{quote|&quot;In his old age, all the lands revolted against him, and they besieged him in Akkad (the city)&quot;''…but ''&quot;he went forth to battle and defeated them, he knocked them over and destroyed their vast army&quot;.}}
Also shortly after,
{{quote|&quot;the Subartu (mountainous tribes of Assyria) the upper country—in their turn attacked, but they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled their habitations, and he smote them grievously&quot;.}}

These difficulties broke out again in the reign of his sons. Revolts broke out during the 9-year reign of his son, [[Rimush (Akkad)|Rimush]] (2278-2270 BC), who fought hard to retain the empire—and in the fifteen year reign of Rimush's elder brother, [[Manishtushu]] (2269-2255 BC). The latter king seems to have fought a sea battle against 32 kings who had gathered against him. Both appear to have been assassinated.

Manishtushu's son and successor, [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]] (2254-2218 BC) (Beloved of [[Suen|Sin]]), assumed the imperial title &quot;King Naram-Sin, king of the four quarters (''Lugal Naram-Sîn, Šar kibrat 'arbaim'')&quot;, and, like his grandfather, was addressed as &quot;the god (Sumerian = DINGIR, Akkadian = ''ilu'') of Agade&quot; (Akkad).

Naram-Sin also recorded the Akkadian conquest of [[Ebla]] as well as Armanum and its king.&lt;ref&gt;Archeological Perspectives on the Localization of Naram-Sin's Armanum, Adelheid Otto, Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 58,  (2006), pp. 1-26&lt;/ref&gt; Armanum was located on the Euphrates River between Ebla and [[Nagar, Syria|Tell Brak]], most likely at the Citadel of Bazi - Tall Banat complex.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin R.

Naram-Sin campaigned against Magan which also revolted; Naram-Sin, ''&quot;marched against [[Magan]] and personally caught Mandannu, its king&quot;''. The chief threat seemed to be coming from the northeastern mountaineers. A campaign against the [[Lullubi]] led to the carving of the famous &quot;Victory Stele of Naram-Suen&quot;, now in the [[Louvre]]. [[Hittite]] sources claim Naram-Sin of Akkad even ventured into [[Anatolia]], battling the Hittite and [[Hurrian]] kings [[Pamba (king)|Pamba]] of [[Hattians|Hatti]], Zipani of [[Kanesh]], and 15 others.

This newfound Akkadian wealth may have been based upon benign climatic conditions, huge agricultural surpluses and the confiscation of the wealth of other peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;William J. Burroughs 2008&quot;&gt;William J. Burroughs, Climate Change in Prehistory: The end of the age of chaos, Cambridge University Press, 2008, ISBN 0-521-07010-4&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Naram-Sin inscription AO6782 stitched.jpg|thumb|left|Inscription of Naram Sin found at the city of [[Marad]] in [[Iraq]]. c. 2260 [[Before Present|BP]].]]
The economy was highly planned. Grain was cleaned, and rations of grain and oil were distributed in standardized vessels made by the city's potters. Taxes were paid in produce and labour on public walls, including city walls, temples, irrigation canals and waterways, producing huge agricultural surpluses.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, Brian (2004) &quot;The Long Summer: how climate changed civilisation&quot; (Granta Books){{Page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later Assyrian and Babylonian texts, the name ''Akkad'', together with ''Sumer'', appears as part of the royal title, as in the Sumerian [[LUGAL]] KI.EN.GIR&lt;sup&gt;KI&lt;/sup&gt; URU&lt;sup&gt;KI&lt;/sup&gt; or Akkadian ''Šar māt Šumeri u Akkadi'',&lt;ref name=title&gt;De Mieroop, Marc Van. (2005). ''A History of the Ancient Near East ca. 3000-323BC'', Malden: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; translating to &quot;king of Sumer and Akkad&quot;. This title was assumed by the king who seized control of [[Nippur]],&lt;ref name=title /&gt; the intellectual and religious center of southern Mesopotamia.

During the Akkadian period, the Akkadian language became the [[lingua franca]] of the Middle East, and was officially used for administration, although the Sumerian language remained as a spoken and literary language. The spread of Akkadian stretched from Syria to Elam, and even the [[Elamite language]] was temporarily written in Mesopotamian [[cuneiform]]. Akkadian texts later found their way to far-off places, from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] (in the [[Amarna Period]]) and [[Anatolia]], to [[Persia]] ([[Behistun]]).

===Collapse of the Akkadian Empire===
The Empire of Akkad collapsed in 2154 BC, within 180 years of its founding, ushering in a period of regional decline that lasted until the rise of the [[Sumerian]] [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] in 2112 BC. By the end of the reign of Naram-Sin's son, [[Shar-kali-sharri]] (2217-2193 BC), the empire had weakened. There was a period of anarchy between 2192 BC and 2168 BC. [[Shu-Durul]] (2168-2154 BC) appears to have restored some order, however he was unable to prevent the empire eventually collapsing outright from the invasion of barbarian peoples from the [[Zagros Mountains]] known as the [[Gutian period|Gutians]].

Little is known about the Gutian period, or how long it endured. Cuneiform sources suggest that the Gutians' administration showed little concern for maintaining agriculture, written records, or public safety; they reputedly released all farm animals to roam about Mesopotamia freely, and soon brought about famine and rocketing grain prices. The Sumerian king [[Ur-Nammu]] (2112-2095 BC) cleared the Gutians from Mesopotamia during his reign.

It has recently been suggested that the regional decline at the end of the Akkadian period (and [[First Intermediary Period]] of the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Old Kingdom]]) was associated with rapidly increasing aridity, and failing rainfall in the region of the Ancient Near East, caused by a [[4.2 kiloyear event|global centennial-scale drought]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Richard A. Kerr | year = 1998 | title = Sea-Floor Dust Shows Drought Felled Akkadian Empire | journal = Science | volume = 279 | issue = 5349 | pages = 325–326 | doi = 10.1126/science.279.5349.325 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unreportedheritagenews.com/2011/02/how-did-they-survive-new-research-shows.html How did they survive? New research shows Jordanian city survived climate change disaster 4,200 years ago]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sumerian King List, describing the Akkadian Empire after the death of Shar-kali-shari, states:
{{quote|&quot;Who was king?  Who was not king?  Irgigi the king; Nanum, the king; Imi the king; Ilulu, the king—the four of them were kings but reigned only three years. Dudu reigned 21 years; Shu-Turul, the son of Dudu, reigned 15 years. … Agade was defeated and its kingship carried off to Uruk. In Uruk, Ur-ningin reigned 7 years, Ur-gigir, son of Ur-ningin, reigned 6 years; Kuda reigned 6 years; Puzur-ili reigned 5 years, Ur-Utu reigned 6 years. Uruk was smitten with weapons and its kingship carried off by the Gutian hordes.}}
However, there are no known year-names or other archaeological evidence verifying any of these later kings of Akkad or Uruk, apart from a single artifact referencing king [[Dudu of Akkad]]. The named kings of Uruk may have been contemporaries of the last kings of Akkad, but in any event could not have been very prominent.

{{quote|In the Gutian hordes, (first reigned) a nameless king; (then) Imta reigned 3 years as king; Shulme reigned 6 years; Elulumesh reigned 6 years; Inimbakesh reigned 5 years; Igeshuash reigned 6 years; Iarlagab reigned 15 years; Ibate reigned 3 years; … reigned 3 years; Kurum reigned 1 year; … reigned 3 years; … reigned 2 years; Iararum reigned 2 years; Ibranum reigned 1 year; Hablum reigned 2 years; Puzur-Sin son of Hablum reigned 7 years; Iarlaganda reigned 7 years; … reigned 7 years; … reigned 40 days. Total 21 kings reigned 91 years, 40 days.}}
Evidence from [[Tell Leilan]] in Northern Mesopotamia shows what may have happened. The site was abandoned soon after the city's massive walls were constructed, its temple rebuilt and its grain production reorganised. The debris, dust and sand that followed show no trace of human activity. Soil samples show fine wind-blown sand, no trace of earthworm activity, reduced rainfall and indications of a drier and windier climate. Evidence shows that skeleton-thin sheep and cattle died of drought, and up to 28,000 people abandoned the site, seeking wetter areas elsewhere. Tell Brak shrank in size by 75%. Trade collapsed. [[Nomad]]ic herders such as the [[Amorite]]s moved herds closer to reliable water suppliers, bringing them into conflict with native Akkadian farmers. This climate-induced collapse seems to have affected the whole of the Middle East, and to have coincided with the collapse of the [[Egyptian]] Old Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Weiss, et al., The genesis and collapse of Third Millennium north Mesopotamian Civilization, Science, vol. 291, pp. 995-1088, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

This collapse of rain-fed agriculture in the Upper Country meant the loss to southern Mesopotamia of the agrarian subsidies which had kept the Akkadian Empire solvent.  Water levels within the Tigris and Euphrates fell 1.5 metres beneath the level of 2600 BC, and although they stabilised for a time during the following Ur III period, rivalries between pastoralists and farmers increased. Attempts were undertaken to prevent the former from herding their flocks in agricultural lands, such as the building of a {{convert|180|km|0|abbr=on}} wall known as the &quot;Repeller of the Amorites&quot; between the Tigris and Euphrates under the Ur III ruler [[Shu-Suen|Shu-Sin]]. Such attempts led to increased political instability; meanwhile, severe depopulation occurred to re-establish [[Demography|demographic equilibrium]] with the less favorable climatic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Christie, Peter (2008) &quot;The Curse of Akkad: Climate Upheavals that Rocked Human History&quot; (Paperback)(Annick Press)pp31-48&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been recently suggested that the rapid climatic collapse, marking the ''Akkadian Dark Age'', may have been responsible for the religiously prescribed prohibition against the raising and consumption of [[pig]]s that spread through the Ancient Middle East from the end of the third millennium BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;William J. Burroughs 2008&quot;/&gt;

The period between ca. 2112 BC and 2004 BC is known as the [[Third dynasty of Ur|Ur III period]]. Documents again began to be written in [[Sumerian]], although Sumerian was becoming a purely literary or liturgical language, much as Latin later would be in [[Medieval]] [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Roux, Georges (1996), &quot;Ancient Iraq&quot; (3rd Edition)(Penguin Harmondsworth)&lt;/ref&gt; 

===The Curse===
Later material described how the fall of Akkad was due to Naram-Sin's attack upon the city of Nippur. When prompted by a pair of inauspicious [[oracle]]s, the king sacked the [[E (temple)|E]]-kur temple, supposedly protected by the god [[Enlil]], head of the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. As a result of this, eight chief deities of the [[Anunnaki]] pantheon were supposed to have come together and withdrawn their support from Akkad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.2.1.5 Full translation in Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:For the first time since cities were built and founded,
:The great agricultural tracts produced no grain,
:The inundated tracts produced no fish,
:The irrigated orchards produced neither wine nor syrup,
:The gathered clouds did not rain, the masgurum did not grow.
:At that time, one shekel's worth of oil was only one-half quart,
:One shekel's worth of grain was only one-half quart. . . .
:These sold at such prices in the markets of all the cities!
:He who slept on the roof, died on the roof,
:He who slept in the house, had no burial,
:People were flailing at themselves from hunger.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For many years, the events described in &quot;The Curse of Akkad&quot; were thought, like the details of Sargon's birth, to be purely fictional. But now the evidence of [[Tell Leilan]], and recent findings of elevated dust deposits in sea-cores collected off Oman, that date to the period of Akkad's collapse suggest that [[climate change]] may have played a role.&lt;ref&gt;What drives societal collapse?

==Government==
The Akkadian government formed a &quot;classical standard&quot; with which all future Mesopotamian states compared themselves. Traditionally, the ''ensi'' was the highest functionary of the Sumerian [[city-state]]s. In later traditions, one became an ''ensi'' by marrying the goddess Inanna, legitimising the rulership through divine consent.

Initially, the monarchical ''lugal'' (''lu'' = man, ''gal'' = great) was subordinate to the priestly ''ensi'', and was appointed at times of troubles, but by later dynastic times, it was the ''lugal'' who had emerged as the preeminent role, having his own ''&quot;é&quot;'' (= house) or &quot;palace&quot;, independent from the temple establishment. By the time of [[Mesalim]], whichever dynasty controlled the city of Kish was recognised as ''šar kiššati'' (= king of Kish), and was considered preeminent in Sumer, possibly because this was where the two rivers approached, and whoever controlled Kish ultimately controlled the irrigation systems of the other cities downstream.

As Sargon extended his conquest from the &quot;Lower Sea&quot; (Persian Gulf), to the &quot;Upper Sea&quot; (Mediterranean), it was felt that he ruled &quot;the totality of the lands under heaven&quot;, or &quot;from sunrise to sunset&quot;, as contemporary texts put it. Under Sargon, the ''ensi''s generally retained their positions, but were seen more as provincial governors. The title ''šar kiššati'' became recognised as meaning &quot;lord of the universe&quot;. Sargon is even recorded as having organised naval expeditions to [[Dilmun]] ([[Bahrein]]) and Magan, amongst the first organised military naval expeditions in history.  Whether he also did in the case of the Mediterranean with the kingdom of [[Keftiu|Kaptara]] (possibly [[Cyprus]]), as claimed in later documents, is more questionable.

With [[Naram-Sin]], Sargon's grandson, this went further than with Sargon, with the king not only being called &quot;Lord of the Four Quarters (of the Earth)&quot;, but also elevated to the ranks of the ''dingir'' (= gods), with his own temple establishment. Previously a ruler could, like [[Gilgamesh]], become divine after death but the Akkadian kings, from Naram-Sin onward, were considered gods on earth in their lifetimes. Their portraits showed them of larger size than mere mortals and at some distance from their retainers.&lt;ref&gt;Leick, Gwendolyn (2001) &quot;Mesopotamia: Invention of the City&quot; (Penguin Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

One strategy adopted by both Sargon and Naram-Sin, to maintain control of the country, was to install their daughters, [[Enheduanna]] and Enmenanna respectively, as high priestess to Sin, the Akkadian version of the Sumerian moon deity, Nanna, at [[Ur]], in the extreme south of Sumer; to install sons as provincial ''ensi'' governors in strategic locations; and to marry their daughters to rulers of peripheral parts of the Empire ([[Urkesh]] and Marhashe). A well documented case of the latter is that of Naram-Sin's daughter Tar'am-Agade at Urkesh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://128.97.6.202/attach/Buccellati%202002%20Taram%20Agade%20Daughter%20of%20Naram%20Sin.pdf] Tar'am-Agade, Daughter of Naram-Sin, at Urkesh, Buccellati, Giorgio and Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati, in Of Pots and Plans. Papers on the Archaeology and History of Mesopotamia and Syria presented to David Oates in Honour of his 75th Birthday, London: Nabu Publications, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
The population of Akkad, like all pre-modern states, was entirely dependent upon the agricultural systems of the region, which seem to have had two principal centres: the irrigated farmlands of southern Iraq that traditionally had a yield of 30 grains returned for each grain sown and the rain-fed agriculture of northern Iraq, known as ''&quot;the Upper Country&quot;''.

Southern Iraq during Akkadian period seems to have been approaching its modern rainfall level of less than {{convert|20|mm|0|abbr=on}} per year, with the result that agriculture was totally dependent upon irrigation. Prior to the Akkadian period the progressive [[salinity|salinisation]] of the soils, produced by poorly drained irrigation, had been reducing yields of [[wheat]] in the southern part of the country, leading to the conversion to more salt-tolerant [[barley]] growing. Urban populations there had peaked already by 2,600 BC, and ecological pressures were high, contributing to the rise of militarism apparent immediately prior to the Akkadian period (as seen in the [[Stele of the Vultures]] of [[Eannatum]]).  Warfare between city states had led to a population decline, from which Akkad provided a temporary respite.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, William J. (2003), &quot;Complexity, Diminishing Marginal Returns and Serial Mesopotamian Fragmentation&quot; (in Journal of World Systems Research)&lt;/ref&gt; It was this high degree of agricultural productivity in the south that enabled the growth of the highest population densities in the world at this time, giving Akkad its military advantage.

The [[water table]] in this region was very high, and replenished regularly—by winter storms in the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates from October to March, and from snow-melt from March to July. Flood levels, that had been stable from about 3,000 to 2,600 BC, had started falling, and by the Akkadian period were a half-meter to a meter lower than recorded previously.  Even so, the flat country and weather uncertainties made flooding much more unpredictable than in the case of the Nile; serious deluges seem to have been a regular occurrence, requiring constant maintenance of irrigation ditches and drainage systems. Farmers were recruited into regiments for this work from August to October—a period of food shortage—under the control of city temple authorities, thus acting as a form of unemployment relief. Some{{Who|date=April 2008}} have suggested that this was Sargon's original employment for the king of Kish, giving him experience in effectively organising large groups of men; a tablet reads, ''&quot;Sargon, the king, to whom Enlil permitted no rival—5,400 warriors ate bread daily before him&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 1963:324, quoted in Charles Keith Maisels, ''The Emergence of Civilization'' ch. &quot;The institutions of urbanism&quot;, 1990:179.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Murex Rimush Louvre AO21404.jpg|300 px| thumb|left|Sea shell of a [[murex]] bearing the name of [[Rimush]], king of Kish, ca. 2270 BC, [[Louvre]], traded from the Mediterranean coast where it was used by [[Canaanites]] to make a purple dye.]]
Harvest was in the late spring and during the dry summer months. Nomadic Amorites from the northwest would pasture their flocks of sheep and goats to graze on the stubble and be watered from the river and irrigation canals. For this privilege, they would have to pay a tax in wool, meat, milk, and cheese to the temples, who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood. In good years, all would go well, but in bad years, wild winter pastures would be in short supply, nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields, and conflicts with farmers would result. It would appear that the subsidizing of southern populations by the import of wheat from the north of the Empire temporarily overcame this problem,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} and it seems to have allowed economic recovery and a growing population within this region.

As a result, Sumer and Akkad had a surplus of agricultural products, but was short of almost everything else, particularly metal ores, timber and building stone, all of which had to be imported. The spread of the Akkadian state as far as the &quot;silver mountain&quot; (possibly the [[Taurus Mountains]]), the &quot;cedars&quot; of Lebanon, and the copper deposits of Magan, was largely motivated by the goal of securing control over these imports. One tablet reads ''&quot;Sargon, the king of Kish, triumphed in thirty-four battles (over the cities) up to the edge of the sea (and) destroyed their walls. He made the ships from Meluhha, the ships from Magan (and) the ships from Dilmun tie up alongside the quay of Agade. Sargon the king prostrated himself before (the god) Dagan (and) made supplication to him; (and) he (Dagan) gave him the upper land, namely Mari, Yarmuti, (and) Ebla, up to the Cedar Forest (and) up to the Silver Mountain&quot;.''

===Poet - priestess Enheduanna===
Sumerian literature continued in rich development during the Akkadian period (a notable example being [[Enheduanna]]). Enheduanna, the &quot;wife (Sumerian ''&quot;dam&quot;'' = high priestess) of [[Nanna (Norse deity)|Nanna]] [the Sumerian moon god] and daughter of Sargon&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Winter, Irene J. (1987), &quot;Women in Public: The Disk of Enheduanna, The Beginning of the Office of En-Priestess, the Weight of the Visual Evidence.&quot; La Femme dans le Proche-Orient Antique. (Paris: Editions Recherche sur les Civilisations)&lt;/ref&gt; of the temple of Sin at Ur, who lived ca. 2285-2250 BC, is the first poet in history whom we know by name. Her known works include hymns to the goddess Inanna, the ''Exaltation of Inanna'' and ''In-nin sa-gur-ra''. A third work, the ''Temple Hymns'', a collection of specific hymns, addresses the sacred temples and their occupants, the deity to whom they were consecrated. The works of this poetess are significant, because although they start out using the third person, they shift to the first person voice of the poet herself, and they mark a significant development in the use of cuneiform. As poetess, princess, and priestess, she was a personality who, according to William W Hallo, &quot;set standards in all three of her roles for many succeeding centuries&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Enheduanna, &quot;The Exaltation of Inanna.&quot; Translated by William W. Hallo and J.J.A. Van Dijk,
Ams Pr Inc, 1979, ISBN 0-404-60263-0&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Exultation of Inanna'',
:&quot;Enheduanna depicts Inanna as disciplining mankind as a goddess of battle. She thereby unites the warlike Akkadian Ishtar's qualities to those of the gentler Sumerian goddess of love and fecundity. She likens Inanna to a great storm bird who swoops down on the lesser gods and sends them fluttering off like surprised bats. Then, in probably the most interesting part of the hymn, Enheduanna herself steps forward in the first person to recite her own past glories, establishing her credibility, and explaining her present plight. She has been banished as high priestess from the temple in the city of Ur and from Uruk and exiled to the steppe. She begs the moon god Nanna to intercede for her because the city of Uruk, under the ruler Lugalanne, has rebelled against Sargon. The rebel, Lugalanne, has even destroyed the temple Eanna, one of the greatest temples in the ancient world. Further, he has dared to equate himself as an equal to the new high priestess and--in the most ancient recorded instant of sexual harassment--made sexual advances to the high priestess, his sister-in-law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Binkley, Roberta, &quot;The Importance of Enheduanna&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
One tablet from this period reads, ''&quot;(From the earliest days) no-one had made a statue of lead, (but) Rimush king of Kish, had a statue of himself made of lead. It stood before Enlil; and it recited his (Rimush's) virtues to the idu of the gods&quot;''. Akkadian artists also discovered the ''&quot;[[lost wax]]&quot;'' method of [[bronze casting]], previously believed to have been discovered much later, at the time of [[classical Greece]].

===Achievements===
The empire was bound together by roads, along which there was a regular [[mail|postal service]]. Clay seals that took the place of stamps bear the names of Sargon and his son. A [[cadastral]] survey seems also to have been instituted, and one of the documents relating to it states that a certain Uru-Malik, whose name appears to indicate his Canaanite origin, was governor of the land of the Amorites, or ''Amurru'' as the semi-nomadic people of Syria and Canaan were called in Akkadian. It is probable that the first collection of [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations and terrestrial omens was made for a library established by Sargon. The earliest &quot;year names&quot;, whereby each year of a king's reign was named after a significant event performed by that king, date from the reign of Sargon the Great.  Lists of these &quot;year names&quot; henceforth became a calendrical system used in most independent Mesopotamian city-states. In Assyria, however, years came to be named for the annual presiding ''[[limmu]]'' official appointed by the king, rather than for an event.

'''Ajax''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|Αἴας}}) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Greek mythology|mythological]] hero, son of [[Oileus]], the king of [[Locris]].  He was called the &quot;lesser&quot; or &quot;Locrian&quot; Ajax,&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' ii. 527&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish him from [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax the Great]], son of [[Telamon]]. He was the leader of the [[Locrians|Locrian]] contingent during the [[Trojan War]].  He is a significant figure in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and is also mentioned in the ''[[Odyssey]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard  | author-link =   | contribution = Ajax (2)  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 87–88  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0096.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. In [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan legend]], he was known as ''Aivas Vilates''.
==Mythology==
His mother's name was [[Eriopis]].  According to [[Strabo]], he was born in Naryx in [[Locris]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ix. p. 425&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Ovid]] calls him ''Narycius Heros''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' xiv. 468&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''[[Iliad]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' ii. 527, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt; he led his [[Locrians]] in forty ships against Troy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 97 gives the number of ships as twenty&lt;/ref&gt;  He is described as one of the great heroes among the Greeks. When the grammatical dual form of Ajax is used in the ''[[Iliad]]'', it was once believed that it indicated the lesser Ajax fighting side-by-side with Telamonian [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]], but now it is generally thought that that usage refers to the Greater Ajax and his brother [[Teucer]]. In battle, he wore a [[linen]] [[cuirass]] ({{polytonic|λιμνοθώρηξ}}), was brave and intrepid, especially skilled in throwing the spear and, next to [[Achilles]], the swiftest of all the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' xiv. 520, &amp;c., xxiii. 789, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the funeral games at the [[pyre]] of [[Patroclus]], he contended with [[Odysseus]] and [[Antilochus]] for the prize in the footrace; but [[Athena]], who was hostile towards him and favored Odysseus, made him stumble and fall, so that he won only the second prize&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' (xxiii. 754, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;. On his return from Troy, his vessel was wrecked on the Whirling Rocks ({{polytonic|Γυραὶ πέτραι}}), but he himself escaped upon a rock through the assistance of [[Poseidon]] and would have been saved in spite of Athena, but he said that he would escape the dangers of the sea in defiance of the immortals. In punishment for this presumption, Poseidon split the rock with his [[trident]] and Ajax was swallowed up by the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' iv. 499, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later traditions, this Ajax is called a son of Oileus and the [[nymph]] Rhene and is also mentioned among the suitors of Helen.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 81, 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollodorus]], iii. 10. § 8&lt;/ref&gt;  After the taking of Troy, it is said he rushed into the temple of Athena, where [[Cassandra]] had taken refuge, and was embracing the statue of the goddess as a [[supplicant]].  Ajax violently dragged her away to the other captives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' ii. 403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''Troad.'' 70, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dict. Cret.'' v. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 116&lt;/ref&gt;  According to some writers, he even raped Cassandra inside the temple.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tryphiodorus]], 635&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], xiii. 422&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lycophron]], 360, with the [[Scholion]]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Odysseus]], at least, accused him of this crime and Ajax was to be stoned to death, but saved himself by establishing his innocence with an oath.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' x. 26. § 1, 31. § 1&lt;/ref&gt;  The whole charge was sometimes said to have been an invention of [[Agamemnon]], who wanted to have Cassandra for himself.

==Death==
Whether true or not, Athena still had cause to be indignant, as Ajax had dragged a supplicant from her temple.  According to [[Apollodorus]], no one had realised that Ajax had raped Cassandra until [[Calchas]], the Greek seer, warns the Greeks that [[Athena]] is furious at the treatment of her priestess and she will destroy the Greek ships if they don't kill him. Despite this, Ajax manages to hide in the altar of an unnamed deity where the Greeks, fearing divine retribution should they kill him and destroy the altar, allow him to live. When the Greeks leave without killing Ajax, despite their sacrifices [[Athena]] is so angry that she persuades [[Zeus]] to send a storm that sinks many of their ships. When Ajax finally leaves [[Troy]], [[Athena]] hits his ship with a thunderbolt, but Ajax still survives, managing to cling onto a rock. He boasts that even the gods cannot kill him and [[Poseidon]], on hearing this, splits the rock with his trident, causing Ajax to eventually drown. [[Thetis]] buries him when the corpse washes up on Myconos.&lt;ref&gt;Apollodore, R. Scott Smith, Stephen Trzaskoma, and Hygin. Apollodorus' Library and Hyginus' Fabulae: Two Handbooks of Greek Mythology. Indianapolis: Hackett Pub., 2007. 84-85. &quot;5.24-6.6.&quot; Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions depict a different death for Ajax, showing him to die when on his voyage home. In these versions, when Ajax comes to the Capharean Rocks on the coast of [[Euboea]], his ship was wrecked in a fierce storm, he himself was lifted up in a whirlwind and impaled with a flash of rapid fire from Athena in his chest, and his body thrust upon sharp rocks, which afterwards were called the rocks of Ajax.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;comp. [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 40, &amp;c., xi. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death his spirit dwelled in the island of [[Leuce (island)|Leuce]].&lt;ref name=&quot;paus319&quot;&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' iii. 19. § 11&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Opuntian Locris|Opuntian]] Locrians worshiped Ajax as their national hero, and so great was their faith in him that when they drew up their army in battle, they always left one place open for him, believing that, although invisible to them, he was fighting for and among them.&lt;ref name=&quot;paus319&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Conon (mythographer)|Conon]] ''Narrations'' 18&lt;/ref&gt;  The story of Ajax was frequently made use of by ancient poets and artists, and the hero who appears on some Locrian coins with the helmet, shield, and sword is probably this Ajax.&lt;ref&gt;Théodore Edme Mionnet, No. 570, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other accounts of his death are offered by [[Philostratus III|Philostratus]] and the [[scholiast]] on [[Lycophron]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]], ''Her.'' viii. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]] on [[Lycophron]] ''l. c.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
The abduction of Cassandra by Ajax was frequently represented in [[Art in ancient Greece|Greek]] works of art, for instance on the chest of [[Cypselus]] described by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] and in extant works.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' v. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ajax''' or '''Aias''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|dʒ|æ|k|s|}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|ə|s|}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{polytonic|''Αἴας'', gen. Αἴαντος}}) was a [[Greek mythology|mythological Greek hero]], the son of [[Telamon]] and [[Periboea]] and king of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salamina.gr/english/index.htm &quot;Salamis The Island&quot;] ''Salamis The Island -- Salamina Municipality - Greek Island''&lt;/ref&gt; He plays an important role in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and in the [[Epic Cycle]], a series of [[epic poems]] about the [[Trojan War]]. To distinguish him from Ajax, son of Oileus ([[Ajax the Lesser]]), he is called &quot;'''Telamonian Ajax''',&quot; &quot;'''Greater Ajax''',&quot; or &quot;'''Ajax the Great'''&quot;.  In [[Etruscan mythology]], he is known as '''Aivas Tlamunus'''.

== Family ==
Ajax is the son of [[Telamon]], who was the son of [[Aeacus]] and grandson of [[Zeus]], and his first wife [[Periboea]]. He is the cousin of [[Achilles]], the most remembered Greek warrior, and is the elder [[Sibling|half-brother]] of [[Teucer]]. Many illustrious [[Athenians]], including [[Cimon]], [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]], [[Alcibiades]] and the historian [[Thucydides]], traced their descent from Ajax.
The Italian Scholar Maggiani recently showed as on an Etruscan tomb, dedicated to Racvi Satlnei in Bologna (5th century BC), there is the writing: &quot;aivastelmunsl = family of Ajax Télamon&quot;.

==Description==
In Homer's ''Iliad'' he is described as of great stature, colossal frame, the tallest and strongest of all the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]], second only to [[Achilles]] in skill-at-arms, and [[Diomedes]], to whom he lost a [[sparring]] competition. Known as the 'bulwark of the Mycenaeans', he was trained by the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]] (who had 
trained his father, [[Telamon]], and Achilles' father [[Peleus]]), at the same time as Achilles.

Apart from Achilles, Ajax is the most valuable warrior in [[Agamemnon]]'s army (along with [[Diomedes]]), though he is not as cunning as [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]], [[Diomedes]], [[Idomeneus]], or  [[Odysseus]]. He commands his army wielding a huge shield made of seven cow-hides with a layer of bronze. Most notably, Ajax is not wounded in any of the battles described in the ''Iliad'', and he is the only principal character on either side who does not receive personal assistance from any of the gods who take part in the battles.

==Trojan War==
In the ''Iliad'', Ajax is notable for his abundant strength and courage, seen particularly in two fights with [[Hector]]. In Book 7, Ajax is chosen by lot to meet Hector in a duel which lasts most of a whole day. Ajax at first gets the better of the encounter, wounding Hector with his spear and knocking him down with a large stone, but Hector fights on until the [[herald]]s, acting at the direction of [[Zeus]], call a draw: the action ends without a winner and with the two combatants exchanging gifts, Ajax giving Hector a purple sash and Hector giving Ajax a sharp sword. 

The second fight between Ajax and Hector occurs when the latter breaks into the Mycenaean camp, and fights with the Greeks among the ships. In Book 14, Ajax throws a giant rock at Hector which almost kills him. In Book 15, Hector is restored to his strength by [[Apollo]] and returns to attack the ships, Ajax, wielding an enormous spear as a weapon and leaping from ship to ship, holds off the [[Troy|Trojan]] armies virtually single-handedly. In Book 16, Hector and Ajax duel once again.  Hector is set on burning the ships, the only way he feels the Greeks will truly be defeated. Hector is able to disarm Ajax (although Ajax is not hurt) and Ajax is forced to retreat, seeing that Zeus is clearly favoring Hector. Hector and the Trojans succeed in burning one Greek ship, the culmination of an assault that almost finishes the war. Ajax is responsible for the death of many Trojans lords, including [[Phorcys (Trojan War)|Phorcys]]. 

Ajax often fought in tandem with his brother Teucer, known for his skill with the bow.  Ajax would wield his magnificent shield, as Teucer stood behind picking off enemy Trojans.  

Achilles was absent during these encounters because of his feud with Agamemnon. In Book 9, Agamemnon and the other Mycenaean chiefs send Ajax, Odysseus and [[Phoenix (Iliad)|Phoenix]] to the tent of Achilles in an attempt to reconcile with the great warrior and induce him to return to the fight. Although Ajax speaks earnestly and is well received, he does not succeed in convincing Achilles.

When [[Patroclus]] is killed, Hector tries to steal his body. Ajax, assisted by [[Menelaus]], succeeds in fighting off the Trojans and taking the body back with his chariot; however, the Trojans had already stripped Patroclus of Achilles' armor. Ajax's prayer to Zeus to remove the fog that has descended on the battle to allow them to fight or die in the light of day has become proverbial.  According to [[Hyginus]], In total, Ajax killed 28 people at Troy.&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''[[Fabulae]]'' [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae3.html 114].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===

[[File:Ajax (Carstens).jpg|thumb|Sorrowful Ajax (Asmus Jacob Carstens, ca. 1791)]]

Like most of the other Greek leaders, Ajax is alive and well as the ''Iliad'' comes to a close. Later, when Achilles dies, killed by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] (with help from Apollo), Ajax and Odysseus are the heroes that fight against the Trojans to get the body and bury it next to his friend, Patroclus. Ajax, with his great shield and spear, manages to drive off the Trojans, while Odysseus pulls the body to his chariot, and rides away with it to safety. After the burial, both claim the armor for themselves, as recognition for their efforts. After several days of competition, Odysseus and Ajax are tied for the ownership of the magical armor which was forged in [[Mount Olympus]] by the god [[Hephaestus]]. It is then that a competition is held to determine who deserves the armor.  Ajax argues that because of his strength and the fighting he has done for the Greeks, including saving the ships from Hector, and driving him off with a massive rock, he deserves the armor.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'', translated by Rolfe Humphries (Indianapolis: Indiana University, 1955), Book XIII, pp. 305-309)&lt;/ref&gt;  Odysseus proves the more eloquent, and the council gives him the armor. Ajax, &quot;Unconquered,&quot; and furious, falls upon his own sword, &quot;conquered by his [own] sorrow&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Metamorphoses'', trans. Humphries, p.&amp;nbsp;318&lt;/ref&gt;  

In Sophocles' play ''[[Ajax (Sophocles)|Ajax]],'' a famous retelling of Ajax's demise takes place - after the armor is awarded to Odysseus the hero Ajax falls to the ground, exhausted. When he wakes up, he is under the influence of a spell from Athena.  He goes to a flock of sheep and slaughters them, imagining they are the Achaean leaders, including Odysseus and Agamemnon. When he comes to his senses, covered in blood, and realizes what he has done, with diminished honor he decides that he prefers to kill himself rather than to live in shame. He does so with the same sword Hector gave him when they exchanged presents.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Iliad]],'' 7.303&lt;/ref&gt; From his blood sprang a red flower, as at the death of [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinthus]], which bore on its leaves the initial letters of his name ''Ai,'' also expressive of lament.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 1.35.4&lt;/ref&gt; His ashes were deposited in a golden urn on the [[Rhoiteion#The Tomb of Ajax|Rhoetean]] promontory at the entrance of the [[Hellespont]].

[[File:Ajax suicide BM F480.jpg|thumb|left|The suicide of Ajax]]

In [[Pindar]]'s ''Nemeans'', 7, 8; ''Isthmian 4''; and in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'', 13.1. Homer is somewhat vague about the precise manner of Ajax's death but does ascribe it to his loss in the dispute over Achilles's shield: when Odysseus visits [[Hades]], he begs the soul of Ajax to speak to him, but Ajax, still resentful over the old quarrel, refuses and descends silently back into [[Erebus]].

Like Achilles, he is represented (although not by Homer) as living after his death in the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|island of Leuke]] at the mouth of the [[Danube]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 3.19.11&lt;/ref&gt; Ajax, who in the post-Homeric legend is described as the grandson of [[Aeacus]] and the great-grandson of Zeus, was the [[tutelary deity|tutelary hero]] of the island of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], where he had a temple and an image, and where a festival called ''Aianteia'' was celebrated in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias 1.35&lt;/ref&gt; At this festival a couch was set up, on which the [[panoply]] of the hero was placed, a practice which recalls the Roman [[Lectisternium]]. The identification of Ajax with the family of Aeacus was chiefly a matter which concerned the [[Athenian]]s, after Salamis had come into their possession, on which occasion [[Solon]] is said to have inserted a line in the ''[[Iliad]]'' (2.557-558), for the purpose of supporting the Athenian claim to the island. Ajax then became an [[Attica|Attic]] hero; he was worshipped at [[Athens]], where he had a statue in the market-place, and the tribe ''Aiantis'' was named after him. Pausanias also relates that a gigantic skeleton, its kneecap {{convert|5|in|cm}} in diameter, appeared on the beach near [[Sigeion]], on the Trojan coast; these bones were identified as those of Ajax.

==Palace==
In 2001, Yannos Lolos began excavating a [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] palace on the island of Salamis which he supposed to be the home of the mythological Aiacid dynasty.  The ruins have been excavated at a site near the village of Kanakia of Salamis, a few miles off the coast of Athens. The multi-story structure covers 750 m² (8,000 [[Square foot|sq ft]]) and had perhaps 30 rooms. The Trojan War is supposed by many {{Who|April 2009|date=April 2009}} to have occurred at the height of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] civilization (see discussion of [[Troy VII]]), roughly the point at which this palace appears to have been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2106548,00.html | location=London | work=The Times | title=Palace of Homers hero rises out of the myths | first=John | last=Carr | date=2006-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alaric I''' (''Alareiks'' in the original [[Gothic language|Gothic]]) was likely born about 370 on an [[Peuce Island|island named Peuce (the Fir)]] at the mouth of the [[Danube]] in present day [[Romania]]. King of the [[Visigoths]] from 395&amp;ndash;410, Alaric was the first [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] leader to take the city of [[Rome]]. Having originally desired to settle his people in the Roman Empire, he finally sacked the city, marking the decline of imperial power in the west.

Alaric, whose name means &quot;king of all&quot; was well-born, his father kindred to the [[Balti dynasty|Balti]], a tribe competing with the [[Amali]] among Gothic fighters. He belonged to the western Gothic branch, the [[Visigoths]]. At the time of his birth, the Visigoths dwelt in [[Bulgaria]], having fled beyond the wide estuary marshes of the [[Danube]] to its southern shore so as not to be followed by their foes from the [[steppe]], the [[Huns]]. There is evidence, however, as suggested by Peter Heather, that the Huns were not near the Danube until closer to the 5th century. What ''is'' certain is that the Visigoths' westward migration occurred in response to the threat posed by the Huns. Heather asserts, &quot;Mysterious as the Huns' origins and animating forces may remain, there is no doubt at all that they were behind the strategic revolution that brought the Goths to the Danube in the summer of 376.&quot; Moreover, concerning the Huns displacement of the Goths, ancient historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] concluded, &quot;The seed-bed and origin of all this destruction and of the various calamities inflicted by the wrath of Mars, which raged everywhere with extraordinary fury, I find to be this: the people of the Huns.&quot; Ammianus Marcellinus was right - the Huns were behind the military revolution that had brought the Tervingi and Greuthungi to the Danube sometime in the late summer or autumn of 376. It now presented Emperor [[Valens]] with a huge dilemma- tens of thousands of displaced Goths had suddenly arrived on his borders requesting asylum.

==In Roman service==
[[Image:AlaricTheGoth.jpg|300px|An 1894 [[photogravure]] of Alaric I taken from a painting by [[Ludwig Thiersch]]|thumb|right]]
During the fourth century, the [[Roman emperors]] commonly employed ''[[foederati]]'': Germanic [[irregular military|irregular troops]] under Roman command, but organized by tribal structures. To spare the provincial populations from excessive taxation and to save money, emperors began to employ units recruited from Germanic tribes. The rich balked at furnishing recruits from their own estates in the numbers needed for the empire's defense and ordinary folk were reluctant to serve. Instead, the rich paid a special tax to fund the hiring of mercenaries. Moreover, the emperors—ever fearful that a brilliantly successful general of Roman extraction might be proclaimed [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] by his followers—preferred that high military command should be in the hands of one to whom such an accession of dignity was impossible. The largest of these contingents was that of the Goths, who in 382, had been allowed to settle within the imperial boundaries, keeping a large degree of autonomy.

In 394, Alaric served as a leader of ''foederati'' under [[Theodosius I]] in the campaign which crushed the usurper [[Eugenius]]. As the [[Battle of the Frigidus]], which terminated this campaign, was fought at the passes of the [[Julian Alps]], Alaric probably learned the weakness of [[Italy|Italy's]] natural defences on its northeastern frontier at the head of the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]].

Theodosius died in 395, leaving the empire to be divided between his two sons [[Arcadius]] and [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]], the former taking the eastern and the latter, the western portion of the empire. Arcadius showed little interest in ruling, leaving most of the actual power to his [[Praetorian Prefect]] [[Rufinus (Byzantine official)|Rufinus]]. Honorius was still a minor; as his guardian, Theodosius had appointed the ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Stilicho]]. Stilicho also claimed to be the guardian of Arcadius, causing much rivalry between the western and eastern courts.

According to [[Edward Gibbon]] in The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, during the shifting of offices that took place at the beginning of the new reigns, Alaric apparently hoped he would be promoted from a mere commander to the rank of general in one of the regular armies. He was denied the promotion, however. Among the Visigoths settled in Lower [[Moesia]], the situation was ripe for rebellion. They had suffered disproportionately great losses at Frigidus. And according to rumour, exposing the Visigoths in battle was a convenient way of weakening the Gothic tribes. This, combined with their post-battle rewards, prompted them to raise Alaric &quot;on a shield&quot; and proclaim him king; according to [[Jordanes]] (a Gothic historian of varying importance, depending upon who is asked), both the new king and his people decided &quot;rather to seek new kingdoms by their own work, than to slumber in peaceful subjection to the rule of others.&quot;

==In Greece==
Alaric struck first at the eastern empire. He marched to the neighborhood of [[Constantinople]] but, finding himself unable to undertake a siege, retraced his steps westward and then marched southward through [[Thessaly]] and the unguarded pass of [[Thermopylae]] into [[Greece]].

The armies of the eastern empire were occupied with [[Huns|Hunnic]] incursions in [[Asia Minor]] and [[Syria]]. Instead, Rufinus attempted to negotiate with Alaric in person, which only aroused suspicions in Constantinople that Rufinius was in league with the Goths. Stilicho now marched east against Alaric. According to [[Claudian]], Stilicho was in a position to destroy the Goths when he was ordered by Arcadius to leave [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]]. Soon after, Rufinus' own soldiers hacked him to death. Power in Constantinople now passed to the eunuch Chamberlain [[Eutropius (Byzantine official)|Eutropius]].

Rufinus' death and Stilicho's departure gave free rein to Alaric's movements; he ravaged Attica but spared Athens, which capitulated at once to the conqueror. In 396, he wiped out the last remnants of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Mysteries at Eleusis]] in Attica, ending a tradition of esoteric religious ceremonies that had lasted since the [[Bronze Age]]. Then he penetrated into the [[Peloponnesus]] and captured its most famous cities—[[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], [[Argos]], and [[History of Sparta|Sparta]]—selling many of their inhabitants into slavery.

Here, however, his victorious career suffered a serious setback. In 397, Stilicho crossed the sea to Greece and succeeded in trapping the Goths in the mountains of [[Pholoe]], on the borders of [[Elis]] and [[Arcadia]] in the peninsula. From there Alaric escaped with difficulty, and not without some suspicion of connivance by Stilicho, who supposedly had again received orders to depart. Alaric then crossed the [[Gulf of Corinth]] and marched with the plunder of [[Greece]] northward to [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]]. Here his rampage continued until the eastern government appointed him ''magister militum per Illyricum'', giving him the Roman command he had desired, as well as the authority to resupply his men from the imperial arsenals.

==First invasion of Italy==
It was probably in 401 that Alaric made his first invasion of Italy,&lt;ref&gt;William N. Bayless, &quot;The Visigothic Invasion of Italy in 401&quot; ''The Classical Journal'' '''72'''.1 (October 1976), pp. 65-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Supernatural influences were not lacking to urge him to this great enterprise. Some lines of the Roman poet [[Claudian]] inform us that he heard a voice proceeding from a [[sacred grove]], &quot;Break off all delays, Alaric. This very year thou shalt force the Alpine barrier of Italy; thou shalt penetrate to the city.&quot; But the prophecy was not to be fulfilled at this time. After spreading desolation through North [[Italy]] and striking terror into the citizens of Rome, Alaric was met by [[Stilicho]] at [[Pollentia]], today in [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]]. The battle which followed on April 6, 402 (coinciding with Easter), was a victory for Rome, though a costly one. But it effectively halted the Goths' progress.

Stilicho's enemies later reproached him for having gained his victory by taking impious advantage of the great Christian festival. Alaric, too, was a Christian, though an [[Arianism|Arian]], not [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Orthodox]]. He had trusted to the sanctity of Easter for immunity from attack.

Alaric's wife was reportedly taken prisoner after this battle; it is not unreasonable to suppose that he and his troops were hampered by the presence of large numbers of women and children, which gave his invasion of Italy the character of a [[human migration]].

After another defeat before [[Verona, Italy|Verona]], Alaric left Italy, probably in 403. He had not &quot;penetrated to the city&quot; but his invasion of Italy had produced important results. It caused the imperial residence to be transferred from [[Milan]] to [[Ravenna]], and necessitated the withdrawal of [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|Legio XX ''Valeria Victrix'']] from Britain.

==Second invasion of Italy==
Alaric became the friend and ally of his late opponent, Stilicho. By 407, the estrangement between the eastern and western courts had become so bitter that it threatened civil war. Stilicho actually proposed using Alaric's troops to enforce Honorius' claim to the [[prefecture]] of Illyricum. The death of Arcadius in May 408 caused milder counsel to prevail in the western court, but Alaric, who had actually entered Epirus, demanded in a somewhat threatening manner that if he were thus suddenly requested to desist from war, he should be paid handsomely for what modern language would call the &quot;expenses of [[mobilization]]&quot;. The sum which he named was a large one, 4,000&amp;nbsp;pounds of gold. Under strong pressure from Stilicho, the Roman senate consented to promise its payment.

But three months later, Stilicho and the chief ministers of his party were treacherously slain on Honorius' orders. In the unrest that followed throughout Italy, the wives and children of the foederati were slain. Consequently, these 30,000 men flocked to Alaric's camp, clamouring to be led against their cowardly enemies. He accordingly led them across the Julian Alps and, in September 408, stood before the walls of [[Rome]] (now with no capable general like Stilicho as a defender) and began a strict blockade.

No blood was shed this time; Alaric relied on hunger as his most powerful weapon. When the ambassadors of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], entreating for peace, tried to intimidate him with hints of what the despairing citizens might accomplish, he laughed and gave his celebrated answer: &quot;The thicker the hay, the easier mowed!&quot; After much bargaining, the famine-stricken citizens agreed to pay a ransom of 5,000 pounds of gold, 30,000 pounds of silver, 4,000 silken tunics, 3,000 hides dyed scarlet, and 3,000 pounds of pepper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nor&quot;&gt;J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Early Centuries'', 134&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ended Alaric's first siege of Rome.

===Second siege of Rome===
Throughout his career, Alaric's primary goal was not to undermine the empire, but to secure for himself a regular and recognized position within the empire's borders. His demands were certainly grand&amp;mdash; the concession of a block of territory 200&amp;nbsp;miles long by 150 wide between the Danube and the Gulf of Venice (to be held probably on some terms of nominal dependence on the empire) and the title of commander-in-chief of the imperial army&amp;mdash;. Immense as his terms were, the emperor would have been well advised to grant them. Honorius, however, refused to see beyond his own safety, guaranteed by the dikes and marshes of Ravenna. As all attempts to conduct a satisfactory negotiation with this emperor failed, Alaric, after instituting a second siege and blockade of Rome in 409, came to terms with the senate. With their consent, he set up a rival emperor, the prefect of the city, a Greek named [[Priscus Attalus]].

===Third siege of Rome===
{{main|Sack of Rome (410)}}
[[File:Sack of Rome by the Visigoths on 24 August 410 by JN Sylvestre 1890.jpg|thumb|[[Sack of Rome (410)|The Sack of Rome]] by the Visigoths on 24 August 410 by [[Joseph-Noël Sylvestre|J-N Sylvestre]] (1890)]]

Alaric cashiered his ineffectual puppet emperor after eleven months and again tried to reopen negotiations with Honorius. These negotiations might have succeeded had it not been for the malignant influence of another Goth, [[Sarus (Goth)|Sarus]], an Amali, and therefore hereditary enemy of Alaric and his house. Alaric, again outwitted by an enemy's machinations, marched southward and in deadly earnest, began his third siege of Rome. Apparently, defence was impossible; there are hints, not well substantiated, of treachery; surprise is a more likely explanation. However, this may be&amp;mdash;for our information at this point of the story is meagre&amp;mdash;on August 24 410, Alaric and his Visigoths burst in by the [[Porta Salaria]] on the northeast of the city. Rome, for so long victorious against its enemies, was now at the mercy of its foreign conquerors.

The contemporary [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastics]] recorded with wonder many instances of the Visigoths' clemency: Christian churches saved from ravage; protection granted to vast multitudes both of pagans and Christians who took refuge therein; vessels of gold and silver which were found in a private dwelling, spared because they &quot;belonged to St. Peter&quot;; at least one case in which a beautiful Roman matron appealed, not in vain, to the better feelings of the Gothic soldier who attempted her dishonor. But even these exceptional instances show that Rome was not entirely spared the horrors which usually accompany the storming of a besieged city. Nonetheless, the written sources do not mention damages wrought by fire, save the [[Gardens of Sallust]], which were situated close to the gate by which the Goths had made their entrance; nor is there any reason to attribute any extensive destruction of the buildings of the city to Alaric and his followers. The [[Basilica Aemilia]] in the [[Roman Forum]] did burn down, which perhaps can be attributed to Alaric: the archaeological evidence was provided by coins dating from 410 found melted in the floor. The pagan emperors' tombs of the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]] and [[Castel Sant'Angelo]] were rifled and the ashes scattered.

===Death and funeral===
[[Image:Death of Alaric.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The burial of Alaric in the bed of the [[Busento River]]. 1895 lithograph]]

Alaric, having penetrated the city, marched southwards into [[Calabria]]. He desired to invade Africa, which, thanks to its grain, had become the key to holding Italy. But a storm battered his ships into pieces and many of his soldiers drowned. Alaric died soon after in [[Cosenza]], probably of fever,&lt;ref&gt;Erik Durschmied, ''From Armageddon to the Fall of Rome'', p401&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of about forty (assuming again, a birth around 370 AD), and his body was, according to legend, buried under the riverbed of the [[Busento]]. The stream was temporarily turned aside from its course while the grave was dug wherein the Gothic chief and some of his most precious spoils were interred. When the work was finished, the river was turned back into its usual channel and the captives by whose hands the labor had been accomplished were put to death that none might learn their secret.

Alaric was succeeded in the command of the Gothic army by his brother-in-law, [[Ataulf]], who married Honorius' sister [[Galla Placidia]] three years later .

===Sources===
The chief authorities on the career of Alaric are: the historian [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] and the poet [[Claudian]], both contemporary, neither disinterested; [[Zosimus]], a historian who lived probably about half a century after Alaric's death; and [[Jordanes]], a Goth who wrote the history of his nation in 551, basing his work on [[Trojan War|The Trojan War]]. The legend of Alaric's burial in the Buzita River comes from Jordanes.

'''Alaric II''', also known as Alarik, Alarich, and ''Alarico'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] or ''Alaricus'' in [[Latin]] (d. 507) succeeded his father [[Euric]] in 485 and became eighth king of the [[Visigoths]]. He established his capital at [[Aire-sur-l'Adour]] (''Vicus Julii''). His dominions included not only the whole of [[Hispania]] except its north-western corner but also [[Gallia Aquitania]] and the greater part of an as-yet undivided [[Gallia Narbonensis]].

==Reign==
In 486 Alaric II denied refuge to [[Syagrius]], the former ruler of the [[Domain of Soissons]] (in what is now north western France) who was defeated by [[Clovis I]] King of the Franks. Alarmed by a summons from Clovis, Alaric imprisoned and repatriated Syagrius back to Clovis I, where he was beheaded.
[[File:Alarico II.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Illustration of Alaric II at [[Biblioteca Nacional de España]]]]
In 506, the Visigoths captured the city of [[Dertosa]] in the [[Ebro valley]]. There they captured the [[Roman usurper]] [[Peter (usurper)|Peter]] and had him executed.

In religion Alaric was an [[Arianism|Arian]], like all the early Visigothic nobles, but he greatly mitigated the persecution policy of his father Euric toward the [[Catholicism|Catholics]] and authorized them to hold in 506AD the council of [[Agde]]. He was on uneasy terms with the Catholic bishops of [[Arelate]] (modern Arles) as epitomized in the career of the Frankish [[Caesarius of Arles|Caesarius, bishop of Arles]], born at [[Châlons]] and appointed bishop in 503. Caesarius was suspected of conspiring with the [[Burgundians]], whose king had married the sister of [[Clovis I|Clovis]], to allow the Burgundians to take over Arles. Alaric exiled him for a year at [[Bordeaux]] in Aquitania, then allowed him to return unharmed when the crisis had passed ([http://www.ccel.org/w/wace/biodict/htm/iii.iii.iv.htm Wace, ''Dictionary'']).

He displayed similar wisdom in political affairs by appointing a commission to prepare an abstract of the Roman laws and imperial decrees, which would form the authoritative code for his Roman subjects. This is generally known as the ''Breviarium Alaricianum'' or [[Breviary of Alaric]].

==Battle of Vouillé and aftermath==
Alaric endeavoured strictly to maintain the treaty which his father had concluded with the [[Franks]]. The Frankish king [[Clovis I]], however, desired to obtain the Gothic province in Gaul and he found a pretext for war in the Arianism of Alaric. The intervention of [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]], king of the [[Ostrogoths]] and father-in-law of Alaric, proved unavailing. The two armies met in 507 at the [[Battle of Vouillé]], near Poitiers, where the Goths were defeated and Alaric the king, who tried to flee, was captured and slain, it is said, by Clovis personally. As a consequence of their defeat the Visigoths lost all their possessions in [[Gaul]] to the Franks, except [[Septimania]] (i.e. the western region of Gallia Narbonensis, which includes the contemporary [[Arles]] and the [[Provence]]). Alaric was succeeded by his eldest son, the illegitimate, [[Gesalec]], because his legitimate son [[Amalaric]] was still a child.

'''Albertus Magnus''', [[Dominican Order|O.P.]] (1193/1206&amp;nbsp;– November 15, 1280), also known as '''Albert the Great''' and '''Albert of Cologne''', was a Dominican [[Dominican friar|friar]] and  a [[bishop]], who achieved fame for his comprehensive knowledge of and advocacy for the peaceful [[Relationship between religion and science|coexistence of science and religion]]. Those such as James A. Weisheipl and Joachim R. Söder have referred to him as the greatest German philosopher and theologian of the [[Middle Ages]], an opinion supported by contemporaries such as [[Roger Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;Joachim R. Söder, “Albert der Grosse – ein staunen-
erregendes Wunder,” Wort und Antwort 41 (2000): 145; J.A. Weisheipl, “Albertus Magnus,” Joseph Strayer ed., Dictionary of the Middle Ages 1 (New York: Scribner, 1982) 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church]] honours him as a [[Doctor of the Church]], one of only 33 persons with that honor.

==Biography==
He was born sometime between 1193 and 1206, to the Count of Bollstädt in [[Lauingen]] in [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy | wstitle=St. Albertus Magnus |last=Kennedy |first=D.J. |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaries such as [[Roger Bacon]] applied the term &quot;Magnus&quot; to Albertus during his own lifetime, referring to his immense reputation as a scholar and philosopher.

Albertus was educated principally at [[University of Padua|Padua]], where he received instruction in Aristotle's writings. A late account by Rudolph de Novamagia refers to Albertus' encounter with the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], who convinced him to enter [[Holy Orders]]. In 1223 (or 1221) he became a member of the Dominican Order, against the wishes of his family, and studied [[theology]] at [[Bologna]] and elsewhere. Selected to fill the position of lecturer at Cologne, Germany, where the Dominicans had a house, he taught for several years there, at [[Regensburg]], [[Freiburg]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Hildesheim]]. In 1245 he went to [[Paris]], received his doctorate and taught for some time as a master of theology with great success. During this time [[Thomas Aquinas]] began to study under Albertus.
[[Image:Vincenzo onofri, sant'alberto magno, 1493.JPG|thumb|Bust of Albertus Magnus by [[Vincenzo Onofri]], c. 1493]]

In 1254 Albertus was made [[provincial superior|provincial]] of the Dominican Order, and fulfilled the arduous duties of the office with great care and efficiency. During his tenure he publicly defended the Dominicans against attacks by the secular and regular faculty of the [[University of Paris]], commented on [[John the Evangelist|St John]], and answered what he perceived as errors of the [[Early Islamic philosophy|Arabian philosopher]] [[Averroes]].

In 1260 [[Pope Alexander IV]] made him [[Bishop of Regensburg]], an office from which he resigned after three years. During the exercise of his duties he enhanced his reputation for humility by refusing to ride a horse—in accord with the dictates of the Dominican order—instead walking back and forth across his huge diocese. This earned him the affectionate sobriquet, &quot;boots the bishop,&quot; from his parishioners. After his stint as bishop, he spent the remainder of his life partly in retirement in the various houses of his order, yet often preaching throughout southern Germany. In 1270 he preached the [[eighth Crusade]] in [[Austria]]. Among the last of his labors was the defense of the orthodoxy of his former pupil, [[Thomas Aquinas]], whose death in 1274 grieved Albertus. After suffering a collapse of health in 1278, he died on November 15, 1280, in Cologne, [[Germany]]. His tomb is in the [[crypt]] of the Dominican church of St. [[Andreas]] in Cologne, and his relics at the [[Cologne Cathedral]].

Albertus is frequently mentioned by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], who made his doctrine of [[free will]] the basis of his ethical system. In his [[Divine Comedy]], Dante places Albertus with his pupil Thomas Aquinas among the great lovers of wisdom (''Spiriti Sapienti'') in the Heaven of the Sun. Albertus is also mentioned, along with [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and [[Paracelsus]], in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', where his writings serve as an influence to a young [[Victor Frankenstein]].

Albertus was [[beatified]] in 1622. He was [[canonized]] and proclaimed a [[Doctor of the Church]] in 1931 by [[Pope Pius XI]]. St Albert's [[feast day]] is celebrated on November 15.

==Writings==
[[Image:Albertus Magnus-Denkmal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Albertus Magnus monument in [[Cologne]]]]
Albertus' writings collected in 1899 went to thirty-eight volumes. These displayed his prolific habits and literally encyclopedic knowledge of topics such as [[logic]], [[theology]], [[botany]], [[geography]], [[astronomy]], [[astrology]], [[mineralogy]], [[chemistry]], [[zoology]], [[physiology]], [[phrenology]] and others; all of which were the result of logic and observation. He was perhaps the most well-read author of his time. He digested, interpreted and systematized the whole of Aristotle's works, gleaned from the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, in accordance with Church doctrine. Most modern knowledge of Aristotle was preserved and presented by Albertus.

Albertus' activity, however, was more philosophical than theological (see [[Scholasticism]]). The philosophical works, occupying the first six and the last of the twenty-one volumes, are generally divided according to the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] scheme of the sciences, and consist of interpretations and condensations of Aristotle's relative works, with supplementary discussions upon contemporary topics, and occasional divergences from the opinions of the master.

His principal theological works are a commentary in three volumes on the Books of the Sentences of [[Peter Lombard]] (''Magister Sententiarum''), and the ''Summa Theologiae'' in two volumes. The latter is in substance a more didactic repetition of the former.

==Natural philosopher==

Albertus's knowledge of physical science was considerable and for the age remarkably accurate. His industry in every department was great, and though we find in his system many gaps which are characteristic of scholastic philosophy, his protracted study of Aristotle gave him a great power of systematic thought and exposition. An exception to this general tendency is his Latin treatise &quot;De falconibus&quot; (later inserted in the larger work, ''De Animalibus'', as book 23, chapter 40), in which he displays impressive actual knowledge of a) the differences between the birds of prey and the other kinds of birds; b) the different kinds of falcons; c) the way of preparing them for the hunt; and d) the cures for sick and wounded falcons.&lt;ref&gt;An Smets, &quot;Le réception en langue vulgaire du &quot;De falconibus&quot; d'Albert le Grand,&quot; in: ''Medieval Forms of Argument: Disputation and Debate'', ed. Georgiana Donavin, Carol Poster, and Richard Utz (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2002), pp. 189-99.&lt;/ref&gt; His scholarly legacy justifies his contemporaries' bestowing upon him the honourable surname ''Doctor Universalis.'' 

In the centuries since his death, many stories arose about Albertus as an [[Alchemy|alchemist]] and magician. On the subject of alchemy and chemistry, many treatises relating to ''Alchemy'' have been attributed to him, though in his authentic writings he had little to say on the subject, and then mostly through commentary on Aristotle. For example, in his commentary, ''De mineralibus'', he refers to the power of stones, but does not elaborate on what these powers might be.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wieland, “Albert der Grosse.  Der Entwurf einer eigenständigen Philosophie,” Philosophen des Mittelalters  (Darmstadt: Primus, 2000) 124-39.&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of Pseudo-Albertine works dealing with alchemy exist, though, showing the belief developed in the generations following Albert's death that he had mastered alchemy, one of the fundamental sciences of the Middle Ages. These include ''Metals and Materials''; the ''Secrets of Chemistry''; the ''Origin of Metals''; the ''Origins of Compounds'', and a ''Concordance ''which is a collection of ''Observations on the [[philosopher's stone]]''; and other alchemy-chemistry topics, collected under the name of ''Theatrum Chemicum''.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, John, ''The Thirteenth, Greatest of Centuries.'' 1907:46.[http://books.google.com/books?id=_rofAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA46&amp;dq=albertus+magnus+gold+minerals#PRA2-PA46,M1 Available online.]&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with the discovery of the element [[arsenic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;BuildingBlocks451-3&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Emsley |first=John |title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements |year=2001 |isbn=0-19-850341-5 |pages=43,513,529 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and experimented with photosensitive chemicals, including [[silver nitrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Davidson | first = Michael W. | coauthors = National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at The Florida State University | title = Molecular Expressions: Science, Optics and You&amp;nbsp;— Timeline&amp;nbsp;— Albertus Magnus | publisher = The Florida State University | date = 2003-08-01 | url = http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/optics/timeline/people/magnus.html | accessdate = 2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Szabadváry | first = Ferenc

However, there is scant evidence that he personally performed alchemical experiments. Much of the modern confusion results from the fact that later works, particularly the alchemical work known as the ''Secreta Alberti'' or the ''Experimenta Alberti'', were falsely attributed to Albertus by their authors in order to increase the prestige of the text through association.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

According to legend, Albertus Magnus is said to have discovered the [[philosopher's stone]] and passed it to his pupil [[Thomas Aquinas]], shortly before his death. Magnus does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings, but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by &quot;transmutation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn and Frederick E. Budd. ''A Survey of the Occult.'' Electric Book Company. 2001. p. 28-30. ISBN 1843270870.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Thomas Aquinas died six years before Albertus Magnus' death, this legend as stated is unlikely.

However, it is true that Albertus was deeply interested in astrology, as has been articulated by scholars such as Paola Zambelli.&lt;ref&gt;Paola Zambelli, &quot;The Speculum Astronomiae and its Enigma&quot; Dordrecht.&lt;/ref&gt; While today we would view this as evidence of superstition, in the high Middle Ages—and well into the early modern period—few intellectuals, if any, questioned the basic assumptions of astrology: humans live within a web of celestial influences that affect our bodies, and thereby motivate us to behave in certain ways. Within this worldview, it was logical to believe that astrology could be used to predict the probable future of a human being. Albertus made this a central component of his philosophical system, arguing that an understanding of the celestial influences affecting us could help us to live our lives more in accord with Christian precepts. The most comprehensive statement of his astrological beliefs is to be found in a work he authored around 1260, now known as the ''[[Speculum astronomiae]]''. However, details of these beliefs can be found in almost everything he wrote, from his early ''Summa de bono'' to his last work, the ''Summa theologiae''.

==Music==
Albertus is known for his enlightening commentary on the musical practice of his times. Most of his written musical observations are found in his commentary on Aristotle's ''Poetics''. He rejected the idea of &quot;[[Musica universalis|music of the spheres]]&quot; as ridiculous: movement of astronomical bodies, he supposed, is incapable of generating sound. He also wrote extensively on proportions in music, and on the three different subjective levels on which [[plainchant]] could work on the human soul: purging of the impure; illumination leading to contemplation; and nourishing perfection through contemplation. Of particular interest to 20th century music theorists is the attention he paid to silence as an integral part of music.

In ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'' [[Søren Kierkegaard]] wrote that Albert Magnus, &quot;arrogantly boasted of his speculation before the deity and suddenly became stupid.&quot; Kierkegaard cites [[G. O. Marbach]] who he quotes as saying &quot;Albertus repente ex asino factus philosophus et ex philosopho asinus&quot; [Albert was suddenly transformed from an ass into a philosopher and from a philosopher into an ass].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Concept of Anxiety]], [[Princeton University Press]], 1980, ISBN 0-691-02011-6, pp. 150–151&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, he was cited by [[William F. Buckley]] as one of several historical figures whose best qualities would be emulated by the ideal President.

The typeface [[Albertus (typeface)|Albertus]] is named in his memory.

In [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', Albertus Magnus is referred to as one of Victor Frankenstein's chosen readings. He is also referred to in [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''The Birth-mark'' and [[Herman Melville]]'s ''The Bell Tower''. In [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' novels, the character of Alberto Mallich (founder of the Unseen University and later Death's manservant Albert) is a sly nod to Albertus Magnus in his more legendary and esoteric guise. [[Walter M. Miller, Jr.]]'s novel [[A Canticle for Leibowitz]] centers on a monastic order called the Albertian Order of Leibowitz, named by its founder after Albertus Magnus and dedicated to preserving scientific knowledge lost after a [[nuclear war]].

==Influence and tribute==
A number of schools are named after Albert, including [[Albertus Magnus High School]], in [[Bardonia, New York]], and [[Albertus Magnus College]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. The main science building at [[Providence College]] is named in honor of Albertus Magnus.

The [[Academy for Science and Design]] in [[New Hampshire]] honored Albertus by naming one of its four houses Magnus House.

The [[University of Houston]] Law Center displays a statute of Albertus Magnus as a tribute to the scholar's contributions to the law.

The Albertus-Magnus-Gymnasium is found in [[Regensburg]], Germany.

In [[Managua]], Nicaragua, the Albertus Magnus International Institute, a business and economic development research center, was founded in 2004.

The Albertus Magnus Building at the [[University of Santo Tomas]] that houses the Conservatory of Music, College of Tourism and Hospitality Management, College of Education, and UST Education High School is named in his honor. The Saint Albert the Great Science Academy in [[San Carlos City]], [[Pangasinan]], which offers preschool, elementary and high school education, takes pride in having St. Albert as their patron saint. Its main building was named Albertus Magnus Hall in 2008.

'''Alboin''' (530s – June 28, 572) was king of the [[Lombards]] from about 560 until 572. During his reign the Lombards ended their [[migration period|migrations]] by settling in Italy, the northern part of which Alboin conquered between 569 and 572. He had a lasting impact on Italy and the [[Pannonian Basin]]; in the former his invasion marked the beginning of centuries of Lombard rule, and in the latter his defeat of the [[Gepids]] and his departure from [[Pannonia]] ended the dominance of the [[Germanic peoples]].

The period of Alboin's reign as king in Pannonia following the death of his father, [[Audoin]], was one of confrontation and conflict between the Lombards and their main neighbors, the Gepids. The Gepids initially gained the upper hand, but in 567, thanks to his alliance with the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]], Alboin inflicted a decisive defeat on his enemies, whose lands the Avars subsequently occupied. The increasing power of his new neighbours caused Alboin some unease however, and he therefore decided to leave Pannonia for Italy, hoping to take advantage of the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s reduced ability to defend its territory in the wake of the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]].

After succeeding in gathering together a large coalition of peoples, Alboin began his trek in 568. After crossing the [[Julian Alps]] he entered an almost undefended Italy, and rapidly took control of most of [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] and [[Liguria]]. In 569, unopposed, he took northern Italy's main city, [[Milan]]. [[Pavia]] offered stiff resistance however, and was only taken after a siege lasting three years. During that time Alboin turned his attention to [[Tuscany]], but signs of factionalism among his supporters and Alboin's diminishing control over his army increasingly began to manifest themselves.

Alboin was assassinated on June 28, 572, in a [[coup d'état]] instigated by the Byzantines. It was organized by the king's foster brother, [[Helmichis]], with the support of Alboin's wife, [[Rosamund (Gepid)|Rosamund]], daughter of the Gepid king whom Alboin had killed some years earlier. The coup failed in the face of opposition from a majority of the Lombards, who elected [[Cleph]] as Alboin's successor, forcing Helmichis and Rosamund to flee to [[Ravenna]] under imperial protection. Alboin's death deprived the Lombards of the only leader who could have kept the newborn Germanic entity together, the last in the line of hero-kings who had led the Lombards through their migrations from Elba to Italy. For many centuries following his death Alboin's heroism and his success in battle were celebrated in Saxon and Bavarian epic poetry.

== Father's rule ==
The Lombards under King [[Wacho]] had migrated towards the east into Pannonia, taking advantage of the difficulties facing the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in Italy following the death of its founder, [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]] in 526. Wacho's death in about 540 brought his son [[Walthari]] to the throne, but as the latter was still a minor the kingdom was governed in his stead by Alboin's father, Audoin, of the [[Gausian dynasty|Gausian]] clan. Seven years later the king died, giving Audoin the opportunity to crown himself and overthrow the reigning [[Lethings]].&lt;ref&gt;Jarnut 1995, pp. 16–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Alboin was probably born in the 530s in Pannonia,&lt;ref name=&quot;PLRE3&quot;&gt;Martindale 1992, ''s.v. Alboin'', pp. 38–40&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Audoin and the king's wife [[Rodelinda (6th century)|Rodelinda]]. She may have been the niece of King Theodoric and betrothed to Audoin through the mediation of Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]].&lt;ref&gt;Rovagnati 2003, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amory 2003, p. 462&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father, Alboin was raised a pagan, although Audoin had at one point attempted to gain Byzantine support against his neighbours by professing himself a Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham 1989, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; Alboin took as his first wife the Catholic [[Chlothsind]], daughter of the [[Franks|Frankish]] King [[Chlothar I|Chlothar]]. This marriage, which took place soon after the death of the Frankish ruler [[Theudebald]] in 555, is thought to reflect Audoin's decision to distance himself from the Byzantines, traditional allies of the Lombards, who had been lukewarm when it came to supporting Audoin against the Gepids. The new Frankish alliance was important because of the Franks' known hostility to the Byzantine empire, providing the Lombards with more than one option.&lt;ref&gt;Jarnut 1995, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;&gt;Bertolini 1960, pp. 34–38.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''[[Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire]]'' interprets events and sources differently, believing that Alboin married Chlothsind when already a king in or shortly before 561, the year of Chlothar's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLRE3&quot;/&gt;

Alboin first distinguished himself on the battlefield in a clash with the Gepids. At the [[Battle of Asfeld]] he killed [[Turismod]], son of the Gepid king [[Thurisind]], in a victory that resulted in the Emperor Justinian's intervention to maintain equilibrium between the rival regional powers.&lt;ref&gt;Rovagnati 2003, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; After the battle, according to a tradition reported by [[Paul the Deacon]], to be granted the right to sit at his father's table Alboin had to ask for the hospitality of a foreign king, and have him donate his weapons, as was customary. For this initiation he went to the court of Thurisind, where the Gepid king gave him Turismod's arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLRE3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ausenda 1999, p. 433&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Goffart]] believes it is probable that in this narrative Paul was making use of an oral tradition, and is sceptical that it can be considered a typical ''heldenlied'' (&quot;[[epic poetry|hero's lay]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Goffart 1988, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reign in Pannonia ==

Alboin came to the throne after the death of his father, sometime between 560 and 565.&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt; As was customary among the Lombards, Alboin took the crown after an election by the tribe's freemen, who traditionally selected the king from the dead sovereign's clan.&lt;ref&gt;Jarnut 1995, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram 1997, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, in 565, a new war erupted with the Gepids, now led by [[Cunimund]], Thurisind's son. The cause of the conflict is uncertain, as the sources are divided; the Lombard Paul the Deacon accuses the Gepids, while the Byzantine historian [[Menander Protector]] places the blame on Alboin, an interpretation favoured by historian [[Walter Pohl]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pohl96&quot;&gt;Pohl 1997, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

An account of the war by the Byzantine [[Theophylact Simocatta]] sentimentalises the reasons behind the conflict, claiming it originated with Alboin's vain courting and subsequent kidnapping of Cunimund's daughter [[Rosamund (Gepid)|Rosamund]], that Alboin proceeded then to marry. The tale is treated with scepticism by Walter Goffart, who observes that it conflicts with the ''[[Origo Gentis Langobardorum]]'', where she was captured only after the death of her father.&lt;ref name=&quot;WG392&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martindale 1992, ''s.v. Cunimundus'', p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; The Gepids obtained the support of the Emperor in exchange for a promise to cede him the region of [[Sirmium]], the seat of the Gepid kings. Thus in 565 or 566 Justinian's successor [[Justin II]] sent his son-in-law [[Baduarius]] as ''[[magister militum]]'' (field commander) to lead a Byzantine army against Alboin in support of Cunimund, ending in the Lombards' complete defeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pohl96&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rovagnati 2003, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JJ22&quot;&gt;Jarnut 1995, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martindale 1992, ''s.v. Baduarius (2)'', pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with the possibility of annihilation, Alboin made an alliance in 566 with the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] under [[Bayan I]], at the expense of some tough conditions; the Avars demanded a tenth of the Lombards' cattle, half of the war booty, and on the war's conclusion all of the lands held by the Gepids. The Lombards played on the pre-existing hostility between the Avars and the Byzantines, claiming that the latter were allied with the Gepids. Cunimund, on the other hand, encountered hostility when he once again asked the Emperor for military assistance, as the Byzantines had been angered by the Gepids' failure to cede Sirmium to them, as had been agreed. Moreover, Justin II was moving away from the foreign policy of Justinian, and believed in dealing more strictly with bordering states and peoples. Attempts to mollify Justin II with tributes failed, and as a result the Byzantines kept themselves neutral if not outright supportive of the Avars.&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pohl 1997, pp. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt;

In 567 the allies made their final move against Cunimund, with Alboin invading the Gepids' lands from the northwest while Bayan attacked from the northeast. Cunimund attempted to prevent the two armies joining up by moving against the Lombards and clashing with Alboin somewhere between the [[Timiş River|Tibiscus]] and [[Danube River|Danube]] rivers. The Gepids were defeated in the ensuing battle, their king slain by Alboin, and Cunimund's daughter Rosamund taken captive, according to references in the ''Origo''. The full destruction of the Gepid kingdom was completed by the Avars, who overcame the Gepids in the east. As a result, the Gepids ceased to exist as an independent people, and were partly absorbed by the Lombards and the Avars.&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JJ22&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rovagnati 2003, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Some time before 568, Alboin's first wife Chlothsind died, and after his victory against Cunimund Alboin married Rosamund, to establish a bond with the remaining Gepids.&lt;ref name=&quot;SG20&quot;&gt;Gasparri 1990, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The war also marked a watershed in the geo-political history of the region, as together with the Lombard migration the following year, it signalled the end of six centuries of Germanic dominance in the Pannonian Basin.&lt;ref&gt;Curta 2001, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preparations and departure from Pannonia ==

Despite his success against the Gepids, Alboin had failed to greatly increase his power, and was now faced with a much stronger threat from the Avars.&lt;ref name=&quot;JJ29&quot;&gt;Jarnut 1995, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Historians consider this the decisive factor in convincing Alboin to undertake a migration, even though there are indications that before the war with the Gepids a decision was maturing to leave for Italy, a country thousands of Lombards had seen in the 550s when hired by the Byzantines to fight in the Gothic War.&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JM152&quot;&gt;Moorhead 2005, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Lombards would have known of the weakness of Byzantine Italy, which had endured a number of problems after being retaken from the Goths. In particular the so-called [[Plague of Justinian]] had ravaged the region and conflict remained endemic, with the [[Three-Chapter Controversy]] sparking religious opposition and administration at a standstill after the able governor of the peninsula, [[Narses]], was recalled.&lt;ref&gt;Christie 1998, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless the Lombards viewed Italy as a rich land which promised great booty,&lt;ref name=&quot;JJ29&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SG25&quot;&gt;Gasparri 1990, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; assets Alboin used to gather together a horde which included not only Lombards but many other peoples of the region, including [[Heruli]], [[Suebi]], Gepids, [[Thuringii]], [[Bulgars]], [[Sarmatians]], the remaining Romans and a few Ostrogoths. But the most important group, other than the Lombards, were the [[Saxons]], of whom 20,000 participated in the trek. These Saxons were tributaries to the Frankish King [[Sigebert I|Sigebert]], and their participation indicates that Alboin had the support of the Franks for his venture.&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HS82&quot;&gt;Schutz 2002, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise size of the heterogeneous group gathered by Alboin is impossible to know, and many different estimates have been made. [[Neil Christie]] considers 150,000 to be a realistic size,  a number which would make the Lombards a more numerous force than the Ostrogoths on the eve of their invasion of Italy. Jörg Jarnut proposes 100,000–150,000 as an approximation; Wilfried Menghen in ''Die Langobarden'' estimates 150,000 to 200,000; while Stefano Gasparri cautiously judges the peoples united by Alboin to be somewhere between 100,000 and 300,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;SG25&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HS82&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NC634&quot;&gt;Christie 1998, pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JJ30&quot;&gt;Jarnut 1995, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vipava valley from Nanos.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A photo showing a valley and a mountain|The Vipava Valley, through which Alboin led the Lombards into Italy]]As a precautionary move Alboin strengthened his alliance with the Avars, signing what Paul calls a ''foedus perpetuum'' (&quot;perpetual treaty&quot;) and what is referred to in the 9th-century ''[[Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani]]'' as a ''pactum et foedus amicitiae'' (&quot;pact and friendship treaty&quot;), adding that the treaty was put down on paper. By the conditions accepted in the treaty, the Avars were to take possession of Pannonia and the Lombards were promised military support in Italy should the need arise; also, for a period of 200&amp;nbsp;years the Lombards were to maintain the right to reclaim their former territories if the plan to conquer Italy failed, thus leaving Alboin with an alternative open. The accord also had the advantage of protecting Alboin's rear, as an Avar-occupied Pannonia would make it difficult for the Byzantines to bring forces to Italy by land. The agreement proved immensely successful, and relations with the Avars were almost uninterruptedly friendly during the lifetime of the Lombard Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Pohl 1997, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HW286&quot;&gt;Wolfram 1997, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jarnut 1995, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

A further cause of the Lombard migration into Italy may have been an invitation from Narses. According to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources, Narses, out of spite for having been removed by Justinian's successor Justin II, called the Lombards to Italy. Often dismissed as an unreliable tradition,&lt;ref name=&quot;JJ30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitby 2001, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; it has been studied with attention by modern scholars, in particular Neil Christie, who see in it a possible record of a formal invitation by the Byzantine state to settle in northern Italy as ''[[foederati]]'', to help protect the region against the Franks, an arrangement that may have been disowned by Justin II after Narses' removal.&lt;ref name=&quot;JM152&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christie 1998, pp. 60–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pohl 1997, pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RC186&quot;&gt;Collins 1991, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

=== March to Italy ===

The Lombard migration started on Easter Monday, April 2, 568. The decision to combine the departure with a Christian celebration can be understood in the context of Alboin's recent conversion to [[Arianism|Arian Christianity]], as attested by the presence of Arian Gothic missionaries at his court.&lt;ref name=&quot;JM152&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SP43&quot;&gt;Palmieri 1996, pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; The conversion is likely to have been motivated mostly from political considerations, and intended to consolidate the migration's cohesion, distinguishing them from the Catholic Romans. It also connected Alboin and his people to the Gothic heritage, and in this way obtain the support of the Ostrogoths serving in the Byzantine army as ''foederati''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gasparri 1990, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that Alboin's migration could have been partly the result of a call from surviving Ostrogoths in Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;JM152&quot;/&gt;

The season chosen for leaving Pannonia was unusually early; the Germanic peoples generally waited until autumn before beginning a migration, giving themselves time to do the harvesting and replenish their granaries for the march. The reason behind the spring departure could be the anxiety induced by the neighboring Avars, despite the friendship treaty. Nomadic peoples like the Avars also waited for autumn to begin their military campaigns, as they needed enough forage for their horses. A sign of this anxiety can also be seen in the decision taken by Alboin to ravage Pannonia, which created a sanitary cordon between the Lombards and the Avars.&lt;ref name=&quot;HW286&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RC186&quot;/&gt;

The road followed by Alboin to reach Italy has been the subject of controversy, as is the length of the trek. According to Neil Christie the Lombards divided themselves into migrational groups, with a vanguard scouting the road, probably following the [[Ptuj|Poetovio]] – [[Celje|Celeia]] – [[Emona]] – [[Cividale del Friuli|Forum Iulii]] route, while the wagons and most of the people proceeded slowly behind because of the goods and chattels they brought with them, and possibly also because they were waiting for the Saxons to join them on the road. By September raiding parties were looting [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]], but it was probably only in 569 that the [[Julian Alps]] were crossed at the [[Vipava Valley]]; the eyewitness [[Secundus of Non]] gives the date as May 20 or 21.&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SG25&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NC634&quot;/&gt; The 569 date for the entry into Italy is not void of difficulties however, and Jörg Jarnut believes the conquest of most of Venetia had already been completed in 568. According to Carlo Guido Mor, a major difficulty remains in explaining how Alboin could have reached Milan on September 3 assuming he had passed the border only in the May of the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;JJ30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SP43&quot;/&gt;

And this was done&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paul 1907, pp. 64–66&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lombards penetrated into Italy without meeting any resistance from the border troops (''[[Late Roman army#Limitanei|milities limitanei]]''). The Byzantine military resources available on the spot were scant and of dubious loyalty, and the border forts may well have been left unmanned. What seems certain is that archaeological excavations have found no sign of violent confrontation in the sites that have been excavated. This agrees with Paul the Deacon's narrative, who speaks of a Lombard takeover in [[Friuli]] &quot;without any hindrance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Christie 1998, pp. 73, 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The first town to fall into the Lombards' hands was [[Cividale del Friuli|Forum Iulii]] (Cividale del Friuli), the seat of the local ''magister militum''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt; Alboin chose this walled centre close to the frontier to be capital of the [[Duchy of Friuli]] and made his nephew and [[shield bearer]] [[Gisulf I of Friuli|Gisulf]] [[Duke (Lombard)|duke]] of the region with the specific duty of defending the borders from eventual Byzantine or Avar attacks from the east. Gisulf obtained from his uncle the right to choose for his duchy those ''[[Fara (Lombard)|farae]]'', or clans, that he preferred.&lt;ref name=&quot;JJ30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christie 1998, pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HW2878&quot;&gt;Wolfram 1997, pp. 287–288&lt;/ref&gt;

Alboin's decision to create a duchy and designate a duke were both important innovations; until then, the Lombards had never had dukes or duchies based on a walled town. The innovation adopted was part of Alboin's borrowing of Roman and Ostrogothic administrative models, as in Late Antiquity the ''[[comes]] [[civitas|civitatis]]''  (city count) was the main local authority, with full administrative powers in his region. But the shift from count (''comes'') to duke (''dux'') and from county (''comitatus'') to duchy (''ducatus'') also signalled the progressive militarization of Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;HW2878&quot;/&gt; The selection of a fortified town as the centre for the new duchy was also an important change from the time in Pannonia, for while urbanized settlements had previously been ignored by the Lombards, now a considerable part of the nobility settled itself in Forum Iulii, a pattern that was repeated regularly by the Lombards in their other duchies.&lt;ref&gt;Christie 1998, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conquest of Milan ===
From Forum Iulii, Alboin next reached [[Aquileia]], the most important road junction in the northeast,&lt;ref name=&quot;HW288&quot;&gt;Wolfram 1997, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; and the administrative capital of Venetia. The imminent arrival of the Lombards had a considerable impact on the city's population; the [[List of bishops and patriarchs of Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquileia]] [[Paulinus I of Aquileia|Paulinus]] fled with his clergy and flock to the island of [[Grado, Italy|Grado]] in Byzantine-controlled territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madden 2004, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

From Aquileia, Alboin took the [[Via Postumia]] and swept through Venetia, taking in rapid succession [[Treviso|Tarvisium]] (Treviso), [[Vicenza|Vicentia]] (Vicenza), [[Verona]], [[Brescia|Brixia]] (Brescia) and [[Bergamo|Bergomum]] (Bergamo). The Lombards faced difficulties only in taking [[Oderzo|Opitergium]] (Oderzo), which Alboin decided to avoid, as he similarly avoided tackling the main Venetian towns closer to the coast on the [[Via Annia]], such as [[Altinum]], [[Padua|Patavium]] (Padova), [[Monselice|Mons Silicis]] (Monselice), [[Mantua]] and [[Cremona]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HW288&quot;/&gt; The invasion of Venetia generated a considerable level of turmoil, spurring waves of refugees from the Lombard-controlled interior to the Byzantine-held coast, often led by their bishops, and resulting in new settlements such as [[Torcello]] and [[Eraclea|Heraclia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lane 1991, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAH19&quot;&gt;Humphries 2001, pp. 535–536&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards 1979, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Alboin moved west in his march, invading the region of [[Liguria]] (north-east Italy) and reaching its capital [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]) on September 3, 569,  only to find it already abandoned by the ''[[vicarius]] Italiae'' (vicar of Italy), the authority entrusted with the administration of the diocese of [[Diocese of Annonarian Italy|Annonarian Italy]]. Archbishop [[Honoratus of Mediolanum|Honoratus]], his clergy, and part of the laity accompanied the ''vicarius Italiae'' to find a safe haven in the Byzantine port of [[Genoa|Genua]] (Genoa). Alboin counted the years of his reign from the capture of Milan, when he assumed the title of ''dominus Italiae'' (Lord of Italy). His success also meant the collapse of Byzantine defences in the northern part of the [[Po plain]], and large movements of refugees to Byzantine areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLRE3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christie 1998, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SG256&quot;&gt;Gasparri 1990, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Several explanations have been advanced to explain the swiftness and ease of the initial Lombard advance in northern Italy. It has been suggested that the towns' doors may have been opened by the betrayal of the Gothic auxiliaries in the Byzantine army, but historians generally hold that Lombard success occurred because Italy was not considered by Byzantium as a vital part of the empire, especially at a time when the empire was imperilled by the attacks of Avars and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] in the [[Balkans]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] in the east. The Byzantine decision not to contest the Lombard invasion reflects the desire of Justinian's successors to reorient the core of the Empire's polices eastward.&lt;ref name=&quot;SG256&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JJ31&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ostrogorsky 1993, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact of the migration on Annonarian Italy ===
The impact of the Lombard migration on the Late Roman aristocracy was disruptive, especially in combination with the Gothic War; the latter conflict had finished in the north only in 562, when the last Gothic stronghold, Verona, was taken.&lt;ref name=&quot;RC187&quot;&gt;Collins 1991, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Many men of means (Paul's ''possessores'') either lost their lives or their goods, but the exact extent of the despoliation of the Roman aristocracy is a subject of heated debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;JJ31&quot;&gt;Jarnut 1995, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wickham 2005, pp. 203, 210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moorhead 2005, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt; The clergy was also greatly affected. The Lombards were mostly pagans, and displayed little respect for the clergy and Church property. Many churchmen left their [[Episcopal see|sees]] to escape from the Lombards, like the two most senior bishops in the north, Honoratus and Paulinus. However, most of the [[suffragan bishop]]s in the north sought an accommodation with the Lombards, as did in 569 the bishop of Tarvisium [[Felix of Tarvisium|Felix]] when he journeyed to the [[Piave (river)|Piave river]] to parley with Alboin, obtaining respect for the Church and its goods in return for this act of homage. It seems certain that many sees maintained an uninterrupted episcopal succession through the turmoil of the invasion and the following years. The transition was eased by the hostility existing among the northern Italian bishops towards the papacy and the empire due to the religious dispute involving the &quot;[[Schism of the Three Chapters|Three-Chapter Controversy]]&quot;. In Lombard territory, churchmen were at least sure to avoid imperial religious persecution.&lt;ref name=&quot;JJ31&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram 1997, pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards 1979, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of Pierre Riché, the disappearance of 220 bishops' seats indicates that the Lombard migration was a crippling catastrophe for the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;HS84&quot;&gt;Schutz 2001, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Yet according to Walter Pohl the regions directly occupied by Alboin suffered less devastation and had a relatively robust survival rate for towns, whereas the occupation of territory by autonomous military bands interested mainly in raiding and looting had a more severe impact, with the bishoprics in such places rarely surviving.&lt;ref&gt;Pohl 1997, pp. 124–125&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Siege of Ticinum ===
[[File:Alboin's entrance into Pavia.jpg|thumb|alt=A book illustration with an armed man on a horse in a town, and below the writing &quot;Alboin in Pavia&quot;|A modern rendering of Alboin's entrance into Ticinum]]

The first attested instance of strong resistance to Alboin's migration took place at the town of [[Ticinum]] ([[Pavia]]), which he started to besiege in 569 and captured only after three years. The town was of strategic importance, sitting at the confluence of the rivers [[Po (river)|Po]] and [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]] and connected by waterways to Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine Italy and the seat of the [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy]]. Its fall cut direct communications between the garrisons stationed on the [[Alpes Maritimae]] and the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JJ30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christie 1998, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SG26&quot;&gt;Gasparri 1990, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HW290&quot;&gt;Wolfram 1997, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

Careful to maintain the initiative against the Byzantines, by 570 Alboin had taken their last defences in northern Italy except for the coastal areas of Liguria and Venetia and a few isolated inland centres such as [[Aosta|Augusta Praetoria]] (Aosta), [[Susa (Italy)|Segusio]] (Susa), and the island of [[Comacina|Amacina]] in the [[Lake Como|Larius Lucus]] (Lake Como).&lt;ref&gt;Rovagnati 2003, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; During Alboin's kingship the Lombards crossed the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] and plundered [[Tuscia]], but historians are not in full agreement as to whether this took place under his guidance and if this constituted anything more than raiding. According to [[Herwig Wolfram]], it was probably only in 578–579 that [[Tuscany]] was conquered, but Jörg Jarnut and others believe this began in some form under Alboin, although it was not completed by the time of his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLRE3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HS82&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JJ30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAH19&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HW290&quot;/&gt;

Alboin's problems in maintaining control over his people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy made it difficult for a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or ''duces'', who led each band (''fara'') of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as ''foederati'' but as enemies of the Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAH19&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Azzara 2009, pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WP99&quot;&gt;Pohl 1997, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

The king's disintegrating authority over his army was also manifested in the invasion of Frankish [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] which from 569 or 570 was subject to yearly raids on a major scale. The Lombard attacks were ultimately repelled following [[Mummolus]]' victory at [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]]. These attacks had lasting political consequences, souring the previously cordial Lombard-Frankish relations and opening the door to an alliance between the Empire and the Franks against the Lombards, a coalition agreed to by [[Guntram]] in about 571.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLRE3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HW290&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WP99&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jarnut 1995, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Alboin is generally thought not to have been behind this invasion, but an alternative interpretation of the transalpine raids presented by Gian Piero Bognetti is that Alboin may actually have been involved in the offensive on Guntram as part of an alliance with the Frankish king of [[Austrasia]], [[Sigebert I]]. This view is met with scepticism by scholars such as [[Christopher Wickham|Chris Wickham]].&lt;ref&gt;Wickham 1989, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

The weakening of royal authority may also have resulted in the conquest of much of southern Italy by the Lombards, in which modern scholars believe Alboin played no role at all, probably taking place in 570 or 571 under the auspices of individual warlords. However it is far from certain that the Lombard takeover occurred during those years, as very little is known of [[Faroald I of Spoleto|Faroald]] and Zotto's respective rise to power in [[Duchy of Spoleto|Spoletium]] ([[Spoleto]]) and [[Duchy of Benevento|Beneventum]] ([[Benevento]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;WP99&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmieri 1996, pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moorhead 2005, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christie 1998, pp. 80–82&lt;/ref&gt;

When he died she went off with the slave but they were overtaken and put to death together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory 1916, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;
|-

|}

Ticinum eventually fell to the Lombards in either May or June 572. Alboin had in the meantime chosen Verona as his seat, establishing himself and his treasure in a royal palace built there by Theodoric. This choice may have been another attempt to link himself with the Gothic king.&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt;

It was in this palace that Alboin was killed on June 28, 572. In the account given by Paul the Deacon, the most detailed narrative on Alboin's death, history and saga intermingle almost inextricably. Much earlier and shorter is the story told by [[Marius Aventicensis|Marius of Aventicum]] in his ''Chronica'', written about a decade after Alboin's murder. According to his version the king was killed in a conspiracy by a man close to him, called [[Helmichis|Hilmegis]] (Paul's Helmechis),&lt;ref&gt;Martindale 1992, ''s.v. Hilmegis'', p. 599&lt;/ref&gt; with the connivance of the queen. Helmichis then married the widow, but the two were forced to escape to Byzantine Ravenna, taking with them the royal treasure and part of the army, which hints at the cooperation of Byzantium. [[Roger Collins]] describes Marius as an especially reliable source because of his early date and his having lived close to Lombard Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLRE3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins 1991, pp. 187–188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jarnut 1995, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Also contemporary is [[Gregory of Tours]]' account presented in the ''Historia Francorum'', and echoed by the later [[Chronicle of Fredegar|Fredegar]]. Gregory's account diverges in several respects from most other sources. In his tale it is told how Alboin married the daughter of a man he had slain, and how she waited for a suitable occasion for revenge, eventually poisoning him. She had previously fallen in love with one of her husband's servants, and after the assassination tried to escape with him, but they were captured and killed. However, historians including Walter Goffart place little trust in this narrative. Goffart notes other similar doubtful stories in the ''Historia'' and calls its account of Alboin's demise &quot;a suitably ironic tale of the doings of depraved humanity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WG392&quot;&gt;Goffart 1988, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skull cup ===
Elements present in Marius' account are echoed in Paul's ''[[Historia Langobardorum]]'', which also contains distinctive features. One of the best known aspects unavailable in any other source is that of the [[skull cup]]. In Paul the events that lead to Alboin's downfall unfold in Verona. During a great feast Alboin gets drunk and orders his wife Rosamund to drink from his cup, made from the skull of his father-in-law Cunimund after he had slain him in 567 and married Rosamund. Alboin &quot;invited her to drink merrily with her father&quot;, and this reignited the queen's determination to avenge her father.&lt;ref name=&quot;HS84&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SG1921&quot;&gt;Gasparri 1990, pp. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HW291&quot;&gt;Wolfram 1997, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WG391392&quot;&gt;Goffart 1988, pp. 391–392&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:School of Rubens - Alboin and Rosamunde.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of a banquet with many participants in which a bearded man points to a woman with a cup while a seated woman looks the scene|The fatal banquet as painted by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] in 1615]]

The tale has been often dismissed as a fable, and Paul was conscious of the risk of disbelief. For this reason he insists that he saw the skull cup personally during the 740s in the royal palace of Ticinum in the hands of king [[Ratchis]]. The use of skull cups has been noticed among nomadic peoples, and in particular among the Lombards' neighbours, the Avars. Skull cups are believed to be part of a [[shamanism|shamanistic]] ritual, where drinking from the cup was considered a way to assume the dead man's powers. In this context, Stefano Gasparri and Wilfried Menghen see in Cunimund's skull cup the sign of nomadic cultural influences on the Lombards: by drinking from his enemy's skull Alboin was taking his vital strength. As for the offering of the skull to Rosamund, that may have been a ritual request of complete submission of the queen and her people to the Lombards, and thus a cause of shame or humiliation. Alternatively, it may have been a rite to appease the dead through the offering of a libation. In the latter interpretation, the queen's answer reveals her determination not to let the wound opened by the killing of her father be healed through a ritual act, thus openly displaying her thirst for revenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;HS84&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SG1921&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WG391392&quot;/&gt;

The episode is read in a radically different way by Walter Goffart. According to him, the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of the downfall of the hero and his expulsion from the [[Promised Land]], because of his human weakness. In this story, the skull cup plays a key role as it unites [[original sin]] and barbarism. Goffart does not exclude the possibility that Paul had really seen the skull, but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established.&lt;ref name=&quot;HS84&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WG391392&quot;/&gt;

=== Death ===
[[File:Assassination of Alboin.jpg|thumb|alt=A painting with two men and a woman, in which one man pointing a spear against the other one who is holding a stooge, with the women is holding a sword|Alboin is killed by Peredeo while Rosamund steals his sword, in a 19th-century painting by [[Charles Landseer]]]]

In her plan to kill her husband she found an ally in Helmichis, the king's foster brother and ''[[spatharios|spatharius]]'' (arms bearer). According to Paul the queen then recruited the king's ''[[cubicularius]]'' (bedchamberlain), Peredeo, into the plot, after having seduced him. When Alboin retired for his midday rest on June 28, care was taken to leave the door open and unguarded. Alboin's sword was also removed, leaving him defenceless when Peredeo entered his room and killed him.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLRE3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HW291&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JJ32&quot;&gt;Jarnut 1995, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Alboin's remains were allegedly buried beneath the palace steps.&lt;ref name=&quot;WG392&quot;/&gt;

Peredeo's figure and role is mostly introduced by Paul; the ''Origo'' had for the first time mentioned his name as &quot;Peritheus&quot;, but there his role had been different, as he was not the assassin, but the instigator of the assassination. In the vein of his reading of the skull cup, Goffart sees Peredeo as not as a historical figure but as an allegorical character: he notes a similarity between Peredeo's name and the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''peritus'', meaning &quot;lost&quot;, a representation of those Lombards who entered into the service of the Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;WG393&quot;&gt;Goffart 1988, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;

Alboin's death had a lasting impact, as it deprived the Lombards of the only leader they had that could have kept together the newborn Germanic entity. His end also represents the death of the last of the line of the hero-kings that had led the Lombards through their migrations from the Elba to Italy. His fame survived him for many centuries in epic poetry, with Saxons and [[History of Bavaria|Bavarian]]s celebrating his prowess in battle, his heroism, and the magical properties of his weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SG20&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram 1997, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

| style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; | &quot;Helmegis then, upon the death of his king, attempted to usurp his kingdom, but he could not at all do this, because the Langobards, grieving greatly for the king's death, strove to make way with him. And straightway Rosemund sent word to Longinus, prefect of Ravenna, that he should quickly send a ship to fetch them. Longinus, delighted by such a message, speedily sent a ship in which Helmegis with Rosemund his wife embarked, fleeing at night.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paul 1907, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

To complete the [[coup d'état]] and legitimize his claim to the throne, Helmichis married the queen, whose high standing arose not only from being the king's widow but also from being the most prominent member of the remaining Gepid nation, and as such her support was a guarantee of the Gepids' loyalty to Helmichis. The latter could also count on the support of the Lombard garrison of Verona, where many may have opposed Alboin's aggressive policy and could have cultivated the hope of reaching an entente with the Empire. The Byzantines were almost certainly deeply involved in the plot. It was in their interest to stem the Lombard tide by bringing a pro-Byzantine regime into power in Verona, and possibly in the long run break the unity of the Lombards' kingdom, winning over the dukes with honors and emoluments.&lt;ref name=&quot;DBI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SG26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JJ32&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NC82&quot;&gt;Christie 1998, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HW292&quot;&gt;Wolfram 1997, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Azzara 2009, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

The coup ultimately failed, as it met with the resistance of most of the warriors, who were opposed to the king's assassination. As a result, the Lombard garrison in Ticinum proclaimed Duke [[Cleph]] the new king, and Helmichis, rather than going to war against overwhelming odds, escaped to Ravenna with Longinus' assistance, taking with him his wife, his troops, the royal treasure and Alboin's daughter [[Albsuinda]]. In Ravenna the two lovers became estranged and killed each other. Subsequently Longinus sent Albsuinda and the treasure to [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NC82&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HW292&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Alboin's Italy.gif|thumb|upright|alt=A map of Italy divided in orange and green colors, with a green blot for &quot;Longobard&quot; an orange one for &quot;Byzantine&quot;|Lombard and Byzantine territories at Alboin's death]]

Cleph kept the throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a [[Slavery in medieval Europe|slave]]. Possibly he too was killed at the instigation of the Byzantines, who had every interest in avoiding an hostile and solid leadership among the Lombards. An important success for the Byzantines was that no king was proclaimed to succeed Cleph, opening a [[Rule of the Dukes|decade of interregnum]], thus making them more vulnerable to attacks from Franks and Byzantines. It was only when faced with the danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the dukes elected a new king in the person of [[Authari]], son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom while the remaining imperial territories were reorganized under the control of an [[exarchate of Ravenna|exarch]] in Ravenna with the capacity to defend the country without the Emperor's assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Schutz 2001, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gasparri 1990, pp. 26–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wickham 1989, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ostrogorsky 1993, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The consolidation of Byzantine and Lombard dominions had long-lasting consequences for Italy, as the region was from that moment on fragmented among multiple rulers until [[Italian unification]] in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham 2005, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Afonso de Albuquerque'''[[#References|&lt;sup&gt;[p][n]&lt;/sup&gt;]] (or archaically spelt as '''Aphonso d'Albuquerque''' and also spelt as '''Affonso''', '''Alfonso''', and '''Alphonso'''; {{IPA-pt|ɐˈfõsu dɨ aɫbuˈkɛɾk}}; 1453{{ndash}}December 16, 1515) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ''[[fidalgo]]'', or nobleman, an admiral whose military and administrative activities as [[List of colonial heads of Portuguese India|second governor]] of Portuguese India conquered and established  the [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese colonial empire]] in the Indian Ocean.

He was responsible for building numerous fortresses to defend key strategic positions and establishing a net of diplomatic relations. Shortly before his death he was awarded [[viceroy]] and &quot;Duke of Goa&quot; by king [[Manuel I of Portugal]], becoming the first Portuguese duke not from the royal family, and the first Portuguese title landed overseas. For some time he was known as ''The Terrible'', ''The Great'', ''The Caesar of the East'', ''Lion of the Seas'' and as ''The Portuguese Mars''.

==Early life==
Afonso de Albuquerque was born in 1453 in [[Vila Franca de Xira|Alhandra]], near [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |coauthors=Robert Crowley &amp; Geoffrey Parker |title=Albuquerque, Afonso de | work=The Reader's Companion to Military History | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | date=December 1, 1996 | accessdate=2006-10-20  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the second son of Gonçalo de Albuquerque, Lord of Vila Verde dos Francos and Dona Leonor de Menezes. His father held an important position at court and was connected by remote illegitimate descent with the Portuguese monarchy. He was educated in mathematics and Latin at the court of [[Afonso V of Portugal]], where he befriended Prince John, future king [[John II of Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;Morse Stephens, &quot;Albuquerque&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 
He served ten years in [[North Africa]], where he acquired military experience. In 1471, under the command of Afonso V, he was present at the conquest of [[Tangier]] and [[Arzila]] in [[Morocco]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclop&amp;aelig;dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/13157/Afonso-de-Albuquerque |title=Afonso de Albuquerque - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving there as an officer for some years. In 1476 he accompanied Prince John in wars against Castile, such as the [[Battle of Toro]]. He was in the squadron sent to the Italian Peninsula in 1480 to rescue [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]  from the [[Ottoman invasion of Otranto]] that ended in a Christian victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01270c.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Afonzo de Albuquerque |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return in 1481, when Prince John was crowned,  Albuquerque was appointed  chief [[equerry]] (''estribeiro-mor'') to the king. In 1489 he returned to service in North Africa, as commander of defense in the fortress of Graciosa, an island in the river Luco near the city of [[Larache]], and in 1490 was part of the guard of King John II, returning to Arzila in 1495 where his younger brother Martim died fighting by his side.

=== First Expedition to India, 1503 ===
{{main|5th Portuguese India Armada (Albuquerque, 1503)}}

When king [[Manuel I of Portugal]] was enthroned he showed some reticence towards Albuquerque, a close friend of his dreaded predecessor John II, and seventeen years his senior. Eight years later, on April 6 of 1503, after a long military career and at a mature age, Afonso de Albuquerque was sent on his first expedition to [[India]] with his cousin [[Francisco de Albuquerque]]. Each commanded three ships, sailing along with [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] and [[Nicolau Coelho]]. They participated in several battles against the forces of the [[Zamorin]] of [[Calicut]] (''Calecute'',Kozhikode) and succeeded in establishing the [[Kingdom of Cochin|king]] of [[Kochi, India|Cohin]] (''Cohim'', Kochi) securely on his throne. In return, the King gave them permission to build a Portuguese [[fort Kochi|fort at Cochin]] and establish trade relations with [[Quilon]] (''Coulão'', Kollam). This laid the foundation of the Portugal's empire in the East.

=== Second Expedition to India, 1506 ===

Albuquerque returned home in July 1504, and was well received by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]]. After Albuquerque assisted with the creation of a strategy for the Portuguese efforts in the east, King Manuel entrusted him with the command of a squadron of five vessels in the fleet of sixteen sailing for [[India]] in early 1506 headed by [[Tristão da Cunha]]. Their aim was to conquer [[Socotra]] and build a fortress there, hoping to close the trade in the Red Sea. Albuquerque went as chief-captain for the &quot;[[Arabian Peninsula|Coast of Arabia]]&quot; sailing under command of da Cunha until reaching Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;Diogo do Couto, &quot;Décadas da Ásia&quot;, década X, livro I&lt;/ref&gt; He carried a sealed letter with a secret mission ordered by the king: after fulfilling the first mission he should replace the first Viceroy of India, [[Francisco de Almeida]], whose term ended two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Foundations of the Portuguese empire, 1415-1580, p. 239, Bailey Wallys Diffie, Boyd C. Shafer, George Davison Winius&lt;/ref&gt; Before departing he legitimated a natural son born in 1500 and made his will.

==== Socotra and Hormuz first conquest, 1507====
{{main|Capture of Ormuz (1507)}}
The fleet left Lisbon on April 6, 1506.  Albuquerque piloted his ship himself, having lost his appointed pilot on departure. In [[Juan de Nova Island|Mozambique Channel]] they rescued captain [[João da Nova]] who joined his ship [[Frol de la mar]] to the fleet, having been stranded on his return from India.&lt;ref&gt;Albuquerque, Braz de (1774).

Those included priest João Gomes, João Sanches and Tunisian Sid Mohammed who, having failed to cross the region, headed for Socotra from where Albuquerque managed to land them in [[Cape Guardafui|Filuk]].&lt;ref&gt;J.

[[File:Portuguese Castle (Hormuz).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Fort of Our Lady of the Conception in Hormoz island|Fort of Our Lady of the Conception]], [[Hormuz Island]], [[Iran]]]]
From Socotra their ways parted: Tristão da Cunha sailed for India, where he would relieve the Portuguese [[Siege of Cannanore (1507)|sieged at Cannanore]], and Albuquerque sailed with a fleet of seven ships and five hundred men in an unrequested advance towards [[Ormuz]] in the [[Persian Gulf]], one of the eastern chief centers of commerce. On this route he conquered the cities of Curiati (Kuryat), [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] in July 1507 and [[Khor Fakkan]], accepting the submission of the cities of Kalhat and [[Sohar]]. On September 25 they arrived with a fearsome reputation at Ormuz and soon [[Capture of Ormuz (1507)|captured the city]], which agreed to become a tributary state for the Portuguese king. Few days later, the king of Ormuz was met by an envoy demanding the payment of tribute to shah [[Ismail I]] from [[Persia]]. He was sent back with the answer that the only tribute would be in canon-balls and guns, thus beginning the connection between Albuquerque and Shah Ismail I (often named Xeque Ismael).&lt;ref&gt;Molesworth Sykes,[http://books.google.com/books?id=wiAZyeSKKWwC&amp;lpg=PA271&amp;dq=ormuz%201507%20Albuquerque%20ismail&amp;pg=PA271#v=onepage&amp;q=ormuz%201507%20Albuquerque%20ismail&amp;f=false &quot;A History of Persia&quot;], p.271, READ BOOKS, 2006, ISBN 1406726923&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Brás de Albuquerque it was Xeque Ismael who coined the term &quot;Lion of the seas&quot; for Albuquerque&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately Albuquerque began building the [[Fort of Our Lady of the Conception in Hormoz island|Fort of Our Lady of Victory]] (later renamed Fort of Our Lady of the Conception).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Laraine Newhouse |last=Carter |title=Persian Gulf States: Chapter 1B.

However, some of his officers revolted against the heavy works and climate, and claiming that Albuquerque was exceeding his orders departed for India. With the fleet reduced to only two ships and left without supplies he was unable to maintain this position for long. Forced to abandon Ormuz in January 1508, he raided coastal villages to resupply the settlement of Socotra, returned to Ormuz and only then headed to India.

====Arrested at Cannanore, 1509====
Albuquerque arrived at [[Cannanore]] on the [[Malabarian Coast|Malabar coast]] in December 1508, where he immediately opened before the viceroy Dom [[Francisco de Almeida]] the sealed letter he had received from the king, appointing him governor.&lt;ref&gt;Afonso de Albuquerque, like many others since then, took office as Governor: when appointing the Viceroy Francisco de Almeida, the king promised not to appoint another in his lifetime, a vote of confidence in contradiction with the short term of three years he gave him, that may be due to the great fears about the sharing of power that this position represented. See ''Foundations of the Portuguese Empire'', 1415-1580, p. 239, Por Bailey Wallys Diffie, Boyd C. 239, by Bailey Wallys Diffie, Boyd C. Shafer, George Davison Winius Shafer, George Davison Winius&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the first months of 1508 the son of D. Francisco de Almeida, [[Lourenço de Almeida]], died in dramatic circumstances at the [[Battle of Chaul]] and there are reports that the viceroy, an enlightened and incorruptible ruler, turned vindictive and cruel.&lt;/ref&gt;  The viceroy, then joined by the officers who had defeated Albuquerque in Ormuz, had a matching royal order, but refused to hand government, protesting that his term ended only in January and stating his intention to avenge his son's death by fighting the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|mameluk]] fleet of [[Mirocem]], refusing Albuquerque's offer to fight him himself. Afonso de Albuquerque obeyed without confronting D. Francisco de Almeida - which could have led to civil war - and moved to [[Kochi, India|Kochi]], pending on indications from the kingdom, supporting and housing his entourage himself. He was described by [[Fernão Lopes de Castanheda]] as patiently enduring an open opposition from the group that had gathered around D. Francisco de Almeida, with whom he kept formal contacts. Increasingly ostracized, he wrote to [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]], who was arriving with a new fleet to India, but was ignored as Sequeira joined the Viceroy. At the same time Albuquerque refused approaches from opponents of the viceroy, who challenged him to take power.&lt;ref&gt;Castanheda, Fernão Lopes de, &quot;[http://books.google.com.br/books?id=kcMNAAAAYAAJ&amp;hl=pt-PT História do descobrimento e conquista da Índia pelos portugueses]&quot; (Full text).&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 3, 1509 Almeida fought the naval [[Battle of Diu]] against a joint fleet of [[Burji dynasty|Mamluks]], [[Ottomans]], the [[zamorin]] of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the [[Mahmud Begada|sultan of Gujarat]], taking it as personal revenge for the death of his son [[Lourenço de Almeida]] at the [[Battle of Chaul]]. His victory was decisive: Ottomans and Mamluks left the waters of the Indian Ocean, easing the Portuguese rule for over 100 years. In August, after a petition from Albuquerque's former officers with the support of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira considering him unfit for governance, he was sent in custody in an old ship to [[St. Angelo Fort]] in [[Cannanore]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Morse Stephens, &quot;Albuquerque&quot;, p.61-62, ISBN 8120615247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.S. Whiteway, &quot;Rise of Portuguese Power in India, 1497-1550&quot; p.126, ISBN 8120605004&lt;/ref&gt; There he remained isolated, in what he considered to be under prison. In September 1509 Sequeira advanced the mission of establishing contact with the Sultan of [[Malacca]] but failed, leaving behind 19 Portuguese prisoners.

== Governor of Portuguese India, 1509-1515==
Albuquerque was released after three months' confinement, on the arrival at Cannanore of the grand-marshal of Portugal with a large fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ricardo Bonalume |last=Neto |title=Lightning rod of Portuguese India | work=MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History | publisher=Cowles Enthusiast Media Spring | date=2002-04-01 | accessdate=2006-10-20 |page=68  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the most important Portuguese noble ever to visit India and he brought an armada of fifteen ships and 3,000 men sent by the king to defend the rights of Albuquerque and take [[Calicut]].&lt;ref&gt;Neto, Ricardo Bonalume. .

In 4 November 1509 Albuquerque became the second Governor of the ''State of India'', a position he would hold until his death. Almeida having returned home in 1510,&lt;ref&gt;Almeida returned to Portugal five days later, but died in a skirmish with the [[Khoikhoi]] near the [[Cape of Good Hope]].&lt;/ref&gt; he speedily showed the energy and determination of his character.&lt;ref name=Andaya&gt;Andaya, Barbara Watson and Leonard Y. Andaya. (1984) ''A History of Malaysia'' &quot;Palgrave&quot; 376 pages. ISBN 0-312-38121-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Albuquerque intended to dominate the Muslim world and control the [[Spice trade|spices' trading network]].&lt;ref name=Andaya /&gt; 
Initially king Manuel I and his council in Lisbon tried to distribute the power, creating three areas of jurisdiction in the Indian Ocean:&lt;ref&gt;Foundations of the Portuguese empire, 1415-1580, p. 245-247, Diffie, Winius&lt;/ref&gt; in 1509 the nobleman [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]] was fitted with a fleet and sent to Southeast Asia, with the task of seeking an agreement with [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]] of [[Malacca]], but failed and went back to the kingdom. To Jorge de Aguiar was given the area between the Cape of Good Hope and Gujarat, he was succeeded by Duarte de Lemos but left to Cochin and then for the kingdom, leaving his fleet to Albuquerque.

===Conquest of Goa, 1510===
In January 1510, fulfilling the orders from the kingdom, and knowing of the absence of [[Zamorin]], Albuquerque advanced to [[Calicut]] (now [[Kozhikode]]). But he had to retreat after the Marshall D. Fernando Coutinho, against his warnings, ventured in the inner city fascinated by its richness, and suffered an ambush. To help him, Afonso de Albuquerque received a severe wound and had to retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Foundations of the Portuguese empire, 1415-1580, p. 247, Diffie, Winius&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the failed attack on Calicut, Albuquerque hastened to form a powerful fleet of twenty-three ships and 1200 men. Contemporary reports state that he wanted to fight the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egyptian Mameluke Sultanate]] fleet in the Red Sea or return to Hormuz. However, he had been reported by [[Timoji]] (a privateer in the service of the Hindu [[Vijayanagara Empire]]) that it would be easier to fight them in [[Goa]], where they had sheltered after the Battle of Diu,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bhagamandala Seetharama Shastry p. 34-36&quot;&gt;Bhagamandala Seetharama Shastry, Charles J. Borges, &quot;Goa-Kanara Portuguese relations, 1498-1763&quot; p. 34-36&lt;/ref&gt;  and also of the illness of the Sultan [[Yusuf Adil Shah]] and war between the [[Deccan sultanates]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhagamandala Seetharama Shastry, Charles J. Borges, &quot;Goa-Kanara Portuguese relations, 1498-1763&quot; p. Borges, &quot;Goa-Kanara Portuguese relations, 1498-1763&quot; p. 34-36 34-36&lt;/ref&gt; So he invested by surprise in the capture of Goa to the [[Sultanate of Bijapur]]. He thus completed another mission, for Portugal wanted not to be seen as an eternal &quot;guest&quot; of Kochi and had been coveting Goa as the best trading port in the region.

A first assault took place in [[Goa]] from March 4 to May 20, 1510. After a first occupation, feeling unable to handle the city - given the poor condition of its fortifications, the cooling of Hindu population support and insubordination among his rank, after a severe attack of [[Ismail Adil Shah]] - Afonso de Albuquerque refused an agreement peace by the sultan and abandoned the city in August. His fleet was shattered and a palace revolt in Kochi hindered his recovery, so he headed to [[Fort Anjediva]]. When new ships arrived from the kingdom they were intended to Malacca, for nobleman Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos, who had been given a rival command of the region.

Only three months later, on November 25, Albuquerque reappeared in Goa with a fleet fully renovated, Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos vexed by his side with the reinforcements of Malacca&lt;ref&gt;Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415-1580, p. 253, Diffie, Winius 253, Diffie, Winius&lt;/ref&gt; and about 300 Malabari reinforcements from Cannanore. In less than a day they took possession of Goa from Ismail Adil Shah and his Ottoman allies, who surrendered on 10 December. It is estimated that 6000 of the 9000 Muslim defenders of the city died, either on the fierce battle in the streets or drowned while trying to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Robert (1824)&lt;/ref&gt; Albuquerque regained the support of the Hindu population, although frustrating the initial expectations of Timoja, who aspired to become governor. Afonso de Albuquerque rewarded him by appointing him chief &quot;[[Aguazil]]&quot; of the city, an administrator and representative of the Hindu and Muslim people, as a knowing interpreter of the local customs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bhagamandala Seetharama Shastry p. 34-36&quot;/&gt; He then made an agreement to lower yearly dues. 

In Goa Albuquerque started the first Portuguese [[Mint (coin)|mint]] in the East, after complaints from merchants and Timoja about the scarcity of currency, taking it as an opportunity to announce the territorial conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Teotonio R.

In spite of constant attacks, Goa became the center of Portuguese India, with the conquest triggering the compliance of neighboring kingdoms: the [[Sultan of Gujarat]] and the [[Zamorin]] of Calicut sent embassies, offering alliances and local grants to fortify.

===Conquest of Malacca, 1511===
{{main|Capture of Malacca (1511)}}
[[File:A famosa.jpg|thumb|The surviving gate of the [[A Famosa]] Portuguese fortress in [[Malacca]].]]
In February 1511, through a friendly Hindu merchant called Nina Chatu, Albuquerque received a letter from Rui de Araújo, one of the nineteen Portuguese arrested at Malacca since 1509. It urged moving forward with the largest possible fleet to demand their liberation, and gave details about the procedures. Albuquerque showed it to Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos, as an argument to advance in a joint fleet. In April 1511, after fortifying Goa, he gathered a force of about 900 Portuguese, 200 Hindu mercenaries and about eighteen ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp23&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition  | publisher =MacMillan  | year =1991  | location =London  | page =23  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 0-333-57689-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then set sail from Goa to [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]], against the orders of the kingdom and under the protest of Diogo Mendes, who claimed the command of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Afonso de Albuquerque  eventually centralized the Portuguese government in the Indian Ocean. After the conquest of Malacca he wrote a letter to the King where the reported disagreement with Diogo Mendes, suggesting that further divisions could be harmful to the Portuguese in India see &quot;Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415-1580, p. 255, Diffie, Winius &quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Under his orders was [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who had participated in the failed embassy of [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]] in 1509.

After a false start towards the Red Sea, they sailed to the Strait of Malacca. It was the richest city that the Portuguese tried to take, and the most important east point in the trade network where Malay traders met Gujarati, Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Bengali, Persian and Arabic, among others, described by [[Tomé Pires]] as of invaluable richness. Despite its wealth, it was mostly a wooden built city, with few masonry buildings. On the other hand it was defended by a powerful army of mercenaries and artillery, estimated at 20,000 men and more than 2000 pieces. Its greatest weakness being the unpopularity of the government of [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]], who favored Muslims producing dissatisfaction within other merchants. 

Albuquerque made a bold approach to the city, his ships decorated with banners, firing cannon volleys. He declared himself lord of all the navigation, demanding the Sultan to release the prisoners, pay for the damage, and asking to build a fortified trading post. The Sultan eventually freed the prisoners, but wasn't impressed by the small Portuguese contingent. Albuquerque then burned some ships at the port and four coastal buildings, to test the  response. The city being divided by the Malacca River, and connected by a bridge seen as a strategic point, on 25 July at dawn the Portuguese landed and fought in tough battle, facing poisoned arrows, taking the bridge in the evening. After waiting for the reaction of the sultan, they returned to the ships. As the sultan did not respond, they prepared a [[Junk (ship)|junk]] offered by Chinese merchants, filling it with men, artillery, sandbags. Commanded by [[António de Abreu]] it sailed the river at high tide onto the bridge, with success: the day after all had landed. Fighting fiercely, they broke down the barricades built in the meantime. Suddenly, the Sultan appeared, leading his army of war elephants to crush the invaders. Despite the surprise, one of the Portuguese, Fernão Gomes de Lemos, approached and spurred an animal with a spear, making him stand up and back. Other Portuguese emulated him and the front of elephants retreated in panic, overthrowing the army, and the sultan himself, wreaking havoc and dispersing it.&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius, Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580. p. 254-260&lt;/ref&gt; During a week Albuquerque rested his men and waited for the reaction of the Sultan. Merchants approached, asking for Portuguese protection. They were given flags to mark their premises, a sign that they would not be looted. On 24 August the Portuguese attacked again, but the Sultan had fled the city. Under firm orders they looted the city, respecting the flags, which still was a fabulous drawing.

Albuquerque remained in Malacca preparing its defences against any Malay counterattack,&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp23&quot;/&gt;  immediately building a fortress, distributing his men in shifts and using stones from the mosque and the cemetery. Despite the delays caused by heat and malaria, it was completed in November 1511, its surviving door known as &quot;[[A Famosa]]&quot; ( the famous). It was possibly then that Albuquerque had a large stone engraved with the names of the participants in the conquest. As quarrel rose about the order of the names, Albuquerque had it settled turned toward the wall, with the single inscription ''Lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes'' (latim for &quot;The stone the builders rejected&quot;, from prophecy of David, Psalm 118:22-23) in the front.&lt;ref&gt;Brás de Albuquerque, em [http://books.google.com/books?id=4UILAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Afonso%20de%20Albuquerque%20china&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false, Comentaries] places this episode in Malacca, although [[Gaspar Correia]] (Lendas da Índia) and [[João de Barros]] (Décadas) placed it in Goa&lt;/ref&gt;

He settled the Portuguese administration, re-appointing Rui de Araújo as [[factor (agent)|factor]], a post assigned previous his 1509 arrest, and appointing rich merchant Nina Chatu to replace the previous ''[[bendahara]]'', representative of the ''[[Kafir]]'' people and adviser. Besides assisting in the governance of the city and first Portuguese coinage, he also provided the junks for several diplomatic missions.&lt;ref&gt;Teotonio R. De Souza, [http://books.google.com/books?id=yjXJOFEIIMkC&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=Nina%20chatu%20Albuquerque&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=Nina%20chatu%20Albuquerque&amp;f=false &quot;Indo-Portuguese history: old issues, new questions&quot;], p. 60, Concept Publishing Company, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Albuquerque arrested and executed mercilessly powerful Javanese merchant Utimuti Raja who, after being appointed to a position in the Portuguese administration as representative of the Javanese population, maintained contacts with the exiled royal family

===Missions from Malacca===
====Embassies to Pegu, Sumatra and Siam, 1511====
Most Muslim and Gujarati merchants having fled the city, at the same time Albuquerque invested in diplomatic efforts demonstrating a wide generosity with the merchants in Southeast Asia, like the Chinese, hoping that they echoed the good relations with the Portuguese. Trade and diplomatic missions were sent to continental kingdoms: Rui Nunes da Cunha was sent to [[Pegu]] (Burma), from were king Binyaram sent back a friendly emissary to Kochi in 1514&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Teixeira, &quot;The Portuguese missions in Malacca and Singapore (1511-1958)&quot;, Agência Geral do Ultramar, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armando Cortesão, [http://books.google.com/books?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&amp;lpg=PR81&amp;dq=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;pg=PR81#v=onepage&amp;q=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;f=false ''The Suma Oriental of Tomé Pires: an account of the east, from the Red Sea to Japan, written in Malacca and India in 1512–1515/The Book of Francisco Rodrigues rutter of a voyage in the Red Sea, nautical rules, almanack and maps, written and drawn in the east before 1515''], The Hakluyt Society, 1944&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sumatra]], Sumatran kings of Kampar and Indragiri sending emissaries to Albuquerque accepting the new power, as vassal states of Malacca.&lt;ref&gt;Donald F.

Knowing of Siamese ambitions over Malacca, Albuquerque immediately sent [[Duarte Fernandes]] in a diplomatic mission to the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] (Thailand), traveling in a Chinese junk returning home. He was one of the former Portuguese arrested in Malacca, having gathered knowledge about the culture of the region. There he was the first European to arrive, establishing amicable relations between the kingdom of Portugal and the court of the King of Siam [[Ramathibodi II]], returning with a Siamese envoy with gifts and letters to Albuquerque and the king of Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Frederick Lach, Edwin J. Van Kley, &quot;Asia in the making of Europe&quot;, p.520-521, University of Chicago Press, 1994, ISBN 9780226467313&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expedition to the &quot;spice islands&quot; (Maluku islands), 1512====
[[File:Ternate.JPG|thumb| Depiction of [[Ternate]] with São João Baptista Fort, built in 1522.]]
In November, after having secured Malacca and learning the location of the then secret &quot;[[Maluku Islands|spice islands]]&quot;, Albuquerque sent an expedition of three ships sailing east to find them, led by trusted [[António de Abreu]] with the deputy commander [[Francisco Serrão]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp24&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition  | publisher =MacMillan  | year =1991  | location =London  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 0-333-57689-6  | page =24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] pilots were recruited to guide them through [[Java]], the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]] and the [[Ambon Island]] to [[Banda Islands]], where they arrived in early 1512.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milton 1999 5 and 7&quot;&gt;Hannard (1991), page 7; {{cite book  | last =Milton  | first =Giles  | authorlink =Giles Milton  | coauthors =  | title =Nathaniel's Nutmeg  | publisher =Sceptre  | year =1999  | location =London  | pages =5 and 7  | isbn = 978-0-340-69676-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Milton 1999 5 and 7&quot;/&gt; There they remained for about a month, buying and filling their ships with [[nutmeg]] and [[cloves]]. António de Abreu then sailed to Amboina whilst Serrão stepped forward to the Moluccas but was shipwrecked near Seram. [[Sultanate of Ternate|Sultan Abu Lais of Ternate]] heard of their stranding, and, seeing a chance to ally himself with a powerful foreign nation, brought them to Ternate in 1512 were they were permitted to build a fort on the island,  {{belg|Forte de São João Baptista de Ternate|pt|Forte de São João Baptista de Ternate}}, built in 1522.

====China expeditions, 1513====
In early 1513, [[Jorge Álvares]]— sailing in a mission under Albuquerque — was allowed to land at [[Lintin Island]] in the [[Pearl River Delta]] of southern [[China]], and soon after Albuquerque sent [[Rafael Perestrello]] to southern China to seek out trade relations with the [[Ming Dynasty]] of China. In ships from [[Portuguese Malacca]], Rafael sailed to Canton ([[Guangzhou]]) in 1513 and again from 1515–1516 to trade with Chinese merchants there. These ventures, along with those of [[Tomé Pires]] and [[Fernão Pires de Andrade]], were the first direct European diplomatic and commercial ties to China.&lt;ref&gt;However, after the death of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]] on April 19, 1521, conservative factions at court seeking to limit eunuch influence rejected the new Portuguese embassy, fought sea battles with the Portuguese around [[Tuen Mun]], and Tomé was forced to write letters to Malacca stating that he and other ambassadors would not be released from prison in China until the Portuguese relinquished their control of Malacca and returned it to the deposed [[Sultan of Malacca]] (who was previously a Ming tributary vassal). See Mote, Frederick W. and Denis Twitchett. (1998). ''The Cambridge History of China; Volume 7–8''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-24333-5 (Hardback edition). Page 340. Nonetheless, Portuguese relations with China became normalized again by the 1540s and in 1557 a permanent Portuguese base at [[Macau]] in southern China was established with consent from the Ming court.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shipwreck on the ''Flor de la mar'', 1511===
In 20 November 1511 Albuquerque sailed from Malacca to the coast of Malabar on board of the old ''[[Flor de la mar]]'' [[carrack]] that had served to support the conquest of Malacca. Despite already being deemed unsafe,  Afonso de Albuquerque used her to transport the treasure amassed in the conquest, given her large capacity:&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius (1977). ''Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580'', p.260&lt;/ref&gt;  he wanted to give the court of King Manuel I a show of Malaccan treasures. There were also the offers from the [[Kingdom of Siam]] (Thailand) to the king of Portugal and all his own fortune. On the voyage a storm arose and the ''[[Flor De La Mar]]'' was wrecked, and he himself barely escaped with his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp23&quot;/&gt; 

Albuquerque returned from Malacca to Kochi, but could not sail to Goa as it faced a serious revolt headed by the forces of [[Ismael Adil Shah]], the Sultan of [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Bijapur]], commanded by [[Rasul Khan]] with the help of some of his countrymen. While he was absent in Malacca, Portuguese who opposed the taking of Goa had waived the possession, even written to the king stating that it would be best to let it go. Prevented to sail by the monsoon and with few forces available, he had to wait for the arrival of reinforcement fleets headed by his nephew D. Garcia de Noronha and Jorge de Mello Pereira. 

On 10 September 1512, Albuquerque set sail from Cochin to Goa with fourteen ships carrying 1,700 soldiers. Determined to recapture the fortress, he ordered trenches to be dug and a wall to be breached. But on the very morning of the planned final assault, Rasul Khan surrendered. Albuquerque demanded the fort to be handed with all its artillery, ammunition and horses, and the deserters to be given up. Some had joined Rasul Khan when the Portuguese were forced to flee Goa in May 1510, others during the recent siege. Rasul Khan consented, on condition that their lives be spared. Albuquerque agreed and he left Goa. Albuquerque kept his word, but mutilated them horribly. One of such renegades was [[Fernão Lopez]], bound for Portugal in custody, who escaped at the island of Saint Helena leading a 'Robinson Crusoe' life for many years. After such measures the town became the most flourishing of the Portuguese settlements in India.

=== Return to the Red Sea, 1513===
In December 1512 an envoy from [[Ethiopia]] arrived at Goa. [[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Mateus]] was sent by regent queen [[Eleni of Ethiopia|Eleni]] following the arrival of the Portuguese from Socotra in 1507, as an ambassador for the king of Portugal in search of a coalition to help face growing Ottoman influence. He was received in Goa with great honor by Albuquerque, as a long sought &quot;[[Prester John]]&quot; envoy. His arrival was announced by king [[Manuel I of Portugal]] to [[Pope Leo X]] in 1513. Although Mateus faced the distrust of some of Albuquerque rivals, who tried to prove he was some impostor or Muslim spy, Albuquerque sent him to Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Millet Rogers, [http://books.google.com/books?id=lBh--X3QjnsC&amp;lpg=1 &quot;The quest for Eastern Christians: travels and rumor in the Age of Discovery&quot;, p. 134], U of Minnesota Press, 1962, ISBN 0816602751&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The king is described as having wept with joy at their view.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 1513, while Mateus was in Portugal, Albuquerque sailed to the [[Red Sea]] with a force of about 1000 Portuguese and 400 Malabaris. He was, from the start, under orders from the kingdom to secure that channel to Portugal. Barren Socotra had proved ineffective to control the Red Sea entrance and was abandoned, and Albuquerque's hint that [[Massawa]] could be a good Portuguese base may have been influenced by Mateus' reports.&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius (1977). [http://books.google.com/books?id=vtZtMBLJ7GgC&amp;lpg=1 ''Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580'', p.352]. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. ISBN 0816607826&lt;/ref&gt; 

Knowing that [[mameluks]] were preparing a second fleet at [[Suez]], he wanted to advance before reinforcements arrived to [[Aden]]. He accordingly laid siege to the city.&lt;ref&gt;By M. D. D. Newitt, [http://books.google.com/books?id=vpteLQcx6J4C&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=Albuquerque%20Aden%20Red%20sea&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q=Albuquerque%20Aden%20Red%20sea&amp;f=false &quot;A history of Portuguese overseas expansion, 1400-1668&quot;], p.87, Routledge, 2005, ISBN 0415239796&lt;/ref&gt; Aden was a fortified city, but although having scaling ladders they broke and after half day of fierce battle Albuquerque forces were forced to retreat. They cruised the Red Sea inside the [[Bab al-Mandab]], as the first European fleet to have sailed this waters. Albuquerque attempted to reach [[Jeddah]], but the winds were unfavorable and so sheltered at [[Kamaran]] island in May, until sickness among the men and lack of fresh water forced to retreat. In August 1513, after a second attempt to reach Aden, they returned to India with no substantial results. In order to destroy the power of [[Egypt]], Albuquerque is said to have entertained the idea of diverting the course of the [[Nile River]] and so rendering the whole country barren. Perhaps most tellingly, he intended to steal the body of the [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]], and hold it for ransom until all Muslims had left the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew James McGregor, &quot;A military history of modern Egypt: from the Ottoman Conquest to the Ramadan War&quot;, p.20, Greenwood Publishing Group, ISBN 9780275986018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Afonso Braz de Albuquerque, &quot;Commentaries of the Great Afonso Dalboquerque, Second Viceroy of India&quot;, Vol. 4 , Walter de Gray Birch (Translator), ISBN 9781402195082&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administration and diplomacy in Goa, 1514===
[[File:Dürer rhino full.png|thumb|left|[[Dürer's Rhinoceros]], [[woodcut]], 1515.]]
In [[1514]] Afonso de Albuquerque was devoted to the administration and diplomacy in Goa, concluding peace with Calicut and receiving embassies from Indian governors, strengthening the city and stimulating the marriage of Portuguese with local women. At that time, Portuguese women were barred from traveling overseas due to superstition about women on ships, as well as the substantial danger of the sea route. In 1511, the Portuguese government encouraged their explorers to marry local women, under a policy set by Albuquerque. To promote settlement, the King of Portugal granted freeman status and exemption from Crown taxes to Portuguese men (known as ''casados'', or &quot;married men&quot;) who ventured overseas and married local women. With Albuquerque's encouragement, mixed marriages flourished. He appointed local people for positions in the Portuguese administration and didn't interfere with local traditions, except the &quot;[[Sati (practice)|sati]]&quot;, the practice of immolating widows, which he forbade.

In March 1514 King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had sent to [[Pope Leo X]] a huge and exotic embassy led by [[Tristão da Cunha]], who toured the streets of Rome in a extravagant procession of animals from the colonies and wealth from the Indies that struck Europe. His reputation reached its peak, creating the foundation of the Portuguese Empire in the East. 
In early 1514, Afonso de Albuquerque had sent ambassadors to Sultan [[Muzafar II]], ruler of [[Cambay]], to seek permission to build a fort on [[Diu]].  The mission returned without an agreement, but diplomatic gifts were exchanged, including an [[Indian Rhinoceros|Indian rhinoceros]].&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, p.112.&lt;/ref&gt; Albuquerque forward the gift, named ''ganda'', and its Indian keeper, Ocem, to King Manuel I.&lt;ref name=&quot;lambe&quot;&gt;[http://www.artebr.com/lambelambe/historia.html História do famoso rhinocerus de Albrecht Dürer], Projecto Lambe-Lambe {{pt icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1515, the king sent it as a gift for [[Pope Leo X]], but it died in a shipwreck off the coast of [[Italy]] in early 1516. [[Germany|German]] [[Painting|painter]] [[Albrecht Dürer]], based on a written description and brief sketch by an unknown artist, created then is famous [[Dürer's Rhinoceros]] in 1515.&lt;ref&gt;Some sources erroneously say 1513, copying a typographical error made by Dürer in one of his original drawings and perpetuated in his woodcut.&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer never saw the actual rhinoceros, which was the first living example seen in Europe since [[Roman Empire|Roman times]].

=== Conquest of Ormuz and last days, 1515===
In 1513 at Cannanore Albuquerque was visited by a [[Persia]]n ambassador from shah [[Ismail I]], who had sent ambassadors to Gujarat, Ormuz and Bijapur. The [[shah]]'s ambassador to Bijapur visited Albuquerque inviting him to send back an envoy to Persia. Miguel Ferreira was sent via Ormuz to [[Tabriz]], were he had several interviews with the Shah about common goals on defeating the Mameluke sultan. 

Having returned with rich presents and an ambassador, on the journey back in March 1515 they were met by Albuquerque at [[Ormuz]], where he went to [[Capture of Ormuz (1507)|establish his rule]].&lt;ref&gt;John Holland Rose, Arthur Percival Newton, Ernest Alfred Benians, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Y-08AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=Albuquerque%20Aden%20Persia&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q=Albuquerque%20Aden%20Persia&amp;f=false &quot;The Cambridge history of the British empire, Volume 2&quot;, p. 12], CUP Archive, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; Fueled by the offers of the sha, Albuquerque had advanced in his desire to recapture Hormuz alone. He had learned that after the Portuguese retreat in 1507, a young king was reigning under the influence of a powerful Persian [[vizier]], Reis Hamed, which the king greatly feared. At Hormuz, Albuquerque had a parley with the king and asked the vizier to be present. He then had him immediately stabbed and killed by his entourage, thus &quot;freeing&quot; the frighted king so the island in the Persian Gulf yielded to him without resistance, and remained a Portuguese vassal state until 1622. There Albuquerque stood, engaging in diplomatic efforts and receiving envoys while becoming increasingly ill. In November 1515 he decided to return, but he didn't survived to land, having died off Goa.

====Political downfall====
Albuquerque's career had a painful and ignominious close. He had several enemies at the Portuguese court who lost no opportunity of stirring up the jealousy of King Manuel against him, insinuating that he intended to strike power in Portuguese India, and his own injudicious and arbitrary conduct on several occasions served their end only too well. 

On his return from Ormuz, at the entrance of the harbour of Goa, he got news about a fleet arriving from Europe bearing dispatches announcing that he was superseded by his personal enemy [[Lopo Soares de Albergaria]]. The blow was too much for him and he died at sea on December 16, 1515.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Rinehart |title=Portugal: Chapter 2B. The Expansion of Portugal | work=Countries of the World | publisher=Bureau Development, Inc. | date=January 1, 1991 | accessdate=2006-10-20  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his death Albuquerque dictated a letter to King Manuel I in dignified and affecting terms, vindicating his conduct and claiming for his [[natural son]] the honors and rewards that were justly due to himself.  

Albergaria had departed from Lisbon in 7 April 1515, along with Mateus and a returning embassy to Ethiopia. Yet in August, through contacts in Venice, King Manuel I learned that the Mamluk Sultan of Cairo had prepared a fleet at Suez with men and artillery to fight the Portuguese in India and, especially, in Hormuz. Fearing the effects and repented to have replaced Albuquerque, he immediately wrote to Albergaria to return the command of all operations to Albuquerque, and to provide him with resources so that he could fight the rival forces. However when the letter arrived, Albuquerque had already died.&lt;ref&gt;Albuquerque, Brás de (1774).

==Legacy==
[[Image:Monument to Afonso de Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|right|Albuquerque Monument on [[Afonso de Albuquerque Square]] in Lisbon (1902).]]
King Manuel I of Portugal was convinced too late of Albuquerque's loyalty, and endeavoured to atone for the ingratitude with which he had treated him by heaping honours upon his son, [[Brás de Albuquerque]] (1500—1580).,&lt;ref&gt;Stier, Hans Erich (1942) ''Die Welt als Geschichte: Zeitschrift für Universalgeschichte'' &quot;W. Kohlhammer&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; whom he renamed &quot;Afonso&quot; in memory of his father.  

Afonso de Albuquerque was a prolific writer, having written numerous letters to the king reporting all kind of matters during his governorship, from minor issues to major strategies. In 1557 his son  published a collection his letters under the title ''Commentarios do Grande Affonso d'Alboquerque''.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Jack D. (1993) ''Africans and Native Americans'' &quot;University of Illinois Press&quot;. 344 pages. ISBN 0-252-06321-X.&lt;/ref&gt;- a clear reference to [[Caesar's Commentaries]]- which he later reviewed and re-published in 1576. There Albuquerque was described as &quot;a man of middle stature, with a long face, fresh colored, the nose somewhat large. He was a prudent man, and a Latin scholar, and spoke in elegant phrases; his conversation and writings showed his excellent education. He was of ready words, very authoritative in his commands, very circumspect in his dealings with the Moors, and greatly feared yet greatly loved by all, a quality rarely found united in one captain. He was very valiant and favored by fortune.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Albuquerque, Brás, Commentaries, vol VI, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1572]] Albuquerque's feats were inscribed in ''[[The Lusiads]]'', the Portuguese main [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] by [[Luís de Camões|Luís Vaz de Camões]] (Canto X, strophe 40 to 49), were the poet praises his achievements but has the [[muses]] frown upon the harsh rule towards his own men, of whom Camões was almost a contemporary fellow. In 1934 Albuquerque was celebrated by [[Fernando Pessoa]] in ''Mensagem'', a symbolist epic. In the first part of this work, called &quot;Brasão&quot; (Coat-of-Arms), he relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields in the Portuguese coat-of-arms, Albuquerque being one of the wings of the [[griffin]] headed by Henry the navigator, the other wing being king John II. 

An exquisite and expensive variety of mango, that he used to bring on his journeys to India, has been named in his honour, and is today sold throughout the world as [[Alphonso (mango)|Alphonso mangoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Alphonso mangoes | work=Savani Farms | url=http://www.savanifarms.com/ | accessdate=2006-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his fame, the city of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] in New Mexico is not named after him.  It was named after a Spanish Viceroy of Mexico named Don [[Francisco Fernández de la Cueva]], who also held the title [[Duke of Alburquerque]].  There is, however, a town near the Spanish-Portuguese border named [[Alburquerque, Badajoz|Alburquerque]] which may be the root of both names.
Additionally, it is highly likely that one of the major thoroughfares in Malacca's Portuguese Settlement, Jalan D'Albuquerque, is named after Afonso de Albuquerque.

'''Alcaeus '''('''Alkaios''', Attic Greek Ἀλκαῖος) of [[Mytilene]] (c. 620 BC-6th century BC), [[Ancient Greek]] [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] poet who supposedly invented the [[Alcaic verse]].  He was included in the [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] list of [[nine lyric poets]] by the scholars of [[Hellenistic]] [[Alexandria]]. He was an older contemporary and an alleged lover of [[Sappho]], with whom he may have exchanged poems. He was born into the [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] governing [[Social class|class]] of [[Mytilene]], the main city of [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], where he was involved in political disputes and feuds.

lier Visconti.&quot; - J.Easby-Smith&lt;ref&gt;J.Easby-Smith, ''The Songs of Alcaeus'', W.H.Lowdermilk and Co. (1901) - digitalized by Google&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
[[Image:Pittakos.jpg|thumb|Pittacus]]
The broad outlines of the poet's life are well known.&lt;ref&gt;David Mulroy, ''Early Greek Lyric Poetry'', University of Michigan Press, 1992, pages 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David.A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classic Press, 1982, pages 285-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James S. Easby-Smith, ''The Songs of Alcaeus'', W.H.Lowdermilk and Co., Washington, 1901 [http://www.archive.org/stream/songsalcaeusmem00englgoog/songsalcaeusmem00englgoog_djvu.txt Digitalized version]&lt;/ref&gt; He was born into the aristocratic, warrior class that dominated Mytilene, the strongest city-state on the island of Lesbos and, by the end of the seventh century B.C., the most influential of all the Asiatic Greek cities, with a strong navy and colonies securing its trade-routes in the Hellespont. The city had long been ruled by kings born to the Penthilid clan but, during the poet's life, the Penthilids were a spent force and rival aristocrats and their factions contended with each other for supreme power. Alcaeus and his older brothers were passionately involved in the struggle but experienced little success. Their political adventures can be understood in terms of three tyrants who came and went in succession:
*Melanchrus - he was overthrown sometime between 612BC and 609 BC by a faction that, in addition to the brothers of Alcaeus, included [[Pittacus]] (later renowned as one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]); Alcaeus at that time was too young to be actively involved;
*Myrsilus - it is not known when he came to power but some verses by Alcaeus (frag. 129) indicate that the poet, his brothers and Pittacus made plans to overthrow him and that Pittacus subsequently betrayed them; Alcaeus and his brothers fled into exile where the poet later wrote a drinking song in celebration of the news of the tyrant's death (frag. 332);
*Pittacus - the dominant political figure of his time, he was voted supreme power by the political assembly of Mytilene and appears to have governed well (590-580 BC), even allowing Alcaeus and his faction to return home in peace.

Sometime before 600 BC, Mytilene fought Athens for control of [[Sigeion]] and Alcaeus was old enough to participate in the fighting. According to the historian [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;''Histories'' 5.95&lt;/ref&gt; the poet threw away his shield to make good his escape from the victorious Athenians then celebrated the occasion in a poem that he later sent to his friend, Melanippus.  It is thought that Alcaeus travelled widely during his years in exile, including at least one visit to Egypt. His older brother, Antimenidas, appears to have served as a mercenary in the army of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] and probably took part in the conquest of Judaea and the destruction of Jerusalem in 587 BC. Alcaeus wrote verses in celebration of Antimenides' return, including mention of his valour in slaying a Goliath-like opponent(frag. 350), and he proudly describes the military hardware that adorned their family home (frag. 357).
{{Quotation|&quot;Alcaeus was in some respects not unlike a Royalist soldier of the age of the Stuarts. He had the high spirit and reckless gaiety, the love of country bound up with belief in a caste, the licence tempered by generosity and sometimes by tenderness, of a cavalier who has seen good and evil days.&quot; - [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb]]&lt;ref&gt;R.C.Jebb, ''Greek Literature'', MacMillan and Co. 1878, page 59 [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=DbLHNxS6heMC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=alcaeus+%2B+fragments&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=alcaeus%20%2B%20fragments&amp;f=false Google preview]&lt;/ref&gt;}}  

Alcaeus was a contemporary and a countryman of [[Sappho]] and, since both poets composed for the entertainment of Mytilenean friends, they had many opportunities to associate with each other on a quite regular basis, such as at the ''Kallisteia'', an annual festival celebrating the island's federation under Mytilene, held at the 'Messon' (referred to as ''temenos'' in fr.s 129 and 130), where Sappho performed publicly with female choirs. Alcaeus' reference to Sappho in terms more typical of a divinity, as ''holy/pure, honey-smiling Sappho'' (fr. 384), may owe its inspiration to her performances at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Nagy, 'Lyric and Greek Myth' in ''The Cambridge Companion to Greek Mythology'', ed. R.D.Woodward, Cambridge University Press (2007), pages 19-51 [http://chs.harvard.edu/wa/pageR?tn=ArticleWrapper&amp;bdc=12&amp;mn=2654 Digitalized version]&lt;/ref&gt; The Lesbian or Aeolic school of poetry &quot;reached in the songs of Sappho and Alcaeus that high point of brilliancy to which it never after-wards approached&quot;&lt;ref&gt;James S. Easby-Smith, ''The Songs of Alcaeus'', W.H.Lowdermilk and Co., Washington, 1901,&lt;/ref&gt; and it was assumed by later Greek critics and during the early centuries of the Christian era that the two poets were in fact lovers, a theme which became a favourite subject in art (as in the urn pictured above).

==Poetry==
The poetic works of Alcaeus were collected into ten books, with elaborate commentaries, by the Alexandrian scholars [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] sometime in the 3rd century BC, and yet his verses today exist only in fragmentary form, varying in size from mere phrases, such as ''wine, window into a man'' (fr.333) to entire groups of verses and stanzas, such as those quoted below (fr.346). Alexandrian scholars numbered him in their [[Nine lyric poets|canonic nine]] (one lyric poet per Muse). Among these, [[Pindar]] was held by many ancient critics to be pre-eminent,&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintilian]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/10A*.html#1.61 10.1.61]; cf. [[Longinus (literature)|Pseudo-Longinus]] [http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/longinus/desub011.htm#xxxiii 33.5].&lt;/ref&gt; but some gave precedence to Alcaeus instead.&lt;ref&gt;James Easby-Smith, ''The Songs of Alcaeus'' (digitalized without page numbers)&lt;/ref&gt; The canonic nine are traditionally divided into two groups, with Alcaeus, Sappho and [[Anacreon]], being 'monodists' or 'solo-singers', with the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;Andrew M.Miller (trans.), ''Greek Lyric: an anthology in translation'', Hackett Publishing Co. (1996), Intro. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;
*they composed and performed personally for friends and associates on topics of immediate interest to them;
*they wrote in their nativee dialects (Alcaeus and Sappho in Aeolic dialect, Anacreon in Ionic);
*they preferred quite short, metrically simple stanzas or 'strophes' which they re-used in many poems - hence the 'Alcaic' and 'Sapphic' stanzas, named after the two poets who perfected them or possibly invented them.
The other six of the canonic nine composed verses for public occasions, performed by choruses and professional singers and typically featuring complex metrical arrangements that were never reproduced in other verses. However, this division into two groups is considered by some modern scholars to be too simplistic and often it is practically impossible to know whether a lyric composition was sung or recited, or whether or not it was accompanied by musical instruments and dance. Even the private reflections of Alcaeus, ostensibly sung at dinner parties, still retain a public function.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Nagy, 'Lyric and Greek Myth' in ''The Cambridge Companion to Greek Mythology'', ed. R.D.Woodward, Cambridge University Press (2007), pages 19-51&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critics often seek to understand Alcaeus in comparison with Sappho:
{{Quotation|If we compare the two, we find that Alcaeus is versatile, Sappho narrow in her range; that his verse is less polished and less melodious than hers; and that the emotions which he chooses to display are less intense. - David Campbell&lt;ref&gt;David A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982) page 287&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{Quotation|The Aeolian song is suddenly revealed, as a mature work of art, in the spirited stanzas of Alcaeus. It is raised to a supreme excellence by his younger contemporary, Sappho, whose melody is unsurpassed, perhaps unequalled, among all the relics of Greek verse. - Richard Jebb &lt;ref&gt;Richard Jebb, ''Bacchylides: the poems and fragments'', Cambridge University Press 1905, page 29 ([http://www.archive.org/stream/bacchylidespoem00jebbgoog#page/n9/mode/1up digitalized Google)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{Quotation|In the variety of his subjects, in the exquisite rhythm of his meters, and in the faultless perfection of his style, all of which appear even in mutilated fragments, he excells all the poets, even his more intense, more delicate and more truly inspired contemporary Sappho. - James Easby-Smith&lt;ref&gt;James Easby-Smith, ''The Songs of Alcaeus'' (digitalized without page numbers)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The Roman poet, Horace, also compared the two, describing Alcaeus as &quot;more full-throatedly singing&quot; &lt;ref&gt;James Michie (trans.), ''The Odes of Horace'', Penguin Classics (1964), page 116&lt;/ref&gt; - see [[Alcaeus of Mytilene#Horace's tribute|Horace's tribute]] below. Alcaeus himself seems to underscore the difference between his own 'down-to-earth' style and Sappho's more 'celestial' qualities when he describes her almost as a goddess (as cited above), and yet it has been argued that both poets were concerned with a balance between the divine and the profane, each emphasising different elements in that balance.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Nagy, 'Lyric and Greek Myth' in ''The Cambridge Companion to Greek Mythology'', ed. R.D.Woodward, Cambridge University Press (2007), pages 19-51&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] exhorts us to &quot;Observe in Alcaeus the sublimity, brevity and sweetness coupled with stern power, his splendid figures, and his clearness which was unimpaired by the dialect; and above all mark his manner of expressing his sentiments on public affairs,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Imit. 422'', quoted from Easby-Smith in ''Songs of Alcaeus''&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Quintilian]], after commending Alcaeus for his excellence &quot;in that part of his works where he inveighs against tyrants and contributes to good morals; in his language he is concise, exalted, careful and often like an orator;&quot; goes on to add: &quot;but he descended into wantonnness and amours, though better fitted for higher things.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quintillian 10.1.63, quoted by D.Campbell in ''G.L.P'', page 288&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetic genres===
The works of Alcaeus are conventionally grouped according to five genres.
*'''Political songs''': Alcaeus often composed on a political theme, covering the power struggles on Lesbos with the passion and vigour of a partisan, cursing his opponents (fr. 129), rejoicing in their deaths (as in the drinking song fr. 332), delivering blood-curdling homilies on the consequences of political inaction (fr. S262 Page), and exhorting his comrades to heroic defiance (as in one of his 'ship of state' allegories, fr. 6). Commenting on Alcaeus as a political poet, the scholar [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] once observed that &quot;...if you removed the meter you would find political rhetoric.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Imit. 422'', quoted by Campbell in''G.L.P.'' page 286&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Drinking songs''': According to the grammarian [[Athenaeus]], Alcaeus made every occasion an excuse for drinking and he has provided posterity several quotes in proof of it.&lt;ref&gt;Athenaues 10.430c&lt;/ref&gt; Alcaeus exhorts his friends to drink in celebration of a tyrant's death (fr. 332), to drink away their sorrows (fr.s 335, 346), to drink because life is short (fr. 38A) and along the lines ''in vino veritas'' (fr. 333), to drink through winter storms (fr. 338) and to drink through the heat of summer (fr. 347). The latter poem in fact paraphrases verses from [[Hesiod]],&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod ''Op.'' 582-8&lt;/ref&gt; re-casting them in Asclepiad meter and Aeolian dialect.

*'''Hymns''': Alcaeus sang about the gods in the spirit of the [[Homeric hymns]], to entertain his companions rather than to glorify the gods and in the same meters that he used for his 'secular' lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;David A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Clasical Press (1982) page 286&lt;/ref&gt; There are for example fragments in 'Sapphic' meter praising the [[Dioscuri]] (fr. 34a), the river [[Hebrus]] (fr. 45) - significant in Lesbian mythology since it was down that river that the head of [[Orpheus]] was believed to have floated singing, eventually crossing the sea to Lesbos, where it could be seen in a temple of Apollo as a symbol of Lesbian supremacy in song.&lt;ref&gt;David A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Clasical Press (1982) page 292-3&lt;/ref&gt; - and [[Hermes]] (fr. 308b). According to [[Porphyrion]], the latter hymn was imitated by Horace in one of his own 'sapphic' odes (C.1.10: ''Mercuri, facunde nepos Atlantis'').&lt;ref&gt;David Campbell, 'Monody', in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P.Easterling and E.Kenney (eds), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 213&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Love songs''': Almost all Alcaeus' amorous verses, mentioned with disapproval by Quintilian above, have vanished without trace. There is a brief reference to his love poetry in a passage by [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusc.Disp.'' 4.71&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace]], who often wrote in imitation of Alcaeus, sketches in verse one of the Lesbian poet's favourite subjects - Lycus of the black hair and eyes (C.1.32.11-12: ''nigris oculis nigroque/crine decorum''). It is possible that Alcaeus wrote amorously about Sappho, as indicated in an earlier quote (fr. 384).

*'''Miscellaneous''': Alcaeus wrote on such a wide variety of subjects and themes that contradictions in his character emerge. The grammarian Athenaeus quoted some verses about perfumed ointments to prove just how unwarlike Alcaeus could be (fr. 362)&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus 15.687d&lt;/ref&gt; and he quoted his description of the armour adorning the walls of his house (fr. 357) as proof that he could be unusually warlike for a lyric poet.&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus 14.627a&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of his readiness for both warlike and unwarlike subjects are lyrics celebrating his brother's heroic exploits as a Babylonian mercenary (fr. 350) and  lyrics sung in a rare meter (Sapphic Ionic in minore) in the voice of a distressed girl (fr.10B), &quot;Wretched me, who share in all ills!&quot; - possibly imitated by Horace in an ode in the same meter (C.3.12: ''Miserarum est neque amori dare ludum neque dulci'').&lt;ref&gt;David Campbell, 'Monody', in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P.Easterling and E.Kenney (eds), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 214&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote Sapphic stanzas on Homeric themes but in unHomeric style, comparing [[Helen of Troy]] unfavourably with [[Thetis]], the mother of [[Akhilles]] (fr. 42).

===A drinking poem (fr. 346)===
The following verses demonstrate some key characteristics of the Alcaic style (square brackets indicate uncertainties in the ancient text):

{{Polytonic|
::πώνωμεν· τί τὰ λύχν' ὀμμένομεν; δάκτυλος ἀμέρα·
::κὰδ δ'ἄερρε κυλίχναις μεγάλαις [αιτα]ποικίλαισ·
::οἶνον γὰρ Σεμέλας καὶ Δίος υἶος λαθικάδεον
::ἀνθρώποισιν ἔδωκ'. ἔγχεε κέρναις ἔνα καὶ δύο
::πλήαις κὰκ κεφάλας, [ἀ] δ' ἀτέρα τὰν ἀτέραν κύλιξ
::ὠθήτω...}}&lt;ref&gt;David A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Clasical Press (1982) page 60&lt;/ref&gt;

::Let's drink! Why are we waiting for the lamps? Only an inch of daylight left.
::Lift down the large cups, my friends, the painted ones;
::for wine was given to men by the son of Semele and Zeus
::to help them forget their troubles. Mix one part of water to two of wine,
::pour it in up to the brim, and let one cup push the other along...&lt;ref&gt;Andrew M.Miller (trans.), ''Greek Lyric: an anthology in translation, Hackett Publishing Co. (1996) page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek meter here is relatively simple, comprising the Greater [[Asclepiad (poetry)|Asclepiad]], adroitly used here to convey, for example, the rhythm of jostling cups  ({{Polytonic|ἀ δ' ἀτέρα τὰν ἀτέραν}}). The language of the poem is typically direct and concise and comprises short sentences - the first line is in fact a model of condensed meaning, comprising an exhortation (&quot;Let's drink!), a rhetorical question (&quot;Why are we waiting for the lamps?&quot;) and a justifying statement (Only an inch of daylight left.)&lt;ref&gt;David Campbell, 'Monody', in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P.Easterling and E.Kenney (eds), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 212&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning is clear and uncomplicated, the subject is drawn from personal experience, and there is an absence of poetic ornament, such as simile or metaphor. Like many of his poems (e.g. fr.s 38, 326, 338, 347, 350), it begins with a verb (in this case &quot;Let's drink!&quot;) and it includes a proverbial expression (&quot;Only an inch of daylight left&quot;) though it is possible that he coined it himself.&lt;ref&gt;David A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Clasical Press (1982) page 287&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman poet [[Horace]] modelled his own lyrical compositions on those of Alcaeus, rendering the Lesbian poet's verse-forms, including 'Alcaic' and 'Sapphic' stanzas, into concise Latin - an achievement he celebrates in his third book of odes.&lt;ref&gt;Horace ''Od.'' 3.30&lt;/ref&gt; In his second book, in an ode composed in Alcaic stanzas on the subject of an almost fatal accident he had on his farm, he imagines meeting Alcaeus and Sappho in [[Hades]]:

::quam paene furvae regna [[Proserpina]]e
::et iudicantem vidimus [[Aeacus|Aeacum]]
:::sedesque descriptas piorum et
::::Aeoliis fidibus querentem

::Sappho puellis de popularibus
::et te sonantem plenius aureo,
:::Alcaee, plectro dura navis,
::::dura fugae mala, dura belli!&lt;ref&gt;Horace ''Od.'' 2.13.21-8&lt;/ref&gt;

::How close the realm of dusky Proserpine
::Yawned at that instant! I half glimpsed the dire
::Judge of the dead, the blest in their divine
::Seclusion, Sappho on the Aeolian lyre,

::Mourning the cold girls of her native isle,
::And you, Alcaeus, more full-throatedly
::Singing with your gold quill of ships, exile
::And war, hardship on land, hardship at sea.&lt;ref&gt;James Michie (trans.), ''The Odes of Horace'', Penguin Classics (1964), page 116&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ovid===
[[Ovid]] compared Alcaeus to Sappho in [[Heroides|Letters of the Heroines]], where Sappho is imagined to speak as follows:
::nec plus Alcaeus consors patriaeque lyraeque
:::laudis habet, quamvis grandius ille sonet.

::Nor does Alcaeus, my fellow-countryman and fellow-poet,
:::receive more praise, although he resounds more grandly.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Her''.15.29s, cited and translated by David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric I: Sappho and Alcaeus'', Loeb Classical Library (1982), page 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholars, fragments and sources==
[[Image:Ac papyrus.jpg|thumb|right|A papyrus from Oxyrhynchus, written in 2nd century Greek by 'Thais' to 'Tigrius', advising him (among other things) not to sell the pigs without first consulting her. It is amid such scraps of discarded papyrus that valuable fragments of archaic poetry have been found - including verses by Alcaeus.]]
The story of Alcaeus is partly the story of the scholars who rescued his work from oblivion.&lt;ref&gt;David.A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classic Press, 1982, pages 285-305&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James S. Easby-Smith, ''The Songs of Alcaeus'', W.H.Lowdermilk and Co., Washington, 1901 [http://www.archive.org/stream/songsalcaeusmem00englgoog/songsalcaeusmem00englgoog_djvu.txt Digitalized version]&lt;/ref&gt; His verses have not come down to us through a manuscript tradition - generations of scribes copying an author's collected works, such as delivered intact into the modern age four entire books of [[Pindar]]'s odes - but haphazardly, in quotes from ancient scholars and commentators whose own works have chanced to survive, and in the tattered remnants of papyri uncovered from an ancient rubbish pile at [[Oxyrhynchus]]: sources that modern scholars have studied and correlated exhaustively, adding little by little to the world's store of poetic fragments.

Ancient scholars quoted Alcaeus in support of various arguments. Thus for example Heraclitus 'The Allegorist'&lt;ref&gt;Donald. A. Russell and David Konstan (ed.s and tran.s.), ''Heraclitus:Homeric Problems'', Society of Biblical Literature (2005), Introduction [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=pLf2PNEy53AC&amp;pg=PP14&amp;lpg=PP14&amp;dq=Heraclitus+%2B+allegory&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Pk8wrY0YN7&amp;sig=1d-uqwqNmJGdZKjcpb9qGhqrhtM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E8oiS7PyLo2AswOo1tX8Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Alcaeus&amp;f=false Google preview]&lt;/ref&gt; quoted fr.326 and part of fr.6, about ships in a storm, in his study on Homer's use of allegory.&lt;ref&gt;Heraclitus ''All''.5&lt;/ref&gt; The hymn to Hermes, fr308(b), was quoted by [[Hephaestion (grammarian)]]&lt;ref&gt;Hephaestion ''Ench.'' xiv.1&lt;/ref&gt; and both he and [[Libanius]], the rhetorician, quoted the first two lines of fr.350,&lt;ref&gt;Hephaestion ''Ench.'' x 3; Libanus ''Or.'' 13.5&lt;/ref&gt; celebrating the return from Babylon of Alcaeus' brother. The rest of fr.350 was paraphrased in prose by the historian/geographer [[Strabo]].&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 13.617&lt;/ref&gt; Many fragments were supplied in quotes by [[Athenaeus]], principally on the subject of wine-drinking, but fr.333, &quot;wine, window into a man&quot;, was quoted much later by the Byzantine grammarian, [[John Tzetzes]].&lt;ref&gt;Tzetzes ''Alex.'' 212&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 'modern' publication of Alcaeus' verses appeared in a Greek and Latin edition of fragments collected from the canonic nine lyrical poets by Michael Neander, published at Basle in 1556. This was followed by another edition of the nine poets, collected by [[Henricus Stephanus]] and published in Paris in 1560. Fulvius Ursinus compiled a fuller collection of Alcaic fragments, including a commentary, which was published at Antwerp in 1568. The first separate edition of Alcaeus was by Christian David Jani and it was published at Halle in 1780. The next separate edition was by August Matthiae, Leipzig 1827.

Some of the fragments quoted by ancient scholars were able to be integrated by scholars in the nineteenth century. Thus for example two separate quotes by Athenaeus&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus 15.674cd, 15.687d&lt;/ref&gt; were united by [[Theodor Bergk]] to form fr.362. Three separate sources were combined to form fr.350, as mentioned above, including a prose paraphrase from Strabo that first needed to be restored to its original meter, a synthesis achieved by the united efforts of Otto Hoffmann, [[Karl Otfried Muller]] and [[Franz Heinrich Ludolf Ahrens]]. The discovery of the Oxyrhynchus papyri towards the end of the nineteenth century dramatically increased the scope of scholarly research. In fact, eight important fragments have now been compiled from papyri - fr.s 9, 38A, 42, 45, 34(a), 129, 130 and most recently S262. These fragments typically feature lacunae or gaps that scholars fill with 'educated guesses', including for example a &quot;brilliant supplement&quot; by [[Maurice Bowra]] in fr.34(a), a hymn to the Dioscuri that includes a description of [[St Elmo's fire]] in the ship's rigging.&lt;ref&gt;David.A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classic Press, 1982, page 290&lt;/ref&gt; Working with only eight letters (pro...tr...ntes), Bowra conjured up a phrase that brilliantly develops the meaning and the euphony of the poem (proton' ontrechontes), describing luminescence &quot;running along the forestays&quot;. Bowra's ability to single out important information is legendary and it is demonstrated in an anecdote about his days at Oxford. He and some colleagues had stripped naked for a swim in the river when they were surprised by a party of ladies out for a stroll. Bowra's colleagues made haste to cover their private parts; Bowra merely covered his head. Asked about this afterwards, the scholar observed: &quot;I don't know about you, gentlemen, but in Oxford I at least am known by my face.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger, ''The Bedtrick: Tales of Sex and Masquerade'', University of Chicago Press (2000), page 193&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alcamenes''' was an [[ancient Greek]] [[Sculpture|sculptor]] of [[Lemnos]] and [[Athens]]. He was a younger contemporary of [[Phidias]] and noted for the delicacy and finish of his works, among which a [[Hephaestus]] and an [[Aphrodite]] &quot;of the Gardens&quot; were conspicuous.

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] says (v. 10. 8) that he was the author of one of the pediments of the temple of [[Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], but this seems a chronological and stylistic impossibility.  Pausanias (I, 8, 4), also refers to a statue of Ares by Alcamenes that was erected on the [[Athenian agora]], which some have related to the [[Ares Borghese]].  However, the temple of Ares to which he refers had only been moved from [[Acharnes]] and re-sited in the Agora in [[Augustus]]'s time, and statues known to derive from Alcamenes' statue show the god in a [[breastplate]] (one is depicted [http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=20221 in this relief]), so the identification of Alcamenes' Ares with the Ares Borghese is not secure.  

At [[Pergamum]] there was discovered in 1903 a Hellenistic copy of the head of the Hermes &quot;Propylaeus&quot; of Alcamenes (''Athenische Mittheilungen'', 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;180). As, however, the deity is represented in an [[Neo-Attic]], archaistic and conventional character, this copy cannot be relied on as giving us much information as to the usual style of Alcamenes, who was almost certainly a progressive and original artist.

It is safer to judge him by the sculptural decoration of the [[Parthenon]], in which he must almost certainly have taken a share under the direction of Pheidias. He is said to be the most eminent sculptor in [[Athens]] after the departure of Pheidias for [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], but enigmatic in that none of the sculptures associated with his name in classical literature can be securely connected with existing copies.

[[Image:Birth of heracles.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Birth of [[Heracles]]'' by [[Jean Jacques Francois Le Barbier]]]]
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Alcmene''' or '''Alcmena''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|Αλκμήνη}}) was the mother of [[Heracles]].

==Background==

Alcmene was born to [[Electryon]], king of [[Mycenae]] and a granddaughter of [[Perseus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollod. 2.4.5&quot;&gt;Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Library]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.4.5 2.4.5]&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was either [[Anaxo]], daughter of [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]] and [[Astydameia|Astydamia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollod. 2.4.5&quot; /&gt; or [[Lysidice]], daughter of [[Pelops]] and [[Hippodamia|Hippodameia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Plut. Thes. 7.1&quot;&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]'' Theseus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plut.+Thes.+7.1 7.1]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hesiod]] describes Alcmene as the tallest, most beautiful woman with wisdom surpassed by no person born of mortal parents. It is said that her face and dark eyes were as charming as [[Aphrodite|Aphrodite's]], and that she honoured her husband like no woman before her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hes. Sh. 1&quot;&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[The Shield of Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Sh.+1 1ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exile to Thebes==

According to [[Apollodorus]], Alcmene went with [[Amphitryon]] to [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]], where he was purified by [[Creon]] for accidentally killing Electryon. Alcmene refused to marry Amphitryon until he had avenged the death of her brothers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollod. 2.4.6&quot;&gt;Apollodorus, ''Library'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.4.6 2.4.6]&lt;/ref&gt; However, during Amphitryon's expedition against the [[Taphians]] and [[Teleboans]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollod. 2.4.7&quot;&gt;Apollodorus, ''Library'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.4.7 2.4.7]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeus]] visited Alcmene disguised as Amphitryon. Extending one night into three, Zeus slept with Alcmene (his great-granddaughter) (thereby conceiving [[Heracles]]) and recounted Amphitryon's victories against the Teleboans. When Amphitryon finally returned to Thebes, Alcmene told him that he had come the night before and slept with her; he learned from [[Tiresias]] what Zeus had done.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollod. 2.4.8&quot;&gt;Apollodorus, ''Library'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.4.8 2.4.8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth of Heracles==

===Homer===

In [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Iliad]]'', when Alcmene was about to give birth to Heracles, Zeus announced to all the gods that on that day a child, descended from Zeus himself, would be born who would rule all those around him. [[Hera]], after requesting Zeus to swear an oath to that effect, descended from [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] to [[Argos]] and made the wife of [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]] (a son of Perseus) give birth to [[Eurystheus]] after only seven months, while at the same time preventing Alcmene from delivering Heracles. This resulted in the fulfilment of Zeus's oath by Eurystheus rather than Heracles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hom. Il. 19.95&quot;&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Il.+19.95 19.95ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ovid===

According to [[Ovid|Ovid's]] ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', while in labour, Alcmene was having difficulty giving birth to such a large child. After seven days and nights in agony, Alcmene stretched out her arms and called upon [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]], the goddess of childbirth (the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] equivalent of [[Eileithyia]]). However, while Lucina did go to Alcmene, she was instructed by [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] (Hera) to stop the delivery. With her hands clasped and legs crossed, Lucina muttered charms, thereby preventing Alcmene from giving birth. Alcmene struggled in pain, cursed the heavens, and became close to death. [[Galanthis]], a maid of Alcmene who was nearby, observed Lucina's actions and quickly deduced Juno's plans. She announced that Alcmene had safely delivered her child, and this surprised Lucina so much that she immediately jumped up and unclenched her hands. As soon as Lucina leapt up, Alcmene was released from her spell and gave birth to Heracles. As punishment for deceiving Lucina, Galanthis was transformed into a [[weasel]]; she continued to live with Alcmene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ov. Met. 9.273&quot;&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]''  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Ov.+Met.+9.273 9.273ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pausanias===
In [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias']] recounting, Hera sent witches (as they were called by the Thebans) to hinder Alcmene's delivery of Heracles. The witches were successful in preventing the birth until [[Historis]], daughter of Tiresias, thought of a trick to deceive the witches. Like Galanthis, Historis announced that Alcmene had delivered her child; having been deceived, the witches went away, allowing Alcmene to give birth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paus. 9.11.3&quot;&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.11.3 9.11.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plautus===
In contrast to the depictions of difficult labor above, an alternative version is presented in ''[[Amphitryon (play)|Amphitryon]]'', a comedic play by [[Plautus]]. Here Alcmene calls upon Jupiter, who performs a miracle allowing her to give birth quickly and without pain. After a crash of thunder and light, the baby arrives without anyone's assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plautus]], ''Amphitryon'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0092 &quot;The Subject&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

After the death of Amphitryon, Alcmene married [[Rhadamanthus|Rhadamanthys]], son of Zeus, and lived with him in exile at [[Ocalea (town)|Ocaleae]] in [[Boeotia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollod. 2.4.11&quot;&gt;Apollodorus, ''Library'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.4.11 2.4.11]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that after Heracles was [[apotheosis]]ed, Hyllus, having pursued and killed [[Eurystheus]], cut off Eurystheus' head and gave it to Alcmene, who gouged out the eyes with weaving pins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollod. 2.8.1&quot;&gt;Apollodorus, ''Library'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.8.1 2.8.1]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Metamorphoses]], an aging Alcmene recounted the story of the birth of Heracles to [[Iole]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ov. Met. 9.273&quot; /&gt;

There are two accounts of Alcmene's death. In the first, according to the Megarians, Alcmene was walking from Argos to Thebes when she died at [[Megara]]. The [[Heracleidae]] fell into disagreement about where to take Alcmene's body, with some wishing to take her corpse back to Argos, and others wishing to take it to Thebes to be buried with Amphitryon and Heracles' children by [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]]. However, the god in [[Delphi]] gave the Heracleidae an oracle that it was better to bury Alcmene in Megara.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paus. 1.41.1&quot;&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.41.1 1.41.1]&lt;/ref&gt; In the second account given by the Thebans, when Alcmene died, she was turned from human form to a stone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paus. 9.16.7&quot;&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.16.7 9.16.7]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pausanias indicated that an altar to Alcmene had been built in the [[Cynosarges]] in Athens, alongside altars to Heracles, [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]], and [[Iolaus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Paus. 1.19.3&quot;&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.19.3 1.19.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias also said that Alcmene's tomb is located near the Olympieum at Megara.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paus. 1.41.1&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alcidamas''', of [[Elaea (Aeolis)|Elaea]], in [[Aeolis]], [[ancient Greece|Greek]] [[sophist]] and [[rhetoric]]ian, flourished in the 4th century BC.

He was the pupil and successor of [[Gorgias]] and taught at [[Athens]] at the same time as [[Isocrates]], whose rival and opponent he was. We possess two declamations under his name: ''On Sophists'', directed against Isocrates and setting forth the superiority of extempore over written speeches (a more recently discovered fragment of another speech against Isocrates is probably of later date); ''Odysseus'' (perhaps spurious)&lt;ref&gt; Ballif, [http://books.google.com/books?id=CYykAGVyqvwC&amp;pg=PA15 p.15].&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Odysseus]] accuses [[Palamedes (mythology)|Palamedes]] of treachery during the siege of [[Troy]]

According to Alcidamas, the highest aim of the orator was the power of speaking ''extempore'' on every conceivable subject. [[Aristotle]] (''Rhet.'' iii. 3) criticizes his writings as characterized by pomposity of style and an extravagant use of poetical epithets and compounds and far-fetched metaphors.

Of other works only fragments and the titles have survived: ''Messeniakos'', advocating the freedom of the Messenians and containing the sentiment that &quot;all are by nature free&quot;; a ''Eulogy of Death'', in consideration of the wide extent of human sufferings; a ''Techne'' or instruction-book in the art
of rhetoric; and a ''Phusikos logos''. Lastly, his ''Mouseion'' (a word invoking the [[Muse]]s) seems to have contained the narrative of the ''[[Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]'',  of which the version that has survived  is the work of a grammarian in the time of [[Hadrian]], based on Alcidamas.  This hypothesis of the contents of the ''Mouseion'', originally suggested by [[Nietzsche]] (''Rheinisches Museum'' 25 (1870) &amp; 28 (1873)), appears to have been confirmed by three papyrus finds - one 3rd century BC (''Flinders Petrie Papyri'', ed.  [[John Pentland Mahaffy|Mahaffy]], 1891, pl. xxv.), one 2nd century BC (Basil Mandilaras, 'A new papyrus fragment of the ''Certamen Homeri et Hesiodi''' ''Platon'' 42 (1990) 45-51)  and one 2nd or 3rd century AD (University of Michigan pap. 2754: Winter, J. G., 'A New Fragment on the Life of Homer' ''TAPA'' 56 (1925) 120-129 [http://images.umdl.umich.edu/cgi/i/image/image-idx?rgn1=apis_inv;op2=And;rgn2=ic_all;op3=And;rgn3=ic_all;c=apis;q1=2754;back=back1152510816;size=50;subview=detail;resnum=1;view=entry;lastview=reslist;cc=apis;entryid=x-1622;viewid=2754V.TIF]).

[[File:Virgil 1501 Aldus Manutius.jpg|The Rylands copy of the Aldine Vergil of 1501, the first of the standard octavo Aldines|thumb]]
'''Aldine Press''' was the [[printing]] office started by [[Aldus Manutius]] in 1494 in [[Venice]], from which were issued the celebrated Aldine editions of the classics (Latin and Greek masterpieces plus a few more modern works). The Aldine Press is famous in the history of [[typography]], among other things, for the introduction of [[italics]]. The press was the first to issue printed books in the small [[octavo (book)|octavo]] size, similar to that of a modern paperback, and like that intended for portability and ease of reading. The press issued 127 editions during the lifetime of Aldus. The press was continued after Aldus’s death in 1515 by his wife and her father until his son Paolo (1512–1574) took over. His grandson Aldo then ran the firm until his death in 1597. Due to the firm's commercial success many pirated editions were also produced in Lyons and elsewhere. Today, antique books printed by the Aldine Press in Venice are referred to as '''Aldines'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;princetonlibrary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/hb/cases/aldines/index.html|title=Hand Bookbindings|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Library|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial innovations==
The press was started by Aldus based on his love of classics, and at first printed new copies of Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek and Latin classics. He also printed dictionaries and grammars to help people interpret the books. While scholars wanting to learn Greek used to employ learned Greeks to teach them directly, the Aldine editions, edited by Greek scholars, allowed many scholars across Europe to study Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, E. (1979). ''The Printing Press as an Agent of Change''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Elizabeth Eisenstein]] claimed that the fall of [[Constantinople]] in 1453 had threatened the importance and survival of Greek scholarship, but publications such as those by the Aldine Press secured it. [[Erasmus]] was one of the scholars learned in Greek that the Aldine Press employed. 

When the press expanded to current titles, they wrote some books themselves and employed other writers, including [[Erasmus]]. As this expansion into current languages (mainly Italian and French) and current topics continued, the press took on another role and made perhaps even more important contributions. Beyond the preservation of Hellenic studies, Aldus's contributions are also respected in the development of a smaller type than others in use. His contemporaries called it ''Aldine Type''; today we call it ''italics''. Their logo of the anchor and dolphin is represented today in the symbols and names used by some modern publishers such as [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]].

The most nearly complete collection of Aldine editions ever brought together was in the Althorp library of the [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|2nd Earl Spencer]], now in the [[John Rylands Library]], Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to Special Collections (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more substantial collections of Aldine Press books and Aldine imitations in North America is at the Harold B. Lee library on the campus of Brigham Young Univeristy in Provo, Utah. See this link: http://net.lib.byu.edu/aldine/aldWel.html.

'''Ealdred''' (or '''Aldred''') (died 11 September 1069) was [[Abbot of Tavistock]], [[Bishop of Worcester]], and [[Archbishop of York]] in [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon England]]. He was related to a number of other ecclesiastics of the period. After becoming a monk at the monastery at [[Winchester]], he was appointed [[Abbot]] of [[Tavistock Abbey]] in around 1027. In 1046 he was named to the Bishopric of Worcester. Ealdred, besides his episcopal duties, served [[Edward the Confessor]], the King of England, as a diplomat and as a military leader. He worked to bring one of the king's relatives, [[Edward the Exile]], back to England from Hungary to secure an heir for the childless king.

In 1058 he undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the first bishop from England to do so.&lt;ref name=Edward208&gt;Barlow ''Edward the Confessor'' pp. 208–209&lt;/ref&gt; As administrator of the [[Diocese of Hereford]], he was involved in fighting against the Welsh, suffering two defeats at the hands of raiders before securing a settlement with [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]], a Welsh ruler.

In 1060, Ealdred was elected to the archbishopric of York, but had difficulty in obtaining papal approval for his appointment, only managing to do so when he promised not to hold the bishoprics of York and Worcester simultaneously. He helped secure the election of [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan]] as his successor at Worcester. During his archiepiscopate, he built and embellished churches in his diocese, and worked to improve his clergy by holding a synod which published regulations for the priesthood.

Some sources state that following King Edward's death in 1066, it was Ealdred who crowned [[Harold Godwinson]] as King of England.&lt;ref name=Hindley335&gt;Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; Ealdred supported Harold as king, but when Harold was defeated at the [[Battle of Hastings]], Ealdred backed [[Edgar the Ætheling]] and then endorsed King [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], the [[Duke of Normandy]] and a distant relative of King Edward's. Ealdred crowned King William on Christmas Day in 1066. William never quite trusted Ealdred or the other English leaders, and Ealdred had to accompany William back to Normandy in 1067, but he had returned to York by the time of his death in 1069. Ealdred supported the churches and monasteries in his diocese with gifts and building projects.

==Early life==

Ealdred was likely born in the west of England, and could be related to [[Lyfing of Winchester|Lyfing]], his predecessor as bishop of Worcester.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Lawson &quot;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37382 Ealdred (d. 1069)]&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; His family, from Devonshire, may have been well-to-do.&lt;ref name=King124&gt;King &quot;Ealdred&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Another relative was Wilstan or Wulfstan, who under Ealdred's influence became [[Abbot of Gloucester]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Ealdred was a [[monk]] in the [[cathedral chapter]] at [[Winchester Cathedral]] before becoming abbot of Tavistock Abbey about 1027, an office he held until about 1043.&lt;ref name=Knowles72&gt;Knowles ''Monastic Order in England'' p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Even after leaving the abbacy of Tavistock, he continued to hold two properties from the abbey until his death.&lt;ref name=King124/&gt; During his tenure as abbot, he supported the abbey with gifts; the medieval chronicler [[William of Malmesbury]] said that they were splendid and many.&lt;ref name=King125&gt;King &quot;Ealdred&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; No contemporary documents relating to Ealdred's time as abbot have been discovered.&lt;ref name=King125/&gt;

Ealdred was made bishop of Worcester in 1046, a position he held until his resignation in 1062.&lt;ref name=Handbook224&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; He may have acted as [[Suffragan bishop|suffragan]], or subordinate bishop, to his predecessor Lyfing before formally assuming the bishopric,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Edward86&gt;Barlow ''Edward the Confessor'' p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; as from about 1043 Ealdred witnessed as an ''episcopus'', or bishop, and a charter from 1045 or early 1046 names Sihtric as abbot of Tavistock.&lt;ref name=King125/&gt; Lyfing died on 26&amp;nbsp;March 1046, and Ealdred became bishop of Worcester shortly after. However, Ealdred did not receive the other two dioceses that Lyfing had held, [[Bishop of Crediton|Crediton]] and [[Bishop of Cornwall|Cornwall]]; King [[Edward the Confessor]] (reigned 1043–1066) granted these to [[Leofric (bishop)|Leofric]], who combined the two sees at Crediton in 1050.&lt;ref name=King125/&gt;

==Bishop and royal advisor==
[[Image:Harold2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Harold Godwinson, from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], whom Ealdred failed to catch in 1051|alt=Tapestry image of a man on horseback holding a falcon]]

Ealdred was an advisor to King Edward the Confessor, and was often involved in the royal government.&lt;ref name=Huscroft49/&gt; He was also a military leader, and in 1046 he led an unsuccessful expedition against the Welsh.&lt;ref name=Huscroft49&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; This was in retaliation for a raid led by the Welsh rulers [[Gruffydd ap Rhydderch]], [[Rhys ap Rhydderch]], and [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]]. Ealdred's expedition was betrayed by some Welsh soldiers who were serving with the English, and Ealdred was defeated.&lt;ref name=Maund89&gt;Maund ''Welsh Kings'' pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1050, Ealdred went to Rome &quot;on the king's errand&quot;,&lt;ref name=Huscroft50&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; apparently to secure papal approval to move the seat, or center, of the bishopric of Crediton to Exeter. It may also have been to secure the release of the king from a vow to go on pilgrimage, if sources from after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] of England are to be believed.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; While in Rome, he attended a papal council, along with his fellow English bishop [[Herman (bishop)|Herman]].&lt;ref name=Smith574&gt;Smith, et al. &quot;Court and Piety&quot; ''Catholic Historical Review'' p. 574&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year, as Ealdred was returning to England he met [[Sweyn Godwinson|Sweyn]], a son of [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]], and probably absolved Sweyn for having abducted the abbess of [[Leominster Abbey]] in 1046.&lt;ref name=Godwins55&gt;Barlow ''The Godwins'' p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Through Ealdred's intercession, Sweyn was restored to his earldom, which he had lost after abducting the abbess and murdering his brother Beorn.&lt;ref name=Rex37&gt;Rex ''Harold II'' p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Edward103&gt;Barlow ''Edward the Confessor'' p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Ealdred helped Sweyn not only because Ealdred was a supporter of Earl Godwin's family but because Sweyn's earldom was close to his bishopric. As recently as 1049 Irish raiders had allied with Gruffydd ap Rhydderch of [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]] in raiding along the [[River Usk]]. Ealdred unsuccessfully tried to drive off the raiders, but was again routed by the Welsh. This failure underscored Ealdred's need for a strong earl in the area to protect against raids.&lt;ref name=Mason57&gt;Mason ''House of Godwine'' pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, the [[bishop of Hereford]] would have led the defence in the absence of an Earl of Hereford, but in 1049 the incumbent, [[Æthelstan (Bishop of Hereford)|Æthelstan]], was blind, so Ealdred took on the role of defender.&lt;ref name=King126&gt;King &quot;Ealdred&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' pp. 126–127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomatic travels==
Earl Godwin's rebellion against the king in 1051 came as a blow to Ealdred, who was a supporter of the earl and his family. Ealdred was present at the royal council at London that banished Godwin's family.&lt;ref name=King127&gt;King &quot;Ealdred&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1051, when he was sent to intercept [[Harold Godwinson]] and his brothers as they fled England after their father's outlawing, Ealdred &quot;could not, or would not&quot; capture the brothers.&lt;ref name=Harold132&gt;Walker ''Harold'' pp. 132–133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Edward114&gt;Barlow ''Edward the Confessor'' p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; The banishment of Ealdred's patron came shortly after the death of [[Ælfric Puttoc]], the [[Archbishop of York]]. York and Worcester had long had close ties, and the two sees had often been held in [[Benefice|plurality]], or at the same time. Ealdred likely wanted to become Archbishop of York after Ælfric's death, but his patron's eclipse led to the king appointing [[Cynesige]], a royal chaplain, instead.&lt;ref name=King127/&gt; In September 1052, though, Godwin returned from exile and his family was restored to power.&lt;ref name=Huscroft6&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1053 Ealdred was once more in royal favour.&lt;ref name=King127/&gt; At some point, he was alleged to have accompanied Swein on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, but proof is lacking.&lt;ref name=Fleming79&gt;Fleming ''Kings &amp; Lords in Conquest England'' pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|If he did accompany Swein, the historian [[Frank Barlow (historian)|Frank Barlow]] argues that it was probably in 1058.&lt;ref name=BarlowChurch88&gt;Barlow ''English Church 1000–1066'' p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}

In 1054 King Edward sent Ealdred to Germany to obtain Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]]'s help in returning Edward the Exile, son of [[Edmund Ironside]], to England. Edmund (reigned 1016) was an elder half-brother of King Edward the Confessor, and Edmund's son Edward was in Hungary with King [[Andrew I of Hungary|Andrew I]], having left England as an infant after his father's death and the accession of [[Canute the Great|Cnut]] as King of England.&lt;ref name=Huscroft8&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In this mission Ealdred was somewhat successful and obtained insight into the working of the German church during a stay of a year&lt;ref name=Walker76&gt;Walker ''Harold'' p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Herman II (Archbishop of Cologne)|Hermann II]], the [[Archbishop of Cologne]].&lt;ref name=Edward215&gt;Barlow ''Edward the Confessor'' pp. 215–218&lt;/ref&gt; He also was impressed with the buildings he saw, and later incorporated some of the German styles into his own constructions.&lt;ref name=King128&gt;King &quot;Ealdred&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; The main objective of the mission, however, was to secure the return of Edward; but this failed, mainly because Henry III's relations with the Hungarians were strained, and the emperor was unable or unwilling to help Ealdred.&lt;ref name=Mason88&gt;Mason ''House of Godwine'' p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Ealdred was able to discover that Edward was alive, and had a place at the Hungarian court.&lt;ref name=Rex126&gt;Rex ''Harold II'' p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Edward eventually returned to England in 1057, but died shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=Rex127&gt;Rex ''Harold II'' p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Although some sources state that Ealdred attended the coronation of Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], this is not possible, as on the date that Henry was crowned, Ealdred was in England consecrating an abbot.&lt;ref name=King128/&gt;

Ealdred had returned to England by 1055, and brought with him a copy of the ''[[Romano-German Pontifical|Pontificale Romano-Germanicum]]'', a [[Roman Pontifical|set of liturgies]], with him. An extant copy of this work, currently manuscript [[Cotton library|Cotton Vitellus E xii]], has been identified as a copy owned by Ealdred.&lt;ref name=King128/&gt; It appears likely that the ''[[Chrodegang of Metz|Rule of Chrodegang]]'', a continental set of ordinances for the communal life of [[Canon (priest)|secular canons]], was introduced into England by Ealdred sometime before 1059. Probably he brought it back from Germany, possibly in concert with Harold.&lt;ref name=Rex77&gt;Rex ''Harold II'' p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

After Ealdred's return to England he took charge of the sees of [[Diocese of Hereford|Hereford]]&lt;ref name=Mason94&gt;Mason ''House of Godwine'' p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bishop of Ramsbury|Ramsbury]].&lt;ref name=Harold132/&gt; Ealdred also administered [[Winchcombe Abbey]] and [[Gloucester Abbey]].&lt;ref name=Edward198&gt;Barlow ''Edward the Confessor'' pp. 197–199&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the ''Handbook of British Chronology Third Edition'' say he was named bishop of Hereford in 1056, holding the see until he resigned it in 1060,&lt;ref name=Handbook217&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; but other sources say that he merely administered the see while it was vacant,&lt;ref name=Huscroft45&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; or that he was bishop of Hereford from 1055 to 1060.&lt;ref name=BHOYork&gt;Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=8457 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300: Volume 6: York: Archbishops]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Ealdred became involved with the see of Ramsbury after its bishop Herman got into a dispute with King Edward over the movement of the seat of his bishopric to [[Malmesbury Abbey]]. Herman wished to move the seat of his see, but Edward refused permission for the move. Ealdred was a close associate of Herman's,&lt;ref name=King128/&gt; and the historian [[H. R. Loyn]] called Herman &quot;something of an alter ego&quot; to Ealdred.&lt;ref name=Loyn61&gt;Loyn ''English Church'' p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; According to the medieval chronicler [[John of Worcester]], Ealdred was given the see of Ramsbury to administer while Herman remained outside England. Herman returned in 1058, and resumed his bishopric. There is no contemporary documentary evidence of Ealdred's administration of Ramsbury.&lt;ref name=King128/&gt;

==Welsh affairs, Jerusalem, and Worcester==

The king again employed Ealdred as a diplomat in 1056, when he assisted earls Harold and Leofgar in negotiations with the Welsh.&lt;ref name=King128a/&gt; Edward sent Ealdred after the death in battle of Bishop [[Leofgar of Hereford]], who had attacked [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]] after encouragement from the king. However, Leofgar lost the battle and his life, and Edward had to sue for peace.&lt;ref name=Maund94&gt;Maund ''Welsh Kings'' pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; Although details of the negotiations are lacking, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn swore loyalty to King Edward,&lt;ref name=King128a/&gt; but the oath may not have had any obligations on Gruffydd's part to Edward. The exact terms of the submission are not known in total, but Gruffydd was not required to assist Edward in war nor attend Edward's court.&lt;ref name=Maund94/&gt; Ealdred was rewarded with the administration of the see of Hereford, which he held until 1061, and was appointed Archbishop of York.&lt;ref name=King128a&gt;King &quot;Ealdred&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt; The diocese had suffered a serious raid from the Welsh in 1055, and during his administration, Ealdred continued the rebuilding of the cathedral church as well as securing the cathedral chapter's rights.&lt;ref name=King128a/&gt; Ealdred was granted the administration in order that the area might have someone with experience with the Welsh in charge.&lt;ref name=Darlington399/&gt;

In 1058 Ealdred made a pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]], the first English bishop to make the journey.&lt;ref name=Edward208/&gt; He travelled through Hungary, and the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' stated that &quot;he went to Jerusalem in such state as no-one had done before him&quot;.&lt;ref name=QKing130&gt;Quoted in King &quot;Ealdred&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; While in Jerusalem he made a gift of a gold chalice to  the church of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre]].&lt;ref name=BarlowChurch89&gt;Barlow ''English Church 1000–1066'' p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the reason Ealdred travelled through Hungary was to arrange the travel of Edward the Exile's family to England. Another possibility is that he wished to search for other possible heirs to King Edward in Hungary.&lt;ref name=King130&gt;King &quot;Ealdred&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known exactly when Edward the Exile's family returned to England, whether they returned with Edward in 1057, or sometime later, so it is only a possibility that they returned with Ealdred in 1058.&lt;ref name=Rex129&gt;Rex ''Harold II'' p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Very little documentary evidence is available from Ealdred's time as Bishop of Worcester. Only five leases that he signed survive, and all date from 1051 to 1053. Two further leases exist in ''[[Hemming's Cartulary]]'' as copies only. How the [[Anglican Diocese of Worcester|diocese of Worcester]] was administered when Ealdred was abroad is unclear, although it appears that [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan]], the prior of the [[cathedral chapter]], performed the religious duties in the diocese. On the financial side, the ''[[Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham|Evesham Chronicle]]'' states that [[Æthelwig]], who became abbot of [[Evesham Abbey]] in 1058, administered Worcester before he became abbot.&lt;ref name=King134&gt;King &quot;Ealdred&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' pp. 134–137&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archbishop of York==
[[File:Bayeux Edward Funeral.jpg|left|upright=2.4|thumb|The funeral cortege of Edward the Confessor, from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]|alt=Tapestry image of a procession of men carrying a coffin heading towards a church building.]]
Cynesige, the archbishop of York, died on 22 December 1060, and Ealdred was elected [[Archbishop of York]] on Christmas Day, 1060. Although a bishop was promptly appointed to Hereford, none was named to Worcester, and it appears that Ealdred intended to retain Worcester along with York, which several of his predecessors had done.&lt;ref name=King130/&gt; There were a few reasons for this, one of which was political, as the kings of England preferred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics, hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism. Another reason was that York was not a wealthy see, and Worcester was. Holding Worcester along with York allowed the archbishop sufficient revenue to support himself.&lt;ref name=Loyn158&gt;Loyn ''Governance'' p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1061 Ealdred travelled to Rome to receive the [[pallium]], the symbol of an archbishop's authority. Journeying with him was [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]], another son of Earl Godwin, who was now earl of [[Northumbria]].&lt;ref name=Hindley330&gt;Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; [[William of Malmesbury]] says that Ealdred, by &quot;amusing the simplicity of King Edward and alleging the custom of his predecessors, had acquired, more by bribery than by reason, the archbishopric of York while still holding his former see.&quot;&lt;ref name=Powell13&gt;Powell ''House of Lords'' pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; On his arrival in Rome, however, charges of [[simony]], or the buying of ecclesiastical office, and lack of learning were brought against him, and his elevation to York was refused by Pope [[Pope Nicholas II|Nicholas II]], who also deposed him from Worcester.&lt;ref name=Powell13/&gt; The story of Ealdred being deposed comes from the ''Vita Edwardi'', a life of Edward the Confessor, but the ''Vita Wulfstani'', an account of the life of Ealdred's successor at Worcester, [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan]], says that Nicholas refused the pallium until a promise to find a replacement for Worcester was given by Ealdred.&lt;ref name=King131&gt;King &quot;Ealdred&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another chronicler, John of Worcester, mentions nothing of any trouble in Rome, and when discussing the appointment of Wulfstan, says that Wulfstan was elected freely and unanimously by the clergy and people.&lt;ref name=King131/&gt; John of Worcester also claims that at Wulfstan's consecration, [[Stigand]], the archbishop of Canterbury extracted a promise from Ealdred that neither he nor his successors would lay claim to any jurisdiction over the diocese of Worcester. Given that John of Worcester wrote his chronicle after the eruption of the Canterbury–York supremacy struggle, the story of Ealdred renouncing any claims to Worcester needs to be considered suspect.&lt;ref name=King131a&gt;King &quot;Ealdred&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;

For whatever reason, Ealdred gave up the see of Worcester in 1062, when papal legates arrived in England to hold a council and make sure that Ealdred relinquished Worcester.&lt;ref name=Harold50&gt;Walker ''Harold'' p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; This happened at Easter in 1062.&lt;ref name=Darlington399&gt;Darlington &quot;Ecclesiastical Reform&quot; ''English Historical Review'' pp. 399–400&lt;/ref&gt; Ealdred was succeeded by Wulfstan, chosen by Ealdred, but John of Worcester relates that Ealdred had a hard time deciding between Wulfstan and Æthelwig.&lt;ref name=Monastic76&gt;Knowles ''Monastic Order'' p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; The legates had urged the selection of Wulfstan because of his saintliness.&lt;ref name=BarlowChurch106&gt;Barlow ''English Church 1000–1066'' pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; Because the position of Stigand, the archbishop of Canterbury, was irregular, Wulfstan sought and received consecration as a bishop from Ealdred. Normally, Wulfstan would have gone to the archbishop of Canterbury, as the see of Worcester was within Canterbury's province.&lt;ref name=Brooks306&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ealdred gave up the bishopric, the appointment of Wulfstan was one that allowed Ealdred to continue his considerable influence on the see of Worcester. Ealdred retained a number of estates belonging to Worcester. Even after the Norman Conquest, Ealdred still controlled some events in Worcester, and it was Ealdred, not Wulfstan, who opposed [[Urse d'Abetot]]'s attempt to extend the castle of Worcester into the cathedral after the Norman Conquest.&lt;ref name=King132&gt;King &quot;Ealdred&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII'' pp. 132–133&lt;/ref&gt;

While archbishop, Ealdred built at [[Beverley]], expanding on the building projects begun by his predecessor Cynesige,&lt;ref name=Huscroft46&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; as well as repairing and expanding other churches in his diocese.&lt;ref name=Edward198/&gt; He also built refectories for the canons at York and Southwell.&lt;ref name=Darlington404&gt;Darlington &quot;Ecclesiastical Reform&quot; ''English Historical Review'' p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;  He also was the one bishop that published ecclesiastical legislation during Edward the Confessor's reign, attempting to discipline and reform the clergy.&lt;ref name=Barlow122&gt;Barlow ''English Church, 1066–1154'' p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; He held a synod of his clergy shortly before 1066.&lt;ref name=BarlowChurch246&gt;Barlow ''English Church 1000–1066'' p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the death of Edward the Confessor==
[[File:William the Conqueror silver coin.jpg|thumb|right|A penny from the time of William I|alt=Coin image of a crowned male head with a sceptre in the background]]
[[John of Worcester]], a medieval chronicler, stated that Ealdred crowned King Harold II in 1066, although the [[Normans|Norman]] chroniclers mention [[Stigand]] as the officiating prelate.&lt;ref name=Hindley335/&gt; Given Ealdred's known support of Godwin's family, John of Worcester is probably correct.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Stigand's position as archbishop was canonically suspect, and as earl Harold had not allowed Stigand to consecrate one of the earl's churches, so it is unlikely that Harold would have allowed Stigand to perform the much more important royal coronation.&lt;ref name=Rex199&gt;Rex ''Harold'' pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments for Stigand having performed the coronation, however, rely on the fact that no other English source names the ecclesiastic who performed the ceremony; all Norman sources name Stigand as the presider.&lt;ref name=BarlowChurch60&gt;Barlow ''English Church 1000–1066'' p. 60 footnote 4&lt;/ref&gt; In all events, Ealdred and Harold were close, and Ealdred supported Harold's bid to become king.&lt;ref name=Harold132/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harold117&gt;Walker ''Harold'' p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Ealdred perhaps accompanied Harold when the new king went to York and secured the support of the northern magnates shortly after Harold's consecration.&lt;ref name=Douglas183&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the medieval chronicler [[Geoffrey Gaimar]], after the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] Harold entrusted the loot gained from [[Harald III of Norway|Harold Hardrada]] to Ealdred.&lt;ref name=Lawson42n93&gt;Lawson ''Battle of Hastings'' p. 42 footnote 93&lt;/ref&gt; Gaimar asserts that King Harold did this because he had heard of Duke William's landing in England, and needed to rush south to counter it.&lt;ref name=Lawson75&gt;Lawson ''Battle of Hastings'' p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Battle of Hastings]], Ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate [[Edgar the Ætheling]], Edward the Exile's son, as king, but eventually he submitted to [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] at [[Berkhamsted]].&lt;ref name=Huscroft19&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams32&gt;Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated over what to do while William ravaged the countryside,&lt;ref name=Rex130&gt;Rex ''Harold II'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; which led to Ealdred and Edgar's submission to William.&lt;ref name=Douglas206&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Ealdred crowned William king on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] 1066.&lt;ref name=Powell1&gt;Powell ''House of Lords'' p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; An innovation in William's coronation ceremony was that before the actual crowning, Ealdred asked the assembled crowd, in English, if it was their wish that William be crowned king. The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Coutances|Bishop of Coutances]] then did the same, but in [[Norman language|Norman French]].&lt;ref name=Powell1/&gt; In March of 1067, William took Ealdred with him when William returned to [[Normandy]], along with the other English leaders Earl [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin of Mercia]], Earl [[Morcar]], Edgar the Ætheling, and Archbishop Stigand.&lt;ref name=Harold185&gt;Walker ''Harold'' pp. 185–187&lt;/ref&gt; Ealdred at [[Whitsun]] 1068 performed the coronation of [[Matilda of Flanders|Matilda]], William's wife.&lt;ref name=Powell13/&gt; The ''[[Laudes Regiae]]'', or song commending a ruler, that was performed at Matilda's coronation may have been composed by Ealdred himself for the occasion.&lt;ref name=Queen183&gt;Stafford ''Queen Emma &amp; Queen Edith'' p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; In 1069, when the northern [[thegn]]s rebelled against William and attempted to install Edgar the Ætheling as king, Ealdred continued to support William.&lt;ref name=Williams32/&gt; He was the only northern leader to support William, however.&lt;ref name=Kapelle109&gt;Kapelle ''Norman Conquest of the North'' p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Ealdred was back at York by 1069; he died there on 11&amp;nbsp;September 1069,&lt;ref name=Handbook224/&gt; and was buried in his episcopal cathedral. He may have taken an active part in trying to calm the rebellions in the north in 1068 and 1069.&lt;ref name=Powell13/&gt; The medieval chronicler [[William of Malmesbury]] records a story that when the new sheriff of Worcester, [[Urse d'Abetot]],  encroached on the cemetery of the cathedral chapter for [[Worcester Cathedral]], Ealdred pronounced a rhyming curse on him, saying &quot;Thou are called Urse. May you have God's curse.&quot;&lt;ref name=QBates153&gt;Quoted in Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 153. The exact sentence in Bates is &quot;Urse's refusal to move it drew a poetic Old English curse from the archbishop, which began &quot;Thou are called Urse. May you have God's curse.&quot;&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

After Ealdred's death, one of the restraints on William's treatment of the English was removed.&lt;ref name=Barlow57/&gt; Ealdred was one of a few native Englishmen who William appears to have trusted, and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate Englishmen into the administration, although such efforts did not entirely stop.&lt;ref name=Bates156&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; In 1070, a church council was held at Westminster and a number of bishops were deposed. By 1073 there were only two Englishmen in episcopal sees, and by the time of William's death in 1089, there was only one, [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan II]] of Worcester.&lt;ref name=Barlow57&gt;Barlow ''English Church, 1066–1154'' p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Ealdred did much to restore discipline in the monasteries and churches under his authority,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barlow122/&gt; and was liberal with gifts to the churches of his diocese. He built the monastic church of St Peter at [[Gloucester]] (now [[Gloucester Cathedral]], though nothing of his fabric remains), then part of his diocese of Worcester. He also repaired a large part of [[Beverley Minster]] in the diocese of York, adding a [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]] and an unusually splendid painted ceiling covering &quot;all the upper part of the church from the choir to the tower…intermingled with gold in various ways, and in a wonderful fashion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell ''Anglo-Saxon Art'' p. 93, quoting the ''Chronica Ecclesiae Eboracensis'' (York chronicle). None of these works remain&lt;/ref&gt; He added a pulpit &quot;in German style&quot; of bronze, gold and silver, surmounted by an arch with a [[rood]] cross in the same materials; these were examples of the lavish decorations added to important churches in the years before the conquest.&lt;ref name=Edward198/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell ''Anglo-Saxon Art'' p. 65 and note 151 on pp. 264–265&lt;/ref&gt;

Ealdred encouraged Folcard, a monk of [[Canterbury Cathedral|Canterbury]], to write the ''Life'' Saint [[John of Beverley]].&lt;ref name=DNBJB&gt;Palliser &quot;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14845 John of Beverley (St John of Beverley) (d. 721)]&quot; (fee required) ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of Ealdred's promotion of the cult of Saint John,&lt;ref name=Blair314&gt;Blair ''The Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; who had only been canonized in 1037.  Along with the ''Pontificale'', Ealdred may have brought back from Cologne the first manuscript of the ''[[Cambridge Songs]]'' to enter England, a collection of Latin [[Goliard]]ic songs which became famous in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=ASEnc&gt;Lapidge &quot;Ealdred&quot; ''Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Michael Lapidge suggests that the ''Laudes Regiae'', which are included in Cotton Vitellius E xii, might have been composed by Ealdred, or a member of his household. Another historian, H. J. Cowdrey, argued that the ''laudes'' were composed at Winchester. These praise songs are likely the same performed at Matilda's coronation, but might have been used at other court ceremonies before Ealdred's death.&lt;ref name=Cotton16&gt;Lapidge &quot;Ealdred of York&quot; ''Yorkshire Archaeological Journal'' pp. 16–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have seen Ealdred as an &quot;old-fashioned prince-bishop&quot;.&lt;ref name=Loyn62&gt;Loyn ''English Church'' p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that he &quot;raised the see of York from its former rustic state&quot;.&lt;ref name=QHarper168&gt;Harper-Bill &quot;Anglo-Norman Church&quot; ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;  He was known for his generosity and for his diplomatic and administrative abilities.&lt;ref name=Loyn62/&gt; After the Conquest, Ealdred provided a degree of continuity between the pre- and post-Conquest worlds.&lt;ref name=Loyn67&gt;Loyn ''English Church'' p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; One modern historian feels that it was Ealdred who was behind the compilation of the D version of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', and gives a date in the 1050s as its composition.&lt;ref name=Lawson62fn34&gt;Lawson ''Battle of Hastings'' p. 62 footnote 34&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, Ealdred is one of the leading figures in the work, and it is likely that one of his clerks compiled the version.&lt;ref name=Wormald130&gt;Wormald ''Making of English Law'' pp. 130–131&lt;/ref&gt;

He came at an early age to the court of [[Philip II of Macedon]], and after the Grecian fashion became the object of his attachment. Philip in requital made him king of Epirus, after dethroning his uncle [[Arymbas]]. When Olympias was repudiated by her husband, 337 BC, she went to her brother, and endeavoured to induce him to make war on Philip.

Philip, however, declined the contest, and formed a second alliance with Alexander I by giving him his daughter (Alexander I's niece) [[Cleopatra of Macedonia|Cleopatra]] in marriage (336 BC). At the wedding Philip was assassinated by [[Pausanias of Orestis]]. In 334 BC, Alexander I, at the request of the Greek colony of [[Taranto|Taras]] (in [[Magna Graecia]]), crossed over into [[Italy]], to aid them in battle against several [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic tribes]], the [[Lucanians]] and [[Bruttii]]. After a victory over the [[Samnium|Samnites]] and Lucanians near [[Paestum]], 332 BC, he made a treaty with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]]. Success still followed his arms. He took [[Heraclea (Lucania)|Heraclea]]  from the Lucanians, and [[Terina]] and Sipontum from the Bruttii. Through the treachery of some Lucanian exiles, he was compelled to engage under unfavourable circumstances near [[Pandosia (Epirus)|Padosia]], on the banks of the [[Acheron]], and was killed by the hand of one of the [[exile]]s, as he was crossing the river. He left a son, [[Neoptolemus II of Epirus|Neoptolemus]], and a daughter, Cadmea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Junianus Justinus|Justin]].

''Noctes Atticae'', xvii.21&lt;/ref&gt;

In a famous passage &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0026%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D19 Livy 9.19, Alternative history: Alexander the Great vs. Rome]&lt;/ref&gt; that is often considered the first specimen of [[Counterfactual history|alternative history]], [[Livy]] speculates what what would have been the outcome of a military showdown between [[Alexander the Great]] and the [[Roman Republic]]. He reports there that as Alexander of Epirus lay mortally wounded on the battlefield of [[Pandosia (Epirus)|Padosia]] he compared his fortunes to those of his famous nephew and said that the latter &quot;waged war against women&quot;.

'''Alexander Balas''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] '''{{Polytonic|Ἀλέξανδρoς Bάλας}}'''), ruler of the [[Greece|Greek]] [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid kingdom]] 150-146 BC, was a native of [[İzmir|Smyrna]] of humble origin, but gave himself out to be the son of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] and [[Laodice IV]] and heir to the Seleucid throne. Along with his sister [[Laodice VI]], the youngster Alexander was &quot;discovered&quot; by Heracleides, a former minister of Antiochus IV and brother of [[Timarchus]], an usurper in [[Medes|Media]] who had been executed by the reigning king [[Demetrius I of Syria|Demetrius I Soter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia  | last = Smith  | first = Philip Peter | authorlink =  | title = Alexander Balas | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]]  | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 114–115  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | location = Boston  | year = 1867  | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0123.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander's claims were recognized by the [[Roman Senate]], [[Ptolemy VI of Egypt|Ptolemy Philometor of Egypt]] and others. He married [[Cleopatra Thea]], a daughter of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]]. At first unsuccessful, Alexander finally defeated Demetrius Soter in 150 BC. Being now master of the empire, he is said to have abandoned himself to a life of debauchery. Whatever the truth behind this, the young king was forced to depend heavily on his Ptolemaic support and even struck portraits with the characteristic features of king [[Ptolemy I]].

Demetrius Soter's son [[Demetrius II of Syria|Demetrius II]] profited by the opportunity to regain the throne. Ptolemy Philometor, who was Alexander's father-in-law, went over to his side, and Alexander was defeated in the  [[battle of Antioch (145 BC)]] in Syria, sometimes known as the battle of the Oenoparus.

He fled for refuge to a [[Nabataea]]n prince, who murdered him and sent his head to Ptolemy Philometor, who had been mortally wounded in the engagement.

==Reign==
The accounts of his usurpation vary somewhat in minor points.  [[Diodorus Siculus]] tells us that on the assassination of his father, the tyrant [[Jason of Pherae]], in 370 BC, his brother Polydorus ruled for a year, and was then poisoned by Alexander, another brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;ds&quot;&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], xv. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Xenophon]], Polydorus was murdered by his brother Polyphron, and Polyphron, in 369 BC&lt;ref name=&quot;xh&quot;&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Hellenica]]'' vi. 4. ~ 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This date is at variance with [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (vi. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wess&quot;&gt;Wesseling, ''On [[Diodorus Siculus]]'' xv. 75&lt;/ref&gt; murdered by Alexander—his nephew, according to [[Plutarch]], who relates also that Alexander worshiped the spear he slew his uncle with as if it were a god.&lt;ref name=&quot;wess&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Pelop.'' p. 293, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander governed tyrannically, and according to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ds&quot;/&gt; differently from the former rulers, but Polyphron, at least, seems to have set him the example.&lt;ref name=&quot;xh&quot;/&gt;  The states of [[Thessaly]], however, which had acknowledged the authority of [[Jason of Pherae]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ds&quot;/&gt; were not so willing to submit to the oppression of Alexander the tyrant, and they applied therefore (and especially the old family of the [[Aleuadae]] of [[Larissa]], who had most reason to fear him) to [[Alexander II of Macedon]].

The tyrant, with his characteristic energy, prepared to meet his enemy in [[Macedon]]ia, but the king anticipated him, and, reaching [[Larissa]], was admitted into the city, obliged the Thessalian Alexander to flee to [[Pherae]], and left a garrison in Larissa, as well as in [[Crannon]], which had also come over to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ds&quot;/&gt;  But the Macedonian having retired, his friends in Thessaly feared the vengeance of Alexander, and sent for aid to [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], the policy of which was to check a neighbor who might otherwise become formidable, and [[Pelopidas]] was accordingly dispatched to aid them.  On the arrival of the latter at Larissa, whence according to Diodorus he dislodged the Macedonian garrison, Alexander presented himself and offered submission, but soon after escaped by flight, alarmed by the indignation Pelopidas expressed at the tales of his cruelty and tyrannical profligacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], xv. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;plut&quot;&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Pelop.'' p. 291-297, d.&lt;/ref&gt;

These events appear to refer to the early part of the year 368 BC.  In the summer of that year Pelopidas was again sent into [[Thessaly]], in consequence of fresh complaints against Alexander.  Accompanied by [[Ismenias]], he went merely as a negotiator, and without any military force, and venturing incautiously within the power of the tyrant, was seized by him and thrown into prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;plut&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ds2&quot;&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], xv. 71-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]], viii. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  The scholar [[William Mitford]] suggested that Pelopidas was taken prisoner in battle, but the language of [[Demosthenes]] hardly supports such an inference.&lt;ref name=&quot;demo&quot;&gt;[[Demosthenes]], ''Against Aristocrates'' p. 660&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Mitford]], ''History of Greece'' ch. 27. sec. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The Thebans sent a large army into Thessaly to rescue Pelopidas, but they could not keep the field against the superior cavalry of Alexander, who, aided by auxiliaries from [[Athens]], pursued them with great slaughter; and the destruction of the whole Theban army is said to have been averted only by the ability of [[Epaminondas]], who was serving in the campaign, but not as general.

The next year, 367 BC, was initiated by a specimen of Alexander's treacherous cruelty, in the massacre of the citizens of [[Skotousa]];&lt;ref name=&quot;plut&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ds2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' vi. 5&lt;/ref&gt; and also by another expedition of the Thebans under [[Epaminondas]] into [[Thessaly]], to rescue Pelopidas.  According to [[Plutarch]], Alexander did not dare offer resistance, and was glad to purchase even a thirty days' truce by the delivery of the prisoners.&lt;ref name=&quot;plut&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ds2&quot;/&gt;  During the next three years, Alexander seemed to renew his attempts against the states of Thessaly, especially [[Magnesia Prefecture|Magnesia]] and [[Phthiotis]],&lt;ref name=&quot;plut&quot;/&gt; for at the end of that time, 364 BC, they again apply to Thebes for protection from him.  The army appointed to march under Pelopidas is said to have been dismayed by an [[eclipse]] (on June 13, 364), and Pelopidas, leaving it behind, entered Thessaly at the head of three hundred volunteer horsemen and some mercenaries.  A battle ensued at [[Battle of Cynoscephalae|Cynoscephalae]], wherein Pelopidas was himself slain, but defeated Alexander;&lt;ref name=&quot;plut&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ds3&quot;&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], xv. 80&lt;/ref&gt; and this victory was closely followed by another of the Thebans under Malcites and Diogiton, who obliged Alexander to restore the conquered towns to the Thessalians, confine himself to Pherae, join the [[Boeotian League]], and become a dependent ally of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;xh&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;plut&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ds3&quot;/&gt;

If the death of [[Epaminondas]] in 362 BC freed Athens from fear of Thebes, it appears at the same time to have exposed it to further aggression from Alexander, who made a [[piracy|piratical]] raid on [[Tinos]] and other cities of the [[Cyclades]], plundering them, and making slaves of the inhabitants.  He besieged [[Peparethus]] too, and &quot;even landed troops in Attica itself, and seized the port of Panormus, a little eastward of [[Sounion]].&quot;  [[Leosthenes]], the Athenian admiral, defeated him, and relieved Peparethus, but Alexander delivered his men from a blockade in Panormus, took several Attic [[trireme]]s, and plundered the [[Piraeus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wess&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], xv. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Polyaenus]], vi. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]], ''c. Polycl.'' pp. 1207-1208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Connop Thirlwall]], ''History of Greece'' vol. v. p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
The murder of Alexander is assigned by [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] to 367 BC.  [[Plutarch]] gives a detailed account of it, with a lively picture of the palace.  Guards watched throughout the night, except at Alexander's bedchamber, which was at the top of a ladder with a ferocious chained dog guarding the door.  Thebe, Alexander's wife and cousin (or half-sister, as the daughter of [[Jason of Pherae]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;plut&quot;/&gt; concealed her three brothers in the house during the day, had the dog removed when Alexander had gone to rest, and, having covered the steps of the ladder with wool, brought up the young men to her husband's chamber.  Though she had taken away Alexander's sword, they feared to set about the deed until she threatened to wake him.  Her brothers then entered and killed Alexander.  His body was cast into the streets, and exposed to every indignity.

Of Thebe's motive for the murder different accounts are given.  [[Plutarch]] states it to have been fear of her husband, together with hatred of his cruel and brutal character, and ascribes these feelings principally to the representations of Pelopidas, when she visited him in his prison.  In [[Cicero]] the deed is ascribed to jealousy.  Other accounts have it that Alexander had taken Thebe's youngest brother as his [[eromenos]] and tied him up.

'''Alexander II''' was a king of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], and the son of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] and [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]], the daughter of the Sicilian tyrant [[Agathocles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Mason | first = Charles Peter | authorlink = | title = Alexander | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 116 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=acl3129.0001.001;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=131;page=root;view=image}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==
[[Image:Coin of Alexander II of Epirus.png|right|thumb|200px|Illustration of silver coin of Alexander.]]
He succeeded his father as king in [[272 BC]], and continued the war which his father had begun with [[Antigonus II Gonatas]], whom he succeeded in driving from the kingdom of [[Macedon]].  He was, however, dispossessed of both [[Macedon]] and [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] by [[Demetrius II of Macedon]], the son of [[Antigonus]]; upon which he took refuge amongst the [[Acarnania]]ns. By their assistance and that of his own subjects, who entertained a great attachment for him, he recovered Epirus. It appears that he was in alliance with the [[Aetolia]]ns.  He married his sister [[Olympias]], by whom he had two sons, [[Pyrrhus]] and Ptolemy, and a daughter, Phthia.  On the death of Alexander, around [[242 BC]], Olympias assumed the regency on behalf of her sons, and married Phthia to [[Demetrius]].&lt;ref&gt;''Universal Pronouncing Dictionary of Biography and Mythology'', by Joseph Thomas - 1908 - page 90&lt;/ref&gt;  There are extant silver and copper coins of this king.  The former bear a youthful head covered with the skin of an elephant's head.  The reverse represents Pallas holding a spear in one hand and a shield in the other, and before her stands an eagle on a thunderbolt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justin]], xvii. 1, xxvi. 2, 3, xxviii. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]],  ii. 45, ix. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Pyrrhus'' 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with India==
Alexander is apparently mentioned in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], as one of the recipients of the Indian Emperor [[Ashoka the Great|Ashoka]]'s [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] proselytism, although no Western historical record of this event remains.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The conquest by [[Dharma]] has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred [[yojana]]s (5,400-9,600 km) away, where the Greek king [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochos]] rules, beyond there where the four kings named [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]], [[Antigonus Gonatas|Antigonos]], [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] and Alexander rule, likewise in the south among the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]]s, the [[Pandya]]s, and as far as [[Tamraparni]] ([[Sri Lanka]]).&quot; ([[Edicts of Ashoka]], 13th Rock Edict, S. Dhammika).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander''' ({{lang-lt|Aleksandras Jogailaitis}}; {{lang-pl|Aleksander Jagiellończyk}}) (5 August 1461 – 19 August 1506) of the [[House of Jagiellon]] was the Grand Duke of [[Lithuania]] and later also King of [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical dictionary of Poland, 966-1945|author=Jerzy Jan Lerski, Piotr Wróbel, Richard J. Kozicki|year=1996|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FPxhOu_n1VYC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Alexander+Jagiellon+1461&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=opera#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] | isbn=978-0-313-26007-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fourth son of [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]]. He was elected Grand Duke of Lithuania on the death of his father (1492), and King of Poland on the death of his brother [[Jan I Olbracht]] (1501).

==Biography==
[[File:Alexander of Poland.PNG|thumb|left|painting by [[Marcello Bacciarelli]]]]

Alexander's shortage of funds immediately made him subservient to the Polish Senate and nobility ([[szlachta]]), who deprived him of control of the mint (then one of the most lucrative sources of revenue for the Polish kings), curtailed his prerogatives, and generally endeavored to reduce him to a subordinate position.  For want of funds, Alexander was unable to resist the Grand Master of the [[Teutonic Knights]] or prevent Grand Duke of Muscovy [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] from ravaging [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] with the [[Tatars]].  The most the Grand Duke of Lithuania could do was to garrison [[Smolensk]] and other strongholds and employ his wife Helena, the Tsar's daughter, to mediate a truce between his father-in-law and himself after the disastrous [[Battle of Vedrosha]] (1500). In the terms of the truce, Lithuania had to surrender about a third of its territory to the nascent expansionist Russian state.

During his reign, Poland suffered much humiliation at the hands of her subject principality, [[Moldavia]].  Only the death of [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen]], the great ''[[hospodar]]'' of Moldavia, enabled Poland still to hold her own on the [[Danube River]]; while the liberality of [[Pope Julius II]], who issued no fewer than 29 bulls in favor of Poland and granted Alexander [[Peter's Pence]] and other financial help, enabled him to restrain somewhat the arrogance of the Teutonic Order.

Alexander Jagellon never felt at home in Poland, and bestowed his favor principally upon his fellow Lithuanians, the most notable of whom was the wealthy Lithuanian magnate [[Michael Glinski]], who justified his master's confidence by his great victory over the Tatars at [[Kleck]] (5 August 1506), news of which was brought to Aleksander on his deathbed in [[Vilnius]].  There is some evidence that he had at least one son, leading to a surviving Jagiellonian branch, although this is not conclusive.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

It is important to note that Alexander was the last known ruler of the [[Gediminids]] dynasty to have maintained the family's ancestral [[Lithuanian language]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} From his death, Polish became the sole language of the family, thus fully [[Polonisation|Polonising]] the [[Jagiello]] family.

In 1931, during the refurbishment of [[Vilnius Cathedral]], the forgotten sarcophagus of Alexander was discovered, and has since been put on display.

'''Alexander II''' ({{lang-ru|Александр II Николаевич}}, Aleksandr  II Nikolaevich) ({{OldStyleDate|29 April|1818|17 April}}, Moscow – {{OldStyleDate|13 March|1881|1 March}}, [[Saint Petersburg]]), also known as '''Alexander the Liberator''' ({{lang-ru|Александр Освободитель}}, Aleksandr Osvoboditel') was the [[List of Russian rulers|Emperor]] of the [[Russian Empire]] from 3 March 1855 until his [[assassination]] in 1881. He was also the [[King of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duke of Finland]].

==Early life==
Born in 1818, he was the eldest son of [[Nicholas I of Russia]] and [[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Charlotte of Prussia]], daughter of [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]]. His early life gave little indication of his ultimate potential; until the time of his accession in 1855, aged 37, few imagined that he would be known to posterity as a leader able to implement the most challenging reforms undertaken in Russia since the reign of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]].

In the period of his life as [[heir apparent]] the intellectual atmosphere of [[Saint Petersburg]] was unfavourable to any kind of change: [[freedom of thought]] and all forms of private initiative were being suppressed vigorously. Personal and official [[censorship]] was rife; criticism of the authorities was regarded as a serious offence. Some 26 years after he had the opportunity of implementing changes he would, however, be assassinated in public by the [[Narodnaya Volya]] (People's Will) terrorist organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Edvard Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'' (Free Press: New York, 2005) pp. 261, 391 &amp; 404-421.&lt;/ref&gt;

His education as a future Tsar was carried out under the supervision of the liberal romantic poet and gifted translator [[Vasily Zhukovsky]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=52BmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22alexander+II+of+Russia%22+zhukovski&amp;dq=%22alexander+II+of+Russia%22+zhukovski&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=iDXoSKCyPILoyAS9hZ2nAg&amp;pgis=1 ''The McGraw-Hill encyclopedia of world biography, vol. 1.''] McGraw-Hill, 1973. ISBN 978-0-07-079633-1; p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; grasping a smattering of a great many subjects, and becoming familiar with the chief modern [[European languages]].  His alleged lack of interest in military affairs detected by later historians could have been only his reflection on the results on his own family and on the effect on the whole country of the unsavoury [[Crimean War]].  Unusually for the time, the young Alexander was taken on a six-month tour of Russia, visiting 20 provinces in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Edvard Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: the Last Great Tsar'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also visited many prominent Western European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Edvardx Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'', pp. 65-69, 190-191 &amp; 199-200.&lt;/ref&gt;  As tsarevich, Alexander became the first Romanov heir to visit Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;Edvard Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==
Alexander II succeeded to the throne upon the death of his father in 1855. The first year of his reign was devoted to the prosecution of the [[Crimean War]] and, after the fall of [[Sevastopol]], to negotiations for peace, led by his trusted counsellor [[Alexander Gorchakov|Prince Gorchakov]]. The country had been exhausted and humiliated by the war.&lt;ref&gt;Edvard Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'', p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bribe-taking, theft and corruption were everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Edvard, Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'' p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Encouraged by public opinion he began a period of radical reforms, including an attempt to not to depend on a landed aristocracy controlling the poor, a move to developing Russia's natural resources and to thoroughly reform all branches of the administration.
[[Image:Coronation of Tsar Alexander II -2.jpg|thumb|left|320px|&lt;center&gt;Painting by Mihály Zichy of the coronation of Tsar Alexander II and the [[Empress Maria Alexandrovna]], which took place on 26 August/7 September 1856 at the [[Cathedral of the Dormition|Dormition Cathedral]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]].

After Alexander became tsar in 1855, he maintained a generally liberal course. Despite this he was a target for numerous assassination attempts (1866, 1879, 1880). On {{OldStyleDate|13 March|1881|1 March}} members of the [[Narodnaya Volya]] (People's Will) party killed him with a bomb. The tsar had earlier in the day signed the Loris-Melikov constitution which would have created two legislative commissions made up of indirectly elected representatives, had it not been repealed by his reactionary successor [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], who succeeded him after his murder by the Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = This Day in History - 13 March 1881  | url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&amp;id=4833  | accessdate = 11 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emancipation of the serfs==
{{Main|Emancipation reform of 1861}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}

In spite of his obstinacy in playing the Russian autocrat, Alexander II acted willfully for several years, somewhat like a constitutional sovereign of the continental type.{{Specify|date=January 2011}} Soon after the conclusion of peace, important changes were made in legislation concerning industry and [[commerce]], and the new freedom thus afforded produced a large number of [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]]. Plans were formed for building a great network of [[railroad|railways]]—partly for the purpose of developing the natural resources of the country, and partly for the purpose of increasing its power for defence and attack.

The existence of [[serfdom]] was tackled boldly,{{Specify|date=January 2011}} taking advantage of a petition presented by the Polish [[landed proprietor]]s of the [[Lithuania]]n provinces and, hoping that their relations with the serfs might be regulated in a more satisfactory way (meaning in a way more satisfactory for the proprietors), he authorised the formation of committees &quot;for ameliorating the condition of the peasants&quot;, and laid down the principles on which the amelioration was to be effected.

This step was followed by one still more significant.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  Without consulting his ordinary advisers, Alexander ordered the Minister of the Interior to send a circular to the provincial governors of [[European Russia]], containing a copy of the instructions forwarded to the [[Governor-General|governor-general]] of Lithuania, praising the supposed generous, patriotic intentions of the Lithuanian landed proprietors, and suggesting that perhaps the landed proprietors of other provinces might express a similar desire. The hint was taken: in all provinces where serfdom existed, emancipation committees were formed.

But the emancipation was not merely a [[humanitarian]] question capable of being solved instantaneously by imperial ''[[ukase]]''. It contained very complicated problems, deeply affecting the economic, social and political future of the nation.

Alexander had to choose between the different measures recommended to him. Should the serfs become agricultural labourers dependent economically and administratively on the landlords, or should they be transformed into a class of independent communal proprietors?

The emperor gave his support to the latter project, and the Russian peasantry became one of the last groups of peasants in Europe to shake off serfdom.

The architects of the emancipation manifesto were Alexander's brother [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|Konstantin]], [[Yakov Rostovtsev]], and [[Nikolay Milyutin]].

On 3 March 1861, 6 years after his accession, the emancipation law was signed and published.

==Other reforms==
In response to the overwhelming defeat (1856) suffered by Russia in the [[Crimean War]], and to an awareness of military advances implemented in other European countries, the Russian government re-organised the [[army]] and [[navy]] and re-armed them . The changes included universal military conscription, introduced on 1 January 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Edvard Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'' p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;  Now sons of all the &quot;estates&quot; - rich and poor - had to serve in the military.&lt;ref&gt;Edvard Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other military reforms involved setting up an army reserve and the military district system (still in use a century later), the building of strategic railways, and an emphasis on the military education of the officer corps.  Corporal punishment in the military and branding of the soldiers as a punishment was banned.&lt;ref&gt;Edvard Radzinsky, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar'', pp. 150-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new judicial administration (1864) - based on the French model - introduced security of tenure.&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Russian History (1976), edited by Robert Auty and Dimitri Obolensky, chapter by John Keep, page 238&lt;/ref&gt; A new [[penal code]] and [[Judicial reform of Alexander II|a greatly simplified system of civil and criminal procedure]] also came into operation. Reorganisation of Judiciary, to include trial in open court, with judges appointed for life, a jury system and the creation of justices of the peace to deal with minor offences at local level.

Alexander's bureaucracy instituted an elaborate scheme of local self-government ([[Zemstvo]]) for the rural districts (1864) and the large towns (1870), with elective assemblies possessing a restricted right of [[taxation]], and a new rural and municipal [[police]] under the direction of the [[MVD (Russia)|Minister of the Interior]].

==Marriages and children==
{{Wikisource|Scribner's Monthly Magazine/Volume 3/Issue 2/The Imperial Family of Russia|An intimate glimpse into the family life of Alexander II (1871)}}
[[Image:Cartetsar.JPG|thumb|right|200px|&lt;center&gt;Tsar Alexander II and his wife, Empress Maria, with their son, the future [[Tsar Alexander III]]]]

During his bachelor days, Alexander made a state visit to England in 1838. Just a year older than the young [[Queen Victoria]], Alexander's approaches to her were indeed short-lived. Victoria married her German cousin, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert of Saxe-Coburg]] in February 1840. On 16 April 1841, aged 23, Tsarevitch Alexander married [[Marie of Hesse and by Rhine|Princess Marie of Hesse]] in St Petersburg, thereafter known in Russia as [[Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Maria Alexandrovna]].

(Marie was the legal daughter of [[Ludwig II, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine]] and [[Wilhelmina of Baden|Princess Wilhelmina of Baden]], although some gossiping questioned whether the Grand Duke Ludwig or Wilhelmina's lover, [[August von Senarclens de Grancy|Baron August von Senarclens de Grancy]], was her biological father.{{citation}} Alexander was aware of the question of her [[Paternity (law)|paternity]]).

The marriage produced six sons and two daughters:
* [[Grand Duchess Alexandra Alexandrovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Alexandra Alexandrovna]] (30 August 1842 – 10 July 1849), nicknamed Lina, died of [[meningitis|infant meningitis]] in [[St. Petersburg]] at the age of six
* [[Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsarevich of Russia|Tsarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich]] (20 September 1843 – 24 April 1865), engaged to [[Dagmar of Denmark (Maria Feodorovna)]]
* [[Alexander III of Russia|Emperor Alexander III]] (10 March 1845 – 1 November 1894), married 1866, [[Dagmar of Denmark (Maria Feodorovna)]], had issue
* [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich]] (22 April 1847 – 17 February 1909), married 1874, [[Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (Maria Pavlovna)]], had issue
* [[Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich]] (14 January 1850 – 14 November 1908), had (presumably illegitimate) issue
* [[Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna]] (17 October 1853 – 20 October 1920) married 1874, [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], had issue
* [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich]] (29 April 1857 – 4 February 1905), married 1884, [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna|Elisabeth of Hesse (Elizabeth Feodorovna)]]
* [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich]] (3 October 1860 – 24 January 1919), married 1889, [[Alexandra Georgievna of Greece|Alexandra of Greece and Denmark (Alexandra Georgievna)]], had issue; second marriage 1902, [[Olga Valerianovna Paley|Olga Karnovich]], had issue

Alexander had many mistresses during his marriage and fathered seven known illegitimate children. These included:
* Charlotte Henriette Sophie Jansen (15 November 1844 – July 1915) with mistress Sophie Charlotte Dorothea Von Behse (1828–1886)
* Joseph Raboxicz
* Michael-Bogdan Oginski (10 October 1848 – 25 March 1909) with mistress Countess Olga Kalinovskya (1818–1854)
* Antoinette Bayer (20 June 1856 – 24 January 1948) with his mistress Wilhelmine Bayer
On 6 July 1880, less than a month after Tsarina Maria's death on 8 June, Alexander formed a [[morganatic marriage]] with his mistress Princess [[Catherine Dolgorukov]], with whom he already had four children:
* [[Prince George Alexandrovich Yurievsky|George Alexandrovich Romanov Yurievsky]] (12 May 1872 – 13 September 1913). Married Countess Alexandra Zarnekau and had issue. They later divorced.
* Olga Alexandrovna Yurievskaya (7 November 1874 – 10 August 1925). Married Count Georg Nikolaus of Nassau, [[Count of Merenberg]].
* Boris Alexandrovich Yurievsky (23 February 1876 – 11 April 1876).
* [[Catherine Yurievskaya|Catherine Alexandrovna Yurievskaya]] (9 September 1878 – 22 December 1959) Her first husband was the 23rd Prince [[Alexander Alexandrovich Bariatinski]], (1870–1910) the son of the 22nd Prince [[Alexander Vladimirovich Bariatinski]], (1848–1909). Her second husband, later divorced, was Prince [[Serge Obolensky]], (1890–1978).

==Suppression of separatist movements==

At the beginning of his reign, Alexander expressed the famous statement &quot;No dreams&quot; addressed to the Poles who inhabited [[Congress Poland]], Western [[Ukraine]], [[Lithuania]], [[Livonia]] and [[Belarus]]. The result was the [[January Uprising]] of 1863–1864 that was suppressed after eighteen months of fighting.

Hundreds of Poles were executed, and thousands were deported to [[Siberia]]. The price for suppression was Russian support for [[Unification of Germany|Prussian-united Germany]]. Years later, Germany and Russia became enemies.

All territories of the former [[Poland-Lithuania]] were excluded from liberal policies introduced by Alexander. The [[martial law]] in Lithuania, introduced in 1863, lasted for the next 40 years. Native languages, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] were completely banned from printed texts, see e.g. the [[Ems Ukase]]. The [[Polish language]] was banned in both oral and written form from all provinces except [[Congress Poland]], where it was allowed in private conversations only.

==Encouraging Finnish nationalism within Russia==
[[Image:Alexander II (Romanov) monument in Helsinki, Finland.jpg|thumb|left|240px|&lt;center&gt;The monument to Alexander II &quot;The Liberator&quot; at the [[Helsinki Senate Square#Statue of Alexander II|Senate Square]] in Helsinki was erected in 1894, 13 years after the assassination of Alexander II. At that time, Finland was still a Russian grand duchy. The date &quot;1863&quot; refers to the reopening of the [[Diet of Finland]]. This monument, expressing the Finns' gratitude to this Tsar, survived unharmed through many later periods of tension and war with Russia under various of its later regimes.]]

In 1863 Alexander II re-established the [[Diet of Finland]] and initiated several reforms increasing Finland's autonomy from Russia including establishment of its own [[currency]], the ''[[Markka]]''. Liberation of business led to increased [[Foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] and industrial development.

Finally, the elevation of [[Finnish language|Finnish]] from a language of the common people to a [[national language]] equal to [[Finland Swedish|Swedish]] opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Alexander II is still regarded as &quot;The Good Tsar&quot; in Finland.

These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia. They may also be seen as a reward for the loyalty of its relatively western-oriented population during the [[Crimean war]] and during the [[January Uprising|Polish uprising]]. Encouraging Finnish [[nationalism]] and language can also be seen as an attempt to dilute ties with Sweden.

==Rule during the Russian-Caucasian War==
It was during Alexander II's rule that the Russian Caucasian war reached its climax. Just before the conclusion of the war with a victory on Russia's side, the Russian Army, under the Czar's order, sought to eliminate the [[Adyghe people|mountaineers]] in what would be often referred to as &quot;cleansing&quot; in several historic dialogues.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Abramov,[http://www.circassianworld.com/RU/CaucasianMountaineers.html ''Caucasian Mountaineers, Materials For the History of Circassian People''], 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justin McCarthy, ''Death and Exile, the Ethnic Cleansing of Ottoman Muslims'', 1821-1922, Princeton, NJ, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination attempts==
In 1866, there was an attempt on the czar's life in [[St. Petersburg]] by [[Dmitry Karakozov]]. To commemorate his narrow escape from death (which he himself referred to only as &quot;the event of 4 April 1866&quot;), a number of churches and chapels were built in many Russian cities. [[Viktor Hartmann]], a Russian architect, even sketched a design of a monumental gate (planned, never built) to commemorate the event. [[Modest Mussorgsky]] later wrote his [[Pictures at an Exhibition]]; the last movement of which, &quot;The Great Gate of Kiev&quot;, is based on Hartmann's sketches.

On the morning of 20 April 1879, Alexander II was briskly walking towards the Square of the Guards Staff and faced [[Alexander Soloviev (Revolutionary)|Alexander Soloviev]], a 33-year-old former student. Having seen a menacing revolver in his hands, the Tsar fled. Soloviev fired five times but missed, and was sentenced to death and hanged on 28 May.

The student acted on his own, but other revolutionaries were keen to murder Alexander. In December 1879, the [[Narodnaya Volya]] (People's Will), a radical revolutionary group which hoped to ignite a [[social revolution]], organised an explosion on the railway from [[Livadiya, Ukraine|Livadia]] to Moscow, but they missed the tsar's train.

On the evening of 5 February 1880 [[Stephan Khalturin]], also from Narodnaya Volya, set off a charge under the dining room of the [[Winter Palace]], right in the resting room of the guards a story below. Being late for dinner, the tsar was unharmed; although 11 other people were killed and 30 wounded.

==Assassination==

[[File:AttentatmotalexanderII.jpg|thumb|right|The assassination of Alexander II. Drawing by G. Broling 1881]]

{{Main|Narodnaya Volya|Pervomartovtsi}}
After the last assassination attempt in February 1880, [[Michael Tarielovich, Count Loris-Melikov|Count Loris-Melikov]] was appointed the head of the Supreme Executive Commission and given extraordinary powers to fight the revolutionaries. Loris-Melikov's proposals called for some form of parliamentary body, and the Emperor seemed to agree; these plans were never realized.

On 13 March (1 March [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style Date]]), 1881, Alexander fell victim to an [[assassination]] plot in [[Saint Petersburg]].

As he was known to do every Sunday for many years, the czar went to the [[Mikhailovsky Manège]] for the military [[roll call]]. He travelled both to and from the Manège in a closed carriage accompanied by six [[Cossacks]] with a seventh sitting on the coachman's left. The tzar's carriage was followed by two sleighs carrying, among others, the chief of police and the chief of the czar's guards. The route, as always, was via the [[Catherine Canal]] and over the [[Pevchesky Bridge]].

The street was flanked by narrow sidewalks for the public. A young member of the [[Narodnaya Volya]] (&quot;People's Will&quot;) movement, [[Nikolai Rysakov]], was carrying a small white package wrapped in a handkerchief.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;After a moment's hesitation I threw the bomb. I sent it under the horses' hooves in the supposition that it would blow up under the carriage...The explosion knocked me into the fence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Radzinsky, Edvard, ''Alexander II: The Last Great Czar'',(Freepress 2005) p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The explosion, while killing one of the [[Cossacks]] and seriously wounding the driver and people on the sidewalk, had only damaged the [[Bulletproofing|bulletproof]] carriage, a gift from [[Napoleon III]] of France. The tsar emerged shaken but unhurt. Rysakov was captured almost immediately. Police Chief [[Dvorzhitsky]] heard Rysakov shout out to someone else in the gathering crowd. The surrounding guards and the Cossacks urged the tsar to leave the area at once rather than being shown the site of the explosion. 

Nevertheless, a second young member of the Narodnaya Volya, [[Ignaty Grinievitsky]], standing by the canal fence, raised both arms and threw something at the tsar's feet. He was alleged to have shouted, &quot;It is too early to thank God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Robert K. Massie, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', Dell Publishing Company, New York, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Dvorzhitsky was later to write:
[[Image:Church of the Savior on Blood.jpg|thumb|220px|left|The [[Church of the Savior on Blood]] commemorates the spot where Czar Alexander II was assassinated.]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;I was deafened by the new explosion, burned, wounded and thrown to the ground. Suddenly, amid the smoke and snowy fog, I heard His Majesty's weak voice cry, 'Help!' Gathering what strength I had, I jumped up and rushed to the tsar. His Majesty was half-lying, half-sitting, leaning on his right arm. Thinking he was merely wounded heavily, I tried to lift him but the czar's legs were shattered, and the blood poured out of them. Twenty people, with wounds of varying degree, lay on the sidewalk and on the street. Some managed to stand, others to crawl, still others tried to get out from beneath bodies that had fallen on them. Through the snow, debris, and blood you could see fragments of clothing, epaulets, sabers, and bloody chunks of human flesh.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Radzinsky, (2005) p. 415&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later it was learned there was a third bomber in the crowd. [[Ivan Emelyanov]] stood ready, clutching a briefcase containing a bomb that would be used if the other two bombers failed.

Alexander was carried by sleigh to the [[Winter Palace]] to his study where ironically, twenty years before almost to the day, he had signed the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|Emancipation Edict]] freeing the serfs. Alexander was bleeding to death, with his legs torn away, his stomach ripped open, and his face mutilated.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Romanov family]] came rushing to the scene.

The dying czar was given [[Eucharist|Communion]] and [[Extreme Unction]]. When the attending physician, [[Sergei Botkin|Dr. S. P. Botkin]], was asked how long it would be, he replied &quot;Up to fifteen minutes&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Radzinsky, (2005) p. 419&lt;/ref&gt;
At 3:30 that day the standard (Alexander's personal flag) of Alexander II was lowered for the last time.

==Aftermath==
The assassination caused a great setback for the reform movement. One of Alexander II's last ideas was to draft plans for an elected parliament, or [[Duma]], which were completed the day before he died but not yet released to the Russian people. In a matter of 48 hours, Alexander II planned to release his plan for the duma to the Russian people. Had he lived, Russia might have followed a path to constitutional monarchy instead of the long road of oppression that defined his successor's reign. The first action Alexander III took after his coronation was to tear up those plans. A [[Duma]] would not come into fruition until 1905, when Alexander II's grandson, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], commissioned the Duma following extreme pressure on the monarchy as a result of the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]].

A second consequence of the assassination was anti-Jewish [[pogrom]]s and [[May Laws|legislation]].

A third consequence of the assassination was that suppression of civil liberties in Russia and [[police brutality]] burst back in full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of Alexander II. Alexander II's murder and subsequent death was witnessed first-hand by his son, [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], and his grandson, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], both future Czars, who vowed not to have the same fate befall them. Both used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups, creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people.

Finally, the assassination inspired [[anarchism|anarchists]] to advocate &quot;'[[propaganda by the deed|propaganda by deed]]'—the use of a spectacular act of violence to incite revolution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Brian (2010-12-29) [http://www.slate.com/id/2279457/ What do anarchists want from us?], ''[[Slate.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alexander II and his dog Milord 1870 by Sergei Lvovich Levitsky.JPG|thumb|right|200px|&lt;center&gt;Alexander II and his dog Milord 1870 by [[Sergei Lvovich Levitsky]] (The Di Rocco Wieler Private Collection, Toronto, Canada)]]

==Alexander II's dog, Milord==

A favorite dog of Alexander II was an [[Irish Setter]] named Milord.&lt;ref name=irish&gt;Charcot, Gennadi, &quot;[http://www.irishredsetterclub.com/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=85:irish-red-setter-in-russia&amp;catid=42:red-setters-abroad&amp;Itemid=66 Irish Red Setter In Russia]&quot;, [http://www.irishredsetterclub.com/home/index.php Irish Red Setter Club], St. Petersburg, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
Contemporaries wrote that Milord was a Black Setter, but now it is understood to have been a [[Red Setter]] with black color on the tips of its hair - which gave the dog a black color with a red nuance.&lt;ref name=irish/&gt;

Milord was given to Czar Alexander by a Polish landowner, and was said not to be [[Purebred (dog)|pure bred]]. Evidently that fact did not upset Alexander, as it was was said that he never parted from the dog - not even for a second.&lt;ref name=irish/&gt;

Many citizens of Saint Petersburg came to know the figure of the Czar - a tall stately man, who frequently walked with his Setter along the lattice of the [[Summer Garden]]. Milord was likely the most famous animal in the Russian Empire at that time.&lt;ref name=irish/&gt;

The personal doctor of the Czar Alexander II supposedly also owned an Irish Setter,  and when she had a litter, one puppy was given to Russian author [[Leo Tolstoy]] - who raised the dog at his estate, [[Yasnaya Polyana]].&lt;ref name=irish/&gt;

==In fiction==
Alexander II appears prominently in the opening two chapters of [[Jules Verne]]'s &quot;[[Michael Strogoff]]&quot; (published in 1876, i.e. during Alexander's own lifteime). He sets the book's plot in motion and sends its eponymous protagonist on the dangerous and vital mission which would occupy the rest of the book. Verne presents Alexander II in a highly positive light, as an enlightened yet firm monarch, dealing confidently and decisively with a rebellion. Alexander's liberalism is emphasised in a dialogue with the chief of police who says &quot;''There was a time, sire, when NONE returned from Siberia''&quot; to be immediately rebuked by the Tsar who answers:
&quot;''Well, whilst I live, Siberia is and shall be a country whence men CAN return.''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[[s:Michael Strogoff/Chapter II|Jules Verne, &quot;Michael Strogoff&quot;, Ch. 2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[The Tiger in the Well]], [[Philip Pullman]] referred to the assassination—though he never named Alexander—and the pogroms that followed. The anti-Jewish attacks play an important role in the novel's plot.

==In Nonfiction==
[[Mark Twain]] describes a short visit with Alexander II in Chapter 37 of ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'', describing him as “very tall and spare, and a determined-looking man, though a very pleasant-looking one nevertheless. It is easy to see that he is kind and affectionate. There is something very noble in his expression when his cap is off.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Alexander III Alexandrovich''' ({{OldStyleDate|10 March|1845|26 February}} – {{OldStyleDate|1 November|1894|20 October}}) ({{lang-ru|Александр III Александрович}}, Aleksandr III Aleksandrovich), also known as '''Alexander the Peacemaker''' ({{lang-ru|Александр Миротворец}}, Aleksandr Mirotvorets) reigned as [[Tsar|Emperor]] of [[Russia]] from 13 March 1881 until his death in 1894.

==Early life==
[[Image:Tsarevitch Alexander later Alexander III 1865 by Sergei Levitsky.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Tsarevitch Alexander later Alexander III. by [[Sergei Lvovich Levitsky]].(1865) The Di Rocco Wieler Private Collection, Toronto, Canada]]Alexander III was born in [[Saint Petersburg]], the second son of Czar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] by his wife [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine]].

In disposition, he bore little resemblance to his soft-hearted, liberal father, and still less to his refined, philosophic, sentimental, chivalrous, yet cunning granduncle [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], who coveted the title of &quot;the first gentleman of [[Europe]]&quot;.

Although an enthusiastic amateur musician and patron of the ballet, he was seen as lacking refinement and elegance. Indeed, he rather relished the idea of being of the same rough texture as the great majority of his subjects.

His straightforward, abrupt manner savoured sometimes of gruffness, while his direct, unadorned method of expressing himself harmonized well with his rough-hewn, immobile features and somewhat sluggish movements. His education was not such as to soften these peculiarities.

He was also noted for his immense physical strength, though the large wen on the left side of his nose caused him to be severely mocked by his contemporaries. He always sat for photographs and portraits with the right side of his face most prominent.

Perhaps an account from the memoirs of the artist [[Alexander Benois]] best describes an impression of Alexander III:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After a performance of the ballet '[[Tsar Kandavl]]' at the [[Mariinsky Theatre]], I first caught sight of the Emperor. I was struck by the size of the man, and although cumbersome and heavy, he was still a mighty figure. There was indeed something of the [[muzhik]] ''[Russian peasant]'' about him. The look of his bright eyes made quite an impression on me. As he passed where I was standing, he raised his head for a second, and to this day I can remember what I felt as our eyes met. It was a look as cold as steel, in which there was something threatening, even frightening, and it struck me like a blow. The Tsar's gaze! The look of a man who stood above all others, but who carried a monstrous burden and who every minute had to fear for his life and the lives of those closest to him. In later years I came into contact with the Emperor on several occasions, and I felt not the slightest bit timid. In more ordinary cases Tsar Alexander III could be at once kind, simple, and even almost homely.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Education==
Though he was destined to be one of the great counter-reforming Tsars, during the first twenty years of his life, Alexander had little prospect of succeeding to the throne, because he had an elder brother, [[Grand Duke Nicholas Alexandrovich of Russia|Nicholas]], who seemed of robust constitution.

Even when this elder brother first showed symptoms of delicate health, the notion that he might die young was never seriously taken; Nicholas was betrothed to the Princess [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dagmar of Denmark]].

Under these circumstances, the greatest solicitude was devoted to the education of Nicholas as Tsarevich, whereas Alexander received only the perfunctory and inadequate training of an ordinary Grand Duke of that period, which did not go much beyond secondary instruction, with practical acquaintance in [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], and a certain amount of [[military drill]].

==Rise to power==
Alexander became [[heir apparent]] with the sudden death of his elder brother in 1865.

It was then that he began to study the principles of law and administration under [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], then a professor of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] at [[Moscow State University]] and later (from 1880) [[chief procurator]] of the [[Holy Synod]].

Pobedonostsev awakened in his pupil very little love of abstract studies or prolonged intellectual exertion, but he did influence the character of Alexander's reign by instilling into the young man's mind the belief that zeal for [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] thought was an essential factor of Russian [[patriotism]] and that this was to be specially cultivated by every right-minded Tsar.

[[File:Szásakoronázása.jpg|thumb|right|390px|&lt;center&gt;Portrait by the artist Georges Becker of the coronation of Tsar Alexander III and [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Empress Maria Fyodorovna]], which took place on {{OldStyleDate|27 May|1883|15 May}} at the [[Cathedral of the Dormition|Uspensky Sobor]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]]. On the left of the dais can be seen his young son and heir, [[Nicholas II of Russia|the Tsarevich Nicholas]], and behind Nicholas can be seen a young [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke George]].]]

On his deathbed, Alexander's elder brother Nicholas is said to have expressed the wish that his affianced bride, Princess Dagmar of Denmark, should marry his successor.
[[Image:Tsarevitch Alexander later Alexander III and Princess Dagmar of Denmark 1865 by Sergei Levitsky.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Tsarevitch Alexander later Alexander III and Princess Dagmar of Denmark 1865. by [[Sergei Lvovich Levitsky]].(1865) The Di Rocco Wieler Private Collection, Toronto, Canada]]
This wish was swiftly realized, when on {{OldStyleDate|9 November|1866|28 October}} in the Imperial Chapel of the [[Winter Palace]] in [[St. Petersburg]], Alexander wed the Princess of [[Denmark]].

The union proved a most happy one and remained unclouded to the end. Unlike that of his parents, there was no adultery in the marriage.

During those years when he was heir-apparent&amp;mdash;1865 to 1881&amp;mdash;Alexander did not play a prominent part in public affairs, but he allowed it to become known that he had certain ideas of his own which did not coincide with the principles of the existing government.

==Foreign relations==
Alexander deprecated what he considered undue foreign influence in general, and German influence in particular, so the adoption of genuine national principles was off in all spheres of official activity, with a view to realizing his ideal of a homogeneous Russia&amp;mdash;homogeneous in language, administration and religion. With such ideas and aspirations he could hardly remain permanently in cordial agreement with his father, who, though a good patriot according to his lights, had strong German sympathies, often used the German language in his private relations, occasionally ridiculed the exaggerations and eccentricities of the [[Slavophiles]] and based his foreign policy on the Prussian alliance.

The antagonism first appeared publicly during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], when the Tsar supported the cabinet of [[Berlin]] and the Tsarevich did not conceal his sympathies for the French. It reappeared in an intermittent fashion during the years 1875&amp;ndash;1879, when [[Eastern Question|the Eastern question]] produced so much excitement in all ranks of Russian Society. At first the Tsarevich was more Slavophile than the government, but his [[phlegmatic]] nature preserved him from many of the exaggerations indulged in by others, and any of the prevalent popular illusions he may have imbibed were soon dispelled by personal observation in [[Bulgaria]], where he commanded the left wing of the invading army.

Never consulted on political questions, he confined himself to his military duties and fulfilled them in a conscientious and unobtrusive manner. After many mistakes and disappointments, the army reached [[Constantinople]] and the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] was signed, but much that had been obtained by that important document had to be sacrificed at the [[Congress of Berlin]]. [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] failed to do what was confidently expected of him by the Russian Tsar.
[[Image:Shilder AlexanderIII.jpg|thumb|left|270px|&lt;center&gt;Portrait by [[Nikolay Shilder]] of Tsar Alexander III]]
In return for the Russian support, which had enabled him to create the [[German Empire]], {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} it was thought that he would help Russia to solve the Eastern question in accordance with her own interests, but to the surprise and indignation of the cabinet of Saint Petersburg he confined himself to acting the part of &quot;honest broker&quot; at the Congress, and shortly afterwards he ostentatiously contracted an alliance with [[Austria]] for the express purpose of counteracting Russian designs in [[Eastern Europe]]. The Tsarevich could point to these results as confirming the views he had expressed during the Franco-Prussian War, and he drew from them the practical conclusion that for Russia the best thing to do was to recover as quickly as possible from her temporary exhaustion and to prepare for future contingencies by a radical scheme of military and naval reorganization. In accordance with this conviction, he suggested that certain reforms should be introduced.

==Antisemitism==
Alexander III engaged in [[antisemitic]] policies such as tightening restrictions on where [[Jew]]s could live in the [[Pale of Settlement]] and restricting the occupations that Jews could attain. The [[pogrom]]s of 1881 occurred at the beginning of Alexander III's reign. Antisemitic policies under both Alexander III and his successor, [[Nicholas II]], encouraged the Jewish [[immigration to the United States|emigration to the United States]] from 1880 on. The administration of Alexander III enacted the [[May Laws]] in 1882 that imposed harsh conditions on the Jews as a people for the alleged role of some Jews in the assassination of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].

==Anti-reforms==
[[Image:Imperial Monogram of Tsar Alexander III of Russia.svg|thumb|left|100px|Imperial Monogram]]
During the campaign in Bulgaria he had found by painful experience that grave disorders and gross corruption existed in the military administration, and after his return to Saint Petersburg he had discovered that similar abuses existed in the naval department. For these abuses, several high-placed personages&amp;mdash;among others two of the grand-dukes&amp;mdash;were believed to be responsible, and he called his father's attention to the subject. His representations were not favourably received. Alexander II had lost much of the reforming zeal that distinguished the first decade of his reign, and had no longer the energy required to undertake the task suggested to him. The consequence was that the relations between father and son became more strained. The latter must have felt that there would be no important reforms until he himself succeeded to the direction of affairs. That change was much nearer at hand than was commonly supposed. On  13 March 1881 Alexander II was assassinated by a band of [[Nihilist movement|Nihilist]]s, [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]] (People's Will), and the autocratic power passed to the hands of his son.

In the last years of his reign, Alexander II had been very concerned by the spread of Nihilist doctrines and the increasing number of anarchist conspiracies, and for some time he had hesitated between strengthening the hand of the executive and making concessions to the widespread political aspirations of the educated classes. Finally he decided in favour of the latter course, and on the very day of his death he signed an ukaz creating a number of consultative commissions that might easily have been transformed into an assembly of notables.

Following the advice of his political mentor [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], Alexander III determined to adopt the opposite policy. He at once canceled the ukaz before it was published, and in the manifesto announcing his accession to the throne he let it be very clearly understood that he had no intention of limiting or weakening the autocratic power that he had inherited from his ancestors. Nor did he afterwards show any inclination to change his mind.

[[Image:Alexander-Maria.jpg|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Alexander and his wife [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Empress Maria Fyodorovna]] on holiday in Copenhagen in 1893.]]

All the internal reforms that he initiated were intended to correct what he considered as the too-liberal tendencies of the previous reign, so that he left behind him the reputation of a sovereign of the retrograde type. In his opinion Russia was to be saved from anarchical disorders and revolutionary agitation, not by the parliamentary institutions and so-called [[liberalism]] of [[western Europe]], but by the three principles that the elder generation of the Slavophils systematically recommended&amp;mdash;[[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality|nationality, Eastern Orthodoxy and autocracy]]. His political ideal was a nation containing only one nationality, one language, one religion and one form of administration; and he did his utmost to prepare for the realization of this ideal by imposing the Russian language and Russian schools on his German, Polish and other non-Russian subjects (with the exception of the Finns), by fostering Eastern Orthodoxy at the expense of other confessions, by persecuting the [[Jew]]s and by destroying the remnants of German, Polish and Swedish institutions in the outlying provinces. These policies were implemented by &quot;[[May Laws]]&quot; that banned [[Jew]]s from rural areas and [[shtetl]]s even within the [[Pale of Settlement]].

In the other provinces he sought to counteract what he considered the excessive liberalism of his father's reign. For this purpose he removed what little power was wielded by the [[zemstvo]], an elective local administration resembling the county and [[Parish councils in England|parish councils]] in England, and placed the autonomous administration of the peasant communes under the supervision of landed proprietors appointed by the government. These came to be known as [[land captains]], who were much feared and resented amongst the peasant communities throughout Russia. At the same time he sought to strengthen and centralize the Imperial administration and to bring it more under his personal control.

In foreign affairs he was emphatically a man of peace, but not at all a partisan of the doctrine of peace at any price, and he followed the principle that the best means of averting war is to be well prepared for it. Though indignant at the conduct of Prince Bismarck towards Russia, he avoided an open rupture with Germany, and even revived for a time the Three Emperors' Alliance.
[[File:Borki cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Borki Cathedral]] was one of many churches built all over the empire to commemorate the Tsar's &quot;miraculous&quot; survival in the train crash.]]
It was only in the last years of his reign, when [[Mikhail Katkov]] had acquired a certain influence over him, that he adopted a more hostile attitude towards the cabinet of [[Berlin]], and even then he confined himself to keeping a large number of troops near the German frontier, and establishing cordial relations with France. With regard to Bulgaria he exercised similar self-control. The efforts of Prince Alexander and afterwards of [[Stefan Stambolov|Stambolov]] to destroy Russian influence in the principality excited his indignation, but he persistently vetoed all proposals to intervene by force of arms.

With encouragement from the successful assassination of his father, [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], in 1881, the [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Peoples Will]] planned the murder of Tsar Alexander III. The plot was unsuccessful, one of the conspirators captured, [[Aleksandr Ulyanov]], was sentenced to death and hanged on 5 May 1887. Alexander Ulyanov was the brother of Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, who would later take the pseudonym [[Vladimir Lenin|V.I. Lenin]]. The Emperor also survived the [[Borki train disaster]] of 1888. At the moment of the crash the royal family was in the dining car. Its roof collapsed in the crash, and Alexander held the remains of the roof on his shoulders as the children fled outdoors. The onset of Alexander's [[kidney]] failure was later linked to the blunt trauma suffered at Borki.

In [[Central Asia]]n affairs he followed the traditional policy of gradually extending Russian domination without provoking a conflict with the [[United Kingdom]] (see [[Panjdeh Incident]]), and he never allowed the bellicose partisans of a forward policy to get out of hand. As a whole his reign cannot be regarded as one of the eventful periods of [[History of Russia|Russian history]]; but it must be admitted that under his hard, unsympathetic rule the country made considerable progress. Emperor Alexander and his Danish-born wife regularly spent their summers in their [[Langinkoski]] manor near [[Kotka]] on the [[Finland|Finnish]] coast, where their children were immersed in a Scandinavian lifestyle of relative modesty.

==Death and legacy==
Alexander III became ill with [[nephritis]] in 1894, and died of this disease at the [[Livadia Palace]] on 1 November 1894.  His remains were interred at the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].  He was succeeded by his eldest son [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]].

An [[equestrian statue]] of Tsar Alexander sculpted by [[Paolo Troubetzkoy]] once graced [[Znamenskaya Square]] in front of the [[Moscow Rail Terminal]] in [[St. Petersburg]]. It was later moved to the inner courtyard of the [[Marble Palace]]. Another memorial is located in the city of [[Irkutsk]] at the [[Angara River|Angara]] embankment.

'''Alexander I''' (c. 1078 &amp;ndash; 23 April 1124), also called '''Alaxandair mac Maíl Coluim''' ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Modern Gaelic]]: ''Alasdair mac Mhaol Chaluim'') and nicknamed &quot;The Fierce&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;This nickname however is not attested for another three centuries, in the work of [[Andrew of Wyntoun]].&lt;/ref&gt; was [[King of the Scots]] from 1107 to his death.

Alexander was the fourth son of [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]] by his wife [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret of Wessex]], grandniece of [[Edward the Confessor]]. Alexander was named for [[Pope Alexander II]].

He was the younger brother of King [[Edgar of Scotland|Edgar]], who was unmarried, and his brother's [[heir presumptive]] by 1104 (and perhabs earlier). In that year he was the senior layman present at the examination of the remains of [[Saint Cuthbert]] at [[Durham]] prior to their reinterrment. He held lands in Scotland north of the [[River Forth|Forth]] and in [[Lothian]].&lt;ref name = &quot;ystlxt&quot;&gt;Barrow, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the death of Edgar in 1107 he succeeded to the Scottish crown; but, in accordance with Edgar's instructions, their brother [[David I of Scotland|David]] was granted an [[appanage]] in southern Scotland. Edgar's will granted David the lands of the former [[kingdom of Strathclyde]] or Cumbria, and this was apparently agreed in advance by Edgar, Alexander, David and their brother-in-law [[Henry I of England]]. However, in 1113, perhaps at Henry's instigation, and with the support of his [[Anglo-Norman]], David demanded, and received, additional lands in [[Lothian]] along the Upper [[River Tweed|Tweed]] and [[River Teviot|Teviot]]. David did not receive the title of king, but of &quot;prince of the Cumbrians&quot;, and his lands remained under Alexander's final authority.&lt;ref&gt;Oram, pp. 60&amp;ndash;63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute over Upper Tweeddale and Teviotdale does not appear to have damaged relations between Alexander and David, although it was unpopular in some quarters. A [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] poem laments:&lt;blockquote&gt;It's bad what Malcolm's son has done,&lt;br&gt;dividing us from Alexander;&lt;br&gt;he causes, like each king's son before,&lt;br&gt;the plunder of stable Alba.&lt;ref&gt;Oram, p. 66 citing [[Thomas Owen Clancy|Clancy]], ''The Triumph Tree''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dispute over the eastern marches does not appear to have caused lasting trouble between Alexander and Henry of England. In 1114 he joined Henry on campaign in Wales against [[Gruffydd ap Cynan]] of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]].&lt;ref&gt;Oram, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's marriage with Henry's illegitimate daughter [[Sybilla de Normandy]] may have occurred as early as 1107, or as at late as 1114.&lt;ref&gt;Oram, p. 65; a date around 1114 would place the marriage at about the same time as that of David and [[Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon|Maud of Huntingdon]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William of Malmesbury]]'s account attacks Sybilla, but the evidence argues that Alexander and Sybilla were a devoted but childless couple and Sybilla was of noteworthy piety.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, p. 65; Oram, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Sybilla died in unrecorded circumstances at ''Eilean nam Ban'' ([[Kenmore, Perth and Kinross|Kenmore]] on [[Loch Tay]]) in July, 1122 and was buried at [[Dunfermline Abbey]]. Alexander did not remarry and [[Walter Bower]] wrote that he planned an [[Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at the ''Eilean nam Ban'' dedicated to Sybilla's memory, and he may have taken steps to have her [[Veneration|venerated]].&lt;ref&gt;Oram, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Alexander I (Alba) ii.JPG|thumb|250px|The reverse of the [[seal (device)|seal]] of Alexander I, enhanced as a 19th century steel engraving.]]
Alexander had at least one illegitimate child, [[Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair]], who was later to be involved in a revolt against [[David I of Scotland|David I]] in the 1130s. He was imprisoned at [[Roxburgh]] for many years afterwards, perhaps until his death some time after 1157.&lt;ref&gt;Oram, p. 77. The identity of this person may be still in question, see [[Meic Uilleim]] and [[MacHeths]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander was, like his brothers Edgar and David, a notably pious king. He was responsible for foundations at [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]] and [[Inchcolm]]. His mother's chaplain and [[hagiography|hagiographer]] [[Thurgot]] was named [[Bishop of Saint Andrews]] (or ''Cell Rígmonaid'') in 1107, presumably by Alexander's order.&lt;ref name = &quot;ystlxt&quot;/&gt; The case of Thurgot's would-be successor [[Eadmer]] shows that Alexander's wishes were not always accepted by the religious community, perhaps because Eadmer had the backing of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Ralph d'Escures]], rather than [[Thurstan]] of [[Archbishop of York|York]]. Alexander also patronised [[Saint Andrews]], granting lands intended for an Augustinian Priory, which may have been the same as that intended to honour his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

For all his religiosity, Alexander was not remembered as a man of peace. [[John of Fordun]] says of him:
{{quote|Now the king was a lettered and godly man; very humble and amiable towards the clerics and regulars, but terrible beyond measure to the rest of his subjects; a man of large heart, exerting himself in all things beyond his strength.&lt;ref&gt;Fordun, V, xxviii ([[William Forbes Skene|Skene's]] edition).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He manifested the terrible aspect of his character in his reprisals in the [[Mormaerdom of Moray]]. [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s ''Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland'' says that Alexander was holding court at [[Invergowrie]] when he was attacked by &quot;men of the Isles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wyntoun, cxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Bower says the attackers were from Moray and Mearns. Alexander pursued them north, to &quot;Stockford&quot; in [[Ross]] (near [[Beauly]]) where he defeated them. This, says Wyntoun, is why he was named the &quot;Fierce&quot;. The dating of this is uncertain, as are his enemies' identity. However, in 1116 the [[Annals of Ulster]] report: &quot;Ladhmann son of Domnall, grandson of the king of Scotland, was killed by the men of Moray.&quot; The king referred to is Alexander's father, Malcolm III, and Domnall was Alexander's half brother. The Mormaerdom or Kingdom of Moray was ruled by the family of [[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]] (Mac Bethad mac Findláich) and [[Lulach of Scotland|Lulach]] (Lulach mac Gille Coemgáin); not overmighty subjects, but a family who had ruled Alba within little more than a lifetime. Who the Mormaer or King was at this time is not known, it may have been [[Óengus of Moray]] or his father, whose name is not known. As for the Mearns, the only known [[Mormaer of Mearns]], [[Máel Petair of Mearns|Máel Petair]], had murdered Alexander's half-brother [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan II]] (Donnchad mac Maíl Coluim) in 1094.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, pp. 23&amp;ndash;24, deals with this affair.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander died in April 1124 at his court at Stirling; his brother David, probably the acknowledged heir since the death of Sybilla, succeeded him.&lt;ref&gt;Oram, pp.71&amp;ndash;72.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Fictional portrayals==

Alexander I has been depicted in a fantasy novel.   &lt;ref name=&quot;Saint Andrews&quot;&gt;Saint Andrews, Brodrick (2010), p. 99-104&lt;/ref&gt;:

* ''Pater Nostras Canis Dirus: The Garrison Effect'' (2010). Alexander is depicted troubled by his lack of direct heirs, having no child with his wife [[Sybilla of Normandy]]. He points that his father-in-law [[Henry I of England]] is asking them for a grandson. &lt;ref name=&quot;Saint Andrews&quot;&gt;Saint Andrews, Brodrick (2010), p. 99-104&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alexander II (Alba) ii.JPG|thumb|Alexander the warrior and knight: the reverse side of Alexander II's Great Seal, enhanced as a 19th century steel engraving.]]

'''Alexander II''' ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Mediaeval Gaelic]]: ''Alaxandair mac Uilliam''; Modern Gaelic: ''Alasdair mac Uilleim'') (24 August 1198 - 8 July 1249) was [[King of Scots]] from
1214 to his death.

==Early life==
He was born at [[Haddington, East Lothian]], the only son of the Scottish king [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]] and [[Ermengarde of Beaumont]]. He spent time in England ([[John of England]] knighted him at [[Clerkenwell Priory]] in 1213) before succeeding to the kingdom on the death of his father on 4 December 1214, being crowned at Scone on 6 December the same year.

==King of Scotland==

In 1215, the year after his accession, the clans [[Meic Uilleim]] and [[MacHeths]], inveterate enemies of the Scottish crown, broke into revolt; but loyalist forces speedily quelled the insurrection.

In the same year Alexander joined the English barons in their struggle against [[John of England]], and led an army into the [[Kingdom of England]] in support of their cause. This action led to the sacking of [[Berwick]] as John's forces ravaged the north.

The Scottish forces reached the south coast of England at the port of [[Dover]] where in September 1216, Alexander paid homage to the pretender [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis of France]] for his lands in England, chosen by the barons to replace King John. But [[John of England|John]] died and the Pope and the English aristocracy changed their allegiance to his nine-year-old son [[Henry III of England|Henry]], forcing the French and the Scottish armies to return home. shortly after taking London and the Scottish army returned to Scotland.

Peace between Henry III, the French prince and Alexander followed on 12 September 1217 with the treaty of Kingston. Diplomacy further strengthened the reconciliation by the marriage of Alexander to Henry's sister [[Joan of England, Queen consort of Scotland|Joan of England]] on 18 June or 25 June 1221.

The next year marked the subjection of the hitherto semi-independent district of [[Argyll]].  Royal forces crushed a revolt in [[Galloway]] in 1235 without difficulty; nor did an invasion attempted soon afterwards by its exiled leaders meet with success.  Soon afterwards a claim for homage from Henry of England drew forth from Alexander a counter-claim to the northern English counties.  The two kingdoms, however, settled this dispute by a compromise in 1237. This was the [[Treaty of York]] which defined the boundary between the two kingdoms as running between the Solway Firth (in the west) and the mouth of the River Tweed (in the east).

Joan died in March, 1238 in Essex, and in the following year, 1239, Alexander remarried. His second wife was [[Marie de Coucy]]. The marriage took place on 15 May 1239, and produced one son, the future [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], born in 1241.

A threat of invasion by Henry in 1243 for a time interrupted the friendly relations between the two countries; but the prompt action of Alexander in anticipating his attack, and the disinclination of the English barons for war, compelled him to make peace next year at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].  Alexander now turned his attention to securing the [[Western Isles]], which still owed a nominal allegiance to Norway. He successively attempted negotiations and purchase, but without success.

===Physical Appearance===

The English chronicler [[Matthew Paris]] in his [[Chronica Majora]] described Alexander as red-haired:

&quot;[King John] taunted King Alexander, and because he was red-headed, sent word to him,&lt;/br&gt; 
saying, 'so shall we hunt the red fox-cub from his lairs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Scottish annals from English chroniclers A.D.500 to 1286'', Alan Orr Anderson, Paul Watkins, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Alexander attempted to persuade [[Ewen MacDougall|Ewen]], the son of Duncan, Lord of [[Argyll]], to sever his allegiance to [[Haakon IV of Norway]].  When Ewen rejected these attempts, Alexander sailed forth to compel him but on the way he suffered a fever at the Isle of [[Kerrera]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]].

&amp;nbsp; ''Not to be confused with [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]].''

'''Alexander I''' or '''Aleksandar Obrenović''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: Александар Обреновић; August 14, 1876 – June 11, 1903) was king of [[Serbia]] from 1889 to 1903 when he and his wife, Queen Draga, were [[May Overthrow|assassinated]] by a group of Army officers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dorich |first=William |title=Kosovo |isbn=0317050745}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by Colonel [[Dragutin Dimitrijević]]

==Accession==
In 1889 Alexander's father, [[Milan I of Serbia|King Milan]], unexpectedly abdicated and withdrew to private life, proclaiming Alexander king of Serbia under a regency until he should attain his majority at eighteen years of age. His mother [[Natalija Obrenović]] became his regent.

In 1893, King Alexander, aged seventeen, in a first [[coup d'état]] proclaimed himself of full age, dismissed the [[regent]]s and their government, and took the royal authority into his own hands. His action won popular support, as did his appointment of a radical ministry.

In May 1894 King Alexander staged another coup: he abolished King Milan's liberal constitution of 1888 and restored the conservative one of 1869. His attitude during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)]] was one of strict [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].

In 1894 the young King brought his father, Milan, back to Serbia and, in 1898, appointed him commander-in-chief of the Serbian army. During that time, Milan was regarded{{By whom|date=March 2011}} as the ''de facto'' ruler of the country.

== Marriage ==

In the summer of 1900, King Alexander suddenly announced his engagement to the widowed Madame [[Draga Mašin]], formerly a lady-in-waiting to his mother. The projected union initially aroused great opposition: he did not consult with his father, who had been on vacation in [[Karlovy Vary]] and making arrangements to secure the hand of a [[Germany|German]] princess for his son, or his prime minister Dr. Vladan Đorđević, who was visiting the [[Paris]] [[World Exhibition|Universal Exhibition]] at the time of the announcement. Both immediately resigned from their respective offices and Alexander had difficulty in forming a new cabinet. Alexander's mother also opposed the marriage and was subsequently banished from the kingdom.

Opposition to the union seemed to subside somewhat for a time upon the publication of [[Tsar Nicholas II]]'s congratulations to the king on his engagement and of his acceptance to act as the principal witness at the wedding. The marriage was duly celebrated in August 1900. Even so, the unpopularity of the union weakened the King's position in the eyes of the army and the country at large.

== Political reconciliation ==
[[Image:Aleksandar Obrenovic.jpg|thumb|King Alexander and Queen Draga]]
King Alexander tried to reconcile political parties by unveiling a [[classical liberalism|liberal]] [[constitution]] of his own initiative, introducing for the first time in the constitutional history of Serbia the system of two chambers (''[[National Assembly of Serbia|skupština]]'' and ''[[senate]]'').  This reconciled the political parties but did not reconcile the army which, already dissatisfied with the king's marriage, became still more so at the rumors that one of the two unpopular brothers of [[Draga Mašin|Queen Draga]], Lieutenant Nikodije, was to be proclaimed heir-presumptive to the throne.

Meanwhile, the independence of the [[senate]] and of the council of state caused increasing irritation to King Alexander. In yet another ''[[coup d'état]]'', he suspended (March 1903) the [[constitution]] for half an hour, time enough to publish the decrees by which the old senators and councillors of state were dismissed and replaced by new ones. This arbitrary act naturally increased the dissatisfaction in the country.

== Assassination ==
{{main|May Overthrow}}
The general impression was that, as much as the [[senate]] was packed with men devoted to the royal couple and the government obtained a large majority at the general elections, King Alexander would not hesitate any longer to proclaim Queen Draga's brother as the [[heir]] to the throne. In spite of this, it had been agreed with the Serbian Government that [[Prince Mirko of Montenegro]], who was married to [[Natalija Konstantinovic]], the granddaughter of [[Princess Anka Obrenovic]], an aunt of King Milan, would be proclaimed Crown Prince of Serbia in the event that the marriage of King Alexander and Queen Draga was childless.&lt;ref name=&quot;njeg&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |last=Leroy |first=Pierre Olivier |url=http://www.njegoskij.org/menu_history/subArts_2006/subArtHI_05006.php#footnotes |title=Biography of Prince Mihajlo Petrovic Njegos |accessdate=September 28, 2007 |publisher=The Njegoskij Fund Public Project |year=2004}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently to prevent Queen Draga's brother being named heir, but in reality to replace Alexander Obrenović with [[Peter I of Serbia|Peter Karađorđević]], a conspiracy was organized by a group of Army officers headed by Captain [[Dragutin Dimitrijević]] also known as &quot;Apis&quot;, who was in the pay of the [[Russian Empire|Russians]],&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Sulzberger, ''The Fall of Eagles'', p.202, Crown Publishers, New York, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the leader of the [[Black Hand]] [[secret society]] which would assassinate [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in 1914. Several politicians were also part of the conspiracy, and allegedly included Prime Minister, [[Nikola Pašić]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sulzberger, p.202&quot;&gt;Sulzberger, p.202&lt;/ref&gt; The royal couple's [[The Old Palace|palace]] was invaded and they hid in a cupboard in the Queen's bedroom. There is another possibility, used in a Serbian history  TV series &quot;The End of the Obrenović Dynasty&quot;, in which the royal couple was hidden in a secret [[panic room]] hidden behind the mirror in a common bedroom. The room contained an entrance to a secret passage leading out of the palace, but the entrance was inaccessible due to the placement of the queen's wardrobe over it after the wedding.

The conspirators searched the palace and eventually discovered the royal couple and murdered them in the early morning of June 11, 1903. King Alexander and Queen Draga were shot and their bodies mutilated and disemboweled and, according to eyewitness accounts, thrown from a second floor window of the palace onto piles of garden manure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sulzberger, p.202&quot;/&gt; The King was only 26 years old at the time of his death. King Alexander and Queen Draga were buried in the crypt of [[St. Mark's Church, Belgrade]].

'''Alexander III'''  ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Medieval Gaelic]]: ''Alaxandair mac Alaxandair''; Modern Gaelic: ''Alasdair mac Alasdair'') ({{OldStyleDate|11 September|1241|4 September}} – {{OldStyleDate|26 March|1286|19 March}}) was [[King of Scots]] from 1249 to his death.

==Life==

Alexander was born at [[Roxburgh]], the only son of [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] by his second wife [[Marie de Coucy]]. Alexander's father died on 6 July 1249 and he became king at the age of eight, inaugurated at [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] on 13 July 1248.

The years of his minority featured an embittered struggle for the control of affairs between two rival parties, the one led by [[Walter Comyn]], [[Earl of Menteith]], the other by [[Alan Durward]], [[Justiciar of Scotia]].  The former dominated  the early years of Alexander's reign.  At the marriage of Alexander to [[Margaret of England]] in 1251, [[Henry III of England]] seized the opportunity to demand from his son-in-law homage for the Scottish kingdom, but Alexander did not comply.  In 1255 an interview between the English and Scottish kings at [[Kelso, Scottish Borders|Kelso]] led to Menteith and his party losing to Durward's party. But though disgraced, they still retained great influence, and two years later, seizing the person of the king, they compelled their rivals to consent to the erection of a regency representative of both parties.

On attaining his majority at the age of 21 in 1262, Alexander declared his intention of resuming the projects on the [[Western Isles]] which the death of his father thirteen years before had cut short. He laid a formal claim before the [[Norway|Norwegian]] king [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon]].  Haakon rejected the claim, and in the following year  responded with a formidable invasion.  Sailing around the west coast of Scotland he halted off the [[Isle of Arran]], and negotiations commenced. Alexander artfully prolonged the talks until the autumn storms should begin.  At length Haakon, weary of delay, attacked, only to encounter a terrific [[extreme weather|storm]] which greatly damaged his ships.  The [[Battle of Largs]] (October 1263) proved indecisive, but even so, Haakon's position was hopeless.  Baffled, he turned homewards, but died in Orkney on 15 December 1263. The Isles now lay at Alexander's feet, and in 1266 Haakon's successor concluded the [[Treaty of Perth]] by which he ceded the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Western Isles]] to Scotland in return for a monetary payment. Norway retained only [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] in the area. In 1284, Alexander invested the title of [[Lord of the Isles]] in the head of the Macdonald family, Angus Macdonald, and over the next two centuries the Macdonald lords operated as if they were kings in their own right, frequently opposing the [[Scottish People|Scottish]] [[monarch]].

==Succession==

Alexander had married Princess [[Margaret of England]], a daughter of King [[Henry III of England]] and [[Eleanor of Provence]], on 26 December 1251. She died in 1274, after they had three children:
# [[Margaret of Scotland (Queen of Norway)|Margaret]] (28 February 1260 – 9 April 1283), who married King [[Eirik II of Norway]]
# [[Alexander, Prince of Scotland]] (21 January 1264 [[Jedburgh]] – 28 January 1284 [[Lindores Abbey]]); buried in [[Dunfermline Abbey]]
# David (20 March 1272 – June 1281 [[Stirling Castle]]); buried in [[Dunfermline Abbey]]

According to the [[Lanercost Chronicle]], Alexander did not spend his decade as a widower alone: &quot;''he used never to forbear on account of season nor storm, nor for perils of flood or rocky cliffs, but would visit none too creditably nuns or matrons, virgins or widows as the fancy seized him, sometimes in disguise''.&quot;

Towards the end of Alexander's reign, the death of all three of his children within a few years made the question of the succession one of pressing importance. In 1284 he induced the [[Parliament of Scotland|Estates]] to recognize as his heir-presumptive his granddaughter [[Margaret of Scotland (Maid of Norway)|Margaret, the &quot;Maid of Norway&quot;]]. The need for a male heir led him to contract a second marriage to [[Yolande de Dreux (Scotland)|Yolande de Dreux]] on 1 November 1285.

But the sudden death of the king dashed all such hopes. Alexander died in a fall from his horse in the dark while riding to visit the queen at [[Kinghorn]] in [[Fife]] on 19 March 1286 because it was her birthday the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Scottish Queens, 1034-1714 | last=Marshall | first=Rosalind K. | page=27 | year=2003 | publisher=Tuckwell Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had spent the evening at Edinburgh Castle celebrating his second marriage and overseeing a meeting with royal advisors. He was advised by them not to make the journey over to Fife because of weather conditions, but travelled anyway. Alexander became separated from his guides and it is assumed that in the dark his horse lost its footing. The amount of alcohol he had would't have helped. The 44-year old king was found dead on the shore the following morning with a broken neck. Some texts have said that he fell off a cliff. Although there is no cliff at the site where his body was found there is a very steep rocky embankment - which would have been fatal in the dark. After Alexander's death, his strong realm was plunged into a period of darkness that would eventually lead to war with England. Had Alexander, who was a strong monarch, lived, things might have worked out differently {{Harv|Ashley|2002|p=156}}. He was buried in [[Dunfermline Abbey]].

As Alexander left no surviving children the heir to the throne was his unborn child by Queen Yolande. When Yolande's pregnancy ended, probabably with a miscarriage, Alexander's granddaughter Margaret became the heir. Margaret died, still uncrowned, on her way to Scotland in 1290. The inauguration of [[John Balliol]] as king on 30 November 1292 ended the six years of [[interregnum]] when the [[Guardians of Scotland]] governed the land.

==Fictional portrayals==

Alexander III has been depicted in historical novels. They include:&lt;ref name=&quot;Nield&quot;&gt;Nield (1968), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''The Thirsty Sword'' (1892) by Robert Leighton. The novel depicts the &quot;Norse invasion of Scotland&quot;  (1262–1263, part of the [[Scottish–Norwegian War]]) and the [[Battle of Largs]].  It includes depictions of Alexander III and his opponent [[Haakon IV of Norway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nield&quot;&gt;Nield (1968), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel concludes that Alexander was indeed murdered &quot;by a fanatical servant&quot; of [[Edward I of England]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Alexander of Aphrodisias de Fato 1658 page 7.jpg|right|thumb|Opening paragraph of the treatise ''On Fate'' (''Pros tous Autokratoras'') by Alexander of Aphrodisias. From an anonymous edition published in 1658.]]
'''Alexander of Aphrodisias''' ({{lang-el|Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Ἀφροδισιεύς}}; fl. 200 AD) was a [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosopher and the most celebrated of the [[Ancient Greek]] [[Commentaries on Aristotle|commentators]] on the writings of [[Aristotle]]. He was a native of [[Aphrodisias]] in [[Caria]], and lived and taught in [[Athens]] at the beginning of the 3rd century, where he held a position as head of the [[Peripatetic school]]. He wrote many commentaries on the works of [[Aristotle]], and still extant are those on the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'', ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'', ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Aristotle)|Sense and Sensibilia]]'', and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''. Several original treatises also survive, and include a work ''On Fate'', in which he argues against the [[Stoic]] doctrine of necessity; and one ''On the Soul''. His commentaries on Aristotle were considered so useful that he was styled, by way of pre-eminence, &quot;the commentator&quot; (ὁ ἐξηγητής).

==Life and career==
Alexander was a native of [[Aphrodisias]] in [[Caria]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;We cannot be certain that his Aphrodisias is the major Carian city which has been extensively excavated in recent years, though in view of its well-developed cultural life it probably was.&quot; Robert B. Todd, (1976), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias on Stoic physics: a study of the De Mixtione with Preliminary Essays, Text, Translation and Commentary'', page 1. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; and came to [[Athens]] towards the end of the 2nd century.  He was a student of the two [[Stoic]],&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Lynch, ''Aristotle's School'', Berkeley, 1972, p. 215.  See [[Sosigenes the Peripatetic]].&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]], philosophers [[Sosigenes the Peripatetic|Sosigenes]]&lt;ref&gt;See Alexander's Comm. in Arist. ''Meteor.'', p. 143.13 Hayduck ({{polytonic|ὁ διδάσκαλος ἡμῶν Σωσιγένης}}), [[Themistius]], Paraphr. in Arist. ''de Anima'', p. 61.23 Heinze, Ps.-Ammonius, Comm. in Arist. ''Anal. Pr.'' p. 39.24 Wallies, and [[Philoponus]], Comm. in Arist. ''Anal. Pr.'', p. 126.20-23 Wallies.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herminus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], Comm. in Arist. ''de Caelo'', p. 430.32 Heiberg, quoting Alexander: {{polytonic|Ἑρμίνου δέ...ἤκουσα, καθὰ ἦν καὶ ἐν τοῖς Ἀσπασίου φερόμενον}}, &quot;I heard from Herminus, as was said among Aspasius' students...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps of [[Aristotle of Mytilene]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Thillet, in his 1984 [[Collection Budé|Budé]] edition of ''On Fate'', has argued against Moraux's identification (''Der Aristotelismus im I. und II. Jahrhundert n. Chr.'', vol. 2, 1984) of Aristotle of Mytilene as Alexander's teacher, pointing out that the text that has been taken to mean this (''On Fate'', ''mantissa'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=bKYNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA110 p. 110.4 Bruns], {{polytonic|Ἤκουσα...παρὰ Ἀριστοτέλους}}) could refer instead to Alexander's learning from the texts of Aristotle the Stagirite.  See R.W. Sharples, ''Classical Review'', n.s., 36 (1986), [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0009-840X%281986%292%3A36%3A1%3C33%3AAOAOF%3E2.0.CO%3B2-W p. 33].  [[Cyril of Alexandria]], ''Against Julian'' 2.38, may name [[Aristocles of Messene]], but the text edited by Burguière and Évieux (''[[Sources Chrétiennes]]'' 322, 1985) reads {{polytonic|Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Ἀριστοτέλους μαθητὴς}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At Athens he became head of the [[Peripatetic school]] and lectured on Peripatetic philosophy.  Alexander's dedication of ''On Fate'' to [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Caracalla]], in gratitude for his position at Athens, indicates a date between 198 and 209.  A recently published inscription from Aphrodisias confirms that he was head of one of the Schools at Athens and gives his full name as Titus Aurelius Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;A. Chaniotis, 'Epigraphic evidence for the philosopher Alexander of Aphrodisias', in ''Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies'', ISSN 0076-0730, v.47 (2004) pp. 79-81&lt;/ref&gt;  His full nomenclature shows that his grandfather or other ancestor was probably given Roman citizenship by the emperor [[Antoninus Pius]], while proconsul of Asia.  The inscription honours his father, also called Alexander and also a philosopher.  This fact makes it plausible that some of the suspect works that form part of Alexander's corpus should be ascribed to his father.&lt;ref&gt;R. Sharples, 'Implications of the new Alexander of Aphrodisias inscription', in ''Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies '' 48 (2005) pp. 47-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentaries===
Alexander composed several [[Commentaries on Aristotle|commentaries on the works of Aristotle]], in which he sought to escape a [[Syncretism|syncretistic]] tendency and to recover the pure doctrines of Aristotle.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;&gt;{{1911|article=Alexander of Aphrodisias|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Alexander_of_Aphrodisias}}&lt;/ref&gt; His commentaries are still extant on ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' (Book 1), ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'', ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'', ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Aristotle)|Sense and Sensibilia]]'', and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' (Books 1-5).&lt;ref name=&quot;zeyl&quot;&gt;Donald J. Zeyl, Daniel Devereux, Phillip Mitsis, (1997), ''Encyclopedia of Classical Philosophy'', page 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The commentary on the ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'' is deemed spurious, as is the commentary on the final nine books of the ''Metaphysics''.&lt;ref name=&quot;fortenbaugh22&quot;&gt;William W. Fortenbaugh, R. W. Sharples, (2005), ''Theophrastus of Eresus, sources for his life, writings, thought and Influence'', page 22. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; The lost commentaries include works on the ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[On the Heavens]]'', ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'', ''[[On the Soul]]'', and ''[[On Memory]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;fortenbaugh22&quot;/&gt; [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] mentions that Alexander provided commentary on the [[quadrature of the lune]]s, and the corresponding problem of [[squaring the circle]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunham, William. ''Journey through Genius'', Penguin, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, it was reported that imaging analysis had discovered an early commentary on Aristotle's ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'' in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]], and [[Robert Sharples (classicist)|Robert Sharples]] suggested Alexander as the most likely author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6591221.stm | work=BBC News | title=Text reveals more ancient secrets | date=2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original treatises===
There are also several original writings by Alexander still extant. These include: ''On the Soul'', ''Problems and Solutions'', ''Ethical Problems'', ''On Fate'', and ''On Mixture and Growth''.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeyl&quot;/&gt; Three works attributed to him are considered spurious: ''Medical Questions'', ''Physical Problems'', and ''On Fevers''.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeyl&quot;/&gt; Additional works by Alexander are preserved in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation, these include: ''On the Principles of the Universe'',&lt;ref&gt;Charles Genequand, (2001), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias: On the Cosmos''. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; ''On Providence'', and ''Against [[Galen]] on Motion''.&lt;ref&gt;N. Rescher, M. E. Marmura, (1965), ''The Refutation by Alexander of Aphrodisias of Galen's Treatise on the Theory of Motion''. Islamic Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

''On the Soul'' (''De anima'') is a treatise on the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] written along the lines suggested by Aristotle in his own ''[[On the Soul|De anima]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Van Riel, 2010, ''Ancient Perspectives on Aristotle's de Anima'', page 174. Leuven University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander contends that the undeveloped reason in man is material (''nous hulikos'') and inseparable from the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt; He argued strongly against the doctrine of the soul's immortality.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt; He identified the active intellect (''nous poietikos''), through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual, with [[God]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt; A second book is known as the ''Supplement to On the Soul'' (''Mantissa''). The ''Mantissa'' is a series of twenty-five separate pieces of which the opening five deal directly with [[psychology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;todd18&quot;&gt;Robert B. Todd, (1976), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias on Stoic physics: a study of the De Mixtione with Preliminary Essays, Text, Translation and Commentary'', page 18. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining twenty pieces cover problems in [[physics]] and [[ethics]], of which the largest group deals with questions of [[visual perception|vision]] and [[light]], and the final four with [[destiny|fate]] and [[Divine Providence|providence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;todd18&quot;/&gt; The ''Mantissa'' was probably not written by Alexander in its current form, but much of the actual material may be his.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The two books of the ''De Anima'' differ markedly in form and content, and they were not originally a single work. Book I is generally recognized as authentic. Book II is almost certainly not by Alexander of Aphrodisias in its present form, though much of the material may be his or from his school.&quot; F. Edward Cranz, (1960), &quot;Alexander Aphrodisiensis&quot;, in: ''Catalogus Translationum et Commentariorum: Medieval and Renaissance Latin Translations and Commentaries'', page 84. Vol. 1. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Problems and Solutions'' (''Quaestiones'') consists of three books which, although termed &quot;problems and solutions of physical questions,&quot; treat of subjects which are not all physical, and are not all problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;todd19&quot;&gt;Robert B. Todd, (1976), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias on Stoic physics: a study of the De Mixtione with Preliminary Essays, Text, Translation and Commentary'', page 19. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; Among the sixty-nine items in these three books, twenty-four deal with physics, seventeen with psychology, eleven with [[logic]] and [[metaphysics]], and six with questions of fate and providence.&lt;ref name=&quot;todd19&quot;/&gt; It is unlikely that Alexander wrote all of the ''Quaestiones'', some may be Alexander's own explanations, while others may be exercises by his students.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Sharples, 1992, ''Alexander of Aphrodisias: Quaestiones 1.1-2.15'', pages 3-4. Duckworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ethical Problems'' was traditionally counted as the fourth book of the ''Quaestiones''.&lt;ref name=&quot;todd19&quot;/&gt; The work is a discussion of ethical issues based on Aristotle, and contains responses to questions and problems deriving from Alexander's school.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuominen&quot;&gt;Miira Tuominen, (2009), ''The ancient commentators on Plato and Aristotle'', page 237. University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that the work was not written by Alexander himself, but rather by his pupils on the basis of debates involving Alexander.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuominen&quot;/&gt;

''On Fate'' is a treatise in which Alexander argues against the [[Stoic]] doctrine of necessity.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt; In ''On Fate'' Alexander denied three things - necessity ({{lang-el|ἀνάγκη}}), the foreknowledge of fated events that was part of the Stoic identification of God and Nature, and [[determinism]] in the sense of a sequence of causes that was laid down beforehand ({{lang-el|προκαταβεβλημένος}}) or predetermined by antecedents ({{lang-el|προηγουμένος}}). He defended a view of moral responsibility we would call [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]] today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/alexander/ Alexander of Aphrodisias]&lt;/ref&gt;

''On Mixture and Growth'' discusses the topic of [[mixture]] of physical bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;toddix&quot;&gt;Robert B. Todd, (1976), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias on Stoic physics: a study of the De Mixtione with Preliminary Essays, Text, Translation and Commentary'', page ix. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; It is both an extended discussion (and polemic) on [[Stoic physics]], and an exposition of Aristotelian thought on this theme.&lt;ref name=&quot;toddix&quot;/&gt;

''On the Principles of the Universe'' is preserved in Arabic translation. This treatise is not mentioned in surviving Greek sources, but it enjoyed great popularity in the Muslim world, and a large number of copies have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Genequand, (2001), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias: On the Cosmos'', page 1. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose of this work is to give a general account of Aristotelian cosmology and metaphysics, but it also has a polemical tone, and it may be directed at rival views within the Peripatetic school.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Genequand, (2001), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias: On the Cosmos'', page 4. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander was concerned with filling the gaps of the Aristotelian system and smoothing out its inconsistencies, while also presenting a unified picture of the world, both physical and ethical.&lt;ref name=&quot;genequand6&quot;&gt;Charles Genequand, (2001), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias: On the Cosmos'', page 6. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; The topics dealt with are the nature of the heavenly motions and the relationship between the unchangeable celestial realm and the [[Sublunary sphere|sublunar world]] of generation and decay.&lt;ref name=&quot;genequand6&quot;/&gt; His principal sources are the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' (book 7), ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' (book 12), and the [[Pseudo-Aristotle|Pseudo-Aristotelian]] ''[[On the Universe]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;genequand6&quot;/&gt;

''On Providence'' survives in two Arabic versions.&lt;ref name=&quot;sharples&quot;&gt;Robert W. Sharples, &quot;The Peripatetic school&quot;, in David Furley (editor), (2003), ''From Aristotle to Augustine'', pages 159-160. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; In this treatise, Alexander opposes the Stoic view that divine [[Divine Providence|providence]] extends to all aspects of the world; he regards this idea as unworthy of the gods.&lt;ref name=&quot;sharples&quot;/&gt; Instead, providence is a power that emanates from the heavens to the sublunar region, and is responsible for the generation and destruction of earthly things, without any direct involvement in the lives of individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;sharples&quot;/&gt;

==Influence==
By the 6th century Alexander's commentaries on Aristotle were considered so useful that he was referred to as &quot;the commentator&quot; ({{lang-el|ὁ ἐξηγητής}}).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], ''in Phys.'' 707, 33; 1170, 13; 1176, 32; [[John Philoponus|Philoponus]], ''in An. Pr.'' 126, 21; [[Olympiodorus the Younger|Olympiodorus]], ''in Meteor.'' 263, 21. But see [[Jonathan Barnes]] et al., (1991), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias, On Aristotle Prior Analytics 1.1-7'', page 4, who argue: &quot;In all these texts Alexander is indeed referred to by phrases such as 'the commentator' or 'Aristotle's commentator'; but these phrases are not honorific titles - they are ordinary referring expressions. If, at the end of a book review, you read 'The author deserves our thanks', you will rightly take this for praise - but you will not think that the author has been honoured as The Author par excellence.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; His commentaries were greatly esteemed among the [[Arab]]s, who translated many of them,&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt; and he is heavily quoted by [[Maimonides]].

In 1210, the Church Council of Paris issued [[Condemnations (University of Paris)#Condemnation_of_1210|a condemnation]], which probably targeted the writings of Alexander among others.&lt;ref&gt;G. Théry, ''Autour du décret de 1210: II, Alexandre d'Aphrodise. Aperçu sur l'influence de sa noétique'', Kain, Belgium, 1926, pp. 7 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early [[Renaissance]] his doctrine of the soul's mortality was adopted by [[Pietro Pomponazzi]] (against the [[Thomists]] and the [[Averroists]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt; and by his successor [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]].  This school is known as [[Alexandrists]].

[[Alexander's band]], an [[optical phenomenon]], is named after him.

==Modern editions==
Several of Alexander's works were published in the [[Aldine Press|Aldine]] edition of Aristotle, Venice, 1495–1498; his ''De Fato'' and ''De Anima'' were printed along with the works of [[Themistius]] at Venice (1534); the former work, which has been translated into [[Latin]] by [[Grotius]] and also by [[Schulthess]], was edited by [[Johann Caspar von Orelli|J. C. Orelli]], [[Zürich]], 1824; and his commentaries on the Metaphysica by [[H. Bonitz]], [[Berlin]], 1847.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt; In 1989 the first part of his ''On Aristotle Metaphysics'' was published as part of the [[Ancient commentators project]]. Since then, other works of his have been translated into English.

'''Alexander Severus''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Aurelius Severus Alexander Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Alexander's name would be inscribed as &lt;small&gt;MARCVS AVRELIVS SEVERVS ALEXANDER AVGVSTVS&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  1 October 208 – 18 March 235), also known as '''Severus Alexander''', was [[Roman Emperor]] from 222 to 235. Alexander was the last emperor of the [[Severan dynasty]]. He succeeded his cousin [[Elagabalus]] upon the latter's assassination in 222, and was ultimately assassinated himself, marking the [[epoch event]] for the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] — nearly fifty years of civil wars, foreign invasion, and collapse of the monetary economy. 

Alexander was the [[heir apparent]] to his cousin, the eighteen-year-old Emperor who had been murdered along with his mother by his own guards—and as a mark of contempt, had their remains cast into the [[Tiber river]].&lt;ref&gt;Dio, 60:20:2&lt;/ref&gt;  He and his cousin were both grandsons of the influential and powerful [[Julia Maesa]], who had arranged for Elagabalus' acclamation as emperor by the famed [[Legio III Gallica|Third Gallic Legion]]. It was the rumor of Alexander's death that triggered the assassination of Elagabalus.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 5:8:5&lt;/ref&gt;

As emperor, Alexander's peace time reign was prosperous. In military conflict against the rising [[Sassanid Empire]], there are mixed accounts, though the Sassanid threat was checked. However, when campaigning against [[Germanic tribes]] of [[Germania]], Alexander apparently alienated his legions by engaging in diplomacy and bribery, and they assassinated him.

==Early Reign==
Alexander was born at [[Arqa|Arca Caesarea]]&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 1:2&lt;/ref&gt; on 1 October, 208, with the name '''Marcus Julius Gessius Bassianus Alexianus'''.&lt;ref&gt;Canduci, pg. 60&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander's father, [[Marcus Julius Gessius Marcianus]] was a Syrian [[Promagistrate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Benario, Severus Alexander&quot;&gt;Benario, ''Severus Alexander''&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother [[Julia Avita Mamaea]] was the second daughter of [[Julia Maesa]] and Syrian noble [[Julius Avitus]] and maternal aunt of Emperor [[Elagabalus]].&lt;ref&gt;Dio, 79:30:3&lt;/ref&gt;  He had an elder sister called Theoclia and little is known about her. Alexander's maternal great-aunt was empress [[Julia Domna]] (also Maesa's younger sister) and his great-uncle in marriage was emperor Lucius [[Septimius Severus]]. Emperors [[Caracalla]] and [[Publius Septimius Geta]], were his mother's maternal cousins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benario, Alexander Severus&quot;&gt;Benario, ''Alexander Severus''&lt;/ref&gt;  In 221, Alexander's grandmother, Maesa, persuaded the emperor to adopt his cousin as successor and make him [[Caesar (title)|''Caesar'']] and Bassianus changed his name to Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 5:7:4&lt;/ref&gt;  In the following year, on March 11, Elagabalus was murdered, and Alexander was proclaimed emperor by the [[Praetorian Guard|Praetorians]] and accepted by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

When Alexander became emperor, he was young, amiable, well-meaning, and entirely under the dominion of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Zonaras, 12:15:1&lt;/ref&gt;  Julia Mamaea was a woman of many virtues, and she surrounded the young emperor with wise counsellors,&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 61&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt; under the administration of the jurist and praetorian praefect [[Ulpian]].&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 1:10&lt;/ref&gt;  She watched over the development of her son's character and improved the tone of the administration.&lt;ref&gt;Dio, Book 80&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, she was inordinately jealous.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 6:1:9&lt;/ref&gt;  She arranged for Alexander to marry [[Sallustia Orbiana]], the daughter of a noble [[Patrician]] family, but grew so jealous of Sallustia’s influence over her son that she had her banished from court.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 6&quot;&gt;Gibbon, Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  She also alienated the army by extreme parsimony,&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 61&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt; and neither she nor her son were strong enough to impose military discipline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benario, Alexander Severus&quot;/&gt;  

Mutinies became frequent in all parts of the empire; in Rome, the [[Praetorian Guard]] became infuriated by the actions of the praetorian praefect [[Ulpian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 60&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 60&lt;/ref&gt;  A three day riot broke out in Rome between the people and the Praetorians, and it only ended with the death of Ulpian, who was hunted down and killed at the feet of the emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 6&quot;&gt;Gibbon, Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Another mutiny forced the retirement of [[Cassius Dio]] from his command.&lt;ref&gt;Dio, 80:26:2&lt;/ref&gt;  In the provinces of the empire, in [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], in [[Mauritania]], in [[Roman Armenia|Armenia]], in [[Roman Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] and in [[Germania]], fresh mutinies perpetually broke out, as his officers were murdered and his authority was disregarded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 6&quot;&gt;Gibbon, Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander’s reign contained some of the last major building works constructed in [[Rome]] before the reign of Diocletian. The last of the eleven great aqueducts, the ''[[aqua Alexandrina]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 25:4&lt;/ref&gt; was put into service in 226;&lt;ref name=&quot;Benario, Alexander Severus&quot;/&gt; he also rebuilt the [[thermae Neronianae]] along side the Basilica Alexandrina in the [[Campus Martius]] in the following year and gave them his own name.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 25:3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persian and German wars==
On the whole, however, the reign of Alexander was prosperous until the rise, in the east, of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 61&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the war that followed there are various accounts. According to Herodian, the Roman armies suffered a number of humiliating setbacks and defeats,&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 6:5-6:6&lt;/ref&gt; while according to the [[Historia Augusta]]&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 55:1-3&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Alexander's own dispatch to the [[Roman Senate]], he gained great victories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 62&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt;  Making [[Antioch]] his base, he marched at the head of his troops towards [[Ctesiphon]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 61&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt; but a second army was destroyed by the Persians,&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 6:5:10&lt;/ref&gt; and further losses were incurred by the retreating Romans in [[Roman Armenia|Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 6:6:3&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, although the Sassanids were checked for the time,&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 62&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt; the conduct of the Roman army showed an extraordinary lack of discipline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 61&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  In 232 there was a mutiny in the Syrian legion, who proclaimed [[Taurinus]] emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Victor, 24:2&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander managed to suppress the uprising, and Taurinus drowned while attempting to flee across the [[Euphrates]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 59&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  The emperor returned to [[Rome]] and celebrated a triumph in 233.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 62&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year he was called to face German invaders in [[Gaul]], who had breached the Rhine frontier in several places, destroying forts and over-running the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 6:7:2&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander mustered his forces, bringing legions from the eastern provinces, and crossed the Rhine into Germany on a pontoon bridge.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 6:7:6&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially on the advice of his mother, he attempted to buy the German tribes off, so as to gain time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 61&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this was a wise policy or not, it caused the Roman legionaries to look down on their emperor as one who was prepared to commit unsoldierly conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Zonaras, 12:15&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Herodian]] says &quot;in their opinion Alexander showed no honourable intention to pursue the war and preferred a life of ease, when he should have marched out to punish the Germans for their previous insolence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian, 6:7:10&lt;/ref&gt;  These circumstances drove the army to look for a new leader. They chose [[Maximinus Thrax|Gaius Iulius Verus Maximinus]], a Thracian soldier who had worked his way up through the ranks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 63&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the nomination of Maximinus as emperor, Alexander was assassinated (on either March 18 or March 19, 235), together with his mother, in a mutiny of the [[Legio XXII Primigenia|Legio XXII ''Primigenia'']] at [[Mainz|Moguntiacum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 63&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt;  These assassinations secured the throne for [[Maximinus Thrax|Maximinus]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Benario, Alexander Severus&quot;/&gt;

The death of Alexander is considered as the end of the ''Principate'' system established by [[Augustus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 61&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the ''Principate'' continued in theory until the reign of [[Diocletian]], Severus Alexander's death signalled the beginning of the chaotic period known as the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] which brought the empire to near collapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 61&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Image:Severus alexander.jpg|left|thumb|220px|''[[Denarius]]'' of Severus Alexander]]
Alexander was the last of the Syrian emperors. Under the influence of his mother, he did much to improve the morals and condition of the people, and to enhance the dignity of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benario, Alexander Severus&quot;/&gt;  His advisers were men like the famous jurist Ulpian, the historian Cassius Dio and a select board of sixteen senators;&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern, pg. 60&quot;&gt;Southern, pg. 60&lt;/ref&gt; a municipal council of fourteen assisted the [[urban prefect]] in administering the affairs of the fourteen districts of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 33:1&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive luxury and extravagance at the imperial court were diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 15:1&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his accession he reduced the silver purity of the denarius from 46.5% to 43% — the actual silver weight dropping from 1.41&amp;nbsp;grams to 1.30&amp;nbsp;grams. However, in 229 he revalued the denarius, increasing the silver purity and weight to 45% and 1.46&amp;nbsp;grams respectively. The following year he decreased the amount of base metal in the denarius while adding more silver - raising the silver purity and weight again to 50.5% and 1.50&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm Tulane University &quot;Roman Currency of the Principate&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Also during his reign taxes were lightened; literature, art and science were encouraged; the lot of the soldiers was improved;&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 21:6&lt;/ref&gt; and, for the convenience of the people, loan offices were instituted for lending money at a moderate rate of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 21:2&lt;/ref&gt;

In religious matters Alexander preserved an open mind. It is said that he was desirous of erecting a temple to the [[Jesus|founder of Christianity]], but was dissuaded by the pagan priests.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 43:6-7&lt;/ref&gt;  He allowed a [[synagogue]] to be built in Rome, and he gave as a gift to this synagogue a scroll of the [[Torah]] known as the [[Severus Scroll]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=A&amp;artid=1153 1901–1906 Jewish Encyclopedia article &quot;Alexander Severus&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
Alexander was married three times. His most famous wife was [[Sallustia Orbiana]], ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]],'' whom he married in 225.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benario, Alexander Severus&quot;/&gt;  He divorced and exiled her in 227, after her father, [[Seius Sallustius]], was executed after being accused of attempting to assassinate the emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 59&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  Another wife was Sulpicia Memmia. Her father was a man of consular rank; her grandfather's name was ''Catulus''.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 20:3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander''' is a common male first name, and less common [[Alexander (surname)|surname]]. The most famous is [[Alexander the Great]], the King of [[Macedon]] who created one of the largest empires in ancient history.

== Origin ==
[[Etymology|Etymologically]], the name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;Αλέξανδρος&quot; (Aléxandros), meaning &quot;defending men&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29le%2Fcandros ἀλέξανδρος], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;protector of men&quot;, a compound of the verb &quot;ἀλέξω&quot; (alexō), &quot;to ward off, to avert, to defend&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29le%2Fcw ἀλέξω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and the noun &quot;ἀνδρός&quot; (andros), genitive of &quot;ἀνήρ&quot; (anēr), &quot;man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29nh%2Fr ἀνήρ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; It is an example of the widespread motif of Greek (or Indo-European more generally) names expressing &quot;battle-prowess&quot;, in this case the ability to withstand or push back an enemy [[shield wall|battle line]].

The earliest attested form of the name is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] feminine noun ''a-re-ka-sa-da-ra'', (transliterated as ''[[Alexandra]]''), written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=217 a-re-ka-sa-da-ra (Alexandra)] Palaeolexicon,
Word study tool of ancient languages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080627021042/http://www.geocities.com/kurogr/linearb.pdf Mycenaean (Linear B)&amp;nbsp;– English Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Mycenaean World'', [[John Chadwick]], New York: Cambridge University Press, 1976, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; 

The name was one of the titles (&quot;epithets&quot;) given to the Greek goddess [[Hera]] and as such is usually taken to mean &quot;one who comes to save warriors&quot;. In the [[Iliad]], the character [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] is known also as Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3D*%29ale%2Fcandros Ἀλέξανδρος], 
Georg Autenrieth, ''A Homeric Dictionary'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; The name's popularity was spread throughout the Greek world by the military conquests of [[Alexander the Great|King Alexander III, commonly known as &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;]]. Most later Alexanders in various countries were directly or indirectly named for him.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}

'''Alexander Aetolus''' ([[ancient Greek|Gr.]] '''{{polytonic|Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Αἰτωλός}}''') was a [[Greeks|Greek]] poet and grammarian, the only known representative of Aetolian poetry.&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard | authorlink =  | title = Alexander | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]]  | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 111  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | location = Boston  | year = 1867  | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0120.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the son of Satyrus and Stratocleia, and was a native of [[Pleuron, Aetolia|Pleuron]] in [[Aetolia]], although he spent the greater part of his life at [[Alexandria]], where he was reckoned one of the seven tragic poets who constituted the [[Tragic Pleiad]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suda]], ''s. v.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eudoc. p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' ii. 22. § 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]], ''ad [[Homer|Hom]] ''[[Iliad|Il.]] xvi. 233&lt;/ref&gt;  He flourished about 280 BC, in the reign of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]].

He had an office in the [[Library of Alexandria]], and was commissioned by Ptolemy to make a collection of all the tragedies and satyric dramas that were extant.  He spent some time, together with [[Antagoras]] and [[Aratus]], at the court of [[Antigonus II Gonatas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aratus]], ''Phaenomena et Diosem.'' ii. pp. 431, 443, &amp;c. 446, ed. Buhle&lt;/ref&gt;  Notwithstanding the distinction he enjoyed as a tragic poet, he appears to have had greater merit as a writer of epic poems, [[elegy|elegies]], [[epigram]]s, and cynaedi.  Among his [[epic poem]]s, we possess the titles and some fragments of three pieces: the ''Fisherman'',&lt;ref&gt;{{polytonic|ἁλιεὺς}}, [[Athenaeus]], vii. p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kirka'' or ''Krika'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]], vii. p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; which, however, is designated by [[Athenaeus]] as doubtful, and ''Helena'',&lt;ref&gt;[[August Immanuel Bekker]], ''Anecdota Graeca'' p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;  Of his elegies, some beautiful fragments are still extant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]], iv. p. 170, xi. p. 496, xv. p. 899&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], xii. p. 556, xiv. p. 681&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parthen.

[[Image:Judea Alexander Janneüs.PNG|right|thumb|Hasmonean Kingdom under Alexander Jannaeus&lt;br&gt;{{legend|lime|situation in 103 BC}}{{legend|fuchsia|area conquered}}]]
'''Alexander Jannaeus''' (also known as '''Alexander Jannai/Yannai'''; [[Hebrew]]: '''אלכסנדר ינאי''') was king of [[Judea]] from 103&amp;nbsp;BC to 76&amp;nbsp;BC. The son of [[John Hyrcanus]], he inherited the throne from his brother [[Aristobulus I]], and appears to have married his brother's widow, ''Shlomtzion'' or &quot;Shelomit&quot;, also known as [[Salome Alexandra]], according to the Biblical law of [[Yibbum]] (&quot;levirate marriage&quot;), although [[Josephus]] is inexplicit on that point.

His likely full Hebrew name was &quot;Jonathan&quot;; he may have been the High Priest Jonathan, rather than his great-uncle of the same name, who established the [[Masada]] fortress.  Under the name &quot;King Yannai&quot; he appears as a wicked tyrant in the [[Talmud]], reflecting his conflict with the [[Pharisee]] party. He is among the more colorful historical figures, despite being little known outside specialized history. He and his widow (who became [[queen regnant]] after his death) had a substantial impact on the subsequent development of Judaism.&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Mason | first = Charles Peter | authorlink = | title = Alexander, Jannaeus | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 117 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=acl3129.0001.001;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jannaeus expanded the Hasmonean Kingdom and established the city of [[Gamla]] in 81&amp;nbsp;BC, as the capital for what is now the [[Golan Heights]].

==Family==
Alexander Jannaeus married the wife of his brother, [[Aristobulus I]] ([[Salome Alexandra]]). By her, he had two sons, the eldest, [[Hyrcanus II]] became high-priest in 62&amp;nbsp;BC and [[Aristobulus II]] who was high-priest from 66 - 62&amp;nbsp;BC and started a bloody civil war with his brother, ending in his capture by [[Pompey the Great]].&lt;ref&gt; Josephus, Jewish War (1.107-155) &lt;/ref&gt;

==Conquests of Alexander Jannaeus== 
	
During the twenty-seven year reign of Alexander Jannaeus, he was almost constantly involved in military conflict.  Primarily, international factors at the time created an environment suitable for Jannaeus' conquests. First of all, Jannaeus received support from [[Cleopatra III of Egypt]]. She was probably swayed to support Jannaeus through two Jewish commanders in her military.  This support was particularly crucial during the war with Ptolemy Lathyrus (discussed later). Ultimately, conflict in the Roman Empire was the greatest outside influence on Judean military campaigns. Political instability in Rome led to a Civil War beginning in 88&amp;nbsp;BC. With Rome chiefly concerned with a tumultuous domestic predicament, Jannaeus was free to expand the Judean state.  Finally, a weak Seleucid Empire was unable to help Hellenistic cities near Judea. 
	
With a mercenary army similar to that of his father, Jannaeus led a Judean army that conquered the entire coastal plain except for Ashkelon. Jannaeus toppled Western Samaria, the Galilee and the Northern Transjordan. The coastal ports of Dor and Caesarea were also taken after Jannaeus was defeated at Acre. Elsewhere on the Mediterranean coast, the Judeans triumphed over the cities of Raffah and Antedon. Finally, in 96 BC&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=27nq65cZUIgC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;dq=Alexander+Jannaeus+gaza&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8bz2xpKqHy&amp;sig=mm73-iB9TparqnWVWgUKefz86Q8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=q5uhTfinFNORgQeM-PDZBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Alexander%20Jannaeus%20gaza&amp;f=false Archaeological encyclopedia of the Holy Land By Avraham Negev, Shimon Gibson]&lt;/ref&gt; Jannaeus outlasted the inhabitants of Gaza in a year long siege. This impressive victory gained Judean control over the Mediterranean outlet for the Nabatean trade routes.

==War with Ptolemy Lathyrus== 
After a failed siege against Gaza, Jannaeus struck a phony league of friendship with the Egyptian co-ruler [[Ptolemy Lathyrus]]. In reality Jannaeus sought the assistance of Lathyrus’ mother, [[Cleopatra III]], against her son.  When Lathyrus learned of this treachery, he took out his fury on Judea.  After defeating Jannaeus near the Jordan River, Lathyrus’ soldiers slaughtered fleeing Jewish troops. Afterwards, Lathyrus attacked a small village in Judea with utter malice. The Egyptian troops strangled women and children. Then the deceased were cut into pieces, boiled in cauldrons, and eaten as a sacrifice. This act of cannibalism was used to terrify the Judean people and their military.  After this massacre, Jannaeus was in no position to stop the onslaught of Lathyrus. However, Cleopatra III stepped in to prevent Lathyrus from sacking Jerusalem. 

News of this slaughter certainly spread rapidly throughout Judea, exemplified by the Pesher on Isaiah 4Q161 found at Qumran:
“(25) He will shake his fist at the mount of the daughters of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem…(27) when he goes up from the Valley of Acco to fight against Philistia…(29) and even up to the boundaries of Jerusalem.”

==High Priesthood==

It is clear that a strong rift existed between the Pharisees and Alexander Jannaeus. The rival Sadducees were avid supporters of Jannaeus (see 4Q448). The Pharisaic opposition to Jannaeus continued with his marriage to his brother’s widow, which was forbidden by Torah law.  Furthermore, Jannaeus established himself as a ruler concerned mainly with conquests rather than his religious obligations.  

One year during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, Alexander Jannaeus, while officiating as the High Priest (Kohen Gadol) at the Temple in Jerusalem, demonstrated his support of the Sadducees by denying the law of the water libation. The crowd responded with shock at his mockery and showed their displeasure by pelting Alexander with the [[etrog]]im ([[citron]]s) that they were holding in their hands. Unwittingly, the crowd had played right into Alexander's hands. He had intended to incite the people to riot and his soldiers fell upon the crowd at his command. The soldiers slew more than 6,000 people in the Temple courtyard.    

This incident during Tabernacles was a major factor leading up to the Judean Civil War by igniting popular opponents of Jannaeus.  A Qumran document sheds further light on another opponent of Jannaeus. The scroll 4Q390 was written by an adversary of Jannaeus seeking popular support to overthrow the Hasmonean King. The author called for an end to the dispute between Jannaeus and the Pharisees. According to the author, the only acceptable solution was an end to the Hasmonean Priesthood and secular control.  This opposition culminated in the Judean Civil War.

==Judean Civil War and the Crucifixion of the 800==

The Judean Civil War initially began after the conquest of Gaza by Jannaeus. Due to Jannaeus’ victory at Gaza, the Nabatean kingdom no longer controlled their trade routes to Rome and Damascus.  Therefore Nabatean king [[Obodas I]] launched an attack on Judea in the Golan. Potentially, the war with the Nabateans was the last straw against a war-mongering king and an incompetent High Priest. After Jannaeus was defeated in battle against Obadas, he returned to fierce Jewish opposition in Jerusalem. A civil war broke out between Pharisaic supported Jewish rebels and Jannaeus.  

Overall, the war lasted six years and left 50,000 Judeans dead. After Jannaeus succeeded early in the war, the rebels unbelievably asked for Seleucid assistance. Judean insurgents joined forces with Demetrius III to fight against Jannaeus. The Seleucid forces defeated Jannaeus at Schechem and forced him into exile in the mountains.  However, these Judean rebels ultimately decided that it was better to live under a terrible Jewish king than backtrack to a Seleucid ruler.  After 6,000 Jews returned to Jannaeus, Demetrius was defeated. The end of the Civil War brought a sense of national solidarity against Seleucid influence.  Nevertheless, Jannaeus was uninterested in reconciliation within the Judean State. 

The aftermath of the Judean Civil War consisted of popular unrest, poverty and grief over the fallen soldiers on both sides. The greatest impact of the war was the victor’s revenge. Josephus reports that Jannaeus brought 800 rebels to Jerusalem and had them crucified.  Even worse, Jannaeus had the throats of the rebel’s wives and children cut before their eyes as Jannaeus ate with his concubines.   

This incredible account is supported in the Dead Sea Scrolls. In the Nahum Pesher, the Judean Civil War and Jannaeus’ brutal retribution are specifically mentioned.

“(2) The interpretation of it concerns Demetrius, King of Greece, who sought to enter Jerusalem on the advice of the Seeker-After-Smooth-Things. (3) But God did not give Jerusalem into the power of the Kings of Greece from [[Antiochus]] until the rise of the rulers of the [[Kittim]]… (6b) Its interpretation concerns the [[Lion of Wrath]] (7) which will bring vengeance against the Seekers-After-Smooth-Things; he would hang men alive.” 

In this passage, The Seekers-After-Smooth-Things represent the Jewish Rebels, the Lion of Wrath represents Alexander Jannaeus, and the rulers of Kittim signify the Roman Empire.  Given that this passage mentions the Roman takeover, it was clearly written after the fall of the [[Hasmonean Dynasty]]. Nevertheless, substantiation of Josephus’ account of the crucifixion of Jewish rebels by Jannaeus quells any doubt of historicity of this event.

==Coinage==
The coinage of Alexander Jannaeus is characteristic of the early Jewish coinage in that it avoided human or animal representations, in opposition to the surrounding Greek, and later Roman types of the period. Jewish coinage instead focused on symbols, either natural, such as the [[palm tree]], the [[pomegranate]] or the star, or man-made, such as the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]], trumpets or [[cornucopia]].

[[Image:JanaeusCoinPhoto.jpg|thumb|300px|Coin of Alexander Jannaeus ([[103 BC]] to 76 BC).&lt;br&gt;
'''Obv:''' [[Seleucid]] anchor and Greek Legend: BASILEOS ALEXANDROU &quot;King Alexander&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
'''Rev:''' Eight-spoke wheel or star within diadem. Hebrew legend inside the spokes: &quot;Yehonatan the King&quot;.]]
Alexander Jannaeus was the first of the Jewish kings to introduce the &quot;eight-ray star&quot; or &quot;eight-spoked wheel&quot; symbol, in his [[bronze]] &quot;Widow's mite&quot; coins, in combination with the widespread [[Seleucid]] numismatic symbol of the anchor. Depending on the make, the star symbol can be shown with straight spokes connected to the outside circle, in a style rather indicative of a wheel. On others, the spokes can have a more &quot;flame-like&quot; shape, more indicative of the representation of a star within a diadem.

It is not clear what the wheel or star may exactly symbolize, and interpretations vary, from the morning star, to the sun or the heavens. The influence of some [[Persia]]n symbols of a star within a diadem, or the eight-spoked [[Buddhist]] wheel (see the coins of the [[Indo-Greek]] king [[Menander I]] with this symbol) have also been suggested. The eight-spoked Macedonian star (a variation of which is the [[Vergina Sun]]), emblem of the royal [[Argead dynasty]] and the ancient kingdom of [[Macedon]]ia, within a Hellenistic [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadem]] symbolizing royalty (many of the coins depict a small knot with two ends on top of the diadem), seem to be the most probable source for this symbol.

The most likely explanation is that the symbol is a star encased in a diadem and it is a religious explanation. Biblical law forbids the making of graven images (especially see Deuteronomy 4:16,23), yet the image of a monarch is a staple of Hellenistic coins. In place of an image of himself, therefore, it is likely that Alexander Jannaeus chose a star, in keeping with Numbers 24:17, “A star rises from Jacob, a scepter comes forth from Israel.” This verse generally was seen as a biblical support for monarchy (and specifically as support for a Davidic monarchy). Jannaeus, however, could have seen it as an image of his achievements, if not his own rule. This is how the rest of Numbers 24:17 and verses 18 and 19 continue:  The star, it says, “smashes the brow of Moab, the foundation of all children of Seth. Edom becomes a possession, yea, Seir a possession of its enemies; but Israel is triumphant. A victor issues from Jacob to wipe out what is left of Ir.” Considering Jannaeus’ conquests—creating a kingdom that rivaled those of David and Solomon and may have even exceeded those—the “star” envisioned in the prophecy of Balaam in Numbers was a perfect match for him.

==In literature==
Alexander Jannaeus is the main character of the novel ''[[The King of Flesh and Blood]]'', by [[Israel]]i novelist [[Moshe Shamir]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Alexandrists''' were a school of [[Renaissance]] philosophers who, in the great controversy on the subject of personal immortality, adopted the explanation of the ''De Anima'' given by [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]].

According to the orthodox [[Thomism]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Aristotle]] rightly regarded reason as a facility of the individual soul. Against this, the Averroists, led by [[Agostino Nifo]], introduced the modifying theory that universal reason in a sense individualizes itself in each soul and then absorbs the active reason into itself again.  These two theories respectively evolved the doctrine of individual and universal immortality, or the absorption of the individual into the eternal One.

The Alexandrists, led by [[Pietro Pomponazzi]], boldly assailed these beliefs and denied that either was rightly attributed to Aristotle.  They held that Aristotle considered the soul as a material and therefore a mortal entity which operates during life only under the authority of universal reason.  Hence the Alexandrists denied the possibility of any form of immortality, holding that, since the soul is organically connected with the body, the dissolution of the latter involves the extinction of the former.

'''Alexios&amp;nbsp;I Komnenos''', [[Latinization (literature)|Latinized]] as '''Alexius&amp;nbsp;I Comnenus''' ({{lang-el|{{polytonic|Ἀλέξιος&amp;nbsp;Α' Κομνηνός}}}}, 1056 – 15 August 1118—note that some sources list his date of birth as 1048),&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich, pg. 4&quot;&gt;Norwich, pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[List of Byzantine Emperors|emperor]] from 1081 to 1118, and although he was not the founder of [[Komnenos|Komnenian dynasty]], it was during his reign that the Komnenos family came to full power. Inheriting a collapsing empire and faced with constant warfare during his reign against both the [[Seljuq Turks]] in [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] in the western [[Balkans]], Alexios was able to halt the Byzantine decline and begin the military, financial, and territorial recovery known as the &quot;[[Komnenian restoration]]&quot;. His appeals to Western Europe for help against the Turks were also the catalyst that triggered the [[Crusades]].

== Life ==
Alexios was the son of Ioannis Komnenos and [[Anna Dalassena]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Kazhdan, pg. 63&quot;&gt;Kazhdan, pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt; and the nephew of [[Isaac&amp;nbsp;I Komnenos]] (emperor 1057–1059). Alexios' father declined the throne on the abdication of Isaac, who was accordingly succeeded by four emperors of other families between 1059 and 1081. Under one of these emperors, [[Romanos&amp;nbsp;IV Diogenes]] (1067–1071), he served with distinction against the [[Seljuq Turks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich, pg. 4&quot; /&gt; Under [[Michael&amp;nbsp;VII Doukas]] ''Parapinakes'' (1071–1078) and [[Nikephoros&amp;nbsp;III Botaneiates]] (1078–1081), he was also employed, along with his elder brother [[Isaac Komnenos (brother of Alexios I)|Isaac]], against rebels in [[Asia Minor]], [[Thrace]], and in [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]].

Alexios' mother wielded great influence during his reign, and he is described by his daughter, the historian [[Anna Komnene]], as running next to the imperial chariot that she drove. In 1074, the rebel mercenaries in Asia Minor were successfully subdued,&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich, pg. 2&quot;&gt;Norwich, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1078, he was appointed commander of the field army in the West by Nikephoros&amp;nbsp;III.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich, pg. 3&quot;&gt;Norwich, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  In this capacity, Alexios defeated the rebellions of [[Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder]] (whose son or grandson later married Alexios' daughter Anna) and [[Nikephoros Basilakes]], the first at the [[Battle of Kalavrye]] and the latter in a surprise night attack on his camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 277&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 277&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexios was ordered to march against his brother-in-law [[Nikephoros Melissenos]] in Asia Minor but refused to fight his kinsman.  This did not, however, lead to a demotion, as Alexios was needed to counter the expected invasion of the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] of Southern Italy, led by [[Robert Guiscard]].

===Conspiracy and revolt of the Komnenoi against Botaneites===

While the Byzantine troops were assembling for the expedition, Alexios was approached by the Doukas faction at court, who convinced him to join a [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against Nikephoros&amp;nbsp;III. The mother of Alexios, Anna Dalassena, was to play a prominent role in this coup d'état of 1081, along with the current empress, [[Maria of Alania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland, Anna Dalassena&quot;&gt;Garland, &quot;Anna Dalassena&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  First married to Michael&amp;nbsp;VII Doukas and secondly to [[Nikephoros&amp;nbsp;III Botaneiates]], she was preoccupied with the future of her son by Michael&amp;nbsp;VII, [[Constantine Doukas]]. Nikephoros&amp;nbsp;III intended to leave the throne to one of his close relatives,&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 59&quot;&gt;Finlay, pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt; and this resulted in Maria's ambivalence and alliance with the Komnenoi. The real driving force behind this political alliance was Anna Dalassene.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alexiad&quot;, 2.2.1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Already closely connected to the Komnenoi through Maria's cousin Irene to Isaac Komnenos,&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 59&quot; /&gt; the Komnenoi brothers were able to see the empress under the pretense of a friendly family visit. Furthermore, to aid the conspiracy Maria had adopted Alexios as her son, though she was only five years older than he&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich, pg. 5&quot;&gt;Norwich, pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Maria was persuaded to do so on the advice of her own &quot;Alans&quot; and her eunuchs, who had been instigated to do his by Isaac Komnenos. Knowing Anna's tight hold on her family, it must have been with her implicit approval that he be adopted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland, Anna Dalassena&quot;/&gt;  As a result, Alexios and Constantine, Maria's son, were now adoptive brothers and both Isaac and Alexios took an oath that they would safeguard his rights as emperor.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alexiad&quot; 2,1,4–6, 2.3.2–3,2.3.4; cf, Bryennius 4.2, who dates the adoption to early in the reign of Botaneiates&lt;/ref&gt;  By secretly giving inside information to the Komnenoi, Maria was an invaluable ally.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alexiad&quot;, 2.3.4,2.4.5&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated in the Alexiad, Isaac and Alexios left Constantinople in mid-February 1081 to raise an army against Botaneiates.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when the time came, Anna quickly and surreptitiously mobilized the remainder of the family and took refuge in the [[Hagia Sophia]]. From there she negotiated with the emperor for the safety of family members left in the capital, while protesting her sons' innocence of hostile actions; under the falsehood of making a vesperal visit to worship at the church, she deliberately excluded the grandson of Botaneiates and his loyal tutor, met with Alexios and Isaac and fled for the forum of Constantine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland, Anna Dalassena&quot;/&gt;  The tutor found them missing and eventually found them on the palace grounds but she was able to convince him that they would return to the palace shortly. Then to gain entrance to both the outer and inner sanctuary of the church the women pretended to the gatekeepers that they were pilgrims from [[Cappadocia]] who had spent all their funds and wanted to worship before starting their return trip.  However, before they were to gain entry into the sanctuary, Straboromanos and royal guards caught up with them to summon them back to the palace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland, Anna Dalassena&quot;/&gt;  Anna then protested that the family was in fear for their lives, her sons were loyal subjects (Alexios and Isaac were discovered absent without leave), and had learned of a plot by enemies of the Komnenoi to have them both blinded and had, therefore, fled the capital so they may continue to be of loyal service to the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alexiad&quot;,2.5.5&lt;/ref&gt;  She refused to go with them and demanded that they allow her to pray to the Mother of God for protection.  This request was granted and Anna then manifested her true theatrical and manipulative capabilities:
&quot;She was allowed to enter.  As if she were weighed down with old age and worn out by grief, she walked slowly and when she approached the actual entrance to the sanctuary made two genuflections; on the third she sank to the floor and taking firm hold of the sacred doors, cried in a loud voice: &quot;Unless my hands are cuff off, I will not leave this holy place except on one condition: that I receive the emperor's cross as guarantee of safety&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alexiad&quot;, 2.5.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Nikephoros&amp;nbsp;III Botaneiates was forced into a public vow that he would grant protection to the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland, Anna Dalassena&quot;/&gt;  Straboromanos tried to give her his cross, but for Anna this was not sufficiently large enough so that all bystanders could witness the oath.  She also demanded that the cross be personally sent by Botaneiates as a vow of his good faith.  He obliged, sending a complete assurance for the family with his own cross.  At the emperor's further insistence, and for their own protection they took refuge at the convent of Petrion, where eventually they were joined by Irene Doukaina's mother, [[Maria of Bulgaria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland, Anna Dalassena&quot;/&gt;

Botaneiates allowed them to be treated as refugees rather than guests. They were allowed to have family members bring in their own food and were on good terms with the guards from whom they learned the latest news.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alexiad&quot;, 2.5.7–9&lt;/ref&gt; Anna was highly successful in three important aspects of the revolt:  she bought time for her sons to steal imperial horses from the stables and escape the city, she distracted the emperor and gave her sons time to gather and arm their troops and she gave a false sense of security to Botaneiates that there was no real treasonous coup against him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland, Anna Dalassena&quot;/&gt;  After bribing the Western troops who had guarded the city, Isaac and Alexios Komnenos entered the capital victoriously on April 1, 1081.&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Alexios was rumored to be the lover of Empress [[Maria Bagrationi|Maria of Alania]], the daughter of King [[Bagrat&amp;nbsp;IV of Georgia]], who had been successively married to [[Michael&amp;nbsp;VII]] Doukas and his successor Nikephoros&amp;nbsp;III Botaneiates, renowned for her beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexios arranged for Maria to stay on the palace grounds, and it was thought that Alexios was considering marrying the erstwhile empress.  However, his mother consolidated the Doukas family connection by arranging the Emperor's marriage to [[Irene Doukaina]], granddaughter of the [[John Doukas, Caesar|Caesar John Doukas]], the uncle of Michael&amp;nbsp;VII, who would not have supported Alexios otherwise.  As a measure intended to keep the support of the Doukai, Alexios restored [[Constantine Doukas]], the young son of Michael&amp;nbsp;VII and Maria, as co-emperor&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and a little later betrothed him to his own first-born daughter [[Anna Komnene|Anna]], who moved into the Mangana Palace with her fiancé and his mother.

However, this situation changed drastically when Alexios' first son [[John&amp;nbsp;II Komnenos]] was born in 1087:&lt;ref name=&quot;Kazhdan, pg. 658&quot;&gt;Kazhdan, pg. 658&lt;/ref&gt;  Anna's engagement to Constantine was dissolved, and she was moved to the main Palace to live with her mother and grandmother.  Alexios became estranged from Maria, who was stripped of her imperial title and retired to a monastery, and Constantine Doukas was deprived of his status as co-emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kazhdan, pg. 658&quot; /&gt;  Nevertheless, he remained in good relations with the imperial family and succumbed to his weak constitution soon afterwards.

===Wars against the Normans, Pechenegs and Tzachas===
{{Details|Byzantine-Norman Wars}}
[[File:Histamenon nomisma-Alexius I-sb1776.jpg|thumb|300px|This coin was struck by Alexios during his war against [[Robert Guiscard]]. To help pay for his campaigns, Alexios debased the currency during the first decade of his rule. In 1092 however he reformed the coinage, and restored the gold currency in the form of the ''[[hyperpyron]]''.]]
Alexios' long reign of nearly thirty-seven years was full of struggle.  At the very outset, he had to meet the formidable attack of the Normans (led by [[Robert Guiscard]] and his son [[Bohemund I of Antioch|Bohemund]]), who took [[Dyrrhachium]] and [[Corfu]], and laid siege to [[Larissa]] in [[Thessaly]] (see [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|Battle of Dyrrhachium]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 277&quot; /&gt;  Alexios suffered several defeats before being able to strike back with success. He enhanced this by bribing the German king [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&amp;nbsp;IV]] with 360,000 gold pieces to attack the Normans in Italy,&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; which forced the Normans to concentrate on their defenses at home in 1083–1084. He also secured the alliance of [[Henry, Count of Monte Sant'Angelo]], who controlled the [[Gargano Peninsula]] and dated his charters by Alexios' reign. Henry's allegiance was to be the last example of Byzantine political control on peninsular Italy. The Norman danger ended for the time being with Robert Guiscard's death in 1085, and the Byzantines recovered most of their losses.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, Alexios had to deal with disturbances in [[Thrace]], where the heretical sects of the [[Bogomils]] and the [[Paulicians]] revolted and made common cause with the [[Pechenegs]] from beyond the [[Danube]].&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, pg. 101&lt;/ref&gt;  Paulician soldiers in imperial service likewise deserted during Alexios' battles with the Normans.&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, pg. 78&lt;/ref&gt;  As soon as the Norman threat had passed, Alexios set out to punish the rebels and deserters, confiscating their lands. This led to a further revolt near [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]], and the commander of the field army in the west, Gregory Pakourianos, was defeated and killed in the ensuing battle. In 1087 the Pechenegs raided into Thrace and Alexios crossed into [[Moesia]] to retaliate but failed to take Dorostolon ([[Silistra]]).&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;  During his retreat, the emperor was surrounded and worn down by the Pechenegs, who forced him to sign a truce and pay protection money. In 1090 the Pechenegs invaded Thrace again,&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Tzachas]], the brother-in-law of the Sultan of [[Sultanate of Rûm|Rum]], launched a fleet and attempted to arrange a joint siege of Constantinople with the Pechenegs.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexios overcame this crisis by entering into an alliance with a horde of 40,000 [[Cumans]], with whose help he crushed the Pechenegs at [[Battle of Levounion|Levounion]] in Thrace on 29 April 1091.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, pg. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

This put an end to the Pecheneg threat, but in 1094 the Cumans began to raid the imperial territories in the Balkans. Led by a pretender claiming to be Constantine Diogenes, a long-dead son of the Emperor [[Romanos&amp;nbsp;IV]],&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, pg. 86&lt;/ref&gt; the Cumans crossed the mountains and raided into eastern Thrace until their leader was eliminated at [[Adrianople]]. With the Balkans more or less pacified, Alexios could now turn his attention to [[Asia Minor]], which had been almost completely overrun by the [[Seljuq Turks]].&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, pg. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine-Seljuq Wars and the First Crusade===
{{see|Byzantine-Seljuq Wars|First Crusade}}
[[File:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The map of Europe during the [[First Crusade]] in 1097.]]

By the time Alexios ascended the throne, the Seljuqs had taken most of Asia Minor.  Alexios was able to secure much of the coastal regions by sending peasant soldiers to raid the Seljuq camps, but these victories were unable to stop the Turks altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, pg. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as 1090, Alexios had taken reconciliatory measures towards the [[Papacy]],&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt; with the intention of seeking western support against the Seljuqs. In 1095 his ambassadors appeared before [[Pope Urban&amp;nbsp;II]] at the [[Council of Piacenza]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 279&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 279&lt;/ref&gt;  The help which he wanted from the West was simply [[mercenary]] forces and not the immense hosts which arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment, after the pope preached the [[First Crusade]] at the [[Council of Clermont]] later that same year.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, pg. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  Not quite ready to supply this number of people as they traversed his territories, the emperor saw his Balkan possessions subjected to further pillage at the hands of his own allies.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexios dealt with the first disorganized group of Crusaders, led by the preacher [[Peter the Hermit]], by sending them on to Asia Minor, where they were massacred by the Turks in 1096.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kazhdan, pg. 1479&quot;&gt;Kazhdan, pg. 1479&lt;/ref&gt;

The second and much more formidable host of crusaders gradually made its way to [[Constantinople]], led in sections by [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], [[Bohemund I of Antioch|Bohemund of Taranto]], [[Raymond&amp;nbsp;IV of Toulouse]] and other important members of the western nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, pg. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexios used the opportunity of meeting the crusader leaders separately as they arrived and extracting from them oaths of homage and the promise to turn over conquered lands to the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, pg. 123&lt;/ref&gt;  Transferring each contingent into Asia, Alexios promised to supply them with provisions in return for their oaths of homage. The crusade was a notable success for Byzantium, as Alexios now recovered a number of important cities and islands. The [[siege of Nicaea|crusader siege]] of [[İznik|Nicaea]] forced the city to surrender to the emperor in 1097, and the subsequent crusader victory at [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Dorylaion]] allowed the Byzantine forces to recover much of western Asia Minor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich, pg. 42&quot;&gt;Norwich, pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Doukas (megas doux)|John Doukas]] re-established Byzantine rule in [[Chios]], [[Rhodes]], [[Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Sardis]], and [[Alasehir|Philadelphia]] in 1097–1099. This success is ascribed by Alexios' daughter Anna to his policy and diplomacy, but by the Latin historians of the crusade to his treachery and falseness. In 1099, a Byzantine fleet of 10 ships were sent to assist the Crusaders in capturing [[Laodicea in Syria|Laodicea]] and other coastal towns as far as [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]]. The crusaders believed their oaths were made invalid when the Byzantine contingent under [[Tatikios]] failed to help them during the [[siege of Antioch]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 279&quot; /&gt; Bohemund, who had set himself up as [[Principality of Antioch|Prince of Antioch]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich, pg. 42&quot; /&gt; briefly went to war with Alexios in the Balkans, but was blockaded by the Byzantine forces and agreed to become Alexios' vassal by the [[Treaty of Devol]] in 1108.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last twenty years of his life Alexios lost much of his popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, pg. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  The years were marked by persecution of the followers of the [[Paulicianism|Paulician]] and [[Bogomilism|Bogomil]] heresies&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, pg. 81&lt;/ref&gt;—one of his last acts was to publicly burn at the stake [[Basil the Physician|Basil]], a Bogomil leader, with whom he had engaged in a theological dispute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kazhdan, pg. 1479&quot; /&gt; In spite of the success of the crusade, Alexios also had to repel numerous attempts on his territory by the Seljuqs in 1110–1117.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, pg. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexios was for many years under the strong influence of an ''eminence grise'', his mother [[Anna Dalassene]], a wise and immensely able politician whom, in a uniquely irregular fashion, he had crowned as ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' instead of the rightful claimant to the title, his wife Irene Doukaina.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  Dalassena was the effective administrator of the Empire during Alexios' long absences in military campaigns: she was constantly at odds with her daughter-in-law and had assumed total responsibility for the upbringing and education of her granddaughter Anna Komnene.

===Succession===
Alexios' last years were also troubled by anxieties over the succession. Although he had crowned his son [[John&amp;nbsp;II Komnenos]] co-emperor at the age of five in 1092, John's mother Irene Doukaina wished to alter the succession in favor of her daughter Anna and Anna's husband, [[Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich, pg. 61&quot;&gt;Norwich, pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  Bryennios had been made ''[[Caesar (title)|kaisar]]'' (Caesar) and received the newly-created title of ''[[panhypersebastos]]'' (&quot;honoured above all&quot;), and remained loyal to both Alexios and John. Nevertheless, the intrigues of Irene and Anna disturbed even Alexios' dying hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 279&quot; /&gt;

==Pretenders and rebels==
Apart from all of his external enemies, a host of rebels also sought to overthrow Alexios from the imperial throne, thereby posing another major threat to his reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kazhdan, pg. 1479&quot; /&gt;  Due to the troubled times the empire was enduring, he had by far the greatest number of rebellions against him of all the Byzantine emperors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 71&quot;&gt;Finlay, pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  These included:

===Pre First Crusade===
* [[Raictor]], a Byzantine monk who claimed to be the emperor [[Michael&amp;nbsp;VII]]. He presented himself to [[Robert Guiscard]] who used him as a pretext to launch his invasion of the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 71&quot; /&gt;
* A conspiracy in 1084 involving several senators and officers of the army. This was uncovered before too many followers were enlisted. In order to conceal the importance of the conspiracy, Alexios merely banished the wealthiest plotters and confiscated their estates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 71&quot; /&gt;
* [[Chaka Bey|Tzachas]], a [[Seljuq Turks|Seljuq Turkic]] [[emir]] who assumed the title of emperor in 1092.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 72&quot;&gt;Finlay, pg. 72&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Constantine Humbertopoulos]], who had assisted Alexios in gaining the throne in 1081 conspired against him in 1091 with an [[Armenians|Armenian]] called Ariebes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 72&quot; /&gt;
* [[John Komnenos (governor of Dyrrhachium)|John Komnenos]], Alexios’ nephew, governor of [[Dyrrachium]], accused of a conspiracy by [[Theophylact of Bulgaria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 72&quot; /&gt;
* [[Theodore Gabras]], the quasi-independent governor of [[Trebizond]] and his son [[Gregory Gabras|Gregory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 72&quot; /&gt;
* [[Michael Taronites]], the [[brother-in-law]] of Alexios.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 72&quot; /&gt;
* [[Nikephoros Diogenes]], the son of emperor [[Romanos&amp;nbsp;IV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 72&quot; /&gt;
* [[Pseudo-Constantine Diogenes]], an impostor who assumed the identity of another of Romanos’ sons, Constantine Diogenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 73&quot;&gt;Finlay, pg. 73&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Karykes]], the leader of a revolt in [[Crete]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 72&quot; /&gt;
* [[Rhapsomates]], who tried to create an independent kingdom in [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 72&quot; /&gt;

===Post First Crusade===
* [[Salomon (senator)|Salomon]], a [[Byzantine Senate|senator]] of great wealth who in 1106 engaged in a plot with four brothers of the Anemas family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 74&quot;&gt;Finlay, pg. 74&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gregory Taronites]], another governor of Trebizond.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 74&quot; /&gt;
* The illegitimate descendant of a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] prince named Aron formed a plot in 1107 to murder Alexios as he was encamped near [[Thessalonica]]. Unfortunately, the presence of the empress Irene and her attendants made the execution of the plot difficult. In an attempt to have her return to [[Constantinople]], the conspirators produced pamphlets that mocked and slandered the empress, and left them in her tent. A search for the author of the publications uncovered the whole plot, yet Aron was only banished due to his connection of the royal line of Bulgaria, whose blood also flowed in the veins of the empress Irene.&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, pg. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Alexios&amp;nbsp;I had stabilized the Byzantine Empire and overcame a dangerous crisis, inaugurating a century of imperial prosperity and success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich, pg. 61&quot; /&gt;  He had also profoundly altered the nature of the Byzantine government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 69&quot;&gt;Finlay, pg. 69&lt;/ref&gt;  By seeking close alliances with powerful noble families, Alexios put an end to the tradition of imperial exclusivity and coopted most of the nobility into his extended family and, through it, his government. Those who did not become part of this extended family were deprived of power and prestige.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kazhdan, pg. 1479&quot; /&gt;  This measure, which was intended to diminish opposition, was paralleled by the introduction of new courtly dignities, like that of ''[[panhypersebastos]]'' given to Nikephoros Bryennios, or that of ''[[sebastokrator]]'' given to the emperor's brother Isaac Komnenos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finlay, pg. 69&quot; /&gt;  Although this policy met with initial success, it gradually undermined the relative effectiveness of imperial bureaucracy by placing family connections over merit. Alexios' policy of integration of the nobility bore the fruit of continuity: every Byzantine emperor who reigned after Alexios&amp;nbsp;I Komnenos was related to him by either descent or marriage.

== Family ==
By his marriage with [[Irene Doukaina]], Alexios&amp;nbsp;I had the following children:
# [[Anna Komnene]], who married the ''Caesar'' [[Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger]].
# Maria Komnene, who married (1) Gregory Gabras and (2) [[Nikephoros Katakalon]].
# [[John&amp;nbsp;II Komnenos]], who succeeded as emperor.
# Andronikos Komnenos, ''[[sebastokrator]]''.
# [[Isaac Komnenos (son of Alexios I)|Isaac Komnenos]], ''sebastokrator''.
# Eudokia Komnene, who married Michael Iasites.
# [[Theodora Komnene Angelina|Theodora Komnene]], who married (1) Constantine Kourtikes and (2) Constantine Angelos. By him she was the grandmother of Emperors [[Isaac&amp;nbsp;II Angelos]] and [[Alexios&amp;nbsp;III Angelos]].
# Manuel Komnenos
# Zoe Komnene.

'''Alexis'''  ([[Ancient Greek]]:{{polytonic|Ἄλεξις}}, 394 BC &amp;ndash; c. 275 BC) was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[comedian|comic]] [[poet]] of the [[Middle Comedy]], born at [[Thurii]] in [[Magna Graeca]] and taken early to [[Athens]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Suda]]'' ''[[sub verbo|s.v.]]'' {{polytonic|Ἀλέξης}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he became a citizen, of the [[deme]] ''Oion'' ({{polytonic|Οἶον}}), and the tribe [[Leontides]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], ''[[sub verbo|s.v.]]'' {{polytonic|Ἀλέξης}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Greenhill | first = William Alexander | authorlink = | title = Alexis (1) | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 128–129 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=acl3129.0001.001;q1=demosthenes;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was said he had a son, called [[Stephanus]], who also wrote thrillers.&lt;ref&gt;''Suda'' ''[[sub verbo|s.v.]]'' {{polytonic|Ἀλέξης}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appears to have been rather addicted to the pleasures of the table, according to [[Athenaeus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, ''Deipnosophistae'' viii. p. 344''&lt;/ref&gt; 

He won his first [[Lenaean]] victory in the 350s BC, most likely, where he was sixth after [[Eubulus (poet)|Eubulus]], and fourth after [[Antiphanes (comic poet)|Antiphanes]].   

While being a Middle Comic poet, Alexis was contemporary with several leading figures of New Comedy, such as Philppides, [[Philemon (poet)|Philemon]], [[Diphilus]], and even [[Menander]]. There is also some evidence that, during his old age, he wrote plays in the style of New Comedy.

[[Plutarch]] says that he lived to the age of 106, and that he died on the stage while being crowned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Defect. Orac.'' p. 420 e&lt;/ref&gt; He was certainly alive after 345 BC, for [[Aeschines]] mentions him as alive in that year. It is  likely that he lived as late as 288 BC  According to the ''[[Suda]]'', he wrote 245 comedies, of which some 130 titles are preserved. His plays include 
Meropis,
Agkylion,
Olympiodoros, and 
Parasitos, in which he ridiculed [[Plato]], was exhibited in 360 BC. 
Also, Agonis, in which he ridiculed Misgolas. 
And The Adelphoi and the Stoatiotes, in which he satirized [[Demosthenes]], and acted shorted after 343 BC. 
Also The Hippos, in which he referred to the decree of Sophocles against the philosophers, in 316 BC. 
Pyraynos (312 BC),
Pharmakopole (306 BC),
Hyobolimaios (306 BC),
Analion.&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;/&gt;

Because he wrote a lot of plays, same passages often appear in more than 3 plays. It was said that he also borrowed from [[Eubulus (poet)|Eubulus]] and many other playwrights in some of his plays.&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, i. p.25, f.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Carystius|Carytius of Pergamum]], Alexis was the first to use the part of the parasite.&lt;ref&gt;Athen. vi. p.235, f. This is incorrect, because [[Epicharmus of Kos|Epicharmus]] had already introduced it 250 years earlier. However, Alexis may have been the first to develop the part into its common form.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only fragments of any of the plays have survived - about 340 in all, totaling about 1,000 lines. They attest to the wit and refinement of the author, which [[Athenaeus]] praises.&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus. ii. p.59, f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving fragments also show that Alexis invented a great deal of words, mostly compound words. They also show that Alexis used normal words in an unusual way, or making strange and unusual forms of common words. The main sources of the fragments of Alexis are [[Stobaeus]] and [[Athenaeus]].
    
The ''[[Suda]]'' also calls him [[Zoe]]'s [[uncle]], but an anonymous [[tractate]] on comedy more plausibly states that he was the teacher and uncle of [[Menander]] (however this statement may be spurious). Alexis was known in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times; [[Aulus Gellius]] noted that Alexis' poetry was used by Roman comedians, including [[Turpilius]] and possibly [[Plautus]].

'''Alexios II Komnenos''' or '''Alexius II Comnenus''' ({{lang-el|Αλέξιος Β’ Κομνηνός, ''Alexios II Komnēnos''}}) (10 September 1169 – 24 September 1183, [[Constantinople]]), [[Byzantine emperor]] (1180–1183), was the son of Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] and [[Maria of Antioch|Maria]], daughter of [[Raymond of Antioch|Raymond]], [[Principality of Antioch|prince of Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;An alternative date of birth occasionally given is 1168 {{Harv|van Dieten|1975|p=169}}, based on [[William of Tyre]]'s statement that Alexios was 13 in 1180. For discussion, concluding that 14 September 1169 is correct, see {{Harv|Wirth|1956}}; {{Harv|Magoulias|1984|p=383}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the long-awaited male heir, and was named Alexius as a fulfilment of the [[AIMA prophecy]].

==His reign and death==
[[Image:Byzantium1173.JPG|thumb|right|350px|The Empire in 1180 A.D when Alexios II became Emperor]]On Manuel's death in 1180, Maria, who became a nun under the name Xene (&quot;foreigner&quot;), took the position of regent (according to some historians). She excluded her young son from power, entrusting it instead to Alexios the ''[[protosebastos|prōtosebastos]]'' (a cousin of Alexios II), who was popularly believed to be her lover. Friends of the young Alexios II now tried to form a party against the empress mother and the prōtosebastos; Alexios II's half-sister Maria, wife of Caesar John ([[Renier of Montferrat]]), stirred up riots in the streets of the capital.

Their party was defeated (May 2, 1182), but [[Andronikos I Komnenos|Andronikos Komnenos]], a first cousin of Emperor Manuel, took advantage of these disorders to aim at the crown, entered Constantinople, where he was received with almost divine honours, and overthrew the government. His arrival was celebrated by a [[Massacre of the Latins|massacre of 80,000 Latins]] in Constantinople, especially the [[Venice|Venetian]] merchants, which he made no attempt to stop. He allowed Alexios II to be crowned, but was responsible for the death of most of the young emperor's actual or potential defenders, including his mother, his half-sister and the Caesar, and refused to allow him the smallest voice in public affairs.

The betrothal in 1180 of Alexios II to [[Agnes of France, Empress consort of the Eastern Roman Empire|Agnes of France]], daughter of [[Louis VII of France]] and his third wife [[Adèle of Champagne]] and at the time a child of nine, had not apparently been followed by their marriage. Andronikos was now formally proclaimed as co-emperor, and not long afterwards, on the pretext that divided rule was injurious to the Empire, he caused Alexios II to be strangled with a bow-string (October 1183). During Alexius II's reign, the Byzantine Empire was invaded by King [[Bela III]] losing [[Syrmia]] and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] to the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in AD 1181, later even [[Dalmatia]] was lost to the Venetians. [[Kilij Arslan II]] invaded the empire in AD 1182, defeating the Byzantines at the [[Siege of Cotyaeum]] resulting in the Byzantine Empire losing [[Cotyaeum]] and [[Sozopolis]].

==Portrayal in fiction==
[[File:Alexios II - komnenos.jpg|200px|thumb|Alexios II from &quot;Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum &quot;]]
Alexios is a character in the historical novel ''Agnes of France'' (1980) by [[Greece|Greek]] writer [[Kostas Kyriazis]]. The novel describes the events of the reigns of Manuel I, Alexios II and Andronikos I through the eyes of Agnes.

'''Alexios III Angelos''' ({{lang-el|Αλέξιος Γ' Άγγελος}}) (c. 1153–1211) was [[Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine emperor]] from 1195 to 1203.

== Early life==
Alexios III Angelos was the second son of Andronikos Angelos and Euphrosyne Kastamonitissa. Andronicus was himself a son of Theodora Komnene, the youngest daughter of Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] and [[Irene Doukaina]]. Thus Alexios Angelos was a member of the extended imperial family. Together with his father and brothers, Alexios had conspired against Emperor [[Andronikos I Komnenos]] (c. 1183), and thus he spent several years in exile in Muslim courts, including that of [[Saladin]].

His younger brother [[Isaac II Angelos|Isaac]] was threatened with execution under orders of their first-cousin once-removed Andronikos I Komnenos on September 11, 1185. Isaac made a desperate attack on the imperial agents and killed their leader [[Stephen Hagiochristophorites]]. He then took refuge in the church of [[Hagia Sophia]] and from there appealed to the populace. His actions provoked a riot, which resulted in the deposition of Andronikos I and the proclamation of Isaac as emperor. Alexios was now closer to the imperial throne than ever before.

== Reign==
By 1190 Alexios Angelos had returned to the court of his younger brother, from whom he received the elevated title of ''[[sebastokrator|sebastokratōr]]''. In 1195, while Isaac II was away hunting in [[Thrace]], Alexios was acclaimed as emperor by the troops with the conniving of Alexios' wife [[Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera]]. Alexios captured Isaac at [[Stagira]] in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|put out his eyes]], and thenceforth kept him a close prisoner, though he had been redeemed by him from captivity at [[Antioch]] and loaded with honours.

To compensate for this crime and to solidify his position as emperor, Alexios had to scatter money so lavishly as to empty his treasury, and to allow such licence to the officers of the army as to leave the Empire practically defenceless. He thus consummated the financial ruin of the state. In 1195, Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI forced Alexios III to pay him a tribute of 1,000 pounds of gold (originally 5,000 pounds of gold). The able and forceful empress Euphrosyne tried in vain to sustain his credit and his court; Vatatzes, the favourite instrument of her attempts at reform, was [[assassination|assassinated]] by the emperor's orders. 

In the east the Empire was overrun by the [[Seljuk Turks]]; from the north [[Bulgarians]] and [[Vlachs]] descended unchecked to ravage the plains of Macedonia and Thrace, and [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]] annexed several important cities, while Alexios squandered the public treasure on his palaces and gardens and attempted to deal with the crisis through diplomatic means. The emperor's attempts to bolster the empire's defenses by special concessions to Byzantine and Bulgarian notables in the frontier zone backfired, as the latter built up regional autonomy. Byzantine authority survived, but in a much weakened state.

== Fourth Crusade==
Soon Alexios was threatened by a new and yet more formidable danger. In 1202, soldiers assembled at [[Venice]] launched the [[Fourth Crusade]]. [[Alexios IV Angelos]], the son of the deposed Isaac II, had recently escaped from [[Constantinople]] and now appealed to the crusaders, promising to end the [[East-West Schism|schism]] of [[Eastern Orthodoxy|East]] and [[Roman Catholicism|West]], to pay for their transport, and to provide military support to the crusaders if they helped him to depose his uncle and sit on his father's throne.

The crusaders, whose objective had been [[Egypt]], were persuaded to set their course for Constantinople before which they appeared in June 1203, proclaiming Alexios as emperor and inviting the populace of the capital to depose his uncle. Alexios III took no efficient measures to resist, and his attempts to bribe the crusaders failed. His son-in-law, [[Theodore I Laskaris|Theodore Laskaris]], who was the only one to attempt anything significant, was defeated at [[Scutari]], and the siege of Constantinople began. Unfortunately for Constantinople, Alexios III's misgovernment had left the Byzantine navy with only 20 worm-eaten hulks by the time the Crusaders arrived.

In July, the crusaders, led by the aged [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Enrico Dandolo]], scaled the walls and took control of a major section. In the ensuing fighting, the crusaders set the city on fire, ultimately leaving 20,000 people homeless.  Alexios III finally took action, and led 17 divisions from the [[Gate of St. Romanus|St. Romanus Gate]], vastly outnumbering the crusaders.  But his courage failed, and the Byzantine army returned to the city without a fight.   His courtiers demanded action, and Alexios promised to fight. Instead, that night (July 17/18), Alexios III hid in the palace, and finally, with one of his daughters, Eirene, and such treasures (1,000 pounds of gold) as he could collect, got into a boat and escaped to [[Debeltos]] in [[Thrace]], leaving his wife and his other daughters behind. Isaac II, drawn from his prison and robed once more in the imperial purple, received his son in state.

== Life in exile==
Alexios attempted to organize a resistance to the new regime from [[Adrianople]] and then [[Mosynopolis]], where he was joined by the later usurper [[Alexios V Doukas|Alexios V Doukas ''Mourtzouphlos'']] in April 1204, after the definitive fall of Constantinople to the crusaders and the establishment of the [[Latin Empire]].

At first Alexios III received Alexios V well, even allowing him to marry his daughter [[Eudokia Angelina]]. Later Alexios V was blinded and deserted by his father-in-law, who fled from the crusaders into [[Thessaly]]. Here Alexios III eventually surrendered, with Euphrosyne, to Marquis [[Boniface of Montferrat]], who was establishing himself as ruler of the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]].

Trying to escape Boniface's &quot;protection&quot;, Alexios III attempted to seek shelter with [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas]], the ruler of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], in 1205. Captured by Boniface, Alexios and his retinue were sent to [[Montferrat]], before being brought back to [[Thessalonica]] in c. 1209. At that point the deposed emperor was ransomed by Michael I of Epirus, who sent him to [[Asia Minor]], where Alexios' son-in-law [[Theodore I Laskaris]] of the [[Empire of Nicaea]] was holding his own against the Latins.

Here Alexios III conspired against his son-in-law after the latter refused to recognize Alexios' authority, and received the support of [[Kay Khusrau I]], the [[sultan]] of [[Sultanate of Rûm|Rûm]]. In the battle of [[Battle of Antioch on the Meander|Antioch]] on the [[Maeander River|Maeander]] in 1211, the sultan was defeated and killed, and Alexios III was captured by Theodore Laskaris. Alexius III was then confined to a [[monastery]] at [[İznik|Nicaea]], where he died later in 1211.

==Family==
By his marriage to [[Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera]] Alexios had three daughters:
* Eirene Angelina, who married (1) Andronikos Kontostephanos, and (2) Alexios Palaiologos, by whom she was the grandmother of Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]].
* [[Anna Angelina]], who married (1) the ''sebastokrator'' Isaac Komnenos, great-nephew of emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]], and (2) [[Theodore Laskaris]], emperor of Nicaea.
* [[Eudokia Angelina]], who married (1) King [[Stefan Prvovenčani of Serbia|Stefan I ''Prvovenčani'']] of [[Medieval Serbia|Serbia]], then (2) Emperor [[Alexios V Doukas]], and (3) [[Leo Sgouros]], ruler of [[Byzantine Corinth|Corinth]].

'''Alexios V Doukas''', surnamed '''Mourtzouphlos''' ({{lang-el|{{polytonic|Ἀλέξιος Δούκας Μούρτζουφλος}}}}, d. December 1205, [[Constantinople]]) was [[Byzantine emperor]] (5 February &amp;ndash; 12 April 1204) during the [[siege of Constantinople (1204)|second and final siege]] of [[Constantinople]] by the participants of the [[Fourth Crusade]]. He was related to the imperial [[Doukas]] family.

His nickname &quot;Mourtzouphlos&quot; referred to either his bushy, overhanging eyebrows or his sullen character. The term has the meaning of one being crestfallen, depressed, despondent, downcast, gloomy, sullen and evidently frowning, scowling.

A Byzantine nobleman, he had risen to the court position of ''[[protovestiarios]]'' by the time of the Fourth Crusade. He had been married twice but was now allegedly the lover of [[Eudokia Angelina]], a daughter of Emperor [[Alexios III Angelos]]. His participation in the attempted usurpation of [[John Komnenos the Fat]] in 1200 had caused him to be imprisoned until the accession of [[Isaac II Angelos]], who was restored to the throne after having been deposed and imprisoned by his brother Alexios III, and his son [[Alexios IV Angelos]], who were placed on the throne by the intervention of the Fourth Crusade in July 1203.

By the beginning of 1204, Isaac II and Alexios IV had inspired little confidence among the people of Constantinople in their efforts to defend the city from the Latins and Venetians, who were restless and rioted when the money and aid promised by Alexios IV was not forthcoming. Alexios Doukas emerged as a leader of the anti-Latin movement and personally led some skirmishes against the crusaders. When the populace rebelled in late January 1204, the emperors barricaded themselves in the palace and entrusted Alexios Doukas with a mission to seek help from the crusaders. Instead, Alexios Doukas used his access to the palace to arrest the emperors. The young Alexios IV was strangled in prison, while his father Isaac died shortly afterwards, his death variously attributed to fright, sorrow, or foul play.  Alexios V Doukas was crowned in early February 1204.

After his coronation, Alexios V began to strengthen the [[Walls of Constantinople|defenses]] of [[Constantinople]] and ended negotiations with the Latins. It was too late, however, for the new Emperor to make much of a difference. An attempted surprise attack against the crusader camp failed despite the emperor's personal leadership. During the ensuing fight, he defended the city with courage and tenacity, beating back the crusader assault of 9 April. The crusaders' second attack proved too strong to repel, and Alexios V fled into [[Thrace]] on the night of 12 April 1204, accompanied by Eudokia Angelina and her mother [[Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera]]. Constantinople was under Latin control by the next day.

The refugees reached [[Mosynopolis]], the base of the deposed emperor Alexios III Angelos, where they were initially well received, and Alexios V married Eudokia Angelina.  Later, however, Alexios III arranged for his new son-in-law to be ambushed and blinded, making him ineligible for the imperial throne.  Abandoned by his supporters and enemies alike, Alexios V was captured near Mosynopolis by the advancing Latins under Thierry de Loos in November 1204.  Brought back to Constantinople, Alexios V was condemned to death for treason against Alexios IV, and was thrown from the top of the [[Column of Theodosius]]. He was the last Byzantine emperor to reign in Constantinople before the establishment of the [[Latin Empire]], which controlled the city for the next 57 years, until it was recovered by the [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaean emperor]] [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]].

'''Alexei Petrovich Romanov''' ({{lang-ru|Алексей Петрович}}) ({{OldStyleDate|28 February|1690|18 February}} &amp;ndash; {{OldStyleDate|7 July|1718|26 June}}), was a [[Russia]]n [[Tsarevich]]. He was born in [[Moscow]], the son of Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] and his first wife [[Eudoxia Lopukhina]].

==Childhood==
The young Alexei was brought up by his mother, who fostered an atmosphere of disdain towards [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], Alexei's father. Alexei's relations with his father suffered from the hatred between his father and his mother, as it was very difficult for him to feel affection for his mother's worst persecutor. From the ages of 6 to 9, Alexei was educated by his tutor Vyazemsky, but after the removal of his mother by Peter the Great to the [[Suzdal]] Intercession Convent, Alexei was confined to the care of educated foreigners, who taught him history, geography, mathematics and French. One of his teachers named Kyle Holland, influenced young Alexei the most. He taught Alexei how geography, mathematics, etc. can be used in war.

==Military career==
In 1703, Alexei was ordered to follow the army to the field as a private in a [[artillery|bombardier]] regiment. In 1704, he was present at the capture of [[Narva]]. At this period, the preceptors of the Tsarevich had the highest opinion of his ability. Alexei had strong leanings towards [[archaeology]] and [[ecclesiology]]. However, Peter had wished his son and heir to dedicate himself to the service of new [[Russia]], and demanded from him unceasing labour in order to maintain Russia's new wealth and power. Painful relations between father and son, quite apart from the prior personal antipathies, were therefore inevitable. It was an additional misfortune for Alexei that his father should have been too busy to attend to him just as he was growing up from boyhood to manhood. He was left in the hands of [[reactionary]] [[boyars]] and priests, who encouraged him to hate his father and wish for the death of the Tsar.

In 1708 Peter sent Alexei to [[Smolensk]] to collect [[food|provender]] and recruits, and after that to [[Moscow]] to fortify it against [[Charles XII of Sweden]]. At the end of 1709, Alexei went to [[Dresden]] for one year. There, he finished lessons in French, German, mathematics and fortification. After his education, Alexei married, albeit greatly against his will [[Charlotte of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Princess Charlotte of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]], whose family was connected by marriage to many of the great families of Europe i.e., Charlotte's sister [[Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Elizabeth]] was married to [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI]], ruler of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. In theory, Alexei could have refused the marriage, and he had been encouraged by his father to at least meet his intended. &quot;Why haven't you written to tell me what you thought about her?&quot;  wrote Peter (in a tone that can only be guessed) in a letter dated  13 August 1710.

The marriage contract was signed in September. The wedding was celebrated at [[Torgau]], the palace of the [[Christiane Eberhardine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Queen of Poland]], on  14 October 1711. One of the terms of the marriage contract agreed to by Alexei was that while any forthcoming children were to be raised in the Orthodox faith, Charlotte herself was allowed to retain her Protestant faith (an agreement that did not sit well at all with Alexei's followers).

As for the marriage itself, it was a failure from the very start. Alexei pronounced his bride &quot;pock-marked&quot; and &quot;too thin&quot;. He insisted on separate apartments and ignored her in public.

Three weeks later, the bridegroom was hurried away by his father to [[Toruń]] to superintend the provisioning of the Russian troops in Poland. For the next twelve months Alexei was kept constantly on the move. His wife joined him at Toruń in December, but in April 1712 a peremptory [[ukase]] ordered him off to the army in [[Pomerania]], and in the autumn of the same year he was forced to accompany his father on a tour of inspection through [[Finland]].

By Charlotte, he had two children.

*Natalia Alexeievna Romanova (3 March 1714 &amp;ndash; 3 November 1728)
*[[Peter II of Russia|Peter Alexeievich Romanov]] (23 October 1715 &amp;ndash; 30 January 1730)&lt;ref&gt;Peter Alexeyevich would succeed as [[Tsar]] [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]] in 1727. With Peter's death, the direct male-line of the House of Romanov became extinct.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the birth of Natalia in 1714, Alexei brought his long-time Finnish serf [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] [[Yefrosinya Fedorov|Afrosinia]]&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar, Michael (2001). ''A Treasure of Royal Scandals'', p.115. Penguin Books, New York. ISBN 0739420259.&lt;/ref&gt; to live in the palace. Some historians speculate that it was his conservative powerbase's disapproval of his foreign, non-Orthodox bride, more so than her appearance, that caused Alexei to spurn Charlotte. Another influence was [[Alexander Kikin]], a high-placed official who had fallen out with the Tsar and had been deprived of his estates.

==Self-exile==
Immediately on his return from Finland, Alexei was dispatched by his father to [[Staraya Russa]] and [[Lake Ladoga]] to see to the building of new ships. This was the last commission entrusted to him, since Peter had not been satisfied with his son's performance and his lack of enthusiasm. Nevertheless, Peter made one last effort to &quot;reclaim&quot; his son. On  11 October 1715, Charlotte died, after giving birth to a son, the grand-duke Peter, future tsar [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]]. On the day of the funeral, Peter sent Alexei a stern letter, urging him to take interest in the affairs of the state. Peter threatened to cut him off if he did not acquiesce in his father's plans. Alexei wrote a pitiful reply to his father, offering to renounce the succession in favour of his baby half-brother Peter. Furthermore, in January of 1716, Alexei asked his father for permission to become a [[monk]].

Still, Peter did not despair. On the  26 August 1716 he wrote to Alexei from abroad, urging him, if he desired to remain [[tsarevich]], to join him and the army without delay. Rather than face this ordeal, Alexei fled to [[Vienna]] and placed himself under the protection of his brother-in-law, the emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]], who sent him for safety first to the [[Tirol Castle|Tirol]]ean fortress of Ehrenberg (near [[Reutte]]), and finally to the castle of [[Sant'Elmo]] at [[Naples]]. He was accompanied throughout his journey by his mistress, Afrosinia. That the emperor sincerely sympathized with Alexei, and suspected Peter of harbouring murderous designs against his son, is plain from his confidential letter to [[George I of Great Britain]], whom he consulted on this delicate affair. Peter felt insulted: the flight of the tsarevich to a foreign potentate was a reproach and a scandal, and he had to be recovered and brought back to Russia at all costs. This difficult task was accomplished by Count [[Peter Tolstoi]], the most subtle and unscrupulous of Peter's servants.

==The return==
Alexei would only consent to return on his father solemnly swearing, that if he came back he should not be punished in the least, but cherished as a son and allowed to live quietly on his estates and marry Afrosinia. On 31 January 1718, the tsarevich reached Moscow. Peter had already determined to institute a most searching [[inquisition]] in order to get at the bottom of the mystery of the flight. On 18 February a &quot;confession&quot; was extorted from Alexei which implicated most of his friends, and he then publicly renounced the succession to the throne in favour of the baby grand-duke Peter Petrovich. A horrible reign of terror ensued, in the course of which the ex-tsaritsa Eudoxia was dragged from her monastery and publicly tried for alleged [[adultery]], while all who had in any way befriended Alexei were [[Impalement|impaled]], broken on the wheel and otherwise lingeringly done to death. All this was done to terrorize the reactionaries and isolate the tsarevich.

In April 1718 fresh confessions were extorted from, and in regard to, Alexei. This included the words of Afrosinia, who had turned state's evidence. &quot;I shall bring back the old people...&quot; Alexei is reported to have told her,
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;...and choose myself new ones according to my will;
when I become sovereign I shall live in Moscow and leave Saint Petersburg
simply as any other town; I won't launch any ships; I shall maintain troops
only for defense, and won't make war on anyone; I shall be content with
the old domains. In winter I shall live in Moscow, and in summer
in Iaroslav.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite this and other hearsay evidence, there were no actual facts to go upon. The worst that could be brought against him was that he had wished his father's death. In the eyes of Peter, his son was now a self-convicted and most dangerous traitor, whose life was forfeit. But there was no getting over the fact that his father had sworn to pardon him and let him live in peace if he returned to Russia. The whole matter was solemnly submitted to a grand council of [[prelate]]s, [[Governing Senate|senator]]s, [[Minister (government)|ministers]] and other [[Dignitary|dignitaries]] on 13 June 1718. The [[clergy]], for their part, declared the Tsarevich Alexei,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;...had placed his Confidence in those who loved the ancient
Customs, and that he had become acquainted with them by the Discourses
they held, wherein they had constantly praised the ancient Manners, and
spoke with Distaste of the Novelties his Father had introduced.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Declaring this to be a civil rather than an ecclesiastical matter, the clergy left the matter to the tsar's own decision.

At noon on 24 June, the temporal dignitaries—the 126 members of both the Senate and magistrates that comprised the court—declared Alexei guilty and sentenced him to death. But the examination by torture continued, so desperate was Peter to uncover any possible collusion.

On 19 June, the weak and ailing tsarevich received twenty-five strokes with the [[knout]], and then, on the 24th, he was subject to fifteen more. On 26 June, Alexei died in the [[Petropavlovskaya fortress]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], two days after the senate had condemned him to death for conspiring rebellion against his father, and for hoping for the cooperation of the common people and the armed intervention of his brother-in-law, the emperor.
