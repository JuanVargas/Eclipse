unctions of Zariski can be accommodated by introducing nilpotent elements in structure rings; considering spaces of loops and arcs, constructing quotients by group actions and developing formal grounds for natural intersection theory and deformation theory lead to some of the further extensions.

Most remarkably, in late 1950s, algebraic varieties were subsumed into [[Alexander Grothendieck]]'s concept of a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]. Their local objects are affine schemes or prime spectra which are locally ringed spaces which form a category which is antiequivalent to the category of commutative unital rings, extending the duality between the category of affine algebraic varieties over a field ''k'', and the category of finitely generated reduced ''k''-algebras. The gluing is along Zariski topology; one can glue within the category of locally ringed spaces, but also, using the Yoneda embedding, within the more abstract category of presheaves of sets over the category of affine schemes. The Zariski topology in the set theoretic sense is then replaced by a Zariski topology in the sense of [[Grothendieck topology]]. Grothendieck introduced Grothendieck topologies having in mind more exotic but geometrically finer and more sensitive examples than the crude Zariski topology, namely the [[etale topology]], and the two flat Grothendieck topologies: ffpf and fpqc; nowadays some other examples became prominent including [[Nisnevich topology]].
Sheaves can be furthermore generalized to stacks in the sense of Grothendieck, usually with some additional representability conditions leading to Artin stacks and, even finer, Deligne-Mumford stacks, both often called algebraic stacks.

Sometimes other algebraic sites replace the category of affine schemes. For example, [[Nikolai Durov]] has introduced commutative algebraic monads as a generalization of local objects in a generalized algebraic geometry. Versions of a tropical geometry, of an absolute geometry over a field of one element and an algebraic analogue of Arakelov's geometry were realized in this setup.{{Better source|date=January 2011}}

Another formal generalization is possible to [[Universal algebraic geometry]] in which every [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety of algebra]] has its own algebraic geometry. The term ''variety of algebra'' should not be confused with ''algebraic variety''.

The language of schemes, stacks and generalizations has proved to be a valuable way of dealing with geometric concepts and became cornerstones of modern algebraic geometry.

Algebraic stacks can be further generalized and for many practical questions like deformation theory and intersection theory, this is often the most natural approach.
One can extend the [[Grothendieck site]] of affine schemes to a [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] site of derived affine schemes, by replacing the commutative rings with an infinity category of differential graded commutative algebras,  or of simplicial commutative rings or a similar category with an appropriate variant of a Grothendieck topology. One can also replace presheaves of sets by presheaves of simplicial sets (or of infinity groupoids). Then, in presence of an appropriate homotopic machinery one can develop a notion of derived stack as such a presheaf on the infinity category of derived affine schemes, which is satifsying certain infinite categorical version of a sheaf axiom (and to be algebraic, inductively a sequence of representability conditions). Quillen model categories, Segal categories and [[quasicategory|quasicategories]] are some of the most often used tools to formalize this yielding the '''derived algebraic geometry''', introduced by the school of [[Carlos Simpson]], including Andre Hirschowitz, [[Bertrand Toën]], Gabrielle Vezzosi, Michel Vaquié and others; and developed further by [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Bertrand Toën]], and [[Gabrielle Vezzosi]]. Another (noncommutative) version of derived algebraic geometry, using A-infinity categories has been developed from early 1990-s by [[Maxim Kontsevich]] and followers.

== History ==
===Prehistory: Before the 19th century===
Some of the roots of algebraic geometry date back to the work of the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic Greeks]] from the 5th century BC.  The [[Delian problem]], for instance, was to construct a length ''x'' so that the cube of side ''x'' contained the same volume as the rectangular box ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''b'' for given sides ''a'' and ''b''.  [[Menechmus]] (circa 350 BC) considered the problem geometrically by intersecting the pair of plane conics ''ay''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''xy''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ab''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dieudonné&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Jean |last=Dieudonné |authorlink=Jean Dieudonné |title=The historical development of algebraic geometry |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=79 |issue=8 |year=1972 |pages=827–866 |doi=10.2307/2317664 |url=http://jstor.org/stable/2317664 |publisher=The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 79, No. 8 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The later work, in the 3rd century BC, of [[Archimedes]] and [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]] studied more systematically problems on [[conic sections]],&lt;ref&gt;Kline, M. (1972) ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' (Volume 1).  Oxford University Press.  pp. 108, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; and also involved the use of coordinates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dieudonné&quot;/&gt;  The [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematicians]] were able to solve by purely algebraic means certain cubic equations, and then to interpret the results geometrically.  This was done, for instance, by [[Ibn al-Haytham]] in the 10th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, M. (1972) ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' (Volume 1).  Oxford University Press.  p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician [[Omar Khayyám]] (born 1048 A.D.) discovered the general method of solving [[cubic equation]]s by intersecting a parabola with a circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, M. (1972) ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' (Volume 1).  Oxford University Press.  pp. 193&amp;ndash;195.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these early developments in algebraic geometry dealt with questions of finding and describing the intersections of algebraic curves.

Such techniques of applying geometrical constructions to algebraic problems were also adopted by a number of [[Renaissance]] mathematicians such as [[Gerolamo Cardano]] and [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia|Niccolò Fontana &quot;Tartaglia&quot;]] on their studies of the cubic equation.  The geometrical approach to construction problems, rather than the algebraic one, was favored by most 16th and 17th century mathematicians, notably [[Blaise Pascal]] who argued against the use of algebraic and analytical methods in geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, M. (1972) ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' (Volume 1).  Oxford University Press.  p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;  The French mathematicians [[Franciscus Vieta]] and later [[René Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] revolutionized the conventional way of thinking about construction problems through the introduction of [[coordinate geometry]].  They were interested primarily in the properties of ''algebraic curves'', such as those defined by [[Diophantine equations]] (in the case of Fermat), and the algebraic reformulation of the classical Greek works on conics and cubics (in the case of Descartes).

During the same period, Blaise Pascal and [[Gérard Desargues]] approached geometry from a different perspective, developing the [[synthetic geometry|synthetic]] notions of [[projective geometry]].  Pascal and Desargues also studied curves, but from the purely geometrical point of view: the analog of the Greek ''ruler and compass construction''.  Ultimately, the [[analytic geometry]] of Descartes and Fermat won out, for it supplied the 18th century mathematicians with concrete quantitative tools needed to study physical problems using the new calculus of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].  However, by the end of the 18th century, most of the algebraic character of coordinate geometry was subsumed by the ''calculus of infinitesimals'' of [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] and [[Leonard Euler|Euler]].

===Nineteenth and early 20th century===
It took the simultaneous 19th century developments of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] and [[Abelian integral]]s in order to bring the old algebraic ideas back into the geometrical fold.  The first of these new developments was seized up by [[Edmond Laguerre]] and [[Arthur Cayley]], who attempted to ascertain the generalized metric properties of projective space.  Cayley introduced the idea of ''homogeneous polynomial forms'', and more specifically [[quadratic form]]s, on projective space.  Subsequently, [[Felix Klein]] studied projective geometry (along with other sorts of geometry) from the viewpoint that the geometry on a space is encoded in a certain class of [[transformation group|transformations]] on the space.  By the end of the 19th century, projective geometers were studying more general kinds of transformations on figures in projective space.  Rather than the projective linear transformations which were normally regarded as giving the fundamental [[Kleinian geometry]] on projective space, they concerned themselves also with the higher degree [[birational transformation]]s.  This weaker notion of congruence would later lead members of the 20th century [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]] to classify [[algebraic surface]]s up to [[birational isomorphism]].

The second early 19th century development, that of Abelian integrals, would lead [[Bernhard Riemann]] to the development of [[Riemann surface]]s. &lt;!--Continue later.  Intermediate save. --&gt;

===Twentieth century===
[[B. L. van der Waerden]], [[Oscar Zariski]], [[André Weil]] and others attempted to develop a rigorous foundation for algebraic geometry based on contemporary [[commutative algebra]], including [[valuation theory]] and the theory of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]].

In the 1950s and 1960s [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Alexander Grothendieck]] recast the foundations making use of [[sheaf theory]]. Later, from about 1960, and largely spearheaded by Grothendieck, the idea of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]] was worked out, in conjunction with a very refined apparatus of [[homological algebra|homological techniques]]. After a decade of rapid development the field stabilized in the 1970s, and new applications were made, both to [[number theory]] and to more classical geometric questions on algebraic varieties, [[singularity theory|singularities]] and [[moduli space|moduli]].

An important class of varieties, not easily understood directly from their defining equations, are the [[abelian variety|abelian varieties]], which are the projective varieties whose points form an abelian [[group (mathematics)|group]].
The prototypical examples are the [[elliptic curve]]s, which have a rich theory. They were instrumental in the proof of [[Fermat's last theorem]] and are also used in [[elliptic curve cryptography]].

While much of algebraic geometry is concerned with abstract and general statements about varieties, methods for effective computation with concretely-given polynomials have also been developed. The most important is the technique of [[Gröbner basis|Gröbner bases]] which is employed in all [[computer algebra]] systems. Based on these methods, several solvers may compute all the solutions of a [[systems of polynomial equations|system of polynomial equations]] whose associated variety has dimension zero and thus consists in a finite number of points.

The mission was in this area for only about seven months, and then was moved to San Antonio de Béxar and split into three missions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ica02&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-18th century, the San Xavier missions were located along the Colorado River, in what is now western [[Milam County, Texas|Milam County]], to facilitate exploration.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Williamson Co&quot;&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|name=Williamson County|id=WW/hcw11|retrieved=Feb 17, 2010|author=Odintz, Mark}} Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835–1836, Texans fought for independence in the [[Texas Revolution]] and won. Texas thus became its own independent country with its own president, congress and monetary system. In 1839, the Texas Congress formed a commission to seek a site for a new capital to be named for [[Stephen F. Austin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot;/&gt; [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], second president of the newly formed [[Republic of Texas]], advised the commissioners to investigate the area named Waterloo, noting the area's hills, waterways, and pleasant surroundings.&lt;ref name=pres1&gt;Patoski, Joe Nick &quot;It's Just Different Here&quot;, ''[[National Trust for Historic Preservation|Preservation]]'', July/August, 2010, page 38&lt;/ref&gt; Waterloo was selected and the name ''Austin'' was chosen as the town's new name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|name=Waterloo, Texas|id=WW/hvw13|retrieved=Feb 17, 2010}} Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; The location was seen as a convenient crossroads for trade routes between [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and [[Galveston Bay]], as well as routes between northern Mexico and the [[Red River (Texas)|Red River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Erlichman (2006), p. 61.&quot;/&gt; Austin is also the site where the southern leg of the [[Chisholm Trail]] leads to the Colorado River.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first=Don| last=Martin|work=Austin |page=31|year=2009|publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]] Chicago, IL |isbn=978-0-7385-7067-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edwin Waller]] was picked by Lamar to survey the village and draft a plan laying out the new capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot;/&gt; The original site was narrowed to {{convert|640|acres|0|abbr=on}} that fronted the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] between two creeks, Shoal Creek and Waller Creek, which was later named in his honor. The 14-block grid plan was bisected by a broad north-south thoroughfare, Congress Avenue, running up from the river to Capital Square, where the new Texas State Capitol was to be constructed. A temporary one-story capitol was erected on the corner of Colorado and 8th Streets. On August 1, 1839, the first auction of 217 out of 306 lots total was held.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Erlichman (2006), p. 61.&quot;&gt;Erlichman (2006), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The grid plan Waller designed and surveyed now forms the basis of downtown Austin.

In 1840, a series of conflicts between the Texas Rangers and the Comanches, known as the [[Council House Fight]] and the [[Battle of Plum Creek]], finally pushed the Comanches westward, mostly ending conflicts in Central Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|name=Plum Creek, Battle of|id=PP/btp4|retrieved=Feb 17, 2010}} Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Settlement in the area began to expand quickly. Travis County was established in 1840, and the surrounding counties were mostly established within the next two decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT:Travis Co&quot;/&gt;

Initially, the new capital thrived. But Lamar's political enemy, [[Sam Houston]], used two Mexican army incursions to [[San Antonio]] as an excuse to move the government. Sam Houston fought bitterly against Lamar’s decision to establish the capital in such a remote wilderness. The men and women who traveled mainly from Houston to conduct government business were intensely disappointed as well. By 1840 the population had risen to 856 of whom nearly half fled from Austin when Congress recessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Austin Community Inventory Report|url=http://www.imagineaustin.net/inventory-historic.htm|publisher=Austin City Connection|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The resident Black population listed in January of this same year was 176.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Austin Treasures: First Year Firsts: 1839.”|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/library/ahc/begin/firsts.htm|publisher=Austin City Connections|accessdate=April 18, 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The fear of Austin’s proximity to the Indians and Mexico, which still considered Texas a part of their land, created an immense motive for Sam Houston, the first and third President of the Republic of Texas, to relocate the capital once again in 1841. Upon threats of Mexican troops in Texas, Houston raided the Land Office to transfer all official documents to Houston for safe keeping in what was later known as the Archive War, but the people of Austin would not allow this unaccompanied decision to be executed.  The documents stayed, but the capital would temporarily move from Austin to Houston to Washington-on-the-Brazos. Without the governmental body, Austin’s population declined to an alarming low of only a few hundred people throughout the early 1840s. The voting by the fourth President of the Republic, Anson Jones, and Congress, who reconvened in Austin in 1845, settled the issue to keep Austin the seat of government as well as annex the Republic of Texas into the United States. 

In 1860, 38% of Travis County residents were slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Census Office, Department of the Interior|title=Map Showing the Distribution of the Slave Population of the Southern States of the United States|url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/opinion/FULLFRAMEmap.pdf|accessdate=13 December 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, with the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], voters in Austin and other Central Texas communities voted against secession.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Bastrop&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot;/&gt; However, as the war progressed and fears of attack by Union forces increased, Austin contributed hundreds of men to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces. The African American population of Austin swelled dramatically after the enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in Texas by [[Union Army|Union]] General [[Gordon Granger]] at Galveston in an event commemorated as [[Juneteenth]]. Black communities such as Wheatville, Pleasant Hill, and Clarksville were established around Austin by these newcomers.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot;&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|id=AA/hda3|name=Austin, Texas|author=Humphrey, David C.|retrieved=Feb 17, 2010}} Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; The postwar period saw dramatic population and economic growth.

In September 1881, Austin public schools held their first classes. The same year, Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute (now part of [[Huston-Tillotson University]]) opened its doors. The [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] held its first classes in 1883, although classes had been held in the original wooden state Capitol for four years before.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Don (2009).

During the 1880s, Austin gained new prominence as the [[Texas State Capitol|state capitol building]] was completed in 1888, and claimed as the seventh largest building in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot;/&gt; In the late 19th century, Austin expanded its city limits to more than three times its former area, and the first granite dam was built on the Colorado River to power a new street car line and the new &quot;moon towers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot;/&gt; Unfortunately the first dam washed away in a flood on April 6, 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Don (2009).

[[Arcadia Publishing]], Chicago, IL, ISBN 978-0-7385-7067-9&lt;/ref&gt; that formed Lake McDonald (now called Lake Austin) and which has withstood all floods since. In addition, the much larger Mansfield Dam was built by the LCRA upstream of Austin to form the flood-control lake, Lake Travis.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Don (2009). ''Austin'', p. 112. [[Arcadia Publishing]], Chicago, IL, ISBN 978-0-7385-7067-9&lt;/ref&gt;   In the early 20th century, the [[Texas Oil Boom]] took hold, creating tremendous economic opportunities in Southeast Texas and North Texas. The growth generated by this boom largely passed by Austin at first, with the city slipping from fourth largest to 10th largest in Texas between 1880 and 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot;/&gt;

Beginning in the 1920s and 1930s, Austin launched a series of civic development and beautification projects that created much of the city's infrastructure and parks. In addition, the state legislature established the [[Lower Colorado River Authority]] that, along with the City of Austin, created the system of dams along the Colorado River to form the Highland Lakes. These projects were enabled in large part because Austin received more [[Depression era]] relief funds than any other Texas city.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot;/&gt;

After the mid-20th century, Austin became established as one of Texas' major metropolitan centers. In the late 20th century, Austin emerged as an important high tech center for semiconductors and software. The University of Texas emerged as a major university.&lt;ref name=&quot;Later 1900s&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Austin in Texas|url=http://www.writeonaustin.org/ |publisher=Writeonaustin.com |accessdate=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970s also saw Austin's emergence in the national music scene, with artists such as [[Willie Nelson]] and venues such as the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]]. The long-running television program [[Austin City Limits]] and the annual [[South by Southwest]] musical festival helped to solidify the city's place in the music industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;austin history&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=The History of Austin |work=Austin City Connection |publisher=City of Austin |url=http://www.cityofaustin.org/library/ahc/briefhistory.htm |accessdate=December 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin is situated on the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]], with three man-made (artificial) lakes within the city limits: [[Lady Bird Lake]], [[Lake Austin]] (both created by dams along the Colorado River), and [[Lake Walter E. Long]] that is partly used for cooling water for the Decker Power Plant. Additionally, the foot of [[Lake Travis]], including [[Mansfield Dam]], is located within the city's limits.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|id=AA/hda3|name=Austin, Texas|author=Humphrey, David C.|retrieved=Feb 4, 2010}} Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Bird Lake, Lake Austin, and Lake Travis are each on the Colorado River.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot;/&gt; As a result of its straddling the [[Balcones Fault]], the eastern part of the city is flat, with heavy clay and loam soils, whereas, the western part and western suburbs consist of rolling hills on the edge of the [[Texas Hill Country]].&lt;ref&gt;Baird (2009), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the hills to the west are primarily [[limestone]] rock with a thin covering of topsoil, portions of the city are frequently subjected to flash floods from the runoff caused by thunderstorms.&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|id=HH/ryh2.html|name=Hill Country|retrieved=November 7, 2009|author=[[Terry G.

Austin is located at the intersection of four major ecological regions, and is consequently a temperate-to-hot green oasis with a highly variable climate having some characteristics of the desert, the tropics, and a wetter climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Birding in South Texas|publisher=Fodor's|accessdate=Feb 7, 2010}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/images/ewx/aus/ausclisum.pdf |title=Austin Climate Summary |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=Feb 7, 2010}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visiting-austin-texas.com/austin-texas-weather.html |title=Austin Texas Weather Patterns |publisher=Visiting Austin Texas |accessdate=Feb 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area is very diverse ecologically and biologically, and is home to a variety of animals and plants.&lt;ref&gt;Vines (1984), p. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the area is home to many types of wildflowers that blossom throughout the year but especially in the spring, including the popular bluebonnets, some planted in an effort by [[Lady Bird Johnson|&quot;Lady Bird&quot; Johnson]], wife of [[Lyndon B.

A popular point of prominence in Austin is [[Mount Bonnell]]. At about {{convert|780|ft|m|0}} above sea level, it is a natural limestone formation overlooking [[Lake Austin]] on the Colorado River, with an observation deck about {{convert|200|ft|m|0}} below its summit. From the observation deck, many homes are visible.

The soils of Austin range from shallow, gravelly clay loams over limestone in the western outskirts to deep, fine sandy loams, silty clay loams, silty clays or clays in the city's eastern part. Some of the clays have pronounced shrink-swell properties and are difficult to work under most moisture conditions. Many of Austin's soils, especially the clay-rich types, are slightly to moderately alkaline and have free [[calcium carbonate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/fowler/epveg/epgeol.htm |title=Geology (Edward's Plateau Ecology) |author=Nora Fowler, School of Biological Sciences |publisher=University of Texas at Austin |accessdate=Feb 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|List of mayors of Austin, Texas}}
Austin is administered by a [[city council]] of seven members, each of them elected at large. The council is composed of six council members, and by an elected [[mayor]], accompanied by a hired [[city manager]] under the [[council-manager government|manager-council]] system of municipal governance. Council and mayoral elections are non-partisan, with a runoff in case there is no majority winner. Austin remains an anomaly among large Texas cities in that council members are elected on an at-large basis by all voters, as opposed to elections by districts.

Austin formerly operated its city hall at 128 West 8th Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swf.usace.army.mil/pubdata/notices/3oakpdf/PPN3RV1.pdf |title=Availability of FEIS |publisher=Fort Worth District [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] |accessdate=December 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antoine Predock and Cotera Kolar Negrete &amp; Reed Architects designed a new city hall building, which was intended to reflect what ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' referred to as a &quot;crazy-quilt vitality, that embraces everything from country music to environmental protests and high-tech swagger.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hunterdouglascontract.com/referenceprojects/article.jsp?pId=8a438349014db9420102a25eeb960621 |title=Austin City Hall |publisher=Hunter Douglas Contract |accessdate=December 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new city hall, built from recycled materials, has solar panels in its garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Witt, Howard |title=In heart of Texas, drumbeat for green |work=Chicago Tribune |date=September 28, 2007 |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/services/newspaper/printedition/friday/chi-austin_green_wittsep28,0,2964379.story 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city hall, at 301 West Second Street, opened in November 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/cityhall/ |title=Austin City Hall |publisher=City of Austin |accessdate=December 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{As of|2009|alt=current}} mayor of Austin is [[Lee Leffingwell]].

Law enforcement in Austin is provided by the [[Austin Police Department]], except for state government buildings, which are patrolled by the [[Texas Department of Public Safety]]. Austin was ranked the fifth-safest city in part because there are fewer than five murders per 100,000 people annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.morganquitno.com/cit07pop.htm#25 |title=City Crime Rankings by Population Group |publisher=Morgan Quitno Press |year=2006 |accessdate=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cqpress.com/docs/met05r.pdf|title=Rank Order – Metro Area |page=2 |publisher=Morgan Quitno Press |format=PDF |year=2006 |accessdate=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
The controversy that dominated Austin politics during the 1990s was the conflict between [[environmentalist]]s and advocates of urban growth. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}The city council has in the past tried to mitigate the controversy by advocating [[smart growth]], but growth and environmental protection are still the most divisive issues in city politics.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Austin is known as a center for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] politics in a generally [[conservatism|conservative]] state, so much so that the city is sometimes sarcastically referred to as the &quot;People's Republic of Austin&quot; by residents of other parts of the state and by conservatives in the Texas Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE3D71338F931A25752C1A9669C8B63 |title=COUNTING THE VOTE: THE SCENE; In Austin, the Jockeying, Along With the Partying, Is on Hold |work=The New York Times |last=Verhovek |first=Sam Howe |date=November 12, 2000 |accessdate=January 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/17/america/Texas-Dem-Rebound.php |title=Texas Democrats look to Obama to help them rebound |last=Welsh-Huggins |first=Andrew |date=July 17, 2008 |accessdate=January 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the major party realignment that began in the 1970s, central Austin became a stronghold of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], while the suburbs tend to vote [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. One consequence of this is that in the most recent redistricting plan, formulated by former U.S. Rep. [[Tom DeLay]] and enacted by the Republican-majority legislature, the central city has been split among multiple sprawling districts. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan [[gerrymandering]], and the plan was challenged in court on this basis by Democratic and minority activists; of note, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court in a 7–2 decision upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This later affected Austin's districting, as U.S. Rep. [[Lloyd Doggett]]'s district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced [[minority influence]] in the southwest district and so was redrawn so that it now takes in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Greg |last=Stohr |title=Republican Texas Redistricting Upheld by Top Court |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=ah1suoNgrH7g&amp;refer=us |work=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |date=June 28, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the city is a blend of downtown liberalism and suburban conservatism but leans to the political left as a whole. In 2003, the city adopted a resolution against the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] that reaffirmed constitutionally guaranteed rights. In the 2004 presidential election, Senator [[John Kerry]] won a substantial majority of the votes in Travis County.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/vote2004/countymap.htm |title=Latest vote, county by county |date=November 16, 2004 |work=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of Austin's six state legislative districts, three are strongly Democratic and three are swing districts all of which are held by Democrats. However, two of its three congressional districts (the [[Texas's 10th congressional district|10th]] and the [[Texas's 21st congressional district|21st]]) are presently held by Republicans, with only the [[Texas's 25th congressional district|25th]] held by a Democrat. This is largely due to the 2003 redistricting, which left downtown Austin without an exclusive congressional seat of its own. Travis County was also the only county in Texas to reject Texas Constitutional Amendment Proposition 2 that effectively outlawed gay marriage and status equal or similar to it and did so by a wide margin (40% for, 60% against).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.co.travis.tx.us/county_clerk/election/20051108/enight_results.pdf |title=November 8, 2005 Joint Special Elections |publisher=[[Travis County, Texas]] |date=November 8, 2005 |format=PDF |accessdate=October 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=311361 |title=Austin – the Only Gay Place |last=Nichols |first=Lee |work=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |date=November 18, 2005 |accessdate=October 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlo/79R/billtext/HJ00006F.HTM |title=79(R) HJR 6 – Enrolled version – Bill Text |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051125072148/http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlo/79R/billtext/HJ00006F.HTM |archivedate=November 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Austin is generally considered a gay-friendly city, Texas state laws disadvantage gays specifically.

Austin is also an active area for the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]. Although the Libertarians remain a third party, they occasionally garner substantial votes,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and one of the past Libertarian presidential candidates, [[Michael Badnarik]], comes from Austin.

Two of the candidates for president in the 2004 race call Austin home. Michael Badnarik, mentioned above as the Libertarian Party candidate, and [[David Cobb]] of the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] both have lived in Austin. During the run up to the election in November, a presidential debate was held at the [[University of Texas]] student union involving the two minor party candidates. While the [[Commission on Presidential Debates]] only invites Democrats and Republicans to participate in televised debates, the debate at UT was open to all presidential candidates. Austin also hosted one of the last presidential debates between [[Barack Obama]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] during their heated race for the Democratic nomination in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/02/21/debate.main/index.html |title=Obama, Clinton Agree to Disagree |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |work=CNN Politics.com |publisher=CNN | date=February 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental movement===
The distinguishing political movement of Austin politics has been that of the environmental movement, which spawned the parallel neighborhood movement, then the more recent conservationist movement (as typified by the Hill Country Conservancy),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Conservancy shifts into high gear; Efforts steer land away from development |first=Sara |last=Zaragosa |newspaper=Austin Business Journal |date=August 28, 2009 |url=http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2009/08/31/story4.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually the current on-going debate about &quot;sense of place&quot; and preserving the Austin quality of life. Much of the so-called environmental movement has matured into a debate on issues related to saving and creating an Austin &quot;sense of place.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental City |last=Swearingen, Jr. |first=William | middle&quot; Scott |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin, Texas |isbn=978-0-292-72181-4 |page= |pages=18, 19 |url=http://www.utexaspress.com |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin is considered to be a major center for [[high tech]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CityDataEconomy&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-South/Austin-Economy.html |title=Austin: Economy |work=City-Data.com |accessdate=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of graduates each year from the engineering and computer science programs at [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]] provide a steady source of employees that help to fuel Austin's technology and defense industry sectors. The metro Austin area has much lower housing costs than [[Silicon Valley]], but much higher housing costs than many parts of rural Texas. As a result of the high concentration of high-tech companies in the region, Austin was strongly affected by the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com boom]] in the late 1990s and subsequent bust.&lt;ref name=&quot;CityDataEconomy&quot;/&gt; Austin's largest employers include the [[Austin Independent School District]], the City of Austin, [[Dell]], the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Federal Government]], [[Freescale Semiconductor]] (spun off from [[Motorola]] in 2004), [[IBM]], St. David's Healthcare Partnership, Seton Family of Hospitals, the [[Texas|State of Texas]], [[Texas State University–San Marcos]], and [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CityDataEconomy&quot;/&gt;

The concentration of high-tech companies has led the former [[American Airlines]] flight between Austin and [[San Jose, California]] to be dubbed the &quot;nerd bird.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Nerd-Bird-Grounded-jw.html |title=&quot;Nerd bird&quot; grounded |publisher=NBC Universal, Inc. |accessdate=Feb 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin is also emerging as a hub for [[pharmaceutical]] and [[biotechnology]] companies. About 85 companies from this industry are based in Austin.&lt;ref name=&quot;CityDataEconomy&quot;/&gt; The city was ranked by the Milken Institute as the #12 biotech and life science center in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.milkeninstitute.org/publications/publications.taf?function=detail&amp;ID=312&amp;cat=ResRep |title=America's Biotech and Life Science Clusters: San Diego's Position and Economic Contributions |last=DeVol |first=Ross |coauthors=Wong, Perry; Ki, Junghoon; Bedroussian, Armen; Koepp Rob |publisher=Milken Institute |accessdate=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buildings that make up most of Austin's skyline are modest in height and somewhat spread out. The latter characteristic is partly due to a restriction that preserves the view of the [[Texas State Capitol]] building from various locations around Austin (known as the Capitol View Corridor).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityofaustin.org/downtown/downloads/CVC_Report_Final.pdf |title=Downtown Development and Capitol View Corridors |author=Downtown Commission |month=June |year=2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many new highrise towers have been constructed and the downtown area is looking more modern and dense.

By 2015, the [[Frost Bank Tower]] could be the only skyscraper built before 2005 to remain in the ten tallest buildings in the city.

At night, parts of Austin are lighted by &quot;artificial moonlight&quot; from [[moonlight tower|Moonlight Towers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityofaustin.org/library/ahc/faq4.htm |title=Austin History Center a division of the Austin Public Library: Frequently Asked Questions about Austin, Answer 4|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; built to illuminate the central part of the city. The {{convert|165|ft|m|sing=on}} moonlight towers were built in the late 19th century and are now recognized as historic landmarks. Only 17 of the 31 original innovative towers remain standing in Austin, and none remain in any of the other cities where they were installed. The towers are featured in the 1993 film ''[[Dazed and Confused]]''.

===Downtown===

The skyline has drastically changed in recent years, and the residential real estate market has remained relatively strong.
Downtown growth has been aided by the presence of a popular live music and nightlife scene, museums, restaurants, and [[Lady Bird Lake]], considered one of the city's best recreational spots. The 2nd Street District consists of several new residential projects, restaurants, coffee shops, record stores, upscale boutiques and museums, and the Austin City Hall. Under construction across 2nd Street from Austin City Hall will be the newly re-created TV set for the long-running PBS program [[Austin City Limits]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2010/02/22/daily46.html|title=New Austin City Limits home taking shape|work=[[Austin Business Journal]]|date=February 25, 2010|first=Sandra|last=Zaragoza}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will be housed beneath the new {{convert|478|ft|m|0}} [[Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide|W Hotel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2009/09/07/daily19.html|title=New downtown hotel planned

==Arts and culture==
&quot;[[Keep Austin Weird]]&quot; has become a local [[motto]] in recent years, featured on bumper stickers and t-shirts. This motto has not only been used in promoting Austin's eccentricity and diversity, but is also meant to bolster support of local independent businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;weird&quot;/&gt; According to the 2010 book, [[''Weird City'']], the phrase was begun by a local Austin Community College librarian, Red Wassenich, and his wife, Karen Pavelka, who were concerned about Austin's &quot;rapid descent into commercialism and over-development.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Long, J. (2010). [[''Weird City''|''Weird City: Sense of Place and Creative Resistance in Austin, Texas'']].

===Highways===
{{See also|List of highways in Travis County, Texas}}
[[File:Pennybacker Bridge View.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pennybacker Bridge]] is the signature element of  [[Texas Loop 360|Loop 360]] in the [[Texas Hill Country]].]]
Central Austin is essentially bracketed by two major North/South thoroughfares: [[Interstate 35 in Texas|Interstate 35]] to the east and the [[State Highway Loop 1 (Texas)|Mopac Expressway (Loop 1)]] to the west. [[U.S. Highway 183 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 183]] runs from northwest to southeast, and [[State Highway 71 (Texas)|State Highway 71]] crosses the southern part of the city from east to west, completing a rough &quot;box&quot; around the central and north-central city. Austin is the largest city in the United States to be served by only one Interstate Highway.

[[U.S. Highway 290 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 290]] enters Austin from the east and merges into I-35. Its highway designation continues south on I-35 and then becomes part of Highway 71, continuing on to the west. Highway 290 becomes its own road again southwest of the city, when it splits from Highway 71 in a busy interchange in Oak Hill known as &quot;The Y.&quot; Highway 71 continues as far west as [[Brady, Texas]], and Highway 290 continues west to intersect [[Interstate 10 in Texas|Interstate 10]] near Junction. Interstate 35 continues south through [[San Antonio]], and continues to its culmination at [[Laredo, Texas]], which is on the Texas-Mexico border. Interstate 35 is the highway link to the Dallas-Ft. Worth metroplex in northern Texas. There are two links to Houston, Texas (Highway 290 and State Highway 71/Interstate 10). Highway 183 leads northwest of Austin and is a route with other major highways to such cities as Abilene, San Angelo, Lubbock, Amarillo, Albuquerque and Denver.

In the mid-1980s, Austin completed construction on [[State Highway Loop 360 (Texas)|Loop 360]], a scenic highway that curves through the hill country from near the 71/Mopac interchange in the south to near the 183/Mopac interchange in the north. The iconic [[Pennybacker Bridge]], also known as the &quot;360 Bridge&quot;, crosses [[Lake Austin]] to connect north and south Loop 360.

===Tollways===
[[File:Texas45.jpg|thumb|right|Interchange of [[Interstate 35 in Texas|Interstate 35]] and [[State Highway 45 (Texas)|State Highway 45]].]]
In November 2006, Austin opened the first segments of its first-ever tollway system: [[State Highway 130 (Texas)|State Highway 130]] runs from just south of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport to Interstate 35 just north of [[Georgetown, Texas|Georgetown]]. Highway 130 connects with Highway 45 in Pflugerville, Texas. The project, when completed, will end at [[Interstate 10]] just east of [[Seguin, Texas|Seguin]], about {{convert|30|mi|km}} east-northeast of [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]].

[[State Highway 45 (Texas)|State Highway 45]] runs east-west from just west of Highway 183 in [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]] to 130 inside [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] (just east of Round Rock). The project also included a tolled extension to Mopac that allows direct access to I-35. A new southeast leg of Highway 45 has recently been completed, connecting US 183 and the current south end of TX-130 to I-35 at the [[FM 1327]]/Creedmoor exit near the south end of Austin and close to the town of [[Buda, Texas|Buda's]] northernmost interchange. The 183A Toll Road opened March 2007, providing a tolled alternative to 183 through the cities of [[Leander, Texas|Leander]] and [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]].
Despite the overwhelming initial opposition to the toll road concept when it was first announced, all three toll roads have improved mobility in and around the Austin area and are significantly exceeding their revenue projections.&lt;ref name='Toll Road Revenue'&gt;{{Cite news| first = Ben | last = Wear | title = Positive signs for financial future of Texas 130; | date = 2009-09-28 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&amp;p_theme=aasb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_hidethis=no&amp;p_field_label-0=Author&amp;p_text_label-0=Ben%20Wear&amp;p_field_label-1=title&amp;p_bool_label-1=AND&amp;s_dispstring=Toll%20revenue%20exceed%20AND%20byline(Ben%20Wear)%20AND%20date(09/01/2009%20to%2001/01/2010)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=09/01/2009%20to%2001/01/2010)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(Toll%20revenue%20exceed)&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no | work = Austin American-Statesman | pages = B-1 | accessdate = 2010-08-07 | quote = Report on the tollway...has been making more money than projected.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airports===
Austin's airport is [[Austin-Bergstrom International Airport]] (ABIA) ([[List of airports by IATA code: A#AU|IATA code]] '''AUS'''), located {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} southeast of the city. The airport is on the site of the former [[Bergstrom Air Force Base]], which was closed in 1993 as part of the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] process. Previously, [[Robert Mueller Municipal Airport]] was the commercial airport of Austin.

===Intercity bus service===
[[Greyhound Lines]] operates the Austin Station at 916 East Koenig Lane, just east of Airport Boulevard and adjacent to [[Highland Mall]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.greyhound.com/home/TicketCenter/en/terminal.asp?city=680174 Austin, Texas].&quot; ''[[Greyhound Lines]]''. Retrieved on April 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Turimex Internacional operates bus service from Austin to Nuevo Laredo and on to many destinations in Mexico. The Turimex station is located at 5012 East 7th Street, near Shady Lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gruposenda.com |title=Grupo Senda – Turimex Internacional |publisher=Grupo Senda |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public transportation===
{{See also|Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority}}
[[File:Austin Metrorail.jpg|thumb|Austin Metrorail train at Downtown Station.]]

Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Capital Metro) provides public transportation to the city, primarily by bus. Capital Metro is planning to change some routes to &quot;Rapid Lines&quot;. The lines will feature {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} long, train-like high-tech buses. This addition is going to be implemented to help reduce congestion. Capital Metro opened a {{convert|32|mi|km|adj=on}} [[regional rail|commuter rail]] system known as [[Capital MetroRail]] on March 22, 2010.&lt;ref name=CapMetroRail&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://allsystemsgo.capmetro.org/capital-metrorail-qa.shtml |title=All Systems Go Long-Range Transit Plan |publisher=Capital Metro |accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was built on existing freight rail lines and will serve downtown Austin, East Austin, North Central Austin, Northwest Austin, and Leander in its first phase. Future expansion could include a line to Manor and another to Round Rock. [[Capital Metro]] is also looking into a circulator system of streetcars to connect most of Downtown, the University of Texas, and the {{convert|700|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[Mueller Community|Mueller Airport Redevelopment]]. The streetcar system would help connect the new rail line to key destinations in Central Austin. An [[Amtrak]] ''[[Texas Eagle]]'' [[Austin (Amtrak station)|station]] is located west of downtown. Segments of the Amtrak route between Austin and San Antonio are under evaluation for a future passenger rail corridor as an alternative to the traffic congestion of Interstate 35. Austin is known as the most bike-friendly city in Texas and has a Silver-level rating from the [[League of American Bicyclists]]. Austin is also home to [[Car2Go]], a [[carsharing]] program. Austin was chosen as the first city in the western hemisphere to host this company's business, which is based in Germany.

===Pedicabs===
Austin has a vibrant and large pedicab community of bicycle taxis that operate downtown during the evening hours and daytime during events.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''argument from morality''' is one of many [[arguments for the existence of God]]. It comes in different forms, all aiming to support the claim that [[God]] exists with observations about [[morality]].  Its counterpoint is generally the [[Problem of evil]].

==General form==
All forms of the moral argument begin with the premise of moral normativity, that is, that well-functioning human beings are typically aware of actions as being right and wrong. Furthermore, this awareness binds them to certain obligations, regardless of their personal goals and ends. In this sense, moral qualities have the appearance of objectivity: many times, when someone says &quot;I ought to do ''a''&quot; they do not mean the same as &quot;I would like to do ''a''&quot;, or even prudentially, &quot;I ought to do ''a'' in order to produce so-and-so&quot;. Another aspect of this is that a proposition such as &quot;torturing babies for fun is wrong&quot; is generally regarded as a statement of fact, a position known as [[moral realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Richard (1988). &quot;How to Be a Moral Realist,&quot; in ''Essays on Moral Realism'', edited by G. Sayre-McCord, pp. 181-228.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its most general form, the moral argument is that:

# Some aspect of Morality (e.g., its objective force) is observed. ([[Moral realism]])
# Belief in [[God]] provides a better explanation of this feature than various alternatives.
# Therefore, to the extent that (1) is accepted, belief in God is preferable to these alternatives

==Variations==
What follows are some of the more common variations of the moral argument.

===Moral sanctions===
# Moral norms exist and have authority beyond the socially mediated. It is, for example, perfectly coherent for someone like [[William Wilberforce]] to say &quot;slavery may be approved of by society, but it is morally wrong&quot;.
# If they truly have such authority, there should be a rational argument why human beings should act in accordance with moral norms, over and above the reaction of society.
# The existence of God, who is wholly just, observes everything relevant about human actions and can attach appropriate long-term sanctions to behavior provides such a rational argument, better than alternatives.
# Therefore, to the extent that (1), (2) and (3) are accepted, belief in God is more reasonable than alternative [[worldview]]s that do not offer such explanations.

One may ask why the required recognition and upholding of moral norms must be carried out by divine intelligence, as opposed to human intelligence. [[Alfred Edward Taylor]] explains that the moral law holds at all times and everywhere, whereas the human mind is limited in its comprehension and scope. Only a sovereign God could properly detect infringements of the moral law and apply sanctions. In his ''[[A Letter Concerning Toleration|Letter concerning Toleration]]'', [[John Locke]] contends that one of the few religious stances that the commonwealth cannot tolerate is [[atheism]]; atheists, Locke says, have no motive to act upon their promises and oaths when doing so is against their self-interest.

====Criticism====
The argument is formally valid but each of (1), (2) and (3) may be disputed.

# Some thinkers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] in [[Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]], suggest that moral norms are entirely socially mediated, through, for example, a [[social contract]]. Indeed, there is a great deal of evidence that social organization strategies [[Evolution of morality|have evolved in various species]].
# Others, such as [[Plato]]'s character [[Socrates]]&lt;ref&gt;''Euthydemus''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics''&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that true happiness lies in following moral norms, irrespective of possible divine sanctions.

===Transcendentality of morality===

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:C.s.lewis3.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[C. S. Lewis]] used a transcendental argument from morality in his book ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' that he referred to as the &quot;Moral Law&quot;.]] --&gt;

# Moral facts exist.
# Moral facts are [[transcendental idealism|transcendental]] in nature.
# The best explanation of there being transcendental moral facts is provided by theism.
# Therefore the existence of moral facts provides good grounds for thinking theism is true.

Here, a ''transcendental'' fact is one that cannot be stated entirely in the language of the natural sciences, and that is true irrespective of human opinion. Theism provides the most intelligible explanation for such moral facts via the notion that rightness is one and the same property as the property of being commanded by God (wrongness consists in being forbidden by God). 

In order for this argument to work, it should be shown that a non-theistic worldview cannot adequately account for transcendental normative facts.

====Criticism====
[[Image:FWNietzscheSiebe.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] presented examples of how he believed morality could develop without reference or need of God.]]
Critics suggest that this argument appeals to a [[divine command theory]] of ethics. Objections to divine command theories of ethics are numerous, most stemming from forms of the [[Euthyphro dilemma]]. Is an action good because God commanded it, or did God command it because it is good? The first horn would imply that what is good is arbitrary; God decides what is right and wrong in the same way that a government decides which side of the street cars should drive on.  The second horn could imply that God made his commands in accordance with transcendental facts that exist apart from God — exactly the types of facts that the theist is asking the non-theist to provide an account for. The argument is thus turned over on its head: the theist must account for the existence of these transcendental facts without invoking God. The non-theist can thus recognize the transcendentality of moral facts and yet still reject premise (3) on the basis that a theistic hypothesis still leaves transcendental moral facts unexplained. 

Proponents of the argument maintain that the Euthyphro dilemma can be adequately resolved. [[Thomas Aquinas]], for example, explains that God indeed commands something because it is good, but the reason it is good is that &quot;good is an essential part of God's nature&quot;. In other words, the definition of good becomes &quot;that which is in God's nature&quot;.

However, critics respond that Aquinas' solution merely pushes the problem up one level, giving rise to a similar dilemma over what dictates God's nature. If God dictates his own nature (and therefore which things are good), morality again becomes arbitrary. If God can't control his own nature, then morality is again subject to some force external to God.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] suggests elaborate explanations of how initially amoral social practices became artificially colored with moral significance.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Some thinkers like [[Richard Dawkins]] suggest that similar explanations of the phenomenon of morality are given through fields like [[Evolution]]ary dynamics - for example, research into the [[Evolution of morality]]. In fact, the [[Science of morality]] (based on the philosophy of [[Ethical naturalism]]) attempts to define right and wrong in empirical terms that allow for objective answers to be sought.

===Moral order (Kant)===

# The ''[[summum bonum]]'' (Highest Good) is where moral virtue and happiness coincide. 
# We are rationally obliged to attain the ''summum bonum''. 
# What we are obliged to attain, it must be possible for us to attain.
# If there is no god or afterlife, it is not possible to attain the ''summum bonum''. 
# God (or the afterlife) must exist. 

[[Image:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Immanuel Kant]] developed his own version of the argument from morality.]]

Premises (1) and (2) reflect [[Immanuel Kant]]'s belief that behaving morally should lead to happiness. Premise (3) tells us that &quot;ought implies can&quot;. It cannot be true that we ought to seek an end if there is no chance of our attaining it. Premise (4) points to the fact that the world as it appears to us is governed by morally blind causes. These causes give no hope whatsoever that pursuit of moral virtue will lead to happiness. They do not even give hope that we can become morally virtuous. [[Agency (philosophy)|Agency]] is beset by weaknesses that make the attainment of virtue — in the absence of external aid — seem impossible. The being postulated in (5) has omniscience and omnipotence combined with perfect goodness. Thus it will ensure that the pursuit of a virtuous state is possible through external aid (as in grace) and will promise an immortality where the moral journey can be completed. It will also ensure that in the long run happiness will result from virtue. Its existence would mean that there is a perfect moral causality at work in the world.

====Criticism====

Kant himself asserts that if the ''summum bonum'' cannot be attained, then the moral law that bids us to seek it &quot;must be fantastic and directed to imaginary ends and must therefore in itself be false&quot;. Critics {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} point out a certain type of circularity: Kant's argument presupposes that both the pursuit of moral virtue and the pursuit of happiness must be rational enterprises; however, this is precisely the sort of thing that may not be true in a non-theistic universe. Kant's conception of God arises as an attempt to harmonize these two conflicting goals, but critics assert that practical reason is not committed to the pursuit of two ends that apparently conflict.

=== Deductive form ===
[[William Lane Craig]] put it thus in a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xNsR_tTF8I speech]:
# Premise: If God does not exist, then objective moral values do not exist.
# Premise: Objective values do exist.
# Conclusion: Therefore, God exists.

This form takes [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s position expressed in [[The Brothers Karamazov]] that, &quot;If there is no God, everything is permissible.&quot; as its first premise. Notably, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] made an [[Inverse_(logic)|inverse]] form of this argument, taking the non-existence of God as a premise and logically deducing the non-existence of objective values.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Auschwitz''' ({{lang-de|Konzentrationslager Auschwitz}} {{IPA-de|ˈaʊʃvɪts||De-Konzentrationslager_Auschwitz.ogg}}) or '''Auschwitz Birkenau German Nazi Concentration and Extermination Camp''' (1940–1945),&lt;ref name=&quot;unesco&quot;&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/31  Auschwitz Birkenau, German Nazi Concentration and Extermination Camp (1940-1945).] [[UNESCO]] World Heritage List.&lt;/ref&gt; was a network of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration]] and [[extermination camp]]s built and operated by the [[Third Reich]] in [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]]. It was the largest of the German concentration camps, consisting of Auschwitz I (the ''Stammlager'' or base camp); Auschwitz II–Birkenau (the ''Vernichtungslager'' or [[extermination camp]]); [[Monowitz concentration camp|Auschwitz III–Monowitz]], also known as Buna–Monowitz (a labor camp); and 45 satellite camps.&lt;ref&gt;Krakowski 1994, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Auschwitz had for a long time been a German name for [[Oświęcim]], the town by and around which the camps were located; the name &quot;Auschwitz&quot; was made the official name again by the Germans after they [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded Poland]] in September 1939. Birkenau, the German translation of ''[[Brzezinka]]'' (birch tree), refers to a small Polish village nearby that was mostly destroyed by the Germans to make way for the camp.

Auschwitz II–Birkenau was designated by the [[Reichsführer-SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler]], Germany's Minister of the Interior, as the place of the &quot;[[Final Solution|final solution of the Jewish question in Europe]]&quot;. From spring 1942 until the fall of 1944, transport trains delivered [[Jew]]s to the camp's gas chambers from all over [[Occupied Europe|Nazi-occupied Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Gutman 1992, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The camp's first commandant, [[Rudolf Höss]], testified after the war at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] that up to three million people had died there (2.5 million gassed, and 500,000 from disease and starvation),&lt;ref&gt;Trials of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal, Nuremberg 14 November 1945 - 1 October 1946, Volume 1, Page 251&lt;/ref&gt; a figure since revised to 1.1 million, around 90 percent of them Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;auschwitz.org1&quot;&gt;[http://en.auschwitz.org.pl/h/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=29&amp;Itemid=32&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=6  Dr. Franciszek Piper, &quot;Auschwitz and Shoah. The number of victims.&quot;] [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piper 1994, pp. 68-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Others deported to Auschwitz included 150,000 [[Poles]], 23,000 [[Roma (Romani subgroup)|Roma]] and [[Sinti]], 15,000 [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Soviet prisoners of war]], and tens of thousands of people of diverse nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;Swiebocka, Teresa.

Retrieved December 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Those not killed in the gas chambers died of starvation, forced labor, lack of disease control, individual executions, and medical experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Piper 1994, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, 1945, Auschwitz was liberated by Soviet troops, a day commemorated around the world as [[International Holocaust Remembrance Day]]. In 1947, Poland founded a museum on the site of Auschwitz I and II, which by 1994 had seen 22 million visitors—700,000 annually—pass through the iron gates crowned with the infamous motto, ''[[Arbeit macht frei]]'' (&quot;work makes you free&quot;).

==Camps==
===Main camps===
[[File:Auschwitz 1944.jpg|thumb|Surveillance photo showing location of three main camps]]
[[File:Map auschwitz deportation 4499-Cut.jpg|thumb|left|Map showing the originating locations in Europe for deportations to Auschwitz concentration camp]] 
The Auschwitz complex of camps encompassed a large industrial area rich in natural resources. There were 48 camps in all. The three main camps were Auschwitz I, Auschwitz II-Birkenau, and a work camp called Auschwitz III-Monowitz, or the Buna. Auschwitz I served as the administrative center, and was the site of the deaths of roughly 70,000 people, mostly ethnic [[Poles]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[prisoners of war]]. Auschwitz II was an [[extermination camp]] or ''Vernichtungslager'', the site of the deaths of at least 960,000 Jews, 75,000 Poles, and some 19,000 [[Romani people|Roma]]. Auschwitz III-Monowitz served as a labor camp for the Buna-Werke factory of the [[IG Farben]] concern. The [[SS-Totenkopfverbände]] (SS-TV) was the SS organization responsible for administering the Nazi concentration camps for the Third Reich. The SS-TV was an independent unit within the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] with its own ranks and command structure.
[[Obersturmbannführer]] [[Rudolf Höss]] was overall commandant of the Auschwitz complex from May 1940–November 1943; Obersturmbannführer [[Arthur Liebehenschel]] from November 1943–May 1944; and [[Sturmbannführer]] [[Richard Baer]] from May 1944–January 1945.

[[Yisrael Gutman]] writes that it was in the concentration camps that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s concept of absolute power came to fruition. [[Primo Levi]], who described his year in Auschwitz in ''[[If This Is a Man]]'', wrote:

{{quotation|[N]ever has there existed a state that was really &quot;totalitarian.&quot; ... Never has some form of reaction, a corrective of the total tyranny, been lacking, not even in the Third Reich or Stalin's Soviet Union: in both cases, public opinion, the magistrature, the foreign press, the churches, the feeling for justice and humanity that ten or twenty years of tyranny were not enough to eradicate, have to a greater or lesser extent acted as a brake. Only in the ''Lager'' [camp] was the restraint from below non-existent, and the power of these small [[satrap]]s absolute.&lt;ref&gt;[[Primo Levi]] quoted in Gutman 1994, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Auschwitz I===
[[File:Auschwitz I Entrance.jpg|thumb|upright|Auschwitz I entrance]]
Auschwitz I was the original camp, serving as the administrative center for the whole complex. The site for the camp (16 one-story buildings) had earlier served as Polish army artillery barracks. It was first suggested as a site for a concentration camp for Polish prisoners by [[SS-Oberfuhrer]] [[Arpad Wigand]], an aide to [[Higher SS and Police Leader]] for [[Silesia]], [[Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski]]. Bach-Zelewski had been searching for a site to house prisoners in the [[Silesia]] region as the local prisons were filled to capacity. [[Richard Glucks]], head of the [[Concentration Camps Inspectorate]], sent former [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] commandant, Walter Eisfeld, to inspect the site. Glucks informed SS Reichsfuhrer [[Heinrich Himmler]] that a camp would be built on the site on 21 February 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Rees 2009, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rudolf Höss]] would oversee the development of the camp and serve as the first commandant, SS-Obersturmführer [[Josef Kramer]] was appointed Höss's deputy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gutman 1994, pp. 10, 16&quot;&gt;Gutman 1994, pp. 10, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local residents were evicted, including 1,200 people who lived in shacks around the barracks, creating an empty area of 40&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which the Germans called the &quot;interest area of the camp&quot;. 300 Jewish residents of [[Oświęcim]] were brought in to lay foundations.  From 1940 to 1941 17,000 Polish and Jewish residents of the western districts of [[Oświęcim]] town, from places adjacent to [[Auschwitz Concentration Camp]], were expelled. Germans ordered also expulsions from the villages of [[Broszkowice]], [[Babice]], [[Brzezinka]], [[Rajsko]], [[Pławy]], [[Harmęże]], [[Bór]], and [[Budy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.um.oswiecim.pl/rocznica/index.php?Itemid=99&amp;id=55&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view Article about expulsions from Oświęcim in Polish]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Expulsion of Poles by Germany|The expulsion of Polish civilians]] was a step towards establishing the Camp Interest Zone, which was set up to isolate the camp from the outside world and to carry out business activity to meet the needs of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. German and [[Volksdeutsche]] settlers moved into some buildings whose Jewish population had been deported to the [[ghetto]].

The first prisoners (30 German criminal prisoners from the [[Sachsenhausen]] camp) arrived in May 1940, intended to act as functionaries within the prison system. The first transport of 728 Polish prisoners which included 20 Jews arrived on 14 June 1940 from the prison in [[Tarnow]], Poland.  They were interned in the former building of the Polish Tobacco Monopoly adjacent to the site, until the camp was ready. The inmate population grew quickly, as the camp absorbed Poland's [[intelligentsia]] and [[dissident]]s, including the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish underground resistance]]. By March 1941, 10,900 were imprisoned there, most of them Poles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gutman 1994, pp. 10, 16&quot;/&gt;

The SS selected some prisoners, often German criminals, as specially privileged supervisors of the other inmates (so-called [[Kapo (concentration camp)|''kapos'']]). Although involved in numerous atrocities, only two Kapos were ever prosecuted for their individual behavior; many were deemed to have had little choice but to act as they did.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The various classes of prisoners were distinguishable by special marks on their clothes; Jews and Soviet prisoners of war were generally treated the worst. All inmates had to work in the associated arms factories, except on Sundays, which were reserved for cleaning and showering. The harsh work requirements, combined with poor nutrition and hygiene, led to high death rates among the prisoners.

Block 11 of Auschwitz was the &quot;prison within the prison&quot;, where violators of the numerous rules were punished. Some prisoners were made to spend the nights in &quot;[[standing cell]]s&quot;. These cells were about {{convert|1.5|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}, and four men would be placed in them; they could do nothing but stand, and were forced during the day to work with the other prisoners. In the basement were located the &quot;starvation cells&quot;; prisoners incarcerated here were given neither food nor water until they were dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Kolbe.html |title=Maximilian Kolbe |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Auschwitz I death block 11 04.jpg|thumb|left|Block 11]]
In the basement were the &quot;dark cells&quot;; these cells had only a very tiny window, and a solid door. Prisoners placed in these cells would gradually suffocate as they used up all of the oxygen in the cell; sometimes the [[SS]] would light a candle in the cell to use up the oxygen more quickly. Many were subjected to hanging with their hands behind their backs, thus dislocating their shoulder joints for hours, even days.&lt;ref&gt;Rees 2005, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 3, 1941, deputy camp commandant SS-[[Hauptsturmführer]] [[Karl Fritzsch|Fritzsch]] experimented on 600 Russian [[POW]]s and 250 Polish inmates by gathering them in the basement of Block 11 and gassing them with [[Zyklon B]], a highly lethal [[cyanide]]-based [[pesticide]].&lt;ref name=Fritsch&gt;{{en icon}} [http://en.auschwitz.org.pl/h/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=29&amp;Itemid=32&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=2 Muzeum Auschwitz-Birkenau w Oświęcimiu]&lt;/ref&gt; This paved the way for the use of Zyklon B as an instrument for extermination at Auschwitz, and a gas chamber and crematorium were constructed by converting a bunker.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} This gas chamber operated from 1941 to 1942, during which time some 60,000 people were killed therein; it was then converted into an air-raid shelter for the use of the SS.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} This gas chamber still exists, together with the associated crematorium, which was reconstructed after the war using the original components, which remained on-site.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Auschwitz II-Birkenau===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Treblinka extermination camp]] --&gt;
[[File:Auschwitz-birkenau-main track.jpg|thumb|Auschwitz II-Birkenau]]
Construction on Auschwitz II-Birkenau, the extermination camp, began in October 1941 to ease congestion at the main camp. It was larger than Auschwitz I, and more people passed through its gates than through Auschwitz I. It was designed to hold several categories of prisoners, and to function as an extermination camp in the context of [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s preparations for the [[Final Solution of the Jewish Question]], the extermination of the Jews.&lt;ref name=Gutman16&gt;Gutman 1994, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The first gas chamber at Birkenau was &quot;The Little Red House,&quot; a brick cottage converted into a gassing facility by tearing out the inside and bricking up the walls. It was operational by March 1942. A second brick cottage, &quot;The Little White House,&quot; was similarly converted some weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;Rees 2005, pp. 96-97, 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis had committed themselves to the final solution no later than January 1942, the date of the [[Wannsee Conference]]. In his Nuremberg testimony on April 15, 1946, [[Rudolf Höss]], the commandant of Auschwitz, testified that Heinrich Himmler personally ordered him to prepare Auschwitz for that purpose:

{{quotation|In the summer of 1941 I was summoned to Berlin to Reichsführer-SS Himmler to receive personal orders. He told me something to the effect—I do not remember the exact words—that the Fuehrer had given the order for a final solution of the Jewish question. We, the SS, must carry out that order. If it is not carried out now then the Jews will later on destroy the German people. He had chosen Auschwitz on account of its easy access by rail and also because the extensive site offered space for measures ensuring isolation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/hoesstest.html Testimony of Rudolf Hoess, Commandant of Auschwitz], University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law; [http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%206418.pdf Hoess, Rudolf (1900-1947), camp commandant of Auschwitz], Yad Vashem. Retrieved December 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Birkenau25August1944.jpg|right|thumb|Picture of Birkenau taken by an American surveillance plane, August 25, 1944]]
British historian [[Laurence Rees]] writes, that Höss may have misremembered the year Himmler said this. Himmler did indeed visit Höss in the summer of 1941, but there is no evidence that the final solution had been planned at this stage. Rees writes that the meeting predates the killings of Jewish men by the Einsatzgruppen in the East and the expansion of the killings in July 1941. It also predates the [[Wannsee Conference]]. Rees speculates that the conversation with Himmler was most likely in the summer of 1942.&lt;ref name=Rees53&gt;[[Gustave Gilbert]] witness statement cited in Dwork and Van Pelt 2002, p. 278, cited in Rees 2005, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The first gassings, using an industrial gas derived from [[prussic acid]] and known by the brand name [[Zyklon-B]], were carried out at Auschwitz in September 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.yadvashem.org/about_holocaust/chronology/1939-1941/1941/chronology_1941_27.html September 3: First experimental gassings at Auschwitz], Yad Vashem.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1943, the Nazis decided to increase greatly the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, originally designed as a mortuary, with morgues in the basement and ground-level furnaces, was converted into a killing factory by placing a gas-tight door on the morgues and adding vents for [[Zyklon B]] and ventilation equipment to remove the gas.&lt;ref&gt;Pressac: Auschwitz: Technique and Operation of the Gas Chambers [http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/pressac/technique-and-operation/pressac0100.shtml Holocaust-History.org] p. 100 reports that the timesheets of a civilian worker from the company building the crematorium furnaces prove that the installed ventilation system for removing the hydrocyan acid gas from [[Zyklon B]] application in the morgues worked well.&lt;/ref&gt; It went into operation in March. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the start as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943 all four crematoria were operational. Most of the victims were killed during the period afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Rees 2005, pp. 168-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The camp was staffed partly by prisoners, some of whom were selected to be ''[[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapos]]'' (orderlies, most of whom were convicts) and ''[[sonderkommando]]s'' (workers at the crematoria). The ''kapos'' were responsible for keeping order in the barrack huts; the ''sonderkommandos'' prepared new arrivals for gassing (ordering them to remove their clothing and surrender their personal possessions) and transferred corpses from the gas chambers to the furnaces, having first pulled out any gold that the victims might have had in their teeth. Members of these groups were killed periodically. The ''kapos'' and ''sonderkommandos'' were supervised by members of the SS; altogether 6,000 SS members worked at Auschwitz.

Command of the women's camp, which was separated from the men's area by the incoming railway line, was held in turn by [[Johanna Langefeld]], [[Maria Mandel]], and [[Elisabeth Volkenrath]].

===Auschwitz III===
{{Main|Monowitz concentration camp}}
[[File:Buna Werke.png|thumb|[[Buna-Werke]], [[Monowitz]] and subcamps]]
The largest of the Auschwitz work camps was Auschwitz III-Monowitz, named after the Polish village of [[Monowice]], and regarded from the fall of 1943 onwards as an industrial camp. Starting operations in May 1942, it was associated with the synthetic rubber and liquid fuel plant ''Buna-Werke'' owned by [[IG Farben]]. 11,000 slave laborers worked at Monowitz.  Seven thousand inmates worked at various chemical plants. 8,000 worked in mines. Approximately 40,000 prisoners worked in slave labor camps at Auschwitz or nearby, under appalling conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dwork, Deborah 1997, p. 10&quot;&gt;Dwork and van Pelt, 1997, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In regular intervals, doctors from Auschwitz II would visit the work camps and select the weak and sick for the gas chambers of Birkenau.

===Subcamps===
{{See|List of subcamps of Auschwitz}}
[[File:USHMM95273 -Siemens factory in KZ Bobrek.jpg|thumb|Prisoners building airplane parts at [[Siemens-Schuckert]] factory at Bobrek sub-camp]]
There were 45 smaller satellite camps, some of them tens of kilometers from the main camps, with prisoner populations ranging from several dozen to several thousand.&lt;ref name=Gutman17&gt;Gutman 1994, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest were built at [[Trzebinia]], [[Blechhammer]] and Althammer. Women's subcamps were constructed at [[Budy]], [[Pławy]], [[Zabrze]], [[Gliwice|Gleiwitz]] I, II, III, [[Rajsko]], and Lichtenwerden (now Světlá). The satellite camps were named ''Aussenlager'' (external camp), ''Nebenlager'' (extension or subcamp), and ''Arbeitslager'' (labor camp).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gutman17&quot;/&gt; Danuta Czech of the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]] writes that most of the satellite camps were pressed into service on behalf of German industry. Inmates of 28 of them worked for the German armaments industry. Nine camps were set up near foundries and other metal works, six near coal mines, six supplied prisoners to work in chemical plants, and three to light industry. One was built next to a plant making construction materials and another near a food processing plant. Apart from the weapons and construction industries, prisoners were also made to work in forestry and farming.&lt;ref&gt;Danuta Czech in Gutman 1994, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Selection process and genocide==
[[File:Selection Birkenau ramp.jpg|right|thumb|Selection on the Jewish ramp at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, May/June 1944. To be sent to the right meant labor; to the left, the [[gas chamber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;This image shows the arrival of Hungarian Jews from [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Carpatho-Ruthenia]], many of them from the [[Berehove|Berehov]] ghetto. The main entrance is visible in the background [http://www1.yadvashem.org/exhibitions/album_auschwitz/home_auschwitz_album.html The Auschwitz Album], Yad Vashem.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
By July 1942, the SS were conducting the infamous &quot;selections,&quot; in which incoming Jews were divided into those deemed able to work, who were sent to the right and admitted into the camp, and those who were sent to the left and immediately gassed.&lt;ref&gt;Rees 2005, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners were transported from all over German-occupied Europe by rail, arriving in daily convoys. The group selected to die, about three-quarters of the total, included almost all children, women with children, all the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit. Auschwitz II-Birkenau claimed more victims than any other German extermination camp, despite coming into use after all the others.
[[File:Güterwagen Oppeln der DR (heute im Besitz der Freunde der historischen Hafenbahn e.V.).jpg|thumb|left|upright|A Reichsbahn &quot;goods wagon&quot;, one of the types used for deportations]]
SS officers told the victims they were to take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims would undress in an outer chamber and walk into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility, complete with dummy shower heads. After the doors were shut, SS men would dump in the cyanide pellets via holes in the roof or windows on the side. In Auschwitz II-Birkenau, more than 20,000 people could be gassed and cremated each day. The Nazis used a [[cyanide]] gas produced from [[Zyklon B]] pellets, manufactured by two companies who had acquired licensing rights to the patent held by [[IG Farben]].&lt;!--The following needs a source: The two companies were [[Tesch &amp; Stabenow]], of Hamburg, who supplied two tons of the crystals each month, and [[Degesch]], of [[Dessau]], who produced three-quarters of a ton. The bills of lading were produced at Nuremberg.--&gt;  Despite the thick concrete walls of the gas chambers, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside for 15 to 20 minutes.  In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could be heard over the engines.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;BBC History of World War II.  Auschwitz; Inside the Nazi State.  Part 2, Orders and Initiatives.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0827-318, KZ Auschwitz, Ankunft ungarischer Juden.jpg|thumb|[[Hungarians|Hungarian]] Jews on selection ramp, May, 1944]]
Sonderkommandos removed gold teeth from the corpses of gas chamber victims; the gold was melted down and collected by the SS. The belongings of the arrivals were seized by the SS and sorted in an area of the camp called &quot;Canada,&quot; so-called because Canada was seen as a land of plenty. Many of the SS at the camp enriched themselves by pilfering the confiscated property.&lt;ref&gt;Rees 2005, pp. 172-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gas chambers worked to their fullest capacity from April–July 1944, during the [[History of the Jews in Hungary#Occupation and deportation|massacre of Hungary's Jews]]. Hungary was an ally of Germany during the war, but it had resisted turning over its Jews to the Germans until Germany invaded in March 1944. From April until July 9, 1944, 475,000 Hungarian Jews, half of the pre-war population, were deported to Auschwitz, at a rate of 12,000 a day for a considerable part of that period.&lt;ref&gt;Kárný 1994, p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt; The incoming volume was so great that the SS resorted to burning corpses in open-air pits as well as in the crematoria.&lt;ref&gt;Dwork and van Pelt 1997, pp. 337-343.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life in the camps===
The prisoners' day began at 4:30 a.m. with &quot;reveille&quot; or roll call, with 30 minutes allowed for morning ablutions. After roll call, the ''Kommando'', or work details, would walk to their place of work, five abreast, wearing striped camp fatigues, no underwear, and wooden shoes without socks, most of the time ill-fitting, which caused great pain. An orchestra often played as the workers marched through the gates. [[Kapo (concentration camp)|''Kapos'']]—prisoners who had been promoted to foremen—were responsible for the prisoners' behavior while they worked, as was an SS escort. The working day lasted 12 hours during the summer, and a little less in the winter. No rest periods were allowed. One prisoner would be assigned to the latrines to measure the time the workers took to empty their bladders and bowels.&lt;ref&gt;Gutman 1994, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

After work, there was a mandatory evening roll call. If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, even if it took hours, regardless of the weather conditions. After roll call, there were individual and collective punishments, depending on what had happened during the day, and after these, the prisoners were allowed to retire to their blocks for the night to receive their bread rations and water. Curfew was two or three hours later, the prisoners sleeping in long rows of wooden bunks, lying in and on their clothes and shoes to prevent them from being stolen.&lt;ref&gt;Gutman 1994, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical experiments===
{{Main|Nazi human experimentation}}
[[File:Auschwitz Mengele Block 10.jpg|thumb|left|Block 10, the medical experimentation block]]
German doctors performed a wide variety of experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz. SS doctors tested the efficacy of [[X-rays]] as a [[Sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] device by administering large doses to female prisoners. Prof. Dr. [[Carl Clauberg]] injected chemicals into women's [[uteruses]] in an effort to glue them shut. [[Bayer]], then a subsidiary of [[IG Farben]], bought prisoners to use as [[Human subject research|guinea pigs]] for testing new drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Rees 2005, pp. 178-179.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most infamous doctor at Auschwitz was [[Josef Mengele]], known as the &quot;Angel of Death&quot;. Particularly interested in research on [[identical twins]], Mengele performed cruel experiments on them, such as inducing diseases in one twin and killing the other when the first died to perform comparative [[autopsies]]. He also took a special interest in dwarfs, and he deliberately induced [[gangrene]] in twins, dwarfs and other prisoners to &quot;study&quot; the effects.&lt;ref&gt;Rees 2005, pp. 180-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mengele, at the behest of fellow Nazi physician [[Kurt Heissmeyer]], was responsible for picking the twenty Jewish children to be used in Heissmeyers' pseudoscientific&lt;ref&gt;For &quot;pseudo-scientific&quot;, see:

These children, at the conclusion of the experiments, were infamously hanged from wall hooks in the basement of the [[Bullenhuser Damm]] school in Hamburg.

Dr. Adélaïde Hautval refused to take part in Mengele's experiments on twins and was sent to Birkenau and later to Ravensbruck. She has been honored by [[Yad Vashem]] as a Righteous Among the Nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/flickers_of_light/adelaide_hautval.asp?WT.mc_id=wiki Dr. Adelaide Hautval] from [http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/flickers_of_light/index.asp?WT.mc_id=wiki Flickers of Light: The Stories of Six Righteous Among the Nations in Auschwitz] an online exhibition by [[Yad Vashem]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish skeleton collection===
{{Main|Jewish skeleton collection}}
[[File:Menachem taffel.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[cadaver]] of Berlin dairy merchant Menachem Taffel (b. July 21, 1900 Poland). Deported to Auschwitz in March 1943 along with his wife and child who were gassed upon arrival. He was chosen to be an anatomical specimen and shipped to [[Natzweiler-Struthof]] and murdered in the gas chamber in  August, 1943]]
The Jewish skeleton collection was obtained from among a pool of 115 Jewish inmates at Auschwitz, chosen for their perceived stereotypical racial characteristics. [[Rudolf Brandt]] and [[Wolfram Sievers]], general manager of the [[Ahnenerbe]], were responsible for collecting the skeletons for the collection of the Anatomy Institute at the [[Reichsuniversität Straßburg|Reich University of Strasbourg]] in the [[Alsace]] region of [[Occupied France]]. Due to a [[typhus]] epidemic, the candidates chosen for the skeleton collection were [[quarantine]]d in order to prevent them from becoming ill and ruining their value as anatomical specimens; from a letter written by Sievers in June 1943: &quot;Altogether 115 persons were worked on, 79 were Jews, 30 were Jewesses, 2 were Poles, and 4 were Asiatics. At the present time these prisoners are segregated by sex and are under quarantine in the two hospital buildings of Auschwitz.&quot;

The collection was sanctioned by Heinrich Himmler and under the direction of [[August Hirt]].

Ultimately 87 of the inmates were shipped to [[Natzweiler-Struthof]]. The deaths of 86 of these inmates was, in the words of Hirt, &quot;induced&quot; at a jury rigged gassing facility over the course of a few days in August 1943. One of the victims was shot by the SS when he fought entering the gas chamber. The corpses; 57 men and 29 women were sent to Strasbourg. [[Josef Kramer]] who would become the last commandant of [[Bergen Belsen]] personally carried out the gassing of 80 of the victims.  In 1944 with the approach of the allies, there was concern over the possibility of the corpses being discovered, at this point they had still not been defleshed. The first part of the process for this &quot;collection&quot; was to make anatomical casts of the bodies prior to reducing them to skeletons. In September, 1944 Sievers telegrammed Brandt: &quot;The collection can be defleshed and rendered unrecognizable. This, however, would mean that the whole work had been done for nothing - at least in part - and that this singular collection would be lost to science, since it would be impossible to make plaster casts afterwards.&quot;

Brandt and Sievers would be indicted, tried and convicted in the Doctor's Trial in Nuremberg. Hirt committed suicide in [[Bizau|Schonenbach]], [[Austria]], on June 2, 1945 with a gunshot to the head.&lt;ref&gt;Doctors from Hell: the Horrific Account of Nazi Experiments on Humans.

==Escapes, resistance, and the Allies' knowledge of the camps==
{{See|Auschwitz bombing debate|Witold Pilecki|Rudolf Vrba}}
[[File:Pilecki ausch f.jpg|thumb|Auschwitz camp photos of [[Witold Pilecki]], 1941]]

Information regarding Auschwitz was available to the Allies during the years 1940–43 by the accurate and frequent reports of Polish Army Captain [[Witold Pilecki]]. Pilecki was the only known person to volunteer to be imprisoned at Auschwitz concentration camp, spending 945 days there, not only actively gathering evidence of genocide and supplying it to the British in London by [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance movement]] organization [[Home Army]] but also organizing resistance structures at the camp known as ZOW, [[Związek Organizacji Wojskowej]].&lt;ref&gt;Garlinski 1975; [http://www.pilecki.ipn.gov.pl/portal/rp/867/7081/Rotmistrz_Witold_Pilecki.html IPN.gov.pl]&lt;/ref&gt; His first report was smuggled to the outside world in November 1940. He eventually escaped on April 27, 1943, but his personal report of mass killings was dismissed as exaggeration by the Allies, as were his previous ones.&lt;ref name=ac/&gt;

The attitude of the Allies changed with receipt of the very detailed [[Vrba-Wetzler report]], compiled by two Jewish prisoners, [[Rudolf Vrba]] and [[Alfréd Wetzler]], who escaped on April 7, 1944, and which finally convinced Allied leaders of the truth about Auschwitz. Details from the Vrba-Wetzler report were broadcast on June 15, 1944 by the BBC, and on June 20 by ''The New York Times'', causing the Allies to put pressure on the Hungarian government to stop the mass deportation of Jews to the camp.&lt;ref&gt;Karny 1994, p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with a plea from the Slovakian rabbi [[Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl|Weissmandl]] in May 1944, there was a growing campaign to persuade the Allies to bomb Auschwitz or the railway lines leading to it. At one point [[Winston Churchill]] ordered that such a plan be prepared, but he was told that bombing the camp would most likely kill prisoners without disrupting the killing operation, and that bombing the railway lines was not technically feasible. The debate over what could have been done, or what should have been attempted even if success was unlikely, has continued ever since.

===Birkenau revolt===
[[File:Auschwitz Birkenau Krematorium IV - 05.jpg|thumb|Ruins of Crematorium IV, blown up in the revolt]]
By 1943, resistance organizations had developed in the camp. These organizations helped a few prisoners escape; these escapees took with them news of exterminations, such as the killing of hundreds of thousands of Jews transported from Hungary between May and July 1944. On October 7, 1944, the Jewish ''[[Sonderkommando]]s'' (those inmates kept separate from the main [[Internment|camp]] and put to work in the gas chambers and crematoria) of Birkenau Kommando III staged an uprising. They attacked the [[SS]] with makeshift weapons: stones, axes, hammers, other work tools and homemade [[grenade]]s. They caught the SS guards by surprise, overpowered them and blew up the Crematorium IV, using [[explosives]] smuggled in from a weapons factory by female inmates. At this stage they were joined by the Birkenau Kommando I of the Crematorium II, which also overpowered their guards and broke out of the [[Compound (enclosure)|compound]]. Hundreds of prisoners escaped, but were all soon captured and, along with an additional group who participated in the [[revolt]], [[executed]].&lt;ref&gt;Rees 2005, pp. 256-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also plans for a general uprising in [[Auschwitz]], coordinated with an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[airstrike|air raid]] and a Polish resistance ([[Armia Krajowa]], Home Army) attack from the outside.&lt;ref name=ac&gt;Adam Cyra, Ochotnik do Auschwitz - Witold Pilecki 1901-1948, Oświęcim 2000. ISBN 83-912000-3-5&lt;/ref&gt; That plan was authored by Polish resistance fighter, [[Witold Pilecki]], who organized in Auschwitz an underground Union of Military Organization - ([[Związek Organizacji Wojskowej]], ZOW). Pilecki and ZOW hoped that the Allies would drop arms or troops into the camp (most likely the [[Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade]], based in Britain), and that the Home Army would organize an assault on the camp from outside. By 1943, however, he realized that the Allies had no such plans. Meanwhile, the Gestapo redoubled its efforts to ferret out ZOW members, succeeding in killing many of them. Pilecki decided to break out of the camp, with the hope of personally convincing Home Army leaders that a rescue attempt was a valid option. He escaped on the night of April 26–April 27, 1943, but his plan was not accepted by the Home Army as the Allies considered his reports about the Holocaust exaggerated.&lt;ref name=&quot;ac&quot; /&gt;

===Individual escape attempts===
At least 802 prisoners attempted to escape from the Auschwitz camps during the years of their operation, of which 144 were successful. The fates of 331 of the escapees are still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://en.auschwitz.org.pl/m/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=458&amp;Itemid=8 Państwowe Muzeum Auschwitz-Birkenau w Oświęcimiu]&lt;/ref&gt; A common punishment for escape attempts was death by starvation; the families of successful escapees were sometimes arrested and interned in Auschwitz and prominently displayed to deter others. If someone did manage to escape, the SS would pick 10  people at random from the prisoner's block and starve them to death.&lt;ref&gt;Rees 2005, pp. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the concentration camps were designed to degrade prisoners beneath human dignity, maintaining the will to survive was seen in itself as an act of rebellion. [[Primo Levi]] was taught this lesson by his fellow prisoner and friend Steinlauf:
{{quotation|[that] &quot;precisely because the camp was a great machine to reduce us to beasts, we must not become beasts; that even in this place one can survive, and therefore one must want to survive, to tell the story, to bear witness; and that, if we want to survive, then it's important that we strive to preserve at least the skeleton, the scaffolding, the external shape of civilization.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Levi 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The most spectacular escape from Auschwitz took place on 20 June 1942, when Ukrainian Eugeniusz Bendera and three Poles, [[Kazimierz Piechowski]], Stanisław Gustaw Jaster and Józef Lempart made a daring escape.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Byłem Numerem: swiadectwa Z Auschwitz&quot; by Kazimierz Piechowski, Eugenia Bozena Kodecka-Kaczynska, Michal Ziokowski, Hardcover, Wydawn. Siostr Loretanek, ISBN 83-7257-122-8&lt;/ref&gt; The escapees were dressed as members of the [[3rd SS Division Totenkopf|SS-Totenkopfverbände]], fully armed and in an SS staff car. They drove out the main gate in a stolen automobile, a [[Steyr automobile|Steyr]] 220 belonging to [[Rudolf Höss]]. Jaster carried with him  a report about conditions in the camp, written by [[Witold Pilecki]]. The Germans never recaptured any of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.auschwitz.org.pl/m/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=578&amp;Itemid=8 |title=Auschwitz.org.pl |publisher=En.auschwitz.org.pl |date=2009-01-13 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, the &quot;''Kampfgruppe Auschwitz''&quot; was organised with the aim to send out as much information about what was happening in Auschwitz as possible. They buried notes in the ground in the hope a liberator would find them and smuggled out photos of the crematoria and gas chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Daring to Resist: Jewish Defiance in the Holocaust Publisher: Museum of Jewish Heritage - A Living Memorial to the Holocaust (April 1, 2007) ISBN 0-9716859-2-4 ISBN 978-0-9716859-2-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evacuation, death marches, and liberation==
{{See|Death marches (Holocaust)}}
[[File:Dachau death march.jpg|thumb|Death march]]The last selection took place on October 30, 1944. The next month, Heinrich Himmler ordered the crematoria destroyed before the [[Red Army]] reached the camp. The gas chambers of Birkenau were blown up by the SS in January 1945 in an attempt to hide the German crimes from the advancing Soviet troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rees|first=Laurence|title=Auschwitz: The Nazis &amp; the Final Solutiuon|year=2005|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780563522966|pages=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SS command sent orders on January 17, 1945 calling for the execution of all prisoners remaining in the camp, but in the chaos of the Nazi retreat the order was never carried out. On January 17, 1945, Nazi personnel started to evacuate the facility. Nearly 60,000 prisoners were forced on a [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]] toward a camp in [[Wodzisław Śląski]] (German: ''[[Loslau]]''). Those too weak or sick to walk were left behind. These remaining 7,500 prisoners were liberated by the [[322nd Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|322nd Rifle Division]] of the [[Red Army]] on January 27, 1945. Approximately 20,000 Auschwitz prisoners made it to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] in Germany, where they were liberated by the British in April 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Rees 2005, pp. 260-265.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the artifacts of automated murder found by the Russians were 348,820 men's suits and 836,255 women's garments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dwork, Deborah 1997, p. 10&quot; /&gt;

==Death toll==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-74237-004, KZ Auschwitz-Birkenau, alte Frau und Kinder.jpg|right|thumb|Children and an old woman on the way to the death barracks of Auschwitz-Birkenau]]
The exact number of victims at Auschwitz is impossible to fix with certainty. Since the Nazis destroyed a number of records, immediate efforts to count the dead depended on the testimony of witnesses and the defendants on trial at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]]. While under interrogation [[Rudolf Höss]], commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp from 1940 to 1943, said that [[Adolf Eichmann]] told him that two and a half million Jews had been killed in gas chambers and about half a million had died &quot;naturally&quot;. Later he wrote &quot;I regard two and a half million far too high. Even Auschwitz had limits to its destructive possibilities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Commandant of Auschwitz: Rudolf Höß''. Appendix one, pp. 193-194. ISBN 1-84212-024-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Communist Polish and Soviet authorities maintained a figure &quot;between 2.5 and 4 million&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;harmon-drobnicki&quot;&gt;Brian Harmon, John Drobnicki, [http://nizkor.org/features/techniques-of-denial/appendix-2-01.html Historical sources and the Auschwitz death toll estimates], [http://nizkor.org/ ''The Nizkor Project'']&lt;/ref&gt; and the Auschwitz State Museum itself displayed a figure of 4 million killed, but &quot;[f]ew (if any) historians ever believed the Museum's four million figure&quot;.&lt;ref name=AuschwitzGambit&gt;[[Nizkor Project|Nizkor]], [http://www.nizkor.org/features/techniques-of-denial/four-million-02.html The Auschwitz Gambit: The Four Million Variant]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raul Hilberg]]'s 1961 work ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'' estimated the number killed at 1,000,000, and [[Gerald Reitlinger]]'s 1968 book ''The Final Solution'' described the Soviet figures as &quot;ridiculous&quot;, and estimated the number killed at &quot;800,000 to 900,000&quot;.&lt;ref name=AuschwitzGambit/

In 1983, French scholar George Wellers was one of the first to use German data on deportations to estimate the number killed at Auschwitz, arriving at 1.613 million dead, including 1.44 million Jews and 146,000 Catholic Poles.&lt;ref&gt;Wellers, Georges. Essai de determination du nombre de morts au camp d'Auschwitz (attempt to determine the number of dead at the Auschwitz camp), ''Le Monde Juif'', Oct-Dec 1983, pp. 127-159.&lt;/ref&gt; A larger study started later by [[Franciszek Piper]] used timetables of train arrivals combined with deportation records to calculate 960,000 Jewish deaths and 140,000-150,000 ethnic Polish victims, along with 23,000 [[Roma]] and [[Sinti]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Piper 1994, pp. 68-72&quot;&gt;Piper 1994, pp. 68-72.&lt;/ref&gt; a figure that has met with significant agreement from other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Cesarani and Kavanaugh 2004, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of the Communist government in 1989, the plaque at Auschwitz State Museum was removed and the official death toll given as 1.1 million. [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] have attempted to use this change as [[propaganda]], in the words of the [[Nizkor Project]]: {{quote|Deniers often use the 'Four Million Variant' as a stepping stone to leap from an apparent contradiction to the idea that the Holocaust was a hoax, again perpetrated by a conspiracy. They hope to discredit historians by making them seem inconsistent. If they can't keep their numbers straight, their reasoning goes, how can we say that their evidence for the Holocaust is credible? One must wonder which historians they speak of, as most have been remarkably consistent in their estimates of a million or so dead... Few (if any) historians ever believed the Museum's four million figure, having arrived at their own estimates independently. The museum's inflated figures were never part of the estimated five to six million Jews killed in the Holocaust, so there is no need to revise this figure.&lt;ref name=AuschwitzGambit/&gt;}}

==Timeline of events at Auschwitz==
The timeline of events at the Auschwitz concentration camp began in January 1940 when the location was first visited by [[Arpad Wigand]] an aid to the Higher SS and Police Leader for [[Silesia]] [[Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski]]. The original intent of the camp was to intern Polish political prisoners. The original uses of the camp were added to and the capacity expanded over the course of the next four years, which reflected the political and economic decisions of the [[Third Reich]], including the implementation of the [[Final Solution]].

==After the war==
{{main|Auschwitz Trial}}
After the war, parts of Auschwitz 1 and/or its guards' quarters served first as a hospital for sick liberated prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.auschwitz.org.pl/m/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=13&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=1 |title=Auschwitz.org.pl |publisher=En.auschwitz.org.pl |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1947 some of the facilities were used as an [[NKVD]] and [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland|MBP]] prison camp. The ''Buna–Werke'' were taken over by the Polish government and became the foundation for the region's chemical industry. At Auschwitz 1 the Gestapo building was demolished and on its site was built a [[gallows]] on which [[Standartenführer]] SS [[Rudolf Höss]] was hanged on 17 April 1947 for numerous war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isurvived.org/Lustig_Oliver-CCDictionary/CCD-05_FG.html#B5 |title=Concentration Camp Dictionary &quot;F-G&quot;]|author= Oliver Lustig |publisher=Isurvived.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 24, 1947, the [[Auschwitz trial]] began in [[Kraków]], when the Poland's [[Supreme National Tribunal]] tried 41 former staff of the Auschwitz concentration camps complex. The trials ended on December 22, 1947, with 23 death sentences issued, as well as 16 imprisonments ranging from life sentence to 3 years.

After liberation, local Polish farming population returning to the area searched the ruins of Birkenau thoroughly for re-usable fallen bricks, so they could rebuild farm buildings for shelter needed for the next winter. That explains the &quot;missing rubble&quot; argument brought up by [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]].

Today, at Birkenau the entrance building and some of the southern brick-built barracks survive; but of the almost 300 wooden barracks, only 19 have been reconstructed from authentic materials: 18 near the entrance building and one, on its own, farther away. All that survives of the others are chimneys, remnants of a largely ineffective means of heating. Many of these wooden buildings were constructed from prefabricated sections made by a company that intended them to be used as stables; inside, numerous metal rings for the tethering of horses can still be seen.

===Creation of the museum===
{{Main|Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum}}
[[File:Auschwitzruins.jpg|thumb|Ruins at Birkenau, with brick chimneys belonging to wooden barracks being prominent]]
The Polish government decided to restore Auschwitz I and turn it into a museum honouring the victims of [[Nazism]]; Auschwitz II, where buildings (many of which were prefabricated wood structures) were prone to decay, was preserved but not restored. Today, the Auschwitz I museum site combines elements from several periods into a single complex: for example the gas chamber at Auschwitz I (which had been converted into an air-raid shelter for the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]) was restored and the fence was moved (because of building work being done after the war but before the museum was established). However, in most cases the departure from the historical truth is minor, and is clearly labelled. The museum contains many men's, women's and children's shoes taken from their victims; also suitcases, which the deportees were encouraged to bring with them, and many household utensils. One display case, some {{convert|30|m|ft}} long, is wholly filled with human hair which the Nazis gathered from people before they were sent to labor or before and after they were killed.
[[File:AuschwitzGallows2006.JPG|upright|thumb|Gallows in Auschwitz I where Rudolf Höss was executed on April 16, 1947]]
Auschwitz II and the remains of the gas chambers there are open to the public. The camp is on the list of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]]. The ashes of the victims were scattered between the huts, and the entire area is regarded as a grave site. Most of the buildings of Auschwitz I are still standing. The public entrance area is outside the [[perimeter fence]] in what was the camp admission building, where new prisoners were registered and given their uniforms. At the far end of Birkenau are memorial [[Commemorative plaque|plaques]] in many languages, including [[Romani language|Romani]].

The museum has allowed scenes for three films to be filmed on the site: ''[[Passenger (film)|Pasażerka]]'' (1963) by Polish director [[Andrzej Munk]], ''[[Landscape After the Battle]]'' (1970) by Polish director [[Andrzej Wajda]], and a television miniseries ''[[War and Remembrance]]'' (1978). Permission was denied to [[Steven Spielberg]] to film scenes for ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1993). A &quot;mirror&quot; camp was constructed outside the infamous archway for the scene where the train arrives carrying the women who were saved by [[Oskar Schindler]].

===&quot;Arbeit macht frei&quot; sign theft===

&lt;!--{{see|Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum#&quot;Arbeit macht frei&quot; sign theft|Arbeit macht frei#Sign theft at Auschwitz}}--&gt;
The {{convert|5|m|ft|adj=on}}, {{convert|41|kg|lb|adj=on}} wrought-iron &quot;[[Arbeit macht frei]]&quot; sign over the entrance to Auschwitz I was stolen in the early morning of December 18, 2009.  The thieves unscrewed the sign at one end and broke it off its mountings at the other end, then carried the sign 300 metres to a hole in the concrete wall, where they cut four metal bars blocking the opening. After the theft, authorities replaced the stolen sign with a replica, which was originally made to replace the original sign while it was being restored some years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8419948.stm |title=Auschwitz death camp sign stolen |publisher=BBC News |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the concern about its theft that Poland declared a state of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, Kate.

Police found the sign, cut into three parts, in northern Poland two days later in the home of one of five men who were arrested. An unnamed overseas buyer is believed to have been involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/world/europe/23briefs-Polandbf.html Poland: Foreigner Is Suspected in Theft of Auschwitz Sign], Associated Press, December 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Polish police said that the five were common thieves, not [[neo-Nazi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/22/20091221/tts-uk-poland-auschwitz-ca02f96.html News.Yahoo.com]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8423827.stm Police in Poland find sign stolen from Auschwitz gate], BBC News, December 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The original sign was welded back together on site and will probably form part of a new exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Easton  | first = Adam  | title = Auschwitz museum unveils restored stolen sign  | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13444744  | date = 18 May 2011  | publisher = [[BBC News]]  | accessdate = 19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An improved security system will be put in place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sltrib.com/ci_14044451?source=rss SLtrib.com]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gera&gt;{{cite news |last=Gera |first=Vanessa |url=http://www.sltrib.com/ci_14044451 |title=Damaged Auschwitz sign to go back up at main gate |agency=[[The Associated Press]] |publisher=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |date=December 21, 2009 |accessdate=December 23, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sign was made by Polish workers on Nazi orders after the Auschwitz barracks were converted into a [[labor camp]] to house captured Polish resistance fighters in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/6854075/Auschwitz-sign-found-in-three-pieces.html |title=Telegraph.co.uk |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2009-12-21 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' newspaper reported that the sign had been stolen by Polish thieves paid by and working on behalf of a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] right-wing extremist group hoping to use proceeds from the proposed sale of the sign to a collector of Nazi memorabilia, to finance a series of terror attacks aimed at influencing voters in upcoming Swedish parliamentary elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fish |first=Sandra |url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/01/01/auschwitz-sign-theft-linked-to-far-right-terrorist-plot/ |title=Politicsdaily.com |publisher=Politicsdaily.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/284804 |title=DigitalJournal.com |publisher=DigitalJournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theft was organised by the Swedish former Nazi, Anders Högström.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article6760745.ab |title=Aftonbladet.se |publisher=Aftonbladet.se |date=2010-03-11 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 18, 2010, a Polish court sentenced three men to prison for stealing the sign. They [[Plead guilty|pleaded guilty]]. The sentences were from 18 months to 30 months. They were fined £2,300 each.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', page 20, issue of Friday 19 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of them were granted compassionate leave, but in April the three did not report to the prison to serve their sentences, and police were trying to find them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Associated |first=The |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/auschwitz-sign-thieves-fail-to-show-up-for-prison-terms-1.284630 |title=Auschwitz sign thieves fail to show up for prison terms - Haaretz Daily Newspaper &amp;#124; Israel News |publisher=Haaretz.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated |first=The |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/world/europe/22poland.html |title=Auschwitz Thieves Fail to Report to Jail |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/04/22/auschwitz-thieves-flee-115875-22203083/ |title=Men jailed for stealing Auschwitz camp sign failed to return after compassionate leave |publisher=mirror.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archery''' is the art, practice, or skill of propelling [[arrow]]s with the use of a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]], from &quot;arcus&quot; (Latin). Archery has historically been used for [[hunting]] and [[combat]]; in modern times, however, its main use is that of a recreational activity. One who practises archery is typically known as an &quot;archer&quot; or &quot;bowman&quot;, and one who is fond of or an expert at archery can be referred to as a &quot;toxophilite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The noun &quot;toxophilite&quot;, meaning &quot;a lover or devotee of archery, an archer&quot;, is derived from ''[[Toxophilus]]'' by [[Roger Asham]] —&quot;imaginary proper name invented by Ascham, and hence title of his book (1545), intended to mean 'lover of the bow'.&quot; &quot;toxophilite, n.&quot; ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Second edition, 1989; online version November 2010. &lt;http://www.oed.com:80/Entry/204131&gt;; accessed 10 March 2011. Earlier version first published in ''New English Dictionary'', 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of archery}}
The bow seems to have been invented in the late [[Paleolithic]] or early [[Mesolithic]] periods. The oldest indication for its use in Europe comes from the [[Stellmoor]] in the [[Ahrensburg valley]] north of [[Hamburg]], Germany and date from the late [[Paleolithic]], about 10,000–9000 BC. The arrows were made of [[pine]] and consisted of a mainshaft and a 15–20&amp;nbsp;centimetre (6–8&amp;nbsp;[[inch]]es) long fore shaft with a [[flint]] point. There are no definite earlier bows; previous pointed shafts are known, but may have been launched by [[atlatl]]s rather than bows. The [[Holmegaard bow|oldest bows]] known so far come from the [[Holmegaard|Holmegård]] swamp in Denmark. Bows eventually replaced the [[atlatl]] as the predominant means for launching shafted [[projectiles]], on every continent except Australia (woomera used), though the atlatl persisted alongside the bow in parts of the Americas, notably Mexico (from which its Nahuatl name comes) and amongst the Inuit.

Bows and arrows have been present in [[Egypt]]ian culture since its [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] origins. In the [[Levant]], artifacts which may be arrow-shaft straighteners are known from the [[Natufian culture]], (c. 12,800–10,300 [[Before Present|BP]] (before present)) onwards. The [[Khiamian]] and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPN A]] shouldered Khiam-points may well be arrowheads.

[[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[civilizations]], notably the [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]], [[Persian Empire|Persians]], [[Parthia]]ns, [[History of India|Indians]], [[History of Korea|Koreans]], [[History of China|Chinese]], and [[History of Japan|Japanese]] and [[Turkish archery|Turks]] fielded large numbers of archers in their armies. The Sanskrit term for archery, [[dhanurveda]], came to refer to martial arts in general.

Archery was highly developed in Asia and in the Islamic world. In East Asia, ancient Korean civilizations, such as the [[Silla]], [[Baekje]], and [[Goguryeo]] were well known for their regiments of exceptionally skilled archers.&lt;ref name=&quot;koreantrad&quot;&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central Asian tribesmen (after the [[domestication of the horse]]) and American [[Plains Indians]] (after gaining access to horses) were extremely adept at archery on [[horseback]]. At Crecy, France, in the year 1346, the [[English longbow]] proved its worth for the first time in Continental warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bow Evolution | url=http://www.archeryequipment.org/category/bow-evolution/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline and survival of archery===

The development of [[Gunpowder warfare|firearms]] rendered bows obsolete in warfare. Despite the high social status, ongoing utility, and widespread pleasure of archery in Korea, England, China, Japan, Turkey, Armenia, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|America]], Egypt, India and elsewhere, almost every culture that gained access to even early firearms used them widely, to the relative neglect of archery. Early firearms were vastly inferior in rate-of-fire, and were very susceptible to wet weather. However, they had longer effective range&lt;ref name=&quot;koreantrad&quot; /&gt; and were tactically superior in the common situation of soldiers shooting at each other from behind obstructions. They also required significantly less training to use properly, in particular penetrating steel armour without any need to develop special [[musculature]]. Armies equipped with guns could thus provide superior firepower by sheer weight of numbers, and highly-trained archers became almost obsolete on the battlefield. However, archers are still effective and have seen action even in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = FEATURE-Athletics-Unrest threatens Kenya sporting hopes |work= Reuters  | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/africaCrisis/idUS120100751372 | accessdate = 2010-04-02 | date=22 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional archery remains in use for sport, and for hunting in many areas.

=== Modern primitive archery===

In the United States, competition archery and bowhunting for many years used [[English people|English]]-style [[longbow]]s. The revival of modern primitive archery may be traced to [[Ishi]], who came out of hiding in California in 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;bible4&quot;&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope and Young Club, founded in 1961 and named in honor of Pope and his friend, Arthur Young, is one of North America's leading bowhunting and conservation organizations. Founded as a nonprofit scientific organization, the Club is patterned after the prestigious Boone and Crockett Club. The Club advocates and encourages responsible bowhunting by promoting quality, fair chase hunting, and sound conservation practices.

From the 1920s, professional engineers took an interest in archery, previously the exclusive field of traditional craft experts.&lt;ref name=&quot;technical&quot;&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They led the commercial development of new forms of bow including the modern [[recurve bow|recurve]] and [[compound bow]]. These modern forms are now dominant in modern Western archery; traditional bows are in a minority. In the 1980s, the skills of traditional archery were revived by American enthusiasts, and combined with the new scientific understanding. Much of this expertise is available in the ''Traditional Bowyer's Bibles'' (see Additional reading). Modern game archery owes much of its success to [[Fred Bear]], an American bow hunter and bow manufacturer.

===Eighteenth century revival===

At the end of the eighteenth century archery became popular amongst the English gentry thanks to a fashion for the gothic, curious and medieval.  Encouraged by Royal patronage and, later, the popularity of the work of Sir Walter Scott, archery societies were set up across the country, each with its own strict entry criteria, outlandish costumes and extravagant balls.  The clubs were &quot;the drawing rooms of the great country houses placed outside&quot; and thus came to play an important role in the social networks of local elites.  As well as its emphasis on display and status, the sport was notable for its popularity with females.  Young women could not only compete in the contests but retain and show off their &quot;feminine forms&quot; whilst doing so.  Thus archery came to act as a forum for introductions, flirtation and romance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://swansea.academia.edu/MartinJohnes/Papers/127610/Archery--Romance-and-Elite-Culture-in-England-and-Wales--c--1780-1840 Archery--Romance-and-Elite-Culture-in-England-and-Wales--c--1780-1840 Martin Johnes. Archery, Romance and Elite Culture in England and Wales, c. 1780-1840 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythology===
Deities and heroes in several mythologies are described as archers,  including the Greek [[Artemis]] and [[Apollo]], the Roman [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and [[Cupid]], the Germanic [[Agilaz]], continuing in legends like those of [[William Tell]], [[Palnetoke]], or [[Robin Hood]]. Armenian [[Hayk]] and Babylonian [[Marduk]], Indian [[Karna]], [[Arjuna]], [[Rama]], [[Abhimanyu]], and [[Shiva]], and Persian [[Arash (mythology)|Arash]] were all archers. Earlier Greek representations of [[Heracles]] normally depict him as an archer. The Nymphai Hyperboreioi (Νύμφαι Ὑπερβόρειοι) were worshipped on the Greek island of Delos as attendants of [[Artemis]], presiding over aspects of archery; Hekaerge (Ἑκαέργη), represented distancing, Loxo (Λοξώ), trajectory, and Oupis (Οὖπις), aim.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NymphaiHyperboreiai.html Nymphai Hyperboreioi at Theoi Greek Mythology&lt;/ref&gt; In East Asia, [[Houyi|Yi the archer]] features in several early Chinese myths,&lt;ref name=&quot;selby&quot;&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the historical character of [[Zhou Tong (archer)|Zhou Tong]] features in many fictional forms. [[Jumong]], the first [[Taewang]] of the [[Goguryeo]] kingdom of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], is claimed by legend to have been a near-godlike archer. In [[West Africa]]n [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] belief, [[Ochosi|Osoosi]] is one of several deities of the hunt who are identified with bow and arrow iconography and other insignia associated with archery.

==Equipment==
===Types of bows===
{{main|Bow (weapon)}}
While there is great variety in the construction details of bows (both historic and modern) all bows consist of a string attached to elastic limbs that store mechanical energy imparted by the user drawing the string. Bows may be broadly split into two categories: those drawn by pulling the string directly and those that use a mechanism to pull the string.

Directly drawn bows may be further divided based upon differences in the method of limb construction, notable examples being [[self bow]]s, [[laminated bow]]s and [[composite bow]]s. Bows can also be classified by the [[shape|bow shape]] of the limbs when unstrung; in contrast to simple straight bows, a [[Recurve#Bows with curved side-view profiles|recurve bow]] has tips that curve away from the archer when the bow is unstrung. The cross-section of the limb also varies; the classic [[longbow]] is a tall bow with narrow limbs that are D-shaped in cross section, and the [[flatbow]] has flat wide limbs that are approximately rectangular in cross-section. The classic D-shape comes from the use of the wood of the yew tree. The sap-wood is best suited to the tension on the back of the bow, and the heart-wood to the compression on the belly. Hence, a limb sector of yew wood shows the narrow, light-coloured sap-wood on the 'straight' part of the D, and the red/orange heartwood forms the curved part of the D, to balance the mechanical tension/compression stress. [[Cable-backed bow]]s use cords as the back of the bow; the draw weight of the bow can be adjusted by changing the tension of the cable. They were widespread among [[Inuit]] who lacked easy access to good bow wood. One variety of cable-backed bow is the Penobscot bow or [[Wabenaki]] bow, invented by Frank Loring (Chief Big Thunder) about 1900.&lt;ref&gt;The Penobscot War Bow. Gordon M Day. Contributions to Canadian Ethnology 1975. Canadian Ethnology Service Paper no. 31. ISSN 0316-1854. Ottawa 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a small bow attached by cables on the back of a larger main bow.

A [[compound bow]] is a bow designed to reduce the force required to hold the string at full draw, hence allowing the archer more time to aim with less muscular stress. Most compound designs use cams or elliptical wheels on the ends of the limbs to achieve this. A typical let-off is anywhere from 65%–80%. For example, a 60-pound bow with 80% let-off will only require 12 pounds of force to hold at full draw. Up to 99% let-off is possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://conceptarchery.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The compound bow has become the most widely used type of bow for all forms of hunting in North America. The compound bow has become a highly popular form of archery, so much so that it is the most commonly used bow form in archery today. The compound bow was first developed in 1966 by Holless Wilbur Allen in Missouri, and a US patent was granted in 1969.

Mechanically drawn bows typically have a stock or other mounting, such as the [[crossbow]]. They are not limited by the strength of a single archer and larger varieties have been used as [[siege engine]]s.

===Types of arrows and fletchings===

{{main|Arrow}}
The most common form of arrow consists of a [[Arrow#Shaft|shaft]] with an [[arrowhead]] attached to the front end and with [[fletching]]s and a [[Arrow#Nocks|nock]] attached to the other end. Shafts are typically composed of solid [[wood]], [[Glass-reinforced plastic|fiberglass]], [[aluminium alloy]], [[carbon fiber]], or [[composite material]]s. Wooden arrows are prone to warping. Fiberglass arrows are brittle, but can be produced to uniform specifications easily. Aluminium shafts were a very popular high-performance choice in the latter half of the 20th century due to their straightness, lighter weight, and subsequently higher speed and flatter trajectories. Carbon fiber arrows became popular in the 1990s and are very light, flying even faster and flatter than aluminium arrows. Today, arrows made up of composite materials are the most popular tournament arrows at Olympic Events, especially the [[Easton (company)|Easton]] X10 and A/C/E.

The arrowhead is the primary functional component of the arrow. Some arrows may simply use a sharpened tip of the solid shaft, but it is far more common for separate arrowheads to be made, usually from metal, stone, or other hard materials. The most commonly used forms are target points, field points, and broadheads, although there are also other types, such as bodkin, judo, and blunt heads.

[[Image:Spliced feather 0002.jpg|thumb|150px|Shield cut straight fletching – here the hen feathers are barred red]]
[[Fletching]] is traditionally made from bird [[feather]]s, usually Turkey. Also solid [[plastic]] '''vanes''' and thin sheetlike spin vanes are used. They are attached near the nock (rear) end of the arrow with thin double sided tape, glue, or, traditionally, sinew. Three fletches is the most common configuration in all cultures, though as many as six have been used. Two will result in unstable arrow flight. When ''three-fletched'' the fletches are equally spaced around the shaft with one placed such that it is perpendicular to the bow when nocked on the string (though with modern equipment, variations are seen especially when using the modern spin vanes).  This fletch is called the &quot;index fletch&quot; or &quot;cock feather&quot; (also known as &quot;the odd vane out&quot; or &quot;the nocking vane&quot;) and the others are sometimes called the &quot;hen feathers&quot;.  Commonly, the cock feather is of a different color. Traditionally, the hens are solid and the cock is barred.  However, if archers are using fletching made of feather or similar material, they may use same color vanes, as different dyes can give varying stiffness to vanes, resulting in less precision.  When ''four-fletched'', often two opposing fletches are cock feathers and occasionally the fletches are not evenly spaced.

The fletching may be either ''parabolic'' (short feathers in a smooth parabolic curve) or ''shield'' (generally shaped like half of a narrow shield) cut and is often attached at an angle, known as ''helical'' fletching, to introduce a stabilizing spin to the arrow while in flight.  Whether helicial or straight fletched, when natural fletching (bird feathers) are used it is critical that all feathers come from the same side of the bird.  Oversized fletchings can be used to accentuate drag and thus limit the range of the arrow significantly; these arrows are called ''[[flu-flu arrow|flu-flus]]''. Misplacement of fletchings can often change the arrow's flight path dramatically.

===Bow string===
{{main|Bow string}}
[[Dacron]] and other modern materials offer high strength for their weight and are used on most modern bows. [[Linen]] and other traditional materials are still used on traditional bows. Almost any fiber can be made into a bow string. The author of &quot;Arab Archery&quot; suggests the hide of a young, emaciated camel.&lt;ref name=&quot;arabarchery&quot;&gt;{{citation

===Protective equipment===

[[Image:Finger-tab hg.jpg|Finger tab|thumb]]
[[Image:Kilwinning Archer's bonnet.JPG|left|thumb|&lt;Center&gt;The traditional bonnet of the Kilwinning Archers of Scotland.]]
Most archers wear a [[bracer (archery)|bracer]] (also known as an arm-guard) to protect the inside of the bow arm from being hit by the string and prevent clothing from catching the bow string. The bracer does not brace the arm, the word comes from the armoury term &quot;brassard&quot;, meaning an armoured sleeve or badge. The [[Navajo people]] have developed highly-ornamented bracers as non-functional items of adornment.&lt;ref name=&quot;ketoh&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some archers (mostly women) also wear protection on their chests, called chestguards or [[plastron]]s. The Amazon myth is that they had one breast removed to solve this problem. [[Roger Ascham]] mentions one archer, presumably with an unusual shooting style, who wore a leather guard for his face.&lt;ref name=&quot;ascham&quot;&gt;{{citation

The drawing digits are normally protected by a leather [[finger tab|tab]], glove, or [[thumb ring]]. A simple tab of leather is commonly used, as is a skeleton glove. Medieval Europeans probably used a complete leather glove.&lt;ref name=&quot;warbow&quot;&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt; but also with [[thumb ring|special rings]] of various hard materials. Many surviving Turkish and Chinese examples are works of considerable art. Some are so highly ornamented that the users could not have used them to loose an arrow. Possibly these were items of personal adornment, and hence value, remaining extant whilst leather had virtually no intrinsic value and would also deteriorate with time. In traditional [[Kyūdō|Japanese archery]] a special [[yugake|glove]] is used, provided with a ridge which is used to draw the string.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elmer R.P pages 345-349&quot;&gt;Elmer R.P. Target Archery 1952 pages 345-349&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release aids===
Archers using compound bows usually use a release aid to hold the string and release it precisely. This attaches to the bowstring just below the nocking point or at the D loop and permits the archer to release the string by the use of some form of trigger. When such a device was first invented (patent filed in USA, 1879) it was known as a &quot;clutch&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Elmer R.P. Target Archery 1952 page 297&lt;/ref&gt; The trigger may be an actual trigger lever which is depressed by a finger or thumb (positive),or held then released (negative) but there are numerous types. Hydraulic and mechanical time delay triggers have been used, as have &quot;back tension&quot; triggers which are operated by either a change in the position of the release or &quot;true back tension&quot;; that is to say the release triggers when a pre-determined draw weight is reached.

A mechanical release (the use of the word &quot;aid&quot; can be omitted when context is appropriate) permits a single point of contact on the string instead of three fingers. This allows less deformity in the string at full draw, as well as providing a more consistent release. This is primarily because the most successful types operate with positive pressure, whereas the conventional 'fingers' release is negative. The mental process of applying positive pressure tends to assist the archer to hold positive form overall, negative can lead to further negative effects.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The mechanical release holds the string by retaining it by some form of gate or loop of cord. The gate or cord is released by operation of the trigger, allowing the string to push open the gate or cord. Consequently, any sideways movement of the string, and hence arrow nock, is likely to be less than if fingers were used. It therefore follows that flexing of the arrow shaft during acceleration is going to be different from a finger release. Therefore &quot;arrow / bow / archer&quot; matching will be different.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In Central Asia and the Middle East, thumbrings were used for string retention and release. The correct use of a thumbring potentially makes the release more &quot;clean&quot; compared to the three finger method. The arrow must be positioned on the other side of the bow, to properly use a thumbring, to allow the &quot;archers's paradox&quot; to work, since the thumb opens in the opposite direction to the fingers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elmer R.P pages 345-349&quot;/&gt;

===Stabilisers===
{{Split section|date=March 2011}}
This is a general term for various types of weights, usually on rods, mounted on the bow to increase stability i.e. lessen movement on release, thereby increasing accuracy.  A typical assortment may be seen in the picture of a tournament in West Germany, at the head of this article.{{update after|2011|04|04}}&lt;!-- this sort of prose may quickly become outdated by later edits in other parts of the article --&gt; Note that if the shooting technique of the archer were perfect, then, with everything else remaining constant, no stabilisers would be required.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} It is the inconsistences{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} of the archer that stabilisers can help to reduce.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  All bodies have inertia, and it is static inertia that bow-weights &quot;use&quot;, which means that they resist movement. Consequently, on the application of any force on the bow, e.g. 1) muscular force, whether voluntary or involuntary: 2) the reaction of the bow to the acceleration of the bow limbs, string and arrow: 3) the further reaction of the bow as the string becomes taut and the arrow flies free: the actual physical movement of the bow centre section will be less with the addition of weights than it would have been without.  Clearly, the forces acting on the centre section are potentially the same on any shot, and by increasing the static inertia, movement will be reduced. Accuracy comes from repeatability. The reduction of inadvertent movements enhances repeatability. The various types of stabilisers are each designed to minimise a particular direction of movement.  It should be noted that these &quot;movements&quot; are those that may occur between the instant of true aim/string release, and the arrow flying free: not &quot;follow-through&quot; and similar activities, these merely indicate what went before. All weight added to the centre section will reduce trembling or shake during the aim, but energy to hold the bow against gravity will obviously increase. Also, the addition of weight will change the shooting characteristics and matching of the arrows to the bow. The successful addition of stabilisers can only be achieved by actual testing and accuracy grouping.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison S. ''Controlling Bow Behaviour with Stabilisers'' 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

====Long-Rod or Poker Stabiliser====

Usually fitted into the centre section in-line with the bow arm, or just below the hand position. The addition of this weight projects the centre of gravity (C of G) of the bow forwards, with the result that, firstly, &quot;torque&quot; effect (sideways twisting of the bow-hand) movement is reduced. Since, at full draw, the bow cannot twist, as the string is (in theory) preventing such action, the  effect is only apparent on string release. Hence, the bow centre section turns to some degree on release, the arrow being directed to either the left or right.&lt;ref&gt;Elmer R.P. Target Archery 1952&lt;/ref&gt; But, with the forward C of G, the effect is reduced.  Similarly, &quot;topping&quot; (upwards) or &quot;heeling&quot; (downwards) inconsistences of the bow-hand are reduced.  Secondly, with actual movement of the bow-hand sideways, up, down, or any combination, because the C of G is in front of the hand, the bow will turn in the opposite direction, to correct, to some degree, the archer's error. Further, an effect that does not actually give enhanced accuracy, except in the mind of the archer, is the pleasing &quot;forward roll&quot; of the bow, as part of the follow-through, with a relaxed bow-hand and forward C of G.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

====Twin or Limb Stabilisers====

Fitted above and below the bow-hand, normally close to where the limbs meet the centre section, these have  similar effects to the single long-rod, but also have a third effect. Because of their positioning, the twin weights also resist rotation instigated by a bow-hand error. If this error were not reduced, left or right shots would occur, because the aiming of the arrow takes gravity into account to gauge the trajectory.  Consequently, with perfect aim, if the bow rotates on release, the effect will be the same as not holding the bow vertically, i.e.left or right.  Similarly to the long-rod, a &quot;forward roll&quot; will be induced on release and, in addition, because the twin stabilisers are positioned at the base of the limbs, depending on the rigidity of the mounts, some vibration may be damped, giving a smoother feel to the shot.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

====Reverse or Counterbalance Stabilisers====

Fitted usually below the bow-hand on the centre section, because they point back towards the archer, they bring the C of G backwards. Consequently, they are typically used in conjunction with a long-rod stabiliser, the long-rod having sufficient turning moment to exceed the negative effect of the reverse weights, and so keep the forward roll of the bow on release, this being generally accepted as a desirable feature. Hence, the forward C of G effect will not be as great, but, because the reverse weight or weights are extended horizontally from the vertical centre section, their effect is to reduce vertical turning caused by bow-hand torque. This is, of course, in addition to any long-rod stabiliser anti-torque effect.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

====Use and Summary====

Consider the bow as being potentially on a pivot at the pressure point of the bow-hand. If the archer applies inadvertent pressure off centre of the pressure point, then inadvertent movement of the bow will result, with loss of accuracy. By careful study of the bow's movement, the appropriate positioning and addition of weight(s) may be tried, to reduce errors, although prevention is better than cure.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Further, various types of mount have been used, to allow some degree of flexure between the bow and the stabiliser weight. Similarly, the weight may be on an extension rod that may flex in itself.  The object of the exercise should be kept in mind, and that object is to reduce bow inadvertent movement. Any flexure will allow some movement of the bow, without similar movement of the weight, hence lessening the weight inertia. However, many archers have found an apparent improvement in their accuracy with the use of flex / mounts. The weight in hand remains unchanged, and so may contribute to steadyness of aim. Also, the flexing gives a &quot;rubbery&quot; feeling, as though the bow wants to remain steady on aim. Consequently, it may be that such effect helps the archer's feeling of confidence on the shot, thereby contributing to accuracy.

==Shooting technique and form==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
The bow is held in the hand opposite to the archer's [[eye dominance|dominant eye]], though holding the bow in the dominant hand side is advocated by some. This hand is referred to as the '''bow hand''' and its arm the '''bow arm'''. The opposite hand is called the '''drawing hand''' or '''string hand'''. Terms such as '''bow shoulder''' or '''string elbow''' follow the same convention. Right-eye-dominant archers hold the bow with their left hand, have their left side facing the target, sight towards the target with their right eye and handle the arrow and string with their right hand.

===Modern form===
To shoot an arrow, an archer first assumes the correct stance. The body should be perpendicular to the target and the shooting line, with the feet placed shoulder-width apart. As an archer progresses from beginner to a more advanced level an &quot;open stance&quot; is used/developed. Each archer will have a particular preference but mostly this term indicates that the leg furthest from the shooting line will be a half to a whole foot-length in front of the other, on the ground.

To load, the bow is pointed toward the ground and the shaft of the arrow is placed on an arrow rest which is attached in the bow window. The back of the arrow is attached to the bowstring with the '''nock''' (a small plastic component which is typified by a &quot;v&quot; groove for this purpose). This is called &quot;nocking the arrow&quot;. As said above, typical arrows with three vanes should be oriented such that a single vane, the &quot;cock feather&quot; is pointing away from the bow.

The bowstring and arrow are held with three fingers. When using a sight, the index finger is placed above the arrow and the next two fingers below.  ''Instinctive'' shooting is a technique eschewing sights and is often preferred by traditional archers (shooters of longbows and recurves). In either case the string is usually placed in either the first or second joint of the fingers.

The bow is then raised and drawn. This is often one fluid motion which tends to vary from archer to archer. The string hand is drawn towards the face, where it should rest lightly at an ''anchor point''. This point is consistent from shot to shot and is usually at the corner of the mouth or on the chin. The bow arm is held outwards toward the target. The elbow of this arm should be rotated so that the inner elbow is perpendicular to the ground, though archers with hyper extendable elbows tend to angle the inner elbow toward the ground as exemplified by the Korean archer [[Jang Yong-Ho]].

In proper form, the archer stands erect, forming a &quot;T&quot;. The archer's lower [[trapezius muscle]]s are used to pull the arrow to the anchor point. Some bows will be equipped with a mechanical device, called a clicker, which produces a clicking sound when the archer reaches the correct draw length.

The arrow is typically released by relaxing the fingers of the drawing hand (see [[Bow draw]]). Usually this type of release aims to keep the drawing arm rigid and move it back using the back muscles, as opposed to using arm motion. An archer should also pay attention to the recoil or ''follow through'' of his or her body, as it may indicate problems with form (technique).

==Aiming methods==
{{Refimprove|date=March 2011}}
There are two main forms of aiming in archery: using a mechanical or fixed sight or barebow. Barebow aiming methods include Gap, Split Vision, Point of Aim, String Walking, Face Walking and Instinctive Aiming.

Mechanical sights can be affixed to the bow to aid in aiming. They can be as simple as a pin or optical with magnification. They usually also have a peep sight (rear sight) built into the string which aids in a consistent anchor point. Modern compound bows automatically limit the draw length which gives a consistent arrow velocity while traditional bows allow great variation in draw length. Mechanical methods to make a traditional bow's draw length consistent are sometimes used. Instinctive archers use a sight picture which includes the target, the bow, the hand, the arrow shaft and the arrow tip, as seen at the same time by the archer. With a fixed &quot;anchor point&quot; (where the string is brought to, or close to, the face), and a fully extended bow arm, successive shots taken with the sight picture in the same position will fall on the same [[Predicted impact point|point]]. This allows the archer to adjust aim with successive shots in order to achieve accuracy. A fixed anchor point cannot be used with short bows, which by definition do not allow a full draw. Modern archery equipment usually includes [[Sight (device)|sights]]. Instinctive aiming is used by many archers who use traditional bows.  The two most common forms of a non-mechanical release are split-finger and three-under.  Split-finger aiming requires the archer to place the index finger above the nocked arrow, while the middle and ring fingers are both placed below.  Three-under aiming places the index, middle, and ring fingers under the nocked arrow.  This technique allows the archer to better look down the arrow since the back of the arrow is closer to the dominant eye, and is commonly called &quot;gun barreling&quot; (referring to common aiming techniques used with firearms).

When using shortbows, or shooting from horseback, it is difficult to use the sight picture. The archer may look at the target but without including the weapon in the field of accurate view. Aiming involves a similar sort of hand/eye coordination which includes proprioception and motor/muscle memory between the mind/body connection that is used when throwing a baseball or shooting a basketball. With sufficient practice, such archers can normally achieve good practical accuracy for hunting or for war.&lt;ref name=&quot;lehman&quot;&gt;{{citation

Currently '''Instinctive shooting''' is a term used to describe a style of shooting that includes the barebow aiming method that relies heavily upon the subconscious mind, proprioception and motor/muscle memory to make aiming adjustments while years ago the term was used to generalize and/or categorize those archers who did not use a mechanical or fixed sight.&lt;ref name=&quot;bear&quot;&gt;{{citation

== Physics ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}

When a projectile is thrown by hand, the speed of the projectile is determined by the [[kinetic energy]] imparted by the thrower's [[muscle]]s performing [[Work (physics)|work]].  However, the energy must be imparted over a limited distance (determined by arm length) and therefore (because the projectile is accelerating) over a limited time, so the limiting factor is not work but rather [[Power (physics)|power]], which determined how much energy can be added in the limited time available.  Power generated by muscles, however, is limited by [[Muscle_contraction#Force-length_and_Force-velocity_relationships|Force-velocity relationship]], and even at the optimal contraction speed for power production, total work done by the muscle will be less than half of what could be done if the muscle were contracting over the same distance at very slow speeds, resulting in less than 1/4 the projectile launch velocity possible without the limitations of the [[Muscle_contraction#Force-length_and_Force-velocity_relationships|Force-velocity relationship]].

When a bow is used, the muscles are able perform work much more slowly, resulting in greater force and greater work done.  This work is stored in the bow as [[elastic potential energy]], and when the bowstring is released, this stored energy is imparted to the arrow much more quickly than can be delivered by the muscles, resulting in much higher velocity and, hence, greater distance.  This same process is employed by [[frog]]s which use elastic tendons to increase jumping distance.  In archery, some energy is dissipated through [[Hysteresis#Elastic hysteresis|elastic hysteresis]], reducing the overall amount released when the bow is shot. Of the energy remaining, some is dampened both by the limbs of the bow and the bowstring.  Depending on the elasticity of the arrow, some of the energy is also absorbed by compressing the arrow, primarily because the release of the bowstring is rarely in line with the arrow shaft, causing it to 'flex out' to one side. This is because the bowstring accelerates faster than the archer's fingers can open, and consequently some sideways motion is imparted to the string, and hence arrow nock, as the power and speed of the bow pulls the string off the opening fingers. Even with a release aid mechanism some of this effect will usually be experienced, since the string always accelerates faster than the retaining part of the mechanism.  This results in an in-flight oscillation of the arrow in which its center flexes out to one side and then the other repeatedly, gradually reducing as the arrow's flight proceeds; this can be clearly seen in high-speed photography of an arrow at discharge. Modern arrows are made to a specified 'spine', or stiffness rating, to maintain matched flexing and hence accuracy of aim. This flexing can be a desirable feature, since, when the spine of the shaft is matched to the acceleration of the bow(string), the arrow bends or flexes around the bow and any arrow-rest, and consequently the arrow, and fletchings, have an un-impeded flight. This feature is known as the [[archer's paradox]]. It maintains accuracy, for if part of the arrow struck a glancing blow on discharge, some inconsistency would be present, and the excellent accuracy of modern equipment would not be achieved.

The accurate flight of an arrow is dependent on its fletching.  The arrow's manufacturer (a &quot;fletcher&quot;) can arrange fletching to cause the arrow to rotate along its axis.  This improves accuracy by evening pressure buildups that would otherwise cause the arrow to &quot;plane&quot; on the air in a random direction after shooting. Even though the arrow be made with extreme care, the slightest imperfection, or air movement, will cause some unbalanced turbulence in air flow. Consequently, rotation creates an equalling of such turbulence, which, overall, maintains the intended direction of flight i.e. accuracy. This rotation is not to be confused with the rapid gyroscopic rotation of a rifle bullet. If the fletching is not arranged to induce rotation, it will still improve accuracy by causing a restoring drag any time the arrow tilts away from its intended direction of travel.

The innovative aspect of the invention of the bow and arrow was the amount of power delivered to an extremely small area by the arrow. The huge ratio of length vs cross sectional area coupled with velocity made the arrow orders of magnitude more powerful than any other hand held weapon until firearms were invented. Arrows may be designed to spread or concentrate force, depending on their applications.  Practice arrows, for instance, can use a blunt tip that spreads the force over a wider area to reduce the risk of injury or limit penetration.  Arrows designed to pierce armor in the Middle Ages would use a very narrow and sharp tip (&quot;bodkinhead&quot;) to concentrate the force.  Arrows used for hunting would use a narrow tip (&quot;broadhead&quot;) that widens further, to facilitate both penetration and a large wound.

==Hunting==
{{main|bowhunting}}

Using archery to take game animals is known as '''bowhunting'''. Bowhunting differs markedly from hunting with firearms as the distances between the hunter and the game are much shorter in order to ensure a humane kill. The skills and practices of bowhunting therefore emphasize very close approach to the prey, whether by still hunting, stalking, or waiting in a blind or treestand. In many countries, including much of the United States, bowhunting for large and small game is legal. Bowhunters generally enjoy longer seasons than are allowed with other forms of hunting such as black powder, shotgun, or rifle. Usually, compound bows are used for large game hunting and may feature fiber optic sights and other enhancements. Using a bow and arrow to take fish is known as '''[[bowfishing]]'''.

==Modern competitive archery==
{{main|Modern competitive archery}}

Competitive archery involves shooting arrows at a target for accuracy from a set distance or distances. This is the most popular form of competitive archery worldwide and is called [[target archery]]. A form particularly popular in Europe and [[Americas|America]] is [[field archery]], shot at targets generally set at various distances in a wooded setting. Para-Archery is an adaptation of archery for athletes with a disability. It is governed by the [[International Archery Federation]] (FITA), and is one of the sports in the Summer [[Paralympic Games]]. There are also several other lesser-known and historical forms of archery, as well as archery novelty games.

'''Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto''' (February 3, 1898, [[Kuortane]] – May 11, 1976, [[Helsinki]]) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[architect]] and [[designer]]. His work includes [[architecture]], [[furniture]], [[textiles]] and [[glassware]]. Aalto's early career runs in parallel with the rapid economic growth and industrialization of Finland during the first half of the twentieth century and many of his clients were industrialists; among these were the [[Ahlström-Gullichsen family]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahlström&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://architect.architecture.sk/alvar-aalto-architect/alvar-aalto-architect.php Architecture.sk].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The span of his career, from the 1920s to the 1970s, is reflected in the styles of his work, ranging from [[Nordic Classicism]] of the early work, to a rational [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] Modernism during the 1930s to a more organic modernist style from the 1940s onwards. What is typical for his entire career, however, is a concern for design as a [[Gesamtkunstwerk]], a ''total work of art''; whereby he - together with his first wife [[Aino Aalto]] - would design not just the building, but give special treatments to the interior surfaces and design furniture, lamps, and furnishings and glassware. The Alvar Aalto Museum, designed by Aalto himself, is located in what is regarded as his home city [[Jyväskylä]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alvaraalto.fi/ Alvaraalto.fi]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:VIPlibrary.jpg|thumb|Auditorium of the Viipuri Municipal Library in the 1930s.]]

Alvar Aalto was born in [[Kuortane]], [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Johan Henrik Aalto, was a Finnish-speaking land-surveyor and his mother, Selly (Selma) Matilda (née Hackstedt) was a postmistress. When Aalto was 5 years old, the family moved to [[Alajärvi]], and from there to [[Jyväskylä]] in [[Central Finland]]. Aalto studied at the Jyväskylä Lyceum school, completing his basic education in 1916. In 1916 he then enrolled to study architecture at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]], graduating in 1921. 

In 1923 he returned to [[Jyväskylä]], where he opened his first architectural office. Jyväskylä would become a notable city for his architecture, with more buildings designed by him than in any other city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoa.fi/lansisuomi/showinfo.php?county=29 Infoa.fi]&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he married architect [[Aino Aalto|Aino Marsio]]. Their honeymoon journey to [[Italy]] sealed an intellectual bond with the culture of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] region that was to remain important to Aalto for the rest of his life. The Aaltos moved their office to [[Turku]] in 1927, and started collaborating with architect [[Erik Bryggman]]. The office moved again in 1933 to Helsinki. 

The Aaltos designed and built a joint house-office (1935–36) for themselves in [[Munkkiniemi]], Helsinki, but later (1954–56) had a purpose-built office built in the same neighbourhood  - the latter building nowadays houses the Alvar Aalto Academy. Aino and Alvar Aalto had 2 children, a daughter Johanna &quot;Hanni&quot; Alanen, born Aalto, 1925, and a son Hamilkar Aalto, 1928. In 1926 the young Aaltos designed and had built a summer cottage in Alajärvi, Villa Flora. Aino Aalto died of cancer in 1949. In 1952 Aalto married architect [[Elissa Mäkiniemi]] (died 1994), who had been working as an assistant in his office. In 1952 Aalto designed and had built a summer cottage, the so-called Experimental House, for himself and his new wife in Muuratsalo in Central Finland. Alvar Aalto died on May 11, 1976, in [[Helsinki]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9003202 Aalto, Alvar].&quot; ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. 17 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he is sometimes regarded as among the first and most influential architects of Nordic [[modernism]], a closer examination of the historical facts reveals that Aalto (while a pioneer in Finland) closely followed and had personal contacts with other pioneers in Sweden, in particular [[Gunnar Asplund]] and [[Sven Markelius]]. What they and many others of that generation in the Nordic countries had in common was that they started off from a classical education and were first designing in the so-called [[Nordic Classicism]] style – a style that had been a reaction to the previous dominant style of [[National romantic style|National Romanticism]]– before moving, in the late 1920s, towards Modernism. On returning to Jyväskylä in 1923 to establish his own architect's office, Aalto busied himself with a number of single-family homes, all designed in the classical style, such as the manor-like house for his mother's cousin Terho Manner in Töysa in 1923, a summer villa for the Jyväskylä chief constable in 1923 and the Alatalo farmhouse in Tarvaala in 1924. During this period he also completed his first public buildings, the Jyväskylä Workers' Club in 1925, the Jyväskylä Defence Corps building in 1926 and the Seinajoki Defence Corp building in 1924-29. Aalto also entered several architectural competitions for prestigious state public buildings, both in Finland and abroad, including the two competitions for the Finnish Parliamentary building in 1923 and 1924, the extension to the [[University of Helsinki]] in 1931, and the building to house the [[League of Nations]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, in 1926-27. Furthermore, this was the period when Aalto was most prolific in his writings, with articles for professional journals and newspapers. Among his most well-known essays from this period are &quot;Urban culture&quot; 1924), &quot;Temple baths on Jyväskylä ridge&quot; (1925), &quot;Abbé Coignard's sermon&quot; (1925), and &quot;From doorstep to living room&quot; (1926).&lt;ref&gt;Alvar Aalto in his own words, edited by Göran Schildt, Otava, Helsinki, 1997. ISBN 951-1-1-15065-0&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Early career: functionalism'''

The shift in Aalto's design approach from classicism to modernism is epitomised by the [[Vyborg Library|Viipuri Library]] (1927–35), which went through a transformation from an originally classical competition entry proposal to the completed high-modernist building. Yet his humanistic approach is in full evidence in the library: the interior displays natural materials, warm colours, and undulating lines. Due to problems over financing and a change of site, the Viipuri Library project lasted eight years, and during that same time he also designed the Turun Sanomat Building (1929–30) and Paimio Sanatorium (1929–33). Thus, the Turun Sanomat Building first heralded Aalto's move towards modernism, and this was then carried forward both in the Paimio Sanatorium and in the on-going design for the library. Although the Turun Sanomat Building and Paimio Sanatorium are comparatively pure modernist works, they too carried the seeds of his questioning of such an orthodox modernist approach and a move to a more daring, synthetic attitude. 

Through Sven Markelius, Aalto became a member of the [[Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM), attending the second congress in Frankfurt in 1929 and the fourth congress in Athens in 1933, where he established a close friendship with [[László Moholy-Nagy]], [[Sigfried Giedion]] and [[Philip Morton Shand]]. It was during this time that he followed closely the work of the main driving force behind the new modernism, [[Le Corbusier]], and visited him in his Paris office several times in the following years. 

It was not until the completion of the Paimio Sanatorium (1929) and Viipuri Library (1935) that Aalto first achieved world attention in architecture. His reputation grew in the USA following the critical reception of his design for the Finnish Pavilion at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], described by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] as a &quot;work of genius&quot;. It could be said that Aalto's international reputation was sealed with his inclusion in the second edition of Sigfried Giedion's influential book on Modernist architecture, ''Space, Time and Architecture: The growth of a new tradition'' (1949), in which Aalto received more attention than any other Modernist architect, including [[Le Corbusier]]. In his analysis of Aalto, Giedion gave primacy to qualities that depart from direct functionality, such as mood, atmosphere, intensity of life and even national characteristics, declaring that &quot;Finland is with Aalto wherever he goes&quot;.

*'''Mid career: experimentation'''

Aalto's early experiments with wood and his move away from a purist modernism would be tested in built form with the commission to design Villa Mairea (1939) in [[Noormarkku]], the luxury home of the young industrialist couple Harry and Maire Gullichsen. It was Maire Gullichsen who acted as the main client, and she worked closely not only with Alvar but also Aino Aalto on the design, inspiring them to be more daring in their work. The original design was to include a private art gallery, but this was never built. The building forms a U-shape around a central inner &quot;garden&quot; the central feature of which is a kidney-shaped swimming pool. Adjacent to the pool is a sauna executed in a rustic style, alluding to both Finnish and Japanese precedents. The design of the house is a synthesis of numerous stylistic influences, from traditional Finnish vernacular to purist modernism, as well as influences from English and Japanese architecture. While the house is clearly intended for a wealthy family, Aalto nevertheless argued that it was also an experiment that would prove useful in the design of mass housing.&lt;ref&gt;Juhani Pallasmaa, Villa Mairea, Rakennustieto Publishing, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

His increased fame led to offers and commissions outside Finland. In 1941 he accepted an invitation as a visiting professor to [[MIT]], in the USA. This was during the [[World War II|Second World War]], and he involved his students in designing low-cost, small-scale housing for the reconstruction of war-torn Finland. While teaching at MIT, Aalto also designed the student dormitory, [[List of MIT undergraduate dormitories#Baker House|Baker House]], completed in 1948. This building was the first building of Aalto's redbrick period. Originally used in Baker House to signify the Ivy League university tradition, on his return to Finland Aalto used it in a number of key buildings, in particular, in several of the buildings in the new [[Helsinki University of Technology]] campus (starting in 1950), Säynatsalo Town Hall (1952), Helsinki Pensions Institute (1954), Helsinki House of Culture (1958), as well as in his own summer house, the so-called Experimental House in Muuratsalo (1957).

*'''Mature career: monumentalism'''

The early 1960s and 1970s (up until his death in 1976) were marked by key works in Helsinki, in particular the huge town plan for the void in centre of Helsinki adjacent to [[Töölö]] Bay and the vast [[VR warehouses|railway yards]], and marked on the edges by significant buildings such as the National Museum and the main railway station, both by [[Eliel Saarinen]]. In his town plan Aalto proposed a line of separate marble-clad buildings fronting the bay which would house various cultural institutions, including a concert hall, opera, museum of architecture and headquarters for the [[Finnish Academy]]. The scheme also extended into the [[Kamppi]] district with a series of tall office blocks. Aalto first presented his scheme in 1961, but it went through various modifications during the early 1960s. Only two fragments of the overall plan were ever realized: the [[Finlandia Hall]] concert hall (1976) fronting Töölö Bay, and an office building in the Kamppi district for the Helsinki Electricity Company (1975). The [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Miesian]] formal language of geometric grids employed in the buildings was also used by Aalto for other sites in Helsinki, including the [[Stora Enso|Enso-Gutzeit]] building (1962), the [[Stockmann|Academic Bookstore]] (1962) and the SYP Bank building (1969). 

Following Aalto's death in 1976 his office continued to operate under the direction of his widow, Elissa, completing works already to some extent designed. These works include the Jyväskylä City Theatre and Essen Opera House. Since the death of Elissa Aalto the office has continued to operate as the Alvar Aalto Academy, giving advice on the restoration of Aalto buildings and organising the vast archive material.

== Awards ==
Aalto's awards included the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture from the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (1957) and the [[AIA Gold Medal|Gold Medal]] from the [[American Institute of Architects]] (1963). He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Aalto's career spans the changes in style from ([[Nordic Classicism]]) to purist [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] Modernism to a more personal, synthetic and idiosyncratic Modernism. Aalto's wide field of design activity ranges from the large scale of [[city planning]] and [[architecture]] to [[interior design]], [[furniture]] and [[glassware]] design and [[painting]]. It has been estimated that during his entire career Aalto designed over 500 individual buildings, approximately 300 of which were built, the vast majority of which are in Finland. He also has a few buildings in the USA, Germany, Italy, and France.&lt;ref&gt;Göran Schildt, Alvar Aalto. A life's work: Architecture, Design and Art. Otava, Helsinki, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; 

Aalto claimed that his paintings were not made as individual artworks but as part of his process of architectural design, and many of his small-scale &quot;sculptural&quot; experiments with wood led to later larger architectural details and forms. These experiments also led to a number of patents: for example, he invented a new form of laminated bent-plywood furniture in 1932. His experimental method had been influenced by his meetings with various members of the [[Bauhaus]] design school, especially [[László Moholy-Nagy]], whom he first met in 1930. Aalto's furniture was exhibited in London in 1935, to great critical acclaim, and to cope with the consumer demand Aalto, together with his wife Aino, [[Ahlström — Gullichsen family|Maire Gullichsen]] and Nils-Gustav Hahl founded the company [[Artek (company)|Artek]] that same year. Aalto glassware (Aino as well as Alvar) is manufactured by [[Iittala]].

This is one of a series of articles about the differences between '''[[American English]]''' and '''[[British English]]''', which, ''for the purposes of these articles'', are defined as follows:

{{American and British English differences}}

*'''American English''' (AmE) is the form of English used in the United States. It includes all English [[dialect]]s used within the United States.
*'''British English''' (BrE) is the form of English used in the United Kingdom. It includes all English dialects used within the United Kingdom.

Written forms of American and British English as found in newspapers and textbooks vary little in their essential features, with only occasional noticeable differences in comparable media&lt;ref&gt;Even in vocabulary. &quot;A British reader of ''Time'' or ''Newsweek'' would note distinctly American expressions only a few times on any page, matching the few distinctly British expressions an American reader of ''The Economist'' would note.&quot;

Edward Finegan in ''Language in the USA: Themes for the Twenty-first Century''. Eds Charles Albert Ferguson, Edward Finegan, Shirley Brice Heath, John R. Rickford (Cambridge University Press, 2004).pp29.
See also Crystal, ''The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of The English Language'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp304.&lt;/ref&gt; (comparing American newspapers with British newspapers, for example). This kind of formal English, particularly written English, is often called 'standard English'.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Standard English is essentially written, printed English, seen in the textbooks, newspapers, and periodicals of the world – and also, these days on the WWW. It is largely identical in its global manifestation; we must allow only for the small amount of variation in vocab, grammar and spelling which make up the differences between Am, Br, Aus and other 'regional' standards.&quot;

David Crystal, [http://www.davidcrystal.com/David_Crystal/articles.htm &quot;The Past Present and Future of World English&quot;] in Andreas Gardt, Bernd-Rüdiger Hüppauf, Bernd Huppauf (eds) ''Globalization and the future of German'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2004). pp39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NB: 'standard English' as used to describe written ''and'' spoken international English is a more contentious usage.
:&quot;standard English: In Sociolinguistics, a much debated term for the VARIETY of English used as a communicative norm throughout the English-speaking world. The notion has become increasingly difficult to handle because of the emergence of differing national standards of usage (in vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation and spelling) in areas where large numbers of people speak English as a first or second language.&quot; [sic]

The spoken forms of British English vary considerably, reflecting a long history of dialect development amid isolated populations. Dialects and accents vary not only among the countries in the United Kingdom, [[English English|England]], [[Mid-Ulster English|Northern Ireland]], [[Scottish English|Scotland]] and [[Welsh English|Wales]], but also within these individual countries.

There are also differences in the English spoken by different groups of people in any particular region. [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP) has traditionally been regarded as proper English; this is also referred to as &quot;BBC English&quot; or &quot;the Queen's English&quot;. The BBC and other [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]] now intentionally use a mix of presenters with a variety of British accents and dialects, and the concept of &quot;proper English&quot; is now far less prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

An unofficial standard for ''spoken'' American English has also developed, as a result of mass media and geographic and [[social mobility]], and broadly describes the English typically heard from network [[newscasters]], commonly referred to as non-regional [[diction]], although local newscasters tend toward more [[Parochialism|parochial]] forms of speech. [http://dare.wisc.edu/] Despite this unofficial standard, regional variations of American English have not only persisted but have actually intensified, according to linguist [[William Labov]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Regional dialects in the United States typically reflect the elements of the language of the main immigrant groups in any particular region of the country, especially in terms of pronunciation and [[vernacular]] vocabulary. Scholars have mapped at least four major regional variations of spoken American English: Northern, Southern, [[Midland American English|Midland]], and Western.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William; Sharon Ash; &amp; Charles Boberg. (2006). Atlas of North American English: Phonetics, Phonology and Sound Change. Berlin/New York: Mouton de Gruyter. ISBN 311-016746-8.
Compare with Labov, Ash, &amp; Boberg. (1997). ''A national map of the regional dialects of American English.'' Linguistics Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania. [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/NationalMap/NationalMap.html]. Retrieved 16 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[American Civil War]], the settlement of the western territories by migrants from the east led to dialect mixing and levelling, so that regional dialects are most strongly differentiated in the eastern parts of the country that were settled earlier. Localized dialects also exist with quite distinct variations, such as in Southern Appalachia and New York.

British and American English are the reference norms for English as spoken, written, and taught in the rest of the world. For instance the English-speaking members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] often closely follow British English forms while many new American English forms quickly become familiar outside of the United States. Although most dialects of English used in the former [[British Empire]] outside of North America are, to various extents, based on British English, most of the countries concerned have developed their own unique dialects, particularly with respect to pronunciation, [[idioms]] and vocabulary. Chief among other English dialects are [[Canadian English]], based on the English of [[United Empire Loyalist]]s who left the [[13 Colonies]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=ia5tHVtQPn8C&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=%22northern+american+english%22&amp;ei=gbfRSJuAFYTMigGCvf3mAw&amp;sig=ACfU3U1zW5pEVVvZbHNqbbpBiFsnsgR4jA#PPA422,M1 Canadian English].&quot; Brinton, Laurel J., and Fee, Marjery, ed. (2005). Ch. 12. in ''The Cambridge history of the English language. Volume VI: English in North America.'', Algeo, John, ed., pp. 422–440. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1992.
ISBN 0-521-26479-0, 9780521264792. On p. 422: &quot;It is now generally agreed that Canadian English originated as a variant of northern American English (the speech of New England, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Australian English]], which rank third and fourth in [[Geographical distribution of english|number of ''native'' speakers]].&lt;ref&gt;

For the most part American vocabulary, phonology and syntax are used, to various extents, in Canada; therefore many prefer to refer to ''[[North American English]]'' rather than American English (Trudgill and Hannah, 2002). Nonetheless Canadian English also features many British English items and is often described as a unique blend of the two main varieties.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Indian English]] has actually more English-language speakers than the total of North American, British, Australian and New Zealand combined (Crystal, 2005). [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/ling/stories/s1298284.htm]  Indian English speakers typically are learning multiple first languages within an English-as-a-foreign-language context, which has a decided impact on the phonological structure of Indian English.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
The [[English language]] was first introduced to the [[Americas]] by [[British colonisation of the Americas|British colonization]], beginning in 1607 in [[Jamestown, Virginia]]. Similarly, the language spread to numerous other parts of the world as a result of British trade and colonization elsewhere and the spread of the former [[British Empire]], which, by 1921, held sway over a population of 470–570 million people, approximately a quarter of the world's population at that time.

Over the past 400 years the form of the language used in the [[Americas]] — especially in the [[United States]] — and that used in the United Kingdom have diverged in a few minor ways, leading to the [[dialect]]s now occasionally referred to as American English and British English. Differences between the two include [[pronunciation]], [[grammar]], [[Lexis (linguistics)|vocabulary (lexis)]], [[spelling]], [[punctuation]], [[idiom]]s, formatting of [[calendar date|date]]s and [[number]]s, although the differences in written and most spoken grammar structure tend to be much less than those of other aspects of the language in terms of mutual intelligibility. A small number of words have completely different meanings in the two dialects or are even unknown or not used in one of the dialects. One particular contribution towards formalizing these differences came from [[Noah Webster]], who wrote the [[Webster's Dictionary|first American dictionary]] (published 1828) with the intention of showing that people in the United States spoke a different dialect from Britain, much like a regional accent.

This divergence between American English and British English once caused [[George Bernard Shaw]] to say that the United States and United Kingdom are &quot;two countries divided by a common language&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Krueger CL, Stade G, Karbiener K, Encyclopedia of British Writers: 19th and 20th Centuries  Book Builders LLC   Infobase Publishing ISBN 0816046700, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; a similar comment is ascribed to [[Winston Churchill]]. Likewise, [[Oscar Wilde]] wrote, &quot;We have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, the language&quot; (''[[The Canterville Ghost]]'', 1888). [[Henry Sweet]] incorrectly predicted in 1877 that within a century American English, Australian English and British English would be mutually unintelligible. It may be the case that increased worldwide communication through radio, television, the Internet and [[globalization]] has reduced the tendency to regional variation. This can result either in some variations becoming extinct (for instance, ''the wireless'', superseded by ''the radio'') or in the acceptance of wide variations as &quot;perfectly good English&quot; everywhere. Often at the core of the dialect though, the idiosyncrasies remain.

Nevertheless it remains the case that, although spoken American and British English are generally mutually intelligible, there are enough differences to cause occasional misunderstandings or at times embarrassment&amp;nbsp;– for example some words that are quite innocent in one dialect may be considered vulgar in the other.

==Grammar==
===Nouns===
====Formal and notional agreement====
In BrE, [[English collective nouns|collective nouns]] can take either singular (''[[formal agreement]]'') or plural (''[[notional agreement]]'') verb forms, according to whether the emphasis is on the body as a whole or on the individual members respectively; compare ''a committee was appointed'' with ''the committee were unable to agree''.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learnenglish.org.uk/grammar/archive/collective_nouns.html learnenglish.org.uk]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''the Government'' always takes a plural verb in British civil service convention, perhaps to emphasise the principle of collective responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;''Instructions to Secretaries of Committees'', Cabinet Office, nd&lt;/ref&gt; Compare also the following lines of [[Elvis Costello]]'s song &quot;Oliver's Army&quot;: ''Oliver's Army are on their way / Oliver's Army is here to stay''. Some of these nouns, for example ''staff'',&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; actually combine with plural verbs most of the time.

In AmE collective nouns are usually singular in construction: ''the committee was unable to agree''. AmE may use plural pronouns, however, in agreement with collective nouns: ''the team take their seats'', rather than ''the team takes its seats''. The rule of thumb is that a group acting as a unit is considered singular and a group of &quot;individuals acting separately&quot; is considered plural.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, James A. ''Grammar and Composition IV''. 3d ed. Pensacola: A Beka Book, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However such a sentence would most likely be recast as ''the team members take their seats''. Despite exceptions such as usage in the ''New York Times'', the names of sports teams are usually treated as plurals even if the form of the name is singular.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The names of sports teams, on the other hand, are treated as plurals, regardless of the form of that name.&quot;[http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/plurals.htm#sports]&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference occurs for all nouns of multitude, both general terms such as ''team'' and ''company'' and proper nouns (for example where a place name is used to refer to a sports team). For instance,

BrE: ''[[The Clash]] are a well-known band''; AmE: ''The Clash is a well-known band''.
&lt;br /&gt;BrE: ''Spain are the champions''; AmE: ''Spain is the champion''.

Proper nouns that are plural in form take a plural verb in both AmE and BrE; for example, ''[[The Beatles]] are a well-known band''; ''The Saints are the champions'', with one major exception: largely for historical reasons, in American English, the ''United States is'' is almost universal.

===Verbs===
====Verb morphology====
{{See also|English irregular verbs}}

* The past tense and past participle of the verbs ''learn'', ''spoil'', ''spell'', ''burn'', ''dream'', ''smell'', ''spill'', ''leap'', and others, can be either irregular (''learnt'', ''spoilt'', etc.) or regular (''learned'', ''spoiled'', etc.). In BrE, both irregular and regular forms are current, but for some words (such as ''smelt'' and ''leapt'') there is a strong tendency towards the irregular forms, especially by users of [[Received Pronunciation]]. For other words (such as ''dreamed'', ''leaned'', and ''learned''&lt;ref&gt;Peters, pp. 165 and 316.&lt;/ref&gt;) the regular forms are somewhat more common. In most accents of AmE, the irregular forms are never or rarely used (except for ''burnt'', ''leapt'' and ''dreamt'').&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, pp. 15ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ''t'' endings may be encountered frequently in older American texts. Usage may vary when the past participles are used as adjectives, as in ''burnt toast''.  (The two-syllable form ''learnèd'' {{IPA|/ˈlɜrnɪd/}}, usually written without the [[Grave accent|grave]], is used as an adjective to mean &quot;educated&quot; or to refer to academic institutions in both BrE and AmE.) Finally, the past tense and past participle of ''dwell'' and ''kneel'' are more commonly ''dwelt'' and ''knelt'' in both standards, with ''dwelled'' and ''kneeled'' as common variants in the US but not in the UK.
* ''Lit'' as the past tense of ''light'' is more common than ''lighted'' in the UK; the regular form is used more in the US but is nonetheless less common than ''lit''.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, ''fit'' as the past tense of ''fit'' is more widely used in AmE than BrE, which generally favours ''fitted''.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--The facts: there's no big difference in usage for &quot;forecasted&quot; or &quot;wedded&quot;; I have to check &quot;knit(ted)&quot; yet. What about broadcast(ed) instead?--&gt;
* The past tense of ''spit'' &quot;expectorate&quot; is ''spat'' in BrE, ''spit'' or ''spat'' in AmE.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 512&lt;/ref&gt; AmE typically has ''spat'' in figurative contexts, for example, &quot;He spat out the name with a sneer&quot;, or in the context of expectoration of an object that is not saliva, for example, &quot;He spat out the foul-tasting fish&quot; but ''spit'' for &quot;expectorated&quot; when it refers only to the expulsion of saliva.
* The past participle of ''saw'' is normally ''sawn'' in BrE and ''sawed'' in AmE (as in ''sawn-off/sawed-off shotgun'').&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The past participle ''gotten'' is never used in modern BrE, which generally uses ''got'', except in old expressions such as ''ill-gotten gains''. According to the [[Compact Editions of the Oxford English Dictionary|Compact Oxford English Dictionary]], &quot;The form ''gotten'' is not used in British English but is very common in North American English, though even there it is often regarded as non-standard.&quot; The American dictionary Merriam-Webster, however, lists &quot;gotten&quot; as a standard past participle of &quot;get.&quot; In AmE ''gotten'' emphasizes the action of acquiring and ''got'' tends to indicate simple possession (for example, ''Have you gotten it?'' versus ''Have you got it?''). ''Gotten'' is also typically used in AmE as the past participle for [[phrasal verb]]s using ''get'', such as ''get off'', ''get on'', ''get into'', ''get up'', and ''get around'': ''If you hadn't gotten up so late, you might not have gotten into this mess.'' Interestingly, AmE, but not BrE, has ''forgot'' as a less common alternative to ''forgotten'' for the past participle of ''forget''.
* In BrE, the past participle ''proved'' is strongly preferred to ''proven''; in AmE, ''proven'' is now about as common as ''proved''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/prove |title=prove – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=M-w.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Both dialects use ''proven'' as an adjective, and in formulas such as ''[[Scots law#&quot;Not proven&quot; verdict|not proven]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;
* AmE further allows other irregular verbs, such as ''dive'' (''dove'') or ''sneak'' (''snuck''), and often mixes the [[preterit]] and past participle forms (''spring''–''sprang'', US also ''sprung''–''sprung''), sometimes forcing verbs such as ''shrink'' (''shrank''–''shrunk'') to have a further form, thus ''shrunk''–''shrunken''. These uses are often considered nonstandard; the [[AP Stylebook]] in AmE treats some irregular verbs as colloquialisms, insisting on the regular forms for the past tense of ''dive'', ''plead'' and ''sneak''. ''Dove'' and ''snuck'' are usually considered nonstandard in Britain, although ''dove'' exists in some British dialects and ''snuck'' is occasionally found in British speech.
* By extension of the irregular verb pattern, verbs with irregular preterits in some variants of colloquial AmE also have a separate past participle, for example, &quot;to buy&quot;: past tense ''bought'' spawns ''boughten''. Such formations are highly irregular from speaker to speaker, or even within [[idiolect]]s. This phenomenon is found chiefly in the northern US and other areas where immigrants of German descent are predominant and may have developed as a result of German influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/72/B0417200.html boughten. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Even in areas where the feature predominates, however, it has not gained widespread acceptance as standard usage.

====Use of tenses====
* Traditionally, BrE uses the [[present perfect]] to talk about an event in the recent past and with the words ''already'', ''just'' and ''yet.'' In American usage these meanings can be expressed with the present perfect (to express a fact{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}) or the [[preterite|simple past]] (to imply an expectation{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}). This American style has become widespread only in the past 20 to 30 years; the British style is still in common use as well. Recently the American use of ''just'' with simple past has made inroads into BrE, most visibly in advertising slogans and headlines such as &quot;Cable broadband just got faster&quot;.
** &quot;I've just arrived home.&quot; / &quot;I just arrived home.&quot;
** &quot;I've already eaten.&quot; / &quot;I already ate.&quot;

* Similarly AmE occasionally replaces the [[Pluperfect|past perfect]] with the [[Simple past (English)|simple past]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

* In BrE, ''have got'' or ''have'' can be used for possession and ''have got to'' and ''have to'' can be used for the [[Modal verb|modal of necessity]]. The forms that include ‘‘got’’ are usually used in informal contexts and the forms without ''got'' in contexts that are more formal. In American speech the form without ''got'' is used more than in the UK, although the form with ''got'' is often used for emphasis. Colloquial AmE informally uses ''got'' as a verb for these meanings – for example, ''I got two cars'', ''I got to go''.

* In [[conditional sentences]], US spoken usage often substitutes ''would'' and ''would have'' (usually shortened to ''[I]'d'' and ''[I]'d have'') for the simple past and for the pluperfect (''If you'd leave now, you'd be on time''. / ''If I would have [I'd've] cooked the pie we could have [could've] had it for lunch''). This tends to be avoided in writing because it is often still considered non-standard although such use of ''would'' is widespread in spoken US English in all sectors of society. Some reliable sources now label this usage as acceptable US English and no longer label it as colloquial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perfectyourenglish.com/writing/american-and-british-usage-2.htm |title=Conditional would is sometimes used in both clauses of an if-sentence. This is common in spoken American English. |publisher=Perfectyourenglish.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearson Longman, Longman Exams Dictionary, grammar guide:
It is possible to use ''would'' in both clauses in US English but not in British English: US: The blockades '''wouldn't happen''' if the police '''would be firmer''' with the strikers. Br: The blockades '''wouldn't happen''' if the police '''were firmer''' with the strikers.&lt;/ref&gt; (There are, of course, situations where ''would'' is used in British English too in seemingly counterfactual conditions, but these can usually be interpreted as a modal use of ''would'': ''If you would listen to me once in a while, you might learn something''.)&lt;ref name=&quot;lingua.org.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lingua.org.uk/eq&amp;a.html |title=NELL.links |publisher=Lingua.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.wordreference.com/showpost.php?p=5478593&amp;postcount=6 |title=To stress willingness of wish, you can use would or will in both clauses of the same sentence: If the band would rehearse more, they would play better. If the band will rehearse more, they will play better. Both mean the same. (based on the examples and explanations from Practical English Usage, Michael Swan, Oxford) |publisher=Forum.wordreference.com |date=2008-08-02 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases in which the action in the ''if'' clause takes place after that in the main clause, use of ''would'' in counterfactual conditions is, however, considered standard and correct usage in even formal UK and US usage: ''If it would make Bill happy, I'd [I would] give him the money.''&lt;ref name=&quot;lingua.org.uk&quot;/&gt;
* The [[subjunctive mood]] (morphologically identical with the bare infinitive) is regularly used in AmE in [[Subjunctive mood#To express a command, request, or suggestion|mandative clauses]] (as in ''They suggested that he apply for the job''). In BrE, this usage declined in the 20th century in favour of constructions such as ''They suggested that he should apply for the job'' (or even, more ambiguously, ''They suggested that he applied for the job''). However the mandative subjunctive has always been used in BrE.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, pp. 520 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Verbal auxiliaries====
*''Shall'' (as opposed to ''will'') is more commonly used by the British than by Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shall#Current_common_usage |title=Shall and will - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/64/C001/056.html § 56. shall / will. 1. Grammar. The American Heritage Book of English Usage. 1996&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shan't'' is almost never used in AmE (almost invariably replaced by ''won't'' or ''am not going to'') and is increasingly rare in BrE as well.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} American grammar also tends to ignore some traditional distinctions between ''should'' and ''would'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/64/C001/057.html#SHOULD § 57. should. 1. Grammar. The American Heritage Book of English Usage. 1996&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; however, expressions like ''I should be happy'' are rather formal even in BrE.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
*The [[Periphrasis|periphrastic future]] (''be going to'') is about twice as frequent in AmE as in BrE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/31/4/295]; Algeo, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transitivity====
The following verbs show differences in transitivity between BrE and AmE.
* ''agree'': Transitive or intransitive in BrE, usually intransitive in AmE (''agree a contract''/''agree to'' or ''on a contract''). However in formal AmE legal writing one often sees constructions such as ''as may be agreed between the parties'' (rather than ''as may be agreed ''upon'' between the parties'').
* ''appeal'' (as a decision): Usually intransitive in BrE (used with ''against'') and transitive in AmE (''appeal against the decision to the Court''/''appeal the decision to the Court'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=001611%23x1%23x1%23appeal&amp;selected_word=appeal&amp;search_word=appeal |title=Possible entries for appeal |publisher=Oup.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''catch up'' (&quot;to reach and overtake&quot;): Transitive or intransitive in BrE, strictly intransitive in AmE (''to catch sb up''/''to catch up with sb''). A transitive form does exist in AmE, but has a different meaning: ''to catch sb up'' means that the subject will help the object catch up, rather the opposite of the BrE transitive meaning.
* ''cater'' (&quot;to provide food and service&quot;): Intransitive in BrE, transitive or intransitive in AmE (''to cater for a banquet''/''to cater a banquet'').
* ''claim'': Sometimes intransitive in BrE (used with ''for''), strictly transitive in AmE.
* ''meet'': AmE uses intransitively ''meet'' followed by ''with'' to mean &quot;to have a meeting with&quot;, as for business purposes (''Yesterday we met with the CEO''), and reserves transitive ''meet'' for the meanings &quot;to be introduced to&quot; (''I want you to meet the CEO; she is such a fine lady''), &quot;to come together with (someone, somewhere)&quot; (''Meet the CEO at the train station''), and &quot;to have a casual encounter with&quot;. BrE uses transitive ''meet'' also to mean &quot;to have a meeting with&quot;; the construction ''meet with'', which actually dates back to Middle English, appears to be coming back into use in Britain, despite some commentators who preferred to avoid confusion with ''meet with'' meaning &quot;receive, undergo&quot; (''the proposal was met with disapproval''). The construction ''meet up with'' (as in ''to meet up with someone''), which originated in the US,&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; has long been standard in both dialects.
* ''provide'': Strictly [[Monotransitive verb|monotransitive]] in BrE, monotransitive or [[Ditransitive verb|ditransitive]] in AmE (''provide sb with sth''/''provide sb sth'').
* ''protest'': In sense &quot;oppose&quot;, intransitive in BrE, transitive in AmE (''The workers protested against the decision''/''The workers protested the decision''). The intransitive ''protest against'' in AmE means, &quot;to hold or participate in a demonstration against&quot;. The older sense &quot;proclaim&quot; is always transitive (''protest one's innocence'').
* ''write'': In BrE, the indirect object of this verb usually requires the preposition ''to'', for example, ''I'll write ''to'' my MP'' or ''I'll write ''to'' her'' (although it is not required in some situations, for example when an indirect object pronoun comes before a direct object noun, for example, ''I'll write ''her'' a letter''). In AmE, ''write'' can be used monotransitively (''I'll write my congressman''; ''I'll write him'').

====Complementation====
* The verbs ''prevent'' and ''stop'' can be found in two different constructions: &quot;prevent/stop someone ''from'' doing something&quot; and &quot;prevent/stop someone doing something&quot;. The latter is well established in BrE, but not in AmE.
* Some verbs can take either a to+infinitive construction or a [[gerund]] construction (for example, ''to start to do something''/''to start doing something''). For example, the gerund is more common:
** In AmE than BrE, with ''start'',&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 515.&lt;/ref&gt; ''begin'',&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; ''omit'',&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; ''enjoy'';&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;
** In BrE than AmE, with ''love'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=021990%23x1%23x1%23love&amp;selected_word=love&amp;search_word=love |title=Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |publisher=Oup.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''like'',&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; ''intend''.&lt;ref&gt;p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presence or absence of syntactic elements===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
* Where a statement of intention involves two separate activities, it is acceptable for speakers of AmE to use ''to go'' plus bare infinitive. Speakers of BrE would instead use ''to go '''and''''' plus bare infinitive. Thus, where a speaker of AmE may say ''I'll go take a bath'', BrE speakers would say ''I'll go ''and'' have a bath''.  (Both can also use the form ''to go to'' instead to suggest that the action may fail, as in ''He went to take/have a bath, but the bath was full of children''.)  Similarly, ''to come'' plus bare infinitive is acceptable to speakers of AmE, where speakers of BrE would instead use ''to come '''and''''' plus bare infinitive. Thus, where a speaker of AmE may say ''come see what I bought'', BrE speakers would say ''come and see what I've bought'' (notice the present perfect: a common British preference).
* Use of prepositions before days denoted by a single word. Where British people would say ''She resigned on Thursday'', Americans often say ''She resigned Thursday'', but both forms are common in American usage. Occasionally the preposition is also absent when referring to months: ''I'll be here December'' (although this usage is generally limited to colloquial speech).
* In the UK, ''from'' is used with single dates and times more often than in the United States. Where British speakers and writers may say ''the new museum will be open from Tuesday'', Americans most likely say ''the new museum will be open starting Tuesday''. (This difference does not apply to phrases of the pattern ''from A to B'', which are used in both BrE and AmE.) A variation or alternative of this is the mostly American ''the play opens Tuesday'' and the mostly British ''the play opens on Tuesday''.
* American [[legislator]]s and lawyers always use the preposition ''of'' between the name of a legislative act and the year it was passed; their British compeers do not. Compare ''[[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]'' to ''[[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]]''.

====The definite article====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
* A few 'institutional' nouns take no [[definite article]] when a certain role is implied: for example, ''at sea'' (as a sailor), ''in prison'' (as a convict), and ''at/in college'' (for students). Among this group, BrE has ''in [[hospital]]'' (as a patient) and ''at university'' (as a student), where AmE requires ''in '''the''' hospital'' and ''at '''the''' university'' (though AmE does allow ''at college'' and ''in school''). When the implied roles of patient or student do not apply, the definite article is used in both dialects.
* Likewise, BrE distinguishes ''in future'' (&quot;from now on&quot;) from ''in the future'' (&quot;at some future time&quot;); AmE uses ''in the future'' for both senses.
* AmE omits, and BrE requires, the definite article in a few standard expressions{{Clarify|date=July 2008}} such as ''tell (the) time''.
* In BrE, numbered highways usually take the definite article (for example &quot;the M25&quot;, &quot;the A14&quot;); in America they usually do not (&quot;I-495&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;). [[Buffalo English|Upstate New York]], Southern [[California English]] and Arizona are exceptions, where &quot;the 33&quot;, &quot;the 5&quot; or &quot;the 10&quot; are the standard. A similar pattern is followed for named roads (for example, Strand in London is almost always referred to as ''the'' Strand), but in America, there are local variations and older American highways tend to follow the British pattern (&quot;the Boston Post Road&quot;).
* AmE distinguishes ''in back of'' [behind] from ''in '''the''' back of''; the former is unknown in the UK and liable to misinterpretation as the latter. Both, however, distinguish ''in front of'' from ''in the front of''.
* Dates usually include a definite article in UK spoken English, such as &quot;'''the''' eleventh of July&quot;, or &quot;July '''the''' eleventh&quot;; American speakers most commonly say &quot;July eleventh&quot; or &quot;July eleven&quot;.

===Prepositions and adverbs===
* In the United States, the word ''through'' can mean &quot;up to and including&quot; as in ''Monday through Friday''. In the UK (and for many Americans) ''Monday to Friday'', or ''Monday to Friday inclusive'' is used instead; ''Monday through to Friday'' is also sometimes used. (In some parts of North-West England, mainly Lancashire, the term ''while'' can be used in the same way, as in ''Monday while Friday'', whereas in Ireland{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} ''Monday till Friday'' would be more natural.)
* British sportsmen play ''in a team''; American athletes play ''on a team''. (Both may play ''for'' a particular team.)
* In AmE, the use of the function word ''out'' as a preposition in ''out the door'' and ''out the window'' is standard to mean &quot;out through&quot;. For example, in AmE, one jumps &quot;out of a boat&quot; by jumping &quot;out the porthole,&quot; and it would be incorrect in standard AmE to &quot;jump out the boat&quot; or climb &quot;out of the porthole.&quot; In BrE, ''out of'' is preferred in writing for both meanings, but ''out'' is common in speech.&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, p. 186; Peters, pp. 400–401.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other uses of ''out of'' are peculiarly British (''out of all recognition'', ''out of the team''; cf. above);&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; all of this notwithstanding, ''out of'' is overall more frequent in AmE than in BrE (about four times as frequent, according to Algeo&lt;ref&gt;p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;).
* In much of the Northeastern United States, &quot;on line&quot; (two words) refers to the state of waiting in a line or queue; for example, standing on a sidewalk waiting for a table at a restaurant. Elsewhere in AmE, one waits &quot;in line&quot; and goes &quot;online&quot; (one word) for email. Usage of &quot;queue&quot; among Americans has increased in the last twenty years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In BrE, ''queue'' is the universal term and no variants of ''line'' are used in relation to waiting in turn. In BrE, people talk of standing in a queue, queuing up, joining the queue, sitting in a queue (for example, when driving) and simply queuing.
* The word ''heat'' meaning &quot;[[oestrus|mating season]]&quot; is used with ''on'' in the UK (Regional Variation) and with ''in'' in the US.
* The intransitive verb ''affiliate'' can take either ''with'' or ''to'' in BrE but only ''with'' in AmE.
* The verb ''enrol(l)'' usually takes ''on'' in BrE and ''in'' in AmE (as in &quot;to enrol(l) on/in a course&quot;) and the ''on/in'' difference is used when ''enrolled'' is dropped (as in &quot;I am (enrolled) on the course that studies....&quot;).
* In AmE, one always speaks of the street ''on'' which an address is located, whereas in BrE ''in'' can also be used in some contexts. ''In'' suggests an address on a city street, so a service station (or a tourist attraction or indeed a village) would always be ''on'' a major road, but a department store might be ''in'' [[Oxford Street]]. Moreover if a particular place on the street is specified then the preposition used is whichever is idiomatic to the place, thus &quot;''at'' the end of Churchill Road.&quot;
* BrE favours the preposition ''at'' with ''weekend'' (&quot;at (the) weekend(s)&quot;); the constructions ''on'', ''over'' and ''during (the) weekend(s)'' are found in both varieties but are all more common in AmE than BrE.&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, pp. 163 f.&lt;/ref&gt; See also ''Word derivation and compounds''.
* Adding ''at'' to the end of a question requesting a location is common in spoken AmE, for example, &quot;where are you ''at''?&quot;, but would be considered superfluous in standard BrE (though not in some dialects). However some south-western British dialects use ''to'' in the same context; for example &quot;where are you ''to''?&quot;, to mean &quot;where are you&quot;.
* After ''talk'' American can also use the preposition ''with'' but British always{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} uses ''to'' (that is, ''I'll talk with Dave'' / ''I'll talk to Dave''). The American form is sometimes seen as more [[politically correct]] in British organizations, inducing the ideal of discussing (with) as opposed to lecturing (to). This is unless talk is being used as a noun; for example: &quot;I'll have a talk with him&quot; in which case this is acceptable in both BrE and AmE. &lt;!-- the use of &quot;with&quot; and &quot;to&quot; with &quot;talk&quot; is much more complex than this rather simplistic explanation makes clear... --&gt;
* In both dialects, ''from'' is the preposition prescribed for use after the word ''different'': ''American English is different from British English in several respects.'' However ''different than'' is also commonly heard in the US, and is often considered standard when followed by a clause (''American English is different than it used to be''), whereas ''different to'' is a common alternative in BrE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Partridge|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Partridge|title=Usage and Abusage|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|location=London|year=1947|chapter=Than, different|quote=The impeccably correct construction is ''different...from'' although ''different to'' is permissible}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/styleguide/page/0,,184835,00.html|title=Guardian Style Guide|last=Staff|publisher=The Guardian|quote=different from
or to, not different than|accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is common in BrE to say ''opposite to'' as an alternative to ''opposite of'' when used as a noun, the only form normally found in AmE. The use of ''opposite'' as a preposition (''opposite the post office'') has long been established in both dialects but appears to be more common in British usage.
* The noun ''opportunity'' can be followed by a verb in two different ways: ''opportunity'' plus ''to''-infinitive (&quot;the opportunity to do something&quot;) or ''opportunity'' plus ''of'' plus gerund (&quot;the opportunity of doing something&quot;). The first construction is the most common in both dialects but the second has almost disappeared in AmE and is often regarded as a Briticism.
* Both British and Americans may say (for example) that a river is named ''after'' a state, but &quot;named ''for'' a state&quot; would rightly be regarded as an Americanism.
* BrE sometimes uses ''to'' with ''near'' (''we live near to the university''); AmE avoids the preposition in most usages dealing with literal, physical proximity (''we live near the university''), although the ''to'' reappears in AmE when ''near'' takes the comparative or superlative form, as in ''she lives nearer/nearest to the deranged axe murderer's house''.
* In BrE, one rings someone ''on'' his or her telephone number; in AmE, one calls someone ''at'' his or her telephone number.
* When referring to the constituency of a US Senator the preposition &quot;from&quot; is usually used: &quot;Senator from New York,&quot; whereas British MPs are &quot;for&quot; their constituency: &quot;MP for East Cleveland.&quot;
* In AmE, the phrases ''aside from'' and ''apart from'' are used about equally; in BrE, ''apart from'' is far more common.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 50; cf. [http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=001546%23x1%23x2%23apart%20from&amp;selected_word=apart%20from&amp;search_word=aside OALD].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In AmE, the compound &quot;off of&quot; may be used where BrE almost always uses &quot;off&quot;, and &quot;off of&quot; is considered slang. Compare AmE &quot;He jumped off of the box&quot; and BrE &quot;He jumped off the box&quot;.
* In AmE ''absent'' is sometimes used as a preposition to introduce a prepositional phrase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]] |last1=Huddleston |first1=Rodney |last2=Pullum |first2=Geoffrey K. |year=2002 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=0-521-43146-8 |page=610 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Absent any objections, the proposal was approved.''). The equivalent in BrE would be ''In the absence of any objections, the proposal was approved''.

====Phrasal verbs====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
* Influenced by the German &quot;ausfuellen&quot;, in the US forms are usually but not invariably ''filled out'' but in Britain they are usually ''filled in''. However in reference to individual parts of a form Americans may also use ''in'' (''fill in the blanks''). In AmE the direction ''fill it all in'' (referring to the form as a collection of blanks, perhaps) is as common as ''fill it all out''.
* Britons facing [[Rip-Off Britain|extortionate prices]] may have no option but to ''fork out'', whereas Americans are more likely to ''fork (it) over'' or sometimes ''up''; however the ''out'' usage is found in both dialects.
* In both countries, [[Crime|thugs]] will ''beat up'' their victim; AmE also allows ''beat on'' (as both would for an inanimate object, such as a drum) or ''beat up on'', which are often considered slang.
* When an outdoor event is postponed or interrupted by rain, it is ''rained off'' in the UK and ''rained out'' in the US.

===Miscellaneous grammatical differences===
* In both countries some prescriptionists feel that ''which'' should not be used as an antecedent in [[Restrictive clause|restrictive relative clauses]]. According to ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;59), &quot;''that'' is the defining, or restrictive pronoun, ''which'' the nondefining, or nonrestrictive.&quot; This distinction was endorsed by [[Fowler's Modern English Usage]], but the use of ''which'' as a restrictive pronoun is common in great literature produced on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pullum |first=Geoffrey K. |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000918.html |title=Language Log: More timewasting garbage, another copy-editing moron |publisher=Itre.cis.upenn.edu |date=2004-05-17 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In names of American rivers the word ''river'' usually comes after the name (for example, ''[[Colorado River]]'') whereas for British rivers it comes before (as in ''the [[River Thames]]''). Exceptions in BrE include the ''[[Fleet River]]'', which is rarely called the ''River Fleet'' by [[Greater London|London]]ers outside official documentation, and also where the river name is an adjective (''the [[Yellow River]]''). Exceptions in the US are the ''[[River Rouge (Michigan)|River Rouge]]'' and the ''[[River Raisin]]'', both in [[Michigan]] and named by the French. This convention is mixed in some Commonwealth nations, where both arrangements are often seen.
* In BrE speech, titles may precede names but not descriptions of offices (''President Roosevelt'', but ''Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister'' and ''Mr Jones, the team's coach''); both normally precede names in AmE (''President Roosevelt'', ''Prime Minister Churchill'' and ''Coach Jones'').
* In BrE the word ''sat'' is often colloquially used to cover ''sat'', ''sitting'', and ''seated'': ''I've been sat here waiting for half an hour. The bride's family will be sat on the right-hand side of the church''. This construction is not often heard outside the UK. In the 1960s, its use would mark a speaker as coming from the north of England but by the turn of the 21st century this form had spread to the south. Its use often conveys lighthearted informality, when many speakers intentionally use a dialect or colloquial construction they would probably not use in formal written English. This colloquial usage is widely understood by British speakers. Similarly ''stood'' can be used instead of ''standing''. To an American and still to many Britons these usages are passive and may imply that the subject had been involuntarily forced to sit or stand or directed to hold that location.
* In most areas of the United States the word ''with'' is also used as an adverb: ''I'll come with'' instead of ''I'll come along'', although it is rarely used in writing. ''Come with'' is used as an abbreviation of ''come with me'', as in ''I'm going to the office – come with'' by speakers in [[Minnesota]] and parts of the adjoining states. These parts of the United States have high concentrations of both [[Scandinavians|Scandinavian]] and [[German American]] populations. It is similar to [[South African English]], where the expression comes from Dutch, and is used by [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] speakers when speaking English. These contractions are not used by native BrE speakers.
* The word ''also'' is used at the end of a sentence in AmE (just as ''as well'' and ''too'' are in both dialects) but not so commonly in BrE, although it is encountered in [[Northern Ireland]]. Additionally, the sentence-ending ''as well'' is more formal in AmE than in BrE.
* Before some words beginning with a pronounced (not silent) ''h'' in an unstressed first syllable, such as ''hallucination'', ''hilarious'', ''historic(al)'', ''horrendous'' and ''horrific'', some (especially older) British writers prefer to use ''an'' over ''a'' (''an historical event'', etc.).&lt;ref name=&quot;New Oxford&quot;&gt;New Oxford Dictionary of English, 1999, usage note for ''an'': &quot;There is still some divergence of opinion over the form of the indefinite article to use preceding certain words beginning with '''h'''- when the first syllable is unstressed:  ‘'''a''' historical document’ or ‘'''an''' historical document’; ‘'''a''' hotel’ or ‘'''an'''  hotel’. The form depends on whether the initial h is sounded or not: '''an''' was common in the 18th and 19th centuries because the initial h was commonly not pronounced for these words. In standard modern English the norm is for the '''h''' to be pronounced in words such as '''hotel''' and '''historical''' and therefore the indefinite article '''a''' is used; however the older form, with the silent '''h''' and the indefinite article '''an''', is still encountered, especially among older speakers.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  ''An'' is also preferred before ''hotel'' by some writers of BrE (probably reflecting the relatively recent adoption of the word from French, where the ''h'' is not pronounced).&lt;ref name=Peterspg1&gt;[[Brown Corpus]] and [[Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen Corpus]], quoted in Peters (2004: 1)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of &quot;an&quot; before words beginning with an unstressed &quot;h&quot; is more common generally in BrE than American.&lt;ref name=Peterspg1/&gt; Such usage would now be seen as affected or incorrect in AmE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/determiners/determiners.htm#articles |title=Articles, Determiners, and Quantifiers |publisher=Grammar.ccc.commnet.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; American writers normally use ''a'' in all these cases, although there are occasional uses of ''an historic(al)'' in AmE.&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the New Oxford Dictionary of English, such use is increasingly rare in BrE too.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Oxford&quot;/&gt; Unlike BrE, AmE typically uses ''an'' before ''herb'', since the ''h'' in this word is silent for most Americans.

==Word derivation and compounds==
* Directional suffix ''-ward(s)'': British ''forwards'', ''towards'', ''rightwards'', etc.; American ''forward'', ''toward'', ''rightward''. In both dialects distribution varies somewhat: ''afterwards'', ''towards'', and ''backwards'' are not unusual in America; while in Britain ''forward'' is common, and standard in [[phrasal verb]]s such as ''look forward to''. The forms with ''-s'' may be used as adverbs (or preposition ''towards'') but rarely as adjectives: in Britain as in America, one says &quot;an upward motion&quot;. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 1897 suggested a semantic distinction for adverbs, with ''-wards'' having a more definite directional sense than ''-ward''; subsequent authorities such as [[Fowler's Modern English Usage|Fowler]] have disputed this contention.
* AmE freely adds the suffix ''-s'' to ''day'', ''night'', ''evening'', ''weekend'', ''Monday'', etc. to form adverbs denoting repeated or customary action: ''I used to stay out evenings''; ''the library is closed Saturdays''. This usage has its roots in Old English but many of these constructions are now regarded as American (for example, the OED labels ''nights'' &quot;now chiefly N. Amer. colloq.&quot;; but ''to work nights'' is standard in BrE).
* In BrE, the agentive ''-er'' suffix is commonly attached to ''football'' (also ''[[cricket]]''; often ''[[netball]]''; occasionally ''basketball''). AmE usually uses ''football player''. Where the sport's name is usable as a verb, the suffixation is standard in both dialects: for example, ''[[golf]]er'', ''bowler'' (in [[Ten-pin bowling]] and in [[Bowls|Lawn Bowls]]), and ''[[Shooting sports|shooter]]''. AmE appears sometimes to use the BrE form in ''baller'' as slang for a basketball player, as in the video game ''[[NBA Ballers]]''. However this is derived from slang use of ''to ball'' as a verb meaning to play basketball.
* English writers everywhere occasionally (and from time immemorial) make new compound words from common phrases; for example, ''health care'' is now being replaced by ''healthcare'' on both sides of the Atlantic. However AmE has made certain words in this fashion that are still treated as phrases in BrE.&lt;!--example?--&gt;
* In [[English compound#Compound nouns|compound nouns]] of the form &lt;verb&gt;&amp;lt;noun&gt;, sometimes AmE favours the [[Infinitive#Uses of the bare infinitive|bare infinitive]] where BrE favours the [[gerund]]. Examples include (AmE first): ''[[jump rope]]''/''skipping&amp;nbsp;rope''; ''racecar''/''racing car''; ''rowboat''/''rowing boat''; ''sailboat''/''sailing boat''; ''file cabinet''/''filing cabinet''; ''dial tone''/''dialling tone''; ''drainboard''/''draining board''.
* Generally AmE has a tendency to drop inflectional suffixes, thus favouring clipped forms: compare ''cookbook'' v. ''cookery book''; ''Smith, age 40'' v. ''Smith, aged 40''; ''skim milk'' v. ''skimmed milk''; ''dollhouse'' v. ''dolls' house''; ''barbershop'' v. ''barber's shop''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=008170%23x1%23x2%23cookbook&amp;selected_word=cookbook&amp;search_word=cookery |title='&amp;#39;Cookbook'&amp;#39; is now often used in BrE |publisher=Oup.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has recently been extended to appear on professionally printed commercial signage and some boxes themselves (not mere greengrocers' chalkboards): ''can vegetables'' and ''mash potatoes'' appear in the US.
* Singular attributives in one country may be plural in the other, and ''vice versa''. For example the UK has a ''drugs problem'' while the United States has a ''drug problem'' (although the singular usage is also commonly heard in the UK); Americans read the ''[[sports]]'' section of a newspaper; the British are more likely to read the ''sport'' section. However BrE ''maths'' is singular, just as AmE ''math'' is: both are abbreviations of ''mathematics''.

==Vocabulary==

{{Cleanup-rewrite|spotty, incomplete, disconnected, too long|date=February 2009}}
Most of the differences in lexis or vocabulary between British and American English are in connection with concepts originating from the 19th century to the mid 20th century, when new words were coined independently.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Almost the entire vocabularies of the car/automobile and railway/railroad industries (see Rail terminology) are different between the UK and US, for example. Other sources of difference are slang or vulgar terms (where frequent new coinage occurs) and idiomatic phrases, including phrasal verbs. The differences most likely to create confusion are those where the same word or phrase is used for two different concepts. Regional variations, even within the US or the UK, can create the same problems.

It is not a straightforward matter to classify differences of vocabulary. David Crystal identifies some of the problems of classification on the facing page to his list of American English/British English lexical variation and states &quot;this should be enough to suggest caution when working through an apparently simple list of equivalents&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal states one of the classification problems as

::&quot;We have to allow for words which have at least one [shared] meaning and one or more additional meanings that are specific to either AmE or BrE: an example is caravan, which in the sense of 'group of travellers in the desert' is common to both varieties; but in the sense of 'vehicle towed by a car' it is BrE (=AmE trailer)&quot;

David Crystal, The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of The English Language. 2nd Edition. (Cambridge University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview of lexical differences===

''Note: A lexicon is not made up of different words but different &quot;units of meaning&quot; (lexical units or lexical items e.g. 'fly ball' in baseball), including idioms and figures of speech{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. This makes it easier to compare the dialects.''

Though the influence of cross-culture media has done much to familiarize BrE and AmE speakers with each other's regional words and terms, many words are still recognized as part of a single form of English. Though the use of a British word would be acceptable in AmE (and vice versa), most listeners would recognize the word as coming from the other form of English and treat it much the same as a word borrowed from any other language. For instance a British speaker using the word ''chap'' or ''mate'' to refer to a friend would be heard in much the same way as an American using the Spanish word ''amigo''.

====Words and phrases that have their origins in BrE====

Some speakers of AmE are aware of some BrE terms, although they may not generally use them or may be confused as to whether someone intends the American or British meaning (such as for ''biscuit''). They will be able to guess approximately what some others, such as “driving licence,” mean. However use of many other British words such as ''[[Polari#Naff|naff]]'' (slang but commonly used to mean &quot;not very good&quot;) risks rendering a sentence incomprehensible to most Americans.

====Words and phrases that have their origins in AmE====

Speakers of BrE are likely to understand most common AmE terms, examples such as 'sidewalk', 'gas (gasoline/petrol)', 'counterclockwise' or 'elevator (lift)', without any problem, thanks in part to considerable exposure to American popular culture and literature. Certain terms that are heard less frequently, especially those likely to be absent or rare in American popular culture, eg. 'copacetic (satisfactory)', are unlikely to be understood by most BrE speakers.

====Divergence====
=====Words and phrases with different meanings=====

Words such as ''bill'' (AmE &quot;paper money,&quot; BrE and AmE &quot;invoice&quot;) and ''biscuit'' (AmE: BrE's &quot;scone&quot;, BrE: AmE's &quot;cookie&quot;) are used regularly in both AmE and BrE but mean different things in each form{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. As chronicled by [[Winston Churchill]], the opposite meanings of the verb ''[[Table (verb)|to table]]'' created a misunderstanding during a meeting of the Allied forces;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Second World War, Volume 3: The Grand Alliance  |last=Churchill |first=Winston |authorlink=Winston Churchill  |year=1948–1954 |publisher=Cassell |location=London |isbn=978-0141441740}}&lt;/ref&gt; in BrE to table an item on an agenda means to ''open it up'' for discussion whereas in AmE, it means to ''remove'' it from discussion.

The word &quot;football&quot; in BrE refers to [[Association football]], also known as [[soccer]]. In AmE, &quot;football&quot; means [[American football]] (although &quot;soccer&quot;, a contraction of &quot;association (football)&quot;, the standard AmE term, is also of British origin, derived from the formalization of different codes of football in the 19th century, and was a fairly unremarkable usage (possibly marked for class) in BrE until relatively recently; it has latterly become falsely perceived as an intrusive Americanism).

Similarly the word &quot;hockey&quot; in BrE refers to [[field hockey]]; in AmE &quot;hockey&quot; means [[ice hockey]].

=====Other ambiguity (complex cases)=====

Words with [[List of words having different meanings in British and American English|completely different meanings]] are relatively few; most of the time there are either (1) words with one or more shared meanings and one or more meanings unique to one variety (for example, bathroom and toilet) or (2) words the meanings of which are actually common to both BrE and AmE but that show differences in frequency, connotation or denotation (for example, ''smart'', ''clever'', ''mad'').

Some differences in usage and/or meaning can cause confusion or embarrassment. For example the word ''fanny'' is a slang word for [[vulva]] in BrE but means [[buttocks]] in AmE – the AmE phrase ''[[fanny pack]]'' is ''bum bag'' in BrE. In AmE the word ''fag'' (short for ''[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]'') is a highly offensive term for a gay male but in BrE it is a normal and well-used term for a cigarette, for hard work, or for a chore, while a [[Faggot (food)|faggot]] itself is a sort of [[meatball]]. In AmE the word ''pissed'' means being annoyed whereas in BrE it is a coarse word for being drunk (in both varieties, ''pissed off'' means irritated). Similarly, in AmE the word ''pants'' is the common word for the BrE ''trousers,'' while in BrE ''pants'' refers to the AmE ''underwear''.

Sometimes the confusion is more subtle. In AmE the word ''quite'' used as a qualifier is generally a reinforcement: for example, &quot;I'm quite hungry&quot; means &quot;I'm very hungry&quot;. In BrE ''quite'' (which is much more common in conversation) may have this meaning, as in &quot;quite right&quot; or &quot;quite mad&quot;, but it more commonly means &quot;somewhat&quot;, so that in BrE &quot;I'm quite hungry&quot; can mean &quot;I'm somewhat hungry&quot;. This divergence of use can lead to misunderstanding.

====Frequency====
* In the UK the word ''whilst'' is historically acceptable as a conjunction (as an alternative to ''while'', especially prevalent in some dialects). In AmE only ''while'' is used in both contexts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}
* In the UK generally the term ''fall'' meaning &quot;autumn&quot; is [[obsolete]]. Although found often from [[English literature#Elizabethan Era|Elizabethan literature]] to [[Victorian literature]], continued understanding of the word is usually ascribed to its continued use in America.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}
*In the UK the term ''period'' for a [[full stop]] is not used; in AmE the term ''full stop'' is rarely, if ever, used for the punctuation mark. For example, [[Tony Blair]] said, &quot;Terrorism is wrong, full stop&quot;, whereas in AmE, &quot;Terrorism is wrong, period.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page7999.asp |title=PM's Press Conference |publisher=[[10 Downing Street]] |date=26 July 2005 |accessdate=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK the US equivalent of a ''high school'' is often referred to as a ''secondary school'' regardless of whether it is state funded or private. Secondary education in the United States also includes ''middle school'' or ''junior high school'', a two- or three-year transitional school between elementary school and high school. &quot;Middle school&quot; is sometimes used in the UK as a synonym for the younger ''junior school'', covering the second half of the primary curriculum - current years 4 to 6 in some areas.

A ''public school'' has opposite meanings in the two countries. In the US this is a government-owned institution supported by taxpayers. In England and Wales the term strictly refers to an ill-defined group of prestigious [[Independent school (UK)|private independent school]]s funded by students' fees, although it is often more loosely used to refer to any independent school. Independent schools are also known as ''private schools'', and the latter is the correct term in Scotland and [[Northern Ireland]] for all such fee-funded schools. Strictly, the term ''public school'' is not used in Scotland and Northern Ireland in the same sense as in England, but nevertheless [[Gordonstoun]], the Scottish private school which [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] attended, is sometimes referred to as a ''public school''. Government-funded schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland are properly referred to as ''state schools''&amp;nbsp;– but are sometimes confusingly referred to as ''public schools'' (with the same meaning as in the US); whereas in the US, where most public schools are administered by local governments, a ''state school'' is typically a college or university run by one of the [[U.S. state|states]]. The UK use of the term &quot;public&quot; school is in contrast with &quot;private&quot; education, i.e. to be educated privately with a tutor.&lt;ref&gt;^ &quot;public education&quot;. Oxford English Dictionary. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press. 1971. &quot;=PUBLIC 4b.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers in both the United States and the United Kingdom use several additional terms for specific types of secondary school. A US ''prep school'' or ''[[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]]'' is an independent school funded by tuition fees; the same term is used in the UK for a [[preparatory school (UK)|private school for pupils under thirteen]], designed to prepare them for fee-paying public schools. An American ''[[parochial school]]'' covers costs through tuition and has affiliation with a religious institution, most often a [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]] church or diocese. (Interestingly, the term &quot;parochial&quot; is almost never used to describe schools run by [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Protestant]] groups.) In England, where the state-funded [[Education in the United Kingdom|education system]] grew from parish schools organized by the local [[established church]], the [[Church of England]] (C. of E., or C.E.), and many schools, especially [[Primary education|primary schools]] (up to age 11) retain a church connection and are known as ''[[faith school#United Kingdom|church schools]]'', ''C.E. Schools'' or ''C.E. (Aided) Schools''. There are also ''faith schools'' associated with the Roman Catholic Church and other major faiths, with a mixture of funding arrangements.

In the US, a ''[[magnet school]]'' receives government funding and has special admission requirements: pupils gain admission through superior performance on admission tests. The UK has [[Academy (England)|city academies]], which are independent privately sponsored schools run with public funding and which can select up to 10% of pupils by [[aptitude]]. Moreover in the UK 36 Local Education Authorities retain selection by ability at 11. They maintain Grammar Schools (State funded secondary schools), which admit pupils according to performance in an examination (known as the 11+) and Comprehensive schools that take pupils of all abilities. Grammar Schools cream from 10% to 23% of those who sit the exam. However nationally only 6% of pupils attend Grammar Schools.{{cn|date=May 2011}} Private schools can also call themselves Grammar Schools.

=====University=====

In the UK a university student is said to ''study'', to ''read'' or informally simply to ''do'' a subject. In the recent past the expression 'to read a subject' was more common at the older universities such as Oxford and Cambridge. In the US a student ''studies'' or ''majors in'' a subject (although ''concentration'' or ''emphasis'' is also used in some US colleges or universities to refer to the major subject of study). ''To major in'' something refers to the student's principal course of study; ''to study'' may refer to any class being taken.

BrE:

:&quot;She read biology at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]].&quot;
:&quot;She studied biology at Cambridge.&quot;
:&quot;She did biology at Cambridge.&quot; (informal)

AmE:

:&quot;She majored in biology at [[Harvard University|Harvard]].&quot;
:&quot;She studied biology at Harvard.&quot;
:&quot;She concentrated in biology at Harvard.&quot;

At university level in BrE, each ''module'' is taught by a ''[[lecturer]]'' or ''tutor''; ''professor'' is the job-title of a [[Professor#Most English-speaking countries|senior academic]]. In AmE each ''class'' is generally taught by a ''professor'' (although some US tertiary educational institutions follow the BrE usage), while the position of ''lecturer'' is occasionally given to individuals hired on a temporary basis to teach one or more classes and who may or not have a doctoral degree.

The word ''course'' in American use typically refers to the study of a restricted topic (for example, ''a course in Early Medieval England'', ''a course in Integral Calculus'') over a limited period of time (such as a semester or term) and is equivalent to a ''module'' at a British university. In the UK a ''course of study'' is likely to refer to a whole programme of study, which may extend over several years and be made up of any number of ''modules''.

=====General terms=====

In the UK a student is said to ''sit'' or ''take'' an exam while in the US, a student ''takes'' an exam. The expression ''he sits for'' an exam also arises in BrE but only rarely in AmE; American lawyers-to-be ''sit for'' their bar exams and American master's and doctoral students may ''sit for'' their comprehensive exams, but in nearly all other instances, Americans ''take'' their exams.
When preparing for an exam students ''revise'' (BrE)/''review'' (AmE) what they have studied; the BrE idiom ''to revise for'' has the equivalent ''to review for'' in AmE.

Examinations are supervised by ''invigilators'' in the UK and ''proctors'' (or ''(exam) supervisors'') in the US (a ''proctor'' in the UK is an official responsible for student discipline at the University of Oxford or Cambridge). In the UK a teacher ''sets'' an exam while in the US, a teacher ''writes'' (prepares) and then ''gives'' (administers) an exam.

BrE:

:&quot;I sat my Spanish exam yesterday.&quot;
:&quot;I plan to set a difficult exam for my students, but I don't have it ready yet.&quot;

AmE:

:&quot;I took my exams at Yale.&quot;
:&quot;I spent the entire day yesterday writing the exam. I'm almost ready to give it to my students.&quot;

Another source of confusion is the different usage of the word ''college''. (See a full international discussion of the various meanings at [[college]].) In the US this refers to a post-high school institution that grants either associate's or bachelor's degrees while in the UK it refers to any post-secondary institution that is not a university (including ''Sixth Form College'' after the name in secondary education for Years 12 and 13, the ''6th form'') where intermediary courses such as [[Advanced Level (UK)|A Levels]] or [[NVQ]]s can be taken and [[GCSE]] courses can be retaken. College may sometimes be used in the UK or in Commonwealth countries as part of the name of a secondary or high school (for example, [[Dubai College]]). In the case of Oxford, Cambridge, [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]], [[University of London|London]], [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]], [[Durham University|Durham]] and [[University of Kent|Kent]] universities, all members are also members of a college which is part of the university, for example, one is a member of [[Clare College, Cambridge]] and hence the University.

In both the US and UK ''college'' can refer to some division within a university such as the &quot;college of business and economics&quot; though in the UK &quot;faculty&quot; is more often used. Institutions in the US that offer two to four years of post-high school education often have the word ''college'' as part of their name, while those offering more advanced degrees are called a ''university''. (There are exceptions of course: [[Boston College]], [[Dartmouth College]] and [[The College of William &amp; Mary]] are examples of colleges that offer advanced degrees, while [[Vincennes University]] is an unusual example of a &quot;university&quot; that offers only associate degrees in the vast majority of its academic programs.) American students who pursue a ''bachelor's degree'' (four years of higher education) or an ''associate degree'' (two years of higher education) are ''college students'' regardless of whether they attend a college or a university and refer to their educational institutions informally as ''colleges.'' A student who pursues a master's degree or a doctorate degree in the arts and sciences is in AmE a ''graduate student''; in BrE a ''postgraduate student'' although ''graduate student'' is also sometimes used. Students of advanced professional programmes are known by their field (''business student'', ''law student'', ''medical student''). Some universities also have a [[residential college]] system, the details of which may vary but generally involve common living and dining spaces as well as college-organized activities.

&quot;Professor&quot; has different meanings in BrE and AmE. In BrE it is the highest [[academic rank]], followed by Reader, Senior Lecturer and Lecturer. In AmE &quot;Professor&quot; refers to academic staff of all ranks, with (Full) Professor (largely equivalent to the UK meaning) followed by Associate Professor and Assistant Professor.&lt;!-- why capitalize?  not referring to any particular assistant professor, such as Assistant Professor Johnsondaleburgerschnitzle. --- Generally one wouldn't capitalize these in running text, but the other choice given that they are being referred to as words rather than used as words would be to put each of the titles into quotation marks, which seems even more obtrusive.cig-nifyer--&gt;

There is additionally a difference between American and British usage in the word ''school''. In British usage &quot;school&quot; by itself refers only to primary (elementary) and secondary (high) schools and to ''sixth forms'' attached to secondary schools&amp;nbsp;– if one &quot;goes to school&quot;, this type of institution is implied. By contrast an American student at a university may talk of &quot;going to school&quot; or &quot;being in school&quot;. US law students and medical students almost universally speak in terms of going to &quot;law school&quot; and &quot;med school&quot;, respectively. However the word is used in BrE in the context of higher education to describe a division grouping together several related subjects within a university, for example a &quot;School of European Languages&quot; containing ''departments'' for each language and also in the term &quot;art school&quot;. It is also the name of some of the constituent colleges of the University of London, for example, [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[London School of Economics]].

Among high-school and college students in the United States, the words ''freshman'' (or the gender-neutral term ''frosh'' or ''first year''), ''sophomore'', ''junior'' and ''senior'' refer to the first, second, third, and fourth years respectively. For first-year students, &quot;frosh&quot; is another gender-neutral term that can be used as a qualifier, for example &quot;Frosh class elections&quot;. It is important that the context of either high school or college first be established or else it must be stated direct (that is, ''She is a high school freshman''. ''He is a college junior.''). Many institutes in both countries also use the term ''first-year'' as a gender-neutral replacement for ''freshman'', although in the US this is recent usage, formerly referring only to those in the first year as a graduate student. One exception is the [[University of Virginia]]; since its founding in 1819 the terms &quot;first-year&quot;, &quot;second-year&quot;, &quot;third-year&quot;, and &quot;fourth-year&quot; have been used to describe undergraduate university students. At the [[United States military academies]], at least those operated by the federal government direct, a different terminology is used, namely &quot;fourth class&quot;, &quot;third class&quot;, &quot;second class&quot; and &quot;first class&quot; (the order of numbering being the reverse of the number of years in attendance). In the UK first-year university students are sometimes called ''freshers'' early in the academic year; however there are no specific names for those in other years nor for school pupils. Graduate and professional students in the United States are known by their year of study, such as a &quot;second-year medical student&quot; or a &quot;fifth-year doctoral candidate.&quot; Law students are often referred to as &quot;1L&quot;, &quot;2L&quot;, or &quot;3L&quot; rather than &quot;nth-year law students&quot;; similarly medical students are frequently referred to as &quot;M1&quot;, &quot;M2&quot;, &quot;M3&quot;, or &quot;M4&quot;).

While anyone in the US who finishes studying at any educational institution by passing relevant examinations is said to ''graduate'' and to be a ''graduate'', in the UK only degree and above level students can ''graduate''. ''Student'' itself has a wider meaning in AmE, meaning any person of any age studying at any educational institution, whereas in BrE it tends to be used for people studying at a post-secondary educational institution and the term ''pupil'' is widely used for a young person at primary or secondary school.

The names of individual institutions can be confusing. There are several &quot;University High Schools&quot; in the United States that are not affiliated with any post-secondary institutions and cannot grant degrees, and there is one public high school, [[Central High School of Philadelphia]], which does grant bachelor's degrees to the top ten per cent of graduating seniors. British secondary schools occasionally have the word 'college' in their names.

====Politics====
In Britain, political candidates ''stand for election'', while in the US, they ''run for office''. There is virtually no crossover between BrE and AmE in the use of these terms. 

====Transport/Transportation====
Americans refer to ''transportation'' and British people to ''transport''.&lt;ref&gt;Gabay, J. Jonathan (2007) ''Gabay's copywriters' compendium: the definitive professional writer's guide'' Elsevier, Oxford, England, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=emVzMXpBUoIC&amp;pg=PT144 page 144], ISBN 978-0-7506-8320-3&lt;/ref&gt; (''Transportation'' in Britain has traditionally meant the punishment of criminals by deporting them to an overseas penal colony.)

Differences in terminology are especially obvious in the context of [[road]]s. The British term ''[[dual carriageway]]'', in American parlance, would be ''[[divided highway]]''. The ''central reservation'' on a ''motorway'' or ''dual carriageway'' in the UK would be the ''median'' or ''center divide'' on a ''freeway'', ''expressway'', ''highway'' or ''parkway'' in the US. The one-way lanes that make it possible to enter and leave such roads at an intermediate point without disrupting the flow of traffic are known as ''slip roads'' in the UK but US civil engineers call them ''ramps'' and further distinguish between ''on-ramps'' (for entering) and ''off-ramps'' (for leaving). When American engineers speak of ''slip roads'', they are referring to a street that runs alongside the main road (separated by a berm) to allow off-the-highway access to the premises that are there, sometimes also known as a [[frontage road]] – in both the US and UK this is also known as a ''service road''.

In the UK, the term ''outside lane'' refers to the higher-speed ''overtaking lane'' (''passing lane'' in the US) closest to the centre of the road while ''inside lane'' refers to the lane closer to the edge of the road. In the US ''outside lane'' is used only in the context of a turn, in which case it depends in which direction the road is turning (i.e. if the road bends right the left lane is the 'outside lane' but if the road bends left it is the right lane). Both also refer to ''slow'' and ''fast'' lanes (even though all actual traffic speeds may be at or around the legal speed limit).

In the UK ''drink driving'' is against the law whilst in the US the term is ''drunk driving''. The legal term in the US is ''driving while intoxicated'' (DWI) or ''driving under the influence of alcohol'' (DUI). The equivalent legal phrase in the UK is ''drunk in charge of a motor vehicle'' (DIC) or more commonly ''driving with excess alcohol''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Highwaycode/DG_069870|title=Highway Code: Directgov—Travel and transport|publisher=[[Directgov]]|accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific [[auto parts]] and transport terms have different names in the two dialects, for example:&lt;br&gt;

====Television====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
In American television the episodes of a programme (AmE ''program'') first broadcast in a particular year constitute a ''season'', while the entire run of the programme – which may span several seasons – is called a ''series''. In British television, on the other hand, the word ''series'' may apply to the episodes of a programme in one particular year, for example, &quot;The 1998 series of ''[[Grange Hill]]''&quot;, as well as to the entire run.
The term ''telecast'', meaning television broadcast, is not used in British English. A television programme would be ''broadcast'', ''aired'' or ''shown''.

====Levels of buildings====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
There are also variations in [[Storey|floor numbering]] between the US and UK. In most countries, including the UK, the &quot;first floor&quot; is one above the entrance level while the entrance level is the &quot;ground floor&quot;. In the US the ground floor is considered the first floor. In a British lift one would press the &quot;G&quot; or &quot;0&quot; button to return to the ground floor whereas in an American elevator, one would push the &quot;1&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, or &quot;L&quot; (for Lobby) button to return to the ground floor. The &quot;L&quot; button in a British lift would take you to the lower ground floor (i.e. the floor below ground, the basement), which may also be numbered &quot;−1&quot; (minus one).

American (AmE) ''apartment buildings'' / (BrE) ''blocks of flats'' frequently are exceptions to this rule. The ground floor often contains the lobby and parking area for the tenants, while the numbered floors begin one level above and contain only the flats themselves.

===Units and measurement===
====Numbers====
{{See also|Names of numbers in English}}

When saying or writing out numbers, the British insert an ''and'' before the tens and units, as in ''one hundred and sixty-two'' or ''two thousand and three''. In America it is considered correct to drop the ''and'', as in ''one hundred sixty-two'' or ''two thousand three''.

Some American schools teach students to pronounce decimally written fractions (for example, ''.5'') as though they were longhand fractions (''five tenths''), such as ''thirteen and seven tenths'' for 13.7. This formality is often dropped in common speech and is steadily disappearing in instruction in mathematics and science as well as in international American schools. In the UK, 13.7 would be read ''thirteen point seven''.

In counting it is common in both varieties of English to count in hundreds up to 1,900&amp;nbsp;– so ''1,200'' may be ''twelve hundred''. However Americans use this pattern for much higher numbers than is the norm in British English, referring to twenty-four hundred where British English would most often use two thousand four hundred. Even below 2,000, Americans are more likely than the British are to read numbers like 1,234 as ''twelve hundred thirty-four'', instead of ''one thousand two hundred and thirty-four''. In BrE it is also common to use phrases such as ''three and a half thousand'' for 3,500 whereas in AmE this construction is almost never used for numbers under a million.

In the case of years, however, ''twelve thirty-four'' would be the norm on both sides of the Atlantic for the year 1234. The year 2000 and years beyond it are read as ''two thousand'', ''two thousand (and) one'' and the like by both British and American speakers. For years after 2009, ''twenty ten'', ''twenty twelve'' etc. are becoming common.

For the house number (or bus number, etc.) 272, British people tend to say ''two seven two'' while Americans tend to say ''two seventy-two''.

There is also a historical difference between [[Long and short scales|billions]], trillions and so forth. Americans use ''billion'' to mean one thousand million (1,000,000,000), whereas in the UK, until the latter part of the 20th century, it was used to mean one million million (1,000,000,000,000).{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2011}} In 1974 the British prime minister, Harold Wilson, told the House of Commons that UK government statistics would now use the short scale; followed by the Chancellor, Denis Healey, in 1975, that the treasury would now adopt the US billion version.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2011}} One thousand million was sometimes described as a ''[[milliard]]'', the definition adopted by most other European languages.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2011}} However the 'American' version has since been adopted for all published writing and the word ''milliard'' is obsolete in English, as are ''[[Billiard (number)|billiard]]'' (but not ''[[billiards]]'', the game), ''[[trilliard]]'' and so on.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2011}} All major British publications and broadcasters, including the BBC, which long used ''thousand million'' to avoid ambiguity, now use ''billion'' to mean thousand million.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2011}}

Many people have no direct experience of manipulating numbers this large, and many non-American readers may interpret ''billion'' as 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; (even if they are young enough to have been taught otherwise at school); moreover usage of the &quot;long&quot; billion is standard in some non-English speaking countries. For these reasons, defining the word may be advisable when writing for the public. See [[long and short scales]] for a more detailed discussion of the evolution of these terms in English and other languages.

When referring to the numeral [[0 (number)|0]], British people would normally use ''nought'', ''oh'', or ''zero'', although ''nil'' is common in sports scores. Americans use the term ''zero'' most frequently; ''oh'' is also often used (though never when the quantity in question is nothing), and occasionally slang terms such as ''zilch'' or ''zip''. Phrases such as ''the team won two–zip'' or ''the team leads the series two–nothing'' are heard when reporting sports scores. In the case of [[association football]]—known as &quot;football&quot; in Britain and &quot;soccer&quot; in America—Americans will sometimes use &quot;nil&quot; as in Britain, although this usage is mostly confined to soccer journalists and hardcore fans and is not universal among either group. The digit 0, for example, when a phone or account number is being read aloud, is nearly always pronounced ''oh'' in both language varieties for the sake of convenience. In the internet age the use of the term ''oh'' can cause certain inconveniences when one is referencing an email address, causing confusion as to whether the character in question is a zero or the letter O.

When reading numbers in a sequence, such as a telephone or serial number, British people will usually use the terms ''double'' followed by the repeated number. Hence [[James Bond|007]] is ''double oh seven''. Exceptions are the emergency telephone number [[9-9-9|999]], which is always ''nine nine nine'' and the apocalyptic &quot;[[Number of the Beast]]&quot;, which is always ''six six six''. In the US [[9-1-1|911]] (the US emergency telephone number) is usually read ''nine one one'', while 9/11 (in reference to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]]) is usually read ''nine eleven''.

====Monetary amounts====
* Monetary amounts in the range of one to two major currency units are often spoken differently. In AmE one may say ''a dollar fifty'' or ''a pound eighty'', whereas in BrE these amounts would be expressed ''one dollar fifty'' and ''one pound eighty''. For amounts over a dollar an American will generally either drop denominations or give both dollars and cents, as in ''two-twenty'' or ''two dollars and twenty cents'' for $2.20. An American would not say ''two dollars twenty''. On the other hand, in BrE, ''two pounds twenty'' would be the most common form.
* It is more common to hear a British-English speaker say ''one thousand two hundred dollars'' than ''a thousand and two hundred dollars'', although the latter construct is common in AmE. The term ''twelve hundred dollars'', popular in AmE, is frequently used in BrE but only for exact multiples of 100 up to 1900. Speakers of BrE very rarely hear amounts over 1900 expressed in hundreds, for example twenty-three hundred.
* In BrE, particularly in television or radio advertisements, integers can be pronounced individually in the expression of amounts. For example, ''on sale for £399'' might be expressed ''on sale for three nine nine'', though the full ''Three hundred and ninety-nine pounds'' is at least as common. An American advertiser would almost always say ''on sale for three ninety-nine''. In British English the latter pronunciation implies a value in pence, so ''three ninety-nine'' would be understood as £3.99.
* The BrE slang term ''quid'' is roughly equivalent to the AmE ''buck'' and both are often used in the two respective dialects for round amounts, as in ''fifty quid'' for £50 and ''twenty bucks'' for $20. ''A hundred and fifty grand'' in either dialect could refer to £150,000 or $150,000 depending on context. ''Quid'' was formerly also used in Ireland for the punt and today is used for the euro. &quot;Quid&quot; does not (generally) have a plural form but &quot;buck&quot; does (aside from the expression &quot;quids in&quot; - meaning having made or won a lot of money).
* A user of AmE may hand-write the mixed monetary amount $3.24 as $3&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; or $3&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;24&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (often seen for extra clarity on a check); BrE users will always write this as £3.24. In all cases there may or may not be a space after the currency symbol, or the currency symbols may be omitted depending on context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsa.org.uk/mediacentre/press/cheque_sept.htm BSA changes to cheque writing] see end of numbered item 9&lt;/ref&gt;
*In order to make explicit the amount in words on a check, Americans write ''three and {{Frac|24|100}}'' (using this [[Solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] construction or with a horizontal division line): they do not need to write the word ''dollars'' as it is usually already printed on the check. On a cheque UK residents would write ''three pounds and 24 pence'', ''three pounds {{Unicode|‒}} 24'' or ''three pounds {{Unicode|‒}} 24p'', since the currency unit is not preprinted. To make unauthorized amendment difficult, it is useful to have an expression terminator even when a whole number of dollars/pounds is in use: thus Americans would write ''three and {{Frac|00|100}}'' or ''three and {{Frac|no|100}}'' on a three-dollar check (so that it cannot easily be changed to, for example, ''three million'') and UK residents would write ''three pounds only''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsa.org.uk/mediacentre/press/cheque_sept.htm] see end of numbered item 9&lt;/ref&gt;
* The term ''[[pound sign]]'' in BrE always refers to the currency symbol £ whereas in AmE ''pound sign'' means the [[number sign]], which the British call the ''hash'' symbol, #. (From the 1960s to the 1990s the British telephone company, [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|the GPO]] and its successors [[Post Office Telecommunications]] and [[BT Group|British Telecom]] referred to this as ''gate'' on telephone keypads.)
*In spoken BrE the word ''pound'' is sometimes colloquially used for the plural as well. For example ''three pound forty'' and ''twenty pound a week'' are both heard in British English. Some other currencies do not change in the plural; yen and rand being examples. This is in addition to normal adjectival use, as in ''a twenty-pound-a-week pay-rise''. The [[Linguistic issues concerning the euro#English|euro]] most often takes a regular plural -s in practice despite the EU dictum that it should remain invariable in formal contexts; the invariable usage is more common in Ireland, where it is the official currency.
* In BrE the use of ''p'' instead of ''[[pence]]'' is common in spoken usage. Each of the following has equal legitimacy: ''3 pounds 12 p''; ''3 pounds and 12 p''; ''3 pounds 12 pence''; ''3 pounds and 12 pence''; as well as just ''8 p'' or ''8 pence''.
* AmE uses words such as ''[[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]]'', ''[[Dime (United States coin)|dime]]'', and ''[[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]'' for small coins. In BrE the usual usage is ''a 10-pence piece'' or ''a 10p piece'' or simply ''a 10p'', for any coin below £1, but ''pound coin'' and ''two-pound coin''. BrE did have [[Coins of the pound sterling#Slang and everyday usage|specific words for a number of coins]] before [[Decimal Day|decimalisation]]. Terms such as ''half crown'', ''florin'', ''bob'' and ''tanner'' for pre-decimalization coins are still familiar to older BrE speakers but they are not used for modern coins. In older terms like ''two-bob bit'' and ''threepenny bit'', the word ''bit'' had common usage before decimalization similar to that of ''piece'' today.

====Dates====
Dates are usually written differently in the short (numerical) form. Christmas Day 2000, for example, is 25/12/00 or 25.12.00 in the UK and 12/25/00 in the US, although the formats 25/12/2000, 25.12.2000, and 12/25/2000 now have more currency than they had before the [[Year 2000 problem]]. Occasionally other formats are encountered, such as the [[ISO 8601]] 2000-12-25, popular among programmers, scientists and others seeking to avoid ambiguity, and to make [[alphanumeric]]al order coincide with [[chronological]] order. The difference in short-form date order can lead to misunderstanding. For example 06/04/05 could mean either June 4, 2005 (if read as US format), 6 April 2005 (if seen as in UK format) or even 5 April 2006 if taken to be an older ISO 8601-style format where 2-digit years were allowed.

A consequence of the different short-form of dates is that in the UK, many people are reluctant to refer to &quot;[[9/11]]&quot;, although its meaning is instantly understood. On the BBC &quot;September the 11th&quot; is generally used in preference to 9/11. However 9/11 is commonplace in the British press to refer to the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]].

When using the word of the month rather than the number to write a date for example, April 21, both that and 21 April are used in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;
Sources for the April 21 format:
*The Times [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/] and The Sunday Times [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/newspapers/sunday_times/?days=Sunday]
*Daily Mail [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html] and Mail on Sunday [http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/mailonsunday/index.html]
*The Herald [http://www.theherald.co.uk/] and The Sunday Herald [http://www.sundayherald.com/]
*Swansea Evening Post [http://www.thisissouthwales.co.uk/index.jsp]
*Western Telegraph [http://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/]
*Ulster Herald [http://www.nwipp-newspapers.com/UH/free/294262496752774.php]&lt;/ref&gt; but as a rule only April 21 would be seen in the U.S. British usage often changes the day from an integer to an ordinal, for instance April 21st or 21st (of) April.

Phrases such as the following are common in Britain but are generally unknown in the US: &quot;A week today&quot;, &quot;a week tomorrow&quot;, &quot;a week on Tuesday&quot; and &quot;Tuesday week&quot; (this is found in central Texas), &quot;a fortnight on Friday&quot;(the latter referring to two weeks after &quot;next Friday&quot;). In the US the standard construction is &quot;a week from today&quot;, &quot;a week from tomorrow&quot;, etc. BrE speakers may also say &quot;Thursday last&quot; or &quot;Thursday gone&quot; where AmE would prefer &quot;last Thursday&quot;. &quot;I'll see you (on) Thursday coming&quot; or &quot;Let's meet this coming Thursday&quot; in BrE refer to a meeting later this week, while &quot;Not until Thursday next&quot;.

====Time====
The [[24-hour clock]] (''18:00'' or ''1800'') is considered normal in the UK and Europe in many applications including air, rail and bus timetables; it is largely unused in the US outside of military, police, aviation and medical applications.

15 minutes after the hour is called ''quarter past'' in British usage and ''a quarter after'' or, less commonly, ''a quarter past'' in American usage. 15 minutes before the hour is usually called ''quarter to'' in British usage and ''a quarter of'', ''a quarter to'' or ''a quarter 'til'' in American usage; the form ''a quarter to'' is associated with parts of the [[Northern United States]], while ''a quarter 'til'' is found chiefly in the [[Appalachia]]n region.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Thirty minutes after the hour is commonly called ''half past'' in both BrE and AmE; ''half after'' used to be more common in the US. In informal British speech, the preposition is sometimes omitted, so that 5:30 may be referred to as ''half five''. The AmE formations ''top of the hour'' and ''bottom of the hour'' are not used in BrE. Forms such as ''eleven forty'' are common in both dialects.

====Weight====

In British usage, human body weight is typically expressed in [[stone (Imperial mass)|stones]] (equal to 14 [[Pounds (mass)|pounds]]). People normally describe themselves as weighing, for example, &quot;11 stone 4&quot; (11 stones and 4 pounds) and not &quot;158 pounds&quot; (the conventional way of expressing the same weight in the United States). Less commonly, people in Britain may  also choose to express their weight in terms of [[Kilogram|kilograms]].

When used as the unit of measurement the plural form of ''stone'' is correctly ''stone'' (as in, &quot;11 stone&quot;). When describing the units, the correct plural is ''stones'' (as in, &quot;Please enter your weight in stones and pounds&quot;).

===Greetings===
{{Main|Holiday greetings}}
When Christmas is explicitly mentioned in a greeting, the universal phrasing in North America is ''Merry Christmas''. In the UK ''Happy Christmas'' is also heard. It is increasingly common for Americans to say ''Happy Holidays'', referring to all winter holidays (Christmas, [[Yule]], [[New Year's Day]], [[Hanukkah]], [[Diwali]], [[St Lucia Day]] and [[Kwanzaa]]) while avoiding any specific religious reference, though this is rarely, if ever, heard in the UK and often viewed with disdain. ''Season's Greetings'' is a common phrase printed in greetings cards in both America and Britain.

===Idiosyncratic differences===
====Figures of speech====
Both BrE and AmE use the expression &quot;I couldn't care less&quot; to mean the speaker does not care at all. 　Some speakers of AmE use it interchangeably with &quot;I ''could'' care less&quot;.

In both areas, saying, &quot;I don't mind&quot; often means, &quot;I'm not annoyed&quot; (for example, by someone's smoking), while &quot;I don't care&quot; often means, &quot;The matter is trivial or boring&quot;. However in answering a question such as &quot;Tea or coffee?&quot;, if either alternative is equally acceptable an American may answer, &quot;I don't care&quot; while a British person may answer, &quot;I don't mind&quot;. Either sounds odd to the other.

In BrE the phrase ''I can't be arsed (to do something)'' is a very recent vulgar equivalent to the British or American ''I can't be bothered (to do it)''. To non-BrE speakers this may be confused with the Southern English pronunciation of ''I can't be asked (to do that thing)'', which sounds either defiantly rude or nonsensical.

Old BrE often uses the exclamation &quot;No fear!&quot; where current AmE has &quot;No way!&quot; An example from [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]:

:Q.: Wilt thou be baptized in this faith?&lt;br /&gt;A.: No fear!
:— from ''Creed or chaos? : And other essays in popular theology''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayers|first=Dorothy L|title=Creed or chaos? : And other essays in popular theology|year=1947|publisher=Methuen|location=London|page=23|oclc=4711550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This usage may confuse users of AmE, who are likely to interpret and even use &quot;No fear!&quot; as enthusiastic willingness to move forward.

====Equivalent idioms====

A number of English idioms that have essentially the same meaning show lexical differences between the British and the American version; for instance:

In some cases, the American variant is also used in BrE, or vice versa.

==Writing==
===Spelling===
{{Main|American and British English spelling differences}}
Before the early 18th century [[English spelling]] was not standardized. Different standards became noticeable after the publishing of influential [[dictionary|dictionaries]]. For the most part current BrE spellings follow those of [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755). Among the advocates of spelling reform in England, the influences of those who preferred the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman]] (or Anglo-French) spellings of certain words proved decisive. In many cases AmE deviated in the 19th century from mainstream British spelling; on the other hand it has also often retained older forms. Many of the now characteristic AmE spellings were introduced, although often not created, by [[Noah Webster]] in his ''[[An American Dictionary of the English Language]]'' of 1828. Webster was a strong proponent of [[spelling reform]] for reasons both philological and nationalistic. Many other spelling changes proposed in the US by Webster himself and by the [[Simplified Spelling Board]] in the early 20th century never caught on. Subsequent spelling adjustments in the UK had little effect on present-day US spelling, and vice versa.

===Punctuation===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of British words not widely used in the United States]] --&gt;
* '''Full stops/Periods in abbreviations''': Americans tend to write ''Mr.'', ''Mrs.'', ''St.'', ''Dr.''; the British will most often write ''Mr'', ''Mrs'', ''St'', ''Dr'', following the rule that a full stop/period is used only when the last letter of the abbreviation is not the last letter of the complete word. This kind of abbreviation is known as a ''contraction'' in the UK. The use of periods after most abbreviations can also be found in the UK, although publications generally tend to eschew the use of American punctuation. Unit symbols such as ''kg'' and ''Hz'' are never punctuated.
* Both styles hyphenate multiple-word adjectives (for example, &quot;a ''first-class'' ticket&quot;).
* '''[[Quotation mark|Quoting]]''': Americans begin their quotations with double quotation marks (&quot;) and use single quotation marks (') for quotations within quotations. BrE usage varies, with some authoritative sources such as ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[The Times]]'' recommending the same usage as in the US,&lt;ref&gt;Economist Staff (1996). &quot;American and British English&quot;. ''The Economist Style Guide'' (Fourth ed.). London: Hamish Hamilton Ltd pp. 85. [[Special:BookSources/0241135567|ISBN 0241135567]]. Tim Austin, Richard Dixon (2003) ''The Times Style and Usage Guide''. London: HarperCollins. [[Special:BookSources/0007145055|ISBN 0007145055]]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other authoritative sources, such as ''[[The King's English]]'', recommend single quotation marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/116/406.html |title=Quotation Marks. Fowler, H. W. 1908. The King's English |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In journals and newspapers, quotation mark double/single use depends on the individual publication's [[house style]]
* '''Quotation Usage''': Americans occasionally place [[comma]]s and periods inside quotation marks. Specific exceptions are made only for parenthetical citation and cases in which the addition of a period or comma could create confusion, such as the quotation of web addresses or certain types of data strings. In both styles, question marks and exclamation marks are placed inside the quotation marks if they belong to the quotation and outside otherwise. With narration of direct speech, both styles retain punctuation inside the quotation marks, with a full stop changing into a comma if followed by explanatory text, also known as a dialogue tag. Americans tend to apply quotations when signifying doubt of veracity (sarcastically or seriously), to imply another meaning to a word or to imply a cynical take on a paraphrased quotation, without punctuation at all.
** Carefree means &quot;free from care or anxiety.&quot; (American style)
** Carefree means 'free from care or anxiety'. (British style)**
** &quot;Hello, John,&quot; I said. (Both styles)
** Did you say, &quot;I'm shot&quot;? No, I said, &quot;Why not?&quot; (Both styles)
** To insert an ampersand, hold &quot;shift&quot; and type the number &quot;7.&quot; (American grammar—period inside quotes always. See Gregg English Grammar Manual.)
** Yeah, you really &quot;showed&quot; him. (American style)
** My &quot;friend&quot; just told the whole school about my &quot;problem.&quot; (American style)
** She told me that I was &quot;too nice.&quot; (American style)
:The American style was established for typographical reasons, a historical legacy from the use of the handset [[printing press]]. It is used by most American newspapers, publishing houses and style guides in the United States and Canada (including the Modern Language Association's ''[[MLA Style Manual]]'', the American Psychological Association's ''[[APA style|APA Publication Manual]]'', the University of Chicago's ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', the American Institute of Physics's ''AIP Style Manual'', the American Medical Association's ''AMA Manual of Style'', the American Political Science Association's ''APSA Style Manual'', the [[Associated Press]]' ''The AP Guide to Punctuation'' and the [[Public Works and Government Services Canada|Canadian Public Works']] ''The Canadian Style'').&lt;ref&gt;Other style guides and reference volumes include: ''U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual'' (2008, p. 217), US Department of Education's ''IES Style Guide'' (2005, p. 43), ''The Canadian Style: A Guide to Writing and Editing'' (1997, p. 148), ''International Committee of Medical Journal Editors'', ''International Reading Association Style Guide'', ''American Dialect Society'', Association of Legal Writing Directors' ''ALWD Citation Manual'', ''The McGraw-Hill Desk Reference'' by K.

:''[[Hart's Rules]]'' and the ''[[Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors]]'' call the British style &quot;new&quot; quoting. It is also similar to the use of quotation marks in many other languages (including Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian, Catalan, Dutch and German). A few US professional societies whose professions frequently employ various non-word characters, such as chemistry and computer programming, use the British form in their style guides (see ''ACS Style Guide''). According to the ''[[Jargon File]]'', American [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]]s switched to what they later discovered to be the British quotation system because placing a period inside a quotation mark can change the meaning of data strings that are meant to be typed character-for-character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/writing-style.html |title=The Jargon File, Chapter 5. Hacker Writing Style |publisher=Catb.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It may be noted that the current American system places periods and commas inside the quotes in these cases anyway.)

* '''Parentheses/brackets''':
:In British English, &quot;( )&quot; marks are referred to as brackets, whereas &quot;[ ]&quot; are called square brackets and &quot;{ }&quot; are called curly brackets. In American English &quot;( )&quot; marks are parentheses (singular parenthesis) whereas &quot;[ ]&quot; are called brackets. In both countries, standard usage is to place punctuation outside the parenthesis:
:* &quot;I am going to the store (I hope it is still open).&quot;

===Titles and headlines===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
Use of [[capitalization]] varies.

Sometimes the words in titles of publications and newspaper headlines as well as chapter and section headings are capitalized in the same manner as in normal sentences ([[sentence case]]). That is, only the first letter of the first word is capitalized, along with [[proper noun]]s, etc.

However publishers sometimes require additional words in titles and headlines to have the initial capital, for added [[emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], as it is often perceived as appearing more professional. In AmE this is common in titles but less so in newspaper headlines. The exact rules differ between publishers and are often ambiguous; a typical approach is to capitalize all words other than short [[Article (grammar)|articles]], [[preposition]]s, and [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]]. This should probably be regarded as a common stylistic difference rather than a linguistic difference, as neither form would be considered incorrect or unusual in either the UK or the US. Many British [[tabloid newspapers]] (such as ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'', ''[[The Daily Sport]]'', ''[[News of the World]]'') use fully capitalised headlines for impact as opposed to readability (for example, BERLIN WALL FALLS or BIRD FLU PANIC). On the other hand the [[broadsheet]]s (such as ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Times]]'', and ''[[The Independent]]'') usually follow the sentence style of having only the first letter of the first word capitalized.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Atomic Semantics''' is a term which describes the guarantees provided by a [[data register]] shared by several [[central processing unit|processors]] in a [[parallel machine]] or in a network of computers working together.

Atomic semantics are defined for a variable with a single writer but multiple readers. These
semantics are very strong: they guarantee that the read and write operations to the variable behave exactly as if they happened instantaneously in some point in time which is within the actual time where the operation took place.

==References==
Atomic semantics are defined formally in Lamport's &quot;On Interprocess Communication&quot; Distributed Computing 1, 2 (1986), 77-101. (Also appeared as SRC Research Report 8).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Antarctic Circumpolar Current.jpg|right|thumb|251px|The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is the strongest current system in the world oceans, the one that links the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific basins.]] 

The '''Antarctic Circumpolar Current''' ('''ACC''') is an [[ocean current]] that flows from west to east around [[Antarctica]]. An alternative name for the ACC is the '''West Wind Drift'''. The ACC is the dominant circulation feature of the [[Southern Ocean]] and, at approximately 125 [[Sverdrup]]s, the largest ocean current.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oceancurrents.rsmas.miami.edu/southern/antarctic-cp.html Surface Currents in the Southern Ocean]&lt;/ref&gt; It keeps warm ocean waters away from Antarctica, enabling that continent to maintain its huge [[ice sheet]].

The ACC has been known to sailors for centuries; it greatly speeds up any voyages from west to east, but makes sailing extremely difficult from east to west; though this is mostly due to the prevailing [[Westerlies|westerly winds]]. The circumstances preceding the [[mutiny on the Bounty]] and [[Jack London]]'s story &quot;Make Westing&quot; poignantly illustrated the difficulty it caused for mariners seeking to round [[Cape Horn]] on the clipper ship route between [[New York]] and [[California]]. The [[clipper route]], which is the fastest sailing route around the world, follows the ACC around three continental capes - [[Cape of Good Hope]] ([[Africa]]), [[Southeast Cape]] ([[Australia]]) and Cape Horn ([[South America]]).

The current creates two [[Antarctic gyres]].

== Structure ==
The ACC connects the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Indian Ocean]] basins, and serves as a principal pathway of exchange between these basins. The current is strongly constrained by [[landform]] and [[bathymetric]] features. To trace it starting arbitrarily at [[South America]], it flows through the [[Drake Passage]] between South America and the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] and then is split by the [[Scotia Arc]] to the east, with a shallow warm branch flowing to the north in the [[Falkland Current]] and a deeper branch passing through the Arc more to the east before also turning to the north. Passing through the Indian Ocean, the current is split by the [[Kerguelen Plateau]] in the Indian Ocean, and then moving northward again. Deflection is also seen as it passes over the [[mid-ocean ridge]] in the Southeast Pacific.

The current is accompanied by a number of [[weather front]]s. The northern boundary of the ACC is defined by the [[Subtropical Front]]. This marks the boundary between warm, salty subtropical waters (generally with a [[salinity]] of greater than 34.9 parts per thousand) and fresher, cooler subpolar waters. Moving southward we find the Subantarctic Front, along which much of the ACC transport is carried, which is defined as the latitude at which a subsurface salinity minimum or a thick layer of unstratified [[Subantarctic Mode Water]] first appears. Still further south lies the [[Polar front]], which is marked by a transition to very cold, relatively fresh, Antarctic Surface Water at the surface. Further south still is the Southern Boundary front, which is determined as the point where very dense [[abyssal zone|abyssal waters]] upwell to within a few hundred meters of the surface. The bulk of the transport is carried in the middle two fronts. The total transport of the ACC at Drake Passage is estimated to be around 135 [[Sverdrup]]s (135,000,000 m³/s), or about 135 times the transport of all the world's rivers combined. There is a relatively small addition of flow in the Indian Ocean, with the transport south of [[Tasmania]] reaching around 147 Sv, at which point the current is probably the largest on the planet.

==Dynamics==
The Circumpolar Current is driven by the strong westerly [[wind]]s which are found in the latitudes of the Southern Ocean. 

In latitudes where there are continents, winds blowing on light surface water can simply pile up light water against these continents. But in the Southern Ocean, the momentum imparted to the surface waters cannot be offset in this way. Different theories of the Circumpolar Current balance the momentum imparted by the winds in different ways. The increasing eastward momentum imparted by the winds causes water parcels to drift outwards from the axis of the Earth's rotation (in other words, northward) as a result of the [[Coriolis force]]. This northward transport is balanced by a southward, pressure-driven flow below the depths of the major ridge systems. Some theories connect these flows directly, implying that there is significant upwelling of dense deep waters within the Southern Ocean, transformation of these waters into light surface waters, and a transformation of waters in the opposite direction to the north. Such theories link the magnitude of the Circumpolar Current with the global [[thermohaline circulation]], particularly the properties of the North Atlantic. 

Alternatively, [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)#Mesoscale ocean eddies|ocean eddies]], the oceanic equivalent of atmospheric storms, or the large-scale meanders of the Circumpolar Current may directly transport momentum downwards in the water column. This is because such air flows can produce a net southward flow in the troughs and a net northward flow over the ridges without requiring any transformation of density. In practice both the thermohaline and the eddy/meander mechanisms are likely to be important.

The current flows at a rate of about four km per hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;brittlestar&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-05/coml-ema051208.php |title=Explorers marvel at 'Brittlestar City' on seamount in powerful current swirling around Antarctica |accessdate=2008-06-06 |date=2008-05-18 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have indicated that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current varies with time. Evidence of this is the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Wave]], a periodic [[oscillation]] that affects the climate of much of the southern hemisphere. There is also the [[Antarctic oscillation]], which involves changes in the location and strength of Antarctic winds. Trends in the Antarctic Oscillation have been hypothesized to account for an increase in the transport of the Circumpolar Current over the past two decades.

== Formation ==

Published estimates of the onset of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current vary, but it is commonly considered to have started at the [[Eocene]]/[[Oligocene]] boundary. The isolation of Antarctica and formation of the ACC occurred with the openings of the [[Tasmanian Seaway]] and the [[Drake Passage]]. The Tasmanian Seaway separates East Antarctica and Australia, and is reported to have opened to water circulation 33.5 Ma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/Ben/Publications/09_ppp_hassold.pdf Noralynn J.C. Hassold, David K. Rea, Ben A. van der Pluijm, Josep M. Parés, &quot;A physical record of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current: late Miocene to recent slowing of abyssal circulation&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The timing of the opening of the Drake Passage, between South America and the Antarctic Peninsula, is more disputed;  [[tectonic]] and sediment evidence show that it could have been open as early as pre 34 Ma,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earth-prints.org/bitstream/2122/2184/1/1214.pdf Peter F. Barker, Gabriel M. Filippelli, Fabio Florindo, Ellen E. Martin, Howard D. Scher, &quot;Onset and Role of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; estimates of the opening of the Drake passage are between 20 and 40 Ma.&lt;ref&gt;Siegert et al. &quot;Recent Advances in Understanding Antarctic Climate Evolution&quot;. ''Antarctic Science''. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The isolation of Antarctica by the current is credited by many researchers with causing the [[glaciation]] of Antarctica and global cooling in the [[Eocene]] epoch. Oceanic models have shown that the opening of these two passages limited polar heat convergence and caused a cooling of sea surface temperatures by several degrees; other models have shown that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels also played a significant role in the glaciation of Antarctica &lt;sup&gt;[5].&lt;/sup&gt;

== Phytoplankton ==
Antarctic sea ice cycles seasonally, in February–March the amount of sea ice is lowest, and in August–September the sea ice is at its greatest extent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap11/sea_ice.html B. Geerts, &quot;Antarctic sea ice: seasonal and long-term changes&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ice levels have been monitored by satellite since 1973. Upwelling of deep water under the sea ice brings substantial amounts of nutrients. As the ice melts, the melt water provides stability and the critical depth is well below the mixing depth, which allows for a positive net [[primary production]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles B. Miller,  ''Biological Oceanography'', Blackwell Publishing 2004. Pg 219&lt;/ref&gt;  As the sea ice recedes epontic algae dominate the first phase of the bloom, and a strong bloom dominate by diatoms follows the ice melt south &lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;. 

Another phytoplankton bloom occurs more to the north near the [[antarctic convergence]], here nutrients are present from  [[thermohaline circulation]]. Phytoplankton blooms are dominated by diatoms and grazed by copepods in the open ocean, and by krill closer to the continent. Diatom production continues through the summer, and populations of krill are sustained, bringing large stocks of whales, seals, and fish to the area &lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;. 

Phytoplankton blooms are believed to be limited by irradiance in the austral (southern hemisphere) spring, and by biologically available iron in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agu.org/journals/ABS/2007/2006JC003816.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the biology in the area occurs along the major fronts of the current, the Subtropical, SubAntarctic, and the Antarctic Polar fronts, these are areas associated with well defined temperature changes.&lt;ref&gt;http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/oceancolor/additional/science-focus/locus/tutorials/module6.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Size and distribution of phytoplankton are also related to fronts. Microphytoplankton (&gt;20μm) are found at fronts and at sea ice boundaries, while [[nanophytoplankton]] (&lt;20μm) are found between fronts.&lt;ref&gt;Knox, G.A. Biology of the Southern Ocean. CRC Press 2007. pg 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of phytoplankton stocks in the southern sea have shown that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is dominated by diatoms, while the [[Weddell Sea]] has abundant [[coccolithophorid]]s and silicoflagellates. Surveys of the SW [[Indian Ocean]] have shown phytoplankton group variation based on their location relative to the Polar Front, with [[diatom]]s dominating South of the front, and dinoflagellates and [[flagellates]] in higher populations North of the front &lt;sup&gt;[10].&lt;/sup&gt;

Some research has been done on Antarctic phytoplankton as a [[carbon sink]]. Areas of open water left from ice melt are good areas for phytoplankton blooms. The phytoplankton takes carbon from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. As the blooms die and sink, the carbon can be stored in sediments for thousands of years. This natural carbon sink is estimated to remove 3.5 million tonnes from the ocean each year. 3.5 million tonnes of carbon taken from the ocean and atmosphere is equivalent to 12.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091109121117.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies ==
An expedition in May 2008 by 19 scientists studied the geology and biology of eight Macquarie Ridge sea mounts, as well as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to investigate the effects of climate change of the southern Ocean. The circumpolar current merges the waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans and carries up to 150 times the volume of water flowing in all of the world's rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;brittlestar&quot; /&gt; After studying the circumpolar current it is clear that it strongly influences regional and global climate{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this statement.|date=February 2011}} as well as underwater biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080519/ap_on_sc/antarctica_tiny_starfish;_ylt=AsdzU8nYPux2h_hkZhQx4GGs0NUE Millions of tiny starfish inhabit undersea volcano - Yahoo!

'''Arbor Day''' (from the Latin ''arbor'', meaning tree) is a [[secular holiday|holiday]] in which individuals and groups are encouraged to plant and care for [[tree]]s. It originated in [[Nebraska City, Nebraska]], [[United States]] during 1872 by [[Julius Sterling Morton|J. Sterling Morton]]. The first Arbor Day was held on April 10, 1872, and an estimated 1 million trees were planted that day.

Many countries now observe a similar holiday. Though usually observed in the spring, the date varies, depending on [[climate]] and suitable planting season.

Birdsey Northrop of [[Connecticut]] was responsible for globalizing it when he visited Japan in 1883 and delivered his Arbor Day and Village Improvement message. In that same year, the American Forestry Association made Northrup the Chairman of the committee to campaign for Arbor Day nationwide. He also brought his enthusiasm for Arbor Day to Australia, Canada and Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arbor Day&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=&quot;Birdsey Grant Northrop&quot;|url=http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/forestry/urban_forestry/arborday.pdf|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbor Day reached its height of popularity on its 125th anniversary in 1997, when David J. Wright, noticed that a Nebraska non profit called the [[National Arbor Day Foundation]] had taken the name of the holiday and commercialized it for their own use as a [[trademark]] for their publication &quot;Arbor Day,&quot; so he countered their efforts, launched a website, and trademarked it for &quot;public use celebrations&quot; and defended the matter in a federal district court in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=''[[Seattle Times]]'' |title=As Arbor Day Nears, A Dispute Takes Root between 2 Groups |author=Frank Clifford |date=1997-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; to insure it was judged as property of the [[public domain]], the case was settled in October 1999. Today anyone can use the term &quot;Arbor Day&quot; as well as hold their own Arbor Day celebration.

==Observances==
===Australia===
[[Image:Australia (orthographic projection).svg|right|thumb|151px]]
July 28 is N Tree Planting Day for schools throughout Australia and 30 July is National Tree Planting Day for the rest of the Nation. Many states have Arbor Day although only Victoria has Arbor Week, which was suggested by Premier [[Dick Hamer]] in the 1980s. Arbor Day has been observed in Australia since 20 June 1889.

Arbor Day (植樹節) has been a traditional [[Holidays in Taiwan|holiday]] in the [[Republic of China]] since 1927. In 1914, the founder of the [[Nanjing Agricultural University|agricultural college at Nanking University]] suggested to the now-defunct Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry that China should imitate the practice in the United States of Arbor Day. The holiday would be held the same day as the [[Qingming Festival]]. However, for unknown reasons, the suggestion was not made through the formal process, so nothing came from this original request. After the successful conclusion of the [[Northern Expedition]], the now-defunct Ministry of Agriculture and Minerals formally petitioned the [[Executive Yuan]] to establish Arbor Day to commemorate the passing of [[Sun Yat-sen|Dr. Sun Yat-sen]], the Father of Modern China. He had been a major advocate of afforestation in his life, because it would increase [[Three Principles of the People|people's livelihoods]]. The Executive Yuan approved Arbor Day in the spirit of Dr. Sun that year and has since been celebrated on March 12 for this purpose.

====People's Republic of China (Mainland China)====
[[Image:Zhishujie China.JPG|thumb|right|Arbor Day 2006 in [[Shunyi]], [[Beijing]].]]
In 1981, the fourth session of the Fifth [[National People's Congress]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] adopted the &quot;Resolution on the unfolding of a nationwide voluntary tree-planting campaign&quot;. This resolution established Arbor Day (植树节) and stipulated that every able-bodied citizen between the ages of 11 and 60 should plant three to five trees per year or do the equivalent amount of work in seedling, cultivation, tree tending or other services. Supporting documentation instructs all units to report population statistics to the local afforestation committees as the basis for workload allocation. Moreover, those failing to do their duty are expected to make up planting requirements, provide funds equivalent to the value of labor required or pay heavy fines. Therefore, the tree-planting campaign is actually compulsory{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}, or at least obligatory (that is, an obligation to the community).

Originally based on the date used to calculate the age of fruit trees for [[Tithe|tithing]] as mandated in [[Leviticus]] 19:23-25, the holiday now is most often observed by planting trees, or raising money to plant trees.&lt;ref name=&quot;JEWFAQ&quot;&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday8.htm ''Judaism 101: Tu B'Shevat].

The campaign by the name 'Tree Day-Plant Your Future' was first organized on 12 March 2008, when an official non-working day was declared and more than 150,000 Macedonians planted 2 million trees in one day (symbolically, one for each citizen). Six million more were planted in November the same year, and another 12,5 million trees in 2009.

Since conference and of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]'s publication ''[[World Festival of Trees]]'', and a resolution of the [[United Nations]] in 1954: &quot;The Conference, recognising the need of arousing mass consciousness of the aesthetic, physical and economic value of trees, recommends a World Festival of Trees to be celebrated annually in each member country on a date suited to local conditions&quot;; it has been adopted by the [[Netherlands]]. In 1957, the National Committee Day of Planting Trees/Foundation of National Festival of Trees (''Nationale Boomplantdag''/''Nationale Boomfeestdag'') was created.

On the third Wednesday in March each year (near the spring equinox), three quarters of Dutch schoolchildren aged 10/11 and Dutch celebrities plant trees. Stichting Nationale Boomfeestdag organizes all the activities in the Netherlands for this day. Some municipalities however plant the trees around 21 September because of the planting season.&lt;ref&gt;Boomfeestdag http://www.boomfeestdag.nl/ the organisations address is Spoorlaan 444 5038 CH TILBURG&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the 50th anniversary was celebrated with special golden jubilee-activities.

===New Zealand===
[[Image:NZL orthographic NaturalEarth.svg|right|thumb|151px]]
[[New Zealand]]'s first Arbor Day planting was in [[Greytown]] in the [[Wairarapa]] on 3 July 1890. The first official celebration took place in [[Wellington]] in August 1892, with the planting of [[pohutukawa]] and [[Norfolk pines]] along Thorndon Esplanade.

Born in 1855, Dr [[Leonard Cockayne]] (generally recognised as the greatest botanist who has lived, worked, and died in New Zealand) worked extensively on native plants throughout New Zealand and wrote many notable botanical texts. Even as early as the 1920s he held a vision for school students of New Zealand to be involved in planting native trees and plants in their school grounds. This vision bore fruit and schools in New Zealand have long planted native trees on '''Arbor Day'''.

Since 1977, New Zealand has celebrated Arbor Day on June 5, which is also [[World Environment Day]], prior to then Arbor Day, in New Zealand, was celebrated on August 4 - which is rather late in the year for tree planting in New Zealand hence the date change.

What the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] ([[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|DOC]]) does for Arbor Day:
Many of DOC's Arbor Day activities focus on ecological restoration projects using native plants to restore habitats that have been damaged or destroyed by humans or invasive pests and weeds. There are great restoration projects underway around New Zealand and many organisations including community groups, landowners, conservation organisations, iwi, volunteers, schools, local businesses, nurseries and councils are involved in them. These projects are part of a vision to protect and restore the indigenous biodiversity.

Arbor Day was founded in 1872 by [[Julius Sterling Morton|J. Sterling Morton]] in [[Nebraska City]], [[Nebraska]]. By the 1920s, each state in the United States had passed public laws that stipulated a certain day to be Arbor Day or Arbor and Bird Day observance.

The national holiday is celebrated every year on the last Friday in April; in [[Nebraska]], it is a [[civic holiday]]. Each state celebrates its own state holiday. The customary observance is to plant a tree. On the first Arbor Day, April 10, 1872, an estimated one million trees were planted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arborday.org/arborday/history.cfm Arborday.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Alfred Jules &quot;Freddie&quot; Ayer''' (29 October 1910, London – 27 June 1989, London)&lt;ref name=&quot;BioDict20CPhil&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers | year=1996 | publisher=Routledge | location=London | pages=37–39 | isbn=0415060435}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British [[philosopher]] known for his promotion of [[logical positivism]], particularly in his books ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'' (1936) and ''The Problem of Knowledge'' (1956).

Ayer was a [[Special Operations Executive]] and [[MI6]] agent during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The politics of apolitical culture: the Congress for Cultural Freedom, the CIA, and post-war American hegemony |publisher= Routledge |year=2002 |author= Scott-Smith, Giles |page= 109 |location =London |isbn= 9780415244459}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the [[Grote Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic|Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic]] at [[University College London]] from 1946 until 1959, when he became [[Wykeham Professor]] of Logic at the [[University of Oxford]]. He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1951 to 1952. He was knighted in 1970.

== Life ==
Ayer was born in [[St John's Wood|St John's Wood, London]], to a wealthy European family. His mother, Reine Citroën, was from the [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch-Jewish]] family who founded the [[Citroën]] car company in France. His father, Jules Ayer, was a Swiss [[Calvinist]] financier who worked for the [[Rothschild family]].

He was educated at [[Ascham St Vincent's School|Ascham St Vincent's Preparatory School]] and [[Eton College|Eton]]. It was at Eton that Ayer first became known for his characteristic bravado and precocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A.J. Ayer: A Life |author= Rogers, Ben |publisher= Vintage |location =London |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |pages=42-44 |isbn= 9780099536819}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final examinations at Eton, Ayer came second in his year, and first in classics. In his final year, as a member of Eton's senior council, he unsuccessfully campaigned for the abolition of [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment]] at the school. He won a classics scholarship to [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. He served as an officer in the [[Welsh Guards]] during [[World War II]], working for the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) and spying for [[MI6]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/21/mi6-first-authorised-history |location=London |work =The Guardian |first=Richard |last=Norton-Taylor |title=Graham Greene, Arthur Ransome and Somerset Maugham all spied for Britain, admits MI6 |date=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an extrovert, social mixer and womaniser, and was married four times, including to Dee Wells and Vanessa Salmon (thus becoming stepfather to [[Nigella Lawson]]). Reputedly he liked dancing and attending the clubs in London and New York. He was also obsessed with sports: he had played rugby for Eton, and was a noted cricketer and a keen supporter of the [[Tottenham Hotspur]] football team. For an academic, Ayer was an unusually well-connected figure in his time, with close links to 'high-society' and the establishment. Presiding over Oxford high-tables, he is often described as charming, but at times he could also be intimidating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Iris Murdoch as I knew her |first=A. N. |last=Wilson |publisher= Hutchinson |year=2003 |page=156 |location =London |isbn= 9780091742461}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Language, Truth and Logic'' (1936), Ayer rejected [[atheism]], as he understood it, on the grounds that any religious discourse was meaningless. He believed that religious language was unverifiable and as such literally nonsense. Consequently &quot;There is no God&quot; was for Ayer as meaningless and metaphysical an utterance as &quot;God exists.&quot; Though Ayer could not give assent to the declaration &quot;There is no God,&quot; he was an atheist in the sense that he withheld assent from affirmations of God's existence. However, in &quot;Language, Truth and Logic&quot; he distinguishes himself from both [[agnostic]]s and atheists by saying that both these stances take the statement &quot;God exists&quot; as a meaningful hypothesis, which Ayer himself does not. That stance of a person who believes &quot;God&quot; denotes no verifiable hypothesis is sometimes referred to as igtheism (for example, by [[Paul Kurtz]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The New Skepticism: Inquiry and Reliable Knowledge |page=194 |author=Kurtz, Paul |authorlink=Paul Kurtz |year=1992 |publisher=Prometheus |location =Buffalo, NY |isbn= 9780879757663}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years Ayer did refer to himself as an atheist&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I trust that my remaining an atheist will allay the anxieties of my fellow supporters of the [[British Humanist Association]], the [[Rationalist Press Association]] and the [[South Place Ethical Society]].&quot; (Ayer 1989, p. 12)&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that he did not believe in God.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I do not believe in God. It seems to me that theists of all kinds have very largely failed to make their concept of a deity intelligible; and to the extent that they have made it intelligible, they have given us no reason to think that anything answers to it.&quot; Ayer, A.J. (1966). &quot;What I Believe,&quot; ''Humanist'', Vol.81 (8) August, p 226.&lt;/ref&gt; He followed in the footsteps of [[Bertrand Russell]] by debating with the Jesuit scholar [[Frederick Copleston]] on the topic of religion.

Between 1945 and 1947, together with Russell and [[George Orwell]], he contributed a series of articles to ''[[Polemic (magazine)|Polemic]]'', a short-lived British &quot;Magazine of Philosophy, Psychology, and Aesthetics&quot; edited by the ex-Communist [[Humphrey Slater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19981113/ai_n14189822 |title= Where are the Hirsts of the 1930s now? |work=The Independent |location =London |date=13 November 1998 |author=Buckman, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Absent Minds&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.es/books?id=j-OjW2JvVfAC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;vq=ayer&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1#PPA396,M1 |title= Absent Minds: Intellectuals in Britain |author= Collini, Stefan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006
|isbn= 9780199291052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayer was closely associated with the British [[secular humanism|humanist]] movement. He was an Honorary Associate of the [[Rationalist Press Association]] from 1947 until his death. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1963.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, he became the first president of the Agnostics' Adoption Society and in the same year succeeded [[Julian Huxley]] as president of the [[British Humanist Association]], a post he held until 1970. In 1968 he edited ''The Humanist Outlook'', a collection of essays on the meaning of humanism.

He taught or lectured several times in the United States, including serving as a visiting professor at [[Bard College]] in the fall of 1987. At a party that same year held by fashion designer [[Fernando Sanchez]], Ayer, then 77, confronted [[Mike Tyson]] who was forcing himself upon the (then little-known) model [[Naomi Campbell]]. When Ayer demanded that Tyson stop, the boxer said: &quot;Do you know who the fuck I am? I'm the heavyweight champion of the world,&quot; to which Ayer replied: &quot;And I am the former [[Wykeham Professor of Logic]]. We are both pre-eminent in our field. I suggest that we talk about this like rational men&quot;. Ayer and Tyson then began to talk, while Naomi Campbell slipped out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=D26bGPQw0GsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A.+J.+Ayer&amp;ei=ECIPTKLSL4WyzgSbpJiaCg&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=naomi&amp;f=false Rogers (1999), page 344].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Near-death experience ===
In 1988, shortly before his death, Ayer wrote an article entitled, &quot;What I saw when I was dead&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Ayer-What-I-Saw-When-I-Was-Dead.pdf http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Ayer-What-I-Saw-When-I-Was-Dead.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; describing an unusual [[near-death experience]]. Of the experience, Ayer first said that it &quot;slightly weakened my conviction that my genuine death ... will be the end of me, though I continue to hope that it will be.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.near-death.com/experiences/atheists01.html http://www.near-death.com/experiences/atheists01.html]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few days later he revised this, saying &quot;what I should have said is that my experiences have weakened, not my belief that there is no life after death, but my inflexible attitude towards that belief&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edge.org/3rd_culture/dennett06/dennett06_index.html http://edge.org/3rd_culture/dennett06/dennett06_index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Dr. Jeremy George, the attending physician, claimed that Ayer had confided to him: &quot;I saw a Divine Being. I'm afraid I'm going to have to revise all my books and opinions.&quot; Ayer's son Nick, however, said that he had never mentioned this to him though he did find his father's words to be extraordinary, and said he had long felt there was something possibly suspect about his father's version of his near death experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gonsalves.org/favorite/atheist.htm http://www.gonsalves.org/favorite/atheist.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Ayer is perhaps best known for popularising the [[verification principle]], in particular through his presentation of it in ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'' (1936). The principle was at the time at the heart of the debates of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]] which Ayer visited as a young guest, and others including the leading light of the circle, [[Moritz Schlick]] were already offering their own papers on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/moritz.htm Unanswerable Questions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Ayer's own formulation was that a sentence can only be meaningful if it has verifiable [[empirical]] import, otherwise it is either &quot;[[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytical]]&quot; if [[Tautology (logic)|tautologous]], or &quot;metaphysical&quot; (i.e. meaningless, or &quot;literally senseless&quot;). He started work on the book at the age of 23&lt;ref&gt;page ix, &quot;Language, Truth and Logic&quot;, Penguin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and it was published when he was 26. Ayer's philosophical ideas were deeply influenced by those of the Vienna Circle and [[David Hume]]. His clear, vibrant and polemical exposition of them makes ''Language, Truth and Logic'' essential reading on the tenets of [[logical empiricism]]– the book is regarded as a classic of 20th century [[analytic philosophy]], and is widely read in philosophy courses around the world. In it, Ayer also proposed that the distinction between a conscious man and an unconscious machine resolves itself into a distinction between 'different types of perceptible behaviour',&lt;ref&gt;page 140, ''Language, Truth and Logic'', Penguin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; an argument which anticipates the [[Turing test]] published in 1950 to test a machine's capability to demonstrate intelligence (consciousness).

Ayer wrote two books on the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], ''Russell and Moore: The Analytic Heritage'' (1971) and ''Russell'' (1972). He also wrote an introductory book on the philosophy of [[David Hume]] and a short biography of [[Voltaire]].

In 1972–1973 Ayer gave the [[Gifford Lectures]] at [[University of St Andrews]], later published as ''The Central Questions of Philosophy''. He still believed in the viewpoint he shared with the logical positivists: that large parts of what was traditionally called &quot;philosophy&quot;– including the whole of [[metaphysics]], [[theology]] and [[aesthetics]]– were not matters that could be judged as being true or false and that it was thus meaningless to discuss them.

In &quot;The Concept of a Person and Other Essays&quot; (1963), Ayer heavily criticized [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[private language argument]].

Ayer's sense-data theory in ''Foundations of Empirical Knowledge'' was famously criticised by fellow Oxonian [[J. L. Austin]] in ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Austin)|Sense and Sensibilia]]'', a landmark 1950s work of common language philosophy. Ayer responded to this in the essay &quot;Has Austin Refuted the Sense-data Theory?&quot;, which can be found in his ''Metaphysics and Common Sense'' (1969).

'''André Weil''' (6 May 1906 – 6 August 1998) ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃dʁe vɛj}}) was an influential [[mathematician]] of the 20th century, renowned for the breadth and quality of his research output, its influence on future work, and the elegance of his exposition. He is especially known for his foundational work in [[number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]]. He was a founding member and the ''de facto'' early leader of the influential [[Bourbaki group]]. The [[philosopher]] [[Simone Weil]] was his sister.

==Life==
Born in [[Paris]] to [[Alsace|Alsatian]] [[agnosticism|agnostic]] [[Jew]]ish parents who fled the annexation of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] to [[Germany]]. His only sibling was [[Simone Weil]], a famous philosopher. Weil studied in Paris, [[Rome]] and [[Göttingen]] and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] in 1928. While in Germany, he befriended [[Carl Ludwig Siegel]]. He spent two academic years at [[Aligarh Muslim University]] from 1930. [[Hinduism]] and [[Sanskrit literature]] were his life-long interests{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. After one year in [[Marseille]], he taught six years in [[Strasbourg]]. He married Éveline in 1937.

Weil was in [[Finland]] when [[World War II]] broke out; he had been traveling in Scandinavia since April 1939. Éveline returned to France without him. Weil was mistakenly arrested in Finland at the outbreak of the [[Winter War]] suspected of spying; however, accounts of his life having been at danger have been shown to be exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;Osmo Pekonen: ''L'affaire Weil à Helsinki en 1939'', Gazette des mathématiciens 52 (avril 1992), pp. 13—20. With an afterword by André Weil.&lt;/ref&gt; Weil returned to France via Sweden and the United Kingdom, and was detained at [[Le Havre]] in January 1940. He was charged with failure to report for duty, and was imprisoned in Le Havre and then [[Rouen]]. It was in the military prison in Bonne-Nouvelle, a district of Rouen, from February to May, that he did the work that made his reputation. He was tried on 3 May 1940. Sentenced to five years, he asked to be sent to a military unit instead, and joined a regiment in [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]]. After the [[fall of France]], he met up with his family in Marseille, where he arrived by sea. He then went to [[Clermont-Ferrand]], where he managed to join Éveline, who had been in German-occupied France.

In January 1941, Weil and his family sailed from [[Marseille]] to New York. He spent the war in the United States, where he was supported by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]]. For two years, he unhappily taught undergraduate mathematics at [[Lehigh University]]. He taught at the [[Universidade de São Paulo]], 1945–47, where he worked with [[Oscar Zariski]]. He taught at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1947 to 1958, before spending the remainder of his career at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In 1979, he shared the second [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]].

==Work==

He made substantial contributions in many areas, the most important being his discovery of profound connections between [[algebraic geometry]] and [[number theory]]. This began in his doctoral work leading to the [[Mordell–Weil theorem]] (1928, and shortly applied in [[Siegel's theorem on integral points]]). [[Mordell's theorem]] had an ''ad hoc'' proof; Weil began the separation of the [[infinite descent]] argument into two types of structural approach, by means of [[height function]]s for sizing rational points, and by means of [[Galois cohomology]], which was not to be clearly named as that for two more decades. Both aspects have steadily developed into substantial theories. 

Among his major accomplishments were the 1940 proof, while in prison, of the [[Riemann hypothesis]] for [[zeta-function]]s of curves over finite fields, and his subsequent laying of proper foundations for algebraic geometry to support that result (from 1942 to 1946, most intensively). By modern standards his claim to have a proof had a very easy ride, but wartime conditions were one factor, and the fact that the German experts made little or no comment another. The so-called [[Weil conjectures]] were hugely influential from around 1950; they were later proved by [[Bernard Dwork]], [[Alexander Grothendieck]], [[Michael Artin]], and [[Pierre Deligne]], who completed the most difficult step in 1973. 

He had introduced the [[adele ring]] in the late 1930s, following [[Claude Chevalley]]'s lead with the [[idele]]s, and given a proof of the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]] with them (a version appeared in his ''Basic Number Theory'' in 1967). His 'matrix divisor' ([[vector bundle]] ''avant la lettre'') Riemann–Roch theorem from 1938 was a very early anticipation of later ideas such as moduli spaces of bundles. The [[Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers]] proved resistant for many years. Eventually the adelic approach became basic in [[automorphic representation]] theory. He picked up another credited ''Weil conjecture'', around 1967, which later under pressure from [[Serge Lang]] (resp. of Serre) became known as the [[Taniyama–Shimura conjecture]] (resp. Taniyama-Weil conjecture) based on a roughly formulated question of Taniyama at the 1955 Nikkō conference. His attitude towards conjectures was that one should not dignify a guess as a conjecture lightly, and in the Taniyama case, the evidence was only there after extensive computational work carried out from the late 1960s.

Other significant results were on [[Pontryagin duality]] and [[differential geometry]]. He introduced the concept of  a [[uniform space]] in [[general topology]], as a by-product of his collaboration with Nicolas Bourbaki (of which he was a Founding Father). His work on [[sheaf theory]] hardly appears in his published papers, but correspondence with [[Henri Cartan]] in the late 1940s, and reprinted in his collected papers, proved most influential.

He discovered that the so-called [[Weil representation]], previously introduced in [[quantum mechanics]] by [[Irving Segal]] and Shale, gave a contemporary framework for understanding the classical theory of [[quadratic form]]s. This was also a beginning of a substantial development by others, connecting [[representation theory]] and [[theta-function]]s.

He also wrote several books on the history of Number Theory.

==As expositor==
Weil's ideas made an important contribution to the writings and seminars of [[Bourbaki]], before and after [[World War II]]. His books had an important influence on research, an exceptional situation in mathematics. (In one famous case, the influence was possibly negative: [[Alexander Grothendieck]] is said to have complained of the 'aridity' of Weil's ''Foundations of Algebraic Geometry''.) The style of his books is clearly demarcated from that of his research papers.

He invented the notation &quot;Ø&quot; for the [[empty set]] (''q.v.'').

==Beliefs==

Indian (Hindu) thought had great influence on Weil{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. In his autobiography, he says that the only religious ideas that appealed to him were those to be found in Hindu philosophical thought. During the second World War, Weil refused to do military service and cited the [[Bhagavad Gita]] to justify his stand: he said his true [[dharma]] was the pursuit of mathematics and that was what he should be doing, not assisting in the war effort, however just the cause.

{{Redirect|Danaan}}
{{Trojan War}}

The '''Achaeans''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|Ἀχαιοί}}, ''Akhaioí'') is one of the collective names used for the Greeks in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' (used 598 times) and ''[[Odyssey]]''. The other names are the '''Danaans''' ({{polytonic|Δαναοί}}, used 138 times in the ''Iliad'') and '''Argives''' ({{polytonic|Ἀργεῖοι}}, used 29 times in the ''Iliad''). In the historical period, the '''Achaeans''' were the inhabitants of the region of [[Achaea]], a region in the north central part of the [[Peloponnese]]. The city states of this region formed a confederation known as the [[Achaean League]] which was influential during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC.

==Homeric versus later use==
The Homeric &quot;long-haired Achaeans&quot; would have been a part of the [[Mycenaean civilization]] that dominated Greece from ca. 1600 BC, with a history as a tribe that may have gone back to the prehistoric [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] immigration in the late [[3rd millennium BC]]. 

However, by the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods, the term 'Achaeans' referred to inhabitants of the much smaller region of [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaea]]. Herodotus identified the [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaea]]ns of the northern [[Peloponnese]] as descendants of the earlier, Homeric Achaeans. According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], writing in the 2nd century AD, the term 'Achaean' was originally given to those Greeks inhabiting the [[Argolis]] and [[Laconia]].&lt;ref name = PVIII1&gt;Pausanias VII, 1&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is clearly not the manner in which Homer uses the term.

Pausanias and [[Herodotus]] both recount the legend that the Achaeans were forced from these homelands by the [[Dorians]], during the legendary [[Dorian invasion]] of the Peloponnese. They then moved into the region that later bore the name of Achaea.

A scholarly consensus has not yet been reached on the origin of the historic Achaeans relative to the Homeric Achaeans, and is still hotly debated. Former emphasis on presumed race, in which John A. Scott could write an article on Achaean blondness, compared to the dark locks of &quot;Mediterranean&quot; [[Poseidon]],&lt;ref&gt;Scott, &quot;The Complexion of the Achaeans&quot; ''The Classical Journal''.'''20.'''.6 (March 1925:366-367)&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of hints in Homer, has been laid aside.

The contrasting view that &quot;Achaeans&quot;, as understood through Homer, are &quot;a name without a country&quot;, an ''ethnos'' created in the [[Epic Cycle|Epic tradition]],&lt;ref&gt;As William K. Prentice expressed this long-standing skepticism of a genuine Achaean ethnicity in the distant past, at the outset of his article &quot;The Achaeans&quot;, ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''33'''.2 (April 1929:206-218) p 206&lt;/ref&gt; has modern supporters among those who conclude that &quot;Achaeans&quot; were redefined in the fifth century, as contemporary speakers of [[Aeolic Greek]].

[[Karl Beloch]] has suggested that there was no Dorian invasion, but rather that the Peloponnesian Dorians were the Achaeans.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Beloch, ''Griechische Geschichte'', 1: I, p. 92, and p. 88, n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Eduard Meyer, disagreeing with Beloch, has instead put forth the suggestion that the real-life Achaeans were mainland pre-Dorian Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Meyer, ''Geschichte des Altertums'', 112, I (1928), p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;  His conclusion is based on his research on the similarity between the languages of the Achaeans and pre-historic Arcadians. William Prentice disagrees with both, noting that archeological evidence suggests that the Achaeans instead migrated from &quot;southern [[Asia Minor]] to Greece, probably settling first in lower Thessaly&quot; probably prior to 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Prentice 1929:206-218.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emil Forrer]] went as far to claim that there existed a &quot;great empire&quot; called Ahhijawa, which stood as equal by the side of the old states of the east. However, his conclusions were disproven by later researchers, especially by [[Ferdinand Sommer]].&lt;ref name=bengtson&gt;Hermann Bengtson: Griechische Geschichte. C.H.Beck, München, 2002. 9th Edition. ISBN 340602503X. pp.8-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hittite documents==
Some [[Hittite language|Hittite]] texts mention a nation lying to the west called '''''Ahhiyawa'''''.&lt;ref&gt;G.L. Huxley, ''Achaeans and Greeks'' (1960); Hans G. Güterbock, &quot;The Hittites and the Aegean World: Part 1. The Ahhiyawa Problem Reconsidered&quot; ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''87'''.2 (April 1983), pp. 133–138; and Machteld J. Mellink, &quot;Part 2. Archaeological Comments on Ahhiyawa-Achaians in Western Anatolia&quot;, pp. 138–141.&lt;/ref&gt; In the earliest reference to this land, a letter outlining the treaty violations of the Hittite vassal [[Madduwatta]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations/historical%2fCTH147_Madduwatta.html Translation of the Sins of Madduwatta]&lt;/ref&gt; it is called ''Ahhiya''.  Another important example is the ''[[Tawagalawa Letter]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations/historical%2fPiyama-radu+Letter.html Translation of the Tawagalawa Letter]&lt;/ref&gt; written by an unnamed [[Hittites|Hittite]] king (most probably Hattusili III) of the empire period (14th-13th century BC) to the king of ''Ahhiyawa'', treating him as an equal and suggesting that [[Miletus]] (''Millawanda'') was under his control. It also refers to an earlier &quot;''Wilusa'' episode&quot; involving hostility on the part of ''Ahhiyawa''. Ahhiya(wa) has been identified with the Achaeans of the [[Trojan War]] and the city of Wilusa with the legendary city of [[Troy]] (note the similarity with early Greek {{polytonic|*Ϝιλιον}} ''Wilion'', later {{polytonic|Ίλιον}} ''Ilion'', the name of the [[acropolis]] of Troy). However the exact relationship of the term ''Ahhiyawa'' to the Achaeans beyond a similarity in pronunciation is hotly debated by scholars, even following the discovery that Mycenaean [[Linear B]] is an early form of Greek; the earlier debate was summed up in 1984 by [[Hans G. Güterbock]] of the Oriental Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Hans G. Güterbock, &quot;Hittites and Akhaeans: A New Look&quot; ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' '''128'''.2 (June 1984), pp. 114–122. Bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Egyptian sources==
During the 5th year of Pharaoh [[Merneptah]], a confederation of [[Libya]]n and northern peoples is supposed to have attacked the Western Delta. Included amongst the ethnic names of the repulsed invaders is the [[Ekwesh]] or Eqwesh, whom some have seen as Achaeans, although Egyptian texts specifically mention these Equesh to be circumcised (which does not seem to have been a general practice in the Aegaean at the time). Homer mentions an Achaean attack upon the delta, and [[Menelaus]] speaks of the same in Book 4 of the ''Odyssey'' to [[Telemachos]] when he recounts his own return home from the [[Trojan War]]. Later Greek myths also say that Helen had spent the time of the [[Trojan War]] in [[Egypt]], and not at [[Troy]], and that after Troy the [[Greeks]] went there to recover her. There is also the strange myth of the brothers [[Aegyptus]] and [[Danaus]], sons of [[Belus (Egyptian)|Belus]], with the latter supposedly coming from Egypt, that Marianne Luban has suggested may date to this time.

==Greek mythology==
In [[Greek mythology]], the perceived cultural divisions among the Hellenes were represented as legendary lines of descent that identified kinship groups, with each line being derived from an [[eponymy|eponymous]] ancestor. Each of the Greek ''[[ethnos|ethne]]'' were said to be named in honor of their respective ancestors: [[Achaeus (son of Xuthus)|Achaeus]] of the Achaeans, [[Danaus]] of the [[Danaans]], [[Kadmos]] of the Kadmeioi, [[Hellen]] of the Hellenes (not to be confused with [[Helen of Troy]]), [[Aeolus]] of the [[Aeolians]], [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]] of the [[Ionians]], and [[Dorus]] of the [[Dorians]].

Kadmos from [[Phoenicia]], Danaus from [[Egypt]], and Pelops from [[Anatolia]] each gained a foothold in mainland Greece and were assimilated and Hellenized. Hellen, Graikos, Magnis, and Macedon were sons of Deucalion and Pyrrha, the only people who survived the [[Deucalion|Great Flood]]; the ''ethne'' were said to have originally been named after the elder son Graikoi but renamed later after Hellen who was proved to be the strongest. Sons of Hellen and the nymph Orsiis were Dorus, Xuthos, and Aeolus. Sons of Xuthos and Kreousa, daughter of Erechthea, were Ion and Achaeus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Achaeans ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' 1911: &quot;Achaeans&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Hyginus]], the Achaeans killed 362 Trojans during their ten years at [[Troy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atle Selberg''' (14 June 1917 &amp;ndash; 6 August 2007) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[mathematician]] known for his work in [[analytic number theory]], and in the theory of [[automorphic form]]s, in particular bringing them into relation with [[spectral theory]]. He was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1950.

== Early years ==
Selberg was born in [[Langesund]], [[Norway]]. 
&lt;!-- There seems to be no source for the following anecdote, and the reference given does not mention Selberg:
His first result came at age 14 when he rediscovered [[Johann Bernoulli]]'s  remarkable 1697 formula
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-n} = \int_0^1 x^{-x} dx\quad\quad(=1.291285997...)&lt;/math&gt;
which he published as a problem in the book ''Problems and Theorems in Analysis'' (part I, problem 160) by [[Pólya]] and [[Gábor Szegö]].
--&gt;
While he was still at school he was influenced by the work of [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] and he discovered the exact analytical formula for the partition function as suggested by the works of Ramanujan, however, this result was first published by [[Hans Rademacher]]. During the war he fought against the German invasion of Norway, and was imprisoned several times. 
He studied at the [[University of Oslo]] and completed his [[Ph.D.]] in 1943.

== Second world war ==
During [[World War II]], Selberg worked in isolation due to the [[German occupation of Norway]]. After the war his accomplishments became known, including a proof that a positive proportion of the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] lie on the line &lt;math&gt;\Re(s)=\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. 
 
After the war he turned to [[sieve theory]], a previously neglected topic which Selberg's work brought into prominence. In a 1947 paper he introduced the [[Selberg sieve]], a method well adapted in particular to providing auxiliary upper bounds, and which contributed to [[Chen's theorem]], among other important results. 

In March 1948, Selberg established, by elementary means, the asymptotic formula
:&lt;math&gt;\vartheta \left( x \right)\log \left( x \right) + \sum\limits_{p \le x} {\log \left( p \right)} \vartheta \left( {\frac{x}{p}} \right) = 2x\log \left( x \right) + O\left( x \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\vartheta \left( x \right) = \sum\limits_{p \le x} {\log \left( p \right)}&lt;/math&gt;
for primes &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. By July of that year, Selberg and [[Paul Erdős]] had each obtained [[elementary proof]]s of the [[prime number theorem]], both using Selberg's then unpublished asymptotic formula as a starting point. Circumstances leading up to the proofs, as well as publication disagreements, led to a bitter dispute between the two mathematicians.&lt;ref name=goldfeld&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Goldfeld  | first = Dorian  | year = 2003  | title = The Elementary Proof of the Prime Number Theorem: an Historical Perspective  | journal = Number Theory: New York Seminar  | pages = 179–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/2008-45-04/S0273-0979-08-01223-8/S0273-0979-08-01223-8.pdf |first=Nils A.|last= Baas|first2= Christian F.|last2= Skau |journal= Bull.

For his fundamental accomplishments during the 1940s, Selberg received the 1950 [[Fields Medal]].

== Institute for Advanced Study ==
Selberg moved to the [[United States]] and settled at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] in the 1950s where he remained until his death. During the 1950s he worked on introducing [[spectral theory]] into [[number theory]], culminating in his development of the [[Selberg trace formula]], the most famous and influential of his results. In its simplest form, this establishes a duality between the lengths of [[closed geodesic]]s on a [[compact Riemann surface]] and the [[eigenvalue]]s of the [[Laplace-Beltrami operator|Laplacian]], which is analogous to the duality between the [[prime number]]s and the zeros of the zeta function. He was awarded the 1986 [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]].

Selberg received many distinctions for his work in addition to the [[Fields Medal]], the [[Wolf Prize]] and the [[Gunnerus Medal]]. He was elected to the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]], the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

Selberg had two children, Ingrid Selberg and Lars Selberg. Ingrid Selberg is married to playwright [[Mustapha Matura]].

He died at home in Princeton on 6 August 2007 of heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Atle Selberg, 90, Lauded Mathematician, Dies  |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=2007-08-17 |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aeschylus''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|i:|s|k|ɨ|l|ə|s}} {{respell|EES|ki-ləs}}; {{lang-el|Αἰσχύλος}}, ''Aiskhulos''; c. 525/524 BC – c. 455/456 BC) was the first of the three ancient Greek tragedians whose work has survived, the others being [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], and is often described as the father of tragedy.&lt;ref name=&quot;F243&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1999|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[August Wilhelm von Schlegel|Schlegel, August Wilhelm von]]|page=121|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7148|title=Lectures on Dramatic Art and Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name derives from the Greek word ''aiskhos'' (αἶσχος), meaning &quot;shame&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://babynamesworld.parentsconnect.com/meaning_of_Aeschylus.html|title=Baby Names World}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], he expanded the number of characters in plays to allow for conflict amongst them; previously, characters interacted only with the  [[Greek chorus|chorus]]. Only seven of his estimated seventy to ninety plays have survived into modern times; and there is a longstanding [[Prometheus_Bound#Debate_over_authenticity|debate]] about his authorship of one of these plays, ''Prometheus Bound''.

At least one of Aeschylus's works was influenced by the [[Persian Wars|Persian invasion of Greece]], which took place during his lifetime. His play ''[[The Persians]]'' is a source of information about this period in Greek history. So important was the war to Aeschylus and the Greeks that, upon his death around 456 BC, his epitaph commemorated his participation in the Greek victory at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] rather than his success as a playwright.

== Life ==
There are no reliable sources for the life of Aeschylus. He was said to have been born in c. 525 BC in [[Eleusis]], a small town about 27&amp;nbsp;kilometers northwest of [[Athens]], which is nestled in the fertile valleys of western [[Attica]],&lt;ref name=&quot;S33&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sommerstein|1996|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the date is most likely based on counting back forty years from his first victory in the Great Dionysia. His family was wealthy and well established; his father Euphorion was a member of the [[Eupatridae]], the ancient nobility of Attica.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bates&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bates|1906|pp=53–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a youth he worked at a [[vineyard]] until, according to the 2nd-century CE geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], the god [[Dionysus]] visited him in his sleep and commanded him to turn his attention to the nascent art of tragedy.&lt;ref name=Bates/&gt; As soon as he woke from the dream, the young Aeschylus began writing a tragedy, and his first performance took place in 499 BC, when he was only 26 years old;&lt;ref name=S33/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bates/&gt; He would win his first victory at the [[City Dionysia]] in 484 BC.&lt;ref name=Bates/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;F241&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1999|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 510 BC, [[Cleomenes I]] (Aeschylus was 15 at the time) expelled the sons of Peisistratus from Athens, and [[Cleisthenes]] came to power. His reforms included a system of registration that emphasized the importance of the [[deme]] over family tradition. In the last decade of the 6th century, Aeschylus and his family were living in the deme of [[Eleusina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;&gt;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Persian Wars]] would play a large role in the playwright's life and career. In 490 BC, Aeschylus and his brother [[Cynegeirus]] fought to defend Athens against [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]]'  invading Persian army at the [[Battle of Marathon]].&lt;ref name=S33/&gt; The Athenians, though outnumbered, encircled and slaughtered the Persian army. This pivotal defeat ended the first Persian invasion of mainland Greece, and was celebrated across the city-states of Greece.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt; Although Athens was victorious, Cynegeirus died in the battle. He became a national hero, because he was killed trying to draw a retreating Persian ship back to shore.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;/&gt; In 480, Aeschylus was called into military service again, this time against [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]' invading forces at the [[Battle of Salamis]], and perhaps, too, at the [[Battle of Plataea]] in 479.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt; [[Ion of Chios]] was a witness for Aeschylus's  war record and his contribution in Salamis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;&gt;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&lt;/ref&gt; Salamis holds a prominent place in ''The Persians'', his oldest surviving [[Play (theatre)|play]], which was performed in 472 BC and won first prize at the Dionysia.&lt;ref name=&quot;S34&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sommerstein|1996|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aeschylus was one of many Greeks who had been initiated into the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], a cult to [[Demeter]] based in his hometown of Eleusis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|2000|loc=§10.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the name implies, members of the cult were supposed to have gained some secret knowledge. Firm details of specific rites are sparse, as members were sworn under the penalty of death not to reveal anything about the Mysteries to non-initiates. Nevertheless, according to [[Aristotle]] some thought that Aeschylus had revealed some of the cult's secrets on stage.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' 1111a8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources claim that an angry mob tried to kill Aeschylus on the spot, but he fled the scene. [[Heracleides of Pontus]] asserts that the crowd watching the play tried to stone Aeschylus. He then took refuge at the altar in the orchestra of the Theater of Dionysus. When he stood trial for his offense he pleaded ignorance. He was acquitted, with the jury sympathetic to the wounds that Aeschylus and his brother Cynegeirus suffered at Marathon. According to the 2nd-century AD author Aelian, [[Ameinias of Athens|Ameinias]], Aeschylus's  younger brother Amenias helped acquit his brother by showing the jury the stump of the hand that he lost at Salamis, where he was voted bravest warrior. The truth is that the award for bravery at Salamis went to Ameinias of Pallene, not Aeschylus's  brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;&gt;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&lt;/ref&gt;

Aeschylus travelled to [[Sicily]] once or twice in the 470s BC, having been invited by [[Hiero I of Syracuse]], a major Greek city on the eastern side of the island; and during one of these trips he produced ''The Women of Aetna'' (in honor of the city founded by Hieron) and restaged his ''Persians''.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt; By 473 BC, after the death of [[Phrynichus (tragic poet)|Phrynichus]], one of his chief rivals, Aeschylus was the yearly favorite in the Dionysia, winning first prize in nearly every competition.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt; In 472 BC, Aeschylus staged four plays, all of them financed by an up and coming politician, [[Pericles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;/&gt;

In 458 BC, he returned to Sicily for the last time, visiting the city of [[Gela]] where he died in 456 or 455 BC. It is claimed that he was killed by a tortoise that fell out of the sky when dropped by an eagle;  however, this story is very likely [[apocryphal]].&lt;ref&gt;See (e.g.) Lefkowitz 1981, 67ff. Cf. Sommerstein 2002, 33, ignores this story when giving a biographical sketch of the poet.&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus's work was so respected by the Athenians, that after his death his were the only tragedies allowed to be restaged in subsequent competitions.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt; His sons Euphorion and Euæon and his nephew Philocles also become playwrights.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt;

The inscription on Aeschylus's gravestone makes no mention of his [[theater|theatrical]] renown, commemorating only his military achievements:

==Personal life==
Aeschylus married and had two sons, Euphorion and Euaeon (both of whom would become tragic poets). His nephew, Philocles (his sister's son), would also become a tragic poet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;/&gt; He had at least two brothers, Cynegeirus and Ameinias.

==Works==
[[Image:Athen Dionysos-Theater.JPG|thumb|Modern picture of the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens, where many of Aeschylus's plays were performed]]

The roots of Greek drama are in religious festivals for the gods, chiefly [[Dionysus]], the god of wine.&lt;ref name=F241/&gt; During Aeschylus's lifetime, dramatic competitions became part of the [[City Dionysia]] in the spring.&lt;ref name=F241/&gt; The festival began with an opening procession, continued with a competition of boys singing [[dithyramb]]s, and culminated in a pair of dramatic competitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;F242&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1999|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first competition Aeschylus would have participated in, consisted of three playwrights each presenting three tragic plays followed by a shorter comedic [[satyr play]].&lt;ref name=F242/&gt; A second competition of five comedic playwrights followed, and the winners of both competitions were chosen by a panel of judges.&lt;ref name=F242/&gt;

Aeschylus entered many of these competitions in his lifetime, and various ancient sources attribute between seventy and ninety plays to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;F243&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;P222&quot;/&gt; Only seven tragedies have survived intact: ''[[The Persians]]'', ''[[Seven against Thebes]]'', ''[[The Suppliants]]'', the trilogy known as ''[[The Oresteia]]'', consisting of the three tragedies ''[[Agamemnon (play)#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]]'', ''[[The Libation Bearers]]'' and ''[[The Eumenides#The Eumenides|The Eumenides]]'', together with ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' (whose authorship is disputed). With the exception of this last play — the success of which is uncertain — all of Aeschylus's [[Extant literature|extant]] tragedies are known to have won first prize at the City Dionysia. The Alexandrian ''Life of Aeschylus'' claims that he won the first prize at the City Dionysia thirteen times. This compares favorably with Sophocles' reported eighteen victories (with a substantially larger catalogue, at an estimated 120 plays), and dwarfs the five victories of Euripides (who is thought to have written roughly 90 plays).

One hallmark of Aeschylean dramaturgy appears to have been his tendency to write connected trilogies, in which each play serves as a chapter in a continuous dramatic narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sommerstein|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Oresteia]]'' is the only extant example of this type of connected trilogy, but there is evidence that Aeschylus often wrote such trilogies. The comic satyr plays that follow his trilogies also drew upon stories derived from myths.

For example, the ''Oresteia'''s satyr play ''[[Proteus]]'' treated the story of Menelaus'  detour in Egypt on his way home from the [[Trojan War]]. Based on the evidence provided by a catalogue of Aeschylean play titles, [[scholia]], and play fragments recorded by later authors, it is assumed that three other of his extant plays were components of connected trilogies: ''Seven against Thebes'' being the final play in an Oedipus trilogy, and ''The Suppliants'' and ''Prometheus Bound'' each being the first play in a Danaid trilogy and Prometheus trilogy, respectively (see below). Scholars have moreover suggested several completely lost trilogies derived from known play titles. A number of these trilogies treated myths surrounding the Trojan War. One, collectively called the ''[[Achilles (play)|Achilleis]]'', comprised the titles ''Myrmidons'', ''Nereids'' and ''Phrygians'' (alternately, ''The Ransoming of Hector'').

''Myrmidons'' was based on books 9 and 16 in [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]]. Achilles sits in silent indignation over his humiliation at Agamemnon's hands for most of the play. Envoys from the Greek army attempt to reconcile him to [[Agamemnon]], but he yields only to his friend and lover [[Patroclus]], who then battles the Trojans in Achilles' armour. The bravery and death of Patroclus are reported in a messenger's speech, which is followed by mourning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;/&gt;

''Nereids'' was based on books 18, 19, and 22 of the Iliad, follows the Daughters of Nereus, the sea god, lament Patroclus'  death. In this play a messenger tells how Achilles, perhaps reconciled to Agamemon and the Greeks, slew [[Hector]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;/&gt;

In ''Phrygians'', Achilles sits in silent mourning over Patroclus, after a brief discussion with [[Hermes]]. Hermes then brings in [[Priam|King Priam of Troy]], who wins over Achilles and ransoms his son's body in a spectacular [[coup de théâtre]]. A scale is brought on stage and Hector's body is placed in one scale and gold in the other. The dynamic dancing of the chorus of Trojans when they enter with Priam is reported by [[Aristophanes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;/&gt;

In one of his lost plays, ''Niobe'' the heroine's children have been slain by [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]] because [[Niobe]] had gloated that she had more children than their mother, [[Leto]]. Niobe sits in silent mourning on stage during most of the play. In the [[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]], [[Plato]] quotes the line &quot;God plants a fault in mortals when he wills to destroy a house utterly.&quot; immoral.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;/&gt;

Another trilogy apparently recounts the entry of the Trojan ally [[Memnon]] into the war, and his death at the hands of Achilles (''Memnon'' and ''The Weighing of Souls'' being two components of the trilogy); ''The Award of the Arms'', ''The Phrygian Women'', and ''The Salaminian Women'' suggest a trilogy about the madness and subsequent suicide of the Greek hero [[Ajax the great|Ajax]]; Aeschylus also seems to have written about [[Odysseus]]' return to Ithaca after the war (including his killing of his wife [[Penelope]]'s suitors and its consequences) in a trilogy consisting of ''The Soul-raisers'', ''Penelope'' and ''The Bone-gatherers''. Other suggested trilogies touched on the myth of Jason and the Argonauts (''Argô'', ''Lemnian Women'', ''Hypsipylê''); the life of Perseus (''The Net-draggers'', ''Polydektês'', ''Phorkides''); the birth and exploits of Dionysus (''Semele'', ''Bacchae'', ''Pentheus''); and the aftermath of the war portrayed in ''Seven against Thebes'' (''Eleusinians'', ''Argives'' (or ''Argive Women''), ''Sons of the Seven'').&lt;ref&gt;Sommerstein 2002, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Persians'' ===
{{Main|The Persians}}

The earliest of his plays to survive is ''The Persians'' (''Persai''), performed in 472 BC and based on experiences in Aeschylus's own life, specifically the [[Battle of Salamis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;F244&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1999|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unique among surviving Greek tragedies in that it describes a recent historical event.&lt;ref name=F243/&gt; ''The Persians'' focuses on the popular Greek theme of ''[[hubris]]'' by blaming Persia's loss on the pride of its king.&lt;ref name=F244/&gt; It opens with the arrival of a messenger in [[Susa]], the Persian capital, bearing news of the catastrophic Persian defeat at Salamis to [[Atossa]], the mother of the Persian King [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]. Atossa then travels to the tomb of Darius, her husband, where his ghost appears to explain the cause of the defeat. It is, he says, the result of Xerxes' hubris in building a bridge across the [[Hellespont]], an action which angered the gods. Xerxes appears at the end of the play, not realizing the cause of his defeat, and the play closes to lamentations by Xerxes and the chorus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vellacott&quot;&gt;Vellacott: 7–19&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Seven against Thebes'' ===
{{Main|Seven against Thebes}}

''Seven against Thebes'' (''Hepta epi Thebas''), which was performed in 467 BC, has the contrasting theme of the interference of the gods in human affairs.&lt;ref name=F244/&gt; It also marks the first known appearance in Aeschylus's work of a theme which would continue through his plays, that of the [[polis]] (the city) being a key development of human civilization.&lt;ref name=&quot;F244246&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1999|pp=244–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play tells the story of [[Eteocles]] and [[Polynices]], the sons of the shamed King of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Oedipus]]. The sons agree to alternate in the throne of the city, but after the first year Eteocles refuses to step down, and Polynices wages war to claim his crown. The brothers kill each other in single combat, and the original ending of the play consisted of lamentations for the dead brothers. A new ending was added to the play some fifty years later: Antigone and Ismene mourn their dead brothers, a messenger enters announcing an edict prohibiting the burial of Polynices; and finally, Antigone declares her intention to defy this edict.&lt;ref&gt;Aeschylus. &quot;Prometheus Bound, The Suppliants, Seven Against Thebes, The Persians.&quot; Philip Vellacott's Introduction, pp.7-19. Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was the third in a connected Oedipus trilogy; the first two plays were ''Laius'' and ''Oedipus''. The concluding [[satyr play]] was ''The Sphinx''.&lt;ref&gt;Sommerstein 2002, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Suppliants''===
{{Main|The Suppliants (Aeschylus)}}

Aeschylus continued his emphasis on the polis with ''The Suppliants'' in 463 BC (''Hiketides''), which pays tribute to the democratic undercurrents running through Athens in advance of the establishment of a democratic government in 461. In the play, the [[Danaids]], the fifty daughters of [[Danaus]], founder of [[Argos]], flee a forced marriage to their cousins in Egypt. They turn to King [[Pelasgus]] of Argos for protection, but Pelasgus refuses until the people of Argos weigh in on the decision, a distinctly democratic move on the part of the king. The people decide that the Danaids deserve protection, and they are allowed within the walls of Argos despite Egyptian protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;F246&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1999|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1952 publication of Oxyrhynchus Papyrus 2256 fr. 3 confirmed a long-assumed (because of ''The Suppliants''' cliffhanger ending) Danaid trilogy, whose constituent plays are generally agreed to be ''The Suppliants'', ''The Aegyptids'' and ''The Danaids''. A plausible reconstruction of the trilogy's last two-thirds runs thus:&lt;ref&gt;See (e.g.) Sommerstein 1996, 141-51; Turner 2001, 36-39.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Aegyptids'', the Argive-Egyptian war threatened in the first play has transpired. During the course of the war, King Pelasgus has been killed, and Danaus rules Argos. He negotiates a peace settlement with Aegyptus, as a condition of which, his fifty daughters will marry the fifty sons of Aegyptus. Danaus secretly informs his daughters of an oracle predicting that one of his sons-in-law would kill him; he therefore orders the Danaids to murder the Aegyptids on their wedding night. His daughters agree. ''The Danaids'' would open the day after the wedding. In short order, it is revealed that forty-nine of the Danaids killed their husbands as ordered; Hypermnestra, however, loved her husband Lynceus, and thus spared his life and helped him to escape. Angered by his daughter's disobedience, Danaus orders her imprisonment and, possibly, her execution. In the trilogy's climax and dénouement, Lynceus reveals himself to Danaus, and kills him (thus fulfilling the oracle). He and Hypermnestra will establish a ruling dynasty in Argos. The other forty-nine Danaids are absolved of their murderous crime, and married off to unspecified Argive men. The satyr play following this trilogy was titled ''Amymone'', after one of the Danaids.&lt;ref&gt;Sommerstein 2002, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Oresteia''===
{{Main|The Oresteia}}

The only complete (save a few missing lines in several spots)  [[trilogy]] of Greek plays by any playwright still extant is the ''[[Oresteia]]'' (458 BC); although  the satyr play that originally followed it, ''[[Proteus]]'', is lost except for some fragments.&lt;ref name=F244/&gt;  The trilogy consists of ''[[The Oresteia#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]]'', ''[[The Oresteia#The Libation Bearers|The Libation Bearers]]'' (''Choephoroi''), and ''[[The Oresteia#The Eumenides|The Eumenides]]''.&lt;ref name=F244246/&gt; Together, these plays tell the bloody story of the family of [[Agamemnon]], King of Argos.

====''Agamemnon''====

''Agamemnon'' describes Agamemnon's death at the hands of his wife [[Clytemnestra]], who was angry at his sacrifice of their daughter [[Iphigenia]] and his keeping of the Trojan prophetess [[Cassandra]] as a concubine. Cassandra enters the palace even though she knows she will be murdered by Clytemnestra, knowing that she cannot avoid her fate. The ending of the play includes a prediction of the return of [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]], son of Agamemnon, who will seek to avenge his father.&lt;ref name=F244246/&gt;''

====''The Libation Bearers''====

''The Libation Bearers'' continues the tale, opening with Orestes arrival at Agamemnon's tomb. At the tomb, Electra meets Orestes, who has returned from exile in [[Phocis]], and they plan revenge upon Clytemnestra and her lover [[Aegisthus]].  Clytemnestra's account of a nightmare in which she gives birth to a snake is recounted by the chorus; and this leads her to order [[Electra]], her daughter, to pour libations on Agamemnon's tomb (with the assistance of libation bearers) in hope of making amends. Orestes enters the palace pretending to bear news of his own death, and when Clytemnestra calls in Aegisthus to share in the news, Orestes kills them both. Orestes is then beset by the [[Erinyes|Furies]], who avenge the murders of kin in Greek mythology.&lt;ref name=F244246/&gt;

====''The Eumenides''====

The final play of ''The Oresteia'' addresses the question of Orestes' guilt.&lt;ref name=F244246/&gt; The Furies drive Orestes from Argos and into the wilderness. He makes his way to the temple of Apollo and begs him to drive the Furies away. Apollo had encouraged Orestes to kill Clytemnestra, and so bears some of the guilt for the murder. The Furies are a more ancient race of the gods, and Apollo sends Orestes to the temple of Athena, with Hermes as a guide. The Furies track him down, and the goddess [[Athena]], patron of Athens, steps in and declares that a trial is necessary. Apollo argues Orestes' case and, after the judges, including Athena deliver a tie vote, Athena announces that Orestes is acquitted. She renames the Furies  ''The Eumenides'' (The Good-spirited, or Kindly Ones), and extols the importance of reason in the development of laws, and, as in ''The Suppliants'', the ideals of a democratic Athens are praised.&lt;ref name=F246/&gt;

===''Prometheus Bound''===
{{Main|Prometheus Bound}}

In addition to these six works, a seventh tragedy, ''Prometheus Bound'', is attributed to Aeschylus by ancient authorities. Since the late 19th century, however, scholars have increasingly doubted this ascription, largely on stylistic grounds. Its production date is also in dispute, with theories ranging from the 480s BC to as late as the 410s.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffith|1983|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play consists mostly of static dialogue, as throughout the play the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]] is bound to a rock as punishment from the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] [[Zeus]] for providing fire to humans. The god [[Hephaestus]], the Titan [[Oceanus]], and the [[greek chorus|chorus]] of [[Oceanids]] all express sympathy for Prometheus' plight. Prometheus meets [[Io (mythology)|Io]], a fellow victim of Zeus' cruelty; and prophesies her future travels, revealing that one of her descendants will free Prometheus. The play closes with Zeus sending Prometheus into the abyss because Prometheus refuses to divulge the secret of a potential marriage that could be Zeus' downfall.&lt;ref name=Vellacott/&gt; The ''Prometheus Bound'' appears to have been the first play in a trilogy called the ''[[Prometheia]]''. In the second play, ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Aeschylus)|Prometheus Unbound]]'', Heracles frees Prometheus from his chains and kills the eagle that had been sent daily to eat Prometheus' perpetually regenerating liver. Perhaps foreshadowing his eventual reconciliation with Prometheus, we learn that Zeus has released the other Titans whom he imprisoned at the conclusion of the [[Titanomachy]]. In the trilogy's conclusion, ''[[Prometheus the Fire-Bringer]]'', it appears that the Titan finally warns Zeus not to sleep with the sea nymph [[Thetis]], for she is fated to give birth to a son greater than the father. Not wishing to be overthrown, Zeus marries Thetis off to the mortal Peleus; the product of that union is Achilles, Greek hero of the Trojan War. After reconciling with Prometheus, Zeus probably inaugurates a festival in his honor at Athens.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the trilogy's reconstruction, see (e.g.) Conacher 1980, 100-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence on Greek drama and culture ===

When Aeschylus first began writing, the theatre had only just begun to evolve, although earlier playwrights like [[Thespis]] had already expanded the cast to include an actor who was able to interact with the [[Greek chorus|chorus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;P222&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pomeroy|1999|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus added a second actor, allowing for greater dramatic variety, while the chorus played a less important role.&lt;ref name=P222/&gt; He is sometimes credited with introducing ''skenographia'', or scene-decoration,&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Vitruvius]]. See Summers 2007, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; though Aristotle gives this distinction to Sophocles. Aeschylus is also said to have made the costumes more elaborate and dramatic, and having his actors wear platform boots (''cothurni'') to make them more visible to the audience. According to a later account of Aeschylus's life, as they walked on stage in the first performance of the ''Eumenides'', the chorus of Furies were so frightening in appearance that they caused young children to faint, patriarchs to urinate, and pregnant women to go into labour.&lt;ref&gt;''Life of Aeschylus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

His plays were written in verse, no violence is performed on stage, and the plays have a remoteness from daily life in Athens, either by relating stories about the gods or by being set, like ''The Persians'', in far-away locales.&lt;ref name=&quot;P223&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pomeroy|1999|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus's work has a strong moral and religious emphasis.&lt;ref name=P223/&gt; The ''Oresteia'' trilogy concentrated on man's position in the cosmos in relation to the gods, divine law, and divine punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pomeroy|1999|pp=224–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus's popularity is evident in the praise the comic playwright [[Aristophanes]] gives him in ''[[The Frogs]]'', produced some half-century after Aeschylus's death. Appearing as a character in the play, Aeschylus claims at line 1022 that his ''Seven against Thebes'' &quot;made everyone watching it to love being warlike&quot;; with his ''Persians'', Aeschylus claims at lines 1026-7 that he &quot;taught the Athenians to desire always to defeat their enemies.&quot; Aeschylus goes on to say at lines 1039ff. that his plays inspired the Athenians to be brave and virtuous.

=== Influence outside of Greek Culture ===

Aeschylus's works were influential beyond his own time. [[Hugh Lloyd-Jones]] ([[Regius Professor of Greek (Oxford)|Regius Professor of Greek]] Emeritus at [[Oxford University]]) draws attention to Wagner's reverence of Aeschylus. Michael Ewans argues in his ''Wagner and Aeschylus. The Ring and the Oresteia'' (London: Faber. 1982) that the influence was so great as to merit a direct character by character comparison between Wagner's ''Ring'' and Aeschylus's ''Oresteia''. A critic of his book however, while not denying that Wagner read and respected Aeschylus, have described his arguments as unreasonable and forced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Furness, Raymond|title=The Modern Language Review|volume=79|issue=1|date=January 1984|pages= 239–240|url= http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0026-7937%28198401%2979%3A1%3C239%3AWAAT%27A%3E2.0.CO%3B2–6|ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[J. T. Sheppard]] argues in the second half of his ''Aeschylus and Sophocles: Their Work and Influence'' that Aeschylus, along with [[Sophocles]], have played a major part in the formation of dramatic literature from the [[Renaissance]] to the present, specifically in French and Elizabethan drama. He also claims that their influence went beyond just drama and applies to literature in general, citing Milton and the Romantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|unused_data=year=1927|title=Aeschylus and Sophocles: their Work and Influence|journal=[[Journal of Hellenic Studies]]|volume=47|issue= 2|year=1927|page=265|pages=265|doi=10.2307/625177|last=Sheppard|first=J.

During his presidential campaign in 1968, Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] quoted the [[Edith Hamilton]] translation of Aeschylus on the night of the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] Kennedy was notified of King's murder before a campaign stop in Indianapolis, Indiana and was warned not to attend the event due to fears of rioting from the mostly African-American crowd. Kennedy insisted on attending and delivered an [[Robert F. Kennedy's speech on the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|impromptu speech]] that delivered news of King's death to the crowd. Acknowledging the audience's emotions, Kennedy referred to his own grief at the murder of his brother, President [[John F. Kennedy]] and, quoting a passage from the play Agamemnon, said: &quot;My favorite poet was Aeschylus. He once wrote: &quot;Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, until in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.&quot; What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence or lawlessness; but love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or they be black... Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world.&quot; The speech is considered to be Kennedy's finest. The quotation from Aeschylus was later inscribed on a memorial at the gravesite of Robert Kennedy following his own assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/3645184605/ Virginia - Arlington National Cemetery: Robert F. Kennedy Gravesite]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standard Editions ==

The standard edition of Aeschylus is [[Martin Litchfield West|Martin L. West]], ''Aeschyli Tragoediae: cum incerti poetae Prometheo'' (1998), 2nd edition. The first translation of the seven plays into English was by [[Robert Potter]] in 1779, using blank verse for the iambic trimeters and rhymed verse for the choruses, a convention adopted by most translators for the next century.

[[File:Amber Road.jpg|thumb|250px|The Amber Road]]

The '''Amber Road''' was an ancient [[trade route]] for the transfer of [[amber]]. As one of the waterways and ancient highways, for centuries the road led from [[Europe]] to [[Asia]] and back, and from northern Africa to the [[Baltic Sea]].

An important raw material, amber was transported from the [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]] coasts overland by way of the [[Vistula]] and [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] rivers to [[Italy]], [[Greece]], the [[Black Sea]], and [[Egypt]] thousands of years ago, and long after.

In [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, a main route ran south from the Baltic coast in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] through the land of the [[Boii]] (modern [[Czech Republic]]  and  [[Slovakia]]) to the head of the [[Adriatic Sea]] ( modern [[Gulf of Venice]] ).  The Egyptian pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]] had Baltic amber among his burial goods,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} and amber was sent from the North Sea to the temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]] as an offering. From the [[Black Sea]], trade could continue to Asia along the [[Silk Road]], another ancient trade route.

The [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]] towns of [[Mokhovoye|Kaup]] and [[Truso]] on the Baltic were the starting points of the route to the south. In [[Scandinavia]] the amber road probably gave rise to the thriving [[Nordic Bronze Age]] culture, bringing influences from the Mediterranean Sea to the northernmost countries of Europe.

Sometimes the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] is called the Янтарный край, which means the Amber area.

==Overview of known amber finding places in Europe==
{{Disputed-section|date=July 2010}}
Amber roads connect [[amber finding locations]] to customer sites in Europe, in the Middle East regions and in the Far East.

==Overview of known amber roads by country==
{{Disputed-section|date=July 2010}}
{{Ref improve section|date=January 2008}}

===Central Europe===

The shortest (and possibly oldest) road avoids [[Alpine climate|alpine]] areas and led from the Baltic coastline ([[Estonia]]) through [[Poland]], [[Silesia]], passed the [[Moravian Gate]], followed the river [[Morava River (Central Europe)|Morava]]  to [[Slovakia]], where it crossed the [[Danube]] to [[Austria]] near [[Carnuntum]], heading southwards down to [[Aquileia]] at the [[Adriatic]] coast. One of the oldest directions of the last stage of the Amber Road to the south of Danube, noted in the myth about the [[Argonauts]], used [[Sava]] and [[Kupa (river)|Kupa]] rivers in [[Croatia]] ending with short continental road from ''Nauportus'' ([[Brod na Kupi]]) to ''Tarsatica'' (Trsat, [[Rijeka]]) at the coast of Adriatic.&lt;ref&gt;Edith Hamilton, ''Mythology'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
[[Image:German Amber Roads.gif|thumb|right|250px|Amber Roads in Germany]]
Several roads connected the North Sea and Baltic Seas, especially the city of [[Hamburg]] to the [[Brenner Pass]], proceeding southwards to [[Brindisi]] in Italy and Ambracia (Greece). ''(See map at right)''

===Switzerland===
The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] region indicates a number of alpine roads, concentrating around the capital city [[Bern]] and probably originating from the borders of the [[Rhône River]] and the [[Rhine]].

===The Netherlands===
A small section, including [[Baarn]], [[Barneveld]], [[Amersfoort]] and [[Amerongen]], connected the North Sea with the Lower Rhine.

===Belgium===
A small section, led southwards from [[Antwerp]] and [[Bruges]] to the towns Braine-l’Alleud and Braine-le-Comte, both originally named &quot;Brennia-Brenna&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The route continued by following the [[Meuse River]] towards [[Bern]] in Switzerland.

===France===
Three routes may be identified leading from an amber finding region or delta at the mouth of River Openia towards Bresse and Bern, crossing the Alps to Switzerland and Italy.

===Southern France and Spain===
Routes connecting amber finding locations at Ambares (near [[Bordeaux]]), leading to [[Béarn]] and the Pyrenees. Routes connecting the amber finding locations in northern Spain and in the Pyrenees were a trading route to the Mediterranean Sea.

'''Crandall University''' is a small [[Liberal Arts]] university located in [[Moncton|Moncton, New Brunswick]], [[Canada]].  Crandall is operated by the [[Convention of Atlantic Baptist Churches]].

==History==
The school was founded in 1949 under the name '''United Baptist Bible Training School''' (UBBTS), and served as both a [[secondary school]] and a Bible school. Over two decades, the focus of the school gradually shifted toward post-secondary programs. In 1968, UBBTS became a Bible and junior Christian liberal arts college, and in 1970 the name was changed to '''Atlantic Baptist College''' (ABC). A sustained campaign to expand the school's faculty and improve the level of education resulted in ABC being able to grant full [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees in the early 1980s.  Its campus at this time was located along the Salisbury Road, west of [[Moncton]]'s central business district.

The institution moved to a new campus constructed on the Gorge Road, north of the central business district, in 1996. The name was also changed to '''Atlantic Baptist University''', a reflection of expanded student enrollment and academic accreditation. ABU sports teams play under the name ''Blue Tide''. The institution was the first, and thus far only, [[English language|English]] university in Moncton.  The Atlantic Baptist University Act was passed by the [[New Brunswick]] Legislature in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnb.ca/legis/bill/FILE/56/2/Bill-64-e.htm Atlantic Baptist University Act&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, plans for a $24 million expansion to the campus, including a new academic building, a second residence and a sports complex were unveiled. Construction is currently underway. The expansion will allow the student enrollment to increase to 1200.

On August 21, 2009 it was announced that the institution had changed its name to '''Crandall University''' in honour of Rev. [[Joseph Crandall]], a pioneering Baptist minister in New Brunswick.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2009/08/21/nb-atlantic-baptist-university-crandall-557.html Atlantic Baptist University changes name&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir '''Andrew John Wiles''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (born 11 April 1953)&lt;ref name=&quot;WhosWho&quot;&gt;
&quot;WILES, Sir Andrew (John)&quot;, [[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]], A &amp; C Black, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; is a British [[mathematician]] and a professor at [[Princeton University]], specializing in [[number theory]]. He is most famous for [[Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem|proving Fermat's Last Theorem]].

==Early life and education==
Andrew Wiles is the son of [[Maurice Wiles|Maurice Frank Wiles]] (1923–2005), the [[Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford]]&lt;ref&gt;WILES, Rev. Prof. Maurice Frank, Who Was Who, A &amp; C Black, January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and Patricia Wiles (née Mowll). His father worked as the Chaplain at [[Ridley Hall, Cambridge]], for the years 1952–55. Wiles was born in [[Cambridge, England]], in 1953, and he  attended King's College School, Cambridge, and [[The Leys School, Cambridge]]. 

Wiles discovered Fermat's Last Theorem on his way home from school when he was 10 years old. He stopped by his local library where he found a book about the theorem.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/proof/wiles.html&lt;/ref&gt; Puzzled by the fact that the statement of the theorem was so easy that he, a ten-year old, could understand it, he decided to be the first person to prove it. However, he soon realized that his knowledge of mathematics was too small, so he abandoned his childhood dream, until 1986, when he heard that [[Kenneth Alan Ribet|Ribet]] had proved [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]]'s [[Ribet's theorem|ε-conjecture]] and therefore established a link between Fermat's Last Theorem and the [[Modularity theorem|Taniyama-Shimura conjecture]].

Wiles earned his [[bachelor's degree]] in mathematics in 1974 after his study at [[Merton College, Oxford]], and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1980, after his research at [[Clare College, Cambridge]].

After a stay at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[New Jersey]] in 1981, Wiles became a professor at [[Princeton University]]. In 1985–86, Wiles was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] at the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] near Paris and at the [[École Normale Supérieure]]. From 1988 to 1990, Wiles was a [[Royal Society]] Research Professor at [[Oxford University]], and then he returned to Princeton.

In October 2009 it was announced that Wiles would again become a Royal Society Research Professor at Oxford in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2009/091015.html Oxford to welcome new Royal Society Professors]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical career==
Wiles's graduate research was guided by [[John Coates (mathematician)|John Coates]] beginning in the summer of 1975. Together these colleagues worked on the arithmetic of [[elliptic curve]]s with [[complex multiplication]] by the methods of [[Iwasawa theory]]. He further worked with [[Barry Mazur]] on the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory over the [[rational number]]s, and soon afterward, he generalized this result to [[totally real field]]s.

==The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem==
{{main|Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem}}

Starting in the summer of 1986, based on successive progress of the previous few years of [[Gerhard Frey]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Ken Ribet]], Wiles realised that a proof of a limited form of the [[modularity theorem]] might then be in reach. He dedicated all of his research time to this problem in relative secrecy. In 1993, he presented his proof to the public for the first time at a conference in Cambridge. In August 1993, however, it turned out that the proof contained a gap. In desperation, Andrew Wiles tried to fill in this gap, but found out that the error he had made was a very fundamental one. According to Wiles, the crucial idea for circumventing, rather than closing this gap, came to him on 19 September 1994. Together with his former student [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]], he published a second paper which circumvented the gap and thus completed the proof. Both papers were published in 1995 in a special volume of the Annals of Mathematics.

==Recognition by the media==
His proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] has stood up to the scrutiny of the world's mathematical experts. Wiles was interviewed for an episode of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]]'s documentary series ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' that focused on Fermat's Last Theorem. This was renamed &quot;The Proof&quot;, and it was made an episode of the [[Public Broadcasting Service]]'s television science TV series ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1997|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/proof/|title=[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA Online]]: The Proof|publisher=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]|accessdate=2006-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a foreign member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] since 1996. He remains a citizen of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=WhosWho /&gt;

==Family==
Wiles is married to Nada Canaan Wiles, who earned her Ph.D. in [[microbiology]] from [[Princeton University]] in [[New Jersey]], and they have three daughters: Clare, Kate and Olivia.&lt;ref name=WhosWho/&gt; He currently lives in Princeton, New Jersey.

==Awards==
Wiles has been awarded several major prizes in mathematics and science:
* [[Whitehead Prize|Junior Whitehead Prize]] of the  [[London Mathematical Society|LMS]] (1988)&lt;ref name=&quot;WhosWho&quot; /&gt;

'''Anne Brontë''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|r|ɒ|n|t|i}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Bront%C3%AB American Heritage and Collins dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Bront%C3%AB Columbia Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; 17 January 1820 &amp;ndash; 28 May 1849) was a British novelist and poet, the youngest member of the [[Brontë family|Brontë]] literary family. 

The daughter of a poor Irish clergyman in the [[Church of England]], Anne Brontë lived most of her life with her family at the  parish of [[Haworth]] on the [[Yorkshire]] moors. For a couple of years she went to a boarding school. At the age of nineteen, she left Haworth working as a governess between 1839 and 1845. After leaving her teaching position, she fulfilled her literary ambitions. She wrote a volume of poetry with her sisters (''[[Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell]]'', 1846) and in short succession she wrote two novels. ''[[Agnes Grey]]'', based upon her experiences as a governess, was published in 1847. Her second and last novel, ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' appeared in 1848. Anne's life was cut short with her death of [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] when she was 29&amp;nbsp;years old. 

Anne Brontë is somewhat overshadowed by her more famous sisters, [[Charlotte Brontë|Charlotte]], author of four novels including ''[[Jane Eyre]]''; and [[Emily Brontë|Emily]], author of ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''. Anne's two novels, written in a sharp and ironic style, are completely different from the romanticism followed by her sisters. She wrote in a realistic, rather than a romantic style. Her novels, like those of her sisters, have become classics of [[English literature]].

==Family background==
[[File:Anne Brontë by Patrick Branwell Brontë restored.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Anne from Branwell's group portrait (below)]]
Anne's father, [[Patrick Brontë]] (1777&amp;ndash;1861), was born in a meagre two-room cottage in Emdale, [[Loughbrickland]], [[County Down]], [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser 4&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 3&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first of ten children born to Hugh Brunty and Eleanor McCrory, a couple of poor Irish peasant farmers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 2&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The family [[surname]] ''mac Aedh Ó Proinntigh'' had been earlier [[Anglicisation|Anglicised]] as Prunty or sometimes Brunty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser 4&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'''', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Struggling against poverty, Patrick learned how to read and write and from 1798 to teach others. In 1802, at the age of twenty-six, he won a place at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] to study theology at [[St. John's College, Cambridge|St. John's College]]. There he gave up his original name, Brunty, and called himself by the more distinguished Brontë. In 1807 he was ordained in the priesthood in the Church of England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 14&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; He served as an assistant priest or [[curate]] in various parishes and in 1810 he published his first poem ''Winter Evening Thoughts'' in a local newspaper,&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 41&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; followed in 1811 by a collection of moral verse, ''Cottage Poems''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 43&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; In 1811, he was made vicar of St. Peter's church in [[Hartshead]] in [[Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 36&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he was appointed an examiner of Bible knowledge at a [[John Wesley|Wesleyan]] academy, [[Woodhouse Grove School]]. There, at age thirty-five, he met his future wife, Maria Branwell, the headmaster's niece.

Anne's mother, [[Maria Branwell]] (1783&amp;ndash;1821), was the daughter of a successful, property-owning grocer and tea merchant of [[Penzance]], Thomas Branwell and Anne Crane, the daughter of a silversmith in the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser 12 -13&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'', pp. 12&amp;ndash;13&lt;/ref&gt; The eighth of eleven children, Maria had enjoyed all the benefits of belonging to a prosperous family in a small town. After the death of both parents within a year of each other, Maria went to help her aunt with the teaching at the school. A tiny, neat woman, aged thirty, she was well read and intelligent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser 15&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Her strong [[Methodist]] faith immediately attracted Patrick Brontë.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 48&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Though from vastly different backgrounds, within three months Patrick Brontë and Maria Branwell were married on 29 December 1812.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser 16&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Their first child, Maria (1814&amp;ndash;1825), was born after their move to [[Hartshead]]. In 1815, Patrick was made curate of a chapel in the little village of [[Thornton, West Yorkshire|Thornton]], near Bradford; a second daughter, Elizabeth (1815&amp;ndash;1825), was born shortly after.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 61&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Four more children would follow: [[Charlotte Brontë|Charlotte]], (1816&amp;ndash;1855), [[Branwell Brontë|Patrick Branwell]] (1817&amp;ndash;1848), [[Emily Brontë|Emily]], (1818&amp;ndash;1848) and Anne (1820&amp;ndash;1849).

==Early life==
Anne, the youngest member of the Brontë family, was born on 17 January 1820, at number 74 Market Street in the village of [[Thornton, West Yorkshire|Thornton]], [[Bradford]], Yorkshire, England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 86&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; When Anne was born, her father was the curate of Thornton and she was baptised there on 25 March 1820. Shortly after, Anne's father took a perpetual curacy, a secure but not enriching vocation, in Haworth, a remote small town some seven miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) away. In April 1820, The Brontë family moved into the Haworth Parsonage. This five-room building became the Brontës' family home for the rest of their lives.

Anne was barely a year old when her mother became ill of what is believed to have been [[uterine cancer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 102 -104&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', pp. 102&amp;ndash;104&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Branwell died on 15 September 1821.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser 28&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In order to provide a mother for his children, Patrick tried to remarry, but he had no success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser 30&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Maria's sister, Elizabeth Branwell (1776&amp;ndash;1842), had moved into the parsonage, initially to nurse her dying sister, but she subsequently spent the rest of her life there raising the Brontë children. She did it from a sense of duty, but she was a stern woman who expected respect, rather than love.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser 29&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; There was little affection between her and the eldest children, but to Anne, her favorite according to tradition, she did relate. Anne shared a room with her aunt, they were particularly close, and this may have strongly influenced Anne's personality and religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gérin 35&quot;&gt;Gérin, ''Anne Brontë'', p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s biography, Anne's father remembered her as precocious, reporting that once, when she was four years old, in reply to his question about what a child most wanted, she answered: &quot;age and experience&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot; Fraser 31&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the summer of 1824, Patrick sent his eldest daughters Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte and Emily to Crofton Hall in [[Crofton, West Yorkshire]], and later to the Clergy Daughter's School, [[Cowan Bridge]], [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser 35&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; When the two eldest siblings died of consumption in 1825, Maria on 6 May and Elizabeth on 15 June, Charlotte and Emily were immediately brought home.&lt;ref name=&quot; Fraser 31&quot;/&gt; The unexpected deaths of Anne's two eldest sisters distressed the bereaved family enough that Patrick could not face sending them away again. For the next five years, all the Brontë children were educated at home, largely by their father and aunt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser 44-45&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'', pp. 44&amp;ndash;45&lt;/ref&gt; The young Brontës made little attempt to mix with others outside the parsonage, but relied upon each other for friendship and companionship. The bleak moors surrounding Haworth became their playground.

==Education==
[[Image:Anne Bronte.jpg|thumb|Anne Brontë, by [[Charlotte Brontë]], 1834]] 
Anne's studies at home included music and drawing. Anne, Emily and Branwell had piano lessons at the parsonage from the Keighley parish organist. The Brontë children received art lessons from John Bradley of Keighley and all of them drew with some skill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 150&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Their aunt tried to make sure the girls knew how to run a household, but their minds were more inclined to literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser 45&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Their father's well-stocked library was a main source of knowledge. They read the [[Bible]], [[Homer]], [[Virgil]], [[Shakespeare]], [[John Milton|Milton]], [[Byron]], [[Walter Scott|Scott]], and many others, and examined articles from [[Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine]], [[Fraser's Magazine]], and The Edinburgh Review. In addition, they read history, geography and biographies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser 45-48&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'', pp. 45&amp;ndash;48&lt;/ref&gt;

Those readings fed the Brontës' imaginations. The children's creativity soared after their father presented Branwell with a set of toy soldiers in June 1826. They named the soldiers and developed their characters, which they called the &quot;Twelves&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The soldiers appear in ''[[The Twelve and the Genii]]'', a 1962 children's fantasy novel by [[Pauline Clarke]].&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the creation of an imaginary world: the African kingdom of &quot;[[Angria (fictional country)|Angria]]&quot;. That was illustrated with maps and watercolour renderings. The children kept themselves busy devising plots about the people of Angria, and its capital city, &quot;Glass Town&quot;, later called Verreopolis, and finally, Verdopolis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 154-155&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', pp. 154&amp;ndash;155&lt;/ref&gt;  

These fantasy worlds and kingdoms gradually acquired all the characteristics of the real world&amp;mdash;sovereigns, armies, heroes, outlaws, fugitives, inns, schools and publishers. For these peoples and lands the children created newspapers, magazines and chronicles, all of which were written out in extremely tiny books, with writing that was so small it was difficult to read without the aid of a magnifying glass. These juvenile creations and writings served as the apprenticeship of their later, literary talents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser 48-58&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'', pp. 48&amp;ndash;58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Juvenilia==
Around 1831, when Anne was eleven, she and her sister Emily broke away from Charlotte and Branwell in the creation and development of the fictional sagas of Angria establishing their own fantasy world of Gondal. Anne was at this time particularly close to Emily; the closeness of their relationship was reinforced by Charlotte's departure for Roe Head School, in January 1831.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser 52-53&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'', pp. 52&amp;ndash;53&lt;/ref&gt; When Charlotte's friend [[Ellen Nussey]] visited Haworth in 1833, she reported that Emily and Anne were &quot;like twins&quot;, &quot;inseparable companions&quot;. She described Anne at this time: 
&quot;Anne, dear gentle Anne was quite different in appearance from the others, and she was her aunt's favourite. Her hair was a very pretty light brown, and fell on her neck in graceful curls. She had lovely violet-blue eyes; fine pencilled eyebrows and a clear almost transparent complexion. She still pursued her studies and especially her sewing, under the surveillance of her aunt.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chitham 39&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''A Life of Anne Brontë'', p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 195&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;
Anne also took lessons from Charlotte, after she came back from the boarding school, at Roe Head. Later, Anne began more formal studies at Miss Wooler's school at Roe Head, [[Huddersfield]]. Charlotte returned there on 29 July 1835 as a teacher. Emily accompanied her as a pupil; her tuition largely financed by Charlotte's teaching. Within a few months, Emily was unable to adapt to life at school, and by October, was physically ill from homesickness. She was withdrawn from the school and replaced by Anne.

At fifteen, it was Anne's first time away from home, and she made few friends at Roe Head. She was quiet and hard working, and determined to stay and get the education that would allow her to support herself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 237-238&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', pp. 237&amp;ndash;238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser 84&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Anne stayed for two years, winning a good-conduct medal in December 1836, and returning home only during Christmas and the summer holidays.
Anne and Charlotte do not appear to have been close during their time at Roe Head (Charlotte's letters almost never mention Anne) but Charlotte was concerned about the health of her sister. At some point before December 1837, Anne became seriously ill with [[gastritis]] and underwent a religious crisis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser 113&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] minister was called to see Anne several times during her illness, suggesting that her distress was caused, at least in part, by conflict with the local Anglican clergy. Charlotte was sufficiently concerned about Anne's illness to notify Patrick Brontë, and to take Anne home where she remained to recover.

==Employment at Blake Hall==
Little is known about Anne's life during 1838, but in 1839, a year after leaving the school and at the age of nineteen, she was actively looking for a teaching position. As the daughter of a poor clergyman, she needed to earn a living. Her father had no private income and the parsonage would revert to the church on his death. Teaching or being a governess in a private family were among the few options available to poor but educated women. In April, 1839, Anne began to work as a governess with the Ingham family at Blake Hall, near [[Mirfield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 307&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

The children in Anne's charge were spoilt and wild, and persistently disobeyed and tormented her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 308&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; She experienced great difficulty controlling them, and had almost no success in instilling any education. She was not empowered to inflict any punishment, and when she complained of their behaviour to their parents, she received no support, but was merely criticized for not being capable of her job. The Inghams, unsatisfied with their children's progress, dismissed Anne at the end of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 318&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; She returned home at Christmas, 1839, joining Charlotte and Emily, who had left their positions, and Branwell. The whole episode at Blake Hall was so traumatic for Anne, that she reproduced it in almost perfect detail in her later novel, ''Agnes Grey''.

==William Weightman==
At Anne's return to Haworth, she met William Weightman (1814–1842), Patrick's new curate, who began work in the parish in August 1839.&lt;ref name = &quot; Alexander &amp; Smith, 531&quot;&gt;Alexander &amp; Smith, '' The Oxford Companion to the Brontës'',  p. 531&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-five years old, he had obtained a two-year licentiate in theology from the [[University of Durham]]. He quickly became welcome at the parsonage. Anne's acquaintance with William Weightman parallels the writing of a number of poems, which may suggest that she fell in love with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 341&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 407&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable disagreement over this point.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 344&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; Not much outside evidence exists beyond a teasing anecdote of Charlotte's to Ellen Nussey in January 1842. 

It may or may not be relevant that the source of ''Agnes Grey'' 's renewed interest in poetry is the curate to whom she is attracted. As the person to whom Anne Brontë may have been attracted, William Weightman has aroused much curiosity. It seems clear that he was a good-looking, engaging young man, whose easy humour and kindness towards the Brontë sisters made a considerable impression. It is such a character that she portrays in Edward Weston, and that her heroine Agnes Grey finds deeply appealing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gérin 138&quot;&gt;Gérin, ''Anne Brontë'', p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

If Anne did form an attachment to Weightman, that does not imply that he, in turn, was attracted to her. Indeed, it is entirely possible that Weightman was no more aware of her than of her sisters or their friend Ellen Nussey. Nor does it follow that Anne believed him to be interested in her. If anything, her poems suggest just the opposite–they speak of quietly experienced but intensely felt emotions, intentionally hidden from others, without any indication of their being requited. It is also possible that an initially mild attraction to Weightman assumed increasing importance to Anne over time, in the absence of other opportunities for love, marriage, and children.

Anne would have seen William Weightman on her holidays at home, particularly during the summer of 1842, when her sisters were away. He died of cholera in the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 403&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 403&lt;/ref&gt; Anne expressed her grief for his death in her poem &quot;I will  not mourn thee, lovely one&quot;,  in which she called him &quot;our darling&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot; Alexander &amp; Smith, 531&quot;/&gt;

==Governess==
Anne soon obtained a second post: this time as a governess to the children of the Reverend Edmund Robinson and his wife Lydia, at Thorp Green, a wealthy country house near [[York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 329&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Thorp Green appeared later as Horton Lodge in her novel ''Agnes Grey''. Anne was to have four pupils: Lydia, age 15, Elizabeth, age 13, Mary, age 12, and Edmund, age 8.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 330&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, she encountered the same problems with the unruly children that she had experienced at Blake Hall. Anne missed her home and family, commenting in a diary paper in 1841 that she did not like her situation and wished to leave it. Her own quiet, gentle disposition did not help matters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gérin 135&quot;&gt;Gérin, ''Anne Brontë'', p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite her outwardly placid appearance, Anne was determined and with the experience she gradually gained, she eventually made a success of her position, becoming well liked by her new employers. Her charges, the Robinson girls, ultimately became her lifelong friends.

For the next five years, Anne spent no more than five or six weeks a year with her family, during holidays at Christmas and in June. The rest of her time she was with the Robinsons at their home Thorp Green. She was also obliged to accompany the family on their annual holidays to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]. Between 1840 and 1844, Anne spent around five weeks each summer at the resort, and loved the place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 358-359&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', pp. 358&amp;ndash;359&lt;/ref&gt; A number of locations in Scarborough formed the setting for ''Agnes Grey'' 's final scenes.

During the time working for the Robinsons, Anne and her sisters considered the possibility of setting-up their own school. Various locations, including their own home, the parsonage, were considered as places to establish it. The project never materialized and Anne chose repeatedly to return to Thorp Green. She came home at the death of her aunt in early November 1842, while her sisters were away in Brussels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 404&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Branwell left a £350 legacy for each of her nieces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 409&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne returned to Thorp Green in January 1843. She secured a position for Branwell with her employers: he was to take over from her as tutor to the Robinsons' son, Edmund, the only boy in the family, who was growing too old to be under Anne's care. However Branwell did not live in the house with the Robinson family, as Anne did. Anne's vaunted calm appears to have been the result of hard-fought battles, balancing deeply felt emotions with careful thought, a sense of responsibility, and resolute determination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gérin 134&quot;&gt;Gérin, ''Anne Brontë'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; All three Brontë sisters had spent time working as governesses or teachers, and all had experienced problems controlling their charges, gaining support from their employers, and coping with homesickness&amp;mdash;but Anne was the only one who persevered and made a success of her work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxcomp&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Christine|coauthors=Margaret Smith|title=The Oxford Companion to the Brontes|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2003|isbn=0-19-866218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Back at the parsonage==
[[Image:Bronte Parsonage Museum.JPG|thumb| 200px|[[Brontë Parsonage Museum]]]]
Anne and Branwell continued to teach at Thorp Green for the next two years. However, Branwell was enticed into a secret relationship with his employer's wife, Lydia Robinson. When Anne and her brother returned home for the holidays in June 1845, she resigned her position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 450&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; While Anne gave no reason for leaving Thorp Green, it is generally believed that she chose to leave upon becoming aware of the relationship between her brother and Mrs. Robinson. Branwell was sternly dismissed when his employer found out about his relationship with his wife. In spite of her brother's behaviour, Anne retained close ties to Elizabeth and Mary Robinson, exchanging frequent letters with them even after Branwell's disgrace. The Robinson sisters came to visit Anne in December 1848.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 574&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 574&lt;/ref&gt; 

Once free of her position as a governess, Anne took Emily to visit some of the places she had come to know and love in the past five years. An initial plan of going to the sea at [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] fell through, and the sisters went instead to [[York]], where Anne showed her sister the [[York Minster]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 451&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 451&lt;/ref&gt;

==A book of poems==
[[File:Painting of Brontë sisters.png|thumb|200px|The {{unicode|Brontë}} sisters, painted by their brother, [[Branwell Brontë|Branwell]], c. 1834. From left to right: Anne, Emily and Charlotte (there still remains a shadow of Branwell, which appeared after he painted himself out).]]
In the summer of 1845, all four of the Brontës were at home with their father Patrick. None of the four had any immediate prospect of employment. It was at this point that Charlotte came across Emily's poems. They had been shared only with Anne, her partner in the world of Gondal. Charlotte proposed that they be published. Anne also revealed her own poems. Charlotte's reaction was characteristically patronizing: &quot;I thought that these verses too had a sweet sincere pathos of their own&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, though not easily, the sisters reached an agreement. They told neither Branwell, nor their father, nor their friends about what they were doing. Anne and Emily each contributed 21 poems and Charlotte with nineteen. With Aunt Branwell's money, the Brontë sisters paid to have the collection published.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxcomp&quot;/&gt;

Afraid that their work would be judged differently if they revealed their identity as women, the book appeared under their three chosen pseudonyms&amp;mdash;or pen-names, the initials of which were the same as their own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 480&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 480&lt;/ref&gt; Charlotte became Currer Bell, Emily became Ellis Bell and Anne became Acton Bell. ''[[Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell]]'' was available for sale in May 1846. The cost of publication was about ¾ of Anne's annual salary at Thorp Green. On 7 May 1846, the first three copies of the book were delivered to Haworth Parsonage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 491&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; The volume achieved three somewhat favourable reviews, but was a dismal failure, with only two copies being sold during the first year. Anne, however, began to find a market for her more recent poetry. Both the Leeds Intelligencer and Fraser's Magazine published her poem &quot;The Narrow Way&quot; under her pseudonym, Acton Bell. Four months earlier, in August, Fraser's Magazine had also published her poem &quot;The Three Guides&quot;.

==Novelist==
===''Agnes Grey''===
{{Main|Agnes Grey}}
Even before the fate of the book of poems became apparent, the three sisters were working on a new project. They began to work on their first novels. Charlotte wrote ''[[The Professor (novel)|The Professor]]'', Emily ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', and Anne ''Agnes Grey''. By July 1846, a package with the three manuscripts was making the rounds of London publishers.

After a number of rejections, Emily's ''Wuthering Heights'' and Anne's ''Agnes Grey'' were accepted by a publisher in London, but Charlotte's novel was rejected by every other publisher to whom it was sent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 525&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 525&lt;/ref&gt; However, Charlotte was not long in completing her second novel, the now famous ''Jane Eyre'', and this was immediately accepted by [[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]], a different publisher from Anne's and Emily's though also located in London. However, ''Jane Eyre'' was the first to appear in print. While Anne and Emily's novels 'lingered in the press', Charlotte's second novel became an immediate and resounding success. Meanwhile, Anne and Emily were obliged to pay fifty pounds to help meet the publishing costs. Their publisher, urged on by the success of ''Jane Eyre'', finally published Emily's ''Wuthering Heights'' and Anne's ''Agnes Grey'' in December 1847.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 539&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 539&lt;/ref&gt; These two sold exceptionally well, but ''Agnes Grey'' was distinctly outshone by Emily's much more dramatic ''Wuthering Heights''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 540&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 540&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall''===
{{Main|The Tenant of Wildfell Hall}}
Anne's second novel, ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'', was published in the last week of June 1848.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 557&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 557&lt;/ref&gt; It was an instant phenomenal success; within six weeks it was sold out.

''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'' is perhaps the most shocking of the Brontës' novels. In seeking to present the truth in literature, Anne's depiction of alcoholism and debauchery were profoundly disturbing to nineteenth century readers. Helen Graham, the tenant of the title, intrigues Gilbert Markham and gradually she reveals her mysterious past as an artist and wife of the dissipated Arthur Huntingdon. The book's brilliance lies in its revelation of the position of women at the time, and its multi-layered plot.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is easy today to underestimate the extent to which the novel challenged existing social and legal structures. [[May Sinclair]], in 1913, said that the slamming of Helen Huntingdon's bedroom door against her husband reverberated throughout Victorian England. Anne's heroine eventually leaves her husband to protect their young son from his influence. She supports herself and her son by painting, while living in hiding, fearful of discovery. In doing so, she violates not only social conventions, but also English law. At the time, a married woman had no independent legal existence, apart from her husband; could not own her own property, sue for divorce, or control custody of her children. If she attempted to live apart from him, her husband had the right to reclaim her. If she took their child with her, she was liable for kidnapping. In living off her own earnings, she was held to be stealing her husband's property, since any income she made was legally his.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxcomp&quot;/&gt;

==London visit==
In July 1848, in order to dispel the rumour that the three &quot;Bell brothers&quot; were all the same person, Charlotte and Anne went to London to reveal their identities to the publisher George Smith. The women spent several days in his company. Many years after Anne's death, he wrote in the [[Cornhill Magazine]] his impressions of her, describing her as:
&quot;...a gentle, quiet, rather subdued person, by no means pretty, yet of a pleasing appearance. Her manner was curiously expressive of a wish for protection and encouragement, a kind of constant appeal which invited sympathy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 559&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 559&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second edition of ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'', which appeared in August 1848, Anne clearly stated her intentions in writing it. She presented a forceful rebuttal to critics who considered her portrayal of Huntingdon overly graphic and disturbing. (Charlotte was among them.)

{{quote|When we have to do with vice and vicious characters, I maintain it is better to depict them as they really are than as they would wish to appear. To represent a bad thing in its least offensive light, is doubtless the most agreeable course for a writer of fiction to pursue; but is it the most honest, or the safest? Is it better to reveal the snares and pitfalls of life to the young and thoughtless traveller, or to cover them with branches and flowers? O Reader! if there were less of this delicate concealment of facts–this whispering 'Peace, peace', when there is no peace,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jeremiah|6:14|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; there would be less of sin and misery to the young of both sexes who are left to wring their bitter knowledge from experience.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 532&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 532&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anne also sharply castigated reviewers who speculated on the sex of the authors, and the appropriateness of their writing to their sex, in words that do little to reinforce the stereotype of Anne as meek and gentle.

{{quote|I am satisfied that if a book is a good one, it is so whatever the sex of the author may be. All novels are or should be written for both men and women to read, and I am at a loss to conceive how a man should permit himself to write anything that would be really disgraceful to a woman, or why a woman should be censured for writing anything that would be proper and becoming for a man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 564&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 564&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The increasing popularity of the Bells' work led to renewed interest in the ''Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell'', originally published by Aylott and Jones. The remaining print run was purchased by Smith and Elder, and reissued under new covers in November 1848. It still sold poorly.

==Family tragedies==
Only in their late twenties, a highly successful literary career appeared a certainty for Anne and her sisters. However, an impending tragedy was to engulf the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 564&quot;/&gt; Within the next ten months, three of the siblings, including Anne, would be dead.

Branwell's health had gradually deteriorated over the previous two years, but its seriousness was half disguised by his persistent drunkenness. He died on the morning of 24 September 1848.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 568&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 568&lt;/ref&gt; His sudden death came as a shock to the family. He was aged just thirty-one. The cause was recorded as chronic bronchitis - [[marasmus]]; though, through his recorded symptoms, it is now believed that he was also suffering from tuberculosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography of Anne Brontë&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2009-10-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole family had suffered from coughs and colds during the winter of 1848 and it was Emily who next became severely ill. She deteriorated rapidly over a two month period, persistently refusing all medical aid until the morning of 19 December, when, being so weak, she declared: &quot;if you will send for a doctor, I will see him now&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 576&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 576&lt;/ref&gt; It was far too late. At about two o'clock that afternoon, after a hard, short conflict in which she struggled desperately to hang on to life, she died, aged just thirty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 576&quot;/&gt;

Emily's death deeply affected Anne and her grief further undermined her physical health.&lt;ref&gt;Gaskell EC. The Life of Charlotte Bronte: author of ‘Jane Eyre,’ ‘Shirley,’ ‘Villete,’ ‘The Professor,’ etc., Elder Smith, 1896, p. 287  [http://books.google.com/books?id=1ShQQbj0BG4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Gaskell+Life+Bronte&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UlxVTbbtCsH6lweXypndBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Keeper&amp;f=false read online or download]&lt;/ref&gt; Over Christmas, Anne caught influenza. Her symptoms intensified, and in early January, her father sent for a [[Leeds]] physician, who diagnosed her condition as consumption, and intimated that it was quite advanced leaving little hope of a recovery. Anne met the news with characteristic determination and self-control.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Emily, Anne took all the recommended medicines, and responded to all the advice she was given.&lt;ref name = &quot; Alexander &amp; Smith, 72&quot;&gt;Alexander &amp; Smith, '' The Oxford Companion to the Brontës'',  p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; That same month Anne wrote her last poem, &quot; A dreadful darkness closes in&quot;, in which she deals with the realization of being terminally ill.&lt;ref name = &quot; Alexander &amp; Smith, 170&quot;&gt;Alexander &amp; Smith, '' The Oxford Companion to the Brontës'',  p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Her health fluctuated as the months passed, but she progressively grew thinner and weaker.

==Death==
[[Image:Annebronte.jpg|right|thumb|Anne Brontë's grave at Scarborough]]
In February 1849, Anne seemed somewhat better.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 588&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 588&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, she had decided to make a return visit to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] in the hope that the change of location and fresh sea air might initiate a recovery, and give her a chance to live.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 587&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 587&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 May 1849, Anne said her goodbyes to her father and the servants at Haworth, and set off for Scarborough with Charlotte and their friend [[Ellen Nussey]]. En route, the three spent a day and a night in York, where, escorting Anne around in a wheelchair, they did some shopping, and at Anne's request, visited the colossal [[York Minster]]. However, it was clear that Anne had little strength left.

On Sunday, 27 May, Anne asked Charlotte whether it would be easier for her if she return home to die instead of remaining at Scarborough. A doctor, consulted the next day, indicated that death was already close. Anne received the news quietly. She expressed her love and concern for Ellen and Charlotte, and seeing Charlotte's distress, whispered to her to &quot;take courage&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 594&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 594&lt;/ref&gt; Conscious and calm, Anne died at about two o'clock in the afternoon, Monday, 28 May 1849. 

Over the following few days, Charlotte made the decision to &quot;lay the flower where it had fallen&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography of Anne Brontë&quot;/&gt; Anne was buried not in Haworth with the rest of her family, but in Scarborough. The funeral was held on Wednesday, 30 May, which did not allow time for Patrick Brontë to make the {{convert|70|mi|km|sing=on}} trip to Scarborough, had he wished to do so. The former schoolmistress at Roe Head, Miss Wooler, was also in Scarborough at this time, and she was the only other mourner at Anne's funeral.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 575&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 575&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried in St. Mary's churchyard; beneath the castle walls, and overlooking the bay. Charlotte commissioned a stone to be placed over her grave, with the simple inscription &quot;Here lie the remains of Anne Brontë, daughter of the Revd. P. Brontë, Incumbent of Haworth, Yorkshire. She died, Aged 28, May 28th, 1849&quot;. Anne was actually twenty-nine at her death.

==Reputation==
A year after Anne's death, further editions of her novels were required; however, Charlotte prevented re-publication of Anne's second novel, ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall''.&lt;ref name=&quot; Fraser 387&quot;&gt;Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850, Charlotte wrote damningly &quot;''Wildfell Hall'' it hardly appears to me desirable to preserve. The choice of subject in that work is a mistake, it was too little consonant with the character, tastes and ideas of the gentle, retiring inexperienced writer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 654&quot;&gt;Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 654&lt;/ref&gt;
This act was the predominant cause of Anne's relegation to the back seat of the Brontë bandwagon. Anne's novel was daring for the Victorian era with its depiction of scenes of mental and physical cruelty and approach to divorce. The consequence was that Charlotte's novels, along with Emily's ''Wuthering Heights'', continued to be published, firmly launching these two sisters into literary stardom, while Anne's work was consigned to oblivion. Further, Anne was only twenty-eight when she wrote ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall''; at a comparable age, Charlotte had produced only ''The Professor''. 

The general view has been that Anne is a mere shadow compared with Charlotte, the family's most prolific writer, and Emily, the genius. This has occurred to a large extent because Anne was very different, as a person and as a writer, from Charlotte and Emily. The controlled, reflective camera eye of ''Agnes Grey'' is closer to [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' than to Charlotte Brontë's ''Jane Eyre''. The painstaking realism and social criticism of ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'' directly counters the romanticized violence of ''Wuthering Heights''. Anne's religious concerns, reflected in her books and expressed directly in her poems, were not concerns shared by her sisters. Anne's subtle prose has a fine ironic edge; her novels also reveal Anne to be the most socially radical of the three. Now, with increasing critical interest in female authors, her life is being reexamined, and her work reevaluated. A re-appraisal of Anne's work has begun, gradually leading to her acceptance, not as a minor Brontë, but as a major literary figure in her own right.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [[Glen Downey (writer)|Glen Downey]]'s &quot;The Critics of Wildfell Hall&quot; [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/bronte/abronte/downey2.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a [[Latin]]-speaking [[philosopher]] and [[theologian]] who lived in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Africa Province]]. His writings were very influential in the development of [[Western Christianity]].

According to his contemporary, [[Jerome]], Augustine &quot;established anew the ancient Faith&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome]] wrote to Augustine in 418: &quot;You are known throughout the world; Catholics honour and esteem you as the one who has established anew the ancient Faith&quot; (''conditor antiquae rursum fidei'').

When the [[Western Roman Empire]] was starting to disintegrate, Augustine developed the concept of the Church as a spiritual [[New Jerusalem#Christianity|City of God]] (in [[City of God (book)|a book of the same name]]), distinct from the material Earthly City.&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Durant | first = Will | title = Caesar and Christ: a History of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Civilization and of Christianity from Their Beginnings to A.D. 325 | publisher = MJF Books | location = New York| year = 1992 | isbn = 1567310141 |authorlink=Will Durant}}&lt;/ref&gt; His thought profoundly influenced the medieval worldview. Augustine's ''City of God'' was closely identified with the church, the community that worshipped [[Trinity|God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilken | first = Robert L. | title = The Spirit of Early Christian Thought | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 2003 | isbn = 0300105983 |page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]], he is a saint and pre-eminent [[Doctor of the Church]], and the patron of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian religious order]]; his memorial is celebrated 28 August, the day of his death. He is the patron saint of brewers, printers, theologians, sore eyes, and a number of cities and dioceses.&lt;ref name=&quot;KnoYrSaint&quot;&gt;[http://www.catholicapologetics.info/library/saints/index.htm Know Your Patron Saint].&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Protestantism|Protestants]], especially [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], consider him to be one of the theological fathers of [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] due to his teaching on [[salvation]] and [[divine grace]].

==Life==
===Early childhood===
[[File:Augustine Lateran.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Earliest portrait of Augustine, from the 6th century]]
Augustine was born in 354 to a pagan father named Patricius and a Christian mother named [[Saint Monica|Monica]] in the [[municipium]] of Thagaste (now [[Souk Ahras]], [[Algeria]]) in [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul MacKendrick]], ''The North African Stones Speak‎'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1980; p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Early Christianity'', [[Everett Ferguson]], Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998, p.776&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding his ethnic origins, there is a consensus among scholars that his origins represented an intermingling of the main North African peoples, that is Berbers, Latins and Phoenicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;KP&quot;&gt;Kim Power, &quot;Family, Relatives&quot;, ''Augustine through the ages: an encyclopedia''. Allan D. Fitzgerald (ed.). Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1999, pp. 353 &amp;ndash; 354. ISBN 978-0-8028-3843-8&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine's family name, Aurelius, suggests that his father's ancestors were [[liberti|freedmen]] of the ''[[Aurelia (gens)|gens Aurelia]]'' given full Roman citizenship by the [[Edict of Caracalla]] in [[212]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KP&quot;/&gt; Augustine's family had been Roman, from a legal standpoint, for at least a century when he was born.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Lancel, ''Saint Augustine'', Hymns Ancient &amp; Modern Ltd, 2002, p5&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed that his mother, Monica, was of [[Berber people|Berber]] origin, on the basis of her name,&lt;ref name=&quot;KP&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brett and Elizabeth Fentress, ''The Berbers'', Wiley-Blackwell, 1997, p.71, 293&lt;/ref&gt; but as his family were ''honestiores'', Augustine's first language is likely to have been Latin.&lt;ref name=&quot;KP&quot;/&gt; At the age of 11, Augustine was sent to school at Madaurus (now [[M'Daourouch]]), a small [[Numidia]]n city about 19 miles south of Thagaste. There he became familiar with [[Latin literature]], as well as pagan beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Knowles and Pachomios Penkett, ''Augustine and his World'' Ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; While at home in 369 and 370, he read [[Cicero]]'s [[dialogue]] ''Hortensius'' (now lost), which he described as leaving a lasting impression on him and sparking his interest in philosophy.&lt;ref name=EA&gt;''Encyclopedia Americana'', v.2, p. 685. Danbury, CT: Grolier Incorporated, 1997. ISBN 0-7172-0129-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studying at Carthage===
At age 17, through the generosity of fellow citizen Romanianus,&lt;ref name=EA/&gt; Augustine went to [[Carthage]] to continue his education in [[rhetoric]]. Although raised as a Christian, Augustine left the church to follow the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean religion]], much to the despair of his mother.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} As a youth Augustine lived a [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyle for a time, associating with young men who boasted of their experience with the opposite sex and urged the inexperienced boys, like Augustine, to seek out experiences with women or to make up stories about experiences in order to gain acceptance and avoid ridicule.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 3:3&lt;/ref&gt; At a young age, he began an affair with a young woman in Carthage. She was his lover for over thirteen years and gave birth to his son Adeodatus.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 4:2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching rhetoric===
During the years 373 and 374, Augustine taught grammar at Thagaste. The following year he moved to Carthage to conduct a school of rhetoric, and would remain there for the next nine years.&lt;ref name=EA/&gt; Disturbed by the unruly behavior of the students in Carthage, in 383 he moved to establish a school in Rome, where he believed the best and brightest rhetoricians practiced. However, Augustine was disappointed with the Roman schools, where he was met with apathy. Once the time came for his students to pay their fees they simply fled. Manichaean friends introduced him to the prefect of the City of Rome, [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]], who had been asked to provide a professor of rhetoric for the imperial court at [[Milan]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
[[File:Sainte Monique.jpg|left|thumb|&quot;St Augustine and [[Monica (Christian saint)|Monica]]&quot; (1846), by [[Ary Scheffer]].]]

Augustine won the job and headed north to take up his position in late 384. At the age of thirty, he had won the most visible academic position in the Latin world – at a time when such posts gave ready access to political careers. During this period, although Augustine showed some fervor for Manichaeism, he was never an initiate or &quot;elect&quot; but remained an &quot;auditor&quot;, the lowest level in the sect's hierarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02084a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia] St. Augustine of Hippo, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was in Milan, Augustine's life changed. While still at Carthage, he had begun to move away from Manichaeism, in part because of a disappointing meeting with the Manichean Bishop, Faustus of Mileve, a key exponent of Manichaean theology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; In Rome, he is reported to have completely turned away from Manichaeanism, and instead embraced the [[Philosophical skepticism|skepticism]] of the New Academy movement. At Milan, his mother pressured him to become a Christian. Augustine's own studies in [[Neoplatonism]] were also leading him in this direction, and his friend Simplicianus urged him that way as well.&lt;ref name=EA/&gt; But it was the bishop of Milan, [[Ambrose]], who had most influence over Augustine. Ambrose was a master of rhetoric like Augustine himself, but older and more experienced.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Augustine's mother had followed him to Milan and he allowed her to arrange a society marriage, for which he abandoned his concubine. It is believed that Augustine truly loved the woman he had lived with for so long. In his &quot;Confessions,&quot; he expressed how deeply he was hurt by ending this relationship, and also admitted that the experience eventually produced a decreased sensitivity to pain over time. However, he had to wait two years until his fiancee came of age, so despite the grief he felt over leaving &quot;The One&quot;, as he called her, he soon took another concubine. Augustine eventually broke off his engagement to his eleven-year-old fiancee, but never renewed his relationship with &quot;The One&quot; and soon left his second concubine. It was during this period that he uttered his famous prayer, &quot;Grant me [[chastity]] and continence, but not yet&quot; (''da mihi castitatem et continentiam, sed noli modo'').&lt;ref&gt;''Conf.'' 8.7.17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian conversion===
In the summer of 386, after having read an account of the life of [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony of the Desert]], which greatly inspired him, Augustine underwent a profound personal crisis, leading him to convert to Christianity, abandon his career in rhetoric, quit his teaching position in Milan, give up any ideas of marriage, and devote himself entirely to serving [[God]] and to the practices of [[priesthood]], which included [[clerical celibacy|celibacy]]. According to Augustine his conversion was prompted by a childlike voice he heard telling him in a sing-song voice, &quot;''tolle, lege''&quot; (&quot;take up and read&quot;):

{{quotation|I cast myself down I know not how, under a certain fig-tree, giving full vent to my tears; and the floods of mine eyes gushed out an acceptable sacrifice to Thee. And, not indeed in these words, yet to this purpose, spake I much unto Thee: and Thou, O Lord, how long? how long, Lord, wilt Thou be angry for ever? Remember not our former iniquities, for I felt that I was held by them. I sent up these sorrowful words: How long, how long, &quot;to-morrow, and tomorrow?&quot; Why not now? why not is there this hour an end to my uncleanness?
So was I speaking and weeping in the most bitter contrition of my heart, when, lo! I heard from a neighbouring house a voice, as of boy or girl, I know not, chanting, and oft repeating, &quot;Take up and read; Take up and read. &quot; Instantly, my countenance altered, I began to think most intently whether children were wont in any kind of play to sing such words: nor could I remember ever to have heard the like. So checking the torrent of my tears, I arose; interpreting it to be no other than a command from God to open the book, and read the first chapter I should find. For I had heard of Antony, that coming in during the reading of the Gospel, he received the admonition, as if what was being read was spoken to him: Go, sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come and follow me: and by such oracle he was forthwith converted unto Thee. Eagerly then I returned to the place where Alypius was sitting; for there had I laid the volume of the Apostle when I arose thence. I seized, opened, and in silence read that section on which my eyes first fell: Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying; but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, in concupiscence. No further would I read; nor needed I: for instantly at the end of this sentence, by a light as it were of serenity infused into my heart, all the darkness of doubt vanished away.|''The Confessions of Saint Augustine'', Book VIII, Paragraphs 28 and 29.}}

The volume Augustine read was Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]] (Romans 13: 13-14). He wrote an account of his conversion in his ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', which became a classic of Christian theology. Ambrose baptized Augustine, along with his son, Adeodatus, on [[Easter Vigil]] in 387 in Milan, and a year later they returned to Africa.&lt;ref name=EA/&gt; Also in 388 he completed his ''[[Christian apologetics|apology]]'' ''On the Holiness of the Catholic Church''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; On the way back to Africa Augustine's mother died, and Adeodatus soon after.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Priesthood===
Upon his return to north Africa Augustine sold his patrimony and gave the money to the poor. The only thing he kept was the family house, which he converted into a [[monastic]] foundation for himself and a group of friends.&lt;ref name=EA/&gt; In 391 he was [[ordination|ordained]] a [[priest]] in [[Hippo Regius]] (now [[Annaba]], in [[Algeria]]). He became a famous [[preacher]] (more than 350 preserved sermons are believed to be authentic), and was noted for combating the Manichaean religion, to which he had formerly adhered.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In 395 he was made [[coadjutor Bishop]] of Hippo, and became full Bishop shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Peter. Augustine of Hippo: A Biography. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in this position until his death in 430. Augustine worked tirelessly in trying to convince the people of Hippo to convert to Christianity. He left his monastery, but continued to lead a monastic life in the episcopal residence. He left a ''[[Monastic rule|regula]]'' his monastery that has led him to be designated the &quot;[[patron saint]] of [[regular clergy]]&quot;{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Much of Augustine's later life was recorded by his friend [[Possidius]], bishop of [[Calama (titular see)|Calama]] (present-day [[Guelma]], Algeria), in his ''Sancti Augustini Vita''. Possidius admired Augustine as a man of powerful intellect and a stirring orator who took every opportunity to defend Christianity against its detractors. Possidius also described Augustine's personal traits in detail, drawing a portrait of a man who ate sparingly, worked tirelessly, despised gossip, shunned the temptations of the flesh, and exercised prudence in the financial stewardship of his see.&lt;ref&gt;Weiskotten, Herbert T. The Life of Saint Augustine: A Translation of the Sancti Augustini Vita by Possidius, Bishop of Calama. Merchantville, NJ: Evolution Publishing, 2008. ISBN 1-889758-90-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Lombardia Pavia1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|Tomb in [[San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro]] Basilica, Pavia.]]

Shortly before Augustine's death, Roman Africa was invaded by the [[Vandals]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribe that that had converted to [[Arianism]]. The Vandals besieged Hippo in the spring of 430, when Augustine entered his final illness. According to Possidius one of the few miracles attributed to Augustine took place during the siege. While Augustine was confined to his sick bed, a man petitioned him that he might lay his hands upon a relative who was ill. Augustine replied that if he had any power to cure the sick, he would surely have applied it on himself first. The visitor declared that he was told in a dream to go to Augustine so that his relative would be made whole. When Augustine heard this, he no longer hesitated, but laid his hands upon the sick man, who departed from Augustine's presence healed.&lt;ref&gt;Weiskotten, 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Possidius also gives a first-hand account of Augustine's death, which occurred on August 28, 430, while Hippo was still besieged. Augustine spent his final days in prayer and repentance, requesting that the penitential [[Psalms|Psalms of David]] be hung on his walls so that he could read them. He directed that the library of the church in Hippo and all the books therein should be carefully preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Weiskotten, 57&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his death the Vandals lifted the siege of Hippo, but they returned not long thereafter and burned the city. They destroyed all of it but Augustine's cathedral and library, which they left untouched.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

According to [[Bede|Bede's]] ''True Martyrology'', Augustine's body was later removed to [[Cagliari]], [[Sardinia]] by the Catholic bishops expelled from North Africa by [[Huneric]]. Around 720 his remains were moved again by Peter, bishop of [[Pavia]] and uncle of the Lombard king [[Liutprand]], to the church of [[San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro]], in order to save them from frequent coastal raids by [[Moors]] and [[Berbers]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In January 1327 Pope John XXII issued the papal bull ''Veneranda Santorum Patrum'', in which he appointed the [[Augustinians]] guardians of the tomb of Augustine, which was remade in 1362 and elaborately carved with bas-treliefs of scenes from Augustine's life. By that time, however, the actual remains of Augustine could not be authenticated. Stonemasons working in the crypt altar removed paving blocks and discovered a marble box. Within it were other boxes; in the third box were fragments of wood, numerous bones and bone fragments, and glass vials. Some of the workers later claimed to have seen the name &quot;Augustine&quot; written in charcoal on the top of the box. A factor complicating the authentication of the remains was that San Pietro was shared by two Augustinian religious orders in bitter rivalry.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The Augustinians were expelled from Pavia in 1700, taking refuge in [[Milan]] with the relics of Augustine, and the disassembled Arca, which were removed to the cathedral there. San Pietro fell into disrepair and was a military magazine during the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] occupation of the city. It was finally rebuilt in the 1870s, under the urging of [[Agostino Gaetano Riboldi]], and reconsecrated in 1896 when the relics of Augustine and the shrine were once again reinstalled.&lt;ref&gt;Shanon Dale, 2001. &quot;A house divided: San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia and the politics of Pope John XXII&quot;, in JMH 27, p. 55ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold Samuel Stone, ''St. Augustine's Bones: A Microhistory'' (Studies in Print Culture and the History of the Book) (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press) 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine was one of the most prolific Latin authors in terms of surviving works, and the list of his works consists of more than a hundred separate titles.&lt;ref&gt;Passage based on F.A. Wright and T.A. Sinclair, ''A History of Later Latin Literature'' (London 1931), pp. 56 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Please see a near-exhaustive list [[Augustine of Hippo#List of Works (books, letters and sermons)|below]]. They include [[apologetics|apologetic]] works against the heresies of the [[Arianism|Arians]], [[Donatists]], [[Manichaeans]] and [[Pelagians]], texts on Christian [[doctrine]], notably ''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (''On Christian Doctrine''), [[exegesis|exegetical]] works such as commentaries on [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Psalms]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] [[Letter to the Romans]], many [[sermons]] and [[Letter (message)|letters]], and the ''Retractationes'' (''[[Retractions (book)|Retractions]]''), a review of his earlier works which he wrote near the end of his life. Apart from those, Augustine is probably best known for his ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessiones]]'' (''Confessions''), which is a personal account of his earlier life, and for ''De civitate dei'' (''[[The City of God (book)|Of the City of God]]'', consisting of 22 books), which he wrote to restore the confidence of his fellow Christians, which was badly shaken by the sack of [[Rome]] by the [[Visigoths]] in 410. His ''[[De trinitate]]'' (''On the Trinity''), in which he developed what has become known as the 'psychological analogy' of the [[Trinity]], is also among his masterpieces, and arguably one of the greatest theological works of all time. He also wrote ''On Free Choice Of The Will'' (''[[De libero arbitrio]]''), addressing why God gives humans free will that can be used for evil.

==Influence as a theologian and thinker==
Augustine was a bishop, priest, and father who remains a central figure, both within Christianity and in the history of Western thought, and is considered by modern historian [[Thomas Cahill]] to be the first medieval man and the last classical man.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Cahill, ''[[How the Irish Saved Civilization]]'' Ch.2.&lt;/ref&gt; In both his philosophical and theological reasoning, he was greatly influenced by [[Stoicism]], [[Platonism]] and [[Neo-platonism]], particularly by the work of [[Plotinus]], author of the [[Enneads]], probably through the mediation of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Gaius Marius Victorinus|Victorinus]] (as [[Pierre Hadot]] has argued). Although he later abandoned Neoplatonism some ideas are still visible in his early writings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] ''History of western Philosophy'' Book II Chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt; His generally favourable view of Neoplatonic thought contributed to the &quot;baptism&quot; of Greek thought and its entrance into the Christian and subsequently the [[Europe]]an intellectual tradition. His early and influential writing on the [[Will (philosophy)|human will]], a central topic in [[ethics]], would become a focus for later philosophers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. In addition, Augustine was influenced by the works of [[Virgil]] (known for his teaching on language), [[Cicero]] (known for his teaching on argument), and [[Aristotle]] (particularly his [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]] and [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]).

Augustine's concept of original sin was expounded in his works against the [[Pelagians]]. However, St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] took much of Augustine's theology while creating his own unique synthesis of Greek and Christian thought after the widespread rediscovery of the work of Aristotle. Augustine's doctrine of [[efficacious grace]] found eloquent expression in the works of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]; also [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] theologians such as [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] would look back to him as their inspiration.

Augustine was [[canonization|canonized]] by popular acclaim, and later recognized as a Doctor of the Church in 1298 by [[Pope Boniface VIII]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} His [[feast day]] is August 28, the day on which he died. He is considered the patron saint of brewers, printers, theologians, sore eyes, and a number of cities and dioceses.&lt;ref name=&quot;KnoYrSaint&quot;/&gt;

The latter part of Augustine's ''Confessions'' consists of an extended meditation on the nature of time. Even the [[agnostic]] [[philosopher]] [[Bertrand Russell]] was impressed by this. He wrote, &quot;a very admirable relativistic theory of time. ... It contains a better and clearer statement than [[Kant]]'s of the subjective theory of time - a theory which, since Kant, has been widely accepted among philosophers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]], 1946, reprinted Unwin Paperbacks 1979, pp 352-3&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic theologians generally subscribe to Augustine's belief that God exists [[eternity|outside of time]] in the &quot;eternal present&quot;; that time only exists within the created universe because only in space is time discernible through motion and change. His meditations on the nature of time are closely linked to his consideration of the human ability of [[memory]]. [[Frances Yates]] in her 1966 study ''[[The Art of Memory]]'' argues that a brief passage of the ''Confessions'', 10.8.12, in which Augustine writes of walking up a flight of stairs and entering the vast fields of memory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/hippo/text10.html#TB10C8S12 Confessiones Liber X: commentary on 10.8.12] ''(in Latin)''&lt;/ref&gt; clearly indicates that the ancient Romans were aware of how to use explicit spatial and architectural metaphors as a [[mnemonic]] technique for organizing large amounts of information.

Augustine's philosophical method, especially demonstrated in his ''Confessions'', has had continuing influence on Continental philosophy throughout the 20th century. His descriptive approach to intentionality, memory, and language as these phenomena are experienced within consciousness and time anticipated and inspired the insights of modern [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[hermeneutics]]. [[Edmund Husserl]] writes: &quot;The analysis of time-consciousness is an age-old crux of descriptive psychology and theory of knowledge. The first thinker to be deeply sensitive to the immense difficulties to be found here was Augustine, who laboured almost to despair over this problem.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund. ''Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness.'' Tr. James S. Churchill. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1964, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Heidegger]] refers to Augustine's descriptive philosophy at several junctures in his influential work, ''Being and Time''.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Heidegger's articulations of how &quot;Being-in-the-world&quot; is described through thinking about ''seeing'': &quot;The remarkable priority of 'seeing' was noticed particularly by Augustine, in connection with his Interpretation of ''concupiscentia''.&quot; Heidegger then quotes the ''Confessions'': &quot;Seeing belongs properly to the eyes. But we even use this word 'seeing' for the other senses when we devote them to cognizing... We not only say, 'See how that shines', ... 'but we even say, 'See how that sounds'&quot;. ''Being and Time'' Trs. Macquarrie &amp; Robinson. New York: Harpers, 1964. 171&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hannah Arendt]] began her philosophical writing with a dissertation on Augustine's concept of love, ''Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin'' (1929): &quot;The young Arendt attempted to show that the philosophical basis for ''vita socialis'' in Augustine can be understood as residing in neighbourly love, grounded in his understanding of the common origin of humanity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chiba, Shin. Hannah Arendt on Love and the Political: Love, Friendship, and Citizenship.''The Review of Politics'', Vol. 57, No. 3 (Summer, 1995), 507.&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Bethke Elshtain in ''Augustine and the Limits of Politics'' finds likeness between Augustine and Arendt in their concepts of evil: &quot;Augustine did not see evil as glamorously demonic but rather as absence of good, something which paradoxically is really nothing. Arendt ... envisioned even the extreme evil which produced the Holocaust as merely banal [in ''Eichmann in Jerusalem''].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tinder, Glenn. ''The American Political Science Review'', Vol. 91, No. 2 (Jun., 1997), pp. 432-433&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine's philosophical legacy continues to influence contemporary critical theory through the contributions and inheritors of these 20th century figures.

According to [[Leo Ruickbie]], Augustine's arguments against [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], differentiating it from miracle, were crucial in the early Church's fight against paganism and became a central thesis in the later denunciation of witches and witchcraft. According to Professor Deepak Lal, Augustine's vision of the heavenly city has influenced the secular projects and traditions of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Marxism, Freudianism and Eco-fundamentalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deepak Lal&quot;&gt;Lal, D.

=== Influence on St. Thomas Aquinas ===
For quotations of St. Augustine by St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] see [[Aquinas and the Sacraments]] and [[Thought of Thomas Aquinas]].

On the topic of original sin, Aquinas proposed a more optimistic view of man than that of Augustine in that his conception leaves to the reason, will, and passions of fallen man their natural powers even after the Fall.&lt;ref name =&quot;Oxford:Original&quot;&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Original Sin''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Protestant reformers===
While in his pre-Pelagian writings Augustine taught that Adam's guilt as transmitted to his descendants much enfeebles, though does not destroy, the freedom of their will, Protestant reformers Martin Luther and [[John Calvin]] affirmed that Original Sin completely destroyed liberty (see [[total depravity]]).&lt;ref name =&quot;Oxford:Original&quot;&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article: ''Original Sin''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
===Abortion and ensoulment===
Like other Church Fathers, St Augustine &quot;vigorously condemned the practice of induced abortion&quot; as a crime, in any stage of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitzgerald, 1&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing| isbn = 9780802838438| pages = 1| editors = Allan D. Fitzgerald (ed.)| last = Bauerschmidt| first = John C.| title = Abortion| encyclopedia = Augustine Through the Ages: An Encyclopedia| year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his works, Augustine did consider that the gravity of participation in an abortion depended on whether the fetus had yet received a soul. According to his beliefs, this occurred at 40 days for males, and 90 for females.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitzgerald, 1&quot;/&gt;

===Anthropology===
Augustine was one of the first Christian [[Late Latin|ancient Latin]] authors with very clear [[theological anthropology|anthropological]] vision.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#PhiAnt]&quot;Augustine&quot; accessed March 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the human being as a perfect unity of two substances: soul and body. In his late treatise ''[[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series I/Volume III/Moral Treatises of St. Augustin/On Care to Be Had for the Dead/Section 5|On Care to Be Had for the Dead, section 5]]'' ([[420]] AD) he exhorted to respect the body on the grounds that it belonged to the very nature of the human [[person]]:
{{quotation|In no wise are the bodies themselves to be spurned. (...) For these pertain not to ornament or aid which is applied from without, but to the very nature of man.&lt;ref&gt;''De cura pro mortuis gerenda'' [[Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum|CSEL]] 41, 627[13–22]; PL 40, 595: ''Nullo modo ipsa spernenda sunt corpora. (...)Haec enim non ad ornamentum vel adiutorium, quod adhibetur extrinsecus, sed ad ipsam naturam hominis pertinent''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Augustine's favourite figure to describe ''body-soul'' unity is [[marriage]]: ''caro tua, coniunx tua - your body is your wife''.&lt;ref&gt;''Enarrationes in psalmos'', 143, 6; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 40, 2077 [46] – 2078 [74]; ''De utilitate ieiunii'', 4,4-5; CCL 46, 234-235.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the two elements were in perfect harmony. After the [[Augustine of Hippo#Original sin|fall of humanity]] they are now experiencing dramatic combat between one another.

They are two categorically different things. The body is a three-dimensional object composed of the four elements, whereas the soul has no spatial dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;''De quantitate animae'' 1.2; 5.9&lt;/ref&gt; Soul is a kind of substance, participating in reason, fit for ruling the body.&lt;ref&gt;''De quantitate animae'' 13.12: ''Substantia quaedam rationis particeps, regendo corpori accomodata''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Augustine was not preoccupied, as [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]] were, with going too much into details in efforts to explain the [[metaphysics]] of the soul-body union. It suffices for him to admit that they are metaphysically distinct; to be a human is to be a composite of soul and body, and that the soul is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason.&lt;ref&gt;''On the free will'' (''De libero arbitrio'') 2.3.7-6.13; cf. W.E. Mann, ''Inner-Life Ethics'', in: {{cite book

===Astrology===
Augustine's contemporaries often believed astrology to be an exact and genuine science. Its practitioners were regarded as true men of learning and called ''mathemathici''. Astrology played a prominent part in Manichean doctrine, and Augustine himself was attracted by their books in his youth, being particularly fascinated by those who claimed to foretell the future. Later as a bishop he used to warn that one should avoid 'mathematicians' who combine science and horoscopes. According to Augustine, they were not genuine students of [[Hipparchus]] or [[Eratosthenes]] but &quot;common swindlers&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book |title= Augustine the Bishop.

===Baptism===
Against the [[Pelagians]] Augustine strongly stressed the importance of [[infant baptism]]. About the question if baptism is an absolute necessity for salvation however, Augustine appears to have refined his beliefs during his lifetime, causing some confusion among later theologians about his position. He said in one of his sermons:

{{quotation|&quot;God does not remit sins but to the baptized&quot;.|A Sermon to Catechumens on the Creed, Paragraph 16}}

This belief was shared by many early Christians.

However, a passage from his ''City of God'', concerning the Apocalypse, may indicate that Augustine did believe in an exception for children born to Christian parents:

{{quotation|&quot;But what shall become of the little ones? For it is beyond all belief that in these days [the Apocalypse] there shall not be found some Christian children born, but not yet baptized, and that there shall not also be some born during that very period; and if there be such, we cannot believe that their parents shall not find some way of bringing them to the laver of regeneration.&quot;|City of God, Book 20, Chapter 8}}

===Creation===
{{See also|Allegorical interpretations of Genesis}}

In &quot;''The Literal Interpretation of Genesis''&quot; Augustine took the view that everything in the universe was created simultaneously by God, and not in seven calendar days like a plain account of Genesis would require. He argued that the six-day structure of creation presented in the book of Genesis represents a [[framework interpretation (Genesis)|logical framework]], rather than the passage of time in a physical way - it would bear a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, which is no less literal. One reason for this interpretation is the passage in [[Sirach]] 18:1, ''creavit omni simul'' (&quot;he created all things at once&quot;), which Augustine took as proof that the days of Genesis 1 had to be taken non-literally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing| isbn = 9780802838438| pages = 377–378| editors = Allan D. Fitzgerald (ed.)| last = Teske| first = Roland J.| title = Genesi ad litteram liber imperfectus, De| encyclopedia = Augustine Through the Ages: An Encyclopedia| year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, Augustine did not hold to an age of the earth of millions or more years, as the quotation below from ''The City of God'' indicates. Augustine also does not envision original sin as originating structural changes in the universe, and even suggests that the bodies of Adam and Eve were already created mortal before the Fall. Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that the interpretation of the creation story is difficult, and remarks that we should be willing to change our mind about it as new information comes up.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1988/PSCF3-88Young.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;''City of God''&quot;, Augustine rejected both the immortality of the human race proposed by pagans, and contemporary ideas of ages (such as those of certain Greeks and Egyptians) that differed from the Church's sacred writings:

{{quotation|Let us, then, omit the conjectures of men who know not what they say, when they speak of the nature and origin of the human race. For some hold the same opinion regarding men that they hold regarding the world itself, that they have always been... They are deceived, too, by those highly mendacious documents which profess to give the history of many thousand years, though, reckoning by the sacred writings, we find that not 6000 years have yet passed.|Augustine, [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-02/npnf1-02-18.htm#P2017_1154484 Of the Falseness of the History Which Allots Many Thousand Years to the World's Past], ''The City of God'', Book 12: Chapt. 10 [419].}}

===Ecclesiology===
{{See also|Ecclesiology}}
Augustine developed his doctrine of The Church principally in reaction to the [[Donatist]] sect. He taught a distinction between the &quot;church visible&quot; and &quot;[[invisible church|church invisible]]&quot;. The former is the institutional body on earth which proclaims salvation and administers the [[sacraments]] while the latter is the invisible body of the elect, made up of genuine believers from all ages, and who are known only to God. The visible church will be made up of &quot;wheat&quot; and &quot;tares&quot;, that is, good and wicked people (as per Mat. 13:30), until the end of time. This concept countered the Donatist claim that they were the only &quot;true&quot; or &quot;pure&quot; church on earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez&quot;&gt;{{cite book
| author=Justo L. Gonzalez
| title=A History of Christian Thought: Volume 2 (From Augustine to the eve of the Reformation)
| publisher=Abingdon Press
| date=1970-1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine's ecclesiology was more fully developed in ''City of God''. There he conceives of the church as a heavenly city or kingdom, ruled by love, which will ultimately triumph over all earthly empires which are self-indulgent and ruled by pride. Augustine followed [[Cyprian]] in teaching that the bishops of the church are the [[apostolic succession|successors of the apostles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez&quot;/&gt;

===Eschatology===
Augustine originally believed that Christ would establish a literal 1,000-year kingdom prior to the general [[resurrection]] ([[premillennialism]] or chiliasm) but rejected the system as carnal. He was the first theologian to systematically expound a doctrine of [[amillennialism]], although some theologians and Christian historians believe his position was closer to that of modern [[postmillennialism|postmillennialists]]. The mediaeval Catholic church built its system of eschatology on Augustinian amillennialism, where the Christ rules the earth spiritually through his triumphant church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Craig L. Blomberg|title=From Pentecost to Patmos|publisher=Apollos|year=2006|pages=519}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Reformation, theologians such as [[John Calvin]] accepted amillennialism while rejecting aspects of mediaeval ecclesiology which had been built on Augustine's teaching.

Augustine taught that the eternal fate of the soul is determined at death,&lt;ref name =&quot;Oxford:unspecified&quot;&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, unspecified article&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enchiridion 110&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[purgatory|purgatorial]] fires of the [[intermediate state]] purify only those that died in communion with the Church. His teaching provided fuel for later theology.&lt;ref name =&quot;Oxford:unspecified&quot;/&gt;

===Epistemological views===

Augustine's intellectual development was shaped by epistemological concerns. His early dialogues ([[Contra academicos]] (386) and [[De Magistro]] (389), both written shortly after his conversion to Christianity, reflect his engagement with skeptical arguments and show the development of his doctrine of [[Illuminationist philosophy|inner illumination]]. Augustine also posed the [[problem of other minds]] throughout different works, most famously perhaps in [[On the Trinity]] (VIII.6.9), and develops what has come to be a standard solution: the argument from analogy to other minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gareth B. Matthews|title=Thought's ego in Augustine and Descartes|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Plato and other earlier philosophers, Augustine recognizes the centrality of [[Philosophical problems of testimony|testimony]] to human knowledge and argues that what others tell us can provide knowledge even if we don't have independent reasons to believe their testimonial reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=Peter|coauthors=Nathan Ballantyne|title=Augustine on Testimony|journal=Canadian Journal of Philosophy|year=2009|volume=39|issue=2|doi=10.1353/cjp.0.0045|url=http://www.canadianjournalofphilosophy.com/PDFs/cjp39-2--195-214--Ballantyne-King.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intercession of the Saints===
In his book ''Confessions'', Augustine wrote of a peculiar practice of his Christian mother, Monica, in which she &quot;brought to certain oratories, erected in the memory of the saints, offerings of porridge, bread, and wine.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Confessions 6.2.2&lt;/ref&gt; When she moved to Milan, the bishop Ambrose forbade her to use the offering of wine, since &quot;it might be an occasion of gluttony for those who were already given to drink&quot;. So, Augustine wrote of her: {{quotation|In place of a basket filled with fruits of the earth, she had learned to bring to the oratories of the martyrs a heart full of purer petitions, and to give all that she could to the poor - so that the communion of the Lord's body might be rightly celebrated in those places where, after the example of his passion, the martyrs had been sacrificed and crowned.|Confessions 6.2.2}}

===Just war===
{{See also|Just War}}
Augustine agreed strongly with the conventional wisdom of the time, that Christians should be pacifists in their personal lives. But he routinely argued that this did not apply to the defense of innocents. In essence, the pursuit of peace must include the option of fighting to preserve it in the long-term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html St. Augustine of Hippo], Crusades-Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; Such a war could not be preemptive, but defensive, to restore peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jknirp.com/mattox.htm Saint Augustine and the Theory of Just War]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Aquinas, centuries later, used the authority of Augustine's arguments in an attempt to define the conditions under which a war could be just:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/politics/pg0029.html The Just War]&lt;/ref&gt;
* First, war must occur for a good and just purpose rather than for self-gain or as an exercise of power.
* Second, just war must be waged by a properly instituted authority such as the state.
* Third, peace must be a central motive even in the midst of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Christianity|author=Justo L. Gonzalez|year=1984|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mariology===
Although Augustine did not develop an independent Mariology, his statements on Mary surpass in number and depth those of other early writers.&lt;ref&gt;O Stegmüller, in Marienkunde, 455&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], he defended the ever Virgin Mary as the Mother of God, who, because of her virginity, is full of grace.&lt;ref&gt;De Sacra Virginitate, 6,6, 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, he affirmed that the Virgin Mary ''“conceived as virgin, gave birth as virgin and stayed virgin forever”''.&lt;ref&gt;De Saca virginitate 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural knowledge and biblical interpretation===
Augustine took the view that the Biblical text should not be interpreted as properly literal, but rather as metaphorical, if it contradicts what we know from science and our God-given reason. While each passage of Scripture has a literal sense, this &quot;literal sense&quot; does not always mean that the Scriptures are mere history; at times they are rather an extended metaphor. In ''The Literal Interpretation of Genesis'', St. Augustine wrote:

{{quotation|It not infrequently happens that something about the earth, about the sky, about other elements of this world, about the motion and rotation or even the magnitude and distances of the stars, about definite eclipses of the sun and moon, about the passage of years and seasons, about the nature of animals, of fruits, of stones, and of other such things, may be known with the greatest certainty by reasoning or by experience, even by one who is not a Christian. It is too disgraceful and ruinous, though, and greatly to be avoided, that he [the non-Christian] should hear a Christian speaking so idiotically on these matters, and as if in accord with Christian writings, that he might say that he could scarcely keep from laughing when he saw how totally in error they are. In view of this and in keeping it in mind constantly while dealing with the book of Genesis, I have, insofar as I was able, explained in detail and set forth for consideration the meanings of obscure passages, taking care not to affirm rashly some one meaning to the prejudice of another and perhaps better explanation.|''De Genesi ad literam 1:19–20'', Chapt. 19 [408]}}

{{quotation|With the scriptures it is a matter of treating about the faith. For that reason, as I have noted repeatedly, if anyone, not understanding the mode of divine eloquence, should find something about these matters [about the physical universe] in our books, or hear of the same from those books, of such a kind that it seems to be at variance with the perceptions of his own rational faculties, let him believe that these other things are in no way necessary to the admonitions or accounts or predictions of the scriptures. In short, it must be said that our authors knew the truth about the nature of the skies, but it was not the intention of the Spirit of God, who spoke through them, to teach men anything that would not be of use to them for their salvation.|''De Genesi ad literam'', 2:9}}

A more clear distinction between &quot;metaphorical&quot; and &quot;literal&quot; in literary texts arose with the rise of the [[Scientific Revolution]], although its source could be found in earlier writings, such as those of [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC). It was even considered heretical to interpret the Bible literally at times.&lt;ref&gt;Origen, St. Jerome: &quot;On First Principles&quot;, Book III, Chapter III, Verse 1. Translated by K. Froehlich.

===Original sin===
{{Main|Original sin}}

Augustine taught that Original sin of Adam and Eve was either an act of ''foolishness'' (''insipientia'') followed by ''pride'' and ''disobedience'' to God or the opposite: pride came first.&lt;ref&gt;He explained to Julian of Eclanum that it was a most subtle job to discern what came first: ''Sed si disputatione subtilissima et elimatissima opus est, ut sciamus utrum primos homines insipientia superbos, an insipientes superbia fecerit''. (''Contra Julianum'', V, 4.18; PL 44, 795)&lt;/ref&gt; The first couple disobeyed God, who had told them not to eat of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] (Gen 2:17).&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''The Literal Meaning of Genesis'' (''De Genesi ad litteram''), VIII, 6:12, vol. 1, p. 192-3 and 12:28, vol. 2, p. 219-20, trans. John Hammond Taylor SJ;[[Bibliothèque Augustinniene|BA]] 49,28 and 50-52; [[Patrologia Latina|PL]] 34, 377; cf. idem, ''De Trinitate'', XII, 12.17; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 50, 371-372 [v. 26-31;1-36];  ''De natura boni'' 34-35; CSEL 25, 872; PL 42, 551-572&lt;/ref&gt; The tree was a symbol of the order of creation.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Augustine, ''On the Literal Meaning of Genesis'' (''De Genesi ad litteram''), VIII, 4.8; [[Bibliothèque Augustinniene|BA]] 49, 20&lt;/ref&gt; Self-centeredness made Adam and Eve eat of it, thus failing to acknowledge and respect the world as it was created by God, with its hierarchy of beings and values.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine explained it in this way: ''Why therefore is it enjoined upon mind, that it should know itself? I suppose, in order that, it may consider itself, and live according to its own nature; that is, seek to be regulated according to its own nature, viz., under Him to whom it ought to be subject, and above those things to which it is to be preferred; under Him by whom it ought to be ruled, above those things which it ought to rule. For it does many things through vicious desire, as though in forgetfulness of itself. For it sees some things intrinsically excellent, in that more excellent nature which is God: and whereas it ought to remain steadfast that it may enjoy them, it is turned away from Him, by wishing to appropriate those things to itself, and not to be like to Him by His gift, but to be what He is by its own, and it begins to move and slip gradually down into less and less, which it thinks to be more and more. (&quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/130105.htm On the Trinity]&quot; (''De Trinitate''), 5:7; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 50, 320 [1-12])&lt;/ref&gt; They would not have fallen into pride and lack of wisdom, if Satan hadn't sown into their senses ''&quot;the root of evil&quot;'' (''radix Mali'').&lt;ref&gt;''Nisi radicem mali humanus tunc reciperet sensus''  (&quot;Contra Julianum&quot;, I, 9.42; PL 44, 670)&lt;/ref&gt; Their nature was wounded by ''concupiscence'' or ''libido'', which affected human intelligence and will, as well as affections and desires, including sexual desire.&lt;ref&gt;In one of Augustine's late works, ''Retractationes'', he made a significant remark indicating the way he understood difference between spiritual, moral libido and the sexual desire: &quot;Libido is not good and righteous use of the libido&quot; (&quot;libido non est bonus et rectus usus libidinis&quot;). See the whole passage: ''Dixi etiam quodam loco: «Quod enim est cibus ad salutem hominis, hoc est concubitus ad salutem generis, et utrumque non est sine delectatione carnali, quae tamen modificata et temperantia refrenante in usum naturalem redacta, libido esse non potest». Quod ideo dictum est, quoniam &quot;libido non est bonus et rectus usus libidinis&quot;. Sicut enim malum est male uti bonis, ita bonum bene uti malis. De qua re alias, maxime contra novos haereticos Pelagianos, diligentius disputavi''. Cf. ''De bono coniugali'', 16.18; PL 40, 385; ''De nuptiis et concupiscentia'', II, 21.36; PL 44, 443; ''Contra Iulianum'', III, 7.16; PL 44, 710; ibid., V, 16.60; PL 44, 817. See also {{cite book |title= Le mariage chrétien dans l'oeuvre de Saint Augustin. Une théologie baptismale de la vie conjugale |author= Idem |year= 1983 |publisher= Études Augustiniennes| location=Paris |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[Metaphysics]], ''concupiscence'' is not a being but bad quality, the privation of good or a wound.&lt;ref&gt;''Non substantialiter manere concupiscentiam, sicut corpus aliquod aut spiritum; sed esse affectionem quamdam malae qualitatis, sicut est languor''. (''De nuptiis et concupiscentia'', I, 25. 28; PL 44, 430; cf. ''Contra Julianum'', VI, 18.53; PL 44, 854; ibid. VI, 19.58; PL 44, 857; ibid., II, 10.33; PL 44, 697; ''Contra Secundinum Manichaeum'', 15; PL 42, 590.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine's understanding of the consequences of the original sin and of necessity of the redeeming grace was developed in the struggle against [[Pelagius]] and his [[Pelagianism|pelagian]] disciples, [[Caelestius]] and [[Julian of Eclanum]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez&quot;/&gt; who had been inspired by Rufinus of Syria, a disciple of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Marius Mercator]] ''Lib. subnot.in verb. Iul. Praef.'', 2,3; PL 48,111 /v.5-13/; {{cite book |last = Bonner |first = Gerald | title = Rufinus of Syria and African Pelagianism | pages= 35(X)  }} in: {{cite book | author =  Idem | title = God's Decree and Man's Destiny | location = London | year = 1987 | pages=  31–47 (X) | isbn=0-86078-203-4 | publisher =  Variorum Reprints}}&lt;/ref&gt; They refused to agree that ''libido'' wounded human will and mind, insisting that the human nature was given the power to act, to speak, and to think when God created it. Human nature cannot lose its moral capacity for doing good, but a person is free to act or not to act in a righteous way. Pelagius gave an example of eyes: they have capacity for seeing, but a person can make either good or bad use of it.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.augustinus.it/latino/grazia_cristo/grazia_cristo_1_libro.htm De gratia Christi et de peccato originali]'', I, 15.16; CSEL 42, 138 [v.24-29]; Ibid., I,4.5; CSEL 42, 128 [v.15-23].

Immorality, e.g. fornication, is exclusively a matter of will, i.e. a person does not use natural desires in a proper way.
In opposition to that, Augustine pointed out to the apparent disobedience of the flesh to the spirit, and explained it as one of the results of original sin, punishment of Adam and Eve's disobedience to God:
{{quotation|For it was not fit that His creature should blush at the work of his Creator; but by a just punishment the disobedience of the members was the retribution to the disobedience of the first man, for which disobedience they blushed when they covered with fig-leaves those shameful parts which previously were not shameful.&lt;br /&gt;
 (...) As, therefore, they were so suddenly ashamed of their nakedness, which they were daily in the habit of looking upon and were not confused, that they could now no longer bear those members naked, but immediately took care to cover them; did not they&amp;mdash;he in the open, she in the hidden impulse&amp;mdash;perceive those members to be disobedient to the choice of their will, which certainly they ought to have ruled like the rest by their voluntary command? And this they deservedly suffered, because they themselves also were not obedient to their Lord. Therefore they blushed that they in such wise had not manifested service to their Creator, that they should deserve to lose dominion over those members by which children were to be procreated.|''Against Two Letters of the Pelagians'' 1.31-32}}

Augustine had served as a &quot;Hearer&quot; for the Manicheans for about nine years,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Peter. Augustine of Hippo. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]], 1967. ISBN 0-520-00186-9, 35&lt;/ref&gt; who taught that the original sin was carnal knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Manichaean Version of Genesis 2-4, the. Translated from the Arabic text of Ibn al-Nadīm, Fihrist, as reproduced by G. Flügel, Mani: Seine Lehre und seine Schriften  (Leipzig, 1862; reprinted, Osnabrück: Biblio Verlag, 1969) 58.11-61.13. 10 December 2006 (http://www.religiousstudies.uncc.edu/jcreeves/manichaean_version_of_genesis_2-4.htm).&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed Augustine, after his conversion, to find narrow path between the Manichean and Pelagian positions.

The view that not only human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] but also senses were influenced by the fall of Adam and Eve was prevalent in Augustine's time among the [[Fathers of the Church]].&lt;ref&gt;See. {{cite book |title=Enkrateia e Antropologia.

In the matter which concerns us here, the agreement with Neoplatonism (and with the Platonic tradition in general) centers on two related notions: immutability as primary characteristic of divinity, and likeness to divinity as the primary vocation of the soul.

Plotinus. New York, NY: Routledge, 1994. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine taught the redemption, i.e. transformation and purification, of the body in the resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''&quot;Enarrations on the Psalms&quot;'' (''Enarrationes in psalmos''),143:6; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 40, 2077 [46] – 2078 [74]; ''The Literal Meaning of Genesis'' (''De Genesi ad Litteram''), 9:6:11, trans. John Hammond Taylor SJ, vol. 2, p. 76-77; PL 34, 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors perceive Augustine's doctrine as directed against human [[sex]]uality and attribute his insistence on continence and devotion to God as coming from Augustine's need to reject his own highly sensual nature as described in the Confessions. But in view of his writings it is apparently a misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Bonner's comment explains a little bit why there are so many authors who write false things about Augustine's views: ''It is, of course, always easier to oppose and denounce than to understand''. See {{cite book |title=St. Augustine of Hippo. Life and Controversies |last=Bonner |first=G. |publisher=The Canterbury Press | location=Norwich |year=1986 |page=312 |isbn=0-86078-203-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine teaches that human sexuality has been wounded, together with the whole of human nature, and requires [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]] of Christ. That healing is a process realised in conjugal acts. The virtue of continence is achieved thanks to the grace of the sacrament of Christian marriage, which becomes therefore a ''remedium concupiscentiae'' - remedy of concupiscence.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''De continentia'', 12.27; PL 40, 368; Ibid., 13.28; PL 40, 369; ''Contra Julianum'', III, 15.29, PL 44, 717; Ibid., III, 21.42, PL 44, 724.&lt;/ref&gt; The redemption of human sexuality will be, however, fully accomplished only in the resurrection of the body.&lt;ref&gt;See. ''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1501.htm Merits and Remission of Sin, and Infant Baptism]'' (''De peccatorum meritis et remissione et de baptismo parvulorum''), I, 6.6; PL 44,112-113; cf. &quot;On the Litteral meaning of the Genesis'' (De Genesi ad litteram'') 9:6:11, trans. John Hammond Taylor SJ, vol. 2, p. 76-77; PL 34, 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sin of Adam is inherited by all human beings. Already in his pre-Pelagian writings, Augustine taught that Original Sin was transmitted by [[concupiscence]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} which he regarded as the passion of both, soul and body,&lt;ref&gt;In 393/394 he comments: ''Moreover, if unbelief is fornication, and idolatry unbelief, and covetousness idolatry, it is not to be doubted that covetousness also is fornication. Who, then, in that case can rightly separate any unlawful lust whatever from the category of fornication, if covetousness is fornication? And from this we perceive, that because of unlawful lusts, not only those of which one is guilty in acts of uncleanness with another's husband or wife, but any unlawful lusts whatever, which cause the soul making a bad use of the body to wander from the law of God, and to be ruinously and basely corrupted, a man may, without crime, put away his wife, and a wife her husband, because the Lord makes the cause of fornication an exception; which fornication, in accordance with the above considerations, we are compelled to understand as being general and universal'' (&quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/16011.htm On the Sermon on the Mount]&quot;, ''De sermone Domini in monte'', 1:16:46; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 35, 52)&lt;/ref&gt; making humanity a ''massa damnata'' (mass of perdition, condemned crowd) and much enfeebling, though not destroying, the freedom of the will.

Augustine's formulation of the doctrine of original sin was confirmed at numerous councils, i.e. [[Councils of Carthage|Carthage]] ([[418]]), [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]] ([[431]]),
[[Councils of Orange|Orange]] ([[529]]), [[Council of Trent|Trent]] (1546) and by popes, i.e. [[Pope Innocent I]] ([[401]]-[[417]]) and [[Pope Zosimus]] ([[417]]-[[418]]). [[Anselm of Canterbury]] established in his ''Cur Deus Homo'' the definition that was followed by the great Schoolmen, namely that Original Sin is the &quot;privation of the righteousness which every man ought to possess&quot;, thus interpreting ''concupiscence'' as something more than mere sexual lust, with which some Augustine's disciples had defined it&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book |title=The Making of the Middle Ages |last= Southern|first= R.W.|year=1953 | location= London|pages=234–7}}; {{cite book |title=St. Augustine of Hippo. Life and Controversies |last=Bonner |first=G. |publisher=The Canterbury Press | location=Norwich |year=1986 |page=371 |isbn=0-86078-203-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; as later did Luther and Calvin, a doctrine condemned in 1567 by [[Pope Pius V]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford:Original&quot;/&gt;

[[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] and [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] disaccordingly claim that, according to Augustine, human beings are utterly depraved in nature. According to them, humans are spoiled by the original sin to the extent that the very presence of concupiscence, ''fomes peccati'' (''incendiary of sin''), is already a personal sin.&lt;ref&gt;Statement condemned by [[Council of Trent]], ''Decree on Justification'', XI and can. 25 (January 13, 1547)&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine's doctrine about the  ''liberum arbitrium'' or free will and its inability to respond to the will of God without divine grace is interpreted (mistakenely according to Roman Catholics) in terms of [[Predestination]]: grace is [[irresistible grace|irresistible]], results in conversion, and leads to [[perseverance of the saints|perseverance]]. The [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] view of Augustine's teachings rests on the assertion that God has foreordained, from eternity, those who will be saved. The number of the elect is fixed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez&quot;/&gt; God has chosen the elect certainly and gratuitously, without any previous merit (''ante merita'') on their part.

The [[Catholic Church]] considers Augustine's teaching to be consistent with free will.&lt;ref name = &quot;multiple&quot;/&gt; He often said that any can be saved if they wish.&lt;ref name = &quot;multiple&quot;/&gt; While God knows who will be saved and who will not, with no possibility that one destined to be lost will be saved, this knowledge represents God's perfect knowledge of how humans will freely choose their destinies.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot;&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02091a.htm#II''Catholic Encyclopedia (1914)] Teaching of St. Augustine of Hippo&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacramental theology===
Also in reaction against the Donatists, Augustine developed a distinction between the &quot;regularity&quot; and &quot;validity&quot; of the [[sacraments]]. Regular sacraments are performed by clergy of the Catholic Church while sacraments performed by schismatics are considered irregular. Nevertheless, the validity of the sacraments do not depend upon the holiness of the priests who perform them (''[[ex opere operato]]''); therefore, irregular sacraments are still accepted as valid provided they are done in the name of Christ and in the manner prescribed by the Church. On this point Augustine departs from the earlier teaching of Cyprian, who taught that converts from schismatic movements must be re-baptised.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez&quot;/&gt;

====Eucharist====
Convinced of the [[Real presence]] of Christ in the Eucharist, Augustine made the following logical observation regarding this sacrament: &quot;Christ was carried in his own hands when, referring to his own body, he said, ‘This is my body’ [Matt. 26:26]. For he carried that body in his hands.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Explanations of the Psalms 33:1:10 [A.D. 405]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sermon addressed to new Christians, Augustine explicitly described the bread and wine as the body and blood of Christ.
:I promised you [new Christians], who have now been baptized, a sermon in which I would explain the sacrament of the Lord’s Table. . . . That bread which you see on the altar, having been sanctified by the word of God, is the body of Christ. That chalice, or rather, what is in that chalice, having been sanctified by the word of God, is the blood of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Sermons 227 [A.D. 411]&lt;/ref&gt;

:What you see is the bread and the chalice; that is what your own eyes report to you. But what your faith obliges you to accept is that the bread is the body of Christ and the chalice is the blood of Christ. This has been said very briefly, which may perhaps be sufficient for faith; yet faith does not desire instruction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sermons 272&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soteriology===
Augustine made several statements concerning his views on the limitations of the atonement, such as:
{{quotation|The garden of the Lord's brothers and sisters, includes, yes it includes, it certainly includes not only the roses of martyrs but also the lilies of virgins, and the ivy of married people and the violets of widows. There is absolutely no kind of human beings, dearly beloved, who need to despair of their vocation; '''Christ suffered for all.''' It was truly written, it is he &quot;who wishes all men to be saved and to come to the acknowledgment of the truth.&quot;|Sermon 304.2}}

===Statements on Jews===
Against certain Christian movements, some of which rejected the use of Hebrew Scripture, Augustine countered that God had chosen the Jews as a special people,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diarmaid MacCulloch]]. ''[[The Reformation: A History]]'' (Penguin Group, 2005) p 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and he considered the scattering of Jews by the Roman Empire to be a fulfillment of prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;''City of God'', book 18, chapter 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine also quotes part of the same prophecy that says &quot;Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law&quot; (Psalm 59:11). Augustine argued that God had allowed the Jews to survive this dispersion as a warning to Christians, thus they were to be permitted to dwell in Christian lands. Augustine further argued that the Jews would be converted at the end of time.&lt;ref&gt;J. Edwards, ''The Spanish Inquisition'' (Stroud, 1999), pp33-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on lust===
Augustine struggled with lust throughout his life. He had a mistress before he converted, but once he became a Christian, he condemned all forms of extra-marital sex (including his previous relationship with his mistress), considering them unlawful and unbiblical.
In the ''Confessions'', Augustine describes his personal struggle in vivid terms: &quot;But I, wretched, most wretched, in the very commencement of my early youth, had begged chastity of Thee, and said, 'Grant me chastity and continence, only not yet.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/augustine/Pusey/book08 ''Conf.'' 8.7.17]&lt;/ref&gt; At sixteen Augustine moved to Carthage where again he was plagued by this &quot;wretched sin&quot;:

{{quotation|There seethed all around me a cauldron of lawless loves. I loved not yet, yet I loved to love, and out of a deep-seated want, I hated myself for wanting not. I sought what I might love, in love with loving, and I hated safety... To love then, and to be beloved, was sweet to me; but more, when I obtained to enjoy the person I loved. I defiled, therefore, the spring of friendship with the filth of concupiscence, and I beclouded its brightness with the hell of lustfulness.|''Confessions'' 3.1.1}}

For Augustine, the evil was not in the sexual act itself, but rather in the emotions that typically accompany it. In ''On Christian Doctrine'' Augustine contrasts love and lust:

{{quotation| By love I mean the impulse of one's mind to enjoy God on his own account and to enjoy oneself and one's neighbour on account of God, and by lust I mean the impulse of one's mind to enjoy oneself and one's neighbour and any corporeal thing not on account of God.| ''3.37''}}

Here we can see the theoretical resolution of the struggle documented in ''Confessions'': that proper love exercises a denial of selfish pleasure and the subjugation of corporeal desire to God.

To the pious virgins raped during the sack of Rome, he writes, &quot;Truth, another's lust cannot pollute thee.&quot; Chastity is &quot;a virtue of the mind, and is not lost by rape, but is lost by the intention of sin, even if unperformed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot;&gt;''A history of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russell'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine viewed [[erection]]s themselves as involuntary: ''at times, without intention, the body stirs on its own, insistent; at other times, it leaves a straining lover in the lurch.''&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', 14.17&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, Augustine's life experience led him to consider lust to be one of the most grievous sins, and a serious obstacle to the virtuous life.

==Teaching philosophy==
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2011}}
Augustine is considered an influential figure in the history of education. He introduced the theory of three different categories of students, and instructed teachers to adapt their teaching styles to each student's individual learning style. The three different kinds of students are: the student who has been well-educated by knowledgeable teachers; the student who has had no education; and the student who has had a poor education, but believes himself to be well-educated. If a student has been well educated in a wide variety of subjects, the teacher must be careful not to repeat what they have already learned, but to challenge the student with material which they do not yet know thoroughly. With the student who has had no education, the teacher must be patient, willing to repeat things until the student understands, and sympathetic. Perhaps the most difficult student, however, is the one with an inferior education who believes he understands something when he does not. Augustine stressed the importance of showing this type of student the difference between &quot;having words and having understanding,&quot; and of helping the student to remain humble with his acquisition of knowledge.

Another radical idea which Augustine introduced is the idea of teachers responding positively to the questions they may receive from their students, no matter if the student interrupted his teacher. Augustine also founded the ''restrained'' style of teaching. This teaching style ensures the students' full understanding of a concept because the teacher does not bombard the student with too much material; focuses on one topic at a time; helps them discover what they don't understand, rather than moving on too quickly; anticipates questions; and helps them learn to solve difficulties and find solutions to problems. Yet another of Augustine's major contributions to education is his study on the styles of teaching. He claimed there are two basic styles a teacher uses when speaking to the students. The ''mixed style'' includes complex and sometimes showy language to help students see the beautiful artistry of the subject they are studying. The ''grand style'' is not quite as elegant as the mixed style, but is exciting and heartfelt, with the purpose of igniting the same passion in the students' hearts.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Education&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine balanced his teaching philosophy with the traditional [[Bible]]-based practice of strict discipline. For example, he agreed with using punishment as an incentive for children to learn. He believed all people tend toward evil, and students must therefore be physically punished when they allow their evil desires to direct their actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/agexed/aee501/augustine.html North Carolina State University]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
English translations of Augustine's work abound. One of the best translations of Augustine into English currently available is the one offered by [[New City Press]] in the series ''The Works of St. Augustine: A translation for the 21st Century''.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Boulding's translations of the ''Confessions'' and the ''Expositions of the Psalms'', in particular, have garnered great praise. See for instance ''Catholic Library World'' in reference to the ''Confessions'': &quot;A whole new generation should fall in love with one of Christendoms greatest works thanks to Maria Boulding.&quot; See also the acknowledgment expressed in her [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/maria-boulding-nun-and-theologian-who-translated-works-by-st-augustine-1837159.html obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; To date, this is also the most complete translation of Augustine's works in English.&lt;ref&gt;See a list of available works [http://www.newcitypress.com/the-works-of-saint-augustine-1.html here].&lt;/ref&gt;  The second most complete translation of Augustine's works in English is by the [[Catholic University of America Press]].&lt;ref&gt;See a list of available works [http://cuapress.cua.edu/BOOKS/catalog/author/index.cfm?letter=A here].&lt;/ref&gt; The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy offers a [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#Enga list of selected translations], which however does not claim to be exhaustive.

==In popular culture==
Augustine was played by [[Dary Berkani]] in the 1972 television movie ''[[Augustine of Hippo (film)|Augustine of Hippo]]''.  He was also played by [[Franco Nero]] in the 2010 mini-series ''[[Augustine: The Decline of the Roman Empire]]''. The modern day name links to the Agostinelli Family.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.4crests.com/agostinelli-coat-of-arms.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acting''' is the work of an '''[[actor]]''' or '''actress''', which is a person in [[theatre]], [[television]], [[film]], or any other [[storytelling]] medium who tells the story by portraying a [[Character (arts)|character]] and, usually, [[Speech communication|speaking]] or [[singing]] the written text or [[Play (theatre)|play]]. Most early sources in the [[Western culture|West]] that examine the [[art]] of acting ({{lang-el|ὑπόκρισις}}, ''hypokrisis'') discuss it as part of [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;Csapo and Slater (1994, 257); ''hypokrisis'', which literally means &quot;acting,&quot; was the word used in discussions of [[rhetoric]]al delivery.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and history==
One of the first actors is believed to be an ancient Greek called [[Thespis]] of Icaria. An [[apocryphal]] story says that Thespis stepped out of the [[dithyramb]]ic [[Greek chorus|chorus]] and spoke to them as a separate [[Character (arts)|character]]. Before Thespis, the chorus narrated (for example, &quot;Dionysus did this, Dionysus said that&quot;). When Thespis stepped out from the chorus, he spoke as if he was the character (for example, &quot;I am Dionysus. I did this&quot;). From Thespis' name derives the word ''[[thespian]]''.

Acting requires a wide range of skills, including [[vocal]] projection, clarity of [[Speech communication|speech]], physical expressivity, emotional facility, a well-developed [[imagination]], and the ability to interpret [[drama]]. Acting also often demands an ability to employ [[dialect]]s, [[Accent (language)|accents]] and body language, [[improvisational theatre|improvisation]], observation and emulation, [[Mime artist|mime]], and [[stage combat]]. Many actors train at length in special programs or colleges to develop these skills, and today the vast majority of professional actors have undergone extensive training. Even though one actor may have years of training, they always strive for more lessons; the cinematic and theatrical world is always changing and because of this, the actor must stay as up to date as possible. Actors and actresses will often have many instructors and teachers for a full range of training involving, but not limited to, singing, scene-work, monologue techniques, audition techniques and partner work.

==Professional actors==
{{See|Actor|Drama school}}
Not all people working as actors in [[film]], [[television]] or [[theatre]] are [[professional]]ly trained. Conservatories typically offer two- to four-year training on all aspects of acting. Universities will offer three- to four-year programs, where a student is often able to choose to focus on drama, while still learning about other aspects of theatre. Schools will vary in their approach, but in North America the most popular method taught derives from the &quot;system&quot; of [[Constantin Stanislavski]], which was developed and popularised in America by [[Lee Strasberg]], [[Stella Adler]], and others. The ambiguously termed [[method acting]] came about through iterations of Stanislavski's system by Strasberg.  Other approaches may include a more physical approach, following the teachings of Jerzy Grotowski and others, or may be based on the training developed by other [[theatre practitioner]]s including [[Sanford Meisner]]. Other classes may include mask work, improvisation, and acting for the camera. Regardless of a school's approach, students should expect intensive training in textual interpretation, voice and movement. Although there are some teachers who will encourage the improvisation as technique in order to free the actor of limitations in rehearsal. Harold Guskin's approach or &quot;taking it off the page&quot; as he calls it is steeped in this philosophy. Applications to drama programs and conservatories are through [[Audition (performing arts)|auditions]] in the United States. Anybody over the age of 18 can usually apply to [[drama school]].

Training may also start at a very young age. Acting classes and professional schools targeted at the under-18 crowd are offered in many locations. These classes introduce young actors to different aspects of acting and theatre from scene study to [[musical theatre]].

This behavior would frequently lead to conflict between Athens and the less powerful members of the League. By 431 BC Athens' heavy-handed control of the Delian League would prompt the outbreak of the [[Peloponnesian War]]; the League was dissolved upon the war's conclusion in 404 BC. 

==Background==
{{Main|Greco-Persian Wars}}

The Greco-Persian Wars had their roots in the conquest of the Greek cities of [[Asia Minor]], and particular [[Ionia]], by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian Empire]] of [[Cyrus the Great]] shortly after 550 BC. The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule, eventually settling for sponsoring a [[tyrant]] in each Ionian city.&lt;ref name = h147&gt;Holland, 147&amp;ndash;151&lt;/ref&gt; While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of arbitrary government that was on the decline.&lt;ref name = fine&gt;Fine, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NjeM0kcp8swC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=Ionian+revolt#PPA272,M1 pp269&amp;ndash;277]&lt;/ref&gt; By 500 BC, Ionia appears to have been ripe for rebellion against these Persian [[Clientage|clients]]. The simmering tension finally broke into open revolt due to the actions of the tyrant of [[Miletus]], [[Aristagoras]]. Attempting to save himself after a disastrous Persian-sponsored [[Siege of Naxos (499 BC)|expedition]] in 499 BC, Aristagoras chose to declare Miletus a democracy.&lt;ref name = V35&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23804;layout=;loc=5.34.1 V, 35]&lt;/ref&gt; This triggered similar revolutions across Ionia, extending to [[Doris (Asia Minor)|Doris]] and [[Aeolis]], beginning the [[Ionian Revolt]].&lt;ref name = h155&gt;Holland, pp155&amp;ndash;157&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek states of [[History of Athens|Athens]] and [[Eretria]] allowed themselves to be drawn into this conflict by Aristagoras, and during their only campaigning season (498 BC) they contributed to the capture and burning of the Persian regional capital of [[Sardis]].&lt;ref name = h160&gt;Holland, p160&amp;ndash;162&lt;/ref&gt; After this, the Ionian revolt carried on (without further outside aid) for a further five years, until it was finally completely crushed by the Persians. However, in a decision of great historic significance, the Persian king [[Darius the Great]] decided that, despite successfully subduing the revolt, there remained the unfinished business of exacting punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt.&lt;ref name = h175&gt;Holland, pp175&amp;ndash;177&lt;/ref&gt; The Ionian revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius's empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction of Athens and Eretria.&lt;ref name = h175/&gt;

In the next two decades there would be two Persian invasions of Greece, occasioning, thanks to Greek historians, some of the most famous battles in history. During the [[First Persian invasion of Greece|first invasion]], [[Thrace]], [[Macedon]] and the [[Aegean Islands]] were added to the Persian Empire, and Eretria was duly destroyed.&lt;ref name = h183&gt;Holland, pp183&amp;ndash;186&lt;/ref&gt; However, the invasion ended in 490 BC with the decisive Athenian victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]].&lt;ref name = h187&gt;Holland, pp187&amp;ndash;194&lt;/ref&gt; Between the two invasions, Darius died, and responsibility for the war passed to his son [[Xerxes I]].&lt;ref name = h202&gt;Holland, pp202&amp;ndash;203&lt;/ref&gt; Xerxes then personally led a [[second Persian invasion of Greece]] in 480 BC, taking an enormous (although oft-exaggerated) army and navy to Greece.&lt;ref name = h240&gt;Holland, pp240&amp;ndash;244&lt;/ref&gt; Those Greeks who chose to resist (the 'Allies') were defeated in the twin simultaneous battles of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] on land and [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]] at sea.&lt;ref name = h276&gt;Holland, pp276&amp;ndash;281&lt;/ref&gt; All of Greece except the [[Peloponnesus]] thus having fallen into Persian hands, the Persians then seeking to destroy the Allied navy once and for all, suffered a decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Salamis]].&lt;ref name=h320&gt;Holland, pp320&amp;ndash;326&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, 479 BC, the Allies assembled the largest Greek army yet seen and defeated the Persian invasion force at the [[Battle of Plataea]], ending the invasion and the threat to Greece.&lt;ref name=h342&gt;Holland, pp342&amp;ndash;355&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allied fleet defeated the demoralized remnants of the Persian fleet in the [[Battle of Mycale]]— on the same day as Plataea, according to tradition.&lt;ref name=h357&gt;Holland, pp357&amp;ndash;358&lt;/ref&gt; This action marks the end of the Persian invasion, and the beginning of the next phase in the Greco-Persian wars, [[Greco-Persian Wars#Greek counterattack|the Greek counterattack]].&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p247&lt;/ref&gt; After Mycale, the Greek cities of Asia Minor again revolted, with the Persians now powerless to stop them.&lt;ref name = TI89&gt;Thucydides [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200;query=chapter%3D%2389;layout=;loc=1.88.1 I, 89]&lt;/ref&gt; The Allied fleet then sailed to the [[Thracian Chersonese]], still held by the Persians, and besieged and captured the town of [[Sestos]].&lt;ref name = IX114&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231570;layout=;loc=9.115.1 IX, 114]&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, 478 BC, the Allies sent a force to capture the city of [[Byzantion]] (modern day [[Istanbul]]). The siege was successful, but the behaviour of the Spartan general [[Pausanias (general)|Pausanias]] alienated many of the Allies, and resulted in Pausanias's recall.&lt;ref name = TI95&gt;Thucydides [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200;query=chapter%3D%2395;layout=;loc=1.94.1 I, 95]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of the League==

After Byzantion, Sparta was eager to end its involvement in the war. The Spartans were of the view that, with the liberation of mainland Greece, and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that establishing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible.&lt;ref name = h362/&gt; In the aftermath of Mycale, the Spartan king Leotychides had proposed transplanting all the Greeks from Asia Minor to Europe as the only method of permanently freeing them from Persian dominion. Xanthippus, the Athenian commander at Mycale, had furiously rejected this; the Ionian cities were originally Athenian colonies, and the Athenians, if no-one else, would protect the Ionians.&lt;ref name = h362&gt;Holland, p362&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the point at which the leadership of the Greek alliance effectively passed to the Athenians.&lt;ref name = h362/&gt; With the Spartan withdrawal after Byzantion, the leadership of the Athenians became explicit.

The loose alliance of city states which had fought against Xerxes's invasion had been dominated by Sparta and the Peloponnesian league. With the withdrawal of these states, a congress was called on the holy island of [[Delos]] to institute a new alliance to continue the fight against the Persians; hence the modern designation &quot;Delian League&quot;. According to Thucydides, the official aim of the League was to &quot;avenge the wrongs they suffered by ravaging the territory of the king.&quot;&lt;ref name = TI96&gt;Thucydides I, 96&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, this goal was divided into three main efforts— to prepare for future invasion, to seek revenge against Persia, and to organize a means of dividing spoils of war. The members were given a choice of either offering armed forces or paying a tax to the joint treasury; most states chose the tax.&lt;ref name = TI96/&gt; League members swore to have the same friends and enemies, and dropped ingots of iron into the sea to symbolize the permanence of their alliance. The Athenian politician [[Aristides]] would spend the rest of his life occupied in the affairs of the alliance, dying (according to [[Plutarch]]) a few years later in Pontus, whilst determining what the tax of new members was to be.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Aristeides 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
{{main|Members of the Delian League}}

==Composition and expansion==
[[Image:Athenian empire atheight 450 shepherd1923.png|thumb|right|200px|The Athenian Empire at its height, ca. 450 BC]]

In the first ten years of the league's existence, [[Cimon|Cimon/Kimon]] forced [[Karystos]] in [[Euboea]] to join the league, conquered the island of [[Skyros]] and sent Athenian colonists there.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides I.98&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, especially with the suppression of rebellions, Athens exercised [[hegemony]] over the rest of the league. [[Thucydides]] describes how Athens's control over the League grew: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; Of all the causes of defection, that connected with arrears of tribute and vessels, and with failure of service, was the chief; for the Athenians were very severe and exacting, and made themselves offensive by applying the screw of necessity to men who were not used to and in fact not disposed for any continuous labor. In some other respects the Athenians were not the old popular rulers they had been at first; and if they had more than their fair share of service, it was correspondingly easy for them to reduce any that tried to leave the confederacy. The Athenians also arranged for the other members of the league to pay its share of the expense in money instead of in ships and men, and for this the subject city-states had themselves to blame, their wish to get out of giving service making most leave their homes. Thus while Athens was increasing her navy with the funds they contributed, a revolt always found itself without enough resources or experienced leaders for war.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides i. 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Rebellions==
===Naxos===

The first member of the league to attempt to secede was the island of [[Naxos Island|Naxos]] in 471 BC.  After being defeated, Naxos is believed to have been forced to tear down its walls, and lost its fleet and its vote in the League.

===Thasos===
{{main|Thasian rebellion}}

In 465 BC, Athens founded the colony of [[Amphipolis]] on the Strymon river. [[Thasos]], a member of the League, saw her interests in the mines of Mt. Paggaion threatened and defected from the League to Persia. She called to Sparta for assistance but was denied, as Sparta was facing the largest helot revolution in its history.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides I,100&lt;/ref&gt; An aftermath of the war was that [[Cimon]] was [[Ostracism|ostracised]], and the relations between Athens and Sparta turned hostile. After a three-year siege, Thasos was recaptured and forced back into the League. The siege of Thasos marks the transformation of the Delian league from an alliance into, in the words of Thucydides, a [[hegemony]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides 101&lt;/ref&gt; After two years Thasos surrendered to the Athenian leader Cimon. In result, the fortification walls of Thasos were torn down, their land and naval ships were confiscated by Athens. The mines of Thasos were also turned over to Athens, and they had to pay yearly tribute and fines.

==Policies of the League==

In 461 BC, Cimon was [[ostracism|ostracized]] and was succeeded in his influence by democrats such as [[Ephialtes]] and Pericles. This signaled a complete change in Athenian foreign policy, neglecting the alliance with the Spartans and instead allying with her enemies, [[Argos]] and [[Thessaly]]. [[Megara]] deserted the Spartan-led [[Peloponnesian League]] and allied herself with Athens, allowing construction of a double line of walls across the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] and protecting Athens from attack from that quarter. Around the same time, due to encouragement from influential speaker [[Themistocles]], the Athenians also constructed the [[Long Walls]] connecting their city to the [[Piraeus]], its port, making it effectively invulnerable to attack by land.

In 454 BC, the Athenian general [[Pericles]] moved the Delian League's treasury from Delos to Athens, allegedly to keep it safe from Persia. However, [[Plutarch]] indicates that many of Pericles' rivals viewed the transfer to Athens as usurping monetary resources to fund elaborate building projects. Athens also switched from accepting ships, men and weapons as dues from league members, to only accepting money. The new treasury established in Athens was used for many purposes, not all relating to the defence of members of the league. It was from tribute paid to the league that Pericles set to building the [[Parthenon]] on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], replacing an older temple, as well as many other non-defense related expenditures. The Delian League was turning from an alliance into an empire.

==Wars against Persia==
{{Main|Wars of the Delian League}}

War with the Persians continued. In 460 BC, [[Egypt]] revolted under local leaders the Hellenes called [[Inaros]] and [[Amyrtaeus]], who requested aid from Athens. Pericles led 250 ships, originally intended to attack [[Cyprus]], to their aid because it would further damage Persia. After four years, however, the Egyptian rebellion was defeated by the Achaemenid general [[Megabyzus]], who captured the greater part of the Athenian forces. In fact, according to Isocrates, the Athenians and their allies lost some 20,000 men in the expedition. The remainder escaped to [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] and thence returned home.

This was the Athenians' main (public) reason for moving the treasury of the League from Delos to Athens, further consolidating their control over the League. The Persians followed up their victory by sending a fleet to re-establish their control over [[Cyprus]], and 200 ships were sent out to counter them under [[Cimon]], who returned from ostracism in 451 BC. He died during the blockade of [[Citium]], though the fleet won a double victory by land and sea over the Persians off [[Salamis, Cyprus]].

This battle was the last major one fought against the Persians. Many writers report that a peace treaty, known as the [[Peace of Callias]], was formalized in 450 BC, but some writers believe that the treaty was a myth created later to inflate the stature of Athens. However, an understanding was definitely reached, enabling the Athenians to focus their attention on events in Greece proper.

==Wars in Greece==

Soon, [[First Peloponnesian War|war with the Peloponnesians]] broke out. In 458 BC, the Athenians blockaded the island of [[Aegina]], and simultaneously defended Megara from the Corinthians by sending out an army composed of those too young or old for regular military service. The following year, Sparta sent an army into [[Boeotia]], reviving the power of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] in order to help hold the Athenians in check. Their return was blocked, and they resolved to march on Athens, where the Long Walls were not yet completed, winning a victory at the [[Battle of Tanagra (457 BC)|Battle of Tanagra]]. All this accomplished, however, was to allow them to return home via the Megarid. Two months later, the Athenians under [[Myronides]] invaded Boeotia, and winning the [[Battle of Oenophyta]] gained control of the whole country except Thebes.

Reverses followed peace with Persia in 449 BC. The [[battle of Coronea (447 BC)|Battle of Coronea]], in 447 BC, led to the abandonment of Boeotia. [[Euboea]] and Megara both revolted, and while the former was restored to its status as a tributary ally, the latter was a permanent loss. The Delian and Peloponnesian Leagues signed a peace treaty, which was set to endure for thirty years. It only lasted until 431 BC, when the [[Peloponnesian War]] broke out.

Those who revolted unsuccessfully during the war saw the example made of the [[Mytilene|Mytilenians]], the principal people on [[Lesbos]]. After an unsuccessful revolt, the Athenians ordered the death of the entire male population. After some thought, they rescinded this order, and only put to death the leading 1000 ringleaders of the revolt, and redistributed the land of the entire island to Athenian shareholders, who were sent out to reside on Lesbos.

This type of treatment was not reserved solely for those who revolted. Thucydides documents the example of [[Melos]], a small island, neutral in the war, though originally founded by Spartans. The Melians were offered a choice to join the Athenians, or be conquered. Choosing to resist, their town was besieged and conquered; the males were put to death and the women sold into slavery (see [[Melian dialogue]]).

==The Athenian Empire (454–404 BC)==

By 454, the Delian League could be fairly characterized as an Athenian Empire; at the start of the [[Peloponnesian War]], only [[Chios]] and [[Lesbos]] were left to contribute ships, and these states were by now far too weak to secede without support. Lesbos tried to revolt first, and failed completely. Chios, the greatest and most powerful of the original members of the Delian League save Athens, was the last to revolt, and in the aftermath of the [[Syracusan Expedition]] enjoyed a success of several years, inspiring all of [[Ionia]] to revolt. Athens was, eventually still able to suppress these revolts.

To further strengthen Athens' grip on its empire, Pericles in 450 began a policy of establishing ''[[Cleruchy|cleruchiai]]''— quasi-colonies that remained tied to Athens and which served as garrisons to maintain control of the League's vast territory. Furthermore, Pericles employed a number of offices to maintain Athens' empire: ''[[proxeny|proxenoi]]'', who fostered good relations between Athens and League members; ''episkopoi'' and ''[[archont]]es'', who oversaw the collection of tribute; and ''[[hellenotamiai]]'', who received the tribute on Athens' behalf.

Athens's empire was not very stable, and only 27 years of war with the Spartans, aided by the Persians and internal strife, were able to defeat it. However, it did not remain defeated long. The [[Second Athenian Empire]], a maritime self-defense league, was founded in 377 BC and was led by Athens; but Athens would never recover the full extent of her power, and her enemies were now far stronger and more varied.

[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-T1129-501, August Horch in Horch-PKW.jpg|thumb|240px|August Horch in a [[Horch]] automobile, 1908.]]
[[Image:Gedenktafel horch ehrenfeld.jpg|thumb|200px|Memorial plate in [[Cologne, Germany]].]]
'''August Horch''' (12 October 1868 &amp;ndash; 3 February 1951) was a [[Germans|German]] [[engineer]] and [[automobile]] [[Innovator|pioneer]], the founder of the manufacturing giant which would eventually become [[Audi]].
 
==Beginnings==
Horch was born in [[Winningen]].  His initial trade was as a blacksmith, and then was educated at [[Hochschule Mittweida]] (Mittweida Technical College).  After receiving a degree in engineering, he worked in shipbuilding.  Horch worked for [[Karl Benz]] from 1896, before founding ''A. Horch &amp; Co.'' in November 1899, in [[Ehrenfeld, Cologne]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autoweek&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Names Behind The Company: August Horch|journal=[[AutoWeek]]|date=November 30, 2009|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing==
The first [[Horch]] automobile was built in 1901.  The company moved to [[Reichenbach]] in 1902 and [[Zwickau]] in 1904.  Horch left the company in 1909 after a dispute, and set up in competition in Zwickau.  His new firm was initially called ''Horch Automobil-Werke GmbH'', but following a legal dispute over the ''Horch'' name, he was obliged to change the company name.  (The court decided that ''Horch'' was a registered trademark on behalf of August Horch's former partners and August Horch was not entitled to use it any more).Consequently, Horch renamed his company ''[[Audi Automobilwerke GmbH]]'' in 1910, ''Audi'' being the Latinization of Horch.

==Post Audi==
Horch left Audi in 1920 and went to Berlin and took various jobs.  He published his autobiography, ''I Built Cars (Ich Baute Autos)'' in 1937.  He also served on the board of Auto Union, the successor to Audi Automobilwerke GmbH.  He was an honorary citizen of Zwickau and had a street named for his Audi cars in both Zwickau and his birthplace Winningen.  He was made an honorary professor at [[Braunschweig University of Technology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autoweek&quot;/&gt;

It also includes the hundreds of systems that are fitted to aircraft to meet individual roles, these can be as simple as a search light for a [[police helicopter]] or as complicated as the tactical system for an [[Airborne Early Warning]] platform.

==History==
The term avionics is believed to have been coined by journalist [[Philip J. Klass]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Robert. &quot;'Unexplained Cases'&amp;ndash;Only If You Ignore All Explanations&quot;, ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', March/April 2011, page 58&lt;/ref&gt; Avionics was pioneered in the 1970s, driven by military need rather than civil airliner development. Military aircraft had become flying sensor platforms, and making large amounts of electronic equipment work together had become the new challenge. Today, avionics as used in military aircraft almost always forms the biggest part of any development budget. Aircraft like the [[F-15E]] and the now retired [[F-14]] have roughly 80 percent of their budget spent on avionics. Most modern helicopters now have budget splits of 60/40 in favour of avionics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The civilian market has also seen a growth in cost of avionics. Flight control systems ([[fly-by-wire]]) and new navigation needs brought on by tighter airspaces, have pushed up development costs. The major change has been the recent boom in consumer flying. As more people begin to use planes as their primary method of transportation, more elaborate methods of controlling aircraft safely in these high restrictive airspaces have been invented.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Main categories==
===Aircraft avionics===

The cockpit of an aircraft is a major location for avionic equipment, including control, monitoring, communication, navigation, weather, and anti-collision systems. The majority of aircraft power their avionics using 14 or 28 volt [[direct current|DC]] electrical systems; however, larger, more sophisticated aircraft (such as [[airliner]]s or military combat aircraft) have [[alternating current|AC]] systems operating at 400&amp;nbsp;Hz and 115 volt rather than the more common 50 and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz of North American home electrical devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/electronics/q0219.shtml 400 Hz Electrical Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; There are several major vendors of flight avionics, including [[Honeywell]] (which now owns [[Bendix Aviation|Bendix/King]], Baker Electronics, Allied Signal, etc.), [[Rockwell Collins]], [[Thales Group]], [[Garmin]], [[Avidyne Corporation]], and [[Narco Avionics]].

====Communications====

Communications connect the flight deck to the ground and the flight deck to the passengers. On-board communications are provided by [[public address]] systems and aircraft [[intercom]]s.

The VHF aviation communication system works on the [[airband]] of 118.000&amp;nbsp;MHz to 136.975&amp;nbsp;MHz. Each channel is spaced from the adjacent ones by 8.33&amp;nbsp;kHz.  VHF is also used for line of sight communication such as aircraft-to-aircraft and aircraft-to-ATC.  [[Amplitude Modulation]] (AM) is used, and the conversation is performed in [[Simplex communication|simplex]] mode.  Aircraft communication can also take place using HF (especially for trans-oceanic flights) or satellite communication.

{{see also|Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System}}

====Navigation====

{{main|Radio navigation}}

[[Radio navigation|Navigation]] is the determination of position and direction on or above the surface of the Earth.  Avionics can use satellite-based systems (such as [[GPS]] and [[WAAS]]), ground-based systems (such as [[VOR]] or [[LORAN]]), or any combination thereof.  Older avionics required a pilot or navigator to plot the intersection of signals on a paper map to determine an aircraft's location; modern systems calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on moving map displays.

====Monitoring====

{{main|Glass cockpit}}

[[Glass cockpit]]s started to come into being with the Gulfstream [[G-IV]] private jet in 1985. Display systems provide sensor data that allows the aircraft to fly safely.  Much information that previously was displayed on mechanical gauges now appears on electronic displays in newer aircraft.

====Aircraft flight control systems====

{{main|Aircraft flight control systems}}

Airplanes and helicopters have means of automatically controlling flight. They reduce pilot workload at important times (like during landing, or in hover), and they make these actions safer by 'removing' pilot error. The first simple auto-pilots were used to control heading and altitude and had limited authority on things like thrust and flight control surfaces. In helicopters, auto stabilization was used in a similar way. The old systems were electromechanical in nature until very recently.

The advent of [[fly by wire]] and electro-actuated flight surfaces (rather than the traditional hydraulic) has increased safety. As with displays and instruments, critical devices which were electro-mechanical had a finite life. With safety critical systems, the software is very strictly tested.

====Collision-avoidance systems====

{{main|Aircraft collision avoidance systems}}

To supplement [[air traffic control]], most large transport aircraft and many smaller ones use a [[TCAS]] (Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System), which can detect the location of nearby aircraft, and provide instructions for avoiding a midair collision. Smaller aircraft may use simpler traffic alerting systems such as TPAS, which are passive (they do not actively interrogate the transponders of other aircraft) and do not provide advisories for conflict resolution.

To help avoid collision with terrain ([[CFIT]]), aircraft use systems such as ground-proximity warning systems ([[GPWS]]), which use radar altimeters as a key element. One of the major weaknesses of [[GPWS]] is the lack of &quot;look-ahead&quot; information, because it only provides altitude above terrain &quot;look-down&quot;. In order to overcome this weakness, modern aircraft use the Terrain Awareness Warning System ([[TAWS]]).

====Weather systems====

{{main|Weather radar}}
{{main|Lightning detector}}

Weather systems such as [[weather radar]] (typically [[Arinc 708]] on commercial aircraft) and [[lightning detector]]s are  important for aircraft flying at night or in [[instrument meteorological conditions]], where it is not possible for pilots to see the weather ahead.  Heavy precipitation (as sensed by radar) or severe turbulence (as sensed by lightning activity) are both indications of strong convective activity and severe turbulence, and weather systems allow pilots to deviate around these areas.

Lightning detectors like the Stormscope or Strikefinder have become inexpensive enough that they are practical for light aircraft. In addition to radar and lightning detection, observations and extended radar pictures (such as [[NEXRAD]]) are now available through satellite data connections, allowing pilots to see weather conditions far beyond the range of their own in-flight systems.  Modern displays allow weather information to be integrated with moving maps, terrain, traffic, etc. onto a single screen, greatly simplifying navigation.

====Aircraft management systems====
There has been a progression towards centralized control of the multiple complex systems fitted to aircraft, including engine monitoring and management. Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) are integrated with aircraft management computers to give maintainers early warnings of parts that will need replacement.

The [[Integrated Modular Avionics]] concept proposes an integrated architecture with application software portable across an assembly of common hardware modules. It has been used in [[fourth generation jet fighter]]s and the latest generation of [[airliner]]s.

===Mission or tactical avionics===
Military aircraft have been designed either to deliver a weapon or to be the eyes and ears of other weapon systems. The vast array of sensors available to the military is used for whatever tactical means required. As with aircraft management, the bigger sensor platforms (like the E-3D, JSTARS, ASTOR, Nimrod MRA4, Merlin HM Mk 1) have mission management computers.

Police and EMS aircraft also carry sophisticated tactical sensors.

====Military communications====
While aircraft communications provide the backbone for safe flight, the tactical systems are designed to withstand the rigours of the battle field. [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]], [[VHF]] Tactical (30-88&amp;nbsp;MHz) and SatCom systems combined with [[ECCM]] methods, and [[cryptography]] secure the communications. Data links like [[Link 11]], [[Link 16|16]], [[Link 22|22]] and [[Bowman (communications system)|BOWMAN]], [[JTRS]] and even [[TETRA]] provide the means of transmitting data (such as images, targeting information etc.).

====Radar====
Airborne [[radar]] was one of the first tactical sensors. The benefit of altitude providing range has meant a significant focus on airborne radar technologies. Radars include [[Airborne Early Warning]] (AEW), [[Anti-Submarine Warfare]] (ASW), and even [[Weather radar]] ([[Arinc 708]]) and ground tracking/proximity radar.

The military uses radar in fast jets to help pilots fly at low levels. While the civil market has had weather radar for a while, there are strict rules about using it to navigate the aircraft.

====Sonar====
Dipping sonar fitted to a range of military helicopters allows the [[helicopter]] to protect shipping assets from submarines or surface threats. Maritime support aircraft can drop active and passive sonar devices ([[Sonobuoy]]s) and these are also used to determine the location of hostile [[submarines]].

====Electro-Optics====
Electro-optic systems include Forward Looking Infrared ([[FLIR]]), and Passive Infrared Devices ([[PIDS]]). These are all used to provide imagery to crews. This imagery is used for everything from Search and Rescue through to acquiring better resolution on a target.

====ESM/DAS====
Electronic support measures and defensive aids are used extensively to gather information about threats or possible threats. They can be used to launch devices (in some cases automatically) to counter direct threats against the aircraft. They are also used to determine the state of a threat and identify it.

===Aircraft Networks===
The avionics systems in military, commercial and advanced models of civilian aircraft are interconnected using an avionics databus. Common avionics databus protocols, with their primary application, include:
* [[Aircraft Data Network]] ([[Aircraft Data Network|ADN]]): Ethernet derivative for Commercial Aircraft
* [[AFDX|Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX)]]: Specific implementation of ARINC 664 ([[Aircraft Data Network|ADN]]) for Commercial Aircraft
* [[ARINC 429]]: Generic Medium-Speed Data Sharing for Private and Commercial Aircraft
* [[Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet|ARINC 664]]: See ADN above
* [[ARINC 629]]: Commercial Aircraft (Boeing 777)
* [[ARINC 708]]: Weather Radar for Commercial Aircraft
* [[ARINC 717]]: Flight Data Recorder for Commercial Aircraft
* [[IEEE 1394b#Military Aircraft|IEEE 1394b]]: Military Aircraft
* [[MIL-STD-1553]]: Military Aircraft
* [[MIL-STD-1760]]: Military Aircraft
* [[TTP]] - Time-Triggered Protocol: [[Boeing 787]] Dreamliner, [[Airbus A380]], Fly-By-Wire Actuation Platforms from Parker Aerospace
* [[TTEthernet]] - Time-Triggered Ethernet: [[NASA Orion]] Spacecraft

===Police and Air Ambulance===
Police and EMS aircraft (mostly helicopters) are now a significant market. Military aircraft are often now built with a role available to assist in civil disobedience. Police helicopters are almost always fitted with video/FLIR systems to allow them to track suspects. They can also be fitted with searchlights and loudspeakers.

EMS and police helicopters will be required to fly in unpleasant conditions, this may require more aircraft sensors, some of which were until recently considered purely for military aircraft.

'''Ares''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: {{Polytonic|Ἄρης}} {{IPA-el|árɛːs|}}, Μodern [[Greek language|Greek]]: Άρης {{IPA-el|ˈaris|}}) is the [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek god]] [[war god|of war]].  He is one of the [[Twelve Olympians]], and the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Theogony'' 921 ([[Loeb Classical Library]] [http://books.google.com/books?id=lnCXI9oFeroC&amp;dq=Ares+intitle%3Atheogony+inauthor%3Ahesiod&amp;q=%22she%2C+mingling+in+love%22+Ares#v=snippet&amp;q=%22she%2C%20mingling%20in%20love%22%20Ares&amp;f=false numbering]); ''[[Iliad]]'', 5.890–896. By contrast, Ares' Roman counterpart [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] was born from [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] alone, according to [[Ovid]] (''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'' 5.229–260).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Greek literature|Greek literature]], he often represents the physical or violent aspect of war, in contrast to the armored [[Athena]], whose functions as a [[knowledge deity|goddess of intelligence]] include [[military strategy]] and [[general officer|generalship]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''Greek Religion'' (Blackwell, 1985, 2004 reprint, originally published 1977 in German), pp. 141; William Hansen, ''Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks and Romans'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks were ambivalent toward Ares: although he embodied the physical valor necessary for success in war, he was a dangerous force, &quot;overwhelming, insatiable in battle, destructive, and man-slaughtering.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Fear ''([[Phobos (mythology)|Phobos]])'' and Terror ''([[Deimos (mythology)|Deimos]])'' were yoked to his battle [[chariot]].&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', p.169.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Iliad]]'' his father Zeus tells him that he is the god most hateful to him.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Iliad]]'' 5.890–891.&lt;/ref&gt; An association with Ares endows places and objects with a savage, dangerous, or militarized quality.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Classical Mythology'', pp. 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt; His value as a war god is even placed in doubt: during the [[Trojan War]], Ares was on the losing side, while Athena, often depicted in [[ancient Greek art|Greek art]] as holding [[Nike (mythology)|Nike (Victory)]] in her hand, favored the triumphant Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'',p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ares plays a relatively limited role in [[Greek mythology]] as represented in literary narratives, though his numerous love affairs and abundant offspring are often [[allusion|alluded]] to.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Classical Mythology'', pp. 113–114; Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; When Ares does appear in myths, he typically faces humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Classical Mythology'', pp. 113–114. See for instance [[Ares#Ares and the giants|Ares and the giants]] below.&lt;/ref&gt; He is well known as the lover of [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love who was married to [[Hephaestus]], god of craftsmanship,&lt;ref&gt;In the ''Iliad'', however, the wife of Hephaestus is Charis, &quot;Grace,&quot; as noted by Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; but the most famous story involving the couple shows them exposed to ridicule through the wronged husband's clever device.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 8.266–366; Hansen, ''Classical Mythology'', pp. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The counterpart of Ares among the [[List of Roman deities|Roman gods]] is [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], who as a father of the Roman people held a more important and dignified place in [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] for his agricultural and [[tutelary deity|tutelary]] functions. During the [[Hellenization]] of [[Latin literature]], the myths of Ares were [[interpretatio graeca|reinterpreted]] by Roman writers under the name of Mars. Greek writers under [[Roman Empire|Roman rule]] also recorded [[cult (religious practice)|cult practices]] and beliefs pertaining to Mars under the name of Ares. Thus in the [[classical mythology|classical tradition]] of later [[Western culture|Western art and literature]], the mythology of the two figures becomes virtually indistinguishable.

==Names and epithets==
The etymology of the name ''Ares'' is traditionally connected with the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''ἀρή'' (''arē''), the [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] form of the [[Doric Greek|Doric]] ''ἀρά'' (''ara''), &quot;bane, ruin, curse, imprecation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Ares&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3D%231412 Are], Georg Autenrieth, ''A Homeric Dictionary'', at Perseus; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2314642 Are], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be a connection with the Roman god of war [[Mars (god)|Mars]], via hypothetical [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''M̥rēs''; {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  compare Ancient Greek ''μάρναμαι'' (''marnamai''), &quot;to fight, to battle&quot;, or Hindi and Punjabi ''maarna'' (to kill, to hit).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2365073 Marnamai], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest attested form of the name is the [[Mycenaean language|Mycenaean Greek]] ''a-re'', written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=346723 Palaeolexicon], Word study tool of ancient languages&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Burkert]] notes that &quot;Ares is apparently an ancient abstract noun meaning throng of battle, war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''Greek Religion'' (Harvard) 1985:pt III.2.12 p 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[adjective|adjectival]] [[epithet]] ''Areios'' was frequently appended to the names of other gods when they take on a warrior aspect or become involved in warfare: ''Zeus Areios'', ''Athena Areia'', even ''Aphrodite Areia''. In the ''Iliad'', the word ''ares'' is used as a [[common noun]] synonymous with &quot;battle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inscriptions as early as [[Mycenaean]] times, and continuing into the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], attest to [[Enyalios]], another name for the god of war.

==Character and origins==
Ares was one of the Twelve Olympians in the archaic tradition represented by the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', but Zeus expresses a recurring Greek revulsion toward the god when Ares returns wounded and complaining from the [[Trojan War|battlefield at Troy]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then looking at him darkly Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to him:&lt;br&gt;'Do not sit beside me and whine, you double-faced liar.&lt;br&gt;To me you are the most hateful of all gods who hold Olympos.&lt;br&gt;Forever quarrelling is dear to your heart, wars and battles.&lt;br&gt;…&lt;br&gt;And yet I will not long endure to see you in pain, since&lt;br&gt;you are my child, and it was to me that your mother bore you.&lt;br&gt;But were you born of some other god and proved so ruinous&lt;br&gt;long since you would have been dropped beneath the gods of the bright sky.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'', Book 5, lines 798–891, 895–898 in the translation of [[Richmond Lattimore]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This ambivalence is expressed also in the god's association with the [[Thracians]], who were regarded by the Greeks as a barbarous and warlike people.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Iliad]]'' 13.301; [[Ovid]], ''Ars Amatoria'', II.10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thrace]] was Ares' birthplace, true home, and refuge after the affair with Aphrodite was exposed to the general mockery of the other gods.&lt;ref&gt;Homer ''Odyssey'' viii. 361; for Ares/Mars and Thrace, see [[Ovid]], ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', book ii.part xi.585, which tells the same tale: &quot;Their captive bodies are, with difficulty, freed, at your plea, Neptune: Venus runs to Paphos: Mars heads for Thrace.&quot;; for Ares/Mars and Thrace, see also [[Statius]], ''Thebaid'' vii. 42; [[Herodotus]], iv. 59, 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

A late 6th-century BC funerary inscription from [[Attica]] emphasizes the consequences of coming under Ares' sway:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Stay and mourn at the tomb of dead Kroisos&lt;br&gt;Whom raging Ares destroyed one day, fighting in the foremost ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Athens, NM 3851 quoted in Andrew Stewart, ''One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works'', Introduction: I. &quot;The Sources&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], however, he was viewed as a bearded war veteran with superb military skills and physical strength.  The [[ancient Macedonians]] looked up to Ares as a divine leader as well as a god.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} In [[Sparta]] Ares was viewed as a [[masculine]] soldier in which his resilience, physical strength and military intelligence was unrivaled.{{cn|date=May 2011}}

==Attributes==
[[Image:Ares Borghese2.gif|thumb|right|200px|The ''[[Ares Borghese]]'']]
The birds of Ares (''Ornithes Areioi'') were a flock of feather-dart-dropping birds that guarded the [[Amazons]]' shrine of the god on a [[coast]]al [[island]] in the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Argonautica]]'' (ii.382ff and 1031ff; [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Vultures and dogs, both of which prey upon carrion in the battlefield, were  [[sacred]] to him.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Cult and ritual==
Although Ares received occasional sacrifice from armies going to war, the god had a formal temple and cult at only a few sites.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Sparta]], however, youths each sacrificed a puppy to [[Enyalios]] before engaging in ritual fighting at the Phoebaeum.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Here each company of youths sacrifices a puppy to Enyalius, holding that the most valiant of tame animals is an acceptable victim to the most valiant of the gods. I know of no other Greeks who are accustomed to sacrifice puppies except the people of [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]]; these too sacrifice a puppy, a black bitch, to the Wayside Goddess.&quot; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], 3.14.9.&lt;/ref&gt;The [[chthonic]] night-time sacrifice of a dog to Enyalios became assimilated to the cult of Ares.{{cn|date=May 2011}}

Just east of Sparta stood an archaic statue of the god in chains, to show that the spirit of war and victory was never to leave the city.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Opposite this temple [the temple of Hipposthenes] is an old image of Enyalius in fetters. The idea the Lacedaemonians express by this image is the same as the Athenians express by their Wingless Victory; the former think that Enyalius will never run away from them, being bound in the fetters, while the Athenians think that Victory, having no wings, will always remain where she is.&quot; Pausanias, 3.15.7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Greek temple|temple]] to Ares in the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|agora]] of [[Athens]] that [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] saw in the second century AD had only been moved and rededicated there during the time of [[Augustus]]; in essence it was a Roman [[Roman temple|temple]] to the Augustan [[Mars (mythology)#Mars Ultor|Mars Ultor]].&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Areopagus]], the &quot;mount of Ares&quot; where [[Paul of Tarsus]] preached, is sited at some distance from the Acropolis; from archaic times it was a site of trials. Its connection with Ares, perhaps based on a false etymology, is purely [[Etiology|etiological myth]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} A second temple has also been located at the archaeological site of [[Metropolis (Anatolia)|Metropolis]] in what is now Western [[Turkey]].{{cn|date=May 2011}}

==Attendants==
[[Deimos (mythology)|Deimos]], &quot;Terror&quot; or &quot;Dread&quot;, and [[Phobos (mythology)|Phobos]], &quot;Fear&quot;, are his companions in war&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 4.436f, and 13.299f' Hesiodic ''[[Shield of Heracles]] 191, 460; [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], 10.51, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and also his children, borne by [[Aphrodite]], according to [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'' 934f.&lt;/ref&gt; The sister{{cn|date=May 2011}} and companion of the violent Ares is [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the goddess of discord, or [[Enyo]], the goddess of war, bloodshed, and violence. Enyalius, rather than another name for Ares, in at least one tradition was his son by Enyo.&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius on Homer 944&lt;/ref&gt;

Ares may also be accompanied by [[Kydoimos]], the demon of the din of battle; the [[Makhai]] (&quot;Battles&quot;); thev &quot;Hysminai&quot; (&quot;Acts of manslaughter&quot;); [[Polemos]], a minor spirit of war, or only an epithet of Ares, since it has no specific dominion; and Polemos's daughter, [[Alala]], the [[goddess]] or [[personification]] of the Greek war-cry, whose name Ares uses as his own war-cry. Ares's sister [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]], &quot;Youth,&quot; also draws baths for him.

According to [[Pausanias]], local inhabitants of [[Therapne]], [[Sparta]], recognized [[Thero (Greek mythology)|Thero]] &quot;feral, savage&quot; as a nurse of Ares.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 3. 19. 7 - 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding of Thebes==
One of the roles of Ares that was sited in mainland Greece itself was in the [[founding myth]] of Thebes: Ares was the progenitor of the water-dragon slain by [[Cadmus]], for the dragon's teeth were sown into the ground as if a crop and sprung up as the fully armored [[indigenous peoples|autochthon]]ic [[Spartoi]]. To propitiate Ares, Cadmus took as a bride [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]], daughter of Ares' union with Aphrodite, thus harmonizing all strife and founding the city of Thebes.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion,'' p.169.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consorts and children==
[[Image:Areopagus from the Acropolis.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Areopagus]] as viewed from the [[Acropolis]].]]

The union of Ares and Aphrodite created the gods [[Eros]], [[Anteros]], [[Phobos (mythology)|Phobos]], [[Deimos (mythology)|Deimos]], [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]], and [[Adrestia]]. While Eros and Anteros' godly stations favored their mother, Adrestia by far preferred to emulate her father, often accompanying him to war.{{cn|date=May 2011}}

Ares, upon one occasion, incurred the anger of [[Poseidon]] by slaying his son [[Halirrhothius]], who had raped Alcippe, another daughter of the war-god. For this deed, Poseidon summoned Ares to appear before the tribunal of the Olympic gods, which was held upon a hill in Athens. Ares was acquitted, and this event is supposed to have given rise to the name [[Areopagus]] (or Hill of Ares), which afterward became famous as a court of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Berens, E.M.: ''Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome'', page 113. Project Gutenberg, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are accounts of a son of Ares, [[Cycnus]] (Κύκνος) of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], who was so murderous that he tried to build a temple with the skulls and the bones of travellers. [[Heracles]] slaughtered this abominable monstrosity, engendering the wrath of Ares, whom the hero wounded.{{cn|date=May 2011}}

==Hymns to Ares==

;Homeric Hymn 8 to Ares (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th to 4th B.C.) :

:&quot;Ares, exceeding in strength, chariot-rider, golden-helmed, doughty in heart, shield-bearer, Saviour of cities, harnessed in bronze, strong of arm, unwearying, mighty with the spear, O defender of Olympos, father of warlike Nike (Victory), ally of Themis, stern governor of the rebellious, leader of the righteous men, sceptred King of manliness, who whirl your fiery sphere [the star Mars] among the planets in their sevenfold courses through the aither wherein your blazing steeds ever bear you above the third firmament of heaven; hear me, helper of men, giver of dauntless youth! Shed down a kindly ray from above upon my life, and strength of war, that I may be able to drive away bitter cowardice from my head and crush down the deceitful impulses of my soul. Restrain also the keen fury of my heart which provokes me to tread the ways of blood-curdling strife. Rather, O blessed one, give you me boldness to abide within the harmless laws of peace, avoiding strife and hatred and the violent fiends of death.&quot;

;Orphic Hymn 65 to Ares (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.) :

:&quot;To Ares, Fumigation from Frankincense. Magnanimous, unconquered, boisterous Ares, in darts rejoicing, and in bloody wars; fierce and untamed, whose mighty power can make the strongest walls from their foundations shake: mortal-destroying king, defiled with gore, pleased with war’s dreadful and tumultuous roar. Thee human blood, and swords, and spears delight, and the dire ruin of mad savage fight. Stay furious contests, and avenging strife, whose works with woe embitter human life; to lovely Kyrpis [Aphrodite] and to Lyaios [Dionysos] yield, for arms exchange the labours of the field; encourage peace, to gentle works inclined, and give abundance, with benignant mind.&quot;

==Other accounts==
[[Image:Ares Ludovisi Altemps Inv8602 n2.jpg|thumb|The [[Ludovisi Ares]], Roman version of a Greek original ''ca.'' 320 BC, with 17th-century restorations by [[Bernini]]]]
In the tale sung by the bard in the hall of [[Alcinous]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 8.300&lt;/ref&gt; the Sun-god [[Helios]] once spied Ares and Aphrodite enjoying each other secretly in the hall of [[Hephaestus]], and he promptly reported the incident to Aphrodite's Olympian consort. Hephaestus contrived to catch the couple in the act, and so he fashioned a finely-knitted and nearly invisible net with which to snare the illicit lovers. At the appropriate time, this net was sprung, and trapped Ares and Aphrodite locked in very private embrace. But Hephaestus was not yet satisfied with his revenge — he invited the Olympian gods and goddesses to view the unfortunate pair. For the sake of modesty, the goddesses demurred, but the male gods went to witness the sight. Some commented on the beauty of Aphrodite, others remarked that they would eagerly trade places with Ares, but all who were present mocked the two. Once the couple were loosed, Ares, embarrassed, returned to his homeland, Thrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Odyssey, 8.295 | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0218;query=card%3D%2371;layout=;loc=8.333 | quote = In [[Robert Fagles]]' translation &quot;&quot;…and the two lovers, free of the bonds that overwhelmed them so, sprang up and away at once, and the Wargod sped Thrace, while Love with her telltale laughter sped to Paphos…&quot;.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a much later interpolated detail, Ares put the youth [[Alectryon]] by his door to warn them of Helios' arrival, as Helios would tell Hephaestus of Aphrodite's infidelity if the two were discovered, but Alectryon fell asleep. Helios discovered the two and alerted Hephaestus. Ares was furious and turned Alectryon into a [[rooster]], which now never forgets to announce the arrival of the sun in the morning.

===Ares and the giants===
In one archaic myth related only in the ''Iliad'' by the goddess [[Dione (mythology)|Dione]] to her daughter Aphrodite, two chthonic giants, the [[Aloadae]], named Otus and Ephialtes, threw Ares into chains and put him in a bronze urn, where he remained for thirteen months, a [[lunar year]]. &quot;And that would have been the end of Ares and his appetite for war, if the beautiful [[Eriboea]], the young giants' stepmother, had not told [[Hermes]] what they had done,&quot; she related.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 5.385&amp;ndash;391.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;In this one suspects a festival of licence which is unleashed in the thirteenth month.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;rjblqd&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Burkert|title=Greek Religion| year=1985| pages= 169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ares remained screaming and howling in the urn until Hermes rescued him and [[Artemis]] tricked the Aloadae into slaying each other. In [[Nonnus]]' ''[[Dionysiaca]]''&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'' 18. 274 ff; [http://www.theoi.com/Gigante/GiganteEkhidnades.html Theoi.com, &quot;Ekhidnades&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; Ares also killed Ekhidnades, the giant son of [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]] and a great enemy of the gods; it is not clear whether the nameless Ekhidnades (&quot;of Echidna's lineage&quot;) was entirely Nonnus' invention or not. &lt;!--is this in Dionysiaca?:Zeus helped him heal afterwards.--&gt;

===The Iliad===
In the ''[[Iliad]]'',&lt;ref&gt;References to Ares' appearance in the ''Iliad'' are collected and quoted at [http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AresMyths2.html#Troy www.theoi.com: Ares Myths 2]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] represented Ares as having no fixed allegiances, rewarding courage on both sides: he promised Athena and Hera that he would fight on the side of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] (''Iliad'' V.830–834, XXI.410–414), but [[Aphrodite]] was able to persuade Ares to side with the [[Troy|Trojans]]. During the war, [[Diomedes]] fought with [[Hector]] and saw Ares fighting on the Trojans' side. Diomedes called for his soldiers to fall back slowly (V.590–605). Hera, Ares's mother, saw his interference and asked Zeus, his father, for permission to drive Ares away from the battlefield, which Zeus granted (V.711–769). Hera and Athena encouraged Diomedes to attack Ares (V.780–834). Diomedes thrust with his spear at Ares, with Athena driving it home, and Ares' cries made Achaeans and Trojans alike tremble (V.855–864). Ares fled to [[Mt. Olympus]], forcing the Trojans to fall back.

When Hera during a conversation with Zeus mentioned that Ares' son Ascalaphus was killed, Ares wanted to again join the fight on the side of the Achaeans disregarding Zeus' order that no Olympic god should enter the battle, but Athena stopped him (XV.110–128). Later, when [[Zeus]] allowed the gods to fight in the war again (XX.20–29), Ares was the first to act, attacking Athena to avenge himself for his previous injury, but Athena managed to overpower him by striking Ares with a boulder (XXI.391–408).

==Renaissance==
In [[Renaissance]] and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] works of art, Ares' symbols are a spear and helmet, his animal is a dog, and his bird is the vulture. In literary works&lt;!--examples would be more enlightening than this generality--&gt; of these eras, Ares is replaced by the Roman Mars, a romantic emblem of manly valor rather than the cruel and blood-thirsty god of Greek mythology.

==Popular culture==
{{commons|Ares (god)}}
{{main|Ares in popular culture}}&lt;!--items that belong at that article should not be added here, as they may be deleted without comment--&gt;
Ares figures in war-themed [[video game]]s and in popular fictions.

'''Alexander Grothendieck''' (born 28 March 1928) is a [[mathematician]] and the central figure behind the creation of the modern theory of [[algebraic geometry]]. His research program vastly extended the scope of the field, incorporating major elements of [[commutative algebra]], [[homological algebra]], [[sheaf theory]], and [[category theory]] into its foundations. This new [[Grothendieck's relative point of view | perspective]] led to revolutionary advances across many areas of [[pure mathematics]].

Within [[algebraic geometry]] itself, his theory of [[Scheme_(mathematics) | schemes]] has become the universally accepted language for all further technical work. His [[Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem | generalization]] of the classical [[Riemann-Roch theorem]] launched the study of [[Algebraic K-theory | algebraic]] and [[Topological K-theory | topological]] [[K-theory]]. His construction of new [[cohomology]] theories has left deep consequences for [[algebraic number theory]], [[algebraic topology]], and [[representation theory]]. His creation of [[topos theory]] has had an impact on [[set theory]] and [[logic]].

One of his most celebrated achievements is the discovery of the first arithmetic [[Weil cohomology]] theory: the [[étale cohomology | ℓ-adic étale cohomology]]. This key result opened the way for a proof of the [[Weil conjectures]], ultimately completed by his student [[Pierre Deligne]]. To this day, [[l-adic cohomology | ℓ-adic cohomology]] remains a fundamental tool for number theorists, with important applications to the [[Langlands program]].

Grothendieck’s way of thinking has influenced generations of mathematicians long after his departure from mathematics. His emphasis on the role of [[universal property | universal properties]] brought [[category theory]] into the mainstream as an important organizing principle. His notion of [[abelian category]] is now the basic object of study in [[homological algebra]]. His conjectural theory of [[Motive_(algebraic_geometry) | motives]] has been a driving force behind modern developments in [[algebraic K-theory]], [[Motivic cohomology | motivic homotopy theory]], and [[motivic integration]].

Driven by deep personal and political convictions, Grothendieck left the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]], where he had been appointed professor and accomplished his greatest work, after a dispute over military funding in 1970. His mathematical activity essentially ceased after this, and he devoted his energies to political causes. He formally retired in 1988 and within a few years moved to the [[Pyrenees]], where he currently lives in isolation from human society.

==Mathematical achievements==
Grothendieck's early mathematical work was in [[functional analysis]]. Between 1949 and 1953 he worked on his doctoral thesis in this subject at [[Nancy]], supervised by [[Jean Dieudonné]] and [[Laurent Schwartz]]. His key contributions include [[topological tensor product]]s of [[topological vector space]]s, the theory of [[nuclear space]]s as foundational for [[Schwartz distribution]]s, and the application of [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]] in studying linear maps between topological vector spaces. In a few years, he had turned himself into a leading authority on this area of functional analysis — to the extent that Dieudonné compares his impact in this field to that of [[Stefan Banach|Banach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dieudonné|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is, however, in [[algebraic geometry]] and related fields where Grothendieck did his most important and influential work. From about 1955 he started to work on [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] theory and [[homological algebra]], producing the influential &quot;Tôhoku paper&quot; (''Sur quelques points d'algèbre homologique'', published in 1957) where he introduced [[Abelian category|Abelian categories]] and applied their theory to show that [[sheaf cohomology]] can be defined as certain [[derived functor]]s in this context.

Homological methods and sheaf theory had already been introduced in algebraic geometry by [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and others, after sheaves had been defined by [[Jean Leray]]. Grothendieck took them to a higher level of abstraction and turned them into a key organising principle of his theory. He shifted attention from the study of individual varieties to the ''[[Grothendieck's relative point of view|relative point of view]]'' (pairs of varieties related by a [[morphism]]), allowing a broad generalization of many classical theorems. The first major application was the relative version of Serre's theorem showing that the cohomology of  a [[coherent sheaf]] on a complete variety is finite dimensional; Grothendieck's theorem shows that the [[higher direct image]]s of coherent sheaves under a proper map are coherent; this reduces to Serre's theorem over a one-point space.

In 1956, he applied the same thinking to the [[Riemann&amp;ndash;Roch theorem]], which had already recently been generalized to any dimension by [[Friedrich Hirzebruch|Hirzebruch]]. The [[Grothendieck&amp;ndash;Riemann&amp;ndash;Roch theorem]] was announced by Grothendieck at the initial [[Mathematische Arbeitstagung]] in [[Bonn]], in 1957. It appeared in print in a paper written by [[Armand Borel]] with Serre. This result was his first major achievement in algebraic geometry. He went on to plan and execute a major foundational programme for rebuilding the foundations of algebraic geometry, which were then in a state of flux and under discussion in [[Claude Chevalley]]'s seminar; he outlined his programme in his talk at the 1958 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]].

His foundational work on algebraic geometry is at a higher level of abstraction than all prior versions. He adapted the use of non-closed [[generic point]]s, which led to the theory of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]. He also pioneered the systematic use of [[nilpotent]]s. As 'functions' these can take only the value 0, but they carry infinitesimal information, in purely algebraic settings. His ''theory of schemes'' has become established as the best universal foundation for this major field, because of its great expressive power as well as technical depth. In that setting one can use [[birational geometry]], techniques from [[number theory]], [[Galois theory]] and [[commutative algebra]], and close analogues of the methods of [[algebraic topology]], all in an integrated way.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{harv|Deligne|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MumfordQuote&gt;

He is also noted for his mastery of abstract approaches to mathematics and his perfectionism in matters of formulation and presentation. Relatively little of his work after 1960 was published by the conventional route of the [[learned journal]], circulating initially in duplicated volumes of seminar notes; his influence was to a considerable extent personal. His influence spilled over into many other branches of mathematics, for example the contemporary theory of [[D-module]]s. (It also provoked adverse reactions, with many mathematicians seeking out more concrete areas and problems.)&lt;ref name=&quot;scienceline&quot;&gt;

===EGA and SGA===

The bulk of Grothendieck's published work is collected in the monumental, and yet incomplete, ''[[Éléments de géométrie algébrique]]'' (EGA) and ''[[Séminaire de géométrie algébrique]]'' (SGA).  The collection ''[[Fondements de la Géometrie Algébrique]]'' (FGA), which gathers together talks given in the [[Séminaire Bourbaki]], also contains important material.

Perhaps Grothendieck's deepest single accomplishment is the invention of the [[étale cohomology|étale]] and [[l-adic cohomology]] theories, which explain an observation of [[André Weil]]'s that there is a deep connection between the topological characteristics of a variety and its diophantine (number theoretic) properties. For example, the number of solutions of an equation over a [[finite field]] reflects the topological nature of its solutions over the [[complex number]]s. Weil realized that to prove such a connection one needed a new cohomology theory, but neither he nor any other expert saw how to do this until such a theory was found by Grothendieck.

This program culminated in the proofs of the [[Weil conjectures]], the last of which was settled by Grothendieck's student [[Pierre Deligne]] in the early 1970s after Grothendieck had largely withdrawn from mathematics.

===Major mathematical topics (from ''Récoltes et Semailles'')===

He wrote a retrospective assessment of his mathematical work (see the external link ''La Vision'' below). As his main mathematical achievements (&quot;maître-thèmes&quot;), he chose this collection of 12 topics (his chronological order):

#[[Topological tensor product]]s and [[nuclear space]]s
#&quot;Continuous&quot; and &quot;discrete&quot; [[Duality (mathematics)|duality]] ([[derived category|derived categories]] and &quot;[[six operations (mathematics)|six operations]]&quot;).
#''Yoga'' of the [[Grothendieck&amp;ndash;Riemann&amp;ndash;Roch theorem]] ([[K-theory]], relation with [[intersection theory]]).
#[[Scheme (mathematics)|Scheme]]s.
#[[topos|Topoi]].
#[[Étale cohomology]] including [[l-adic cohomology]].
#[[Motive (mathematics)|Motive]]s and the [[motivic Galois group]] (and [[Grothendieck category|Grothendieck categories]])
#Crystals and [[crystalline cohomology]], ''yoga'' of De Rham and Hodge coefficients.
#Topological algebra, infinity-stacks, 'dérivateurs', cohomological formalism of toposes as an inspiration for a new [[homotopic algebra]]
#[[Tame topology]].
#''Yoga'' of [[anabelian geometry]] and [[Galois&amp;ndash;Teichmüller theory]].
#Schematic point of view, or &quot;arithmetics&quot; for [[regular polyhedron|regular polyhedra]] and [[regular configurations]] of all sorts.

He wrote that the central theme of the topics above is that of topos theory, while the first and last were of the least importance to him.

Here the term ''yoga'' denotes a kind of &quot;meta-theory&quot; that can be used heuristically; [[Michel Raynaud]] writes the other terms &quot;Ariadne's thread&quot; and &quot;philosophy&quot; as effective equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/200309/rev-raynaud.pdf, at p. 2.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Family and early life===
Alexander Grothendieck was born in Berlin to [[anarchist]] parents: a [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] father from an ultimately [[Hassidic]] family, [[Sascha Shapiro|Alexander &quot;Sascha&quot; Shapiro]] aka Tanaroff, and a mother from a [[Germany|German]] [[Protestant]] family, Johanna &quot;Hanka&quot; Grothendieck; both of his parents had broken away from their early backgrounds in their teens.&lt;ref name=&quot;siam.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1405 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his birth Grothendieck's mother was married to Johannes Raddatz, a German journalist, and his birthname was initially recorded as ''Alexander Raddatz''. The marriage was dissolved in 1929 and Shapiro/Tanaroff acknowledged his paternity, but never married Hanka Grothendieck.&lt;ref name=&quot;siam.org&quot;/&gt;
			
Grothendieck lived with his parents until 1933 in [[Berlin]]. At the end of that year, Shapiro moved to [[Paris]], and Hanka followed him the next year. They left Grothendieck in the care of Wilhelm Heydorn, a [[Lutheran]] [[Pastor]] and teacher&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/200409/fea-grothendieck-part1.pdf Allyn Jackson, The Life of Alexander Grothendieck, p. 1040]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hamburg]] where he went to school. During this time, his parents fought in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

===During WWII===

In 1939 Grothendieck came to France and lived in various camps for displaced persons with his mother, first at the [[Camp de Rieucros]], and subsequently lived for the remainder of the war in the village of [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon]], where he was sheltered and hidden in local boarding-houses or pensions. His father was sent via [[Drancy internment camp|Drancy]] to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] where he died in 1942. While Grothendieck lived in Chambon, he attended the Collège Cévenol (now known as the [[Le Collège-Lycée Cévenol International]]), a unique secondary school founded in 1938 by local Protestant pacifists and anti-war activists.  Many of the refugee children being hidden in Chambon attended Cévenol and it was at this school that Grothendieck apparently first became fascinated with mathematics.

===Studies and contact with research mathematics===

After the war, the young Grothendieck studied mathematics in [[France]], initially at the [[University of Montpellier]]. After three years of increasingly independent studies there he got a scholarship to go to continue his studies in [[Paris]] in 1948&lt;ref&gt;See Jackson (2004:1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Grothendieck attended [[Henri Cartan]]'s Seminar at [[École Normale Supérieure]], but lacked the necessary background to follow the high-powered seminar. On the advice of Cartan and [[André Weil|Weil]], he moved to the [[University of Nancy]] where he wrote his dissertation under [[Laurent Schwartz]] in functional analysis, from 1950 to 1953. At this time he was a leading expert in the theory of [[topological vector space]]s. By 1957, he set this subject aside in order to work in algebraic geometry and [[homological algebra]].

===The IHÉS years===

Installed at the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] (IHÉS), Grothendieck attracted attention by an intense and highly productive activity of seminars (''de facto'' working groups drafting into foundational work some of the ablest French and other mathematicians of the younger generation). Grothendieck himself practically ceased publication of papers through the conventional, [[learned journal]] route. He was, however, able to play a dominant role in mathematics for around a decade, gathering a strong school.

During this time he had officially as students [[Michel Demazure]] (who worked on SGA3, on [[group scheme]]s), [[Luc Illusie]] (cotangent complex), [[Michel Raynaud]], [[Jean-Louis Verdier]] (cofounder of the [[derived category]] theory) and [[Pierre Deligne]]. Collaborators on the SGA projects also included [[Mike Artin]] ([[étale cohomology]]) and [[Nick Katz]] ([[monodromy theory]] and [[Lefschetz pencil]]s). [[Jean Giraud (mathematician)|Jean Giraud]] worked out [[torsor]] theory extensions of [[non-abelian cohomology]]. Many others were involved.

===The 'Golden Age'===
Alexander Grothendieck's work during the `Golden Age' period at [[IHÉS]] established several unifying themes in [[algebraic geometry]], [[number theory]], [[topology]], [[category theory]] and [[complex analysis]]. His first (pre-IHÉS) breakthrough in algebraic geometry was the [[Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]], a far-reaching generalisation of the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]] proved algebraically; in this context he also introduced [[K-theory]]. Then, following the programme he outlined in his talk at the 1958 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], he introduced the theory of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], developing it in detail in his [[Éléments de géométrie algébrique]] (EGA) and providing the new more flexible and general foundations for algebraic geometry that has been adopted in the field since that time. He went on to introduce the [[étale cohomology]] theory of schemes, providing the key tools for proving the [[Weil conjectures]], as well as [[crystalline cohomology]] and algebraic de Rham cohomology to complement it. Closely linked to these cohomology theories, he originated [[topos]] theory as a generalisation of topology (relevant also in [[categorical logic]]). He also provided  an algebraic definition of [[fundamental group]]s of schemes and more generally the main structures of a categorical [[Galois theory]]. As a framework for his coherent duality theory he also introduced [[derived category|derived categories]], which were further developed by Verdier.

The results of work on these and other topics were published in the EGA and in less polished form in the notes of the [[Séminaire de géométrie algébrique]] (SGA) that he directed at IHES.

===Politics and retreat from scientific community===

Grothendieck's political views were radical and pacifist.  Thus he strongly opposed both United States aggression in [[Vietnam]] and Soviet military expansionism.  He gave lectures on [[category theory]] in the forests surrounding [[Hanoi]] while the city was being bombed, to protest against the [[Vietnam War]] (''The Life and Work of Alexander Grothendieck'', ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', vol. 113, no. 9, footnote 6). He retired from scientific life around 1970, after having discovered the partly military funding of [[IHÉS]] (see pp. xii and xiii of SGA1, Springer Lecture Notes 224). He returned to academia a few years later as a professor at the University of [[Montpellier]], where he stayed until his retirement in 1988. His criticisms of the scientific community, and especially of several mathematics circles, are also contained in a letter, written in 1988, in which he states the reasons for his refusal of the [[Crafoord Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060106062005/http://www.math.columbia.edu/~lipyan/CrafoordPrize.pdf Crafoord Prize letter]&lt;/ref&gt; He declined the prize on ethical grounds in an open letter to the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1526781/Mathematics-where-nothing-is-ever-as-simple-as-it-seems.html |work = Daily Telegraph|accessdate=5 July 2009|date=20 August 2006|title = Mathematics, where nothing is ever as simple as it seems |first=Robert|last=Matthews}} {{dead link|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the issue of military funding was perhaps the most obvious explanation for Grothendieck's departure from IHÉS, those who knew him say that the causes of the rupture ran deeper. Pierre Cartier, a ''visiteur de longue durée'' (&quot;long-term guest&quot;) at the IHÉS, wrote a piece about Grothendieck for a special volume published on the occasion of the IHÉS's fortieth anniversary. The ''Grothendieck Festschrift'' was a three-volume collection of research papers to mark his sixtieth birthday (falling in 1988), and published in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;The editors were [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]], [[Luc Illusie]], [[Nick Katz]], [[Gérard Laumon]], [[Yuri Manin]], and [[Ken Ribet]]. A second edition has been printed (2007) by Birkhauser.&lt;/ref&gt;

In it Cartier notes that, as the son of an antimilitary anarchist and one who grew up among the disenfranchised, Grothendieck always had a deep compassion for the poor and the downtrodden. As Cartier puts it, Grothendieck came to find Bures-sur-Yvette &quot;''une cage dorée''&quot; (&quot;a golden cage&quot;). While Grothendieck was at the IHÉS, opposition to the Vietnam War was heating up, and Cartier suggests that this also reinforced Grothendieck's distaste at having become a mandarin of the scientific world. In addition, after several years at the IHÉS Grothendieck seemed to cast about for new intellectual interests. By the late 1960s he had started to become interested in scientific areas outside of mathematics. [[David Ruelle]], a physicist who joined the IHÉS faculty in 1964, said that Grothendieck came to talk to him a few times about physics. (In the 1970s Ruelle and the Dutch mathematician [[Floris Takens]] produced a new model for turbulence, and it was Ruelle who invented the concept of a [[strange attractor]] in a dynamical system.) Biology interested Grothendieck much more than physics, and he organized some seminars on biological topics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/199903/ihes-changes.pdf The IHÉS at Forty] Allyn Jackson, March 1999, Noticed of the AMS pp. 329-337&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the IHÉS, Grothendieck became a temporary professor at [[Collège de France]] for two years. A permanent position became open at the end of his tenure, but the application Grothendieck submitted made it clear that he had no plans to continue his mathematical research. The position was given to [[Jacques Tits]].

He then went to Université de Montpellier, where he became increasingly estranged from the mathematical community. Around this time, he founded a group called Survivre, which was dedicated to antimilitary and ecological issues. His mathematical career, for the most part, ended when he left the IHÉS. In 1984 he wrote a proposal to get a position through the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. The proposal, entitled ''[[Esquisse d'un Programme]]'' (&quot;Program Sketch&quot;) describes new ideas for studying the moduli space of complex curves. Although Grothendieck himself never published his work in this area, the proposal became the inspiration for work by other mathematicians and the source of the theory of [[dessin d'enfant]]s. ''Esquisse d’un Programme''
was published in the two-volume proceedings Geometric Galois Actions (Cambridge University Press, 1997).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Hlf1j2XmXkcC&amp;dq=Geometric+Galois+Actions&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q9iN4QMkYj&amp;sig=fAsvVlPOhN9K9LfjGFJC5zm_IA4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KW-3ScSkHYHIMuDukOEK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Google book link]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manuscripts written in the 1980s===

While not publishing mathematical research in conventional ways during the 1980s, he produced several influential manuscripts with limited distribution, with both mathematical and biographical content. During that period he also released his work on Bertini type theorems contained in EGA 5, published by the [http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/index.php Grothendieck Circle] in 2004.

''La Longue Marche à travers la théorie de Galois'' [''The Long March Through Galois Theory''] is an approximately 1600-page handwritten manuscript produced by Grothendieck during the years 1980–1981, containing many of the ideas leading to the ''[[Esquisse d'un programme]]''&lt;ref name=esquissefr&gt;[http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/esquissefr.pdf ESQUISSE D’UN PROGRAMME par Alexandre Grothendieck]&lt;/ref&gt; (see below, and also a more detailed entry), and in particular studying the [[Teichmüller space|Teichmüller theory]].

In 1983 he wrote a huge extended manuscript (about 600 pages) entitled ''Pursuing Stacks'', stimulated by correspondence with [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronald Brown]], (see also [http://www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown R.Brown] and Tim Porter at [[University of Bangor]] in Wales), and starting with a letter addressed to [[Daniel Quillen]]. This letter and successive  parts were distributed from Bangor (see External Links below): in an informal manner, as a kind of diary, Grothendieck explained and developed his ideas on the relationship between [[algebraic homotopy theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]] and prospects for a noncommutative theory of [[Stack (descent theory)|stacks]].  The manuscript, which is being edited for publication by G. Maltsiniotis, later led to another of his monumental works, ''Les Dérivateurs''.  Written in 1991, this latter opus of about 2000 pages further developed the homotopical ideas begun in ''Pursuing Stacks''.  Much of this work anticipated the subsequent development of the motivic homotopy theory of [[Fabien Morel]] and [[V. Voevodsky]] in the mid 1990s.

His ''Esquisse d'un programme''&lt;ref name=esquissefr /&gt; (1984) is a proposal for a position at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]], which he held from 1984 to his retirement in 1988. Ideas from it have proved influential, and have been developed by others, in particular [[dessin d'enfant|dessins d'enfants]] and a new field emerging as [[anabelian geometry]]. In ''[[La Clef des Songes]]'' he explains how the reality of [[dream]]s convinced him of [[God]]'s existence{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.

The 1000-page autobiographical manuscript ''Récoltes et semailles'' (1986) is now available on the internet in the French original, and an English translation is underway (these parts of Récoltes et semailles have already been translated into Russian] and published in Moscow&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mccme.ru/free-books/grothendieck/RS.html In Russian]&lt;/ref&gt;). Some parts of ''Récoltes et semailles''&lt;ref&gt;[http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/preludio.pdf COSECHAS Y SIEMBRAS: Reflexiones y testimonios sobre un pasado de matem´atico] Preludio&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/carta.pdf COSECHAS Y SIEMBRAS: Reflexiones y testimonios sobre un pasado de matem´atico] Carta&lt;/ref&gt; and the whole ''La Clef des Songes'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/clef1-6.pdf La Clef des Songes]&lt;/ref&gt; have been translated into Spanish.

===Retirement into reclusion===

Grothendieck was co-awarded (but declined) the [[Crafoord Prize]] with [[Pierre Deligne]] in 1988.

In 1991, Grothendieck moved to an address he did not provide to his previous contacts in the mathematical community. He is now said to live in southern France or [[Andorra]] and to be reclusive.

In January 2010, Grothendieck wrote a letter to [[Luc Illusie]]. In this &quot;Déclaration d'intention de non-publication&quot;, he states that essentially all materials that have been published in his absence have been done without his permission. He asks that none of his work should be reproduced in whole or in part, and even further that libraries containing such copies of his work remove them.&lt;ref&gt;http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2010/02/09/grothendiecks-letter&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alcoholics Anonymous''' ('''AA''') is an international [[Social work with groups#Mutual Aid|mutual aid]] movement declaring its &quot;primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety.&quot;  Now claiming more than 2 million members, AA was founded in 1935 by [[Bill W.|Bill Wilson]] and [[Bob Smith (doctor)|Dr. Bob Smith]] (Bill W. and Dr. Bob) in Akron, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aa.org/en_pdfs/smf-92_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mäkelä 1996, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's [[the Twelve Steps|Twelve Step]] program of spiritual and character development. AA's [[Twelve Traditions]] were introduced in 1946 to help AA stay unified and grow. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics and include all who wish to stop drinking. The Traditions also recommend that AA members acting on behalf of the fellowship steer clear of dogma, governing hierarchies and involvement in public issues. Subsequent fellowships such as [[Narcotics Anonymous]] have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;TRADITIONS1949&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The A.A.

AA generally avoids discussing the medical nature of alcoholism, but nonetheless, AA is regarded as a proponent and popularizer of the [[disease theory of alcoholism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TRADITIONS1949&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peele.net/lib/aaabuse.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous page xxx&quot;&gt;''Alcoholics Anonymous'' page xxx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bhrm.org&quot;&gt;http://www.bhrm.org/papers/AAand%20DiseaseConcept.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The American Psychiatric Association has recommended sustained treatment in conjunction with AA's program, or similar community resources, for chronic alcoholics unresponsive to brief treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;APA1980&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Substance Abuse: Position Statement |year=1980 |month=December |publisher=American Psychiatric Association  |last1=Connelly |first1=John C. |last2=Foster |first2=Douglas L. |last3=Miller |first3=Derek |last4=Riordan |first4=Charles |last5=Weisman |first5=Maxwell N. |url=http://www.psych.org/Departments/EDU/Library/APAOfficialDocumentsandRelated/PositionStatements/198005.aspx |accessdate=2010-01-26 |archivedate=2010-01-26 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5n5GzN67j}}&lt;/ref&gt; AA's own data state that 64% drop out of AA in their first year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hindsfoot.org/lorarch.html |title=The 95% First Year Dropout Myth  |author=Archer,Loran |date = July 2007|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MCINTIRE2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=McIntire |first=Don |title=How Well Does A.A.

AA's name derived from its first book, originally titled ''[[The Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous)|Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism]]'', and  informally called &quot;The Big Book.&quot;

==Beginnings==
{{Main| History of Alcoholics Anonymous}}

AA sprang from [[The Oxford Group]], a non-denominational movement modeled after first-century Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cheever, Susan |title=My name is Bill: Bill Wilson: his life and the creation of Alcoholics Anonymous |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |year=2004 |page= 129|isbn=0-7432-0154-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Group members (&quot;Groupers&quot;) were not concerned with  sobriety, but some, such as [[Ebby Thacher]], believed the group was a critical aid in staying sober. Following the Group's evangelical bent, Thacher sought out former drinking buddy Bill Wilson to tell him  was sober because he had &quot;got religion.&quot; Thacher also told Wilson he could get sober too if he set aside his objections to religion and form a personal conception of God, &quot;another power&quot; or &quot;higher power.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pass It On, p 117&quot;&gt;''Pass It On'', p 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter HA, ''Soul Surgery'' p. 44 Oxford: The Oxford Group&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NOTGOOD&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Kurtz, Ernest |title=Not-God: a history of Alcoholics Anonymous |publisher=Hazelden Educational Services |location=Center City, Minn |year=1980 |pages= |isbn=0-89486-065-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeling a &quot;kinship of common suffering&quot;, and struck that Thacher was sober, Wilson attended his first Group gathering, though he was noticeably drunk.  Within days Wilson admitted himself for the fourth time to the [[Charles B. Towns|Charles B.Towns Hospital]] to dry out - but only after stopping on the way to drink four beers - the last amount of alcohol Wilson consumed. Under the care of [[William Duncan Silkworth|Dr. William Duncan Silkworth]] (an early benefactor of A.A.), Wilson's underwent a detox treatment which included the [[deliriant]] Belladonna.&lt;ref&gt;Pittman , Bill &quot;AA the Way it Began&quot;  1988, Glenn Abbey Books&lt;/ref&gt;  At the hospital in a state of despair, Wilson had an ecstatic experience in which he saw a bright flash of light. He profoundly felt it to be God revealing himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOTGOD33&quot;&gt;Kurtz 1991. pp. 18-20&lt;/ref&gt;

After his hospital discharge, Wilson joined and brought other alcoholics to the Oxford Group.  Wilson's ineffective early efforts prompted Dr. Silkworth to suggest that Wilson place less stress on religion and on more on &quot;the science&quot; of treating alcoholism. Wilson's first success came during a business trip to Akron, Ohio, where he was introduced to Dr. Robert Smith, a surgeon and Oxford Group member who was unable to stay sober. After thirty days of working with Wilson, Smith drank his last drink on June 10, 1935, the date marked by AA for its anniversaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOTGOD33&quot;&gt;Kurtz 1991. pp. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NOTGOD16-17&quot;&gt;Kurtz 1991. pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

While Wilson and Smith credited their sustained sobriety to working with alcoholics under the auspices of the Oxford Group, a Group associate pastor sermonized against Wilson and his alcoholic Groupers for forming a &quot;secret, ashamed sub-group&quot; engaged in &quot;divergent works&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOTGOD16-17&quot;/&gt;  By 1937 Wilson separated from the Oxford Group. AA historian Ernest Kurtz explained the split:&lt;ref name=&quot;NOTGOD45-46&quot;&gt;Kurtz 1991. pp. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...more and more, Bill discovered that new adherents could get sober by believing in each other and in the strength of ''this'' group.  Men [no women were members yet] who had proven over and over again, by extremely painful experience, that they could not get sober on their own had somehow become more powerful when two or three of them worked on their common problem. This, then&amp;mdash;whatever it was that occurred among them&amp;mdash;was what they could accept as a power greater than themselves. They did not need the Oxford Group.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1955 Wilson acknowledged AA's debt, saying &quot;The Oxford Groupers had clearly shown us what to do. And just as importantly, we learned from them ''what not to do.''&quot;  Among the Oxford Group practices AA retained were informal gatherings, a &quot;changed-life&quot; developed through &quot;stages&quot;, and working with others for no material gain. AA's analogs for these are meetings, &quot;the steps&quot;, and sponsorship. Anonymity came about as AA wished to avoid the publicity-seeking practices of the Oxford Group and to not promote, Wilson said, &quot;erratic public characters who through broken anonymity might get drunk and destroy confidence in us.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;NOTGOD46-48&quot;&gt;Kurtz 1991. pp. 46-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Big Book, the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions==
In 1937, Wilson and Smith could count 40 alcoholic men they had helped to get sober, and two years later they counted 100 members, including one woman. To promote the fellowship, Wilson and other members wrote the initially-titled book, ''Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism'',&lt;ref&gt;http://gsowatch.aamo.info/1939/uslaw.htm&lt;/ref&gt; from which AA drew its name. Informally known as &quot;The Big Book&quot; (with its first 164 pages virtually unchanged since the 1939 edition), it suggests a twelve-step program in which members admit that they are powerless over alcohol and need help from a &quot;higher power&quot;; seek guidance and strength through prayer and meditation from a god (or [[Higher Power]]) of their own understanding; take a moral inventory with care to include resentments; list and become ready to remove character defects; list and make amends to those harmed, and then try to help other alcoholics recover. The second half of the book, &quot;Personal Stories&quot; (subject to additions, removal and retitling in subsequent editions), is made of AA members' redemptive autobiographical sketches.

In 1941, interviews on American radio and favorable articles in US magazines, including a piece by Jack Alexander in ''The Saturday Evening Post'', led to increased book sales and membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-12_theJackAlexArticle1.pdf |title=Alcoholics Anonymous |date=1 March 1941 |author=Jack Alexander |journal=Saturday Eventing Post |edition=Reprinted in booklet form |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous World Services |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyRPXTQK |isbn=0896381994}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1946, as the growing fellowship quarreled over structure, purpose, and authority, as well as finances and publicity, Wilson began to form and promote what became known as AA's [[Twelve Traditions]], guidelines for an altruistic, unaffiliated, non-coercive, and non-hierarchical structure that limited AA's purpose to only helping alcoholics on a non-professional level while shunning publicity. Eventually he gained formal adoption and inclusion of the Twelve Traditions in all future editions of the Big Book.&lt;ref name=&quot;TRADITIONS1949&quot;/&gt; At the 1955 St. Louis convention in Missouri, Wilson relinquished stewardship of AA to the General Service Conference,&lt;ref&gt;Pass It On 1984, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; as AA grew to millions of members internationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAFACTFILE&quot;/&gt;

==Organization and finances==
{{Main|Twelve Traditions }}

AA says it is &quot;not organized in the formal or political sense&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;AAFACTFILE&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=AA Fact File|url=http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/m-24_aafactfile.pdf |publisher=General Service Office of Alcoholics Anonymous |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bill Wilson called it a &quot;benign anarchy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;AA Comes Of Age, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, Shane Butler reported that AA is an import that “looks like it couldn’t survive as there’s no leadership or top-level telling local [[cumann]]s what to do, but it has worked and proved itself extremely robust.” Butler added that &quot;the AA’s 'inverted pyramid' style of governance has helped it to avoid many of the pitfalls that political and religious institutions have encountered since it was established here in 1946.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Steven | last=Carroll | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Group avoids politics of alcohol - author | date= | publisher=http://www.irishtimes.com/ | url =http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0326/1224267100034.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2010-03-30 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 AA counted 1,867,212 members and 106,202 AA groups worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAFACTFILE&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=AA Fact File|url=http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/m-24_aafactfile.pdf |publisher=General Service Office of Alcoholics Anonymous |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-10-28 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyPPBQuz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Twelve Traditions informally guide how individual AA groups function, and the Twelve Concepts for World Service guide how the organization is structured globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The A.A.

A member who accepts a service position or an organizing role is a &quot;trusted servant&quot; with terms rotating and limited, typically lasting three months to two years and determined by group vote and the nature of the position. Each group is a self-governing entity with AA World Services acting only in an advisory capacity. AA is served entirely by alcoholics, except for seven &quot;nonalcoholic friends of the fellowship&quot; of the 21-member AA Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAFACTFILE&quot;/&gt;

AA groups are self-supporting, relying on voluntary donations from members to cover expenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAFACTFILE&quot;/&gt; AA GSO limits contributions to US$3,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A.A. GSO Guidelines: Finances |url=http://www.aa.org/lang/en/en_pdfs/mg-15_finance.pdf |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyQ0kRis |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous General Service Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above the group level, AA may hire outside professionals for services that require specialized expertise or full-time responsibilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;TRADITIONS1949&quot;/&gt;

AA receives proceeds from books and literature that constitute more than 50% of the income for its General Service Office (GSO).&lt;ref name=GSO2005OPS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aa.org/pics_gen/en_gso07_operresults.jpg |title=GSO 2007 Operating Results |quote=Gross Profit from Literature ~8,6M (57%), Contributions ~$6.5M (43%) |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous General Services Office |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyQeumnF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike individual groups, the GSO is not self-supporting and maintains a small salaried staff. It also maintains service centers which coordinate activities such as printing literature, responding to public inquiries, and organizing conferences. They are funded by local members and responsible to the AA groups they represent. Other International General Service Offices (Australia, Costa Rica, Russia, etc.) are independent of AA World Services in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aa.org/lang/en/aa_international.cfm?origpage=31 |title=Alcoholics Anonymous : International General Service Offices |work=Alcoholics Anonymous website |accessdate=2009-10-08 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyQO0oho}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program==
{{See also|Twelve-step program#The Twelve Steps|l1=Twelve-step program: The Twelve Steps}}

The scope of AA's program is much broader than just abstinence from drinking alcohol.&lt;ref name=&quot;HUMPHREYS1995&quot;/&gt; Its goal is to effect enough change in the alcoholic's thinking &quot;to bring about recovery from alcoholism&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bill W. 2002, Appendix II&lt;/ref&gt; through a spiritual awakening. A spiritual awakening is achieved by following the [[Twelve Steps]],&lt;ref name=&quot;THISISAA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=This is AA |url=http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-1_thisisaa1.pdf |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous Work Services, Inc |year=1984 |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyMzy9h6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sobriety is furthered by volunteering for AA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-15_Q&amp;AonSpon.pdf AA.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and regular AA meeting attendance&lt;ref name=&quot;NEWCOMER&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Newcomer Asks...  |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc |year=1980 |url=http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-24_anewcomerask.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyKg9w25 |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; or contact with AA members.&lt;ref name=&quot;THISISAA&quot;/&gt; Members are encouraged to find an experienced fellow alcoholic, called a sponsor, to help them understand and follow the AA program. The sponsor should preferably have experience of all twelve of the steps, be the same gender as the sponsored person, and refrain from imposing personal views on the sponsored person.&lt;ref&gt;Questions and Answers on Sponsorship 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Helper theory|helper therapy principle]], sponsors in AA benefit as much, if not more, from their relationship than do those they sponsor. Helping behaviors correlate with increased abstinence and lower probabilities of binge drinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZEMORE2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zemore, S. E., Kaskutas, L. A., &amp; Ammon, L. N. |year=2004 |title=In 12-step groups, helping helps the helper |journal=Addiction |volume=99 |issue=8 |month=August |pages=1015–1023 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00782.x |pmid=15265098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AA's program is an inheritor of [[Counter-Enlightenment]] philosophy. AA shares the view that acceptance of one's inherent limitations is critical to finding one's proper place among other humans and God. Such ideas are described as &quot;Counter-Enlightenment&quot; because they are contrary to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s ideal that humans have the capacity to make their lives and societies a heaven on earth using their own power and reason.&lt;ref name=&quot;HUMPHREYS1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Humphreys |first=Keith |title=World Views of Alcoholics Anonymous, Women for Sobriety, and Adult Children of Alcoholics/Al-Anon Mutual Help Groups |journal=Addiction Research &amp; Theory |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=231–243 |doi=10.3109/16066359509005240 |year=1995 |last2=Kaskutas |first2=Lee Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologists David Rudy and Arthur Greil evaluated AA's literature and observed AA meetings for sixteen months. They note that although AA's ideology denies AA is religious in nature, for an AA member to remain sober a high level of commitment is necessary. This commitment is facilitated by a change in the member's [[world view]]. To help members stay sober AA must, they argue, provide an all-encompassing world view while creating and sustaining an atmosphere of transcendence in the organization. To be all-encompassing AA's ideology places an emphasis on tolerance rather than on a narrow religious world view that could make the organization unpalatable to potential members and thereby limit its effectiveness. AA's emphasis on the spiritual nature of its program, however, is necessary to institutionalize a feeling of transcendence. A tension results from the risk that the necessity of transcendence, if taken too literally, would compromise AA's efforts to maintain a broad appeal. As this tension is an integral part of AA, Rudy and Greil argue that AA is best described as a quasi-religious organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;RUDY1989&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rudy |first1=David R. |last2=Greil |first2=Arthur L. |title=Is Alcoholics Anonymous a Religious Organization?: Meditations on Marginality |volume=50 |issue=1 |year=1989 |pages=41–51 |doi=10.2307/3710917 |url=http://jstor.org/stable/3710917 |journal=Sociological Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meetings===
AA meetings are &quot;quasi-ritualized therapeutic sessions run by and for, alcoholics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dimensions of Alcoholics Anonymous: 1935–1965|journal=Substance Use &amp; Misuse |volume=4 |issue=4 |page=509 |year=1969 |doi=10.3109/10826086909062033 |last1=Leach |first1=Barry |last2=Norris |first2=John L. |last3=Dancey |first3=Travis |last4=Bissell |first4=Leclair}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually informal and often feature discussions. Local AA directories list a variety of weekly meetings. Those listed as &quot;closed&quot; are only for those with &quot;a desire to stop drinking&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;TRADITIONS1949&quot;/&gt; while &quot;open&quot; meetings are available to anyone. At speaker meetings one or two members tell their stories, while discussion meetings allocate the most time for general discussion. Some meetings are devoted to studying and discussing the AA literature. Except for men's and women's meetings, most meetings for specific demographics (including newcomers, gays, and young people) do not exclude other alcoholics. While AA has pamphlets that suggest meeting formats,&lt;ref name=&quot;AAGROUP&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The A.A. Group |url=http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-16_theaagroup.pdf |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyO4jmjL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BEGINNERS&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Suggestions For Leading Beginners Meetings |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc |url=http://www.aa.org/en_pdfs/mu-1_begmeetings.pdf |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyOIcOwB}}&lt;/ref&gt; groups have the autonomy to hold and conduct meetings as they wish &quot;except in matters affecting other groups or A.A. as a whole&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TRADITIONS1949&quot;/&gt; Different cultures affect ritual aspects of meetings, but around the world &quot;many particularities of the AA meeting format can be observed at almost any A.A. gathering&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mäkelä 1996, p. 149-150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confidentiality===
&lt;!-- Consider Revising. This source is not of AA World Services. IT is an outside opinion, not factual. --&gt;
Although a statement is sometimes read during meetings saying that what is said there should remain confidential, AA members, unlike lawyers or clergy, are not legally bound to maintain confidentiality.&lt;ref name=&quot;COLEMAN2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Coleman | first = Phyllis | title = Privilege and Confidentiality in 12-Step Self-Help Programs: Believing The Promises Could Be Hazardous to an Addict's Freedom | journal = The Journal of Legal Medicine | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | month = December | year = 2005 | pages = 435–474 | doi = 10.1080/01947640500364713 | issn = 0194-7648 | oclc = 4997813 | pmid = 16303734}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HOFFMAN1994&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Hoffman |first=Jan |publisher=New York Times |date=15 June 1994 |title=Faith in Confidentiality of Therapy Is Shaken |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/15/nyregion/faith-in-confidentiality-of-therapy-is-shaken.html |accessdate=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spirituality ==

The spiritual aspect of Alcoholics Anonymous is identified in the core AA literature to be central for achieving and sustaining sobriety.

Recent research findings suggest that AA leads to better alcohol use outcomes, in part, by enhancing individuals’ spiritual practices and provides support for AA’s own emphasis on increasing spiritual practices to facilitate recovery from alcohol use disorder.  As attendance of AA meetings increase, so do the participants spiritual beliefs, especially in those individuals who had low spirituality at the beginning of the study.

The results indicated that there was a robust association between an increase in attendance to AA meetings with increased spirituality and a decrease in the frequency and intensity of alcohol use over time.  One of the most interesting aspects of the research was that the same amount of recovery was seen in both agnostics and atheists, which indicates that while spirituality is an important mechanism of behavioral change for AA, it is not the only method used.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, John F.  et al   Spirituality in Recovery: A Lagged Mediational Analysis of Alcoholics Anonymous’ Principal Theoretical Mechanism of Behavior Change  Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research Vol. 35, No. 3  March 2011  pp.&amp;nbsp;1–10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease concept of alcoholism==
{{Main|Disease theory of alcoholism}}

More informally than not, AA's membership has helped popularize the disease concept of alcoholism, though AA officially has had no part in the development of such postulates which had appeared as early as the late eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Benjamin|last=Rush|title=Inquiry into the Effects of Ardent Spirits upon the Human Body and Mind|publisher=Bartam|location=Philadelphia|year=1805}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though AA initially avoided the term &quot;disease&quot;, in 1973 conference-approved literature categorically stated that &quot;we had the disease of alcoholism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-3_isaaforyou.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless of official positions, from AA's inception most members have believed alcoholism to be a disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;bhrm.org&quot;/&gt;

Though cautious regarding the medical nature of alcoholism, AA has let others voice opinions. The Big Book states &quot;we are told that alcoholism &quot;is an illness which only a spiritual experience will conquer.&quot; Ernest Kurtz says this is &quot;The closest the book Alcoholics Anonymous comes to a definition of alcoholism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bhrm.org&quot;/&gt;  In his introduction to The Big Book, non-member [[William Duncan Silkworth|Dr. William Silkworth]] suggested that those unable to moderate their drinking have an allergy. However, AA said, &quot;The doctor’s theory that we have an allergy to alcohol interests us. As laymen, our opinion as to its soundness may, of course, mean little.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous page xxx&quot;/&gt; In fact AA later acknowledged that &quot;alcoholism is not a true allergy, the experts now inform us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Living Sober'' p 68&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson explained in 1960 why AA had refrained from using the term &quot;disease&quot;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We AAs have never called alcoholism a disease because, technically speaking, it is not a disease entity. For example, there is no such thing as heart disease. Instead there are many separate heart ailments or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. Therefore, we did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. Hence, we have always called it an illness or a malady — a far safer term for us to use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nccatoday.org/conversation.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Canadian and United States demographics ==
AA's New York General Service Office regularly surveys AA members in North America. Its 2004 survey of over 7,500 members in Canada and the United States concluded that, in North America, AA members who responded to the survey were 65% male and 35% female. Average member sobriety is eight years with 36% sober more than ten years, 14% sober from five to ten years, 24% sober from one to five years, and 26% sober less than one year. Before coming to AA, 64% of members received some type of treatment or counseling, such as medical, psychological, or spiritual. After coming to AA, 65% received outside treatment or counseling, and 84% of those members said that that outside help played an important part in their recovery. The same survey showed that AA received 11% of its membership from court ordered attendance.&lt;ref name=&quot;ogfaaa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Alcoholics Anonymous 2004 Membership Survey |url=http://www.aa.org/en_pdfs/p-48_04survey.pdf |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyIHfv6f |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous World Services' General Service Office |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
{{Main|Effectiveness of Alcoholics Anonymous}}

===Research limitations===
AA tends to polarize observers into believers and non-believers,&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant, 1995, p 255.&lt;/ref&gt; and discussion of AA often creates controversy rather than objective reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant, 1995, p 265.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, a randomized study of AA is difficult: AA members are not randomly selected from the population of chronic alcoholics, with the possible exception of those who are mandated by courts to attend AA meetings; they are instead self-selected.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith 2002, p. 103-117&lt;/ref&gt; There are two opposing types of self-selection bias: (1) drinkers may be motivated to stop drinking before they participate in AA (2) AA may attract the more severe and difficult cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;HUMPHREYS2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Humphreys | first = Keith | journal = Recent Developments in Alcoholism | title = Alcoholics Anonymous and 12-Step Alcoholism Treatment Programs | volume = 16 | publisher = Springer US | doi = 10.1007/b100495 | year = 2002 | pages = 149–164 | pmid = 12638636 | isbn = 978-0-306-47258-9 | last2 = Begleiter | first2 = Henri | last3 = Deitrich | first3 = Richard | last4 = Gallant | first4 = Donald | last5 = Gottheil | first5 = Edward | last6 = Paredes | first6 = Alfonso | last7 = Rothschild | first7 = Marcus | last8 = Theil | first8 = David | last9 = Lagressa | first9 = Dolly}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific control|Controlled experiments]] with AA versus non-AA subjects are also difficult because AA is so easily accessible. Twelve-step groups, like AA, are not conducive to [[Sampling (statistics)#Probability and nonprobability sampling|probability sampling]] of members. Research on AA is therefore susceptible to [[sampling bias]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LEVY1979&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Self-Help Groups for Coping with Crisis |editors=Morton A. Lieberman; Leonard D.

Studies of AA's efficacy have produced inconsistent results.

A [[Cochrane Review]] of eight studies, published between 1967 and 2005, measuring the effectiveness of AA, found  &quot;no experimental studies unequivocally demonstrated the effectiveness of AA&quot; in treating alcoholism, based on a meta-analysis of the results of eight trials involving a total of 3,417 individuals. To determine further the effectiveness of AA, the authors suggested that more studies comparing treatment outcomes with control groups were necessary.&lt;ref name=FERRI2006&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Ferri  | first = MMF  | title = Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programmes for alcohol dependence  | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  | volume = 2006  | issue = 3  | url = http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD005032/frame.html  | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005032.pub2  | year = 2006  | last2 = Amato  | first2 = Laura  | last3 = Davoli  | first3 = Marina  | last4 = Ferri  | first4 = Marica  | pmid = 16856072  | pages = CD005032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survey results ===
{{See also|Effectiveness of Alcoholics Anonymous}}

Every third year since 1968, AA has issued a pamphlet summarizing its latest [[wiktionary:triennial|triennial]] survey of meeting attendants. Additional published comments and analysis for academics and professionals have supplemented the survey results from 1970 through 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCINTIRE2000&quot;/&gt; The 1990 commentary evaluated data of triennial surveys from 1977 through 1989 and found that one quarter (26%) of those who first attend an AA meeting are still attending after one year. Furthermore, nearly one third (31.5%) leave the program after one month, and by the end of the third month, over half (52.6%) leave.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAInternalSurvey&quot;/&gt; After the first year, the rate of attrition slows. Only those in the first year were recorded by month.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAInternalSurvey&quot;/&gt; About 40% of the members sober for less than a year will remain another year. About 80% of those sober less than five years will remain sober and active in the fellowship another year. About 90% of the members sober five years or more will remain sober and active in the fellowship another year. Those who remained sober outside the fellowship could not be calculated using the survey results.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAInternalSurvey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Comments On A.A. Triennial Surveys |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/3264243/Comments-on-AAs-Triennial-Surveys |month=December |year=1990 |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous World Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health-care costs===
As a volunteer-supported program, AA is free of charge. This contrasts with treatments for alcoholism such as inpatient treatment, drug therapy, psychotherapy and cognitive-based therapy. Research has found that institutional use of AA in certain circumstances has reduced health-care expenditures by 45%.&lt;ref name=&quot;HUMPHREYS2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Can encouraging substance abuse patients to participate in self-help groups reduce the demand for continuing outpatient care?

==Relationship with institutions ==
===Prisons===
In the United States and Canada AA meetings are held in hundreds of correctional facilities. The AA General Service Office has published a workbook with detailed recommendations for methods of approaching correctional-facility officials with the intent of developing an in-prison AA program.&lt;ref name=&quot;CORRECTIONS1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Corrections Workbook |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous Word Services, Inc |year=1995 |location=New York, NY |url=http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/m-45i_corrections.pdf |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyFWmoKq}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, AA publishes a variety of pamphlets specifically for the incarcerated alcoholic.&lt;ref name=&quot;CORRECTIONS2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Corrections Catalog |url=http://www.aa.org/subpage.cfm?page=249 |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyFe00Dd |quote=The titles include: ''Carrying the Message into Correctional Facilities, Where Do I Go From Here?, A.A. in Prison: Inmate to Inmate, A.A. in Correctional Facilities, It Sure Beats Sitting in a Cell, Memo to an Inmate Who May be an Alcoholic, A Message to Corrections Administrators''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the AA General Service Office provides a pamphlet with guidelines for members working with incarcerated alcoholics.&lt;ref name=&quot;GUIDELINES&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=AA Guidelines from GSO: Cooperating with Court, DWI and Similar Programs |url=http://www.aa.org/en_pdfs/mg-05_coopwithcourt.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyFnXpLK |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States Court rulings===
United States courts have ruled that inmates, parolees, and probationers cannot be ordered to attend AA. Though AA itself was not deemed a religion, it was ruled that it contained ''enough'' religious components (variously described in ''GRIFFIN v. COUGHLIN'' below as, inter alia, &quot;religion&quot;, &quot;religious activity&quot;, &quot;religious exercise&quot;) to make coerced attendance at AA meetings a violation of the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYCTAP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |Court of Appeals: State of New York |title=IN THE MATTER OF DAVID GRIFFIN, APPELLANT, v.

===American treatment industry===
Although Alcoholics Anonymous does not endorse and is not allied with any outside facility, since 1949 when [[Hazelden]] treatment center was founded by some AA members, alcoholic rehabilitation clinics have frequently incorporated precepts of the AA program into their own treatment programs.&lt;ref&gt;Roberson 1988, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; A reverse influence has also occurred, as AA receives 31% of its membership from treatment center referrals.&lt;ref name = &quot;ogfaaa&quot;/&gt;

=== United Kingdom treatment industry ===
A cross-sectional survey of substance-misuse treatment providers in the West Midlands found fewer than 10% integrated twelve-step methods in their practice and only a third felt their consumers were suited for Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous membership. Less than half were likely to recommend self-help groups to their clients. Providers with nursing qualification were more likely to make such referrals than those without. A statistically significant correlation was found between providers' self-reported level of spirituality and their likelihood of recommending AA or NA.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAY2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |year=2005 |title=United Kingdom substance misuse treatment workers' attitudes toward 12-step self-help groups |journal=Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment |volume=29 |issue=4 |month=December |pages=321–327 |doi=10.1016/j.jsat.2005.08.009 |pmid=16311185 |last1=Day |first1=E |last2=Gaston |first2=RL |last3=Furlong |first3=E |last4=Murali |first4=V |last5=Copello |first5=A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{See also|Twelve-step program#Criticism|l1=Twelve-step program: Criticism}}

===Moderation or abstinence===
:''For more details on this topic, see [[Alcoholism#Management|Alcoholism: Management]]

[[Stanton Peele]] argued that some AA groups apply the [[Disease model of addiction|disease model]] to all problem drinkers, whether or not they are &quot;full-blown&quot; alcoholics.&lt;ref&gt;Peele 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Nancy Shute, Peele has advocated that besides AA, other options should be available to problem drinkers who can manage their drinking with the right treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;SHUTE1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shute | first = Nancy | title = The drinking dilemma: by calling abstinence the only cure, we ensure that the nation's $100 billion alcohol problem won't be solved | journal = [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] | volume = 123 | issue = 9 | month = September | year = 1997 | pages = 54–64 |url=http://silkworth.net/magazine_newspaper/us_news_world_report_sep_8_1997.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Big Book, however, acknowledges &quot;moderate drinkers&quot; and &quot;a certain type of hard drinker&quot; able to stop or moderate their drinking. The Big Book suggests no program for these drinkers, but instead seeks to help drinkers without &quot;power of choice in drink.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Alcoholics Anonymous'' page 20-1,24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural identity===
One review of AA warned of detrimental [[wiktionary:iatrogenic|iatrogenic]] effects of twelve-step philosophy and concluded that AA uses many methods that are also used by cults.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALEXANDER1984&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alexander | first1 = Francesa |first2 = Michele |last2 = Rollins | year = 1985 | title = Alcoholics Anonymous: the unseen cult | journal = California Sociologist | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–48 | issn = 0162-8712 | oclc = 4025459 | location = Los Angeles | publisher =[[California State University]] |url=http://www.silkworth.net/sociology/Soc63OCR.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyBcw4EM |archivedate=2009-12-12 |accessdate=2009-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A subsequent study concluded, however, that AA's program bore little semblance to religious cults because the techniques used appeared beneficial.&lt;ref name=&quot;WRIGHT1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Shared Ideology in Alcoholics Anonymous: A Grounded Theory Approach |doi=10.1080/108107397127806 |year=1997 |last1=Right |first1=Kevin B. W |journal=Journal of Health Communication |volume=2 |page=83 |pmid=10977242 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another difference is that, unlike what happens in cults, AA does not seek to prevent a member leaving or renouncing the movement. Another study found that the AA program's focus on admission of having a problem increases deviant [[Stigma (sociological theory)|stigma]] and strips members of their previous [[cultural identity]], replacing it with the deviant identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;LEVINSON1983&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Levinson | first = D. | year = 1983 | journal = Recent Developments in Alcoholism | title = Current status of the field: An anthropological perspective on the behavior modification treatment of alcoholism | pages = 255–261 | location = New York | publisher = Plenum Press | volume = 1 | editor = Galanter, Marc | issn = 0738-422X | pmid = 6680227}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of group members, however, found they had a [[Biculturalism|bicultural]] identity and saw AA's program as a complement to their other national, ethnic, and religious cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox 1998, p. 109-124&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticisms===
&lt;!-- &quot;Thirteenth Stepping&quot; redirects to this section --&gt;
*&quot;Thirteenth-stepping&quot; is a disparaging euphemism referring to AA members who approach new members for dates or sex. The ''Journal of Addiction Nursing'' reported that 50% of the women that participated in a survey (55 in all) experienced 13-stepping behavior from others.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOGART2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Addictions Nursing: A Journal for the Prevention and Management of Addictions |title='13th-Stepping:' Why Alcoholics Anonymous Is Not Always a Safe Place for Women |last=Bogart |first=Cathy J. |year=2003 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=43–47 |doi=10.1080/10884600305373 |issn=1548-7148 |oclc=34618968 |last2=Bogart |first2=Cathy J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid this type of behavior, AA suggests that typically men be sponsored by men and women be sponsored by women.&lt;ref&gt;Questions and Answers on Sponsorship, page 10. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Arthur H. Cain in  1963 said that AA members rely too heavily on dogmatic slogans and become overly dependent on the group. He also said AA &quot;has turned into a religious movement — and a hindrance to research, psychiatry, and to many alcoholics who need a different kind of help.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN1963&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cain |first=Arthur H. |url=http://www.legacyaa.com/articles/cult_or-cure.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030901062932/http://www.legacyaa.com/articles/cult_or-cure.htm |archivedate=2003-09-01 |title=Alcoholics Anonymous: Cult or Cure? |publisher=Harper's Magazine |month=February |year=1963 |issn=0017-789X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hue alpha.png|thumb|This image's alpha channel falls off to zero at its base. A checkered backdrop is often used to signal transparency.]]

In [[computer graphics]], '''alpha compositing''' is the process of combining an image with a background to create the appearance of partial transparency. It is often useful to render image elements in separate passes, and then combine the resulting multiple 2D images into a single, final image in a process called compositing. For example, compositing is used extensively when combining computer rendered image elements with live footage.

In order to combine these image elements correctly, it is necessary to keep an associated ''[[matte (filmmaking)|matte]]'' for each element. This matte contains the coverage information—the shape of the geometry being drawn—making it possible to distinguish between parts of the image where the geometry was actually drawn and other parts of the image which are empty.

==Description==
To store matte information, the concept of an '''alpha channel''' was introduced by [[Alvy Ray Smith]] in the late 1970s, and fully developed in a 1984 paper by [[Thomas Porter (Pixar)|Thomas Porter]] and [[Tom Duff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Porter|first=Thomas|coauthors=Tom Duff|year=1984|title=Compositing Digital Images|journal=Computer Graphics|volume=18|issue=3|pages=253–259|doi=10.1145/800031.808606}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2D image element which stores a color for each pixel, additional data is stored in the alpha channel with a value between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means that the pixel does not have any coverage information and is transparent; i.e. there was no color contribution from any geometry because the geometry did not overlap this pixel. A value of 1 means that the pixel is opaque because the geometry completely overlapped the pixel.

If an alpha channel is used in an image, it is common to also multiply the color by the alpha value, to save on additional multiplications during compositing. This is usually referred to as ''premultiplied alpha''. Thus, assuming that the pixel color is expressed using RGBA tuples, a pixel value of (0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5) implies a pixel which is half green and has 50% coverage. (Explanation: The [[RGB color space|RGB]] values are the first three values, (0, 0.5, 0) and the alpha value is the fourth, 0.5. If the color were fully green, its RGB would be (0, 1, 0). Since this pixel is using a premultiplied alpha, all of the RGB values in the ordered triplet (0, 1, 0) are multiplied by 0.5 and then the alpha is added to the end to yield (0, 0.5, 0, 0.5).) Premultiplied alpha also has some advantages over normal alpha blending because premultiplied alpha blending is [[Associativity|associative]] and [[linear interpolation]] gives better results.

With the existence of an alpha channel, it is possible to express compositing image operations, using a ''compositing algebra''. For example, given two image elements A and B, the most common compositing operation is to combine the images such that A appears in the foreground and B appears in the background. This can be expressed as A '''over''' B. In addition to '''over''', Porter and Duff defined the compositing operators '''in''', '''held out by''' (usually abbreviated '''out'''), '''atop''', and '''xor''' (and the reverse operators '''rover''', '''rin''', '''rout''', and '''ratop''') from a consideration of choices in blending the colors of two pixels when their coverage is, conceptually, overlaid orthogonally:

[[Image:Alpha compositing.svg]]

The '''over''' operator is, in effect, the normal painting operation (see [[Painter's algorithm]]). The '''in''' operator is the alpha compositing equivalent of [[Clipping (computer graphics)|clipping]].

As an example, the '''over''' operator can be accomplished by applying the following formula to each pixel value:

:&lt;math&gt;C_o = C_a \alpha_a + C_b \alpha_b \left(1 - \alpha_a\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_o&lt;/math&gt; is the result of the operation, &lt;math&gt;C_a&lt;/math&gt; is the color of the pixel in element A, &lt;math&gt;C_b&lt;/math&gt; is the color of the pixel in element B, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_b&lt;/math&gt; are the alpha of the pixels in elements A and B respectively.  If it is assumed that all color values are premultiplied by their alpha values (&lt;math&gt;c_i = \alpha_i C_i&lt;/math&gt;), we can rewrite this as:

:&lt;math&gt;C_o = c_a + \left(1 - \alpha_a\right) c_b&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_o = c_o/C_o = \alpha_a + \alpha_b \left(1 - \alpha_a\right)&lt;/math&gt;

However, this operation may not be appropriate for all applications, since it is not [[associative]].
The associative version of this operation is very similar; simply take the newly computed color value and divide it by its new alpha value, as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;C_o = \frac{C_a \alpha_a + C_b \alpha_b \left(1 - \alpha_a\right)}{\alpha_o}&lt;/math&gt;

Image editing applications that allow merging of layers generally prefer this second approach.

==Analytical derivation of the over operator==

Porter and Duff gave a geometric interpretation of the alpha compositing formula by studying orthogonal coverages. Another derivation of the formula, based on a physical [[reflectance]]/[[transmittance]] model, can be found in a 1981 paper by [[Bruce A. Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Bruce|year=1981|title=Merging and transformation of raster images for cartoon animation|journal=SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics|volume=15|issue=3|pages=253–262|doi=10.1145/800224.806813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third approach is found by starting out with two very simple assumptions. For simplicity, we shall here use the shorthand notation &lt;math&gt;a \odot b&lt;/math&gt; for representing the '''over''' operator.

The first assumption is that in the case where the background is opaque (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\alpha_b = 1&lt;/math&gt;), the over operator represents the [[convex combination]] of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;C_o = \alpha_a C_a + (1 - \alpha_a) C_b&lt;/math&gt;

The second assumption is that the operator must respect the associative rule:

:&lt;math&gt;(a \odot b) \odot c = a \odot (b \odot c)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, let us assume that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; have variable transparencies, whereas &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is opaque. We're interested in finding

:&lt;math&gt;o = a \odot b&lt;/math&gt;.

We know from the associative rule that the following must be true:

:&lt;math&gt;o \odot c = a \odot (b \odot c)&lt;/math&gt;

We know that &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is opaque and thus follows that &lt;math&gt;b \odot c&lt;/math&gt; is opaque, so in the above equation, each &lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt; operator can be written as a convex combination:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  \alpha_o C_o + (1 - \alpha_o) C_c &amp;= \alpha_a C_a + (1 - \alpha_a) (\alpha_b C_b + (1 - \alpha_b) C_c) \\
  &amp;= \alpha_a C_a + (1 - \alpha_a) \alpha_b C_b + (1 - \alpha_a) (1 - \alpha_b) C_c
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence we see that this represents an equation of the form &lt;math&gt;X_0 + Y_0 C_c = X_1 + Y_1 C_c&lt;/math&gt;. By setting &lt;math&gt;X_0 = X_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_0 = Y_1&lt;/math&gt; we get

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  \alpha_o &amp;= 1 - (1 - \alpha_a) (1 - \alpha_b),\\
  C_o &amp;= \frac{\alpha_a C_a + (1 - \alpha_a)\alpha_b C_b}{\alpha_o},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
which means that we have analytically derived a formula for the output alpha and the output color of &lt;math&gt;a \odot b&lt;/math&gt;.

An even more compact representation is given by noticing that &lt;math&gt;(1 - \alpha_a)\alpha_b = \alpha_o - \alpha_a&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
  C_o = \frac{\alpha_a}{\alpha_o} C_a + \left(1 - \frac{\alpha_a}{\alpha_o}\right) C_b
&lt;/math&gt;

It is also interesting to note that the &lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt; operator fulfills all the requirements of a [[non-commutative]] [[monoid]], where the [[identity]]{{dn}} element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is chosen such that &lt;math&gt;e \odot a = a \odot e = a&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the identity element can be any tuple &lt;math&gt;\langle C,\alpha\rangle&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 0&lt;/math&gt;.)

==Alpha blending==
Alpha blending is a [[convex combination]] of two [[color]]s allowing for [[Transparency (graphic)|transparency]] effects in [[computer graphic]]s. The value of &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; in the color code ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 represents a fully transparent color, and 1.0 represents a fully opaque color. This corresponds to &quot;SRC over DST&quot; in Porter and Duff equations.

The value of the resulting color is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
out_A = src_A + dst_A (1 - src_A) \\
out_{RGB} = \bigl( src_{RGB} src_A + dst_{RGB} dst_A \left( 1 - src_A \right) \bigr) \div out_A \\
out_A = 0 \Rightarrow out_{RGB} = 0
\end{array}
\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

If the destination background is opaque, then &lt;math&gt;dst_a = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and if you enter it to the upper equation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
out_A = 1 \\
out_{RGB} = src_{RGB} src_A + dst_{RGB} (1 - src_A)
\end{array}
\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

The alpha component may be used to blend to [[red]], [[green]] and [[blue]] components equally, as in [[32-bit]] [[RGBA color space|RGBA]], or, alternatively, there may be three alpha values specified corresponding to each of the [[primary color]]s for [[spectral color]] [[filter (optics)|filtering]].

Note that the RGB color may be premultiplied, hence saving the additional multiplication before RGB in the equation above. This can be a considerable saving in processing time given that images are often made up of millions of pixels.

==Other transparency methods==

Although used for similar purposes, [[Palette (computing)#Transparent color in palettes|transparent color]]s and [[Mask (computing)#Image masks|image mask]]s do not permit the smooth blending of the superimposed image pixels with those of the background (only whole image pixels or whole background pixels allowed).

A similar effect can be achieved with a 1-bit alpha channel, as found in the 16-bit RGBA [[Highcolor]] mode of the [[Truevision TGA]] [[image file format]] and related [[TARGA]] and [[AT-Vista]]/[[NU-Vista]] display adapters' Highcolor graphic mode. This mode devotes 5 bits for every primary RGB color ([[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#15-bit RGB|15-bit RGB]]) plus a remaining bit as the &quot;alpha channel&quot;.

For some applications, a single alpha channel is not sufficient: a stained-glass window, for instance, requires{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} a separate transparency channel for each RGB channel to model the red transparency, green transparency, and blue transparency.  More alpha channels can be added for accurate spectral color filtration applications.

==Applications==

Alpha blending is used in a variety of applications. It is natively supported by most operating systems/GUIs for drawing windows (where applicable) or widgets:

* [[AmigaOS 4.1]]
* [[Android (operating system)|Android]]
* [[BeOS]], [[magnussoft ZETA]], [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]]
* [[Inferno (operating system)|Inferno]]
* [[Mac OS X]], [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]]
* [[MorphOS]]
* [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]]
* [[QNX]] Neutrino
* [[RISC OS#RISC OS Select and Adjust|RISC OS Adjust]]
* [[Syllable (operating system)|Syllable]]
* [[webOS]]
* [[Windows 2000]] or later, [[Windows CE|CE]], [[Windows Mobile|Mobile]]
* The [[XRender]] extension to the [[X Window System]] (this includes modern [[UNIX]] and [[Linux]] systems)

Other software may use alpha blended transparent elements in the GUI independently of OS provided APIs by precomposing elements in an off-screen memory buffer before displaying them.  (Such as when displaying partially transparent composited elements in an embedded system which provides only a simple frame buffer.) [[Compositing software]] is used to combine images, and makes extensive use of alpha compositing techniques.

In [[computer science]], an '''array data structure''' or simply '''array''' is a [[data structure]] consisting of a collection of elements ([[value (computer science)|values]] or [[variable (programming)|variables]]), each identified by at least one [[index (information technology)|index]]. An array is stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index [[tuple]] by a mathematical formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/array.html|title=array|last=Black|first=Paul E.|date=13 November 2008|work=[[Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures]]|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;andres&quot;&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1008.2909 |author1=Bjoern Andres |author2=Ullrich Koethe |author3=Thorben Kroeger |author4=Hamprecht |title=Runtime-Flexible Multi-dimensional Arrays and Views for C++98 and C++0x |class=cs.DS |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;garcia&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Garcia|first1=Ronald |first2=Andrew |last2=Lumsdaine|year=2005|title=MultiArray: a C++ library for generic programming with arrays|journal=Software: Practice and Experience|volume=35|issue=2|pages=159–188|issn=0038-0644|doi=10.1002/spe.630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, an array of 10 integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as 10 [[Word (data type)|words]] at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, … 2036, so that the element with index ''i'' has the address 2000 + 4 × ''i''.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Richardson (2002), The Book on Data Structures. iUniverse, 112 pages. ISBN 0-595-24039-9, 9780595240395.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrays are analogous to the mathematical concepts of the [[vector space|vector]], the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], and the [[tensor]].  Indeed, arrays with one or two indices are often called vectors or matrices, respectively.  Arrays are often used to implement [[table (information)|table]]s, especially [[lookup table]]s; the word ''table'' is sometimes used as a synonym of ''array''.

Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program and are used to implement many other data structures, such as [[list (computing)|list]]s and [[string (computer science)|string]]s.  They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many [[external storage]] devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses.  [[Central processing unit|Processors]], especially [[vector processor]]s, are often optimized for array operations.

Arrays are useful mostly because the element indices can be computed at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]].  Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative [[statement (programming)|statement]] to process arbitrarily many elements of an array.  For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually,&lt;ref name=&quot;garcia&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;veldhuizen&quot;&gt;T. Veldhuizen. Arrays in Blitz++. In Proc. of the 2nd Int. Conf. on Scientific Computing in Object-Oriented Parallel Environments (ISCOPE), LNCS 1505, pages 223-220. Springer, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; but not always,&lt;ref name=&quot;andres&quot; /&gt; fixed while the array is in use.

The terms ''array'' are often used to mean [[array data type]], a kind of [[data type]] provided by most [[high-level programming language]]s that consists of a collection of values or variables that can be selected by one or more indices computed at run-time.  Array types are often implemented by array structures; however, in some languages they may be implemented by [[hash table]]s, [[linked list]]s, [[search tree]]s, or other data structures.

The terms are also used, especially in the description of [[algorithm]]s, to mean [[associative array]] or &quot;abstract array&quot;, a [[theoretical computer science]] model (an [[abstract data type]] or ADT) intended to capture the essential properties of arrays.

==History==
Array structures were used in the first digital computers, when programming was still done in machine language, for data tables, vector and matrix computations, and many other purposes. [[John von Neumann|Von Neumann]] wrote the first array sorting program ([[merge sort]]) in 1945, when the [[EDVAC|first stored-program computer]] was still being built.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Knuth, ''The Art of Computer Programming'', vol. 3. Addison-Wesley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;159&lt;/sup&gt;  Array indexing was originally done by [[self-modifying code]], and later using [[index register]]s and [[Addressing mode|indirect addressing]].  Some mainframes designed in the 1960s, such as the [[Burroughs large systems|Burroughs B5000]] and its successors, had special instructions for array indexing that included index bounds checking.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.

Assembly languages generally have no special support for arrays, other than what the machine itself provides. The earliest high-level programming languages, including [[Fortran|FORTRAN]] (1957), [[COBOL]] (1960), and [[ALGOL|ALGOL 60]] (1960), had support for multi-dimensional arrays, and so has [[C (programming language)|C]] (1972). In [[C++]] (1983), class templates exist for multi-dimensional arrays whose dimension is fixed at runtime&lt;ref name=&quot;garcia&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;veldhuizen&quot; /&gt; as well as for runtime-flexible arrays.&lt;ref name=&quot;andres&quot; /&gt;

==Applications==
Arrays are used to implement mathematical [[coordinate vector|vectors]] and [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], as well as other kinds of rectangular tables.  Many [[database]]s, small and large, consist of (or include) one-dimensional arrays whose elements are [[record (computer science)|record]]s.

Arrays are used to implement other data structures, such as [[heap (data structure)|heaps]], [[hash table]]s, [[double-ended queue|deque]]s, [[queue (data structure)|queue]]s, [[stack (data structure)|stacks]], [[String (computer science)|strings]], and [[VList]]s.

One or more large arrays are sometimes used to emulate in-program [[dynamic memory allocation]], particularly [[memory pool]] allocation. Historically, this has sometimes been the only way to allocate &quot;dynamic memory&quot; portably.

Arrays can be used to determine partial or complete [[control flow]] in programs, as a compact alternative to (otherwise repetitive), multiple &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt; statements. They are known in this context as [[control table]]s and are used in conjunction with a purpose built interpreter whose [[control flow]] is altered according to values contained in the array. The array may contain [[subroutine]] [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]]s (or relative subroutine numbers that can be acted upon by [[Switch statement|SWITCH]] statements) - that direct the path of the execution.

==Addressing formulas==
The number of indices needed to specify an element is called the dimension, dimensionality, or [[rank (computer programming)|rank]] of the array.

In standard arrays, each index is restricted to a certain range of consecutive integers (or consecutive values of some [[enumerated type]]), and the address of an element is computed by a &quot;linear&quot; formula on the indices.

===One-dimensional arrays===
A one-dimensional array (or single dimension array) is a type of linear array. Accessing its elements involves a single subscript which can either represent a row or column index.

As an example consider the C declaration &lt;code&gt;auto int new[10];&lt;/code&gt;

In the given example the array starts with auto storage class and is of integer type named new which can contain 10 elements in it i.e. 0-9.
It is not necessary to declare the storage class as the compiler initializes auto storage class by default to every data type
After that the data type is declared which is followed by the name i.e. new which can contain 10 entities.

For a vector with linear addressing, the element with index ''i'' is located at the address ''B'' + ''c'' · ''i'', where ''B'' is a fixed ''base address'' and ''c'' a fixed constant, sometimes called the  ''address increment'' or ''stride''.

If the valid element indices begin at 0, the constant ''B'' is simply the address of the first element of the array. For this reason, the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] specifies that array indices always begin at 0; and many programmers will call that element &quot;[[zeroth]]&quot; rather than &quot;first&quot;.

However, one can choose the index of the first element by an appropriate choice of the base address ''B''.  For example, if the array has five elements, indexed 1 through 5, and the base address ''B'' is replaced by ''B'' &amp;minus; 30''c'', then the indices of those same elements will be 31 to 35.  If the numbering does not start at 0, the constant ''B'' may not be the address of any element.

===Two-dimensional arrays===
For a two-dimensional array, the element with indices ''i'',''j'' would have address ''B'' + ''c'' · ''i'' + ''d'' · ''j'', where the coefficients ''c'' and ''d'' are the ''row'' and ''column address increments'', respectively.

More generally, in a ''k''-dimensional array, the address of an element with indices ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is
:''B'' + ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; · ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; · ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + … + ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; · ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.

This formula requires only ''k'' multiplications and ''k''&amp;minus;1 additions, for any array that can fit in memory. Moreover, if any coefficient is a fixed power of 2, the multiplication can be replaced by [[bitwise operation|bit shifting]].

The coefficients ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; must be chosen so that every valid index tuple maps to the address of a distinct element.

If the minimum legal value for every index is 0, then ''B'' is the address of the element whose indices are all zero.  As in the one-dimensional case, the element indices may be changed by changing the base address ''B''.  Thus, if a two-dimensional array has rows and columns indexed from 1 to 10 and 1 to 20, respectively, then replacing  ''B'' by ''B'' + ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - &amp;minus; 3 ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; will cause them to be renumbered from 0 through 9 and 4 through 23, respectively.  Taking advantage of this feature, some languages (like FORTRAN 77) specify that array indices begin at 1, as in mathematical tradition; while other languages (like Fortran 90, Pascal and Algol) let the user choose the minimum value for each index.

===Dope vectors===
The addressing formula is completely defined by the dimension ''d'', the base address ''B'', and the increments ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is often  useful to pack these parameters into a record called the array's ''descriptor'' or ''stride vector'' or ''[[dope vector]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;andres&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;garcia&quot; /&gt;  The size of each element, and the minimum and maximum values allowed for each index may also be included in the dope vector.  The dope vector is a complete [[handle (computing)|handle]] for the array, and is a convenient way to pass arrays as arguments to [[subroutine|procedures]].  Many useful [[array slicing]] operations (such as selecting a sub-array, swapping indices, or reversing the direction of the indices) can be performed very efficiently by manipulating the dope vector.&lt;ref name=&quot;andres&quot; /&gt;

===Compact layouts===
Often the coefficients are chosen so that the elements occupy a contiguous area of memory.  However, that is not necessary.  Even if arrays are always created with contiguous elements, some array slicing operations may create non-contiguous sub-arrays from them.

There are two systematic compact layouts for a two-dimensional array.  For example, consider the matrix
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\
7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
In the [[row-major order]] layout (adopted by C for statically declared arrays), the elements of each row are stored in consecutive positions:
{| border=1
|-
| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9
|}
In [[Row-major order|Column-major order]] (traditionally used by Fortran), the elements of each column are consecutive in memory:
{| border=1
|-
| 1 || 4 || 7 || 2 || 5 || 8 || 3 || 6 || 9
|}
For arrays with three or more indices, &quot;row major order&quot; puts in consecutive positions any two elements whose index tuples differ only by one in the ''last'' index.  &quot;Column major order&quot; is analogous with respect to the ''first'' index.

In systems which use [[processor cache]] or [[virtual memory]], scanning an array is much faster if successive elements are stored in consecutive positions in memory, rather than sparsely scattered.  Many algorithms that use multidimensional arrays will scan them in a predictable order. A programmer (or a sophisticated compiler) may use this information to choose between row- or column-major layout for each array.  For example,  when computing the product ''A''·''B'' of two matrices, it would be best to have ''A'' stored in row-major order, and  ''B'' in column-major order.

===Array resizing===
{{Main|Dynamic array}}

Static arrays have a size that is fixed at allocation time and consequently do not allow elements to be inserted or removed. However, by allocating a new array and copying the contents of the old array to it, it is possible to effectively implement a ''dynamic'' or ''growable'' version of an array; see [[dynamic array]]. If this operation is done infrequently, insertions at the end of the array require only amortized constant time.

Some array data structures do not reallocate storage, but do store a count of the number of elements of the array in use, called the count or size. This effectively makes the array a [[dynamic array]] with a fixed maximum size or capacity; ''[[String (computer science)#Representations|Pascal strings]]'' are examples of this.

===Non-linear formulas===
More complicated (non-linear) formulas are occasionally used. For a compact two-dimensional [[triangular array]], for instance, the addressing formula is a polynomial of degree 2.

==Efficiency==
Both ''store'' and ''select'' take (deterministic worst case) [[constant time]]. Arrays take linear ([[Big-O notation|O]](''n'')) space in the number of elements ''n'' that they hold.

In an array with element size ''k'' and on a machine with a cache line size of B bytes, iterating through an array of ''n'' elements requires the minimum of ceiling(''nk''/B) cache misses, because its elements occupy contiguous memory locations. This is roughly a factor of B/''k'' better than the number of cache misses needed to access ''n'' elements at random memory locations. As a consequence, sequential iteration over an array is noticeably faster in practice than iteration over many other data structures, a property called [[locality of reference]] (this does ''not'' mean however, that using a [[Perfect hash function|perfect hash]] or [[hash function#Trivial hash function|trivial hash]] within the same (local) array, will not be even faster - and achievable in [[constant time]]). Libraries provide low-level optimized facilities for copying ranges of memory (such as [[String.h|memcpy]]) which can be used to move [[contiguous]] blocks of array elements significantly faster than can be achieved through individual element access. The speedup of such optimized routines varies by array element size, architecture, and implementation.

Memory-wise, arrays are compact data structures with no per-element [[Computational overhead|overhead]]. There may be a per-array overhead, e.g. to store index bounds, but this is language-dependent. It can also happen that elements stored in an array require ''less'' memory than the same elements stored in individual variables, because several array elements can be stored in a single [[Word (data type)|word]]; such arrays are often called ''packed'' arrays. An extreme (but commonly used) case is the [[bit array]], where every bit represents a single element. A single [[octet]] can thus hold up to 256 different combinations of up to 8 different conditions, in the most compact form.

Array accesses with statically predictable access patterns are a major source of [[data parallelism]].

&lt;/div&gt;
[[Dynamic array|Growable array]]s are similar to arrays but add the ability to insert and delete elements; adding and deleting at the end is particularly efficient. However, they reserve linear ([[Big-O_notation#Family_of_Bachmann.E2.80.93Landau_notations|Θ]](''n'')) additional storage, whereas arrays do not reserve additional storage.

[[Associative array]]s provide a mechanism for array-like functionality without huge storage overheads when the index values are sparse. For example, an array that contains values only at indexes 1 and 2 billion may benefit from using such a structure. Specialized associative arrays with integer keys include [[Radix tree|Patricia trie]]s, [[Judy array]]s, and [[van Emde Boas tree]]s.

[[Self-balancing binary search tree|Balanced trees]] require O(log ''n'') time for indexed access, but also permit inserting or deleting elements in O(log ''n'') time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/algorithms/cbtree.html Counted B-Tree]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas growable arrays require linear (Θ(''n'')) time to insert or delete elements at an arbitrary position.

[[Linked list]]s allow constant time removal and insertion in the middle but take linear time for indexed access. Their memory use is typically worse than arrays, but is still linear.

[[Image:Array of array storage.svg|120px|left|A two-dimensional array stored as a one-dimensional array of one-dimensional arrays (rows).]]
An [[Iliffe vector]] is an alternative to a multidimensional array structure. It uses a one-dimensional array of [[reference (computer science)|references]] to arrays of one dimension less. For two dimensions, in particular, this alternative structure would be a vector of pointers to vectors, one for each row.  Thus an element in row ''i'' and column ''j'' of an array ''A'' would be accessed by double indexing (''A''[''i''][''j''] in typical notation).  This alternative structure allows ''ragged'' or ''jagged'' arrays, where each row may have a different size — or, in general, where the valid range of each index depends on the values of all preceding indices.  It also saves one multiplication (by the column address increment) replacing it by a bit shift (to index the vector of row pointers) and one extra memory access (fetching the row address), which may be worthwhile in some architectures.

==Meaning of dimension==
The dimension of an array is the number of indices needed to select an element. Thus, if the array is seen as a function on a set of possible index combinations, it is the dimension of the space of which its domain is a discrete subset. Thus a one-dimensional array is a list of data, a two-dimensional array a rectangle of data, a three-dimensional array a block of data, etc.

This should not be confused with the dimension of the set of all matrices with a given domain, that is, the number of elements in the array. For example, an array with 5 rows and 4 columns is two-dimensional, but such matrices form a 20-dimensional space. Similarly, a three-dimensional vector can be represented by a one-dimensional array of size three.

&quot;'''Advance Australia Fair'''&quot; is the official [[national anthem]] of [[Australia]]. Created by the Scottish-born composer, [[Peter Dodds McCormick]], the song was first performed in 1878, but did not gain its status as the official anthem until 1984. Until then, the song was sung in Australia as a patriotic song. In order for the song to become the anthem, it had to face a vote between the Royal anthem ''[[God Save the Queen]]'', the &quot;unofficial anthem&quot; ''[[Waltzing Matilda]]'' and ''[[Song of Australia]]''. Other songs and marches have been influenced from ''Advance Australia Fair,'' such as the Australian Vice-Regal salute.

The earliest surviving recording of ''Advance Australia Fair'' features on the reenactment of &quot;The Landing of the Australian Troops in Egypt&quot; circa 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/historical/landing-of-australian-troops/clip1/ National Film and Sound Archive: The Landing of the Australian Troops in Egypt on australianscreen online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origin of ''Advance Australia Fair''===
The original song ''Advance Australia Fair'' was composed by [[Peter Dodds McCormick]] under the pen-name 'Amicus' (which means 'friend' in Latin), in the late 19th century, and first performed by [[Andrew Fairfax]] at a [[Highland Society (Australia)|Highland Society]] function in Sydney on 30 November 1878.  The song quickly gained popularity and an amended version was sung by a choir of 10,000 at the inauguration of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1901. In 1907 the Australian Government awarded McCormick £100 for his composition.

In a letter to R. B. Fuller Esq., dated 1 August 1913, McCormick described the circumstances that inspired him to write Advance Australia Fair:

{{quote|One night I attended a great concert in the Exhibition Building, when all the National Anthems of the world were to be sung by a large choir with band accompaniment. This was very nicely done, but I felt very aggravated that there was not one note for Australia. On the way home in a bus, I concocted the first verse of my song &amp; when I got home I set it to music. I first wrote it in the Tonic Sol-fa notation, then transcribed it into the Old Notation, &amp; I tried it over on an instrument next morning, &amp; found it correct. Strange to say there has not been a note of it altered since. Some alteration has been made in the wording, but the sense is the same. It seemed to me to be like an inspiration, &amp; I wrote the words &amp; music with the greatest ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an000008257145|title=Letters [manuscript]|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]|accessdate=26 October 2008}} Letter to R.B. Fuller Esq. dated 1 August 1913&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Before its adoption as Australia's national anthem, ''Advance Australia Fair'' saw considerable use elsewhere. For example, Australia's national broadcaster, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Commission]], used it to announce its news bulletins until 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screensound.gov.au/services/soa-media/index.html|title=Media Resources – Images and Audio files for Download|publisher=[[National Film and Sound Archive]]|accessdate=1 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071018045853/http://screensound.gov.au/services/soa-media/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 18 October 2007}} (1943 – The Majestic Fanfare by Charles Williams, the ABC radio news theme)&lt;/ref&gt; It was also frequently played at the start or end of official functions. Towards the end of [[World War II]], it was played in picture theatres after &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; and the American national anthem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/17882691 &quot;Song and Two Anthems&quot; ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 30 November 1943 p.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competitions, plebiscite and adoption===
In 1951 there was a competition for a new national anthem to celebrate the golden jubilee of the [[Federation of Australia]].  The entry by the Austrian-born conductor [[Henry Krips (conductor)|Henry Krips]], ''This Land of Mine'', won the competition, but it was decided to make no change to the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/aaf/aaf_fact_17.html Lachlan Cranswick's Personal Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until 1974 ''[[God Save the Queen]]'' was Australia's national anthem. In 1973 the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] government decided that the country needed an anthem that could represent Australia with &quot;distinction&quot; and started a competition to find one. The [[Australia Council for the Arts]] organised the contest, which was dubbed the ''Australian National Anthem Quest''. The contest was held in two stages, the first seeking lyrics and the second music, each having an [[Australian dollar|A$]]5,000 prize for the winning entry. On the recommendation of the Council for the Arts, none of the new entries were felt worthy enough, so the contest ended with the suggestions for ''Advance Australia Fair'', ''[[Waltzing Matilda]]'' and ''[[Song of Australia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/symbols/anthem.cfm#history|title=Australian National Anthem – History|publisher=Australian Government|date=10 July 2007|accessdate=1 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 the Whitlam government then performed a nationwide opinion survey to determine the song to be sung on occasions of national significance. Conducted through the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], it polled 60,000 people nationally. ''Advance Australia Fair'' was chosen and was enshrined as the national song, to be used on all occasions excepting those of a specifically regal nature. A spokesman for the Prime Minister Gough Whitlam stated that the Government regarded the tune primarily as the national anthem.

In January 1976 the [[Malcolm Fraser|Fraser]] government reinstated ''God Save the Queen'' for royal, vice-regal, defence, and loyal toast occasions, and made plans to conduct a national poll to find a song for use on ceremonial occasions when it was desired to mark a separate Australian identity. This was conducted as a [[Australian plebiscite, 1977 (National Song)|plebiscite to choose the National Song]], held as an optional additional question in the [[Australian referendum, 1977|1977 referendum]] on various issues. ''Advance Australia Fair'' received 43.29% of the vote, defeating the three alternatives: ''[[Waltzing Matilda]]'' (28.28%), ''[[Song of Australia]]'' (9.65%), and the existing national anthem ''[[God Save the Queen]]'' (18.78%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/elect/referend/pleb.htm|title=Plebiscite results: National Song Poll|publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]]|date=30 June 2002|accessdate=13 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080205110200/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/elect/referend/pleb.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 5 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Advance Australia Fair'', with modified lyrics from the original (See [[#Development of lyrics]]), was adopted as the Australian national anthem on 19 April 1984 by a proclamation by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] [[Ninian Stephen|Sir Ninian Stephen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/handbook/national_symbols/index.htm|title=Parliamentary Handbook of the Commonwealth of Australia – National Symbols|publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]]|date=21 September 2005|accessdate=1 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070830052800/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/handbook/national_symbols/index.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 30 August 2007}} (proclamation by Governor General dated 19 April 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; on a recommendation by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government of [[Bob Hawke]].

==Orchestral version==
The wordless orchestral version of ''Advance Australia Fair'' that is now regularly played for Australian victories at international sporting medal ceremonies, and at the openings of major domestic sporting, cultural and community events, is by [[Tommy Tycho]], an immigrant from Hungary. It was first commissioned by ABC Records in 1984 and then televised by Channel 10 in 1986 in their Australia Day Broadcast, featuring [[Julie Anthony (singer)|Julie Anthony]] as the soloist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tommytycho.com.au/home.htm Tommy Tycho website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of lyrics==
Since the original lyrics were written in 1879, there have been several changes. Some of these were minor while others have significantly changed the song. The original song was four verses long. For its adoption as the national anthem, the song was cut from four verses to two. The first verse was kept largely as the 1879 original, except for the change in the first line from &quot;'''Australia's sons''' let us rejoice&quot; to &quot;'''Australians all''' let us rejoice&quot;.&lt;ref name=anthem/&gt; The second, third and fourth verses of the original were dropped, in favour of a modified version of new third verse which was sung at [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.mus-an6397822|title=Digital Collections – Advance Australia Fair (1901–1919)|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]|accessdate=3 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original lyrics published in 1879 were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview?pi=nla.mus-an24220024-s1-e|title=Digital Collections – Advance Australia Fair (1879)|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]|accessdate=1 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Lack of impact===
Both the lyrics and melody of the official anthem have been criticised in some quarters as being dull and unendearing to the Australian people. [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] Senator [[Sandy Macdonald]] said in 2001 that ''Advance Australia Fair'' is so boring that the nation risks singing itself to sleep, with boring music and words impossible to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/06/22/waust22.xml|title=Call to scrap Australia's 'dull' anthem|author=Barbie Dutter|publisher=[[telegraph.co.uk]]|date=27 June 2001|accessdate=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His Parliamentary colleague [[Peter Slipper]] thought Australia should consider another anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/politics/2001/06/item20010621121726_1.htm|title=Senator reignites debate over national anthem|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|date=21 June 2001|accessdate=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Girt&quot; lyric===
In 2001, [[Australian Labor Party]] politician [[Craig Emerson]] criticised the [[Archaism|archaic]] word &quot;[[wikt:girt|girt]]&quot; in the national anthem's lyrics by saying, &quot;This must rank as one of the worst lines of any national anthem. That Australia is an island should be pretty obvious, but is our anthem girt by a sea of mediocrity?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Advance Australia Fair strikes a sour note|newspaper=The Australian|date=2 January 2001|url=http://www.hamilton.net.au/advance/links.html|accessdate=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2001, [[Kim Beazley]], the then Labor leader, defended the lyric saying, &quot;I stand up on behalf of girt. Girt by sea needs to be celebrated and if we can't do that regularly when Australia enjoys its sporting triumphs, at the beginning of our school assemblies and I think something would be lost that is new and decent and essential to the Australian character.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alp.org.au/media/0601/kbmcact210601.html |title=Kim Beazley – Doorstop Interview (transcript)|publisher=[[Australian Labor Party]]|date=21 June 2001|accessdate=20 December 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010718044509/http://www.alp.org.au/media/0601/kbmcact210601.html|archivedate=18 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthem's lyrics and the phrase &quot;girt by sea&quot; have also drawn criticism in the media.  In 2008, the [[Herald Sun]] published an article headed ''Time girt went down the gurgler'', arguing that the anthem's lyrics were largely irrelevant to modern Australian life and that &quot;girt by sea&quot; is &quot;simply an antiquated way of making the obvious statement that we live on an island.&quot; The article suggested replacing the first four lines of the anthem with:

:Australians all let us rejoice,
:For we are proud and free;
:We've golden sands and willing hands,
:For home and family.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Campbell|first=David|title=Time girt went down the gurgler|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=22 April 2008|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/time-girt-went-down-the-gurgler/story-e6frfifo-1111116123498|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missing verse claim==
''Awakening'', a Christian movement in Australia, has claimed that the anthem has a missing verse with a distinctly Christian message.&lt;ref name=sixth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awakening.org.au/media/2k0606lost.htm|title=Lost verse puts Christ into the National Anthem|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20001027091035/http://www.awakening.org.au/media/2k0606lost.htm|archivedate=27 October 2000|date=6 June 2000|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recent performance of this verse was during the Global March for Jesus in 1998.&lt;ref name=sixth/&gt; The verse was also sung at [[World Youth Day 2008]].&lt;ref name=&quot;worldyouth&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

      <comment>I updated the 613 listing a couple weeks ago, didn't notice there was an entry for Bell Canada in the main text too... updated.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''automatic number announcement circuit''' ('''ANAC''') is a special [[telephone number]] that is meant to be used by [[telephone company|phone company]] [[technician]]s and other [[telecommunications]] technicians to determine the phone number of a particular [[local loop|line]].

The way an ANAC works is fairly simple. A technician will call a local ANAC's phone number. This number connects to a computer at a local [[telephone exchange|central office]], which uses a voice synthesizer or digital samples to &quot;[[text-to-speech|speak]]&quot; the phone number of the line calling in. The main purpose of this system is to allow phone company technicians to identify which telephone line they are connected to. Because this system is based on [[automatic number identification]] (not [[caller ID]]) and meant for phone company technicians, the ANAC system works with [[unlisted number]]s, numbers with caller ID blocking, and numbers with no outgoing calls allowed.

Some ANACs are very regional or local in scope, while others are state-/province- or [[telephone numbering plan|area-code]]-wide: there appears to be no consistent national system for them. Every telephone company, whether large or small, determines its own ANAC for each individual central office, which tends to perpetuate the current situation of a mess of overlapping and/or spotty areas of coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artofhacking.com/tucops/phreak/callerid/live/aoh_anac.htm artofhacking.com List of local ANAC phone numbers] in United States, Canada, Australia and Britain&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[North American Numbering Plan]], most North American area codes reserve telephone numbers beginning with ''958'' and ''959'' for internal testing. Some companies also reserve numbers beginning with ''999''. Numbers within this block are used for various types of local and long-distance testing; generally, this block includes a [[ringback number]] (to test the ringer when installing [[telephone]] sets) and a [[loop around]] (which connects a call to another inbound call to the same or another test number). ANAC numbers (the topic of this article) can also appear in the ''958'' range, but there is no requirement that they reside there.

Some carriers (such as [[Bell Canada]]) have been known to disable [[payphone]] calls to 958 or 959 test lines: in the specific case of Bell Canada, the system-wide ANAC line is at '''958-2580'''. Some large telephone companies have [[toll-free number]]s set up. In most cases, these numbers remain undisclosed to prevent abuse, but MCI maintains this widely-published, toll-free ANAC: '''1-800-437-7950'''. This is distinct from technical support and other lines which use [[automatic number identification|ANI]] so that a computer can automatically display the customer's account on a &quot;[[screen pop]]&quot; for the next available [[customer service]] representative: the MCI number above is intended specifically for use as an ANAC.

Formerly, some companies changed their ANAC number every month for secrecy; this is still the case with a few numbers. In one example of this concern, most payphones in the [[United States]] are assigned a telephone number and can ring if the number is called. The phone can then be used to make and receive calls by anyone, making it a potential tool in anonymous criminal activity such as [[narcotics trafficking]]. Where a payphone does not have any number listed on the unit, the number can be discovered by calling an ANAC service.

Late in the 20th century, [[caller ID]] and [[prepaid cellphone]] service became commonplace. These services being more easily [[exploit]]ed for criminal purposes, this type of abuse of payphones faded from concern. In Canada, this behaviour has always been more difficult. As a matter of course, incoming calls to payphones are disabled; furthermore, the Bell ANAC number is also disabled.

There are some private national toll-free numbers that use [[automatic number identification|ANI]] and then have a computer read back the number that is calling, but these are not intended for use in identifying the customer's own phone number. They are used in order for the agent in the [[call center]] to confirm the phone the customer is calling from, so that a computer can automatically display the customer's account on a &quot;[[screen pop]]&quot; for the next available [[customer service]] representative; they are distinct from purpose-made toll-free ANAC numbers. Regardless, if one were to call one of these numbers, listen for the number confirmation and hang up, they would in effect be using this system as if it were an ANAC.

One such toll-free service is one owned by MCI - 1-800-444-4444. This number is easy to remember and, when called, will read back your number after a very short message.&lt;ref&gt;http://aplawrence.com/Unixart/dhanacsnumbers.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy that a suspended or out of service line or an incoming only line would not be able to reach any toll-free numbers.

==ANAC numbers==

For easier reference, the list is presented by area code. In some regions, there are several numbers, depending on the telephone company and/or the area you are calling from as there can be several central offices serving some areas. All are local numbers.
