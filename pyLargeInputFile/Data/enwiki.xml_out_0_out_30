 the head of nearby Loch Katrine, and his well known cattle stealing exploits took him all around the area surrounding Aberfoyle.  There currently stands a tree in the village that MacGregor was reputed to have climbed and hid in to escape the clutches of the law.  Also, Mary, Queen of Scots, visited nearby Inchmahome Priory often as a child, and during her short reign.  She also used the priory during her short reign, particularly in 1547, where she felt safe from the English Army.

However, the most local historical figure is the Reverend Robert Kirk, born in 1644. It was the Rev. Kirk who provided the first translation into [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaidhlig]] of the Book of Psalms, however, he is better remembered for the publication of his book ''&quot;The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns, and Fairies&quot;'' in 1691.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kirk|first=Robert|title=The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns, and Fairies|publisher=New York Review of Books Classics|date=30 November 2006|edition=hardcover|isbn=1590171772|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Secret-Commonwealth-Fairies-Review-Hardcover/dp/1590171772|accessdate=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/sce/|title=The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns, and Fairies|last=Hare|first=John Bruno|date=27 february 2004|accessdate=2009-08-14}} '''Full text of 1893 book'''&lt;/ref&gt;  Kirk had long been researching fairies, and the book collected several personal accounts and stories of folk who claimed to have encountered them.  It was after this, while Kirk was minister of Aberfoyle parish, that he died in unusual circumstances.

Kirk had long believed that the local Doon Hill (or Fairy Knowe as it is more commonly known), was the gateway to the &quot;Secret Commonwealth&quot;, or the land of the Fairies.  It was a place that Kirk visited often, taking daily walks there from his manse.  The story goes that the Fairies of Doon Hill were angry with the Rev. Kirk for going into the domain of the Unseelie court, where he had been warned not to go, and decided to imprison him in Doon Hill&amp;nbsp;— for one night in May 1692, the Rev. Kirk went out for a walk to the hill, in his nightshirt.  Some accounts claim that he simply vanished, however he suddenly collapsed.  He was found and brought home, but died soon afterwards.  He was buried in his own kirkyard, although local legends claim that the fairies took his body away, and the coffin contains only stones. The huge pine tree that still stands at the top of Doon Hill is said to contain Kirk's imprisoned spirit.

Kirk's cousin, Graham of Duchray, was then to claim that the spectre of Kirk had visited him in the night, and told him that he had been carried off by the Fairies.  Having left his widow expecting a child, the spectre of Kirk told Graham that he would appear at the baptism, whereupon Graham was to throw an iron knife at the apparition, thus freeing Kirk from the Fairies' clutches. However when Kirk's spectre appeared, Graham was apparently too shocked by the vision to throw the knife, and Kirk's ghost faded away forever.

Today, visitors to Doon Hill write their wishes on pieces of white silk, or other white cloth, and tie them to the branches of the trees for the Fairies to grant.  It is also said that if one runs around the great pine tree at the summit seven times, then the Fairies will appear.

In recent years the largest of the trees, Kirk's &quot;Minister's Pine&quot;, has been damaged by vandals who have hammered coins into the bark. Other Scots pines in the surrounding area are increasingly commonly festooned with tied bits of plastic, crisp packets and the like rather than 'white pieces of silk'.

'''Abergavenny''' ({{lang-cy|Y Fenni}}), meaning ''Mouth of the River Gavenny'', is a [[market town]] in [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]].  It is located 15 miles (24&amp;nbsp;km) west of [[Monmouth]] on the [[A40 road|A40]] and [[A465 road|A465]] roads, 6 miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) from the [[England|English]] border. Originally the site of a [[Castra|Roman fort]], ''[[Gobannium]]'', it became a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Defensive wall|walled town]] within the [[Welsh Marches]]. The town contains the remains of a medieval stone [[castle]] built soon after the [[Norman invasion of Wales|Norman conquest of Wales]].  

Abergavenny is promoted as the &quot;Gateway to Wales&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/abergavenny/pages/article_pip.shtml | title=The Gateway to Wales | author=BBC | accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frommers&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/abergavenny/2501010001.html | title=Introduction to Abergavenny | author=Frommers | accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situated at the [[confluence]] of a [[tributary]] stream, the Gavenny, and the [[River Usk]], it is almost surrounded by two mountains – the [[Blorenge]] (559&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;ref&gt;Geograph British Isles – [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/498684 The Blorenge from the B4598 road at Ty'r-pwll]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sugar Loaf Mountain, Wales|Sugar Loaf]] (596&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;ref&gt;Geograph British Isles – [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/493390 River Usk with Sugar Loaf in background]&lt;/ref&gt; – and five hills: [[Ysgyryd Fawr]] (The Skirrid), Ysgyryd Fach (Skirrid Fach), Deri, Rholben and [[Mynydd Llanwenarth]], known locally as &quot;Llanwenarth Breast&quot;. It provides access to the nearby [[Black Mountains, Wales|Black Mountains]] and the [[Brecon Beacons]] [[National parks of England and Wales|National Park]]. The [[Offa's Dyke Path]] is close by and the [[Marches Way]], the [[Beacons Way]] and [[Usk Valley Walk]] all pass through the town.  

== History ==
=== Origins of the town and its name ===
[[Image:Abergaveny.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Part of Abergavenny and Skirrid Fach (Little Skirrid) seen from the castle ruins]]
Gobannium was a Roman fort guarding the road along the valley of the River Usk which linked the legionary fortress of ''[[Burrium]]'' ([[Usk]]) and later ''[[Isca Augusta]]'' ([[Caerleon]]) in the south with [[Y Gaer, Brecon]] and [[Mid Wales]]. It was also built to keep the peace among the local [[British Iron Age]] tribe, the [[Silures]]. Remains of the walls of this fort were discovered west of the castle when excavating the foundations for a new [[post office]] and [[telephone exchange]] building in the late 1960s.

The [[Welsh placenames|name]] derives from a [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] word ''Gobannia'' meaning &quot;river of the blacksmiths&quot;, and relates to the town's pre-Roman importance in iron [[smelting|smelt]]ing. The name is related to the modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word ''gof'' ([[blacksmith]]), and so is also associated with the Welsh smith ''[[Gofannon]]'' from folklore. The river later became, in Welsh, ''Gafenni'', and the town's name became Abergavenny, meaning &quot;mouth of (Welsh: ''Aber'') the Gavenny (''Gafenni'')&quot;.  In Welsh, the shortened form ''Y Fenni'' may have come into use for a very short period after about the 15th century, although pronounced similarly in [[English language|English]] or Welsh the English spelling Abergavenny is in general use.&lt;ref&gt;Hywel Wyn Owen, ''The Place-Names of Wales'', 1998, ISBN 0-7083-1458-9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Norman period ===
Abergavenny grew as a town in early [[Normans|Norman]] times under the protection of the [[Baron Bergavenny|Lords of Abergavenny]]. The first Baron was [[Hamelin de Balun]], from [[Ballon, Sarthe|Ballon]], a small town and castle in [[Maine-Anjou]] called &quot;Gateway to Maine&quot;, near [[Le Mans]], today in the [[Sarthe]] ''[[département]]'' of [[France]]. He founded the [[Benedictine]] [[priory]], now the [[Priory Church of St Mary, Abergavenny|Priory Church of St Mary]], in the late 11th century. The Priory belonged originally to the [[Benedictine]] foundation of St. Vincent Abbaye at Le Mans. It was subsequently endowed by [[William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber|William de Braose]], with a tenth or ''&quot;[[tithe]]&quot;'' of the profits of the castle and town. The church contains some unique [[alabaster]] [[Effigy|effigies]], [[church monument]]s and unique medieval wood carving, such as the [[Tree of Jesse]].

Owing to its geographical location the town was frequently embroiled in the border warfare and power play of the 12th and 13th centuries in the Welsh Marches. In 1175, [[Abergavenny Castle]] was the scene of a reputed massacre of local Welsh chieftains by the pious and ruthless William de Braose. So the story goes, after a period of discord and conflict he invited the local leaders to a Christmas banquet under the pretext of resolving differences and building relations but his plan was to eliminate them. Accepting his supposed hospitality, at a traditional time for settling differences, the influential Welsh leaders of the surrounding areas nearly all arrived, proffered their swords as tokens of peaceful intent to servants and, unarmed, were ushered further into the castle where de Braose's armed soldiers hacked them down in [[cold blood]]. [[Gerald of Wales|Giraldus Cambrensis]] relates how in 1182 the castle was seized back by the [[Welsh people|Welsh]].

=== 1300 to 1900 ===
[[File:Abergavenny and Holy Mountain, Wales, 1890-1900.jpg|thumb|Abergavenny and [[Ysgyryd Fawr|Holy Mountain]] in the 1890s]]
[[Owain Glyndŵr]] attacked Abergavenny in 1404. According to popular legend, his raiders gained access to the walled town with the aid of a local woman who sympathised with the rebellion, letting a small party in via the Market Street gate at midnight. They were able to open the gate and allow a much larger party who set fire to the town and plundered its churches and homes leaving Abergavenny Castle intact. Market Street has been referred to as ''Traitors' Lane'' thereafter. In 1404 Abergavenny was declared its own nation by [[Ieuan ab Owain Glyndŵr]], illegitimate son of [[Owain Glyndŵr]]. The arrangement lasted approximately two weeks.

At the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1541 the priory's endowment went towards the foundation of a free [[grammar school]], [[King Henry VIII Grammar School]], the site itself passing to the Gunter family.

During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], prior to the siege of [[Raglan Castle]] in 1645, [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] visited Abergavenny and presided in person over the trial of [[Sir Trevor Williams, 1st Baronet|Sir Trefor Williams, 1st Baronet]] of [[Llangybi, Monmouthshire|Llangibby]], a [[Royalist]] who changed sides, and other [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]].

In 1639 Abergavenny received a [[charter]] of incorporation under the title of [[bailiff]] and [[Burgess (word)|burgesses]]. A charter with extended privileges was drafted in 1657, but appears never to have been enrolled or to have come into effect. Owing to the refusal of the chief officers of the corporation to take the [[oath of allegiance]] to [[William III of England|William III]] in 1688, the charter was annulled, and the town subsequently declined in prosperity. Chapter 28 of the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|1535 Act of Henry VIII]], which provided that Monmouth, as [[county town]], should return one burgess to Parliament, further stated that other [[Monmouthshire (historic)|ancient Monmouthshire boroughs]] were to contribute towards the payment of the member. In consequence of this clause Abergavenny on various occasions shared in the election, the last instance being in 1685.

Reference to a market at Abergavenny is found in a charter granted to the Prior by William de Braose (d. 1211). The right to hold two weekly markets and three yearly [[fair]]s, as held ever since, was confirmed in 1657. Abergavenny was celebrated for the production of Welsh [[flannel]], and also for the manufacture, whilst the fashion prevailed, of goats' hair [[periwig]]s.

The title of [[Baron Bergavenny|Baron Abergavenny]], in the Nevill family, dates from [[Edward Nevill, 3rd Baron Bergavenny]] (d. 1476), who was the youngest son of [[Ralph de Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland]] by his second wife [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland|Joan Beaufort]], daughter of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], first [[Duke of Lancaster]]. He married the heiress of [[Richard de Beauchamp, 1st Earl of Worcester]], whose father had inherited the castle and estate of Abergavenny, and was summoned in 1392 to parliament as Lord Bergavenny. Edward Nevill was summoned to parliament with this title in 1450. His direct male descendants ended in 1387 in [[Henry Nevill, 6th Baron Bergavenny]], but a cousin, [[Edward Nevill, 8th Baron Bergavenny]] (d. 1622), was confirmed in the Barony in 1604. From him it has descended continuously, through fifteen individuals, the title being increased to an [[Earl]]dom in 1784; and in 1876 [[William Nevill, 1st Marquess of Abergavenny|William Nevill]] [''sic''] 5th Earl (b. 1826), (d.1915) an indefatigable and powerful supporter of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory Party]], was created 1st [[Marquess of Abergavenny]].

[[Abergavenny railway station]] opened 2 January 1854 and is on the [[Welsh Marches Line]].

== Sporting traditions ==
Abergavenny is the home of [[Abergavenny Thursdays F.C.]], which was formed in 1927, and is currently a member of the Gwent County League Division 3. The club's current position comes within 15 years of their being one of the top sides in Welsh football, winning the old format [[Welsh Football League]] in 1991 and 1992, but being relegated in 1993 after just one season in the newly formed [[Welsh Premier League|League of Wales]]. The club suffered relegation from the Welsh Football League in 2001 and has since slipped down through the next two divisions into its current position, although the future is now looking brighter.

Abergavenny Cricket Club play at [[Pen-y-Pound, Abergavenny|Pen-y-Pound]], Avenue Road, and [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan CCC]] play some of their games here. Abergavenny Cricket Club is one of the oldest in the country and celebrated the 175th anniversary of its foundation in 2009.

Abergavenny Tennis Club also play at [[Pen-y-Pound, Abergavenny|Pen-y-Pound]] and plays in the South Wales Doubles League and Aegon Team Tennis. The club engages the services of a head tennis professional to run a coaching programme for the town and was crowned [[Tennis Wales]]' Club of the Year in 2010. 

Abergavenny is also the home of [[Abergavenny RFC]], a [[rugby union]] club founded in 1875 who play at Bailey Park. They play in the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] Division Two East league.

Abergavenny hosted the British National Cycling Championships in 2007 and 2009.

== Markets and fairs ==
=== Cattle market ===
A [[cattle]] market has been held in Abergavenny on its current site since 1863. During the period 1825–1863 a [[Domestic sheep|sheep]] market was held at a site in Castle Street, to stop the sale of sheep on the streets of the town. Today the market is leased and operated by Abergavenny Market Auctioneers Ltd., who hold regular livestock auctions on the site. Market days are: Tuesday – The sale of finished sheep, cull ewe/store, a Fodder auction (sale of hay and straw). Some Fridays – The sale of cattle. A few other sales are held on the site on other days throughout the year.

Following the closure of [[Newport]] Cattle Market to make way for a new development. Newport’s sale will be held at Abergavenny Cattle Market on every Wednesday.

Following the sale of the cattle market land to [[Morrisons]], a new cattle market will now be provided out of town once the market act has been repealed.

=== The Market Hall ===
Various markets are held in the Market Hall, for example: Tuesdays – retail market, which also stretches into the town hall car park and temporarily the Cattle Market, while Brewery Yard car park is regenerated; Wednesday – flea market; 4th Thursday of the month a [[farmers' market]]; Friday – retail market; Saturday – retail market (also in the town hall car park); 3rd Sunday of the month – antique fair; 2nd Saturday – craft fair.

It has a population of 6,826.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/viewFullDataset.do?instanceSelection=03070&amp;productId=779&amp;$ph=60_61&amp;datasetInstanceId=3070&amp;startColumn=1&amp;numberOfColumns=8&amp;containerAreaId=790577 Census 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

It lies in the narrow northern section of the [[Afon Llwyd]] valley. The town includes three schools, [[Abersychan Comprehensive School]], Victoria [[Primary School]] and St. Francis' R.C. Primary School (although the latter is due to close, along with St. Alban's R.C. Primary School, to be replaced by the new [[Padre Pio]] R.C. Primary School in Pontypool) and various shops and other amenities.

Abersychan was the birthplace of the [[politician]]s; [[Roy Jenkins]], Baron Hillhead, [[Don Touhig]], and Rt. Hon. [[Paul Murphy (UK politician)|Paul Murphy]], MP for Torfaen, and the [[rugby football]]ers; [[Wilfred Hodder]], [[Candy Evans]], and [[Bryn Meredith]].

==History==
Abersychan was a thriving industrial centre in the 19th century and early 20th century, particularly for [[iron]] production. The principal ironworks was built by the [[British Iron Company]] in 1825; it passed to the New British Iron Company in 1843 and to the [[Ebbw Vale]] Company in 1852 but closed in 1889.

On 6 February 1890, an underground [[explosion]] at Llanerch Colliery killed 176.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Llanerch Colliery, Abersychan|url=http://www.welshcoalmines.co.uk/Gwent/LlanerchColliery.htm|work=Welsh Coal Mines|accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local government==
Abersychan now constitutes a community and electoral division of the [[county borough]] of [[Torfaen]]. The area was anciently part of the [[parish]] of [[Trevethin]], in [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]]. On June 3, 1864 Abersychan was constituted a local government district, governed by a [[local board of health|local board]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~familyalbum/kbsychan.htm Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire, 1901]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 Abersychan became an [[urban district]] and [[civil parishes in Wales|civil parish]]. The urban district was abolished in 1935, with most of its area passing to Pontypool urban district, and a small area going to [[Abercarn]] UD.

In 1974 the area became part of the borough of Torfaen, in the new local government county of [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]]. A community of Abersychan was formed in 1985, but to date no [[community council]] has been formed.&lt;ref&gt;The Torfaen (Communities) Order 1985 (1985 No. 129)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 Torfaen became a unitary authority.

The Abersychan community includes Abersychan, [[Cwmavon, Torfaen|Cwmavon]], [[Garndiffaith]], [[Pentwyn, Torfaen|Pentwyn]], [[Talywain]], [[Varteg]], and [[Victoria Village, Torfaen|Victoria Village]].

==Places nearby==
=== Pentwyn ===
''Pentwyn'', [[Torfaen]] is a small [[village]] located in the district of Abersychan. It contains a [[post office]], a chapel, several houses and a small play park. The village has a [[cricket]] team (Pentwyn CC) and is located right next to the old railway line. The cricket club celebrated its 100-year anniversary in 2006 with a successful tour to [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Ireland]]. The village has superb views over the [[River Severn]] and [[Newport]] to the south.

===Victoria Village===
''Victoria Village'' is a small [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] located in the district of Abersychan. It comprises a small village school and a number of houses. A small group of houses on Incline Road mark the beginning of the village and the village boundary is near [[Cwmavon, Torfaen|Cwmavon]]. Victoria Primary School is also in this area on a large grounds. Many homes are built around the school's boundaries.

'''Abertillery''' ({{lang-cy|Abertyleri}}) is a town in the county borough of [[Blaenau Gwent]] in [[South Wales]], {{convert|16|mi}} north-west of [[Newport]], originally on the [[Great Western Railway]]. Its population rose steeply during the period of [[Mining in Wales|mining]] development in [[South Wales]], being 10,846 in the [[Census in the United Kingdom|1891 census]] and 21,945 ten years later. Lying in the [[South Wales coalfield|mountainous mining district]] of the former counties of [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] and [[Glamorganshire]], in the valley of the [[Ebbw River|Ebbw Fach]], the population was traditionally employed in the numerous coal-mines, ironworks and tin-plate works, now defunct. Further up the same valley are the mining townships of [[Nantyglo]] and [[Blaina]].

Abertillery has a traditional-style town centre and several small schools. Today, its population numbers just over 11,000 and is thought to be declining. In 2003, Abertillery was found to have the cheapest [[house]]s in the [[United Kingdom]], according to a survey by the [[Halifax (United Kingdom bank)|Halifax]], with an average price of only [[Pound sterling|£]]37,872.&lt;ref name=cheapest&gt;{{cite news | title = Abertillery's the cheapest town | publisher = [[South Wales Echo]] | page = 3 | date = 25 January 2003 | accessdate = 2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noted for its unspoilt rural scenery, Abertillery neighbours the small districts of [[Aberbeeg]] (''Aber-bîg''), [[Llanhilleth]] (''Llanhiledd''), [[Cwmtillery]] (''Cwmtyleri''), and [[Six Bells]] (''Chwe Chloch'').

Over the past couple of decades the town has been transformed from industrial relic into the clean, modernised area it is today – this has largely been achieved due to large amounts of [[European Union]] [[Objective One]] funding which has helped the town remove unsightly reminders of the industrial past. Many of these areas have been utilised as playing fields, [[business park]]s or mixed use land (including the local [[comprehensive school]]).
[[File:Abertillery.jpg|left|thumb|View from the back of Adam Street in Abertillery, March 2000.]]
A recent [[windfarm]] proposal for the mountainside above the community of [[Cwmtillery]] has been revived despite opposition to the initial proposal drawing large support. This included a group tagged SCAM (Save Coity and Mynydd James), which led to the application being removed with Blaenau Gwent County Council before being re-submitted on a much smaller scale. The SCAM group is still active in the opposition to the proposal and holds regular meetings in the local area concerning the subject.

The town's name is pronounced with the emphasis on the penultimate syllable, i.e. it rhymes with ''Mary'', as in a song made popular by Welsh entertainer [[Ryan Davies]]: &quot;''Blodwen and Mary'' from Abertillery...&quot;

The reopening of [[Abertillery railway station]] has been identified as a potential future development of the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]].

According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]] and information gathered by The [[Welsh Language Board]] ({{lang-cy|Bwrdd yr Iaith Gymraeg}}), 1,146 (9.9%) of Abertillery speaks Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.byig-wlb.org.uk/English/publications/Pages/PublicationItem.aspx?puburl=/English%2fpublications%2fPublications%2f786.xls |title=No. &amp; Percentage Welsh speakers 3+ By Community and Age |author=The Welsh Language Board |date=26 February 2004 |format=[[Microsoft Excel#File formats|XLS]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
Abertillery is home to [[cricket]] club Abertillery Town Cricket Club,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abertillerycricket.com/ Abertillery Town Cricket Club]&lt;/ref&gt; who were formed in the 1880s. The town's [[rugby union]] club is [[Abertillery RFC|Abertillery Blaenau Gwent RFC]] who also formed in the mid 1880s. The town supports two local Saturday [[Association football|football]] teams – [[Abertillery Bluebirds F.C.|Abertillery Bluebirds]] and Abertillery Excelsiors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abettor''' (from ''to abet,'' [[Old French]] ''abeter'', ''á'' and ''beter'', to bait, urge dogs upon any one; this word is probably of Scandinavian origin, meaning to cause to bite), is a legal term implying one who instigates, encourages or assists another to commit an offence.

An abettor differs from an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] in that he must be present at the commission of the crime; all abettors (with certain exceptions) are principals, and, in the absence of specific statutory provision to the contrary, are punishable to the same extent as the actual perpetrator of the offence.  A person may in certain cases be convicted as an abettor in the commission of an offence in which he or she could not be a principal, e.g. a woman or boy under fourteen years of age in aiding rape, or a solvent person in aiding and abetting a bankrupt to commit offences against the bankruptcy laws.

More recently, an abettor is generally known as an [[accomplice]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abeyance''' (from the [[Old French]] ''abeance'' meaning &quot;gaping&quot;) is a state of expectancy in respect of property, titles or office, when the right to them is not [[vesting|vested]] in any one person, but awaits the appearance or determination of the true owner.  In law, the term abeyance can only be applied to such future estates as have not yet vested or possibly may not vest.  For example, an estate is granted to A for life, with [[Remainder (law)|remainder]] to the heir of B.  During B's lifetime, the remainder is in abeyance, for until the death of B it is uncertain who is B's heir.  Similarly the [[Freehold (real property)|freehold]] of a [[benefice]], on the death of the incumbent, is said to be in abeyance until the next incumbent takes possession.

==Peerage law==
The most common use of the term is in the case of English [[British Peerage|peerage]] dignities.  Most such peerages pass to [[Order of succession#Agnatic succession|heirs-male]], but the ancient [[barony|baronies]] created by [[hereditary peer#Writs of summons|writ]], as well as some very old [[earldom]]s, pass instead to [[Order of succession#Primogeniture|heirs-general]] (by [[cognatic primogeniture]]).  In this system, sons are preferred from eldest to youngest, the heirs of a son over the next son, and any son over daughters, but there is no preference among daughters: they or their heirs inherit equally.

If the daughter is an only child or her sisters are deceased and have no living issue, she (or her heir) is vested with the title; otherwise, since a peerage cannot be shared nor divided, the dignity goes into abeyance between the sisters or their heirs, and is held by no one.  If through lack of issue, marriage or both, eventually only one person represents the claims of all the sisters, he or she can claim the dignity as a matter of right, and the abeyance is said to be terminated.  On the other hand, the number of prospective heirs can grow quite large, since each share potentially can be divided between daughters.

A co-heir may petition the Crown for a termination of the abeyance.  The Crown may choose to grant the petition, but if there is any doubt whatsoever as to the pedigree of the petitioner, the claim is normally referred to the [[Peerage law#Peerage disputes|Committee for Privileges]].  If the claim is unopposed, the Committee will generally award the claim, unless there is evidence of [[collusion]], the peerage has been in abeyance for more than a century, or if the petitioner holds less than one-third of the claim.

This doctrine is a seventeenth-century innovation, although it is now applied retrospectively for centuries; the seventh [[Baron De La Warr]] had three surviving sons; the first died without children, the second left two daughters, the third left a son. By modern law, the title would have fallen into abeyance between the two daughters of the second son, and nobody else would have been able to claim it even if the abeyance were settled; in 1597, the grandson of the third son claimed the title and its precedence. In 1604, the [[Baron le Despencer]] case was the peerage abeyance ever settled; the second was at the [[Restoration]] in 1660. Most subsequent abeyances (only a few dozen cases)  were settled after a few years, to the benefit of the holder of the family properties; there were two periods in which long-abeyant peerages (in some cases peerages of doubtful reality) were brought back: between 1838 and 1841 and between 1909 and 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[[Complete Peerage]], Vol IV, Appendix H&lt;/ref&gt; Abeyance has never applied to earldoms, and the only baronies have been called out of abeyance.&lt;ref&gt;Complete Peerage, Vol XI, p. 131 - supplemental number; and Vol IV, Appendix H, p. 725&lt;/ref&gt;

It is entirely possible for a peerage to remain in abeyance for centuries. For example, the [[Baron Grey of Codnor|Barony of Grey of Codnor]] was in abeyance for over 490 years between 1496 and 1989, and the [[Baron Hastings|Barony of Hastings]] was similarly in abeyance for over 299 years from 1542 to 1841. Some other baronies became abeyant in the thirteenth century, and the abeyance has yet to be terminated.  The only titles other than a barony that have yet gone into abeyance are the [[Baron Arlington|earldom of Arlington and the viscountcy of Thetford]], which are united, and (briefly) the [[Earl of Cromartie|earldom of Cromartie]].

Titles in the [[Peerage of Scotland]] cannot go into abeyance. In Scotland, the eldest sister is preferred over younger sisters; sisters are not considered equal co-heirs.

It is common, but incorrect, to speak of peerage dignities which are dormant (i.e. unclaimed) as being in abeyance.
==Peerages called out of abeyance==

*1721 [[Baron Clinton]] after 29 years
*1734: [[Baron Clifford]] after 5 years; (again 1776 and 1833 after a year)

*1780; [[Baron Willoughby of Eresby]] after a year; again in 1871 after a year.
*1784: [[Baron Howard de Walden]] after 96 years.&lt;ref&gt;Complete Peerage, Vol IV, Appendix H, p. 725&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settling litigation==
Abeyance can be used in cases where parties are interested in temporarily settling litigation while still holding the right to seek relief later if necessary.  This may be considered a desirable outcome in cases where the party to the lawsuit is an organization with a transient membership and political perspective.  The use of abeyance in such instances can allow such an organization to 'settle' with the party without officially binding its actions in the future, should a new group of decision makers within the organization choose to pursue taking the dispute to court.

For example, abeyance was used as a settlement method in a Canadian lawsuit involving the [[University of Victoria Students' Society]] (UVSS), the [[British Columbia Civil Liberties Association|BCCLA]], and a campus pro life to whom the UVSS denied funding to.  The parties agreed to settle the lawsuit by holding the case in abeyance in return for the UVSS temporarily giving resources back to the club.  With this arrangement, the pro life club held on to its right to immediately reopen the case again should the UVSS deny resources to the club in the future, and the UVSS was able to avoid an expensive legal battle it did not have the will to pursue at the time.  Thus the use of abeyance provided the security of a settlement for the pro life campus club, while preserving the student society's voting membership's ability to take the matter back to court should they choose in the future to deny resources to the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomson |first=Stephen |url=http://www.straight.com/article-334508/vancouver/university-victoria-antiabortion-group-resolves-dispute-student-union |title=University of Victoria anti-abortion group resolves dispute with student union |publisher=Straight.com |date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=2010-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anders Celsius''' (27 November 1701 &amp;ndash; 25 April 1744) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[astronomy|astronomer]]. He was professor of astronomy at [[Uppsala University]] from 1730 to 1744, but traveled from 1732 to 1735 visiting notable observatories in Germany, Italy and France. He founded the [[Uppsala Astronomical Observatory]] in 1741, and in 1742 he proposed the [[Celsius]] [[temperature]] scale which takes his name. The scale was later reversed in 1745 by [[Carl Linnaeus]], one year after Celsius' death.

==Biography==
===Young life===
Anders Celsius was born in [[Uppsala]], Sweden on 27 November 1701. His family originated from [[Ovanåker]] in the province of [[Hälsingland]]. The family name is a Latin version of the name of the vicarage (Högen).  Anders was raised a Lutheran.

As the son of an astronomy professor, Nils Celsius, and the grandson of the mathematician [[Agnus Celsius]] and the astronomer Anders Spole, Celsius chose a career in science. He was a talented mathematician from an early age. Anders Celsius studied at [[Uppsala University]], where his father was a teacher, and in 1730 he too, became a professor of astronomy there.

===Career===
In 1730, he published the {{lang|la|''Nova Methodus distantiam solis a terra determinandi''|}} (''New Method for Determining the Distance from the Sun to the Earth''). His research also involved the study of auroral phenomena, which he conducted with his assistant [[Hiorter|Olof Hiorter]], and he was the first to suggest a connection between the [[aurora borealis]] and changes in the magnetic field of the Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;notablebiographies.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Ca-Ch/Celsius-Anders.html
|title=Anders Celsius
|publisher=notablebiographies.com
|accessdate=2008-06-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed the variations of a compass needle and found that larger deflections correlated with stronger auroral activity. At [[Nuremberg]] in 1733, he published a collection of 316 observations of the aurora borealis made by himself and others over the period 1716–1732.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9022032/Anders-Celsius Encyclopedia Britannica], Retrieved on 24 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Celsius traveled frequently in the early 1730s, including to Germany, Italy, and France, when he visited most of the major European observatories. In Paris he advocated the measurement of an [[arc of the meridian]] in [[Laponia (historical province)|Lapland]]. In 1736, he participated in the expedition organized for that purpose by the [[French Academy of Sciences]], led by the French mathematician [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] (1698–1759) to measure a degree of [[latitude]]. The aim of the expedition was to measure the length of a degree along a meridian, close to the pole, and compare the result with a similar expedition to [[Peru]], today in [[Ecuador]], near the [[equator]]. The expeditions confirmed [[Isaac Newton]]'s belief that the shape of the earth is an [[ellipsoid]] flattened at the poles.&lt;ref name=&quot;astro.uu.se&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-06-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''
[[Image:AndersCelsiusyoung.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Celsius]] 
In 1738, he published the {{lang|la|''De observationibus pro figura telluris determinanda''}} (''Observations on Determining the Shape of the Earth''). Celsius' participation in the Lapland expedition won him much respect in Sweden with the government and his peers, and played a key role in generating interest from the Swedish authorities in donating the resources required to construct a new modern observatory in Uppsala. He was successful in the request, and Celsius founded the [[Uppsala Astronomical Observatory]] in 1741. The observatory was equipped with instruments purchased during his long voyage abroad, comprising the most modern instrumental technology of the period&quot;

In astronomy, Celsius began a series of observations using colored glass plates to record the magnitude (a measure of brightness) of certain stars. This was the first attempt to measure the intensity of starlight with a tool other than the human eye. He made observations of eclipses and various astronomical objects and published catalogues of carefully determined magnitudes for some 300 stars using his own photometric system (mean error=0.4 mag).&lt;ref name=&quot;astro.uu.se&quot;/&gt; 

Celsius was the first to perform and publish careful experiments aiming at the definition of an international [[temperature]] [[Celsius|scale]] on scientific grounds. In his Swedish paper &quot;Observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer&quot; he reports on experiments to check that the freezing point is independent of latitude (and of atmospheric pressure). He determined the dependence of the boiling of water with atmospheric pressure which was accurate even by modern day standards. He further gave a rule for the determination of the boiling point if the barometric pressure deviates from a certain standard pressure.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.astro.uu.se/history/celsius_scale.html History of the Celsius temperature scale]&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the Celsius temperature scale in a paper to the [[Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala]], the oldest Swedish scientific society, founded in 1710. His thermometer was calibrated with a value of 100° for the freezing point of water and 0° for the boiling point. In 1745, a year after his death, the scale was reversed by [[Carl Linnaeus]] to facilitate more practical measurement.&lt;ref name=reversed&gt;[http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/6_32.html Linnaeus' thermometer]&lt;/ref&gt; Celsius originally called his scale centigrade derived from the Latin for &quot;hundred steps&quot;. For years it was simply referred to as the Swedish thermometer. 
[[Image:UppsalaCelsiusObservatory Busser.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The observatory of Anders Celsius, from a contemporary engraving.]] 
Celsius conducted many geographical measurements for the Swedish General map, and was one of earliest to note that much of Scandinavia is slowly rising above sea level, a continuous process which has been occurring since the  melting of the ice from the latest [[ice age]]. However he wrongly posed the notion that the water was [[evaporating]].&lt;ref name=&quot;astro.uu.se&quot;/&gt;

In 1725 he became secretary of the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, and served at this post until his death from tuberculosis in 1744. He supported the formation of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in [[Stockholm]] in 1739 by Linnaeus and five others, and was elected a member at the first meeting of this academy. It was in fact Celsius who proposed the new academy's name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfcl/0071.html Nordisk familjebok, volume 32 (1921): Vetenskapsakademin] {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adam Carolla''' (born May 27, 1964) is an [[United States|American]] [[radio personality]], [[television host]], [[comedian]], and [[actor]]. He currently hosts ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (podcast)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'', a [[talk show]] distributed as a [[podcast]] on the [[ACE Broadcasting Network]].

Carolla is also known as being the co-host of the radio show ''[[Loveline]]'' from 1995 to 2005 (and its television incarnation on [[MTV]] from 1996 to 2000), as the co-host of the television program ''[[The Man Show]]'' (1999–2004), and as the co-creator and performer on the television program ''[[Crank Yankers]]'' (2002–2007).

In November 2010 Carolla's book ''In Fifty Years We'll All Be Chicks'' debuted on the [[New York Times Best Seller List]] for hardcover non-fiction.

==Early life==
Carolla was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Matt Lewis (political blogger)|]] [http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/11/15/podcast-adam-carolla-on-the-matt-lewis-show/ Podcast], ''Politics Daily'', 15 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.improv.com/Comedian/Adam-Carolla&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Per [[California Birth Index]] [http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/calbirths?c=search&amp;first=Adam&amp;last=Carolla&amp;spelling=Exact&amp;4_year=&amp;4_month=0&amp;4_day=0&amp;5=&amp;7=&amp;SubmitSearch.x=21&amp;SubmitSearch.y=19&amp;SubmitSearch=Submit]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004805/bio Biography page] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; to an [[Italian-American]] father, Jim Carolla, a psychologist; and his mother, Kris ([[née]] Novello), a perpetually out-of-work welfare recipient with a degree in Chicano studies.&lt;ref&gt;''The Adam Carolla Show'', 27 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Adam's parents did not give him a middle name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Adam with Leanne Tweeden, Dr. Gadget, Jimmy Kimmel, Kenny Morse, and Cle “Bone” Sloan – February 14, 2007 | work = The Official Adam Carolla Show Blog | date = 2007-02-14 | url = http://adamradio.wordpress.com/2007/02/14/adam-with-leanne-tweeden-dr-gadget-jimmy-kimmel-kenny-morse-and-cle-%E2%80%9Cbone%E2%80%9D-sloan-%E2%80%93-february-14-2007/ | accessdate = 2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a joke, he wrote &quot;Adam Lakers Carolla&quot; on his driver's license application.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adamradio.wordpress.com/2006/02/16/adam-with-mark-burnett-rick-fox-finesse-mitchell/ |title=Adam with Mark Burnett, Rick Fox, Finesse Mitchell |accessdate=2008-08-10 |date=2006-12-16 |work=The Official Adam Carolla Show Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt; His driver's license still gives his full name as &quot;Adam Lakers Carolla.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

Adam was raised in [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|North Hollywood]], Los Angeles. He attended Colfax Elementary School,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lausd.k12.ca.us/Colfax_EL/ Colfax Charter Elementary School Home Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Reed Middle School|Walter Reed Junior High]], and [[North Hollywood High School]]. Carolla did not receive his high school diploma until years later, claiming he owed the library $19.95 for a copy of ''We The People'' (ISBN 0-385-41903-1).&lt;ref name=&quot;2003-04-01&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = 1 April 2003 | series = Loveline | serieslink = Loveline | airdate = 2003-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolla can be seen paying off the book to receive his diploma in an episode of his TLC show, The Adam Carolla Project.

During his earlier years, Carolla played [[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]] [[American football|football]] for seven years; he later suggested that being involved in sports saved him from a chaotic home life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adamradio.wordpress.com/2006/10/11/adam-with-kurt-busch-shawn-merriman-and-mistress-melissa/ |title=Adam with Kurt Busch, Shawn Merriman and Mistress Melissa |accessdate=2008-08-10 |date=2006-10-11 |work=The Official Adam Carolla Show Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his senior year at North Hollywood High School, Carolla distinguished himself in football. In December 1981, he was named to the First Team Offensive Line, Central Valley Conference, one of 12 conferences at the time in the Southern Section of the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF-SS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/HELMS/Football/CIFFOOTBALL1981.PDF California Interscholastic Federation Football 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; 

He began living on his own at the age of 18. He briefly attended [[Los Angeles Valley College]], a [[junior college]], where he was placed on academic probation before dropping out to work in a series of jobs, including carpet cleaner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allamericanspeakers.com/newspeakerbio/2358/index.php |title=Biography of Adam Carolla |accessdate=2008-08-10 |work=All American Speakers }}&lt;/ref&gt; carpenter, boxing instructor,&lt;ref name=&quot;bankrate.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/investing/20060103c1.asp|title=Fame &amp; Fortune: Comedian Adam Carolla| date=3 January 2006 |accessdate=2008-02-20| last=Getlin| first=Larry| publisher=bankrate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[traffic school]] instructor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004805/bio |title=Biography for Adam Carolla |accessdate=2008-08-10 |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although broke, Carolla and his friends and roommates owned a 1963 [[Cadillac]] [[limousine]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[CarCast]]'' episode 241: Pebble Beach auctions&lt;/ref&gt;

Carolla's step-grandfather was [[László Görög]], who wrote ''[[The Mole People (film)|The Mole People]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamcarolla.com/ACPBlog/2010/10/01/morgan-spurlock-2/|title=Adam with Morgan Spurlock| accessdate=2010-10-22|date=2010-10-01|work=[[The Adam Carolla Podcast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
===Loveline===
{{Main|Loveline}}
{{Original research|date=February 2008}}
Carolla was offered the job of co-hosting ''[[Loveline]]'' with physician [[Dr. Drew Pinsky]] in 1995, alongside [[Riki Rachtman]]. Common topics included incessant radio weather and traffic reports (&quot;How many traffic reports have you listened to? Thousands. How many times have you actually changed your route based on a traffic report? That's right! Never!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://loveline-archive.info/loveline/2003/Loveline%20-%202003-08-18.mp3&lt;/ref&gt;). Carolla held the co-hosting job until 2005.

On May 13, 2009, Adam returned to ''Loveline'' as a guest. During a typical discourse with a caller that was giving short, unaccommodating responses, Carolla snapped jokingly &quot;Oh, Jesus Christ, I don't miss this God-damn show one second!&quot; Adam said being on Loveline was like &quot;visiting your grandfather at the morgue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin and Bean, 2009-05-15&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Adam Carolla Show===
{{Main|The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio)}}
On Nov. 1, 2005, Carolla announced he would leave ''Loveline'' to pursue a position in morning radio, replacing [[Howard Stern]]&amp;mdash;with Stern's approval{{citation needed|date=April 2011|reason=why would this matter if Stern was gone?}}&amp;mdash;in a number of West Coast markets. Adam's last night on ''Loveline'' was Nov. 3, 2005, to allow him time to prepare for his morning debut in January 2006. He stated that he'd love to continue to do Loveline by recording it immediately after his morning show, but Westwood One insisted that the show must be broadcast live. On Oct. 25, [[Infinity Broadcasting]] officially announced that it would be replacing Stern with Carolla on several radio stations in the [[West Coast of the United States|western United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday0&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-10-25-stern-replacements_x.htm|title=Infinity signs Roth and Carolla|date=2005-10-25|accessdate=2008-02-21|last=Thomas|first=Karen|publisher=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Feb. 18, 2009, [[The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio)|The Adam Carolla Show]] was canceled as part of a format switch at [[KLSX]] to AMP FM, a new top 40 station. The final show was Friday, Feb. 20, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;ocreg&quot;&gt;[http://www.ocregister.com/articles/cbs-radio-amp-2311999-jack-format KLSX will drop talk radio format to play Top 40 music | cbs, radio, amp, jack, format - Entertainment - OCRegister.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 10, 2011, Adam revealed that he recently declined a 3 year, multimillion-dollar national radio syndication deal, including TV simulcast, in order to keep doing the podcast&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adamcarolla.com/ACPBlog/2011/05/10/tim-daly/ Adam Carolla Podcast, May 10, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Controversy==
In late 2003, Carolla stirred up controversy when he stated on the air during ''[[Loveline]]'' that [[Hawaii]]ans are &quot;dumb.&quot; Carolla further elaborated that Hawaiians are &quot;stupid,&quot; &quot;[[inbreeding|in-bred]],&quot; &quot;retarded&quot; people who are among the &quot;dumbest people we have.&quot; These comments were met with anger in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Cataluna, Lee.

On the April 4, 2010 episode of ''[[The Adam Carolla Show]]'', Carolla referred to Filipino boxer [[Manny Pacquiao]] as being illiterate, having [[brain damage]], and being someone who prays to chicken bones.&lt;ref name=pacquiao1&gt;{{Cite news   | last = | first = | coauthors =   | title = US comedian calls Pacquiao 'illiterate', bashes Pinoys | newspaper = ABS-CBN  | location =Manila, Philippines  | pages =   | publisher =   | date = 4 April 2010  | url = http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/04/04/10/us-comedian-calls-pacquiao-illiterate-bashes-pinoys | accessdate = 24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued by describing the Philippines, where Pacquiao makes his home, saying, &quot;They got this and [[sex tourism|sex tours]], that's all they have over there.

Filipino leaders, including the office of President [[Gloria Arroyo]], responded to the incident.&lt;ref name=pacquiao1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pacquiao2 /&gt; Carolla later apologized via [[Twitter]], saying, &quot;Read your comments. Sorry if I offended many of you. I don't preplan my commentary. I try to be provocative [and] funny but I crossed the line and I'm sorry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carolla, Adam.

==Television==
Carolla began his first original television series with ''[[The Man Show]]'', along with partner and close friend [[Jimmy Kimmel]], on [[Comedy Central]] from 1999 to 2003. He left ''The Man Show'' at the same time as Kimmel, after having been reportedly offered $50,000 per episode to stay on. Carolla has continued his work with Kimmel as a writer and guest on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]]''. With partner [[Daniel Kellison]], they are the heads of [[Jackhole Productions]] and created another television show named ''[[Crank Yankers]]'' for Comedy Central, which revived the Mr. Birchum character.

Carolla has also done [[voiceover]]s for [[cartoon]]s, including [[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command#Other personnel|Commander Nebula]] on the [[Disney Channel|Disney]] animated series ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'', [[Death (personification)|Death]] on ''[[Family Guy]]'' (replacing [[Norm Macdonald]] who only did one episode) and [[Spanky Ham]] on ''[[Drawn Together]]''.

From August 2005 to November 2005, Carolla hosted the talk show ''[[Too Late with Adam Carolla]]'' on Comedy Central.

Also in 2005, Carolla was featured in a home remodeling program called ''[[The Adam Carolla Project]]'' wherein he and a crew of old friends renovated his childhood home. The 13 episodes aired on the cable channel TLC (The Learning Channel) from October through December 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/11/20/REG7IFO80R1.DTL|title=Adam Carolla selling TV series house|date=2005-11-20|accessdate=2008-02-21|last=Ryon|first=Ruth|publisher=sfgate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epguides.com/AdamCarollaProject/ |title=The Adam Carolla Project |accessdate=2008-08-10 |publisher=[http://www.epguides.com/ epguides.com] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he appeared on the special summer series [[Gameshow Marathon (US TV series)|Gameshow Marathon]] as a celebrity panelist on the [[Match Game]] episode.

On the February 18, 2008 broadcast of his radio show, Adam announced that he would be one of the contestants on the next season of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''. Later in the broadcast, it was revealed to Adam that his partner would be [[Julianne Hough]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ew.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20178686,00.html?iid=top25-20080220-''Dancing+With+the+Stars''+announces+lineup|title=Dancing With The Stars announces lineup|date=2008-02-18|accessdate=2008-02-20|last=Bruno|first=Mike|publisher=ew.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was voted off on the April 8, 2008 episode after his performance of the [[Paso Doble]].

On June 16, 2008 Carolla was selected to host a pilot&lt;ref&gt;The Adam Carolla Show, June 12, 2008 makes it clear Adam is the host and has chosen two &quot;sidekicks&quot;.{{Verify source|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; of an American version of the popular [[BBC]] show [[Top Gear (U.S. TV series)|Top Gear]] for [[NBC]]. [[NBC]] declined to pick up the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jalopnik.com/5108040/nbc-cuts-top-gear-usa-due-to-knight-rider-failure/ NBC Cuts Top Gear USA Due To Knight Rider Failure - Top Gear USA - Jalopnik&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the February 13, 2010 episode of Carolla's [http://www.adamcarolla.com/CarCastBlog/2010/02/13/adams-miura/ CarCast] podcast, Adam broke the news that The History Channel has picked up Top Gear US. On the March 26, 2010 episode of CarCast, Carolla stated that he will not be co-hosting Top Gear US because of scheduling conflicts with his NBC project, which was then not picked up.

On February 21, 2009, a day after his Los Angeles-based morning radio show was canceled&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; as part of a format change at KLSX-FM&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; CBS ordered a comedy pilot starring the actor/comedian. &quot;[[Ace in the Hole (TV series)|Ace in the Hole]]&quot; stars Carolla as a husband and father who works as a driving instructor. Carolla created and wrote the pilot with Kevin Hench (&quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1310001181.html?categoryId=14&amp;cs=1 |title=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1310001181.html?categoryId=14&amp;cs=1 |author=Michael Schneider |date=2009-02-21 | work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolla stated that [[Pamela Adlon]] was to play his wife and [[Windell Middlebrooks]] of the Miller High Life commercial fame will play his best friend. During his March 30, 2009 podcast, Carolla briefly described the show as being &quot;[[All in the Family]], essentially&quot;, with Carolla playing a similar role to that of [[Archie Bunker]]. On the July 23, 2009 episode of the Adam Carolla Podcast, Carolla announced that CBS was not picking up the pilot for the 2009 season, &quot;in any way, shape or form.&quot;

On October 22, 2009, it was reported in ''Variety'' that Carolla had struck a deal with NBC to produce a half-hour pilot for a sitcom. The report was later confirmed on January 4, 2010, and was the first comedy pilot ordered by NBC for the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6040D820100105 | work=Reuters | title=NBC picks up Adam Carolla pilot | date=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The untitled project, written by Carolla and Kevin Hench, was a single-camera endeavor that starred Carolla as a contractor and father who attempts to rebuild his life after his wife leaves him.&lt;ref name=&quot;hollywood reporter&quot;&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3iff920e6ff97162ae79890259acd6c9fa&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;variety&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118013310.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Adam Carolla lands NBC pilot | first=Michael | last=Schneider | date=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carolla was set to executive produce the project along with frequent collaborators Kimmel and Hench, as well as his agent James &quot;Babydoll&quot; Dixon, Jon Pollack from &quot;30 Rock,&quot; Gail Berman, Daniel Kellison, and Lloyd Braun. Universal Media Studios, BermanBraun, and Carolla and Jimmy Kimmel's own Jackhole Industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;hollywood reporter&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;variety&quot; /&gt;

As of June 2010, Carolla claims that his NBC pilot has not been picked up, and is now &quot;dead.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://laist.com/2010/06/11/adam_carolla_talks_about_talking.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
In 2006, Carolla finished work on ''[[The Hammer (film)|The Hammer]]'', a semi-autobiographical [[independent film]] he co-wrote and co-produced, in which he stars opposite [[Heather Juergensen]]. The film is based loosely on his own life and is filmed at a gym he helped build with his co-star, Ozzie, played by [[Oswaldo Castillo]], his friend in real life whom he met while building the gym when they both worked in construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=New boxing movie, celebs' fight-Derby dilemma, more | date= 2007-05-03| publisher= | url =http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/arash_markazi/05/02/adam.carolla/index.html | work =SportsIllustrated.com | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-06 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film made its [[world premiere]] at the 2007 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in [[New York City]] and shortly thereafter received a positive review in Variety.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI&quot; /&gt; The film was released on March 21, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Hammer (2007) | publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]] | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814130/  | accessdate = 2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Hammer - Official Site | url = http://www.thehammermovie.com/ | accessdate = 2008-08-09}}{{Dead link|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toronto.com/movies/movie/597827{{Citation broken|date=May 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The film is rated 69% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

Adam made a short appearance in [[Jeff Balis]]' ''[[Still Waiting...]]'' (a sequel to ''[[Waiting... (film)|Waiting...]]'') playing a pick-up artist guru.

Adam helped write an unproduced screenplay for a movie entitled [[Deaf Frat Guy: Showdown at Havasu]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Carolla interview on Leo The Film Freak, 2008-06-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the voice of Virgil in the independent short film ''[[Save Virgil]]''.

==Non-fiction writing: ''In Fifty Years We'll All Be Chicks''==
On November 4, 2010, Adam Carolla's ''In Fifty Years We'll All Be Chicks... And Other Complaints from an Angry Middle-Aged White Guy'' was released by publisher Crown Publishing. Carolla dictated the text, but the book itself was [[ghost writer|ghost written]] by Mike Lynch.&lt;ref&gt;http://castroller.com/podcasts/AdamCarollaPodcast/1920166-Book%20Talk%20w/%20Mike%20Lynch&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On September 28, 2002, Carolla married Lynette Paradise. Lynette gave birth to their first children, twins Natalia and Santino &quot;Sonny&quot; Richard Carolla on June 7, 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;people.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,1201577,00.html|title=Adam Carolla, Wife Welcome Twins|date=2006-06-07|accessdate=2008-02-20|last=White|first=Nicholas|publisher=[[people.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'', Adam repeatedly mentioned the birth was originally scheduled for June 6, but that he and Lynette decided to push it back one day as to avoid the symbolic [[Number of the Beast|666]] ([[June 2006#6 June 2006|06-06-06]]).

Regarding his religious beliefs, Carolla has stated, &quot;I am not agnostic. I am atheist. I don’t think there is no God; I know there’s no God. I know there’s no God the same way I know many other laws in our universe. I know there’s no God and I know most of the world knows that as well. They just won’t admit it because there’s another thing they know: they know they’re going to die, and it freaks them out. So most people don’t have the courage to admit there’s no God and they know it. They feel it. They try to suppress it. And if you bring it up they get angry because it freaks them out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wordpress2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQMQxJKKjcU &quot;Adam Carolla on Religion&quot; YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his political beliefs, Carolla has [[Libertarian]] leanings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urdV5DwT4Ns&lt;/ref&gt; Carolla has stated, &quot;I guess I would be Republican, in the sense that I want a secure border, I'm not into the welfare state, I'm not into all those freebie lunch programs. It just kind of demeans people.&quot; He goes on to state, however, that he is also in favor of some traditionally &quot;liberal&quot; causes such as the legalization of marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popeater.com/2010/11/05/adam-carolla-interview-book/&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere he has stated that &quot;My feeling is this whole country is founded on the principle of 'if you are not hurting anyone, and you're not fucking with someone else's shit, and you are paying your taxes, you should be able to just do what you want to do.'  It's the freedom and the independence.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adamcarolla.com/ACPBlog/2010/04/19/adam-with-cheech-and-chong/ &quot;Adam Carolla with Cheech and Chong&quot; Podcast]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Acf new.svg|thumb|right|A plot showing 100 random numbers with a &quot;hidden&quot; [[sine]] function, and an autocorrelation ([[correlogram]]) of the series on the bottom.]]
'''Autocorrelation''' is the [[cross-correlation]] of a signal with itself. Informally, it is the similarity between observations as a function of the time separation between them. It is a mathematical tool for finding repeating patterns, such as the presence of a periodic signal which has been buried under noise, or identifying the [[missing fundamental]] frequency in a signal implied by its [[harmonic]] frequencies.  It is often used in [[signal processing]] for analyzing functions or series of values, such as [[time domain]] [[signal (information theory)|signals]].

== Definitions ==

Different fields of study define autocorrelation differently, and not all of these definitions are equivalent.  In some fields, the term is used interchangeably with [[autocovariance]].

=== Statistics ===
In [[statistics]], the autocorrelation of a [[random process]] describes the [[correlation]] between values of the process at different points in time, as a function of the two times or of the time difference. Let ''X'' be some repeatable process, and ''i'' be some point in time after the start of that process. (''i'' may be an [[integer]] for a [[discrete-time]] process or a [[real number]] for a [[continuous-time]] process.) Then ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the value (or [[Realization (probability)|realization]]) produced by a given [[Execution (computing)|run]] of the process at time ''i''. Suppose that the process is further known to have defined values for [[mean]] ''μ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and [[variance]] ''σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' for all times ''i''. Then the definition of the autocorrelation between any two time ''s'' and ''t'' is

:&lt;math&gt;
R(s,t) = \frac{\operatorname{E}[(X_t - \mu_t)(X_s - \mu_s)]}{\sigma_t\sigma_s}\, ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &quot;E&quot; is the [[expected value]] operator.  Note that this expression is not well-defined for all time series or processes, because the variance may be zero (for a constant process) or infinite.  If the function ''R'' is well-defined, its value must lie in the range [&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;1], with 1 indicating perfect correlation and &amp;minus;1 indicating perfect [[anti-correlation]]. &lt;!--Maybe we should put all definitions of variables next to the equations so that people know what we're talking about.--&gt;

If ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[stationary process#Second-order_stationarity|second-order stationary process]] then the mean ''μ'' and the variance ''σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' are time-independent, and further the autocorrelation depends only on the difference between ''t'' and ''s'': the correlation depends only on the time-distance between the pair of values but not on their position in time. This further implies that the autocorrelation can be expressed as a function of the time-lag, and that this would be an [[Even and odd functions|even function]] of the lag  τ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''t''.  This gives the more familiar form

:&lt;math&gt;
R(\tau) = \frac{\operatorname{E}[(X_t - \mu)(X_{t+\tau} - \mu)]}{\sigma^2}, \,
&lt;/math&gt;

and the fact that this is an [[Even_and_odd_functions#Even_functions|even function]] can be stated as
:&lt;math&gt;
R(\tau) = R(-\tau).\,
&lt;/math&gt;

It is common practice in some disciplines, other than statistics and [[time series analysis]], to drop the normalization by ''σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' and use the term &quot;autocorrelation&quot; interchangeably with &quot;autocovariance&quot;. However, the normalization is important both because the interpretation of the autocorrelation as a correlation provides a scale-free measure of the strength of [[statistical dependence]], and because the normalization has an effect on the statistical properties of the estimated autocorrelations.

=== Signal processing ===

In [[signal processing]], the above definition is often used without the normalization, that is, without subtracting the mean and dividing by the variance.  When the autocorrelation function is normalized by mean and variance, it is sometimes referred to as the '''autocorrelation coefficient'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;dunn&quot;&gt;Patrick F. Dunn, ''Measurement and Data Analysis for Engineering and Science,'' New York: McGraw–Hill, 2005 ISBN 0-07-282538-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Given a [[signal]] &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the continuous autocorrelation &lt;math&gt;R_{ff}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; is most often defined as the continuous cross-correlation integral of &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; with itself, at lag &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;R_{ff}(\tau) = (f(t) * \overline{f}(-t))(\tau) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t+\tau)\overline{f}(t)\, {\rm d}t = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t)\overline{f}(t-\tau)\, {\rm d}t&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[complex conjugate]] and &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; represents [[convolution]].  For a [[real function]], &lt;math&gt;\overline{f} = f&lt;/math&gt;.

The discrete autocorrelation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; at lag &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; for a discrete signal &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;R_{xx}(j) = \sum_n x_n\,\overline{x}_{n-j}.&lt;/math&gt;

The above definitions work for signals that are square integrable, or square summable, that is, of finite energy.  Signals that &quot;last forever&quot; are treated instead as random processes, in which case different definitions are needed, based on expected values.  For [[stationary process|wide-sense-stationary random processes]], the autocorrelations are defined as

:&lt;math&gt;R_{ff}(\tau) = \operatorname{E}\left[f(t)\overline{f}(t-\tau)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_{xx}(j) = \operatorname{E}\left[x_n\,\overline{x}_{n-j}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

For processes that are not [[Stationary process|stationary]], these will also be functions of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

For processes that are also [[Ergodic process|ergodic]], the expectation can be replaced by the limit of a time average.  The autocorrelation of an ergodic process is sometimes defined as or equated to&lt;ref name=&quot;dunn&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_{ff}(\tau) = \lim_{T \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T f(t+\tau)\overline{f}(t)\, {\rm d}t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_{xx}(j) = \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x_n\,\overline{x}_{n-j}.&lt;/math&gt;

These definitions have the advantage that they give sensible well-defined single-parameter results for periodic functions, even when those functions are not the output of stationary ergodic processes.

Alternatively, signals that ''last forever'' can be treated by a short-time autocorrelation function analysis, using finite time integrals.  (See [[short-time Fourier transform]] for a related process.)

Multi-[[dimension]]al autocorrelation is defined similarly.  For example, in [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] the autocorrelation of a square-summable [[discrete signal]] would be

:&lt;math&gt;R(j,k,\ell) = \sum_{n,q,r} x_{n,q,r}\,x_{n-j,q-k,r-\ell}.&lt;/math&gt;

When mean values are subtracted from signals before computing an autocorrelation function, the resulting function is usually called an auto-covariance function.

== Properties ==

In the following, we will describe properties of one-dimensional autocorrelations only, since most properties are easily transferred from the one-dimensional case to the multi-dimensional cases.

* A fundamental property of the autocorrelation is symmetry, &lt;math&gt;R(i) = R(-i)&lt;/math&gt;, which is easy to prove from the definition. In the continuous case,
:the autocorrelation is an [[even function]]

::&lt;math&gt;R_f(-\tau) = R_f(\tau)\,&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a real function,

:and the autocorrelation is a [[Hermitian function]]

::&lt;math&gt;R_f(-\tau) = R_f^*(\tau)\,&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a [[complex function]].

* The continuous autocorrelation function reaches its peak at the origin, where it takes a real value, i.e. for any delay &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|R_f(\tau)| \leq R_f(0)&lt;/math&gt;.  This is a consequence of the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]].  The same result holds in the discrete case.

* The autocorrelation of a [[periodic function]] is, itself, periodic with the same period.

* The autocorrelation of the sum of two completely uncorrelated functions (the cross-correlation is zero for all &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;) is the sum of the autocorrelations of each function separately.

* Since autocorrelation is a specific type of [[cross-correlation]], it maintains all the properties of cross-correlation.

* The autocorrelation of a continuous-time [[white noise]] signal will have a strong peak (represented by a [[Dirac delta function]]) at &lt;math&gt;\tau=0&lt;/math&gt; and will be absolutely 0 for all other &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

* The [[Wiener–Khinchin theorem]] relates the autocorrelation function to the [[spectral density|power spectral density]] via the [[Fourier transform]]:

::&lt;math&gt;R(\tau) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty S(f) e^{j 2 \pi f \tau} \, {\rm d}f&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;S(f) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty R(\tau) e^{- j 2 \pi f \tau} \, {\rm d}\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

* For real-valued functions, the symmetric autocorrelation function has a real symmetric transform, so the [[Wiener–Khinchin theorem]] can be re-expressed in terms of real cosines only:

::&lt;math&gt;R(\tau) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty S(f) \cos(2 \pi f \tau) \, {\rm d}f&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;S(f) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty R(\tau) \cos(2 \pi f \tau) \, {\rm d}\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

==Efficient computation==

For data expressed as a [[discrete]] sequence, it is frequently necessary to compute the autocorrelation with high [[algorithmic efficiency|computational efficiency]].  While the brute force algorithm is [[Big O notation|order]] &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;, several efficient algorithms exist which can compute the autocorrelation in order &lt;math&gt;n\,\log(n)&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, the [[Wiener–Khinchin theorem]] allows computing the autocorrelation from the raw data &lt;math&gt;X(t)&lt;/math&gt; with two [[Fast Fourier transform]]s (FFT)&lt;ref&gt;Box, G. E. P., G. M. Jenkins, and G. C. Reinsel. Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control. 3rd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice–Hall, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;F_R(f) = \text{FFT}(X(t))&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;S(f) = F_R(f) {F_R}^*(f)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;R(\tau) = \text{IFFT}(S(f))&lt;/math&gt;

where IFFT denotes the inverse [[Fast Fourier transform]]. The asterisk denotes complex conjugate.

Alternatively, a multiple &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; correlation can be performed by using brute force calculation for low &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; values, and then progressively binning the &lt;math&gt;X(t)&lt;/math&gt; data with a [[logarithm]]ic density to compute higher values, resulting in the same &lt;math&gt;n\,\log(n)&lt;/math&gt; efficiency, but with lower memory requirements.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Estimation==
For a [[discrete]] process of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; defined as &lt;math&gt;\{X_1,\,X_2,\,\ldots,\,X_n\}&lt;/math&gt; with known mean and variance, an estimate of the autocorrelation may be obtained as

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{R}(k)=\frac{1}{(n-k) \sigma^2} \sum_{t=1}^{n-k} (X_t-\mu)(X_{t+k}-\mu) &lt;/math&gt;

for any positive integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;n&lt;/math&gt;.  When the true mean &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are known, this estimate is [[Biased estimator|'''unbiased''']].  If the true mean and variance of the process are not known there are a several possibilities:
* If &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; are replaced by the standard formulae for sample mean and sample variance, then this is a [[Biased estimator|'''biased estimate''']].
* A [[periodogram]]-based estimate replaces &lt;math&gt;n-k&lt;/math&gt; in the above formula with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.  This estimate is always biased; however, it usually has a smaller mean square error.&lt;ref&gt;''Spectral analysis and time series'', M.B. Priestley (London, New York : Academic Press, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Percival | first=Donald B. | coauthors=Andrew T. Walden | title=Spectral Analysis for Physical Applications: Multitaper and Conventional Univariate Techniques | year=1993 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-43541-2 | pages=190–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Other possibilities derive from treating the two portions of data &lt;math&gt;\{X_1,\,X_2,\,\ldots,\,X_{n-k}\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{X_{k+1},\,X_2,\,\ldots,\,X_n\}&lt;/math&gt; separately and calculating separate sample means and/or sample variances for use in defining the estimate.
The advantage of estimates of the last type is that the set of estimated autocorrelations, as a function of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, then form a function which is a valid autocorrelation in the sense that it is possible to define a theoretical process having exactly that autocorrelation. Other estimates can suffer from the problem that, if they are used to calculate the variance of a linear combination of the &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;'s, the variance calculated may turn out to be negative. &lt;!--and how is this a problem?--&gt;

==Regression analysis==

In [[regression analysis]] using [[time series analysis|time series data]], autocorrelation of the errors is a problem.  Autocorrelation of the errors, which themselves are unobserved, can generally be detected because it produces autocorrelation in the observable [[Errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]].  (Errors are also known as &quot;error terms&quot;, in [[econometrics]].)

Autocorrelation violates the ordinary least squares (OLS) assumption that the error terms are uncorrelated.  While it does not bias the OLS coefficient estimates, the standard errors tend to be underestimated (and the [[T-statistics|t-scores]] overestimated) when the autocorrelations of the errors at low lags are positive.

The traditional test for the presence of first-order autocorrelation is the [[Durbin–Watson statistic]] or, if the explanatory variables include a lagged dependent variable, [[Durbin–Watson statistic#Durbin h-statistic|Durbin's h statistic]].  A more flexible test, covering autocorrelation of higher orders and applicable whether or not the regressors include lags of the dependent variable, is the [[Breusch–Godfrey test]].  This involves an auxiliary regression, wherein the residuals obtained from estimating the model of interest are regressed on (a) the original regressors and (b) ''k'' lags of the residuals, where ''k'' is the order of the test.  The simplest version of the test statistic from this
auxiliary regression is ''TR''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''T'' is the sample size and ''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[coefficient of determination]].  Under the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation, this statistic is
asymptotically distributed as &lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt; with ''k'' degrees of freedom.

Responses to nonzero autocorrelation include [[generalized least squares]] and the [[Newey West|Newey–West HAC estimator]] (Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = An Introduction to Modern Econometrics Using Stata | author = Christopher F. Baum | url = http://books.google.com/?id=acxtAylXvGMC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=newey-west-standard-errors+generalized-least-squares | publisher = Stata Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 1597180130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

* One application of autocorrelation is the measurement of [[optical spectrum|optical spectra]] and the measurement of very-short-duration [[light]] [[ultrashort pulse|pulses]] produced by [[laser]]s, both using [[optical autocorrelation|optical autocorrelators]].

* For measuring [[particle size distribution]]s of very fine particles or [[micelle]]s suspended in a fluid. A laser shining into the mixture produces flicker, which correlates with the motion of the particles. Autocorrelation of the signal gives a picture of the diffusion speeds of the particles. From this, knowing the viscosity of the fluid, the sizes of the particles can be calculated.

* In optics, normalized autocorrelations and cross-correlations give the [[degree of coherence]] of an electromagnetic field.

* In [[signal processing]], autocorrelation can give information about repeating events like [[music]]al [[Beat (music)|beat]]s (for example, to determine [[tempo]]) or [[pulsar]] [[frequency|frequencies]], though it cannot tell the position in time of the beat. It can also be used to [[Pitch detection algorithm|estimate the pitch of a musical tone]].

* In [[Music Recording|music recording]], autocorrelation is used as a [[pitch detection algorithm]] prior to vocal processing, as a distortion effect or to eliminate undesired mistakes and inaccuracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

* Autocorrelation in space rather than time, via the [[Patterson function]], is used by X-ray diffractionists to help recover the &quot;Fourier phase information&quot; on atom positions not available through diffraction alone.

* In statistics, spatial autocorrelation between sample locations also helps one estimate [[Variance#Generalizations|mean value uncertainties]] when sampling a heterogeneous population.

* The [[SEQUEST]] algorithm for analyzing [[Mass spectrum|mass spectra]] makes use of autocorrelation in conjunction with [[cross-correlation]] to score the similarity of an observed spectrum to an idealized spectrum representing a [[peptide]].
* In [[Astrophysics]], auto-correlation is used to study and characterize the spatial distribution of [[galaxies]] in the Universe and in multi-wavelength observations of Low Mass X-ray Binaries.

* In [[panel data]], spatial autocorrelation refers to correlation of a variable with itself through space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Atlas Autocode''' (AA) was a [[programming language]] developed around 1965 at [[Manchester University]] for the [[Atlas Computer]]. It was developed by Tony Brooker and Derrick Morris as an improvement on the [[ALGOL]] [[programming language]]s, removing some of Algol's poorer features such as &quot;passing parameters by name&quot; (which with Algol 60 meant not its usual meaning but passing the address of a short subroutine to recalculate the parameter each time it was mentioned). It featured explicitly typed variables, subroutines, and functions. The AA compiler generated range-checking for array accesses, and allowed an array to have dimensions that were determined at run-time (i.e. you could declare an array as &lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;integer&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;array&lt;/u&gt; Thing (i:j)&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; were calculated values). Direct [[machine code|machine coding]] was allowed.

Atlas Autocode included a &lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;complex&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt; data type which would support [[complex number]]s (which comprise a [[Real number|real]] part, and an [[Imaginary number|imaginary]] part which is a multiple of the [[square root of -1]]), partly because of pressure from the [[electrical engineering]] department, as complex numbers are used to represent the behavior of [[alternating current]]. The square root of -1 was represented by &lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which was treated as a fixed complex constant = ''i''. 

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;complex&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt; data type was dropped when Atlas Autocode later morphed into the [[Edinburgh IMP]] programming language.  (Imp was an extension of AA and was notable for being used to write the [[Edinburgh Multiple Access System|EMAS]] [[operating system]].)

Keywords in AA were distinguishable from other text by being underlined; there was also an &quot;uppercasedelimiters&quot; mode where all uppercase letters (outside strings) were treated as underlined lowercase.

In some versions (but not in the original Atlas version), for the sake of easy typing it was possible to [[Stropping (syntax)|strop keywords]] by placing a &quot;&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;&quot; sign in front of them, for example the keyword &lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;endofprogramme&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt; could be typed as &lt;code&gt;%end %of %programme&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;%endofprogramme&lt;/code&gt;

There were no reserved words in the language as keywords were identified by underlining, not by recognising reserved character sequences. In the statement &lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;if&lt;/u&gt; token=if &lt;u&gt;then&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;result&lt;/u&gt; = token&lt;/code&gt;, there is both a keyword &lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;if&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and a variable named &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;.

Because of this keyword stropping, it was possible for AA to allow spaces in variable names, such as &lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;integer&lt;/u&gt; previous value&lt;/code&gt;.  Spaces were not significant and were removed prior to parsing in a trivial pre-lexing stage called &quot;line reconstruction&quot;. What the compiler would see in the above example would be &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;if&lt;/u&gt;token=if&lt;u&gt;thenresult&lt;/u&gt;=token&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.

The syntax for expressions let the multiplication operator be omitted, e.g. &lt;code&gt;3a&lt;/code&gt; was treated as &lt;code&gt;3*a&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;a(i+j)&lt;/code&gt; was treated as &lt;code&gt;a*(i+j)&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; was not an array. In ambiguous usages, the longest possible name was taken, for example &lt;code&gt;ab&lt;/code&gt; was not treated as &lt;code&gt;a*b&lt;/code&gt;, whether or not &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; had been declared.

Atlas Autocode's syntax was influenced by the output device which the author had available, a [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]] [[Flexowriter]].  Consequently it allowed symbols like &quot;½&quot; for &quot;.5&quot; and the superscript &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for &quot;to the power of 2&quot;.  The flexowriter supported overstriking and therefore AA did as well - up to three characters could be overstruck as a single symbol.  For example the character set had no &quot;↑&quot; symbol, so exponentiation was an overstrike of &quot;|&quot; and &quot;*&quot;.  (The underlining of keywords mentioned above could also be done using overstriking.)  The language is described in detail in the [http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/docs/atlasautocode.html Atlas Autocode Reference Manual].

Other Flexowriter characters that were found a use in Atlas Autocode were: &lt;code&gt;α&lt;/code&gt; in floating-point numbers, e.g. &lt;code&gt;3.56α-7&lt;/code&gt; for modern &lt;code&gt;3.56e-7&lt;/code&gt; ; &lt;code&gt;β&lt;/code&gt; to mean &quot;the second half of an Atlas memory [[Word (data type)|word]]&quot;; &lt;code&gt;π&lt;/code&gt; for the mathematical [[pi]] number.

When AA was ported to the [[English Electric KDF9]] computer, the character set was changed to [[ISO]] and that compiler has been recovered from an old paper tape by the [http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/ Edinburgh Computer History Project] and is available online, as is a high-quality scan of the original Atlas Autocode manual.

Atlas Autocode's second-greatest claim to fame (after being the progenitor of Imp and EMAS) was that it had many of the features of the original &quot;[[Compiler-compiler|Compiler Compiler]]&quot;.  A variant of the AA compiler included run-time support for a top-down [[recursive descent parser]].  The style of parser used in the Compiler Compiler was in use continuously at Edinburgh from the 60's until almost the turn of the millennium.

Other [[Autocode]]s were developed for the [[Titan (computer)]] (a prototype Atlas 2) at Cambridge and the [[Ferranti]] Mercury.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arthur J. Stone''' (1847–1938), a leading American silversmith, was born, trained and worked in [[Sheffield]], England, and [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], before travelling to the United States in 1884. He was one of the last silversmiths in America to train apprentices to carry out designs in hand-wrought silver. In 1901, Stone set up a workshop in [[Gardner]], [[Massachusetts]] which operated under his name until its sale in 1937 to Henry Heywood. Heywood was a Gardner businessman, who renamed it The Stone Silver Shop, and later, Stone Associates. Heywood died in 1945. His sons Henry, Jr. and Jerome ran Stone Associates until 1957.

One of the silversmiths in Arthur Stone's shop was George Porter Blanchard, father of silversmith [[Porter Blanchard]].

The '''Au file format''' is a simple [[audio file format]] introduced by [[Sun Microsystems]]. The format was common on [[NeXT]] systems and on early Web pages. Originally it was headerless, being simply 8-bit [[mu-law|µ-law]]-encoded data at an 8000&amp;nbsp;Hz sample rate. Hardware from other vendors often used sample rates as high as 8192&amp;nbsp;Hz, often integer factors of video clock signals. Newer files have a header that consists of six [[Signedness|unsigned]] [[32-bit]] words, an optional information chunk and then the data (in [[big endian]] format).

Although the format now supports many [[digital audio|audio encoding]] formats, it remains associated with the [[mu-law|µ-law]] logarithmic encoding. This encoding was native to the [[SPARCstation 1]] hardware, where [[SunOS]] exposed the encoding to application programs through the /dev/audio interface. This encoding and interface became a [[de facto]] standard for [[Unix]] sound.

==New format==
All fields are stored in [[big-endian]] format, including the sample data.

|}

The type of encoding depends on the value of the &quot;encoding&quot; field (word 3 of the header). Formats 2 through 7 are uncompressed [[PCM]], therefore [[lossless]].  Formats 23 through 26 are ADPCM, which is a lossy, roughly 4:1 compression.  Formats 1 and 27 are [[μ-law algorithm|μ-law]] and [[A-law]], respectively, both lossy.  Several of the others are [[digital signal processing|DSP]] commands or data, designed to be processed by the [[NeXT]] [[MusicKit]] software.

Note: PCM data appear to be encoded as signed, rather than unsigned.

'''Andalusia''' ({{IPA-en|ændəˈluːʒə}}, {{IPA-en|ændəˈluːziə|}}; {{lang-es|Andalucía}}, {{IPA-es|andaluˈθi.a|pron}}; {{IPA-es|andaluˈsi.a|local}}) is an [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Spain]] and recognized as a [[nationalities and regions of Spain|nationality]] in the preamble of its new autonomy statute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2007/03/20/pdfs/A11871-11909.pdf ''Boletín Oficial del Estado'' of Spain, n. 68 of 2007/03/20, p. 11872.] Estatuto de Autonomía de Andalucía. Artículo 1: «Andalucía, como nacionalidad histórica y en el ejercicio del derecho de autogobierno que reconoce la Constitución, se constituye en Comunidad Autónoma en el marco de la unidad de la nación española y conforme al artículo 2 de la Constitución.»&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most populous (8,370,975 inhabitants in 2010)&lt;ref name=&quot;INEpob2008&quot;&gt;''[http://www.ine.es/jaxi/tabla.do Cifras de población referidas al 01/01/2009. Resumen por Comunidades Autónomas]''. [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estadística]] (Spain). Accessed 2009-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt; and the second largest, in terms of land area, of the 17 [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] of the Kingdom of Spain. Its capital and largest city is [[Seville]] (Spanish: ''Sevilla''). The region is divided into eight [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]]: [[Huelva (province)|Huelva]], [[Seville (province)|Seville]], [[Cádiz (province)|Cádiz]], [[Córdoba (Spanish province)|Córdoba]], [[Málaga (province)|Málaga]], [[Jaén (Spanish province)|Jaén]], [[Granada (province)|Granada]] and [[Almería (province)|Almería]].

Andalusia is in the south of the [[Iberian peninsula]], immediately south of the autonomous communities of [[Extremadura]] and [[Castile-La Mancha]]; west of the autonomous community of [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]; east of [[Portugal]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; and north of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], which separates Spain from [[Morocco]], and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The small [[British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]] shares a three-quarter-mile land border with the Andalusian [[province of Cádiz]] at the eastern end of the Strait of Gibraltar.

Andalusia has three major geographic subregions. In the north, the mountainous [[Sierra Morena]] separates Andalusia from the plains of Extremadura and Castile-La Mancha on Spain's [[Meseta Central]]. South of that, one can distinguish Upper Andalusia, generally the [[Baetic Cordillera]], from Lower Andalusia with its [[Baetic Depression]] of the valley of the [[Guadalquivir]].

The name Andalusia traces back to the [[Arabic language]] ''[[Al-Andalus]]''. As well as Muslim or &quot;[[Moors|Moorish]]&quot; influences, the region's history and culture have been influenced by the earlier [[Iberians]], [[Carthaginian Republic|Carthaginians]], [[Greeks]], [[Roman Empire]], [[Vandals]], [[Visigoths]], all of whom preceded the Muslims, as well as the [[Castilian people|Castilian]] and other [[Christianity|Christian]] North Iberian nationalities who conquered and repopulated the area in the latter phases of the ''[[Reconquista]]''. There was also a relatively large [[Sephardic Jew]]ish presence.

Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], Andalusia has been an economically poor region in comparison with the rest of Spain and the [[European Union]] at large. However, the growth of the community especially in the sectors of industry and services was above average in Spain and higher than many communities in the eurozone. The region has, however, a rich culture and a strong cultural identity. Many cultural phenomena that are seen internationally as distinctively Spanish are largely or entirely Andalusian in origin. These include [[flamenco]], [[Spanish-style bullfighting|bullfighting]], and certain [[Moorish architecture|Moorish-influenced]] [[Mudéjar|architectural styles]].

== The name ''Andalucía'' ==
[[File:España y Portugal (1770).jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Iberian peninsula]] dated 1770. The Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Jaén|Jaén]], [[Kingdom of Cordoba|Córdoba]] and [[Kingdom of Seville|Seville]] are collectively referred to under the name ''Andalucía'', while the [[Kingdom of Granada (Crown of Castile)|Kingdom of Granada]] appears under its individual name.]]

The Spanish toponym (place name) ''Andalucía'' (immediate source of the English ''Andalusia'') was introduced into the [[Spanish language]] in the 13th century under the form ''el Andalucía''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spain: The Andalusian Patio&quot;&gt;[http://www.thepatio.ws/the-patio-garden/spain-the-andalusian-patio Spain: The Andalusian Patio]&lt;/ref&gt; This was a Castilianization of ''Al-Andalusiya'', the [[adjective|adjectival]] form of the Arabic language ''al-Andalus'', the name of the Iberian territories under the Muslim rule from 711 to 1492. The etymology of ''al-Andalus'' is itself somewhat debated (''see'' [[al-Andalus]]), but it entered the Arabic language even before such time as this area came under Muslim rule. The Arabic name is traditionally considered a corruption of an earlier *''Vandalusia'' or ''the land of the [[Vandals]]'', the Germanic tribe that invaded Spain after the fall of the Roman Empire and set up various kingdoms in Southern Spain and North Africa. Andalusia was the center of power in medieval [[Muslim]]-dominated Iberia.

Like the Arabic term ''al-Andalus'', in historical contexts the Spanish term ''Andalucía'' or the English term ''Andalusia'' do not necessarily refer to the exact territory designated by these terms today. Initially, the term referred exclusively to territories under Muslim control; later, it was applied to some of the last Iberian Islamic territories to be conquered, though not always to exactly the same ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Estoria de España]]'' (also known as the ''[[Primera Crónica General]]'') of [[Alfonso X of Castile]], written in the second half of the 13th century, the term ''Andalucía'' is used with three different meanings:

# As a literal translation of the Arabic ''al-Ándalus'' when Arabic texts are quoted.
# To designate the territories the Christians had conquered by that time in the [[Guadalquivir]] valley and in the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Granada (Crown of Castile)|Granada]] and [[Kingdom of Murcia|Murcia]]. In a document from 1253, Alfonso X styled himself ''Rey de Castilla, León y de toda Andalucía'' (&quot;King of Castile, León and all of Andalusia&quot;).
# To designate the territories the Christians had conquered by that time in the Guadalquivir valley (the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Jaén|Jaén]], [[Kingdom of Cordoba|Córdoba]] and [[Kingdom of Seville|Seville]]) but ''not'' the Kingdom of Granada. This was the most common significance in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and [[Early modern period]].&lt;ref name=&quot;laidentidadandaluza&quot;&gt;{{cite book

From an administrative point of view, Granada remained separate for many years even after the completion of the ''Reconquista''&lt;ref name=&quot;laidentidadandaluza&quot; /&gt; due, above all, to its emblematic character as the last territory conquered, and as the seat of the important [[Audiencia Real|Real Chancillería de Granada]], a [[court of last resort]]. Still, the reconquest and repopulation of Granada was accomplished largely by people from the four existing Christian kingdoms of Andalusia, and Granada came to be considered a fourth kingdom of Andalusia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Blas Infante Tiles.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Blas Infante]], executed in [[azulejo]]s, located on the avenue in [[Jerez de la Frontera]] named in his honor.]]

The Andalusian coat of arms shows the figure of [[Hercules]] and two [[lion]]s between the two [[pillars of Hercules]] that tradition situates on either side of the Strait of Gibraltar. An inscription below, superimposed on an image of the [[flag of Andalusia]] reads ''Andalucía por sí, para España y la Humanidad'' (&quot;Andalusia by herself, for Spain and Humanity&quot;). Over the two columns is a semicircular arch in the colors of the flag of Andalusia, with the [[Latin language|Latin]] words ''Dominator Hercules Fundator'' superimposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;himno y escudo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Himno y escudo | publisher=Junta de Andalucia | url=http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/28f2009/himno.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official flag of Andalusia consists of three equal horizontal stripes, colored green, white, and green respectively;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NwvoM-ZFoAgC&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=Flag%20of%20Andalusia&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q=Flag%20of%20Andalusia&amp;f=false|title=One Europe, many nations: a historical dictionary of European national groups|last=Minahan|first=James|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313309847|pages=42–46|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Andalusian coat of arms is superimposed on the central stripe. Its design was overseen by [[Blas Infante]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Gill&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gGY2fSXko5kC&amp;lpg=PT216&amp;dq=Flag%20of%20Andalusia%20Blas%20Infante&amp;pg=PT216#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Andalucia, a cultural history|last=Gill|first=James|publisher=Oxford University Press US|page=251|isbn=9780195376104|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and approved in the [[Assembly of Ronda]] (a 1918 gathering of [[Andalusian nationalism|Andalusian nationalists]] at [[Ronda]]). The green symbolizes hope and union, and the white symbolizes peace and dialogue. Blas Infante considered these to have been the colors most used in regional symbols throughout the region's history. According to him, the green came in particular from the [[banner|standard]] of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] and represented the call for a gathering of the populace. The white symbolized pardon in the [[Almohad dynasty]], interpreted in European heraldry as parliament or peace. Other writers have justified the colors differently, with some Andalusian nationalists referring to them as the ''Arbonaida'', meaning white-and-green in [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]], a [[Romance language]] that was spoken in the region in Muslim times.

[[File:Himno de Andalucía.ogg|thumb|left|Click to hear an instrumental version of the Andalusian anthem.]]
The [[national anthem|anthem]] of Andalusia was composed by José del Castillo Díaz (director of the Municipal Band of Seville, commonly known as Maestro Castillo) with lyrics by Blas Infante.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; The music was inspired by ''Santo Dios'', a popular religious song sung at harvest time by peasants and day laborers in the provinces of Málaga, Seville, and Huelva. Blas Infante brought the song to Maestro Castillo's attention; Maestro Castillo adapted and harmonized the traditional melody. The lyrics appeal to the Andalusians to mobilize and demand ''tierra y libertad'' (&quot;land and liberty&quot;) by way of [[agrarian reform]] and a statute of autonomy within Spain.

The [[Parliament of Andalusia]] voted unanimously in 1983 that the preamble to the [[Statute of Autonomy of Andalusia|Statute of Autonomy]] recognize Blas Infante as the Father of the Andalusian Nation (''Padre de la Patria Andaluza''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gCIcK3DIsIYC&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=Padre%20del%20Patria%20Blas%20Infante&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q=Padre%20del%20Patria%20Blas%20Infante&amp;f=false|title=La casa de Blas Infante en Coria del Río|publisher=Centro de Estudios Andaluces|last=Fernandez-Montesinas|first=Alberto Egea|isbn=9788460925453}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was reaffirmed in the reformed Statute of Autonomy submitted to popular [[referendum]] February 18, 2007. The preamble of the present 2007 Statute of Autonomy says that Article 2 of the present [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] recognizes Andalusia as a [[Nationalities and regions of Spain|nationality]]. Later, in its articulation, it speaks of Andalusia as a &quot;historic nationality&quot; (Spanish: ''nacionalidad histórica''). It also cites the 1919 Andalusianist Manifesto of Córdoba describing Andalusia as a &quot;national reality&quot; (''realidad nacional''), but does not endorse that formulation. Article 1 of the earlier 1981 Statute of Autonomy defined it simply as a &quot;nationality&quot; (''nacionalidad'').&lt;ref name=&quot;citing 1919&quot;&gt;''El Manifiesto andalucista de Córdoba describió a Andalucía como realidad nacional en 1919, cuyo espíritu los andaluces encauzaron plenamente a través del proceso de autogobierno recogido en nuestra Carta Magna. En 1978 los andaluces dieron un amplio respaldo al consenso constitucional. Hoy, la Constitución, en su artículo 2, reconoce a Andalucía como una nacionalidad en el marco de la unidad indisoluble de la nación española.'' [[:s:Estatuto de Autonomía de Andalucía 2007|Andalusian Statute of Autonomy on Wikisource]], in Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The regional holiday, the [[Día de Andalucía]], is celebrated on February 28,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PuEo8-2KOf0C&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=D%C3%ADa%20de%20Andaluc%C3%ADa&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q=D%C3%ADa%20de%20Andaluc%C3%ADa&amp;f=false|title=Andalucia|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2007|last1=Noble|first1=John|last2=Forsyth|first2=Susan|last3=Maric|first3=Vesna|page=77|isbn=9781740599733|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commemorates the 1980 autonomy referendum. 

The honorific title of ''[[Hijo Predilecto de Andalucía]]'' (&quot;Favorite Son of Andalucia&quot;) is granted by the Junta of Andalusia to those whose exceptional merits benefited Andalusia, for work or achievements in natural, social, or political science. It is the highest distinction given by the Autonomous Community of Andalusia.

==Geography==
The Sevillian historian [[Antonio Domínguez Ortiz]] wrote that:

{{quote|…one must seek the essence of Andalusia in its geographic reality on the one hand, and on the other in the awareness of its inhabitants. From the geographic point of view, the whole of the southern lands is too vast and varied to be embraced as a single unit.

Andalusia alone is comparable in extent and in the variety of its terrain to any of several of the smaller European countries.

Andalusia sits at a latitude between 36º and 38º44' N, in the warm-temperate region. In general, it experiences a [[Mediterranean climate]], with dry summers influenced by the [[Azores High]], but subject to occasional torrential rains and extremely hot temperatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMA de la Junta de Andalucía&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/medioambiente/site/web/menuitem.a5664a214f73c3df81d8899661525ea0/?vgnextoid=ad53b44325234010VgnVCM1000000624e50aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=3259b19c7acf2010VgnVCM1000001625e50aRCRD&amp;lr=lang_es | title=Los tipos climáticos en Andalucía | author=Junta de Andalucía | publisher=Consejería del Medio Ambiente | accessdate=December 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter, the tropical anticyclones move south, allowing cold polar fronts to penetrate the region. Still, within Andalusia there is considerable climatic variety. From the extensive coastal plains one may pass to the valley of the Guadalquivir, barely above sea level, then to the highest altitudes in the Iberian peninsula in the peaks of the [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]]. In a mere {{convert|50|km|mi}} one can pass from the subtropical coast of the province of Granada to the snowy peaks of [[Mulhacén]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mountains of Granada and Jaén have the coldest temperatures in southern Iberia, but do not reach continental extremes (and, indeed are surpassed by some mountains in northern Spain). In the cold snap of January 2005, [[Santiago de la Espada]] (Jaén) experienced a temperature of {{convert|-21|°C|°F}} and the [[ski]] resort at [[Sierra Nevada National Park (Spain)|Sierra Nevada National Park]]—the southernmost ski resort in Europe—dropped to {{convert|-18|°C|°F}}. Sierra Nevada Natural Park has Iberia's lowest average annual temperature, ({{convert|3.9|°C|°F}} at Pradollano) and its peaks remain snowy practically year-round.

The [[Sierra Morena]] separates Andalusia from the plains of Extremadura and Castile-La Mancha on Spain's [[Meseta Central]]. Although sparsely populated, this is not a particularly high range, and its highest point, the {{convert|1323|m|ft|adj=on}} peak of La [[Bañuela]] in the [[Sierra Madrona]], lies outside of Andalusia. Within the Sierra Morana, the [[canyon|gorge]] of the [[Despeñaperros Natural Park|Despeñaperros]] forms a natural frontier between Castile and Andalusia.

The [[Baetic Cordillera]] consists of the parallel mountain ranges of the [[Cordillera Penibética]] near the Mediterranean coast and the [[Cordillera Subbética]] inland, separated by the [[Surco Intrabético]]. The Cordillera Subbética is quite discontinuous, offering many passes that facilitate transportation, but the Penibético forms a strong barrier between the Mediterranean coast and the interior.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bases para la Ordenación del Territorio de Andalucía&quot;, 1990, p. 126, in Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sierra Nevada, part of the Cordillera Penibética in the Province of Granada, has the highest peaks in Iberia: El [[Mulhacén]] at {{convert|3478|m|ft}} and El [[Veleta (Sierra Nevada)|Veleta]] at {{convert|3392|m|ft}}. 

Lower Andalusia, the [[Baetic Depression]], the basin of the Guadalquivir, lies between these two mountainous areas. It is a nearly flat territory, open to the [[Gulf of Cádiz]] in the southeast. Throughout history, this has been the most populous part of Andalusia.

=== Hydrography ===
[[File:Ríos de Andalucía.png|thumb|400 px|Rivers and basins of Andalusia.]]

Andalusia has rivers that flow into both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Flowing to the Atlantic are the [[Guadiana]], [[Odiel]]-[[Río Tinto|Tinto]], [[Guadalquivir]], [[Guadalete]], and [[Barbate (river)|Barbate]]. Flowing to the Mediterranean are the [[Guadiaro]], [[Guadalhorce]], [[Guadalmedina]], [[Guadalfeo]], [[Andarax]] (also known as the Almería) and [[Almanzora (river)|Almanzora]]. Of these, the [[Guadalquivir]] is the longest in Andalusia and fifth longest on the Iberian peninsula, at {{convert|657|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Río Guadalquivir Cordoba.jpg|thumb|The Guadalquivir as it passes through Córdoba.]]
The rivers of the Atlantic basin are characteristically long, run through mostly flat terrain, and have broad river valleys. As a result, at their mouths are [[estuary|estuaries]] and [[wetland]]s, such as the marshes of [[Doñana National Park|Doñana]] in the delta of the Guadalquivir, and [[wetland]]s of the Odiel. In contrast, the rivers of the Mediterranean Basin are shorter, more seasonal, and make a precipitous descent from the mountains of the Baetic Cordillera. Their estuaries are small, and their valleys are less suitable for agriculture. Also, being in the [[rain shadow]] of the Baetic Cordillera means that they receive a lesser volume of water.&lt;ref name=&quot;fisicoambiental&quot; /&gt;

The following hydrographic basins can be distinguished in Andalusia. On the Atlantic side are the Guadalquivir basin; the [[Andalusian Atlantic Basin]] with the sub-basins Guadalete-Barbate and Tinto-Odiel; and the Guadiana basin. On the Mediterranean side is the [[Andalusian Mediterranean Basin]] and the very upper portion of the basin of the [[Segura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Soils ===
The soils of Andalusia can be divided into three large areas: the [[Sierra Morena]], [[Cordillera Subbética]], and the [[Baetic Depression]] and the [[Surco Intrabético]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Sierra Morena, due to its morphology and the acidic content of its rocks, developed principally relatively poor, shallow soils, suitable only for forests. In the valleys and in some areas where [[limestone]] is present, deeper soils allowed farming of cereals suitable for livestock. The more complicated morphology of the Baetic Cordillera makes it more heterogeneous, with the most heterogeneous soils in Andalusia. Very roughly, in contrast to the Sierra Morena, a predominance of [[base (chemistry)|basic]] (alkaline) materials in the Cordillera Subbética, combined with a hilly landscape, generates deeper soils with greater agricultural capacity, suitable to the cultivation of olives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Finally, the Baetic Depression and the Surco Intrabético have deep, rich soils, with great agricultural capacity. In particular, the [[alluvium|alluvial]] soils of the [[Guadalquivir]] valley and plain of [[Granada]] have a [[loam]]y texture and are particularly suitable for intensive irrigated crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In other zones, the whiter ''albariza'' provides an excellent soil for [[vineyard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Despite their marginal quality, the poorly consolidated soils of the sandy coastline of Huelva and Almería
have been successfully used in recent decades for hothouse cultivation under clear plastic of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and other fruits.

=== Flora ===
[[File:Andalucia flora.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Phytochorion|Floristic provinces]] of Andalusia]]
Biogeographically, Andalusia forms part of the Western Mediterranean subregion of the [[Mediterranean Basin]], which falls within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. Five [[Phytochorion|floristic provinces]] lie, in whole or in part, within Andalusia: along much of the Atlantic coast, the Lusitanian-Andalusian littoral or Andalusian Atlantic littoral; in the north, the southern portion of the Luso-Extremaduran floristic province; covering roughly half of the region, the Baetic floristic province; and in the extreme east, the Almerian portion of the Almerian-Murcian floristic province and (coinciding roughly with the upper Segura basin) a small portion of the Castilian-Maestrazgan-Manchegan floristic province. These names derive primarily from past or present political geography: &quot;Luso&quot; and &quot;Lusitanian&quot; from [[Lusitania]], one of three [[Roman province]]s in Iberia, most of the others from present-day Spanish provinces, and [[Maestrazgo]] being a historical region of northern [[Valencian Community|Valencia]].

[[File:Rododendron.jpg|thumb|left|Oaks, rhododendrons and ferns in the [[Los Alcornocales Natural Park]].]]
In broad terms, the typical vegetation of Andalusia is [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub|Mediterranean woodland]], characterized by [[leaf]]y [[Xerophile|xerophilic]] [[perennial plant|perennials]], adapted to the long, dry summers. The dominant species of the [[climax community]] is the Holly Oak (''[[Quercus ilex]]''). Also abundant are Cork Oak (''[[Quercus suber]]''), various [[pine]]s, and Spanish Fir (''[[Abies pinsapo]]''). Due to cultivation, [[olive]] (''Olea europaea'') and [[almond]] (''Prunus dulcis'') trees also abound. The dominant [[understory]] is composed of thorny and aromatic woody species, such as [[Rosemary]] (''Rosmarinus officinalis''), [[Thyme]] (''Thymus''), and ''[[Cistus]]''. In the wettest areas with [[Soil pH|acidic soils]], the most abundant species are the Oak and Cork Oak, and the cultivated ''[[Eucalyptus]]''. In the woodlands, leafy [[hardwood]]s of genus ''[[Populus]]'' (poplars, aspens, cottonwoods) and ''[[Ulmus]]'' (elms) are also abundant; poplars are cultivated in the plains of Granada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Andalusian woodlands have been much altered by human settlement, the use of nearly all of the best land for farming, and frequent [[wildfire]]s. The degraded forests become shrubby and combustible [[garrigue]]. Extensive areas have been planted with non-[[Climax species|climax]] trees such as pines. There is now a clear conservation policy for the remaining forests, which survive almost exclusively in the mountains.

===Fauna===
[[File:Linces12.jpg|thumb|The [[Iberian Lynx]] (''Lynx pardinus'')]]

The [[biodiversity]] of Andalusia extends to its fauna as well. More than 400 of the 630 vertebrate species extant in Spain can be found in Andalusia. Spanning the Mediterrnean and Atlantic basins, and adjacent to the Strait of Gibraltar, Andalusia is on the migratory route of many of the numerous flocks of birds that travel annually from Europe to Africa and back.&lt;ref&gt;

The Andalusian wetlands host a rich variety of birds. Some are of African origin, such as the [[Red-knobbed Coot]] (''Fulica cristata''), the [[Purple Swamphen]] (''Porphyrio porphyrio''), and the [[Greater Flamingo]] (''Phoenicopterus roseus''). Others originate in Northern Europe, such as the [[Greylag Goose]] (''Anser anser''). [[Bird of Prey|Birds of prey]] (raptors) include the [[Spanish Imperial Eagle]] (also known as Adalbert's Eagle, ''Aquila adalberti'', the [[Griffon Vulture]] (''Gyps fulvus''), and both the [[Black Kite|Black]] and [[Red Kite]] (''Milvus migrans'' and ''Milvus milvus'').

[[File:Andalusierhengst 93c.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Andalusian horse]]]]
Among the [[herbivore]]s, are several [[deer]] (Cervidae) species, notably the [[Fallow Deer]] (''Dama dama'') and [[Roe Deer]] (''Capreolus capreolus''); the [[European Mouflon]] (''Ovis orientalis musimon''), a type of sheep; and the [[Spanish Ibex]] (''Capra pyrenaica'', which despite its scientific name is no longer found in the [[Pyrenees]]). The Spanish Ibex has recently been losing ground to the [[Barbary sheep]] (''Ammotragus lervia''), an [[invasive species]] from Africa, introduced for hunting in the 1970s. Among the small herbivores are [[rabbit]]s—especially the [[European Rabbit]] (''Oryctolagus cuniculus'')—which form the most important part of the diet of the carnivorous species of the Mediterranean woodlands.

The large [[carnivore]]s such as the [[Iberian Wolf]] (''Canis lupus signatus'') and the [[Iberian Lynx]] (''Lynx pardinus'') are quite threatened, and are limited to the Doñana, Sierra Morena, and Despeñaperros. Stocks of the [[Wild boar]] (''Sus scrofa''), on the other hand, have been well preserved because they are a popular with hunters. More abundant and in varied situations of conservation, are such smaller carnivores as [[Otter]]s, very abundant [[Fox]]es, the [[European Badger]] (''Meles meles''), the [[European Polecat]] (''Mustela putorius''), the [[Least Weasel]] (''Mustela nivalis''), the [[Wildcat]] (''Felis silvestris''), the [[Common Genet]] (''Genetta genetta''), and the [[Egyptian Mongoose]] (''Herpestes ichneumon)''.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Protected areas ===
[[File:Andalucía parques.png|thumb|400px|[[National park|National]]s and [[Natural park (Spain)|natural parks]] in Andalusia.]]
Andalusia has many unique ecosystems. In order to preserve these areas in a manner compatible with both conservation and economic exploitation, many of the most representative ecosystems have been given protected status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The various levels of protection are encompassed within the Network of Protected Natural Spaces of Andalusia (Red de Espacios Naturales Protegidos de Andalucía, RENPA) which integrates all protected natural spaces located in Andalusia, whether they are protected at the level of the local community, the autonomous community of Andalusia, the Spanish state, or by international conventions. RENPA consists of 150 protected spaces, consisting of two [[List of national parks of Spain|national parks]], 24 [[natural park (Spain)|natural parks]], 21 periurban parks (on the fringes of cities or towns), 32 natural sites, two protected countrysides, 37 natural monuments, 28 nature reserves, and four concerted nature reserves (in which a government agency coordinates with the owner of the property for its management), all part of the European Union's [[Natura 2000]] network. Under the international ambit are the nine [[Man and Biosphere Reserve Programme|Biosphere Reserves]], 20 [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] wetland sites, four [[Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance]] and two [[UNESCO]] [[Geopark]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;renpa&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In total, nearly 20 percent of the territory of Andalusia lies in one of these protected areas, which constitute roughly 30 percent of the protected territory of Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;renpa&quot; /&gt; Among these many spaces, some of the most notable are the [[Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y Las Villas Natural Park]], Spain's largest natural park and the second largest in Europe, the [[Sierra Nevada National Park (Spain)|Sierra Nevada National Park]], [[Doñana National Park|Doñana National Park and Natural Park]], the [[Tabernas Desert]], and the [[Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park]], the largest terrestrial-maritime reserve in the European Western Mediterranean Sea.

==History==
[[File:Dama de Baza ampliada.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lady of Baza]], ancient [[Iberians|Iberian]] sculpture. Origin: [[Baza, Granada|Baza]]. In the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]], Madrid.]]
The geostrategic position of Andalusia in the extreme south of [[Europe]], providing (along with [[Morocco]]) a gateway between Europe and Africa, added to its position between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]], as well as its rich deposits of minerals and its agricultural wealth, have made Andalusia a tempting prize for civilizations since prehistoric times. Add to this its area of {{convert|87268|km2|sqmi}} (larger than many European countries), and it can be no surprise that Andalusia has figured prominently in the history of Europe and the Mediterranean.

Given that the origin of humanity was almost certainly in Africa, several theories believe that the first [[hominid]]s in Europe were in Andalusia, having passed across the Strait of [[Gibraltar]]. The earliest known cultures in Andalusia (based on artifacts from the archaeological sites at [[Los Millares]], [[El Argar]], and [[Tartessos]]), were clearly influenced by cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean who settled on the Andalusian coast and influenced the cultures of the interior. Andalusia then went through a period of [[protohistory]], when the region did not have a written language of its own, but its existence was known to and documented by literate cultures, principally the [[Phoenicia]]ns ([[Cadiz]]) and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]]. During the second millennium BCE, the kingdom of [[Tartessos]] developed in Andalusia.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; It should also be mentioned that according to John Koch &lt;ref name=Koch2009/&gt; Cunliffe, Karl, Wodtko and other highly respected scholars, Celtic culture may well have developed first in far Southern Portugal and Southwestern Spain, approximately 500 years prior to anything recorded in Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunliffe, Karl, Guerra, McEvoy, Bradley; Oppenheimer, Rrvik, Isaac, Parsons, Koch, Freeman and Wodtko|title=Celtic from the West: Alternative Perspectives from Archaeology, Genetics, Language and Literature|year=2010|publisher=Oxbow Books and Celtic Studies Publications|isbn=978-1-84217-410-4|pages=384|url=http://www.oxbowbooks.com/bookinfo.cfm/ID/88298//Location/DBBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rethinking the Bronze Age and the Arrival of Indo-European in Atlantic Europe|url=http://www.oxbowbooks.com/pdfs/books/Celtic%20West%20conf.pdf|publisher=University of Wales Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies and Institute of Archaeology, University of Oxford|accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|title=A Race Apart: Insularity and Connectivity in Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 75, 2009, pp. 55–64|year=2008| publisher=The Prehistoric Society|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tartessian language]] from Andalusia, which [[John T.

=== Carthaginians and Romans ===
[[File:BAELO CLAUDIA.jpg|thumb|Partial view of the forum; ruins of [[Baelo Claudia]]]]
With the fall of the [[Phoenicia]]n cities, [[Carthage]] became the dominant sea power of the western Mediterranean and the most important trading partner for the Phoenician towns along the Andalusian coast. Between the [[First Punic War|First]] and [[Second Punic War]]s, Carthage extended its control beyond Andalucia to include all of Iberia except the Basque Country. Andalusia was the major staging ground for the war with Rome led by the Barkid [[Hannibal]]. The Romans defeated the Carthaginians and conquered Andalucia, the region being renamed [[Baetica]].&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; It was fully incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]], and from this region came many Roman magistrates and senator, as well as the emperors [[Trajan]] and (most likely) [[Hadrian]].

===Vandals - Visigoths - Byzantine Empires===
The [[Vandals]] moved briefly through the region during the 5th century AD before settling in North Africa, after which the region fell into the hands of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]]. The [[Visigoths]] in this region were practically independent of the [[Visigothic Kingdom#Catholic Kingdom of Toledo|Visigothic Catholic Kingdom of Toledo]]. This is the era of Saints [[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Hermenegild]]. During this period, around 555 AD, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] conquered Andalusia under [[Justinian I]], the [[Eastern Roman Emperor]]. They established [[Spania]], a province of the [[Byzantine Empire]] from 552 until 624. Though their holdings were quickly reduced, they continued to have interests in the region until they lost it altogether in 624.Roman Empire

===Islamic Empire - Al-Andalus===
{{Main|Al-Andalus|Timeline of the Muslim presence in the Iberian peninsula}}
[[File:Al Andalus.gif|thumb|350px|The [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] c. 1000, at the apogee of Almanzor's rule]]
The Visigothic era came to an abrupt end in 711 with the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] by the [[Umayyad]] general [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]], an [[Islamic]] [[Berber people|Berber]].&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;&lt;!--doesn't mention Tariq or Umayyads--&gt; Tariq is known in Spanish history and legend as Tariq el Tuerto (&quot;Tariq the One-eyed&quot;). The [[Muslim conquests#Conquest of Hispania: 711–718 and Septimania 719–720|Muslim conquest]]—by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]—of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 711–718 marked the collapse of Visigothic rule and the establishment of the Islamic Empire era. Andalusian culture was fundamentally influenced by over half a millennium of rule by many [[Muslim]] [[caliphate]]s and [[emirate]]s. In this period, the name &quot;[[Al-Andalus]]&quot; was applied to a much larger area than the present Andalusia, and in some periods it referred to nearly the entire Iberian peninsula. 

Nevertheless, the [[Guadalquivir]] River valley in present-day Andalusia was the hub of Muslim power in the peninsula, with the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] making [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] its capital. The Umayyad Caliphate produced such leaders as Caliph [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] (ruled 912–961) and his son, Caliph [[Al-Hakam II]] (ruled 961–976); and built the magnificent [[Great Mosque of Córdoba]]. Under these rulers, [[Moors|Moorish]] Islam in Spain reached its zenith, and Córdoba was a centre of global economic and cultural significance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson26&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Francis|title=The Cambridge illustrated history of the Islamic world|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1999|page=26|isbn=0521669936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mosque Cordoba.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great Mosque of Córdoba]]]]
Already in the 10th century, the Christians of northern Spain had begun what would eventually become the [[Reconquista]]: the reconquest of Spain for Christendom. Caliph Abd-ar-Rahman suffered some military defeats, but often managed to play off the Christian kingdoms against one another. Caliph Al-Hakam generally maintained peace and retained his status as the dominant figure of Iberia. Almanzor (effective ruler after Al-Hakam's death) achieved military successes, but at the expense of uniting the Christian kings of the north against him.

Internal divisions after the death of [[Almanzor]] (1002) led to the first of several decompositions of the Caliphate (1031). New centers of power arose, each ruling a ''[[taifa]]'' (and often with multiple levels of nominal fealty and relative independence, according to the patterns of [[feudalism]]). The ''taifa'' of Seville was especially influential, but the [[Emirate of Granada]] was the last to survive, lasting from 1228 until 1492.

After the conquest of Toledo in 1086 by [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alfonso VI]], Christian rule dominated the peninsula. The main ''[[Taifa]]s'' therefore had to resort to assistance from various Muslim powers across the Mediterranean. A number of different Muslim dynasties of North African origin—notably [[Almoravid dynasty]] and [[Almohad dynasty]]—dominated a slowly diminishing Al-Andalus over the next several centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson37&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Francis|title=The Cambridge illustrated history of the Islamic world|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1999|page=37|isbn=0521669936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Muslim victory at the [[Battle of Sagrajas]] (1086) put at temporary stop to Christian expansion, the [[Almoravid dynasty]] constructed a unified Al-Andalus with its capital in Granada, ruling until mid-12th century. The various ''Taifa'' kingdoms were assimilated. the [[Almohad dynasty]] expansion in North Africa weakened Al-Andalus, and in 1170 the Almohads transferred their capital from [[Marrakesh]] to [[Seville]]. The Christian victory at the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] (1212) marked the beginning of the end of the Almohad dynasty.

Córdoba was conquered in 1236 and Seville in 1248. The [[Battle of Granada|fall of Granada]] in 1492 put an end to Muslim rule in the Iberian peninsula.&lt;ref name=&quot;linehan&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Linehan|first=Peter|title=Castile, Portugal and Navarre|editor=David Abulafia and Rosamond McKitterick|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|series=The new Cambridge medieval history|volume=5|pages=674|chapter=21|isbn=052136289X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, the [[Habsburg dynasty]] ambitions elsewhere in Europe diverted much of the colonial wealth to war, and prevented the deeper economic development of Andalusia. Discontent with this situation culminated in 1641, when the Andalusian nobility staged an unsuccessful [[Andalusian independentist conspiracy (1641)|conspiracy to gain independence]] in 1641 from the provincial government of the [[Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares]].

In the first half of the 16th century [[Black Death|plague]] was still prevalent in Spain. According to George C. Kohn, &quot;One of the worst epidemics of the century, whose miseries were accompanied by severe drought and food shortage, started in 1505; by 1507, about 100,000 people had died in Andalusia alone... Andalusia was struck once again in 1646.

Following the [[Morisco Revolt|Second Rebellion of the Alpujarras]] in 1568-1571, the Moorish population—that is, unconverted [[Morisco]]s—were expelled from [[Kingdom of Castile]] (and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]]). However, by order of the [[Spanish crown]], two Moorish families were required to remain in each village in order to demonstrate to the new inhabitants, introduced from northern Spain, the workings of the [[terrace (agriculture)|terracing]] and irrigation systems on which the district's agriculture depends.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} 

Much as Andalusia profited from the Spanish overseas empire, the region suffered greatly from its loss and from the end of [[mercantilism]]. Having never industrialized, the region went from being one of Spain's wealthiest in the early 19th century{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} to one of its poorest a century later.

==Government and politics==
Andalusia one of the 17 [[autonomous communities of Spain]]. The [[Andalusian Autonomous Government]] (Spanish: ''Junta de Andalucía'') includes the [[Parliament of Andalusia]], [[List of Presidents of the Parliament of Andalusia|its chosen president]], a Consultative Council, and other bodies. 

The Autonomous Community of Andalusia was formed in accord with a referendum of February 28, 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.andaluciajunta.es/especiales/aj-fototeca-estatuto.html?cimg=5&amp;idSeccion=3&amp;idApartado=1|title= Celebración del Referéndum de Autonomía del 28-F|accessdate=2008-08-12|author= Junta de Andalucía|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became an autonomous community under the 1981 Statute of Automony known as the ''Estatuto de Carmona''. The process followed the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], still current as of 2009, which recognizes and guarantees the right of automony for the various regions and nationalities of Spain. The process to establish Andalusia as an autonomous region followed Article 151 of the Constitution, making Andalusia the only autonomous community to take that particular course. That article was set out for regions like Andalusia that had been prevented by the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] from adopting a statute of autonomy during the period of the [[Second Spanish Republic]].

Article 1 of the 1981 Statute of Autonomy justifies autonomy based on the region's &quot;historical identity, on the self-government that the Constitution permits every nationality, on outright equality to the rest of the nationalities and regions that compose Spain, and with a power that emanates from the Andalusian Constitution and people, reflected in its Statute of Autonomy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.andaluciajunta.es/especiales/aj-fototeca-estatuto.html?cimg=6&amp;idSeccion=3&amp;idApartado=1|title= Asamblea de Parlamentarios para debatir el Estatuto de Autonomía|accessdate= 12 August 2008|author= Junta de Andalucía|quote=...identidad histórica, en el autogobierno que la Constitución permite a toda nacionalidad, en plena igualdad al resto de nacionalidades y regiones que compongan España, y con un poder que emana de la Constitución y el pueblo andaluz, reflejado en su Estatuto de Autonomía}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006 the constitutional commission of the [[Cortes Generales]] (the national legislature of Spain), with favorable votes from the left-of-center [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE), the leftist [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] (IU) and the right-of-center [[People's Party (Spain)|People`s Party]] (PP), approved a new Statute of Autonomy for Andalusia, whose preamble refers to the community as a &quot;[[Nationalities and regions of Spain|national reality]]&quot; (''realidad nacional''):

{{quote|The Andalusianist Manifesto of Córdoba described Andalusia as a national reality in 1919, whose spirit the Andalusians took up outright through the process of self-government recognized in our Magna Carta. In 1978 the Andalusians broadly backed the constitutional consensus. Today, the Constitution, in its Article 2, recognizes Andalusia as a nationality as part of the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;citing 1919&quot; /&gt;|[[:s:Estatuto de Autonomía de Andalucía 2007|Andalusian Statute of Autonomy on Wikisource]], in Spanish}}

On November 2, 2006 the Spanish Chamber Deputies ratified the text of the Constitutional Commission with 306 votes in favor, none opposed, and 2 abstentions. This was the first time a Spanish [[Organic Law (Spain)|Organic Law]] adopting a Statute of Autonomy was approved with no opposing votes. The Senate, in a plenary session of December 20, 2006, ratified the referendum to be voted upon by the Andalusian public February 18, 2007.

The Statute of Autonomy spells out Andalusia's distinct institutions of government and administration. Chief among these is the [[Andalusian Autonomous Government]] (''Junta de Andalucía''). Other institutions specified in the Statute are the Defensor del Pueblo Andaluz (literally &quot;Defender of the Andalusian People&quot;, basically an [[ombudsperson]]), the Consultative Council, the Chamber of Accounts, the Audiovisual Council of Andalusia, and the Economic and Social Council.

The Andalusian Statute of Autonomy recognizes Seville as the region's capital. The Andalusian Autonomous Government is located there. However, the region's highest court, the [[High Court of Andalusia]] (''[[Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Andalucía]]'') is not part of the Autonomous Government, and has its seat in [[Granada]].

=== Andalusian Autonomous Government ===
{{Main|Andalusian Autonomous Government}}
The Andalusian Autonomous Government (''Junta de Andalucía'') is the institution of self-government of the Autonomous Community of Andalusia. Within the government, the [[List of Presidents of the Parliament of Andalusia|President]] is the supreme representative of the autonomous community, and the ordinary representative of the Spanish state in the autonomous community. The president is formally named to the position by the [[Monarchy of Spain|Monarch of Spain]] and then confirmed by a majority vote of the [[Parliament of Andalusia]]. In practice, the monarch always names a person acceptable to the ruling party or coalition of parties in the autonomous region. In theory, were the candidate to fail to gain the needed majority, the monarch could propose a succession of candidates. After two months, if no proposed candidate could gain the parliament's approval, the parliament would automatically be dissolved and the acting president would call new elections.&lt;ref&gt;''Estatuto de Autonomía Art. 118 Cap. III Tít. IV''&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, [[José Antonio Griñán|José Antonio Griñán Martínez]] is president.

The Council of Government, the highest political and administrative organ of the Community, exercises [[rulemaking|regulatory]] and [[executive power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the current legislature (2008–2012), there are 15 of these departments. In order of precedence, they are Presidency, Governance, Economy and Treasury, Education, Justice and Public Administration, Innovation, Science and Business, Public Works and Transportation, Employment, Health, Agriculture and Fishing, Housing and Territorial Planning, Tourism, Commerce and Sports, Equality and Social Welfare, Culture, and Environment.

=== Judicial power===
The [[High Court of Andalusia]] (''[[Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Andalucía]]'') in Granada is subject only to the higher jurisdiction of [[Supreme Court of Spain]]. The High Court is not an organ of the Autonomous Community, but rather of the [[Judiciary of Spain]], which is unitary throughout the kingdom and whose powers are not transferred to the autonomous communities.

Entirely informally, Andalusia is traditionally divided into two large subregions: &quot;Upper&quot; or &quot;Eastern&quot; Andalusia, consisting of the provinces of Almería, Granada, Jaén, and Málaga, and &quot;Lower&quot; or &quot;Western&quot; Andalusia, consisting of the provinces of Huelva, Seville, Cádiz, and Córdoba.

===Municipalities and local entities===
[[File:Andalucia municipalities.png|thumb|400px|Municipalities of Andalusia]]
Beyond the level of provinces, Andalusia is further divided into 771 [[List of municipalities of Spain|municipalities]] (''municipios'').&lt;ref name=&quot;del&quot; /&gt; The municipalities of Andalusia are regulated by Title III of the Statute of Autonomy, Articles 91–95, which establishes the municipality as the basic territorial entity of Andalusia, each of which has legal personhood and autonomy in many aspects of its internal affairs. At the municipal level, representation, government and administration is performed by the ''ayuntamiento'' (municipal government), which has competency for [[urban planning]], community social services, supply and treatment of water, collection and treatment of waste, and promotion of tourism, culture, and sports, among other matters established by law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/CCAA/an-l7-1993.html Ley 7/1993, de 27 de julio, reguladora de la demarcación municipal de Andalucía.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the more important Andalusian cities besides the provincial capitals are:
* [[El Ejido]], and [[Roquetas de Mar]], (Almería)
* [[La Línea de la Concepción]], [[Algeciras]], [[San Roque, Cádiz]], [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]], [[Rota, Spain|Rota]], [[San Fernando, Cádiz|San Fernando]], [[Jerez]], and [[El Puerto de Santa María|El Puerto]], (Cádiz)
* [[Almuñécar]], [[Guadix]], [[Loja, Granada|Loja]] and [[Motril]], (Granada)
* [[Linares, Jaén|Linares]], [[Úbeda]] and [[Baeza]], (Jaén)
* [[Antequera]], [[Ronda]] and [[Marbella]], (Málaga)
* [[Utrera]], [[Dos Hermanas]], [[Alcalá de Guadaíra]], [[Osuna]], [[Ecija]] and [[Lebrija]] (Seville)

In conformity with the intent to devolve control as locally as possible, in many cases, separate nuclei of population within municipal borders each administer their own interests. These are variously known as ''pedanías'' (&quot;hamlets&quot;), ''villas'' (&quot;villages&quot;), ''aldeas'' (also usually rendered as &quot;villages&quot;), or other similar names.&lt;ref name=&quot;del&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Anexo:Entidades locales de Andalucía|List of local entities in Andalusia]], in Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comarcas and mancomunidades===
[[File:Regions of Andalusia.svg|thumb|400px|[[Comarcas of Andalusia]]]]
Within the various autonomous communities of Spain, ''[[comarcas]]'' are comparable to [[shire]]s (or, in some countries, [[county|counties]]) in the English-speaking world. Unlike in some of Spain's other autonomous communities, under the original 1981 Statute of Autonomy, the [[comarcas of Andalusia]] had no formal recognition, but, in practice, they still had informal recognition as geographic, cultural, historical, and in some cases administrative entities. The 2007 Statute of Autonomy echoes this practice, and mentions comarcas in Article 97 of Title III, which defines the significance of ''comarcas'' and establishes a basis for formal recognition in future legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Tít. III. Art. 97. Comarcas – Estatuto de Autonomía de Andalucía 2007: :''&quot;1. La comarca se configura como la agrupación voluntaria de municipios limítrofes con características geográficas, económicas, sociales e históricas afines. 2. Por ley del Parlamento de Andalucía podrá regularse la creación de comarcas,
que establecerá, también, sus competencias. Se requerirá en todo caso el acuerdo de los Ayuntamientos afectados y la aprobación del Consejo de Gobierno.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The current statutory entity that most closely resembles a comarca is the ''[[mancomunidad]]'', a freely chosen, bottom-up association of municipalities intended as an instrument of socioeconomic development and coordination between municipal governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;del&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgal.map.es/cgi-bin/webapb/webdriver?MIval=mancprov Mancomunidades] (map), dgal.map.es. You can click the map to see the ''mancomunidades'' of each individual province.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that present-day ''mancomunidades'' could, in the future, become ''comarcas''. Alternatively, groups of municipalities formed under [[LEADER]] or [[PRODER]] to solicit European aid for rural development could also evolve into ''comarcas''. Almost every Andalusian municipality outside of the capitals and major cities is a member of some such group. These groups consist of municipalities freely united by their economic interests and are often endowed with funds used for external dissemination of their identity.

==Demographics==
Andalusia ranks first by population among the 17 autonomous communities of Spain. The estimated population at the beginning of 2009 was 8,285,692.&lt;ref name=&quot;INEpob2008&quot; /&gt; The population is concentrated, above all, in the provincial capitals and along the coasts, so that the level of urbanization is quite high; half the population is concentrated in the 28 cities of more than 50,000 inhabitants. The population is aging, although the process of immigration is countering the inversion of the [[population pyramid]].&lt;ref&gt;Inversion of the [[population pyramid]] is a process by which the number of older people exceeds the number of younger people. This often occurs in developed countries as birth rates decline.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 20th century, Andalusia was in the last phase of [[demographic transition]]. The [[death rate]] stagnated at around 8–9 per thousand, and the population came to be influenced mainly by birth and migration.&lt;ref name=&quot;pob2&quot;&gt;{{cite book

In 1950, Andalusia had 20.04 percent of the national population of Spain. By 1981, this had declined to 17.09 percent. Although the Andalusian population was not declining in absolute terms, these relative losses were due to emigration great enough to nearly counterbalance having the highest [[birth rate]] in Spain.

The birth rate is sharply down, as is typical in developed economies, although it has lagged much of the rest of the world in this respect. Furthermore, prior emigrants have been returning to Andalusia.

=== Structure ===
[[File:Nat mor anda.png|thumb|Evolution of the birth and death rates of Andalusia 1975–2007]]
[[File:Andalucia piramide.PNG|thumb|Structure of the population of Andalusia by sex and age. 2008 data 2008; 1986 data in red for comparison.]]

At the beginning of the 21st century, the population structure of Andalusia shows a clear inversion of the population pyramid, with the largest cohorts falling between ages 25 and 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| author = Del Valle, C.
| title = El envejecimiento demográfico en Andalucía y las características sociodemográficas de la población mayor de 64 años
| year = 2005 
| journal = Papers de demografia
| number = 255
| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparison of the population pyramid in 2008 to that in 1986 shows: 
# A clear decrease in the population under the age of 25, due to a declining birth rate.
# An increase in the adult population, as the earlier, larger cohort born in the &quot;baby boom&quot; of the 1960s and 1970s reach adulthood. This effect has been exacerbated by immigration: the largest contingent of immigrants are young adults.
# A further increase in the adult population, and especially the older adult population, due to increased [[life expectancy]].

As far as composition by sex, two aspects stand out: the higher percentage of women in the elderly population, owing to women's longer life expectancy, and, on the other hand, the higher percentage of men of working age, due in large part to a predominantly male immigrant population.&lt;ref name=&quot;pob&quot; /&gt;

=== Immigration ===
5.35 percent of the population of Andalusia were born outside of Spain. This is actually a relatively low number in Spanish national terms, the national average being three percentage points higher. The immigrants are by no means evenly distributed among the Andalusian provinces: Almería, with a 15.20 percent immigrant population, is third among all provinces in Spain, while at the other extreme Jaén has only 2.07 percent immigrants and Córdoba 1.77%. The predominant nationalities among the immigrant populations are [[Morocco|Moroccan]] (92,500, constituting 17.79 of the foreigners living in Andalusia), [[United Kingdom|British]] (15.25 percent across the region, but constituting a majority of immigrants to Málaga). Still, if one looks at regions rather than individual countries, the single largest immigrant block is from [[Latin America]], outnumbering either North Africans or non-Spanish Western Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Instituto Nacional de Estadística (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estadística de España]],  2005 census&lt;/ref&gt; Demographically, this group has provided an important addition to the Andalusian labor force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indicadores sociales&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pob Extranjera&quot; /&gt;

==Economy==
Andalusia is traditionally an agricultural area, but the service sector (particularly tourism, retail sales, and transportation) now predominates. The once booming construction sector, hit hard by the 2009 recession, was also important to the region's economy. The industrial sector is less developed than most other regions in Spain. 

During the period for the 2000–2006 period was 3.72%, one of the highest in the country. Still, according to the Spanish [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estadística]] (INE), the GDP per capita of Andalusia (€17,401; 2006) remains the second lowest in Spain, with only [[Extremadura]] lagging behind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diariodesevilla.es/article/economia/19254/la/renta/capita/andaluza/alcanza/los/euros/la/segunda/mas/baja/espana.html &quot;La renta per cápita andaluza alcanza los 17.401 euros, la segunda más baja de España&quot;], ''Diario de Sevilla'', 28 December 2007, pg. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Primary sector ===
The [[primary sector]], despite adding the least of the three sectors to the regional [[GDP]] remains important, especially when compared to typical developed economies. The primary sector produces 8.26 percent of regional GDP and employs 8.19 percent of the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;IEA data for 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}&lt;!-- existing citation is very vague--&gt; In monetary terms it could be considered a rather uncompetitive sector, given its level of productivity compared to other Spanish regions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In addition to its numeric importance relative to other regions, agriculture and other primary sector activities have strong roots in local culture and identity.

The primary sector is divided into a number of subsectors: [[agriculture]], [[commercial fishing]], [[animal husbandry]], [[hunting]], [[forestry]], [[mining]], and [[energy]].

====Agriculture, husbandry, hunting, and forestry====
[[File:Aceites DOP Andalucía.svg|thumb|400px|[[Protected Geographical Status|Denominations of origin]] of [[olive oil]] in Andalusia]]

For many centuries, Andalusian society was mainly agricultural. Even today, 45.74 percent of the Andalusian territory is cultivated.&lt;ref&gt;Source: MAPA. Subdirección General de Estadísticas Agroalimentarias. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}&lt;!-- citation is vague --&gt; The primary cultivation is dryland farming of [[cereal]]s and [[sunflower]]s without artificial [[irrigation]], especially in the vast countryside of the Guadalquivir valley and the high plains of Granada and Almería-with a considerably lesser and more geographically focused cultivation of [[barley]] and [[avena|oats]]. Using irrigation, [[maize]], [[cotton]] and [[rice]] are also grown on the banks of the Guadalquivir and [[Genil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Dehesa Boyal. Bollullos Par del Condado (Huelva).jpg|thumb|''Dehesa Boyal'' (meadow for grazing animals), [[Bollullos Par del Condado]].]]

[[Organic farming]] has recently undergone rapid expansion in Andalusia, mainly for export to European markets but with increasing demand developing in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Andalusia has a long tradition of [[animal husbandry]] and [[livestock]] farming, but it is now restricted mainly to mountain meadows, where there is less pressure from other potential uses. The raising of livestock now plays a semi-marginal role in the Andalusian economy, constituting only 15 percent of the primary sector, half the number for Spain taken as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Extensive&quot; raising of livestock grazes the animals on natural or cultivated [[pasture]]s, whereas &quot;intensive&quot; raising of livestock is based in [[fodder]] rather than pasture. Although the productivity is higher than with extensive techniques, the economics are quite different. While intensive techniques now dominate in Europe and even in other regions of Spain, most of Andalusia's [[cattle]], virtually all of its [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s, and a good portion of its [[pig]]s are raised by extensive farming in mountain pastures. This includes the [[Black Iberian pig]]s that are the source of ''[[Jamón ibérico]]''. Andalusia's native sheep and goats present a great economic opportunity in a Europe where animal products are generally in strong supply, but the sheep and goat meat, milke, and leather (and the products derived from these) are relatively scarce.

Hunting remains relatively important in Andalusia, but has largely lost its character as a means of obtaining food.
It is now more of a leisure activity linked to the mountain areas and complementary to forestry and the raising of livestock.&lt;ref name=&quot;gancaz&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The Andalusian [[forest]]s are important for their extent—50 percent of the territory of Andalusia—and for other less quantifiable environmental reasons, such as their value in preventing erosion, regulating the flow of water necessary for other flora and fauna. For these reasons, there is legislation in place to protect the Andalusian forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==== Fishing ====
[[File:Muelle pesquero de Algeciras 1.JPG|thumb|Fishing port of Algeciras.]]

[[Commercial fishing|Fishing]] is a longstanding tradition on the Andalusian coasts. Fish and other seafood have long figured prominently in the local diet and in the local [[gastronomy|gastronomic]] culture: [[fried fish]] (''pescaito frito'' in local dialect), white [[prawn]]s, ''[[almadraba]]'' tuna, among others. The Andalusian fishing fleet is Spain's second largest, after [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and Andalusia's 38 fishing ports are the most of any Spanish autonomous community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the province of Huelva it constitutes 20 percent of the primary sector, and locally in [[Punta Umbría]] 70 percent of the work force is involved in commercial fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Failure to comply with fisheries laws regarding the use of trawling, urban [[pollution]] of the seacoast, destruction of habitats by coastal construction (for example, alteration of the mouths of rivers, construction of ports), and diminution of fisheries by [[overexploitation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Mining ====

Despite the general poor returns in recent years, [[mining]] retains a certain importance in Andalusia. Andalusia produces half of Spain's mining product by value. Of Andalusia's production, roughly half comes from the province of Huelva. Mining for precious metals at [[Minas de Riotinto]] in Huelva (''see [[Rio Tinto Group]]'') dates back to pre-Roman times; the mines were abandoned in the Middle Ages and rediscovered in 1556. Other mining activity is [[coal]] mining in the Guadiato valley in the province of Córdoba; various metals at [[Aznalcóllar]] in the province of Seville, and iron at [[Alquife]] in the province of Granada. In addition, limestone, clay, and other materials used in construction are well distributed throughout Andalusia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Secondary sector: industry ===
The Andalusian industrial sector has always been relatively small. Nevertheless in 2007, Andalusian industry earned 11.979 million euros and employed more than 290,000 workers. This represented 9.15 percent of regional GDP, far below the 15.08 the secondary sector represents in the economy of Spain as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;IEA: Contabilidad Regional de Andalucía&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}&lt;!-- this is a very vague citation --&gt; By analyzing the different subsectors of the food industry Andalusian industry accounts for more than 16% of total production. In a comparison with the Spanish economy, this subsector is virtually the only food that has some weight in the national economy with 16.16%. Lies far behind the manufacturing sector of shipping materials just over 10% of the Spanish economy. Companies like Cruzcampo (Heineken Group), Puleva, Domecq, Santana Motors or Renault-Andalusia, are exponents of these two subsectors. Of note is the Andalusian aeronautical sector, which is second nationally only behind Madrid and represents approximately 21% of total turnover in terms of employment, highlighting companies like Airbus, Airbus Military, or the newly formed Aerospace Alestis. On the contrary it is symptomatic of how little weight the regional economy in such important sectors such as textiles or electronics at the national level.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Andalusian industry is also characterized by a specialization in industrial activities of transforming raw agricultural and mineral materials. This is largely done by small enterprises without the public or foreign investment more typical of a high level of industrialization.

=== Tertiary sector: services ===
[[File:Castillo de Sancti Petri.JPG|thumb||Castle of Sancti Petri, located in [[San Fernando, Cádiz]]. One of the largest components of the service sector is &quot;sun and sand&quot; tourism.]]

In recent decades the Andalusian tertiary (service) sector has grown greatly, and has come to constitute the majority of the regional economy, as is typical of contemporary economies in developed nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 the service sector produced 51.1 percent of local GDP and employed 40.8 percent of the work force. In 2007, this had risen to 67.9 percent of GDP and 66.42 percent of jobs. This process of &quot;tertiarization&quot; of the economy has followed a somewhat unusual course in Andalusia.&lt;ref name=tertiarization&gt;{{cite journal| author = Genaro, M.D.

| format = pdf
| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; This growth occurred somewhat earlier than in most developed economies and occurred independently of the local industrial sector. There were two principal reasons that &quot;tertiarization&quot; followed a different course in Andalusia than elsewhere:

1. Andalusian capital found it impossible to compete in the industrial sector against more developed regions, and was obligated to invest in sectors that were easier to enter.

2. The absence of an industrial sector that could absorb displaced agricultural workers and artisans led to the proliferation of services with rather low productivity. This unequal development compared to other regions led to a hypertrophied and unproductive service sector, which has tended to reinforce underdevelopment, because it has not led to large accumulations of capital.&lt;ref name=tertiarization /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

====Tourism in Andalusia====

[[File:Playas de Nerja 2.jpg|thumb|[[Nerja]].]]

Due in part to the relatively mild winter and spring climate, the south of Spain is attractive to overseas visitors–especially tourists from Northern Europe. While inland areas such as [[Jaén (Spanish province)|Jaén]], [[Córdoba (Spanish province)|Córdoba]] and the hill villages and towns remain relatively untouched by tourism, the coastal areas of Andalusia have heavy visitor traffic for much of the year.

Among the autonomous communities, Andalusia is second only to [[Catalonia]] in tourism, with nearly 30 million visitors every year. The principal tourist destinations in Andalusia are the [[Costa del Sol]] and (secondarily) the [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]]. As discussed [[#Climate|above]], Andalusia is one of the sunniest and warmest places in Europe, making it a center of &quot;sun and sand&quot; tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The largest number of tourists come in August—13.26 percent of the nights booked throughout the year—and the smallest number in December—5.36 percent.

On the west (Atlantic) coast are the [[Costa de la Luz]] (provinces of Huelva and Cádiz), and on the east (Mediterranean) coast, the [[Costa del Sol]] (provinces of Cádiz y Málaga), [[Costa Tropical]] (Granada and part of Almería) and the [[Costa de Almería]]. In 2004, the [[Blue Flag beach]] program of the non-profit [[Foundation for Environmental Education]] recognized 66 Andalusian beaches and 18 pleasure craft ports as being in a good state of conservation in terms of sustainability, accessibility, and quality.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Nonetheless, the level of tourism on the Andalusian coasts has been high enough to have a significant environmental impact, and other organizations—such as the Spanish [[Ecologists in Action]] (''Ecologistas en Acción'') with their description of &quot;Black Flag beaches&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;—have expressed the opposite sentiment.

Together with &quot;sand and sun&quot; tourism, there has also been a strong increase in nature tourism in the interior, as well as [[cultural tourism]], sport tourism, and conventions. One example of sport and nature tourism is the ski resort at [[Sierra Nevada National Park (Spain)|Sierra Nevada National Park]].

As for cultural tourism, Andalusia has some notable monuments dating back to the Muslim era: the [[Great Mosque of Córdoba]] (now a [[cathedral]]), the [[Alhambra]] in Granada and the [[Giralda]] in Seville. There are hundreds of cultural tourist destinations: cathedrals, castles, forts, monasteries, and historic city centers; the city centers of [[Úbeda]] and [[Baeza]] in the province of Jaén are UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s.

Each of the provinces shows a great variety of architectural styles: [[Islamic architecture]], [[Renaissance architecture]], [[Baroque architecture]] and more modern styles. Further, there are the ''[[Lugares colombinos]]'', significant places in the life of [[Christopher Columbus]]:&lt;ref&gt;Decreto 553/1967, de 2 de marzo, por el que se declara conjunto histórico artístico el sector denominado «Lugares Colombinos» en la provincia de Huelva.

There are also archeological sites of great interest: the Roman city of [[Italica]], birthplace of [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Trajan]] and (most likely) [[Hadrian]]; [[Baelo Claudia]] near the Straits of Gibraltar; [[Medina Azahara]], the city-palace of the Cordoban [[caliph]] [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]], where major excavations still continue.

Andalusia was the birthplace of such great painters as [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] (Seville) and, more recently, [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] (Málaga); Picasso is memorialized by in his native city by the [[Fundación Picasso]] and [[Museo Picasso Málaga]]; the [[Casa de Murillo]] was a [[house museum]] 1982–1998, but is now mostly offices for the Andalusian Council of Culture. There are numerous other significant museums around the region, both of paintings and of archeological artifacts such as gold jewelry, pottery and other ceramics, and other works that demonstrate the region's artisanal traditions.

The Council of Government has designated the following &quot;Municipios Turísticos&quot;: in Almería, [[Roquetas de Mar]]; in Cádiz, [[Chiclana de la Frontera]], [[Chipiona]], [[Conil de la Frontera]], [[Grazalema]], [[Rota, Spain|Rota]], and [[Tarifa]]; in Granada, [[Almuñécar]]; in Huelva, [[Aracena]]; in Jaén, [[Cazorla]]; in Málaga, [[Benalmádena]], [[Fuengirola]], [[Nerja]], [[Rincón de la Victoria]], [[Ronda]], and [[Torremolinos]]; in Seville, [[Santiponce]].

==Infrastructure==
===Transport===

[[File:Sevilla airport.jpg|thumb|Interior of Seville Airport]]

As in any modern society, transport systems are an essential structural element of the functioning of Andalusia. The transportation network facilitates territorial coordination, economic development and distribution, and intercity transportation.&lt;ref name=&quot;infra&quot;&gt;{{cite book

In urban transport, underdeveloped public transport systems put pedestrian traffic and other non-motorized traffic are at a disadvantage compared to the use of private vehicles. Several Andalusian capitals—Córdoba, Granada and Seville—have recently been trying to remedy this by strengthening their public transport systems and providing a better infrastructure for the use of [[bicycle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cañavate |first=Jose Luis |coauthors=Corral, Carlos |publisher=Consejería de Medio Ambiente de la Junta de Andalucía |title=La bicicleta como medio de transporte en Andalucía |year=2004 | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For over a century, the conventional rail network has been centralized on the regional capital, Seville, and the national capital, Madrid; in general, there are no direct connections between provincial capitals. High-speed [[AVE]] trains run from Madrid via Córdoba to Seville and Málaga. Further AVE routes are under construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renfe.es/ave/index.html Productos Alta Velocidad], RENFE/AVE. Accessed online 2009-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Madrid-Córdoba-Seville route was the first high-velocity route in Spain (operating since 1992). Other principal routes are the one from Algeciras to Seville and from [[Almería]] via Granada to Madrid.

[[File:Puerto malaga.jpg|thumb|left|[[Port of Málaga]].]]
[[File:Puerto Banús Marbella.jpg||left|thumb|&quot;[[Puerto Banús]]&quot;, port of Marbella.]]
Most of the principal roads have been converted into [[limited access highway]]s known as ''[[autovía]]s''. The Autovía del Este ([[Autovía A-4]]) runs from Madrid through the Despeñaperros Natural Park, then via Bailén, Córdoba, and Seville to Cádiz, and is part of [[European route E05]] in the [[International E-road network]]. The other main road in the region is the portion of [[European route E15]], which runs as the Autovia del Mediterráneo along the Spanish Mediterranean coast. Parts of this constitute the [[superhighway]] [[Autopista AP-7]], while in other areas it is [[Autovía A-7]]. Both of these roads run generally east-west, although the Autovía A-4 turns to the south in western Andalusia.

Other first-order roads include the [[Autovía A-48]] roughly along the Atlantic coast from Cádiz to Algeciras, continuing European route E05 to meet up with [[European route E15]]; the Autovía del Quinto Centenario ([[Autovía A-49]]), which continues west from Seville (where the Autovía A-4 turns toward the south) and goes on to Huelva and into Portugal as [[European route E01]]; the Autovía Ruta de la Plata ([[Autovía A-66]]), [[European route E803]], which roughly corresponds to the ancient Roman '[[Silver Route]]' from the mines of northern Spain, and runs north from Seville; the Autovía de Málaga ([[Autovía A-45]]), which runs south from Córdoba to Málaga; and the Autovía de Sierra Nevada ([[Autovía A-44]]), part of [[European route E902]], which runs south from Jaén to the Mediterranean coast at Motril. 

As of 2008 Andalusia has six public airports, all of which can legally handle international flights; however the [[Málaga Airport]] is dominant, handling 60.67 percent of passengers&lt;ref name=&quot;Datos Aena&quot;&gt;{{cite web
| author = [http://www.aena.es Aena] | url = http://estadisticas.aena.es/csee/ContentServer?pagename=Estadisticas/Home | title = Informes sobre la utilización de los aeropuertos de España en los últimos años | accessdate = 2008-01-17 |language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 85 percent of its international traffic.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The [[Seville Airport]] handles another 20.12 percent of traffic, and the [[Jerez Airport]] 7.17 percent, so that these three airports account for 87.96 percent of traffic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Datos Aena&quot; /&gt;

Málaga Airport is the international airport that offers a wide variety of international destinations. It has a daily link with twenty cities in Spain and over a hundred cities in Europe (mainly in Great Britain, Central Europe and the Nordic countries but also the main cities of Eastern Europe: [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]] , [[Sofia]], [[Riga]] or [[Bucharest]]), North Africa, Middle East ([[Riyadh]], [[Jeddah]] and [[Kuwait]]) and North America ([[New York]], [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]]).

The main ports are Algeciras (for freight and container traffic) and Málaga for cruise ships. Algeciras is Spain's leading commercial port, with {{convert|60000000|tonne|ST}} of cargo in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barragán Muñoz |first=Juan Manuel | coauthors=Chica Ruiz, Adolfo; Pérez Cayeiro, Maria Luisa |publisher= Consejería de Medio Ambiente de la Junta de Andalucía |title=Propuesta de Estrategia Andaluza de Gestión Integrada de Zonas Costeras |isbn= 978-84-96776-06-7 |page=255 |chapter=3 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seville has Spain's only commercial river port. Other significant commercial ports in Andalusia are the ports of the [[Bay of Cádiz]] and Huelva.

The Council of Government has approved a Plan of Infrastructures for the Sustainability of Transport in Andalusia (PISTA) 2007–2013, which plans an investment of 30 billion euros during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Energy infrastructure ===
[[File:PS10 solar power tower 2.jpg|thumb|[[Solar power tower]] [[PS10 solar power tower|PS10]] in [[Sanlúcar la Mayor]].]]
[[File:Térmica de Escombreras.jpg|thumb|[[Litoral de Almería Thermal Power Station]],  Province of Almería.]]

The lack of high-quality [[fossil fuel]]s in Andalusia has led to a strong dependency on [[petroleum]] imports. Still, Andalusia has a strong potential for the development of [[renewable energy]], above all [[wind energy]]. The Andalusian Energy Agency established in 2005 by the autonomous government, is a new governmental organ charged with the development of energy policy and provision of a sufficient supply of energy for the community.&lt;ref name=&quot;infra&quot; /&gt; 

The infrastructure for production of [[electricity]] consists of eight large [[thermal power station]]s, more than 70 [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power plants, two [[wind farm]]s, and 14 major [[cogeneration]] facilities. Historically, the largest Andalusian business in this sector was the [[Compañía Sevillana de Electricidad]], founded in 1894, absorbed into [[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]] in 1996.

The [[Solar power tower]] [[PS10 solar power tower|PS10]] was built by the Andalusian firm [[Abengoa]] in [[Sanlúcar la Mayor]] in the province of Seville, and began operating in March 2007. It is the largest existing solar power facility in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/paginas/Contenidosecciones.asp?ID=660&amp;Tipo=&amp;Nombre=Renewable%20energy%20news Abengoa opens the first EU commercial concentrating Solar Power Tower], RenewableEnergyMagazine.com, 2007-04-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller solar power stations, also recent, exist at [[Cúllar]] and [[Galera, Granada]], inaugurated by [[Geosol]] and [[Caja Granada]]. Two more large thermosolar facilities, [[Andasol|Andasol I y II]], planned at Hoya de [[Guadix]] in the province of Granada are expected to supply electricity to half a million households.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andasol2&quot;&gt;[http://www.energias-renovables.com/paginas/Contenidosecciones.asp?ID=10880&amp;Tipo=&amp;Nombre=Noticias La central solar de alta temperatura de Andasol 2 ya ha puesto la primera piedra], Energías Renovables, 2007-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Plataforma Solar de Almería]] (PSA) in the Tabernas Desert is an important center for the exploration of the solar energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlr.de/tt/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-2881/4512_read-6631/ Plataforma Solar de Almeria], Institute of Technical Thermodynamics, German Aerospace Center. Accessed online 2009-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest wind power firm in the region is the [[Sociedad Eólica de Andalucía]], formed by the merger of [[Planta Eólica del Sur S.A.]] and [[Energía Eólica del Estrecho S.A.]]

=== Education ===
[[File:portadafacultad.gif|thumb|Law School of the [[University of Granada]].]]

As throughout Spain, basic education in Andalusia is free and compulsory. Students are required to complete ten years of schooling, and may not leave school before the age of 16, after which students may continue on to a [[bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]], to intermediate [[vocational education]], to intermediate-level schooling in arts and design, to intermediate sports studies, or to the working world.

Andalusia has a tradition of higher education dating back to the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Madrasah of Granada]], [[University of Baeza]], and [[University of Osuna]].

As of 2009, there are ten private or public universities in Andalucia. University studies are structured in cycles, awarding degrees based on [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS credits]] in accord with the [[Bologna process]], which the Andalusian universities are adopting in accord with the other universities of the [[European Higher Education Area]].

===Healthcare===
[[File:Mapa sanitario de Andalucía.png|thumb|400 px|Healthcare districts of Andalusia]]
Responsibility for healthcare jurisdictions devolved from the Spanish government to Andalusia with the enactment of the Statute of Autonomy. Thus, the [[Andalusian Health Service]] (''Servicio Andaluz de Salud'') currently manages almost all public health resources of the Community, with such exceptions as health resources for prisoners and members of the military, which remain under central administration.

===Science and technology===
According to the Outreach Program for Science in Andalusia, Andalusia contributes 14 percent of Spain's scientific production behind only Madrid and Catalonia among the autonomous communities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andaluciainvestiga.com/espanol/investigacionAnd/investigacionAnd.asp www.andaluciainvestiga.com]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}&lt;!-- needs better citation, the stated fact is not on the cited page--&gt; even though regional investment in [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) as a proportion of [[GDP]] is below the national average.&lt;ref&gt;Plan Andaluz de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación. PAIDI. 2005-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of research capacity in business and the low participation of the private sector in research has resulted in R&amp;D taking place largely in the public sector.

The Council of Innovation, Science and Business is the organ of the autonomous government responsible for universities, research, technological development, industry, and energy. The council coordinates and initiates scientific and technical innovation through specialized centers an initiatives such as the [[Andalusian Center for Marine Science and Technology]] (''Centro Andaluz de Ciencia y Tecnología Marina'') and [[Technological Corporation of Andalusia]] (''Corporación Tecnológica de Andalucía'').

Within the private sphere, although also promoted by public administration, technology parks have been established throughout the Community, such as the [[Technological Park of Andalucia]] (''Parque Tecnológico de Andalucía'') in [[Campanillas]] on the outskirts of Málaga, and [[Cartuja 93]] in Seville. Some of these parks specialize in specific sector, such as [[Aerópolis]] in [[aerospace]] or [[Geolit]] in [[food technology]]. The Andalusian government deployed 600,000 [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] desktop computers in their schools.

==Media==
Andalusia has international, national, regional, and local media organizations, which are active gathering and disseminating information (as well as creating and disseminating information entertainment).

The most notable is the public [[Radio y Televisión de Andalucía]] (RTVA), broadcasting on two regional television channels, [[Canal Sur]] and [[Canal Sur 2]], four regional radio stations, [[Canal Sur Radio]], [[Canal Fiesta Radio]], [[Radio Andalucía Información]] and [[Canal Flamenco Radio]], as well as various digital signals, most notably [[Andalucía Televisión]] available on [[cable television|cable TV]] throughout Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title = Medios de comunicación en Red Andaluza
|accessdate = 2008-10-08
|author = Andalucía Comunidad Cultural}} That web page gives a rather complete listing of Andalusian media organizations.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspapers===
Different newspapers are published for each Andalusian provincial capital, [[comarca]], or important city. Often, the same newspaper organization publishes different local editions with much shared content, with different [[masthead (publishing)|mastheads]] and different local coverage. There are also popular papers distributed without charge, again typically with local editions that share much of their content.

No single Andalusian newspaper is distributed throughout the region, not even with local editions. In eastern Andalusia the ''[[Diario Ideal]]'' has edition in the provinces if Almería, Granada, and Jaén. [[Grupo Joly]] is based in Andalucia, backed by Andalusian capital, and publishes eight daily newspapers there. Efforts to create a newspaper for the entire autonomous region have not succeeded (the most recent as of 2009 was the ''[[Diario de Andalucía]]''). The national press (''[[El País]]'', ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'', etc.) include sections or editions specific to Andalusia.

=== Public television ===
[[File:Antigua Estación de Tren y Sede de RTVA en Córdoba, España.jpg|thumb|[[Radio y Televisión de Andalucía|RTVA]]'s headquarters, a former train station in Córdoba.]]

Andalusia has two public television stations, both operated by [[Radio y Televisión de Andalucía]] (RTVA):
* [[Canal Sur]] first broadcast on 28 February 1989 ([[Día de Andalucía]]).
* [[Canal Sur 2]] first broadcast 5 June 1998. Programming focuses on culture, sports, and programs for children and youth.

In addition, RTVA also operates the national and international cable channel [[Andalucía Televisión]], which first broadcast in 1996.

=== Radio ===
There are four public radio stations in the region, all operated by RTVA:
* [[Canal Sur Radio]] first broadcast October 1988.
* [[Canal Fiesta Radio]] first broadcast January 2001.
* [[Radio Andalucía Información]] first broadcast September 1998.
* [[Canal Flamenco Radio]], first broadcast 29 September 2008.

== Art and culture==
[[File:FlamencoSevilla.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flamenco]] culture is native to Andalusia.]]

The culture of Andalusia has been shaped by its particular history and geography, as well as its complex flows of population. Andalusia has been home to a succession of peoples and civilizations, many very different from one another, each impacting the settled inhabitants. The ancient [[Iberians]] were followed by [[Celts]], [[Phoenicia]]ns and other Eastern Mediterranean traders, [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Visigoths]], North African [[Muslim]]s, and the [[Castilian people|Castilians]] and other Spanish of the ''[[Reconquista]]'', not to mention the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Jews]], [[Romani people in Spain|Romani people]], and others who have lived in Andalusia in large numbers at one or another time, without ever being the holders of power. All have affected Andalusian identity and culture, which was already delineated in the 19th century and diffused widely in the literary and pictorial genre of the ''[[costumbrismo andaluz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In the 19th century, Andalusian culture came to be widely viewed as the Spanish culture ''par excellence'', in part thanks to the perceptions of [[romanticism|romantic]] travellers. In the words of [[José Ortega y Gasset|Ortega y Gasset]]:

{{quote|Andalusia, which has never shown the swagger nor petulancy of particularism; that has never pretended to the status of a State apart, is, of all the Spanish regions, the one that possesses a culture most radically its own. Throughout the 19th century, Spain has submitted itself to the hegemonic influence of Andalusia. That century began with the [[Cádiz Cortes]]; it ended with the assassination of [[Antonio Cánovas del Castillo|Cánovas del Castillo]], ''malagueño'' [from Málaga], and the exaltation of [[Francisco Silvela|Silvela]], no less ''malagueño''. The dominant ideas have an Andalusian accent. One paints Andalusia: a roof-terrace, some flowerpots, blue sky. One reads southern authors. One speaks at all times of the &quot;land of the Most Holy Virgin Mary&quot;. The thief from the Sierra Morena and the smuggler are national heroes. All Spain feels its existence justified by the honor of having on its flanks the Andalusian piece of the planet. Around 1900, like so many other things, this changes. The North sits up.&lt;ref&gt;José Ortega y Gasset, [http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Teor%C3%ADa_de_Andaluc%C3%ADa_%28versi%C3%B3n_para_imprimir%29 ''Teoría de Andalucía''], 1927, online at Wikisource in Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt;|Ortega y Gasset, ''Teoría de Andalucía'', 1927}}

===Arts===
Andalusia has been the birthplace of many great artists: the classic painters [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]], and [[Juan de Valdés Leal]]; the sculptors [[Juan Martínez Montañés]] and [[Alonso Cano]]; and such modern painters as [[Daniel Vázquez Díaz]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. 

The composer [[Manuel de Falla]] was from Cádiz and incorporated typical Andalusian melodies in his works, as did [[Joaquín Turina]], from Seville. The great singer [[Camarón de la Isla]] was born in [[San Fernando, Cádiz]], and [[Andrés Segovia]] who helped shape the romantic-modernist approach to [[classical guitar]], was born in [[Linares, Jaén]].

====Architecture====
[[File:Alhambradesdegeneralife.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Alhambra]], seen from the gardens of the Generalife in the [[Albaicín]].]]
Since the [[Neolithic]] era, Andalusia has preserved important [[megalith]]s, such as the [[dolmen]]s at the [[Cueva de Menga]] and the [[Dolmen de Viera]], both at [[Antequera]]. Archeologists have found [[Bronze Age]] cities at [[Los Millares]] and [[El Argar]]. Archeological digs at Doña Blanca in [[El Puerto de Santa María]] have revealed the oldest [[Phoenicia]]ns city in the Iberian peninsula; major ruins have also been revealed at Roman [[Italica]] near Seville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Some of the greatest architecture in Andalusia dates from the Muslim era: the [[Alhambra]], portions of the [[Albaicín]], and [[Madrasah of Granada]]; the [[Great Mosque of Córdoba]] and the [[Giralda]] in Seville, now both converted into cathedrals; the [[Alcázar of Seville]], largely a [[mudéjar]] achievement (that is, the work of Muslims who remained in Spain after the Reconquista).{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}
[[File:Patio de Córdoba.jpg|thumb|upright|A ''patio andaluz'' in Córdoba.]]
The traditional architecture of Andalusia retains its [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Islamic architecture|Arab]] roots, with a marked Mediterranean character strongly conditioned by the climate. Traditional urban houses are constructed with shared walls to minimize exposure to high exterior temperatures. Solid exterior walls are [[Whitewash|painted]] with [[Lime (material)|lime]] to minimize the heating effects of the sun. In accord with the climate and tradition of each area, the roofs may be [[Terrace (building)|terraces]] or tiled in the Roman [[imbrex and tegula]] style. One of the most characteristic elements (and one of the most obviously influenced by Roman and [[Moorish architecture|North African architecture]]) is the interior [[patio]] or [[courtyard]]; the patios of Córdoba are particularly famous. Other characteristic elements are decorative (and functional) [[wrought iron]] [[grating]]s, and the [[tile]]s known as ''[[azulejo]]s''. Landscaping—both for common private homes and on a more lavish scale—also carries on older traditions, with plants, flowers, and fountains, pools, and streams of water. Beyond these general elements, there are also specific local architectural styles, such as the [[flat roof]]s, roofed chimneys, and radically extended [[Balcony|balconies]] of the [[Alpujarra]], the cave dwellings of [[Guadix]] and of Granada's [[Sacromonte]], or the traditional architecture of the [[Mancomunidad de Municipios Marquesado del Zenete|Marquisate of Zenete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Gran Teatro Falla.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gran Teatro Falla]] in Cádiz.]]The monumental architecture of the centuries immediately after the Reconquista often displayed an assertion of Christian hegemony through architecture that referenced non-Arab influences.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Some of the greatest [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] buildings in Andalusia are from the [[Kingdom of Jaén|then-kingdom of Jaén]]: the [[Jaén Cathedral]], designed in parte by [[Andrés de Vandelvira]], served as a model for the [[Cathedral of Malaga]] and [[Cathedral of Guadix|of Guadix]]; the centers of [[Úbeda]] and [[Baeza]], dating largely from this era, are UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s. Seville and its kingdom also figured prominently in this era, as is shown by the [[Casa consistorial de Sevilla]], the [[Hospital de las Cinco Llagas]] or the [[Charterhouse of Jerez de la Frontera]]. The [[Palace of Charles V]] in Granada is uniquely important for its [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] purism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[Iberian sculpture|Iberian reliefs]] of [[Osuna]], [[Lady of Baza]], and [[León de Bujalance]], the Phoenecian [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] of Cádiz, and the [[Roman sculpture]]s of the [[Baetica|Baetic]] cities such as [[Italica]] give evidence of traditions of sculpture in Andalusia dating back to antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Sevillian school of sculpture]] dating from the 13th century onward and the [[Granadan school of sculpture|Granadan school]] beginning toward the end of the 16th century both focused primarily on Christian religious subject matter, including many wooden [[altarpiece]]s. Notable sculptors in these traditions include [[Lorenzo Mercadante de Bretaña]], [[Pedro Millán]], [[Juan Martínez Montañés]], [[Pedro Roldán]], [[José de Arce]], [[Jerónimo de Balbás|Jerónimo Balbás]], [[Alonso Cano]], and [[Pedro de Mena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Non-religious sculpture has also existed in Andalusia since antiquity. A fine example from the Renaissance era is the decoration of the [[Casa de Pilatos]] in Seville. Nonetheless, non-religious sculpture played a relatively minor role until such 19th century sculptors as [[Antonio Susillo]].

==== Painting ====
[[File:Pablo picasso 1.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Ruiz Picasso]], born in Málaga.]]
As in sculpture, there were [[Sevillian school of painting|Sevillian]] and the [[Granadan school of painting|Granadan]] schools of painting. The latter has figured prominently in the history of Spanish art since the 15th century and includes such important artists as [[Francisco Zurbarán|Zurbarán]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]], as well as [[aesthetics|theoreticians of art]] such as [[Francisco Pacheco]].

Important artists in this genre include [[Manuel Barrón]], [[José García Ramos]], [[Gonzalo Bilbao Martínez]] and [[Julio Romero de Torres]].

=== Literature and philosophy ===
[[File:Grammatica Nebrissensis.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The 1492 ''Gramática'' by [[Antonio de Nebrija]].]]

Andalusia plays a significant role in the history of [[Spanish language]] literature, however not all of the important literature associated with Andalusia was written in Spanish. Before 1492, there was the literature written in [[Andalusian Arabic]]. Hispano-Arabic authors native to the region include 
[[Ibn Hazm]], [[Ibn Zaydun]], [[Ibn Tufail]], [[Al-Mu'tamid]], [[Ibn al-Jatib]], [[Ibn al-Yayyab]], and [[Ibn Zamrak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1492 [[Antonio de Nebrija]] published his celebrated ''[[Gramática de la lengua castellana]]'' (&quot;Grammar of the Castilian language&quot;), the first such work for a modern European language. In 1528 [[Francisco Delicado]] wrote ''[[Portrait of Lozana: The Lusty Andalusian Woman|La lozana andaluza]]'', a [[novel]] in the orbit of ''[[La Celestina]]'', and in 1599 the Sevillian [[Mateo Alemán]] wrote the first part of ''[[Guzmán de Alfarache]]'', the first [[picaresque novel]] with a known author. 

The prominent [[humanism|humanist]] literary school of Seville included such writers as [[Juan de Mal Lara]], [[Fernando de Herrera]], [[Gutierre de Cetina]], [[Luis Barahona de Soto]], [[Juan de la Cueva]], [[Gonzalo Argote de Molina]], and [[Rodrigo Caro]]. The Cordoban [[Luis de Góngora y Argote|Luis de Góngora]] was the greatest exponent of the ''[[culteranismo]]'' of [[Baroque]] poetry in the [[Siglo de Oro]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Literary Romanticism in Spain had one of its great centers in Andalusia, with such authors as [[Ángel de Saavedra, Duke of Rivas]], [[José Cadalso]] and [[Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer]]. ''Costumbrismo andaluz'' existed in literature as much as in visual art, with notable examples being the ''Escenas andaluzas'' of [[Serafín Estébanez Calderón]] and the works of [[Pedro Antonio de Alarcón]]. 

Andalusian authors [[Ángel Ganivet]], [[Manuel Gómez-Moreno]], [[Manuel Machado y Ruiz|Manuel]] and [[Antonio Machado]], and [[Francisco Villaespesa]] are all generally counted in the [[Generation of '98]]. Also of this generation were the [[Hermanos Álvarez Quintero]], dramatists who faithfully captured [[Andalusian Spanish|Andalusian dialects]] and idiosyncrasies. Also of note, 1956 [[Nobel Prize]]-winning poet [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]] was a native of [[Moguer]], near Huelva. 

A large portion of the ''[[avant garde]]'' [[Generation of '27]] who gathered at the [[Ateneo de Sevilla]] on the 300th anniversary of Góngora's death were Andalusians: [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Luis Cernuda]], [[Rafael Alberti]], [[Manuel Altolaguirre]], [[Emilio Prados]], and 1977 Nobel laureate [[Vicente Aleixandre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Certain Andalusian fictional characters have become universal archetypes: [[Prosper Merimée]]'s gypsy ''Carmen'', [[Pierre Beaumarchais]]'s ''Fígaro'', and [[Tirso de Molina]]'s ''Don Juan''.

As in most regions of Spain, the principal form of popular verse is the [[romance (meter)|romance]], although there are also [[strophe]]s specific to Andalusia, such as the ''[[soleá]]'' or the ''[[soleariya]]''. Ballads, lullabies, street vendor's cries, nursery rhymes, and work songs are plentiful.

Among the philosophers native to the region can be counted [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Maimonides]], [[Averroes]], [[Fernán Pérez de Oliva]], [[Sebastián Fox Morcillo]], [[Ángel Ganivet]], [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]], and [[María Zambrano]].

=== Music of Andalusia ===
[[File:Baile por Bulerias.jpg|thumb|upright|''Baile por [[bulerías]]'', by [[José García Ramos]].]]
{{Main|Music of Andalusia}}

The music of Andalusia includes traditional and contemporary music, folk and composed music, and ranges from [[flamenco]] to [[rock music|rock]]. Conversely, certain metric, melodic and harmonic characteristics are considered Andalusian even when written or performed by musicians from elsewhere.

[[Flamenco]], perhaps the most characteristically Andalusian genre of music and dance, originated in the 18th century, but is based in earlier forms from the region. The influence of the traditional music and dance of the [[Romani people in Spain|Romani people]] or Gypsies is particularly clear. The genre embraces distinct vocal (''[[cante flamenco]]''), guitar (''[[toque flamenco]]''), and dance (''[[baile flamenco]]'') styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Andalusian Statute of Autonomy reflects the cultural importance of flamenco in its Articles 37.1.18 and 68:

{{Quote|Guiding principles of public policy: 18th The preservation and enhancement of the cultural, historic and artistic heritage of Andalusia, especially flamenco.&lt;ref&gt;From Article 37.1.18 of the Andalusian Statute of Autonomy: ''Principios rectores de las políticas públicas: 18º La conservación y puesta en valor del patrimonio cultural, histórico y artístico de Andalucía, especialmente del flamenco.''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Also within the Autonomous Community (of Andalucia) is the exclusive competence in knowledge, conservation, research, training, promotion and dissemination of flamenco as a unique element of the Andalusian cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;From Article 68 of the Andalusian Statute of Autonomy: ''Corresponde asimismo a la Comunidad Autónoma (Andaluza) la competencia exclusiva en materia de conocimiento, conservación, investigación, formación, promoción y difusión del flamenco como elemento singular del patrimonio cultural andaluz.''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fundamental in the history of Andalusian music are the composers [[Cristóbal de Morales]], [[Francisco Guerrero (composer)|Francisco Guerrero]], [[Francisco Correa de Arauxo]], [[Manuel del Pópulo Vicente García|Manuel García]], [[Manuel de Falla]], [[Joaquín Turina]], and [[Manuel Castillo]], as well as the father of modern [[classical guitar]], the guitarist [[Andrés Segovia]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Mention should also be made of the great folk artists of the ''[[copla (music)]]'' and the ''[[cante hondo]]'', such as [[Rocío Jurado]], [[Lola Flores]] (''La Faraona'', &quot;the [[pharaoh]]&quot;), [[Juanito Valderrama]] and the revolutionary [[Camarón de la Isla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flamenco-world.com/tienda/autor/camaron-de-la-isla/13/ |title=Camarón de la Isla |accessdate = 2008-06-10 |author=Ferca Network |publisher=Zerobox | language = Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent Andalusian rock groups include [[Triana (band)|Triana]] and [[Medina Azahara (band)|Medina Azahara]]. The duo [[Los del Río]] from [[Dos Hermanas]] had international success with their &quot;[[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]&quot;, including playing at a [[Super Bowl]] half-time show in the [[United States]], where their song has also been used as campaign music by the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antonioburgos.com/sevilla/sevillanos/1999/04/se042599.html |title=Los del Río, o cómo hacerse perdonar el éxito |accessdate=2008-05-10 |author=Antonio Burgos  |year=1998 | work=S.L.

=== Film ===
[[File:Filmoteca de Andalucía, Córdoba.jpg|thumb|upright|Entrance to the Filmoteca de Andalucía in Córdoba.]]

The portrayal of Andalusia in film is often reduced to archetypes: [[flamenco]], [[Spanish-style bullfighting|bullfighting]], Catholic pageantry, [[outlaw|brigands]], the property-rich and cash-poor ''señorito andaluz'' and emigrants. These images particularly predominated from the 1940s through the 1960s, and helped to consolidate a cliched image of the region. In a very different vein, the province of Almería was the filming location for many [[Western (genre)|Western]]s, especially (but by no means exclusively) the Italian-directed [[Spaghetti Western]]s. During the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]], this was the extent of the film industry in Andalusia.

Nonetheless, Andalusian film has roots as far back as [[José Val del Omar]] in the pre-Franco years, and since the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] has brought forth numerous nationally and internationally respected directors: [[Antonio Cuadri]] (''[[Heart of the Earth]]''), [[Chus Gutiérrez]] (''[[Poniente (film)|Poniente]]''), [[Chiqui Carabante]] (''[[Carlos Against the World]]''), [[Alberto Rodríguez Librero|Alberto Rodríguez]] (''[[7 Virgins]]''), [[Antonio Banderas]] (''[[Summer Rain (2006 film)|Summer Rain]]''), and [[Benito Zambrano]] (''[[Solas (film)|Solas]]'').

Counting together feature films, documentaries, television programs, music videos etc., Andalusia has boomed from 37 projects shooting in 1999 to 1,054 in 2007, with the figure for 2007 including 19 feature films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andaluciafilm.com/Noticias/NoticiasNoticia.asp?desde=3&amp;id=191 Andalucía alcanza los 1.000 rodajes gestionados por la Red de Ciudades de Cine de AFC], 2008-07-30, www.andaluciafilm.com. Accessed online 2009-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Although feature films are the most prestigious, commercials and television are currently more economically important to the region.

The [[Filmoteca de Andalucía]], headquartered in Córdoba, is a government-run entity in charge of the investigation, collection and diffusion of Andalusian cinematic heritage. Other important contributors to this last activity are such annual film festivals as the [[Málaga Festival of Spanish Film]], the [[Seville Festival of European Film]] (SFCE), the [[International Festival of Short Films - Almería in Short]], the [[Huelva Festival of Latin American Film]], the [[Atlantic Film Show]] in Cádiz, the [[Islantilla Festival of Film and Televison]] and the [[Tarifa Festival of African Film]].&lt;!-- Not sure if some of these festivals may have established names in English, which we should use if they do. In Spanish they are:
Festival de cine español de Málaga,
Festival de cine europeo de Sevilla,
Festival Internacional de Cortometrajes Almería en Corto,
Festival de Cine Iberoamericano de Huelva,
Muestra Cinematográfica del Atlántico Alcances,
Festival de cine y televisión de Islantilla,
Festival de Cine Africano de Tarifa.

=== Culture===

====Customs and Society====
Andalusia has a wide array of social customs, many of which have their roots in the Islamic traditions integrated into the area under Muslim rule.  Each sub region in Andalusia has its own unique customs that are closely tied to a combination Catholicism and local folklore. Traditional dress in all areas of Andalusia tends to be colorful and involve various head coverings reminiscent of a Muslim past.  Cities like Almeria are influenced by both Granada and Murcia, with the use of traditional head coverings.  The sombrero de labrador, meaning worker’s hats made of black velvet are a signature style of this area. In Cadiz costumes in society often show rural roots with bullfights and massive parties occurring on many of the large estates. The tablado flamenco  and the cante jondo originate from Granada. They are believed to have their roots in oriental, Gregorian, Moorish, and Jewish music. Presently this music tends to be performed by gypsies. Gypsies are more common in Granada than anywhere else in Spain. In Huelva, one of the most distinct events is the gypsy Romeria del Rocio in May. It consists of a pilgrimage to a statue of the Virgin Mary, which was supposedly hidden from the Muslims. Legend has it that when it was rediscovered and moved the Virgin asked to be returned to the woods. After it was moved back a hermitage was build and many believers join this pilgrimage around Easter time every year. In Jaen, the saeta is a type of expression popular in the region. It is a form of chanting to the Virgin Mary, which is supposed to show ones’ religious devotion. Malaga, is the birthplace of Spanish bull-fighting. The region also has a rich musical tradition that is mostly derived from Arab songs called cartageneras.  Seville the largest province in Andalusia holds the Semana Santa the largest festival in Spain. During the festival religious fraternities dress as penitents (pilgrim worshipers) carrying huge altars. Songs and dances known as sevilanas, which demonstrate Middle-Easter origins are performed at such festivals. Overall, all the regions of Andalusia have developed distinct customs, but all share a connectedness to Catholicism and the region’s Arabic cultural past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kern|title=The Regions of Spain|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-29224-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Andalusian Spanish====
[[File:Andalucía ceceante y seseante.PNG|thumb|300px|Most Spanish dialects in Spain differentiate between the sound of &quot;z&quot; and &quot;c&quot; (before e and i), pronounced {{IPA|/θ/}}, and that of &quot;s&quot;, pronounced {{IPA|/s/}}. This distinction is lost in many Andalusian-speaking areas. In some mostly southerly areas, shown here in red, all three letters are pronounced {{IPA|/θ/}}, which is known as ''[[Ceceo]]''. In other areas, all three letters are pronounced ({{IPA|/s/}}), which is known as ''[[Seseo]]''. Still other areas retain the distinction found elsewhere in Spain.]]
{{Main|Andalusian Spanish}}

[[Andalusian Spanish]] is one of the most widely spoken forms of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in Spain, and because of emigration patterns was very influential on [[Spanish language in the Americas|American Spanish]]. Rather than a single dialect, it is really a range of dialects sharing some common features; among these is the retention of more [[Arabic language|Arabic]] words than elsewhere in Spain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Fernández-Sevilla, Julio| title = Objetividad y subjetividad.

The [[isogloss]]es that mark the borders of Andalusian Spanish overlap to form a network of divergent boundaries, so there is no clear border for the linguistic region.&lt;ref&gt;For some maps of various isoglosses, see the online [http://www.jotamartin.byethost33.com/alpi0_e.php Isogloss maps for Iberian Peninsula Spanish, according to ALPI].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mythology and religion====
[[File:DSC04791AMOR.jpg|left|thumb|Procession with statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary of the Love of Saint Ferdinand ( ''Maria santísima del amor de San Fernando''), Cádiz.]]
The territory now known as Andalusia fell within the sphere of influence of ancient Mediterranean [[mythology|mythological]] beliefs. Phoenician colonization brought the cults of [[Baal]] and [[Melqart]]; the latter lasted into Roman times as [[Hercules]], mythical founder of both Cádiz and Seville. The [[Islote de Sancti Petri]] held the supposed tomb of Hercules, with representations of his [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve labors]]; the region was the traditional site of the tenth labor, obtaining the cattle of the monster [[Geryon]]. Traditionally, the [[Pillars of Hercules]] flank the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. Clearly, the European pillar is the [[Rock of Gibraltar]]; the African pillar was presumably either [[Monte Hacho]] in [[Ceuta]] or [[Jebel Musa, Morocco|Jebel Musa]] in [[Morocco]]. The [[Roman road]] that led from Cádiz to Rome was known by several names, one of them being ''[[Via Herculea]]'', Hercules route returning from his tenth labor. The present [[coat of arms of Andalusia]] shows Hercules between two lions, with two pillars behind these figures.

The principal characteristic of the local popular form of Catholicism is devotion to the [[Virgin Mary]]; Andalusia is sometimes known as ''la tierra de María Santísima'' (&quot;the land of Most Holy Mary&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=tierra ''la tierra de María Santísima'' in the dictionary of the [[Real Academia Española]].]&lt;/ref&gt; Also characteristic are the processions during [[Holy Week]], in which thousands of [[penance|penitents]] (known as ''nazarenos'') sing [[saeta (flamenco)|saetas]]. Andalusia is the site of such [[pilgrim]] destinations as the [[Santuario de Nuestra Señora de la Cabeza]] in [[Andújar]] and the [[Hermitage of El Rocío]] in [[Almonte, Spain|Almonte]].

====Bullfighting====
[[File:joselito natural.jpg|thumb|[[José Gómez Ortega]]: Joselito &quot;El Gallo&quot;.]]
While some trace the lineage of the [[Spanish Fighting Bull]] back to Roman times, today's fighting bulls in the Iberian peninsula and in the former [[Spanish Empire]] trace back to Andalusia in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref name=repetida_1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=638755 |title=Las plazas de toros de Andalucía y su incidencia turística |accessdate=2008-10-06 |author=Gabriel A.

The oldest bullring still in use in Spain is the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] ''[[Plaza de Toros de Ronda|Plaza de toros]]'' in [[Ronda]], built in 1784. The Andalusian Autonomous Government sponsors the ''Rutas de Andalucía taurina'', a touristic route through the region centered on bullfighting.

====Festivals====
[[File:Cruz de mayo bailio.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cruz de mayo]] of the [[confraternity]] Hermandad de la Paz y Esperanza (&quot;Brotherhood of Peace and Hope&quot;), [[Cuesta del Bailío]], Córdoba.]]
The Andalusian festivals provide a showcase for popular arts and traditional costume. Among the most famous of these are the [[Seville Fair]] or ''Feria de Abril'' in Seville, now echoed by smaller fairs in Madrid and Barcelona, both of which have many Andalusian immigrants; the ''[[Feria de Agosto]]'' in Málaga; the [[Feria de Jerez]] or ''Feria del Caballo'' in Jerez; the Festival of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] in Granada; the [[Feria de Nuestra Señora de la Salud]] in Córdoba; the [[Columbian Festivals]] (''Fiestas Colombinas'') in Huelva; the [[Feria de la Virgen del Mar]] in [[Almería]]; and the [[Feria de San Lucas (Jaén)|Feria de San Lucas]] in Jaén, among many others.

Festivals of a religious nature are a deep Andalusian tradition and are met with great popular fervor. There are numerous major festivals during [[Holy Week]]. An annual pilgrimage brings a million visitors to the Hermitage of El Rocío in Almonte (population 16,914 in 2008); similarly large crowds visit the Santuario de Nuestra Señora de la Cabeza in Andújar every April.

Other important festivals are the [[Carnival of Cádiz]] and the [[Fiesta de las Cruces]] or [[Cruz de mayo]] in Granada and Córdoba; in Córdoba this is combined with a competition for among the ''patios'' (courtyards) of the city.

    Andalusia hosts an annual festival for the dance of Flamenco in the summer-time.

====Cuisine====
{{Main|Andalusian cuisine}}
[[File:Tomato gazpacho.jpg|thumb|''[[Gazpacho]]'' served with ''tropezones'' (chopped vegetables).]]
The Andalusian diet varies, especially between the coast and the interior, but in general is a [[Mediterranean diet]] based on [[olive oil]], [[cereal]]s, [[legume]]s, [[vegetable]]s, [[fish]], [[dried fruit]]s and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], and [[meat]]; there is also a great tradition of drinking [[wine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Fried fish]]—''pescaíto frito''—and [[seafood]] are common on the coast and also eaten well into the interior under coastal influence. [[Northern bluefin tuna]] (''Thunnus thynnus'') from the [[Almadraba]] areas of the [[Gulf of Cádiz]], [[prawn]]s from [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]] (known as ''langostino de Sanlúcar''), and [[Deepwater Rose Shrimp]] (''Parapenaeus longirostris'') from Huelva are all highly prized. Fishing for the Transparent Goby or ''Chanquete'' (''[[Aphia minuta]]''), a once-popular small fish from Málaga, is now banned because the techniques used to catch them trap too many immature fish of [[Bycatch|other species]].&lt;ref&gt;Resolución del 20 de junio de 1988 de la Dirección General de Pesca, por la que se establece una pesca indefinida para la pesca del Aphia minuta (chanquete) y similares (BOJA nº57 de 19 de julio de 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Jamón de Huelva.jpg|thumb|left|The name [[D.O. Jamón de Huelva|Jamón de Huelva]] is protected as a [[Denominación de Origen]].]]
The mountainous regions of the Sierra Morena and Sierra Nevada produce cured [[ham]]s, notably including ''[[jamón serrano]]'' and ''[[jamón ibérico]]''. These come from two different types of pig, (''jamón serrano'' from white pigs, the more expensive ''jamón ibérico'' from the [[Black Iberian pig]]. There are several [[Denominación de Origen|Denominaciones de Origen]], each with its own specifications including in just which [[microclimate]] region ham of a particular denomination must be cured. ''[[Plato alpujarreño]]'' is another mountain specialty, a dish combining ham, sausage, sometimes other pork, egg, potatoes, and olive oil.

[[Confectionery]] is popular in Andalusia. [[Almond]]s and [[honey]] are common ingredients. Many enclosed [[convent]]s of [[nun]]s make and sell pastries, especially Christmas pastries: ''[[mantecado]]s'', ''[[polvorón|polvorones]]'', ''[[pestiño]]s'', ''[[alfajor]]es'', ''[[yemas de San Leandro]]'', as well as ''[[churro]]s'' or ''tejeringos'', [[meringue]] cookies (''merengadas''), and ''[[amarguillo]]s''.

Cereal-based dishes include ''[[migas]] de harina'' in eastern Andalusia (a bit closer to a [[porridge]] than what ''migas'' means elsewhere in Spain) and a sweeter, more aromatic porridge called ''[[poleá]]'' in western Andalusia.
Vegetables form the basis of such dishes as ''[[alboronía]]'' (similar to ''ratatouille'') and the chopped salad known as ''[[pipirrana]]'' or ''piriñaca''. Hot and cold soups based in olive oil, garlic, bread, tomato and peppers include ''[[gazpacho]]'', ''[[salmorejo]]'', ''[[porra antequerana]]'', ''[[ajo caliente]]'', ''[[sopa campera]]'', or—using almonds instead of tomato—''[[ajoblanco]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Wine has a privileged place at the Andalusian table. Andalusian wines are known worldwide, especially [[fortified wine]]s such as [[sherry]] (''jerez''), aged in [[solera]]s. These are enormously varied; for example, dry sherry may be the very distinct ''[[fino]]'', ''[[manzanilla (wine)|manzanilla]]'', ''[[amontillado]]'', ''[[oloroso]]'', or ''[[Palo Cortado]]'' and each of these varieties can each be sweetened with [[Pedro Ximénez]] or [[Muscat of Alexandria|Moscatel]] to produce a different variety of sweet sherry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Andalusia also produces D.O. [[vinegar]] and [[brandy]]: [[D.O. Vinagre de Jerez]] and [[D.O. Brandy de Jerez]].&lt;ref name=MAPA-DO /&gt;

The traditional dress of 18th century Andalusia was strongly influenced by ''[[majo|majismo]]'' within the context of ''[[castizo|casticismo]]'' (purism, traditionalism, authenticity). The archetype of the ''majo'' and ''maja'' was that of a bold, pure Spaniard from a lower-class background, somewhat flamboyant in his or her style of dress. This emulation of lower-class dress also extended to imitating the clothes of brigands and [[Romani people in Spain|Romani]] (&quot;Gypsy&quot;) women.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The [[Museum of Arts and Traditions of Sevilla]] &lt;!-- that's the name the institution itself uses in English, including the Spanish spelling &quot;Sevilla&quot; --&gt; has collected representative samples of a great deal of the history of Andalusian dress, including examples of such notable types of hat as the ''[[sombrero cordobés]], ''[[sombrero calañés]], ''[[sombrero de catite]]'' and the ''[[pavero]]'', as well as the ''[[traje corto]]'' and ''[[traje de flamenca]]''.

Andalusia has a great artisan tradition in [[tile]], [[leather]] (''see [[Shell cordovan]]''), [[weaving]] (especially of the heavy ''[[jarapa]]'' cloth), [[marquetry]], and [[ceramic]]s (especially in Jaén, Granada, and Almería), [[lace]] (especially Granada and Huelva), [[embroidery]] (in [[Andévalo]]), [[ironwork]], [[woodworking]], and [[basketry]] in [[wicker]], many of these traditions a heritage of the long period of Muslim rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Andalusian equestrianism, institutionalized in the [[Royal Andalusian School of Equestrian Art]] is known well beyond the borders of Spain. The [[Andalusian horse]] is strongly built, compact yet elegant, distinguished in the area of [[dressage]] and [[show jumping]], and is also an excellent horse for [[driving (horse)|driving]]. They are known for their elegant &quot;dancing&quot; [[gait]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realescuela.org/home.htm Real Escuela Andaluza de Arte Ecuestre], official site.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sports ==
===Team sports===
In Andalusia, as throughout Spain, [[Association football|football]] is the predominant sport. Introduced to Spain by [[United Kingdom|British]] men who worked in mining for [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] in the province of Huelva, the sport soon became popular with the local population. A Spain's oldest existing soccer club, [[Recreativo de Huelva]], founded 1889, is known as ''El Decano'' (&quot;the Dean&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As of 2009, four Andalusian teams compete in Spains' First Division &quot;[[La Liga]]&quot;: [[UD Almería]], [[Sevilla FC]], [[Xerez CD]], and [[Málaga CF]]. Of those, only Sevilla FC has ever won &quot;La Liga&quot; (in the 1945–1946 season) or an international competition (the [[2006 UEFA Super Cup]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Real Betis has just ascended to first divisison again.

The [[Andalusia autonomous football team]] is not in any league, and plays only [[exhibition game|friendly matches]]. In recent years, they have played mostly during the Christmas break of the football leagues. They play mostly against national teams from other countries, but would not be eligible for international league play, where Spain is represented by a single national team.

In recent decades, [[basketball]] has become increasingly popular, with [[CB Málaga]] (also known as '''Unicaja Málaga''', who have won the [[Liga ACB]] in 2007 and the [[Korać Cup]] in 2001 and usually play the [[Euroleague]]), [[CB Sevilla]] (Cajasol), and [[CB Granada]] competing at the top level in the [[Liga ACB]].&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed history of basketball in Andalucia, see: {{cite book

Unlike basketball, [[Team handball|handball]] has never really taken off in Andalusia. There are two Andalusian teams in the [[Liga ASOBAL|Liga Asobal]], Spain's premier handball league: [[BM Antequera]] and [[BM Ciudad de Almería]] (Keymare Almería). Neither has a following or media coverage comparable to football or basketball, and neither is a national contender.

Andalusia's strongest showing in sports has been in [[Ping Pong]]. There are two professional teams: [[Cajasur Priego TM]] and [[Caja Granada TM]], the latter being Spain's leading table tennis team, with more than 20 league championships in nearly consecutive years and 14 consecutive Copas del Rey, dominating the [[Liga ENEBÉ]]. Cajasur is also one of the league's leading teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fttcv.org/webnueva/liga0708_eligamenu.asp?idm=2&amp;idsm=0&amp;IDNIVEL=11&amp;IDGRUPO=%DANICO LIGAS NACIONALES / Liga &quot;Arteal Ventanas&quot; Superdivisión Masculina], Real Federación Española de Tenis de Mesa], accessed 2009-12-17 cites for the current prominent status of these teams.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} &lt;!-- need citation for the championships --&gt;

===Olympics===
220 Andalusian athletes have competed in a total of 16 summer or winter [[Olympic Games]]. The first was [[Leopoldo Sáinz de la Maza]], part of the silver-medal-winning [[polo]] team at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} 

In all, Andalusians have won 6 gold medals, 11 silver, and 2 bronze. Winners of multiple medals include the Cordoban [[boxing|boxer]] [[Rafael Lozano]] (bronze in the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] at [[Atlanta, Georgia]], USA and silver in the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in [[Sydney]], Australia); sailor [[Theresa Zabell]], Malagueña by adoption (gold medals at [[Barcelona]] in [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] and Atlanta in 1996). Other notable winners have been Granadan [[tennis]] player [[Manuel Orantes]] (silver in the men's singles of the [[Tennis at the 1968 Summer Olympics|demonstration tournament]] in [[Mexico City]]in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]), Jerezano riders [[Ignacio Rambla]] and [[Rafael Soto]] (silver in [[dressage]] in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]]) and the [[racewalking|racewalker]] [[Paquillo Fernández]] from [[Guadix]] (silver in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]]). 

The largest number of Olympic appearances were by the Malagueña swimmer [[María Peláez]] (five appearances), the Granadan skier [[María José Rienda]] (four), the Sevillian rider [[Luis Astolfi]] (four), and the Sevillian rower [[Fernando Climent Huerta]] (four, including a silver at [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], USA in [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Seville has been a pre-candidate to host the Summer Olympics in two occasions, 2004 and 2008, and Granada has been a pre-candidate to host the winter Olympics; neither has ever succeeded in its candidature.

===Other sports===
Other sporting events in Andalusia include [[surfing]], [[kitesurfing]] and [[windsurfing]] competitions at [[Tarifa]], various [[golf]] tournaments at courses along the coast, and [[horse racing]] and polo at several locations in the interior. Andalusia hosted the [[1999 World Championships in Athletics]] (Seville), the [[2005 Mediterranean Games]] (Almería) and the [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1996]] (Granada), among other major events. There is also the annual [[Vuelta a Andalucía]] bicycle road race and the [[Linares chess tournament]].

== Sister region ==
Andalusia has a [[sister cities|sister region]] relationship with [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/internacionales/docs/convenios_hermanamientos.pdf Hermanamientos de la Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires], official site of Buenos Aires.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abhorrers''', the name given in 1679 to the persons who expressed their abhorrence at the action of those who had signed petitions urging King [[Charles II of England]] to assemble [[English Parliament|Parliament]].

Feeling against [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]s, and especially against [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], was running strongly; the [[Exclusion Bill]] had been passed by the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]], and the popularity of [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth]], was very great.

To prevent this bill from passing into law, Charles had dissolved parliament in July 1679, and in the following October had [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogue]]d its successor, which became known as the [[Exclusion Bill Parliament]], without allowing it to meet.  He was then deluged with petitions urging him to call it together, and this agitation was opposed by Sir [[George Jeffreys]] and [[Francis Wythens]], who presented addresses expressing ''abhorrence'' of the ''Petitioners,'' and thus initiated the movement of the abhorrers, who supported the action of the king. &quot;The frolic went all over [[England]],&quot; says [[Roger North (17th century)|Roger North]]; and the addresses of the Abhorrers which reached the king from all parts of the country formed a counterblast to those of the [[Petitioner]]s.  It is said that the terms [[British Whig Party|Whig]] and [[British Tory Party|Tory]] were first applied to English political parties in consequence of this dispute.

'''Abiathar ''' (אביתר, Ebyathar, Evyatar, ''the [divine] father is pre-eminent'' or ''father of plenty''), in the [[Hebrew Bible]], son of [[Achimelech]] or Ahijah, [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] at [[Nob, Israel|Nob]], the fourth in descent from [[Eli (Bible)|Eli]] (1 Sam. 33:6) and the last of Eli's House. The only one of the priests to escape from Saul's massacre, he fled to David at [[Keilah]], taking with him the [[ephod]] and other priestly regalies (1 Sam. 22:20 f., 23:6, 9). He was of great service to David, especially at the time of the rebellion of [[Absalom]] (2 Sam. 15:24, 29, 35, 20:25). In 1 Kings 4:4 [[Zadok (High Priest)|Zadok]] and Abiathar are found acting together as priests under Solomon. In 1 Kings 1:7, 19, 25, however, Abiathar appears as a supporter of Adonijah, and in 2:22 and 26 it is said that he was deposed by Solomon and banished to Anathoth.  In 2 Sam. 8:17 ''Abiathar, the son of Achimelech'' should be read, with the Syriac, for ''Achimelech, the son of Abiathar.'' A similar confusion occurs in [[Gospel of Mark]] 2:26:&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 1911&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; In reporting Jesus' words, [[Mark the Evangelist|the evangelist]] confused Abiathar with [[Ahimelech]], a mistake into which he was led by the constant association of David‘s name with Abiathar.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Suggestions made to resolve the difficulty—e.g. that father and son each bore the same double name, or that Abiathar officiated during his father's lifetime and in his father's stead—have been supported by great names, but have not been fully accepted.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;&quot;Abiathar&quot;, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

When his father was slain with the priests of Nob, he escaped, and bearing with him the [[ephod]], he joined David, who was then in the cave of [[Adullam]] (1 Sam. 22:20-23; 23:6). He remained with David, and became priest of the party of which he was the leader (1 Sam. 30:7). [[Ahimelech]] great-grandson of Eli; slain by [[Doeg the Edomite]]-fulfilling part of the curse on the House of Eli that none of his male descendants would live to old age. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia on David descendant [[Jehoash of Judah]]: In Rabbinical Literature: As the extermination of the male descendants of David was a divine retribution for the extermination of the priests because of David (comp. I Sam. 22:17-21), Joash escaped death because in the latter case one priest, Abiathar, survived (Sanh. 95b)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view_page.jsp?artid=265&amp;letter=A&amp;pid=0 Jewish Encyclopedia p.56]&lt;/ref&gt;

When David ascended the throne of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], Abiathar was appointed High Priest (1 Chr. 15:11; 1 Kings 2:26) and the &quot;king's counselor&quot; (1 Chr. 27:33-34). Meanwhile Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made High Priest. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia Abiathar was deposed from office when he was deserted by the Holy Spirit without which the [[Urim]] and Thummin could not be consulted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view_page.jsp?artid=265&amp;letter=A&amp;pid=0 ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' p.56]&lt;/ref&gt; Another version says he was Co-Pontiff with Zadok during King David. He supported Prince Adonijah over Prince [[Solomon]], and was deposed by him and exiled in [[Anathoth]].

These appointments continued in force till the end of David's reign (1 Kings 4:4). Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by [[Solomon]], because he took part in the attempt to raise [[Adonijah]] to the throne. The priesthood thus passed from the house of Ithamar (1 Sam. 2:30-36; 1 Kings 1:19; 2:26, 27). Zadok now became sole high priest. Abiathar's removal from the Priesthood fulfilled that other part of the curse on the House of Eli—that the Priesthood would pass out of the House of Eli.

'''Abigail''' ({{Hebrew Name 2|אֲבִיגַיִל|אֲבִיגָיִל|Avigáyil||ʾĂḇîḡáyil|ʾĂḇîḡāyil|&quot;her Father's joy&quot; or &quot;fountain of joy&quot;}}, spelt ''Abigal'' in {{Bibleref2|2Samuel|3:3|NIV|2 Samuel 3:3}}) was the wife of  [[Nabal]]; she became a wife of [[David (biblical king)|David]] after Nabal's death ([[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] {{Bibleref2-nb|1SAM|25|NIV}}).

In the passage, [[Nabal]] demonstrates ingratitude towards [[David]], and Abigail attempts to placate David in order to stop him taking revenge. She gives him food, and speaks to him, urging him not to &quot;have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed&quot; (verse 31, [[NIV]]) and reminding him that [[God of Israel|God]] will make him a &quot;[[Davidic line|lasting dynasty]]&quot; (verse 28). [[Jon Levenson]] calls this an &quot;undeniable [[wikt:adumbration|adumbration]]&quot; of [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan]]'s prophecy in [[Covenant (biblical)#Davidic covenant|2 Samuel 7]].&lt;ref name=Levenson&gt;[[Jon D. Levenson]], &quot;1 Samuel 25 as Literature and History,&quot; ''[[Catholic Biblical Quarterly|CBQ]]'' 40 [1978] 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Alice Bach notes that Abigail pronounces a &quot;crucial prophecy,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Bach, &quot;[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=1945&amp;C=1780 The Pleasure of Her Text],&quot; ''Union Seminary Quarterly Review'' 43 [1989] 44.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Talmud]] regards her as one of the [[Tanakh]]'s seven female prophets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] [http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Megilah.pdf 14a]&lt;/ref&gt; Levenson, however, suggests that she &quot;senses the drift of history&quot; from intelligence rather than from special revelation.&lt;ref name=Levenson /&gt;

In verse 38, it says that &quot;[[YHWH]] struck Nabal and he died,&quot; and David subsequently married Abigail.
[[File:Escalante-abigail.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Prudent Abigail'' by [[Juan Antonio de Frías y Escalante|Juan Antonio Escalante]].]]
The text explicitly describes Abigail as &quot;intelligent and beautiful&quot; (1 Samuel 25:3, [[NIV]]). Indeed, the [[Talmud]] mentions her as being one of the &quot;four women of surpassing beauty in the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] [http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Megilah.pdf 15a]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Kuyper]] argues, moreover, that Abigail's conduct indicates &quot;a most appealing character and unwavering faith.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Kuyper]], ''Women of the Old Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1941), 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Alice Bach regards her as subversive,&lt;ref&gt;Alice Bach, &quot;[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=1945&amp;C=1780 The Pleasure of Her Text],&quot; ''Union Seminary Quarterly Review'' 43 [1989] 41.&lt;/ref&gt; while Sandra Williams suggests that Abigail is deceptive and disloyal to her husband and even that she was &quot;sexually turned on by an outlaw and a criminal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sandra S. Williams, [http://www.sandrawilliams.org/David/david.html David and Abigail: A Non-Traditional View]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abigail was the mother of [[Daniel (son of David)|one of David's sons]], who is named in the [[Book of Chronicles]] as ''Daniel,''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|3:1|}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Masoretic Text]] of the Books of Samuel as ''Chileab,''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:3|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Septuagint]] text of 2 Samuel 3:3 as Δαλουια, ''Dalouia''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/sep/sa2003.htm 2 Samuel 3], LXX&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon D. Levenson|Levenson]] and [[Halpern]] suggest that Abigail may, in fact, be the same person as [[Abigail (mother of Amasa)|Abigail, mother of Amasa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon D. Levenson]] and [[Baruch Halpern]], &quot;The Political Import of David's Marriages,&quot; ''[[Journal of Biblical Literature|JBL]]'' 99 [1980] 511-512.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generic use==
Abigail's self-styling as a ''[[handmaid]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|25:25|}} and following&lt;/ref&gt; led to ''Abigail'' being the traditional term for a waiting-woman, for example as the ''waiting [[gentlewoman]]'' in [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]'s ''[[The Scornful Lady]]'', published in 1616. [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Henry Fielding]] use ''Abigail'' in this generic sense, as does [[Charlotte Brontë]]. [[Anthony Trollope]] makes two references to ''the abigail'' (all lower case) in ''[[The Eustace Diamonds]]'', at the beginning of Chapter 42. [[William Rose Benet]] notes the notoriety of [[Abigail Hill]], better known as &quot;Mrs Masham&quot;, a [[lady-in-waiting]] to [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Reader's Encyclopedia'', 1948, ''s.v.'' &quot;Abigail&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Azad Jammu and Kashmir''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|آزاد جموں و کشمیر}}}} ''azaad jammu o- kashmir'' ; '''AJK''') or '''Azad Kashmir''' for short (literally, &quot;Free Kashmir&quot;), is the southernmost political entity within the Pakistani-administered part of the former [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|princely state]] of Jammu and Kashmir. It borders the present-day Indian-controlled state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] to the east (separated from it by the [[Line of Control]]), [[Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]] to the west, [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] to the north, and the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab Province]] of Pakistan to the south. With its capital at [[Muzaffarabad]], Azad Kashmir covers an area of {{convert|13297|km2|sqmi}} and has an estimated population of about four million. Azad Kashmir and [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] both constitute an area known as [[Pakistan-administered Kashmir]] which is referred to in India as Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

==History==
[[File:Kashmir region 2004.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the entire Kashmir region]]
After the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, the princely states were given the option of joining either India or Pakistan. However, [[Hari Singh]], the [[maharaja]] of Jammu and Kashmir, wanted Jammu and Kashmir to remain independent. In order to buy some time, he signed a stand-still agreement, which sidestepped the agreement that each princely state would join either India or Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatogether.org/peace/kashmir/intro.htm |title=The J&amp;K conflict: A Chronological Introduction |publisher=India Together |date= |accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later there was a revolution by Muslims in the western part of the kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312908/Kashmir |title=Kashmir (region, Indian subcontinent) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the raiders from North-West Frontier Province and the Tribal Areas feared that Hari Singh might join the Indian Union. In October 1947, supported by the Pakistani Army, they attacked Kashmir and tried to take over control of Kashmir. Initially Hari Singh tried to resist their progress but failed. Hari Singh then requested the Indian Union to help. India responded that it could not help unless Kashmir joined India. So on 26 October 1947, Kashmir accession papers were signed and Indian troops were airlifted to Srinagar. Fighting ensued between the Indian Army and Pakistani Army, with control stabilizing more or less around what is now the &quot;Line of Control&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.southasianmedia.net/magazine/journal/grasping_nettle.htm|title=Grasping the Nettle|author=Prem Shankar Jha|work=South Asian Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, India approached the United Nations to solve the dispute and resolutions were passed to hold a plebiscite with regard to Kashmir's future. However, this plebiscite has not been held on either side, since the legal requirement for the holding of a plebiscite was the withdrawal of the Indian and Pakistani armies from the parts of Kashmir that were under their respective control—a withdrawal that never did take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.indianembassy.org/policy/Kashmir/uncip(s1100).htm|title= UNCIP Resolution of August 13, 1948 (S/1100) - Embassy of India, Washington, DC}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, a cease-fire line separating the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir was formally put into effect.

Following the 1949 cease-fire agreement, the government of Pakistan divided the northern and western parts of Kashmir which it held into the following two separately-controlled political entities:
# Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) - the narrow southern part, {{convert|250|mi|km|abbr=off|lk=off}} long, with a width varying from {{convert|10|to|40|mi|km|abbr=off}}.
# [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] formerly called [[Federally Administered Northern Areas]] (FANA) - is the much larger area to the north of AJK, {{convert|72496|km2|sqmi}}; it was directly administered by Pakistan as a ''de facto'' dependent territory, i.e., a non-self-governing territory. However it was officially granted full autonomy on August 29, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller |first=David |url=http://www.daily.pk/pakistan-grants-full-autonomy-to-northern-areas-9753/ |title=Pakistan grants full autonomy to northern areas &amp;#124; Pakistan Daily |publisher=Daily.pk |date=2009-08-30 |accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An area of Kashmir that was once under Pakistani control is the [[Trans-Karakoram Tract|Shaksgam tract]]—a small region along the northeastern border of the Northern Areas that was provisionally ceded by Pakistan to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1963 and which now forms part of China's Uygur Autonomous Region of [[Xinjiang]].

In 1972, the then-current border between Pakistan and India, which held areas of Kashmir, was designated as the &quot;Line of Control&quot;. The Line of Control has remained unchanged&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/missions/unmogip/|title= UNMOGIP: United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the 1972 [[Simla Agreement]], which bound the two countries &quot;to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations.&quot; Some political experts claim that, in view of that pact, the only solution to the issue is mutual negotiation between the two countries without involving a third party, such as the United Nations.

===Azad Kashmir Day===
Azad Kashmir Day celebrates the 61st day of the Azad Jammu Kashmir government, created on 24 October 1947.

==Government==
[[File:Muzaffarabad Azad Kashmir.svg|thumb|150px|Districts of Azad Kashmir]]
Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) is a self-governing state under Pakistani control but is not constitutionally part of Pakistan.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;&lt;ref name=ajk144/&gt; It has its own elected president, prime minister, legislature, high court, and official flag. The government of Pakistan has not yet allowed the state to issue its own postage stamps, however, and Pakistani stamps are used in the state instead.
Azad Kashmir has it own Judiciary as well with Khawaja Shahad Ahmad as its present Chief Justice.

Azad Kashmir's financial matters, i.e., budget and tax affairs, are dealt with by the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council, rather than by Pakistan's Central Board of Revenue. The Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council is a supreme body consisting of 11 members, six from the government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and five from the government of Pakistan. Its chairman/chief executive is the president of Pakistan. Other members of the council are the president and the prime minister of Azad Kashmir and a few other AJK ministers.&lt;ref name=brit&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/46696/Azad-Kashmir# Azad Kashmir]&quot; at britannica.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ajk144&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajk.gov.pk/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2257&amp;Itemid=144|title=Azad Jammu and Kashmir - Introduction|accessdate=22 June 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927000235/http://www.ajk.gov.pk/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2257&amp;Itemid=144|archivedate=Sep 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 report by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] determined that Pakistan-administered Kashmir was 'not free', while [[Indian Kashmir]] was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,469f2dcf2,487ca21a2a,0.html|title= Freedom in the World 2008 - Kashmir (Pakistan)|publisher= [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]|date= 2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; And a 2010 report by [[Freedom House]] confirmed that Pakistan-administered Kashmir was 'not free', while [[Indian Kashmir]] was 'partially free'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=363&amp;year=2010|title= Freedom in the World 2010|publisher= [[Freedom House]]|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are roughly 1.5 million refugees from [[Indian Administered Kashmir]] in Azad Kashmir and [[Pakistan]].

==Geography and climate==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}

The northern part of Azad Jammu and Kashmir encompasses the lower area of the [[Himalayas]], including Jamgarh Peak (15,531 feet [4,734 meters]). However, [[Hari Parbat]] peak in [[Neelum Valley]] is the highest peak in the state. Fertile, green, mountainous valleys are characteristic of Azad Kashmir's geography, making it one of the most beautiful regions of the subcontinent.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;
The region receives rainfall in both the winter and the summer. [[Muzaffarabad]] and Pattan are among the wettest areas of Pakistan. Throughout most of the region, the average rainfall exceeds 1400&amp;nbsp;mm, with the highest average rainfall occurring near Muzaffarabad (around 1800&amp;nbsp;mm). During the summer season, monsoon floods of the rivers [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]] and [[Leepa River|Leepa]] are common due to extreme rains and snow melting.

==Ethnic groups==
{{Main|Ethnic groups of Azad Kashmir}}

Azad Jammu and Kashmir is predominantly [[Muslim]]. The majority of the population is culturally, linguistically, and ethnically related to the people of northern Punjab. The article [[Ethnic groups of Azad Kashmir]] gives a breakdown of all the major tribes in the state. The principal languages spoken are [[Pahari languages|Pahari]], [[Gojri]], [[Dogri]], [[Potohari]], [[Urdu]], [[Kashmiri]], [[Pashto]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].

A large number of residents of this area have relatives who live in [[England]]. Mirpur in particular retains strong links with the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moss |first=Paul |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6178092.stm |title=South Asia &amp;#124; The limits to integration |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-11-30 |accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
[[Urdu]] is the official language of Azad Jammu and Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://pakistantimes.net/2005/08/21/kashmir1.htm|title= Urdu declared official language of Azad Kashmir.|publisher= Pakistan Times|date= 21 August 2005|accessdate= 31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the area's diverse cultural blend, many languages are spoken by different populations, including [[Potwari language|Pahari-Potwari]], [[Hindko language|Hindko]], [[Gojri]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pmajk.gov.pk/history.asp|title= About Kashmir.|publisher= Prime Minister of AJ&amp;K|accessdate= January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manzoor Ali Shah. &quot;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010\02\22\story_22-2-2010_pg7_32 26 languages spoken in NWFP, northern areas: Many face threat of extinction.]&quot; ''Daily Times''.

In the mid-1950s various economic and social development processes were launched in Azad Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pndajk.gov.pk/history.asp|title= History of Planning &amp; Development Department in AJK}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, with the construction of the [[Mangla Dam]] in [[Mirpur District]], the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Government began to receive royalties from the Pakistani government for electricity the dam provided to the nation. During the mid-2000s a multi-billion dollar reconstruction began in the aftermath of the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/2006/10/01/nat9.htm|title=‘Rs1.25 trillion to be spent in Azad Kashmir’: Reconstruction in quake-hit zone|last=Naqash|first=Tariq|date=October 1, 2006|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|location=Muzaffarabad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture is a part of Azad Kashmir's economy; low-lying areas that have high populations grow crops like [[barley]], [[mango]]es, [[millet]], [[maize|corn]] (maize), and [[wheat]], and also raise cattle. In the more elevated areas that are less populated and are spread out, forestry, corn and livestock are the source of living.

There are some [[mineral]] and marble resources in Azad Kashmir close to [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]] and [[Muzaffarabad]]; there are also some graphite deposits at Mohriwali. There are some reservoirs of low-grade coal, [[chalk]], [[bauxite]], and [[zircon]]. Local household industries produce carved wooden objects, [[textiles]], and dhurrie carpets.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; There is also an art and craft industry that produces such cultural goods as: namdas, shawls, pashmina, pherans, papier mache, basketry copper, rugs, wood carving, silk and woolen clothing, patto, carpet, namda gubba and silverware. Agricultural goods produced in the region include: mushrooms, honey, walnuts, apples, cherries, medicinal herbs and plants, resin, deodar, kail, chir, fir, maple and ash timber.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;&lt;ref name=ajk144/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajk.gov.pk/tourism/administrative.html|title=Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir - Tourism|accessdate=22 June 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080529093455/http://www.ajk.gov.pk/tourism/administrative.html|archivedate=May 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to agriculture, textiles, arts and crafts, remittances have played a major role in the economy of Azad Kashmir. One analyst estimated that the figure for Azad Kashmir was 25.1% in 2001; for household annual income, those people living in higher areas are more dependent on remittance than lower areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdpi.org/whats_new/recent_publications/BGPaper_Remittances_Pakistan.pdf |title=Remittances in crises: a case study from Pakistan |author=Abid Qaiyum Suleri|coauthors=Kevin Savage|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter part of 2006, billions of dollars for development were mooted by [[international aid agencies]] for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of earthquake-hit zones in Azad Kashmir, though much of that amount was subsequently lost in bureaucratic channels, leading to delay in help reaching the most needy, and hundreds of people continued to live in tents long after the earthquake.&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn.com&quot;/&gt; A land-use plan for the city of [[Muzaffarabad]] was prepared by the [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]].

Remittance by [[British Pakistanis]] forms an important part of the Kashmiri economy.

==Education==

The literacy rate in Azad Kashmir was 62% in 2004, higher than in any other region in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pakistantimes.net/2004/09/27/kashmir5.htm|title='Literacy Rate in Azad Kashmir nearly 62 pc'|date=2004-09-27|work=[[Pakistan Times]]|location=MUZAFFARABAD (Azad Kashmir)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only 2.2% were graduates, compared to the average of 2.9% for the whole of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_17-4-2005_pg7_37|title=Washington conference studies educational crisis in Pakistan|last=Hasan|first=Khalid|date=April 17, 2005|work=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]|location=Washington|quote=Grace Clark told the conference that only 2.9 percent of Pakistanis had access to higher education.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arabian Sea''' ({{lang-ar|بحر العرب}} {{transl|ar|''Baḥr al 'Arab''}}, {{lang-tcy|ಅರಬ್ಬೀ ಸಮುದ್ರ}} ''Arabi Samudra'', {{lang-mr|अरबी समुद्र}} ''Arabi Samudra'', {{lang-ml|അറബിക്കടല്‍}} {{transl|ml|''Aṟabikkadal''}}, Persian {{transl|fa|''Darya-ye 'Arab''}}) is a region of the [[Indian Ocean]] bounded on the east by [[India]], on the north by [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]], on the west by the [[Arabian Peninsula]], on the south, approximately, by a line between [[Cape Guardafui]] in northeastern [[Somalia]] and [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]] in [[India]]. Some of the ancient names of this body of water include ''Sindhu Sagar'' (meaning &quot;Sea of Sindh&quot; in Sanskrit)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamat.com/indica/geography/arabian_sea.htm Geographica Indica - The Arabian Sea]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Erythraean Sea]].

==Description==
The Arabian Sea's surface area is about {{convert|3862000|km2|sqmi|-1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/31653/Arabian-Sea Arabian Sea], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum width of the Arabian Sea is approximately {{convert|2400|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}}, and its maximum depth is {{convert|4652|m|ft|0}}, in the Arabian Basin approximately at the same latitude as the southernmost tip of [[India]]. The largest river flowing into the Arabian Sea is the [[Indus River]]; others include the [[Netravathi]], [[Sharavathi]], [[Narmada River|Narmada]], [[Tapti River|Tapti]], [[Mahi River|Mahi]], and the numerous [[List of rivers in Kerala|rivers of Kerala]]. The Arabian Sea coast of central India is known as the [[Konkan Coast]], and that of southern India is known as the [[Malabar Coast]].

[[File:India Landscape.jpg|thumb|left|[[Colva|Colva Beach]], [[Goa]]]]
The Arabian Sea has two important branches — the [[Gulf of Aden]] in the southwest, connecting with the [[Red Sea]] through the strait of [[Bab-el-Mandeb]]; and the [[Gulf of Oman]] to the northwest, connecting with the [[Persian Gulf]]. There are also the gulfs of [[Gulf of Cambay|Cambay]] and [[Gulf of Kutch|Kutch]] on the Indian coast. The largest islands in the Arabian Sea are [[Socotra]] (off the [[Horn of Africa]]) and [[Masirah]] (off the Omani coast) as well as the [[Lakshadweep]] archipelago off the Indian coast.

The countries with coastlines on the Arabian Sea are [[Somalia]], [[Djibouti]], [[Yemen]], [[Oman]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and the [[Maldives]]. There are several large cities on the Arabian Sea coast including [[Aden]], [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Karachi]], [[Surat]], [[Mumbai]], [[Mangalore]], [[Kozhikode]], [[Kochi, India|Kochi]] and [[Thiruvananthapuram]].

===Limits===
[[File:Arabian-sea-Kannur-Fort-1.JPG|thumb|Arabian Sea as seen from [[Kannur Fort]], [[Kannur]], [[Kerala]]]]
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Arabian Sea as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S23_1953.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''On the West.'' The Eastern limit of the [[Gulf of Aden]] [The meridian of [[Cape Guardafui]] (Ras Asir, 51°16'E)].
&lt;p&gt;''On the North.'' A line joining [[Ras al Hadd|Ràs al Hadd]], East point of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] (22°32'N) and [[Jiwani|Ràs Jiyùni]] (61°43'E) on the coast of [[Pakistan]].
&lt;p&gt;''On the South.'' A line running from the South extremity of [[Addu Atoll]] ([[Maldives]]), to the Eastern extreme of [[Hafun|Ràs Hafun]] (Africa, 10°26'N).
&lt;p&gt;''On the East.'' The Western limit of the [[Laccadive Sea]] [A line running from [[Sadashivgad|Sadashivgad Lt.]] on West Coast of [[India]] ({{coord|14|48|N|74|07|E|display=inline}}) to [[Cora Divh|Corah Divh]] ({{coord|13|42|N|72|10|E|display=inline}}) and thence down the West side of the [[Lakshadweep|Laccadive]] and [[Maldives|Maldive]] Archipelagos to the most Southerly point of [[Addu Atoll]] in the Maldives].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Trade routes==
It is known as the ''Sindhu Sagar'' to Indians since the [[Vedic period]] of their history, and an important [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[trade route]] in the era of the ''coastal sailing vessels'' from possibly as early as the [[3rd millennium BCE]], certainly the late [[2nd millennium BCE]] through the later days known as the [[Age of Sail]]. By the time of [[Julius Caesar]], several well-established combined land-sea trade routes depended upon [[water transport]] through the Sea around the rough inland [[terrain feature]]s to its north. 

[[File:Surathkal beach - arabian sea.jpg|thumb|left|[[Surathkal]] beach, [[Mangalore]] on the shores of Arabian sea]]
These routes usually began in the [[Far East]] or down river from [[Madhya Pradesh]] with [[transshipment]] via historic [[Bharuch]] (Bharakuccha), traversed past the inhospitable coast of today's [[Iran]] then split around [[Hadhramaut]] into two streams north into the [[Gulf of Aden]] and thence into the [[Levant]], or south into [[Alexandria]] via [[Red Sea]] ports such as [[Axum]]. Each major route involved transhipping to pack animal caravan, travel through desert country and risk of bandits and extortionate tolls by local potentiates.

[[File:Karachi beach.jpeg|thumb|[[Karachi]] beach on the Arabian Sea, the historical sea route between Arabia and South Asia]]
This southern coastal route past the rough country in the southern [[Arabian peninsula]] ([[Yemen]] and [[Oman]] today) was significant, and the [[Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]]s built several shallow canals to service the trade, one more or less along the route of today's [[Suez canal]], and another from the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Nile River]], both shallow works that were swallowed up by huge [[sand storm]]s in antiquity. Later the [[kingdom of Axum]] arose in [[Ethiopia]] to rule a mercantile empire rooted in the trade with Europe via Alexandria.

Ocean trade routes have crossed the Arabian Sea since ancient times, linking the [[Near East]] with [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[China]]. Historically, sailors in a type of ship called a [[dhow]] used the seasonal [[monsoon]] winds to cross the water. The sea forms part of the chief shipping route between [[Europe]] and India via the [[Suez Canal]], which links the [[Red Sea]] with the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

'''Aspartame''' ('''APM'''; {{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|æ|s|p|ər|t|eɪ|m}} or {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|s|p|ɑr|t|eɪ|m}}) is an artificial, non-[[saccharide]] [[sweeteners|sweetener]] used as a [[sugar substitute]] in some foods and beverages. In the European Union, it is codified as [[E number|E951]]. Aspartame is a [[methyl]] [[ester]] of the [[aspartic acid]]/[[phenylalanine]] [[dipeptide]].  It was first sold under the brand name [[NutraSweet]]; since 2009 it also has been sold under the brand name AminoSweet. It was first synthesized in 1965 and the patent expired in 1992.

The [[Aspartame controversy|safety of aspartame]] has been the subject of several political and medical controversies, [[Congressional hearing]]s and internet hoaxes since its initial approval for use in food products by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1974.  A 2007 medical review on the subject concluded that &quot;the weight of existing scientific evidence indicates that aspartame is safe at current levels of consumption as a non-nutritive sweetener&quot;.&lt;ref name=CritReview&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Magnuson BA, Burdock GA, Doull J, ''et al.'' |title=Aspartame: a safety evaluation based on current use levels, regulations, and toxicological and epidemiological studies |journal=Critical Reviews in Toxicology |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=629–727 |year=2007 |pmid=17828671 |doi=10.1080/10408440701516184}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because its breakdown products include [[phenylalanine]], aspartame must be avoided by people with the genetic condition [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU).

==Chemistry==
Aspartame is a [[methyl]] [[ester]] of the [[dipeptide]] of the natural [[amino acid]]s &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-[[aspartic acid]] and &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-[[phenylalanine]]. Under strongly [[acid]]ic or [[Base (chemistry)|alkaline]] conditions, aspartame may generate [[methanol]] by [[hydrolysis]]. Under more severe conditions, the [[peptide bond]]s are also [[hydrolyzed]], resulting in the free amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;

Two approaches to synthesis are used commercially. In the chemical synthesis, the two carboxyl groups of aspartic acid are joined into an anhydride, and the amino group is protected by a compound that will prevent further reactions of that group. Phenylalanine is methylated and combined with the ''N''-protected aspartic anhydride, then the blocking group is removed from aspartic acid by acid hydrolysis. The drawback of this technique is that a byproduct, the bitter tasting β-form, is produced when the wrong carboxyl group from aspartic acid links to phenylalanine. A process using an [[Thermolysin|enzyme from ''Bacillus thermoproteolyticus'']] to catalyze the condensation of the chemically altered amino acids will produce high yields without the β-form byproduct. A variant of this method, which has not been used commercially, uses unmodified aspartic acid, but produces low yields. Methods for directly producing aspartyl-phenylalanine by enzymatic means, followed by chemical methylation, have also been tried, but not scaled for industrial production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Yagasaki |first= Makoto |coauthors= Hashimoto, Shin-ichi |year= 2008 |month= November |title= Synthesis and application of dipeptides; current status and perspectives |journal= Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology  |volume= 81 |issue= 1 |pages= 13–22 |pmid= 18795289 |doi= 10.1007/s00253-008-1590-3 |accessdate = November 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and use==
Aspartame, an [[artificial sweetener]], is approximately 200 times sweeter than [[sucrose]], or table sugar. Due to this property, even though aspartame produces four kilocalories of energy per [[gram]] when metabolized, the quantity of aspartame needed to produce a sweet taste is so small that its caloric contribution is negligible.&lt;ref name=CritReview/&gt;  The taste of aspartame and other artificial sweeteners differs from that of table sugar in the times of onset and how long the sweetness lasts, though aspartame comes closest amongst artificial sweeteners to sugar's taste profile.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The sweetness of aspartame lasts longer than sucrose, so it is often blended with other artificial sweeteners such as [[acesulfame potassium]] to produce an overall taste more like sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodproductdesign.com/articles/2007/05/new-products-weigh-in.aspx |title=New Products Weigh In |publisher=www.foodproductdesign.com |accessdate=2010-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspartame can be synthesized from its constituent amino acids, &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-[[phenylalanine]] and &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-[[aspartate]].

Like many other [[peptide]]s, aspartame may [[hydrolyze]] (break down) into its constituent amino acids under conditions of elevated temperature or high [[pH]]. This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener, and prone to degradation in products hosting a high pH, as required for a long shelf life. The stability of aspartame under heating can be improved to some extent by encasing it in [[fat]]s or in [[maltodextrin]]. The stability when dissolved in [[water]] depends markedly on [[pH]]. At room temperature, it is most stable at pH 4.3, where its [[half-life]] is nearly 300 days. At pH 7, however, its [[half-life]] is only a few days. Most soft-drinks have a pH between 3 and 5, where aspartame is reasonably stable. In products that may require a longer shelf life, such as [[syrups]] for [[soda fountain|fountain beverages]], aspartame is sometimes blended with a more stable sweetener, such as [[saccharin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/mail/goodanswer/us_fountain_beverages.pdf | publisher = [[The Coca-Cola Company]] | title = Fountain Beverages in the US |month=May | year=2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspartame's major decomposition products are its cyclic dipeptide ([[diketopiperazine]] form), the de-esterified dipeptide (aspartyl-phenylalanine), and its constituent components, [[phenylalanine]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Prodolliet-&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Prodolliet | first1 = J. | last2 = Bruelhart | first2 = M. | title = Determination of aspartame and its major decomposition products in foods | journal = J AOAC Int | volume = 76 | issue = 2 | pages = 275–82 | month =  | year =  1993| doi =  | pmid = 8471853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; aspartic acid,&lt;ref name=stegink1987&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Stegink |first= Lewis D. |year= 1987 |month= July |title= The aspartame story: a model for the clinical testing of a food additive |journal= American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume= 46 |issue= 1 |pages= 204–215 |pmid= 3300262 |url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/46/1/204}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[methanol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lin-2000&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Lin | first1 = SY. | last2 = Cheng | first2 = YD. | title = Simultaneous formation and detection of the reaction product of solid-state aspartame sweetener by FT-IR/DSC microscopic system | journal = Food Addit Contam | volume = 17 | issue = 10 | pages = 821–7 | month = Oct | year = 2000 | doi =  10.1080/026520300420385| pmid = 11103265 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 180°[[Celsius|C]], aspartame undergoes decomposition to form a diketopiperazine (DKP) derivative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rastogi-2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Rastogi | first1 = S. | last2 = Zakrzewski | first2 = M. | last3 = Suryanarayanan | first3 = R. | title = Investigation of solid-state reactions using variable temperature X-ray powder diffractrometry.

In products such as [[Powder (substance)|powdered]] beverages, the [[amine]] in aspartame can undergo a [[Maillard reaction]] with the [[aldehyde]] groups present in certain [[aroma compound]]s. The ensuing loss of both flavor and sweetness can be prevented by protecting the aldehyde as an [[acetal]].

==Discovery and approval==
Aspartame was discovered in 1965 by James M. Schlatter, a chemist working for [[Searle (company)|G.D. Searle &amp; Company]]. Schlatter had [[Chemical synthesis|synthesized]] aspartame in the course of producing an anti[[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]] drug candidate. He accidentally discovered its sweet taste when he licked his finger, which had become contaminated with aspartame, to lift up a piece of paper.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-632-04452-7&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Lewis, Ricki |title=Discovery: windows on the life sciences |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=2001 |pages=4 |isbn=0-632-04452-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Magnuson-2007&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Magnuson BA, Burdock GA, Doull J |title=Aspartame: a safety evaluation based on current use levels, regulations, and toxicological and epidemiological studies |journal=Crit.

In 1975, prompted by issues regarding [[Flagyl]] and [[Aldactone]], a U.S. FDA task force team reviewed 25 studies submitted by the manufacturer, including 11 on aspartame. The team reported “serious deficiencies in Searle’s operations and practices&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gao-87&quot; /&gt; The FDA sought to authenticate 15 of the submitted studies against the supporting data. In 1979, the [[Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition]] (CFSAN) concluded, since many problems with the aspartame studies were minor and did not affect the conclusions, the studies could be used to assess aspartame's safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;gao-87&quot; /&gt;

In 1980, the FDA convened a Public Board of Inquiry (PBOI) consisting of independent advisors charged with examining the purported relationship between aspartame and [[brain cancer]]. The PBOI concluded aspartame does not cause [[Human brain|brain]] damage, but it recommended against approving aspartame at that time, citing unanswered questions about [[cancer]] in laboratory rats.&lt;ref name=&quot;gao-87&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=U.S. GAO - HRD-87-46 Food and Drug Administration: Food Additive Approval Process '''Followed for Aspartame, June 18, 1987 |accessdate = 2008-09-05 | url = http://www.gao.gov/docdblite/info.php?rptno=HRD-87-46 |pages = 94–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Dr. Adrian Gross, Former FDA Investigator to the U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, November 3, 1987.

In 1996, the FDA removed all restrictions from aspartame, allowing it to be used in all foods.

Several European Union countries approved aspartame in the 1980s, with EU-wide approval in 1994. The European Commission [[Scientific Committee on Food]] reviewed subsequent safety studies and reaffirmed the approval in 2002. The [[European Food Safety Authority]] reported in 2006 that the previously established [[Acceptable Daily Intake]] was appropriate, after reviewing yet another set of studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/efsa_locale-1178620753812_1178620765743.htm EFSA ::.

==Metabolism and phenylketonuria==
Upon ingestion, aspartame breaks down into natural residual components, including [[aspartic acid]], [[phenylalanine]], [[methanol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Roberts HJ |title=Aspartame disease: a possible cause for concomitant Graves' disease and pulmonary hypertension |journal=Texas Heart Institute Journal |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=105; author reply 105–6 |year=2004 |pmid=15061638 |pmc=387446}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further breakdown products including [[formaldehyde]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Trocho C, Pardo R, Rafecas I, ''et al.'' |title=Formaldehyde derived from dietary aspartame binds to tissue components in vivo |journal=Life Sciences |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=337–49 |year=1998 |pmid=9714421 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3205(98)00282-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[formic acid]], accumulation of the latter being suspected as the major cause of injury in methanol poisoning. Human studies show that formic acid is excreted faster than it is formed after ingestion of aspartate. In some fruit juices, higher concentrations of methanol can be found  than the amount produced from aspartame in beverages.&lt;ref name=stegink1987 /&gt;

High levels of the naturally-occurring [[essential amino acid]] [[phenylalanine]] are a health hazard to those born with [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU), a rare inherited disease that prevents phenylalanine from being properly metabolized. Since individuals with PKU must consider aspartame as an additional source of phenylalanine, foods containing aspartame sold in the [[United States]] must state &quot;Phenylketonurics: Contains Phenylalanine&quot; on their product labels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=172.804 Code of Federal Regulations Title 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], foods that contain aspartame are legally required by the country's [[Food Standards Agency]] to list the chemical among the product's ingredients and carry the warning &quot;Contains a source of phenylalanine&quot; &amp;ndash; this is usually at the foot of the list of ingredients. Manufacturers are also required to print '&quot;with sweetener(s)&quot; on the label close to the main product name' on foods that contain &quot;sweeteners such as aspartame&quot; or &quot;with sugar and sweetener(s)&quot; on &quot;foods that contain both sugar and sweetener&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/sweeteners/55174#h_5/  ''Aspartame - Labelling'', UK Food Standards Agency, 18 July 2006]. Retrieved on 2007-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
[[Equal (sweetener)|Equal]], [[NutraSweet]], and [[Canderel]] are ingredients of approximately 6,000 consumer foods and beverages sold worldwide, including (but not limited to) diet sodas and other soft drinks, instant breakfasts, breath mints, cereals, sugar-free chewing gum, cocoa mixes, frozen desserts, gelatin desserts, juices, laxatives, chewable vitamins supplements, milk drinks, pharmaceutical drugs and supplements, shake mixes, tabletop sweeteners, teas, instant coffees, topping mixes, wine coolers and yogurt.  It is provided as a table [[condiment]] in some countries. Aspartame is less suitable for [[baking]] than other sweeteners, because it [[chemical decomposition|breaks down]] when heated and loses much of its sweetness. Aspartame is also one of the main sugar substitutes used by people with [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].

===NutraSweet Company===
In 1984, [[Monsanto Company]] bought G.D. Searle, and the aspartame business became a separate Monsanto subsidiary, the [[NutraSweet|NutraSweet Company]]. On May 25, 2000, Monsanto sold it to [[J.W. Childs]] Equity Partners II L.P.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EUY/is_22_6/ai_62920821&quot;&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EUY/is_22_6/ai_62920821 J.W.

Since then, the company has competed for market share with other manufacturers, including [[Ajinomoto]], [[Merisant]] and the Holland Sweetener Company. They last stopped making the chemical in late 2006, because &quot;global aspartame markets are facing structural oversupply, which has caused worldwide strong price erosion over the last five years&quot;, making the business &quot;persistently unprofitable&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release_html_b1?release_id=115447&quot;&gt;[http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release html b1?release id=115447]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ajinomoto===
In 2004, the market for aspartame, in which [[Ajinomoto]], the world's largest aspartame manufacturer, had a 40 percent share, was 14,000 metric tons a year, and consumption of the product was rising by 2 percent a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a1rBnsdDJnM8&amp;refer=japan |title=Ajinomoto May Exceed Full-Year Forecasts on Amino Acid Products - Bloomberg |publisher=www.bloomberg.com |accessdate=2010-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ajinomoto acquired its aspartame business in 2000 from [[Monsanto]] for $67M.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2000/06/05/114953/sweetener-sale.html |title=Sweetener sale-05/06/2000-ECN |publisher=www.icis.com |accessdate=2010-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Ajinomoto sued British supermarket chain [[Asda]], part of [[Wal-Mart]], for a malicious falsehood action concerning its aspartame product when the chemical was listed as excluded from the chain's product line, along with other &quot;nasties&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;asda&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=441128&amp;in_page_id=2 |title=Asda gears up for additives battle/ aspartame |publisher=www.thisismoney.co.uk |accessdate=2010-06-23|unused_data=This is Money }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, a British court found in favour of Asda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodanddrinkeurope.com/Products-Marketing/Asda-claims-victory-in-aspartame-nasty-case |title=Asda claims victory in aspartame ‘nasty’ case |publisher=www.foodanddrinkeurope.com |accessdate=2010-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, an appeals court reversed the decision, allowing Ajinomoto to pursue a case against Asda to protect aspartame's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodbev.com/news/court-of-appeal-rules-in-ajinomotoasda-aspartame-case |title=FoodBev.com |publisher=www.foodbev.com |accessdate=2010-06-23|unused_data=Court of Appeal rules in Ajinomoto/Asda aspartame case }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asda said that it would continue to use the term &quot;no nasties&quot; on its own-label products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/Legislation/Radical-new-twist-in-Ajinomoto-vs-Asda-nasty-battle |title=Radical new twist in Ajinomoto vs Asda 'nasty' battle |publisher=www.foodnavigator.com |accessdate=2010-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:File-AutoCAD Interface classic.png|thumb|250px|right|AutoCAD 2011 with the Classic User Interface]]
'''AutoCAD''' is a [[computer-aided design|CAD]] (Computer Aided Design or Computer Aided Drafting) [[software application]] for [[2d computer graphics|2D]] and [[3d computer graphics|3D]] [[design]] and [[technical drawing|drafting]]. It is developed and sold by [[Autodesk|Autodesk, Inc.]] First released in December 1982, AutoCAD was one of the first CAD programs to run on [[personal computer]]s, notably the [[IBM PC]]. At that time, most other CAD programs ran on [[mainframe computer]]s or [[minicomputer|mini-computers]] which were connected to a graphics [[computer terminal]] for each user.

Early releases of AutoCAD used primitive entities &amp;mdash; lines, polylines, circles, arcs, and text &amp;mdash; to construct more complex objects. Since the mid-1990s, AutoCAD has supported custom objects through its C++ [[Application Programming Interface]] (API). Modern AutoCAD includes a full set of basic [[solid modeling]] and 3D tools. With the release of AutoCAD 2007 came improved 3D modeling, which meant better navigation when working in 3D. Moreover, it became easier to edit 3D models. The [[mental ray]] [[Software engine|engine]] was included in [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]], it was now possible to do quality renderings. AutoCAD 2010 introduced parametric functionality and mesh modeling.

AutoCAD supports a number of APIs for customization and automation. These include [[AutoLISP]], [[Visual LISP]], [[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]], [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] and [[ObjectARX]]. ObjectARX is a [[C++]] class library, which was also the base for products extending AutoCAD functionality to specific fields, to create products such as AutoCAD Architecture, AutoCAD Electrical, AutoCAD Civil 3D, or third-party AutoCAD-based applications.

AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT are available for [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Chinese Simplified]], [[Chinese Traditional]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Brazilian Portuguese]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. The extent of localization varies from full translation of the product to documentation only. The AutoCAD command set is localized as a part of the software localization.

==AutoCAD origin==
AutoCAD was derived from a program called Interact, which was written in a proprietary language (SPL) and ran on the Marinchip Systems 9900 computer (Marinchip was owned by Autodesk co-founders [[John Walker (programmer)|John Walker]] and Dan Drake.)

When Marinchip Software Partners (later to be renamed Autodesk) was formed, they decided to re-code Interact in C and [[PL/1]] -- C, because it seemed to be the biggest upcoming language. In the end, the PL/1 version was unsuccessful. The C version was, at the time, one of the most complex programs in that language to date. Autodesk even had to work with the compiler developer (Lattice) to fix certain limitations to get AutoCAD to run.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/&lt;/ref&gt;

== AutoCAD LT ==
AutoCAD LT is a lower cost version of AutoCAD with reduced capabilities first released in November 1993. AutoCAD LT, priced at $495, became the first product in the company's history priced below $1000 to bear the name &quot;AutoCAD&quot;. In addition to being sold directly by Autodesk, it can also be purchased at computer stores, unlike the full version of AutoCAD which must be purchased from official Autodesk dealers.  Autodesk developed AutoCAD LT so that they would have an entry-level CAD package to compete in the lower price level.

As of the 2011 release the AutoCAD LT MSRP has risen to $1200. While there are hundreds of small differences between the full AutoCAD package and AutoCAD LT, currently there are a few recognized major differences&lt;ref&gt;http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/autocad_lt_2011_faq.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in the software's features:
* 3D Capabilities: AutoCAD LT lacks the ability to create, visualize and render 3D models as well as 3D printing.
* Network Licensing: AutoCAD LT cannot be used on multiple machines over a network.
* Customization: AutoCAD LT does not support customization with LISP, ARX, and VBA.
* Management and automation capabilities with Sheet Set Manager and Action Recorder.
* CAD standards management tools.

== AutoCAD Freestyle ==
Built on the AutoCAD platform, [[AutoCAD Freestyle]] is a simplified, low-cost (US$149) application that makes it easy to create accurate, professional-looking 2D drawings and sketches.  This software has been discontinued by Autodesk.

== Student versions ==
AutoCAD is licensed at a significant discount over commercial retail pricing to qualifying students and teachers, with a 36-month license available. The student version of AutoCAD is functionally identical to the full commercial version, with one exception: DWG files created or edited by a student version have an internal bit-flag set (the &quot;educational flag&quot;). When such a DWG file is printed by any version of AutoCAD (commercial or student), the output will include a plot stamp / banner on all four sides. Objects created in the Student Version cannot be used for commercial use. These Student Version objects will &quot;infect&quot; a commercial version DWG file if imported.&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.autodesk.com/ACD/2011/ENU/filesAUG/WS1a9193826455f5ffa23ce210c4a30acaf-6050.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://students.autodesk.com Autodesk student community] provides registered students with free access to different Autodesk applications.

== Vertical programs ==
Autodesk has also developed a few vertical programs, for discipline-specific enhancements. [[AutoCAD Architecture]] (formerly Architectural Desktop), for example, permits architectural designers to draw 3D objects such as walls, doors and windows, with more intelligent data associated with them, rather than simple objects such as lines and circles. The data can be programmed to represent specific architectural products sold in the construction industry, or extracted into a data file for pricing, materials estimation, and other values related to the objects represented. Additional tools allow designers to generate standard 2D drawings, such as elevations and sections, from a 3D architectural model. Similarly, Civil Design, Civil Design 3D, and Civil Design Professional allow data-specific objects to be used, allowing standard civil engineering calculations to be made and represented easily. [[AutoCAD Electrical]], AutoCAD Civil 3D, AutoCAD Map 3D, [[AutoCAD Mechanical]], AutoCAD MEP, AutoCAD P&amp;ID, AutoCAD Plant 3D and AutoCAD Structural Detailing are other examples of industry-specific CAD applications built on the AutoCAD platform.

== File formats ==
AutoCAD's native file format, [[.dwg|DWG]], and to a lesser extent, its interchange file format, [[DXF]], have become [[de facto]] standards for CAD data [[interoperability]]. AutoCAD in recent years has included support for [[DWF]], a format developed and promoted by Autodesk for publishing CAD data. In 2006, Autodesk estimated the number of active DWG files to be in excess of one billion.

In the past, Autodesk has estimated the total number of DWG files in existence to be more than three billion.&lt;ref&gt;AutoCAD and it's Applications&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AutoCAD DXF''' (Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format) is a [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] data [[file format]] developed by [[Autodesk]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/graphics/fileformats-faq/part3/section-45.html FAQS.org]&lt;/ref&gt; for enabling [[CAD data exchange|data interoperability]] between [[AutoCAD]] and other programs.

DXF was originally introduced in December 1982 as part of AutoCAD 1.0, and was intended to provide an exact representation of the data in the AutoCAD native file format, [[.dwg|DWG]] (Drawing), for which Autodesk for many years did not publish specifications. Because of this, correct imports of DXF files have been difficult. Autodesk now publishes the DXF specifications&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
  | title = DXF specifications
  | url=http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=12272454&amp;linkID=10809853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on its website for versions of DXF dating from AutoCAD Release 13 to AutoCAD 2010.

Versions of AutoCAD from Release 10 (October 1988) and up support both [[ASCII]] and [[binary file|binary]] forms of DXF.  Earlier versions support only ASCII.

As AutoCAD has become more powerful, supporting more complex object types, DXF has become less useful. Certain object types, including [[ACIS]] solids and regions, are not documented. Other object types, including AutoCAD 2006's dynamic blocks, and all of the objects specific to the vertical-market versions of AutoCAD, are partially documented, but not well enough to allow other developers to support them. For these reasons many CAD applications use the [[.dwg|DWG]] format which can be licensed from [[AutoDesk]] or non-natively from the [[Open Design Alliance]].

== File structure ==
ASCII versions of DXF can be read with a text-editor. The basic organization of a DXF file is as follows:

*'''HEADER''' section – General information about the drawing. Each parameter has a variable name and an associated value.
*'''CLASSES''' section – Holds the information for application-defined classes whose instances appear in the BLOCKS, ENTITIES, and OBJECTS sections of the database. Generally does not provide sufficient information to allow interoperability with other programs.
*'''TABLES''' section – This section contains definitions of named items.
:Application ID (APPID) table
:Block Record (BLOCK_RECORD) table
:Dimension Style (DIMSTYPE) table
:Layer (LAYER) table
:Linetype (LTYPE) table
:Text style (STYLE) table
:User Coordinate System (UCS) table
:View (VIEW) table
:Viewport configuration (VPORT) table
*'''BLOCKS''' section – This section contains Block Definition entities describing the entities comprising each Block in the drawing.
*'''ENTITIES''' section – This section contains the drawing entities, including any Block References.
*'''OBJECTS''' section – Contains the data that apply to nongraphical objects, used by AutoLISP and ObjectARX applications.
*'''THUMBNAILIMAGE''' section – Contains the preview image for the DXF file.
*'''END OF FILE'''

The data format of a DXF is called a &quot;tagged data&quot; format which &quot;means that each data element in the file is preceded by an integer number that is called a group code. A group code's value indicates what type of data element follows. This value also indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object (or record) type. Virtually all user-specified information in a drawing file can be represented in DXF format.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chapter 1 -- DXF Format&quot; [http://www.autodesk.com/techpubs/autocad/acad2000/dxf/dxf_format.htm Autodesk.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asexual reproduction''' is a mode of reproduction by which offspring arise from a single parent, and inherit the genes of that parent only, it is reproduction which does not involve [[meiosis]], [[ploidy]] reduction, or [[fertilization]]. A more stringent definition is '''agamogenesis''' which is reproduction without the fusion of [[gamete]]s. Asexual reproduction is the primary form of reproduction for [[single-celled organism]]s such as the [[archaea]], [[bacteria]], and [[protist]]s. Many [[plant]]s and [[Fungus|fungi]] reproduce asexually as well.

While all [[prokaryote]]s reproduce asexually (without the formation and fusion of gametes), mechanisms for [[lateral gene transfer]] such as [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]], [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] and [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]] are sometimes likened to [[sexual reproduction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Narra&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author = Narra HP, Ochman H|title = Of what use is sex to bacteria?|journal = Current Biology|year = 2006|volume = 16|pages = R705–710|pmid = 16950097|doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2006.08.024|issue = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complete lack of sexual reproduction is relatively rare among multicellular organisms, particularly animals. It is not entirely understood why the ability to reproduce sexually is so common among them. Current hypotheses &lt;ref name=&quot;Dawson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author = Dawson KJ |title = The Advantage of Asexual Reproduction: When is it Two-fold?|journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology |date = October 1995|volume = 176|pages = 341–347|url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ap/jt/1995/00000176/00000003/art00203 |issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that asexual reproduction may have short term benefits when rapid population growth is important or in stable environments, while sexual reproduction offers a net advantage by allowing more rapid generation of genetic diversity, allowing adaptation to changing environments. Developmental constraints&lt;ref name=&quot;Engelstädter&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author = Engelstädter J|title = Constraints on the evolution of asexual reproduction |journal = Bioessays |date= Nov 2008|volume = 30|pages = 1138–1150|issue = 11-12 |pmid=18937362}}&lt;/ref&gt; may underlie why few animals have relinquished sexual reproduction completely in their life-cycles.

== Types==
=== Binary fission ===
{{Main|Binary fission}}
In binary fission the parent organism is replaced by two daughter organisms, because it literally divides in two. Many single-celled organisms, both [[prokaryote]]s (the [[archaea]] and the [[bacteria]]), and [[eukaryote]]s (such as [[protist]]s and unicellular [[fungi]]), reproduce asexually through binary fission; most of these are also capable of sexual reproduction. Some single-celled organisms rely on one or more [[Host (biology)|host]] organisms in order to reproduce {{Clarify|date=November 2010}}.

=== Budding ===
{{Main|Budding}}
Some cells split via [[budding]] (for example [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|baker's yeast]]), resulting in a 'mother' and 'daughter' cell. The offspring organism is smaller than the parent. Budding is also known on a multicellular level; an animal example is the [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]], which reproduces by budding. The buds grow into fully matured individuals which eventually break away from the parent organism.

=== Vegetative reproduction ===
{{Main|Vegetative reproduction}}
Vegetative reproduction is a type of asexual reproduction found in plants where new individuals are formed without the production of seeds or spores by [[meiosis]] or [[syngamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/gloss6/asexual.html |title=Asexual Reproduction |publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of vegetative reproduction include the formation of miniaturized plants called plantlets on specialized leaves (for example in [[kalanchoe]]) and some produce new plants out of [[rhizome]]s or [[stolon]] (for example in [[strawberry]]). Other plants reproduce by forming [[bulb]]s or [[tuber]]s (for example [[tulip]] bulbs and [[dahlia]] tubers). Some plants produce [[adventitious]] shoots and suckers that form along their lateral roots. Plants that reproduce vegetatively may form a [[clonal colony]], where all the individuals are clones, and the clones may cover a large area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fun Fact |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/communities/aspen/grow.shtml |title=Celebrating Wildflowers - Fading Gold - How Aspens Grow |publisher=Fs.fed.us |date=2010-05-11 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spore formation ===
{{Main|Sporogenesis}}
Many multicellular organisms form [[spore]]s during their [[biological life cycle]] in a process called '''''sporogenesis'''''. Exceptions are animals and some protists, who undergo ''gametic meiosis'' immediately followed by fertilization. Plants and many algae on the other hand undergo ''sporic meiosis'' where meiosis leads to the formation of haploid spores rather than gametes. These spores grow into multicellular individuals (called [[gametophyte]]s in the case of plants) without a fertilization event. These haploid individuals give rise to [[gamete]]s through [[mitosis]]. Meiosis and gamete formation therefore occur in separate generations or &quot;phases&quot; of the life cycle, referred to as [[alternation of generations]]. Since sexual reproduction is often more narrowly defined as the fusion of gametes ([[fertilization]]), spore formation in plant [[sporophyte]]s and algae might be considered a form of asexual reproduction (agamogenesis) despite being the result of [[meiosis]] and undergoing a reduction in [[ploidy]]. However, both events (spore formation and fertilization) are necessary to complete sexual reproduction in the plant life cycle.

Fungi and some algae can also utilize true asexual [[spore]] formation, which involves [[mitosis]] giving rise to reproductive cells called mitospores that develop into a new organism after dispersal. This method of reproduction is found for example in [[Conidium|conidial fungi]] and the [[red alga]] ''Polysiphonia'', and involves sporogenesis without meiosis. Thus the chromosome number of the spore cell is the same as that of the parent producing the spores. However, mitotic sporogenesis is an exception and most spores, such as those of plants, most [[Basidiomycota]], and many algae, are produced by [[meiosis]].

=== Fragmentation ===
{{Main|Fragmentation (reproduction)}}
Fragmentation is a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from a fragment of the parent. Each fragment develops into a mature, fully grown individual. Fragmentation is seen in many organisms such as animals (some [[annelid]] worms and [[sea stars]]), fungi, and plants. Some plants have specialized structures for reproduction via fragmentation, such as ''[[Gemma (botany)|gemmae]]'' in [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]]. Most [[lichen]]s, which are a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] union of a fungus and [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] algae or bacteria, reproduce through fragmentation to ensure that new individuals contain both symbionts. These fragments can take the form of ''soredia'', dust-like particles consisting of fungal hyphae wrapped around photobiont cells.

=== Parthenogenesis ===
{{Main|Parthenogenesis}}
Parthenogenesis is a form of sex [[agamogenesis]] in which an unfertilized egg develops into a new individual. Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in many plants, [[invertebrate]]s (e.g. water fleas, aphids, [[stick insect]]s, some ants, bees and parasitic wasps), and [[vertebrate]]s (e.g. some reptiles, amphibians, fish, very rarely birds). In plants, [[apomixis]] may or may not involve parthenogenesis.

=== Agamogenesis ===
Agamogenesis is any form of reproduction that does not involve a male gamete. Examples are [[parthenogenesis]] and [[apomixis]].

=== Apomixis and nucellar embryony ===
{{Main|Apomixis}}
{{Main|Nucellar embryony}}
Apomixis in plants is the formation of a new [[sporophyte]] without fertilization. It is important in ferns and in flowering plants, but is very rare in other seed plants. In flowering plants, the term &quot;apomixis&quot; is now most often used for agamospermy, the formation of seeds without fertilization, but was once used to include [[vegetative reproduction]]. An example of an apomictic plant would be the [[triploid]] European [[dandelion]]. Apomixis mainly occurs in two forms: In gametophytic apomixis, the embryo arises from an unfertilized egg within a diploid embryo sac that was formed without completing meiosis. In [[nucellar embryony]], the embryo is formed from the diploid [[nucellus]] tissue surrounding the embryo sac. Nucellar embryony occurs in some [[citrus]] seeds. Male apomixis can occur in rare cases, such as the Saharan Cypress where the genetic material of the embryo are derived entirely from pollen.
The term &quot;apomixis&quot; is also used for asexual reproduction in some animals, notably water-fleas, ''[[Daphnia]]''.

== Alternation between sexual and asexual reproduction ==
Some species alternate between the sexual and asexual strategies, an ability known as '''[[heterogamy]]''', depending on conditions. For example, the freshwater crustacean ''[[Daphnia]]'' reproduces by parthenogenesis in the spring to rapidly populate ponds, then switches to [[sexual reproduction]] as the intensity of competition and predation increases. Many protists and fungi alternate between sexual and asexual reproduction.

For example, the slime mold ''[[Dictyostelium]]'' undergoes binary fission (mitosis) as single-celled amoebae under favorable conditions. However, when conditions turn unfavorable, the cells aggregate and follow one of two different developmental pathways, depending on conditions. In the social pathway, they form a multicellular slug which then forms a fruiting body with asexually generated spores. In the sexual pathway, two cells fuse to form a giant cell that develops into a large cyst. When this macrocyst germinates, it releases hundreds of amoebic cells that are the product of meiotic recombination between the original two cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;MehrotraAneja1990&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=R. S. Mehrotra|author2=K. R. Aneja|title=An Introduction to Mycology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UUorj_O2dcsC&amp;pg=PA83|accessdate=4 August 2010|date=December 1990|publisher=New Age International|isbn=9788122400892|pages=83 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hyphae of the common mold (''[[Rhizopus]]'') are capable of producing both mitotic as well as meiotic spores. Many algae similarly switch between sexual and asexual reproduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ColeSheath1990&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kathleen M. Cole|author2=Robert G. Sheath|title=Biology of the red algae|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F7CWXuYZFq8C&amp;pg=PA469|accessdate=4 August 2010|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521343015|pages=469–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of plants use both sexual and asexual means to produce new plants, some species alter their primary modes of reproduction from sexual to asexual under varying environmental conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReekieBazzaz2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward G. Reekie|author2=Fakhri A. Bazzaz|title=Reproductive allocation in plants|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_KJdaiLKAogC&amp;pg=PA99|accessdate=4 August 2010|date=28 October 2005|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780120883868|pages=99–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples in animals ==
A number of invertebrates and some less advanced vertebrates are known to alternate between sexual and asexual reproduction, or be exclusively asexual. Alternation is observed in a few types of insects, such as [[aphids]] (which will, under favourable conditions, produce eggs that have not gone through meiosis, essentially cloning themselves) and the cape bee [[Apis mellifera capensis]] (which can reproduce asexually through a process called [[thelytoky]]). A few species of amphibians and reptiles have the same ability (see [[parthenogenesis]] for concrete examples). A very unusual case among more advanced vertebrates is the female [[Domesticated turkey|turkey]]'s ability to produce fertile eggs in the absence of a male. The eggs result in often sickly, and nearly always male turkeys. This behaviour can interfere with the incubation of eggs in turkey farming.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Thomas F. {{cite web

|date= 2005-09-12
|work = Oregon State University
|accessdate = 2006-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are examples of parthenogenesis in the [[hammerhead shark]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Savage
|first = Juliet Eilperin|title = Female Sharks Can Reproduce Alone, Researchers Find
|work = Washington Post |date= 2007-05-23

|accessdate = 2008-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[blacktip shark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081010173054.htm |title='Virgin Birth' By Shark Confirmed: Second Case Ever |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2008.02018.x |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2008-10-11 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the sharks had reached sexual maturity in captivity in the absence of males, and in both cases the offspring were shown to be genetically identical to the mothers.

Reptiles use the ZW chromosome system, which produces either males (ZZ) or females (ZW or WW). Until 2010, it was thought that the ZW chromosome system used by reptiles was incapable of producing viable WW offspring, but a (ZW) female boa constrictor was discovered to have produced viable female offspring with WW chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regina.com/bookmarks/boa-constrictor-produces-fatherless-babies.html|title='Boa constrictor produces fatherless babies' |publisher=CBC News - Technology&amp;Science |date=2010-11-03 |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female boa could have chosen any number of male partners (and had successfully in the past) but she chose to reproduce asexually, creating 22 uniquely chromosomed (WW) female clone-babies.


[[Polyembryony]] is a widespread form of asexual reproduction in animals, whereby the fertilized egg or a later stage of embryonic development splits to form genetically identical clones. Within animals, this phenomenon has been best studied in the parasitic [[Hymenoptera]].  In the [[9-banded armadillos]], this process is obligatory and usually gives rise to genetically identical quadruplets.  In other mammals, [[monozygotic twinning]] has no apparent genetic basis, though its occurrence is common.  There are at least 10 million identical human twins and triplets in the world today.

Bdelloid [[rotifers]] reproduce exclusively asexually, and all individuals in the class [[Bdelloidea]] are females. Asexuality evolved in these animals millions of years ago and has persisted since. There is evidence to suggest that asexual reproduction has allowed the animals to evolve new proteins through the [[Matthew Meselson#The Meselson effect|Meselson effect]] that have allowed them to survive better in periods of dehydration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pouchkina-Stantcheva|first1=N.

[[File:Aelbert Cuyp-The Negro Page.jpg|thumb|''The Negro Page'' circa 1652, oil on canvas; [[Royal Collection]]]]

'''Aelbert Jacobsz Cuyp''' (October 20, 1620 – November 15, 1691) was one of the leading [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[landscape painting|landscape]] [[Painting|painter]]s of the [[Dutch Golden Age]] in the 17th century. The most famous of a family of painters, the pupil of his father [[Jacob Gerritsz. Cuyp]] (1594–1651/52),&lt;ref name=ibiblio/&gt; he is especially known for his large views of the Dutch countryside in early morning or late afternoon light.&lt;ref name=century/&gt;

==Biography==
Aelbert Cuyp was born in [[Dordrecht]] on October 20, 1620, and also died there on November 15, 1691.&lt;ref name=century/&gt; Known as the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] equivalent of [[Claude Lorrain]], this [[landscape art]]ist went on to inherit a considerable fortune. His family were all artists, with his uncle and grandfather being [[stained glass|glass stainers]]. Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp, his father, was a [[portraitist]].&lt;ref name=gogh_gallery/&gt;

== Paintings ==
Sunlight in his paintings rakes across the panel, accentuating small bits of detail in the golden light. In large, atmospheric panoramas of the countryside, the highlights on a blade of meadow grass, the mane of a tranquil horse, the horn of a dairy cow reclining by a stream, or the tip of a peasant's hat are all caught in a bath of yellow ocher light. The richly [[varnish]]ed medium refracts the rays of light like a jewel as it dissolves into numerous glazed layers. Cuyp's landscapes were based on reality and on his own invention of what an enchanting landscape should be.

[[Image:Aelbert Cuyp 003.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''The Maas at Dordrecht'' ([[National Gallery of Art]], Washington DC)]] 
Cuyp's drawings reveal him to be a [[drawing|draftsman]] of superior quality. Light-drenched washes of [[Walnut ink|golden brown ink]] depict a distant view of the city of [[Dordrecht]] or [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].
A Cuyp drawing may look like he intended it to be a finished work of art, but it was most likely taken back to the studio and used as a reference for his paintings. Often the same section of a sketch can be found in several different pictures.

Cuyp signed many of his works but rarely dated them, so that a chronology of his career has not been satisfactorily reassembled. A phenomenal number of paintings are ascribed to him, some of which are likely to be by other masters of the golden landscape, such as [[Abraham Calraet]] (1642&amp;ndash;1722), whose initials ''A.C.'' may be mistaken for Cuyp's.

However, not everyone appreciates his work and ''River Landscape'' (1660), despite being widely regarded as amongst his best work, has been described as having &quot;[[Chocolate box art|chocolate box]] blandness&quot;.&lt;ref name=newstatesman/&gt;
{{-}}

==Later life==
After he married Cornelia Boschman in 1658, the number of works produced by him declined almost to nothing. This may have been because his wife was a very religious woman and a very big patron of the arts. It could also be that he became more active in the church under his wife's guidance. He was also active as deacon and elder of the Reformed Church, and a member of the high court of Holland.&lt;ref name=nga/&gt;

[[Image:Ethylene-3D-vdW.png|thumb|right|120px|A 3D model of [[ethylene]], the simplest alkene.]]

In [[organic chemistry]], an '''alkene''', '''olefin''', or '''olefine''' is an [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] [[chemical compound]] containing at least one [[carbon]]-to-[[carbon]] [[double bond]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Wade | first = L.G. | title = Organic Chemistry | publisher = Pearson [[Prentice Hall]] | date = Sixth Ed., 2006 | pages = 279 | isbn = 1-4058-5345-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The simplest acyclic alkenes, with only one double bond and no other [[functional group]]s, form an [[homologous series]] of [[hydrocarbon]]s with the general formula '''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;PAC1995&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal| title=Glossary of Class Names of Organic Compounds and Reactive Intermediates Based on Structure  (IUPAC Recommendations 1995)  | last = Moss | first = G.

The simplest alkene is [[ethylene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which has the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) name ''ethene''. Alkenes are also called ''olefins'' (an archaic synonym, widely used in the [[petrochemical]] industry). For bridged alkenes, the [[Bredt's rule]] states that a double bond cannot be placed at the bridgehead of a bridged ring system, unless the rings are large enough. [[Aromatic]] compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes, but their structure and properties are different and they are not considered to be alkenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;PAC1995&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal| journal= [[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] | year=1995| volume=67 | pages=1307–1375

== Structure ==
=== Bonding===
[[Image:Ethylene 3D.png|200px|thumb|Ethylene (ethene), showing the pi bond in green.]]
Like single [[covalent bond]]s, double bonds can be described in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals, except that, unlike a single bond (which consists of a single [[sigma bond]]), a carbon-carbon double bond consists of one [[sigma bond]] and one [[pi bond]]. This double bond is stronger than a single [[covalent bond]] (611&amp;nbsp;[[joules|kJ]]/[[Mole (unit)|mol]] for C=C vs. 347&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol for C—C)&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade&quot;/&gt; and also shorter with an average [[bond length]] of 1.33 [[Angstrom]]s (133 [[picometre|pm]]). 

Each carbon of the double bond uses its three ''sp²'' [[orbital hybridization|hybrid orbitals]] to form sigma bonds to three atoms. The unhybridized ''2p'' atomic orbitals, which lie perpendicular to the plane created by the axes of the three ''sp²'' hybrid orbitals, combine to form the pi bond.  This bond lies outside the main C—C axis, with half of the bond on one side and half on the other.

Rotation about the carbon-carbon double bond is restricted because it involves breaking the pi bond, which requires a large amount of energy (264&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol in ethylene).  As a consequence, substituted alkenes may exist as one of two [[isomer]]s, called ''cis'' or ''trans'' isomers.  More complex alkenes may be named using the [[E-Z notation]], used to describe molecules having three or four different [[substituent]]s (side groups). For example, of the [[Butene#Isomers|isomers of butene]], the two methyl groups of (''Z'')-but-2-ene (aka ''cis''-2-butene) face the same side of the double bond, and in (''E'')-but2-ene (aka ''trans''-2-butene) the methyl groups face the opposite side. These two isomers of butene are slightly different in their chemical and physical properties.

It is certainly not impossible to twist a double bond. In fact, a 90° twist requires an energy approximately equal to half the strength of a [[pi bond]]. The misalignment of the [[p orbital]]s is less than expected because [[pyramidalization]] takes place (See: [[pyramidal alkene]]). [[cyclooctene|''trans''-Cyclooctene]] is a stable strained alkene and the orbital misalignment is only 19° with a [[dihedral angle]] of 137° (normal 120°) and a degree of pyramidalization of 18°. This explains the [[dipole]] moment of 0.8 [[debye|D]] for this compound ([[cis-isomer]] 0.4 D) where a value of zero is expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Understanding Rotation about a C=C Double Bond| first2=Thomas H.| last2=Eberlein| last=Barrows| first=Susan E.| journal=J. Chem. Educ.| year=2005| volume=82| pages=1329| url=http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/Journal/Issues/2005/Sep/abs1329.html| doi=10.1021/ed082p1329}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''trans'' isomer of [[cycloheptene]] is only stable at low temperatures.

=== Shape ===
As predicted by the [[VSEPR theory|VSEPR]] model of [[electron]] pair repulsion, the [[molecular geometry]] of alkenes includes [[bond angle]]s about each carbon in a double bond of about 120°. The angle may vary because of [[steric strain]] introduced by [[nonbonded interactions]] created by [[functional group]]s attached to the carbons of the double bond. For example, the C-C-C bond angle in [[propylene]] is 123.9°.

==Physical properties==
The physical properties of alkenes are comparable with those of [[alkane]]s. The [[physical state]] depends on [[molecular mass]] (gases from ethene to butene - liquids from pentene onwards). The simplest alkenes, [[ethene]], [[propene]] and [[butene]] are gases. Linear alkenes of approximately five to sixteen carbons are liquids, and higher alkenes are waxy solids.

==Reactions==
Alkenes are relatively stable compounds, but are more reactive than [[alkane]]s due to the presence of a carbon-carbon pi-bond. It is also attributed to the presence of pi-electrons in the molecule.  The majority of the reactions of alkenes involve the rupture of this pi bond, forming new [[sigma bond|single bonds]].

Alkenes serve as a feedstock for the [[petrochemical]] industry because they can participate in a wide variety of reactions.

===Addition reactions===
Alkenes react in many [[addition reaction]]s, which occur by opening up the double-bond. Most addition reactions to alkenes follow the mechanism of [[electrophilic addition]]. Examples of [[addition reaction]]s are [[hydrohalogenation]], [[halogenation]], [[halohydrin formation]], [[oxymercuration]], [[Hydroboration–oxidation reaction|hydroboration]], [[dichlorocarbene addition]], [[Simmons-Smith reaction]], [[catalytic hydrogenation]], [[epoxidation]], [[radical polymerization]] and [[hydroxylation]].
:[[File:Ear.png|400px|alt=Electrophilic addition|Electrophilic addition of X–Y to an alkene]]

====Hydrogenation====
[[Hydrogenation]] of alkenes produces the corresponding [[alkane]]s. The reaction is carried out under pressure at a temperature of 200 °C in the presence of a metallic [[catalyst]]. Common industrial catalysts are based on [[platinum]], [[nickel]] or [[palladium]]. For laboratory syntheses, [[Raney nickel]] (an [[alloy]] of [[nickel]] and [[aluminium]]) is often employed. The simplest example of this reaction is the catalytic hydrogenation of [[ethylene]] to yield [[ethane]]:
:CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

====Halogenation====
In [[electrophilic halogenation]] the addition of elemental [[bromine]] or [[chlorine]] to alkenes yields [[vicinal (chemistry)|vicinal]] dibromo- and dichloroalkanes (1,2-dihalides or ethylene dihalides), respectively. The decoloration of a solution of bromine in water with dichloromethylene as catalyst is an analytical test for the presence of alkenes:

:CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → BrCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br

It is also used as a quantitive test of unsaturation, expressed as the [[bromine number]] of a single compound or mixture.  The reaction works because the high electron density at the double bond causes a temporary shift of electrons in the Br-Br bond causing a temporary induced dipole. This makes the Br closest to the double bond slightly positive and therefore an electrophile.

====Hydrohalogenation====
[[Hydrohalogenation]] is the addition of [[hydrohalic acid]]s such as [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]] or [[hydrogen bromide|HBr]] to alkenes to yield the corresponding [[haloalkane]]s.
:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HBr → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH'''Br'''-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-'''H'''
If the two carbon atoms at the double bond are linked to a different number of hydrogen atoms, the halogen is found preferentially at the carbon with fewer hydrogen substituents ([[Markovnikov's rule]]). But terminal olefin products don't yield by this method. For bromation an alternative method denominated '''[[Kharasch-Sosnovsky Reaction]]'''. is used for this purpose. It consists to add peroxides to hydrogen bromide or Copper bromide (II). 

:[[Image:AlkeneAndHBrReaction.png|600px|hydrohalogenation reaction mechanism]]

====Halohydrin formation====
Alkenes react with water and halogens to form [[halohydrin]]s by an addition reaction.  [[Markovnikov's rule|Markovnikov regiochemistry]] and anti stereochemistry occur.

: CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; → XCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH

==== Oxidation ====
Alkenes are [[organic oxidation|oxidized]] with a large number of [[oxidizing agent]]s. In the presence of [[oxygen]], alkenes burn with a bright flame to produce [[carbon dioxide]] and water. [[Catalytic]] oxidation with oxygen or the reaction with [[percarboxylic]] acids yields [[epoxide]]s.
Reaction with ozone in [[ozonolysis]] leads to the breaking of the double bond, yielding two [[aldehyde]]s or [[ketone]]s. Reaction with concentrated, hot KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (or other oxidizing salts) in an acidic solution will yield [[ketone]]s or [[carboxylic acid]]s.

:R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CH=CH-R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CHO + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CHO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
This reaction can be used to determine the position of a double bond in an unknown alkene.

====Oxymercuration====
[[Hydration reaction|Hydration]] of alkenes via [[oxymercuration reaction|oxymercuration]] to produces alcohols.  Reaction takes place on treatment of alkenes with strong acid as catalyst.

:CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH

===Polymerization===
[[Polymerization]] of alkenes is a reaction that yields [[polymer]]s of high industrial value at great economy, such as the plastics [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]]. Polymers from alkene [[monomer]]s are referred to in a general way as ''[[polyolefin]]s'' or in rare instances as ''polyalkenes''. A polymer from [[alpha-olefin]]s is called a polyalphaolefin (PAO). Polymerization can proceed via either a free-[[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] or an ionic mechanism, converting the double to a single bond and forming single bonds to join the other monomers.  Polymerization of [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] [[diene]]s such as [[buta-1,3-diene]] or [[isoprene]] (2-methylbuta-1,3-diene) results in largely 1,4-addition with possibly some 1,2-addition of the diene monomer to a growing polymer chain.  For details, see &quot;[[Polybutadiene]]&quot;.

==Synthesis==
===Industrial methods===
Alkenes are produced by hydrocarbon [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]].  Raw materials are mostly [[natural gas condensate]] components (principally ethane and propane) in the US and Mideast and [[naphtha]] in Europe and Asia.  Alkanes are broken apart at high temperatures, often in the presence of a [[zeolite]] catalyst, to produce a mixture of primarily aliphatic alkenes and lower molecular weight alkanes. The mixture is feedstock dependent and separated by fractional distillation. This is mainly used for the manufacture of small alkenes (up to six carbons).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Wade |  pages = 309 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:OctaneCracking.png|500px|center|Cracking of ''n''-octane to give pentane + propene]]

Related to this is catalytic [[dehydrogenation]], where an alkane loses hydrogen at high temperatures to produce a corresponding alkene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade&quot;/&gt;  This is the reverse of the [[catalytic hydrogenation]] of alkenes.
[[Image:ButaneDehydrogenation.png|600px|center|Dehydrogenation of butane to give butadiene and isomers of butene]]

Both of these processes are endothermic, but they are driven towards the alkene at high temperatures by [[entropy]] (the TΔS portion of the equation [[Gibbs free energy#Free energy of reactions|ΔG]] = ΔH – TΔS dominates for high T).

[[Catalytic]] synthesis of higher α-alkenes (of the type RCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can also be achieved by a reaction of ethylene with the [[organometallic compound]] [[triethylaluminium]] in the presence of [[nickel]], [[cobalt]], or [[platinum]].

===Elimination reactions===
One of the principal methods for alkene synthesis in the laboratory is the [[elimination reaction|elimination]] of alkyl halides, alcohols, and similar compounds.  Most common is the β-elimination via the E2 or E1 mechanism,&lt;ref name=&quot;PataiBook1964&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Saunders | first = W. H.  | editor = Patai, Saul | title = The Chemistry of Alkenes| publisher = Wiley Interscience | year = 1964 | pages = 149–150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but α-eliminations are also known.

The E2 mechanism provides a more reliable β-elimination method than E1 for most alkene syntheses.   Most E2 eliminations start with an alkyl halide or alkyl sulfonate ester (such as a [[tosylate]] or [[triflate]]).  When an alkyl halide is used, the reaction is called a [[dehydrohalogenation]].  For unsymmetrical products, the more substituted alkenes (those with fewer hydrogens attached to the C=C) tend to predominate (see [[Saytzeff's rule]]).  Two common methods of elimination reactions are dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides and dehydration of alcohols.  A typical example is shown below; note that the H that leaves must be ''anti'' to the leaving group, even though this leads to the less stable Z-isomer.&lt;ref name=Cram1956&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:E2EliminationExample.png|500px|center|An example of an E2 Elimination]]

Alkenes can be synthesized from [[alcohol]]s via [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]], in which case water is lost via the E1 mechanism. For example, the dehydration of [[ethanol]] produces ethene:
:[[Ethanol|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH]] + [[Sulfuric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]  →  [[Ethene|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] +  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

An alcohol may also be converted to a better leaving group (e.g., [[xanthate]]), so as to allow a milder ''syn''-elimination such as the [[Chugaev elimination]] and the [[Grieco elimination]].  Related reactions include eliminations by β-haloethers (the [[Boord olefin synthesis]]) and esters ([[ester pyrolysis]]).

Alkenes can be prepared indirectly from alkyl [[amine]]s.  The amine or ammonia is not a suitable leaving group, so the amine is first either [[alkylation|alkylated]] (as in the [[Hofmann elimination]]) or oxidized to an [[amine oxide]] (the [[Cope reaction]]) to render a smooth elimination possible.  Hofmann elimination is unusual in that the ''less'' substituted (non-[[Saytzeff's rule|Saytseff]]) alkene is usually the major product. The Cope reaction is a ''syn''-elimination that occurs at or below 150&amp;nbsp;°C, for example:&lt;ref name=&quot;CopeElimination1973&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bach, R.D. | title=Mechanism of the Cope elimination | journal=J. Org. Chem. | year=1973| volume=38| pages=1742–3 | doi=10.1021/jo00949a029 | last2 = Andrzejewski | first2 = Denis | last3 = Dusold | first3 = Laurence R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:CopeEliminationExample.png|300px|center|Synthesis of cyclooctene via Cope elimination]]

Alkenes are generated from α-halo [[sulfone]]s in the [[Ramberg-Bäcklund reaction]], via a three-membered ring sulfone intermediate.

===Synthesis from carbonyl compounds===
Another important method for alkene synthesis involves construction of a new carbon-carbon double bond by coupling of a carbonyl compound (such as an [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]]) to a [[carbanion]] equivalent.  Such reactions are sometimes called ''olefinations''.  The most well-known of these methods is the [[Wittig reaction]], but other related methods are known.

The Wittig reaction involves reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a [[Wittig reagent]] (or phosphorane) of the type Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CHR to produce an alkene and [[Triphenylphosphine oxide|Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=O]].  The Wittig reagent is itself prepared easily from [[triphenylphosphine]] and an alkyl halide.  The reaction is quite general and many functional groups are tolerated, even esters, as in this example:&lt;ref name=&quot;Snider2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last=Snider| first=Barry B. | title=Synthesis of ent-Thallusin | journal=Org. Lett.| year=2006| volume=8| pages=2123–6|doi=10.1021/ol0605777| pmid=16671797| last2=Matsuo| first2=Y| last3=Snider| first3=BB| issue=10| pmc=2518398 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:WittigReactionExample.png|350px|center|A typical example of the Wittig reaction]]
 
Related to the Wittig reaction is the [[Peterson olefination]].  This uses a less accessible silicon-based reagent in place of the phosphorane, but it allows for the selection of E or Z products.  If an E-product is desired, another alternative is the [[Julia olefination]], which uses the carbanion generated from a [[phenyl]] [[sulfone]]. The [[Takai olefination]] based on an organochromium intermediate also delivers E-products.  A titanium compound, [[Tebbe's reagent]], is useful for the synthesis of methylene compounds; in this case, even esters and amides react.

A pair of carbonyl compounds can also be reductively coupled together (with reduction) to generate an alkene.  Symmetrical alkenes can be prepared from a single aldehyde or ketone coupling with itself, using Ti metal reduction (the [[McMurry reaction]]).  If two different ketones are to be coupled, a more complex, indirect method such as the [[Barton-Kellogg reaction]] may be used.

A single ketone can also be converted to the corresponding alkene via its tosylhydrazone, using [[sodium methoxide]] (the [[Bamford-Stevens reaction]]) or an alkyllithium (the [[Shapiro reaction]]).

===Synthesis from alkenes: Olefin metathesis and hydrovinylation===
{{main|Olefin metathesis}}
Alkenes can be prepared by exchange with other alkenes, in a reaction known as [[olefin metathesis]].  Frequently, loss of ethene gas is used to drive the reaction towards a desired product.  In many cases, a mixture of geometric isomers is obtained, but the reaction tolerates many functional groups.  The method is particularly effective for the preparation of cyclic alkenes, as in this synthesis of [[muscone]]: 
[[Image:MusconeViaRCM.png|500px|center|Ring-closing metathesis used in synthesis of muscone]]

Transition metal catalyzed hydrovinylation is another important alkene synthesis process starting from alkene itself.&lt;ref name=Vogt2010&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Vogt, D.  | year = 2010  | pages = 7166–8  | title = Cobalt-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrovinylation  | issue = 40  | pmid = 20672269  | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.  | volume = 49  | doi = 10.1002/anie.201003133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, it involves the addition of a hydrogen and a vinyl group (or an alkenyl group) across a double bond. The hydrovinylation reaction was first reported by Alderson, Jenner, and Lindsey by using rhodium and ruthenium salts, other metal catalysts commonly employed nowadays included iron, cobalt, nickel, and palladium.

===From alkynes===
Reduction of [[alkyne]]s is a useful method for the [[stereoselectivity|stereoselective]] synthesis of disubstituted alkenes.  If the ''cis''-alkene is desired, [[hydrogenation]] in the presence of [[Lindlar's catalyst]](-heterogeneous catalyst that consists of palladium deposited on calcium carbonate and treated with various forms of lead) is commonly used, though hydroboration followed by hydrolysis provides an alternative approach.  Reduction of the alkyne by [[sodium]] metal in liquid [[ammonia]] gives the ''trans''-alkene.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZweifelNantz&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Zweifel | first = George S. | coauthors = Nantz, Michael H.| title = Modern Organic Synthesis: An Introduction  |  publisher = W. H. Freeman &amp; Co. | location = New York | year = 2007 | pages = 366 | isbn = 0-7167-7266-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:AlkyneToAlkene.png|600px|center|Synthesis of ''cis''- and ''trans''-alkenes from alkynes]]

For the preparation multisubstituted alkenes, [[carbometalation]] of alkynes can give rise to a large variety of alkene derivatives.

===Rearrangements and related reactions===
Alkenes can be synthesized from other alkenes via [[rearrangement reaction]]s.  Besides [[olefin metathesis]] (described [[#Olefin metathesis|above]]), a large number of [[pericyclic reaction]]s can be used such as the [[ene reaction]] and the [[Cope rearrangement]].  

[[Image:3,3copeexpansion.svg|180px|center|Cope rearrangement of divinylcyclobutane to cyclooctadiene]]

In the [[Diels-Alder reaction]], a [[cyclohexene]] derivative  is prepared from a diene and a reactive or electron-deficient alkene.

==Nomenclature==
===IUPAC Names===
To form the root of the [[IUPAC nomenclature|IUPAC]] names for alkenes, simply change the -an- infix of the parent to -en-. For example, '''CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the [[alkane]] ''ethANe''. The name of '''CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' is therefore ''ethENe''.

In higher alkenes, where [[isomers]] exist that differ in location of the double bond, the following numbering system is used:
# Number the longest carbon chain that contains the double bond in the direction that gives the carbon atoms of the double bond the lowest possible numbers.
# Indicate the location of the double bond by the location of its first carbon.
# Name branched or substituted alkenes in a manner similar to [[alkane]]s.
# Number the carbon atoms, locate and name substituent groups, locate the double bond, and name the main chain.

[[Image:Alkene nomenclature.png|550px|center|thumb|Naming substituted hex-1-enes]]

===Cis-Trans notation===
{{main|Cis-trans isomerism}}
In the specific case of disubstituted alkenes where the two carbons have one substituent each, [[Cis-trans isomerism|Cis-trans]] notation may be used. If both substituents are on the same side of the bond, it is defined as (cis-). If the substituents are on either side of the bond, it is defined as (trans-).
[[Image:Cis-trans example.svg|thumb|300px|center|The difference between ''cis-'' and ''trans-'' isomers]]

===E,Z notation===
{{main|E-Z notation}}
When an alkene has more than one substituent (especially necessary with 3 or 4 substituents), the double bond geometry is described using the labels ''E'' and ''Z''. These labels come from the German words &quot;entgegen,&quot; meaning &quot;opposite,&quot; and &quot;zusammen,&quot; meaning &quot;together.&quot; Alkenes with the higher priority groups (as determined by [[Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rule|CIP rules]]) on the same side of the double bond have these groups together and are designated ''Z''. Alkenes with the higher priority groups on opposite sides are designated ''E''.   A mnemonic to remember this:  Z notation has the higher priority groups on &quot;ze zame zide.&quot;

[[Image:EZalkenes2.png|400px|center|thumb|The difference between ''E'' and ''Z'' isomers]]

===Groups containing C=C double bonds===
IUPAC recognizes two names for hydrocarbon groups containing carbon-carbon double bonds, the [[vinyl]] group and the [[allyl]] group. .&lt;ref name=&quot;PAC1995&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Allene.png|right|thumb|[[Propadiene]], the simplest allene, is also known as allene.]]
{{for|the community in Arkansas|Alleene, Arkansas}}
An '''allene''' is a [[hydrocarbon]] in which one atom of [[carbon]] is connected by [[covalent bond|double bonds]] to two other atoms of carbon, where the carbon atom is double bonded on either side.  Allene also is the common name for the parent compound of this series, [[propadiene]].

Such pair of bonds make allenes much more reactive than other [[alkene]]s.
For example, their reactivity with gaseous [[chlorine]] is more like the reactivity of [[alkyne]]s. Allenes can be [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]].

==Geometry==
[[Image:Allene3D.png|thumb|right|3D view of allene.]]
The central carbon of allene forms two [[sigma bond]]s and two [[pi bond]]s. The central carbon is [[Orbital hybridization|sp-hybridized]], and the two terminal carbons are sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized. The bond angle formed by the three carbons is 180°, indicating linear geometry for the carbons of allene.

==Symmetry==
[[Image:Allene symmetry.png|none|left|300px]]
For allenes with four identical substituents, there exist two twofold axes of rotation through the center carbon, inclined at 45° to the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; planes at either end of the molecule. The molecule can thus be thought of as a two-bladed [[propeller]]. A third twofold axis of rotation passes through the C=C=C bonds, and there is a mirror plane passing through both CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; planes. Thus this class of molecules belong to the D&lt;sub&gt;2d&lt;/sub&gt; [[point group]].

{{-}}
[[Image:Allene chirality.png|none|left|300px]]
An allene with only two substituents '''A''' and '''B''' on each carbon will be [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] because there will no longer be any mirror planes. Where '''A''' has a greater priority than '''B''' according to the [[Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rule]], the configuration can be determined by considering the top, then the bottom. For the bottom, only the group of higher priority need be considered.
{{-}}

Because of the symmetry, an unsubstituted allene has no net [[Bond dipole moment|dipole moment]].

==Synthesis==
Laboratory methods for the formation of allenes are:
* from geminal dihalocyclopropanes and organolithium compounds in the [[Skattebøl rearrangement]].
* from reaction of certain terminal [[alkyne]]s with [[formaldehyde]] [[copper(II) bromide]] and added base&lt;ref&gt;[[Organic Syntheses]], Coll. Vol. 7, p.276 (1990); Vol. 63, p.203 (1985). [http://www.orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV7P0276.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Acetylene-3D-vdW.png|Alkyne|right|thumb|A 3D model of [[acetylene]], the simplest alkyne]]
'''Alkynes''' are [[hydrocarbon]]s that have a [[triple bond]] between two [[carbon]] atoms, with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n-2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Alkynes are traditionally known as acetylenes, although the name ''acetylene'' also refers specifically to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, known formally as [[ethyne]] using [[IUPAC]] nomenclature. Like other hydrocarbons, alkynes are generally hydrophobic but tend to be more reactive.

==Chemical properties==
Alkynes are characteristically more unsaturated than alkenes.  Thus they add two equivalents of bromine whereas an alkene adds only one equivalent.  Other reactions are listed below. Alkynes are usually more reactive than [[alkene]]s.  They show greater tendency to polymerize or oligomerize than alkenes do. The resulting polymers, called [[polyacetylene]]s (which do not contain alkyne units) are [[conjugated system|conjugated]] and can exhibit semiconducting properties.

== Structure and bonding==
In acetylene, the H-C≡C [[bond angle]]s are 180°. By virtue of this bond angle, alkynes tend to be rod-like.  Correspondingly, cyclic alkynes are rare.  [[Benzyne]] is highly unstable.  The C≡C bond distance of 121 [[picometer]]s is much shorter than the C=C distance in [[alkene]]s (134 pm) or the C-C bond in alkanes (153 pm).
:[[image:AlkyneVarietyPack.png|thumb|center|450px|Illustrative alkynes: a, two depictions of propyne, b, the naturally-occurring 1-phenylhepta-1,3,5-triyne, and c, the strained cycloheptyne.]]

The triple bond is very strong with a [[bond strength]] of 839 kJ/mol. The sigma bond contributes 369 kJ/mol, the first pi bond contributes 268 kJ/mol and the second pi bond of 202 kJ/mol bond strength. Bonding usually discussed in the context of [[molecular orbital theory]], which recognizes the triple bond as arising from overlap of s and p orbitals.  In the language of [[valence bond theory]], the carbon atoms in an alkyne bond are [[sp hybridized]]: they each have two unhybridized [[p orbital]]s and two [[Orbital hybridisation|sp hybrid orbitals]]. Overlap of an sp orbital from each atom forms one sp-sp [[sigma bond]]. Each p orbital on one atom overlaps one on the other atom, forming two [[pi bond]]s, giving a total of three bonds. The remaining sp orbital on each atom can form a sigma bond to another atom, for example to hydrogen atoms in the parent acetylene]. The two sp orbitals project on opposite sides of the carbon atom.

===Terminal and internal alkynes===
Internal alkynes feature carbon substituents on each acetylenic carbon.  Symmetrical examples include [[diphenyl acetylene]] and [[3-hexyne]].  A representative unsymmetrical internal alkyne is [[propiolic acid]].  [[Terminal alkynes]] have at least one hydrogen atom bonded to an sp hybridized carbon (those involved in the triple bond. An example would be [[methylacetylene]] (propyne using IUPAC nomenclature).  Terminal alkynes and [[acetylene]] are mildly acidic. The acidic hydrogen on terminal alkynes can be replaced by a variety of groups resulting in halo-, silyl-, and alkoxoalkynes.

==Synthesis==
Commercially, the dominant alkyne is acetylene itself, which is used as a fuel and a precursor to other compounds, e.g., acrylates. Hundreds of millions of kilograms are produced annually by dehydrogenation of natural gas:
: 2 CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;   →   HC&amp;equiv;CH  +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Propyne, also industrially useful, is also prepared by [[thermal cracking]] of hydrocarbons.  Most other industrially useful alkyne derivatives are prepared from acetylene, e.g. via condensation with formaldehyde.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter Pässler, Werner Hefner, Klaus Buckl, Helmut Meinass, Andreas Meiswinkel, Hans-Jürgen Wernicke, Günter Ebersberg, Richard Müller, Jürgen Bässler, Hartmut Behringer, Dieter Mayer |chapter=Acetylene |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |date=October 15, 2008 |isbn= |pages= |doi=10.1002/14356007.a01_097.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialty alkynes are prepared by [[dehydrohalogenation]] of [[Vicinal (chemistry)|vicinal]] alkyl [[Halide|dihalides]] or vinyl halides.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | prep = cv4p0763 | collvol = 4 | collvolpages = 763 | year = 1963 | title = Phenylacetylene | author = Kenneth N. Campbell and Barbara K. Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metal acetylides can be coupled with primary [[alkyl halide]]s.  Via the [[Fritsch-Buttenberg-Wiechell rearrangement]], alkynes are prepared from [[vinyl bromide]]s.  Alkynes can be prepared from [[aldehyde]]s using the [[Corey-Fuchs reaction]] and from aldehydes or [[ketone]]s by the [[Seyferth–Gilbert homologation]].  In the [[alkyne zipper reaction]], alkynes are generated from other alkynes by treatment with a strong base.

==Reactions==
Featuring a reactive [[functional group]], alkynes participate in many [[organic reaction]]s.

===Addition of hydrogen, halogens, and related reagents===
Alkynes characteristically undergo reactions that show that they are &quot;doubly unsaturated,&quot; meaning that each alkyne unit is capable of adding two equivalents of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[halogen]]s or related HX reagents (X = halide, pseudohalide, etc.).  Depending on catalysts and conditions, alkynes add one or two equivalents of hydrogen. [[Hydrogenation]] to the [[alkene]] is usually more desirable since alkanes are less useful:
:RC&amp;equiv;CR'  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   ''cis''-RCH=CR'H
The largest scale application of this technology is the conversion of acetylene to ethylene in refineries.  The steam cracking of alkanes affords a few percent acetylene, which is selectively hydrogenated in the presence of a [[palladium]]/[[silver]] catalyst.  For more complex alkynes, the [[Lindlar catalyst]] is widely recommended to avoid formation of the alkane, for example in the conversion of [[phenylacetylene]] to [[styrene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | collvol = 5 | collvolpages = 880 | year = 1973 | prep = cv5p0880 | author = H. Lindlar and R. Dubuis | title = Palladium catalyst for partial reduction of acetylenes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Image:ApplicationLindlarCatalyst.svg|400px|center|Application Lindlar Catalyst]]

Similarly, [[halogenation]] of alkynes gives the vinyl dihalides or alkyl tetrahalides:

:RC&amp;equiv;CR' + 2 Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  → RCBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CRBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The addition of nonpolar E-H bonds across C≡C is general for silanes, boranes, and related hydrides.  The [[hydroboration-oxidation reaction|hydroboration]] of alkynes gives vinylic boranes which oxidize to the corresponding [[aldehyde]] or ketone. In the [[thiol-yne reaction]] the substrate is a thiol.

[[Hydrohalogenation]] gives the corresponding [[vinyl halide]]s or alkyl dihalides, again depending on the number of equivalents of HX added.  The addition of water to alkynes is a related reaction except the initial [[enol]] intermediate converts to the ketone or aldehyde.  Illustrative is the hydration of [[phenylacetylene]] gives [[acetophenone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fukuda, Y.; Utimoto, K. | title = Effective transformation of unactivated alkynes into ketones or acetals with a gold(III) catalyst | journal = [[J. Org. Chem.]] | doi = 10.1021/jo00011a058 | year = 1991 | volume = 56 | pages = 3729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the (Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)AuCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed hydration of 1,8-nonadiyne to 2,8-nonanedione:&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Mizushima, E.; Cui, D.-M.; Nath, D. C. D.; Hayashi, T.; Tanaka, M. | title = Au(I)-Catalyzed hydratation of alkynes: 2,8-nonanedione | volume = 83 | pages = 55 | year = 2005 | prep = v83p0055}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:PhC&amp;equiv;CH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  → PhCOCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
: HC&amp;equiv;CC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;C&amp;equiv;CH + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;rarr; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;COCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

===Cycloadditions and oxidation===
Alkynes undergo diverse [[cycloaddition]] reactions. Most notable is the [[Diels-Alder reaction]] with 1,3-[[diene]]s to give 1,4-[[cyclohexadiene]]s.  This general reaction has been extensively developed and electrophilic alkynes are especially effective [[dienophile]]s.  The &quot;cycloadduct&quot; derived from the addition of alkynes to [[2-pyrone]] eliminates [[carbon dioxide]] to give the [[aromatic]] compound.  Other specialized cycloadditions include multicomponent reactions such as [[alkyne trimerisation]] to give [[aromatic]] compounds and the [2+2+1]cycloaddition of an alkyne, [[alkene]] and [[carbon monoxide]] in the [[Pauson–Khand reaction]].  Non-carbon reagents also undergo  cyclization, e.g. [[Azide alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition]] to give [[triazole]]s.  Cycloaddition processes involving alkynes are often catalyzed by metals, e.g. [[enyne metathesis]] and [[alkyne metathesis]], which allows the scrambling of carbyne (RC) centers:
:RC&amp;equiv;CR + R'C&amp;equiv;CR'  &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{\leftarrow}&lt;/math&gt;  2 RC&amp;equiv;CR'
Oxidative cleavage of alkynes proceeds via cycloaddition to metal oxides.  Most famously, [[potassium permanganate]] converts alkynes to a pair of [[carboxylic acid]]s.

===Reactions specific for terminal alkynes===
In addition to undergoing the reactions characteristic of internal alkynes, terminal alkynes are reactive as weak acids, with [[Acid dissociation constant|pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] values (25) between that of [[ammonia]] (35) and [[ethanol]] (16). The acetylide [[conjugate base]] is stabilized as a result of the high s character of the sp orbital, in which the electron pair resides. [[Electron]]s in an s orbital benefit from closer proximity to the positively charged atom nucleus, and are therefore lower in energy.  Treatment of terminal alkynes with a [[strong base]] gives the corresponding [[metal acetylide]]s:
:RC&amp;equiv;CH  +  MX  →   RC&amp;equiv;CM  +  HX (MX = [[sodium amide|NaNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[N-Butyllithium|LiBu]],  [[Grignard reagent|RMgX]])
The reactions of alkynes with certain metal cations, e.g. Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; also gives acetylides. Thus, few drops of [[Tollens reagent|diamminesilver(I) hydroxide]] (Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH) reacts with terminal alkynes signaled by formation of a white precipitate of the silver acetylide. 
Acetylide derivatives are synthetically useful [[nucleophile]]s that participate in C-C bond forming reactions, as illustrated in the area called [[Carbonylation|&quot;Reppe Chemistry&quot;]].  

In the [[Favorskii reaction]], terminal alkynes add to [[carbonyl]] compounds to give the [[hydroxyalkyne]].  [[Coupling reaction|Coupling]] of terminal alkynes to give di-alkynes is effected in the [[Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling]], [[Glaser coupling]], and the [[Eglinton coupling]] reactions. Terminal alkynes can also be coupled to aryl or vinyl halides as in the [[Sonogashira coupling]].

==Alkynes in nature and medicine==
Alkynes are relatively rare in nature.  Triynes, species with the linkage RC≡C-C≡C-C≡CR', occur in certain plants ([[Ichthyothere]], [[Chrysanthemum]], and other members of the [[Asteraceae]] family).  These compounds are highly bioactive, e.g. as [[nematocide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lam, Jørgen |title=Chemistry and biology of naturally-occurring acetylenes and related compounds (NOARC): proceedings of a Conference on the Chemistry and Biology of Naturally-Occurring Acetylenes and Related Compounds (NOARC) |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |year=1988 |pages= |isbn=0-444-87115-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  1-Phenylhepta-1,3,5-triyne is illustrative of a naturally occurring triyne.

Alkynes occur in some pharmaceuticals, including the contraceptive [[norethynodrel]]. A carbon-carbon triple bond is also present in marketed drugs such as the antiretroviral [[Efavirenz]] and the antifungal [[Terbinafine]].  Molecules called ene-diynes feature a ring containing an alkene (&quot;ene&quot;) between two alkyne groups (&quot;diyne&quot;).  These compounds, e.g. [[calicheamicin]], are some of the most aggressive antitumor drugs known, so much so that the ene-diyne subunit is sometimes referred to as a &quot;warhead.&quot;  Ene-diynes undergo rearrangement via the [[Bergman cyclization]], generating highly reactive radical intermediates that attack DNA within the tumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = S.

'''AbiWord''' is a [[free and open source software]] [[word processor]]. It was originally started by SourceGear Corporation as the first part of a proposed AbiSuite. Development stopped when SourceGear changed their focus to [[Internet appliance]]s. AbiWord was adopted by some open source developers and AbiWord continued to be developed. The name &quot;AbiWord&quot; (pronounced ab-be, like the name, &quot;Abby&quot; + wûrd) is derived from the root of the Spanish word &quot;''[[wikt:en:abierto#Spanish|abierto]]''&quot;, meaning &quot;open&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;abi&quot;&gt;Project Mascot [http://www.abisource.com/~abi/ Abi the Ant].  Page explains Abi is pronounced just like &quot;Abby&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It runs on [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[ReactOS]], Solaris, [[AmigaOS]] 4.0 (through its [[Cygnix]] [[X11]] engine), and other [[operating system]]s. However, the [[Mac OS X]] port has been stuck in version 2.4 since 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; although the current version does run non-natively on Mac OS X through [[X11.app]]. AbiWord is part of [[GNOME Office]], a collection of office applications with some degree of integration.

==Features==
AbiWord supports both basic word processing features such as lists, indents and character formats, and more sophisticated features including tables, styles, page headers and footers, [[footnotes]], templates, multiple views, page columns, [[spell check]]ing, and [[grammar check]]ing.&lt;ref name=&quot;grammar-check&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| publisher = [[Slashdot]]
| quote = &quot;The recently released AbiWord-2.4...is the first Free Word Processor to offer an integrated Grammar Checker&quot;
| accessdate = 2007-11-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with version 2.8.0, AbiWord includes a [[collaborative software|collaboration]] plugin that allows integration with AbiCollab.net, a Web-based service that permits multiple users to work on the same document [[Collaborative real-time editor|in real time]], in full synchronization.  The Presentation view of AbiWord, which permits easy display of presentations created in AbiWord on &quot;screen-sized&quot; pages, is another feature not often found in word processors.

===Interface===
AbiWord generally works similarly to classic versions (pre-Office 2007) of [[Microsoft Word]], as direct ease of migration was a high priority early goal.  While many interface similarities remain, cloning the Word interface is not a top priority.  The interface is intended to follow user interface guidelines for each respective platform.

===File formats===
AbiWord is packaged with several import and export filters for formats including [[HTML]], [[Microsoft Word]] (.doc), [[Office Open XML]] (.docx),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[OpenDocument|OpenDocument Text]] (.odt), [[Rich Text Format]] (.rtf), and [[Plain text|text document]]s (.txt). [[LaTeX]] is supported for export only. Plug-in filters are available to deal with many other formats, notably [[WordPerfect]] documents. The native [[file format]], .abw, uses [[XML]], so as to mitigate [[vendor lock-in]] concerns with respect to interoperability and [[digital archiving]].

===Grammar checking===
The AbiWord project includes a grammar checking plugin using [[Link Grammar]]. AbiWord had grammar checking before any other open source word processor, although a grammar checker was later added to [[OpenOffice.org]].&lt;ref name=&quot;grammar-check&quot; /&gt; Link Grammar is both a theory of syntax and an open source parser which is now{{When|date=May 2010}} developed by the AbiWord project.

===Version differences===
AbiWord 2.6.x does not support Windows 9x. Users of these systems may still use [http://www.abisource.com/downloads/abiword/2.5.2/ AbiWord 2.5.2].

The procedure is described in a series of papers from the early 1970s by [[Bruce Ames]] and his group at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

== General Procedure ==
[[Image:Ames test.svg|500px|right|thumb|Ames test procedure]]
The test uses several strains of the bacterium ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'' that carry mutations in genes involved in [[histidine]] synthesis i.e. it is an auxotrophic mutant, so that they require histidine for growth. The variable being tested is the mutagen's ability to cause a reversion to growth on a histidine-free medium. The tester strains are specially constructed to have both [[Translational frameshift|frameshift]] and [[point mutation|point]] [[mutation]]s in the genes required to synthesize histidine, which allows for the detection of mutagens acting via different mechanisms. Some compounds are quite specific, causing reversions in just one or two strains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=  Nishant G. Chapla, E. G. Gurney, James A. Miller, and H. Bartsch | title=  Carcinogens as Frameshift Mutagens: Metabolites and Derivatives of 2-acetylaminofluorene and other Aromatic Amine Carcinogens | journal= PNAS | year=  1972  | volume= 69| pages= 3128–2132 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/69/11/3128 | doi=  10.1073/pnas.69.11.3128 | pmid=  4564203 | issue=  11 | pmc=  389719}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tester strains also carry mutations in the genes responsible for [[lipopolysaccharide]] synthesis, making the [[cell wall]] of the bacteria more permeable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=   Bruce N. Ames, Frank D. Lee, and William E.

The bacteria are spread on an [[agar]] plate with a small amount of histidine. This small amount of histidine in the growth medium allows the bacteria to grow for an initial time and have the opportunity to mutate.
When the histidine is depleted only bacteria that have mutated to gain the ability to produce its own histidine will survive. The plate is incubated for 48 hours. The mutagenicity of a substance is proportional to the number of colonies observed.

==Problems==
As Salmonella is a prokaryote, it is not a perfect model for humans. An adapted ''in vitro'' model has been made for eukaryotic cells, for example yeast structure.  The original test also doesn't count for metabolites that are formed by in the hepatic system.  Modified tests can include liver [[S9 fraction]] to help recreate the system and observe whether the parent molecule's metabolites formed in the hepatic system are positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Optimization in drug discovery: in vitro methods | series=Methods in pharmacology and toxicology | editor1-first=Zhengyin | editor1-last=Yan | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-last=Caldwell | publisher=Humana Press | year=2004 | isbn=1-58829-332-7 | chapter=&quot;Improvement of the Ames test using human liver S9 preparation&quot; }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further tests would be needed to determine the specific metabolite that causes a positive Ames to further any drugs development.

Drugs that contain the nitrate moiety sometimes come back positive for Ames when they are indeed safe.  Nitroglycerin is an example that gives a positive Ames yet is still used in treatment today.  The conditions of the Ames test are dosed at very high concentrations and with nitrate compounds that can potentially generate nitric oxide (NO), an important signal molecule, will give a false positive.  Long toxicology and outcome studies are needed with such compounds to disprove a positive Ames test.

'''ACE inhibitors''' or '''[[angiotensin-converting enzyme]] inhibitors''' are a group of [[pharmaceutical|drugs]] used primarily for the treatment of [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure) and [[congestive heart failure]]. Originally synthesized from compounds found in [[pit viper]] [[snake venom|venom]], they [[inhibitor|inhibit]] angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a component of the blood pressure-regulating [[renin-angiotensin system]]. 

Frequently prescribed ACE inhibitors include [[captopril]], [[enalapril]], [[lisinopril]], and [[ramipril]].

==Clinical use==
ACE inhibitors are used primarily to treat [[hypertension]], although they may also be prescribed for [[cardiac failure]], [[renal disease]], [[systemic sclerosis]], diabetic nephropathy, left-ventricular hypertrophy and other disorders.

==Mechanism of action==
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

===The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)===
{{Main|Renin-angiotensin system}}
[[Image:Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.png|thumb|475px|[[Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system]]]]
One mechanism for maintaining the blood pressure is the release of a protein called '''[[renin]]''' from cells in the [[kidney]] (to be specific, the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]]). This produces another protein, '''[[angiotensin]]''', which signals the [[adrenal gland]] to produce a hormone called '''[[aldosterone]]'''. This system is activated in response to a fall in blood pressure ([[hypotension]]), as well as markers of problems with the salt-water balance of the body, such as decreased [[sodium]] concentration in the [[Distal convoluted tubule|distal tubule]] of the kidney, decreased blood volume and stimulation of the kidney by the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. In such situations, the kidneys release [[renin]], which acts as an [[enzyme]] and cuts off all but the first 10 [[amino acid]] residues of [[angiotensinogen]] (a protein made in the liver, and which circulates in the blood). These 10 residues are then known as [[angiotensin I]]. Angiotensin I is then converted to [[angiotensin II]] by [[angiotensin converting enzyme]] (ACE), which removes a further two residues, and is found in the [[pulmonary circulation]], as well as in the [[endothelium]] of many blood vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Human Physiology, Silverthorn (Pearson Benjamin Cummings 2004){{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system in general aims to increase blood pressure by increasing the amount of salt and water the body retains, although angiotensin is also very good at causing the blood vessels to tighten (a potent [[vasoconstrictor]]).

===Effects===
ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.&lt;ref name='Ogbru'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/ace_inhibitors/article.htm |title=ACE Inhibitors (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors) |accessdate=2010-03-20 |author=Ogbru O |work=MedicineNet.com |publisher=MedicineNet, Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They, therefore, lower [[arteriole|arteriolar]] resistance and increase venous capacity; increase [[cardiac output]], [[cardiac index]], stroke work, and [[stroke volume|volume]]; lower renovascular resistance; and lead to increased [[natriuresis]] (excretion of [[sodium]] in the [[urine]]).
Renin will increase in concentration in the blood due to negative feedback of conversion of AI to AII. Angiotensin I will increase for the same reason. AII will decrease. Aldosterone will decrease. Bradykinin will increase due to less inactivation that is done by ACE enzyme. 

Under normal conditions, angiotensin II will have the following effects:
*Vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) by AII may lead to increased blood pressure and [[hypertension]]. Further, constriction of the [[efferent arteriole]]s of the [[kidney]] leads to increased perfusion pressure in the [[glomerulus|glomeruli]].
*It contributes to [[ventricular remodeling]] and [[ventricular hypertrophy]] of the heart.
*Stimulation by AII of the adrenal cortex to release [[aldosterone]] , a hormone that acts on kidney tubules, causes sodium and chloride ions retention and potassium excretion. Sodium is a &quot;water-holding&quot; molecule, so water is also retained, which leads to increased blood volume, hence an increase in blood pressure.
*Stimulation of the posterior pituitary to release [[vasopressin]] (also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH))  also acts on the kidneys to increase water retention.
*A decrease renal protein kinase C is caused.

With ACE inhibitor use, the effects of angiotensin II are prevented, leading to decreased blood pressure.

[[Epidemiology|Epidemiological]] and clinical studies have shown ACE inhibitors reduce the progress of [[diabetic nephropathy]] independently from their blood pressure-lowering effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=10780101 |year=2000 |author1=Hoogwerf |first2=JB |title=The HOPE study. Ramipril lowered cardiovascular risk, but vitamin E did not |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=287–93 |journal=Cleveland Clinic journal of medicine |last2=Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action of ACE inhibitors is used in the prevention of diabetic [[renal failure]].

ACE inhibitors have been shown to be effective for indications other than hypertension even in patients with normal blood pressure. The use of a maximum dose of ACE inhibitors in such patients (including for prevention of diabetic nephropathy, congestive heart failure, prophylaxis of cardiovascular events) is justified because it improves clinical outcomes, independent of the blood pressure-lowering effect of ACE inhibitors. Such therapy, of course, requires careful and gradual titration of the dose to prevent the effects of rapidly decreasing blood pressure (dizziness, fainting, etc.).

ACE inhibitors have also been shown to cause a central enhancement of parasympathetic activity in healthy volunteers and patients with heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1097/00004872-198502000-00008 |title=Acute and Chronic Effects of the Converting Enzyme Inhibitors Enalapril and Lisinopril on Reflex Control of Heart Rate in Normotensive Man |year=1985 |last1=Ajayi |first1=Adesuyi A. |first2=Brian C. |first3=Catherine A. |first4=John L. |journal=Journal of Hypertension |volume=3 |pages=47 |pmid=2987341 |issue=1 |last2=Campbell |last3=Howie |last4=Reid}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adigun |first=AQ|coauthors=Asiyanbola B, Ajayi AA|year=2001|journal=Cell Mol Biol|volume=47|pages=1063–7|pmid=11785658|title=Cardiac autonomic function in Blacks with congestive heart failure: vagomimetic action, alteration in sympathovagal balance, and the effect of ACE inhibition on central and peripheral vagal tone|issue=6}}{{Verify source|title?|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action may reduce the prevalence of malignant cardiac arrhythmias, and the reduction in sudden death reported in large clinical trials.

==Adverse effects==
Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s include: [[hypotension]], [[cough]], [[hyperkalemia]], [[headache]], [[Vertigo (medical)|dizziness]], [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[nausea]], and renal impairment.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMH2006&quot;&gt;Rossi S, editor. [[Australian Medicines Handbook]] 2006. Adelaide: Australian Medicines Handbook; 2006. ISBN 0-9757919-2-3.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some evidence also suggests ACE inhibitors might increase [[inflammation]]-related [[pain]].&lt;ref&gt;Fein, A. 2009. ACE inhibitors worsen inflammatory pain. ''Medical Hypotheses'' 72: 757&lt;/ref&gt;

A persistent dry cough is a relatively common adverse effect believed to be associated with the increases in [[bradykinin]] levels produced by ACE inhibitors, although the role of bradykinin in producing these symptoms remains disputed by some authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Okumura2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=11265121 |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/yakushi/121/3/253/_pdf |title=Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE）阻害薬誘発性の咳嗽発現とACE 遺伝子型，血漿中ブラジキニン，サブスタンスP 及びACE 阻害薬濃度との関連性 |trans_title=No Relation between Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor-Induced Cough and ACE Gene Polymorphism, Plasma Bradykinin, Substance P and ACE Inhibitor Concentration in Japanese Patients |language=Japanese |month=March |year=2001 |first1=Hiromi |last1=Okumura |first2=Eriko |last2=Nishimura |first3=Satoru |last3=Kariya |first4=Michiteru |last4=Ohtani |first5=Katsuyoshi |last5=Uchino |first6=Tohru |last6=Fukatsu |first7=Jun |last7=Odanaka |first8=Tsuyoshi |last8=Takahashi |first9=Kiyoshi |last9=Watanabe |volume=121 |issue=3 |pages=253–7 |journal=Yakugaku Zasshi |doi=10.1248/yakushi.121.253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients who experience this cough are often switched to [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]s.

Rash and taste disturbances, infrequent with most ACE inhibitors, are more prevalent in [[captopril]] and is attributed to its sulfhydryl moiety. This has led to decreased use of captopril in clinical setting, although it is still used in [[scintigraphy]] of the kidney.

Renal impairment is a significant adverse effect of all ACE inhibitors, but the reason is still unknown. Some suggest it is associated with their effect on angiotensin II-mediated [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] functions, such as renal blood flow. Renal blood flow may be affected by angiotensin II because it vasoconstricts the [[efferent arteriole]]s of the [[glomerulus|glomeruli]] of the kidney, thereby increasing [[glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR). Hence, by reducing angiotensin II levels, ACE inhibitors may reduce GFR, a marker of [[renal function]]. To be specific, they can induce or exacerbate renal impairment in patients with [[renal artery stenosis]]. This is especially a problem if the patient is concomitantly taking an [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAID]] and a [[diuretic]]. When the three drugs are taken together, there is  a very high risk of developing renal failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas2000&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=10772593 |year=2000 |author1=Thomas |title=Diuretics, ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs--the triple whammy. |volume=172 |issue=4 |pages=184–5 |journal=The Medical journal of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACE inhibitors may cause [[hyperkalemia]].  Suppression of angiotensin II leads to a decrease in aldosterone levels.  Since aldosterone is responsible for increasing the excretion of potassium, ACE inhibitors ultimately cause retention of potassium.

A severe allergic reaction that rarely can affect the bowel wall and secondarily cause abdominal pain can occur.  This &quot;anaphylactic&quot; reaction is very rare as well.

Some patients develop [[angioedema]] due to increased bradykinin levels. There appears to be a genetic predisposition toward this adverse effect in patients who degrade bradykinin more slowly than average.&lt;ref name=&quot;Molinaro2002&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=12235256 |year=2002 |author1=Molinaro |first2=M |first3=M |first4=Y |first5=N |first6=A |first7=A |title=Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema is characterized by a slower degradation of des-arginine(9)-bradykinin. |volume=303 |issue=1 |pages=232–7 |doi=10.1124/jpet.102.038067 |journal=The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics |last2=Cugno |last3=Perez |last4=Lepage |last5=Gervais |last6=Agostoni |last7=Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pregnancy|pregnant women]], ACE inhibitors taken during the [[first trimester]] have been reported to cause major [[congenital malformations]], [[stillbirth]]s, and [[neonatal death]]s.  Commonly reported fetal abnormalities include [[hypotension]], [[renal dysplasia]], anuria/oliguria, [[oligohydramnios]], [[intrauterine growth retardation]], [[pulmonary hypoplasia]], [[patent ductus arteriosus]], and incomplete ossification of the skull.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9520613&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

==Contraindications and precautions==
The ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with:

* Previous [[angioedema]] associated with ACE inhibitor therapy
* [[Renal artery stenosis]] (bilateral, or unilateral with a solitary functioning kidney)
* Hypersensitivity to ACE inhibitors

ACE inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with:

* Impaired renal function
* [[Aortic valve stenosis]] or cardiac outflow obstruction
* [[Hypovolemia]] or [[dehydration]]
* [[Hemodialysis]] with high-flux polyacrylonitrile membranes

ACE inhibitors are [[Australian Drug Evaluation Committee|ADEC]] [[pregnancy category]] D, and should be avoided in women who are likely to become pregnant.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMH2006&quot; /&gt; In the U.S., ACE inhibitors are required to be labeled with a &quot;[[Black box warning|black box]]&quot; warning concerning the risk of birth defects when taken during the second and third trimester. Their use in the first trimester is also associated with a risk of major [[congenital malformation]]s, particularly affecting the [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]] and [[central nervous system]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=16760444 |year=2006 |author1=Cooper |first2=S |first3=PG |first4=JA |first5=S |first6=PS |first7=K |first8=WA |title=Major congenital malformations after first-trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors. |volume=354 |issue=23 |pages=2443–51 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa055202 |journal=The New England journal of medicine |last2=Hernandez-Diaz |last3=Arbogast |last4=Dudley |last5=Dyer |last6=Gideon |last7=Hall |last8=Ray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potassium supplementation should be used with caution and under medical supervision owing to the [[hyperkalemia|hyperkalemic]] effect of ACE inhibitors.

==Examples==
ACE inhibitors can be divided into three groups based on their molecular structure:

===Sulfhydryl-containing agents===
* [[Captopril]] (trade name Capoten), the first ACE inhibitor
* [[Zofenopril]]

===Dicarboxylate-containing agents===
This is the largest group, including:

* [[Enalapril]] (Vasotec/Renitec)
* [[Ramipril]] (Altace/Tritace/Ramace/Ramiwin)
* [[Quinapril]] (Accupril)
* [[Perindopril]] (Coversyl/Aceon)
* [[Lisinopril]] (Listril/Lopril/Novatec/Prinivil/Zestril)
* [[Benazepril]] (Lotensin)
* [[Imidapril]]  (Tanatril)
* [[Zofenopril]] (Zofecard)

===Phosphonate-containing agents===
* [[Fosinopril]] (Monopril) is the only member of this group

===Naturally occurring===
* Caso[[kinin]]s and lactokinins, breakdown products of [[casein]] and [[whey]], occur naturally after ingestion of [[milk]] products, especially [[cultured milk]]. Their role in blood pressure control is uncertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;FitzGerald2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=15051858 |year=2004 |author1=Fitzgerald |first2=BA |first3=DJ |title=Hypotensive peptides from milk proteins. |volume=134 |issue=4 |pages=980S–8S |journal=The Journal of nutrition |last2=Murray |last3=Walsh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[lactotripeptides]] Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro produced by the [[probiotic]] ''[[Lactobacillus helveticus]]'' or derived from [[casein]] have been shown to have ACE-inhibiting and antihypertensive functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=16093403 |year=2005 |author1=Aihara |first2=O |first3=H |first4=R |first5=Y |title=Effect of powdered fermented milk with Lactobacillus helveticus on subjects with high-normal blood pressure or mild hypertension. |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=257–65 |journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition |last2=Kajimoto |last3=Hirata |last4=Takahashi |last5=Nakamura}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&quot;/&gt;

==Comparative information==
All ACE inhibitors have similar antihypertensive efficacy when equivalent doses are administered. The main point-of-difference lies with [[captopril]], the first ACE inhibitor, which has a shorter duration of action and increased incidence of certain adverse effects.

Certain agents in the ACE inhibitor class have been proven, in large clinical studies, to reduce mortality in patients after [[myocardial infarction]], and prevent development of heart failure. The ACE inhibitor most prominently recognized for these qualities is [[ramipril]] (Altace). Because ramipril has been shown to reduce mortality rates even among patient groups not suffering from hypertension, some (mostly [[Pharmaceutical marketing#Pharmaceutical representatives|drug-company representatives]])  believe ramipril's benefits may extend beyond those of the general abilities it holds in common with other members of the ACE inhibitor class.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

===ACEI equivalents===
The ACE inhibitors have different strengths with different starting dosages. Dosage should be adjusted according to the clinical response.

==Angiotensin II receptor antagonists==
ACE inhibitors possess many common characteristics with another class of cardiovascular drugs, [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]s, which are often used when patients are intolerant of the adverse effects produced by ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors do not completely prevent the formation of angiotensin II, as there are other conversion pathways, so angiotensin II receptor antagonists may be useful because they act to prevent the action of angiotensin II at the AT&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor, leaving AT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor unblocked; the latter may have consequences needing further study.

===Use in combination===
The combination therapy of angiotensin II receptor antagonists with ACE inhibitors may be superior to either agent alone.  This combination may increase levels of bradykinin while blocking the generation of angiotensin II and its activity at the AT&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor.  This 'dual blockade' may be more effective than using an ACE inhibitor alone, because angiotensin II can be generated via non-ACE-dependent pathways.  Preliminary studies suggest this combination of pharmacologic agents may be advantageous in the treatment of [[essential hypertension]], chronic [[heart failure]],&lt;ref name=&quot;dimopoulos&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dimopoulos|first=K|coauthors=Salukhe, Coats, Mayet, Piepoli, Francis|title=Meta-analyses of mortality and morbidity effects of an angiotensin receptor blocker in patients with chronic heart failure already receiving an ACE inhibitor (alone or with a beta-blocker).|journal=Int J Cardiol|year=2004|volume=92|issue=2|pages=105–111|pmid=14975535|accessdate=12 November 2010|doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2003.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[nephropathy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Luno2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=15853685 |year=2005 |author1=Luno |first2=M |first3=SG |title=The reno-protective effect of the dual blockade of the renin angiotensin system (RAS). |volume=11 |issue=10 |pages=1291–300 |journal=Current pharmaceutical design |doi=10.2174/1381612053507413 |last2=Praga |last3=De Vinuesa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vandeWal2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=16105846 |year=2005 |author1=Van De Wal |first2=DJ |first3=WH |first4=AA |title=Addition of an angiotensin receptor blocker to full-dose ACE-inhibition: controversial or common sense? |volume=26 |issue=22 |pages=2361–7 |doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehi454 |journal=European heart journal |last2=Van Veldhuisen |last3=Van Gilst |last4=Voors}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more studies are needed to confirm these highly preliminary results.

==History==
{{Main|ACE inhibitors drug design}}

The first step in the development of ACE inhibitors was the discovery of ACE in [[blood plasma|plasma]]  by [[Leonard T. Skeggs]] and his colleagues in 1956. Brazilian scientist Sergio Ferreira reported a bradykinin-potentiating factor (BPF) present in the venom of ''[[Bothrops jararaca]]'', a South American pit viper, in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14302350&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=FERREIRA SH |title=A BRADYKININ-POTENTIATING FACTOR (BPF) PRESENT IN THE VENOM OF BOTHROPS JARARCA |journal=Br J Pharmacol Chemother |volume=24 |issue= |pages=163–9 |year=1965 |month=February |pmid=14302350 |pmc=1704050 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferreira then went to [[John Vane]]'s laboratory as a postdoctoral with his already-isolated BPF. The conversion of the inactive angiotensin I to the potent angiotensin II was thought to take place in the plasma. However, in 1967, [[Kevin K. F. Ng]] and [[John R. Vane]] showed plasma ACE is too slow to account for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II ''in vivo''. Subsequent investigation showed rapid conversion occurs during its passage through the pulmonary circulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/216762a0 |title=Conversion of Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II |year=1967 |last1=Ng |first1=K. K. F. |first2=J. R. |journal=Nature |volume=216 |pages=762 |pmid=4294626 |issue=5117 |last2=Vane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bradykinin]] is rapidly inactivated in the circulating blood, and it disappears completely in a single pass through the pulmonary circulation. Angiotensin I also disappears in the pulmonary circulation due to its conversion to angiotensin II.  Furthermore, angiotensin II passes through the lungs without any loss. The inactivation of bradykinin and the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the lungs was thought to be caused by the same enzyme.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/218144a0 |title=Fate of Angiotensin I in the Circulation |year=1968 |last1=Ng |first1=K. K. F. |first2=J. R. |journal=Nature |volume=218 |pages=144 |pmid=4296306 |issue=5137 |last2=Vane}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Ng and Vane, using BPF provided by [[Sérgio Henrique Ferreira]], showed the conversion is inhibited during its passage through the pulmonary circulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin3&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/2251142b0 | pmid=4313869 |title=Some Properties of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme in the Lung in vivo |year=1970 |last1=Ng |first1=K. K. F. |first2=J. R. |journal=Nature |volume=225|issue=5238 |pages=1142 |last2=Vane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BPFs are members of a family of peptides whose potentiating action is linked to inhibition of  bradykinin by ACE. Molecular analysis of BPF yielded a nonapeptide BPF [[teprotide]] (SQ 20,881), which showed the greatest ACE inhibition potency and hypotensive effect ''in vivo''.  Teprotide had limited clinical value due to its peptide nature and lack of activity when given orally.  In the early 1970s, knowledge of the structure-activity relationship required for inhibition of ACE was growing.  [[David Cushman]], [[Miguel Ondetti]] and colleagues used peptide analogues to study the structure of ACE, using carboxypeptidase A as a model.  Their discoveries led to the development of captopril, the first orally-active ACE inhibitor, in 1975.

Captopril was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 1981.  The first nonsulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor, enalapril, was marketed two years later.  At least twelve other ACE inhibitors have since been marketed.

In 1991, Japanese scientists created the first milk-based ACE inhibitor, in the form of a fermented milk drink, using specific cultures to liberate the [[tripeptide]] [[isoleucine]]-[[proline]]-proline (IPP) from the dairy protein. [[Valine]]-proline-proline (VPP) is also liberated in this process—another milk tripeptide with a very similar chemical structure to IPP.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''antianginal''' is any [[Medication|drug]] used in the treatment of ''[[angina pectoris]]'', a symptom of [[coronary heart disease|ischaemic heart disease]].

==Examples==
Drugs used are [[nitrate]]s, [[beta blocker]]s, or [[calcium channel blocker]]s.

===Nitrates===
[[Nitrates]] cause [[vasodilation]]&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9875113&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pfister M, Seiler C, Fleisch M, Göbel H, Lüscher T, Meier B |title=Nitrate induced coronary vasodilatation: differential effects of sublingual application by capsule or spray |journal=Heart |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=365–9 |year=1998 |month=October |pmid=9875113 |pmc=1728824 |doi= |url=http://heart.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9875113}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the venous capacitance vessels by simulating the [[endothelium-derived relaxing factor]] (EDRF). Used to relieve both exertional and vasospastic angina by allowing venous pooling, reducing the pressure in the ventricles and so reducing wall tension and oxygen requirements in the heart. Short-acting nitrates are used to abort angina attacks that have occurred, while longer-acting nitrates are used in the prophylactic management of the condition.

Agents include [[nitroglycerin]] ([[glyceryl trinitrate]]) or [[pentaerythritol tetranitrate]].

===Beta blockers===
[[Beta blockers]] are used in the prophylaxis&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17998992&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Rourke ST |title=Antianginal actions of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists |journal=Am J Pharm Educ |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=95 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17998992 |pmc=2064893 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of exertional angina by reducing the work the heart is allowed to perform below the level that would provoke an angina attack. 

They cannot be used in [[vasospastic angina]] and can precipitate [[heart failure]].

Agents include either cardioselectives such as [[acebutolol]] or [[metoprolol]], or non-cardioselectives such as [[oxprenolol]] or [[sotalol]].

===Calcium channel blockers===
[[Calcium]] [[ion]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt;) antagonists ([[Calcium channel blocker]]s) are used in the treatment of both exertional and vasospastic angina. In vitro, they dilate the coronary and peripheral arteries and have negative inotropic and chronotropic effects - decreasing [[afterload]], improving myocardial efficiency, reducing [[heart rate]] and improving coronary blood flow.
''In vivo'', the vasodilation and [[hypotension]] trigger the [[baroreceptor]] reflex. Therefore the net effect is the interplay of direct and reflex actions. 

* Class I agents have the most potent negative inotropic effect and may cause heart failure.
* Class II agents do not depress conduction or contractility.
* Class III agent has negligible inotropic effect and causes almost no reflex [[tachycardia]].

Examples include Class I agents (''e.g.'', [[verapamil]]), Class II agents (''e.g.'', [[amlodipine]], [[nifedipine]]), or the Class III agent [[diltiazem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System''' is used for the [[taxonomic classification|classification]] of [[Medication|drug]]s. It is controlled by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology (WHOCC), and was first published in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_methodology/history/|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|title=ATC/DDD Methodology: History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their [[medicine|therapeutic]] and [[chemical classification|chemical characteristics]]. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: [[acetylsalicylic acid]] (aspirin), for example, has {{ATC|A01|AD05}} as a drug for local [[mouth|oral]] treatment, {{ATC|B01|AC06}} as a [[platelet inhibitor]], and {{ATC|N02|BA01}} as an [[analgesic]] and [[antipyretic]]. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.

== Classification ==
In this system, drugs are classified into groups at 5 different levels:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whocc.no/atc/structure_and_principles/|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|title=ATC: Structure and principles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First level ===
The first level of the code indicates the anatomical main group and consists of one letter. There are 14 main groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|title=ATC/DDD Index}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second level ===
The second level of the code indicates the therapeutic main group and consists of two digits.

''Example'': [[ATC code C03|C'''03''']] [[Diuretic]]s

=== Third level ===
The third level of the code indicates the therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup and consists of one letter.

''Example'': C03'''C''' High-ceiling diuretics

=== Fourth level ===
The fourth level of the code indicates the chemical/therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup and consists of one letter.

''Example'': C03C'''A''' [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|Sulfonamide]]s

=== Fifth level ===
The fifth level of the code indicates the chemical substance and consists of two digits.

''Example'': C03CA'''01''' [[Furosemide]]

=== ATCvet ===
The ''Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System for veterinary medicinal products'' (ATCvet) is used to classify [[veterinary]] drugs. ATCvet codes can be created by placing the letter Q in front of the ATC code of most human medications. For example, furosemide for veterinary use has the code '''Q'''C03CA01.

Some codes are used exclusively for veterinary drugs, like ''[[ATCvet code QI|QI]] Immunologicals'', ''[[ATCvet code QJ51|QJ51]] Antibacterials for intramammary use'' or ''QN05AX90 [[amperozide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whocc.no/atcvet/atcvet_classification_system/general_principles/|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|title=ATCvet classification system: General principles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defined daily dose ==
{{main|Defined daily dose}}
The ATC system also includes defined daily doses (DDDs) for many drugs. This is a measurement of drug consumption based on the usual daily dose for a given drug. According to the definition, &quot;[t]he DDD is the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whocc.no/ddd/definition_and_general_considera/|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|title=DDD: Definition and general considerations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National adaptions==
National issues of the ATC classification, such as the [[Germany|German]] ''Anatomisch-therapeutisch-chemische Klassifikation mit Tagesdosen'', may include additional codes and DDDs not present in the WHO version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dimdi.de/static/de/klassi/atcddd/atc-gesetze.htm|publisher=Deutsches Institut für Medizinische Dokumentation und Information|title=ATC-Klassifikation mit DDD: Gesetzlicher Hintergrund|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Air conditioning unit-en.svg|thumb|220px|A typical home air conditioning unit.]]

An '''air conditioner''' (often referred to as '''AC''') is a [[home appliance]], [[system]], or [[mechanism (technology)|mechanism]] designed to dehumidify and extract [[heat]] from an area. The cooling is done using a simple [[refrigeration cycle]]. In [[construction]], a complete system of heating, [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and air conditioning is referred to as &quot;[[HVAC]]&quot;. Its purpose, in a [[building]] or an [[automobile]], is to provide comfort during either hot or cold [[weather]].

== History ==
{{Main|Air conditioning#History}}

In 1758, [[Benjamin Franklin]] and John Hadley, professor of chemistry at Cambridge University, conducted an experiment to explore the principle of evaporation as a means to rapidly cool an object. Franklin and Hadley confirmed that evaporation of highly volatile liquids such as alcohol and ether could be used to drive down the temperature of an object past the freezing point of water. They conducted their experiment with the bulb of a mercury [[thermometer]] as their object and with a bellows used to &quot;quicken&quot; the evaporation; they lowered the temperature of the thermometer bulb to {{convert|7|F|0|abbr=on}} while the ambient temperature was {{convert|65|F|0|abbr=on}}. Franklin noted that soon after they passed the freezing point of water (32 °F) a thin film of ice formed on the surface of the thermometer's bulb and that the ice mass was about a quarter inch thick when they stopped the experiment upon reaching {{convert|7|F|0|abbr=on}}. Franklin concluded, &quot;From this experiment, one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/letter1.htm Cooling by Evaporation (Letter to John Lining)]. Benjamin Franklin, London, June 17, 1758.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1820, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] scientist and [[inventor]] [[Michael Faraday]] discovered that compressing and liquefying [[ammonia]] could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed to evaporate. In 1842, Florida physician [[John Gorrie]] used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in [[Apalachicola, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/mvigeant/therm_1/AC_final/bg.htm History of Air Conditioning] Source: Jones Jr., Malcolm. &quot;Air Conditioning&quot;. ''Newsweek''. Winter 1997 v130 n24-A p42(2). Retrieved 1 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He hoped eventually to use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings. He even envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities. Though his prototype leaked and performed irregularly, Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his ice-making machine. His hopes for its success vanished soon afterward when his chief financial backer died; Gorrie did not get the money he needed to develop the machine. According to his biographer [[Vivian M. Sherlock]], he blamed the &quot;Ice King&quot;, [[Frederic Tudor]], for his failure, suspecting that Tudor had launched a [[smear campaign]] against his invention. Dr. Gorrie died impoverished in 1855 and the idea of air conditioning faded away for 50 years.

Early commercial applications of air conditioning were manufactured to cool air for industrial processing rather than personal comfort. In 1902 the first modern electrical air conditioning was [[invention|invented]] by [[Willis Carrier]] in Syracuse, New York. Designed to improve manufacturing process control in a printing plant, his invention controlled not only [[temperature]] but also [[humidity]]. The low heat and humidity were to help maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later Carrier's technology was applied to increase productivity in the workplace, and [[Carrier Corporation|The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America]] was formed to meet rising demand. Over time air conditioning came to be used to improve comfort in homes and [[automobile]]s. Residential sales expanded dramatically in the 1950s.

In 1906, [[Stuart W. Cramer]] of [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], was exploring ways to add moisture to the air in his textile mill. Cramer coined the term &quot;air conditioning&quot;, using it in a patent claim he filed that year as an analogue to &quot;water conditioning&quot;, then a well-known process for making textiles easier to process. He combined moisture with ventilation to &quot;condition&quot; and change the air in the factories, controlling the humidity so necessary in textile plants. Willis Carrier adopted the term and incorporated it into the name of his company. This evaporation of water in air, to provide a cooling effect, is now known as [[evaporative cooling]].

The first air conditioners and [[refrigerator]]s employed toxic or flammable gases like [[ammonia]], [[methyl chloride]] and [[propane]], which could result in fatal accidents when they leaked. [[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]] created the first [[chlorofluorocarbon]] gas, [[Freon]], in 1928. The refrigerant was much safer for humans but was later claimed to be harmful to the atmosphere's [[ozone layer]]. ''Freon'' is a [[trademark]] name of [[DuPont]] for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrogenated CFC ([[HCFC]]), or [[hydrofluorocarbon]] (HFC) refrigerant, the name of each including a number indicating molecular composition (R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as R-22. It is to be phased out for use in new equipment by 2010 and completely discontinued by 2020. R-12 was the most common blend used in automobiles in the United States until 1994 when most changed to R-134A. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the United States, the only source for purchase being the cleaned and purified gas recovered from other air conditioner systems. Several non-ozone depleting refrigerants have been developed as alternatives, including [[R-410A]], known by the brand name ''Puron''. The most common ozone-depleting refrigerants are R-22, R-11 and R-123.

Innovation in air conditioning technologies continues, with much recent emphasis placed on energy efficiency and improving [[indoor air quality]]. As an alternative to conventional refrigerants, natural alternatives like CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[R-744]]) have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r744.com/knowledge/papers_result_free.php?page_no=0&amp;txt_key_free=air%20conditioning&amp;sortby=year%20DESC The current status in Air Conditioning – papers &amp; presentations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in use of air conditioning over the years has been implicated as a contributor to increasing [[obesity]], because [[appetite]] naturally decreases in uncomfortably high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9416-aircon-and-lack-of-sleep-promote-obesity.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v30/n11/full/0803326a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refrigeration cycle===
[[File:Heatpump.svg|thumb|200px|A simple stylized diagram of the refrigeration cycle: 1)&amp;nbsp;[[condensing coil]], 2)&amp;nbsp;[[thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]], 3)&amp;nbsp;[[evaporator coil]], 4)&amp;nbsp;[[Gas compressor|compressor]].]]
[[File:Capilliary metering device.JPG|thumb|Capillary expansion valve connection to evaporator inlet. Notice [[frost]] formation.]]
In the refrigeration cycle, a [[heat pump]] transfers heat from a lower-[[temperature]] heat source into a higher-temperature [[heat sink]]. Heat would naturally flow in the opposite direction. This is the most common type of air conditioning. A [[refrigerator]] works in much the same way, as it pumps the heat out of the interior and into the room in which it stands.

This cycle takes advantage of the way [[phase change]]s work, where [[latent heat]] is released at a constant temperature during a [[liquid]]/[[gas]] phase change, and where varying the [[pressure]] of a pure substance also varies its [[condensation]]/[[boiling point]].

The most common refrigeration cycle uses an [[electric motor]] to drive a [[gas compressor|compressor]]. In an automobile, the compressor is driven by a [[belt (mechanical)|belt]] over a [[pulley]], the belt being driven by the engine's [[crankshaft]] (similar to the driving of the pulleys for the [[alternator]], [[power steering]], etc.). Whether in a car or building, both use electric fan motors for air circulation. Since [[evaporation]] occurs when heat is absorbed, and condensation occurs when heat is released, air conditioners use a compressor to cause [[pressure]] changes between two compartments, and actively condense and pump a [[refrigerant]] around. A refrigerant is pumped into the [[evaporator]] coil, located in the compartment to be cooled, where the low pressure causes the refrigerant to evaporate into a vapor, taking heat with it. At the opposite side of the cycle is the [[heat exchanger|condenser]], which is located outside of the cooled compartment, where the refrigerant vapor is compressed and forced through another heat exchange coil, condensing the refrigerant into a liquid, thus rejecting the heat previously absorbed from the cooled space.

By placing the condenser (where the heat is rejected) inside a compartment, and the evaporator (which absorbs heat) in the ambient environment (such as outside), or merely running a normal air conditioner's refrigerant in the opposite direction, the overall effect is the opposite, and the compartment is heated. This is usually called a [[heat pump]], and is capable of heating a home to comfortable temperatures (25&amp;nbsp;°C; 70&amp;nbsp;°F), even when the outside air is below the freezing point of water (0&amp;nbsp;°C; 32&amp;nbsp;°F).

Cylinder unloaders are a method of load control used mainly in commercial air conditioning systems. On a semi-[[hermetic seal|hermetic]] (or open) compressor, the heads can be fitted with unloaders which remove a portion of the load from the compressor so that it can run better when full cooling is not needed. Unloaders can be electrical or mechanical.

====Humidity====
Air conditioning equipment usually reduces the [[humidity]] of the air processed by the system. The relatively cold (below the [[dew point]]) evaporator coil condenses [[water vapor]] from the processed air, much as a cold drink will condense water on the outside of a glass. The water is drained, removing water vapor from the cooled space and thereby lowering its [[relative humidity]]. Since humans [[Perspiration|perspire]] to provide natural cooling by the evaporation of perspiration from the skin, drier air (up to a point) improves the comfort provided. The comfort air conditioner{{Fact|date=May 2011}} is designed to create a 40% to 60% relative humidity in the occupied space. In food retail establishments, large, open chiller cabinets act as highly effective [[dehumidifier]]s.

Some air conditioning units dry the air without cooling it. These work like a normal air conditioner, except that a [[heat exchanger]] is placed between the intake and exhaust. In combination with [[convection]] [[fan (mechanical)|fan]]s, they achieve a similar level of comfort as an [[air cooler]] in humid [[tropical climate]]s, but only consume about one-third the energy. They are also preferred by those who find the draft created by air coolers uncomfortable.

====Refrigerants====
{{Main|Refrigerant}}
[[File:Embraco compressor.jpg|thumb|A modern [[R-134a]] hermetic refrigeration [[gas compressor|compressor]]]]
&quot;[[Freon]]&quot; is a [[trade name]] for a family of [[haloalkane]] refrigerants manufactured by [[DuPont]] and other companies. These refrigerants were commonly used due to their superior stability and safety properties. However, these [[Chlorofluorocarbon|chlorine-bearing refrigerant]]s reach the [[Earth's atmosphere|upper atmosphere]] when they escape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/chemfact/f_freon.txt CHEMICALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT: FREON 113]&lt;/ref&gt; Once the refrigerant reaches the [[stratosphere]], [[ultraviolet|UV radiation]] from the [[Sun]] [[Homolysis|cleaves]] the chlorine-[[carbon]] [[Chemical bond|bond]], yielding a chlorine [[radical (chemistry)|radical]]. These chlorine atoms [[catalyst|catalyze]] the breakdown of [[ozone]] into [[diatomic]] [[oxygen]], depleting the [[ozone layer]] that shields the Earth's surface from strong UV radiation. Each chlorine radical remains active as a catalyst unless it binds with another chlorine radical, forming a stable [[molecule]] and breaking the [[chain reaction]]. The use of CFC as a refrigerant was once common, being used in the refrigerants [[Trichlorofluoromethane|R-11]] and [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]]. In most countries the manufacture and use of CFCs has been banned or severely restricted due to concerns about ozone depletion.&lt;ref name=&quot;sciencedaily&quot;&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/07/030730080139.htm CFC worldwide ban]&lt;/ref&gt; In light of these environmental concerns, beginning on November 14, 1994, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has restricted the sale, possession and use of refrigerant to only licensed technicians, per Rules 608 and 609 of the EPA rules and regulations;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ozone/title6/608/608fact.html EPA Rules &amp; Regulations restricting refrigerant]&lt;/ref&gt; failure to comply may result in criminal and civil sanctions. Newer and more environmentally safe refrigerants such as [[HCFC]]s ([[Chlorodifluoromethane|R-22]], used in most homes today) and [[hydrofluorocarbon|HFC]]s ([[R-134a]], used in most cars) have replaced most CFC use. HCFCs, in turn, are being phased out under the [[Montreal Protocol]] and replaced by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) such as [[R-410A]], which lack chlorine. Carbon dioxide (R-744) is being rapidly adopted as a refrigerant in Europe and Japan. R-744 is an effective refrigerant with a [[global warming potential]] of 1. It must use higher compression to produce an equivalent cooling effect.

=== Window and through-wall units ===
Room air conditioners come in two forms: unitary and packaged terminal [[Packaged terminal air conditioner|PTAC]] systems. Unitary systems, the common one room air conditioners, sit in a window or wall opening, with interior controls. Interior air is cooled as a fan blows it over the evaporator. On the exterior the air is heated as a second fan blows it over the condenser. In this process, heat is drawn from the room and discharged to the environment. A large house or building may have several such units, permitting each room be cooled separately. PTAC systems are also known as wall split air conditioning systems or ductless systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://airconditioningexplained.com/?p=283 Air Conditioning Explained], retrieved 19 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These PTAC systems which are frequently used in hotels have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with tubing passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump. While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when cooling many rooms it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.

=== Evaporative coolers ===

{{Main|Evaporative cooler}}
In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving comfort during hot weather. This type of cooler is the dominant cooler used in [[Iran]], which has the largest number of these units of any country in the world, causing some to refer to these units as &quot;[[Culture of Iran|Persian]] coolers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/mvigeant/therm_1/AC_final/bg.htm|title=History of Air Conditioning|accessdate=2007-09-15|first=Derek|last=Dahlgren|coauthors=Jewell, Amy; Li, Ruth; [[et al.]]|publisher=[[Bucknell University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An evaporative cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large [[sponge (tool)|sponge]] soaked with water. The [[sensible heat]] of the incoming air, as measured by a [[Dry-bulb temperature|dry bulb thermometer]], is reduced. The [[total heat]] (sensible heat plus latent heat) of the entering air is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite comfortable; evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike air conditioners, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window.&lt;ref&gt;

These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.

An early type of cooler, using [[ice]] for a further effect, was [[patent]]ed by [[John Gorrie]] of [[Apalachicola, Florida]] in 1842. He used the device to cool the patients in his [[malaria]] [[hospital]].

=== Absorptive chillers ===
{{Main|Absorption refrigerator}}

=== Portable air conditioners ===
{{Primary sources|date=March 2010}}
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}
Portable air conditioners are movable units that can be used to cool a specific region of building in a modular fashion, not requiring permanent installation. Most portable air conditioners are refrigeration based rather than evaporative,{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} and it is this type that is described in this section. Portable air conditioner units are often rented in emergency situations such as power failures at warehouses or data centers.

All refrigerated type portable air conditioners require exhaust hoses for venting. Through this process of air intake, cooling and venting, air is continually cycled through the unit until the room reaches the desired temperature setting. Also, the refrigerant works to not only cool the air but also dehumidify air in the room, owing to the temperature decrease in the air which results in the saturation of the water content of the air, causing condensation when the air is returned to the room. The air will therefore be left without this ional water content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics|author=Winnick, J}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water loss rate is sufficiently high to require collection or drainage. The exact conditions for the condensation of the water from the air can be estimated using a [[Psychrometric chart]] for air at room pressure.

==== Single hosed units ====
A single hosed unit has one hose that runs from the back of the portable air conditioner to the vent kit where hot air can be released. A typical single hosed portable air conditioner can cool a room that is {{convert|475|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} or smaller and has at most a cooling power of 12,000 BTUs. However, single hosed units cool a room less effectively than dual hosed as the air expelled from the room through the single hose creates negative pressure inside the room. Because of this, air (potentially warm air) from neighboring rooms is pulled into the room with the cooling unit to compensate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.experts123.com/q/what-is-the-difference-between-a-single-hose-design-and-a-dual-hose-design.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dual hosed units ====
Dual hosed units are typically used in larger rooms. One hose is used as the exhaust hose to vent hot air and the other as the intake hose to draw in additional air (usually from the outside). These units generally have a cooler power of 12,000-14,000 BTUs and cool rooms that are around {{convert|500|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. The reason an intake hose is needed to draw in extra air is because with higher BTU units, air is cycled in large amounts and hot air is expelled at a faster rate. This would create negative air pressure in the room, so the intake hose eliminates reduction of room air pressure which would draw outside air into the room.{{Clarify| The intake hose draws in additional air from outside thus eliminating the negative air pressure which would draw outside air in! This make no sense. |date=June 2010}}

==== Split units ====
Portable units are also available in split configuration, often with the compressor and evaporator located in a separate external package and the two units connected via two detachable refrigerant pipes, as is the case with fixed split systems. Split portable units are superior to both single and dual hosed mono-portable units in that interior noise and size of the internal unit can be greatly reduced due to the external location of the compressor, and the water collected can be pumped to the outdoor unit using a pump, avoiding the need to drain water from the indoor unit periodically when running in cooling mode..

A drawback of split portable units compared with mono-portables is that a surface exterior to the building, such as a balcony must be provided for the external compressor unit to be located.

Unlike window ACs the split AC does not have an option of exchange of indoor and outdoor air.

==== Heat and cool units ====
Some portable air conditioner units are also able to provide heat by reversing the cooling process so that cool air is collected from a room and warm air is released. These units are not meant to replace actual heaters though and should not be used to cool rooms lower than {{convert|50|F|0|abbr=on}}.

=== Central air conditioning ===
Central air conditioning, commonly referred to as ''central air'' ([[United States|U.S.]]) or ''air-con'' ([[United Kingdom|UK]]), is an air conditioning system that uses ducts to distribute cooled and/or dehumidified air to more than one room, or uses pipes to distribute chilled water to heat exchangers in more than one room, and which is not plugged into a standard [[electrical outlet]].

With a typical ''split system'', the condenser and compressor are located in an outdoor unit; the evaporator is mounted in the [[air handler]] unit. With a ''package system'', all components are located in a single outdoor unit that may be located on the ground or [[roof]].

Central air conditioning performs like a regular air conditioner but has several added benefits:

* When the air handling unit turns on, room air is drawn in from various parts of the building through return-air ducts. This air is pulled through a [[filter (air)|filter]] where airborne particles such as [[dust]] and [[Lint (material)|lint]] are removed. Sophisticated filters may remove microscopic [[pollutants]] as well. The filtered air is routed to air supply ductwork that carries it back to rooms. Whenever the air conditioner is running, this cycle repeats continually.

* Because the condenser unit (with its fan and the compressor) is located outside the home, it offers a lower level of indoor [[noise]] than a free-standing air conditioning unit.

==== Mini (small) duct, high velocity ====
A central air conditioning system using high velocity air forced through small ducts (also called mini-ducts), typically round, flexible hoses about 2&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter. Using the principle of aspiration, the higher velocity air mixes more effectively with the room air, eliminating temperature discrepancies and drafts. A high velocity system often consumes more electricity to pump around air, and can be louder than a conventional system if sound attenuators are not used, though they come standard on most, if not all, systems.

The smaller, flexible tubing used for a mini-duct system allows it to be more easily installed in historic buildings, and structures with solid walls, such as [[log home]]s. These small ducts are typically longer contiguous pieces, and therefore less prone to leakage. Another added benefit of this type of ducting is the prevention of foreign particle buildup within the ducts, due to a combination of the higher velocity air, as well as the lack of hard corners.

==== Passive ground source-based cooling ====
If underground conditions are suitable, then by far the most energy-efficient way to chill air, is to pump up the coldness of ground water or from underground soil or rock formations, and use that coldness directly (without a [[heat pump]] compressor) to chill indoor air. Unless next to open water, they require a high initial investment: drilling deep holes and fitting them with pipes or a filter and pump. But after that, such systems consume five to twenty times less energy then heat pump-based systems. These systems have the disadvantage that they can not chill below or even near the temperature of the deeper underground, so they only work good if winters or nearby mountains cool groundwater below roughly 16 Celsius (60 Fahrenheit). Also, in the longer run such systems have a tendency to 'deplete' underground coldness, which makes them less efficient. This can be fixed in the winter months, by collecting winter coldness from the air through a roof top [[heat exchanger]] and pumping it into the underground cold-source. Unfortunately, such systems are as yet hardly developed. One factor is that some of the world's leading manufacturers of air conditioners also manufacture the boilers and turbines for large electricity plants. Therefore they have little incentive to reduce electricity use of air conditioners. For large buildings, ground source-coldness is successfully used to reduce energy consumption of central air conditioner systems, often in combination with heat pump based heating systems.

== Thermostats ==
{{Main|Thermostat}}

Thermostats control the operation of HVAC systems, turning on the heating or cooling systems to bring the building to the set temperature. Typically the heating and cooling systems have separate control systems (even though they may share a thermostat) so that the temperature is only controlled &quot;one-way.&quot; That is, in cold weather, a building that is too hot will not be cooled by the thermostat. Thermostats may also be incorporated into facility [[energy management system]]s in which the power utility customer may control the overall energy expenditure. In addition, a growing number of power utilities have made available a device which, when professionally installed, will control or limit the power to an HVAC system during peak use times in order to avoid necessitating the use of [[rolling blackout]]s. The customer is given a [[Credit (finance)|credit]] of some sort in exchange, so it is often to the advantage of the consumer to buy the most efficient{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} thermostat possible.

== Equipment capacity ==

Air conditioner equipment power in the U.S. is often described in terms of &quot;[[Ton#Units of energy and power|tons of refrigeration]]&quot;. A &quot;ton of refrigeration&quot; is approximately equal to the cooling power of one [[short ton]] (2000 [[pound (mass)|pounds]] or 907 [[kilogram]]s) of ice melting in a 24-hour period. The value is defined as 12,000 [[BTU]] per hour, or 3517 [[watt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html|title=NIST Guide to the SI|accessdate=2007-05-18|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residential central air systems are usually from 1 to 5 tons (3 to 20 [[kilowatt]]s (kW)) in capacity.

The use of electric/compressive air conditioning puts a major demand on the [[electrical power grid]] in hot weather, when most units are operating under heavy load. In the aftermath of the [[2003 North America blackout]] locals were asked to keep their air conditioning off. During peak demand, additional [[power plant]]s must often be brought online, usually expensive [[peaker plant]]s. A 1995 [[meta-analysis]] of various utility studies concluded that the average air conditioner wasted 40% of the input energy. This energy is lost in the form of heat, which must be pumped out.

In an automobile, the A/C system will use around 5 [[horsepower]] (4&amp;nbsp;kW) of the engine's [[power (physics)|power]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

=== Seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) ===
{{Main|Seasonal energy efficiency ratio}}

For residential homes, some countries set minimum requirements for energy efficiency. In the United States, the efficiency of air conditioners is often (but not always) rated by the ''seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER)''. The higher the SEER rating, the more energy efficient is the air conditioner. The SEER rating is the BTU of cooling output during its normal annual usage divided by the total electric energy input in [[Kilowatt hour|watt hour]]s (W·h) during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/glossary/glossary_s.htm|title=Energy Glossary - S|accessdate=2006-07-02|work=Energy Glossary|publisher=[[Energy Information Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''SEER = BTU ÷ (W·h) '''
this can also be rewritten as:
: '''SEER = (BTU / h) ÷ W''', where &quot;W&quot; is the average electrical power in Watts, and (BTU/h) is the rated cooling power.

For example, a 5000 BTU/h air-conditioning unit, with a SEER of 10, would consume 5000/10 = 500 Watts of power on average. 

The electrical energy consumed per year can be calculated as the average power multiplied by the annual operating time:

: '''500 W × 1000 h = 500,000 W·h = 500 [[kWh]]'''

Assuming 1000 hours of operation during a typical cooling season (i.e., 8 hours per day for 125 days per year).

Another method that yields the same result, is to calculate the total annual cooling output:

: '''5000 BTU/h × 1000 h = 5,000,000 BTU'''

Then, for a SEER of 10, the annual electrical energy usage would be:

: '''5,000,000 BTU ÷ 10 = 500,000 W·h = 500 kWh'''

SEER is related to the [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) commonly used in [[thermodynamics]] and also to the [[Energy Efficiency Ratio]] (EER). The EER is the efficiency rating for the equipment at a particular pair of external and internal temperatures, while SEER is calculated over a whole range of external temperatures (i.e., the temperature distribution for the geographical location of the SEER test). SEER is unusual in that it is composed of an [[Imperial units|Imperial unit]] divided by an [[SI unit]]. The COP is a ratio with the same metric units of energy ([[joule]]s) in both the [[Fraction (mathematics)|numerator]] and [[Fraction (mathematics)|denominator]]. They cancel out, leaving a [[dimensionless quantity]]. Formulas for the approximate conversion between SEER and EER or COP are available from the [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071202130510/http://www.pge.com/docs/pdfs/biz/rebates/spc_contracts/2004_manuals_forms/spc_cooling_units.pdf SEER conversion formulas from Pacific Gas and Electric]&lt;/ref&gt;

: (1) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; '''SEER = EER ÷ 0.9'''

: (2) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; '''SEER = COP x 3.792'''

: (3) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; '''EER = COP x 3.413'''

From equation (2) above, a SEER of 13 is equivalent to a COP of 3.43, which means that 3.43 units of heat energy are pumped per unit of work energy.

Today, it is rare to see systems rated below SEER 9 in the United States, since older units are being replaced with higher-efficiency units. The United States now requires that residential systems manufactured in 2006 have a minimum SEER rating of 13 (although window-box systems are exempt from this law, so their SEER is still around 10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.energy.gov/news/3097.htm|title=Stronger Manufacturers' Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential Air Conditioners Go Into Effect Today|date=2006-01-23|publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]]|accessdate=2006-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial energy savings can be obtained from more efficient systems. For example by upgrading from SEER 9 to SEER 13, the power consumption is reduced by 30% (equal to 1 - 9/13). It is claimed that this can result in an energy savings valued at up to [[United States dollar|US$]]300 per year (depending on the usage rate and the cost of electricity). In many cases, the lifetime energy savings are likely to surpass the higher initial cost of a high-efficiency unit.

As an example, the annual cost of electric power consumed by a 72,000 [[BTU#Associated units|BTU/h]] air conditioning unit operating for 1000 hours per year with a SEER rating of 10 and a power cost of $0.08 per kilowatt hour (kW·h) may be calculated as follows:

: '''unit size, BTU/h × hours per year, h × power cost, $/kW·h ÷ (SEER, BTU/W·h × 1000 W/kW)'''

: (72,000 BTU/h) × (1000 h) × ($0.08/kW·h) ÷ [(10 BTU/W·h) × (1000 W/kW)] = $576.00 annual cost

A common misconception is that the SEER rating system also applies to heating systems. However, SEER ratings only apply to air conditioning.

Air conditioners (for cooling) and heat pumps (for heating) both work similarly in that heat is transferred or &quot;pumped&quot; from a cooler heat source to a warmer &quot;heat sink&quot;. Air conditioners and heat pumps usually operate most effectively at temperatures around 10 to 13 degrees [[Celsius]] (°C) (50 to 55 degrees [[Fahrenheit]] (°F)). A balance point is reached when the heat source temperature falls below about 4&amp;nbsp;°C (40&amp;nbsp;°F), and the system is not able to pull any more heat from the heat source (this point varies from heat pump to heat pump). Similarly, when the heat sink temperature rises to about 49&amp;nbsp;°C (120&amp;nbsp;°F), the system will operate less effectively, and will not be able to &quot;push&quot; out any more heat. [[Geothermal heat pump]]s do not have this problem of reaching a balance point because they use the ground as a heat source/heat sink and the ground's [[thermal inertia]] prevents it from becoming too cold or too warm when moving heat from or to it. The ground's temperature does not vary nearly as much over a year as that of the air above it.

== Insulation ==
An air-conditioning unit is only able to cool a building to a given temperature if the cooling capacity of the air-conditioning unit is greater than the rate of heat transfer from the building into the ambient environment.  

Additional cooling capacity can be supplied by increasing the size, and most likely the energy consumption, of the air-conditioning unit.  Restricting the rate of heat transfer is achieved by measures such as increasing [[Thermal insulation|structural insulation]] thickness's and improving air tightness.  Since the rate of heat transfer through the building fabric has such a direct influence on air-conditioning requirements the level of insulation in the building fabric should be considered when selecting an air-conditioning unit.

[[Pipe insulation]] is applied to air-conditioning distribution pipework.  This is partly to reduce the heat gain to the distribution pipework but also to prevent the formation of [[condensation]] on the pipe surface that would otherwise accelerate [[corrosion]].

== Home air conditioning systems around the world ==
Domestic air conditioning is most prevalent and ubiquitous in [[developed country|developed]] Asian and Middle Eastern nations and territories.&lt;!--no specific countries here please - there are too many to list; there is a constant warring over this --&gt; This especially applies to capitals and urbanized areas where most of the population lives in small [[high-rise]] flats. In these areas, with high summer temperatures and a somewhat high [[standard of living]], air conditioning is considered a necessity and not a [[luxury good|luxury]]. Japanese-made domestic air conditioners are usually window or split types, the latter being more modern and expensive. In Israel, virtually all residential systems are split types.

In the United States of America, home air conditioning is most prevalent in the [[Southern United States|South]]/[[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] and on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Central air systems are most common in the United States of America, and increasingly a standard design factor.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In [[Canada]], home air conditioning is less common than in East Asia and the United States, but it still quite prevalent. This is especially true of the [[Great Lakes]] regions of southern [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], where there are especially high humidity levels. While window and split units are common in these regions, central air systems are the most widespread in [[Western Canada]]. Most Western Canadian homes are built with already-compatible central forced air [[natural gas]] heating systems, making installing a central air system very simple. In [[Central Canada]] separate room-based [[hydroelectricity|hydro]] powered heating is more common, leading to the higher cost of retrofitting a central air system. The majority of modern urban high-rise condominiums built in Canadian cities have air conditioning systems. It is also offered as a relatively low-cost option on most new built homes. While energy is comparatively very cheap in Canada, the large size of the average Canadian home and cold winters make heating and cooling one of the largest household expenses. Canadian summers are uncomfortably hot, but rarely reach the dangerous temperatures experienced in the United States or Asia. As such, many Canadians, especially in older homes, simply choose to forgo air conditioning in lieu of simple fans and evaporative coolers. Cost of operation (as a factor of efficiency) of air conditioning is often considered an environmentally unfriendly mitigation to poor thermal design. There have been a number of advances in more environmentally friendly technologies, including insulation advancement, geothermal cooling, and the [[Enwave]] deep lake system in [[Toronto]] that cools a number of office towers using cold water from [[Lake Ontario]].

In Europe, home air conditioning is generally less common, in part due to higher energy costs and moderate summer temperatures. [[Southern Europe]]an countries such as [[Greece]], on the other hand, have seen a wide proliferation of home air-conditioning units in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.in.gr/news/article.asp?lngEntityID=819799&amp;lngDtrID=244|title=«Χρυσές» δουλειές για τις εταιρείες κλιματιστικών έφερε το κύμα καύσωνα|work=[[news in.gr]]|publisher=[[Lambrakis Press]]|location=[[Athens]]|date=2007-07-25|accessdate=2008-06-30|language=[[Greek language|Greek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of air conditioning in residences, [[residential care home]]s and [[medical facility|medical facilities]] was identified as a contributing factor to the estimated 35,000 deaths – mostly in [[Germany]], [[France]] and [[Italy]] – left in the wake of the [[European Heat Wave of 2003|2003 heat wave]].

'''Parallel ATA''' ('''PATA'''), originally ATA, is an [[Electrical connector|interface]] [[standardization|standard]] for the connection of [[computer storage|storage]] devices such as [[hard disk]]s, [[solid-state drive]]s, [[Floppy disk|floppy drives]],   and [[optical disc drive]]s in [[computer]]s. The standard is maintained by X3/[[INCITS]] committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.t13.org T13&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the underlying '''AT Attachment''' ('''ATA''') and '''AT Attachment Packet Interface''' ('''ATAPI''') standards.

The Parallel ATA standard is the result of a long history of incremental technical development, which began with the original AT Attachment interface, developed for use in early [[PC AT]] equipment. The ATA interface itself evolved in several stages from [[Western Digital]]'s original '''Integrated Drive Electronics''' ('''IDE''') interface. As a result, many near-synonyms for ATA/ATAPI and its previous incarnations are still in common informal use. After the introduction of [[Serial ATA]] in 2003, the original ATA was [[retronym|retroactively renamed]] ''Parallel ATA''.

Parallel ATA cables have a maximum allowable length of only {{convert|18|inch|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. Because of this limit, the technology normally appears as an internal computer storage interface. For many years ATA provided the most common and the least expensive interface for this application. It has largely been replaced by [[Serial ATA|Serial ATA (SATA)]] in newer systems.

==History and terminology==

The standard was originally conceived as &quot;PC/AT Attachment&quot; as its primary feature was a direct connection to the 16-bit [[ISA bus]] introduced with the IBM PC/AT. The &quot;AT&quot; in &quot;[[PC/AT|IBM PC/AT]]&quot; is an initialism for &quot;Advanced Technology,&quot; but that term does not appear in current or recent versions of the ATA specification; it is simply &quot;AT Attachment&quot;. This name was chosen to avoid possible trademark issues.  

===IDE and ATA-1===
[[File:1992 80386 PC AMD 386DX-40 no onboard IDE floppy serial parallel sound video or network.jpg|thumb|Example of a 1992 80386 PC motherboard with nothing built in other than memory, keyboard, processor, cache, realtime clock, and slots. Such basic motherboards could have been outfitted with either the ST-506 or ATA interface, but usually not both. A single 2-drive ATA interface and a floppy interface was added to this system via the 16-bit ISA card.]]
The first version of what is now called the ATA/ATAPI interface was developed by [[Western Digital]] under the name ''Integrated Drive Electronics'' (IDE). Together with [[Control Data Corporation]] (who manufactured the hard drive part) and [[Compaq|Compaq Computer]] (into whose systems these drives would initially go), they developed the connector, the signaling protocols, and so on with the goal of remaining software compatible with the existing [[ST-506]] hard drive interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=System Architecture: a look at hard drives  |url=http://www.ackadia.com/computer/system-architecture/system-architecture-harddrive.php  |accessdate=2008-07-25 |quote=&quot;IDE drives on-board controllers are configured to appear to the computer like standard ST506 drives&quot;|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKd5yWS5 |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first such drives appeared in Compaq PCs in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The PC Guide: Overview and History of the IDE/ATA Interface |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/over.htm |accessdate=2008-08-23 |author=Charles M. Kozierok |date=2001-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of CAM ATA |url=http://www.ata-atapi.com/histcam.html |accessdate=2008-08-27 |author=Gene Milligan |date=2005-12-18|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKd6jlzP |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Integrated Drive Electronics'' refers not just to the connector and interface definition, but also to the fact that the [[drive controller]] is integrated into the drive, as opposed to a separate controller on or connected to the [[motherboard]]. The interface cards used to connect a parallel ATA drive to, for example, a [[PCI slot]] are not drive controllers, they are merely bridges between the host bus and the ATA interface. Since the original ATA interface is essentially just a 16-bit [[ISA slot]] in disguise, the bridge was especially simple in case of an ATA connector being located on an ISA interface card. The integrated controller presented the drive to the host computer as an array of 512-byte blocks with a relatively simple command interface. This relieved the mainboard and interface cards in the host computer of the chores of stepping the disk head arm, moving the head arm in and out, and so on, as had to be done with earlier [[ST-506]] and [[Enhanced Small Disk Interface|ESDI]] hard drives. All of these low-level details of the mechanical operation of the drive were now handled by the controller on the drive itself. This also eliminated the need to design a single controller that could handle many different types of drives, since the controller could be unique for the drive. The host need only ask for a particular sector, or block, to be read or written, and either accept the data from the drive or send the data to it.

The interface used by these drives was standardized in 1994 as ANSI standard X3.221-1994, ''AT Attachment Interface for Disk Drives''. After later versions of the standard were developed, this became known as &quot;ATA-1&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The PC Guide: ATA (ATA-1) |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/stdATA-c.html |accessdate=2008-08-23 |author=Charles M.

A short-lived, seldom-used implementation of ATA was created for the IBM XT and similar machines that used the 8-bit version of the ISA bus. It has been referred to as &quot;XTA&quot; or &quot;XT Attachment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Second ATA interface===
[[File:SC OAK OTI601 Mozart.jpg|thumb|An [[Oak Technology]] ''Mozart 16'' 16-bit ISA sound card, from when the CDROM drive interface had not yet been standardized. This card offers four separate interface connectors for IDE, Panasonic, Mitsumi, and Sony CDROM drives, but only one connector could be used since they all shared the same interface wiring.]]
[[File:Soundblaster32.jpg|thumb|A [[SoundBlaster]] 32 16-bit ISA sound card, from after connector standardization had occurred, with just an IDE interface for the CDROM drive.]]
When PC motherboard makers started to include onboard ATA interfaces in place of the earlier ISA plug-in cards, there was usually only one ATA connector on the board, which could support up to two hard drives. At the time in combination with the floppy drive, this was sufficient for most people, and eventually it became common to have two hard drives installed. When the [[CD-ROM]] was developed, many computers would have been unable to accept these drives if they had been ATA devices, due to already having two hard drives installed. Adding the CD-ROM drive would have required removal of one of the drives.

[[SCSI]] was available as a CD-ROM expansion option at the time, but devices with SCSI were more expensive than ATA devices due to the need for a smart interface that is capable of [[bus arbitration]]. SCSI typically added US$ 100-300 to the cost of a storage device, in addition to the cost of a SCSI host adapter.

The less-expensive solution was the addition of a dedicated CD-ROM interface, typically included as an expansion option on a [[sound card]]. It was included on the sound card because early business PCs did not include support for more than simple beeps from the internal speaker, and tuneful sound playback was considered unnecessary for early business software. When the CD-ROM was introduced, it was logical to also add digital audio to the computer at the same time (for the same reason, sound cards tended to include a [[gameport]] interface for joysticks). An older business PC could be upgraded in this manner to meet the [[Multimedia PC]] standard for early software packages that used sound (which required the sound card) and colorful video animation (which required the CD-ROM as floppy disks simply did not have the necessary data capacity).

The second drive interface initially was not well-defined. It was first introduced with interfaces specific to certain CD-ROM drives such as Mitsumi, Sony or Panasonic drives,&lt;ref&gt;Creative Labs sound card documentation showing diagram with custom Mitsumi, Sony, and Panasonic CD-ROM drive connectors http://stason.org/TULARC/pc/sound-cards-multimedia/CREATIVE-LABS-INC-Sound-card-16-BIT-AUDIO-CARD-PAN.html&lt;/ref&gt; and it was common to find early sound cards with two or three separate connectors each designed to match a certain brand of CD-ROM drive. This evolved into the standard ATA interface for ease of cross-compatibility, though the sound card ATA interface still usually supported only a single CD-ROM and not hard drives.

This second ATA interface on the sound card eventually evolved into the second motherboard ATA interface which was long included as a standard component in all PCs.
Called the &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; ATA interfaces, they were assigned to [[Input/Output Base Address|base addresses]] 0x1F0 and 0x170 on [[ISA bus]] systems.

===EIDE and ATA-2===
In 1994, about the same time that the ATA-1 standard was adopted, Western Digital introduced drives under a newer name, '''Enhanced IDE''' (EIDE). These included most of the features of the forthcoming ATA-2 specification and several additional enhancements. Other manufacturers introduced their own variations of ATA-1 such as &quot;Fast ATA&quot; and &quot;Fast ATA-2&quot;.

The new version of the ANSI standard, ''AT Attachment Interface with Extensions ATA-2'' (X3.279-1996), was approved in 1996. It included most of the features of the manufacturer-specific variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The PC Guide: ATA (ATA-2) |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/stdATA2-c.html |accessdate=2008-08-23 |author=Charles M. Kozierok |date=2001-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ATA2&gt;{{cite book |last=Technical Committee T13 AT Attachment |authorlink=http://www.t13.org/ |title=AT Attachment Interface with Extensions (ATA-2) |publisher=Global Engineering Documents |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATA-2 also was the first to note that devices other than hard drives could be attached to the interface:
{{quotation|
''3.1.7 Device: Device is a storage peripheral. Traditionally, a device on the ATA interface has been a hard disk drive, but any form of storage device may be placed on the ATA interface provided it adheres to this standard.'' &lt;br /&gt;—from,&lt;ref name=ATA2/&gt;  page 2
}}

===ATAPI===

As mentioned in the previous sections, ATA was originally designed for, and worked only with hard disks and devices that could emulate them. The introduction of ATAPI (ATA Packet Interface) by a group called the Small Form Factor committee allowed ATA to be used for a variety of other devices that require functions beyond those necessary for hard disks. For example, any removable media device needs a &quot;media eject&quot; command, and a way for the host to determine whether the media is present, and these were not provided in the ATA protocol.

The Small Form Factor committee approached this problem by defining ATAPI, the &quot;ATA Packet Interface&quot;. ATAPI is actually a protocol allowing the ATA interface to carry [[SCSI]] commands and responses; therefore all ATAPI devices are actually &quot;speaking SCSI&quot; other than at the electrical interface. In fact, some early ATAPI devices were simply SCSI devices with an ATA/ATAPI to SCSI protocol converter added on. The SCSI commands and responses are embedded in &quot;packets&quot; (hence &quot;ATA Packet Interface&quot;)
for transmission on the ATA cable. This allows any device class for which a SCSI command set has been defined to be interfaced via ATA/ATAPI.

ATAPI devices are also &quot;speaking ATA&quot;, as the ATA physical interface and protocol are still being used to send the packets. On the other hand, ATA hard drives and solid state drives do not use ATAPI.

ATAPI devices include CD-ROM and [[DVD-ROM]] drives, [[tape drive]]s, and large-capacity [[floppy disk|floppy]] drives such as the [[Zip drive]] and [[SuperDisk drive]].

The SCSI commands and responses used by each class of ATAPI device (CD-ROM, tape, etc.) are described in other documents or specifications specific to those device classes
and are not within ATA/ATAPI or the T13 committee's purview. &lt;!-- ATAPI Packet Commands for Block Devices (SFF-8070i) ATAPI Packet Commands for CD-ROMs (SFF-8020i) --&gt;

ATAPI was adopted as part of ATA in INCITS 317-1998, ''AT Attachment with Packet Interface Extension (ATA/ATAPI-4)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The PC Guide: SFF-8020 / ATA Packet Interface (ATAPI) |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/stdATAPI-c.html |accessdate=2008-08-23 |author=Charles M. Kozierok |date=2001-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The PC Guide: ATA/ATAPI-4 |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/stdATA4-c.html |accessdate=2008-08-23 |author=Charles M. Kozierok |date=2001-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Technical Committee T13 AT Attachment |authorlink = |url=http://www.t13.org/ |title=AT Attachment with Packet Interface Extension (ATA/ATAPI-4) |publisher=Global Engineering Documents |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UDMA and ATA-4===
The ATA/ATAPI-4 also introduced several &quot;Ultra DMA&quot; transfer modes. These initially supported speeds from 16 MByte/s to 33 MByte/second. In later versions faster Ultra DMA modes were added, requiring a new 80-wire cable to reduce crosstalk. The latest versions of Parallel ATA support up to 133 MByte/s.

===Current terminology===

The terms &quot;integrated drive electronics&quot; (IDE), &quot;enhanced IDE&quot; and &quot;EIDE&quot; have come to be used interchangeably with ATA (now Parallel ATA, or PATA).

In addition there have been several generations of &quot;EIDE&quot; drives marketed, compliant with various versions of the ATA specification. An early &quot;EIDE&quot; drive might be compatible with ATA-2, while a later one with ATA-6.

Nevertheless a request for an &quot;IDE&quot; or &quot;EIDE&quot; drive from a computer parts vendor will almost always yield a drive that will work with most Parallel ATA interfaces.

Another common usage is to refer to the specification version by the fastest mode supported. For example, ATA-4 supported Ultra DMA modes 0 through 2, the latter providing a maximum transfer rate of 33&amp;nbsp;megabytes per second. ATA-4 drives are thus sometimes called &quot;UDMA-33&quot; drives, and sometimes &quot;ATA-33&quot; drives. Similarly, ATA-6 introduced a maximum transfer speed of 100&amp;nbsp;megabytes per second, and some drives complying to this version of the standard are marketed as &quot;PATA/100&quot; drives.

===BIOS size limitations===
{{seealso|Logical block addressing#Enhanced BIOS|l1=Enhanced BIOS}}
&lt;!-- Also, do we need to mention the earlier 504&amp;amp;nbsp;MB limit in earlier BIOSes, and make clear that it was not the interface's problem but rather the BIOS... or was it? Or is that so old that we don't need to bother? [_maybe the words &quot;such as&quot; already allow for the 504&amp;amp;nbsp;MB, 32&amp;amp;nbsp;MB, and other random limits_]--&gt;
Initially the size of an ATA drive was stored in the system BIOS using a format called C/H/S or cylinders, heads, sectors. These numbers were important for the earlier ST-506 interface, but were generally meaningless for ATA -- the CHS parameters for later ATA large drives often specified impossibly high numbers of heads or sectors that did not actually define the internal physical layout of the drive at all.

Due to a lack of foresight by motherboard manufacturers, the system BIOS was often hobbled by artificial C/H/S size limitations due to the manufacturer assuming certain values would never exceed a certain numerical maximum.

The first of these BIOS limits occurred when ATA drives reached sizes in excess of 504 megabytes. Some motherboard BIOS would not allow C/H/S values above 1024 cylinders, 16 heads, and 63 sectors. Multiplied by 512 bytes per sector, this totals 528,482,304 bytes which divided by 1,048,576 per megabyte, equals 504 megabytes.

The second of these BIOS limitations occurred at 1024 cylinders, 256 heads, and 63 sectors, totalling 8,455,716,864 bytes, commonly referred to as the 8.4 gigabyte barrier. This also was not a limit imposed by the ATA interface.

It was eventually determined that these size limitations could be overridden with a tiny program loaded at startup from a hard drive's boot sector. Some hard drive manufacturers such as Western Digital started including these override utilities with new large hard drives to help overcome these problems. However, if the computer were booted in some other manner without loading the special utility, the invalid BIOS settings would be used, and the drive could either be inaccessible or could appear to be damaged to the operating system.

===Interface size limitations===
The original ATA specification used a 28-bit addressing mode, allowing for the addressing of 2&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; (268,435,456) sectors (blocks) of 512&amp;nbsp;bytes each, resulting in a maximum capacity of 128&amp;nbsp;[[Gibibyte|GiB]] (137&amp;nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{BDprefix|p=d}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

ATA-6 introduced 48-bit addressing, increasing the limit to 128&amp;nbsp;[[Pebibyte|PiB]] (144&amp;nbsp;[[Petabyte|PB]]). As a consequence, any ATA drive of capacity larger than about 137&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte]]s must be an ATA-6 or later drive. Connecting such a drive to a host with an ATA-5 or earlier interface will limit the usable capacity to the maximum of the interface.

Some operating systems, including Windows XP pre-SP 1, and Windows 2000, disable 48-bit [[Logical block addressing|LBA]] by default, requiring the user to take extra steps to use the entire capacity of an ATA drive larger than about 137&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Large Disk HOWTO: History of BIOS and IDE limits|url=http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Large-Disk-HOWTO-4.html|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKd7xpO1 |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older operating systems, such as Windows 98, do not support 48-bit LBA at all.

===Obsolescence===

For a long period of time, ATA ruled as the primary storage device interface and in some systems a third and fourth motherboard interface was provided (for example, Promise Ultra-100), for up to eight ATA devices attached to the motherboard.

After the introduction of SATA ([[Serial ATA]]), use of Parallel ATA declined, and new motherboards had only a single PATA connector, for up to two PATA optical drives, along with (typically) six or more SATA connectors for hard drives and other devices. In new computers, the parallel ATA interface is rarely used, and several PC [[chipset]]s have removed support for PATA, and motherboard vendors still wishing to offer ATA with those chipsets must include an additional interface chip.

==Parallel ATA interface==
[[File:nappe.svg|center|Ribbon cable with two connectors]]

Parallel ATA cables transfer data 16 bits at a time. The traditional cable uses 40-pin connectors attached to a [[ribbon cable]]. Each cable has two or three connectors, one of which plugs into an adapter interfacing with the rest of the computer system. The remaining connector(s) plug into drives. 

ATA's cables have had 40 wires for most of its history (44 conductors for the smaller form-factor version used for 2.5&quot; drives&amp;nbsp;— the extra four for power), but an 80-wire version appeared with the introduction of the ''Ultra DMA/33'' (''UDMA'') mode. All of the additional wires in the new cable are [[ground (electricity)|ground]] wires, interleaved with the previously defined wires to reduce the effects of [[capacitive coupling]] between neighboring signal wires, reducing [[Crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]]. Capacitive coupling is more of a problem at higher transfer rates, and this change was necessary to enable the 66&amp;nbsp;megabytes per second (MB/s) transfer rate of ''UDMA4'' to work reliably. The faster ''UDMA5'' and ''UDMA6'' modes also require 80-conductor cables.
[[File:ATA cables.jpg|thumb|300px|ATA cables:&lt;br /&gt;40 wire ribbon cable (top)&lt;br /&gt; 80 wire ribbon cable (bottom)]]

Though the number of wires doubled, the number of connector pins and the pinout remain the same as 40-conductor cables, and the external appearance of the connectors is identical. Internally the connectors are different; the connectors for the 80-wire cable connect a larger number of ground wires to a smaller number of ground pins, while the connectors for the 40-wire cable connect ground wires to ground pins one-for-one. 80-wire cables usually come with three differently colored connectors (blue, black, and gray for controller, master drive, and slave drive respectively) as opposed to uniformly colored 40-wire cable's connectors (commonly all gray). The gray connector on 80-conductor cables has pin 28 CSEL not connected, making it the slave position for drives configured cable select.

Round parallel ATA cables (as opposed to ribbon cables) were eventually made available as they were believed to have less effect on [[computer cooling#Use_of_rounded_cables|computer cooling]] and were easier to handle; however, only ribbon cables are supported by the ATA specifications. 

; Pin 20
In the ATA standard pin 20 is defined as (mechanical) key and is not used. This socket on the female connector is often obstructed, requiring pin 20 to be omitted from the male cable or drive connector, making it impossible to plug it in the wrong way round; a male connector with pin 20 present cannot be used. However, some [[flash memory]] drives can use pin 20 as VCC_in to power the drive without requiring a special power cable; this feature can only be used if the equipment supports this use of pin 20.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transcendusa.com/Support/FAQ/index.asp?axn=Detail&amp;LangNo=0&amp;FAQNo=212 Welcome to Transcend website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pin 28 of the gray (slave/middle) connector of an 80 conductor cable is not attached to any conductor of the cable. It is attached normally on the black (master drive end) and blue (motherboard end) connectors.

; Pin 34
Pin 34 is connected to ground inside the blue connector of an 80 conductor cable but not attached to any conductor of the cable. It is attached normally on the gray and black connectors. See page 315 of.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.t10.org/t13/project/d1321r3-ATA-ATAPI-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences between connectors on 80-conductor cables===
[[File:PATA-Connectors-exposed.png|center|400px|Differences between connectors]]
The image shows PATA connectors after removal of strain relief, cover, and cable. Pin one is at bottom left of the connectors, pin 2 is top left, etc., except that the lower image of the blue connector shows the view from the opposite side, and pin one is at top right.

Each contact comprises a pair of points which together pierce the insulation of the ribbon cable with such precision that they make a connection to the desired conductor without harming the insulation on the neighboring wires. The center row of contacts are all connected to the common ground bus and attached to the odd numbered conductors of the cable. The top row of contacts are the even-numbered sockets of the connector (mating with the even-numbered pins of the receptacle) and attach to every other even-numbered conductor of the cable. The bottom row of contacts are the odd-numbered sockets of the connector (mating with the odd-numbered pins of the receptacle) and attach to the remaining even-numbered conductors of the cable.

Note the connections to the common ground bus from sockets 2 (top left), 19 (center bottom row), 22, 24, 26, 30, and 40 on all connectors. Also note (enlarged detail, bottom, looking from the opposite side of the connector) that socket 34 of the blue connector does not contact any conductor but unlike socket 34 of the other two connectors, it does connect to the common ground bus. On the gray connector, note that socket 28 is completely missing, so that pin 28 of the drive attached to the gray connector will be open. On the black connector, sockets 28 and 34 are completely normal, so that pins 28 and 34 of the drive attached to the black connector will be connected to the cable. Pin 28 of the black drive reaches pin 28 of the host receptacle but not pin 28 of the gray drive, while pin 34 of the black drive reaches pin 34 of the gray drive but not pin 34 of the host. Instead, pin 34 of the host is grounded.

The standard dictates color-coded connectors for easy identification by both installer and cable maker. All three connectors are different from one another. The blue (host) connector has the socket for pin 34 connected to ground inside the connector but not attached to any conductor of the cable. Since the old 40 conductor cables do not ground pin 34, the presence of a ground connection indicates that an 80 conductor cable is installed. The wire for pin 34 is attached normally on the other types and is not grounded. Installing the cable backwards (with the black connector on the system board, the blue connector on the remote device and the gray connector on the center device) will ground pin 34 of the remote device and connect host pin 34 through to pin 34 of the center device. The gray center connector omits the connection to pin 28 but connects pin 34 normally, while the black end connector connects both pins 28 and 34 normally.

===Multiple devices on a cable===
If two devices attach to a single cable, one must be designated as ''device 0'' (commonly referred to as ''master'') and the other as ''device 1'' (''slave''). This distinction is necessary to allow both drives to share the cable without conflict. The ''master'' drive is the drive that usually appears &quot;first&quot; to the computer's [[BIOS]] and/or [[operating system]]. On old BIOSes ([[Intel 486]] era and older), the drives are often referred to by the BIOS as &quot;C&quot; for the master and &quot;D&quot; for the slave following the way DOS would refer to the active primary partitions on each.

The mode that a drive must use is often set by a [[Jumper (computing)|jumper setting]] on the drive itself, which must be manually set to ''master'' or ''slave''. If there is a single device on a cable, it should be configured as ''master''. However, some hard drives have a special setting called ''single'' for this configuration (Western Digital, in particular). Also, depending on the hardware and software available, a single drive on a cable can work reliably even though configured as the ''slave'' drive (this configuration is most often seen when a CD ROM has a channel to itself).

===Cable select===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[CS]] --&gt;

A drive mode called ''cable select'' was described as optional in ATA-1 and has come into fairly widespread use with ATA-5 and later. A drive set to &quot;cable select&quot; automatically configures itself as master or slave, according to its position on the cable. Cable select is controlled by pin 28. The host adapter grounds this pin; if a device sees that the pin is grounded, it becomes the master device; if it sees that pin 28 is open, the device becomes the slave device.

This setting is usually chosen by a [[Jumper (computing)|jumper setting]] on the drive called &quot;cable select&quot;, usually marked ''CS'', which is separate from the &quot;master&quot; or &quot;slave&quot; setting.

Note that if two drives are configured as ''master'' and ''slave'' manually, this configuration does not need to correspond to their position on the cable. Pin 28 is only used to let the drives know their position on the cable; it is not used by the host when communicating with the drives.

With the 40-wire cable it was very common to implement cable select by simply cutting the pin 28 wire between the two device connectors; putting the slave device at the end of the cable, and the master on the middle connector. This arrangement eventually was standardized in later versions. If there is just one device on the cable, this results in an unused stub of cable, which is undesirable for physical convenience and electrical reasons. The stub causes [[signal reflections]], particularly at higher transfer rates.

Starting with the 80-wire cable defined for use in ATAPI5/UDMA4, the master device goes at the end of the {{convert|18|in|mm|sing=on}} cable—the black connector—and the slave device goes on the middle connector—the gray one—and the blue connector goes onto the motherboard. So, if there is only one (master) device on the cable, there is no cable stub to cause reflections. Also, cable select is now implemented in the slave device connector, usually simply by omitting the contact from the connector body.

====Master and slave clarification====
Although they are in extremely common use, the terms [[Master/slave (technology)|&quot;master&quot; and &quot;slave&quot;]] do not actually appear in current versions of the ATA specifications. The two devices are simply referred to as &quot;device 0&quot; and &quot;device 1&quot;, respectively, in ATA-2 and later.

It is a common myth that the controller on the master drive assumes control over the slave drive, or that the master drive may claim priority of communication over the other device on the channel. In fact, the drivers in the host operating system perform the necessary arbitration and serialization, and each drive's onboard controller operates independently of the other.

The terms &quot;master&quot; and &quot;slave&quot; have not been without controversy. In 2003, the [[County of Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States|US]] requested that, when possible, suppliers stop using the terms because the county found them unacceptable in light of its &quot;cultural diversity and sensitivity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/outrage/master.asp snopes.com: Master/Slave]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serialized, overlapped, and queued operations===
The parallel ATA protocols up through ATA-3 require that once a command has been given on an ATA interface, it must complete before any subsequent command may be given. Operations on the devices must be serialized—with only one operation in progress at a time—with respect to the ATA host interface. A useful mental model is that the host ATA interface is busy with the first request for its entire duration, and therefore can not be told about another request until the first one is complete. The function of serializing requests to the interface is usually performed by a device driver in the host operating system.

The ATA-4 and subsequent versions of the specification have included an &quot;overlapped feature set&quot; and a &quot;queued feature set&quot; as optional features, both being given the name &quot;[[Tagged Command Queuing]]&quot;, a reference to a set of features from SCSI which the ATA version attempts to emulate. However, support for these is extremely rare in actual parallel ATA products and device drivers because these feature sets were implemented in such a way as to maintain software compatibility with its heritage as originally an extension of the ISA bus. This implementation resulted in excessive CPU utilization which largely negated the advantages of command queuing. By contrast, overlapped and queued operations have been common in other storage buses, in particular, SCSI's version of tagged command queuing had no need to be software compatible with ISA's APIs, allowing it to attain high performance with low overhead on buses which supported first party DMA like PCI. This has long been seen as a major advantage of SCSI.

The Serial ATA standard has supported [[Native Command Queuing|native command queueing]] since its first release, but it is an optional feature for both host-adapters and target-devices. Many less expensive PC motherboards do not support NCQ. Many SATA/II hard drives sold today support NCQ, while no removable (CD/DVD) drives do because the ATAPI command set used to control them prohibits queued operations.

===Two devices on one cable&amp;nbsp;— speed impact===
There are many debates about how much a slow device can impact the performance of a faster device on the same cable. There is an effect, but the debate is confused by the blurring of two quite different causes, called here &quot;Lowest speed&quot; and &quot;One operation at a time&quot;.

====&quot;Lowest speed&quot;====
It is a common misconception that, if two devices of different speed capabilities are on the same cable, both devices' data transfers will be constrained to the speed of the slower device.

For all modern ATA host adapters this is not true, as modern ATA host adapters support ''independent device timing''. This allows each device on the cable to transfer data at its own best speed. Even with older adapters without independent timing, this effect only applies to the data transfer phase of a read or write operation. This is usually the shortest part of a complete read or write operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/confTiming-c.html |title=Independent Master/Slave Device Timing |accessdate=2008-08-08 |author=Charles M. Kozierok |date=2001-04-17 |work=The PC Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====&quot;One operation at a time&quot;====
This is caused by the omission of both overlapped and queued feature sets from most parallel ATA products. Only one device on a cable can perform a read or write operation at one time, therefore a fast device on the same cable as a slow device '''under heavy use''' will find it has to wait for the slow device to complete its task first.

However, most modern devices will report write operations as complete once the data is stored in its onboard cache memory, before the data is written to the (slow) magnetic storage. This allows commands to be sent to the other device on the cable, reducing the impact of the &quot;one operation at a time&quot; limit.

The impact of this on a system's performance depends on the application. For example, when copying data from an optical drive to a hard drive (such as during software installation), this effect probably doesn't matter: Such jobs are necessarily limited by the speed of the optical drive no matter where it is. But if the hard drive in question is also expected to provide good throughput for other tasks at the same time, it probably should not be on the same cable as the optical drive.

===HDD passwords and security===
The disk lock is a built-in security feature in the disk. It is part of the ATA specification, and thus not specific to any brand or device. The disk lock can be enabled and disabled by sending special ATA commands to the drive. If a disk is locked, it will refuse all access until it is unlocked.

A disk always has two passwords: A User password and a Master password. Most disks support a Master Password Revision Code. Reportedly some disks can report if the Master password has been changed, or if it still the [[default password|factory default]]. The revision code is word 92 in the IDENTIFY response. Reportedly on some disks a value of 0xFFFE means the Master password is unchanged. The standard does not distinguish this value.

A disk can be locked in two modes: High security mode or Maximum security mode. Bit 8 in word 128 of the IDENTIFY response shows which mode the disk is in: 0 = High, 1 = Maximum.

In High security mode, the disk can be unlocked with either the User or Master password, using the &quot;SECURITY UNLOCK DEVICE&quot; ATA command. There is an attempt limit, normally set to 5, after which the disk must be power cycled or hard-reset before unlocking can be attempted again. Also in High security mode the SECURITY ERASE UNIT command can be used with either the User or Master password.

In Maximum security mode, the disk cannot be unlocked without the User password&amp;nbsp;— the only way to get the disk back to a usable state is to issue the SECURITY ERASE PREPARE command, immediately followed by SECURITY ERASE UNIT. In Maximum security mode the SECURITY ERASE UNIT command requires the User password and will completely erase all data on the disk. The operation is slow, it may take longer than half an hour or more, depending on the size of the disk. (Word 89 in the IDENTIFY response indicates how long the operation will take.) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockbox.org/lock.html Rockbox - Unlocking a password protected harddisk]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the ATA disk lock is intended to be impossible to defeat without a valid password, there are workarounds to unlock a drive. Many data recovery companies offer unlocking services,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwpi.com/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2669&amp;Itemid=129 Hard Drive Passwords Easily Defeated; the Truth about Data Protection], Computer Technology Review. Retrieved 2010-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt; so while the disk lock will deter a casual attacker, it is not secure against a qualified adversary.

===External parallel ATA devices===
It is extremely uncommon to find external PATA devices that directly use the interface for connection to a computer. PATA is primarily restricted to devices installed internally, due to the short data cable specification. A device connected externally needs additional cable length to form a U-shaped bend so that the external device may be placed alongside, or on top of the computer case, and the standard cable length is too short to permit this.

For ease of reach from motherboard to device, the connectors tend to be positioned towards the front edge of motherboards, for connection to devices protruding from the front of the computer case. This front-edge position makes extension out the back to an external device even more difficult. Ribbon cables are poorly shielded, and the standard relies upon the cabling to be installed inside a shielded computer case to meet RF emissions limits.

All external PATA devices, such as external hard drives, use some other interface technology to bridge the distance between the external device and the computer. USB is the most common external interface, followed by Firewire. A bridge chip inside the external devices converts from the USB interface to PATA, and typically only supports a single external device without cable select or master/slave.

==ATA standards versions, transfer rates, and features==
The following table shows the names of the versions of the ATA standards and the transfer modes and rates supported by each. Note that the transfer rate for each mode (for example, 66.7&amp;nbsp;MB/s for UDMA4, commonly called &quot;Ultra-DMA 66&quot;, defined by ATA-5) gives its maximum theoretical transfer rate on the cable. This is simply two bytes multiplied by the effective clock rate, and presumes that every clock cycle is used to transfer end-user data. In practice, of course, protocol overhead reduces this value.

Congestion on the host bus to which the ATA adapter is attached may also limit the maximum burst transfer rate. For example, the maximum data transfer rate for [[conventional PCI]] bus is 133&amp;nbsp;MB/s, and this is shared among all active devices on the bus.

In addition, no ATA [[hard drive]]s existed in 2005 that were capable of measured sustained transfer rates of above 80&amp;nbsp;MB/s. Furthermore, sustained transfer rate tests do not give realistic throughput expectations for most workloads: They use I/O loads specifically designed to encounter almost no delays from seek time or rotational latency. Hard drive performance under most workloads is limited first and second by those two factors; the transfer rate on the bus is a distant third in importance. Therefore, transfer speed limits above 66&amp;nbsp;MB/s really affect performance only when the hard drive can satisfy all I/O requests by reading from its internal [[cache]]&amp;nbsp;— a very unusual situation, especially considering that such data are usually already buffered by the operating system.

As of April 2010 mechanical [[hard disk drive]]s can transfer data at up to 157&amp;nbsp;MB/s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tom2010HardDrives&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=VelociRaptor Returns: 6Gb/s, 600GB, And 10,000 RPM  |publisher=tomshardware.com |author=Patrick Schmid and Achim Roos |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/wd6000hlhx-velociraptor-600gb,2600-5.html |date=2010-04-06 |accessdate=2010-06-26|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKd8rggb |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is beyond the capabilities of the PATA/133 specification.

Only the Ultra DMA modes use [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] to detect errors in data transfer between the controller and drive. This is a 16 bit CRC, and it is used for data blocks only. Transmission of command and status blocks do not use the fast signaling methods that would necessitate CRC. For comparison, in Serial ATA, 32 bit CRC is used for both commands and data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=serialata&amp;nbsp;— a comparison with ultra ata technology|url=http://www.serialata.org/docs/serialata%20-%20a%20comparison%20with%20ultra%20ata%20technology.pdf|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071203002431/http%3A//www.serialata.org/docs/serialata%2520-%2520a%2520comparison%2520with%2520ultra%2520ata%2520technology.pdf |archivedate = December 3, 2007|deadurl=yes}} www.serialata.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===ATAPI Removable Media Device (ARMD)===

ATAPI devices with removable media, other than CD and DVD drives, are classified as ARMD (ATAPI Removable Media Device) and can appear as either a super-floppy (non-partitioned media) or a hard drive (partitioned media) to the [[operating system]]. These can be supported as bootable devices by a BIOS complying with the
'''ATAPI Removable Media Device BIOS Specification''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoenix.com/NR/rdonlyres/EDD1AAA0-177E-4024-A0B1-E4BD06B673F7/0/specsatapi.pdf ATAPI Removable Media Device BIOS Specification] {{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally developed by [[Compaq|Compaq Computer Corporation]] and [[Phoenix Technologies]]. It specifies provisions in the [[BIOS]] of a [[personal computer]] to allow the computer to be [[booting|bootstrapped]] from devices such as [[Iomega Zip drive|Zip drives]], [[Iomega Jaz drive|Jaz drives]], [[SuperDisk]] (LS-120) drives, and similar devices.

These devices have removable media like [[Floppy disk|floppy disk drives]], but capacities more commensurate with [[hard drive]]s, and programming requirements unlike either. Due to limitations in the floppy controller interface most of these devices were [[AT Attachment|ATAPI]] devices, connected to one of the host computer's ATA interfaces, similarly to a hard drive or [[CD-ROM]] device. However, existing BIOS standards did not support these devices. An ARMD-compliant BIOS allows these devices to booted from and used under the operating system without requiring device-specific code in the OS.

A BIOS implementing ARMD allows the user to include ARMD devices in the boot search order. Usually an ARMD device is configured earlier in the boot order than the hard drive. Similarly to a floppy drive, if bootable media is present in the ARMD drive, the BIOS will boot from it; if not, the BIOS will continue in the search order, usually with the hard drive last.

There are two variants of ARMD, ARMD-FDD and ARMD-HDD. Originally ARMD caused the devices to appear as a sort of very large floppy drive, either the primary floppy drive device 00h or the secondary device 01h. Some operating systems required code changes to support floppy disks with capacities far larger than any standard floppy disk drive. Also, standard-floppy disk drive emulation proved to be unsuitable for certain high-capacity floppy disk drives such as [[Iomega Zip drive]]s. Later the ARMD-HDD, ARMD-&quot;Hard disk device&quot;, variant was developed to address these issues. Under ARMD-HDD, an ARMD device appears to the BIOS and the operating system as a hard drive.

===ATA over Ethernet===

In August 2004, Sam Hopkins and Brantley Coile of [[Coraid]] specified a lightweight [[ATA over Ethernet]] protocol to carry ATA commands over [[Ethernet]] instead of directly connecting them to a PATA host adapter. This permitted the established block protocol to be reused in [[storage area network]] (SAN) applications.

The '''Atari 2600''' is a [[video game console]] released in October 1977 by [[Atari, Inc]]. It is credited with popularizing the use of [[microprocessor]]-based hardware and [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridges]] containing game code, instead of having non-microprocessor [[dedicated console|dedicated]] hardware with all games built in. The first game console to use this format was the [[Fairchild Channel F]]; however, the Atari 2600 receives credit for making the plug-in concept popular among the game-playing public.

The console was originally sold as the '''Atari VCS''', for '''Video Computer System'''. Following the release of the [[Atari 5200]], in 1982, the VCS was renamed &quot;Atari 2600&quot;, after the unit's Atari part number, CX2600. The 2600 was typically bundled with two [[joystick]] [[game controller|controllers]], a conjoined pair of [[paddle (game controller)|paddle]] controllers, and a cartridge game—initially ''[[Combat (video game)|Combat]]''&lt;ref name=combat&gt;{{cite web | last = Weesner | first = Jason | title =On Game Design: A History of Video Games | date=  2007-01-11 | url =http://www.gamecareerguide.com/features/327/on_game_design_a_history_of_video_.php?page=3 | accessdate = 2007-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later ''[[Pac-Man (Atari 2600)|Pac-Man]]''.&lt;ref name=2600pacman&gt;[http://www.mr-atari.com/afbeeldingen/systems/2600pacmanblue.jpg Image of box with Pac-Man sticker]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atari 2600 was wildly successful, and during much of the 1980s, &quot;Atari&quot; was a synonym for this model in mainstream media and, [[metonymy|by extension]], for video games in general.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite web | last = Edgers | first = Geoff | title =Atari and the deep history of video games| date=  2009-03-08 | work= [[Boston Globe]] |url =http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/03/08/a_talk_with_nick_montfort/ | accessdate = 2009-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the 2600 was named the second greatest video game console of all time by [[IGN]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/top-25-consoles/2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Atari Inc. had purchased an engineering think tank in 1973 called [[Cyan Engineering]] to research next-generation video game systems, and had been working on a prototype known as &quot;Stella&quot; (named after one of the engineers' bicycles) for some time. Unlike prior generations of machines that used custom [[logic programming|logic]] to play a small number of games, Stella's core was a complete [[Central processing unit|CPU]], the famous [[MOS Technology]] [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] in a cost-reduced version, known as the [[MOS Technology 6507|6507]]. It was combined with a [[Random Access Memory|RAM]]-and-[[I/O]] chip, the [[MOS Technology 6532]], and a display and sound chip of their own design known as the '''[[Television Interface Adapter|TIA]]''', for '''''T'''elevision '''I'''nterface '''A'''daptor''. Beyond those three, the first two versions of the machine contain just one more chip, a standard CMOS logic buffer [[Integrated circuit|IC]], bringing the total chip count to the very low and cost-effective number of four. Some later versions of the console eliminated the buffer chip. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Programs for small computers were generally stored on cassette tape, disk or paper tape. By the early 1970s, [[Hewlett Packard]] manufactured desktop computers costing thousands of dollars such as the [[HP 9830]], which packaged Read Only Memory (ROM) into removable cartridges to add special programming features, and these were being considered for use in games. At first, the design was not going to be cartridge-based, but after seeing a &quot;fake&quot; cartridge system on another machine, they realized they could place the games on cartridges essentially for the price of the connector and packaging.

In August 1976, [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] released their own [[CPU]]-based system, the [[Channel F|Video Entertainment System]]. Stella was still not ready for production, but it was clear that it needed to be before there were a number of &quot;me too&quot; products filling up the market—which had happened after they released [[Pong]]. Atari Inc. simply did not have the cash flow to complete the system quickly, given that sales of their own Pong systems were cooling. [[Nolan Bushnell]] eventually turned to [[Time Warner|Warner Communications]], and sold the company to them in 1976 for [[US$]]28 million on the promise that Stella would be produced as soon as possible.

Key to the eventual success of the machine was the hiring of [[Jay Miner]], a chip designer who managed to squeeze an entire [[breadboard]] of equipment making up the TIA into a single chip. Once that was completed and debugged, the system was ready for shipping. By the time it was released in 1977, the development had cost about US$100 million.

=== Launch and success ===
{{Ref improve section|date=December 2006}}

The unit was originally priced at US$199, and shipped with two joysticks and a ''[[Combat (video game)|Combat]]'' cartridge (eight additional games were available at launch and sold separately).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forster |first=Winnie |authorlink=Winnie Forster |title=The encyclopedia of consoles, handhelds &amp; home computers 1972 - 2005 |year=2005 |publisher=GAMEPLAN |isbn=3-00-015359-4|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a move to compete directly with the [[Fairchild Channel F|Channel F]], Atari Inc. named the machine the Video Computer System (or VCS for short), as the Channel F was at that point known as the '''VES''', for ''Video Entertainment System''. The VCS was also rebadged as the '''Sears Video Arcade''' and sold through [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]] stores.

When Fairchild learned of Atari Inc.'s naming, they quickly changed the name of their system to become the Channel F. However, both systems were now in the midst of a vicious round of price-cutting: ''Pong'' clones that had been made obsolete by these newer and more powerful machines were sold off to discounters for ever-lower prices. Soon many of the clone companies were out of business, and both Fairchild and Atari Inc. were selling to a public that was completely burnt out on Pong. In 1977, Atari Inc. sold only 250,000 VCSs.

For the first year of production, the VCS was manufactured in [[Sunnyvale, California]]. The consoles manufactured there had thick internal [[RF shielding]], and thick plastic molding around the sides and bottom. These added weight to the console, and because all six switches were on the front, these consoles were nicknamed &quot;Heavy Sixers&quot;. After this first year, production moved to [[Hong Kong]], and the consoles manufactured there had thinner plastic molding. In 1978, only 550,000 units from a production run of 800,000 were sold, requiring further financial support from Warner to cover losses. This led directly to the disagreements that caused Atari Inc. founder [[Nolan Bushnell]] to leave the company in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Fulton, [http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3766/atari_the_golden_years__a_.php?page=6 &quot;Atari: The Golden Years -- A History, 1978-1981&quot;], ''Gamasutra'', 21 August 2008, pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the public realized it was possible to play video games other than ''Pong'', and programmers learned how to push its hardware's capabilities, the VCS gained popularity. By this point, Fairchild had given up, thinking video games were a passing fad, thereby handing the entire quickly growing market to Atari Inc. By 1979, the VCS was the best-selling [[Christmas]] gift (and console), mainly because of its exclusive content, and 1 million units were sold that year.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}
[[File:Atari-2600-Console.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The all black &quot;Darth Vader&quot; 4-switch model from 1982-]] 
Atari Inc. then licensed the smash [[Arcade game|arcade]] hit ''[[Space Invaders]]'' by [[Taito Corporation|Taito]], which greatly increased the unit's popularity when it was released in January 1980, doubling sales again to over 2 million units. The VCS and its cartridges were the main factor behind Atari Inc. grossing more than $2 billion in 1980. Sales then doubled again for the next two years; by 1982, the console had sold 10 million units, while its best-selling game ''[[Pac-Man (Atari 2600)|Pac-Man]]'' sold 7 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2008|work=[[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition]]|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]]|year=2008|isbn=1904994210|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OJQFSlyMEfAC|accessdate=2011-04-11|page=24|quote=10 million - number of Atari 2600 consoles sold by 1982. 7 million - estimated number of copies of Pac-Man for the Atari 2600 sold.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the VCS was given a minor revision in which the left and right difficulty switches were moved to the back of the console, leaving four switches on the front. Other than this, these four-switch consoles looked nearly identical to the earlier six-switch models. In 1982, another version of the four-switch console was released without woodgrain. They were nicknamed &quot;[[Darth Vader]]&quot; consoles due to their all-black appearance. These were also the first consoles to be officially called &quot;Atari 2600&quot;, as the [[Atari 5200]] was released the same year.

During this period, Atari Inc. expanded the 2600 family with two other compatible consoles. They designed the [[Atari 2700]], a wireless version of the console that was never released because of a design flaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Curt |last=Vendel |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/2700/a2700.html |title=Atari 2700 Wireless VCS |publisher=Atari Museum |accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also built a sleeker version of the machine dubbed the [[Atari 2800]] to sell directly to the [[Japan]]ese market in early 1983, but it suffered from competition with the newly released [[Nintendo]] [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]].

In a survey mentioned by [[Jeff Rovin]] it is reported that more stores reported breakdowns of the Atari 2600 system than any other, and that Atari repair centers seemed to have the most trouble with consoles manufactured in 1980. In one case it is stated that a system was repaired five times before static electricity from a carpet was discovered as having caused the problem. The controllers were also a source of breakage because of the way they could be gripped by a player holding it with their fist, allowing players to get carried away and over control, which was less likely with other systems released at the time, such as the [[Odyssey 2]], which had controllers that were nearly half its size.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Complete Guide to Conquering Video Games&quot; by Jeff Rovin, [[Collier Books]], 1982 pages 7, 9, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sears Tele-Games 2600s ===

[[Image:Sears tele games video arcade.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Early Atari 2600 that was branded &quot;Tele-Games&quot; and sold by Sears]]
Atari Inc. also continued their [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] relationship with Sears under the latter's Tele-Games brand label, which started in 1975 with the original [[Pong]]. Sears released several versions of the 2600 as the Sears Video Arcade series from 1977 to 1983. These include the Rev. A &quot;Heavy Sixer&quot; model in 1977, the Rev. B &quot;4 switch&quot; model in 1980, and the US version of the Atari 2800 branded as the Sears Video Arcade II in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;atariage&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.atariage.com/2600/archives/consoles.html | title = AtariAge - 2600 Consoles and Clones | last = Yarusso | first = Albert | work=[[AtariAge]] | accessdate = 2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sears also released their own versions of Atari Inc.'s games under the Tele-Games brand — often with different titles&lt;ref name=&quot;searscartridge&quot; /&gt; — which included the Tele-Games branded variations of text and picture labels. Three games were also produced by Atari Inc. for Sears as exclusive releases under the Tele-Games brand: ''[[Steeplechase (arcade game)|Steeplechase]]'', ''Stellar Track'', and ''Submarine Commander''.&lt;ref name=&quot;searscartridge&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.atariage.com/label_page.html?LabelID=10 | title = Atari 2600 - Sears&amp;nbsp;— Picture Label Variation | last = Yarusso | first = Albert | work=[[AtariAge]] | accessdate = 2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sears' Tele-Games brand was unrelated to the company [[Telegames]], which also produced cartridges for the Atari 2600 — mostly re-issues of [[M-Network]] games.&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegamesCatalog&quot;&gt;{{cite web

=== Decline ===

During this period, Atari Inc. continued to grow until it had one of the largest [[research and development|R&amp;D]] divisions in [[Silicon Valley]]. However, it spent much of its R&amp;D budget on projects that seemed rather out of place at a video game (or even home computer) company; many of these projects never saw the light of day. Meanwhile, several attempts to bring out newer consoles failed for one reason or another, although Atari Inc.'s [[home computer]] systems, the [[Atari 8-bit family]], sold reasonably, if not spectacularly. Warner was more than happy anyway, as it seemed to have no end to the sales of the 2600, and Atari Inc. was responsible for over half of the company's income.

The programmers of many of Atari Inc.'s biggest hits grew disgruntled with the company for not crediting game developers and many left the company and formed their own independent software companies. The most prominent and longest-lasting of these third-party developers was [[Activision]], founded in 1980, whose titles quickly became more popular than those of Atari Inc. itself. Atari Inc. attempted to block third-party development for the 2600 in court but failed,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} and soon other publishers, such as [[Imagic]] and [[Coleco]], entered the market. Atari Inc. suffered from an image problem when a company named [[Mystique (company)|Mystique]] produced a number of [[pornography|pornographic]] games for the 2600. The most notorious of these, ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'', caused a large number of protests from women's and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarihq.com/2678/3party/mystique.html |title=AGH - Third Party Profile: Mystique |publisher=AtariHQ.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it depicts [[George Armstrong Custer|General George Armstrong Custer]] raping a bound Native American woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fragmaster |url=http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&amp;id=282 |title=Custer's Revenge |publisher=Classic Gaming |accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atari Inc. sued Mystique in court over the release of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Lauren |last=Gonzalez |url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6090892/p-3.html |title=When Two Tribes Go to War: A History of Video Game Controversy |page=3 |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atari Inc. continued to scoop up licenses during the shelf life of the 2600, the most prominent of which included ''[[Pac-Man (Atari 2600)|Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (Atari 2600)|E.T.]]'' Public disappointment with these two titles and the market saturation of poor third-party titles are cited as big reasons for the [[video game crash of 1983]]. Suddenly, Atari Inc.'s growth meant it was losing massive amounts of money during the crash, at one point about $10,000 a day. Warner quickly grew tired of supporting Atari Inc., and started looking for buyers in 1984. Although not formally discontinued, the 2600 was de-emphasized for two years after Warner's 1984 sale of Atari Inc.'s Consumer Division to [[Commodore Business Machines]] founder [[Jack Tramiel]], who wanted to concentrate on [[home computer]]s. He froze all development of console games, including a [[Garfield (Atari 2600)|2600 ''Garfield'' game]] and an Atari 5200 port of ''[[Super Pac-Man]]''.

==== Atari 2600 Jr. ====

[[File:Atari-2600-Jr-Console.jpg|thumb|225px|right|The Atari 2600 in its 1984 cost-reduced version, also known as the &quot;2600 Jr.&quot;]]
In 1985, a new version of the 2600 was released (although it was planned for release two years earlier). The new redesigned version of the 2600, unofficially referred to as the 2600 Jr., featured a smaller cost-reduced form factor with a modernized [[Atari 7800]]-like appearance. The redesigned 2600 was advertised as a budget gaming system (under $50) that had the ability to run a large collection of classic games. With its introduction came a resurgence in software development both from Atari Corp. and from a few third parties (notably, [[Activision]], [[Absolute Entertainment]], [[Froggo]], [[Epyx]], and Exus). The Atari 2600 continued to sell in the USA and Europe until 1991, and in Asia until the early 1990s. Its final Atari-licensed release was [[Klax (computer game)|KLAX]] in 1990. Over its lifetime, an estimated 40 million units were shipped, and its [[List of Atari 2600 games|video game library]] reportedly numbers more than 900 titles with commercial games released for this system all the way until 1991. In [[Brazil]], the console became extremely popular in the mid-1980s. The Atari 2600 was officially retired by Atari Corp. on January 1, 1992,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} making it the longest-lived home video game console (14 years, 2 months) in Video game history.

The system was promoted on a [[United Kingdom]] TV ad in 1989 in the run-up to Christmas, in which it claimed ''The fun is back!'', although the games were very much dated even compared to the [[Sega Mega Drive]], [[Nintendo NES]] and [[Sega Master System]] which were the main interest at the time. The advertising campaign also used its price of under £50 as a selling point. However, despite this the games system still failed in competition to the more modern systems. The advert was also a re-dubbed version of the early original campaign in the [[United States]].

== Design ==
=== Hardware ===
{{Main|Atari 2600 hardware}}
[[File:Atari-2600-Joystick.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Standard joystick]]
The CPU was the [[MOS Technology 6507]], a cut-down version of the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]], running at 1.19 [[megahertz|MHz]] in the 2600. The 6507 included fewer memory address pins—13 instead of 16—and no external interrupts to fit into a smaller 28-pin package. Smaller packaging was, and still is, an important factor in overall system cost, and since memory was very expensive at the time, the 6507's small 8&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]] of maximum external memory space was not going to be used up anyway. In fact, memory was so expensive they could not imagine using up even 4&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]], and when they got a deal on 24-pin connectors for the cartridge socket, they were only too happy to thereby limit the games to 4K.&lt;ref name=&quot;cartridge-socket&quot;&gt;The cartridge connector's 24 pins were allocated to one supply voltage line, two ground lines, 8 data lines, and 13 address lines. However, the uppermost address line was used as a so-called [[chip select]] for the cartridge's ROM chip, leaving only 12 address lines for the chip's game program. Thus, without special &quot;hardware tricks&quot; built into the cartridge, an Atari 2600 game could occupy a maximum address space of 4K.&lt;/ref&gt; Later games got around this limitation with [[bank switching]].

The console had only 128 [[byte]]s of [[random-access memory|RAM]] for [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]] data that included the [[call stack]] and the state of the game world. There was no [[frame buffer]], as the necessary RAM would have been too expensive. Instead the video device had two [[bitmap]]ped [[sprite (graphics)|sprites]], two one-pixel &quot;missile&quot; sprites, a one-pixel &quot;ball,&quot; and a 40-pixel &quot;playfield&quot; that was drawn by writing a bit pattern for each line into a register just before the television scanned that line. As each line was scanned, a game had to identify the non-sprite objects that overlapped the next line, assemble the appropriate bit patterns to draw for those objects, and write the pattern into the register. In a telling reveal of its Pong heritage, by default, the right side of the screen was a mirrored duplicate of the left; to control it separately, the software had to modify the patterns as the scan line was drawn. After the controller scanned the last active line, a more leisurely [[vertical blanking interval]] began, during which the game could process input and update the positions and states of objects in the world. Any mistake in timing produced visual artifacts, a problem programmers called ''racing the beam''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RacingTheBeam&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The video hardware gave the 2600 a reputation as one of the most complex machines in the world to program, but those programmers who understood it realized that such direct control over the video picture was also a source of flexibility. One advantage the 2600 had over more powerful competitors such as the [[ColecoVision]] was that the 2600 had no protection against altering settings in mid-line. For example, although each sprite nominally had only one color, it was possible to color the rows differently by changing the sprite's color as it was drawn. If the two hardware sprites were not enough for a game, a developer could share one sprite among several objects (as with the ghosts in ''[[Pac-Man (Atari 2600)|Pac-Man]]'') or draw software sprites, which was only a little more difficult than drawing a fixed playfield. The ''[[Pitfall!]]'' screenshot below demonstrates some of these tricks: the player is a multi-color sprite, one sprite is multiplexed for the logs and the scorpion, and the swinging vine is drawn by shifting the position of the &quot;ball&quot; on each scan line. Despite the hardware limitations, many Atari 2600 games have a lot of action on the screen, creating an engaging experience.

Additionally, the 2600 supported several types of input devices (joysticks, paddles, keyboards, etc.) and third-party peripherals, and many of these peripherals were interchangeable with the ''[[MSX]]'' and several other Japanese systems. In some cases, it is possible to use the Atari joysticks with the [[Sega Master System]] and [[Sega Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]], though functionality may be limited. Conversely, Master System and Genesis controllers work quite well on the 2600.

=== Color and graphics ===
{{Main|Television Interface Adapter}}

The Atari 2600 used different color palettes depending on the television signal format used.&lt;ref&gt;Atari 2600 [http://www.biglist.com/lists/stella/archives/200109/msg00285.html &quot;TIA color chart&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; With the NTSC format, a 128-color palette was available, while in PAL, only 104 colors were available. Additionally, the [[SECAM]] palette consisted of only 8 colors.

== Legacy ==
=== Atari 2000 ===

The '''Atari 2000''' (model number CX-2000) is a [[prototype]] version of the Atari 2600 intended to be released as a cheaper alternative for children in 1982. Although identical in specification to the original 2600, the 2000 included built-in controllers and a different case design. The 2000 was originally intended to be black, but it was later recolored blue to appeal more to children. While Atari never officially stated the reason for not releasing the 2000, experts have cited the poor quality and durability of its built-in joysticks and the greater in-house popularity of the competing 2600jr design as the most likely reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;atari2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Curt Vendel |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/2000/a2000.html |title=The Atari CX-2000 Prototype |publisher=Atari Museum |accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atari 3200 ===

Atari started work on a replacement to the 2600, called the '''Atari 3200''', with codenames including Super Stella, Sylvia, and PAM (a note attached reads &quot;Super Stella: Multipurpose&quot;). The system was to have compatibility with Atari 2600 cartridges, and was based on a 10-bit processor. It was still unfinished when preliminary game programmers discovered that it was difficult to program. The project was cancelled, and Atari went with the second &quot;System X&quot; also titled PAM, that would later become the [[Atari 5200]]. Atari also cloned the Atari 3200 into the Sears Super Arcade II, but this was never released.&lt;ref name=&quot;sylvia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/sylvia/sylvia.html |title=The Atari 3200: Super-Stella/Sylvia |publisher=Atari Museum |accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clones and reissues ===

The console and its old and new games are very popular with collectors because of its significant impact on video game and consumer electronics history and also due to its nostalgic value for many people, along with a number of games that are still considered highly playable. In addition, modern Atari 2600 clones remain on the market. One example is the Atari Classics 10-in-1 TV Game, manufactured by [[Jakks Pacific]], which simulates the 2600 console, and includes converted versions of 10 games into a single Atari-brand-look-a-like joystick with [[composite video]] outputs for connecting directly to modern televisions or VCRs. Another is the [[TV Boy]], which includes 127 games in an enlarged joypad.

The [[Atari Flashback 2]] console, released in 2005, contains 40 games (with four more programs unlockable by a [[cheat code]]). The console implements the original 2600 architecture and can be modified to play original 2600 cartridges by adding a cartridge port, and is compatible with original 2600 controllers.

Additionally, [[Benjamin Heckendorn]] has created several different versions of a portable 2600, created by cutting apart full-sized vintage units, adding screens and putting them into new enclosures.

=== In music ===

Many games for the Atari 2600 have detailed and easily identifiable music, and its distinctive sound makes it ideal for use in modern [[lo-fi]] and [[industrial music]]. In 2002, [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] musician and visual artist [[Paul Slocum]] developed a cartridge called [[Synthcart]] for the Atari 2600, which allows the user to turn an Atari 2600 into a two-voice synthesizer and drum machine. Adapters have also been developed by amateurs enabling the Atari 2600's use with [[MIDI]] devices. A number of bands, such as [[8 Bit Weapon]], [[MIKE BISON]], [[Bud Melvin]], [[TEMPHUiBIS]], [[Black Moth Super Rainbow]] and The Squigs, as well as Slocum's own band [[Tree Wave]], use Synthcart to make modern music on the Atari 2600.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Some [[effects units]] like the [[MXR Blue Box]] are often cited for their ability to produce an Atari-like sound. Phonte from the hip-hop group [[Little Brother (band)|Little Brother]], along with fellow lyricist Eccentric, formed a mock-group named Unheralded Symmetrics, and recorded a tribute to the system, entitled &quot;Atari 2600&quot;.

=== Emulation ===
{{Ref improve section|date=March 2010}}
Atari 2600 emulation is available for most major [[operating system]]s and is now very accurate. Despite the relative simplicity of the 2600 system, it is not an easy system to emulate. While it does not require a lot of computational power to emulate the 2600, it is hard to accurately do so. For example, because of the lack of a [[frame buffer]], 2600 [[Video game console emulator|emulators]] must not only emulate the console, but the television as well. Due to the longevity of the system, many 2600 games used undocumented features, and even exploited bugs in the [[Computer hardware|hardware]] to squeeze the most out of the system, doing things even the original designers would deem impossible (a notable example is the starfield of the game ''[[Cosmic Ark]]''). It took some time for the emulator programmers to mature their software to properly emulate the undocumented features, bugs and quirks of the system.

The [[MESS]] emulator supports recording and playing back of Atari 2600 emulation sessions. The Home Action Replay Page&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeactionreplay.org/search.php?tourney=7 Home Action Replay Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (aka HARP) allows Atari 2600 users to archive their favorite play sessions of the Atari 2600 system and its games.

Some well known Atari 2600 emulators today are:

* [[Stella (emulator)|Stella]] - An [[open source]], [[multiplatform]] emulator ([[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], [[Dreamcast]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[Wii]], [[GP2X]]).
* [[z26]] – Another open source, multiplatform customizable emulator (Windows, [[MS-DOS]], Linux)
* [[PC Atari Emulator]] – Easy to use, very fast emulator (Windows, MS-DOS). Handles the Cosmic Ark starfield effect correctly.
* [[MESS]] – the multi system emulator that supports all old Atari console systems
* The Pocket VCS – PPC – Easy to use, very fast and emulator (Windows Mobile).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}
* GP2X-2600 – An emulator for the [[GP2X]] handheld console

=== Homebrews ===
{{Main|Atari 2600 homebrew}}
[[File:Thrust InGame.png|thumb|right|Thomas Jentzsch's ''Thrust'', a homebrew game for the Atari 2600]]

After 30 years since the launch of the Atari 2600, new homebrew games for the system are still made and sold by hobbyists with several new titles available each year. Most of the development on the platform is still done in [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] [[Assembly Language|assembly language]] but a [[BASIC]]-like language compiler named [[Atari 2600 homebrew#batari Basic|batari Basic]] (or &quot;bB&quot;) and visual environment called [[Visual batari Basic]] are also available.

Games created for the Atari can be executed using either an emulator or copied directly to a blank cartridge making use of either a [[Programmable read-only memory|PROM]] or [[EPROM]] chip. This allows the construction of homebrew cartridges that will run on an original Atari 2600.

The '''Atari 5200 SuperSystem''', commonly known as the '''Atari 5200''', is a [[video game console]] that was introduced in 1982 by Atari Inc. as a higher end complementary console for the popular [[Atari 2600]].&lt;ref name=&quot;milwaukeesentinel&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HN0VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XRIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=929,140029&amp;dq=atari+5200&amp;hl=en |title=The Atari 5200 will be available in October |publisher=The Milwaukee Sentinel |date=1982-09-01 |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5200 was created to compete with the [[Intellivision]], but wound up more directly competing with the [[ColecoVision]] shortly after its release.&lt;ref&gt;G4TV's Icons season 2 episode 1 &quot;Atari&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5200 was based on Atari Inc.'s existing [[Atari 8-bit family|400/800]] computers and the internal hardware was almost identical, although software was not directly compatible between the two systems. The 5200's controllers feature an analog joystick and a numeric keypad along with start, pause and reset buttons. The 360-degree non-centering joystick was touted as offering more control than the four-position joystick controller offered with the Atari 2600.

In August 2009, video game website [[IGN]] placed the 5200 23rd out of the 25 greatest video game consoles of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top-25-consoles/23.html |title=Atari 5200 is number 23 |publisher=IGN |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware==
Much of the technology in the [[Atari 8-bit family]] of [[home computer]] systems were originally developed as a second-generation games console intended to replace the 2600. However, as the system was reaching completion, the [[personal computer]] revolution was starting with the release of machines like the [[Commodore PET]], [[TRS-80]] and [[Apple II]]. These machines were similar in technological terms to the 2600, but sold for much higher prices with associated higher profit margins. Atari's management decided to enter this market, and the new technology was repackaged into the Atari 400 and 800, hitting the market in 1979.

In the early 1980s a second wave of games consoles came to market, notably the Intellivision and numerous other announcements and releases. Being behind the technological curve was not entirely surprising; the chipset used in the 400 and 800 was designed because they were aware the 2600 would be obsolete by the 1980 time frame. What was surprising was the sudden entry into the market of new competition, whose machines quickly cut off the sales of the 2600. Atari decided to re-enter the games market with a design that closely matched their original 1978 specifications. In its prototype stage, the Atari 5200 was originally called the &quot;Atari Video System X - Advanced Video Computer System&quot;, and was codenamed &quot;Pam&quot; after a female employee at Atari Inc. It is also rumored that PAM actually stood for &quot;Personal Arcade Machine&quot;, as the majority of games for the system ended up being arcade conversions. Actual working ''Atari Video System X'' machines, whose hardware is 100% identical to the Atari 5200 do exist, but they are extremely rare.&lt;ref name=&quot;vsx&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Curt Vendel |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5200/vsx.html |title=Video System X |publisher=Atarimuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial 1982 release of the system featured four controller ports, where nearly all other systems of the day had only two ports. The 5200 also featured a revolutionary new controller with an analog [[joystick]], numeric keypad, two fire buttons on each side of the controller and game function keys for Start, Pause, and Reset. The 5200 also featured the innovation of the first automatic TV switchbox, allowing it to automatically switch from regular TV viewing to the game system signal when the system was activated.  Previous RF adapters required the user to slide a switch on the adapter by hand. This unique [[radio frequency|RF]] box was also where the power supply connected in a unique dual power/television signal setup similar to the [[RCA Studio II]]'s. A single cable coming out of the 5200 plugged into the switch box and was used for both electricity and the television signal.

The 1983 revision of the Atari 5200 has two controller ports instead of four, and a change back to the more conventional separate power supply and standard non-autoswitching RF switch. It also has changes in the cartridge port address lines to allow for the [[Atari 2600]] adapter released that year. While the adapter was only made to work on the two-port version, modifications can be made to the four-port to make it line-compatible. In fact, towards the end of the four-port model's production run, there were a limited number of consoles produced which included these modifications. These consoles can be identified by an asterisk in their serial number.

==Controllers==
The controller prototypes used in the electrical development lab used a yoke and gimbal mechanism that came from an RC airplane controller kit. This simple design gave very nice smooth linear control and was highly reliable. The production controllers were quite different and a great disappointment to the electrical and software development teams. The design of the [[analog stick|analog joystick]], which used a weak rubber boot rather than springs to provide centering, proved to be ungainly and unreliable. They ultimately alienated consumers and quickly became the [[Achilles' heel]] of the system because of their combination of an overly complex mechanical design with a very low-cost internal flex circuit system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Another major flaw of the controllers was that the design did not translate into a linear acceleration from the center through the arc of the stick travel. The controllers did, however, include a pause button, a unique feature at the time. Various third party replacement joysticks were also released, including those made by Wico.

Atari Inc. released the Pro-Line [[trackball|Trak-Ball]] controller for the system, which was used primarily for gaming titles such as [[Centipede]] or [[Defender]].  A paddle controller&lt;ref name=&quot;paddle&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Curt Vendel |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5200/5200paddle.html |title=Atari 5200 Paddle Controller Prototypes |publisher=Atarimuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an updated self-centering version of the original controller&lt;ref name=&quot;selfcenter&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Curt Vendel |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5200/5200joy.html |title=Self Centering Joystick Prototypes |publisher=Atarimuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also in development, but never made it to market.

The primary controller was ranked the 10th worst video game controller by [[IGN]] editor [[Craig Harris (journalist)|Craig Harris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 10 Tuesday: Worst Game Controllers |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/690/690449p1.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-08-07 |date=2006-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal differences between the 5200 and the 400/800==
Although the Atari 5200's internal design was extensively based on that of the 400/800 home computers, the differences were sufficient that games designed for one would not run directly on the other.

One of the most obvious differences was the 5200's lack of a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]]. However, there were several others:
* The [[Atari 8-bit family#Operating system|400/800's 10&amp;nbsp;KB operating system]] was replaced with a simpler 2&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] BIOS, of which 1&amp;nbsp;KB is the built-in character set.&lt;ref name=&quot;converting&quot;&gt;[http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5200/conv_to_5200.html Transporting Atari computer programs to the Atari 5200], [[A.N.A.L.O.G.]] #15 (January 1984), via atarimuseum.com. Article retrieved 2007-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A number of important registers, such as those of the [[Atari 8-bit TIA|GTIA]] and [[POKEY]] chips appear at different memory locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;converting&quot; /&gt;
* The purpose of some registers changed slightly on the 5200.&lt;ref name=&quot;converting&quot; /&gt;
* The 5200's analog joysticks required different input handling to the traditional digital joystick input on the 400/800. (However, the 5200 reassigned/rewired two of the 400/800's existing analog [[Paddle (game controller)|paddle]] registers for each bi-directional analog joystick input).&lt;ref name=&quot;converting&quot; /&gt;

Atari Corp.'s later [[XEGS|XE Games System]] revisited the idea of a console based on the 400/800 hardware. However, as this was essentially just a 65XE computer with a detachable keyboard, it was able to run most of the home computer titles directly.

==Market Performance==
The Atari 5200 did not fare well commercially, compared to its predecessor, the Atari 2600.&lt;ref name=&quot;TEI&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

(A revised 2-port model was released in 1983, along with a game adapter that allowed gamers to play all 2600 games.)  The 5200's pack-in game, ''[[Super Breakout|Super-Breakout]]'', was also criticized for not doing enough to demonstrate the graphics and sound capabilities of the console, as compared to the Colecovision's pack-in game ''[[Donkey Kong]]''.{{fact|date=January 2011}}

During its lifetime, Atari paid relatively little attention to the 5200, instead dedicating most of its resources to continuing to develop games for the saturated Atari 2600 market.&lt;ref name=&quot;UHVG5200&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

At one point following the 5200's release, Atari had planned a smaller, cost-reduced version of the Atari 5200, which would have gotten rid of the controller storage bin. Code-named the &quot;Atari 5100&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Atari 5200 Jr.&quot;), only a few fully working prototype 5100s were made before the project was canceled.&lt;ref name=&quot;jr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Curt Vendel |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5100/5100.html |title=5100/5200 Jr |publisher=Atarimuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 1984, during a press conference at which the [[Atari 7800]] was introduced, company executives revealed that the 5200 had been discontinued after just two years on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Sanger | first=David E. | journal=New York Times | title=Atari Video Game Unit Introduced | page=3 (Section D) | date=1984-05-22 | quote=Company officials disclosed for the first time yesterday that the 5200 is no longer in production, and Atari appears to be selling off its inventory. | postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Total sales of the 5200 were reportedly in excess of 1 million units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Schrage | first=Michael | journal=Washington Post | title=Atari Introduces Game In Attempt for Survival | page=C3 | date=1984-05-22 | quote=The company has stopped producing its 5200 SuperSystem games player, more than 1 million of which were sold. | postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Atari 7800 ProSystem''', or simply the '''Atari 7800''', is a [[video game console]] re-released by [[Atari Corporation]] in January 1986. The original release had occurred two years earlier under [[Atari, Inc|Atari Inc]]. The 7800 had originally been designed to replace Atari Inc.'s [[Atari 5200]] in [[1984]], but was temporarily shelved due to the sale of the company after the [[video game crash]]. In [[January]] [[1986]], the 7800 was again released and would compete that year with the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and the [[Sega Master System]]. 
It had simple digital [[joystick]]s; it was almost fully [[Backward compatibility|backward-compatible]] with the [[Atari 2600]]; and it was considered affordable at a price of US$140.

In 2009, [[IGN]] chose the 7800 to be their 17th best video game console of all time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/top-25-consoles/17.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
 
The Atari 7800 ProSystem was the first game system from Atari Inc. designed by an outside company, [[General Computer Corporation]] (GCC). The system had been designed in 1983 through 1984 with an intended mass market rollout in June 1984, but was canceled shortly thereafter due to the sale of the company to [[Jack Tramiel|Tramiel Technology Ltd]] on July 2, 1984. The project was originally called the Atari 3600, though was later renamed the Atari 7800.

Several key factors influenced the design of the 7800. First, Atari had been facing mounting pressure from the [[ColecoVision]], which boasted graphics that more closely mirrored [[arcade games]] of the time than Atari’s reigning 2600 VCS system. Second, the Atari 5200 (the original intended successor to the Atari 2600 VCS) had been widely criticized for not being able to play Atari 2600 VCS games without an adapter. Finally, dropping prices of [[home computer]]s like the [[Commodore 64]] had caused many to believe that buying a home computer was a better investment because it provided more detailed gameplay and could be used for other purposes such as [[word processing]]. 

Previous game consoles sometimes had a difficult time replicating the arcade experience in home versions of popular [[arcade game]]s. In particular, home versions of arcade games sometimes had problems with flickering and slow down when more than a few moving objects appeared on the screen at once. GCC, which had a background in creating arcade games, designed their new system with a graphical architecture similar to arcade machines of the time. The 7800 featured the ability to move around a tremendous amount of objects (75-to-100) that far exceeded previous consoles. Powering the system was an Atari SALLY [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] (Atari's slightly custom 6502, sometimes described as a &quot;6502C&quot;) processor running at 1.79&amp;nbsp;MHz, similar to the processor found in home computers ([[Atari 8-bit]], [[Apple II series|Apple II]], Commodore 64) and other consoles (Atari 5200 and [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]).

In response to the criticisms of the Atari 5200, the Atari 7800 could play almost all Atari 2600 games out of the box, without the need for an adapter. In addition, it featured a return to a digital controller.

To address the concerns of parents that home computers were a better investment than consoles, the system was designed to be upgraded to a full-fledged home computer. A keyboard was developed, and the keyboard had an expansion port (which was the SIO port from Atari's 8-bit computer line, though the 7800 could not run Atari computer programs) allowed for the addition of peripherals such as disk drives and printers. 

To enhance the gaming experience further, GCC had also designed a 'high score cartridge,' a battery-backed [[RAM]] cartridge designed for storing game scores. On the side of the 7800 was an expansion port, reportedly for a planned connection with a [[laserdisc]] player.

=== Launch ===
The 7800 was initially released in southern [[California]] in June 1984{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, following an announcement on May 21, 1984 at the Summer [[Consumer Electronics Show]].&lt;ref name=&quot;press release&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title=Atari unveils advanced video game that is expandable to introductory computer |publisher=Atari, Inc. |url=http://www.atari7800.org/museum/PressDoc1s.htm |accessdate=2010-04-30 |date=1984-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 13 games were announced for the system's launch, including ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Pole Position II]]'', [[Centipede (video game)|''Centipede'']], [[Joust (video game)|''Joust'']], ''[[Dig Dug]]'', ''[[Desert Falcon]]'', ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'', ''[[Galaga]]'', ''[[Xevious]]'', [[Food Fight (video game)|''Food Fight'']], ''[[Ballblazer]]'', ''[[Rescue on Fractalus!]]'', and [[Track &amp; Field (arcade game)|''Track and Field'']]. Atari was a sponsor of the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] and planned to push the 7800 aggressively in time for Christmas that year.

One month later, [[Time Warner|Warner Communications]] sold Atari's Consumer Division to [[Jack Tramiel]]. All projects were halted during an initial evaluation period. 

The Atari 7800 languished on warehouse shelves until it was re-introduced in January 1986 after strong 2600 sales the previous Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tnca.myrmid.com/art9.htm Atari, Sega, and Nintendo Plan Comeback for Video Games - HFD: The Weekly Home Furnishings Newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;

Atari's launch of the 7800 under Tramiel was far more subdued than Warner had planned for the system in 1984 with a marketing budget of just $300,000. Additionally, the keyboard and high score cartridge were canceled, the expansion port was removed from later production runs of the system and, in lieu of new titles, the system was launched with titles intended for the 7800's debut in 1984.

=== Marketplace challenges ===

At the time, a key driver for success with a home console was the number of home conversions it had of popular arcade games. This had been a primary reason for the success of the Atari 2600 VCS against systems like the [[Intellivision]].

During the Atari 7800’s life cycle, Atari found themselves struggling to get developers to create 7800 versions of then-popular arcade titles because of a controversial policy employed by Nintendo. When Nintendo revived the industry, they signed up software development companies to create NES games under a strict license agreement which imposed serious restrictions on what they were allowed to do. One of the key clauses was that companies who made Nintendo games were not allowed to make that game on a competing system for a period of two years. Because of the market success of the NES, companies chose to develop for it first and were thus barred from developing the same games on competing systems for two years. The software libraries of the Atari 7800 and Sega Master System suffered tremendously as a result.

Some NES titles were developed by companies who had licensed their title from a different arcade manufacturer. While the creator of the NES version would be restricted from making a competitive version of an NES game, the original arcade copyright holder was not precluded from licensing out rights for a home version of an arcade game to multiple systems. Through this loophole, Atari 7800 conversions of ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Double Dragon]]'', ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'', ''[[Rampage (video game)|Rampage]]'', ''[[Xenophobe (video game)|Xenophobe]]'', ''[[Ikari Warriors]]'' and ''[[Kung Fu Master]]'' were licensed and developed.

Third party development for the 7800 was limited as most game companies were locked into exclusive agreements with Nintendo for the NES. 11 titles were developed and sold by three third-party companies under their own labels for the 7800 ([[Absolute Entertainment]], [[Activision]], and [[Froggo]]) with the rest published by Atari themselves. However, most Atari development was contracted out.

=== Demise ===
The Atari 7800 remained officially active between 1986 and 1991. On January 1, 1992, Atari Corp. formally announced that production of the Atari 7800, the Atari 2600, the Atari 8-bit computer line, and the Atari XE Game System would cease. By the time of the cancellation, Nintendo's NES dominated the North American market, controlling 80% while Atari Corp. controlled just 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DD143EF935A25756C0A964958260 | work=The New York Times | title=COMPANY NEWS; Nintendo Suit by Atari Is Dismissed | date=May 16, 1992 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Despite trailing the Nintendo Entertainment System in terms of number of units sold, the 7800 was a profitable enterprise for Atari Corp., benefiting largely from Atari’s name and the system's 2600 compatibility. Profits were strong due to low investment in game development and marketing. Nonetheless, the 7800 failed to help Atari regain its dominance in the videogame industry.

=== Graphics ===
The graphics are generated by a custom [[Graphics Processing Unit]] called MARIA which is very different from other second and third generation consoles, and made it more difficult for game programmers to make the transition. Instead of a limited number of hardware sprites, the MARIA allows for a much larger number of sprites described in a list of display lists. Each display list contains sprite entries with pointers to graphics data, color information, and horizontal positioning. The same display list is used for multiple rasters with the pointers being automatically adjusted. However, managing and displaying a large number of sprites required much more [[CPU]] time (both directly and indirectly since the MARIA would halt the CPU when drawing sprites) than consoles with hardware sprites and backgrounds. 

MARIA has a number of different graphics modes which are either 160 pixels wide or 320 pixels wide. While the 320 pixel modes theoretically enable the 7800 to create games at higher resolution than the 256 pixel wide graphics found in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Sega Master System]], the intense processing demands of MARIA typically meant that programmers created their games using the lower 160 pixel modes. 

The 7800 features a broad (for its time) palette of 256 colors. Depending on various parameters, each individual sprite can use from 1 to 12 colors, with 3 colors (plus a 4th &quot;transparency&quot; color) being the most common. In this format, the sprite is referenced to one of 8 palettes, where each palette holds 3 assignable colors. There is also an assignable background color, which will be visible wherever another object has not covered it up. In total the system can utilize 25 colors on a scanline at one time.&lt;ref name=&quot;atarimuseum.com&quot;&gt;http://www.atarimuseum.com/ahs_archives/archives/archives-techdocs-7800.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphics resolution, color palette assignments, and background color can be adjusted in between scanlines. Although it is a more advanced programming technique, this isn't really a &quot;trick&quot;. The designers deliberately included this feature, and documented its use in the original 1983 &quot;Atari 3600 Software Guide&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;atarimuseum.com&quot;/&gt; Games often used this feature to render high resolution text in one area of the screen, while displaying more colorful graphics with less resolution in the gameplay area. Demos also exist which use this feature to place all 256 colors on the screen at the same time.

The MARIA’s approach had advantages and disadvantages when it came to generating graphics in software during the lifespan of the 7800. It excelled at moving around large numbers of sprites on a static screen without the screen flickering that plagued other 8-bit systems. Its flexible design enabled it to play games which used display list manipulation to generate a pseudo 3D appearance such as ''[[Ballblazer]]'' (1987) and ''F-18 Hornet'' (1988). While side-scrolling games in the vein of ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' are possible on the system (1990's ''Scrapyard Dog'' is the best example), it is significantly harder to develop such a title than on a tile-based system such as the Nintendo Entertainment System.

=== Sound ===

A common criticism of the 7800 regards its use of the TIA to provide 2-channel sound effects and music, resulting in sound quality that is virtually identical to the Atari 2600 VCS from 1977. While the inclusion of 2600 hardware is required to maintain compatibility with the older system, this drove up production costs and reduced available space on the 7800’s motherboard. As such, the 7800 does not include additional hardware for generating sound as it does with graphics and the sound hardware is considered the weakest part of the system. 

To compensate for this, GCC’s engineers allowed games to include a [[Atari POKEY|POKEY audio chip]] in the cartridge which substantially improved the audio quality. To ensure software developers had an economical means of producing better sound than TIA, GCC had originally planned to make a low-cost, high performance sound chip, GUMBY, which could also be placed in 7800 cartridges to enhance its sound capabilities further. This project was cancelled when Atari was sold to Jack Tramiel. 

Despite having the capability to support sound chips in cartridges, almost no 7800 cartridges feature POKEY hardware for enhanced sound. ''Ballblazer'', released in 1987, uses the POKEY to generate all music and sound effects. Similarly, ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'', released in 1989, uses a POKEY to generate in-game music while the TIA generates the game's sound effects for a total of 6 channels of sound.

=== Lockout features ===

Following the debate over ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'', an Atari 2600 VCS title with adult themes, Atari had concerns over similar adult titles finding their way onto the 7800 and displaying adult graphics on the significantly improved graphics of the MARIA chip. To combat this, they included a digital signature protection method which prevented unauthorized 7800 games from being played on the system. 

When a cartridge was inserted into the system, the 7800 BIOS included code which would generate a digital signature of the cartridge ROM and compare it to the signature stored on the cartridge. If a correct signature was located on the cartridge, the 7800 would operate in 7800 mode, granting the game access to MARIA and other features. If a signature was not located, the 7800 remained in 2600 mode and MARIA was unavailable. All 7800 games released in North America had to be digitally signed by Atari. This digital signature code is not present in PAL 7800s, which use various heuristics to detect 2600 cartridges, due to export restrictions.

=== Backward compatibility ===
The Atari 7800 differs from the 2600 in several key areas. It features a full Atari SALLY 6502 processor whereas the 2600 VCS has a stripped down 6507 processor running at a slower speed. It has additional [[RAM]] (Random Access Memory) and the ability to access more cartridge data at one time than the 2600. The most substantial difference, however, is a graphics architecture which differs markedly from either the Atari 2600 VCS or Atari’s 8-bit line of computers. 

The 7800's compatibility with the Atari 2600 is made possible by including many of the same chips used in the Atari 2600. When operating in “2600” mode to play Atari 2600 titles, the 7800 uses a Television Interface Adapter (TIA) chip to generate graphics and sound. The processor is slowed to 1.19&amp;nbsp;MHz, enabling the 7800 to mirror the performance of the 2600s stripped-down 6507 processor. RAM is limited to 128 bytes found in the RIOT and game data is accessed in 4K blocks. 

When in “7800” mode (signified by the appearance of the full screen Atari logo), the graphics are generated entirely by the MARIA graphics processing unit, all system RAM is available and game data is accessed in larger 48K blocks. The system’s SALLY 6502 runs at its normal 1.79&amp;nbsp;MHz instead of the reduced speed of 2600 mode. The 2600 chips are used in 7800 mode to generate sound as well as switch and controller interfaces.

===System revisions===
Prototypes:
*Atari 3600, original model number
*Atari CX-9000 Video Computer System

Production:
*Atari CX7800, two joystick ports on lower front panel. Side expansion port for upgrades and add-ons. Bundled accessories included two CX24 Pro-Line joysticks, AC adapter, switchbox, RCA connecting cable, and [[Pole Position II]] cartridge.
*Atari CX7800, second revision. Slightly revised motherboard, added an additional timing circuit. Expansion port connector removed from motherboard but is still etched. Shell has indentation of where expansion port was to be.
*Atari CX7800, third revision. Same as above but with only a small blemish on the shell where the expansion port was.

== Peripherals ==
[[Image:Atari7800manette.png|thumb|200px|The [[gamepad]] of the Atari 7800.]]
The Atari 7800 came bundles with the Atari Proline Joystick a two button controller with a joystick for movement. In response to criticism over ergonomic issues in the 7800’s Pro-Line controllers, Atari later released joypad controllers with European 7800s, which were similar in style to controllers found on Nintendo and Sega Systems. The Joypad was not available in the United States.

Unlike the NES or Sega Master System, there were few add-on peripherals for the 7800, though its backwards compatibility feature allowed it to be compatible with most Atari 2600 peripherals. 

The most notable exception was the XG-1 lightgun, which came bundled with the Atari XE Game System. The XG-1 was fully compatible with the 7800 and was sold separately for other Atari systems. Atari released four 7800 light gun games: ''[[Alien Brigade]]'', ''[[Crossbow (video game)|Crossbow]]'', ''[[Meltdown (video game)|Meltdown]]'', and ''[[Barnyard Blaster]]''.

=== Canceled peripherals ===
Due to the acquisition of the Atari Consumer Division by Jack Tramiel in 1984, a number of planned peripherals for the system were canceled.

* The High Score Cartridge was designed to save player high scores for up to 65 separate games. The cartridge was intended as a pass-through device (similar to the later [[Game Genie]]). Nine games were programmed with the feature but the cartridge was canceled before it was released. In 1999, a limited run of cartridges were produced by Atari historian Curt Vendel using ROM code from Gary Rubio (the former Atari liaison to GCC on the Atari 7800 project). This feature has been included in many homebrew releases in recent years.

* The 7800 included an expansion port which would have allowed for the addition of a planned computer keyboard, connection to laserdisc players and other peripherals. The expansion port was removed in the second and third revisions of the 7800.

* A dual joystick holder was designed for games like ''[[Robotron 2084]]'' and future games like ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'' and others, but not produced.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

{{see also|List of Atari 7800 games|List of Atari 2600 games}}

While the 7800 can actually play hundreds of titles due to its compatibility with the Atari 2600, there was limited third party support for the 7800 and less than 100 titles were specifically designed for it.

===Unreleased games===
As with most game consoles, there were many more games in development for the 7800 than were actually released. However, very few prototypes have been located, due to Tramiel Atari’s reluctance to make them in the first place. Atari 7800 prototypes tend to be highly coveted by collectors, often fetching hundreds of dollars when sold. Some collectors are unwilling to share the rare items publicly as doing so risks decreasing the value of their prototypes.

Nonetheless, some unreleased Atari 7800 games, as well as early versions of released games have been released to the public. A few have been manufactured and sold. 

These include
*''[[Klax (video game)|Klax]]'' (Programmed by Blue Sky Software). The game was nearly completed when canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = AtariProtos.com page | url=http://www.atariprotos.com/7800/software/klax/klax.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; For years, it was traded privately until a ROM was made available to the general public. Later, the developer appeared to create additional levels for the community.
*''[[Gato (computer game)|Gato]]'' (Programmed by Ibid Inc Software). Released on the XE Game System, an Atari 7800 version was started but not completed beyond a simple demo.
*''[[Missing in Action (arcade game)|Missing in Action]]'' (Programmed by Sculptured Software for TNT Games). A side scrolling adventure that was about 85% complete when cancelled. The game is mostly playable with some later collision detection issues requiring cheats to get past.
*''[[Pit-Fighter]]'' (Programmed by Imagitec Design). An early demo of the game has been found, with crude graphics, no sound and poor collision detection.
*''[[Rescue on Fractalus!]]'' (Programmed by GCC). A conversion of the popular computer game was released by GCC in 2004. The game was partially complete with a running engine but no enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = AtariProtos.com page on RoF for Atari 7800 | url=http://www.atariprotos.com/7800/software/rof/rof.htm | accessdate = 2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Other 7800 games remain lost, despite indications that development occurred. The most notable of these are ''[[Skyfox]]'' (shown on the back of the original system box) and ''[[Electrocop]]'' (artwork has since been uncovered).

Engineering Notes list Tempest as a game that was between 15–20% completed for the Atari 7800; no code to date has been found.  The Atari Museum located and posted unreleased box art and notes for a 7800 version of Crystal Castles.  No code to date has been found for that game either.   Atari's earlier 7800 games listing showed Millipede as one of the games in the line up; however, it does not appear that it was ever started or worked on.

===Source Code Release===
The source code for 13 games, as well as the OS and development tools (for the [[Atari ST]] computer system) were discovered in a dumpster behind the Atari building in Sunnyvale, California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atarimuseum.com/whatsnew/2009-JUN-11.html AtariMuseum - Site News: June 11, 2009], retrieved July 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Commented [[assembly language]] source code was made available for ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', ''Commando'', ''Crossbow'', ''Desert Falcon'', ''[[Dig Dug]]'', ''[[Food Fight (video game)|Food Fight]]'', ''[[Galaga]]'', ''[[Hat Trick (video game)|Hat Trick]]'', ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]'', ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Super Stunt Cycle]]'', ''Robotron: 2084'' and ''[[Xevious]]'' game titles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/7800/games/ &quot;7800 Games &amp; Development&quot;] at [http://www.atarimuseum.com/ The Atari History Museum website], retrieved July 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emulation and homebrew ==
When emulators of 1980s video game consoles began to appear on home computers in the late 1990s, the Atari 7800 was one of the last to be emulated. The lack of awareness of the system, the lack of understanding of the hardware, and fears about the digital signature lockout initially caused concerns. Since that time, however, the 7800 has been emulated successfully and is now common on emulation sites. One such program is ProSystem, written in C/C++ for the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1         = Kohler| first1        = Chris| authorlink1   = Chris Kohler| others        = foreword by [[Al Lowe]]| title         = Retro Gaming Hacks| edition       = 1st| date          = 2005-10-12| publisher     = [[O'Reilly Media]]| location      = Sebastopol, CA| isbn          = 0-596-00917-8| pages         = 156&amp;nbsp;–  157|chapter       = Playing Classic Console Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the Windows API and DirectX to display what it emulates in both [[PAL]] and [[NTSC]].

The digital signature long prevented homebrew games from being developed until the original encryption generating software was discovered. When the original digital signature generating software was turned over to the Atari community, development of new Atari 7800 titles began. In addition, the Atari community has slowly uncovered the original 7800 development tools and released them into the public domain. New tools, documentation, source code and utilities for development have since been created which has sponsored additional homebrew development. Several new commercial Atari 7800 titles such as Beef Drop, B*nQ, Pac Man Collection, Combat 1990, Santa Simon, and Space War have been created and released.

System compatible hardware has also been produced for the system. Among these was the Cuttle Cart II, a device that allowed the Atari 7800 to read MMC cards containing binary files of Atari 7800 programs. The Cuttle Cart II has enabled more people to play the entire 2600 and 7800 library on an original system as well as binaries of unreleased games and new homebrew titles. The Cuttle Cart II was a success by homebrew standards, selling out both production runs and commanding high prices on eBay.

A more recent development is the Atari 7800 expansion module developed by Legacy Engineering with a high scores save feature (with compatible games), additional RAM capabilities, as well as vastly improved sound capabilities using the [[POKEY]] and [[YM2151]] sound chips. The Expansion module is designed as a pass-through device that sits on top of the console and requires no system modding. The first batch of expansion modules are slated to ship May 24-27.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/7800/expansion/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atari Flashback ==
In 2004, Atari (now owned by Infogrames) released the first [[Atari Flashback]] console. This system resembled a miniature Atari 7800 and joysticks and had 20 built in games (five 7800 and fifteen 2600 titles). While the unit sold well, it was controversial among Atari fans. Atari had given the engineering firm, Legacy Engineering, extremely limited development timelines. The firm was forced to build the Flashback using [[Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clone|NES-On-A-Chip]] hardware instead of recreating the Atari 7800 hardware. As a result, the Flashback has been criticized for failing to properly replicate the actual Atari gaming experience. 

Legacy Engineering was later commissioned to create another 7800 project that was subsequently cancelled after prototypes were made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacyengineer.com/portfolio-7800.html] Legacy 7800 remade&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Atari Jaguar''' is a [[video game console]] that was released by Atari Corporation in 1993. It was the last to be marketed under the Atari brand until the release of the [[Atari Flashback]] in 2004. It was designed to surpass the [[Sega Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], and the [[Panasonic 3DO]] in processing power. Although launched one year earlier, it was eventually in competition with the [[Sega Saturn]], the [[Sony PlayStation]], and other consoles that made up the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth generation]] of video game consoles. The console was first released in [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]] on November 23, 1993, and the rest of the country in early 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaguar_NA_RD&quot; /&gt; Although it was promoted as the first 64-bit gaming system, the Jaguar proved to be a [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]] and prompted [[Atari]] to leave the home video game console market. Despite its commercial failure, the Jaguar has a dedicated fan base that produces [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew games]] for it.&lt;ref name=&quot;redundant&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | last = Goss | first = Patrick | title = Redundant gadgets (Atari Jaguar entry) | url=http://tech.uk.msn.com/features/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=6171299&amp;imageindex=5  | accessdate = 2007-10-23

==History==
The Jaguar was developed by the members of [[Flare Technology]], a company formed by [[Martin Brennan (engineer)|Martin Brennan]] and [[John Mathieson (computer scientist)|John Mathieson]]. The team had claimed that they could not only make a console superior to the [[Sega Mega Drive]] (also called the Sega Genesis) or the [[SNES]], but they could also be cost-effective.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Impressed by their work on the [[Konix Multisystem]], Atari persuaded them to close Flare and form a new company called [[Flare II]], with Atari providing the funding.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Flare II initially set to work designing two consoles for Atari Corp. One was a 32-bit architecture (codenamed &quot;[[Atari Panther|Panther]]&quot;), and the other was a 64-bit system (codenamed &quot;Jaguar&quot;); however, work on the Jaguar design progressed faster than expected, so Atari Corp. canceled the Panther project to focus on the more promising Jaguar.

The Jaguar was introduced in November 1993 at a price of $249.99,&lt;ref name=&quot;gamepro&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/111823/the-10-worst-selling-consoles-of-all-time-page-2-of-2/|title=The 10 Worst-Selling Consoles of All Time| accessdate=2008-08-01|author=Blake Snow|publisher=[[GamePro]].com|date=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; under a $500 million manufacturing deal with [[International Business Machines|IBM]]. The system was initially marketed only in the [[New York City]] and the [[San Francisco Bay]] areas, under the slogan &quot;Do the Math&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;gamepro&quot;/&gt; claiming superiority over competing 16-bit and 32-bit systems. A nationwide release followed in early 1994.

The Atari Jaguar struggled to attain a substantial user base. In 1993, Atari reported that they had shipped 17,000 units as part of the system's initial test market.&lt;ref&gt;Atari Corporation Annual Report, 1993. pp 14.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1994, Atari reported that they had sold approximately 100,000 systems and had reduced the price to improve the competitive nature of the console.&lt;ref&gt;Atari Corporation Annual Report. pp 11&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1995, Sony and Sega had entered the marketplace with competing consoles and Atari's sales declined rapidly. In their 1995 annual report, they noted:

&quot;Jaguar sales were substantially below Atari's expectations, and Atari's business and financial results were materially adversely affected in 1995 as Atari continued to invest heavily in Jaguar game development, entered into arrangements to publish certain licensed titles and reduced the retail price for its Jaguar console unit. Atari attributes the poor performance of Jaguar to a number of factors including (i) extensive delays in development of software for the Jaguar which resulted in reduced orders due to consumer concern as to when titles for the platform would be released and how many titles would ultimately be available, and (ii) the introduction of competing products by Sega and Sony in May 1995 and September 1995, respectively.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/802019/0000891618-96-000213.txt&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jaguar did earn praise with titles such as ''[[Tempest 2000]]'', ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'', and ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.atariage.com/Jaguar/history.html Atari Jaguar History]''. [[AtariAge#AtariAge (website)|AtariAge]]. Retrieved 9 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The most successful title was ''[[Alien vs Predator (Jaguar game)|Alien vs. Predator]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Atari Corporation 1994 annual report. pp 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Both it and ''Tempest 2000'' are often considered the system's defining titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamepro&quot;/&gt; With such a small library of games&lt;ref name=&quot;wired&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/multimedia/2007/05/gallery_game_history?slide=28&amp;slideView=7 | title=Console Portraits: A 40-Year Pictorial History of Gaming |accessdate=2008-03-23 |author=Greg Orlando |date=2007-05-15 |work=[[Wired News]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to challenge the incumbent 16-bit game consoles, Jaguar's appeal never grew beyond a small gaming audience.

In 2006 [[IGN]] editor [[Craig Harris (journalist)|Craig Harris]] rated the Jaguar controller as the worst ever,&lt;ref name =harris&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 10 Tuesday: Worst Game Controllers |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/690/690449p1.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-08-07 |date=2006-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticizing the complexity of the &quot;phone keypad&quot; and the [[D-subminiature|VGA-style]] connector.

Lack of titles was attributable to two main factors: the Jaguar's questionable long-term prospects among third-party game-publishers and the problematic nature of developing games for the Jaguar.  Atari had one opportunity to convince third-party developers, vital for the diversity of Jaguar's game library, with a solid retail-performance, but as things played out, post-holiday sales figures questioned the viability of Atari's business;  Atari failed to attract many third-party developers already committed to other game platforms. In addition, the Jaguar's underlying hardware was crippled by a flaw in the CPU's [[memory controller]], which prevented code execution out of system [[RAM]].  Less severe, but still annoying defects included a buggy [[UART]]. The memory controller flaw could have been mitigated by a mature code-development environment, to unburden the programmer from having to micromanage small chunks of code. Jaguar's development tools left much to the programmer's own implementation, as documentation was incomplete. Writing game-code was often an endurance exercise in the tedious [[assembly language|assembler]].

In a July 1995 interview with Next Generation Magazine, then-CEO Sam Tramiel declared that the Jaguar was as powerful, if not more powerful, than the [[Sega Saturn]], and slightly weaker than the [[Sony PlayStation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Atari's President talks back | magazine = Next Generation | date = July 1995 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of [[1995 in video gaming|1995]], Atari's revenues declined by more than half, from US$38.7 million in 1994 to $14.6 million in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;10-K405 SEC Filing, filed by ATARI CORP on 4/12/1996&quot;&gt;[http://sec.edgar-online.com/1996/04/12/00/0000891618-96-000213/Section8.asp ATARI CORP Annual Report (Regulation S-K, item 405) (10-K405) ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL C]{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1995, Atari Corp. ran early-morning [[infomercial]] advertisements with enthusiastic salesmen touting the powerful game system. The infomercials ran most of the year, but did not significantly sell the remaining stock of Jaguar systems. In its 10-K405 SEC Filing, filed April 12, 1996, Atari informed their stockholders of the truly dire nature of the Jaguar business: {{quote|From the introduction of Jaguar in late 1993 through the end of 1995, Atari sold approximately 125,000 units of Jaguar. As of December 31, 1995, Atari had approximately 100,000 units of Jaguar in inventory.&lt;ref name=&quot;10-K405 SEC Filing, filed by ATARI CORP on 4/12/1996&quot;/&gt;}} Atari had already suffered an ill-fated crash in the mid 1980s as a result of the oversaturation of the video game market by third-party developers.

Production of the Jaguar ceased after Atari Corp. merged with [[JT Storage]] in a [[reverse takeover]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jtmerger&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://contracts.onecle.com/atari/jt.mer.1996.04.08.shtml | title=Atari and JT Storage Reorganisation Plan | publisher=One Cle | accessdate=2006-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a last ditch effort to revive the Jaguar, Atari Corp. tried to play down the other two consoles by proclaiming the Jaguar was the only &quot;64-bit&quot; system.  This claim is questioned by some,&lt;ref name=&quot;usenet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.video.atari/browse_thread/thread/49a45b71cbcc0b9e/0bebc8c724042860?lnk=st&amp;q=#0bebc8c724042860|title= Jaguar 64-bit?? No.}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] ([[Motorola 68000|68000]]) and [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] executed a 32-bit instruction-set, but sent control signals to the 64-bit graphics co-processors (or &quot;graphics accelerators&quot;). Atari Corp.'s position was that the mere presence of 64-bit ALUs for graphics was sufficient to validate the claim. Design specs for the console allude to the GPU or DSP being capable of acting as a CPU, leaving the Motorola 68000 to read controller inputs. In practice, however, many developers used the Motorola 68000 to drive gameplay logic.

Over the short life of the console, several add-on peripherals were announced. However, only the ProController, the [[Atari Jaguar CD]] drive, and the JagLink (a simple two-console networking device) reached retail shelves. A voice modem&lt;ref&gt;Mowatt, Todd. ''Atari to Unleash new Jaguar CD and Jaguar III''. [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]. Issue 70. Pg 28. May 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Virtual reality|VR]] headset&lt;ref&gt;''Gaming Gossip''. [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]. Issue 70. Pg 54. May 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; (with infrared head-tracking) existed in prototype form, but were never commercialized (see [[Loki (computer)|Loki]] and [[Konix Multisystem]] for early development).

After the Atari Corporation properties were bought out by [[Hasbro Interactive]] in the late 1990s, Hasbro released the rights to the Jaguar, declaring the console an open platform and opening the doors for [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] development.&lt;ref name=&quot;hasbro&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.atariage.com/Jaguar/archives/HasbroRights.html | title=Hasbro Releases Jaguar Publishing Rights | publisher=Hasbro Interactive | accessdate=2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few developers, including [[Telegames]] and Songbird Productions, have not only released previously unfinished materials from the Jaguar's past, but also several brand new titles to satisfy the system's cult following.

In the [[United Kingdom]] in 2001, a deal was struck between [[Telegames]] and [[Game (retailer)]] to bring the Jaguar to Game's retail outlets. The machine was initially sold for £29.99 brand new and the software was ranged between £9.99 for more common games like ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Ruiner Pinball]]'', and up to £39.99 for more sought-after releases like ''[[Defender 2000]]'' and ''[[Checkered Flag]]''. The machine had a presence in the stores until 2007 when remaining consoles were sold off for £9.99 and games were sold for as low as 97p.

This deal was seen as a move to remain competitive with Game's rival at the time, [[Gamestation]] who were well known for stocking retro formats.

Imagin Systems, a manufacturer of dental imaging equipment, has since purchased the molding plates for the Jaguar's casing as with minor modification they were found to be the right size for housing their HotRod camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Atari Jaguar Revived As Dental Camera | date = January 1, 2010 | work = 1UP | url = http://www.1up.com/news/atari-jaguar-revived-dental-camera | accessdate = October 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game cartridge molds were reused to create an optional memory expansion card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = HotRod | publisher = Imagin | url = http://www.imaginsystems.com/Graphics/HotRod%20DS-final.pdf | accessdate = October 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arcade games==
[[Atari Games]] licensed the Atari Jaguar's chipset for use in its arcade games. The system, named '''COJAG''' (for &quot;Coin-Op Jaguar&quot;), replaced the [[68000]] with a [[68020]] or [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] R3000-based CPU (depending on the board version), and added a hard drive and more RAM. It ran the lightgun games ''[[Area 51 (arcade game)|Area 51]]'' and ''[[Maximum Force]]''. Other games (''3 On 3 Basketball''; ''Fishin' Frenzy''; ''Freeze''; ''Vicious Circle'') were developed but never released.

==Technical specifications==
[[Image:Atari jaguar controller.jpg|thumb|200px|The Atari Jaguar's [[gamepad]] was criticized for complexity of design.&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;]]

From the Jaguar Software Reference manual:&lt;ref name=atarimanual&gt;{{cite book | first = Atari Corp. | title = Jaguar Software Reference Manual - Version 2.4 | publisher = Atari Corp. | year = 1995 | url =http://blog.eerievale.com/download.php?id=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Jaguar is a custom chip set primarily intended to be the heart of a very high-performance games/leisure computer. It may also be used as a graphics accelerator in more complex systems, and applied to workstation and business uses. As well as a general purpose CPU, Jaguar contains four processing units. These are the Object Processor, Graphics Processor, Blitter, and Digital Sound Processor. Jaguar provides these blocks with a 64-bit data path to external memory devices, and is capable of a very high data transfer rate into external dynamic RAM.&quot; (page 1)

===Memory Track===
Released in 1995, the ''Memory Track'' is a cartridge that contains a 128&amp;nbsp;K [[EEPROM]], allowing Atari Jaguar CD games to save persistent data such as preferences and savegames.

==Reception==
The Jaguar was a commercial failure thanks to its shortage of third party support and several poorly received first party titles. In September 2009, [[IGN.com|IGN]] ranked the Atari Jaguar as the 24th best console of all time, lower than all five of its major competitors: the [[SNES]] (4th best), the [[Sega Mega Drive]] (5th), the [[Sony PlayStation]] (7th), the [[Sega Saturn]] (18th), and even the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]] (22nd).&lt;ref name=&quot;Top 25 Consoles&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=IGN's Top 25 Video Game Consoles of All Time|url=http://www.ign.com/top-25-consoles/24.html|publisher=IGN|accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Atari Lynx''' is a 16-bit [[handheld game console]] that was released by Atari Corporation in 1989. The Lynx holds the distinction of being the world's first [[handheld electronic game]] with a [[color]] [[LCD]]. The system is also notable for its forward-looking features, advanced graphics, and [[ambidextrous]] layout. The Lynx was released in 1989, the same year as [[Nintendo]]'s (monochromatic) [[Game Boy]]. However, the Lynx failed to achieve the sales numbers required to attract quality third party developers, and was eventually abandoned.

Today, as with many older consoles, there is still a small group of devoted fans, creating and selling games for the system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atariage.com/company_page.html?SystemID=LYNX&amp;CompanyID=92 Atari Age Self Published Lynx Games]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The Atari Lynx has several innovative features including its being the first color handheld, with a backlit display, a switchable right-handed/left-handed (upside down) configuration, and the ability to network with up to 17 other units via its &quot;ComLynx&quot; system (though most games would network eight or fewer players). [[ComLynx]] was originally developed to run over infrared links (and was codenamed RedEye).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atari-explorer.com/lynx/lynx.html Atari Explorer Lynx page]&lt;/ref&gt; This was changed to a cable-based networking system before the final release.

The Lynx was also the first gaming console with [[hardware]] support for zooming/distortion of [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], allowing fast [[pseudo-3D]] games with unrivaled quality at the time and a capacity for drawing filled polygons with limited CPU intervention. ''[[Blue Lightning]]'', a game with ''[[After Burner]]''-like graphics, was especially notable and featured in TV advertising for the console.

The games were originally meant to be loaded from [[Compact Cassette|tape]], but were later changed to load from ROM. The game data still needed to be copied from ROM to RAM before it could be used, so less memory was available and the games loaded relatively slowly.&lt;ref name=&quot;retrogamer&quot;/&gt;

== History ==
The Lynx was the second handheld game with the Atari name to actually be produced, the first was Atari Inc.'s [[handheld electronic game]] [[Touch Me (arcade game)|Touch Me]]. Atari Inc. had previously worked on several other handheld projects including the ''[[Breakout (arcade game)|Breakout]]'', ''[[Space Invaders]]'', and the [[Atari Cosmos]] portable/tabletop console. However, those projects were shut down during development - some just short of their intended commercial release.

The Lynx system was originally developed by [[Epyx]] as the '''Handy Game'''. Planning and design of the console began in 1986 and completed in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;retrogamer&quot;/&gt; Epyx first showed the Handy system at the Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) in January 1989. Facing financial difficulties, Epyx sought out partners. Atari Corp. and Epyx eventually agreed that Atari Corp. would handle production and marketing, while Epyx would handle software development.

Atari Corp. changed the internal speaker and removed the thumb-stick on the control pad before releasing it as the Lynx, initially retailing in the US at US$179.95. Atari Corp. then showed the Lynx to the press at the Summer 1989 CES as the &quot;Portable Color Entertainment System&quot;, which was changed to Lynx when actual consoles were distributed to resellers.&lt;ref name=&quot;retrogamer&quot;/&gt;

However, [[Nintendo]]'s new [[Game Boy]] was also introduced at the 1989 CES. At $90, it was much less expensive than the Lynx, without the color or custom chips. Nintendo had no problems supplying retailers with the Game Boy for the Christmas season while Atari Corp. only managed limited distribution of their Lynx by year's end.

[[Image:Atari Lynx II.png|right|thumb|Atari Lynx II]]
During 1990, the Lynx had moderate sales but Nintendo's Game Boy continued to gain market share. In 1991, Atari Corp. relaunched the Lynx with a new marketing campaign, new packaging, slightly improved hardware, and a new sleek look. The new system (referred to within Atari Corp. as the &quot;Lynx II&quot;) featured rubber hand grips and a clearer backlit color screen with a power save option (which turned off the LCD panel's backlighting). It also replaced the monaural headphone jack of the original Lynx with one wired for stereo. The new packaging made the Lynx available without any accessories, dropping the price to $99. Although sales improved, Nintendo still dominated the handheld market.

As with the actual console units, the game cartridges themselves evolved over the first year of the console's release. The first generation of cartridges were flat, and were designed to be stackable for ease of storage. However, this design proved to be very difficult to remove from the console and was replaced by a second design. This style, called &quot;tabbed&quot; or &quot;ridged&quot;, used the same basic design as the original cartridges with the addition of two small tabs on the cartridge's underside to aid in removal. The original flat style cartridges could be stacked on top of the newer cartridges, but the newer cartridges could not be easily stacked on each other, nor were they stored easily. Thus a third style, the &quot;curved lip&quot; style was produced, and all official and third-party cartridges during the console's lifespan were released (or re-released) using this style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atariage.com/system_labels.html?SystemID=LYNX Atari Lynx] cartridge style illustrations at AtariAge.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1991, [[Sega]] launched its [[Game Gear]] portable gaming handheld. Also a color handheld, in comparison to the Lynx it had a higher cost, smaller bulk, and worse battery life. However, the Game Gear was backed up by significantly more popular titles and consequently the market became dominated by Nintendo followed by Sega in a distant second and the Lynx in third except in the UK and parts of Europe such as France and Holland where the Lynx retained 2nd place.

In 1994, Atari Corp. shifted its focus away from the Lynx. As Nintendo's [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]] and Sega's [[Sega Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]] filled retailers' shelves, Atari Corp. refocused its efforts on its [[Atari Jaguar|Jaguar]] console. A handful of games were released during this time, including ''Battlezone 2000''. In 1996, Atari shut down its internal game development.

Telegames released a number of games in the second half of the 1990s, including a port of ''[[Raiden (arcade game)|Raiden]]'' and a platformer called ''Fat Bobby'' in 1997, as well as an action sports game called ''Hyperdrome'' in 1999. At the end of the 1990s, Hasbro, the owners of the Atari properties at the time, released the rights to develop for the system to the public domain. Since then a number of independent developers released games into the new decade, like ''Championship Rally'', ''CyberVirus'', and ''Alpine Games''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duranik.com Alpine Games by Duranik]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the late 90s/early 2000s games were under development by other companies at one time, but rights to the game programs and all of the existing code was bought and finished by other developers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://songbird-productions.com/cybervirus.shtml Songbird Productions'] development page for CyberVirus&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Atari was honored at the 59th Annual [[Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award]]s for pioneering the development of [[handheld games]] with its Lynx game unit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamespot.com/news/6184421.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, 2009, North American company [[Super Fighter Team]] released ''[[Zaku (video game)|Zaku]]'', an all new, all original horizontal shooter for the Lynx developed by PenguiNet. Of significant note is that it was the first new game for the system whose game card has an authentic &quot;curved lip&quot; plastic shell. The game also shipped with a full color cardstock box, and 31 page instruction manual printed in both English and French.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zaku-lynx.com/ Official Zaku website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Although it was innovative and unique for its time, gamers found the Atari Lynx to be quite large and bulky, even the 2nd version of the unit.

However, the game system was reviewed in 1990 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #155 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the Lynx 5 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon155&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Lord Mahavir Gold.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mahavira]], The Torch-bearer of Ahimsa]]

'''Ahimsa''' ([[Sanskrit]]: [[Devanagari]]; {{lang|sa|अहिंसा}}; [[IAST]] {{IAST|ahiṃsā}}, [[Pāli]]: {{IAST|avihiṃsā}}) is a term meaning to do no harm (literally: the avoidance of violence -  ''himsa''). The word is derived from the Sanskrit root ''hims'' - to strike; ''himsa'' is injury or harm, ''a-himsa'' is the opposite of this, i.e.  ''non harming'' or ''[[nonviolence]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shukavak N. Dasa&quot;&gt;[http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Primer/nonharming_ahimsa.html A Hindu Primer], by [http://www.sanskrit.org/www/shukavak.htm Shukavak N. Dasa]&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important tenet of the [[Indian religions]] ([[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]]). Ahimsa means kindness and non-violence towards all living things including animals; it respects living beings as a unity, the belief that all living things are connected. Indian leader [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] strongly believed in this principle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsblaze.com/story/20071014111738kuma.nb/topstory.html Gandhi's Philosophy of Ahimsa and Its Application to Current Conflicts]&lt;/ref&gt; Avoidance of verbal and physical violence is also a part of this principle, although ahimsa recognizes [[self-defense]] when necessary, as a sign of a strong spirit. It is closely connected with the notion that all kinds of violence entail negative [[Karma|karmic]] consequences.

==Vedism==
The term ''ahimsa'' appears in the [[Hindu]] text [[Taittiriya_Samhita|Taittiriya Samhita]] of the [[Yajurveda]] (TS 5.2.8.7), where it refers to non-injury to the sacrificer himself.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs several times in the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' in the sense of &quot;non-injury&quot; without a moral connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Shatapatha Brahmana 2.3.4.30; 2.5.1.14; 6.3.1.26; 6.3.1.39.&lt;/ref&gt; The ahimsa doctrine is a late development in Brahmanical culture.&lt;ref&gt;Henk M. Bodewitz in Jan E. M. Houben, K. R. van Kooij, ed., ''Violence denied: violence, non-violence and the rationalization of violence in &quot;South Asian&quot; cultural history.'' BRILL, 1999 page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to the idea of non-violence to animals (''pashu-ahimsa''), apparently in a moral sense, is in the Kapisthala Katha Samhita of the Yajurveda (KapS 31.11), which may have been written in about the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The word scarcely appears in the principal Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker, ''Problems of suffering in religions of the world.'' Cambridge University Press, 1975, page 233.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chandogya Upanishad]], dated to the 8th or 7th century BCE, one of the oldest [[Upanishads]], has the earliest evidence for the use of the word ''ahimsa'' in the sense familiar in Hinduism (a code of conduct). It bars violence against &quot;all creatures&quot; (''sarva-bhuta'') and the practitioner of ahimsa is said to escape from the cycle of [[metempsychosis]] (CU 8.15.1).&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 2-5; English translation: Schmidt p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt; It also names ahimsa as one of five essential virtues (CU 3.17.4). A few scholars are of the opinion that this passage was a concession to growing influence of [[Shramana|shramanic]] culture on the Brahmanical religion.&lt;ref&gt;Puruṣottama Bilimoria, Joseph Prabhu, Renuka M. Sharma, ''Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges.'' Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007, page 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quotes from Vedas===
Aghnyaa yajamaanasya pashoonpahi
Yajurveda 1.1

One should not use their God-given body for killing God's creatures, whether these creatures are human, animal or whatever.
Yajurveda 12.32

“O human! animals are Aghnya – not to be killed. Protect the animals.)2-``Breehimattam yavamattamatho maashamatho tilam
Esha vaam bhaago nihito ratnadheyaaya dantau maa hinsishtam pitaram maataram cha-
Atharvaveda 6.140.2

By not harming any living being, one becomes fit for salvation. Manu-Smriti 6.60

O teeth! You eat rice, you eat barley, you gram and you eat sesame. These cereals are specifically meant for you. Do not kill those who are capable of being fathers and mothers. Protect both our species, two-legged and four-legged. Both food and water for their needs supply. May they with us increase in stature and strength. Save us from hurt all our days, O Powers! Rig Veda Samhita 10.37.11.

One who partakes of human flesh, the flesh of a horse or of another animal, and deprives others of milk by slaughtering cows, O King, if such a fiend does not desist by other means, then you should not hesitate to punish such a person. Rig Veda Samhita, 10.87.16

Do not kill any of the Creatures. Yajurveda L 1

Having well considered the origin of flesh-foods, and the cruelty of fettering and slaying corporeal beings, let man entirely abstain from eating flesh.  Manu-Smriti, 5.49

&quot;Ya aamam maansamadanti paurusheyam cha ye kravih
Garbhaan khaadanti keshavaastaanito naashayaamasi&quot;
Atharvaveda 8.6.23

We ought to destroy those who eat cooked as well as uncooked meat, meat involving destruction of males and females, foetus and eggs.  Atharvaveda 8.6.23

==Hinduism==
===Non-human life===
{{Quote farm|date=April 2011}}
Hindus do not substantially differentiate the soul within a human body from that of an animal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/5/18/en1 Bhagavad Gita 5.18] &quot;The humble sages, by virtue of true knowledge, see with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Hence ahimsa as a binding code of conduct implies a ban on hunting, butchery, meat eating, and the use of animal products provided by violent means. The question of moral duties towards animals and of negative Karma incurred from violence against them is discussed in detail in some Hindu scriptures and religious lawbooks.

Some source texts discuss meat eating as a fact without referring to the ethical side of the issue. The [[Dharmasutra]] law books written around the 5th or 4th century BCE contain regulations for meat eating and lists of edible animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Baudhayana]] Dharmasutra 2.4.7; 2.6.2; 2.11.15; 2.12.8; 3.1.13; 3.3.6; [[Apastamba]] Dharmasutra 1.17.15; 1.17.19; 2.17.26-2.18.3; Vasistha Dharmasutra 14.12.&lt;/ref&gt; Medical treatises of the [[Ayurveda]] discuss and recommend meat from a purely health-related viewpoint without even mentioning the aspect of ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf p. 617-619.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are the [[Sushruta Samhita]] written in the 3rd or 4th century CE, which recommends beef for certain patients and for pregnant women,&lt;ref&gt;Sutrasthana 46.89; Sharirasthana 3.25.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Charaka Samhita]] which describes meat as superior to all other kinds of food for convalescents.&lt;ref&gt;Sutrasthana 27.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several highly authoritative scriptures bar violence against domestic animals except in the case of ritual sacrifice. This view is clearly expressed in the [[Mahabharata]],&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 3.199.11-12 (3.199 is 3.207 according to another count); 13.115; 13.116.26; 13.148.17.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bhagavata Purana]] (11.5.13-14), and the Chandogya Upanishad (8.15.1). It is also reflected in the [[Manu Smriti]] (5.27-44), a particularly renowned traditional Hindu lawbook ([[Dharmaśāstra]]). These texts strongly condemn the slaughter of animals and meat eating. The Mahabharata permits hunting by warriors ([[Kshatriya]]s),&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 13.115.59-60; 13.116.15-18.&lt;/ref&gt; but opposes it in the case of hermits who must be strictly non-violent.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf p. 592-593.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has, for the most part, been changed, and now almost all Hindu temples ban meat from temple premises.

Nevertheless the sources show that this compromise between supporters of ahimsa and meat eaters was shaky and hotly disputed. Even the loopholes – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf p. 572-577 (for the Manu Smriti) and p. 585-597 (for the Mahabharata); Tähtinen p. 34-36.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahabharata and the Manu Smriti (5.27-55) contain lengthy discussions about the legitimacy of ritual slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12b095.htm Mahabharata 12.260] (12.260 is 12.268 according to another count); 13.115-116; 14.28.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03207.htm Mahabharata 3.199] (3.199 is 3.207 according to another count).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the arguments proposed in favour of non-violence to animals refer to rewards it entails before or after death and to horrible karmic consequences of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 39-43.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it is pointed out that he who deliberately kills an animal will on his part be eaten by an animal in a future existence due to karmic retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt p. 629, 643-645.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa is described as a prerequisite for acquiring supernatural faculties, highest bliss and ultimate salvation;&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf p. 589; Schmidt p. 634-635, 640-643; Tähtinen p. 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt; moreover it is said to protect against all kinds of dangers.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt; The Manu Smriti (10.63), [[Kautilya]]’s [[Arthashastra]] (1.3.13) and the Vasishtha Dharmasutra (4.4) point out that ahimsa is a duty for all the four classes ([[Varna in Hinduism|Varna]]s) of society. The texts declare that ahimsa should be extended to all forms of life. They also give attention to the protection of plants. The Manu Smriti prohibits wanton destruction of both wild and cultivated plants (11.145). Hermits ([[Sannyasin]]s) had to live on a [[fruitarian]] diet so as to avoid the destruction of plants.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt p. 637-639.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under these circumstances the defenders of hunting and ritual slaughter had to deny the violent nature of these activities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} They asserted that lawful violence is in fact non-violence; according to them ''sacrificial killing is not killing'', but is meant for the welfare of the whole world.&lt;ref&gt;Manu Smriti 5.39 and 5.44; Mahabharata 3.199 (3.207).&lt;/ref&gt; They also suggested that such killing is in fact a benevolent act, because the slaughtered animal will attain a high rebirth in the cycle of reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Manu Smriti 5.32; 5.39-40; 5.42; 5.44; Mahabharata 3.199 (3.207); 14.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover they argued that some species have been created for the purpose of being sacrificed and eaten by humans,&lt;ref&gt;Manu Smriti 5.30, Mahabharata 3.199.5 (3.207.5).&lt;/ref&gt; that it is normal for animals to kill and eat other animals,&lt;ref name = &quot;eiuoso&quot;&gt;Mahabharata 3.199.23-24 (3.207.23-24).&lt;/ref&gt; that agriculture, too, inevitably leads to the death of many animals,&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 3.199.19 (3.207.19).&lt;/ref&gt; that plants are living beings as well and must still be destroyed,&lt;ref name = &quot;eiuoso&quot;/&gt; that we unintentionally and unknowingly destroy life forms all the time,&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 3.199.28-29 (3.207.28-29).&lt;/ref&gt; and that a hunted animal has a fair chance to survive by killing the hunter.&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 13.116.15-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Quotes from [[Ramayana]]:
Saint Valmiki was going to the river Ganga for his daily ablutions. A disciple by the name Bharadwaja was carrying his clothes. On the way, they came across the Tamasa Stream. Looking at the stream, Valmiki said to his disciple, &quot;Look, how clear is this water, like the mind of a good man! I will bathe here today.&quot; When he was looking for a suitable place to step into the stream, he heard the sweet chirping of birds. Looking up, he saw two birds flying together. Valmiki felt very pleased on seeing the happy bird couple. Suddenly, one of the birds fell down, hit by an arrow; it was the male bird. Seeing the wounded one, its mate screamed in agony. Valmiki's heart melted at this pitiful sight. He looked around to find out who had shot the bird. He saw a hunter with a bow and arrows, nearby. Valmiki became very angry. His lips opened and he uttered the following words:

/*ॐ माँ निषाद प्रतिष्ठा त्वमगमः शास्वती समः यत् क्रोच मिथुनादेवकमवधी काममोहितं*/

mā niṣāda pratiṣṭhāṁ tvamagamaḥ śāśvatīḥ samāḥ
yat krauñcamithunādekam avadhīḥ kāmamohitam[8]
_``You will find no rest for the long years of Eternity,
For you killed a bird in love and unsuspecting-``[9]

===Self-defense, criminal law, and war===
Hindu scriptures and law books support the use of violence in self-defense against an armed attacker.&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 12.15.55; Manu Smriti 8.349-350; Matsya Purana 226.116.&lt;/ref&gt; They make it clear that criminals are not protected by the rule of ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 96, 98-101.&lt;/ref&gt; They have no misgivings about the death penalty; their position is that evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, and that a king in particular is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, even if they happen to be his own brothers and sons.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 96, 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some interpretations, the concept of ahimsa as expounded in the scriptures and law books is not meant to imply pacifism; war is seen as a normal part of life and the natural duty of the warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 91-93.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second chapter of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] [[Krishna]] refutes the pacifist ideas of [[Arjuna]] and uses various arguments to convince him that he must fight and kill in the impending battle. According to this interpretation of the scriptures, face-to-face combat is highly meritorious and fighters who die in battle go to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;  The apparent conflict between pacifistic interpretations of Ahimsa and the just war prescribed by the Gita has been resolved by some individuals by resorting to allegorical readings. Some of which are based on [[Theosophy|Theosophical]] interpretations and were notably represented by [[Mahatma Gandhi]],&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, Mohandas K., ''The Bhagavad Gita According to Gandhi'' Berkeley Hills Books, Berkeley 2000&lt;/ref&gt; who made clear throughout his life and his own commentary on the Gita that it was &quot;an allegory in which the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, man's higher impulses struggling against evil.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Louis: ''Gandhi: His Life and Message to the World'' Mentor, New York 1954, pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern times===
[[File:Portrait Gandhi.jpg|thumb|Gandhi promoted the principle of ahimsa very successfully by applying it to all spheres of life, particularly to politics.]]

In modern Hinduism slaughter according to the rituals permitted in the Vedic scriptures has virtually disappeared. In the 19th and 20th centuries, prominent figures of Indian spirituality such as [[Swami Vivekananda]],&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Vegetarianism'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, p. 50-52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ramana Maharshi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beasyouare.info/beasyouare.html Ramana Maharishi: ''Be as you are'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swami Sivananda]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlshq.org/teachings/ahimsa.htm Swami Sivananda: ''Bliss Divine'', p. 3-8.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami]]&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Vegetarianism'' p. 56-60.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized the importance of ahimsa.

[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] promoted the principle of ahimsa very successfully by applying it to all spheres of life, particularly to politics.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 116-124.&lt;/ref&gt; His non-violent resistance movement [[satyagraha]] had an immense impact on India, impressed public opinion in Western countries and influenced the leaders of various [[civil rights]] movements such as [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] In Gandhi’s thought ahimsa precludes not only the act of inflicting a physical injury, but also mental states like evil thoughts and hatred, unkind behavior such as harsh words, dishonesty and lying, all of which he saw as manifestations of violence incompatible with ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Walli p. XXII-XLVII; Borman, William: ''Gandhi and Non-Violence'', Albany 1986, p. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Aurobindo]] criticized the Gandhian concept of ahimsa as unrealistic and not universally applicable; he adopted a pragmatic non-pacifist position, saying that the justification of violence depends on the specific circumstances of the given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 115-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

A thorough historical and philosophical study of ahimsa was instrumental in the shaping of [[Albert Schweitzer]]'s principle of &quot;reverence for life&quot;. Schweitzer criticized Indian philosophical and religious traditions for having conceived ahimsa as the negative principle of avoiding violence instead of emphasizing the importance of positive action (helping injured beings).&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Albert: ''Indian Thought and its Development'', London 1956, p. 80-84, 100-104, 110-112, 198-200, 223-225, 229-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoga===
Ahimsa is imperative for practitioners of [[Patañjali]]’s &quot;classical&quot; Yoga ([[Raja Yoga]]). It is one of the five [[Yamas]] (restraints) which make up the code of conduct, the first of the eight limbs of which this path consists.&lt;ref&gt;Patañjali: ''Yoga Sutras'', Sadhana Pada 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the schools of [[Bhakti Yoga]], the devotees who worship [[Vishnu]] or Krishna are particularly keen on ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[Bhakti Yoga]] school,  [[Radha Soami Satsang Beas]] observes vegetarianism and moral living as aspects of &quot;ahimsa.&quot;
Ahimsa is also an obligation in [[Hatha Yoga]] according to the classic manual [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]] (1.1.17).

==Jainism==
{{Main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
[[File:Jain hand.svg|thumb|right|150px|The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolizes the Jain Vow of Ahimsa. The word in the middle is &quot;ahimsa&quot;. The wheel represents the [[dharmacakra]] which stands for the resolve to halt the cycle of reincarnation through relentless pursuit of truth and non-violence.]]
In Jainism, the understanding and implementation of ahimsa is more radical, scrupulous, and comprehensive than in any other religion.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw, James: ''Riches and Renunciation. Religion, economy, and society among the Jains'', Oxford 1995, p. 154-160; Jindal, K.B.: ''An epitome of Jainism'', New Delhi 1988, p. 74-90; Tähtinen p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-violence is seen as the most essential religious duty for everyone  (''{{IAST|ahiṃsā paramo dharmaḥ}}'', a statement often inscribed on Jain temples).&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul: ''The Jains'', second edition, London 2002, p. 160; Wiley, Kristi L.: ''Ahimsa and Compassion in Jainism'', in: ''Studies in Jaina History and Culture'', ed. Peter Flügel, London 2006, p. 438; Laidlaw p. 153-154.&lt;/ref&gt; Like in Hinduism, the aim is to prevent the accumulation of harmful Karma.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 26-30, 191-195.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Mahavira]] revived and reorganized the Jain movement in the 6th or 5th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 24 suggests the 5th century; the traditional dating of Mahavira’s death is 527 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; ahimsa was already an established, strictly observed  rule.&lt;ref&gt;Goyal, S.R.: ''A History of Indian Buddhism'', Meerut 1987, p. 83-85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parshva]], the earliest Jain leader ([[Tirthankar]]) whom modern Western historians consider to be a historical figure,&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 19, 30; Tähtinen p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; lived in about the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 30 suggests the 8th or 7th century; the traditional chronology places him in the late 9th or early 8th century.&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the community to which Mahavira’s parents belonged.&lt;ref&gt;[[Acaranga Sutra]] 2.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa was already part of the &quot;Fourfold Restraint&quot; (''Caujjama''), the vows taken by Parshva’s followers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sthananga Sutra]] 266; Tähtinen p. 132; Goyal p. 83-84, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In the times of Mahavira and in the following centuries, Jains were at odds with both Buddhists and followers of the Vedic religion or Hindus, whom they accused of negligence and inconsistency in the implementation of ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 160, 234, 241; Wiley p. 448; Granoff, Phyllis: ''The Violence of Non-Violence: A Study of Some Jain Responses to Non-Jain Religious Practices'', in: ''Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies'' 15 (1992) p. 1-43; Tähtinen p. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence, however, that ancient Jain ascetics accepted meat as alms if the animal had not been specifically killed for them.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf p. 564-570; Dundas p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Jains deny this vehemently, especially with regard to Mahavira himself.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf p. 568-569.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Jain tradition either [[lacto-vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]] is mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain concept of ahimsa is characterized by several aspects. It does not make any exception for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 166-167; Tähtinen p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed for the sake of food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants.&lt;ref&gt;Lodha, R.M.: ''Conservation of Vegetation and Jain Philosophy'', in: ''Medieval Jainism: Culture and Environment'', New Delhi 1990, p. 137-141; Tähtinen p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains go out of their way so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal p. 89; Laidlaw p. 54, 154-155, 180.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jains often do not go out at night, when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action.&lt;ref&gt;Sutrakrtangasutram 1.8.3; Uttaradhyayanasutra 10; Tattvarthasutra 7.8; Dundas p. 161-162.&lt;/ref&gt; Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hemacandra]]: ''Yogashastra'' 3.37; Laidlaw p. 166-167.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects,&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Sangave, Vilas Adinath: ''Jaina Community. A Social Survey'', second edition, Bombay 1980, p. 259; Dundas p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, because they consider harsh words to be a form of violence, they often keep a cloth to ritually cover their mouth, as a reminder not to allow violence in their speech.

In contrast, Jains agree with Hindus that violence in self-defense can be justified,&lt;ref&gt;''Nisithabhasya'' (in ''Nisithasutra'') 289; Jinadatta Suri: ''Upadesharasayana'' 26; Dundas p. 162-163; Tähtinen p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and they agree that a soldier who kills enemies in combat is performing a legitimate duty.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal p. 89-90; Laidlaw p. 154-155; Jaini, Padmanabh S.: ''Ahimsa and &quot;Just War&quot; in Jainism'', in: ''Ahimsa, Anekanta and Jainism'', ed. Tara Sethia, New Delhi 2004, p. 52-60; Tähtinen p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Jain communities accepted the use of military power for their defense, and there were Jain monarchs, military commanders, and soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Harisena, ''Brhatkathakosa'' 124 (10th century); Jindal p. 90-91; Sangave p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though, theoretically, all life forms are said to deserve full protection from all kinds of injury, Jains admit that this ideal cannot be completely implemented in practice. Hence, they recognize a hierarchy of life. Mobile beings are given higher protection than immobile ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses a being has, the more they care about its protection. Among the five-sensed beings, the rational ones (humans) are most strongly protected by Jain ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal p. 89, 125-133 (detailed exposition of the classification system); Tähtinen p. 17, 113.&lt;/ref&gt; In the practice of ahimsa, the requirements are less strict for the lay persons who have undertaken ''anuvrata'' (Lesser Vows) than for the monks and nuns who are bound by ''mahavrata'' (Great Vows).&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 158-159, 189-192; Laidlaw p. 173-175, 179; ''Religious Vegetarianism'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, p. 43-46 (translation of the First Great Vow).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
Unlike in Hindu and Jain sources, in ancient Buddhist texts ''ahimsa'' (or its [[Pāli]] cognate {{IAST|avihiṃsā}}) is not used as a technical term.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional Buddhist understanding of non-violence is not as rigid as the Jain one, but like the Jains, Buddhists have always condemned the killing of all living beings.&lt;ref&gt;Sarao, K.T.S.: ''The Origin and Nature of Ancient Indian Buddhism'', Delhi 1989, p. 49; Goyal p. 143; Tähtinen p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lamotte, Etienne 1988, p. 54-55&quot;&gt;Lamotte, Etienne: ''History of Indian Buddhism from the Origins to the Śaka Era'', Louvain-la-Neuve 1988, p. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; In most Buddhist traditions vegetarianism is not mandatory. Monks and lay persons may eat meat and fish on condition that the animal was not killed specifically for them.&lt;ref&gt;Sarao p. 51-52; Alsdorf p. 561-564.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the beginnings of the Buddhist community, monks and nuns have had to commit themselves to [[Five Precepts]] of moral conduct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lamotte, Etienne 1988, p. 54-55&quot;/&gt; In ancient Buddhism, lay persons were encouraged, but not obliged, to commit themselves to observe the Five Precepts of morality ({{IAST|Pañcasīla}}).&lt;ref&gt;Lamotte p. 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt; In both codes the first rule is to abstain from taking the life of a sentient being ({{IAST|Pānātipātā}}).&lt;ref&gt;Lamotte p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist monks should avoid cutting or burning trees, because some sentient beings rely on them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awker.com/hongshi/mag/82/82-10.htm 從律典探索佛教對動物的態度（中）]&lt;/ref&gt;

===War===
[[File:Non violence - Gbg - C F Reutersward.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The sculpture ''[[Non Violence]]'' placed at Kungsportsavenyn in Göteborg, Sweden. It is also placed outside the [[headquarters]] of the [[United Nations]] in [[New York]], in [[Germany]] and multiple locations in  [[Sweden]].]]
Unlike the Vedic religion, ancient Buddhism had strong misgivings about violent ways of punishing criminals and about war. Both were not explicitly condemned,&lt;ref&gt;Sarao p. 53; Tähtinen p. 95, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; but peaceful ways of conflict resolution and punishment with the least amount of injury were encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 95, 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt A. Raaflaub, ''War and Peace in the Ancient World.'' Blackwell Publishing, 2007 , page 61. [http://books.google.com/books?id=FMxgef2VJEwC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0#PPA61,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; The early texts condemn rather the mental states that lead to violent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Tessa Bartholomeusz, ''In Defense of Dharma.'' RoutledgeCurzon 2002, page 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-violence is an over-riding concern of the [[Pali Canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Tessa Bartholomeusz, ''In Defense of Dharma.'' RoutledgeCurzon 2002, page 111.&lt;/ref&gt; While the early texts condemn killing in the strongest terms, and portray the ideal king as a pacifist, such a king is nonetheless flanked by an army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tessa Bartholomeusz 2002, page 41&quot;&gt;Tessa Bartholomeusz, ''In Defense of Dharma.'' RoutledgeCurzon 2002, page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the Buddha's teaching on non-violence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tessa Bartholomeusz 2002, page 41&quot;/&gt; The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as a necessity for defensive warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Tessa Bartholomeusz, ''In Defense of Dharma.'' RoutledgeCurzon 2002, page 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In Pali texts, injunctions to abstain from violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the [[sangha]]; later Mahayana texts, which often generalize monastic norms to laity, require this of lay people as well.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, pages 195-196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early texts do not contain just-war ideology as such.&lt;ref&gt;Tessa Bartholomeusz, ''In Defense of Dharma.'' RoutledgeCurzon 2002, page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that a [[suttas|sutta]] in the ''Gamani Samyuttam'' rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha if it is true that, as he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Tessa Bartholomeusz, ''In Defense of Dharma.'' RoutledgeCurzon 2002, pages 125-126. Full texts of the sutta:[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn42/sn42.003.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt; In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having an inordinate impact on the next birth.&lt;ref&gt;Rune E.A. Johansson, ''The Dynamic Psychology of Early Buddhism.'' Curzon Press 1979, page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Buddhists point to other early texts as justifying defensive war.&lt;ref&gt;Tessa Bartholomeusz, ''In Defense of Dharma.'' RoutledgeCurzon 2002, pages 40-53. Some examples are the ''Cakkavati Sihanada Sutta'', the ''Kosala Samyutta'', the ''Ratthapala Sutta'', and the ''Sinha Sutta''. See also page 125. See also Trevor Ling, ''Buddhism, Imperialism, and War.'' George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1979, pages 136-137.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the ''Kosala Samyutta'', in which King Pasenadi, a righteous king favored by the Buddha, learns of an impending attack on his kingdom. He arms himself in defense, and leads his army into battle to protect his kingdom from attack. He lost a battle but won the war. King Pasenadi defeated King Ajatasattu and captured him alive. He thought that although this King of Magadha has transgressed  against him while he has not transgressed against him, Ajatasattu is still his nephew. He released Ajatasattu and did not harm him.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2000). The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya. Boston: Wisdom Publications. ISBN 0-86171-331-1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon his return, the Buddha says, among other things, that Pasenadi is &quot;a friend of virtue, acquainted with virtue, intimate with virtue&quot;, while the opposite is said of the aggressor, King Ajatasattu.&lt;ref&gt;Tessa Bartholomeusz, ''In Defense of Dharma.'' RoutledgeCurzon 2002, page 49, see also pages 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theravada commentaries, there are five requisite factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) the presence of a living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death.&lt;ref&gt;Hammalawa Saddhatissa, ''Buddhist Ethics.'' Wisdom Publications, 1997, pages 60, 159, see also Bartholomeusz page 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent.&lt;ref&gt;Tessa Bartholomeusz, ''In Defense of Dharma.'' RoutledgeCurzon 2002, page 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to save, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;Tessa Bartholomeusz, ''In Defense of Dharma.'' RoutledgeCurzon 2002, pages 44, 121-122, 124, .&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Babasaheb Ambedkar]], the doctrine of Ahimsa does not say &quot;Kill not&quot; it says, &quot;Love all&quot;. Buddha said ''&quot;Love all, so that you may not wish to kill any&quot;'' This is a positive way of stating the principle of Ahimsa. The Buddhas' Ahimsa is quite in keeping with his middle path. To put it differently, the Buddha made a distinction between Principle and Rule. He did not make Ahimsa a matter of Rule. He enunciated it as a matter of Principle or way of life. A principle leaves you freedom to act. A rule does not. Rule either breaks you, or you break the rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_buddha/04_02.html#03_02 The Buddha and His Dhamma]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Annals of Mathematics''''' is a bimonthly [[mathematical journal]] published by [[Princeton University]] and the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. It ranks amongst the most prestigious mathematics journals in the world by criteria such as [[impact factor]].

==History==
The journal began as ''The Analyst'' in 1874&lt;ref&gt;Diana F. Liang, [http://books.google.com/books?id=_F3gAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=mathematical+journals+an+annotated+guide&amp;dq=mathematical+journals+an+annotated+guide&amp;ei=9HxoS7LxO4nSM-GDnLsD&amp;cd=1 Mathematical journals: an annotated guide.] Scarecrow Press, 1992, ISBN 0810825856; p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and was established and [[Editor-in-chief|edited]] by [[Joel E. Hendricks]]. It was &quot;intended to afford a medium for the presentation and analysis of any and all questions of interest or importance in pure and applied Mathematics, embracing especially all new and interesting discoveries in theoretical and practical astronomy, mechanical philosophy, and engineering&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hendricks|first=Joel E.|year=1874|title=Introductory remarks|journal=The Analyst|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1&amp;ndash;2|doi=10.1039/an8760100001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], and was the earliest American mathematics journal to be published continuously for more than a year or two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fiske|first=Thomas S.|authorlink=Thomas S. Fiske|title=Mathematical progress in America|year=1905|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=11|pages=238&amp;ndash;246|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/2000-37-01/S0273-0979-99-00799-5/S0273-0979-99-00799-5.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1905-01210-6}} Reprinted in ''Bulletin (New Series) of the American Mathematical Society'' '''37''' (1), 3&amp;ndash;8, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This incarnation of the journal ceased publication after its tenth year, in 1883, giving as an explanation Hendricks' declining health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hendricks|first=Joel E.|year=1883|title=Announcement|journal=The Analyst|volume=10|issue=5|pages=159&amp;ndash;160}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Hendricks made arrangements to have it taken over by new management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hendricks|first=Joel E.|year=1883|title=Announcement|journal=The Analyst|volume=10|issue=6|pages=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was continued from March 1884 as the ''Annals of Mathematics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Raymond Garver | title = The Analyst, 1874-1883 | journal = [[Scripta Mathematica]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | year = 1932 | pages = 247–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new incarnation of the journal was edited by [[Ormond Stone]] ([[University of Virginia]]). It moved to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1899 before reaching its current home in Princeton in 1911. 

An important period for the journal was 1928–1958 with [[Solomon Lefschetz]] as editor.&lt;ref name=&quot;mc&quot;&gt;J. J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson. [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Lefschetz.html Solomon Lefschetz.] MacTutor History of Mathematics archive. Accessed February 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the annals became an increasingly well-known and respected journal. Its rise, in turn, stimulated American mathematics.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} [[Norman Steenrod]] characterized Lefschetz' impact as editor as follows:''&quot;The importance to American mathematicians of a first-class journal is that it sets high standards for them to aim at. In this somewhat indirect manner, Lefschetz profoundly affected the development of mathematics in the United States.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;mc&quot;/&gt;

Princeton University continued to publish the annals on its own until 1933, when the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] took joint editorial control. Since 1998 it has been available in an electronic edition, alongside its regular print edition. The electronic edition was available without charge, as an [[open access journal]], but since 2008 this is no longer the case. Editions before 2003 were transferred to the non-free [[JSTOR]] archive, and articles are not freely available until 5 years after publication.

== Editors ==
The current editors of the ''Annals of Mathematics'' are  [[Jean Bourgain]] (Institute for Advanced Study), [[David Gabai]], [[Nick Katz]], [[Peter Sarnak]], [[Yakov Sinai]], and [[Gang Tian]] (all from Princeton University).&lt;ref name=&quot;annals.princeton.edu&quot;&gt;[http://annals.princeton.edu/EditorialBoard.html Editorial Board.] ''Annals of Mathematics'', [[Princeton University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2009 [[impact factor]] of 4.174, ranking it first among 255 journals in the category &quot;Mathematics&quot;.&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isiwebofknowledge.com |title=Web of Science |year=2011 |accessdate=May 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov''' ({{lang-ru|Андре́й Дми́триевич Са́харов}}; May 21, 1921 – December 14, 1989) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Nuclear physics|nuclear]] [[physicist]], [[dissident]] and [[human rights]] activist. Sakharov was an advocate of [[civil liberties]] and reforms in the Soviet Union. He was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;aip.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.aip.org/history/sakharov/ Biography, by American Institute of Physics]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Sakharov was born in [[Moscow]] on May 21, 1921. His father was Dmitri Ivanovich Sakharov, a private school physics teacher and an amateur [[pianist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1975/sakharov-autobio.html Autobiography, The Nobel Foundation 1975]&lt;/ref&gt; His father later taught at the [[Second Moscow State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Sidney David Drell, Sergeǐ Petrovich Kapitsa, ''Sakharov Remembered: a tribute by friends and colleagues'' (1991), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Dmitri's grandfather Ivan had been a prominent lawyer in [[Tsarist Russia]] who had displayed respect for social awareness and humanitarian principles (including advocating the abolition of [[Capital punishment in Russia|capital punishment]]) that would later influence his grandson. Sakharov's mother was Yekaterina Alekseyevna Sakharova (''née'' Sofiano and of [[Greece|Greek]] ancestry).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sakharov-center.ru/sakharov/|title=Об А.Д. Сахарове |last=Bonner|first=Yelena|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-11-02|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKder44e |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memorial.krsk.ru/Articles/Djuha.htm|title=Греки в Красноярском крае (Материалы из книги И.Джухи «Греческая операция НКВД»)|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-11-02|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKdgkFB9 |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents and his paternal grandmother, Maria Petrovna, largely shaped Sakharov's personality. Although his paternal great-grandfather had been a priest in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and his pious mother did have him [[Baptism|baptised]], his father was an [[Atheism|atheist]] and religion did not play an important role in his life, though he did believe that a non-scientific &quot;guiding principle&quot; governed the universe and human life.&lt;ref name=&quot;drell&quot;&gt;Drell, Sidney D., and Sergei P. Kapitsa (eds.), ''Sakharov Remembered'', pp. 3, 92. New York: Springer, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and career===

Sakharov entered [[Moscow State University]] in 1938. Following evacuation in 1941 during the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]] (World War II), he graduated in [[Aşgabat]], in today's [[Turkmenistan]]. He was then assigned laboratory work in [[Ulyanovsk]]. During this period, in 1943, he married Klavdia Alekseyevna Vikhireva, with whom he raised two daughters and a son before she died in 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;drell&quot; /&gt; He returned to Moscow in 1945 to study at the Theoretical Department of [[Lebedev Physical Institute|FIAN]] (the Physical Institute of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]]). He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1947.

===Development of thermonuclear devices===
On [[World War II]]'s end, Sakharov researched [[cosmic ray]]s. In mid-1948 he participated in the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]] under [[Igor Kurchatov]]. The first Soviet atomic device was tested on August 29, 1949. After moving to [[Sarov]] in 1950, Sakharov played a key role in the next stage, the development of the [[hydrogen bomb]]. The first Soviet fusion device was tested on August 12, 1953, using what was called the [[Sloika]] design. In 1953, he received his [[Doctor of Science|D.Sc.]] degree, was elected a full member of the [[Russian Academy of Science|Soviet Academy of Sciences]], and was awarded the first of his three [[Hero of Socialist Labor]] titles. Sakharov continued to work at Sarov, playing a key role in the development of the first megaton-range Soviet hydrogen bomb using a design known as &quot;Sakharov's Third Idea&quot; in Russia and the [[Teller-Ulam design]] in the United States. It was first tested as [[RDS-37]] in 1955. A larger variation of the same design which Sakharov worked on was the 50MT [[Tsar Bomba]] of October 1961, which was the most powerful nuclear device ever exploded.

===Support for peaceful use of nuclear technology===
In 1950 he also proposed an idea for a controlled [[nuclear fusion]] reactor, the [[tokamak]], which is still the basis for the majority of work in the area. Sakharov, in association with [[Igor Tamm]], proposed confining extremely hot ionized [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] by [[torus]] shaped [[magnetic field]]s for controlling [[thermonuclear fusion]] that led to the development of the tokamak device.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[http://www.aip.org/history/sakharov/hbomb.htm Biography, by American Institute of Physics]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Efforts to improve nuclear reactor technology===
In 1951 he invented and tested the first [[explosively pumped flux compression generator]]s,&lt;ref&gt;A.D. Sakharov: &quot;Magnetoimplosive generators&quot;, UFN ''88'':4, 725-734 (1966); Sov. Phys. Uspekhi ''9'': 294-299 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; compressing magnetic fields by [[Explosive material|explosives]]. He called these devices MC or MK (for ''magnetocumulative'') generators. The radial MK-1 produced a pulsed magnetic field of 25 [[gauss (unit)|megagauss]] (2500 [[tesla (unit)|teslas]]). The following helical MK-2 generated 100 million [[ampere]]s in 1953.

Sakharov then tested a MK-driven &quot;plasma cannon&quot; where a small aluminium ring was vaporized by huge [[eddy current]]s into a stable, self-confined [[torus|toroidal]] [[plasmoid]] and was accelerated to 100&amp;nbsp;km/s.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Sakharov later suggested to replace the copper [[Electromagnetic coil|coil]] in MK generators by a big [[Superconductivity|superconductor]] [[solenoid]] to magnetically compress and focus [[Nuclear testing|underground nuclear explosions]] into a [[shaped charge]] effect. He theorized this could focus 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; [[proton]]s per second on a 1&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; surface, then envisaged to make two such beams collide. But it is not known if any experiment based on this idea has been ever achieved.

===Research and physics===
After 1965 Sakharov returned to [[fundamental science]] and began working on [[particle physics]] and [[cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;A.D.

He especially tried to explain the [[baryon asymmetry]] of the [[universe]], being the first scientist to introduce two universes called &quot;sheets&quot;, linked by the [[Big Bang]]. Sakharov achieved there a complete [[CPT symmetry]] since the second sheet is [[Chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorph]] ([[P-symmetry]]), has an opposite [[arrow of time]] ([[T-symmetry]]) and is mainly populated by [[antimatter]] ([[C-symmetry]]) because of an opposite [[CP-violation]]. In this model the two universes do not interact, except via local matter accumulation whose [[density]] and [[pressure]] would become high enough to connect the two sheets through a bridge without [[spacetime]] between them, but with [[geodesic]]s continuity beyond the radius limit allowing an exchange of matter. Sakharov called such [[Gravitational singularity|singularities]] a ''collapse'' and an ''anticollapse'', which are an alternative to the couple [[black hole]] and [[white hole]] in the [[wormhole]] theory. Sakharov also proposed the idea of [[induced gravity]] as an alternative theory of [[quantum gravity]].

===Turn to activism===
From the late 1950s Sakharov had become concerned about the moral and political implications of his work. Politically active during the 1960s, Sakharov was against [[nuclear proliferation]]. Pushing for the end of atmospheric tests, he played a role in the 1963 [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]], signed in Moscow. 

The major turn in Sakharov’s political evolution started in 1967, when [[anti-ballistic missile]] defense became a key issue in US–Soviet relations. In a secret detailed letter to the Soviet leadership of July 21, 1967, Sakharov explains the need to &quot;''take the Americans at their word''&quot; and accept their proposal &quot;for a bilateral rejection by the USA and the Soviet Union of the development of antiballistic missile defense&quot;, because otherwise an arms race in this new technology would increase the likelihood of nuclear war. He also asked permission to publish his manuscript (which accompanied the letter) in a newspaper to explain the dangers posed by this kind of defense. The government ignored his letter and refused to let him initiate a public discussion of ABM in the Soviet press.&lt;ref&gt;Gennady Gorelik. The Metamorphosis of Andrei Sakharov. Scientific American, 1999, March.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Web exhibit &quot;Andrei SAKHAROV: Soviet Physics, Nuclear Weapons, and Human Rights&quot; at American Institute of Physics [http://www.aip.org/history/sakharov/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:C0474-NN-Sakharov-house.jpg|thumb|The apartment building in the Scherbinki microdistrict of Nizhny Novgorod where A.D. Sakharov lived in exile 1980-86. His apartment is now a museum.]]
In May 1968 he completed an essay, ''Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom'', where the anti-ballistic missile defense is featured as a major threat of world nuclear war. After this essay was circulated in [[samizdat]] and then published outside the Soviet Union (initially on July 6, 1968, in the Dutch newspaper [[Het Parool]] through intermediary of the Dutch academic and writer [[Karel van het Reve]], followed by the [[New York Times]]), Sakharov was banned from all military-related research and returned to FIAN to study fundamental theoretical physics. In 1970 he, along with [[Valery Chalidze]] and [[Andrei Tverdokhlebov]], was one of the founders of the [[Committee on Human Rights in the USSR]] and came under increasing pressure from the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; He married a fellow human rights activist, [[Yelena Bonner]], in 1972.

In 1973 he was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] and in 1974 was awarded the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]]. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, although he was not allowed to leave the Soviet Union to collect it. His wife read his speech at the ceremony in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel_acceptance_speech&quot;&gt;Y.B. Sakharov: [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1975/sakharov-acceptance.html Acceptance Speech], Nobel Peace Prize, Oslo, Norway, December 10, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel_lecture&quot;&gt;Y.B.

Sakharov's ideas on social development led him to put forward the principle of human rights as a new basis of all politics. In his works he declared that &quot;the principle 'what is not prohibited is allowed' should be understood literally&quot;, denying the importance and validity of all rules and regulations not codified in the laws. He was arrested on January 22, 1980, following his public protests against the [[Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan]] in 1979 and was sent to [[internal exile]] in the city of Gorky, now [[Nizhny Novgorod]], a [[closed city]] that was inaccessible to foreign observers.

Between 1980 to 1986, Sakharov was kept under tight Soviet police surveillance. In his memoirs he mentions that their apartment in Gorky was repeatedly subjected to searches and heists. He remained isolated but unrepentant until December 19, 1986 when he was allowed to return to Moscow as [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] initiated the policies of [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Perestroïka and Soviet national security |  [[Michael MccGwire]] | publisher=Brookings Institution Press | year=1991 | isbn=0815755538 | page=275 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zbA2dK9GQb8C&amp;pg=PA275&amp;dq=andrei+sakharov+december+19&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rgYMTZuZDY2osAO_pIz2Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakharov was named the 1980 Humanist of the Year by the [[American Humanist Association]].[[File:BonnerAndSakharovAndKallistratova1986.jpg|thumb|L-to-R: [[Elena Bonner|E.Bonner]], A.Sakharov, [[Sofia Kalistratova|S.Kalistratova]], 1986]]
Later, in 1988, Sakharov was given the International Humanist Award by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]].

He helped to initiate the first independent legal political organizations and became prominent in the Soviet Union's growing political opposition. In March 1989, Sakharov [[Soviet Union legislative election, 1989|was elected]] to the new parliament, the [[Congress of People's Deputies|All-Union Congress of People's Deputies]] and co-led the democratic opposition, the [[Inter-Regional Deputies Group]].

===Death===
Soon after 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm on December 14, 1989, Sakharov went to his study to take a nap before preparing an important speech he was to deliver the next day in the Congress. His wife went to wake him at 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm as he had requested but she found Sakharov dead on the floor. A sudden [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] had taken his life at the age of 68.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coleman |first=Fred |title=The Decline and Fall of the Soviet Empire: Forty Years That Shook the World, from Stalin to Yeltsin |page=116 |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred in the [[Vostryakovskoye Cemetery]] in Moscow.

==Influence==
The [[Sakharov Prize]], established in 1988 and awarded annually by the [[European Parliament]] for people and organizations dedicated to human rights and freedoms, was named in his honor.

An [[Andrei Sakharov prize (APS)|Andrei Sakharov prize]] is also to be awarded by the [[American Physical Society]] every second year from 2006, &quot;to recognize outstanding leadership and/or achievements of scientists in upholding human rights&quot;.

The [[Andrei Sakharov Prize For Writer's Civic Courage]] was established in October 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chukfamily.ru/Lidia/Biblio/Rasskazova.htm &quot;For Writer's Civic Courage&quot;], ''[[Literaturnaya Gazeta]]'', October 31, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Andrei Sakharov Archives and Human  Rights Center==
The Andrei Sakharov Archives and Human Rights Center, established at [[Brandeis University]] in 1993, are now housed at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arc&quot;&gt;[http://www.brandeis.edu/departments/sakharov/ Harvard University. KGB file of Sakharov] {{Wayback|url=http://www.brandeis.edu/departments/sakharov/|date =20060516090712}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The documents from that archive were published by the [[Yale University Press]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;SakharovBook&quot;&gt;The KGB File of Andrei Sakharov. (edited by Joshua Rubenstein and Alexander Gribanov), New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005; ISBN 978-0-300-10681-7&lt;/ref&gt; These documents are available online.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookonline&quot;&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/annals/sakharov/sakharov_list.htm The KGB File of Andrei Sakharov], online version with original texts and the English translations in English and in Russian (text version in [[Windows-1251]] [[character encoding]] and the pictures of the original pages).&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of documents of the archive are letters from the head of the [[KGB]] to the [[Central Committee]] about activities of Soviet dissidents and recommendations about the interpretation in newspapers. The letters cover the period from 1968 to 1991 ([[Brezhnev stagnation]]). The documents characterize not only the Sakharov's activity, but that of other dissidents, as well as that of highest-position [[apparatchik]]s, and the KGB. No Russian equivalent of the KGB archive is available.

==Quotations==

* &quot;In this pamphlet, advanced for discussion by its readers, the author has set himself the goal to present, with the greatest conviction and frankness, two theses that are supported by many people in the world. These are:
*# The division of mankind threatens it with destruction... Only universal cooperation under conditions of intellectual freedom and the lofty moral ideals of [[socialism]] and labor, accompanied by the elimination of dogmatism and pressure of the concealed interests of ruling classes, will preserve civilization...
*# The second basic thesis is that intellectual freedom is essential to human society — freedom to obtain and distribute information, freedom for open-minded and unfearing debate and freedom from pressure by officialdom and prejudices. Such a trinity of freedom of thought is the only guarantee against an infection of people by mass myths, which, in the hands of treacherous hypocrites and demagogues, can be transformed into bloody dictatorship. Freedom of thought is the only guarantee of the feasibility of a scientific democratic approach to politics, economics and culture.&quot; (''Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom'', in ''[[The New York Times]], July 22, 1968)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/history/sakharov/essay.htm The opening paragraphs of Sakharov's Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom]&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;I foresee a universal information system (UIS), which will give everyone access at any given moment to the contents of any book that has ever been published or any magazine or any fact. The UIS will have individual miniature-computer terminals, central control points for the flood of information, and communication channels incorporating thousands of artificial communications from satellites, cables, and laser lines. Even the partial realization of the UIS will profoundly affect every person, his leisure activities, and his intellectual and artistic development. ...But the true historic role of the UIS will be to break down the barriers to the exchange of information among countries and people.&quot; (Saturday Review/World, August 24, 1974)&lt;ref name = &quot;AIP&quot;&gt;[http://www.aip.org/history/sakharov/humrt.htm The human rights movement, 1969-1979].&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;Thousands of years ago, tribes of human beings suffered great privations in the struggle to survive. In this struggle it was important not only to be able to handle a club, but also to possess the ability to think reasonably, to take care of the knowledge and experience garnered by the tribe, and to develop the links that would provide cooperation with other tribes. Today the entire human race is faced with a similar test. In infinite space many civilizations are bound to exist, among them civilizations that are also wiser and more &quot;successful&quot; than ours. I support the cosmological hypothesis which states that the development of the universe is repeated in its basic features an infinite number of times. In accordance with this, other civilizations, including more &quot;successful&quot; ones, should exist an infinite number of times on the &quot;preceding&quot; and the &quot;following&quot; pages of the Book of the Universe. Yet this should not minimize our sacred endeavors in this world of ours, where, like faint glimmers of light in the dark, we have emerged for a moment from the nothingness of dark unconsciousness of material existence. We must make good the demands of reason and create a life worthy of ourselves and of the goals we only dimly perceive.&quot; (Last paragraph of Sakharov's Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1975)&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel_lecture&quot; /&gt;

'''Astrobiology''' is the study of the origin, [[evolution]], distribution, and future of [[life]] in the [[universe]]. This [[interdisciplinary]] field encompasses the search for habitable environments in our [[Solar System]] and [[Planetary habitability|habitable planets]] outside our Solar System, the search for evidence of [[Abiogenesis|prebiotic chemistry]], laboratory and field research into the origins and early evolution of [[life on Earth]], and studies of the potential for life to adapt to challenges on [[Earth]] and in [[outer space]]. Astrobiology addresses the question of whether life exists beyond Earth, and how humans can detect it if it does.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/about-astrobiology/ |title=About Astrobiology |accessdate=2008-10-20 |date=21 January 2008 |work=NASA Astrobiology Institute |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The term '''exobiology''' is similar but more specific — it covers the search for life beyond Earth, and the effects of extraterrestrial environments on living things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exobiologists Mirriam Webster Dictionary entry &quot;Exobiologists&quot;] (accessed 16 April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;)

''Astrobiology'' is etymologically derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄστρον}}, ''astron'', &quot;constellation, star&quot;; {{lang|grc|βίος}}, ''bios'', &quot;life&quot;; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'', ''study''. The synonyms of Astrobiology are diverse; however, the synonyms were structured in relation to the most important sciences implied in its development: [[astronomy]] and [[biology]]. A synonym is ''exobiology'' from the Greek {{lang|grc|Έξω}}, &quot;external&quot;; Βίος, ''bios'', &quot;life&quot;; and λογία, -logia, ''study''. Another term used in the past is ''xenobiology,'' (&quot;biology of the foreigners&quot;) a word coined in 1954 by science fiction writer [[Robert Heinlein]] in his work [[The Star Beast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heinlein R and Harold W |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1708323 |title=Xenobiology |journal=Science |date=21 July 1961 |page=223 and 225 |accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is an emerging and developing field, the question of whether [[life]] exists elsewhere in the [[universe]] is a verifiable hypothesis and thus a valid line of [[science|scientific]] inquiry. Though once considered outside the mainstream of scientific inquiry, astrobiology has become a formalized field of study. Planetary scientist [[David Grinspoon]] calls astrobiology a field of natural philosophy, grounding speculation on the unknown, in known scientific theory.&lt;ref&gt;Grinspoon 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]]'s interest in exobiology first began with the development of the U.S. Space Program. In 1959, NASA funded its first exobiology project, and in 1960, NASA founded an Exobiology Program; Exobiology research is now one of four elements of NASA's current Astrobiology Program.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Living Universe: NASA and the Development of Astrobiology |author=Steven J. Dick and James E. Strick |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=New Brunswick, NJ |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, NASA funded the [[Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence]] (SETI) to search radio frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum for [[interstellar communication|signals]] being transmitted by [[extraterrestrial life]] outside the Solar System. NASA's [[Viking program|Viking missions]] to Mars, launched in 1976, included [[Viking biological experiments|three biology experiments]] designed to look for [[biosignature|possible signs]] of present [[life on Mars]]. The [[Mars Pathfinder]] lander in 1997 carried a scientific payload intended for exopaleontology in the hopes of finding microbial fossils entombed in the rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://exobiology.nasa.gov/ssx/Selected_Research/exopaleo_for_pathfinder.html | title=Exopaleontology at the Pathfinder Landing Site| authors=Jack D.

In the 21st century, astrobiology is a focus of a growing number of NASA and [[European Space Agency]] Solar System exploration missions. The first European workshop on astrobiology took place in May 2001 in Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/Pr_27_2001_p_EN.html |title=First European Workshop on Exo/Astrobiology |accessdate=2008-10-20 |year=2001 |work=ESA Press Release |publisher=European Space Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the outcome was the [[Aurora programme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=ESA Embraces Astrobiology |journal=Science |date=1 June 2001 |volume=292 |issue=5522 |pages=1626–1627 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/292/5522/1626?maxtosho= |doi=10.1126/science.292.5522.1626}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, NASA hosts the [[NASA Astrobiology Institute]] and a growing number of universities in the United States (e.g., [[University of Arizona]], [[Penn State University]], [[Montana State University – Bozeman|Montana State University]], [[University of Washington]], and [[Arizona State University]]&lt;ref name=&quot;astrobiology.asu.edu&quot;&gt;[http://astrobiology.asu.edu/Astrobiology/Home/Home.html]&lt;/ref&gt;), Britain (e.g., The [[University of Glamorgan]]&lt;ref name=&quot;case.glam.ac.uk&quot;&gt;[http://case.glam.ac.uk/CASE/Degrees/AstroBio.html CASE Undergraduate Degrees]&lt;/ref&gt;), Canada, Ireland, and Australia (e.g., The [[University of New South Wales]]&lt;ref name=&quot;aca.unsw.edu.au&quot;&gt;[http://aca.unsw.edu.au The Australian Centre for Astrobiology, University of New South Wales]&lt;/ref&gt;) now offer graduate degree programs in astrobiology. The [[International Astronomical Union]] regularly organizes international conferences through its Bioastronomy Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~meech/iau/ Commission 51: Bioastronomy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Advancements in the fields of astrobiology, observational astronomy and discovery of large varieties of [[extremophile]]s with extraordinary capability to thrive in the harshest environments on Earth, have led to speculation that life may possibly be thriving on many of the extraterrestrial bodies in the universe. A particular focus of current astrobiology research is the search for [[life on Mars]] due to its proximity to Earth and geological history. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that Mars has previously had a considerable amount of [[water]] on its surface, water being considered an essential precursor to the development of carbon-based life.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/mars/essential.html NOVA | Mars | Life's Little Essential | PBS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Missions specifically designed to search for life include the [[Viking program]] and [[Beagle 2]] probes, both directed to Mars. The Viking results were inconclusive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Viking Biological Investigation: Preliminary Results |journal=Science |date=1 October 1976 |author=Klein HP and Levin GV |volume=194 |issue=4260 |pages=99–105 |doi=10.1126/science.194.4260.99 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/194/4260/99|format= |accessdate=2008-08-15 |pmid=17793090 |bibcode = 1976Sci...194...99K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Beagle 2 failed to transmit from the surface and is assumed to have crashed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMAPB8A9HE_Life_0.html |title=Possible evidence found for Beagle 2 location |accessdate=2008-08-18 |date=21 December 2005 |publisher=European Space Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt; A future mission with a strong astrobiology role would have been the [[Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter]], designed to study the frozen moons of Jupiter&amp;mdash;some of which may have liquid water&amp;mdash;had it not been cancelled. Recently, the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix lander]] probed the environment for past and present [[planetary habitability]] of [[microbe|microbial]] [[life on Mars]], and to research the history of water there.

In 2011, NASA plans to launch the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] rover which will continue the search for past or present life on [[Mars]] using a variety of scientific instruments. The [[European Space Agency]] has been developing the [[ExoMars]] astrobiology rover, which is to be launched in 2018.

==Methodology==
=== Planetary habitability ===
{{Main|Planetary habitability}}

When looking for life on other planets, some simplifying assumptions are useful to reduce the size of the task of the astrobiologist. One is to assume that the vast majority of life forms in our galaxy are based on [[Carbon-based life|carbon chemistries]], as are all life forms on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |title= Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: An Interview With Dr. Farid Salama |accessdate=2008-10-20 |year=2000 |work=Astrobiology magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is possible that [[Alternative biochemistry|non-carbon-based life forms]] exist, carbon is well known for the unusually wide variety of [[molecule]]s that can be formed around it. Carbon is the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant element]] in the universe and the energy required to make or break a bond is just at an appropriate level for building molecules which are not only stable, but also reactive. The fact that carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms allows for the building of arbitrarily long and [[organic compound|complex molecules]].

The presence of liquid water is a useful assumption, as it is a common molecule and provides an excellent environment for the formation of complicated carbon-based molecules that could eventually lead to the emergence of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/astrobiology-spsc-04/ |title=Astrobiology |accessdate=2008-10-20 |year=2006 |publisher=Macmillan Science Library: Space Sciences. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers posit environments of [[ammonia]], or more likely, water-ammonia mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article2057.html |title=The Ammonia-Oxidizing Gene |accessdate=2008-10-20 |first=Penn State |date=19 August 2006 |publisher=Astrobiology Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A third assumption is to focus on [[sun]]-like [[star]]s. This comes from the idea of [[planetary habitability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |title=Stars and Habitable Planets |accessdate=2008-10-20 |year=2007 |publisher=Sol Company }}&lt;/ref&gt; Very big stars have relatively short lifetimes, meaning that life would not likely have time to evolve on [[planet]]s orbiting them. Very small stars provide so little heat and warmth that only planets in very close orbits around them would not be frozen solid, and in such close orbits these planets would be [[Tidal lock|tidally &quot;locked&quot;]] to the star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/display/?id=223364&amp;source=r |title=M Dwarfs: The Search for Life is On |accessdate=2008-10-20 |date=29 August 2005 |publisher=Red Orbit &amp; Astrobiology Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without a thick [[atmosphere]], one side of the planet would be perpetually baked and the other perpetually frozen. In 2005, the question was brought back to the attention of the [[scientific community]], as the long lifetimes of [[red dwarf]]s could allow some biology on planets with thick atmospheres. This is significant, as red dwarfs are extremely common. (See [[Habitability of red dwarf systems]]).

It is estimated that 10% of the stars in our galaxy are sun-like; there are about a thousand such stars within 100 light-years of our [[Sun]]. These stars would be useful [[Project Phoenix (SETI)|primary targets]] for interstellar listening. Since Earth is the only planet known to harbor [[life]], there is no evident way to know if any of the simplifying assumptions are correct.

===Elements of astrobiology===
==== Astronomy ====
{{Main|Astronomy}}

[[Image:OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Artist's impression of the [[extrasolar planet]] [[OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb]] orbiting its star 20,000 [[light-years]] from [[Earth]]; this planet was discovered with [[gravitational microlensing]].]]
[[Image:Keplerspacecraft-20110215.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[NASA]] [[Kepler mission]], launched in March 2009, searches for [[extrasolar planets]]]]
Most astronomy-related astrobiological research falls into the category of [[extrasolar planet]] (exoplanet) detection, the hypothesis being that if life arose on Earth, then it could also arise on other planets with similar characteristics. To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect Earth-like exoplanets are under development, most notably [[NASA]]'s [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] (TPF) and [[European Space Agency|ESA's]] [[Darwin (ESA)|Darwin]] programs. Additionally, NASA has launched the [[Kepler mission]] in March 2009, and the [[French Space Agency]] has launched the [[COROT]] space mission in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/ |title=Kepler Mission |accessdate=2008-10-20 |year=2008 |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smsc.cnes.fr/COROT/ |title=The COROT space telescope |accessdate=2008-10-20 |date=2008-10-17 |publisher=CNES }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several less ambitious ground-based efforts underway. (See [[exoplanet]]).

The goal of these missions is not only to detect Earth-sized planets, but also to directly detect light from the planet so that it may be studied [[spectroscopy|spectroscopically]]. By examining planetary spectra, it would be possible to determine the basic composition of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere and/or surface; given this knowledge, it may be possible to assess the likelihood of life being found on that planet. A NASA research group, the Virtual Planet Laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vpl.astro.washington.edu/main/about_vpl.html |title=The Virtual Planet Laboratory |accessdate=2008-10-20 |year=2008 |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt; is using computer modeling to generate a wide variety of virtual planets to see what they would look like if viewed by TPF or Darwin. It is hoped that once these missions come online, their spectra can be cross-checked with these virtual planetary spectra for features that might indicate the presence of life. The [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] temporal variability of extrasolar planets may also provide clues to their surface and atmospheric properties.

An estimate for the number of planets with ''intelligent'' [[extraterrestrial life]] can be gleaned from the [[Drake equation]], essentially an equation expressing the probability of intelligent life as the product of factors such as the fraction of planets that might be habitable and the fraction of planets on which life might arise:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setileague.org/general/drake.htm |title=What is the Drake Equation? |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Ford |first=Steve |month=August | year=1995 |publisher=SETI League }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;math&gt;N = R^{*} ~ \times ~ f_{p} ~ \times ~ n_{e} ~ \times ~ f_{l} ~ \times ~ f_{i} ~ \times ~ f_{c} ~ \times ~ L&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
where, '''N''' = The number of communicative civilizations, '''R*''' = The rate of formation of suitable stars (stars such as our Sun), '''fp''' = The fraction of those stars with planets. (Current evidence indicates that planetary systems may be common for stars like the Sun), '''ne''' = The number of Earth-like worlds per planetary system, '''fl''' = The fraction of those Earth-like planets where life actually develops, '''fi''' = The fraction of life sites where intelligence develops, '''fc''' = The fraction of communicative planets (those on which electromagnetic communications technology develops), '''L''' = The &quot;lifetime&quot; of communicating civilizations.

However, whilst the rationale behind the equation is sound, it is unlikely that the equation will be constrained to reasonable error limits any time soon. The first term, Number of Stars, is generally constrained within a few orders of magnitude. The second and third terms, Stars with Planets and Planets with Habitable Conditions, are being evaluated for the sun's neighborhood. The problem of the formula is that it is not usable to emit [[hypothesis]] because it contains units that can never be verified. It has permitted that the applications of the formula had been related to simplistic or [[pseudoscientific]] arguments.&lt;ref name=BC&gt;{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 2011-01-17 | date = 26 September 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another associated topic is the [[Fermi paradox]], which suggests that if intelligent life is common in the [[universe]], then there should be obvious signs of it. This is the purpose of projects like [[SETI]], which tries to detect signs of radio transmissions from intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations.

Another active research area in astrobiology is [[Planetary system]] formation. It has been suggested that the peculiarities of our [[Solar System]] (for example, the presence of [[Jupiter]] as a protective shield&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europlanet-eu.org/demo/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=999 |title=Jupiter: Friend or foe? |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Horner |first=Jonathan |coauthors=Barrie Jones |date=24 August 2007 |publisher=Europlanet }}&lt;/ref&gt;) may have greatly increased the probability of intelligent life arising on our planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=3910 |title=The Role Of Astrobiology in Solar System Exploration |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Jakosky |first=Bruce |coauthors=David Des Marais, ''et al.'' |date=14 September 2001 |work=NASA |publisher=SpaceRef.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1222 |title=Coming Soon: &quot;Good&quot; Jupiters |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Bortman |first=Henry |date=29 September 2004 |work=Astrobiology Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; No firm conclusions have been reached so far.

====Biology====

[[Image:Blacksmoker in Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hydrothermal vent]]s are able to support [[extremophile|extremophile bacteria]] on [[Earth]] and may also support life in other parts of the cosmos.]]
Biology and chemistry, as opposed to physics, do not admit ideological contexts: either the biological phenomena are real, or they are abstract. Biologists cannot say that a process or phenomenon, by being mathematically possible, have to exist forcibly in the real nature. For biologists, the ground of speculations is well noticeable, and biologists specify what is speculative and what is not.&lt;ref name=BC/&gt;

Until the 1970s, [[life]] was believed to be entirely dependent on energy from the [[Sun]]. Plants on Earth's surface capture energy from sunlight to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] sugars from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen in the process, and are then eaten by oxygen-respiring animals, passing their energy up the [[food chain]]. Even life in the ocean depths, where sunlight cannot reach, was believed to obtain its nourishment either from consuming organic detritus rained down from the surface waters or from eating animals that did.&lt;ref name=&quot;smoker&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Black Smokers and Giant Worms |author=Chamberlin, Sean |year=1999 |work=Fullerton College |url=http://www.courseworld.com/ocean/smokers.html |accessdate=11 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A world's ability to support life was thought to depend on its access to [[sunlight]]. However, in 1977, during an exploratory dive to the [[Galapagos Rift]] in the deep-sea exploration submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]'', scientists discovered colonies of [[giant tube worm]]s, [[clam]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[mussel]]s, and other assorted creatures clustered around undersea volcanic features known as [[black smoker]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;smoker&quot;/&gt; These creatures thrive despite having no access to sunlight, and it was soon discovered that they comprise an entirely independent food chain. Instead of plants, the basis for this food chain is a form of [[bacterium]] that derives its energy from oxidization of reactive chemicals, such as [[hydrogen]] or [[hydrogen sulfide]], that bubble up from the Earth's interior. This [[chemosynthesis]] revolutionized the study of biology by revealing that life need not be sun-dependent; it only requires water and an energy gradient in order to exist. 

[[Extremophiles]] (organisms able to survive in extreme environments) are a core research element for astrobiologists. Such organisms include [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] able to survive kilometers below the ocean's surface near [[hydrothermal vent]]s and [[microbe]]s that thrive in highly acidic environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/animalworld/050207_extremophiles.html |title=Wild Things: The Most Extreme Creatures |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Carey |first=Bjorn |date=7 February 2005 |work=Live Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now known that extremophiles thrive in ice, boiling water, acid, the water core of nuclear reactors, salt crystals, toxic waste and in a range of other extreme habitats that were previously thought to be inhospitable for life.&lt;ref name=Cavicchioli &gt;{{cite journal|title=Extremophiles and the search for extraterrestrial life.|journal=Astrobiology|date=Fall 2002 |first=R. |last=Cavicchioli |coauthors= |volume=2 |issue=3|pages=281–92 |pmid=12530238 |format=|accessdate=2008-10-20|doi=10.1089/153110702762027862 |bibcode = 2002AsBio...2..281C }}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened up a new avenue in astrobiology by massively expanding the number of possible extraterrestrial habitats. Characterization of these organisms&amp;mdash;their environments and their evolutionary pathways&amp;mdash;is considered a crucial component to understanding how life might evolve elsewhere in the universe. Some organisms able to withstand exposure to the vacuum and radiation of space include the lichen fungi [[Rhizocarpon geographicum]] and [[Xanthoria elegans]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-979261711.html Article: Lichens survive in harsh environment of outer space]&lt;/ref&gt; the bacterium ''[[Bacillus safensis]]'',&lt;ref name=ThePlanetaryReport &gt;The Planetary Report, Volume XXIX, number 2, March/April 2009, &quot;We make it happen!

On 2 December 2010, it was announced that an extremophile bacterium ([[GFAJ-1]]) can be coaxed into partially substituting [[arsenic]] for [[phosphorus]] in some of its basic chemistry under laboratory conditions.&lt;ref name='arsenic extremophile'&gt;{{cite news | first = Jason Palmer | title = Arsenic-loving bacteria may help in hunt for alien life | date = 2 December 2010 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11886943 | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery gives weight to the long-standing idea that life on other planets may have a radically different chemical makeup and may help in the search for alien life.&lt;ref name='arsenic extremophile'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Henry Bortman | title = Arsenic-Eating Bacteria Opens New Possibilities for Alien Life | date = 2 December 2010 | publisher = Space.com | url = http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/arsenic-bacteria-alien-life-101202.html | work = Space.com | accessdate = 2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]], distinct from the [[Evolution#Evolution of life|evolution of life]], is another ongoing field of research. [[Oparin]] and [[J. B. S. Haldane|Haldane]] postulated that the conditions on the early Earth were conducive to the formation of [[organic compound]]s from [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic elements]] and thus to the formation of many of the chemicals common to all forms of life we see today. The study of this process, known as [[Abiogenesis|prebiotic chemistry]], has made some progress, but it is still unclear whether or not life could have formed in such a manner on Earth. The alternative theory of [[panspermia]] is that the first elements of life may have formed on another planet with even more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) and then have been carried over to Earth by a variety of means.

==== Astrogeology ====
{{Main|Geology of solar terrestrial planets}}

[[Geology of solar terrestrial planets|Astrogeology]] is a [[planetary science]] discipline concerned with the [[geology]] of the [[celestial bodies]] such as the [[planet]]s and their [[moon]]s, [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[meteorite]]s. The information gathered by this discipline allows the measure of a [[planet]]'s or a [[natural satellite]]'s potential to develop and sustain [[life]], or [[planetary habitability]].

An additional discipline of astrogeology is [[geochemistry]], which involves study of the [[chemistry|chemical]] composition of the [[Earth]] and other [[planet]]s, chemical processes and reactions that govern the composition of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s and [[soil]]s, the cycles of matter and energy and their interaction with the [[hydrosphere]] and the [[atmosphere]] of the planet. Specializations include [[cosmochemistry]], [[biochemistry]] and [[organic geochemistry]].

The [[fossil record]] provides the oldest known evidence for [[life on Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/fossils/succession.html |title=Fossil SUccession |accessdate=2008-10-20 |date=14 August 1997 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey }}&lt;/ref&gt; By examining this evidence, [[paleontologists]] are able to understand better the types of organisms that arose on the early Earth. Some regions on Earth, such as the [[Pilbara]] in [[Western Australia]] and the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] of Antarctica, are also considered to be geological analogs to regions of Mars, and as such, might be able to provide clues on how to search for past [[life on Mars]].

People have long speculated about the possibility of life in settings other than Earth, however, speculation on the nature of life elsewhere often has paid little heed to constraints imposed by the nature of biochemistry.&lt;ref name='Pace'&gt;{{cite journal|title=The universal nature of biochemistry|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA|date=30 January 2001|first=Norman R.|last=Pace|coauthors=|volume=98|issue=3|pages=805–808 |id= |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/98/3/805.full|format=|accessdate=2010-03-20|pmid=11158550|doi=10.1073/pnas.98.3.805|pmc=33372 |bibcode = 2001PNAS...98..805P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The likelihood that life throughout the universe is probably carbon-based is encouraged by the fact that carbon is one of the most abundant of the higher elements. Only two of the natural atoms, [[carbon]] and [[silicon]], are known to serve as the backbones of molecules sufficiently large to carry biological information. As the structural basis for life, one of carbon's important features is that unlike silicon it can readily engage in the formation of chemical bonds with many other atoms, thereby allowing for the chemical versatility required to conduct the reactions of biological metabolism and propagation. The various organic functional groups, composed of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and a host of metals, such as iron, magnesium, and zinc, provide the enormous diversity of chemical reactions necessarily catalyzed by a living organism. Silicon, in contrast, interacts with only a few other atoms, and the large silicon molecules are monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules.&lt;ref name=BC/&gt;&lt;ref name='Pace'/&gt; Indeed, it seems likely that the basic building blocks of life anywhere will be similar to our own, in the generality if not in the detail.&lt;ref name='Pace'/&gt; Although terrestrial life and life that might arise independently of Earth are expected to use many similar, if not identical, building blocks, they also are expected to have some biochemical qualities that are unique. If life has had a comparable impact elsewhere in the solar system, the relative abundances of chemicals key for its survival - whatever they may be - could betray its presence. Whatever extraterrestrial life may be, its tendency to chemically alter its environment might just give it away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Michael Marshall | title = Telltale chemistry could betray ET | date = 21 January 2011 | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20927962.700-telltale-chemistry-could-betray-et.html | work = New Scientists | accessdate = 2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rare Earth hypothesis ==
{{Main|Rare Earth hypothesis}}

This hypothesis states that based on astrobiological findings, multi-cellular life forms found on Earth may actually be more of a rarity than scientists initially assumed. It provides a possible answer to the Fermi paradox which suggests, &quot;If extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren't they obvious?&quot; It is apparently in opposition to the [[principle of mediocrity]], assumed by famed astronomers [[Frank Drake]], [[Carl Sagan]], and others. The Principle of Mediocrity suggests that life on Earth is not exceptional, but rather that life is more than likely to be found on innumerable other worlds.

The [[anthropic principle]] states that fundamental laws of the universe work specifically in a way that life would be possible. The anthropic principle supports the Rare Earth Hypothesis by arguing the overall elements that are needed to support life on Earth are so fine-tuned that it is nigh impossible for another just like it to exist by random chance (note that these terms are used by scientists in a different way from the vernacular conception of them). However, [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared the claim that the universe is fine-tuned for the benefit of our kind of life to saying that sausages were made long and narrow so that they could fit into modern hot dog buns, or saying that ships had been invented to house [[barnacle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| last=Gould| first=Stephen Jay| year =1998| title=Clear Thinking in the Sciences |booktitle=Lectures at Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gould| first=Stephen Jay | year= 2002 | title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The systematic search for possible life outside of Earth is a valid multidisciplinary scientific endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/nai/ NASA Astrobiology Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Glamorgan]], UK, started just such a degree in 2006,&lt;ref name=&quot;case.glam.ac.uk&quot;/&gt; and the American government funds the [[NASA Astrobiology Institute]]. However, characterization of non-Earth life is unsettled; hypotheses and predictions as to its existence and origin vary widely, but at the present, the development of theories to inform and support the exploratory search for life may be considered astrobiology's most concrete practical application.

[[Biologist]] [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]] and [[mathematician]] [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]], amongst others, consider '''xenobiology''' separate from astrobiology. Cohen and Stewart stipulate that astrobiology is the search for Earth-like life outside of our solar system and say that xenobiologists are concerned with the possibilities open to us once we consider that life need not be carbon-based or oxygen-breathing, so long as it has the defining [[characteristics of life]]. (See [[carbon chauvinism]]).

In 2004, the spectral signature of [[methane]] was detected in the Martian atmosphere by both Earth-based telescopes as well as by the [[Mars Express]] probe.

;Planetary systems
It is possible that some planets, like the gas giant [[Jupiter]] in our [[solar system]], may have moons with solid surfaces or liquid oceans that are more hospitable. Most of the planets so far discovered outside our solar system are hot gas giants thought to be inhospitable to life, so it is not yet known whether our solar system, with a warm, rocky, metal-rich inner planet such as Earth, is of an aberrant composition. Improved detection methods and increased observing time will undoubtedly discover more planetary systems, and possibly some more like ours. For example, [[NASA]]'s [[Kepler Mission]] seeks to discover Earth-sized planets around other stars by measuring minute changes in the star's [[light curve]] as the planet passes between the star and the spacecraft. Progress in [[infrared astronomy]] and [[submillimeter astronomy]] has revealed the constituents of other [[star system]]s. Infrared searches have detected belts of dust and [[asteroid]]s around distant stars, underpinning the formation of planets.

;Planetary habitability
{{main|Planetary habitability}}
Efforts to answer questions such as the abundance of potentially habitable planets in [[habitable zone]]s and chemical precursors have had much success. Numerous [[extrasolar planet]]s have been detected using the [[Doppler spectroscopy|wobble method]] and transit method, showing that planets around other [[star]]s are more numerous than previously postulated. The first Earth-like extrasolar planet to be discovered within its star's habitable zone is [[Gliese 581 c]], which was found using [[radial velocity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gliese&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Ker | last=Than | coauthors= | title=Major Discovery: New Planet Could Harbor Water and Life | date=24 April 2007 | publisher=Space.com | url =http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070424_hab_exoplanet.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-20 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research into the environmental limits of life and the workings of extreme [[ecosystem]]s is also ongoing, enabling researchers to predict what planetary environments might be most likely to harbor life. Missions such as the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix lander]], [[Mars Science Laboratory]], [[ExoMars]] to Mars, the [[Cassini probe]] to [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and the &quot;Ice Clipper&quot; mission to [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] hope to further explore the possibilities of life on other [[planet]]s in our [[solar system]].

An '''air show''' is an event at which [[aviator]]s display their flying skills and the capabilities of their [[aircraft]] to spectators in [[aerobatics]]. Air shows without aerobatic displays, having only aircraft displayed parked on the ground, are called &quot;static air shows&quot;.

Some air shows are held as a business venture or as a trade event where aircraft, avionics and other services are promoted to potential customers. Many air shows are held in support of local, national or military charities. [[Military]] air firms often organise air shows at military airfields as a public relations exercise to thank the local community, promote military careers and raise the profile of the military.

Air show &quot;seasons&quot; vary around the world. Whereas the United States enjoys a long season that generally runs from March to November, other areas often have much shorter seasons. The European season usually starts in late April or Early May and is usually over by mid October. The [[Middle East]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] hold their events between January and March. However,  for many acts the &quot;off season&quot; does not mean a period of inactivity, they use time for maintenance and practice.

The type of displays seen at an event are constrained by a number of factors, including the weather and visibility. Most aviation authorities now publish rules and guidance on minimum display heights and criteria for differing conditions. In addition to the weather, pilots and organizers must also consider local airspace restrictions. Most exhibitors will plan &quot;full,&quot; &quot;rolling&quot; and &quot;flat&quot; display for varying weather and airspace conditions.

The types of shows vary greatly. Some are large scale military events with large flying displays and ground exhibitions while others held at small local airstrips can often feature just one or two hours of flying with just a few [[Stall (enclosure)|stall]]s on the ground. Air Displays can be held during day or night with the latter becoming increasingly popular. Shows don't always take place over airfields; some have been held over the grounds of stately homes or castles and over the sea at coastal resorts.

==Attractions==
[[File:red.bull.air.race.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|Air racing at an air show in [[England]]: the [[Red Bull Air Race]] heat held at [[Kemble Airfield]], [[Gloucestershire]]. The aircraft fly singly, and pass between pairs of pylons]]
Before the [[World War II|Second World War]], air shows were associated with long distance air races, often lasting many days and covering thousands of miles. While the [[Reno Air Races]] keep this tradition alive, most air shows today primarily feature a series of aerial demos of short duration.

Most air shows will feature [[warbird]]s, aerobatics, and demonstrations of modern military aircraft, and many air shows offer a variety of other aeronautical attractions as well, such as wing-walking, radio-controlled aircraft, water/slurry drops from firefighting aircraft, simulated helicopter rescues and [[sky diving]].

Specialist aerobatic aircraft have powerful piston engines, light weight and big control surfaces, making them capable of very high roll rates and accelerations. A skilled pilot will be able to climb vertically, perform very tight turns, tumble his aircraft end-over-end and perform manoeuvres during loops.

[[File:F-111-Fuel-Dump,-Avalon,-VIC-23.03.2007.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]] [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111]] performing a [[Fuel dumping#Dump-and-burn|dump-and-burn]] [[Fuel dumping|fuel dump]] at the [[Australian International Airshow]]]]

Solo military jet demos, also known as tactical demo, feature one aircraft, usually a strike fighter or an advanced trainer. The demonstration focuses on the capabilities of modern aircraft used in combat operations. The display will usually demonstrate the aircraft's very short (and often very loud) takeoff rolls, fast speeds, slow approach speeds, as well as their ability to quickly make tight turns, to climb quickly, and their ability to be precisely controlled at a large range of speeds. Manoeuvres include aileron rolls, barrel rolls, hesitation rolls, Cuban-8s, tight turns, high-alpha flight, a high-speed pass, double Immelmans, and touch-and-gos. Tactical demos may include simulated bomb drops, sometimes with pyrotechnics on the ground for effect. Aircraft with special characteristics that give them unique capabilities will often display those in their demos; For example, Russian fighters with [[Thrust vectoring]] may be used to perform [[Pugachev's Cobra]] or the [[Kulbit]], among other difficult manoeuvers that cannot be performed by other aircraft. Similarly, an [[F-22]] pilot may hover his jet in the air with the nose pointed straight up, a [[Harrier Jump Jet|Harrier]] or [[V-22|Osprey]] pilot may perform a vertical landing or vertical takeoff, and so on.

==Safety==
[[File:crash.arp.600pix.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mountain Home Air Force Base]], [[Idaho]], September 14, 2003: [[U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds]] Captain Christopher Stricklin [[Ejection seat|ejecting]] from his [[F-16]] after realizing he could not pull up in time from a [[Split S|Split-S]] and ensuring the aircraft would not crash into spectators. The aircraft was destroyed less than a second later with no loss of life.]]

Air shows present some risk to spectators and aviators. Accidents occur, sometimes with a large loss of life, such as the [[Ramstein airshow disaster|1988 disaster at Ramstein Air Base]] in [[Germany]] and the [[Sknyliv airshow disaster|2002 air show crash at Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]. Because of these accidents, the various aviation authorities around the world have created set rules and guidance for those running and participating in air displays. Air displays are often monitored by aviation authorities to ensure safe procedures.

Rules govern the distance from the crowds that aircraft must fly. These vary according to the rating of the pilot/crew, the type of aircraft and the way the aircraft is being flown. For instance, slower lighter aircraft are usually allowed closer and lower to the crowd than larger, faster types. Also, a fighter jet flying straight and level will be able to do so closer to the crowd and lower than if it were performing a roll or a loop.

Pilots can get authorisations for differing types of displays (i.e. limbo flying, basic aerobatics to unlimited aerobatics) and to differing minimum base heights above the ground. To gain such authorisations, the pilots will have to demonstrate to an examiner that they can perform to those limits without endangering themselves, ground crew or spectators.

Despite display rules and guidances, accidents have continued to happen. However, air show accidents are rare and where there is proper supervision air shows have impressive safety records. Each year, organisations such as [http://www.airshows.org The International Council of Air Shows] and [http://www.european-airshow.com The European Airshow Council] meet and discuss various subjects including air show safety where accidents are discussed and lessons learnt.

==Weather==
Air shows, and other big shows such as [[agricultural show]]s, on grassy land, are vulnerable to continued heavy rain [[waterlogging]] the ground, and making the [[cloudbase]] too low for flying, forcing cancellation, or the show ending early, costing much money for the show's organizers, as people and parking cars have difficulty moving about and turn the land into a morass, and the organizers may be tempted to put straw or cinders down to make movement easier, and the owner of the land cannot accept the resulting damage.

    <title>Anthropic principle</title>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[physics]] and [[cosmology]], the '''anthropic principle''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical argument]] that observations of the physical [[universe]] must be compatible with the [[conscious]] [[life]] that observes it. Some proponents of the argument reason that it explains why the universe has the [[age of universe|age]] and the [[fundamental physical constant]]s necessary to accommodate conscious life. As a result, they believe that the fact that the universe's fundamental constants are within the [[Fine-tuned universe|narrow range thought to allow life]] is not remarkable. 

The strong anthropic principle as explained by [[John D. Barrow|Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler|Tipler]] (see [[Anthropic principle#Variants|variants]]) states that this is all the case because conscious life, in some sense, needed to exist. Critics argue in favor of a weak anthropic principle, which states that the universe's fine tuning amounts to [[selection bias]]; in an infinite universe, some worlds might [[evolve]] conscious life. [[Douglas Adams]] used the metaphor of a living puddle examining its own shape, since, to those living creatures, the universe may appear to fit them perfectly (while in fact, ''they'' simply fit the ''universe'' perfectly).

==Definition and basis==
The principle was formulated as a response to a [[Fine-tuned Universe|series of observations]] that the laws of nature and parameters of the Universe take on values that are consistent with conditions for life as we know it rather than a set of values that would not be consistent with life as observed on [[Earth]].  The anthropic principle states that this phenomenon is a necessity because living observers wouldn't be able to exist, and hence, observe the Universe, were these laws and constants not constituted in this way.

The term ''[[wikt:anthropic|anthropic]]'' in &quot;anthropic principle&quot; has been argued &lt;ref&gt;Mosterín (2005) pp. 12 http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1658/&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; to be a [[misnomer]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;anthropic&quot; means &quot;of or pertaining to mankind or humans&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  While singling out our kind of carbon-based life, none of the finely tuned phenomena require [[human]] life or [[carbon chauvinism|demand that carbon-based life develop intelligence]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Cosmo/ant_encyc.pdf The Anthropic Principle], Victor J. Stenger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TZ5FLwnCTMAC&amp;client=firefox-a Anthropic Bias], Nick Bostrom, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; however the detection and formulation of this principle, born from a long and laborious history of scientific observations, trials and errors, studying, ingenuity and inventions of necessary instrumentation, does make this an intellectual domain exclusive to humans above all other life forms on Earth and beyond, so far as science has observed. Both the scientific principles and the intelligence required for their detection are non-material phenomena and transcend carbon-based life forms which said non-material phenomena give rise to in the first place through the observed scientific principles and laws governing them moment by moment.

The anthropic principle has given rise to some confusion and controversy, partly because the phrase has been applied to several distinct ideas. All versions of the principle have been accused of discouraging the search for a deeper physical understanding of the universe. Those attempting to explain the anthropic principle often invoke ideas of [[multiverse|multiple universes]] or an [[intelligent designer]],&lt;ref&gt;The Limitations of Scientific Truth: Why Science Can't Answer Life's Questions - By Nigel Brush (2005), ISBN 978-0-8254-2253-9 pp. 215&lt;/ref&gt; both controversial and criticized for being [[falsifiability|untestable]] and therefore critics of the anthropic principle may point out that the anthropic principle is more of a philosophical concept, not a scientific one. One way to bypass the controversy is to emphasize the '''weak anthropic principle''': ''&quot;...conditions that are observed in the universe must allow the observer to exist.&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anthropic%20principle Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; In mathematics and philosophy, the weak form of a statement is
