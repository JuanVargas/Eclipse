, contains the material with which the created world will be made.  Chaos may be described as a having the consistency of vapor or water, dimensionless, and sometimes salty or muddy.  These myths associate chaos with evil and oblivion, in contrast to &quot;order&quot; (''cosmos'') which is the good.  The act of creation is the bringing of order from disorder, and in many of these cultures it is believed that at some point the forces preserving order and form will weaken and the world will once again be engulfed into the abyss.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World parent===
There are two types of world parent myths, both describing a separation or splitting of a primeval entity, the world parent or parents.  One form describes the primeval state as an eternal union of two parents, and the creation takes place when the two are pulled apart.  The two parents are commonly identified as Sky (usually male) and Earth (usually female) who in the primeval state were so tightly bound to each other that no offspring could emerge.  These myths often depict creation as the result of a sexual union, and serve as genealogical record of the deities born from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the second form of world parent myth, creation itself springs from dismembered parts of the body of the primeval being.  Often in these stories the limbs, hair, blood, bones or organs of the primeval being are somehow severed or sacrificed to transform into sky, earth, animal or plant life, and other worldly features. These myths tend to emphasize creative forces as animistic in nature rather than sexual, and depict the sacred as the elemental and integral component of the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergence===

In emergence myths humanity emerges from another world into the one they currently inhabit.   The previous world is often considered the womb of the [[earth mother]], and the process of emergence is likened to the act of giving birth.  The role of midwife is usually played by a female deity, like the spider woman of Native American mythology.  Male characters rarely figure into these stories, and scholars often consider them in counterpoint to male oriented creation myths, like those of the [[ex nihilo]] variety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leeming 2005&quot;/&gt;

Emergence myths commonly describe the creation of people and/or supernatural beings as a staged ascent or [[metamorphosis]] from nascent forms through a series of [[subterranean]] worlds to arrive at their current place and form.  Often the passage from one world or stage to the next is impelled by inner forces, a process of germination or gestation from earlier, embryonic forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|pages=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The genre is most commonly found in Native American cultures where the myths frequently link the final emergence of people from a hole opening to the underworld to stories about their subsequent migrations and eventual settlement in their current homelands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler-Voegelin|Moore|1957|pages=66–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth-diver===

The earth-diver is a common character in various traditional creation myths. In these stories a supreme being usually sends an animal into the primal waters to find bits of sand or mud with which to build habitable land.  Some scholars interpret these myths psychologically while others interpret them [[Cosmogony|cosmogonically]]. In both cases emphasis is placed on beginnings emanating from the depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t279.e87 |title=Earth‐Diver Creation |author=David Adams Leeming and Margaret Adams Leeming |year=2009 |work=A Dictionary of Creation Myths |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;!-- Oxford Reference Online --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Earth-diver myths are common in [[Native American mythology|Native American folklore]] but can be found among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] and [[Yukaghir]], the [[Tatars]] and many [[Uralic mythologies|Finno-Ugrian]] traditions.  The pattern of distribution of these stories suggest they have a common origin in the [[Geography_of_Asia#East_Asia|eastern Asiatic]] coastal region, spreading as peoples migrated west into [[Siberia]] and east to the North American continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Booth|1984|pages=168–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristic of many Native American myths, earth-diver creation stories begin as beings and potential forms linger asleep or suspended in the primordial realm.  The earth-diver is among the first of them to awaken and lay the necessary groundwork by building suitable lands where the coming creation will be able to live.  In many cases, these stories will describe a series of failed attempts to make land before the solution is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leonard|McClure|2004|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Essen Kreuzgang 3 Kruzifix.jpg|thumb|The Crucifix, a cross with the ''corpus'' ([[Body of Christ]]), is an ancient symbol used within the [[Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Anglican]], and [[Lutheran]] churches, in contrast with some Protestant groups, which use only a simple cross.]]

A '''crucifix''' (from [[Latin]] ''cruci fixus'' meaning &quot;(one) fixed to a cross&quot;) is a usually three-dimensional [[Christian cross|cross]] with a representation of [[Jesus]]' body, referred to in English as the ''corpus'' (Latin for &quot;body&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=QQAVYr2Lc-YC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=crucifix+corpus&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PiYZTJKhD4Gr_Qab1eylDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=crucifix%20corpus&amp;f=false Rufolf Distelberger, ''Western Decorative Arts'' (National Gallery of Art 1993), p. 15]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZrVDmaXP6HEC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=crucifix+corpus&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XzAZTKTFIoSHOK3pyekK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwADhk#v=onepage&amp;q=crucifix%20corpus&amp;f=false Paul F. Bradshaw, ''The New SCM Dictionary of Liturgy and Worship'' (Hymns Ancient &amp; Modern Ltd, 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt; as distinct from a [[Christian cross|cross]] with no body. It is a principal symbol for many groups of [[Christianity|Christians]], and one of the most common forms of the [[Crucifixion in the arts]]. It is especially important in the [[Catholic Church]], but is also used in [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]], as well as [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches, (though less often in other [[Protestant]] churches), and it emphasizes Jesus' sacrifice — his death by [[crucifixion]], which Christians believe brought about the redemption of mankind.  Large crucifixes high across the central axis of a church, by the late [[Middle Ages]] a near-universal feature of Western churches, but now very rare, are known by the [[Old English]] term [[rood]]. Modern Roman Catholic churches often have a crucifix above the [[altar]] on the wall; for the celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], the [[Roman Rite]] of the Catholic Church requires that, &quot;on or close to the altar there is to be a cross with a figure of Christ crucified&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/GIRM.pdf General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 117.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly speaking, to be a crucifix the cross must be three-dimensional, and a painting of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] is not a crucifix.  However this distinction is not always observed.  While the cross must be three-dimensional, the &quot;corpus&quot; need not be, and in the [[Orthodox Church]] it is normally either painted on a flat surface or worked in low [[relief]] (no more than three-quarters relief).

== Description ==
[[File:Agias Triados frescos cross.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eastern Orthodox]] crucifix, from the [[Katholikon]] of Holy Trinity Monastery, [[Meteora]], [[Greece]]. The figure is flat and painted, on a board extended beyond the cross beams for the purpose.]]

The standard, four-pointed Latin crucifix consists of an upright post or ''stipes''  and a single crosspiece to which the sufferer's arms were nailed; but there may be a short projecting [[titulus|nameplate]], showing the letters [[INRI]] (Greek: INBI).  The [[Russian Orthodox]] crucifix usually has an additional third crossbar, to which the feet are nailed, and which is angled upward toward the penitent thief [[Saint Dismas]] (to the viewer's left) and downward toward the impenitent thief [[Gestas]] (to the viewer's right).  The corpus of Eastern crucifixes is normally a two-dimensional or [[low relief]] [[icon]] that shows Jesus as already dead, his face peaceful and somber.  They are rarely three-dimensional figures as in the Western tradition, although these may be found where Western influences are strong, but are more typically icons painted on a piece of wood shaped to include the double-barred cross and perhaps the edge of Christ's hips and [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and no background.  More sculptural small crucifixes in metal [[relief]] are also used in Orthodoxy (see gallery examples), including as [[pectoral cross]]es and [[blessing cross]]es.

Western crucifixes may show Christ dead or alive, the presence of the spear wound in his ribs traditionally indicating that he is dead.  In either case his face very often shows his suffering.  In Orthodoxy he has normally been shown as dead since around the end of the period of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, Gertrud,  ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II'', 1972 (English trans from German), p. 96, Lund Humphries, London, ISBN 0853313245&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern crucifixes have Jesus' two feet nailed side by side, rather than crossed one above the other, as Western crucifixes have showed them for many centuries. The [[crown of thorns]] is also generally absent in Eastern crucifixes, since the emphasis is not on Christ's suffering, but on his triumph over sin and death. The &quot;S&quot;-shaped position of Jesus' body on the cross is a [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] innovation of the late 10th century,&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 98-99&lt;/ref&gt; though also found in the German [[Gero Cross]] of the same date.  Probably more from Byzantine influence, it spread elsewhere in the West, especially to [[Italy]], by the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, though it was more usual in painting than sculpted corpuses.  Since the Renaissance the &quot;S&quot;-shape is generally much less pronounced.   Eastern Christian blessing crosses will often have the Crucifixion depicted on one side, and the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] on the other, illustrating the understanding of [[Orthodox theology]] that the Crucifixion and Resurrection are two intimately related aspects of the same act of salvation.

Another, symbolic, depiction shows a triumphant Christ (clothed in robes, rather than stripped as for His execution) with arms raised, appearing to rise up from the cross, sometimes accompanied by &quot;rays of light&quot;, or an [[Halo (religious iconography)|aureole]] encircling His Body. He may be robed as a [[prophet]], [[crown (headgear)|crown]]ed as a [[king]], and vested in a [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] as [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament#High Priest .7C Chief Priest|Great High Priest]].

On some crucifixes a skull and crossbones are shown below the corpus, referring to Golgotha ([[Calvary]]), the site at which Jesus was crucified, which the Gospels say means in Hebrew &quot;the place of the skull.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In fact this is clearly [[Aramaic]] rather than Hebrew. 'Gûlgaltâ' is the Aramaic for 'skull'. The name appears in all of the gospels except Luke, which calls the place simply Kranion 'the Skull', with no Aramaic. See [[Aramaic of Jesus]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval tradition held that it was the burial-place of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]], and that the cross of Christ was raised directly over Adam's skull, so many crucifixes manufactured in Catholic countries still show the skull and crossbones below the corpus.

Very large crucifixes have been built, the largest being the [[Cross in the Woods]] in Michigan, with a {{convert|31|ft|m}} high statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Worlds Largest Crucifixion|url=http://www.fishweb.com/maps/cheboygan/indianriver/shrine/index.html|work=Michigan Interactive|publisher=Michigan Interactive|accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
[[Image:Crucifix.JPG|thumb|An enshrined crucifix amidst the cornfields near Mureck in rural [[Styria (state)|Styria]], [[Austria]].]]

[[Roman Catholic|Roman Catholic]] (Eastern and Western Rite Catholics), Eastern Orthodox, Coptic and other Oriental Orthodox, Anglican and Lutheran Christians generally use the crucifix in public religious services. They believe the crucifix is in keeping with Scripture, which states that “we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles” ({{bibleverse|1|Cor|1:23|KJV}}). In the West [[altar cross]]es and [[processional cross]]es began to be crucifixes in the 11th century, which became general around the 14th century, as they became cheaper than before.  Since the Roman Missal of Pius V in 1570 use of a crucifix as an altar cross has been mandatory (with some exceptions) for the Catholic mass.  Eastern Christian liturgical processions called [[crucession]]s also include a cross or crucifix at their head.

Prayer in front of a crucifix is often part of devotion for Christians, especially those worshipping in a church, and private devotion in a chapel. The person may sit, stand, or kneel in front of the crucifix, sometimes looking at it in contemplation, or merely in front of it with head bowed or eyes closed. In the Anglican and Lutheran [[Holy Eucharist]], and more formal Roman Catholic [[Mass (religion)|Mass]]es, a [[procession]] begins the service in which a cross or crucifix is carried forward into the church followed by lector and servers, the priest, deacon, along with some of the other items used in the service such as the [[Gospels]] and the altar candles.  Since the [[Counter-Reformation]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Roman Missal]] of 1570&lt;/ref&gt; an [[altar cross]] in crucifix form has been compulsory in the Catholic Church, unless there is, for example, an [[altarpiece]] of the crucifixion. 

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the crucifix is often placed above the [[iconostasis]] in the church. In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] a large crucifix (&quot;[[Golgotha]]&quot;) is placed behind the [[Holy Table]] (Altar). A large crucifix is taken in procession to the center of the [[temple]] (church) during the [[Matins]] of [[Good Friday]], where it is venerated by the faithful. Sometimes the ''soma'' (corpus) is removable and will be taken down off the crucifix at [[Vespers]] that evening during the [[Gospel]] lesson describing the [[Descent from the Cross]]. The empty cross may then remain in the center of the church until the [[Paschal vigil]] (local practices vary). The [[blessing cross]] which the [[priest]] uses to bless the faithful at the [[benediction|dismissal]] will often have the crucifix on one side and an [[icon]] of the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] on the other, the side with the Resurrection being used on [[Sunday]]s and during [[Paschaltide]], and the crucifix on other days.

During the Middle Ages small crucifixes, typically hung on a wall, became normal in the personal cells or living quarters first of monks, and then all clergy, followed by the bedrooms of the [[laity]], spreading down from the top of society as these became cheap enough for the average person to afford.  By the 19th century displaying a crucifix somewhere in the general reception areas of a house became typical of Catholic homes, and this remains largely the case.

The crucifix is also one of the Church's [[sacramentals]] used by Christians. It is considered by some to be one of the most effective means of averting or opposing [[demons]], as stated by many [[exorcists]], including the famous exorcist of the Vatican, Father [[Gabriele Amorth]]. In folkloric legends it is considered to ward off [[vampires]],  [[incubi]], [[succubi]], and other evils.

Modern [[Iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] have used an inverted (upside-down) crucifix when showing disdain for [[Jesus Christ]] or the [[Catholic Church]] which believes in [[Divinity of Jesus|his divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucifer Rising: A Book of Sin, Devil Worship and Rock n' Roll (Nemesis, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Christian tradition]], [[Saint Peter]] was [[martyr]]ed by being [[Cross of St. Peter|crucified upside-down]].&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Heinrich and Sprenger, James (1486), Summers, Montague (translator - 1928), ''The Malleus Maleficarum''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

Early Protestants generally rejected the use of the crucifix, and indeed the unadorned cross, along with other traditional religious imagery, as idolatrous. [[Martin Luther]] did not object to them, and this was among his differences with [[Andreas Karlstadt]] as early as 1525.  [[John Calvin|Calvin]] was violently opposed to both cross and crucifix.  In England the Royal Chapels of Elizabeth I were most unusual among English churches in retaining crucifixes, following the Queen's personal conservative preferences. Under James I these disappeared, and their brief re-appearance in the early 1620s when James' heir was seeking a Spanish marriage was the subject of rumour and close observation by both Catholics and Protestants; when the match fell through they disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Tyacke, Nicholas in Lake, Peter and Questier, Michael C.; ''Conformity and orthodoxy in the English church, c. 1560-1660'', Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2000, ISBN 0851157971, 978085115797929-32&lt;/ref&gt;  Opposition to plain crosses has generally softened in Protestantism, but many Protestant groups still oppose the crucifix.  

In 2005, a mother accused her daughter's school in [[Derby]], England of discriminating against Christians after the teenager was suspended for refusing to take off a crucifix necklace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1504822/School-ban-on-girl-wearing-cross-%27discriminatory%27.html The Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[British Airways]] has faced legal action and calls for a boycott by Christians after it ruled an employee could not display a crucifix on her necklace (a rule it has now relaxed).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2006/oct/15/theairlineindustry.religion The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; A British [[prison]] ordered a multi-faith chapel to remove all crucifixes, presumably to avoid offending Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/3775702/Prison-chapel-not-to-have-a-crucifix.html Prison chapel not to have a crucifix ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 in [[Spain]], a local judge ordered crucifixes removed from public schools to settle a decades-old dispute over whether crucifixes should be displayed in public buildings in a non-confessional state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/europe/features/article_1446455.php/&amp;quotWar_of_crucifix%22_questions_Catholic_predominance_in_Spain__Feature__ Monster and Critics]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 Quebec government report recommended that the crucifix of the National Assembly be removed to achieve greater pluralism, but the local Liberal party refused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/may/08052209.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2011, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled, in the ''[[Lautsi v. Italy]]'' case, that the requirement in Italian law that crucifixes be displayed in classrooms of state schools does not violate the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=open&amp;documentId=883171&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Press release of the European Court of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/resources/hudoc/lautsi_and_others_v__italy.pdf Full text of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://religionclause.blogspot.com/2011/03/european-courts-grand-chamber-upholds.html Summary of the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crucifixes are common in most other Italian official buildings, including [[law court|courts of law]].

On 24 March 2011, the Constitutional Court of Peru ruled that the presence of crucifixes in courts of law does not violate the secular nature of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/peru-court-upholds-presence-of-crucifix-in-public-places/ Peru court upholds presence of crucifix in public places]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[physical cosmology]], the '''Copernican principle''', named after [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], states that the Earth is not in a central, specially favored position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = H. Bondi | authorlink = Hermann Bondi | title = Cosmology | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1952 | pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the principle has been generalized to the [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] concept that humans are not privileged observers of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = J. A. Peacock | title = Cosmological Physics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | page = 66 | year = 1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it is equivalent to the [[mediocrity principle]], with important implications for the [[philosophy of science]]. 

Since the 1990s the term has been used (interchangeably with &quot;the Copernicus method&quot;) for [[J. Richard Gott]]'s [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian-inference]]-based prediction of duration of ongoing events, a generalized version of the [[Doomsday argument]].

== Origin and implications ==
[[Michael Rowan-Robinson]] emphasizes the importance of the Copernican principle: &quot;It is evident that in the post-Copernican era of human history, no well-informed and rational person can imagine that the Earth occupies a unique position in the universe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Michael Rowan-Robinson]] | title = Cosmology| edition = 3rd | publisher = Clarendon Press, Oxford | pages = 62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hermann Bondi]] named the principle after Copernicus in the mid-20th century, although the principle itself dates back to the 16th-17th century [[paradigm shift]] away from the [[Ptolemaic system]], which placed [[Earth]] at the center of the [[Universe]]. Copernicus demonstrated the motion of the planets can be explained without the assumption that Earth is centrally located and stationary. He argued that the [[apparent retrograde motion]] of the planets is an illusion caused by Earth's movement around the [[Sun]], which the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]] placed at the centre of the Universe. Copernicus himself was mainly motivated by technical dissatisfaction with the earlier system and not by support for any mediocrity principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Thomas Kuhn]] | title = The Copernican Revolution | publisher = Harvard University Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, although the Copernican heliocentric model is often described as &quot;demoting&quot; Earth from its central role it had in the Ptolemaic geocentric model, neither Copernicus nor other 15th- and 16th-century scientists and philosophers viewed it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/scientificamerican0301-24a |journal= Scientific American |year=2001 |volume=284 |issue=3 |pages=24 |title= Copernican Counterrevolution |author= [[George Musser]]  |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=in-brief-2001-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1511/2009.76.50 |journal= American Scientist |year=2009 |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=50–57 |title= The Bones of Copernicus |author= Dennis Danielson  |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/the-bones-of-copernicus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cosmology, if one assumes the Copernican principle and observes that the universe appears [[isotropic]] from our vantage-point on Earth, then one can prove that the Universe is generally [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] (at any given time) and is also isotropic about any given point. These two conditions comprise the [[cosmological principle]]. 

In practice, astronomers observe that the Universe has heterogeneous structures up to the scale of [[galactic supercluster]]s, [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|great void]]s, but becomes more and more homogeneous and isotropic when observed on larger and larger scales, with little detectable structure on scales of more than about 200 million [[parsec]]s.  However, on scales comparable to the radius of the observable universe, we see systematic changes with distance from the Earth. For instance, galaxies contain more young stars and are less clustered, and [[quasars]] appear more numerous. While this might suggest that the Earth is at the center of the Universe, the Copernican principle requires us to interpret it as evidence for the evolution of the Universe with time: this distant light has taken most of the age of the Universe to reach and shows us the Universe when it was young. The most distant light of all, [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], is isotropic to at least one part in a thousand. 

Modern mathematical cosmology is based on the assumption that the Cosmological principle is almost, but not exactly, true on the largest scales. The Copernican principle represents the irreducible philosophical assumption needed to justify this, when combined with the observations.

Bondi and [[Thomas Gold]] used the Copernican principle to argue for the [[perfect cosmological principle]] which maintains that the universe is also homogeneous in time, and is the basis for the [[steady-state cosmology]]. However, this strongly conflicts with the evidence for cosmological evolution mentioned earlier:  the Universe has progressed from extremely different conditions at the [[Big Bang]], and will continue to progress toward extremely different conditions, particularly under the rising influence of [[dark energy]], apparently toward the [[Big Freeze]] or the [[Big Rip]].

== Confirmation ==
Measurements of the effects of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] in the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle on a [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] scale.&lt;ref&gt;Astronomers reported their measurement in a paper published in the December 2000 issue of [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] titled ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?astro-ph/0012222 The microwave background temperature at the redshift of 2.33771]'' ([http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0012222 available] on [[arxiv]]). A [http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2000/pr-27-00.html press release] from the [[European Southern Observatory]] explains the findings to the public.&lt;/ref&gt; The radiation that pervades the universe was demonstrably warmer at earlier times. Uniform cooling of the cosmic microwave background over billions of years is explainable only if [[Metric expansion of space|the universe is experiencing a metric expansion]].

== Ecliptic alignment of cosmic microwave background anisotropy ==

Results from [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) appear to run counter to Copernican expectations. The motion of the solar system, and the orientation of the plane of the [[ecliptic]] are aligned with features of the microwave sky, which on conventional thinking are caused by structure at the edge of the observable universe&lt;ref&gt;CERN Courier &quot;[http://www.cerncourier.com/main/article/44/10/4/1/CCEsky1_12-04 Does the motion of the solar system affect the microwave sky?]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = C. J. Copi, D. Huterer, D. J. Schwarz, G. D. Starkman | title = On the large-angle anomalies of the microwave sky | journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume = 367 | year = 2006 | pages = 79–102 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.09980.x | arxiv=astro-ph/0508047 | bibcode=2006MNRAS.367...79C}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Lawrence Krauss]] is quoted as follows in the referenced Edge.org article:&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/krauss06/krauss06.2_index.html The Energy of Space That Isn't Zero.]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|But when you look at [the cosmic microwave background] map, you also see that the structure that is observed, is in fact, in a weird way, correlated with the plane of the earth around the sun. Is this Copernicus coming back to haunt us? That's crazy. We're looking out at the whole universe. There's no way there should be a correlation of structure with our motion of the earth around the sun — the plane of the earth around the sun — the ecliptic. That would say we are truly the center of the universe.}}

It would be somewhat surprising if the WMAP alignments were a complete coincidence, but the anti-Copernican implications suggested by Krauss would be far more surprising, if true. Other possibilities are (i) that residual instrumental errors in  WMAP cause the effect (ii) that unexpected microwave emission from within the solar system is contaminating the maps.&lt;ref&gt;Copi et al. ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Family (biology)|family]] '''Cyprinidae''', from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''kyprînos'' (κυπρῖνος, &quot;carp&quot;), consists of the '''[[carp]]s''', the true '''[[minnow]]s''', and their relatives (for example, the '''[[barb (fish)|barb]]s''' and '''[[barbel (fish)|barbel]]s'''). Commonly called the '''carp family''' or the '''minnow family''', its members are also known as '''cyprinids'''. It is the largest family of fresh-water fish, with over 2,400 [[species]] in about 220 [[genus|genera]]. The family belongs to the order [[Cypriniformes]], of whose genera and species the cyprinids make up two-thirds.&lt;ref&gt;FishBase (2004), Nelson (2006), dictionary.com [2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the discovery that the relatively unknown [[mountain carp]]s are a peculiar lineage of cyprinids, they have been included tentatively as [[subfamily]] [[Psilorhynchinae]].&lt;ref name = heetal2008b&gt;He ''et al.'' (2008b)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:Giant Barb.jpg|thumb|left|[[Giant Barb]]s (''Catlocarpio siamensis'') are the largest members of this family]]
Cyprinids are stomachless fish and the jaws are toothless. Food can be effectively chewed by the gill rakers of the specialized last gill bow. These [[pharyngeal teeth]] allow the fish to make chewing motions against a chewing plate formed by a procession of the skull. The pharyngheal teeth are species specific and are used by specialists to determine the species. Strong pharyncheal teeth allow fish like the [[common carp]] and [[ide (fish)|ide]] to eat hard baits like snails and bivalves.

Hearing is a well-developed sense, since the cyprinds have the [[Weberian organ]], three specialized vertebra processions that transfer motion of the [[gas bladder]] to the inner ear. This construction is also used to observe motion of the gas bladder due to atmospheric conditions or depth changes. The cyprinids are [[physostome]]s because the pneumatic duct is retained in adult stages and the fish are able to gulp air to fill the gas bladder or they can dispose excess gas to the gut.

The fish in this family are native to [[North America]], [[Africa]], and [[Eurasia]]. The largest cyprinid in this family is the [[Giant Barb]] (''Catlocarpio siamensis''), which may grow up to {{convert|3|m|ft}}. The largest North American species is the [[Colorado Pikeminnow]] (''Ptychocheilus lucius''), of which individuals up to {{convert|6|ft|m}} long and weighing over {{convert|100|lb|kg}} have been recorded.

On the other hand, many species are smaller than {{convert|5|cm|in}}. As of 2008, the smallest known freshwater fish is a cypriniform, ''[[Danionella translucida]]'', reaching {{convert|12|mm|in}} at the longest.&lt;ref name = nelson2006&gt;Nelson (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; All fish in this family are egg-layers and most do not guard their eggs, however, there are a few species that build nests and/or guard the eggs. The [[bitterling-like cyprinid]]s (Acheilognathinae) are notable for depositing their eggs in [[bivalve]] molluscs, where the young grow up until able to fend for themselves.
[[Image:Carpe miroir de 17kg.jpg|thumb|left|Proud [[angling|angler]] with 17 kg [[Mirror Carp]] (''Cyprinus carpio'')]]

Most cyprinids feed mainly on invertebrates and vegetation probably due to the lack of teeth and stomach, but some species like the [[Asp (fish)|Asp]] specialize in fish. Many species [[ide (fish)|ide]], [[common rudd]] will eat small fish however when reaching a certain size. Even small species like the [[moderlieschen]] eat larvae of the [[common frog]] in artificial circumstances.

Some fishes, such as the [[grass carp]], are specialized in eating vegetation, some, such as the [[common nase]], eat algae from hard surfaces, some, such as the [[black carp]], specialize in snails, and some, such as the [[silver carp]], are specialized filter feeders. For this reason, they are often introduced as a management tool to control various factors in the aquatic environment, such as aquatic vegetation and diseases transmitted by snails.

==Relationship with humans==
&lt;!-- Please do not change; links exist to this title --&gt;
Cyprinids are highly important food fish; they are [[fishing|fished]] and [[fish farming|farmed]] across [[Eurasia]]. In [[land-locked]] countries in particular, cyprinids are often the major species of fish eaten because they make the largest part of [[biomass]] in most water types except for fast flowing rivers. In non-landlocked countries they are not very much appreciated due to the high number of bones. In Eastern Europe they are often prepared with traditional methods like drying and salting. The prevalence of inexpensive [[frozen food|frozen]] fish products made this less important now than it was in earlier times. Nonetheless, in certain places they remain popular for food as well as [[angling|recreational fishing]], and have been deliberately stocked in ponds and lakes for centuries for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;Magri MacMahon (1946): pp.149-152&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cyprinids are popular for angling especially for [[match fishing]] (due to their dominance in biomass and numbers) and fishing for [[common carp]] because of its size and strength.

Several cyprinids have been introduced to waters outside their natural range to provide food, sport, or biological control for some [[pest (organism)|pest]] species. The [[Common Carp]] (''Cyprinus carpio'') and the [[Grass Carp]] (''Ctenopharyngodon idella'') are the most important of these, for example in [[Florida]]. In some cases, these have become [[invasive species]] that compete with native fishes or disrupt the environment. Carp in particular can stir up [[sediment]], reducing the clarity of the water and making it difficult for plants to grow.&lt;ref&gt;GSMFC (2005), FFWCC [2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GoldfishPearl.jpg|thumb|right|One of the more unusual [[goldfish]] breeds: A variegated [[pearlscale]] with an [[oranda]]-type ''wen'' (&quot;cap&quot;).]]
Numerous cyprinids have become important in the [[fishkeeping|aquarium]] hobby, most famously the [[Goldfish]], which was bred in [[China]] from the [[Prussian Carp]] (''Carassius (auratus) gibelio''). First imported into [[Europe]] around 1728, it was much fancied by Chinese nobility as early as [[1150 AD]] and after it arrived there in 1502, also in [[Japan]]. In the latter country, from the 18th century onwards the Common Carp was bred into the ornamental variety known as [[koi]] &amp;ndash; or more accurately ''nishikigoi'' (錦鯉), as ''koi'' (鯉) simply means &quot;Common Carp&quot; in [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]]. 

Other popular aquarium cyprinids include [[danionin]]s, [[rasborinae|rasborines]] and [[Barbinae|true barbs]].&lt;ref&gt;Riehl &amp; Baensch (1996): p.410&lt;/ref&gt; Larger species are bred by the thousands in outdoor ponds, particularly in [[Southeast Asia]], and trade in these aquarium fishes is of considerable commercial importance. The small rasborines and danionines are perhaps only rivalled by [[characid]]s and [[Poeciliidae|poecilid livebearers]] in their popularity for [[Community aquarium|community aquaria]].

One particular species of these small and undemanding danionines is the [[Zebrafish]] (''Danio rerio''). It has become the standard [[model species]] for studying developmental genetics of [[vertebrate]]s, in particular fish.&lt;ref&gt;Helfman ''et al.'' (1997): p.228&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Habitat destruction]] and other causes have reduced the wild stocks of several cyprinids to dangerously low levels; some are already entirely [[extinct]]. In particular, [[Leuciscinae]] from southwestern [[North America]] have been hit hard by [[pollution]] and unsustainable water use in the early-mid 20th century; most globally extinct [[Cypriniformes]] species are in fact Leuciscinae from the southwestern [[United States]] and northern [[Mexico]].

==Systematics==
The massive diversity of cyprinids has so far made it difficult to resolve their [[phylogeny]] in sufficient detail to make assignment to [[subfamilies]] more than tentative in many cases. It is obvious that some distinct lineages exist &amp;ndash; for example, [[Cultrinae]] and [[Leuciscinae]], regardless of their exact delimitation, are rather close relatives and stand apart from [[Cyprininae]] &amp;ndash;, but the overall [[systematics]] and [[taxonomy]] of the Cyprinidae remain a subject of considerable debate. A large number of [[genera]] are ''[[incertae sedis]]'', too equivocal in their traits and/or too little-studied to permit assignment to a particular subfamily with any certainty.&lt;ref&gt;de Graaf ''et al.'' (2007), He ''et al.'' (2008a,b)&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the solution seems that the delicate [[rasborine]]s are the core group, consisting of minor lineages that have not shifted far from their [[ecological niche|evolutionary niche]], or have [[coevolution|co-evolved]], for millions of years. These are among the most [[basal (evolution)|basal]] lineages of living cyprinids. Other &quot;rasborines&quot; are apparently distributed across the diverse lineages of the family.&lt;ref name = heetal2008a&gt;He ''et al.'' (2008a)&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity and circumscription of proposed subfamilies like [[Labeoninae]] or [[Squaliobarbinae]] also remains doubtful, although the latter do appear to correspond to a distinct lineage. The sometimes-seen grouping of the [[large-headed carp]]s ([[Hypophthalmichthyinae]]) with ''[[Xenocypris]]'', on the other hand, seems quite in error. More likely, the latter are part of the [[Cultrinae]].&lt;ref name = heetal2008a /&gt;

[[Image:Labeo rohita.JPG|thumb|right|[[Rohu]] (''Labeo rohita'') of the disputed [[Labeoninae]])]]
The entirely [[paraphyletic]] &quot;Barbinae&quot; and the disputed Labeoninae might be better treated as part of the Cyprininae, forming a close-knit group whose internal relationships are still little known. The small [[Africa]]n &quot;[[barb (fish)|barb]]s&quot; do not belong in ''[[Barbus]]'' [[sensu stricto]] &amp;ndash; indeed, they are as distant from the typical [[barbel (fish)|barbel]]s and the [[typical carp]]s (''Cyprinus'') as these are from ''[[Garra]]'' (which is placed in the Labeoninae by most who accept the latter as distinct) and thus might form another as of yet unnamed subfamily. However, as noted above, how various minor lineages tie into this has not yet been resolved; therefore such a radical move, though reasonable, is probably premature.&lt;ref&gt;Howes (1991), de Graaf ''et al.'' (2007), IUCN (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tench]] (''Tinca tinca''), a significant food species farmed in western [[Eurasia]] in large numbers, is unusual. It is most often grouped with the Leuciscinae, but even when these were rather loosely circumscribed, it always stood apart. A [[cladistic]] analysis of [[DNA sequence]] data of the S7 [[ribosomal protein]] [[intron]] 1 supports the view that it is distinct enough to constitute a [[monotypic]] subfamily. It also suggests that it may be closer to the small [[East Asia]]n ''[[Aphyocypris]]'', ''[[Hemigrammocypris]]'', and ''[[Yaoshanicus]]''. They would have diverged roughly at the same time from cyprinids of east-central Asia, perhaps as a result of the [[Alpide orogeny]] that vastly changed the [[topography]] of that region in the late [[Paleogene]], when their divergence presumably occurred.&lt;ref name = heetal2008b /&gt;

Unlike most fish species, cyprinid fish generally increase in abundance in [[eutrophic]] lakes. Here, they contribute towards positive feedback as they are efficient at eating [[zooplankton]] which would otherwise graze on the algae, reducing its abundance.

In [[genetics]], '''complementary DNA''' ('''cDNA''') is [[DNA]] synthesized from a mature [[mRNA]] template in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme [[reverse transcriptase]] and the enzyme [[DNA polymerase]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; cDNA is often used to clone [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[gene]]s in [[prokaryote]]s.  When scientists want to express a specific [[protein]] in a cell that does not normally [[Gene expression|express]] that protein (i.e., [[heterologous]] expression), they will transfer the cDNA that codes for the protein to the recipient cell.  cDNA is also produced by [[retroviruses]] (such as [[HIV-1]], [[HIV-2]], [[Simian Immunodeficiency Virus]], etc.) which is integrated into its host to create a [[provirus]].

==Overview==
The [[central dogma of molecular biology]] outlines that in synthesizing proteins, [[DNA]] is [[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] into [[mRNA]], which is [[translation (genetics)|translated]] into protein. One difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes is that eukaryotic genes can contain [[intron]]s (intervening sequences) which are not coding sequences (in contrast with [[exon]]s which are coding sequences), and must be removed from the RNA primary transcript before it becomes mRNA and can be translated into protein. Prokaryotic genes have no introns, so their RNA is not subject to [[splicing (genetics)|splicing]].

Often it is desirable to express eukaryotic genes in prokaryotic cells. A simplified method of doing so would include the addition of eukaryotic DNA to a [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]], sometimes a prokaryotic host, which would then transcribe the DNA to mRNA and then translate it to protein. However, as eukaryotic DNA has introns, and since prokaryotes lack the machinery to splice them, the splicing of eukaryotic DNA must be done prior to adding the eukaryotic DNA into the host. This DNA, which was made as a complementary copy of the RNA and has no introns, is called complementary DNA (cDNA). To obtain [[gene expression|expression]] of the protein encoded by the eukaryotic cDNA, prokaryotic regulatory sequences would also be required (e.g. a [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]]).

==Synthesis==
Though there are several methods for doing so, cDNA is most often synthesized from mature (fully spliced) mRNA using the enzyme [[reverse transcriptase]]. This enzyme operates on a single strand of mRNA, generating its complementary DNA based on the pairing of RNA [[base pair]]s (A, U, G and C) to their DNA complements (T, A, C and G respectively).

To obtain eukaryotic cDNA whose introns have been removed:
# A eukaryotic cell transcribes the DNA (from genes) into RNA ([[pre-mRNA]]).
# The same cell [[Post-transcriptional modification|processes]] the pre-mRNA strands by removing introns, and adding a [[Polyadenylation|poly-A tail]] and [[5' cap|5’ Methyl-Guanine cap]].
# This mixture of mature mRNA strands is extracted from the cell. The Poly-A tail of the post transcription mRNA can be taken advantage of with oligo(dT) beads in an [[affinity chromatography]] assay.
# A poly-[[thymine|T]] [[oligonucleotide]] [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] is hybridized onto the [[Polyadenylation|poly-A tail]]  of the mature mRNA template, or random hexamer primers can be added which contain every possible 6 base single strand of DNA and can therefore hybridize anywhere on the RNA (Reverse transcriptase requires this double-stranded segment as a primer to start its operation.)
# Reverse transcriptase is added, along with deoxynucleoside triphosphates (A, T, G, C). This synthesizes one complementary strand of DNA hybridized to the original mRNA strand.
# To synthesize an additional DNA strand, you need to digest the RNA of the hybrid strand, using an enzyme like [[RNase A]].
# After digestion of the RNA, a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) is left and because single stranded nucleic acids are hydrophobic, it tends to loop around itself. It is likely that the ssDNA forms a [[hairpin loop]] at the 3' end.
# From the hairpin loop, a DNA polymerase can then use it as a primer to transcribe a complementary sequence for the ss cDNA.
# Now, you should be left with a double stranded cDNA with identical sequence as the mRNA of interest.

The reverse transcriptase scans the mature mRNA and synthesizes a sequence of DNA that complements the mRNA template. This strand of DNA is complementary DNA.

Note that the [[central dogma of molecular biology]] is not broken in this process.

==Applications==
Complementary DNA is often used in [[clone (genetics)|gene cloning]] or as [[gene probe]]s or in the creation of a [[cDNA library]]. When scientists transfer a gene from one cell into another cell in order to express the new genetic material as a protein in the recipient cell, the cDNA will be added to the recipient (rather than the entire gene), because the DNA for an entire gene may include DNA that does not code for the protein or that interrupts the coding sequence of the protein (e.g., [[intron]]s). Partial sequences of cDNAs are often obtained as [[expressed sequence tag]]s.

==Viruses==
Some viruses also use cDNA to turn their viral RNA into mRNA (viral RNA → cDNA → mRNA). The mRNA is used to make viral proteins to take over the host cell.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cellular Digital Packet Data''' ('''CDPD''') was a wide-area mobile data service which used unused [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] normally used by [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]] [[mobile phone]]s between 800 and 900&amp;nbsp;MHz to transfer data. Speeds up to 19.2 kbit/s were possible. The service was discontinued in conjunction with the retirement of the parent AMPS service; it has been functionally replaced by faster services such as [[1xRTT]], [[EV-DO]], and [[UMTS]]/[[HSPA]].

Developed in the early 1990s, CDPD was large on the horizon as a future technology. However, it had difficulty competing against existing slower but less expensive [[Mobitex]] and [[DataTac]] systems, and never quite gained widespread acceptance before newer, faster standards such as [[GPRS]] became dominant.

CDPD had very limited consumer offerings. [[AT&amp;T Wireless]] first offered the technology in the United States under the PocketNet brand. It was one of the first consumer offerings of wireless web service. A company named [[Omnisky]] provided service for Palm V devices. Cingular Wireless later offered CDPD under the Wireless Internet brand (not to be confused with Wireless Internet Express, their brand for GPRS/EDGE data). PocketNet was generally considered a failure with competition from 2G services such as Sprint's Wireless Web. After the four phones AT&amp;T Wireless had offered to the public (two from Panasonic, one from Mitsubishi and the Ericsson R289LX), AT&amp;T Wireless eventually refused to activate the devices.

Despite its limited success as a consumer offering, CDPD was adopted in a number of enterprise and government networks. It was particularly popular as a first-generation wireless data solution for [[telemetry]] devices (machine to machine communications) and for public safety mobile data terminals.

In 2004, major carriers in the [[United States]] announced plans to shut down CDPD service. In July 2005, the [[AT&amp;T Wireless]] and [[Cingular Wireless]] CDPD networks were shut down. Equipment for this service now has little to no residual value.

==CDPD Network==
Primary elements of a CDPD network are:
1. '''End systems''': physical &amp; logical end systems that exchange information
2. '''Intermediate systems''': CDPD infrastructure elements that store, forward &amp; route the information

There are 2 kinds of End systems
1. '''Mobile end system''': subscriber unit to access CDPD network over a wireless interface
2. '''Fixed end system''': common host/server that is connected to the CDPD backbone and providing access to specific application and data

There are 2 kinds of Intermediate systems
1. '''Generic intermediate system''': simple router with no knowledge of mobility issues
2. '''mobile data intermediate system''': specialized intermediate systemthat routes data based on its knowledge of the current location of Mobile end system. It is a set of hardware and software functions that provide switching, accounting, registration, authentication, encryption, and so on.

'''Creatures of statute''' (also known as '''creatures of the state''') are legal entities, such as [[corporation]]s, created by [[statute]]. Creatures of statute may include [[Municipality|municipalities]] and other artificial legal entities or relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quaqua.org/creature.htm Creature of the State -- Quaqua Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when a statute in some fashion requires the formation of a corporate body—often for governmental purposes—such bodies when formed are known as &quot;creatures of statute.&quot; The same concept is also expressed with the phrase &quot;creature of the state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quaqua.org/creature.htm Creature of the State -- Quaqua Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;creature of statute&quot; is most common to the [[United States]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], these bodies are simply called [[statutory corporation]]s (or statutory bodies) and generally have some governmental function. The [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] is an example. In a wider sense, most companies in the UK are created under statute since the [[Companies Act 1985]] specifies how a company may be created by a member of the public, but these companies are not called 'statutory corporations'. Often, in American legal and business documents that speak of governing bodies (''e.g.'', a board that governs small businesses in China) these bodies are described as &quot;creatures of statute&quot; to inform readers of their origins and format although the national governments that created them may not term them as creatures of statute. [[Australia]] also uses the term &quot;creature of statute&quot; to describe some governmental bodies.

The importance of a corporate body, regardless of its exact function, when such a body is a creature of statute is that its active functions can only be within the scope detailed by the statute which created that corporation. Thereby, the creature of statute is the tangible manifestation of the functions or work described by a given statute. The jurisdiction of a body that is a creature of statute is also therefore limited to the functional scope written into the laws that created that body. Unlike most (private) corporate bodies, creatures of statute cannot expand their business interests into other diverse areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''General Conference on Weights and Measures''' is the English name of the '''Conférence générale des poids et mesures''' ('''CGPM''', never GCWM). It is one of the three organizations established to maintain the [[International System of Units]] (SI) under the terms of the ''Convention du Mètre'' ([[Metre Convention]]) of 1875. It meets in [[Sèvres]] (in the southwestern suburbs of Paris) every four to six years.

{{nihongo|'''''Cowboy Bebop'''''|カウボーイビバップ|Kaubōi Bibappu}} is a critically acclaimed and award-winning 1998 Japanese [[anime]] [[Television program|series]] directed by [[Shinichirō Watanabe]], written by [[Keiko Nobumoto]], and produced by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]]. Its 26 episodes (&quot;sessions&quot;) comprise a complete storyline: set in 2071, the series follows the adventures, misadventures and [[Tragedy|tragedies]] of a group of [[bounty hunter]]s, or &quot;cowboys&quot;, traveling on their spaceship, the ''Bebop''. The series explores several concepts involving [[philosophy]], including [[existentialism]], [[loneliness]], and [[existential]] [[ennui]].

The series' art direction centers on [[American music]] and [[counterculture]], especially the [[Beat Generation|beat]] and [[jazz]] movements of the 1940s-60s and the early [[rock and roll|rock]] era of the 1950s-70s, which the original soundtrack by [[Yoko Kanno]] and [[The Seatbelts]] recreates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholas1&quot;&gt;&quot;Yoko Kanno's score is equally eclectic, evoking Charlie Parker, Charlie Musselwhite, Johnny Cash and U2.&quot; {{Cite web|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p90930_index.html|title='The Work Which Becomes a New Genre Itself': Textual Networks in the World of Cowboy Bebop |accessdate=2009-10-08|publisher=All Academic, Inc|date=June 16, 2006|author=Kyle Nicholas|work=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, Dresden International Congress Centre, Dresden, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cowboy Bebop'' was a commercial success both in Japan and international markets, notably in the [[United States]]. After this reception, [[Sony Pictures]] released a feature film, ''[[Cowboy Bebop: The Movie|Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]'' (2001), to theaters worldwide and followed up with an international DVD release. Two [[manga]] adaptations were serialized in [[Kadokawa Shoten]]'s ''[[Asuka Fantasy DX]]''.

==Plot==
{{Main|List of Cowboy Bebop episodes}}

===Setting===
In 2022, the explosion of an experimental hyperspace gateway severely damaged the [[Moon]] which resulted in a debris ring that highly threatened the life on [[Earth]] with meteor bombardments that eradicated a large portion of the population. As a result, many survivors abandoned the barely habitable Earth to colonize the [[inner planets]], the [[asteroid belt]] and the [[moons of Jupiter]].

The series is set in the year 2071, when the entire [[Solar System]] has been made accessible through reliable hyperspace gates. [[Mars]] has become the new central hub of human civilization, and inter-planetary [[crime syndicate]]s exert influence over the government and the ''Inter-Solar System Police'' (ISSP), limiting their effectiveness in dealing with crime. As a result, a [[bounty system]] similar to that in the [[Old West]] is established to deal with [[fugitive]]s, [[terrorist]]s, and other criminals. The series often refers to Bounty Hunters as cowboys.

===Story===
''Cowboy Bebop'' revolves around a crew of bounty hunters living in the spaceship named ''Bebop''. They are a team of bounty hunters who travel the Solar System trying to apprehend bounties. Jet Black is the owner of the ''Bebop'' who has partnered with Spike Spiegel for his diverse combat skills. During their travels, the ''Bebop'' ship gained new crew members Ein, Faye, and Edward. 

Throughout the series ''Bebop'' crew members' pasts catch up with them, and the series regularly turns to the history of the main characters in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s. Spike's past as a syndicate enforcer is a major element of the series, while other episodes deal with Jet's previous occupation as an ISSP officer on [[Ganymede]], and Faye's mysterious past and significant debt problems. The day-to-day life of the crew is also explored throughout the series.

==Characters==
{{Main|List of Cowboy Bebop characters}}
[[File:Cowboy-bebop-754433.jpg|thumb|left|250px|From left to right: Ein, Edward, Spike Spiegel, Jet Black and Faye Valentine]]

'''[[Spike Spiegel]]''' – a former member of the Red Dragon Crime Syndicate. Spike is a master in firearms and hand-to-hand combat, practicing [[Jeet Kune Do]], and is also a skilled pilot. He flies a sleek custom-designed Mono Racer, red-painted, atmosphere-capable spacecraft called Swordfish II. Despite his outwardly carefree attitude, he is haunted by the memory of his time in the syndicate, particularly of his romantic relationship with a mysterious woman named [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Julia|Julia]], and his conflict with arch-rival and former syndicate partner, [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Vicious|Vicious]]. He is also an accomplished pickpocket.

'''[[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Jet Black|Jet Black]]''' – a former ISSP officer and the owner of the ''Bebop''. Once called &quot;The Black Dog&quot; by his fellow officers for his relentless nature, he left the ISSP after becoming fed up with the corruption and red tape of the organization, and turned to bounty hunting as a way to pursue justice. Despite the ability to have it replaced, he voluntarily bears a [[cybernetic]] arm as a reminder of what happened when he rushed into trouble without looking first. He owns both their main ship, Bebop, and his own small yellow ship called Hammerhead. The Hammerhead has been equipped with a claw and harpoon that can be used as a tow cable. Like Spike, he too is haunted by the memory of a woman, Alisa, his longtime girlfriend who left him without giving a reason.

'''[[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Faye Valentine|Faye Valentine]]''' – a [[femme fatale]] with a persistent gambling addiction. She joins the ''Bebop'' uninvited, to the consternation of Jet and Spike. Though she abandons the ship several times during the course of the series, her attachment to the crew always brings her back. These feelings are apparently reciprocated, as Jet and Spike always allow her to return despite claiming they're pleased to see her leave. She pilots a generic heavy spacecraft called Red Tail which is pale blue despite the name and has been heavily modified with armament and tracking sensors. Her gambling, cheating, and competitive skills are unrivaled except by Spike. Much of her past and her real last name are a mystery, however it appears that she was severely injured in a space shuttle accident and was then put into cold sleep until she could be healed. She emerges from the cryo sleep without her memories, which she eventually recovers. She finds her old house which was a large mansion, but it had since burnt down.

'''[[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Edward|Edward]]''' - a young, eccentric computer genius and master [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]]. Ed is a girl, though her name and androgynous appearance suggest otherwise. She had followed the travels of the ''Bebop'' before encountering the ship, and agrees to help the crew track down a bounty-head in exchange for becoming a member of the crew.  Although extremely intelligent, Ed is still a young child, and looks up to the crew of the Bebop as members of her family. She gave herself the fanciful name &quot;Edward Wong Hau Pepulu Tivruskii 4th&quot; after running away to an orphanage, but after her father is found, it is revealed that her real name is Françoise Appledelhi. She goes by the name Radical Edward when hacking, and spends much of her time with Ein.

'''[[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Ein|Ein]]''' – a [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi]] and former lab animal identified as a &quot;data dog&quot; by the scientists who created him. The reason for this title is that the scientists used him for unspecified experiments, cyber-enhancing him to give him extraordinary data-sniffing and pattern-recognition abilities. It is suggested that he possesses enhanced intelligence, which he displays in subtle ways throughout the series, including showing the ability to speak to other animals, and possibly Ed, and perfectly hacking the 'Scratch' website in session #23. Despite his enhanced capabilities, the rest of the ''Bebop'' crew, with the exception of Ed, often fail to notice these qualities and treat Ein as an average pet.

'''[[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Vicious|Vicious]]''' – grim enforcer of the Red Dragon Crime Syndicate, a former friend of Spike's and now his sworn nemesis. Vicious sports an emaciated, embittered look, wields a [[katana]] for a weapon and is always accompanied by a strange, crow-like bird perched on his shoulder. He lives up to his name both through his violent actions and his two-timing scheming within the syndicate. With only five appearances throughout the entire show, Vicious is arguably the series' main antagonist, or at any rate the only recurring one.

==Production==
The balances of the atmospheres of the planets and the racial groups of the people in ''Cowboy Bebop'' mostly originate from Shinichiro Watanabe's ideas, while collaboration from set designer Isamu Imakake, Shoji Kawamori, and Dai Satou also formed the balances. The staff of ''Cowboy Bebop'' established the particular atmospheres early in the production. Initially in the production, the ethnic groups were not solidly established. Watanabe wanted to have many racial groups appear in ''Cowboy Bebop''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AnimeGuide4p64&quot;&gt;''Cowboy Bebop Anime Guide Volume 4''. [[Tokyopop]]. April 2002. 64. ISBN 1-931514-08-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mars was the planet most often used in storylines in ''Cowboy Bebop''. Satoshi Toba, the cultural and setting producer, explained that other planets &quot;were unexpectedly difficult to use.&quot; Toba explained that each planet in ''Cowboy Bebop'' has unique features, and in the plotlines the producers had to take into account the characteristics of each planet. Toba explained that it was not possible for the staff of ''Cowboy Bebop'' to have a dramatic rooftop scene occur on [[Venus]], so &quot;we ended up normally falling back to Mars.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AnimeGuide4p64&quot;/&gt;

===Distribution===
In the [[United States]], on September 2, 2001, ''Cowboy Bebop'' became the first anime title to be shown as part of the U.S. [[Cartoon Network (United States)|Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] programming block.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/cowboy-bebop/200706 Cowboy Bebop on Cartoon Network - Cowboy Bebop Spoilers, Episode Guides, Message Board | TVGuide.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was successful enough to be broadcast repeatedly for four years. It was rerun again in 2007, 2008, the first part of 2009 and 2010. It is currently being shown on [[Adult Swim Video]] and on Adult Swim on Saturday nights. In the [[United Kingdom]], ''Cowboy Bebop'' was first broadcast in 2002 as one of the highlights of the ill-fated &quot;cartoon network for adults&quot;, [[CNX]]. From November 6, 2007, it was being repeated on [[AnimeCentral]] until the channel's closure in August 2008. In [[Australia]], ''Cowboy Bebop'' was first broadcast on pay-TV in 2002 on [[Cartoon Network (Australia)|Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]]. It has recently started broadcasting on the [[Sci Fi Channel (Australia)|Sci Fi Channel]] on [[Foxtel]]. In [[Australia]], ''Cowboy Bebop'' TV series was first broadcast on free-to-air-TV on [[ABC2]] (the national digital public television channel) on January 2, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/abc2/200701/programs/ZY8644A001D2012007T223000.htm Cowboy Bebop: Asteroid Blues]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been repeated several times, most recently starting from Monday, December 29, 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/abc2/200812/programs/ZY8644A001D29122008T232000.htm  Cowboy Bebop: Asteroid Blues]&lt;/ref&gt; and finishing on Monday, June 22, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/abc2/200906/programs/ZY8644A026D22062009T233000.htm  Cowboy Bebop: The Real Folk Blues part 2]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cowboy Bebop: The Movie'' also aired again on February 23, 2009, on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] (a hybrid-funded Australian public broadcasting television network). In [[Canada]], ''Cowboy Bebop'' was first broadcast on December 24, 2006, on [[Razer]].

==Reception==
{{Ref improve section|date=September 2007}}

===Japan===
''Cowboy Bebop'' almost did not appear on [[Japan]]ese broadcast television due to its depictions of graphic violence. It was first sent to [[TV Tokyo]], one of the main broadcasters of anime in Japan. The show had an aborted first run from April 3, 1998, until June 19, 1998, on TV Tokyo, broadcasting only [[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes#Session 2.2C Stray Dog Strut|episodes 2]], [[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes#Session 3.2C Honky Tonk Women|3]], [[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes#Session 7.2C Heavy Metal Queen|7]] to [[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes#Session 15.2C My Funny Valentine|15]], and [[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes#Session 18.2C Speak Like a Child|18]].

Later that year, the series was shown in its entirety from October 23 until April 23, 1999, on the satellite network [[WOWOW]]. Because of the TV Tokyo broadcast slot fiasco, the production schedule was disrupted to the extent that the last episode was delivered to WOWOW on the day of its broadcast. ''Cowboy Bebop'' won the [[Seiun Award#Best Media of the Year|Seiun Award]] in 2000.

The full series has also been broadcast across Japan by the anime television network [[Animax]], which has also aired the series via its respective networks across [[Southeast Asia]], [[South Asia]] and [[East Asia]]. ''Cowboy Bebop'' was popular enough that the movie, ''[[Cowboy Bebop: The Movie|Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira]]'' (''Knockin' on Heaven's Door''), was commissioned and released in Japan in 2001, and later released in the United States as ''Cowboy Bebop: The Movie'' in 2003.

==Legacy==
A 2004 poll in ''Newtype USA'', the US edition of the Japanese magazine ''[[Newtype (magazine)|Newtype]]'', asked its readers to rank the &quot;Top 25 Anime Titles of All Time&quot;; ''Cowboy Bebop'' placed second on a list that included such anime as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;animenewsnetwork1&quot;&gt;''[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/pressrelease.php?id=632 Newtype Press Release]'' - ''[[Anime News Network]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anime News Network (October 13, 2006). Retrieved on September 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The American Anime magazine ''[[Anime Insider]]'' (No. 50, November 2007) ranked the 50 Best Anime by compiling lists of industry regulars and magazine staff, with ''Cowboy Bebop'' ranked as #1 of all time. In 2009, IGN published a list of the &quot;Top 100 Animated Series&quot;, on which ''Cowboy Bebop'' placed 14th, making it the second highest ranking anime on the list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/14.html IGN - 14. ''Cowboy Bebop'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., [[Cartoon Network (United States)|Cartoon Network]] has regularly rotated ''Cowboy Bebop'' in and out of its [[Adult Swim]] block line-up. [[Adult Swim]] occasionally refers to Cowboy Bebop as &quot;The greatest series we have ever aired.&quot;

''T.H.E.M'' Anime Reviews said the series has &quot;sophistication and subtlety that is practically one-of-a-kind&quot;, touting it as a masterpiece that &quot;puts most anime...and Hollywood, to shame.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=413 THEM Anime reviews - ''Cowboy Bebop'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 2006 IGN published an article by Josh Pool entitled &quot;Top Ten Anime Themes and Soundtracks of All-Time.&quot; Cowboy Bebop was listed as number one, &quot;And the winner is Bebop! Yoko Kanno strikes again. From beginning to end this may be one of the best anime ever and certainly is tops when it comes to music.&quot;

In March 2009, the print and web editions of ''[[The Onion]]'''s [[A.V. Club]] called ''Cowboy Bebop'' &quot;rightly a huge hit&quot;, and listed it as a gateway series to understanding the medium of anime as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub-2009&quot;/&gt;

''Cowboy Bebop'' has been released in three separate editions in North America.

The first release was sold in 2000 individually, and featured uncut versions of the original 26 episodes. In 2001, these DVDs were collected in the special edition ''Perfect Sessions'' which included the first 6 DVDs, the first ''Cowboy Bebop'' soundtrack, and a collector's box. At the time of release, the art box from the Perfect Sessions was made available for purchase on The Right Stuff International as a solo item for collectors who already owned the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cowboy Bebop box set &quot;box&quot; available separately |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2001-11-07/cowboy-bebop-box-set-box-available-separately |publisher= [[Anime News Network]] |date=2001-11-07 |accessdate= 2009-04-28}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second release, ''The Best Sessions'', was sold in 2002 and featured what Bandai considered to be the best 6 episodes of the series remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS surround sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Otakon 2002: Bandai Panel |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-07-29/otakon-2002-bandai-panel |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2002-07-29 |accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third release, ''Cowboy Bebop Remix'', was also distributed on 6 discs and included the original 26 episodes, with sound remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 and video remastered under the supervision of Shinichiro Watanabe.

==Music==
{{Main|Music of Cowboy Bebop}}
One of the most notable elements of ''Cowboy Bebop'' is its music. Episodes are called &quot;sessions&quot;, each of which follows a different musical theme,&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub-2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |last=Robinson |first=Tasha |title=Gateways To Geekery: Anime |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/gateways-to-geekery-anime,24653/ |work= A.V.

Performed by [[Yoko Kanno]] and [[The Seatbelts]], a band Kanno assembled to perform music for the series, the jazz and blues themed soundtrack helps to define the show as much as the characters, writing, and animation. ''Cowboy Bebop'' was voted by [[IGN]] in 2006 as having the greatest soundtrack for an [[anime]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://music.ign.com/articles/708/708910p1.html IGN: Top Ten Anime Themes and Soundtracks of All-Time], IGN.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live-action film==
On July 22, 2008, ''IF Magazine'' published an article on its website regarding a rumor of a live-action ''Cowboy Bebop'' movie in development by [[20th Century Fox]]. Producer [[Erwin Stoff]] said that the film's development was in the early stages, and that they had &quot;just signed it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifmagazine.com/new.asp?article=6571 IF Magazine: Live-Action 'Cowboy Bebop' Movie Is In The Works], IF Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/07/22/fox-developing-cowboy-bebop-live-action-feature-film/ FirstShowing.Net], Cowboy Bebop Movie&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keanu Reeves]] has been confirmed as playing the role of [[Spike Spiegel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-12-17/keanu-reeves-hopes-to-star-in-live-action-cowboy-bebop |title=Keanu Reeves Hopes to Star in Live-Action Cowboy Bebop |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2008-12-17 |accessdate=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2009/01/16/keanu-reeves-to-play-spike-spiegel-in-live-action-cowboy-bebop-movie/|title=Keanu Reeves To Play Spike Spiegel In Live-Action 'Cowboy Bebop' Movie}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' confirmed on January 15, 2009, that the production company [[Sunrise Animation]] will be &quot;closely involved with the development of the English language project.&quot; The site also confirmed Kenji Uchida, Shinichiro Watanabe, and series writer Keiko Nobumoto as associate producers, series producer Masahiko Minami as a production consultant, and [[Peter Craig]] as screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117998641.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;query=Cowboy+Bebop|title=Keanu Reeves set for 'Bebop' Actor to star in live-action adaptation of anime|publisher=Variety|date=2009-01-15|accessdate=2009-01-21 | first=Tatiana | last=Siegel}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally slated for release in 2011, but problems with the budget have delayed its production.

==Continuation rumors==
After the creation of the series, an interviewer asked Watanabe if he had any plans to create more ''Cowboy Bebop'' material. Watanabe responded by saying that he does not believe that he &quot;should just keep on making ''Cowboy Bebop'' sequels for the sake of it.&quot; Watanabe added that ending production and &quot;to quit while we're ahead when people still want more&quot; is more &quot;in keeping with the ''Bebop'' spirit&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WatanabeInterviewCBMovie&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20030307023145/www.cowboybebop.org/english/door/interview/index.html The Director's Voice Shinichiro Watanabe Interview].&quot; ''CowboyBebop.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent interview from 2006 with ''The Daily Texan'' Watanabe was asked if there would ever be more ''Cowboy Bebop''.

'''Titus Flavius Clemens''' (c.150 - c. 215), known as '''Clement of Alexandria''' (to distinguish him from [[Clement of Rome]]), was a [[Christian theologian]] and the head of the noted [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]]. Clement is best remembered as the teacher of [[Origen]].  He united Greek philosophical traditions with Christian doctrine and valued ''[[gnosis]]'' that with [[catholic|communion for all people]] could be held by common Christians specially chosen by God.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} vide, e.g., Stromata, VI.106.4f. Though he constantly opposes the concept of gnosis as defined by the Gnostics, he used the term &quot;gnostic&quot; for Christians who had attained the deeper teaching of the Logos.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;&gt;&quot;Clement of Alexandria.&quot; Cross, F.

New York: Simon and Schuster. 1972&lt;/ref&gt; He presented the goal of Christian life as deification, identified both as Platonism's assimilation into God and the biblical imitation of God.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt;

Like Origen, he arose from Alexandria's Catechetical School and was well versed in pagan literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;/&gt; Origen succeeded Clement as head of the school.&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;/&gt; Alexandria had a major Christian community in early Christianity, noted for its scholarship and its high-quality copies of Scripture.

Clement is counted as one of the early [[Church Fathers]]. He advocated a [[vegetarian]] diet and claimed that the apostles [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]], and [[James the Just]] were vegetarians.&lt;ref name=IVU&gt;[http://www.ivu.org/history/christian/clement.html ivu.org, citing &amp; linking to ''The Ante-Nicene Fathers'' edited by A.

Many indeed are called James. This one was holy from his mother's womb. He drank neither wine nor strong drink, ate no flesh, never shaved or anointed himself with ointment or bathed. To him alone it was permitted to enter the holy place; for he wore nothing woollen, but linen garments.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Because Early Alexandrian Church fathers wrote their works in Greek, later scholars proposed they were not all Egyptians. Clement's birthplace is not known with certainty. Other than being Egyptian, [[Athens]] is proposed as his birthplace by the 6th-century [[Epiphanius Scholasticus]], supported by the classical quality of his Greek. His parents seem to have been wealthy [[paganism|pagans]] of some social standing. The thoroughness of his education is shown by his constant quotation of the [[Greek literature|Greek]] poets and philosophers. He travelled in [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Palestine]], and finally [[Egypt]]. He became the colleague of [[Pantaenus]], the head of the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]], and finally succeeded him in the direction of the school. One of his most popular pupils was [[Origen]]. During the persecution of Christians by [[Septimius Severus]] (202 or 203) he sought refuge with Alexander, then bishop (possibly of Flaviada) in [[Cappadocia]], afterward of [[Jerusalem]], from whom he brought a letter to [[Antioch]] in 211.

==Literary work==
===Great trilogy===

{{Clement}}
The trilogy into which Clement's principal remains are connected by their purpose and mode of treatment is composed of:
*the ''[[Protrepticus]]'' (&quot;Exhortation to the Greeks&quot;)
*the ''[[Paedagogus]]'' (&quot;Instructor&quot;)
*the ''[[Stromata]]'' (&quot;Miscellanies&quot;)

Overbeck{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}calls it the boldest literary undertaking in the history of the Church, since in it Clement for the first time attempted to set forth Christianity for the faithful in the traditional forms of secular literature.

The first book deals with the religious basis of Christian morality, the second and third with the individual cases of conduct. As with [[Epictetus]], true virtue shows itself with him in its external evidences by a natural, simple, and moderate way of living.

Clement wrote of ''[[apocatastasis]]'', the restoration of all things, in his ''Stromata''. He wrote that the punishments of God are &quot;saving and disciplinary, leading to conversion.&quot; This was incorrectly identified as [[universal reconciliation]] by the Universalist historian [[George T. Knight (Universalist)|George T. Knight]] (1914).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc01.html?term=Apocatastasis Apocatastasis]&quot;. ''New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol. I''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
Besides the great trilogy, the only complete work preserved is the treatise &quot;Who is the Rich Man that Shall Be Saved?&quot; based on [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Mark|10:17-31|31}}, and laying down the principle that not the possession of riches but their misuse is to be condemned. There are extant a few fragments of the treatise on the [[Passover]], against the [[Quartodecimanism]] position of [[Melito of Sardis]], and only a single passage from the &quot;Ecclesiastical Canon&quot; against the Judaizers. Several other works are known only by their titles. His work ''Hypotyposes'' survives only in fragments.

Much of Clement's work has been published in recent years in the collection ''[[Sources Chrétiennes]]'', in particular by [[Alain Le Boulluec]].

Clement's &quot;Shepherd of Tender Youth&quot; may be the earliest Christian [[hymn]] with a named author.&lt;ref name=&quot;CyberHymnal&quot;&gt;[http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/s/h/shepherd.htm CyberHymnal]&lt;/ref&gt;

==His significance for the Church==
{{Original research|date=September 2007}}
Down to the 17th century Clement was venerated as a saint. His name was to be found in the [[martyrologies]], and his feast fell on December 4. But when the ''[[Roman Martyrology]]'' was revised by [[Pope Clement VIII|Clement VIII]] (Pope from 1592 to 1605), his name was dropped from the calendar on the advice of his confessor, [[Cardinal Baronius]]. [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1748 maintained his predecessor's decision on the grounds that Clement's life was little-known; that he had never obtained public [[cultus]] in the Church; and that some of his doctrines were, if not erroneous, at least suspect.

The significance of Clement in the history of the development of doctrine is, according to [[Adolf von Harnack]], that he knew how to replace the apologetic method by the constructive or systematic, to turn the simple church tradition into a &quot;scientific&quot; [[dogma]]tic theology. It is a marked characteristic of his that he sees only superficial and transient disagreement where others find a fundamental opposition. He is able to reconcile, or even to fuse, differing views to an extent which makes it almost impossible to attribute to him a definite individual system. He is admittedly an eclectic (''Stromata'', i. 37). This attitude determines especially his treatment of non-Christian philosophy. Although the theory of a diabolical origin for it is not unknown to him, and although he shows exhaustively that the philosophers owe a large part of their knowledge to the writings of the [[Old Testament]], yet he seems to express his own personal conviction when he describes philosophy as a direct operation of the divine Logos, working through it as well as through the law and his direct revelation in the Gospel to communicate the truth to men.

Thus he emphasizes the permanent importance of philosophy for the fullness of Christian knowledge, explains with special predilection the relation between knowledge and faith, and sharply criticizes those who are unwilling to make any use of philosophy. He pronounces definitely against the sophists and against the hedonism of the school of [[Epicurus]]. Although he generally expresses himself unfavorably in regard to the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]], he really pays marked deference to that mixture of Stoicism and [[Neo-Platonism|Platonism]] which characterized the religious and ethical thought of the educated classes in his day. This explains the value set by Clement on ''[[gnosis]]''. Faith is the foundation of all ''gnosis'', and both are given by [[Christ]]. As faith involves a comprehensive knowledge of the essentials, knowledge allows the believer to penetrate deeply into the understanding of what he believes; and this is the making perfect, the completion, of faith. In order to attain this kind of faith, the &quot;faith of knowledge,&quot; which is so much higher than the mere &quot;faith of conjecture,&quot; or simple reception of a truth on authority, philosophy is permanently necessary. In fact, Christianity is the true philosophy, and the perfect Christian the true Gnostic—but again only the &quot;Gnostic according to the canon of the Church &quot; has this distinction. Also, he rejects the Gnostic distinction of &quot;psychic&quot; and &quot;pneumatic&quot; men; all are alike destined to perfection if they will embrace it.

From philosophy he takes his conception of the Logos, the principle of Christian gnosis, through whom alone God's relation to the world and his revelation is maintained. God he considers transcendentally as unqualified Being, who can not be defined in too abstract a way. Though his goodness operated in the creation of the world, yet immutability, self sufficiency, incapability of suffering are the characteristic notes of the divine essence. Though the Logos is most closely one with the Father, whose powers he resumes in himself, yet to Clement both the Son and the Spirit are &quot;first-born powers and first created&quot;; they form the highest stages in the scale of intelligent being, and Clement distinguishes the Son-Logos from the Logos who is immutably immanent in God, and thus gives a foundation to the charge of Photius that he &quot;degraded the Son to the rank of a creature.&quot; Separate from the world as the principle of creation, he is yet in it as its guiding principle. Thus a natural life is a life according to the will of the Logos. The Incarnation, in spite of Clement's rejection of the Gnostic [[Docetism]], has with him a decidedly Docetic character. The body of Christ was not subject to human needs. He is the good Physician; the medicine which he offers is the communication of saving ''gnosis'', leading men from paganism to faith and from faith to the higher state of knowledge. This true philosophy includes within itself the freedom from sin and the attainment of virtue. As all sin has its root in ignorance, so the knowledge of God and of goodness is followed by well-doing. Against the Gnostics Clement emphasizes the freedom of all to do good.

Clement lays great stress on the fulfilment of moral obligations. In his ethical expressions he is influenced strongly by Plato and the Stoics, from whom he borrows much of his terminology. He praises [[Plato]] for setting forth the greatest possible likeness to God as the aim of life; and his portrait of the perfect Gnostic closely resembles that of the wise man as drawn by the Stoics. Hence he counsels his readers to shake off the chains of the flesh as far as possible, to live already as if out of the body, and thus to rise above earthly things. He is a true Greek in the value which he sets on moderation; but his highest ideal of conduct remains the mortification of all affections which may in any way disturb the soul in its career. As Harnack says, the lofty ethical-religious ideal of the attainment of man's perfection in union with God, which Greek philosophy from Plato down had worked out, and to which it had subordinated all scientific worldly knowledge, is taken over by Clement, deepened in meaning, and connected not only with Christ, but with ecclesiastical tradition.

The way, however, to this union with God is for Clement only the Church's way. The communication of the gnosis is bound up with holy orders, which give the divine light and life. The simple faith of the baptized Christian contains all the essentials of the highest knowledge; by the Eucharist the believer is united with the Logos and the Spirit, and made partaker of incorruptibility. Though he lays down at starting a purely spiritual conception of the Church, later the exigencies of his controversy with the Gnostics make him lay more stress on the visible church. As to his use of Scripture, the extraordinary breadth of his reading and manifold variety of his quotations from the most diverse authors make it very difficult to determine exactly what was received as canonical by the Alexandrian Church of that period. Clement uses both canonical and apocryphal Gospels, and often talks just about &quot;the Gospel&quot; without specifying any of them. For the other [[New Testament]] writings he seems not to have had as definite a line of demarcation; but whatever he recognized as of apostolic origin had for him an authority distinct from, and higher than, that of all other ecclesiastical tradition.

An excerpt from the ''[[Mar Saba letter]]'', attributed to Clement of Alexandria, is the only evidence for the existence of a possible ''[[Secret Gospel of Mark]]''.

Clement quoted from the ''Teaching of the Twelve Apostles'' as scripture,&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;/&gt; a book currently known as the [[Didache]].

==Patron Saint==
The [[Universal Catholic Church]], a member of the [[Liberal Catholic Church|Liberal Catholic]] family of Churches, has selected Clement as its Patron Saint.

{{Descartes}}
'''''{{lang|la|Cogito ergo sum}}''''' ([[French language|French]]: '''''Je pense donc je suis'''''; [[English language|English]]: '''''I think, therefore  I am''''') is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[Latin]] statement proposed by {{lang|fr|[[René Descartes]]}}. The simple meaning of the phrase is that someone wondering whether or not he exists is, in and of itself, proof that he does exist (because, at the very least, there is an &quot;I&quot; who does the thinking).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = | coauthors = Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The phrase became a fundamental element of [[Western philosophy]].  It forms a sort of bedrock for all knowledge, because, while all things can be questioned as to whether they are from the realm of reality or from some figment of imagination (a dream, influence of a demon, etc.), the very act of doubting one's own existence serves as proof of the reality of one's own existence.

The statement is sometimes given as '''''{{lang|la|Dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum}}''''' (English: &quot;I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;It appears in an anonymous introduction, from 1765, signed by &quot;Thomas,&quot; which was included in the Descartes edition by [[Victor Cousin]] and is accessible, together with Descartes' works at the Gutenberg Project.[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13846/13846-h/13846-h.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; although this extension was never used by Descartes himself and it is potentially misleading, as it suggests that Descartes' argument is based on doubt, whereas it is inherent in any mental activity whatsoever.

A common mistake is that people take the statement as proof that they, as a human person, exist. However, it is a severely limited conclusion that does nothing to prove that one's own body exists, let alone anything else that is perceived in the physical universe. It only proves that one's mind exists (that part of an individual that observes oneself doing the doubting). It does not rule out other possibilities, such as waking up to find oneself to be a [[Zhuangzi#The_butterfly_dream|butterfly who had dreamed]] of having lived a human life.
&lt;!--The following suspect claim is uncited, and for now invisible to readers:
Another common mistake is that Descartes is credited with the Cogito ergo Sum, when in fact the original idea was proposed by Socrates in the Great Dialogues of Plato, in the Meno, a slave boy without any knowledge is asked to think for himself about matters he does not know, Socrates goes on to show the slave boy starts thinking, that is the origin of the Cogito ergo Sum. Descartes used this idea to guide himself in most of his lectures and writings.
--&gt;
Descartes's original statement was {{lang|fr|&quot;Je pense donc je suis,&quot;}} from his ''[[Discourse on Method]]'' (1637). He wrote it in [[French language|French]], not in Latin and thereby reached a wider audience in his country than that of scholars.  He uses the Latin &quot;Cogito ergo sum&quot; in the later ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644), Part 1, article 7: &quot;{{lang|la|Ac proinde hæc cognitio, ''ego cogito, ergo sum'', est omnium prima &amp; certissima, quæ cuilibet ordine philosophanti occurrat.}}&quot; ([[English language|English]]: &quot;This proposition, ''I think, therefore I am'', is the first and the most certain which presents itself to whomever conducts his thoughts in order.&quot;). At that time, the argument had become popularly known in the English speaking world as 'the &quot;{{lang|la|Cogito Ergo Sum}}&quot; argument,' which is usually shortened to &quot;{{lang|la|'''''Cogito'''''}}&quot; when referring to the principle virtually everywhere else.

==Introduction==
The phrase ''Cogito ergo sum'' is not used in Descartes' ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' but the term &quot;the ''cogito''&quot; is (often confusingly) used to refer to an argument from it.  In the Meditations, Descartes phrases the conclusion of the argument as &quot;that the proposition, ''I am, I exist,'' is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind.&quot; (''Meditation'' II.)

At the beginning of the second meditation, having reached what he considers to be the ultimate level of doubt &amp;mdash; his argument from the existence of a deceiving god &amp;mdash; Descartes examines his beliefs to see if any have survived the doubt. In his belief in his own existence, he finds that it is impossible to doubt that he exists.  Even if there were a deceiving god (or an evil demon), one's belief in their own existence would be secure, for how could one be deceived unless one existed in order to be deceived?

&lt;blockquote&gt;But I have convinced myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies.  Does it now follow that I, too, do not exist? No. If I convinced myself of something [or thought anything at all], then I certainly existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who deliberately and constantly deceives me.  In that case, I, too, undoubtedly exist, if he deceives me; and let him deceive me as much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing, so long as I think that I am something.  So, after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that the proposition, ''I am, I exist,'' is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind. (AT VII 25; CSM II 16&amp;ndash;17)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are three important notes to keep in mind here. First, he claims only the certainty of ''his own'' existence from the first-person point of view &amp;mdash; he has not proved the existence of other minds at this point. This is something that has to be thought through by each of us for ourselves, as we follow the course of the meditations. Second, he does not say that his existence is necessary; he says that ''if he thinks'', then necessarily he exists (see the [[instantiation principle]]). Third, this proposition &quot;I am, I exist&quot; is held true not based on a deduction (as mentioned above) or on empirical induction but on the clarity and self-evidence of the proposition.

Descartes does not use this first certainty, the ''cogito'', as a foundation upon which to build further knowledge; rather, it is the firm ground upon which he can stand as he works to restore his beliefs.  As he puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Archimedes used to demand just one firm and immovable point in order to shift the entire earth; so I too can hope for great things if I manage to find just one thing, however slight, that is certain and unshakable. (AT VII 24; CSM II 16)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to many of Descartes' specialists, including [[Étienne Gilson]], the goal of Descartes in establishing this first truth is to demonstrate the capacity of his criterion &amp;mdash; the immediate clarity and distinctiveness of self-evident propositions &amp;mdash; to establish true and justified propositions despite having adopted a method of generalized doubt. As a consequence of this demonstration, Descartes considers science and mathematics to be justified to the extent that their proposals are established on a similarly immediate clarity, distinctiveness, and self-evidence that presents itself to the mind. The originality of Descartes' thinking, therefore, is not so much in expressing the cogito &amp;mdash; a feat accomplished by other predecessors, as we shall see &amp;mdash; but on using the cogito as demonstrating the most fundamental epistemological principle, that science and mathematics are justified by relying on clarity, distinctiveness, and self-evidence.

== Predecessors ==
Although the idea expressed in ''Cogito ergo sum'' is widely attributed to Descartes, he was not the first to mention it. [[Plato]] spoke about the &quot;knowledge of knowledge&quot; (Greek ''νόησις νοήσεως'' - ''nóesis noéseos'') and [[Aristotle]] explains the idea in full length:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But if life itself is good and pleasant (...) and if one who sees is conscious that he sees, one who hears that he hears, one who walks that he walks and similarly for all the other human activities there is a faculty that is conscious of their exercise, so that whenever we perceive, we are conscious that we perceive, and whenever we think, we are conscious that we think, and to be conscious that we are perceiving or thinking is to be conscious that we exist... (''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', 1170a25 ff.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] in ''[[City of God (book)|De Civitate Dei]]'' writes ''Si […] fallor, sum'' (&quot;If I am mistaken, I am&quot;) (book XI, 26), and also anticipates modern refutations of the concept.  Furthermore, in the ''[[Handbook on Faith, Hope, and Love (book)|Enchiridion]]'' Augustine attempts to refute [[skepticism]] by stating, &quot;[B]y not positively affirming that they are alive, the skeptics ward off the appearance of error in themselves, yet they do make errors simply by showing themselves alive; one cannot err who is not alive. That we live is therefore not only true, but it is altogether certain as well&quot; (Chapter 7 section 20). Another predecessor was [[Avicenna]]'s &quot;Floating Man&quot; [[thought experiment]] on human [[self-awareness]] and [[self-consciousness]].&lt;ref name=Leaman&gt;Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] and [[Oliver Leaman]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 315, [[Routledge]], ISBN 0415131596.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Descartes was original in expanding the idea as a defense against skepticism and using it as a foundation of his whole metaphysics.

== Criticism ==
There have been a number of criticisms of the argument. One concerns the nature of the step from &quot;I am thinking&quot; to &quot;I exist.&quot; The contention is that this is a [[syllogism|syllogistic]] inference, for it appears to require the extra [[premise]]: &quot;Whatever has the property of thinking, exists&quot;, a premise Descartes did not justify. In fact, he conceded that there would indeed be an extra premise needed, but denied that ''the cogito'' is a syllogism (see below).

To argue that ''the cogito'' is not a syllogism, one may call it self-evident that &quot;Whatever has the property of thinking, exists&quot;.  In plain English, it seems incoherent to actually doubt that one exists and is doubting. Strict skeptics maintain that only the property of 'thinking' is indubitably a property of the meditator (presumably, they imagine it possible that a thing thinks but does not exist). This counter-criticism is similar to the ideas of
[[Jaakko Hintikka]], who offers a non-syllogistic interpretation of Cogito Ergo Sum. He claimed that one simply cannot doubt the proposition &quot;I exist&quot;. To be mistaken about the proposition would mean something impossible: I do not exist, but I am still wrong. 

Perhaps a more relevant contention is whether the &quot;I&quot; to which Descartes refers is justified.
In ''Descartes, The Project of Pure Enquiry'', [[Bernard Williams]] provides a history and full evaluation of this issue. Apparently, the first scholar who raised the problem was [[Pierre Gassendi]]. He ''points out that recognition that one has a set of thoughts does not imply that one is a particular thinker or another. Were we to move from the observation that there is thinking occurring to the attribution of this thinking to a particular agent, we would simply assume what we set out to prove, namely, that there exists a particular person endowed with the capacity for thought ''. In other words, ''the only claim that is indubitable here is the agent-independent claim that there is cognitive activity present''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy|title=Pierre Gassendi|author=Saul Fisher|accessdate= 2010-11-02}} from [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; The objection, as presented by [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg|Georg Lichtenberg]], is that rather than supposing an entity that is thinking, Descartes should have said: &quot;thinking is occurring.&quot; That is, whatever the force of the ''cogito'', Descartes draws too much from it; the existence of a thinking thing, the reference of the &quot;I,&quot; is more than the ''cogito'' can justify. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] criticized the phrase in that it presupposes that there is an &quot;I&quot;, that there is such an activity as &quot;thinking&quot;, and that &quot;I&quot; know what &quot;thinking&quot; is. He suggested a more appropriate phrase would be &quot;it thinks.&quot; In other words the &quot;I&quot; in &quot;I think&quot; could be similar to the &quot;It&quot; in &quot;It is raining.&quot; [[David Hume]] is another philosopher who criticizes Descartes 'Cogito Ergo Sum'. He says that those philosophers who argue that we can work out we have a 'self' using reason are confusing 'similarity' with 'identity'. He is saying that the similarity of our thoughts and the continuity of them in this similarity does not mean that we can identify ourselves as a self but that our thoughts are similar.

=== Williams' argument in detail ===
&lt;!-- FIXME If you promise to present an argument in detail, please do. --&gt;
In addition to the preceding two arguments against the ''cogito'', other arguments have been advanced by Bernard Williams. He claims, for example, that what we are dealing with when we talk of thought, or when we say &quot;I am thinking,&quot; is something conceivable from a [[Grammatical person|third-person]] perspective; namely objective &quot;thought-events&quot; in the former case, and an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] thinker in the latter.

Williams provides a meticulous and exhaustive examination of this objection.  He argues, first, that it is impossible to make sense of &quot;there is thinking&quot; without relativizing it to ''something.''  However, this something cannot be Cartesian egos&lt;!-- why is this in plural? a little more explanation would be nice, especially because this Wikipedia is read a lot by non-native speakers such as myself --&gt;, because it is impossible to differentiate objectively between things just on the basis of the pure content of consciousness.

The obvious problem is that, through [[introspection]], or our experience of [[consciousness]], we have no way of moving to conclude the existence of any third-personal fact, to conceive of which would require something above and beyond just the purely subjective contents of the mind.

In Russian schools, they are taught that this theory is wrong.  However, Russians are ignorant, and do not exist.

=== S&amp;#248;ren Kierkegaard's critique ===
The Danish philosopher [[S&amp;#248;ren Kierkegaard]] provided a critical response to the cogito.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, S&amp;#248;ren. ''Philosophical Fragments''. Trans. Hong, Princeton, 1985. p. 38-42.&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard argues that the cogito already pre-supposes the existence of &quot;I&quot;, and therefore concluding with existence is logically trivial. Kierkegaard's argument can be made clearer if one extracts the premise &quot;I think&quot; into two further premises: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''&quot;x&quot; thinks''&lt;br/&gt;
''I am that &quot;x&quot;''&lt;br/&gt;
''Therefore I think''&lt;br/&gt;
''Therefore I am''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where &quot;x&quot; is used as a placeholder in order to disambiguate the &quot;I&quot; from the thinking thing.&lt;ref&gt;Schönbaumsfeld, Genia. ''A Confusion of the Spheres''. Oxford, 2007. p.168-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, the cogito has already assumed the &quot;I&quot;'s existence as that which thinks. For Kierkegaard, Descartes is merely &quot;developing the content of a concept&quot;, namely that the &quot;I&quot;, which already exists, thinks.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, S&amp;#248;ren. ''Philosophical Fragments''. Trans. Hong, Princeton, 1985. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard argues that the value of the cogito is not its logical argument, but its [[psychology|psychological]] appeal: a thought must have something that exists to think the thought. It is psychologically difficult to think &quot;I do not exist&quot;. But as Kierkegaard argues, the proper logical flow of argument is that existence is already assumed or pre-supposed in order for thinking to occur, not that existence is concluded from that thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Archie, Lee C, &quot;Søren Kierkegaard, ''God's Existence Cannot Be Proved''&quot;. Philosophy of Religion. Lander Philosophy, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl Barks''' (March 27, 1901 – August 25, 2000) was an American [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney Studio]] illustrator and [[comic book]] creator, who invented [[Duckburg]] and many of its inhabitants, such as [[Scrooge McDuck]] (1947), [[Gladstone Gander]] (1948), the [[Beagle Boys]] (1951), [[The Junior Woodchucks]] (1951), [[Gyro Gearloose]] (1952), [[Duck family (Disney)#Cornelius Coot|Cornelius Coot]] (1952), [[Flintheart Glomgold]] (1956), [[John D. Rockerduck]] (1961) and [[Magica De Spell]] (1961). The quality of his scripts and drawings earned him the nicknames '''The Duck Man''' and '''The Good Duck Artist'''. Writer-artist [[Will Eisner]] called him &quot;the [[Hans Christian Andersen]] of comic books.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tegneserier.no-Barks&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Morten Harper | title =Den gode tegneren, quote TEGN, 1994 | publisher =tegneserier.no | url =http://www.tegneserier.no/default.asp?lib=personer&amp;ID=71&amp;bhcp=1 | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20071015143405/http://www.tegneserier.no/default.asp?lib=personer&amp;ID=71&amp;bhcp=1 | archivedate =2007-10-15  }}{{no_icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Barks was one of the three inaugural inductees of the [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame]].

==Biography==
Barks was born in [[Merrill, Oregon]] to William Barks and his wife Arminta Johnson. He had an older brother named Clyde. Barks once stated that his paternal ancestors were Dutch and his maternal ancestors were Scottish. His paternal grandparents were David Barks and his wife Ruth Shrum. His maternal grandparents were Carl Johnson and his wife Suzanna Massey, but little else is known about his ancestors.

===Childhood===
According to Barks' description of his childhood, he was a rather lonely child. His parents owned one square mile (2.6&amp;nbsp;km²) of land that served as their farm. The nearest neighbor lived half a mile (800 m) away, but he was more an acquaintance to Barks' parents than a friend. The closest school was about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) away and Barks had to walk that distance every day. The rural area had few children, though, and Barks later remembered that his school had only about eight or ten students including him. He had high praise for the quality of the education he received in that small school. &quot;Schools were good in those days,&quot; he used to say.
The lessons lasted from nine o'clock in the morning to four o'clock in the afternoon and then he had to return to the farm. There he remembered not having anybody to talk to, as his parents were busy and he had little in common with his brother.

In 1908, William Barks (in an attempt to increase the family income) moved with his family to [[Midland, Oregon]], some miles north of Merrill, to be closer to the new railway lines. He established a new stock-breeding farm and sold his produce to the local slaughterhouses.

Nine-year-old Clyde and seven-year-old Carl worked long hours there. But Carl later remembered that the crowd which gathered at Midland's market place made a strong impression on him. This was expected, as he was not used to crowds up until then. According to Barks, his attention was mostly drawn to the [[cowboy]]s that frequented the market with their [[revolver]]s, strange nicknames for each other and sense of humor.

By 1911, they had been successful enough to move to [[Santa Rosa, California]]. There they started cultivating vegetables and set up some orchards. Unfortunately, the profits were not as high as William expected and they started having financial difficulties. William's anxiety over them was probably what caused his first nervous breakdown.

As soon as William recovered, he made the decision to move back to Merrill. The year was 1913, and Barks was already 12 years old; but, due to the constant moving, he had not yet managed to complete grade school. He resumed his education at this point and finally managed to graduate in 1916.

1916 served as a turning point in Barks' life for various reasons. First, Arminta, his mother, died in this year. Second, his hearing problems, which had already appeared earlier, had at the time become severe enough for him to have difficulties listening to his teachers talking. His hearing would continue to get worse later, but at that point he had not yet acquired a hearing aid. Later in life, he couldn't do without one. Third, the closest high school to their farm was five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) away and even if he did enlist in it, his bad hearing was likely to contribute to his learning problems. He had to decide to stop his school education, much to his disappointment.

===From job to job===
Barks started taking various jobs but had little success in such occupations as a farmer, woodcutter, turner, mule driver, cowboy and printer. From his jobs he learned, he later averred, how eccentric, stubborn and unpredictable men, animals and machines can be. At the same time he interacted with colleagues, fellow breadwinners who had satirical disposition towards even their worst troubles. Barks later declared that he was sure that if not for a little humor in their troubled lives, they would certainly go insane. It was an attitude towards life that Barks would adopt. Later he would say it was natural for him to satirize the secret yearnings and desires, the pompous style and the disappointments of his characters. According to Barks, this period of his life would later influence his best known [[fictional character]]s: [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Donald Duck]] and his own [[Scrooge McDuck]].

Donald's drifting from job to job was reportedly inspired by Barks' own experiences. So was his usual lack of success. And even in those that he was successful this would be temporary, just until a mistake or chance event caused another failure, another disappointment for the frustrated duck. Barks also reported that this was another thing he was familiar with.

Scrooge's main difference to Donald, according to Barks, was that he too had faced the same difficulties in his past but through intelligence, determination and hard work, he was able to overcome them. Or, as Scrooge himself would say to [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]]: by being &quot;tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties.&quot; Even in the present of his stories Scrooge would work to solve his many problems, even though the stories would often point out that his constant efforts seemed futile at the end. In addition, Scrooge was quite similar to his creator in appearing often to be as melancholic, introspective and secretive as he was.

Through both characters Barks would often exhibit his rather sarcastic sense of humor. It seems that this difficult period for the artist helped shape many of his later views in life that were expressed through his characters.

===Professional artist===
At the same time Barks had started thinking about turning a hobby that he always enjoyed into a profession: that of drawing. Since his early childhood he spent his free time by drawing on any material he could find. He had attempted to improve his style by copying the drawings of his favorite [[comic strip]] artists from the newspapers where he could find them. As he later said, he wanted to create his own facial expressions, figures and comical situations in his drawings but wanted to study the master comic artists' use of the pen and their use of color and shading.

Among his early favorites were [[Winsor McCay]] (mostly known for ''[[Little Nemo]]'') and [[Frederick Burr Opper]] (mostly known for ''[[Happy Hooligan]]'') but he would later study any style that managed to draw his attention.

At 16 he was mostly self-taught but at this point he decided to take some lessons through correspondence. He only followed the first four lessons and then had to stop because his working left him with little free time. But as he later said, the lessons proved very useful in improving his style.

By December 1918, he left his father's home to attempt to find a job in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. He worked for a while in a small publishing house while attempting to sell his drawings to newspapers and other printed material with little success.

===First marriage===
While he continued drifting through various jobs, he met Pearl Turner (1904–1987). In 1921 they married and had two daughters:
*Peggy Barks, born in 1923.
*Dorothy Barks, born in 1924.

In 1923 he returned to his paternal farm in Merrill in an attempt to return to the life of a farmer, but that ended soon. He continued searching for a job while attempting to sell his drawings. He soon managed to sell some of them to ''Judge'' magazine and then started having success submitting to the Minneapolis-based ''Calgary-Eye-Opener'', a racy men's cartoon magazine of the era. He was eventually hired as editor and scripted and drew most of the contents while continuing to sell occasional work to other magazines. His salary of 90 dollars a month was considered respectable enough for the time. A facsimile of one of the racy magazines he did cartoons for in this period, ''Coo Coo'' #1, was published by Hamilton Comics in 1997.

Meanwhile he had his first divorce. He and Pearl were separated in 1929 and divorced in 1930. After he moved to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], where ''Calgary-Eye-Opener'' had its offices he met Clara Balken who in 1938 became his second wife.

===Disney===
In November 1935, when he learned that [[Walt Disney]] was seeking more artists for his Studio, Barks decided to apply. He was approved for a try-out which entailed a move to [[Los Angeles, California]]. He was one of two in his class of trainees who was hired. His starting salary was 20 dollars a week. He started at Disney Studios in 1935, more than a year after the debut of [[Donald Duck]] on June 9, 1934 in the short animated film ''[[The Wise Little Hen]]''.

Barks initially worked as an [[animator#Inbetweeners and cleanup artists|inbetweener]]. This involved being teamed and supervised by one of the head animators who did the key poses of character action (often known as extremes) for which the inbetweeners did the drawings between the extremes to create the illusion of movement. While an inbetweener, Barks submitted gag ideas for cartoon story lines being developed and showed such a knack for creating comical situations that by 1937 he was transferred to the story department. His first story sale was the climax of [[Modern Inventions]], for a sequence where a robot barber chair gives Donald Duck a haircut on his butt.

In 1937 when Donald Duck became the star of his own series of cartoons instead of co-starring with [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Goofy]] as previously, a new unit of storymen and animators was created devoted solely to this series. Though he originally just contributed gag ideas to some duck cartoons by 1937 Barks was (principally with partner [[Jack Hannah]]) originating story ideas that were storyboarded and (if approved by Walt) put into production. He collaborated on such cartoons as ''[[Donald's Nephews]]'' (1938), ''[[Donald's Cousin Gus]]'' (1939), ''[[Mr. Duck Steps Out]]'' (1940),''[[Timber]]'' (1941), ''[[The Vanishing Private]]'' (1942) and ''[[The Plastics Inventor]]'' (1944).

===The Good Duck Artist===
[[Image:Omelet.jpg|thumb|Omelet opening page]]
Unhappy at the emerging wartime working conditions at Disney plus bothered by ongoing sinus problems caused by the studio's air conditioning, Barks quit in 1942. Shortly before quitting, he moonlighted as a comic book artist, contributing half the artwork for a one-shot [[comic book]] (the other half of the art being done by story partner [[Jack Hannah]]) titled ''[[Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold]]''. This 64-page story was adapted by Donald Duck comic strip writer [[Bob Karp]] from an unproduced feature, and published in October 1942 in [Dell] [[Four Color|Four Color Comics]] #9. It was the first Donald Duck story originally produced for an American comic book and also the first involving Donald and his nephews in a treasure hunting expedition, in this case for the treasure of [[Henry Morgan]]. Barks would later use the treasure hunting theme in many of his stories. This actually was not his first work in comics, as earlier the same year Barks along with Hannah and fellow storyman Nick George scripted ''[[Pluto Saves the Ship]]'', which was among the first original Disney comic book stories published in the United States.

After quitting the Studio, Barks relocated to the [[Hemet, California|Hemet]]/[[San Jacinto, California|San Jacinto]] area in the semi-desert [[Inland Empire (California)|inland empire]] region east of Los Angeles where he hoped to start a chicken farm.

When asked which of his stories was a favorite in several interviews Barks cited the ten-pager in ''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' #146 (Nov. 1952) in which Donald tells the story of the chain of unfortunate events that took place when he owned a chicken farm in a town which subsequently was re-named Omelet. Likely one reason it was a favorite is that it was inspired by Barks' own experiences in the poultry business.

But to earn a living in the meantime he inquired whether [[Western Publishing]], which had published Pirate Gold, had any need for artists for Donald Duck comic book stories. He was immediately assigned to illustrate the script for a ten-page Donald Duck story for the monthly ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]''. At the publisher's invitation he revised the storyline and the improvements impressed the editor sufficiently to invite Barks try his hand at contributing both the script and the artwork of his follow-up story. This set the pattern for Barks' career in that (with rare exceptions) he provided art (pencil, inking, solid blacks and lettering) and scripting for his stories.

''[[The Victory Garden (comic book)|The Victory Garden]]'', that initial ten-page story published in April, 1943 was the first of about 500 stories featuring the Disney ducks Barks would produce for Western Publishing over the next three decades, well into his purported retirement. These can be mostly divided into two categories:

*Ten-pagers, comedic Donald Duck stories that were the lead for the monthly flagship title Walt Disney's Comics and Stories, whose circulation peaked in the mid-1950s at 3 million copies sold a month.

*Humorous adventure stories, usually 24-32 pages in length. In the 1940s these were one-shots in the [[Four Color]] series (issued 4-6 times a year) that starred Donald and his nephews. From the early 1950s Barks undertook the quarterly adventures of Uncle Scrooge and the duck clan in Scrooge's own title.

He surrounded Donald Duck and nephews [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]] with a cast of eccentric and colorful characters, such as the aforementioned [[Scrooge McDuck]], the wealthiest [[duck]] in the world; [[Gladstone Gander]], Donald's obscenely lucky cousin; inventor [[Gyro Gearloose]]; the persistent [[Beagle Boys]]; the sorceress [[Magica De Spell]]; Scrooge's rivals [[Flintheart Glomgold]] and [[John D. Rockerduck]]; Daisy's nieces [[April, May and June]]; Donald's neighbor Jones, and [[The Junior Woodchucks]] organization.

===No longer anonymous===
People who work for Disney generally do so in relative anonymity; the stories only carry [[Walt Disney]]'s name and (sometimes) a short identification number. Prior to 1960, the creator of these stories remained a mystery to his readers. However, many readers recognized Barks' work and drawing style, and began to call him the Good Duck Artist, a label which stuck even after his true identity was discovered by John and [[Bill Spicer]] in 1959. After Barks received a 1960 visit from Bill and John Spicer and Ron Leonard, he was no longer anonymous, as his name soon became known to his readers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbarks.dk/thefanletter.htm Spicer, John. Letter, April 11, 1960.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Barks' stories (whether humorous adventures or domestic comedies) often exhibited a wry, dark irony born of hard experience. The 10 pagers showcased Donald as everyman, struggling against the cruel bumps and bruises of everyday life with the nephews often acting as a [[Greek chorus]] commenting on the unfolding disasters Donald wrought upon himself. Yet while seemingly defeatist in tone, the humanity of the characters shines through in their persistence despite the obstacles. These stories found popularity not only among young children but adults as well. Despite the fact that Barks had done little traveling his adventure stories often had the duck clan globe trotting to the most remote or spectacular of places. This allowed Barks to indulge his penchant for elaborate backgrounds that hinted at his thwarted ambitions of doing realistic stories in the vein of [[Hal Foster]]'s ''[[Prince Valiant]]''.

===Third marriage===
As Barks blossomed creatively, his marriage to Clara deteriorated. This is the period referred to in Barks' famed quip that he could feel his creative juices flowing while the whiskey bottles hurled at him by a tipsy Clara flew by his head. They were divorced in 1951, his second and last divorce. In this period Barks dabbled in fine art, exhibiting paintings at local art shows. It was at one of these in 1952 he became acquainted with fellow exhibitor Margaret Wynnfred Williams (1917 - March 10, 1993), nicknamed Garé. She was an accomplished landscape artist, some of whose paintings are in the collection of the [[Leanin' Tree Museum of Western Art]]. During her lifetime and to this day note cards of her paintings are available from Leanin' Tree. Her nickname appears as a store name in the story &quot;Christmas in Duckburg&quot;, featured on page 1 of Walt Disney’s Christmas Parade #9, published in 1958. Soon after they met she started assisting Barks, handling the solid blacks and lettering, both of which he had found onerous. They married in 1954 and the union lasted until her death.

===Later life===
[[Image:CarlBarksFinland.jpg|Carl Barks visiting [[Finland]] in June, 1994.|thumb]]
Carl Barks retired in 1966 but was persuaded by editor Chase Craig to script stories for Western. The last new comic book story drawn by Carl Barks was a [[Daisy Duck]] tale (&quot;The Dainty Daredevil&quot;) published in ''[[Walt Disney Comics Digest]]'' issue 5 (Nov. 1968). When bibliographer Michael Barrier asked Barks about why he drew it, Barks' vague recollection was no one was available and he was asked to do it as a favor by editor [[Chase Craig]].

He wrote one Uncle Scrooge story, three Donald Duck stories and from 1970-1974 was the main writer for the [[Junior Woodchucks]] comic book (issues 6 through 25). The latter included environmental themes that Barks first explored in 1957 [&quot;Land of the Pygmy Indians&quot;, Uncle Scrooge #18]. Barks also sold a few sketches to Western that were redrawn as covers. For a time the Barkses lived in [[Goleta, California]] before returning to the Inland Empire by moving to [[Temecula, California|Temecula]].

To make a little extra money beyond what his pension and scripting earnings brought in, Barks started doing oil paintings to sell at the local art shows he and Garé exhibited at. Subjects included humorous depictions of life on the farm and portraits of Native American princesses. These skillfully rendering paintings encouraged fan Glenn Bray to ask Barks if he could commission a painting of the ducks (&quot;A Tall Ship and a Star to Steer Her By&quot;, taken from the cover of ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #108 by Barks). This prompted Barks to contact George Sherman at Disney's Publications Department to request permission to produce and sell oil paintings of scenes from his stories. In July 1971 Barks was granted a royalty-free license by Disney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbarks.dk/thecorrespondence1970s.htm thecorrespondence1970s&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; When word spread that Barks was taking commissions from those interested in purchasing an oil of the ducks, much to his astonishment the response quickly outstripped what he reasonably could produce in the next few years.

{{QuoteSidebar|250px|#eeffff|right|Ode to the Disney Ducks|
They ride tall ships to the far away,&lt;br&gt;
and see the long ago. &lt;br&gt;
They walk where fabled people trod, &lt;br&gt;
and Yetis trod the snow.

They meet the folks who live on stars,&lt;br&gt;
and find them much like us,&lt;br&gt;
With food and love and happiness&lt;br&gt;
the things they most discuss.

The world is full of clans and cults&lt;br&gt;
abuzz as angry bees,&lt;br&gt;
And Junior Woodchucks snapping jeers&lt;br&gt;
at Littlest Chickadees.

The ducks show us that part of life&lt;br&gt;
is to forgive a slight.&lt;br&gt;
That black eyes given in revenge&lt;br&gt;
keep hatred burning bright.

So when our walks in sun or shade&lt;br&gt;
pass graveyards filled by wars,&lt;br&gt;
It's nice to stop and read of ducks&lt;br&gt;
whose battles leave no scars.

To read of ducks who parody&lt;br&gt;
our vain attempts at glory,&lt;br&gt;
They don't exist, but somehow leave&lt;br&gt;
us glad we bought their story.|Carl Barks – 1999}}

When Barks expressed dismay at coping with the backlog of orders he faced, fan/dealers Bruce Hamilton and Russ Cochran suggested Barks instead auction his paintings at conventions and via Cochran's catalog ''Graphic Gallery''. By September 1974 Barks had discontinued taking commissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20091028084238/http://www.geocities.com/~jimlowe/barks/images/barkcard.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

At Boston's NewCon convention, in October 1975, the first Carl Barks oil painting auctioned at a comic book convention (&quot;She Was Spangled and Flashy&quot;) sold for $2,500. Subsequent offerings saw an escalation in the prices realized. The buyer of this painting, Jerry Osborne, quickly became one of Barks' close friends. Barks even painted Osborne into the scene of his 1976 &quot;July Fourth in Duckburg.&quot; Jerry Osborne delivered the eulogy at Barks' funeral at Grants Pass, Oregon.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In 1976, Barks and Garé went to Boston for the NewCon show, their first comic convention appearance. Among the other attendees was famed [[Little Lulu]] comic book scripter [[John Stanley (comics)|John Stanley]]; despite both having worked for [[Western Publishing]] this was the first time they met. The highlight of the convention was the auctioning of what was to that time the largest duck oil painting Barks had done, &quot;July Fourth in Duckburg&quot;, which included depictions of several prominent Barks fans and collectors. It sold for a then record high amount: $6,400.

Soon thereafter a fan sold unauthorized prints of some of the [[Scrooge McDuck]] paintings, leading Disney to withdraw permission for further paintings. To meet demand for new work Barks embarked on a series of paintings of non-Disney ducks and fantasy subjects such as Beowulf and Xerxes. These were eventually collected in the limited-edition book ''Animal Quackers''.

As the result of heroic efforts by ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' producer [[Gary Kurtz]] and screenwriter [[Edward Summer]], Disney relented and in 1981, allowed Barks to do a now seminal oil painting called &quot;Wanderers of Wonderlands&quot; for a breakthrough limited edition book entitled ''[[Uncle Scrooge McDuck: His Life and Times]]''. The book collected 11 classic Barks stories of Uncle Scrooge colored by artist [[Peter Ledger]] along with a new Scrooge story by Barks done storybook style with watercolor illustrations, &quot;Go Slowly, Sands of Time&quot;. After being turned down by every major publisher in New York City, Kurtz and Summer published the book through [[Celestial Arts]], which Kurtz acquired partly for this purpose. The book went on to become the model for virtually every important collection of comic book stories. It was the first book of its kind ever reviewed in ''[[Time Magazine]] ''and subsequently in ''[[Newsweek]]'', and the first book review in ''Time Magazine'' with large color illustrations.

In 1977 and 1982, Barks attended the San Diego Comic Con. As with his appearance in Boston, the response to his presence was overwhelming, with long lines of fans waiting to meet Barks and get his autograph.

In 1981, Bruce Hamilton and Russ Cochran, two long-time Disney comics fans, decided to combine forces to bring greater recognition to the works of Carl Barks. Their first efforts went into establishing [[Another Rainbow]] Publishing, the banner under which they produced and issued the award-winning book, &quot;The Fine Art of Walt Disney´s Donald Duck by Carl Barks&quot;, a comprehensive collection of the Disney duck paintings of this artist and storyteller. Not long after, the company began producing fine art lithographs of many of these paintings, in strictly limited editions, all signed by Barks, who eventually produced many original works for the series.

In 1983 Another Rainbow took up the daunting task of collecting the entire Disney comic book ouvré of Barks—over 500 stories in all—in the ten-set, thirty-volume ''[[Carl Barks Library]]''. These oversized hardbound volumes reproduced Barks´ pages in pristine black and white line art, as close as possible to the way he would originally drawn them, and included mountains of special features, articles, reminiscences, interviews, storyboards, critiques, and more than a few surprises. This monumental project was finally completed in mid-1990.

In 1985 a new division was founded, [[Gladstone Publishing]], which took up the then-dormant Disney comic book license. Gladstone introduced a whole new generation of Disney comic book readers to the wondrous storytelling of such luminaries as Barks, Paul Murry, and Floyd Gottfredson, as well as presenting the first works of modern Disney comics masters Don Rosa and William Van Horn. Seven years after Gladstone's founding, the Carl Barks Library was revived as full-color, high-quality squarebound comic albums (including the first-ever Carl Barks trading cards) - the ''Carl Barks Library in Color''.

Barks relocated one last time to [[Grants Pass, Oregon]] near where he grew up, partly at the urging of friend and ''[[Broom Hilda]]'' artist [[Russell Myers]], who lived in the area. The move also was motivated, Barks stated in another famous quip, by Temecula being too close to Disneyland and thus facilitating a growing torrent of drop-in visits by vacationing fans. In this period Barks made only one public appearance, at a comic book shop near Grants Pass.

From 1993 to 1998, Barks' career was managed by the &quot;Carl Barks Studio&quot; (Bill Grandey and Kathy Morby—They had sold Barks original art since 1979). This involved numerous art projects and activities, including a tour of 11 European countries in 1994, [[Iceland]] being the first foreign country he ever visited. Barks appeared at the first of many Disneyana conventions in 1993. Silk screen prints of paintings along with high-end art objects (such as original water colors, bronze figurines and ceramic tiles) were produced based on designs by Barks.

During the summer of 1994 and until his death, Carl Barks &amp; his studio personally assigned Peter Reichelt, a museum exhibition producer from [[Mannheim, Germany]], as his agent for Europe. Publisher &quot;Edition 313&quot; put out numerous lithographs. In 1997, tensions between Barks and the Studio eventually resulted in a lawsuit that was settled with an agreement that included the disbanding of the Studio. Barks never traveled to make another Disney appearance. He was represented by Rev. Ed Bergen, as he completed a final project. Gerry Tank and Jim Mitchell were to assist Barks in his final years.

During his Carl Barks Studio years, Barks created two more stories: the script for the final Uncle Scrooge story &quot;Horsing Around with History&quot;, which was first published in Denmark in 1994 with Bill Van Horn art. The Barks outlines for Barks final Donald Duck story &quot;Somewhere in Nowhere&quot;, were first published in 1997, in Italy, with art by Pat Block.

Austrian artist [[Gottfried Helnwein]] curated and organized the first solo museum-exhibition of Carl Barks. Between 1994 and 1998 the retrospective was shown in ten European museums and seen by more than 400,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helnwein.de/kuenstler/bibliografie/artikel_449.html Gottfried Helnwein | KÜNSTLER|Bibliografie|“WER IST CARL BARKS?”&quot;Wer ist Carl Barks?&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time in spring 1994, Reichelt and Ina Brockmann designed a special museum exhibition tour about Barks' life and work. Also represented for the first time at this exhibition were Disney artists [[Al Taliaferro]] and [[Floyd Gottfredson]]. Since 1995, more than 500,000 visitors have attended the shows in Europe.

Reichelt also translated the [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]] Barks biography into German and published it in 1994.

===Final days and death===
Still living in a new home in Grants Pass, Oregon which he and Garé had built next door to their original home, Barks died in 2000 at the age of 99, seven years after Garé had died.

Although he was undergoing [[chemotherapy]] for [[leukemia]] he was, according to caregiver Serene Hunickle, &quot;funny up to the end.&quot;

==Barks' influence==
Barks' Donald Duck stories were rated #7 on [[Comics Journal#Top 100 Comics list|Comic's Journal list of 100 top comics]]; his Uncle Scrooge stories were rated #20.

[[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]] have acknowledged that the rolling-boulder booby trap in the opening scene of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' was inspired by the 1954 Carl Barks Uncle Scrooge adventure &quot;The Seven Cities of Cibola&quot; (''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'' #7). Lucas and Spielberg have also said that some of Barks's stories about space travel and the depiction of aliens had an influence on them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921233,00.html], Lucas comments on the influence of Bark's style of story flow.&lt;/ref&gt;
Lucas wrote the foreword to the 1982 ''Uncle Scrooge McDuck: His Life and Times''. In it he calls Barks’s stories &quot;cinematic&quot; and &quot;a priceless part of our literary heritage&quot;.

The [[Walt Disney Treasures]] DVD set ''[[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Five#The Chronological Donald, Volume 2|Chronological Donald, Volume 2]]'' includes a salute to Barks.

Carl Barks has an [[asteroid]] named after him, [[2730 Barks]]. A [[Cornell University|Cornell]] scientist was inspired by Barks' tale &quot;Island in the Sky&quot;.

In [[Almere]], [[Netherlands]] a street was named after him: Carl Barksweg. The same neighborhood also includes a Donald Ducklaan and a Goofystraat.

A 1949 Donald Duck ten-pager features Donald raising a yacht from the ocean floor by filling it with [[ping pong]] balls. In December 1965 Karl Krøyer, a Dane, lifted the sunken freight vessel ''Al Kuwait'' in the Kuwait Harbor by filling the hull with 27 million tiny inflatable balls of [[polystyrene]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starch.dk/isi/kroyer/donald2.htm International Starch: Karl Kroyer WITandWISDOM Donald Duck version&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the suggestion is often made, Krøyer denies having been inspired by this Barks story. Some sources claim Krøyer was denied a Dutch patent registration (application number NL 6514306) for his invention on the grounds that the Barks story was a [[prior art|prior publication]] of the invention. However no definite proof of this story is available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iusmentis.com/patents/priorart/donaldduck/ The &quot;Donald Duck as prior art&quot; case (in Patents : When is something prior art @ iusmentis.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070927075256/http://www.octrooicentrum.nl/actueel/nieuws/20060601-1.aspx ''Donald Duck verslaat uitvinder! donderdag'' 1 juni 2006] [[Wayback machine]].&lt;/ref&gt; Krøyer later successfully raised another ship off Greenland using the same method, and several other sunken vessels worldwide have since been raised by modified versions of this concept. The television show [[MythBusters]] also tested this method and was able to raise a small boat.

For those currently drawing Disney Duck comics, the influence of Barks cannot be overstated. For artists such as [[Daan Jippes]] and [[Freddy Milton]], Barks' comics have made a great impact. [[Don Rosa]], one of the most popular living Disney artists, and possibly the one who has been most keen on connecting the various stories into a coherent universe and chronology, considers (with few exceptions) all Barks' duck stories as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], and all others as [[Apocrypha (fiction)|apocryphal]]. Rosa has said that a number of novelists and movie-makers cite Carl Barks as their 'major influence and inspiration'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpib.com/illustra2/barks2.htm], Rosa's comments on Barks&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of Barks' work in Europe is high, and has been that way for years. When the news of Barks' passing was hardly covered by the press in America, &quot;in Europe the sad news was flashed instantly across the airwaves and every newspaper&amp;nbsp;— they realized the world had lost one of the most beloved, influential and well-known creators in international culture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpib.com/illustra2/barks2.htm], Rosa's estimation of Barks' popularity in Europe&lt;/ref&gt;

Dozens of noted comic book artists have taken up elements of Barks' style, especially his ink and pen work.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In the US elements of Barks' oil painting style of the ducks were evident in the computer animated, 3-D look [[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]] released to video in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The video game ''[[Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers]]'' is dedicated to the memory of Carl Barks.

Carl Barks drew an early [[Andy Panda]] comic book story published in ''New Funnies'' #76, 1943. It is one of his few stories to feature humans interacting with [[funny animal]] characters (another is ''Dangerous Disguise'', [[Four Color]] #308, 1951&lt;ref&gt;[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+OS++308-02 Dangerous Disguise&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The life story of Carl Barks, largely drawing upon his relationship with Disney and the phonetic similarity of his name to Karl Marx, serves as a loose inspiration to one of the subplots in ''[[The Last Song of Manuel Sendero]]'' by [[Ariel Dorfman]], though his biography in this novel veers sharply into science fiction fantasy and symbolism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{redirect|CGS}}

The '''centimetre-gram-second system''' (abbreviated '''CGS''' or '''cgs''') is a [[metric system]] of [[units of measurement|physical units]] based on [[centimetre]] as the unit of [[length]], [[gram]] as a unit of [[mass]], and [[second]] as a unit of [[time]]. All CGS [[mechanics|mechanical unit]]s are unambiguously derived from these three base units, but there are several different ways of extending the CGS system to cover [[electromagnetism]].

The CGS system has been largely supplanted by the [[Mks system of units|MKS]] system, based on [[metre]], [[kilogram]], and [[second]]. MKS was in turn extended and replaced by the [[International System of Units]] (SI). The latter adopts the three base units of MKS, plus the [[ampere]], [[mole (unit)|mole]], [[candela]] and [[kelvin]]. In many fields of science and engineering, SI is the only system of units in use. However, there remain certain subfields where CGS is prevalent.

In measurements of purely mechanical systems (involving units of [[length]], [[mass]], [[force]], [[energy]], [[pressure]], and so on.), the differences between CGS and SI are straightforward and rather trivial; the [[Unit conversion|unit-conversion factors]] are all [[Exponentiation#Powers of ten|power]]s of 10 arising from the relations 100&amp;nbsp;cm = 1&amp;nbsp;m and 1000&amp;nbsp;g = 1&amp;nbsp;kg. For example, the CGS derived unit of force is the [[dyne]], equal to 1&amp;nbsp;g·cm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while the SI derived unit of force is the [[newton (unit)|newton]], 1&amp;nbsp;kg·m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus it is straightforward to show that 1&amp;nbsp;dyne=10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;newtons.

On the other hand, in measurements of electromagnetic phenomena (involving units of [[charge (physics)|charge]], electric and magnetic fields, [[voltage]], and so on), converting between CGS and SI is much more subtle and involved. In fact, formulas for physical laws of electromagnetism (such as [[Maxwell's equations]]) need to be adjusted depending on what system of units one uses. This is because there is no [[one-to-one]] correspondence between electromagnetic units in SI and those in CGS, as is the case for mechanical units. Furthermore, within CGS, there are several plausible choices of electromagnetic units, leading to different unit &quot;sub-systems&quot;, including [[Gaussian units|Gaussian]], &quot;ESU&quot;, &quot;EMU&quot;, and [[Lorentz–Heaviside units|Heaviside-Lorentz]]. Among these choices, Gaussian units are the most common today, and in fact the phrase &quot;CGS units&quot; is often used to refer specifically to [[Gaussian units|CGS-Gaussian units]].

==History==
The CGS system goes back to a proposal made in 1832 by the German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, it was extended by the British physicists [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] with a set of electromagnetic units.

The values (by [[order of magnitude]]) of many CGS units turned out to be inconvenient for practical purposes. For example, many everyday length measurements yield hundreds or thousands of centimetres, such as those of [[human height]] and sizes of rooms and buildings. Thus the CGS system never gained wide general use outside the field of electrodynamics and laboratory science. Starting in the 1880s, and more significantly by the mid-20th century, CGS was gradually superseded internationally by the MKS ('''m'''etre-'''k'''ilogram-'''s'''econd) system, which in turn became the modern [[SI]] standard.

From the international adoption of the MKS standard in the 1940s and the SI standard in the 1960s, the technical use of CGS units has gradually declined worldwide, in the [[United States]] more slowly than elsewhere. CGS units are today no longer accepted by the house styles of most scientific journals, textbook publishers, or standards bodies, although they are commonly used in astronomical journals such as the [[Astrophysical Journal]]. CGS units are still occasionally encountered in technical literature, especially in the [[United States]] in the fields of [[material science]], [[electrodynamics]] and [[astronomy]].

The units [[gram]] and [[centimetre]] remain useful ''as [[SI prefix|prefix]]ed units'' within the SI system, especially for instructional physics and chemistry experiments, where they match the small scale of table-top setups. However, where [[SI derived unit|derived unit]]s are needed, the SI ones are generally used and taught instead of the CGS ones today. For example, a physics lab course might ask students to record lengths in centimeters, and masses in grams, but force (a derived unit) in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s, a usage consistent with the SI system.

==Definition of CGS units in mechanics==
In mechanics, the CGS and SI systems of units are built in an identical way. The two systems differ only in the scale of two out of the three base units (centimetre versus metre and gram versus kilogram, respectively), while the third unit ([[second]] as the unit of time) is the same in both systems.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between the base units of mechanics in CGS and SI, and the laws of mechanics are not affected by the choice of units. The definitions of all [[derived unit]]s in terms of the three base units are therefore the same in both systems, and there is an unambiguous one-to-one correspondence of derived units:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; (definition of [[velocity]])
:&lt;math&gt;F=m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; ([[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]])
:&lt;math&gt;E = \int \vec{F}\cdot \vec{dx}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; ([[energy]] defined in terms of [[Mechanical work|work]])
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{F}{L^2} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; ([[pressure]] defined as force per unit area)
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \tau/\frac{dv}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; (dynamic [[viscosity]] defined as [[shear stress]] per unit velocity [[gradient]]).

Thus, for example, the CGS unit of pressure, [[barye]], is related to the CGS base units of length, mass, and time in the same way as the SI unit of pressure, [[pascal (unit)|pascal]], is related to the SI base units of length, mass, and time:

:1&amp;nbsp;unit of pressure = 1&amp;nbsp;unit of force/(1&amp;nbsp;unit of length)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1&amp;nbsp;unit of mass/(1&amp;nbsp;unit of length·(1&amp;nbsp;unit of time)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:1 Ba = 1 g/(cm·s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:1 Pa = 1 kg/(m·s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Expressing a CGS derived unit in terms of the SI base units, or vice versa, requires combining the scale factors that relate the two systems:

:1 Ba = 1 g/(cm·s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; kg/(10&lt;sup&gt;-2 &lt;/sup&gt;m·s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 10&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; kg/(m·s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 10&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; Pa.

==Derivation of CGS units in electromagnetism==
===CGS approach to electromagnetic units===
The conversion factors relating [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] units in the CGS and SI systems are much more involved — so much so that formulas for physical laws of electromagnetism are adjusted depending on what system of units one uses. This illustrates the fundamental difference in the ways the two systems are built: 
* In SI, the unit of [[electric current]] is chosen&lt;ref&gt;For historical reasons, 1 [[ampere]] is chosen such that the [[magnetism|magnetic]] force exerted by two infinitely long, thin, parallel wires 1 [[metre|m]] apart and carrying this current is exactly 2×10&lt;sup&gt;–7&lt;/sup&gt; [[newton (unit)|N]]/[[metre|m]]. This definition makes all SI electromagnetic units consistent (up to some [[integer]] powers of 10) with the EMU CGS system described in further sections.&lt;/ref&gt; to be 1 [[ampere]] (A). It is a base unit of the SI system, along with meter, kilogram, and second. The ampere is not dimensionally equivalent to any combination of other base units, so electromagnetic laws written in SI require an additional constant of proportionality (see [[Vacuum permittivity]]) to bridge electromagnetic units to kinematic units. All other electric and magnetic units are derived from these four base units using the most basic common definitions: for example, [[charge (physics)|electric charge]] ''q'' is defined as current ''I'' multiplied by time ''t'',
::&lt;math&gt;q=I\cdot t&lt;/math&gt;,
:therefore unit of electric charge, coulomb (C), is defined as 1 C = 1 A·s.
* CGS system avoids introducing new base units and instead ''derives'' all electric and magnetic units from centimeter, gram, and second based on the physics laws that relate electromagnetic phenomena to mechanics.

===Alternate derivations of CGS units in electromagnetism===
Electromagnetic relationships to length, time and mass may be derived by equally appealing methods. Two of them rely on the forces observed on charges. Two fundamental laws relate (independently of each other) the electric charge or its [[derivative|rate of change]] (electric current) to a mechanical quantity such as force. They can be written&lt;ref name=Jack&gt;{{cite book 
| author=Jackson, John David 
| title=Classical Electrodynamics

| isbn=0-471-30932-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in system-independent form as follows:

*The first is [[Coulomb's law]], &lt;math&gt;F = k_C \frac{q \cdot q^\prime}{d^2}&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the electrostatic force ''F'' between electric charges &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, separated by distance ''d''. Here &lt;math&gt;k_C&lt;/math&gt; is a constant which depends on how exactly the unit of charge is derived from the CGS base units.

*The second is [[Ampère's force law]], &lt;math&gt;\frac{dF}{dL} = 2 k_A\frac{I \, I^\prime}{d}&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the magnetic force ''F'' per unit length ''L'' between currents ''I'' and ''I''' flowing in two straight parallel wires of infinite length, separated by a distance ''d'' that is much greater than the wires' diameters. Since &lt;math&gt;I=q/t\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; I^\prime=q^\prime/t&lt;/math&gt;, the constant &lt;math&gt;k_A&lt;/math&gt; also depends on how the unit of charge is derived from the CGS base units.

[[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism]] relates these two laws to each other. It states that the ratio of proportionality constants &lt;math&gt;k_C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_A&lt;/math&gt; must obey &lt;math&gt;k_C / k_A = c^2&lt;/math&gt;, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. Therefore, if one derives the unit of charge from the Coulomb's law by setting &lt;math&gt;k_C=1&lt;/math&gt;, it is obvious that the Ampère's force law will contain a prefactor &lt;math&gt;2/c^2&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively, deriving the unit of current, and therefore the unit of charge, from the Ampère's force law by setting &lt;math&gt; k_A = 1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;k_A = 1/2&lt;/math&gt;, will lead to a constant prefactor in the Coulomb's law.

Indeed, both of these mutually-exclusive approaches have been practiced by the users of CGS system, leading to the two independent and mutually-exclusive branches of CGS, described in the subsections below. However, the freedom of choice in deriving electromagnetic units from the units of length, mass, and time is not limited to the definition of charge. While the electric field can be related to the work performed by it on a moving electric charge, the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the moving charge, and thus the work performed by the magnetic field on any charge is always zero. This leads to a choice between two laws of magnetism, each relating magnetic field to mechanical quantities and electric charge:
* The first law describes the [[Lorentz force]] produced by a magnetic field '''B''' on a charge '''q''' moving with velocity '''v''':
:: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} =  \alpha_L q\;\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}\;. &lt;/math&gt;
* The second describes the creation of a static magnetic field '''B''' by an electric current ''I'' of finite length d'''l''' at a point displaced by a vector '''r''', known as [[Biot-Savart law]]:
:: &lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{B} =  \alpha_B\frac{I d\mathbf{l} \times \mathbf{\hat r}}{r^2}\;,&lt;/math&gt; where ''r'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat r}&lt;/math&gt; are the length and the unit vector in the direction of vector '''r'''.
These two laws can be used to derive [[Ampère's force law]], resulting in the relationship: &lt;math&gt;k_A  = \alpha_L \cdot \alpha_B\;&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, if the unit of charge is based on the [[Ampère's force law]] such that &lt;math&gt;k_A  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, it is natural to derive the unit of magnetic field by setting &lt;math&gt;\alpha_L = \alpha_B=1\;&lt;/math&gt;. However, if it is not the case, a choice has to be made as to which of the two laws above is a more convenient basis for deriving the unit of magnetic field. 

Furthermore, if we wish to describe the [[electric displacement field]] '''D''' and the [[magnetic field]] '''H''' in a medium other than a vacuum, we need to also define the constants ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, which are the [[vacuum permittivity]] and [[magnetic constant|permeability]], respectively. &lt;!-- These two values are related by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\mu_0\epsilon_0}=\alpha_B / c&lt;/math&gt;. // removed this statement - seems impossible to prove! --&gt; Then we have&lt;ref name=Jack/&gt; (generally) &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} = \epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \lambda \mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{B} / \mu_0 - \lambda^\prime \mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt;, where '''P''' and '''M''' are [[polarization density]] and [[magnetization]] vectors. The factors λ and λ′ are rationalization constants, which are usually chosen to be 4πk&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, a dimensionless quantity. If λ = λ′ = 1, the system is said to be &quot;rationalized&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the laws for systems of [[spherical geometry]] contain factors of 4π (for example, [[point charge]]s), those of cylindrical geometry — factors of 2π (for example, [[wire]]s), and those of planar geometry contain no factors of π (for example, parallel-plate [[capacitor]]s). However, the original CGS system used λ = λ′ = 4π, or, equivalently, ''k&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. Therefore, Gaussian, ESU, and EMU subsystems of CGS (described below) are not rationalized.

===Various extensions of the CGS system to electromagnetism===
The table below shows the values of the above constants used in some common CGS subsystems:

The constant ''b'' in SI system is a unit-based scaling factor defined as: &lt;math&gt;b=10^7\,\mathrm{A}^2/\mathrm{N} = 10^7\,\mathrm{m/H}=4\pi/\mu_0=4\pi\epsilon_0 c^2\;&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;\alpha_L=k_3=k_F&lt;/math&gt;

Note that of all these variants, only in Gaussian and Heaviside-Lorentz systems &lt;math&gt;\alpha_L&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;c^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; rather than 1. As a result, vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec B&lt;/math&gt; of an [[electromagnetic wave]] propagating in vacuum have the same units and are equal in [[Magnitude (mathematics)#Euclidean vectors|magnitude]] in these two variants of CGS.

===Electrostatic units (ESU)===
{{main|Electrostatic units}}
In one variant of the CGS system, '''Electrostatic units''' ('''ESU'''), charge is defined via the force it exerts on other charges, and current is then defined as charge per time. It is done by setting the [[Coulomb force constant]] &lt;math&gt;k_C = 1&lt;/math&gt;, so that [[Coulomb's law]] does not contain an explicit [[Proportionality (mathematics)|prefactor]]. 

The ESU unit of charge, '''franklin''' ('''Fr'''), also known as '''[[statcoulomb]]''' or '''esu charge''', is therefore defined as follows:&lt;ref name=cardsgc&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Bquote|two equal point charges spaced 1 [[centimetre]] apart are said to be of 1 franklin each if the electrostatic force between them is 1 [[dyne]].}} Therefore, in '''electrostatic CGS units''', a franklin is equal to a centimetre times square root of dyne:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{1\,Fr = 1\,statcoulomb = 1\,esu\; charge = 1\,cm\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{3/2} \cdot s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;.
The unit of current is defined as:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{1\,Fr/s = 1\,statampere = 1\,esu\; current = 1\,(cm/s)\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{3/2} \cdot s^{-2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Dimensionally in the ESU CGS system, charge ''q'' is therefore equivalent to m&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;t&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Neither charge nor current are therefore an independent dimension of physical quantity in ESU CGS. This reduction of units is an application of the [[Buckingham π theorem]].

====ESU notation====
All electromagnetic units in ESU CGS system that do not have proper names are denoted by a corresponding SI name with an attached prefix &quot;stat&quot; or with a separate abbreviation &quot;esu&quot;.&lt;ref name=cardsgc/&gt;

===Electromagnetic units (EMU)===
In another variant of the CGS system, '''Electromagnetic units''' ('''EMU'''), current is defined via the force existing between two thin, parallel, infinitely long wires carrying it, and charge is then defined as current multiplied by time. (This approach was eventually used to define the SI unit of [[ampere]] as well). In the EMU CGS subsystem, is done by setting the Ampere force constant &lt;math&gt;k_A = 1&lt;/math&gt;, so that [[Ampère's force law]] simply contains 2 as an explicit [[Proportionality (mathematics)|prefactor]] (this prefactor 2 is itself a result of integrating a more general formulation of Ampère's law over the length of the infinite wire).

The EMU unit of current, '''biot''' ('''Bi'''), also known as '''[[abampere]]''' or '''emu current''', is therefore defined as follows:&lt;ref name=cardsgc/&gt;
{{Bquote|The '''biot''' is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed one [[centimetre]] apart [[in vacuo]], would produce between these conductors a force equal to two [[dyne]]s per centimetre of length.}} Therefore, in '''electromagnetic CGS units''', a biot is equal to a square root of dyne:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{1\,Bi = 1\,abampere = 1\,emu\; current= 1\,\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{1/2} \cdot s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;.
The unit of charge in CGS EMU is:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{1\,Bi\cdot s = 1\,abcoulomb = 1\,emu\, charge= 1\,s\cdot\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Dimensionally in the EMU CGS system, charge ''q'' is therefore equivalent to m&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;. Neither charge nor current are therefore an independent dimension of physical quantity in EMU CGS.

====EMU notation====
All electromagnetic units in EMU CGS system that do not have proper names are denoted by a corresponding SI name with an attached prefix &quot;ab&quot; or with a separate abbreviation &quot;emu&quot;.&lt;ref name=cardsgc/&gt;

===Relations between ESU and EMU units===
The ESU and EMU subsystems of CGS are connected by the fundamental relationship &lt;math&gt;k_C / k_A = c^2&lt;/math&gt; (see above), where ''c'' = 29,979,245,800 ≈ 3·10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum in cm/s. Therefore, the ratio of the corresponding “primary″ electrical and magnetic units (e.g. current, charge, voltage, etc. — quantities proportional to those that enter directly into [[Coulomb's law]] or [[Ampère's force law]]) is equal either to ''c&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;'' or ''c'':&lt;ref name=cardsgc/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{1\,statcoulomb}{1\,abcoulomb}}=
\mathrm{\frac{1\,statampere}{1\,abampere}}=c^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{1\,statvolt}{1\,abvolt}}=
\mathrm{\frac{1\,stattesla}{1\,gauss}}=c&lt;/math&gt;.
Units derived from these may have ratios equal to higher powers of ''c'', for example:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{1\,statohm}{1\,abohm}}=
\mathrm{\frac{1\,statvolt}{1\,abvolt}}\times\mathrm{\frac{1\,abampere}{1\,statampere}}=c^2&lt;/math&gt;.

===Other variants===
There were at various points in time about half a dozen systems of electromagnetic units in use, most based on the CGS system.&lt;ref&gt;{{

Further complicating matters is the fact that some physicists and [[Engineering|engineers]] in the United States use hybrid units, such as [[volt]]s per [[centimetre]] for electric field. In fact, this  is essentially the same as the SI unit system, by the variant to translate all lengths used into cm, e.g. 1&amp;nbsp;m = 100&amp;nbsp;cm. 
&lt;!-- More difficult is to translate electromagnetic quantities from SI to CGS, which is also not hard, e.g. by using the three relations &lt;math&gt;q'=q/\sqrt{4\pi \epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf E'=\mathbf E\cdot \sqrt{4\pi \epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf B'=\mathbf B\cdot\sqrt{4\pi/ \mu_0}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0(\,\,\equiv 1/(c^2\mu_0))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt; are the well-known vacuum permittivities and ''c'' the corresponding light velocity,  whereas &lt;math&gt; q, \,\,\mathbf E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf B&lt;/math&gt; are the electrical charge, electric field, and magnetic induction, respectively, ''without primes'' in a SI system and ''with primes'' in a CGS system. // removed this statement - seems confusing, since different variants of CGS have different units! --&gt;

In this table, ''c'' = 29,979,245,800 ≈ 3·10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum in the CGS units of cm/s.

One can think of the SI value of the [[Coulomb constant]] ''k&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' as:
:&lt;math&gt;k_C=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}=\frac{\mu_0 (c/100)^2}{4\pi}=10^{-7}\cdot 10^{-4}\cdot c^2 = 10^{-11}\cdot c^2 .&lt;/math&gt;
This explains why SI to ESU conversions involving factors of ''c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' lead to significant simplifications of the ESU units, such as 1 statF = 1&amp;nbsp;cm and 1 statΩ = 1 s/cm: this is the consequence of the fact that in ESU system ''k&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''=1. For example, a centimetre of capacitance is the capacitance between a sphere of radius 1&amp;nbsp;cm in vacuum and infinity. The capacitance ''C'' between two concentric spheres of radii ''R'' and ''r'' in ESU CGS system is:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\frac{1}{r}-\frac{1}{R}}&lt;/math&gt;.
By taking the limit as ''R'' goes to infinity we see ''C'' equals ''r''.

==Pro and contra==
While the absence of explicit prefactors in some CGS subsystems simplifies some theoretical calculations, it has the disadvantage that sometimes the units in CGS are hard to define through experiment. Also, lack of unique unit names leads to a great confusion: thus “15 emu” may mean either 15 [[abvolt]], or 15 emu units of [[electric dipole moment]], or 15 emu units of [[magnetic susceptibility]], sometimes (but not always) per [[gram]] or per [[mole (unit)|mole]]. On the other hand, SI starts with a unit of current, the [[ampere]], which is easier to determine through experiment, but which requires extra prefactors in the electromagnetic equations. With its system of unique named units, SI also removes any confusion in usage: 1 [[ampere]] is a fixed quantity of a specific variable, and so are 1 [[henry (unit)|henry]] and 1 [[ohm]].

A key virtue of the [[Gaussian units|Gaussian CGS system]] is that electric and magnetic fields have the same units, &lt;math&gt;4\pi\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, and the only dimensional constant appearing in the equations is &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, the speed of light. The [[Lorentz–Heaviside units|Heaviside-Lorentz system]] has these desirable properties as well (with &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; equaling 1), but it is a &quot;rationalized&quot; system (as is SI) in which the charges and fields are defined in such a way that there are many fewer factors of &lt;math&gt;4 \pi&lt;/math&gt; appearing in the formulas, and it is in Heaviside-Lorentz units that the [[Maxwell equations]] take their simplest form.

In SI, and other rationalized systems (for example, [[Lorentz–Heaviside units|Heaviside-Lorentz]]), the unit of current was chosen such that electromagnetic equations concerning charged spheres contain 4π, those concerning coils of current and straight wires contain 2π and those dealing with charged surfaces lack π entirely, which was the most convenient choice for [[Electrical engineering|electrical-engineering]] applications. In those fields where formulas concerning spheres dominate (for example, [[astronomy]]), it has been argued that the non-rationalized CGS system can be somewhat more convenient notationally.

In fact, in certain fields, specialized unit systems are used to simplify formulas even further than ''either'' SI ''or'' CGS, by using some system of [[natural units]]. For example, the [[particle physics]] community uses a system where every quantity is expressed by only one unit, the [[electron volt|eV]], with lengths, times, and so on. all converted into eV's by inserting factors of [[Speed of light|''c'']] and [[Planck constant|&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt;]]. This unit system is very convenient for particle-physics calculations, but would be impractical in other contexts.

'''Christology''' (from ''Christ'' and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is the field of study within [[Christian theology]] which is primarily concerned with the nature and person of [[Jesus Christ]] as recorded in the [[Canonical gospels]] and the letters of the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref name=Gerald3 &gt;''Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus'' by Gerald O'Collins 2009 ISBN 019955787X pages 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; Primary considerations include the relationship of Jesus' nature and person with the nature and person of [[God the Father]]. As such, Christology is concerned with the details of Jesus' life (what he did) and his teachings (what he said) in order to arrive at a clearer understanding of who he is in his person, and his role in salvation.&lt;ref name=CathChristology &gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14597a.htm Catholic encyclopedia: Christology]&lt;/ref&gt;

A major component of the Christology of the [[Apostolic Age]] was that of [[Saint Paul]] whose central themes were the notion of [[pre-existence of Christ]] and the worship of Christ as ''[[Kyrios (Biblical term)|Kyrios]]'' (the Lord).&lt;ref name=Aloys &gt;''Christ in Christian Tradition: From the Apostolic Age to Chalcedon' by Aloys Grillmeier, John Bowden 1975 ISBN 066422301X pages 15-19 [http://books.google.com/books?id=LH-cBwmmY2cC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Pauline+Christology&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=udXdTJ7NAYvHswa0lKCLDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Pauline%20Christology&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[Apostolic Age]], a number of issues in Christology were debated, and due to seemingly minor, but politically charged differences, in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]] [[Schism (religion)|schism]]s among [[Christian denominations|denominations]] developed.

In the 13th century Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] provided the first systematic Christology that consistently resolved a number of the existing issues. In his Christology from above, Aquinas also championed the principle of [[Principle of perfection of Christ|perfection of Christ]]'s human attributes.&lt;ref name=mini76 &gt;''Christology: Biblical And Historical'' by Mini S. Johnson, 2005 ISBN 81-8324-007-0 page 76-79 [http://books.google.com/books?id=Aa3yRbs0tisC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=Christology+aquinas&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EZDgTPP6K8HEswach6z4Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Christology%20aquinas&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerald208 &gt;''Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus'' by Gerald O'Collins 2009 ISBN 019955787X pages 208-212 [http://books.google.com/books?id=pcTnZV0QVLYC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=Christology+aquinas&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EZDgTPP6K8HEswach6z4Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Christology%20aquinas&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Geest &gt;''Aquinas as authority'' by Paul van Geest, Harm J.

According to theologian [[Karl Rahner]], the purpose of modern Christology is to formulate the Christian belief that &quot;God became man and that God-made-man is the individual Jesus Christ&quot; in a manner that this statement can be understood consistently, without the confusions of past debates and mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by Karl Rahner 2004 ISBN 0860120066 pages 755-767&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are some Christian denominations, such as [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], that believe that God and Jesus are literally separate beings.

==Terms and concepts==
{{see also|Christ}}
Over the centuries, a number of terms and concepts have been developed within the framework of Christology to address the seemingly simple questions: &quot;who was Jesus and what did he do?&quot; A good deal of theological debate has ensued and significant schisms within Christian denominations took place in the process of providing answers to these questions. After the [[Middle Ages]] systematic approaches to Christology were developed.
 
The term ''Christology from above'' refers to approaches that begin with the [[Divinity of Christ|Divinity]] and [[pre-existence of Christ]] as the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] (the Word), as expressed in the [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1|first sections of the Gospel of John]]. These approaches interpret the works of Christ in terms of his Divinity. Christology from above was emphasized in the ancient Church, beginning with [[Ignatius of Antioch]] in the 2nd century.&lt;ref name=Gerald16 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pannenberg33 &gt;''Jesus God and Man'' by Wolfhart Pannenberg 1968 ISBN 0664244688 page 33&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Christology from below'', on the other hand, refers to approaches that begin with the human aspects and the ministry of Jesus (including the miracles, parables, etc.) and move towards his Divinity and the mystery of Incarnation.&lt;ref name=Gerald16 &gt;''Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus'' by Gerald O'Collins 2009 ISBN 019955787X pages 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pannenberg33 /&gt; 

The concept of ''Cosmic Christology'', was first elaborated by [[Saint Paul]] and focuses on how the arrival of Jesus as the Son of God forever changed the nature of the cosmos.&lt;ref name=Aloys /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jesus page 282&quot;&gt;''The Witness of Jesus, Paul and John: An Exploration in Biblical Theology'' by Larry R. Helyer 2008 ISBN 0830828885 page 282&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''functional'', ''[[Ontology|ontological]]'' and ''[[Christian soteriology|soteriological]]'' have been used to refer to the perspectives that analyze the &quot;works&quot;, the &quot;being&quot; and the &quot;[[Christian soteriology|salvific]]&quot; standpoints of Christology.&lt;ref&gt;''Christology from within and ahead'' by Mark L. Y. Chan 2001 ISBN 9004118446 pages 59-62 [http://books.google.com/books?id=9NQJ74t0aE4C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=ontological+christology&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=n6rfTOTAJM2Kswbao6X8Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ontological%20christology&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Some essential sub-topics within the field of Christology include the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]], the [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], and [[Christian salvation|salvation]].

The term ''monastic Christology'' has been used to describe spiritual approaches developed by [[Anselm of Canterbury]], [[Peter Abelard]] and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]. The [[Franciscan]] piety of the 12th and 13th centuries led to ''popular Christology''. Systematic approaches by theologians such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] are called ''scholastic Christology''.&lt;ref name=mini7 /&gt;

==Beginnings==
[[File:V&amp;A - Raphael, St Paul Preaching in Athens (1515).jpg|thumb|240px|[[Saint Paul]] delivering the ''[[Areopagus sermon]]'' in [[Athens]], by [[Raphael]], 1515.]]

[[Early Christians]] found themselves confronted with a set of new concepts and ideas relating to the life, death and [[resurrection of Jesus]], as well the notions of [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] and redemption, and had to use a new set of terms, images and ideas to deal with them.&lt;ref name=McGrath &gt;''Christianity: an introduction'' by Alister E. McGrath pages 2006 ISBN 1405109017 137-141&lt;/ref&gt; The existing terms and structures available to them were often insufficient to express these new set of religious concepts, and taken together, these new forms of discourse lead to the beginnings of Christology, as an attempt to understand, explain and discuss their understanding of the nature of Christ.&lt;ref name=McGrath /&gt;

Furthermore, as early Christians (following the [[Great Commission]]) had to explain their concepts to a new audience which
had at times been influenced by Greek philosophy.  They had to present arguments that at times
resonated with, and at times confronted the beliefs of that audience. A key example is [[Apostle Paul]]'s [[Areopagus sermon]] that appears in {{bibleverse||Acts|17:16-34|NIV|}}. Here the apostle attempted to convey the underlying concepts about Christ to a Greek audience and the sermon illustrates some key elements of future Christological discourses that were first brought forward by Paul.&lt;ref name=McGrath /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Creation and redemption: a study in Pauline theology'' by John G. Gibbs 1971 Brill Publishers pages 151-153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Watson &gt;''Mercer Commentary on the New Testament'' by Watson E. Mills 2003 ISBN 0865548641 pages 1109-1110&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Kyrios|Kyrios title]]'' for Jesus is central to the development of [[New Testament]] Christology, for the [[Early Christianity|early Christians]] placed it at the center of their understanding and from that center attempted to understand the other issues related to the Christian mysteries.&lt;ref name=MiniJohnson &gt;''Christology: Biblical And Historical'' by Mini S. Johnson, 2005 ISBN 81-8324-007-0 pages 229-235 [http://books.google.com/books?id=Aa3yRbs0tisC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=Kyrios+christology&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hTbeTIlPzfiyBoT30fUL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Kyrios%20christology&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The question of the deity of Christ in the New Testament is inherently related to the [[Kyrios]] title of Jesus used in the early Christian writings and its implications for the absolute lordship of Jesus. In early Christian belief, the concept of Kyrios included the [[Pre-existence of Christ]] for they believed that if Christ is one with God, he must have been united with God from the very beginning.&lt;ref name=MiniJohnson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cullmann &gt;''The Christology of the New Testament'' by Oscar Cullmann 1959 ISBN 0664243517 pages 234-237 [http://books.google.com/books?id=79Zovlpi8uQC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=Kyrios&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WtjdTIyAHcfzsgb_qbCTDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Kyrios&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In everyday [[Aramaic]], ''Mari'' was a very respectful form of polite address, which means more than just &quot;Teacher&quot; and was somewhat similar to [[Rabbi]]. In Greek this has at times been translated as Kyrios. While the term Mari expressed the relationship between Jesus and his disciples during his life, the Greek Kyrios came to represent his lordship over the world.&lt;ref name=Cullmann2 &gt;''The Christology of the New Testament'' by Oscar Cullmann 1959 ISBN 0664243517 page 202 [http://books.google.com/books?id=79Zovlpi8uQC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=mari+aramaic+jesus&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DUDeTMDXGoT2sgbW5tmEDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=mari%20aramaic%20jesus&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apostolic Christology===
[[File:The Four Evangelists.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The [[Four Evangelists]], by [[Pieter Soutman]], 17th century.]]
{{cquote2|And he asked them, &quot;But who do you say that I am?&quot;
Peter answered him, &quot;You are the Christ.&quot; — {{bibleverse||Mark|8:29|ESV}}}}
No writings were left by Jesus, and the Christology of the [[Apostolic Age]] is based on the writings of Jesus' [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] and [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]], of which the original 12 had encountered Jesus. The Gospels provide episodes from the life of Jesus and some of his works, but {{bibleverse||John|21:25|ESV|}} states that even the whole world would not have room for the books that could be written about the works of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Gerald3 /&gt;

The Christology of the three [[Synoptic Gospels]] emphasizes the humanity of Jesus, his sayings, his parables, and his miracles. The [[Gospel of John]] provides a different, yet complimentary perspective that focuses on his divinity.&lt;ref name=CathChristology /&gt; The first fourteen verses of the [[Gospel of John]] are devoted to the divinity of Jesus as the [[Logos (Christianity)|logos]], usually translated as ''Word'', along with his [[pre-existence of Christ|preexistence]], and they emphasize the cosmic significance of Christ, e.g. {{bibleverse||John|1:3|ESV}}: &quot;All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.&quot; In the context of these verses, the Word made flesh is identical with the Word who was in the beginning with God, being exegetically equated with Jesus.&lt;ref name=CathChristology /&gt;

A foremost contributor to the Christology of the Apostolic Age is that of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]. The central Christology of Paul conveys the notion of Christ's preexistence and the identification of Christ as [[Kyrios (Biblical term)|''Kyrios'']].&lt;ref name=Aloys &gt;''Christ in Christian Tradition: From the Apostolic Age to Chalcedon' by Aloys Grillmeier, John Bowden 1975 ISBN 066422301X pages 15-19 [http://books.google.com/books?id=LH-cBwmmY2cC&amp;pg=PA15]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pauline epistles]] use ''Kyrios'' to identify Jesus almost 230 times, and express the theme that the true mark of a Christian is the confession of Jesus as the true Lord.&lt;ref name=Gerald142 &gt;''Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus'' by Gerald O'Collins 2009 ISBN 019955787X page 142&lt;/ref&gt; Paul viewed the superiority of the Christian revelation over all other divine manifestations as a consequence of the fact that Christ is the [[Son of God]].&lt;ref name=CathChristology /&gt;

The Pauline epistles also advanced the ''cosmic Christology'' of the fourth gospel, elaborating the cosmic implications of Jesus' existence as the Son of God, as in {{bibleverse||2Corinthians|5:17|ESV}}: &quot;Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.&quot; Also, in {{bibleverse||Colossians|1:15|ESV}}: &quot;He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.&quot;&lt;ref name=Aloys /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jesus page 282&quot;/&gt;

===Post-Apostolic controversies===

Following the [[Apostolic Age]], from the 2nd century onwards, a number of controversies developed about how the human and divine are related within the person of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Editors1999&gt;{{Citation| last = Editors | first =  Erwin Fahlbusch| year = 1999| title = The encyclopedia of Christianity| pages = 463| url = http://books.google.com/?id=z47zgZ75dqgC&amp;pg=PA463&amp;dq=Logos+as+God+in+the+early+church| isbn = 0802824137| publisher = Brill| location = Leiden, Netherland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rausch2003&gt;{{Citation| last = Rausch | first =  Thomas P.| year = 2003| title = Who is Jesus? : an introduction to Christology| pages = 149| url = http://books.google.com/?id=8OJCa6euw5gC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Justin+Martyr+christology| isbn = 0814650783| publisher = Liturgical Press| location = Collegeville, Minn.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2nd century, a number of different and opposing approaches developed among various groups.  For example, [[Arianism]] and [[Ebionites|Ebionitism]] argued that Jesus was an ordinary mortal, while [[Gnosticism]], held [[docetism|docetic]] views which argued that Christ was a spiritual being that only appeared to have a physical body.&lt;ref name=&quot;the_orthodox_corruption_of_scripture_a01&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last1 = Ehrman | first1 = Bart D. | title = The Orthodox corruption of scripture: the effect of early Christological controversies on the text of the New Testament | url = http://books.google.com/?id=NHIBM3p83UcC&amp;pg=PA181 | year = 1993 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York  | isbn = 978-0-19-510279-6 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGrath2007&gt;{{Citation| last = McGrath | first =  Alister E.| year = 2007| title = Christian theology : an introduction| pages = 282| url = http://books.google.com/?id=tHlY94UWi3UC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq=Justin+Martyr+christology| isbn = 1405153601| publisher = Blackwell| location = Malden, Mass. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting tensions lead to [[schism (religion)|schism]]s within the church in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and [[ecumenical councils]] were convened in the 4th and 5th centuries to deal with the issues. Eventually in 451 the ''[[Hypostatic union]]'' was decreed, namely that Jesus is both fully divine and fully human, making this part of the creed of [[Orthodox Christianity]].&lt;ref name=Editors1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rausch2003/&gt; Although some of the debates seemed to be over a theological [[iota]], they took place in controversial political circumstances and resulted in a schism that formed the [[Church of the East]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd series, Vol XIV p207, translated edition by H.R. Percival. http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/ephesus.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Seven Ecumenical Councils of the Undivided Church, trans H. R. Percival, in Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd Series, ed. P. Schaff and H. Wace, (repr. Grand Rapids MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1955), XIV, pp. 192-242&lt;/ref&gt;

In 325 the [[First Council of Nicaea]] defined the persons of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]] and their relationship with one another - decisions which were re-ratified at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381. The language used was that the one God exists in three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit); in particular it was affirmed that the Son was ''[[homoousios]]'' (of same substance) as the Father. The [[Nicene Creed]] declared the full divinity and full humanity of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Kirsch, ''God Against the Gods: The History of the War Between Monotheism and Polytheism'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Freeman, ''The Closing of the Western Mind: The Rise of Faith and the Fall of Reason'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gibbons, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' (1776-88), 21&lt;/ref&gt;

In 431, the [[First Council of Ephesus]] was initially called to address the views of [[Nestorius]] on [[Mariology]], but the problems soon extended to Christology, and schisms followed. The 431 council was called because in defense of his loyal priest Anastasius, Nestorius had denied the ''[[Theotokos|Theotokos title]]'' for [[Virgin Mary|Mary]] and later contradicted [[Proclus]] during a sermon in [[Constantinople]]. Pope [[Celestine I]] (who was already upset with Nestorius due to other matters) wrote about this to [[Cyril of Alexandria]] who orchesterated the council. During the council Nestorius defended his position by arguing that there must be two persons of Christ, one human, the other Divine, and Mary had given birth only to a human and hence could not be called the Theotokos, i.e. ''the one who gives birth to God''. The debate about the single or dual nature of Christ ensued in Ephesus.&lt;ref&gt;''The creed: the apostolic faith in contemporary theology'' by Berard L.

The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] debated [[Hypostatic union|hypostasis]] (co-existing natures) versus [[Monophysitism]] (only one nature) versus [[Miaphysitism]] (two natures united as one) versus [[Nestorianism]] (disunion of two natures). From the Christological viewpoint, the council adopted ''hyposthasis'', i.e. co-existing natures, but its language was less definitive than the 451 Council of Chalcedon. The [[Oriental Orthodox]] rejected this and subsequent councils and to date consider themselves to be ''Miaphysite''.&lt;ref&gt;''Systematic Theology'' by Lewis Sperry Chafer 1993 ISBN 0825423406 pages 382-384 [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZFCoSSKTffcC&amp;pg=PA382&amp;dq=Hypostatic+union&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AVPgTMvlGImU4Abtqvj6Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Hypostatic%20union&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=parry &gt;''The Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity'' by Ken Parry 2009 ISBN 1444333615 page 88 [http://books.google.com/books?id=fWp9JA3aBvcC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=Miaphysitism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sVDgTKqDKpDOswbundTyCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Miaphysitism&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, to date Roman Catholics believe in the [[Hypostatic union]] and the [[Trinity]].

The 451 [[Council of Chalcedon]] was highly influential and marked a key turning point in the Christological debates that broke apart the church of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] in the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;''The acts of the Council of Chalcedon'' by Council of Chalcedon, Richard Price, Michael Gaddis 2006 ISBN 0853230390 pages 1-5 [http://books.google.com/books?id=6IUaOOT1G3UC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=Chalcedon+catholic+anglican+eastern&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ql_gTMj_Lon5sgafnez6Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the last council which many [[Anglican]]s and most [[Protestants]] consider ecumenical.&lt;ref name=Armentrout &gt;''An Episcopal dictionary of the church'' by Donald S.

Most of the major branches of Christianity —[[Roman Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] — subscribe to the Chalcedonian Christological formulation, while many branches of Eastern Christianity - [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian Orthodoxy]], [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian Church]], [[Coptic Orthodoxy]], [[Ethiopian Orthodox]]y, and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolicism]] - reject it.&lt;ref name=Armentrout /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies'' by Orlando O.

==Middle Ages to the Reformation==
[[File:Anselm-CanterburyVit.jpg|thumb|left|171px|The spiritual Christology of [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm]] and his monastic contemporaries led to a view of Jesus as a &quot;helping friend&quot;, as well as the Lord.&lt;ref name=Astley /&gt;]]

While the concept of [[Kyrios]] dominated the Christology of the [[Apostolic Age]], an important supplementary element emerged in the Middle Ages. Based on the influences of [[Anselm of Canterbury]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and women mystics the &quot;tender image of Jesus&quot; as a friend and a source of love and comfort was developed. This contrasted with the images of Jesus as the Lord and as the key to eventual salvation based on his sacrifice at Calvary. The [[Franciscan]] approach to popular piety strengthened this friendly image. According to Archbishop [[Rowan Williams]] this made an important impact within the Christian Ministry by allowing Christians to feel the living presence of Jesus as a loving figure &quot;who is always there to harbor and nurture those who turn to him for help and take delight in his presence&quot;.&lt;ref name=Astley /&gt;&lt;ref name=mini7 &gt;''Christology: Biblical And Historical'' by Mini S. Johnson, 2005 ISBN 81-8324-007-0 pages 74-76 [http://books.google.com/books?id=Aa3yRbs0tisC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=christology+franciscan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=px3jTNHFJc3BswaKu7XnCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=christology%20franciscan&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middle Ages]], between the 5th and 15th centuries, ushered in three new aspects of Christology:  ''monastic'', ''popular'' and ''academic''. The spiritual and monastic perspectives were due to [[Anselm of Canterbury]], [[Peter Abelard]] and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], each focusing on a different variation of that theme. The [[popular piety]] championed by the [[Franciscan]]s led to a more widespread appreciation of Christology from the Middle Ages onwards. At the same time, European Universities embarked on a systematic and scholarly approach to Christology, with [[Thomas Aquinas]] being the key figure in that arena.&lt;ref name=mini7 /&gt;

Some key theological figures in this period such as [[Saint Augustine]] or [[John Calvin]] never wrote specific works on Christology, yet modern scholars have attempted to extract Christological insights from their works, e.g. the study of [[Theocentricism]] in the writings of Augustine and the analysis of Christ as &quot;King, priest and prophet&quot; in the writings of Calvin.&lt;ref&gt;''Orthodox readings of Augustine'' by George E. Demacopoulos, Aristotle Papanikolaou 2008 ISBN 0881413275 page 271&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Calvin's Christology'' by Stephen Edmondson 2004 ISBN 0521541549 page x&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, many of the conflicts between Scripture and tradition were resolved through the construction of theological arguments, and were presented in terms of ''summae'', which summed up complete presentations of discussions that led to knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Christological foundation'' by Joseph D. Ban 1989 ISBN 0865543135 page&lt;/ref&gt; The apex of these in the 13th century, was provided by Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]. His [[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]] presented the first systematic Christology that consistently resolved a number of the existing issues. In his Christology from above, Aquinas also championed the ''[[principle of perfection of Christ]]'', namely that in every human sense, Jesus was the best that could ever be.&lt;ref name=&quot;mini76&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerald208&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Geest&quot;/&gt;

The question of &quot;grace&quot; was at the heart of the Reformation, which [[Martin Luther]] initiated. This amounted to the question of where do I find a gracious God? Luther believed that the saving work of Christ is imputed for the remission of sins via the words of the gospels. This led to his fourfold formula of ''solo Christo'', ''sola gratia'', ''sola fide'', ''sola scriptura'', i.e. only Christ, grace, faith and scripture.&lt;ref&gt;''Christology: Biblical And Historica''l by Mini S. Johnson, 2005 ISBN 81-8324-007-0 pages 80-83&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Luther believed in the Creed of Chalcedon and that Jesus was both God and man. He viewed [[Incarnation]] as the union of God and man.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus the Christ'' by Thomas Gerard Weinandy 2003 ISBN 1931709688 page 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christological issues==
===Person of Christ===
[[File:Christ Pantocrator niche Holy Trinity Meteora.jpg|thumb|[[Christ Pantocrator]], Holy Trinity's monastery, [[Meteora]], Greece.]]
{{Main|Person of Christ}}
{{See also|Trinity|Hypostatic union}}
 
The '''Person of Christ''' refers to the study of the human and divine natures of [[Christ|Jesus Christ]] as they co-exist within one person.&lt;ref name=Erickson &gt;''Introducing Christian Doctrine'' by Millard J. Erickson, L. Arnold Hustad 2001 ISBN page 234&lt;/ref&gt; There are no direct discussion in the [[New Testament]] regarding the [[Hypostatic union|dual nature]] of the Person of Christ as both divine and human.&lt;ref name=Erickson /&gt; Hence, since the early days of Christianity theologians have debated various approaches to the understanding of these natures, at times resulting in schisms.&lt;ref name=Erickson /&gt;

Historically in the Alexandrian school of thought (fashioned on the [[Gospel of John]]) Jesus Christ is the [[Logos (Christianity)|eternal Logos]] who already possesses unity with the Father before the act of [[Incarnation]].&lt;ref name=Waldrop &gt;''Karl Barth's christology'' by Charles T. Waldrop 1985 ISBN 9027931097 pages 19-23&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Antiochian school views Christ as a single, unified human person apart from his relationship to the divine.&lt;ref name=Waldrop /&gt;

[[John Calvin]] maintained that there was no human element in the Person of Christ which could be separated from the person of [[Logos (Christianity)|The Word]].&lt;ref&gt;''Calvin's Christology'' by Stephen Edmondson 2004 ISBN 0521541549 page 217&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin also emphasized the importance of the &quot;Work of Christ&quot; in any attempt at understanding the Person of Christ and cautioned against ignoring the Works of Jesus during his ministry.&lt;ref&gt;''Calvin's First Catechism'' by I. John Hesselink 1997 ISBN 0664227252 page 217&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of the Person of Christ continued into the 20th century, with modern theologians such as [[Karl Rahner]] and [[Hans Urs von Balthasar|Hans von Balthasar]]. Rahner pointed out the coincidence between the Person of Christ and The Word of God, referring to [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#8:38|Mark8:38]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#9:26|Luke 9:26]] which state that whoever is ashamed of the words of Jesus is ashamed of the Lord himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by Karl Rahner 2004 ISBN 0860120066 page 1822&lt;/ref&gt; Balthasar argued that the union of the human and divine natures of Christ was achieved not by the &quot;absorption&quot; of human attributes but by their &quot;assumption&quot;. Thus in his view the divine nature of Christ was not affected by the human attributes and remained forever divine.&lt;ref&gt;''The eschatology of Hans Urs von Balthasar'' by Nicholas J. Healy 2005 ISBN 0199278369 pages 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nativity and the Holy Name===
{{see also|Nativity of Jesus|Holy Name of Jesus}}

The [[Nativity of Jesus]] impacted the Christological issues about his Person from the earliest days of Christianity. Luke's Christology centers on the dialectics of the dual natures of the earthly and heavenly manifestations of existence of the Christ, while Matthew's Christology focuses on the mission of Jesus and his role as the savior.&lt;ref&gt;''Theology of the New Testament'' by Georg Strecker 2000 ISBN 0664223362 pages 401-403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Matthew'' by [[Grant R. Osborne]] 2010 ISBN 0310323703 lxxix&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian soteriology|salvific]] emphasis of [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#1:21|Matthew 1:21]] later impacted the theological issues and the devotions to [[Holy Name of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Matthew 1-13'' by Manlio Simonetti 2001 ISBN 0830814868 page 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 1-2/ Luke 1-2'' by Louise Perrotta 2004 ISBN 0829415416 page 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''All the Doctrines of the Bible'' by Herbert Lockyer 1988 ISBN 0310280516 page 159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#1:23|Matthew 1:23]] provides a key to the ''Emmanuel Christology'' of Matthew. Beginning with 1:23, Matthew shows a clear interest in identifying Jesus as &quot;God with us&quot; and in later developing the Emmanuel characterization of Jesus at key points throughout the rest of his Gospel.&lt;ref name=Kupp &gt;''Matthew's Emmanuel'' by David D. Kupp 1997 ISBN 0521570077 pages 220-224&lt;/ref&gt; The name Emmanuel does not appear elsewhere in the New Testament, but Matthew builds on it in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#28:20|Matthew 28:20]] (&quot;I am with you always, even unto the end of the world&quot;) to indicates that Jesus will be with the faithful to the end of the age.&lt;ref name=Kupp /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kingsbury17 &gt;''Who do you say that I am?: essays on Christology'' by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer 1999 ISBN 0664257526 page 17&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ulrich Luz]], the Emmanuel motif brackets the entire Gospel of Matthew between 1:23 and 28:20, appearing explicitly an dimplicitly in several other passages.&lt;ref&gt;''The theology of the Gospel of Matthew'' by Ulrich Luz 1995 ISBN 0521435765 page 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crucifixion and Resurrection===
{{Main|Crucifixion of Jesus|Resurrection of Jesus|}}
The accounts of the Crucifixion and subsequent [[Resurrection of Jesus]] provides a rich background for Christological analysis, from the Canonical Gospels to the [[Pauline Epistles]].&lt;ref&gt;''Who do you say that I am? Essays on Christology'' by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer 1999 ISBN 0664257526 page 106&lt;/ref&gt;

A central element in the Christology presented in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] is the affirmation of the belief that the death of Jesus by Crucifixion happened &quot;with the foreknowledge of God, according to a definite plan&quot;.&lt;ref name=Matera67  &gt;''New Testament christology'' by Frank J. Matera 1999 ISBN 0664256945 page 67&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, as in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:23|Acts 2:23]], the cross is not viewed as a scandal, for the crucifixion of Jesus &quot;at the hands of the  lawless&quot; is viewed as the fulfilment of the of the plan of God.&lt;ref name=Matera67 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The speeches in Acts: their content, context, and concerns'' by Marion L. Soards 1994 ISBN 0664252214 page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul's Christology has a specific focus on the death and resurrection of Jesus. For Paul, the Crucifixion of Jesus is directly related to his resurrection and the term &quot;the cross of Christ&quot; used in Galatians 6:12 may be viewed as his abbreviation of the message of the gospels.&lt;ref name=Schwarz132 &gt;''Christology'' by Hans Schwarz 1998 ISBN 0802844634 pages 132-134&lt;/ref&gt; For Paul, the Crucifixion of Jesus was not an isolated event in history, but a cosmic event with significant [[eschatological]] consequences, as in Cor 2:8.&lt;ref name=Schwarz132 /&gt; In the Pauline view, Jesus, obedient to the point of death (Phil 2:8), died &quot;at the right time&quot; (Rom 4:25) based on the plan of God.&lt;ref name=Schwarz132 /&gt; For Paul the &quot;power of the cross&quot; is not separable from the Resurrection of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Schwarz132 /&gt;

===Threefold office===
{{Main|threefold office}}

The [[threefold office]] (Latin ''munus triplex'') of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] is a [[Christian]] doctrine based upon the teachings of the Old Testament. It was described by [[Eusebius]] and more fully developed by [[John Calvin]]. It states that Jesus [[Christ]] performed three functions (or &quot;offices&quot;) in his earthly ministry - those of [[prophet]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2018:14-22;&amp;version=31; Deuteronomy 18:14-22]), [[priest]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20110:1-4;&amp;version=31; Psalm 110:1-4]), and [[kingly office of Christ|king]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%202;&amp;version=31; Psalm 2])  In the Old Testament, the appointment of someone to any of these three positions could be indicated by anointing him or her by pouring oil over the head.  Thus the term messiah, meaning &quot;anointed one&quot;, is associated with the concept of the threefold office. While the office of king is that most frequently associated with the Messiah, the role of Jesus as priest is also prominent in the New Testament, being most fully explained in chapters 7 to 10 of the [[Book of Hebrews]].

===Mariology===
{{main|Roman Catholic Mariology}}
Some Christians, notably [[RCTerm|Roman Catholics]], view [[Mariology]] as a key component of Christology.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mariology Is Christology&quot;, in [[Vittorio Messori]], ''The Mary Hypothesis'', Rome: 2005. [http://www.zenit.org/article-14658?l=english]&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, not only is Mariology a logical and necessary consequence of Christology, but without it, Christology is incomplete since the figure of Mary contributes to a fuller understanding of who Christ is and what he did.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Haffner, 2004 ''The mystery of Mary'' Gracewing Press ISBN 0852446500 page 17&lt;/ref&gt; Some other Christians, such as the Protestants, do not agree with this view.

[[Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger]] (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) expressed this sentiment about [[Roman Catholic Mariology]] when in two separate occasions he stated: &quot;The appearance of a truly Marian awareness serves as the touchstone indicating whether or not the Christological substance is fully present&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Communio]], 1996, Volume 23, page 175&lt;/ref&gt; and that &quot;It is necessary to go back to Mary, if we want to return to the truth about Jesus Christ&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Burke, 2008 ''Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, seminarians, and Consecrated Persons'' ISBN 1579183557 page xxi&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}

In legal terminology, a '''complaint''' is a formal legal document that sets out the facts and legal reasons (see: [[cause of action]]) that the [[Filing (legal)|filing]] party or parties (the [[plaintiff]](s)) believes are sufficient to support a claim against the party or parties against whom the claim is brought (the [[defendant]](s)) that entitles the plaintiff(s) to a [[Legal remedy|remedy]] (either [[money damages]] or [[injunctive relief]]).  For example, the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] that govern civil litigation in [[United States]] courts provide that a civil action is commenced with the filing or service of a pleading called a complaint. Civil court rules in states that have incorporated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure use the same term for the same pleading.

In some jurisdictions, specific types of criminal cases may also be commenced by the filing of a complaint, also sometimes called a '''criminal complaint''' or '''felony complaint'''. All criminal cases are prosecuted in the name of the governmental authority that promulgates criminal statutes and enforces the [[police power]] of the state with the goal of seeking criminal [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]], such as the State (also sometimes called the People) or Crown (in [[Commonwealth realm]]s). In the United States, the complaint is often associated with misdemeanor criminal charges presented by the prosecutor without the grand jury process. In most U.S. jurisdictions, the charging instrument presented to and authorized by a [[grand jury]] is referred to as an [[indictment]].

==United States==
Virtually every U.S. state has some forms available on [[World Wide Web|web]] for most common complaints for [[lawyer]]s and [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|self-representing]] litigants, if petitioner cannot find appropriate form in his state, he often can modify a form from another state to fit his request. Also, several [[United States federal courts]] published general guidelines for the petitioners and [[civil liberties|Civil Rights]] complaint forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/forms/prose_guide.pdf|title=Pro Se Litigant Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=utah&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/forms/civilrt_guide.pdf|title=Civil Rights Complaint Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmcourt.fed.us/web/DCDOCS/dcindex.html|title=Pro Se Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the complaint has been filed, it has to be [[Service of process|properly served]] to the opposite parties, but usually petitioners not allowed to serve the complaint personally.&lt;ref name=&quot;rule4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule4_1.htm|title=Federal Rules of Civil Procedure - Rule 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants have limited time to respond, depending on the State or Federal rules. Defendant's failure to answer to a complaint can result in a [[default judgment]] in favor of the petitioner. 

For example, in [[United States federal courts]] any person who is at least 18 years old and not a party may serve a [[summons]] and complaint in a civil case.&lt;ref name=&quot;rule4&quot; /&gt; The defendant must submit an answer within 21 days after being served with the summons and complaint, or request a [[waiver]], according to [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|FRCP]] Rule 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule12.htm|title=Federal Rules of Civil Procedure}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the civil complaint was served to the defendants, [[plaintiff]] must as soon as practicable [[Initial Conference (Law)|initiate a conference]] between the parties to plan for the rest of the [[Discovery (law)|discovery process]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rule26&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule26.htm|title=FRCP Rule 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many U.S. jurisdictions, a complaint submitted to a court must be accompanied by a [[Case Information Statement]], which sets forth specific key information about the case and the [[lawyer]]s representing the [[Party (law)|parties]]. This allows the judge to make determinations about which deadlines to set for different phases of the case, as it moves through the court system.  

There are also freely accessible [[web search engine]]s to assist parties in finding court decisions that can be cited in the complaint as an example or analogy to resolve similar questions of law.&lt;ref name=&quot;goog_sch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholar.google.com/advanced_scholar_search|title=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google Scholar]] is the biggest database of full text state and federal courts decisions that can be accessed without charge.&lt;ref name=&quot;goog_sch&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlib.org/dlib/september05/bauer/09bauer.html|title=An Examination of Citation Counts in a New Scholarly Communication Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[web search engine]]s often allows to select specific state courts to search.&lt;ref name=&quot;goog_sch&quot; /&gt;

Also, Federal Courts created [[PACER (law)|Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER)]] system that to obtain case and [[Docket (court)|docket]] information from the [[United States district court]]s, [[United States court of appeals|United States courts of appeals]], and [[United States bankruptcy court]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pacer&quot; /&gt; The system is managed by the [[Administrative Office of the United States Courts]], it allows lawyers and self-represented clients to obtain documents entered in the case much faster then regular mail.&lt;ref name=&quot;pacer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacer.gov/|title=PACER}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia and United Kingdom==
In some countries, (for example [[Ombudsmen in Australia|Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fido.gov.au/fido/fido.nsf/byheadline/Financial+services+complaints+schemes?openDocument|title=Australian Approved Complaint Services|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Kingdom|UK]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/alia|title=Financial Ombudsman - UK|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many countries of the [[European Community]]), the making of [[consumer complaint]]s, particularly regarding the sale of financial services, is governed by [[statute]]. The statutory authority may require companies to reply to complaints within set time limits, publish written procedures for handling customer dissatisfaction and provide information about arbitration schemes.

'''Casimir III the Great''' ({{lang-pl|Kazimierz Wielki}}) (30 April 1310 – 5 November 1370), last [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]] from the [[Piast dynasty]] (reigned 1333–1370), was the son of King [[Władysław I the Elbow-high]] and [[Hedwig of Kalisz]].

* Also known as the Peasants' King.''

==Biography==
Born in [[Kowal]], Casimir the Great first married Anna, or [[Aldona of Lithuania|Aldona Ona]], the daughter of the prince of [[Lithuania]], [[Gediminas]]. The daughters from this marriage were Cunigunde (d 1357), who was married to [[Louis VI the Roman]], the son of [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], and Elisabeth, who was married to Duke [[Bogislaw V|Bogislaus V of Pomerania]].
Aldona died in 1339 and Kazimierz then married [[Adelaide of Hesse]]. He divorced Adelheid in 1356, married Christina, divorced her, and while Adelaide and possibly also Christina were still alive (ca. 1365) married Hedwig (Jadwiga) of Głogów and Sagan.

His three daughters by his fourth wife were very young and regarded as of dubious legitimacy because of their father's bigamy. Because all of the five children he fathered with his first and fourth wife were daughters, he would have no lawful male heir to his throne.

When Casimir, the last [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] king of Poland, died in 1370, his nephew King [[Louis I of Hungary]] succeeded him to become king of Poland in personal union with [[Hungary]].

===The Great King===
Casimir is the only Polish king who both received and kept the title of ''Great'' in Polish history ([[Boleslaw I Chrobry]] is also called ''the Great'', but his title Chrobry (Valiant) is now more common). When he received the crown, his hold on it was in danger, as even his neighbours did not recognise his title and instead called him &quot;king of [[Kraków]]&quot;. The [[economic system|economy]] was ruined, and the country was depopulated and exhausted by war. Upon his death, he left a country doubled in size (mostly through the addition of land in today's [[Ukraine]], then the Duchy of [[Halicz]]), prosperous, wealthy and with great prospects for the future. Although he is depicted as a peaceful king in children's books, he in fact waged many victorious wars and was readying for others just before he died.

Casimir the Great built many new [[castle]]s, reformed the Polish [[army]] and Polish [[Civil law (private law)|civil]] and [[criminal law]]. At the [[Sejm]] in [[Wiślica]],  11 March 1347, he introduced salutary legal reforms in the jurisprudence of his country. He sanctioned a code of laws for Great and Lesser Poland, which gained for him the title of &quot;the Polish Justinian&quot; and founded the [[University of Kraków]] which is the oldest Polish university, although his death temporarily stalled the university's development (which is why it is today called the &quot;Jagiellonian&quot; rather than &quot;Casimirian&quot; University).

He organized a [[Congress of Kraków|meeting of kings at Kraków]] (1364) in which he exhibited the wealth of the Polish kingdom.

===Concession to the nobility===
[[Image:Wiec Kazimierz Wielki.jpg|thumb|right|14th-century ''[[Demonstration (people)|rally]]'', in the reign of Casimir the Great]]

In order to enlist the support of the [[szlachta|nobility]], especially the military help of [[pospolite ruszenie]], Casimir was forced to give up important privileges to their caste, which made them finally clearly dominant over townsfolk ([[Bourgeoisie|burghers]] or ''mieszczaństwo'').

In 1335, in the [[Treaty of Trentschin]], Kazimierz relinquished &quot;in perpetuity&quot; his claims to [[Silesia]]. In 1355 in [[Buda]], Casimir designated [[Louis I of Hungary]] as his successor. In exchange, the szlachta's tax burden was reduced and they would no longer be required to pay for military expeditions expenses outside Poland. Those important concessions would eventually lead to the ultimately crippling rise of the unique [[Nobles' Democracy|nobles' democracy]] in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

His second daughter, [[Elisabeth of Poland (1326–1361)|Elisabeth, Duchess of Pomerania]], bore a son in 1351, [[Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania|Casimir IV of Pomerania]]. He was slated to become the heir, but did not succeed to the throne, dying childless in 1377, 7 years after King Casimir. He was the only male descendant of King Casimir who lived during his lifetime.

[[Image:Subdue of Ruthenia in 1366 .png|thumb|left|Subjection of [[Galicia-Volhynia|Ruthenia]] by the [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom]] in 1366 by 19th century painter, [[Jan Matejko]]]]

Also, his son-in-law [[Louis VI the Roman]] of Bavaria, [[Margrave]] and [[Prince-elector]] of [[Brandenburg]], was thought as a possible successor as king of Poland. However, he was not deemed eligible as his wife, Casimir's daughter Cunigunde, had died already in 1357, without children.

The Poles repulsed many raids of the [[Tatar]]-[[Mongol]]s. However, Casimir III the Great submitted to the [[Golden Horde]] and undertook to pay tribute in order to avoid more conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;CICO-X, pp.189&lt;/ref&gt; The 7 Mongol princes were sent by [[Jani Beg]] khan to assist Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jackson-the Mongols and the West, p.211&lt;/ref&gt;

Casimir had no legitimate sons. Apparently, he deemed his own descendants either unsuitable or too young to inherit. Thus, and in order to provide a clear line of succession and avoid dynastic uncertainty, he arranged for his nephew, King Louis I of Hungary, to be his successor in Poland. Louis was proclaimed king on Casimir's death in 1370, and Casimir's sister Elisabeth (Louis's mother) held much of the real power until her death in 1380.

===Relationship with Polish Jews===
[[Image:Wojciech Gerson-Kazimierz Wielki.jpg|thumb|[[Wojciech Gerson]], ''Casimir the Great and Jews'']]

King Casimir was favorably disposed toward [[Jew]]s. On 9 October 1334, he confirmed the privileges granted to Jewish Poles in 1264 by [[Bolesław V the Chaste]]. Under [[penalty of death]], he prohibited the kidnapping of Jewish children for the purpose of enforced [[Christianity|Christian]] [[baptism]]. He inflicted heavy punishment for the desecration of [[Jewish]] [[cemeteries]].

Although Jews had lived in Poland since before the reign of King Casimir, he allowed them to settle in Poland in great numbers and protected them as ''people of the king''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=In Poland, a Jewish Revival Thrives—Minus Jews |url= |quote=Probably about 70 percent of the world's European Jews, or Ashkenazi, can trace their ancestry to Poland—thanks to a 14th-century king, Casimir III, the Great, who drew Jewish settlers from across Europe with his vow to protect them as &quot;people of the king.&quot; |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date= 12 July 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships and children===
====Aldona of Lithuania====
On 30 April or 16 October 1325, Casimir married [[Aldona of Lithuania]]. She was a daughter of [[Gediminas of Lithuania]] and [[Jewna]]. They had two children:

*[[Elisabeth of Poland (1326-1361)|Elisabeth of Poland]] (ca. 1326–1361). She married [[Bogusław V, Duke of Pomerania]].
*[[Cunigunde of Poland]] (1334–1357). Married [[Louis VI the Roman]].

Aldona died on 26 May 1339. Casimir remained a widower for two years.

====Adelheid of Hesse====
On 29 September 1341, Casimir married his second wife [[Adelheid of Hesse]]. She was a daughter of [[Henry II, Landgrave of Hesse]] and Elisabeth of Meissen. Her maternal grandparents were [[Frederick I, Margrave of Meissen]] and his second wife [[Elizabeth of Lobdeburg-Arnshaugk]]. They had no children.

Casimir started living separately from Adelheid soon after their marriage. Their loveless marriage lasted until 1356.

====Christina====
Casimir effectively divorced Adelheid and married his mistress [[Christina Rokiczana|Christina]]. Christina was the widow of Miklusz Rokiczani, a wealthy merchant. Her own origins are unknown. Following the death of her first husband she had entered the court of [[Bohemia]] in [[Prague]] as a [[lady-in-waiting]]. Casimir brought her with him from Prague and convinced the abbot of the [[Benedictine]] [[abbey]] of [[Tyniec]] to marry them. The marriage was held in a secret ceremony but soon became known. Adelheid renounced it as [[Polygamy|bigamous]] and returned to Hesse without permission.

Casimir continued living with Christine despite complains by [[Pope Innocent VI]] on behalf of Adelheid. The marriage lasted until 1363/1364 when Casimir again declared himself divorced. They had no children.

====Jadwiga of Żagań====
In about 1365, Casimir married his fourth wife Hedwig of Żagań. She was a daughter of [[Henry V of Iron]], Duke of [[Żagań]] and Anna of Mazovia. They had three children:

*[[Anna of Poland, Countess of Celje]] (1366 – 9 June 1422). Married firstly [[William of Celje]]. Their only daughter was [[Anne of Cilli]]. Married secondly Ulrich, [[Duke of Teck]]. They had no children.
*Kunigunde of Poland (1367–1370).
*Hedwig of Poland (1368 – ca. 1407). Reportedly married ca. 1382 but the details are obscure.

With Adelheid still alive and Christine possibly surviving, the marriage to Hedwig was also considered bigamous. The legitimacy of the three last daughters was disputed. Casimir managed to have Anne and Cunigunde legitimated by [[Pope Urban V]] on 5 December 1369. Hedwig the younger was legitimated by [[Pope Gregory XI]] on 11 October 1371.

====Cudka====
Casimir also had three illegitimate sons by his mistress Cudka, wife of a [[castellan]].
*Niemierz (last mentioned alive in 1386). Oldest son. Survived his father, inherited lands around [[Stopnica]].
*Pelka (1342–1365). Married and had two sons. Predeceased his father.
*Jan (d. 28 October 1383). Youngest son. Survived his father, inherited lands around Stopnica.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{other uses|Complexity (disambiguation)}}
In general usage, '''complexity''' tends to be used to characterize something with many parts in intricate arrangement. The study of these complex linkages is the main goal of [[network theory]] and [[network science]]. In [[science]]&lt;ref&gt;[[J. M. Zayed, N. Nouvel, U. Rauwald, O. A. Scherman]], Chemical Complexity – supramolecular self-assembly of synthetic and biological building blocks in water, Chemical Society Reviews, 2010, 39, 2806–2816 http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2010/CS/b922348g&lt;/ref&gt; there are at this time a number of approaches to characterizing complexity, many of which are reflected in this article. In a business context, [[complexity management]] is the methodology to minimize value-destroying complexity and efficiently control value-adding complexity in a cross-functional approach.
[[File:complexity-map castellani.jpg|thumb|800px|right|A map of many of the leading scholars and areas of research in complexity science]]

== Overview ==

Definitions are  often tied to the concept of a &quot;[[system]]&quot;—a set of parts or elements that have relationships among them differentiated from relationships with other elements outside the relational regime. Many definitions tend to postulate or assume that complexity expresses a condition of numerous elements in a system and numerous forms of relationships among the elements. At the same time, what is complex and what is simple is relative and changes with time.

Some definitions key on the question of the probability of encountering a given condition of a system once characteristics of the system are specified. [[Warren Weaver]] has posited that the complexity of a particular [[system]] is the degree of difficulty in predicting the properties of the system, if the properties of the system's parts are given. In Weaver's view, complexity comes in two forms: disorganized complexity, and organized complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

The approaches that embody concepts of systems, multiple elements, multiple relational regimes, and state spaces might be summarized as implying that complexity arises from the number of distinguishable relational regimes (and their associated state spaces) in a defined system.

Some definitions relate to the algorithmic basis for the expression of a complex phenomenon or model or mathematical expression, as is later set out herein.

== Disorganized complexity vs. organized complexity ==
One of the problems in addressing complexity issues has been distinguishing conceptually between the large number of variances in relationships extant in random collections, and the sometimes large, but smaller, number of relationships between elements in systems where constraints (related to correlation of otherwise independent elements) simultaneously reduce the variations from element independence and create distinguishable regimes of more-uniform, or correlated, relationships, or interactions.

Weaver perceived and addressed this problem, in at least a preliminary way, in drawing a distinction between &quot;disorganized complexity&quot; and &quot;organized complexity&quot;.

In Weaver's view, disorganized complexity results from the particular system having a very large number of parts, say millions of parts, or many more. Though the interactions of the parts in a &quot;disorganized complexity&quot; situation can be seen as largely random, the properties of the system as a whole can be understood by using probability and statistical methods.

A prime example of disorganized complexity is a gas in a container, with the gas molecules as the parts. Some would suggest that a system of disorganized complexity may be compared, for example, with the (relative) [[simplicity]] of the planetary orbits—the latter can be known by applying [[Newton's laws of motion]], though this example involved highly correlated events.

Organized complexity, in Weaver's view, resides in nothing else than the non-random, or correlated, interaction between the parts. These correlated relationships create a differentiated structure that can, as a system, interact with other systems. The coordinated system manifests properties not carried by, or dictated by, individual parts. The organized aspect of this form of complexity vis a vis other systems than the subject system can be said to [[emergence|&quot;emerge,&quot;]] without any &quot;guiding hand&quot;.

The number of parts does not have to be very large for a particular system to have emergent properties. A system of organized complexity may be understood in its properties (behavior among the properties) through [[model (abstract)|modeling]] and [[simulation]], particularly [[computer simulation|modeling and simulation with computers]]. An example of organized complexity is a city neighborhood as a living mechanism, with the neighborhood people among the system's parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources and factors of complexity ==
The source of disorganized complexity is the large number of parts in the system of interest, and the lack of correlation between elements in the system.

There is no consensus at present on general rules regarding the sources of organized complexity, though the lack of randomness implies correlations between elements. See e.g. [[Robert Ulanowicz]]'s treatment of ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Ulanowicz, Robert, &quot;Ecology, the Ascendant Perspective&quot;, Columbia, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with prior statements here, the number of parts (and types of parts) in the system and the number of relations between the parts would have to be non-trivial—however, there is no general rule to separate &quot;trivial&quot; from &quot;non-trivial&quot;.

Complexity of an object or system is a relative property. For instance, for many functions (problems), such a computational complexity as time of computation is smaller when multitape [[Turing machine]]s are used than when [[Turing machine]]s with one tape are used. [[Random Access Machine]]s allow one to even more decrease time complexity (Greenlaw and Hoover 1998: 226), while inductive Turing machines can decrease even the complexity class of a function, language or set (Burgin 2005). This shows that tools of activity can be an important factor of complexity.

== Specific meanings of complexity ==
In several scientific fields, &quot;complexity&quot; has a specific meaning :

* In [[computational complexity theory]], the [[Computational resource|amounts of resources]] required for the execution of [[algorithm]]s is studied. The most popular types of computational complexity are the time complexity of a problem equal to the number of steps that it takes to solve an instance of the problem as a function of the [[problem size|size of the input]] (usually measured in bits), using the most efficient [[algorithm]], and the space complexity of a problem equal to the volume of the [[computer storage|memory]] used by the algorithm (e.g., cells of the tape) that it takes to solve an instance of the problem as a function of the [[problem size|size of the input]] (usually measured in bits), using the most efficient [[algorithm]]. This allows to classify computational problems by [[complexity class]] (such as [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP]] ... ). An axiomatic approach to [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] was developed by [[Manuel Blum]]. It allows one to deduce many properties of concrete computational complexity measures, such as time complexity or space complexity, from properties of axiomatically defined measures.

* In [[algorithmic information theory]], the ''[[Kolmogorov complexity]]'' (also called ''descriptive complexity'', ''algorithmic complexity'' or ''algorithmic entropy'') of a [[string (computer science)|string]] is the length of the shortest binary [[computer program|program]] that outputs that string. Different kinds of Kolmogorov complexity are studied: the uniform complexity, prefix complexity, monotone complexity, time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, and space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. An axiomatic approach to [[Kolmogorov complexity]] based on [[Blum axioms]] (Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in the paper presented for publication by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] (Burgin 1982). The axiomatic approach encompasses other approaches to [[Kolmogorov complexity]]. It is possible to treat different kinds of [[Kolmogorov complexity]] as particular cases of axiomatically defined generalized [[Kolmogorov complexity]]. Instead, of proving similar theorems, such as the basic invariance theorem, for each particular measure, it is possible to easily deduce all such results from one corresponding theorem proved in the axiomatic setting. This is a general advantage of the axiomatic approach in mathematics. The axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity was further developed in the book (Burgin 2005) and applied to software metrics (Burgin and Debnath, 2003; Debnath and Burgin, 2003).

* In [[information processing]], complexity is a measure of the total number of [[property|properties]] transmitted by an object and detected by an [[observation|observer]]. Such a collection of properties is often referred to as a [[state (computer science)|state]].

* In business, complexity describes the variances and their consequences in various fields such as product portfolio, technologies, markets and market segments, locations, manufacturing network, customer portfolio, IT systems, organization, processes etc.

* In [[physical systems]], complexity is a measure of the [[probability]] of the [[state vector]] of the [[system]]. This should not be confused with [[entropy (disambiguation)|entropy]]; it is a distinct mathematical measure, one in which two distinct states are never conflated and considered equal, as is done for the notion of entropy [[statistical mechanics]].

* In [[mathematics]], [[Krohn-Rhodes complexity]] is an important topic in the study of finite [[semigroup]]s and [[automata theory|automata]].

* In [[software engineering]], [[programming complexity]] is a measure of the interactions of the various elements of the software. This differs from the computational complexity described above in that it is a measure of the design of the software.

There are different specific forms of complexity:

* In the sense of how complicated a problem is from the perspective of the person trying to solve it, limits of complexity are measured using a term from [[cognitive psychology]], namely the [[hrair limit]].

* [[Complex adaptive system]] denotes systems that have some or all of the following attributes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
**The number of parts (and types of parts) in the system and the number of relations between the parts is non-trivial – however, there is no general rule to separate &quot;trivial&quot; from &quot;non-trivial&quot;;
**The system has memory or includes [[feedback]];
**The system can adapt itself according to its history or feedback;
**The relations between the system and its environment are non-trivial or non-linear;
**The system can be influenced by, or can adapt itself to, its environment; and
**The system is highly sensitive to initial conditions.

== Study of complexity ==
Complexity has always been a part of our environment, and therefore many [[science|scientific]] fields have dealt with complex systems and phenomena. From one perspective, that which is somehow complex-—displaying variation without being [[randomness|random]]—-is most worthy of interest given the rewards found in the depths of exploration. 

The use of the term complex is often confused with the term complicated. In today's systems, this is the difference between myriad connecting &quot;stovepipes&quot; and effective &quot;integrated&quot; solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Lissack, Michael R.; Johan Roos (2000). The Next Common Sense, The e-Manager's Guide to Mastering Complexity. Intercultural Press. ISBN 9781857882353.
&lt;/ref&gt; This means that complex is the opposite of independent, while complicated is the opposite of simple.

While this has led some fields to come up with specific definitions of complexity, there is a more recent movement to regroup observations [[interdisciplinarity|from different fields]] to study complexity in itself, whether it appears in [[anthill]]s, [[human brain]]s, or [[stock market]]s. One such interdisciplinary group of fields is [[relational order theories]].

== Complexity topics ==
=== Complex behaviour ===
The behavior of a complex system is often said to be due to [[emergence]] and [[self-organization]]. [[Chaos theory]] has investigated the sensitivity of systems to variations in initial conditions as one cause of complex behaviour.

=== Complex mechanisms ===
Recent developments around [[artificial life]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithm]]s have led to an increasing emphasis on complexity and [[complex adaptive systems]].

=== Complex simulations ===
In [[social science]], the study on the emergence of macro-properties from the micro-properties, also known as macro-micro view in [[sociology]]. The topic is commonly recognized as [[social complexity]] that is often related to the use of [[computer simulation]] in social science, i.e.: [[computational sociology]].

=== Complex systems ===
{{main|Complex system}}
[[Systems theory]] has long been concerned with the study of [[complex system]]s (In recent times, ''complexity theory'' and ''complex systems'' have also been used as names of the field). These [[system]]s can be [[Biology|biological]], [[economic]], [[technology|technological]], etc. Recently, complexity is a natural domain of interest of the real world socio-cognitive systems and emerging [[systemics]] research. Complex systems tend to be high-[[dimension]]al,  [[non-linearity|non-linear]] and hard to model. In specific circumstances they may exhibit low dimensional behaviour.

=== Complexity in data ===
In [[information theory]], [[algorithmic information theory]] is concerned with the complexity of [[string (computer science)|strings]] of data.

Complex strings are harder to compress. While intuition tells us that this may depend on the [[codec]] used to compress a string (a codec could be theoretically created in any arbitrary language, including one in which the very small command &quot;X&quot; could cause the computer to output a very complicated string like &quot;18995316&quot;), any two [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] languages can be implemented in each other, meaning that the length of two encodings in different languages will vary by at most the length of the &quot;translation&quot; language—which will end up being negligible for sufficiently large data strings.

These algorithmic measures of complexity tend to assign high values to [[signal noise|random noise]]. However, those studying complex systems would not consider [[randomness]] as complexity.

[[Information entropy]] is also sometimes used in information theory as indicative of complexity.

== Applications of complexity ==
[[Computational complexity theory]] is the study of the complexity of problems—that is, the difficulty of [[problem solving|solving]] them. Problems can be classified by [[complexity class]] according to the time it takes for an [[algorithm]]—usually a computer program—to solve them as a function of the [[problem size]]. Some problems are difficult to solve, while others are easy. For example, some difficult problems need algorithms that take an exponential amount of time in terms of the size of the problem to solve. Take the [[travelling salesman problem]], for example. It can be solved in time &lt;math&gt;O(n^2 2^n)&lt;/math&gt; (where ''n'' is the size of the network to visit—let's say the number of cities the travelling salesman must visit exactly once). As the size of the network of cities grows, the time needed to find the route grows (more than) exponentially.

Even though a problem may be computationally solvable in principle, in actual practice it may not be that simple. These problems might require large amounts of time or an inordinate amount of space. [[Computational complexity]] may be approached from many different aspects. [[Computational complexity]] can be investigated on the basis of time, memory or other resources used to solve the problem. Time and space are two of the most important and popular considerations when problems of complexity are analyzed.

There exist a certain class of problems that although they are solvable in principle they require so much time or space that it is not practical to attempt to solve them. These problems are called [[Computational complexity theory#Intractability|intractable]].

There is another form of complexity called [[Model of Hierarchical Complexity|hierarchical complexity]]. It is orthogonal to the forms of complexity discussed so far, which are called horizontal complexity

Bejan and Lorente showed that complexity is modest (not maximum, not increasing), and is a feature of the natural phenomenon of design generation in nature, which is predicted by the [[Constructal law]]. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.constructal.org/en/art/Phil.%20Trans.%20R.%20Soc.%20B%20%282010%29%20365,%201335%961347.pdf] Bejan A., Lorente S., The Constructal Law of Design and Evolution in Nature. ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, Biological Science'', Vol. 365, 2010, pp. 1335-1347.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bejan and Lorente also showed that all the optimality (max,min) statements have limited ad-hoc applicability, and are unified under the Constructal law of design and evolution in nature. &lt;ref&gt; Lorente S., Bejan A. (2010). Few Large and Many Small: Hierarchy in Movement on Earth, ''International Journal of Design of Nature and Ecodynamics'', Vol. 5, No. 3, pp. 254-267.''&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Kim S., Lorente S., Bejan A., Milter W., Morse J.

[[Image:Hans-Memling-allegory-chastity.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Allegory]] of chastity by [[Hans Memling]]]]
'''Chastity''' refers to the [[sexual behavior]] of a man or woman acceptable to the [[morals|moral]] standards and guidelines of a culture, civilization, or [[religion]].

In the western world, the term has become closely associated (and is often used interchangeably) with [[sexual abstinence]], especially [[Pre-marital sex|before marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chastity&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term remains applicable to persons in all states, single or married, clerical or lay, and has implications beyond sexual temperance.

== Etymology ==
The words &quot;chaste&quot; and &quot;chastity&quot; stem from the [[Latin]] adjective ''castus'' meaning &quot;pure&quot;. The words entered the English language around the middle of the 13th century; at that time they meant slightly different things. &quot;Chaste&quot; meant &quot;virtuous or pure from unlawful sexual intercourse&quot; (referring to [[extramarital sex]]),&lt;ref name=etymonlineChaste&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chaste Chaste at etymonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=podDictEtym&gt;[http://podictionary.com/?p=605 podictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
while &quot;chastity&quot; meant &quot;virginity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;podDictEtym&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=chastity Chastity at etymonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 16th century that the two words came to have the same basic meaning as a related adjective and noun.&lt;ref name=&quot;etymonlineChaste&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;podDictEtym&quot; /&gt;

== In Abrahamic religions ==
{{POV-section|date=January 2011}}
In Jewish, Christian and Islamic religious beliefs, acts of sexual nature are restricted to the context of marriage. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} For unmarried persons therefore, chastity is identified with [[sexual abstinence]]. Sexual acts outside or apart from marriage, such as [[adultery]], [[fornication]] and [[prostitution]], are considered [[sin]]ful.

In the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition, chastity is synonymous with sexual purity. Those who are chaste are morally clean in their thoughts, words, and actions. Chastity means not having any sexual relations before marriage. It also means complete fidelity to husband or wife during marriage.

In [[Catholic]] morality, chastity is placed opposite the [[Seven deadly sins|deadly sin]] of [[lust]], and is classified as one of [[seven virtues]].  The moderation of sexual desires is required to be virtuous.  Reason, will and desire can harmoniously work together to do what is good.

In the context of [[marriage]], the spouses commit to a lifelong relationship which excludes the possibility of sexual intimacy with other persons. Chastity therefore requires marital fidelity. Within marriage, various Abrahamic religions consider several practices to be considered unchaste, such as: sexual intimacy during or shortly after [[menstrual cycle|menstruation]] or [[childbirth]].(see [[Leviticus]] 12:2, 15:24, 20:18)

After marriage, a third form of chastity, often called &quot;vidual chastity&quot;, is expected of a woman while she is in mourning for her late husband.  For example, [[Jeremy Taylor]] defined 5 rules in ''[[Holy Living]]'' (1650), including abstaining from marrying &quot;so long as she is with child by her former husband&quot; and &quot;within the year of mourning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Holy Living |chapter = Chapter II, Section III, Of Chastity | author = [[Jeremy Taylor]] | year = 1650 | url = http://www.anglicanlibrary.org/taylor/holyliving/index.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The particular ethical system may not prescribe each of these. For example, within the scope of [[Christianity|Christian]] ethic, [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] view sex within marriage as chaste, but prohibit the use of artificial contraception as an offense against chastity, seeing contraception as contrary to God's will and design of human sexuality. Many [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] communities allow for artificial contraception, seeing the restriction of family size as possibly not contrary to God's will. A stricter view is held by the [[Shakers]], who prohibit marriage (and indeed [[sexual intercourse]] under any circumstances) as a violation of chastity.

The Roman Catholic Church, has set up various rules regarding [[clerical celibacy]], while some Protestant communities, such as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and Anglican traditions, allow clergy to marry or even favour it.

In Christian traditions, celibacy is required of [[Monasticism|monastic]]s—monks, nuns and friars—even in a rare system of [[double cloister]]s, in which husbands could enter the (men's) monastery while their wives entered a (women's) sister monastery. Celibacy among the clergy is a relavtively recent invention: it only became Church policy at the Second General Church Council (Lateran) in 1139. It was not strictly enforced among the clergy until 200 years later. &lt;ref&gt;Diarmaid MacCulloch, 'Reformation', Penguin Books, 2003, pg 28&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vows of chastity'' can also be taken by laypersons, either as part of an organised religious life (such as Roman Catholic [[Beguines and Beghards]]) or on an individual basis, as a voluntary act of devotion and/or as part of an ascetic lifestyle, often devoted to [[contemplation]].  The voluntary aspect has led it to being included among the [[counsels of perfection]].

Chastity (the state and practise of sexual abstinence outside of [[marriage]]) is a central and pivotal concept in Christian [[Christian theological praxis|praxis]]. Chastity's importance in traditional Christian teaching stems from the fact that it is regarded as essential in maintaining and cultivating the unity of body with spirit and thus the integrity of the human being.&lt;ref&gt;Cathechism of the Catholic Church, 1999, Geoffrey Chapman, p.500&lt;/ref&gt; It is also regarded as fundamental to the practise of the Christian life because it involves an ''apprenticeship in self-mastery''.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid'' p.501&lt;/ref&gt; By attaining mastery over one's passions, reason, will and desire can harmoniously work together to do what is good. Chastity is classified as one of [[seven virtues]].

== Eastern religions ==
''Hinduism:'' [[Hinduism]]'s view on premarital sex is rooted in its concept of the stages of [[life]]. The first of these stages, known as ''[[brahmacharya]],'' roughly translates as chastity. Celibacy is considered the appropriate behavior for both [[male]] and [[female]] [[students]] during this stage, which precedes the stage of the married householder. Many [[Sadhus]] (Hindu monks) are also celibate as part of their [[asceticism|ascetic]] discipline. In classical Hinduism, sexual intercourse was seen as a sacred act of procreation- within marriage.

''Jainism:'' Although the [[Digambara]] followers of [[Jainism]] are celibate monks, most Jains belong to the [[Shvetambara]] sect, which allows spouses and children. The general Jain code of [[ethics]] requires that one do no harm to any living being in thought, action, or word. Adultery is clearly a violation of a moral agreement with one's spouse, and therefore forbidden, and fornication too is seen as a violation of the state of chastity.

''Buddhism:'' The teachings of [[Buddhism]] include the noble eightfold path, comprising a division called right action. For laymen this involves abstaining from sexual misconduct, and for monks strict chastity.

{{Redirect|Cosmic background radiation||Cosmic background (disambiguation)}}
{{Physical cosmology|cTopic=Early universe}} 
In [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], '''cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation''' (also '''CMBR''', '''CBR''', '''MBR''', and '''relic radiation''') is [[thermal radiation]] filling the [[universe]] almost uniformly.&lt;ref name=&quot;apj142:419&quot;&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Penzias|first = A.A.|last2 = Wilson|first2=R.W.|title=A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080 Mc/s|journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=142|pages=419–421|year=1965|doi=10.1086/148307|bibcode=1965ApJ...142..419P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a traditional [[optical telescope]], the space between stars and galaxies (the ''background'') is completely dark. But a sufficiently sensitive [[radio telescope]] shows a faint background glow, almost exactly the same in all directions, that is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object. This glow is strongest in the [[microwave]] region of the radio spectrum. The CMB's serendipitous discovery in 1964 by American radio astronomers [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|author=Smoot Group|title=The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation|url=http://aether.lbl.gov/www/science/cmb.html|date=28 March 1996|publisher=[[Lawrence Berkeley Lab]]|accessdate=2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s, and earned them the 1978 [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize]].

Cosmic background radiation is well explained as radiation left over from an early stage in the development of the universe, and its discovery is considered a landmark test of the [[Big Bang]] model of the universe.  When the universe was young, before the formation of stars and planets, it was smaller, much hotter, and filled with a uniform glow from its white-hot fog of hydrogen [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].  As the universe expanded, both the plasma and the radiation filling it grew cooler. When the universe cooled enough, stable atoms could form. These atoms could no longer absorb the [[thermal radiation]], and the universe became transparent instead of being an opaque fog. The photons that existed at that time have been propagating ever since, though growing fainter and less energetic, since exactly the same photons fill a larger and larger universe. This is the source for the alternate term ''relic radiation''.

Precise measurements of cosmic background radiation are critical to cosmology, since any proposed model of the universe must explain this radiation. The CMBR has a thermal [[black body]] spectrum at a temperature of 2.725 K, thus the spectrum peaks in the [[microwave]] range frequency of 160.2&amp;nbsp;GHz, corresponding to a 1.9&amp;nbsp;mm wavelength.  This holds if you measure the intensity per unit frequency, as in [[Planck's law]].  If instead you measure it per unit wavelength, using [[Wien's displacement law|Wien's law]], the peak will be at 1.06&amp;nbsp;mm corresponding to a frequency of 283&amp;nbsp;GHz.

The glow is highly uniform in all directions, but shows a [[#Primary anisotropy|very specific pattern]] equal to that expected if a fairly uniformly distributed hot gas is expanded to the current size of the universe. In particular, the spatial [[spectral density|power spectrum]] (how much difference is observed versus how far apart the regions are on the sky) contains small [[anisotropy|anisotropies]], or irregularities, which vary with the size of the region examined. They have been measured in detail, and match what would be expected if small thermal variations, generated by quantum fluctuations of matter in a very tiny space, had expanded to the size of the observable universe we see today.  This is still a very active field of study, with scientists seeking both better data (for example, the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck spacecraft]]) and better interpretations of the initial conditions of expansion.

Although many different processes might produce the general form of a black body spectrum, no model other than the [[Big Bang]] has yet explained the fluctuations. As a result, most cosmologists consider the Big Bang model of the universe to be the best explanation for the CMBR.

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is an emission of uniform, [[black body]] thermal energy coming from all parts of the sky. The radiation is [[isotropic]] to roughly one part in 100,000: the [[root mean square]] variations are only 18 µK,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Wright|first=E.L.|year=2004|chapter=Theoretical Overview of Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropy|editor=W. L.

The latter is caused by the [[peculiar velocity]] of the Earth relative to the [[comoving coordinates|comoving]] cosmic rest frame as the planet moves at some 627&amp;nbsp;km/s towards the constellation [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]].

In the [[Big Bang]] model for the formation of the [[universe]], [[inflation (cosmology)|Inflationary Cosmology]] predicts that after about 10&lt;sup&gt;−37&lt;/sup&gt; seconds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guth|first=A. H.|year=1998|title=The Inflationary Universe: The Quest for a New Theory of Cosmic Origins|page=186|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|isbn=020132840}}&lt;/ref&gt; the nascent universe underwent [[exponential growth]] that smoothed out nearly all inhomogeneities. The remaining inhomogeneities were caused by quantum fluctuations in the [[inflaton]] field that caused the inflation event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cirigliano|first=D.|last2=de Vega|first2=H.J.|last3=Sanchez|first3=N.

As the universe [[metric expansion of space|expanded]], adiabatic cooling caused the plasma to lose energy until it became favorable for [[electrons]] to combine with [[protons]], forming [[hydrogen]] atoms. This [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] event happened when the temperature was around 3000&amp;nbsp;K or when the universe was approximately 379,000&amp;nbsp;years old.&lt;ref&gt;

{{cite journal|last=Gawiser|first=E.|last2=Silk|first2=J.|year=2000|title=The cosmic microwave background radiation|journal=[[Physics Reports]]|volume=333–334|pages=245|doi=10.1016/S0370-1573(00)00025-9|id=|arxiv=astro-ph/0002044|bibcode = 2000PhR...333..245G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[color temperature]] of the decoupled photons has continued to diminish ever since; now down to 2.725 K, their temperature will continue to drop as the universe expands. According to the Big Bang model, the radiation from the sky we measure today comes from a spherical surface called ''the surface of last scattering''. This represents the set of locations in space at which the decoupling event is believed to have occurred&lt;ref&gt;

Most of the radiation energy in the universe is in the cosmic microwave background,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hobson|first=M.P.|last2=Efstathiou|first2=G.|last3=Lasenby|first3=A.N.|year=2006|title=General Relativity: An Introduction for Physicists|pages=388|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0521829518}}&lt;/ref&gt; making up a fraction of roughly {{val|6|e=-5}} of the total density of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Unsöld|first1=A.|last2=Bodo|first2=B.|year=2002|title=The New Cosmos, An Introduction to Astronomy and Astrophysics|edition=5th|page=485|publisher=[[Springer–Verlag]]|isbn=3-540-67877-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the greatest successes of the Big Bang theory are its prediction of the almost perfect black body spectrum and its detailed prediction of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. The CMB spectrum has become the most precisely measured black body spectrum in nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;dpf99&quot;&gt;

The cosmic microwave background was predicted in 1948 by [[George Gamow]], [[Ralph Alpher]], and [[Robert Herman]].&lt;ref&gt;

This high estimate was due to an mis-estimate of the [[Hubble constant]] by Alfred Behr, which could not be replicated and was later abandoned for the earlier estimate. Although there were several previous estimates of the temperature of space, these suffered from two flaws. First, they were measurements of the [[effective temperature|''effective'' temperature]] of space and did not suggest that space was filled with a thermal [[Planck spectrum]]. Next, they depend on our being at a special spot at the edge of the [[Milky Way galaxy]] and they did not suggest the radiation is isotropic. The estimates would yield very different predictions if Earth happened to be located elsewhere in the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;

The 1948 results of Alpher and Herman were discussed in many physics settings through about 1955, when each left the Applied Physics Laboratory at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. The mainstream astronomical community, however, was not intrigued at the time by cosmology. Alpher and Herman's prediction was rediscovered by [[Yakov Zel'dovich]] in the early 1960s, and independently predicted by [[Robert Dicke]] at the same time. The first published recognition of the CMB radiation as a detectable phenomenon appeared in a brief paper by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astrophysicists [[A. G. Doroshkevich]] and [[Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov|Igor Novikov]], in the spring of 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Penzias|first=A.

Their instrument had an excess 3.5 K [[noise temperature|antenna temperature]] which they could not account for. After receiving a telephone call from Crawford Hill, Dicke famously quipped: &quot;Boys, we've been scooped.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;apj142:419&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The interpretation of the cosmic microwave background was a controversial issue in the 1960s with some proponents of the [[steady state theory]] arguing that the microwave background was the result of [[integrated starlight|scattered starlight]] from distant galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;

This was largely because new measurements at a range of frequencies showed that the spectrum was a thermal, [[black body]] spectrum, a result that the steady state model was unable to reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;

Harrison, Peebles, Yu and Zel'dovich realized that the early universe would have to have inhomogeneities at the level of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

Inspired by the COBE results, a series of ground and balloon-based experiments measured cosmic microwave background anisotropies on smaller angular scales over the next decade. The primary goal of these experiments was to measure the scale of the first acoustic peak, which COBE did not have sufficient resolution to resolve. This peak corresponds to large scale density variations in the early universe that are created by gravitational instabilities, resulting in acoustical oscillations in the plasma.&lt;ref&gt;

==Relationship to the Big Bang==
The cosmic microwave background radiation and the [[cosmological redshift]] are together regarded as the best available evidence for the [[Big Bang]] theory. Measurements of the CMB have made the inflationary Big Bang theory the standard model of the earliest eras of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=D.|year=2005|title=The Standard Cosmological Model|bibcode=2005astro.ph.10731S|id=|arxiv=astro-ph/0510731}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the CMB in the mid-1960s curtailed interest in [[non-standard cosmology|alternatives]] such as the [[steady state theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Durham, Frank; Purrington, Robert D.|title=Frame of the universe: a history of physical cosmology|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1983|isbn=0231053932|pages=193–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Big Bang theory predicts that the initial conditions for the universe are originally random in nature, and inhomogeneities follow a roughly [[normal distribution|Gaussian probability distribution]], which, when graphed in cross-section, form bell-shaped curves. By analyzing this distribution at different frequencies, a [[spectral density]] or power spectrum is generated. The power spectrum of these fluctuations has been calculated, and agrees with the observations. The resulting standard model of the Big Bang uses a [[Gaussian random field]] with a nearly [[scale invariant]] or [[Harrison-Zel'dovich]] spectrum to represent the primeval inhomogeneities.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite arxiv|last=Torres|first=S.|year=1993|title=Topological Analysis of COBE-DMR CMB Maps|class=astro-ph|eprint=astro-ph/9311067}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=J. M. T.|year=2005|title=Advances in Astronomy|pages=24–25|publisher=[[Imperial College Press]]|isbn=1860945775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain observables, for example the overall amplitude of the fluctuations, are more or less free parameters of the [[cosmic inflation]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Turner|first=M. S.|year=2002|title=The New Cosmology: Mid-term Report Card for Inflation|class=astro-ph|eprint=astro-ph/0212281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, meaningful statements about the inhomogeneities in the universe need to be [[statistics|statistical]] in nature. This leads to [[cosmic variance]] in which the uncertainties in the variance of fluctuations at the largest scale observed are difficult to accurately compare to theory.

===Temperature===
The CMB gives a snapshot of the [[universe]] when, according to standard cosmology, the temperature dropped enough to allow [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s to form [[hydrogen]] atoms, thus making the universe transparent to radiation. When it originated some 380,000 years after the Big Bang—this time is generally known as the &quot;time of last scattering&quot; or the period of [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] or [[Decoupling#Physical cosmology|decoupling]]—the temperature of the universe was about 3000 K. This corresponds to an energy of about 0.25 [[electronvolt|eV]], which is much less than the 13.6 eV ionization energy of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brandenberger|first=Robert H.|year=1995|title=Formation of Structure in the Universe|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995astro.ph..8159B|accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since decoupling, the temperature of the background radiation has dropped by a factor of roughly 1,100&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstWMAP&quot;/&gt; due to the expansion of the universe. As the universe expands, the CMB photons are [[redshift]]ed, making the radiation's temperature [[inversely proportional]] to a parameter called the universe's [[scale factor (Universe)|scale length]]. The temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; of the CMB as a function of redshift, z, can be shown to be proportional to the temperature of the CMB as observed in the present day (2.725 K or 0.235 meV):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Noterdaeme, P.; Petitjean, P.; Srianand, R.; Ledoux, C.; López, S. | title=The evolution of the cosmic microwave background temperature.

===Primary anisotropy===
[[Image:PowerSpectrumExt.svg|thumb|right|300px|The power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature anisotropy in terms of the angular scale (or [[multipole moment]]). The data shown come from the [[WMAP]] (2006), [[Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver|Acbar]] (2004) [[BOOMERanG experiment|Boomerang]] (2005), [[Cosmic Background Imager|CBI]] (2004), and [[Very Small Array|VSA]] (2004) instruments. Also shown is a theoretical model (solid line).]]

The [[anisotropy]] of the cosmic microwave background is divided into two sorts: primary anisotropy, due to effects which occur at the last scattering surface and before; and secondary anisotropy, due to effects such as interactions of the background radiation with hot gas or gravitational potentials, which occur between the last scattering surface and the observer.

The structure of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies is principally determined by two effects: acoustic oscillations and [[diffusion damping]] (also called collisionless damping or [[Joseph Silk|Silk]] damping). The acoustic oscillations arise because of a competition in the [[photon]]–[[baryon]] plasma in the early universe. The pressure of the photons tends to erase anisotropies, whereas the gravitational attraction of the baryons—moving at speeds much slower than light—makes them tend to collapse to form dense haloes. These two effects compete to create acoustic oscillations which give the microwave background its characteristic peak structure. The peaks correspond, roughly, to resonances in which the photons decouple when a particular mode is at its peak amplitude. 

The peaks contain interesting physical signatures. The angular scale of the first peak determines the [[shape of the universe|curvature of the universe]] (but not the [[topology]] of the universe). The next peak—ratio of the odd peaks to the even peaks—determines the reduced baryon density{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. The third peak can be used to pull information about the dark matter density{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.  

The locations of the peaks also give important information about the nature of the primordial density perturbations. There are two fundamental brands of density perturbations—called ''adiabatic'' and ''isocurvature''. A general density perturbation is a mixture of both, and different theories that purport to explain the primordial density perturbation spectrum predict different mixtures.  

*Adiabatic density perturbations
:the fractional overdensity in each matter component ([[baryon]]s, [[photon]]s ...) is the same. That is, if there is 1% more energy in baryons than average in one spot, then with a pure adiabatic density perturbations there is also 1% more energy in photons, and 1% more energy in neutrinos, than average.  [[Cosmic inflation]] predicts that the primordial perturbations are adiabatic.
*Isocurvature density perturbations
:the sum of the fractional overdensities is zero. That is, a perturbation where at some spot there is 1% more energy in baryons than average, 1% more energy in photons than average, and 2% ''less'' energy in neutrinos than average, would be a pure isocurvature perturbation. [[Cosmic string]]s would produce mostly isocurvature primordial perturbations.

The CMB spectrum is able to distinguish these two because these two brands of perturbations produce different peak locations. Isocurvature density perturbations produce a series of peaks whose angular scales (''l''-values of the peaks) are roughly in the ratio 1:3:5:..., while adiabatic density perturbations produce peaks whose locations are in the ratio 1:2:3:...&lt;ref name=&quot;hu_white_1996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hu |first=W.|last2=White|first2=M.|year=1996|title=Acoustic Signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background|journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=471|pages=30–51|doi=10.1086/177951|bibcode=1996ApJ...471...30H|arxiv = astro-ph/9602019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Observations are consistent with the primordial density perturbations being entirely adiabatic, providing key support for inflation, and ruling out many models of structure formation involving, for example, cosmic strings.

Collisionless damping is caused by two effects, when the treatment of the primordial plasma as [[fluid]] begins to break down:
*the increasing [[mean free path]] of the photons as the primordial plasma becomes increasingly rarefied in an expanding universe
*the finite depth of the last scattering surface (LSS), which causes the mean free path to increase rapidly during decoupling, even while some Compton scattering is still occurring.
These effects contribute about equally to the suppression of anisotropies on small scales, and give rise to the characteristic exponential damping tail seen in the very small angular scale anisotropies.

The depth of the LSS refers to the fact that the decoupling of the photons and baryons does not happen instantaneously, but instead requires an appreciable fraction of the age of the Universe up to that era. One method to quantify exactly ''how'' long this process took uses the ''photon visibility function'' (PVF). This function is defined so that, denoting the PVF by P(t), the probability that a CMB photon last scattered between time t and t+dt is given by P(t)dt.

The maximum of the PVF (the time where it is most likely that a given CMB photon last scattered) is known quite precisely. The first-year [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] results put the time at which P(t) is maximum as {{val|372|14|u=kyr}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;WMAP_1_cosmo_params&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=WMAP Collaboration|year=2003|title=First-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Determination of Cosmological Parameters|journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]] (Supplement Series)|volume=148|last2=Verde|issue=1|pages=175–194|first2=L.|doi=10.1086/377226|id=|last3=Peiris|first3=H. V.|last4=Komatsu|first4=E.|last5=Nolta|first5=M. R.|last6=Bennett|first6=C.

However, to figure out how ''long'' it took the photons and baryons to decouple, we need a measure of the width of the PVF. The WMAP team finds that the PVF is greater than half of its maximum value (the &quot;full width at half maximum&quot;, or FWHM) over an interval of {{val|115|5|u=kyr}}. By this measure, decoupling took place over roughly 115,000 years, and when it was complete, the universe was roughly 487,000 years old.

===Late time anisotropy===
Since the CMB came into existence, it has apparently been modified by several subsequent physical processes, which are collectively referred to as late-time anisotropy, or secondary anisotropy. When the CMB photons became free to travel unimpeded, ordinary matter in the universe was mostly in the form of neutral hydrogen and helium atoms. However, observations of galaxies today seem to indicate that most of the volume of the [[intergalactic medium]] (IGM) consists of ionized material (since there are few absorption lines due to hydrogen atoms). This implies a period of [[reionization]] during which some of the material of the universe was broken into hydrogen ions.

The CMB photons scatter off free charges such as electrons that are not bound in atoms. In an ionized universe, such charged particles have been liberated from neutral atoms by ionizing (ultraviolet) radiation. Today these free charges are at sufficiently low density in most of the volume of the Universe that they do not measurably affect the CMB. However, if the IGM was ionized at very early times when the universe was still denser, then there are two main effects on the CMB:
# Small scale anisotropies are erased. (Just as when looking at an object through fog, details of the object appear fuzzy.)
# The physics of how photons scatter off from free electrons ([[Thomson scattering]]) induces polarization anisotropies on large angular scales. This broad angle polarization is correlated with the broad angle temperature perturbation.

Both of these effects have been observed by the WMAP spacecraft, providing evidence that the universe was ionized at very early times, at a [[redshift]] more than 17. The detailed provenance of this early ionizing radiation is still a matter of scientific debate. It may have included starlight from the very first population of stars ([[population III]] stars), supernovae when these first stars reached the end of their lives, or the ionizing radiation produced by the accretion disks of massive black holes.

The time following the emission of the cosmic microwave background—and before the observation of the first stars—is semi-humorously referred to by cosmologists as the [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Dark ages|dark age]], and is a period which is under intense study by astronomers (See [[21 centimeter radiation]]).

Two other effects which occurred between reionization and our observations of the cosmic microwave background, and which appear to cause anisotropies, include the [[Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect]], where a cloud of high-energy electrons scatters the radiation, transferring some of its energy to the CMB photons, and the [[Sachs–Wolfe effect]], which causes [[photon]]s from the Cosmic Microwave Background to be gravitationally redshifted or blueshifted due to changing gravitational fields.

[[Image:WMAP 5 year CMB Power Spectra.png|thumb|right|300px|E polarization measurements as of March 2008 in terms of angular scale (or [[multipole moment]]). The polarization is much more poorly measured than the temperature anisotropy.]]

===Polarization===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cosmic inflation]] --&gt;
{{main|Polarization in astronomy}}

The cosmic microwave background is [[polarization (waves)|polarized]] at the level of a few microkelvins. There are two types of polarization, called ''E''-modes and ''B''-modes. This is in analogy to [[electrostatics]], in which the electric field (''E''-field) has a vanishing [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] and the magnetic field (''B''-field) has a vanishing [[divergence]]. The ''E''-modes arise naturally from [[Thomson scattering]] in a heterogeneous plasma. The ''B''-modes, which have not been measured and are thought to have an amplitude of at most a 0.1 µK, are not produced from the plasma physics alone. They are a signal from [[cosmic inflation]] and are determined by the density of primordial [[gravitational wave]]s. Detecting the ''B''-modes will be extremely difficult, particularly given that the degree of foreground contamination is unknown, and the [[weak gravitational lensing]] signal mixes the relatively strong ''E''-mode signal with the ''B''-mode signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=A.|last2=Challinor|first2=A.|year=2006|title=Weak gravitational lensing of the CMB|journal=[[Physics Reports]]|volume=429|pages=1–65|doi = 10.1016/j.physrep.2006.03.002|id=|arxiv=astro-ph/0601594|bibcode = 2006PhR...429....1L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microwave background observations==
{{main|Cosmic microwave background experiments}}

Subsequent to the discovery of the CMB, hundreds of cosmic microwave background experiments have been conducted to measure and characterize the signatures of the radiation. The most famous experiment is probably the [[NASA]] Cosmic Background Explorer ([[COBE]]) satellite that orbited in 1989–1996 and which detected and quantified the large scale anisotropies at the limit of its detection capabilities. Inspired by the initial COBE results of an extremely isotropic and homogeneous background, a series of ground- and balloon-based experiments quantified CMB anisotropies on smaller angular scales over the next decade. The primary goal of these experiments was to measure the angular scale of the first acoustic peak, for which COBE did not have sufficient resolution. These measurements were able to rule out [[cosmic strings]] as the leading theory of cosmic structure formation, and suggested [[cosmic inflation]] was the right theory. During the 1990s, the first peak was measured with increasing sensitivity and by 2000 the [[BOOMERanG experiment]] reported that the highest power fluctuations occur at scales of approximately one degree. Together with other cosmological data, these results implied that the geometry of the Universe is [[flat space|flat]]. A number of ground-based [[interferometer]]s provided measurements of the fluctuations with higher accuracy over the next three years, including the [[Very Small Array]], [[Degree Angular Scale Interferometer]] (DASI), and the [[Cosmic Background Imager]] (CBI). DASI made the first detection of the polarization of the CMB and the CBI provided the first E-mode polarization spectrum with compelling evidence that it is out of phase with the T-mode spectrum.

In June 2001, [[NASA]] launched a second CMB space mission, [[WMAP]], to make much more precise measurements of the great scale anisotropies over the full sky. [[WMAP]] used symmetric, rapid-multi-modulated scanning, rapid switching radiometers to minimize non-sky signal noise.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstWMAP&quot;/&gt; The first results from this mission, disclosed in 2003, were detailed measurements of the angular power spectrum to below degree scales, tightly constraining various cosmological parameters. The results are broadly consistent with those expected from [[cosmic inflation]] as well as various other competing theories, and are available in detail at NASA's data bank for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) (see links below). Although WMAP provided very accurate measurements of the great angular-scale fluctuations in the CMB (structures about as broad in the sky as the moon), it did not have the angular resolution to measure the smaller scale fluctuations which had been observed by former ground-based [[interferometer]]s.

A third space mission, the [[European Space Agency|ESA]] (European Space Agency) [[Planck Surveyor]], launched in May, 2009 and is currently performing an even more detailed investigation. Planck employs both [[HEMT]] radiometers as well as [[bolometer]] technology and will measure the CMB on smaller scales than WMAP. Its detectors got a trial run at the Antarctic [[Viper telescope]] as ACBAR ([[Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver]]) experiment—which has produced the most precise measurements at small angular scales to date—and at the [[Archeops]] balloon telescope.

Additional ground-based instruments such as the [[South Pole Telescope]] in Antarctica and the proposed [[Clover (telescope)|Clover]] Project, [[Atacama Cosmology Telescope]] and the [[QUIET telescope]] in Chile will provide additional data not available from satellite observations, possibly including the B-mode polarization.

==Data reduction and analysis==
Raw CMBR data coming down from the space vehicle (i.e., WMAP) contain foreground effects that completely obscure the fine-scale structure of the Cosmic Microwave background. The fine-scale structure is superimposed on the raw CMBR data but is too small to be seen at the scale of the raw data. The most prominent of the foreground effects is the dipole anisotropy caused by the Sun's motion relative to the CMBR background. The dipole anisotropy and others due to Earth's annual motion relative to the Sun and numerous microwave sources in the galactic plane and elsewhere must be subtracted out to reveal the extremely tiny variations characterizing the fine-scale structure of the CMBR background.

The detail analysis of CMBR data to produce maps, an angular power spectrum, and ultimately cosmological parameters is a complicated, computationally difficult problem. Although computing a power spectrum from a map is in principle a simple [[Fourier transform]], decomposing the map of the sky into [[spherical harmonics]], in practice it is hard to take the effects of noise and foreground sources into account. In particular, these foregrounds are dominated by galactic emissions such [[Bremsstrahlung|free-free]], [[Synchrotron_radiation#Synchrotron_radiation_in_astronomy|synchrotron]], and [[dust#Dust in other contexts|dust]] that emit in the microwave band; in practice, the galaxy has to be removed resulting in a CMB map that is not a full-sky map.  In addition, point sources like galaxies and clusters represent another source of foreground which must be removed lest they distort the short scale structure of the CMB power spectrum.

Constraints on many cosmological parameters can be obtained from their effects on the power spectrum, and results are often calculated using [[Markov Chain Monte Carlo]] sampling techniques.

===CMBR dipole anisotropy===
From the CMB data it is seen that our local group of galaxies (the galactic cluster that includes the Solar System's Milky Way Galaxy) appears to be moving at 627±22&amp;nbsp;km/s relative to the '''reference frame of the CMB''' (also called the '''CMB rest frame''', or the frame of reference in which there is no motion through the CMB) in the direction of galactic longitude ''l'' = 276±3°, ''b'' = 30±3°.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kogut|first=A.|coauthors=''et al.''|year=1993|title=Dipole Anisotropy in the COBE Differential Microwave Radiometers First-Year Sky Maps|journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=419|pages=1–6|doi=10.1086/173453|id=|bibcode=1993ApJ...419....1K|arxiv=astro-ph/9312056}}&lt;/ref&gt; This motion results in an anisotropy of the data (CMB appearing slightly warmer in the direction of movement than in the opposite direction).&lt;ref&gt;http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap090906.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The standard interpretation of this temperature variation is a simple velocity redshift and blueshift due to motion relative to the CMB, but alternative cosmological models can explain some fraction of the observed dipole temperature distribution in the CMB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inoue|first=K.

===Low multipoles and other anomalies===
With the increasingly precise data provided by WMAP, there have been a number of claims that the CMB suffers from anomalies, such as very great-scale anisotropies, anomalous alignments, and non-Gaussian distributions.&lt;ref name=&quot;arXiv:0905.2854v2&quot;&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Rossmanith|first=G.|coauthors=''et al.''|year=2009|title=Non-Gaussian Signatures in the five-year WMAP data as identified with isotropic scaling indices|class=astro-ph.CO|eprint=0905.2854}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arXiv:0802.3229&quot;&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Schild|first=R.

Even in the COBE map, it was observed that the [[quadrupole]] (''l''=2 spherical harmonic) has a low amplitude compared to the predictions of the big bang. Some observers have pointed out that the anisotropies in the WMAP data did not appear to be consistent with the big bang picture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Comparative law''' is the study of differences and similarities between the [[law]] of different countries.  More specifically, it involves study of the different legal systems in existence in the world, including the [[common law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[socialist law]], [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[Hindu law]], and [[Chinese law]]. It includes the description and analysis of foreign legal systems, even where no explicit comparison is undertaken.  The importance of comparative law has increased enormously in the present age of internationalism, economic globalisation and democratisation.

==History==

The birth of modern comparative law is generally attributed to Europe in the eighteenth century.  However, prior to that, legal scholars (forerunners of today's [[comparativists]] and international lawyers) practiced comparative method.  In [[Russian legal history]], for instance, comparative method dates back to the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Wildy, Simmonds | isbn = 1-884445-42-X | pages = 124 | last = Butler| first = William E.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montesquieu===
According to the prevalent view, [[Montesquieu]] is regarded as the 'father' of comparative law. His comparative approach is obvious in the following excerpt from Chapter III of Book I of what many consider to be his masterpiece, [[De l'esprit des lois]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/cm/sol.htm  Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu, ''The Spirit of Laws,'' Translated by Thomas Nugent, revised by J. V. Prichard, Based on an public domain edition published in 1914 by G. Bell &amp; Sons, Ltd., London]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[The political and civil laws of each nation] should be adapted in such a manner to the people for whom they are framed that it should be a great chance if those of one nation suit another. They should be in relation to the nature and principle of each government; whether they form it, as may be said of politic laws; or whether they support it, as in the case of civil institutions.

They should be in relation to the climate of each country, to the quality of its soil, to its situation and extent, to the principal occupation of the natives, whether husbandmen, huntsmen, or shepherds: they should have relation to the degree of liberty which the constitution will bear; to the religion of the inhabitants, to their inclinations, riches, numbers, commerce, manners, and customs.}}

Also, in Chapter XI (entitled 'How to compare two different Systems of Laws') of Book XXIX he advises that &quot;to determine which of those systems [i.e. the French and English systems for the punishment of false witnesses] is most agreeable to reason, we must take them each as a whole and compare them in their entirety.&quot; Yet another excerpt where Montesqieu's comparative approach is evident is the following one from Chapter XIII of Book XXIX:

{{quote|As the civil laws depend on the political institutions, because they are made for the same society, whenever there is a design of adopting the civil law of another nation, it would be proper to examine beforehand whether they have both the same institutions and the same political law.}}

===Birth as a discipline in the U.S.===

Comparative law in the US was brought by a legal scholar fleeing persecution in Germany, [[Rudolf Schlesinger]].  Schlesinger eventually became professor of comparative law at [[Cornell Law School]] helping to spread the discipline throughout the US.

== Purpose==
Comparative law is an academic study of separate legal systems, each one analysed in its constitutive elements; how they differ in the different legal systems, and how their elements combine into a system.

Several disciplines have developed as separate branches of comparative law, including comparative [[constitutional law]], comparative [[administrative law]], comparative [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] (in the sense of the law of [[tort]]s, [[delict]]s, [[contract]]s and [[Law of obligations|obligations]]), comparative [[commercial law]] (in the sense of [[Companies law|business organisations]] and trade), and comparative [[criminal law]]. Studies of these specific areas may be viewed as micro- or macro-comparative legal analysis, i.e. detailed comparisons of two countries, or broad-ranging studies of several countries. Comparative civil law studies, for instance, show how the law of private relations is organised, interpreted and used in different systems or countries. It appears today the principal purposes of comparative law are:

* to attain a deeper knowledge of the legal systems in effect
* to perfect the legal systems in effect
* possibly, to contribute to a unification of legal systems, of a smaller or larger scale (cf. for instance, the [[UNIDROIT]] initiative)

==Importance==
Comparative law is a very important discipline in communication between legal systems. It may provide the basis for the production of bilingual dictionaries that include the information necessary to make legal communication across borders successful. It also helps mutual understanding and the dispelling of prejudice and misinterpretation. In this globalising world, comparative law is important for it provides a platform for intellectual exchange in terms of law and it cultivates a culture of understanding in a diverse world. Furthermore, comparative law helps in broadening horizons for law reformers and legislators around the world. It can also be helpful in international relations in shaping foreign policies.

==Relationship with other legal subjects==
Comparative law is different from the fields of general [[jurisprudence]] (legal theory), [[international law]], including both [[public international law]] and [[private international law]] (also known as [[conflict of laws]]).

Despite the differences between comparative law and these other legal fields, comparative law helps inform all of these areas of normativity. For example, comparative law can help international legal institutions, such as those of the [[United Nations System]], in analyzing the laws of different countries regarding their treaty obligations. Comparative law would be applicable to private international law when developing an approach to interpretation in a conflicts analysis. Comparative law may contribute to legal theory by creating categories and concepts of general application. Comparative law may also provide insights into the question of [[legal transplants]], i.e. the transplanting of law and legal institutions from one system to another. The notion of [[legal transplants]] was coined by [[Alan Watson]], one of the world's renowned legal scholars specializing in comparative law.

Also, the usefulness of comparative law for the sociology of law (and vice versa) is very large. The comparative study of the various legal systems may show how different legal regulations for the same problem function in practice. Conversely, sociology of law may help comparative law answer questions, such as: How do regulations in different legal systems really function in the respective societies? Are certain legal rules comparable? How do the similarities and differences between legal systems get explained?

==Classifications of legal systems==
===Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff===

Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff&lt;ref&gt;''Traité de droit comparé'' - in French; Paris 1950-1952&lt;/ref&gt; believed that, for purposes of classifying the (then) contemporary legal systems of the world, it was required that those systems ''per se'' get studied, irrespective of external factors, such as geographical ones. They proposed the classification of legal system into seven groups, or so-called 'families', in particular the
*[[Law of France|French group]], under which they also included the countries that codified their law either in 19th or in the first half of the 20th century, using the [[Napoleonic code|Napoleonic ''code civil'']] of year 1804 as a model; this includes countries and jurisdictions such as [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Louisiana]], states of [[South America]] (such as [[Brazil]]), [[Quebec]], [[Santa Lucia]], [[Romania]], the [[Ionian Islands]], [[Egypt]], and [[Lebanon]]
*[[Law of Germany|German group]]
*[[Scandinavia]]n group (comprising the laws of [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], and [[Iceland]])
*[[Common law|English group]] (incl. [[England]], the [[United States law|United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] ''inter alia'')
*[[Russia]]n group
*[[Sharia|Islamic group]] (used in the [[Muslim world]])
*[[Hindu law|Hindu group]]

===David===

David&lt;ref&gt;''Traité élémentaire de droit civile comparé: Introduction à l'étude des droits étrangers et à la méthode comparative'' - in French; Paris, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the classification of legal systems, according to the different ideology inspiring each one, into five groups or families:
*[[Western world|Western]] Laws, a group subdivided into the:
**[[Romano-Germanic law|Romano-Germanic subgroup]] (comprising those legal systems where legal science was formulated according to [[Roman Law]] - see also [[Civil law (legal system)]])
**[[Common law|Anglo-Saxon subgroup]]
*[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Law
*[[Sharia|Muslim Law]]
*[[Hindu law|Hindu Law]]
*[[Chinese law|Chinese Law]]

Especially with respect to the aggregating by David of the Romano-Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Laws into a single family, David argued that the antithesis between the Anglo-Saxon Laws and Romano-German Laws, is of a technical rather than of an ideological nature. Of a different kind is, for instance, the antithesis between (say) the Italian and the American Law, and of a different kind that between the Soviet, Muslim, Hindu, or Chinese Law. According to David, the Romano-Germanic legal systems included those countries where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law, whereas [[common law]] countries are those where law was created from the [[judge]]s. The characteristics that he believed uniquely differentiate the Western legal family from the other four are
*liberal democracy
*capitalist economy
*Christian religion

===Zweigert and Kötz===
Zweigert and Kötz&lt;ref&gt;''An Introduction to Comparative Law'', translation from the Germany original: T. Weir, 3rd edition; Oxford, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; propose a different, multidimensional methodology for categorizing laws, i.e. for ordering families of laws. They maintain that, to determine such families, five criteria should be taken into account, in particular: the historical background, the characteristic way of thought, the different institutions, the recognized sources of law, and the dominant ideology. Using the aforementioned criteria, they classify the legal systems of the world into six families. These are the

*[[Roman law|Roman family]]
*[[Law of Germany|German family]]
*[[Common law|Common law family]]
*[[Scandinavia|Nordic]] family
*Family of the laws of the [[Far East]] ([[Chinese law|China]] and [[Japan]])
*Religious family ([[Sharia|Muslim]] and [[Hindu law|Hindu]] law)

'''Cyberspace''' is the electronic medium of computer networks, in which online communication takes place.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.thefreedictionary.com/cyberspace&quot;&gt;Free Dictionary [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cyberspace ''&quot;Cyberspace Defined&quot;'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;cyberspace&quot; was first used by the [[cyberpunk]] science fiction author [[William Gibson]].&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite news |work=WIRED |title=March 17, 1948: William Gibson, Father of Cyberspace | author=Scott Thil | date=03.17.09 | url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2009/03/dayintech_0317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widely used since, it has been criticized by its inventor, as Gibson himself would later describe it as an &quot;evocative and essentially meaningless&quot; [[buzzword]] that could serve as a [[cipher]] for all of his &quot;cybernetic musings&quot;.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; The first component of the term comes from &quot;[[cybernetics]]&quot;, which is derived from the Greek κυβερνήτης (kybernētēs, steersman, governor, pilot, or rudder), a word introduced by [[Norbert Wiener]] for his pioneering work in electronic communication and control science. 

Now ubiquitous, in current usage the term &quot;cyberspace&quot; stands for the global network of interdependent information technology infrastructures, telecommunications networks and computer processing systems. As a social experience, individuals can interact, exchange ideas, share information, provide social support, conduct business, direct actions, create artistic media, play games, engage in political discussion, and so on, using this global network. The term has become a conventional means to describe anything associated with the [[Internet]] and the diverse Internet culture. The United States government recognizes the interconnected information technology and the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures operating across this medium as part of the US National [[critical infrastructure|Critical Infrastructure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov&quot;&gt;White House, [http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/pcipb/ ''&quot;The National Strategy To Secure Cyberspace&quot;'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Chip Morningstar]] and [[F. Randall Farmer]], cyberspace is defined more by the social interactions involved rather than its technical implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Morningstar, Chip and F. Randall Farmer. The Lessons of Lucasfilm's Habitat. ''The New Media Reader''. Ed. Wardrip-Fruin and Nick Montfort: The MIT Press, 2003. 664-667. Print&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, the computational medium in cyberspace is an augmentation of the communication channel between real people; the core characteristic of cyberspace is that it offers an environment that consists of many participants with the ability to affect and influence each other. They derive this concept from the observation that people seek richness, complexity, and depth within a virtual world.

== Origins of the term ==
The word &quot;cyberspace&quot; (from ''[[cybernetics]]'' and ''[[space]]'') was [[coined]] by science fiction novelist and seminal [[cyberpunk]] author [[William Gibson]] in his 1982 story &quot;[[Burning Chrome]]&quot; and popularized by his 1984 novel ''[[Neuromancer]].''&lt;ref&gt;''Po-Mo SF'' [http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/technoculture/pomosf.html &quot;William Gibson's Neuromancer and Post-Modern Science Fiction&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Worldwidewebamc&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1145/234173.234177|accessdate=2010-04-10|title=The client's side of the World-Wide Web|year=1996|last1=Berghel|first1=Hal|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=39|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portion of ''Neuromancer'' cited in this respect is usually the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gibson | first = William | title = Neuromancer | publisher = Ace Books | location = New York | year = 1984 | isbn = 0441569560 | page = 69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts... A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding.}}

Despite its originally negative overtone, the term no longer carries a negative connotation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Worldwidewebamc&quot;/&gt;

Gibson later commented on the origin of the term in the 2000 documentary ''[[No Maps for These Territories]]'':

{{quote|All I knew about the word &quot;cyberspace&quot; when I coined it, was that it seemed like an effective buzzword. It seemed evocative and essentially meaningless. It was suggestive of something, but had no real semantic meaning, even for me, as I saw it emerge on the page.}}

=== Metaphorical ===
The metaphor used to describe the &quot;sense of a social setting that exists purely within a space of representation and communication . . . it exists entirely within a computer space, distributed across increasingly complex and fluid networks.&quot; (Slater 2002, 355)
The term &quot;Cyberspace&quot; started to become a de facto synonym for the [[internet]], and later the [[World Wide Web]], during the 1990s, especially in academic circles&lt;ref&gt;Vanderbilt University, [http://www.vanderbilt.edu/ans/english/clayton/sch295.htm ''&quot;Postmodernism and the Culture of Cyberspace&quot;''], Fall 1996 course syllabus&lt;/ref&gt; and activist communities. Author [[Bruce Sterling]], who popularized this meaning,&lt;ref&gt;''Principia Cybernetica'' [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/CYBSPACE.html &quot;Cyberspace&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; credits [[John Perry Barlow]] as the first to use it to refer to &quot;the present-day nexus of computer and telecommunications networks.&quot; Barlow describes it thus in his essay to announce the formation of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (note the spatial metaphor) in June, 1990:&lt;ref&gt;John Perry Barlow, [http://www.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html &quot;Crime and Puzzlement,&quot;] June 8, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In this silent world, all conversation is typed. To enter it, one forsakes both body and place and becomes a thing of words alone. You can see what your neighbors are saying (or recently said), but not what either they or their physical surroundings look like. Town meetings are continuous and discussions rage on everything from sexual kinks to depreciation schedules.

Whether by one telephonic tendril or millions, they are all connected to one another. Collectively, they form what their inhabitants call the Net. It extends across that immense region of electron states, microwaves, magnetic fields, light pulses and thought which sci-fi writer William Gibson named Cyberspace.|John Perry Barlow|&quot;Crime and Puzzlement,&quot; 1990-06-08}}

As Barlow, and the EFF, continued public education efforts to promote the idea of &quot;[[digital rights]]&quot;, the term was increasingly used during the internet boom of the late 1990s.

=== Virtual environments ===
Although the present-day, loose use of the term &quot;cyberspace&quot; no longer implies or suggests immersion in a virtual reality, current technology allows the integration of a number of capabilities (sensors, signals, connections, transmissions, processors, and controllers) sufficient to generate a [[virtual#Computer technology|virtual]] interactive experience that is accessible regardless of a geographic location.

In 1989, [[Autodesk]], an American multinational corporation that focuses on 2D and 3D design software, developed a virtual design system called Cyberspace.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Pollack, New York Times, [http://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/10/business/for-artificial-reality-wear-a-computer.html &quot;For Artificial Reality, Wear A Computer,&quot;] April 10, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyberspace as an internet metaphor==
While cyberspace should not be confused with the [[internet]], the term is often used to refer to objects and identities that exist largely within the communication network itself, so that a [[website]], for example, might be metaphorically said to &quot;exist in cyberspace.&quot; According to this interpretation, events taking place on the internet are not happening in the locations where participants or servers are physically located, but &quot;in cyberspace&quot;.

Firstly, cyberspace describes the flow of digital data through the network of interconnected computers: it is at once not &quot;real&quot;, since one could not spatially locate it as a tangible object, and clearly &quot;real&quot; in its effects. Secondly, cyberspace is the site of computer-mediated communication (CMC), in which online relationships and alternative forms of online identity were enacted, raising important questions about the social psychology of internet use, the relationship between &quot;online&quot; and &quot;offline&quot; forms of life and interaction, and the relationship between the &quot;real&quot; and the virtual. Cyberspace draws attention to remediation of culture through [[new media]] technologies: it is not just a communication tool but a social destination, and is culturally significant in its own right. Finally, cyberspace can be seen as providing new opportunities to reshape society and culture through &quot;hidden&quot; identities, or it can be seen as borderless communication and culture.&lt;ref&gt;New Media, an Introduction: Flew, Terry&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Cyberspace is the &quot;place&quot; where a telephone conversation appears to occur. Not inside your actual phone, the plastic device on your desk. Not inside the other person's phone, in some other city. '''The place between''' the phones. [...] in the past twenty years, this electrical &quot;space,&quot; which was once thin and dark and one-dimensional—little more than a narrow speaking-tube, stretching from phone to phone—has flung itself open like a gigantic jack-in-the-box. Light has flooded upon it, the eerie light of the glowing computer screen. This dark electric netherworld has become a vast flowering electronic landscape. Since the 1960s, the world of the telephone has cross-bred itself with computers and television, and though there is still no substance to cyberspace, nothing you can handle, it has a strange kind of physicality now. It makes good sense today to talk of cyberspace as a place all its own.|Bruce Sterling|Introduction to '''[[The Hacker Crackdown]]'''}}

The &quot;space&quot; in cyberspace has more in common with the abstract, mathematical meanings of the term (see [[space]]) than physical space. It does not have the duality of positive and negative volume (while in physical space for example a room has the negative volume of usable space delineated by positive volume of walls, internet users cannot enter the screen and explore the unknown part of the internet as an extension of the space they are in), but spatial meaning can be attributed to the relationship between different [[Web page|page]]s (of books as well as [[webserver]]s), considering the unturned pages to be somewhere &quot;out there.&quot; The concept of cyberspace therefore refers not to the content being presented to the surfer, but rather to the possibility of surfing among different [[Website|site]]s, with [[feedback|feedback loops]] between the user and the rest of the system creating the potential to always encounter something unknown or unexpected.

[[Videogame]]s differ from text-based communication in that on-screen images are meant to be figures that actually occupy a space and the animation shows the movement of those figures. Images are supposed to form the positive volume that delineates the empty space. A game adopts the cyberspace metaphor by engaging more players in the game, and then figuratively representing them on the screen as [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]]s. Games do not have to stop at the avatar-player level, but current implementations aiming for more [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]] playing space (i.e. [[Laser tag]]) take the form of [[augmented reality]] rather than cyberspace, fully immersive virtual realities remaining impractical.

Although the more radical consequences of the global communication network predicted by some cyberspace proponents (i.e. the diminishing of state influence envisioned by [[John Perry Barlow]]&lt;ref&gt;John Perry Barlow, [http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html ''&quot;A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace,&quot;''] February 8, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;) failed to materialize and the word lost some of its novelty appeal, it remains current as of 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/legalnews/scitech/cyber/ ''FindLaw Legal News'' site], Tech and IP: Cyberspace section, retrieved November 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[virtual communities]] explicitly refer to the concept of cyberspace, for example [[Linden Lab]] calling their customers &quot;[[Resident (Second Life)|Residents]]&quot; of [[Second Life]], while all such communities can be positioned &quot;in cyberspace&quot; for explanatory and comparative purposes (as did Sterling in ''The Hacker Crackdown'', followed by many journalists), integrating the metaphor into a wider [[cyberculture|cyber-culture]].

The metaphor has been useful in helping a new generation of thought leaders to reason through new military strategies around the world, led largely by the US Department of Defense (DoD).&lt;ref&gt;Cyber Conflict Studies Association, [http://www.cyberconflict.org CCSA]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of cyberspace as a metaphor has had its limits, however, especially in areas where the metaphor becomes confused with physical infrastructure.

==Alternate realities in philosophy and art==
===Predating computers===
A forerunner of the modern ideas of cyberspace is the [[Descartes|Cartesian]] notion that people might be deceived by an evil demon that feeds them a false reality. This argument is the direct predecessor of modern ideas of a [[brain in a vat]] and many popular conceptions of cyberspace take Descartes's ideas as their starting point.

[[Visual arts]] have a tradition, stretching [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius|back to antiquity]], of artifacts meant to [[Trompe-l'œil|fool the eye]] and be mistaken for reality. This questioning of reality occasionally led some philosophers and especially theologians{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} to distrust art as deceiving people into entering a world which was not real (see [[Aniconism]]). The artistic challenge was resurrected with increasing ambition as art became more and more realistic with the invention of photography, film (see ''[[L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat|Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat]]''), and immersive computer simulations.

===Influenced by computers===
====Philosophy====
American [[counterculture]] exponents like [[William S. Burroughs]] (whose literary influence on Gibson and cyberpunk in general is widely acknowledged&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Laurence]], [http://www.altx.com/int2/john.shirley.html An Interview with [[John Shirley]]], 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streettech.com/bcp/BCPgraf/CyberCulture/bgtg.htm &quot;Burroughs/Gysin/Throbbing Gristle&quot;], retrieved December 31, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Timothy Leary]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Internet will be the LSD of the 90s&quot;, quoted by [http://www.timothyleary.us/timothyleary.html an on-line biography]&lt;/ref&gt; were among the first to extoll the potential of computers and computer networks for individual empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Rushkoff]], [http://www.deepleafproductions.com/utopialibrary/text/rushkoff-godfathers.html &quot;Godfathers of Cyberspace&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary philosophers and scientists (i.e. [[David Deutsch]] in ''The Fabric of Reality'') employ virtual reality in various [[thought experiment]]s. For example [[Philip Zhai]] in ''Get Real: A Philosophical Adventure in Virtual Reality'' connects cyberspace to the platonic tradition:

{{quote|Let us imagine a nation in which everyone is hooked up to a network of VR infrastructure. They have been so hooked up since they left their mother's wombs. Immersed in cyberspace and maintaining their life by teleoperation, they have never imagined that life could be any different from that. The first person that thinks of the possibility of an alternative world like ours would be ridiculed by the majority of these citizens, just like the few enlightened ones in Plato's allegory of the cave.}}

Note that this [[brain-in-a-vat]] argument conflates cyberspace with [[reality]], while the more common descriptions of cyberspace contrast it with the &quot;real world&quot;.

====Art====
''Main article:'' [[New media art]]

Having originated among writers, the concept of cyberspace remains most popular in literature and film. Although artists working with other media have expressed interest in the concept, such as [[Roy Ascott]], &quot;cyberspace&quot; in [[digital art]] is mostly used as a synonym for [[immersive virtual reality]] and remains more discussed than enacted.&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Kac, [http://www.ekac.org/Telepresence.art._94.html ''&quot;Telepresence Art&quot;'']&lt;/ref&gt;
Indian epic Mahabaratha written by sage Vyasar talks about concepts what is called today Virtual reality, Transportation in to matrix and web conferencing.

====Computer crime ====
''Main article:'' [[Computer crime]]

Cyberspace also brings together every service and facility imaginable to expedite money laundering. One can purchase anonymous credit cards, bank accounts, encrypted global mobile telephones, and false passports. From there one can pay professional advisors to set up IBCs (International Business Corporations, or corporations with anonymous ownership) or similar structures in OFCs (Offshore Financial Centers). Such advisors are loath to ask any penetrating questions about the wealth and activities of their clients, since the average fees criminals pay them to launder their money can be as much as 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Granville [http://www.scribd.com/doc/14361572/Dotcon-Dangers-of-Cybercrime-by-Johanna-Granville “Dot.Con: The Dangers of Cyber Crime and a Call for Proactive Solutions,”] ''Australian Journal of Politics and History'', vol. 49, no. 1. (Winter 2003), pp. 102-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

====5-level model ====
A [http://www.alliancegeostrategique.org/2010/10/04/une-ebauche-apocryphe-et-anthropocentrique-du-cyberespace/ 5-level model] has been designed recently in France. According to it, the cyberspace is composed of 5 layers based on information discoveries : language, writing, printing, Internet, etc.. This original model links the world of information to telecommunication technologies.

== Popular culture examples ==
* The anime ''[[Digimon]]'' is set in a variant of the cyberspace concept called the &quot;Digital World&quot;. The Digital World is a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] made up of data from the internet. Similar to cyberspace, except that people could physically enter this world instead of merely using a computer.
*The CGI show, [[ReBoot]], takes place entirely inside cyberspace, which is composed of two worlds: the Net and the Web.
* In the movie ''[[Tron (film)|Tron]]'', a programmer was physically transferred to the program world, where programs were personalities, resembling the forms of their creators.
* In the movie ''[[Virtuosity]]'' a program encapsulating a super-criminal within a virtual world simulation escapes into the &quot;real world&quot;.
* In the novel ''[[Simulacron-3]]'' the author Daniel F. Galouye explores multiple levels of &quot;reality&quot; represented by the multiple levels of computer simulation involved.
* The idea of &quot;the matrix&quot; in the movie ''[[The Matrix]]'' resembles a complex form of cyberspace where people are &quot;jacked in&quot; from birth and do not know that the reality they experience is virtual.

The '''Maritime provinces''', also called '''the Maritimes''' or the '''Canadian Maritimes''', is a [[list of regions of Canada#National regions|region]] of [[Eastern Canada]] consisting of three [[provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]]: [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]], and [[Prince Edward Island]].
&lt;!-- Note:Nefoundland and Labrador is not a Maritime province, it is an [[Atlantic province]] --&gt;
On the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, the Maritimes are a subregion of [[Atlantic Canada]].  The population of the Maritime provinces was 1,826,896 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/071219/d071219b.htm |title=Canada's Population Estimates |date=2007-12-19 |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maritimes front the Atlantic Ocean and its various sub-basins such as the [[Gulf of Maine]] and [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] systems.  The region is located northeast of [[New England]], southeast of [[Quebec]]'s [[Gaspé Peninsula]], and southwest of the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].

There was talk of a [[Maritime Union]] of the three provinces to have greater political power; however, the first discussions on the subject in 1864 at the [[Charlottetown Conference]] led to the process of [[Canadian Confederation]] which formed the larger Dominion of Canada instead.[[Image:Peggys Cove Harbour 01.jpg|thumb|225px|right|[[Peggys Cove]], Nova Scotia, an [[archetypal]] Maritime scene]]
[[Image:Maritimes.png|right|thumb|250px|The Maritimes]]
The Maritimes are home to [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Maliseet]] and [[Passamaquoddy]] people and have an extensive history of [[Acadians|French]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] settlement dating back to the seventeenth century, forming a unique culture that predates Canada.

==Name==
The word [[maritime]] is an adjective that simply means &quot;of the sea&quot;, thus any land associated with the sea can be considered a maritime state or province (eg. All the provinces of Canada except Alberta and Saskatchewan border the ocean).  The term &quot;Maritimes&quot; has historically been collectively applied to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.

==History==
Following the northerly retreat of glaciers at the end of the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] over ten thousand years ago, human settlement by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] or [[First Nations]] began in the Maritimes with [[Paleo-Indians]] during the ''Early Period'', ending around six thousand years ago.

The ''Middle Period'', starting six thousand years ago, and ending three thousand years ago, was dominated by rising sea levels from the melting glaciers in polar regions. This is also when what is called the ''Laurentian tradition'' started among [[Archaic Indians]], existing First Nations peoples of the time. Evidence of Archaic Indian burial mounds and other ceremonial sites existing in the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|St. John River]] valley has been uncovered.

The ''Late Period'' extended from three thousand years ago until first contact with European settlers and was dominated by the organization of First Nations peoples into the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]]-influenced [[Abenaki]] Nation which existed largely in present-day interior Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, and the Mi'kmaq Nation which inhabited all of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, eastern New Brunswick and the southern Gaspé. The primarily agrarian [[Maliseet]] Nation settled throughout the St. John River and [[Allagash River]] valleys of present-day New Brunswick and Maine. The [[Passamaquoddy]] Nation inhabited the northwestern coastal regions of the present-day [[Bay of Fundy]]. The Mi'kmaq Nation is also assumed to have crossed the present-day [[Cabot Strait]] at around this time to settle on the south coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] but were in a minority position compared to the [[Beothuk]] Nation.

===European contact===
The Maritimes was the first area in Canada to be settled by Europeans. There is speculation that [[Viking]] explorers discovered and settled in the [[Vinland|Vinland region]] around 1000 [[Anno Domini|AD]], which is when the [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] settlement in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] has been dated, and it is possible that further exploration was made into the present-day Maritimes and northeastern United States.

Both [[John Cabot|Giovanni Caboto]] (John Cabot) and [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] are reported{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} to have sailed in or near Maritime waters during their voyages of discovery for [[England]] and [[France]] respectively. Several [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers/cartographers have also documented various parts of the Maritimes, namely [[Diogo Homem]]. However, it was French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] who made the first detailed reconnaissance of the region for a European power, and in so doing, claimed the region for the King of France. Cartier was followed by nobleman [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts]] who was accompanied by explorer/cartographer [[Samuel de Champlain]] in a 1604 expedition where they established the second permanent European settlement in North America, following [[Spain|Spain's]] settlement at [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]. Champlain's settlement at [[Saint Croix Island (Maine)|Saint Croix Island]], later moved to [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port-Royal]], survived where the ill-fated English settlement at [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]] did not, and pre-dated the more successful English settlement at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] by three years. Champlain went on to greater fame as the founder of [[New France]]'s province of Canada which comprises much of the present-day lower [[St. Lawrence River]] valley in the province of [[Quebec]].

===Acadia===
Champlain's success in the region, which came to be called ''[[Acadia|Acadie]]'', led to the fertile tidal marshes surrounding the southeastern and northeastern reaches of the [[Bay of Fundy]] being populated by French immigrants who called themselves ''[[Acadians|Acadien]]''. Acadians eventually built small settlements throughout what is today mainland Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, as well as Île-Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island), Île-Royale (Cape Breton Island), and other shorelines of the Gulf of St. Lawrence in present-day Newfoundland and Labrador, and Quebec. Acadian settlements had primarily agrarian economies, although there were many early examples of Acadian fishing settlements in southwestern Nova Scotia and in Île-Royale, as well as along the south and west coasts of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], the [[Gaspé|Gaspé Peninsula]], and the present-day [[Côte-Nord]] region of Quebec. Most Acadian fishing activities were overshadowed by the comparatively enormous seasonal European fishing fleets based out of Newfoundland which took advantage of proximity to the [[Grand Banks]].

The growing English colonies along the American seaboard to the south and various European wars between England and France during the 17th and 18th centuries brought Acadia to the centre of world-scale geopolitical forces. In 1613, Virginian raiders captured Port Royale, and in 1621 Acadia was ceded to [[Scotland|Scotland's]] [[William Alexander, Earl of Stirling|Sir William Alexander]] who renamed it ''Nova Scotia''. By 1632, Acadia was returned from Scotland to France under the ''[[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1632)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]'', and the Port Royale settlement was moved to the site of nearby present-day [[Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia|Annapolis Royal]]. More French settlers, primarily from the [[Vienne]], [[Normandy|Normandie]], and [[Brittany]] regions of [[France]], continued to populate the colony of Acadia during the latter part of the 17th and early part of the 18th centuries. Important settlements also began in the [[Tantramar Marshes|Beaubassin]] region of the present-day [[Isthmus of Chignecto]], and in the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|St. John River]] valley, and settlers began to establish communities on Île-Saint-Jean and Île-Royale as well.

In 1654, [[New England]] raiders attacked Acadian settlements on the [[Annapolis Basin]], starting a period of uncertainty for Acadians throughout the English constitutional crises under [[Oliver Cromwell]], and only being properly resolved under the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] in 1667 when France's claim to the region was reaffirmed. Colonial administration by France throughout the history of Acadia was contemptuous at best. France's priorities were in settling and strengthening its claim on New France and the exploration and settlement of interior North America and the [[Mississippi River]] valley.

===British and French control===
Further French-English conflict resulted in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 which saw France formally relinquish Acadia to [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Confusion over the boundaries between Acadia, New France, and the [[Massachusetts|Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] left Britain in possession of what is the present-day [[Nova Scotia peninsula]]. The early British capital of the Colony of Nova Scotia (sometimes referred to as the ''14th Colony'') was established at Annapolis Royal, where [[Fort Anne]] was constructed.

France still maintained control over much of present-day New Brunswick and northern [[Maine]], [[Prince Edward Island|Île-Saint-Jean]], and [[Cape Breton Island|Île-Royale]]. In 1719, to further protect strategic interests in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and [[St. Lawrence River]], France began the 20-year construction of a large [[fortress]] at [[Fortress Louisbourg|Louisbourg]] on Île-Royale. Massachusetts was increasingly concerned over reports of the capabilities of this fortress, and of [[privateer]]s staging out of its harbour to raid New England fishermen on the Grand Banks. The [[War of the Austrian Succession]] saw Britain and France in conflict with each other, and in 1745 several [[warship]]s and a small contingent of troops were sent from Boston, first to the Nova Scotian fishing port of [[Canso, Nova Scotia|Canso]], and on to Louisbourg where they laid siege to the fortress until the French surrendered and were evacuated.

The British returned control of Île-Royale to France with the fortress virtually intact three years later under the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] and the French reestablished their forces there. In 1749, to counter the rising threat of Louisbourg, Halifax was founded and the [[Royal Navy]] established a major naval base and [[Citadel Hill (Fort George)|citadel]].

The British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]] happened in 1710. Over the next forty-five years the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. During this time period Acadians participated in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French Fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour.&lt;ref&gt;John Grenier, Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia 1710-1760. Oklahoma Press. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[French and Indian War]], the British sought to neutralize any military threat Acadians posed and to interrupt the vital supply lines Acadians provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E.

The Acadiensis Reader Vol 1: Atlantic Canada Before Confederation. 1998. pp.105-106.; Also see Stephen Patterson, Colonial Wars and Aboriginal Peoples, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British began the [[Expulsion of the Acadians]] with the [[Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755)]].  Over the next nine years over 12,000 Acadians were removed from Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie-Gilles LeBlanc (2005). ''Du Grand Dérangement à la Déportation: Nouvelles Perspectives Historiques'', Moncton: Université de Moncton, 465 pages ISBN 1897214022 (book in French and English). The Acadians were scattered across the Atlantic, in the Thirteen Colonies, Louisiana, Quebec, Britain and France. (See Jean-François Mouhot (2009) ''Les Réfugiés acadiens en France (1758-1785): L'Impossible Réintégration?'', Quebec, Septentrion, 456 p. ISBN 2894485131; Ernest Martin (1936) ''Les Exilés Acadiens en France et leur établissement dans le Poitou'', Paris, Hachette, 1936). Very few eventually returned to Nova Scotia (See John Mack Faragher (2005).

Norton, 562 pages ISBN 0-393-05135-8 [http://books.google.ca/books?id=dZiRciF_rbMC online excerpt]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1758, the fortress of Louisbourg was laid siege for a second time within 15 years, this time by more than 27,000 British soldiers and sailors with over 150 warships. After the French surrender, Louisbourg was thoroughly destroyed by British engineers to ensure it would never be reclaimed. With the fall of Louisbourg, French resistance in the region crumbled. British forces seized remaining French control over Acadia in the coming months, with Île-Saint-Jean falling in 1759 to British forces on their way to Quebec City for the Siege of Quebec and ensuing Battle of the Plains of Abraham.

The war ended and Britain had gained control over the entire Maritime region.

===American Revolution===
Following the [[Seven Years' War]], empty Acadian lands were settled first by [[New England Planters]] and then by immigrants brought from [[Yorkshire Emigration to Nova Scotia|Yorkshire]]. Île-Royale was renamed to Cape Breton Island and incorporated into the Colony of Nova Scotia.

Both the colonies of Nova Scotia (present-day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) and St. John's Island (Prince Edward Island) were affected by the [[American Revolutionary War]], largely by privateering against American shipping, but several coastal communities were also the targets of American raiders. Charlottetown, the capital of the new colony of St. John's Island, was ransacked in 1775 with the provincial secretary kidnapped and the Great Seal stolen. The largest military action in the Maritimes during the revolutionary war was the attack on [[Battle of Fort Cumberland|Fort Cumberland]] (the renamed [[Fort Beausejour]]) in 1776 by a force of American sympathizers led by [[Jonathan Eddy]]. The fort was partially overrun after a month-long siege, but the attackers were ultimately repelled after the arrival of British reinforcements from Halifax.

The most significant impact from this war was the settling of large numbers of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] refugees in the region, especially in Shelburne and Parrtown (Saint John). Following the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, Loyalist settlers in what would become New Brunswick persuaded British administrators to split the Colony of Nova Scotia to create the new colony of New Brunswick in 1784. At the same time, another part of the Colony of Nova Scotia, Cape Breton Island, was split off to become the Colony of Cape Breton Island.
The Colony of St. John's Island was renamed to [[Prince Edward Island]] on November 29, 1798.

The [[War of 1812]] had some affect on the shipping industry in the Maritime colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Breton Island; however, the significant [[Royal Navy]] presence in Halifax and other ports in the region prevented any serious attempts by American raiders. Maritime and American [[privateer]]s targeted unprotected shipping of both the United States and Britain respectively, further reducing trade. The American border with New Brunswick did not have any significant action during this conflict, although British forces did occupy a portion of coastal [[Maine]] at one point. The most significant incident from this war which occurred in the Maritimes was the British capture and detention of the American [[frigate]] [[USS Chesapeake (1799)|USS ''Chesapeake'']] in Halifax.

===19th century===
In 1820, the Colony of [[Cape Breton Island]] was merged back into the Colony of Nova Scotia for the second time by the British government.

British settlement of the Maritimes, as the colonies of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island came to be known, accelerated throughout the late 18th century and into the 19th century with significant immigration to the region as a result of [[Scotland|Scottish]] migrants displaced by the [[Highland Clearances]] and [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] escaping the [[Great Irish Famine|Great Irish Famine (1845-1849)]]. As a result, significant portions of the three provinces are influenced by [[Celt]]ic heritages, with [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] having been widely spoken, particularly in Cape Breton, although it is less prevalent today.

During the [[American Civil War]], some Maritimers emigrated to the United States to volunteer for the armies of the Union or the Confederacy. However, the majority of the conflict's impact was felt in the shipping industry since diplomatic tensions between [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[U.S. Northern states|Unionist North]] had deteriorated after Britain expressed support for the secessionist [[Confederate States of America|Confederate South]]. The Union navy, although much smaller than the Royal Navy, did posture off Maritime coasts at times. Although an amphibious invasion was never in question, blockading by Union naval forces was common, particularly at Halifax, where Confederate navy ships sought refuge and reprovisioning.

The immense size of the Union army (the largest on the planet toward the end of the Civil War), however, was viewed with increasing concern by Maritimers throughout the early 1860s. Another concern was the rising threat of [[Fenian]] raids on border communities in [[New Brunswick]] by those seeking to end British rule of [[Ireland]]. This combination of events, coupled with an ongoing decline in British military and economic support to the region as the Home Office favoured newer colonial endeavours in Africa and elsewhere, led to a call among Maritime politicians for a conference on [[Maritime Union]], to be held in early September, 1864 in Charlottetown - chosen in part because of Prince Edward Island's reluctance to give up its jurisdictional sovereignty in favour of uniting with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia into a single colony. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia felt that if the union conference were held in Charlottetown, they might be able to convince Island politicians to support the proposal.

The [[Charlottetown Conference]], as it came to be called, was also attended by a slew of visiting delegates from the neighbouring colony of [[United Province of Canada|Canada]], who had largely arrived at their own invitation with their own agenda. This agenda saw the conference dominated by discussions of creating an even larger union of the entire territory of [[British North America]] into a united colony. The Charlottetown Conference ended with an agreement to meet the following month in [[Quebec City]], where more formal discussions ensued, culminating with meetings in [[London]] and the signing of the [[British North America Act]]. Of the Maritime provinces, only Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were initially party to the BNA Act, Prince Edward Island's reluctance, combined with a booming agricultural and fishing export economy having led to that colony opting not to sign on.

==Major communities==
{{Main|List of communities in Nova Scotia|List of communities in New Brunswick|List of communities in Prince Edward Island}}

The major communities of the region include [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] and [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality|Sydney]] in Nova Scotia, [[Moncton]], [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], and [[Fredericton]] in New Brunswick, and [[Charlottetown]] in Prince Edward Island.

==Society and culture==
[[Image:Provinces maritimes langues.png|thumb|Mother tongue in the Maritimes.]]
[[Image:HFX Waterfront.jpg|thumb|250px||right|Halifax skyline from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia]]
Maritime society is based upon a mixture of traditions and class backgrounds. Predominantly rural until recent decades, the region traces many of its cultural activities to those rural resource-based economies of [[fishing]], [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], and [[coal mining]].

While Maritimers are predominantly of west European heritage ([[Scotland|Scottish]], [[Ireland|Irish]], [[England|English]], and [[Acadians|Acadian]]), immigration to [[Industrial Cape Breton]] during the heyday of coal mining and steel manufacturing brought people from eastern Europe as well as from Newfoundland. The Maritimes also have a [[Black Canadian|black]] population who are cultural descendants of The West Indies or are former [[African American]] runaway [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] and [[United Empire Loyalist|loyalists]], largely concentrated in Nova Scotia but also in various communities throughout southern New Brunswick, Cape Breton, and Prince Edward Island. The Mi'kmaq Nation's reserves throughout Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and eastern New Brunswick dominate aboriginal culture in the region, compared to the much smaller population of the [[Maliseet|Maliseet Nation]] in western New Brunswick.

[[Image:Sjnb-skyline.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Skyline of Saint John, New Brunswick as of Summer 2002]]
Cultural activities are fairly diverse throughout the region, with the music, dance, theatre, and literary art forms tending to follow the particular cultural heritage of specific locales. Notable Nova Scotian folklorist and cultural historian [[Helen Creighton]] spent the majority of her lifetime recording the various [[Celtic music]]al and folk traditions of rural Nova Scotia during the mid-20th century, prior to this knowledge being wiped out by mass media assimilation with the rest of North America. A fragment of [[Gaelic culture]] remains in Nova Scotia but primarily on Cape Breton Island.

[[Image:Monctonskyline 857.png|thumb|left|Skyline of Moncton, New Brunswick|300px]]
Canada has witnessed a &quot;Celtic revival&quot; in which many Maritime musicians and songs have risen to prominence in recent decades. Some companies, particularly breweries such as [[Alexander Keith's]] and [[Moosehead]] have played up a connection between folklore with alcohol consumption during their marketing campaigns. The Maritimes were among the strongest supporters of [[prohibition]] (Prince Edward Island lasting until 1949), and some predominantly rural communities maintain &quot;dry&quot; status, banning the retail sale of alcohol to this day as a vestige of the original temperance movement in the region.

==Economy==
===Present status===
[[Image:Fredericton City Hall.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Fredericton City Hall]]
Given the small population of the region (compared with the Central Canadian provinces or the New England states), the regional economy is a net exporter of natural resources, manufactured goods, and services. The regional economy has long been tied to natural resources such as fishing, logging, farming, and mining activities. Significant industrialisation in second half of the 19th century brought steel to [[Trenton, Nova Scotia]], and subsequent creation of a widespread industrial base to take advantage of the region's large underground coal deposits. After Confederation, however, this industrial base withered with technological change, and trading links to Europe and the U.S. were reduced in favour of those with Ontario and Quebec. In recent years, however, the Maritime regional economy has begun increased contributions from manufacturing again and the steady transition to a service economy.

Important manufacturing centres in the region include [[Pictou County, Nova Scotia|Pictou County]], [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]], the [[Annapolis Valley]] and the [[South Shore (Nova Scotia)|South Shore]], and the [[Strait of Canso]] area in Nova Scotia, as well as [[Summerside, Prince Edward Island|Summerside]] in Prince Edward Island, and the [[Miramichi, New Brunswick|Miramichi]] area, the [[North Shore (New Brunswick)|North Shore]] and the upper [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John River]] valley of New Brunswick.

Some predominantly coastal areas have become major tourist centres, such as parts of Prince Edward Island, Cape Breton Island, the South Shore of Nova Scotia and the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and [[Bay of Fundy]] coasts of New Brunswick. Additional service-related industries in [[information technology]], [[pharmaceuticals]], [[insurance]] and [[financial]] sectors&amp;mdash;as well as [[research]]-related spin-offs from the region's numerous universities and colleges&amp;mdash;are significant economic contributors.

Another important contribution to Nova Scotia's provincial economy is through spin-offs and royalties relating to off-shore [[petroleum]] exploration and development. Mostly concentrated on the continental shelf of the province's Atlantic coast in the vicinity of [[Sable Island, Nova Scotia|Sable Island]], exploration activities began in the 1960s and resulted in the first commercial production field for oil beginning in the 1980s. [[Natural gas]] was also discovered in the 1980s during exploration work, and this is being commercially recovered, beginning in the late 1990s. Initial optimism in Nova Scotia about the potential of off-shore resources appears to have diminished with the lack of new discoveries, although exploration work continues and is moving farther off-shore into waters on the [[continental margin]].

[[Image:Charlottetown quay.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Peakes Quay on the [[Charlottetown]] waterfront]]
Regional transportation networks have also changed significantly in recent decades with port modernizations, with new expressways and ongoing arterial highway construction, the abandonment of various low-capacity [[railway]] [[branchline]]s (including the entire railway system of Prince Edward Island and southwestern Nova Scotia), and the construction of the [[Canso Causeway]] and the [[Confederation Bridge]]. There have been airport improvements at various centres providing improved connections to markets and destinations in the rest of North America and overseas.

Improvements in infrastructure and the regional economy notwithstanding, the three provinces remain one of the poorer regions of Canada. While urban areas are growing and thriving, economic adjustments have been harsh in rural and resource-dependent communities, and emigration has been an ongoing phenomenon for some parts of the region. Another problem is seen in the lower average wages and family incomes within the region. Property values are depressed, resulting in a smaller tax base for these three provinces, particularly when compared with the national average which benefits from central and western Canadian economic growth.

This has been particularly problematic with the growth of the [[welfare state]] in Canada since the 1950s, resulting in the need to draw upon [[equalization payments]] to provide nationally-mandated social services. Since the 1990s the region has experienced an exceptionally tumultuous period in its regional economy with the collapse of large portions of the ground fishery throughout Atlantic Canada, the closing of coal mines and a steel mill on [[Cape Breton Island]], and the closure of military bases in all three provinces.

===Historical===
====Growth====
[[Image:CharlottetownConference1864.jpg|thumb|right|Delegates of the [[Charlottetown Conference]] on the steps of [[Government House (Prince Edward Island)|Government House]]]]
While the economic underperformance of the Maritime economy has been long lasting, it has not always been present. The mid-19th century, especially the 1850s and 1860s, has long been seen as a &quot;Golden Age&quot; in the Maritimes. Growth was strong, and the region had one of [[British North America]]'s most extensive manufacturing sectors. The question of why the Maritimes fell from being a centre of Canadian manufacturing to being an economic hinterland is thus a central one to the study of the region's pecuniary difficulties. The period in which the decline occurred had a great many potential culprits. In 1867 Nova Scotia and New Brunswick merged with the Canadas in [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], with Prince Edward Island joining them six years later in 1873. Canada was formed only a year after [[free trade]] with the United States (in the form of the [[Canadian-American Reciprocity Agreement|Reciprocity Agreement]]) had ended. In the 1870s [[John A. Macdonald]]'s [[National Policy]] was implemented, creating a system of protective [[tariffs]] around the new nation. Throughout the period there was also significant technological change both in the production and transportation of goods.

====Decline====
The cause of economic malaise in the Maritimes is an issue of great debate and controversy among historians, economists, and geographers. The differing opinions can approximately be divided into the &quot;structuralists,&quot; who argue that poor policy decisions are to blame, and the others, who argue that unavoidable technological and geographical factors caused the decline.

[[Image:SamuelCunard.jpg|thumb|left|Shipping magnate [[Samuel Cunard|Sir Samuel Cunard]]]]
The exact date that the Maritimes began to fall behind the rest of Canada is difficult to determine. Historian Kris Inwood places the date very early, at least in Nova Scotia, finding clear signs that the Maritimes &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the mid-nineteenth century was over by 1870, before Confederation or the National Policy could have had any significant impact. Richard Caves places the date closer to 1885. T.W. Acheson takes a similar view and provides considerable evidence that the early 1880s were in fact a booming period in Nova Scotia and this growth was only undermined towards the end of that decade. David Alexander argues that any earlier declines were simply part of the global [[Long Depression]], and that the Maritimes first fell behind the rest of Canada when the great boom period of the early twentieth century had little effect on the region. E.R. Forbes, however, emphasizes that the precipitous decline did not occur until after the [[World War I|First World War]] during the 1920s when new railway policies were implemented. Forbes also contends that significant Canadian defence spending during the [[World War II|Second World War]] favoured powerful political interests in Central Canada such as [[C.D. Howe]], when major Maritime shipyards and factories, as well as Canada's largest steel mill, located in Cape Breton Island, fared poorly.

[[Image:Yarmouth N.S 1910.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]] in 1910]]
One of the most important changes, and one that almost certainly had an effect, was the revolution in transportation that occurred at this time. The Maritimes were connected to central Canada by the [[Intercolonial Railway]] in the 1870s, removing a longstanding barrier to trade. For the first time this placed the Maritime manufacturers in direct competition with those of Central Canada. Maritime trading patterns shifted considerably from mainly trading with [[New England]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[Caribbean]], to being focused on commerce with the Canadian interior, enforced by the federal government's tariff policies.

Simultaneous with the construction of railways in the region, the age of the wooden sailing ship began to come to an end, being replaced by larger and faster steel [[steam ship]]s. The Maritimes had long been a centre for [[shipbuilding]], and this industry was hurt by the change. The larger ships were also less likely to call on the smaller population centres such as Saint John and Halifax, preferring to travel to cities like [[New York City|New York]] and [[Montreal]]. Even the [[Cunard Line]], founded by Haligonian [[Samuel Cunard]], stopped making more than a single ceremonial voyage to Halifax each year.

More controversial than the role of technology is the argument over the role of politics in the origins of the region's decline. Confederation and the tariff and railway freight policies that followed have often been blamed for having a deleterious effect on the Maritime economies. Arguments have been made that the Maritimes' poverty was caused by control over policy by Central Canada which used the national structures for its own enrichment. This was the central view of the [[Maritime Rights Movement]] of the 1920s, which advocated greater local control over the region's finances. T.W. Acheson is one of the main proponents of this theory. He notes the growth that was occurring during the early years of the National Policy in Nova Scotia demonstrates how the effects of railway fares and the tariff structure helped undermine this growth. Capitalists from Central Canada purchased the factories and industries of the Maritimes from their bankrupt local owners and proceeded to close down many of them, consolidating the industry in Central Canada.

[[Image:Corner of princess and the Water Street in Saint John NB New-Brunwick.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Princess and Water Street in Saint John]]
The policies in the early years of Confederation were designed by Central Canadian interests, and they reflected the needs of that region. The unified Canadian market and the introduction of railroads created a relative weakness in the Maritime economies. Central to this concept, according to Acheson, was the lack of metropolises in the Maritimes.

Montreal and [[Toronto]] were well suited to benefit from the development of large-scale manufacturing and extensive railway systems in [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]], these being the goals of the Macdonald and Laurier governments. In the Maritimes the situation was very different. Today New Brunswick has several mid-sized centres in Saint John, Moncton, and Fredericton but no significant population centre. Nova Scotia has a growing metropolitan area surrounding [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], but a contracting population in industrial [[Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], and several smaller centres in [[Bridgewater, Nova Scotia|Bridgewater]], [[Kentville, Nova Scotia|Kentville]], [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]], and [[Pictou County, Nova Scotia|Pictou County]]. Prince Edward Island's only significant population centres are in Charlottetown and [[Summerside, Prince Edward Island|Summerside]]. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, just the opposite was the case with little to no population concentration in major industrial centres as the predominantly rural resource-dependent Maritime economy continued on the same path as it had since European settlement on the region's shores.

Despite the region's absence of economic growth on the same scale as other parts of the nation, the Maritimes has changed markedly throughout the 20th century, partly as a result of global and national economic trends, and partly as a result of government intervention. Each sub-region within the Maritimes has developed over time to exploit different resources and expertise. Saint John became a centre of the timber trade and shipbuilding and is currently a centre for oil refining and some manufacturing. The northern New Brunswick communities of [[Edmundston]], [[Campbellton, New Brunswick|Campbellton]], [[Dalhousie, New Brunswick|Dalhousie]], [[Bathurst, New Brunswick|Bathurst]], and [[Miramichi, New Brunswick|Miramichi]] are focused on the pulp and paper industry and some mining activity. Moncton was a centre for railways and has changed its focus to becoming a multi-modal transportation centre with associated manufacturing and retail interests. The Halifax metropolitan area has come to dominate peninsular Nova Scotia as a retail and service centre, but that province's industries were spread out from the coal and steel industries of industrial [[Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]] and [[Pictou County, Nova Scotia|Pictou]] counties, the mixed farming of the North Shore and Annapolis Valley, and the fishing industry was primarily focused on the South Shore and [[Eastern Shore (Nova Scotia)|Eastern Shore]]. Prince Edward Island is largely dominated by farming, fishing, and tourism.

Given the geographic diversity of the various sub-regions within the Maritimes, policies to centralize the population and economy were not initially successful, thus Maritime factories closed while those in Ontario and Quebec prospered.

The traditional [[staples thesis]], advocated by scholars such as S.A. Saunders, looks at the resource endowments of the Maritimes and argues that it was the decline of the traditional industries of shipbuilding and fishing that led to Maritime poverty, since these processes were rooted in geography, and thus all but inevitable. Kris Inwood has revived the staples approach and looks at a number of geographic weaknesses relative to Central Canada. He repeats Acheson's argument that the region lacks major urban centres, but adds that the Maritimes were also lacking the great rivers that led to the cheap and abundant [[hydro-electric power]], key to Quebec and Ontario's urban and manufacturing development, that the extraction costs of Maritime resources were higher (particularly in the case of Cape Breton coal), and that the soils of the region were poorer and thus the agricultural sector weaker.

The Maritimes are the only provinces in Canada which entered Confederation in the 19th century and have kept their original colonial boundaries. All three provinces have the smallest land base in the country and have been forced to make do with resources within. By comparison, the former colony of the [[United Province of Canada]] (divided into the District of [[Canada East]], and the District of [[Canada West]]) and the western provinces were dozens of times larger and in some cases were expanded to take in territory formerly held in British Crown grants to companies such as the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]; in particular the November 19, 1869 sale of [[Rupert's Land]] to the Government of Canada under the ''[[Rupert's Land Act 1868]]'' was facilitated in part by Maritime taxpayers.  The economic riches of energy and natural resources held within this larger land base were only realized by other provinces during the 20th century.

One comparison made with the wealthier areas of Canada is that of the region's political and/or work culture. Today few academics make such a claim, but it still a common explanation in other circles. Some writers have also alleged that Maritime business people were unwilling to take risks or invest in manufacturing, a thesis Acheson devotes much attention to debunking.

In recent years [[dependency theory]] has been used to examine the situation of the Maritimes, and while it rejects most traditional economic models it does correspond with the evidence.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Politics==

{{Citations missing|date=February 2008}}

Maritime conservatism since the Second World War has been very much part of the [[Red Tory]] tradition, key influences being former [[Premier of Nova Scotia]] and federal [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] leader [[Robert Stanfield]] and New Brunswick Tory strategist [[Dalton Camp]].

In recent years, the [[social democracy|social democratic]] [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP) has made significant inroads both federally and provincially in the region. The NDP has elected [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) from New Brunswick, but most of the focus of the party at the federal and provincial levels is currently in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia. Industrial Cape Breton has historically been a region of labour activism, electing [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (and later NDP) MPs, and even produced many early members of the [[Communist Party of Canada]] in the pre-[[World War II]] era. In the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]], the NDP captured 28.45% of the vote in Nova Scotia, more than any other province.  In the [[Nova Scotia general election, 2009|2009 provincial election]] the NDP formed a majority government, the first in the region.

The Maritimes are generally [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] but unlike [[Alberta]], they also have fiscally [[socialism|socialist]] tendencies. It is because of the lack of support for [[fiscal conservatism]] that federal parties such as the [[Canadian Alliance]] never had much success in the region, and the level of support for the new [[Conservative Party of Canada]] in the region is uncertain. In the 2004 federal election, the Conservatives had one of the worst showings in the region for a right-wing party, going back to Confederation, with the possible exception of the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 election]].

An area within the region where both fiscal and social conservatism do coincide and where the federal [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] and Canadian Alliance have met success is in the central-western part of New Brunswick, in the St. John River valley north of Saint John and south of [[Grand Falls, New Brunswick|Grand Falls]]. Contributing demographics include a predominantly [[English language|Anglophone]] population residing in a largely rural agrarian setting. One influence might be proximity to the [[Canada-U.S. Border|International Boundary]] and the state of [[Maine]]. The valley is also settled by descendants of [[United Empire Loyalists]], some of whom established [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christian]] congregations in the area which continue to influence certain segments of society. There are also a large number of active and retired military personnel located in the Fredericton and [[Oromocto, New Brunswick|Oromocto]] area as a result of the large military base at [[CFB Gagetown]]. Another area in the region with smatterings of coinciding fiscal and social conservatism is the [[Annapolis Valley]] of Nova Scotia.

The [[Liberal Party of Canada]] has done well in the Maritimes in the past because of its [[Keynesian economics|interventionist]] policies. The Acadian Peninsula region of New Brunswick, long dependent upon seasonal employment in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] fishery, tends to vote for the Liberals or NDP for this reason. In the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 federal election]], Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]]'s Liberals endured a bitter defeat to the PCs and NDP in many ridings as a result of unpopular cuts to [[unemployment benefit]]s for seasonal workers, as well as closures of several [[Canadian Forces Base]]s, the refusal to honour a promise to rescind the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]], cutbacks to provincial [[equalization payments]], [[health care]], [[post-secondary education]] and regional transportation infrastructure such as [[airports]], fishing [[harbour]]s, [[seaport]]s, and [[rail transport|railways]]. The Liberals held onto seats in Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, while being shut out of Nova Scotia entirely, the second time in history (the only other time being the [[Canadian federal election, 1958|Diefenbaker sweep]]).

The Maritimes is currently represented in the Canadian Parliament by 25 Members of the House of Commons (Nova Scotia - 11, New Brunswick - 10, Prince Edward Island - 4) and 24 Senators (Nova Scotia and New Brunswick - 10 each, Prince Edward Island - 4). This level of representation was established at the time of Confederation when the Maritimes had a much larger proportion of the national population. The comparatively large population growth of western and central Canada during the immigration boom of the 20th century has reduced the Maritimes' proportion of the national population to less than 10%, resulting in an over-representation in Parliament, with some federal ridings having fewer than 35,000 people, compared to central and western Canada where ridings typically contain 100,000-120,000 people.

The [[Canadian Senate]] is structured along regional lines, giving an equal number of seats (24) to the Maritimes, Ontario, Quebec, and western Canada, in addition to the later entry of Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as the three territories. Enshrined in the [[Canadian Constitution|Constitution]], this model was developed to ensure that no area of the country is able to exert undue influence in the Senate. The Maritimes, with its much smaller proportion of the national population (compared to the time of Confederation) also have an over-representation in the Senate, particularly compared to the population growth of Ontario and the western provinces. This has led to [[Triple-E Senate|calls to reform the Senate]]; however, such a move would entail constitutional changes.

Another factor related to the number of Senate seats is that a constitutional amendment in the early 20th century mandated that no province can have fewer Members of Parliament than it has senators. This court decision resulted from a complaint by the Government of Prince Edward Island after that province's number of MPs was proposed to change from 4 to 3, accounting for its declining proportion of the national population at that time. When PEI entered Confederation in 1873, it was accorded 6 MPs and 4 Senators; however this was reduced to 4 MPs by the early twentieth century. Senators being appointed for life at this time, these coveted seats rarely went unfilled for a long period of time anywhere in Canada. As a result, PEI's challenge was accepted by the federal government, and its level of federal representation was secured. In the aftermath of the 1989 budget, which saw a fillibuster by Liberal Senators in attempt to kill legislation creating the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]], Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] &quot;stacked&quot; the Senate by creating additional seats in several provinces across Canada, including New Brunswick; however, there was no attempt by these provinces to increase the number of MPs to reflect this change in Senate representation.

'''Cyril of Alexandria''' (c. 376 - 444) was the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] from 412 to 444. He came to power when the city was at its height of influence and power within the [[Roman Empire]]. Cyril wrote extensively and was a leading protagonist in the [[Christological]] controversies of the later 4th and 5th centuries. He was a central figure in the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431, which led to the deposition of [[Nestorius]] as [[Patriarch of Constantinople]].

Cyril is counted among the [[Church Fathers]] and the [[Doctors of the Church]], and his reputation within the Christian world has resulted in his titles ''Pillar of Faith'' and ''Seal of all the Fathers'', but [[Theodosius II]], the [[Roman Emperor]], condemned him for behaving like a ''proud pharaoh'', and the [[Nestorian]] bishops at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] declared him a heretic, labelling him as a &quot;monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Gibbon]], ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyril is controversial because of his involvement in the expulsion of [[Novatians]] and Jews from Alexandria and the murder of the [[hellenistic philosophy|hellenistic philosopher]] [[Hypatia]]. Historians disagree over the extent of his responsibility for these events.

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] did not commemorate Saint Cyril in the [[Tridentine Calendar]]: it added his feast only in 1882, assigning to it the date of 9 February. The 1969 revision moved it to 27 June, considered to be the day of the saint's death, as celebrated by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice, 1969), pp. 95 and 116&lt;/ref&gt; The same date has been chosen for the Lutheran calendar. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Church]] celebrate his feast day on 9 June and also, together with [[Pope Athanasius I of Alexandria]], on 18 January.

== Life ==
===Early life===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2008}}
Cyril was born in 376 ''circa'', in the small town of Theodosios, Egypt, near modern day [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra]]. A few years after his birth, his maternal uncle [[Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus]] rose to the powerful position of [[Patriarch of Alexandria]]. His mother remained close to her brother and under his guidance, Cyril was well educated. His education showed through his knowledge, in his writings, of Christian writers of his day, including [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], [[Origen]], [[Didymus the Blind]], and writers of the [[Church of Alexandria]]. He received the formal education standard for his day: he studied grammar from age twelve to fourteen (390-392), rhetoric and humanities from fifteen to twenty (393-397) and finally theology and biblical studies (398-402).

===Patriarch of Alexandria===

Theophilus died on October 15, 412, and Cyril was made [[Pope of Alexandria|Pope]] or [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] on 18 October 412, against the party favouring [[Archdeacon]] Timothy.

====Persecution of the Novatians and Jews====
Thus, Cyril followed his uncle in a position that had become powerful and influential, rivalling that of the prefect in a time of turmoil and frequently violent conflict between the cosmopolitan city's [[Paganism|Pagan]], [[Jews|Jewish]], and Christian inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;library&quot;&gt;Preston Chesser, {{cite web | title=The Burning of the Library of Alexandria | url=http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/archive/articleview.cfm?aid=9}}, eHistory.com&lt;/ref&gt;

He began to exert his authority by causing the churches of the [[Novatians]] to be closed and their sacred vessels to be seized.

[[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]], ''[[Praefectus augustalis]]'' of the [[Byzantine Diocese of Egypt|Diocese of Egypt]], steadfastly resisted Cyril's agenda of ecclesiastical encroachment onto secular prerogatives.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, Cyril sent the ''grammaticus'' Hierax to secretly discover the content of an edict that Orestes was to promulgate on the mimes shows, which attracted great crowds. When the Jews, with whom Cyril had clashed before, discovered the presence of Hierax, they rioted, complaining that Hierax's presence was aimed at provoking them.&lt;ref&gt;John of Nikiu, 84.92.&lt;/ref&gt; Then Orestes had Hierax tortured in public in a theatre. This order had two aims: the first was to quell the riot, the other to mark Orestes' authority over Cyril.&lt;ref&gt;Socrates Scholasticus, vii.13.6-9. Wessel, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Christian sources, the Jews of Alexandria schemed against the Christians and killed many of them; Cyril reacted and expelled either all of the Jews, or else only the murderers, from Alexandria, actually exerting a power that belonged to the civil officer, Orestes.&lt;ref&gt;Socrates Scholasticus, vii.13 (who says that the whole Alexandrian Jewish community was expelled); John of Nikiu, 84.95-98 (who says that only the murderers were expelled). Welles, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Orestes was powerless, but nonetheless rejected Cyril's gesture of offering him a Bible, which would mean that the religious authority of Cyril would require Orestes' acquiescence in the bishop's policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;wessel35&quot;&gt;Wessel, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

This refusal almost cost Orestes his life. [[Wadi El Natrun|Nitrian monks]] came from the desert and instigated a riot against Orestes among the population of Alexandria. These monks' violence had already been used, 15 years before, by Theophilus (Cyril's uncle) against the &quot;[[Tall Brothers]]&quot;; furthermore, it is said that Cyril had spent five years among them in ascetic training. The monks assaulted Orestes and accused him of being a pagan. Orestes rejected the accusations, showing that he had been baptised by the Archbishop of Constantinople. However, the monks were not satisfied, and one of them, [[Ammonius (Alexandria 5th Century AD)|Ammonius]], threw a stone and hit Orestes in the head, and so much blood flowed out that he was covered in it. Orestes' guard, fearing to be stoned by the monks, fled leaving Orestes alone. The people of Alexandria, however, came to his help, captured Ammonius and put the monks to flight. Orestes was cured and put Ammonius under torture in a public place, killing him. The prefect then wrote to the emperor [[Theodosius II]], telling him of the events. Cyril also wrote to the Emperor, telling his version of the events. The bishop also seized the body of Ammonius and put it in a church, conferring upon him the title of ''Thaumasius'' and putting his name in the list of the martyrs. However, the Christian population of Alexandria knew that Ammonius had been killed for his assault and not for his faith, and Cyril was obliged to remain silent about the events.{{Clarify|date=June 2010}}&lt;ref name=&quot;ss7_14&quot;&gt;Socrates Scholasticus, vii.14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Murder of Hypatia====

[[File:Hypatia Raphael Sanzio detail.jpg|thumb|The Alexandrian philosopher [[Hypatia]] (detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]'', by [[Raphael]], Apostolic Palace, Rome, 1509-1510). Some Christians thought that Hypatia's influence had caused Orestes, the ''[[Praefectus augustalis]]'' of the [[Byzantine Diocese of Egypt|Diocese of Egypt]], to reject all reconciliatory offerings by Cyril. A group of Cyril's supporters killed her in the streets.]]

Prefect [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]] enjoyed the political backing of [[Hypatia]], a pagan philosopher and mathematician who had considerable moral authority in the city of Alexandria, and who had extensive influence. Indeed many students from wealthy and influential families came to Alexandria purposely to study privately with Hypatia, and many of these later attained high posts in government and the Church. Several Christians thought that Hypatia's influence had caused Orestes to reject all reconciliatory offerings by Cyril. Modern historians think that Orestes had cultivated his relationship with Hypatia to strengthen a bond with the Pagan community of Alexandria, as he had done with the Jewish one, to handle better the difficult political life of the Egyptian capital.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Haas, ''Alexandria in Late Antiquity: Topography and Social Conflict'', JHU Press, 2006, ISBN 0-8018-8541-8, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; A Christian mob possibly led by [[Parabalani]], however, grabbed Hypatia out of her chariot and brutally murdered her, hacking her body apart and burning the pieces outside the city walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;ss7_15&quot;&gt;Socrate Scolastico, vii.15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni di Nikiu, 84.88-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern studies represent Hypatia's death as the result of a struggle between two Christian factions, the moderate Orestes, supported by Hypatia, and the more rigid Cyril.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Dzielska, ''Hypatia of Alexandria'', Cambridge (Mass.): Harvard University Press, 1995. (Revealing Antiquity, 8), p. xi, 157. ISBN 0-674-43775-6&lt;/ref&gt; According to lexicographer [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], &quot;She was accused of too much familiarity with Orestes, prefect of Alexandria, and the charge spread among the clergy, who took up the notion that she interrupted the friendship of Orestes with their archbishop, Cyril.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1645.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox Christian scholar [[John Anthony McGuckin]] states: &quot;At this time Cyril is revealed as at the head of dangerously volatile forces: at their head, but not always in command of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Anthony McGuckin, Introduction to his translation of Cyril's ''On the Unity of Christ'', Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1995, p. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conflict with Nestorius====

Another major conflict was between the [[Alexandrian school|Alexandrian]] and [[Antiochian school|Antiochian]] schools of ecclesiastical reflection, piety, and discourse. This long running conflict widened with the third canon of the [[First Council of Constantinople]] which granted the see of Constantinople primacy over the older sees of Alexandria and Antioch. Thus, the struggle between the sees of Alexandria and Antioch now included Constantinople. The conflict came to a head in 428 after [[Nestorius]], who originated in Antioch, was made Archbishop of Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Donald Davis, ''The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325-787): Their History and Theology'', Collegeville (Min.): The Liturgical Press, 1983, p. 136-148. ISBN 0-8146-5616-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyril gained an opportunity to restore Alexandria's pre-eminence over both Antioch and Constantinople when an Antiochine priest who was in Constantinople at Nestorius' behest began to preach against calling [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] the &quot;Mother of God&quot;. As the term &quot;Mother of God&quot; had long been attached to Mary, the laity in Constantinople complained against the priest. Rather than repudiating the priest, Nestorius intervened on his behalf. Nestorius argued that Mary was neither a &quot;Mother of Man&quot; nor &quot;[[Theotokos|Mother of God]]&quot; as these referred to [[Christology#Person of Christ|Christ's two natures]]; rather, Mary was the &quot;Mother of Christ&quot;. Christ, according to Nestorius, was the conjunction of the Godhead with his &quot;temple&quot; (which Nestorius was fond of calling his human nature). The controversy seemed to be centered on the issue of the suffering of Christ. Cyril maintained that the Son of God or the divine Word, truly suffered &quot;in the flesh.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Gerard Weinandy, Daniel A. Keating, ''The theology of St. Cyril of Alexandria: a critical appreciation''; New York (NY); T&amp;T Clark LTD, 2003, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nestorius claimed that the Son of God was altogether incapable of suffering, even within his union with the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Nestorius, Second Epistle to Cyril http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/patristictexts/34-patrtexts/189-nestorius-to-cyril2&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius of Dorylaeum went so far as to accuse Nestorius of [[adoptionism]]. By this time, news of the controversy in the capital had reached Alexandria. At Easter 429 A.D., Cyril wrote a letter to the Egyptian monks warning them of Nestorius' views. A copy of this letter reached Constantinople where Nestorius preached a sermon against it. This began a series of letters between Cyril and Nestorius which gradually became more strident in tone. Finally, Emperor [[Theodosius II]] convoked a [[Ecumenical Councils|council]] in [[Ephesus]] to solve the dispute. Cyril selected Ephesus as the venue since it supported the veneration of Mary (a transferance from the city's pre-christian veneration of the Greek goddess Artemis). Ephesus was friendly to Cyril{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, Cyril and his supporters started the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (in 431) before Nestorius's supporters from Antioch and Syria had arrived and thus Nestorius refused to attend when summoned. Predictably, the Council ordered the deposition and exile of Nestorius for heresy. 

However, when [[John of Antioch]] and the other pro-Nestorius bishops finally reached Ephesus, they assembled their own Council, condemned Cyril for heresy, deposed him from his see, and labelled him as a ''monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Edward Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 47&lt;/ref&gt; Theodosius, by now old enough to hold power by himself, annulled the verdict of the Council and arrested Cyril, but Cyril eventually escaped. Having fled to Egypt, Cyril bribed Theodosius' courtiers, and sent a mob led by [[Dalmatius of Constantinople|Dalmatius]], a [[hermit]], to besiege Theodosius' palace, and shout abuse; the Emperor eventually gave in, sending Nestorius into minor exile (Upper Egypt).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; 
Cyril died about 444, but the controversies were to continue for decades, from the [[Second Council of Ephesus|&quot;Robber Synod&quot; of Ephesus]] (449) to the [[Fourth Ecumenical Council|Council of Chalcedon]] (451) and beyond.

==Theology==
Cyril regarded the embodiment of [[God]] in the person of [[Jesus Christ]] to be so mystically powerful that it spread out from the body of the [[God-man (mystic)|God-man]] into the rest of the race, to reconstitute human nature into a graced and deified condition of the saints, one that promised immortality and [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]] to believers. [[Nestorius]], on the other hand, saw the incarnation as primarily a moral and ethical example to the faithful, to follow in the footsteps of Jesus. Cyril's constant stress was on the simple idea that it was God who walked the streets of Nazareth (hence Mary was [[Theotokos]]  (God Bearer)), and God who had appeared in a transfigured humanity. Nestorius spoke of the distinct 'Jesus the man' and 'the divine [[Logos]]' in ways that Cyril thought were too [[dichotomous]], widening the ontological gap between man and God in a way that some of his contemporaries believed would annihilate the person of Christ.

The main issue that prompted this dispute between Cyril and Nestorius was the question which arose at the Council of Constantinople: What exactly was the being to which Mary gave birth? Cyril posited that the composition of the Trinity consisted of one divine essence (ousia) in three distinct modes of being (hypostases.) These distinct modes of being were the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Then, when the Son became flesh and entered into the world, these two divine and human natures both remained but became ''united'' in the person of Jesus. This resulted in the slogan &quot;One Nature united out of two&quot; being used to encapsulate the theological position of this Alexandrian bishop.  
 
According to Cyril's theology, there were two states for the Son: the state that existed ''prior'' to the Son (or Word/Logos) becoming enfleshed in the person of Jesus and the state that actually became enfleshed. Thus, only the Logos incarnate suffered and died on the Cross and therefore the Son was able to suffer without suffering. Cyril's concern was that there needed to be continuity of the divine subject between the Logos and the incarnate Word—and so in Jesus Christ the divine Logos was really present in the flesh and in the world.

===Mariology===
Cyril of Alexandria became noted in [[Church history]] because of his spirited fight for the title “[[Theotokos]]” during the [[First Council of Ephesus]] (431).

His writings include the homily given in Ephesus  and several other sermons.&lt;ref&gt;PG 76,992 , ''Adv. Nolentes confiteri Sanctam Virginem esse Deiparem'', PG 76, 259&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his alleged homilies are in dispute as to his authorship. In several writings, Cyril focuses on the love of Jesus to his mother. On the [[Cross]], he overcomes his pain and thinks of his mother. At the wedding in [[Cana]],  he bows to her wishes. The overwhelming merit of Cyril of Alexandria is the cementation of the centre of dogmatic mariology for all times. Cyril is credited with  creating a basis for all other [[mariology|mariological]] developments through his teaching of the blessed Virgin Mary, as the [[Mother of God]].

==In modern culture==
Cyril plays a controversial role in the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[novel]] ''[[Azazel (2008 novel)|Azazel]]'' by the Egyptian scholar [[Youssef Ziedan]]. The novel, which won the 2009 [[International Prize for Arabic Fiction]] and will be published in English under the title ''[[Beelzebub]]'', is set in 5th-century Egypt and Syria and deals with the early history of Christianity. The book has generated controversy for depicting [[religious fanaticism]] and mob violence among early Christians in [[Roman Egypt]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The narrator, Hypa, witnesses the lynching of Hypatia and finds himself involved in the schism of 431, when Cyril deposed Nestorius. Cyril is portrayed as a fanatic who kills Jews and others who have not converted to Christianity from the traditional religions of antiquity. This portrayal has angered many Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Maya Jaggi, &quot;Meeting the winner of the 'Arabic Booker',&quot; ''The Guardian'' 26 March 2009 [http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2009/mar/26/arabic-fiction-prize-youssef-ziedan/print online], archived by [http://www.webcitation.org/5fajn08nO WebCite.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyril has also been portrayed in [[Ki Longfellow]]'s ''Flow Down Like Silver, Hypatia of Alexandria''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0975925598]&lt;/ref&gt; Though Longfellow does not accuse Cyril of ordering the death of Hypatia, her work does not shy away from speculating on his part in the murder.

In the [[2009 film]] ''[[Agora (film)|Agora]]'', Cyril is played by [[Sami Samir]] as an extremist that opposes Orestes's attempts to harmonize the different communities of Alexandria.

==Works==
Cyril was a scholarly archbishop and a prolific writer. In the early years of his active life in the Church he wrote several exegeses. Among these were: ''Commentaries on the [[Old Testament]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_00_intro.htm Cyril of Alexandria, Commentary on Luke (1859) Preface. pp.i-xx]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thesaurus'', ''Discourse Against [[Arianism|Arians]]'' ''Commentary on [[Gospel of John|St. John's Gospel]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_00_eintro.htm Cyril of Alexandria, Commentary on John, LFC 43, 48 (1874/1885). Preface to the online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Dialogues on the [[Trinity]]''. In 429 as the Christological controversies increased, his output of writings was that which his opponents could not match. His writings and his theology have remained central to tradition of the Fathers and to all Orthodox to this day.

'''Cyril of Jerusalem''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] Κύριλλος Α΄ Ἱεροσολύμων) was a distinguished theologian of the early Church (ca. 313&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Michael, ed. ''Butler's Lives of the Saints.'' (HarperCollins Publishers: New York, 1991), pp 83.&lt;/ref&gt; – 386). He is venerated as a [[saint]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and the [[Anglican Communion]]. In 1883, Cyril was declared a [[Doctor of the Church]] by [[Pope Leo XIII]].

==Family and Religious Background==
It is believed that Cyril came from a family of Christian faith with both his parents being devout Christians and was immediately drawn to the Church. Most scholars believe that Cyril was born and brought up in Caesarea of Palestine but some interject that he may have been born in Jerusalem because of his early knowledge of the city's layout, but this could have been attributed to research or information he learned after moving there to become bishop. Cyril also helped a member of his family in pursuit of religious career, in 366 Cyril appointed his nephew Galesius to bishop of Caesarea.

==Life and character==
Little is known of his life before he became a bishop but some is known; the assignment of the year &quot;315&quot; for his birth rests on mere conjecture and appears to be actually closer to 313. St. Cyril was ordained a [[deacon]] by Bishop [[Macarius of Jerusalem|St. Macarius of Jerusalem]] about 335, and a [[priest]] some eight years later by Bishop [[Maximus of Jerusalem|St. Maximus]]. About the end of 350, he succeeded St. Maximus in the [[Episcopal See|See]] of Jerusalem and became its bishop.&lt;ref name = &quot;laielh&quot;&gt;*&quot;Lives of the Saints, For Every Day of the Year&quot; edited by Rev. Hugo Hoever, S.O.Cist., Ph.D., New York: Catholic Book Publishing Co., 1955, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally inclined to peace and conciliation, St. Cyril at first took a rather moderate position, distinctly averse from [[Arianism]], but (like not a few of his undoubtedly orthodox contemporaries) was by no means eager to accept the uncompromising term ''[[homoousios]]'' (ὁμοούσιος) (that is, that [[Jesus Christ]] and [[God]]  are of the &quot;same substance&quot; and are equally God). Separating from his superior, [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]], [[Acacius of Caesarea]] (a partisan of [[Arius]], who taught that Jesus was a divine being created by—and therefore inferior to—God the Father), St. Cyril took the side of the [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebians]], the &quot;right wing&quot; of the post-[[Nicene]] conciliation party, and thus got into difficulties with his superior, which were increased by Acacius's jealousy of the importance assigned to St. Cyril's See by the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]]. A council held under Acacius's influence in 358 deposed St. Cyril and forced him to retire to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] (in present-day [[Turkey]]). At that time he was officially charged with selling church property to help the poor, although the actual motivation appears to be that St. Cyril was teaching [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]], and not [[Arianism|Arian]], doctrine in his [[catechism]]. On the other hand, the conciliatory [[Council of Seleucia]] in the following year, at which St. Cyril was present, deposed Acacius. In 360 the process was reversed through the metropolitan's court influence, and Cyril suffered another year's exile from Jerusalem, until Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]]'s accession allowed him to return. The [[Arianism|Arian]] Emperor [[Valens]] banished him once more in 367. St. Cyril was able to return again, at the accession of Emperor [[Gratian]], after which he remained undisturbed until his death in 386. St. Cyril's jurisdiction over Jerusalem was expressly confirmed by the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381), at which he was present. At that council, he voted for acceptance of the term ''homooussios'', having been finally convinced that there was no better alternative.&lt;ref name = &quot;laielh&quot;/&gt;

==Appointment to Bishop of Jerusalem==
The exact date of Cyril’s appointment to Bishop of Jerusalem is not known but many believe the date to be around the early to mid part of the Fourth century. The Evidence supporting this claim comes in the form of the Catecheses by Cyril where he continually refers to himself as bishop and a letter written by Cyril to Constantius in 351 where he refers to his vision of the burning cross in the sky as his “First Fruits”. Cyril’s appointment to the Bishop of Jerusalem is also shrouded in conspiracy. Most of the rumors circle from the same source of Saint Jerome who claimed “ Cyril was an out and out Arian, was offered the see on Maximus death on the condition that he would repudiate his ordination at the hands of that Bishop”.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cyril&quot;&gt;*&quot; Yarnold, E., &amp; Cyril, . (2000). Cyril of Jerusalem. The early church fathers. London: Routledge. , p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Jerome was claiming not only that Cyril was an Arian but also involved directly or indirectly in the death of Maximus who he replaced as Bishop of Jerusalem.  Most scholars disagree with this account because Saint Jerome often made statements more entertaining than factual. Most accounts of Cyril place him in better light like Theodoret of Cyrrhus who referred to Cyril as “an earnest champion of the apostolic decrees of Nicaea and says nothing about Arian conspiracy to make him Maximus successor”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyril&quot;/&gt; Cyril was clearly held with high regard by many members of the Church and was able to sustain his place in the History of Jerusalem, despite serious charges and punishments that included banishments for years at a time from his position and his city of Jerusalem.

==Letter to Constantius==
Cyril of Jerusalem wrote a letter to Constantius in 351 discussing different aspects of the Christian faith and more interestingly discusses his dream of a burning cross. Cyril tells Constantius about his dream that contained the image of a burning cross; Cyril believed to be a sign of victory. The reason why Cyril thought this sign meant victory has been of great debate. The reasons consist of the cross appearing in the east or because the dream took place during Constantius rein but the most widely accepted version is because the cross was brighter than the sun. Cyril believed this to signify a victory of Christianity which Constantius represented over paganism which magnetius represented and used the symbol of the sun god in battle. The image of the burning cross became a part of physical life with the commission of coins by constantius containing the image of the burning cross. In the letter Cyril also urges the emperor to be baptized in fear that he may die in battle or from disease. After this urgence Cyril also discusses Matt 24 which tells the story of the end of the world when the Antichrist is to appear on earth marking the end of mankind. Cyril tells Constantius “read and re read, for his souls good the whole context and especially Matt 24, 30”.&lt;ref name = &quot;cyril&quot;&gt;*&quot; Cyril, . (1969). The works of Saint Cyril of Jerusalem. Washington: Catholic University of America Press. , p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;  Cyril was very adamant about this part of the letter showing a real belief that the end can come at any time and the importance of everyone preparing their souls for the end, so they may be ready for judgment.  Cyril also offers to perform the Emperor's baptism in Jerusalem. Many scholars believe the Letter was overly indulgent to the emperor in an effort to bring favor toward Jerusalem so that Cyril may be able to perform more charitable works and start new building projects in the City.

==Work in Jerusalem==
Cyril became well known for his charitable works in the City of Jerusalem. Cyril was known for performing some rather unorthodox or unethical actions in order to feed the poor. For example in the mid 350’s the city of Jerusalem was hit with drastic food shortages at which point church historians Sozomen and theodoret reported “Cyril secretly sold sacrament ornaments of the church and a valuable holy robe, fashioned with gold thread that the emperor Constantine had once donated for the bishop to wear when he performed the rite of Baptism”.&lt;ref name = &quot;cyril&quot;&gt;*&quot; Cyril, Drijvers, J. W. (2004). Cyril of Jerusalem: Bishop and city. Supplements to Vigiliae Christianae, v. 72. Leiden: Brill. , p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also believed Cyril sold ornaments and many imperial gifts all in the name of charity to keep his people from starving. Besides his charitable works as Bishop Cyril had many responsibilities in City life. These duties included the administration of justice with the Episcopal court, the negotiation of ransom for captures, Teaching and preaching to the masses, Converting non believers, offering spiritual guidance, maintaining political duties, and many other important duties. Cyril was constantly busy with work that ranged from giving mass to meeting with the people of his flock and not to mention making it a top priority to make sure people were not starving or being seduced by the call of false idles and religious skeptics. Luckily during the time Cyril was bishop of Jerusalem. Bishops were experiencing a rise in civic power. Constantius and his successor had expanded the power of Bishops placing them on the same level as civic elites. The evidence establishing the rise in a Bishops status comes in the form of Cyril being able to serve as a patron. This clearly shows a rise in Bishops status and power during this time period. . Being a bishop was a position that gained power because bishops and other key religious figures could withstand the constant change of government and political leaders allowing them to become an authority on the city and its political endeavors.

==Theological position==
Though his theology was at first somewhat indefinite in phraseology, he undoubtedly gave a thorough adhesion to the Nicene orthodoxy. Even if he did avoid the debatable term [[homoousian|''homooussios'']], he expressed its sense in many passages, which exclude equally [[Patripassianism]], [[Sabellianism]], and the formula &quot;there was a time when the Son was not&quot; attributed to Arius. In other points he takes the ordinary
ground of the Eastern Fathers, as in the emphasis he lays on the freedom of the will, the ''autexousion'' (αὐτεξούσιον), and his imperfect realization {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} of the factor so much more strongly brought out in the West:  sin. To him sin is the consequence of freedom, not a natural condition. The body is not the cause, but the instrument of sin. The remedy for it is repentance, on which he insists. Like many of the Eastern Fathers, he has an essentially moralistic conception of Christianity {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. His doctrine of the [[Resurrection of Christ|Resurrection]] is not quite so realistic as that of other Fathers; but his conception of the Church is decidedly empirical:  the existing catholic Church form is the true one, intended by Christ, the completion of the Church of the [[Old Testament]]. His doctrine on the [[Eucharist]] is noteworthy. If he sometimes seems to approach the symbolic view, at other times he comes very close to a strong realistic doctrine. The bread and wine are not mere elements, but the body and blood of Christ.

Cyril of Jerusalem is often renowned for his beliefs in the nature of Jesus and God. His writings are filled with the loving and forgiving nature of god which was somewhat uncommon during his time period. Many religious leaders focusing on the wrath of god instilling a fear in their members. Cyril fills his writings with great lines of the healing power of forgiveness and the Holy Spirit like “The Spirit comes gently and makes himself known by his fragrance. He is not felt as a burden for God is light, very light. Rays of light and knowledge stream before him as the Spirit approaches. The Spirit comes with the tenderness of a true friend to save, to heal, to teach, to counsel, to strengthen and to console”. Cyril truly believes in the forgiving aspect of Christianity and knows the power it holds to turn those in pain towards the light of god. Cyril himself followed Gods message of forgiveness himself many times throughout his life. Most clearly seen in his two major exiles where Cyril was disgraced and forced to leave his position and his people behind. He never wrote or showed any ill will towards those who wronged him. Cyril’s central messages also contain the primary principle of faith. Cyril new religion wasn’t about proving their divine nature or proving the existence of God but rather instilling a faith in people.  Cyril knew the power and importance of faith and tried at every opportunity to pass his faith onto others allowing them to feel the presence of the Holy Spirit and God. Through these basic teachings of the Christian Faith Cyril was able to rise as one of the most profound and admired Bishops in the churches history. The recognition goes as far as him being proclaimed a saint of the Christian Church.

==Arianism==
Much debate has lingered on the subject of Cyril’s faith. Throughout his entire career claims or [[Arianism]] continually riddle Cyril and his career. The reason Cyril was constantly surrounded with rumors of being sympathetic or downright supporting Arianism come from his appointment. When Cyril’s bishop Maximus died he was appointed by Acasius of Caesear who was himself an Arian. The appointed was due partly because Acasius respected Cyril but mostly because he felt Cyril was supportive of Arianism and he saw Cyril as an ally he could rely on for support in the future. Cyril was caught in the middle and did his best to straddle the line between being sympathetic and not actually ever showing any true support to any faith besides Christianity. Though scholars have made the issue of Cyril’s possible connection to Arianism very important it is possible the effects of being contributed with Arianism were not so profound at the time. During the time of Cyril’s position as Bishop of Jerusalem the religious temperament was one of a general religious toleration set forth by Emperor Constantius who was looking to lighten the anti Christian attitude of previous generations. So it is possible that Cyril was in fact a secret supporter of Arianism but there is no evidence to prove it. No matter what his feelings were toward Ariansim what is known for sure was that he was a devout Christian who never swayed from the teaching of Jesus and the bible. Which can be seen reflected in Cyril’s many works that stay within the realm of biblical stories and religious thought contrived from other Christian authors.

==Catechetical lectures==
His famous twenty-three [[Catechesis|catechetical lectures]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''Κατηχήσεις''), which he delivered while still a [[presbyter]] in 347 or 348, contain instructions on the principal topics of Christian faith and practise, in rather a popular than a scientific manner, full of a warm pastoral love and care for the catechumens to whom they were delivered. Each lecture is based upon a text of Scripture, and there is an abundance of Scriptural quotation throughout. After a general introduction, eighteen lectures follow for the ''competentes'', and the remaining five are addressed to the newly baptized, in preparation for the reception of [[Holy Communion]]. These last instructional addresses are called ''[[Mystagogy|mystagogic]]'' (μυσταγωγικαί), because they deal with the ''mysteries'' (μυστήρια) i.e. [[Sacraments]] of [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation]] and the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;*&quot;The Penguin Dictionary of Saints, 3rd Edition&quot;, [[Donald Attwater]] and Catherine Rachel John, New York: Peguin Putnam Inc., 1995, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel with the exposition of the [[Creed]] as it was then received in the Church of Jerusalem are vigorous polemics against [[Paganism|pagan]], [[Jewish]], and [[Christian heresy|heretical]] errors. They are of great importance for the light which they throw upon the method of instruction usual of that age, as well as upon the liturgical practises of the period, of which they give the fullest account extant.

St. Cyril's [[feast day]] is [[Commemoration (prayer)|commemorated]] on March 18.

==Catechesis XIII==
In this lecture Cyril of Jerusalem discusses the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are Original sin and Jesus’ sacrificing him to save us from our sins. Also The burial and resurrection that occurred three days later proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the father. Cyril was very adamant about the fact that Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only did he go willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes “who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten”.&lt;ref name = &quot;cyril&quot;&gt;*&quot; Cyril, Drijvers, J. W. (2004). Cyril of Jerusalem: Bishop and city. Supplements to Vigiliae Christianae, v. 72. Leiden: Brill. , p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; This line by Cyril shows his belief in the selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final act of Love. The lecture also gives a sort of insight to what Jesus may have be feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example Cyril writes “I gave my back to those who beat me and my cheeks to blows; and my face I did not shield from the shame of spitting”.&lt;ref name = &quot;cyril&quot;&gt;*&quot; Cyril, Drijvers, J. W. (2004). Cyril of Jerusalem: Bishop and city. Supplements to Vigiliae Christianae, v. 72. Leiden: Brill. , p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; This clearly reflects the teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheeks and not raising your hands against violence because violence just begets violence begets violence. The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the bible; Cyril doesn’t try to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.

==Banishment and Trouble==
Cyril of Jerusalem spent his Religious career as somewhat of a rebel he never strode from what he believed to be right and never feared the consequences of any man. The first time Cyril got in real trouble was in the mid 350s when he sold items of the church so that he could feed the starving in Jerusalem. Cyril was caught for this crime when a dancer was seen in public wearing the coat which contained gold thread a direct gift from the emperor Constantius. The person who caught Cyril was “Acacius who insisted Cyril report the sale to the synod. Cyril refused, and the synod deposed him in 357”.&lt;ref name = &quot;cyril&quot;&gt;*&quot; Di Berardino, Angelo. 1992. Encyclopedia of the early church. New York: Oxford University Press. , p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Acacius once a great ally of Cyril began to harbor feelings of aggression towards him because Cyril never became a religious ally in the fight for Arianism. Cyril was exiled from Jerusalem until 359 when imperial authority placed him back as Bishop after Cyril was able to plead his case to Emperor Constantius referencing the multitude of people who were starving and he was able to feed with the money he made from the sale... Cyril got in trouble again when he appointed his nephew to bishop of Caesarea. This was not the first time Cyril had appointed someone close to him to a high position in the church and people began to take notice. This time the person of notice was someone substantially higher: Emperor Valens. According to historians “The Emperor Valens reacted strongly to Cyril’s meddling by exiling him to Eastern Asia Minor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cyril&quot;/&gt; Cyril did not return to Jerusalem until 366 after Emperor Valens had died. Cyril was still remembered and revered by the people of Jerusalem for his charitable works and unflinching faith in God. Cyril was clearly a man of action making him a target for punishment, but his religious prowess always seemed to help him in the end. He was always welcomed back to Jerusalem by the people with open arms because of his great sense of charity and strong connection the church.

'''Hanukkah''' ({{lang-he|חֲנֻכָּה}}, Tiberian: Ḥănukkāh, nowadays usually spelled חנוכה {{IPA-he|χanuˈka|pron}} in [[Modern Hebrew]], also romanized as '''Chanukah''' or '''Chanuka'''), also known as the '''Festival of Lights''' is an eight-day [[Jewish holiday]] commemorating the rededication of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Holy Temple]] (the [[Second Temple]]) in [[Jerusalem]] at the time of the [[Maccabean Revolt]] of the 2nd century BCE. Hanukkah is observed for eight nights and days, starting on the 25th day of [[Kislev]] according to the [[Hebrew calendar]], which may occur at any time from late November to late December in the [[Gregorian calendar]].

The festival is observed by the kindling of the lights of a unique [[candelabrum]], the nine-branched ''[[Menorah (Hanukkah)|Menorah]]'' or ''Hanukiah'', one additional light on each night of the holiday, progressing to eight on the final night. The typical Menorah consists of 8 branches with an additional raised branch. The extra light is called a ''[[gabbai|shamash]]'' ([[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]]: שמש, &quot;attendant&quot; or &quot;sexton&quot;)&lt;ref name=Kotel-Notes&gt;Gateway To The Holy Land: &quot;[http://www.kotel-notes.com/holidays/hanukkah/ Hanukkah].&quot; Retrieved on September 03, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and is given a distinct location, usually above or below the rest. The purpose of the ''shamash'' is to have a light available for use, as using the Hanukkah lights themselves is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 21b&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- This paragraph is duplicated below. It does not seem to be relevant to the introduction.
Hanukkah is mentioned in the [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] or [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha books]] of [[1 Maccabees]] and [[2 Maccabees]]. 1 Maccabees states: &quot;For eight days they celebrated the rededication of the [[Altar#In the Hebrew Bible|altar]]. Then [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah]] and his brothers and the entire congregation of Israel decreed that the days of the rededication... should be observed... every year... for eight days. (1 Mac. 4:56–59)&quot; According to 2 Maccabees, &quot;the Jews celebrated joyfully for eight days as on the [[Sukkot|feast of Booths]].&quot; --&gt;

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Hanukkah&quot; derives from the Hebrew verb &quot;חנך&quot;, meaning &quot;to dedicate&quot;. On Hanukkah, the Jews regained control of Jerusalem and rededicated the Temple.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maharsha]] Shabbat 21b; see there for a detailed discussion. ({{PDFLink|1=[http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14314&amp;pgnum=390 Hebrew text]}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Many homiletical explanations have been given for the name:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://innernet.org.il/article.php?aid=11|title=Origin of the Name Chanukah|first=Nosson|last=Scherman|publisher=ArtScroll}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The name can be broken down into חנו כ&quot;ה, &quot;they rested [on the] twenty-fifth&quot;, referring to the fact that the Jews ceased fighting on the 25th day of [[Kislev]], the day on which the holiday begins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nissim of Gerona|Ran]] Shabbat 9b ({{PDFLink|1=[http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14314&amp;pgnum=542 Hebrew text]}})&lt;/ref&gt;
* חנוכה (Hanukkah) is also the Hebrew [[acronym]] for '''ח''' '''נ'''רות '''ו'''הלכה '''כ'''בית '''ה'''לל &amp;mdash; &quot;Eight candles, and the halakha is like the House of Hillel&quot;. This is a reference to the disagreement between two rabbinical schools of thought &amp;mdash; the [[Hillel the Elder|House of Hillel]] and the [[Shammai|House of Shammai]] &amp;mdash; on the proper order in which to light the Hanukkah flames. Shammai opined that eight candles should be lit on the first night, seven on the second night, and so on down to one on the last night. Hillel argued in favor of starting with one candle and lighting an additional one every night, up to eight on the eighth night. Jewish law adopted the position of Hillel.

== Historical sources ==
[[Image:Hanukkah2.jpg|thumb|150px|Hanukkah lamp unearthed near Jerusalem about 1900]]

=== Mishna ===
{{See also2|[[Mishna#Omissions|Mishna Omissions]]}}

The story of Hanukkah, along with its laws and customs, is entirely missing from the [[Mishna]] apart from several passing references (Bikkurim 1:6, Rosh HaShanah 1:3, Taanit 2:10, Megillah 3:4 and 3:6, Moed Katan 3:9, and Bava Kama 6:6).  [[Nissim Ben Jacob|Rav Nissim Gaon]] postulates in his ''Hakdamah Le'mafteach Hatalmud'' that information on the holiday was so commonplace that the Mishna felt no need to explain it. [[Reuvein Margolies]]&lt;ref&gt;''Yesod Hamishna Va'arichatah'' pp. 25–28 ({{PDFLink|1=[http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20976&amp;pgnum=24 Hebrew text]}})&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that as the Mishnah was redacted after the [[Bar Kochba revolt]], its editors were reluctant to include explicit discussion of a holiday celebrating another relatively recent revolt against a foreign ruler, for fear of antagonizing the Romans.

=== In the Talmud ===
Hanukkah is described in the [[Talmud]]. The [[Gemara]], in tractate ''Shabbat 21'', focuses on [[Shabbat]] candles and moves to Hanukkah candles and says that after the forces of Antiochus IV had been driven from the Temple, the Maccabees discovered that almost all of the ritual olive oil had been profaned. They found only a single container that was still [[seal (device)|seal]]ed by the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]], with enough oil to keep the menorah in the Temple lit for a single day. They used this, yet it burned for eight days (the time it took to have new oil pressed and made ready).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Talmud/shabbat2.html Jewishvirtuallibrary.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Talmud presents three options:
# The law requires only one light each night per household,
# A better practice is to light one light each night for each member of the household
# The most preferred practice is to vary the number of lights each night.
Except in times of danger, the lights were to be placed outside one's door, on the opposite side of the [[Mezuza]], or in the window closest to the street. [[Rashi]], in a note to ''Shabbat 21b,'' says their purpose is to publicize the miracle.

==Narrative of Josephus==
[[Image:Hanukkah1.jpg|thumb|Various menorot used for Hanukkah. 12th through 19th century, CE]]

The ancient Jewish Historian Flavius [[Josephus]] narrates in his book Jewish Antiquities XII, how the victorious Judas Maccabbeus ordered lavish yearly eight-day festivities after rededicating the Temple in Jerusalem that had been profaned by Antiochus IV Epiphanes. [[Josephus]] does not say the festival was called Hannukkah but rather the &quot;Festival of Lights&quot;:

&quot;Now Judas celebrated the festival of the restoration of the sacrifices of the temple for eight days, and omitted no sort of pleasures thereon; but he feasted them upon very rich and splendid sacrifices; and he honored God, and delighted them by hymns and psalms. Nay, they were so very glad at the revival of their customs, when, after a long time of intermission, they unexpectedly had regained the freedom of their worship, that they made it a law for their posterity, that they should keep a festival, on account of the restoration of their temple worship, for eight days. And from that time to this we celebrate this festival, and call it Lights. I suppose the reason was, because this liberty beyond our hopes appeared to us; and that thence was the name given to that festival. Judas also rebuilt the walls round about the city, and reared towers of great height against the incursions of enemies, and set guards therein. He also fortified the city Bethsura, that it might serve as a citadel against any distresses that might come from our enemies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=J.+AJ+12.287 Perseus.tufts.edu], ''Jewish Antiquities'' xii. 7, § 7, #323&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other ancient sources===
The story of Hanukkah is alluded to in the book of [[1 Maccabees]] and [[2 Maccabees]] but Hanukkah is not specially mentioned; rather, a story similar in character, and obviously older in date, is the one alluded to in 2 Maccabees 1:18 ''et seq'' according to which the relighting of the altar fire by [[Nehemiah]] was due to a miracle which occurred on the 25th of Kislev, and which appears to be given as the reason for the selection of the same date for the rededication of the altar by Judah Maccabee.

Another source is the [[Megillat Antiochus]]. This work (also known as &quot;Megillat HaHasmonaim&quot;, &quot;Megillat Hanukkah&quot; or &quot;Megillat Yevanit&quot;) is in both [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; the Hebrew version is a literal translation from the Aramaic original. Recent scholarship dates it to somewhere between the 2nd and 5th Centuries, probably in the 2nd century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Benjamin|last=Zvieli|title=The Scroll of Antiochus|url= http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/miketz/zev.html| accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Hebrew dating to the 7th century.&lt;ref name = &quot;pvgsyw&quot;&gt;[http://customerservant.com/2006/12/16/the-scroll-of-the-hasmoneans/ The Scroll Of The Hasmoneans]&lt;/ref&gt; It was published for the first time in [[Mantua]] in 1557. [[Saadia Gaon]], who translated it into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the 9th century, ascribed it to the Maccabees themselves, disputed by some, since it gives dates as so many years before the destruction of the second temple in 70 CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/miketz/zev.html The Scroll of Antiochus] and [http://www.oztorah.com/2007/11/the-unknown-chanukah-mgillah/ The Unknown Chanukah Megillah]&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew text with an English translation can be found in the [[Siddur]] of [[Philip Birnbaum]].

The Christian Bible refers to Jesus being at the Jerusalem Temple during ''&quot;the feast of the dedication and it was winter&quot;'' in ''John 10:22-23''.

==Story of Hanukkah==
[[Image:Maurice Ascalon Menorah Pal-Bell.jpg|thumb|right|Bronze [[Pal-Bell]] oil-burning Hanukkah menorah from Israel circa 1948, by [[Maurice Ascalon]].]]

=== Background ===
[[Judea]] was part of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] of Egypt until 200 [[BCE]] when King [[Antiochus III the Great]] of Syria defeated King [[Ptolemy V Epiphanes]] of Egypt at the [[Battle of Panium]]. [[Judea]] became at that moment part of the [[Seleucid Empire]] of Syria. King [[Antiochus III the Great]] wanting to conciliate his new Jewish subjects guaranteed their right to &quot;live according to their ancestral customs&quot; and to continue to practice their religion in the Temple of Jerusalem. However in 175 BCE, [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], the son of Antiochus III invaded Judea, ostensibly at the request of the sons of Tobias.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0148:book=1:section=31 Old.perseus.tufts.edu]
''Jewish War'' i. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Tobiads]], who led the [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenizing Jewish faction]] in Jerusalem, were expelled to Syria around 170 BCE when the high priest Onias and his pro-Egyptian faction wrested control from them. The exiled Tobiads lobbied Antiochus IV Epiphanes to recapture Jerusalem. As the ancient Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] tells us &quot;The king being thereto disposed beforehand, complied with them, and came upon the Jews with a great army, and took their city by force, and slew a great multitude of those that favored Ptolemy, and sent out his soldiers to plunder them without mercy. He also spoiled the temple, and put a stop to the constant practice of offering a daily sacrifice of expiation for three years and six months.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0148:book=1:section=31 Old.perseus.tufts.edu], ''Jewish War'' i. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traditional view ===
When the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem was looted and the services stopped, [[Judaism]] was effectively outlawed. In 167 BCE Antiochus ordered an altar to [[Zeus]] erected in the Temple. He banned circumcision and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0148:book=1:section=31 Old.perseus.tufts.edu], ''Jewish War'' i. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Antiochus's actions proved to be a major miscalculation as they were massively disobeyed and provoked a large-scale revolt. [[Mattathias]], a [[Kohen|Jewish priest]], and his five sons [[John Gaddi|Jochanan]], [[Simon Maccabaeus|Simeon]], [[Eleazar Maccabeus|Eleazar]], [[Jonathan Maccabaeus|Jonathan]], and [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah]] led a rebellion against Antiochus. Judah became known as Yehuda HaMakabi (&quot;Judah the Hammer&quot;). By 166 BCE Mattathias had died, and Judah took his place as leader. By 165 BCE the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid monarchy was successful. The Temple was liberated and rededicated. {{See also|Hasmonean|Menorah (Hanukkah)}}

The festival of Hanukkah was instituted by [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah Maccabee]] and his brothers to celebrate this event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hope.edu/academic/religion/bandstra/BIBLE/1MA/1MA4.HTM#59 1 Macc. iv. 59]&lt;/ref&gt; After recovering Jerusalem and the Temple, Judah ordered the Temple to be cleansed, a new altar to be built in place of the polluted one and new holy vessels to be made. According to the Talmud, olive oil was needed for the menorah in the Temple, which was required to burn throughout the night every night. The story goes that there was only enough oil to burn for one day, yet it burned for eight days, the time needed to prepare a fresh supply of oil for the menorah. Jews believe that this was a miracle. An eight day festival was declared by the Jewish sages to commemorate this miracle.

The version of the story in 1 Maccabees, on the other hand, states that an eight day celebration of songs and sacrifices was proclaimed upon re-dedication of the altar, and makes no mention of the miracle of the oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hope.edu/academic/religion/bandstra/BIBLE/1MA/1MA4.HTM#36 1 Macc. iv. 36]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of historians believe that the reason for the eight day celebration was that the first Hanukkah was in effect a belated celebration of the festivals of [[Sukkot]] and [[Shemini Atzeret]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hope.edu/academic/religion/bandstra/BIBLE/2MA/2MA10.HTM#6 Macc. x. 6] and [http://www.hope.edu/academic/religion/bandstra/BIBLE/2MA/2MA1.HTM#9 i. 9]&lt;/ref&gt; During the war the Jews were not able to celebrate Sukkot/Shemini Atzeret properly; the combined festivals also last eight days, and the Sukkot festivities featured the lighting of lamps in the Temple (Suk.v. 2–4).

It has also been noted that the number eight has special significance in Jewish theology, as representing transcendence and the Jewish People's special role in human history. Seven is the number of days of creation, that is, of completion of the material cosmos. Eight, being one step beyond seven, represents the Infinite. Hence, the Eighth Day of the Assembly festival, mentioned above, is according to Jewish Law a festival for Jews only (unlike Sukkot, when all peoples were welcome in Jerusalem). Similarly, the rite of [[brit milah]] (circumcision), which brings a Jewish male into God's Covenant, is performed on the eighth day. Hence, Hanukkah's eight days (in celebration of monotheism over Hellenistic humanism) have symbolic importance for practicing Jews.

=== Modern interpretations===
[[File:Hanukkah-US-Military-GITMO-Dec-28-08.jpg|thumb|[[US Navy]] personnel light candles on Hanukkah]]
Some modern scholars argue that the king was intervening in an internal [[civil war]] between the traditionalist Jews and the Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Jewish Literacy: The Most Important Things to Know about the Jewish Religion, Its People, and Its History|last=Telushkin |first=Joseph |year= 1991|publisher= W. Morrow|isbn= 0688085067|page=114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide|last=Johnston |first=Sarah Iles |year=2004 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=0674015177 |page= 186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Jewish Way: Living the Holidays|last= Greenberg|first=Irving |year=1993 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn= 0671873032|page= 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Judaism and the Gentile Faiths: Comparative Studies in Religion |last=Schultz |first=Joseph P. |year= 1981|publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson University Press]] |isbn= 0838617077|page= 155|quote=Modern scholarship on the other hand considers the Maccabean revolt less as an uprising against foreign oppression than as a civil war between the orthodox and reformist parties in the Jewish camp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These competed violently over who would be the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]], with traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like [[Onias III|Onias]] contesting with Hellenizing High Priests with Greek names like [[Jason (high priest)|Jason]] and [[Menelaus (High Priest)|Menelaus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A Survey of the New Testament|last=Gundry |first=Robert H. |year=2003 |publisher=[[Zondervan]] |isbn= 0310238250|page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular Jason's Hellenistic reforms would prove to be a decisive factor leading to eventual conflict within the ranks of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Judaic Religion in the Second Temple Period: Belief and Practice from the Exile to Yavneh|last= Grabbe|first=Lester L. |year= 2000|publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0415212502 |page= 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors point to possible socioeconomic reasons in addition to the religious reasons behind the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible |last=Freedman |first= David Noel|coauthors=Allen C. Myers, Astrid B. Beck|year=2000 |publisher= Wm. B. [[Eerdmans Publishing]]|isbn=0802824005 |page= 837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What began in many respects as a civil war escalated when the Hellenistic kingdom of Syria sided with the [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenizing Jews]] in their conflict with the traditionalists.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Survey of Israel's History |last=Wood |first=Leon James |year= 1986|publisher= Zondervan|isbn= 031034770X|page=357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the conflict escalated, Antiochus took the side of the Hellenizers by prohibiting the religious practices the traditionalists had rallied around. This may explain why the king, in a total departure from Seleucid practice in all other places and times, banned a traditional religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hellenistic Civilization and the Jews |last=Tcherikover |first=Victor |year= 1999|origyear=1959|publisher=Baker Academic |isbn= 0801047854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hanukkah rituals==
[[File:Donetsk hanuka.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[public menorah|Public Hanukkah menorah]] in [[Donetsk, Ukraine]]]]
Hanukkah is celebrated by a series of rituals that are performed every day throughout the 8-day holiday, some are family-based and others communal. There are special additions to the daily prayer service, and a section is added to the blessing after meals. Hanukkah is not a &quot;Sabbath-like&quot; holiday, and there is no obligation to refrain from [[39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat|activities that are forbidden on the Sabbath]], as specified in the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 670:1&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents go to work as usual, but may leave early in order to be home to kindle the lights at nightfall. There is no religious reason for schools to be closed, although, in Israel, schools close from the second day for the whole week of Hanukkah. Many families exchange gifts each night, and fried foods are eaten.

===Kindling the Hanukkah lights===
:
The single light each night for eight nights. As a universally practiced &quot;beautification&quot; of the [[mitzvah]], the number of lights lit is increased by one each night.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 671:2&lt;/ref&gt; An extra light called a ''shamash'', meaning &quot;attendant&quot; or &quot;sexton,&quot;&lt;ref name=Kotel-Notes /&gt; is also lit each night, and is given a distinct location, usually higher, lower, or to the side of the others. The purpose of the extra light is to adhere to the prohibition, specified in the Talmud (Tracate Shabbat 21b–23a), against using the Hanukkah lights for anything other than publicizing and meditating on the Hanukkah story. This differs from [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] candles which are meant to be used for illumination. Hence, if one were to need extra illumination on Hanukkah, the ''shamash'' candle would be available and one would avoid using the prohibited lights. Some light the ''shamash'' candle first and then use it to light the others.&lt;ref name = &quot;lonorw&quot;&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 673:1&lt;/ref&gt; So all together, including the ''shamash'', two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on, ending with nine on the last night, for a total of 44 (36, excluding the ''shamash'').
[[File:Carter Menorah.jpg|thumb|right|150px|United States President [[Jimmy Carter]], Hanukkah Menorah Lighting, [[President's Park|Lafayette Park]], [[Washington, D.C.]], 1979]]

The lights can be candles or oil lamps.&lt;ref name = &quot;lonorw&quot;/&gt; Electric lights are sometimes used and are acceptable in places where open flame is not permitted, such as a hospital room. Most Jewish homes have a special [[candelabrum]] or oil lamp holder for Hanukkah, which holds eight lights plus the additional ''shamash'' light.

The reason for the Hanukkah lights is not for the &quot;lighting of the house within&quot;, but rather for the &quot;illumination of the house without,&quot; so that passers-by should see it and be reminded of the holiday's miracle. Accordingly, lamps are set up at a prominent window or near the door leading to the street. It is customary amongst some Ashkenazim to have a separate menorah for each family member (customs vary), whereas most Sephardim light one for the whole household. Only when there was danger of [[Antisemitism|antisemitic persecution]] were lamps supposed to be hidden from public view, as was the case in [[Iran|Persia]] under the rule of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], or in parts of Europe before and during World War II. However, most [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] groups light lamps near an inside doorway, not necessarily in public view. According to this tradition, the lamps are placed on the opposite side from the ''[[mezuzah]]'', so that when one passes through the door he is surrounded by the holiness of ''mitzvoth''.

===Time of lighting===
Hanukkah lights should burn for at least one half hour after it gets dark. The custom of the [[Vilna Gaon]] observed by many residents of Jerusalem as the custom of the city, is to light at sundown, although most Hassidim light later, even in Jerusalem. Many Hasidic Rebbes light much later, because they fulfill the obligation of publicizing the miracle by the presence of their Hasidim when they kindle the lights. Inexpensive small wax candles sold for Hanukkah burn for approximately half an hour, so on most days this requirement can be met by lighting the candles when it is dark outside. Friday night presents a problem, however. Since candles may not be lit on the [[Shabbat]] itself, the candles must be lit before sunset. However, they must remain lit until the regular time—thirty minutes after nightfall—and inexpensive Hanukkah candles do not burn long enough to meet the requirement. A simple solution is to use longer candles, or the traditional oil lamps. In keeping with the above-stated prohibition, the Hanukkah menorah is lit first, followed by the Shabbat candles which signify its onset.

=== Blessings over the candles  ===
[[File:Bialahanukabp.JPG|thumb|150px|Rabbi Aaron Rabinowitz, the [[Biala (Hasidic dynasty)|Biala]] [[Rebbe]], lights the menorah]]
Typically three blessings (''Brachot'' singular ''Brachah'') are recited during this eight-day festival. On the first night of Hanukkah, Jews recite all three blessings; on all subsequent nights, they recite only the first two.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 676:1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The blessings are said before or after the candles are lit depending on tradition. On the first night of Hanukkah one light (candle, lamp, or electric) is lit on the right side of the Menorah, on the following night a second light is placed to the left of the first candle and so on, proceeding from right to left over the eight nights. On each night, the leftmost candle is lit first, and lighting proceeds from left to right.

For the full text of the blessings, see [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings#Hanukkah|List of Jewish prayers and blessings: Hanukkah]].

==== ''Hanerot Halalu'' ====
During or after the lights are kindled the hymn ''Hanerot Halalu'' is recited. There are several differing versions; the version presented here is recited in many Ashkenazic communities:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 676:4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Maoz Tzur'' ===
{{Main|Ma'oz Tzur}}
Each night after the lighting of the candles, while remaining within sight of the candles, some observant Ashkenazim (and, in recent decades, some Sephardim and Mizrahim in Western countries) sing the hymn ''Ma'oz Tzur'' written in Medieval [[Germany]]. The song contains six stanzas. The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in [[Jewish history]], and praises God for survival despite these tragedies ([[the exodus]] from Egypt, the [[Babylonian captivity]], the miracle of the holiday of [[Purim]], and the [[Hasmonean]] victory).

===Other customs===
After lighting the candles and Ma'oz Tzur, singing various other Hanukkah songs is customary in many Jewish homes. Various [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] and [[Sephardic Jews|Sephardic]] traditions have additional prayers that are recited both before and after lighting the Hanukkah lights. This includes the recitation of many [[Psalms]], most notably Psalms 30, 67, and 91 (many Hasidim recite Psalm 91 seven times after lighting the lamps, as was taught by the [[Baal Shem Tov]]), as well as other prayers and hymns, each congregation according to its own custom. In North America and in Israel it is common to exchange presents or give children presents at this time. In addition, many families encourage their children to give [[tzedakah]] for at least one of the nights, in lieu of presents for themselves.

=== Additions to daily prayers ===
{{quote box|align=left|width=45%|quote=&quot;We thank You also for the miraculous deeds and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and the saving acts wrought by You, as well as for the wars which You waged for our ancestors in ancient days at this season. In the days of the Hasmonean Mattathias, son of Johanan the high priest, and his sons, when the iniquitous Greco-Syrian kingdom rose up against Your people Israel, to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the ordinances of Your will, then You in your abundant mercy rose up for them in the time of their trouble, pled their cause, executed judgment, avenged their wrong, and delivered the strong into the hands of the weak, the many into the hands of few, the impure into the hands of the pure, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent ones into the hands of those occupied with Your Torah. Both unto Yourself did you make a great and holy name in Thy world, and unto Your people did You achieve a great deliverance and redemption. Whereupon your children entered the sanctuary of Your house, cleansed Your temple, purified Your sanctuary, kindled lights in Your holy courts, and appointed these eight days of Hanukkah in order to give thanks and praises unto Your holy name.&quot;|source=Translation of ''Al ha-Nissim''}}
An addition is made to the &quot;''hoda'ah''&quot; (thanksgiving) benediction in the [[Amidah]], called ''Al ha-Nissim'' (&quot;On/about the Miracles&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 682:1&lt;/ref&gt; This addition refers to the victory achieved over the Syrians by the Hasmonean Mattathias and his sons.

The same prayer is added to the grace after meals. In addition, the ''[[Hallel]]'' Psalms are sung during each morning service and the ''[[Tachanun]]'' penitential prayers are omitted. The Torah is read every day in the [[synagogue]], the first day beginning from [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 6:22 (according to some customs, Numbers 7:1), and the last day ending with Numbers 8:4. Since Hanukkah lasts eight days it includes at least one, and sometimes two, [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbaths]] (Saturdays). The weekly [[Parsha|Torah portion]] for the first Sabbath is almost always ''[[Miketz]]'', telling of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]'s dream and his enslavement in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. The ''[[Haftarah]]'' reading for the first Sabbath Hanukkah is [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 2:14–4:7. When there is a second Sabbath on Hanukkah, the ''Haftarah'' reading is from [[I Kings]] 7:40–50. The Hanukkah ''menorah'' is also kindled daily in the synagogue, at night with the blessings and in the morning without the blessings. The menorah is not lit on the Sabbath, but rather prior to the beginning of the Sabbath at night and not at all during the day.
During the [[Middle Ages]] &quot;[[Megillat Antiochus]]&quot; was read in the [[Italian Jews#Italian rite Jews|Italian]] [[synagogues]] on Hanukkah just as the [[Book of Esther]] is read on [[Purim]]. It still forms part of the liturgy of the [[Yemenite Jews]].&lt;ref name = &quot;pvgsyw&quot;/&gt;

=== ''Zot Hanukkah'' ===
The last day of Hanukkah is known as ''Zot Hanukkah'', from the verse read on this day in the synagogue (Numbers 7:84, ''Zot Chanukat Hamizbe'ach'', &quot;This was the dedication of the altar&quot;). According to the teachings of [[Kabbalah]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]], this day is the final &quot;seal&quot; of the High Holiday season of [[Yom Kippur]], and is considered a time to repent out of love for God. In this spirit, many Hasidic Jews wish each other ''Gmar chatimah tovah'' (&quot;may you be sealed totally for good&quot;), a traditional greeting for the Yom Kippur season. It is taught in Hasidic and Kabbalistic literature that this day is particularly auspicious for the fulfillment of prayers.

Generally women are exempt in Jewish law from time bound positive commandments, however the Talmud requires that women engage in the mitzvah of lighting Hanukkah candles “''for they too were involved in the miracle.''”&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud: Shabbat 23a&lt;/ref&gt; This account of Judith’s involvement with the events of Chanukah serves to explain the requirement of women to participate in the rituals of Hanukkah and the origins of the custom of eating dairy during the holiday.

==Significance==
The classical rabbis downplayed the military and nationalistic dimensions of Hanukkah, and some even interpreted the emphasis upon the story of the miracle oil as a diversion away from the struggle with empires that had led to the disastrous downfall of Jerusalem to the Romans. With the advent of Zionism and the state of Israel, these themes were reconsidered. In modern Israel, the national and military aspects of Hanukkah became, once again, more dominant.

In North America especially, Hanukkah gained increased importance with many Jewish families in the latter half of the 20th century, including large numbers of [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Jews]], who wanted a Jewish alternative to the [[Christmas]] celebrations that often overlap with Hanukkah. Though it was traditional among Ashkenazi Jews to give &quot;gelt&quot; or money coins to children during Hanukkah, in many families this has changed into gifts in order to prevent Jewish children from feeling left out of the Christmas gift giving.

While Hanukkah traditionally speaking is a relatively minor Jewish holiday, as indicated by the lack of religious restrictions on work other than a few minutes after lighting the candles, in North America, Hanukkah has taken a place equal to Passover as a symbol of Jewish identity. Both the Israeli and North American versions of Hanukkah emphasize resistance, focusing on some combination of national liberation and religious freedom as the defining meaning of the holiday.

==Hanukkah music==
{{Main|Hanukkah music}}
There are several songs associated with the festival of Hanukkah. The most well known in English-speaking countries include &quot;Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel&quot; and &quot;Chanukah, Oh Chanukah&quot;. In Israel, Hanukkah has become something of a national holiday. A large number of songs have been written on Hanukkah themes, perhaps more so than for any other Jewish holiday. Some of the best known are &quot;''Hanukkiah Li Yesh''&quot; (&quot;I Have a Hanukkah Menora&quot;), &quot;''[[Ocho Kandelikas]]''&quot; (&quot;Eight Little Candles&quot;), &quot;''Kad Katan''&quot; (&quot;A Small Jug&quot;), &quot;''S'vivon Sov Sov Sov''&quot; (&quot;Dreidel, Spin and Spin&quot;), ''Haneirot Halolu''&quot; (&quot;These Candles which we light&quot;), &quot;''Mi Yimalel''&quot; (Who can Retell&quot;) and &quot;''Ner Li, Ner Li''&quot; (&quot;I have a Candle&quot;).

==Hanukkah foods==
[[File:Chocolate-vanilla cream sufganiyot.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Sufganiyot]] / [[doughnut]]s at a Jerusalem bakery]]
There is a custom of eating foods fried or baked in oil (preferably [[olive oil]]), as the original miracle of the Hanukkah menorah involved the discovery of a small flask of pure olive oil used by the Jewish High Priest, the [[Kohen Gadol]]. This small batch of olive oil was only supposed to last one day, and instead it lasted eight.

[[File:LatkeFry.JPG|thumb|right|[[Latke]] / [[Potato pancake]] frying in olive oil]]
Accordingly, [[potato pancake]]s, known as ''latkes'' in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], are traditionally associated with Hanukkah, especially among [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] families, as they are prepared by frying in oil.

Similarly, many Sephardic, [[History of Jews in Poland|Polish]] and [[Israeli Jews|Israeli]] families have the custom of eating all kinds of jam-filled [[doughnut]]s ({{lang-yi|פאנטשקעס ''[[Pączki|pontshkes]]''}}), [[Buñuelos|bimuelos]] (fritters) and [[sufganiyah|sufganiyot]] which are [[Frying|deep-fried]] in oil. Bakeries in Israel have popularized many new types of fillings for ''sufganiyot'' besides the traditional strawberry jelly filling, including chocolate cream, vanilla cream, cappucino and others.&lt;ref&gt;Gur, Jana, ''The Book of New Israeli Food: A Culinary Journey'', pp. 238–243, Schocken (2008) ISBN 0-8052-1224-8&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there have also appeared downsized, &quot;mini&quot; ''sufganiyot''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3335737,00.html ''Hanukkah: Doughnuts go healthy''.], ynetnews.com&lt;/ref&gt; containing half the calories of the regular, 400-to-600-calorie version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1260447411124 Minsberg, Tali and Lidman, Melanie. ''Love Me Dough'']. [[Jerusalem Post]], 10 December 2009. Retrieved 17 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a tradition of eating cheese products on Hanukkah that is recorded in rabbinic literature. This custom is seen as a commemoration of the involvement of Judith and thus women in the events of Hanukkah (see [[#Judith_and_Holofernes|Judith and Holofernes]] above).

==Hanukkah games==
[[File:Colorful dreidels2.JPG|200px|right|thumb|[[Dreidel]]s / [[Top|Spinning tops]] in a Jerusalem market]]

===Dreidel===
{{Main|Dreidel}}

The ''dreidel'', or ''sevivon'' in Hebrew, is a four-sided spinning top that children play with on Hanukkah. Each side is imprinted with a Hebrew letter. These letters are an acronym for the Hebrew words נס גדול היה שם ('''''N'''es '''G'''adol '''H'''aya '''S'''ham'', &quot;A great miracle happened there&quot;), referring to the miracle of the oil that took place in the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Beit Hamikdash]].
* נ ''([[Nun (letter)|Nun]])''
* ג ''([[Gimel (letter)|Gimel]])''
* ה ''([[He (letter)|Hey]])''
* ש ''([[Shin (letter)|Shin]])''

On many dreidels sold in [[Israel]], the fourth side is inscribed with the letter פ ''([[Pe (letter)|Pe]])'', rendering the acronym נס גדול היה פה ('''''N'''es '''G'''adol '''H'''aya '''P'''o'', &quot;A great miracle happened here&quot;), referring to the fact that the miracle occurred in the land of Israel. Stores in [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] neighbourhoods sell the traditional ''Shin'' dreidels as well.

Some Jewish commentators ascribe symbolic significance to the markings on the dreidel. One commentary, for example, connects the four letters with the four exiles to which the nation of Israel was historically subject: Babylonia, Persia, Greece, and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohr.org.il/yhiy/article.php/1309 Ohr Somayach :: Chanukah :: The Secret of the Dreidel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dreidel 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Dreidel with the [[Gimel (letter)|gimel]] side up]]
After lighting the Hanukkah menorah, it is customary in many homes to play the dreidel game: Each player starts out with 10 or 15 coins (real or of chocolate), nuts, raisins, candies or other markers, and places one marker in the &quot;pot.&quot; The first player spins the dreidel, and depending on which side the dreidel falls on, either wins a marker from the pot or gives up part of his stash. The code (based on a [[Yiddish Language|Yiddish]] version of the game) is as follows:

* Nun–''nisht'', &quot;nothing&quot;–nothing happens and the next player spins
* Gimel–''gants'', &quot;all&quot;–the player takes the entire pot
* Hey–''halb'', &quot;half&quot;–the player takes half of the pot, rounding up if there is an odd number
* Shin–''shtel ayn'', &quot;put in&quot;–the player puts one marker in the pot

Another version differs:
* Nun–''nim'', &quot;take&quot;–the player takes one from the pot
* Gimel–''gib'', &quot;give&quot;–the player puts one in the pot
* Hey–''halb'', &quot;half&quot;–the player takes half of the pot, rounding up if there is an odd number
* Shin–''shtil'', &quot;still&quot; (as in &quot;stillness&quot;)–nothing happens and the next player spins

The game may last until one person has won everything.

Some say the dreidel game is played to commemorate a game devised by the Jews to camouflage the fact that they were [[Torah study|studying Torah]], which was outlawed by Greeks. The Jews would gather in caves to study, posting a lookout to alert the group to the presence of Greek soldiers. If soldiers were spotted, the Jews would hide their scrolls and spin tops, so the Greeks thought they were gambling, not learning.

===Hanukkah gelt===
{{Main|Hanukkah gelt}}
[[Hanukkah gelt]] ([[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] for &quot;money&quot;) is often distributed to children to enhance their enjoyment of the holiday. The amount is usually in small coins, although grandparents or other relatives may give larger sums as an official Hanukkah gift. In Israel, Hanukkah ''gelt'' is known as ''dmei Hanukkah''. Many Hasidic [[Rebbe]]s distribute coins to those who visit them during Hanukkah. Hasidic Jews consider this to be an auspicious blessing from the Rebbe, and a ''[[segulah]]'' for success. Rabbi Abraham P. Bloch has written that “''The tradition of giving money (Chanukah gelt) to children is of long standing. The custom had its origin in the seventeenth-century practice of Polish Jewry to give money to their small children for distribution to their teachers. In time, as children demanded their due, money was also given to children to keep for themselves. Teen-age boys soon came in for their share. According to [[Magen Avraham]] (18th cent.), it was the custom for poor yeshiva students to visit homes of Jewish benefactors who dispensed Chanukah money (Orach Chaim 670). The rabbis approved of the custom of giving money on Chanukah because it publicized the story of the miracle of the oil.''”&lt;ref&gt;The Biblical and Historical Background of Jewish Customs and Ceremonies by Abraham P. Bloch. Published by KTAV Publishing House, Inc., 1980. Pp. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; 20th century [[United States|American]] [[chocolatier]]s picked up on the gift/coin concept by creating [[chocolate money|chocolate ''gelt'']].

==Judith and Holofernes==
[[File:Cristofano Allori 002.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Judith with the head of Holofernes'' by [[Cristofano Allori]]]]
The eating of dairy foods, especially cheese, on Hanukkah is a minor custom that has its roots in the story of Judith. The [[deuterocanonical]] book of [[Judith]] (Yehudit or Yehudis in Hebrew), which is not part of the [[Tanach]], records that, [[Holofernes]], an Assyrian general, had surrounded the village of Bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer Judea. After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews is cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps and pretended to surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. She went back to his tent with him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her (the [[Judith and Holofernes|beheading of Holofernes by Judith]] has historically been a popular theme in art). When Holofernes' soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened, and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated. There is a longstanding Jewish tradition that Judith was the daughter of Yochanan the [[Kohen Gadol]] (and consequently a sister of Mattathias the Hasmonean and an aunt of Judah the Maccabee). In the [[Rema]]'s gloss on the [[Shulchan Aruch]] he writes “''There are authorities (Kol Bo and the [[Nissim of Gerona|RaN]]) who say that one should eat cheese on Hanukkah, because the miracle was performed with milk that Judith fed the enemy.''”&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rema]] on [[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 670:2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chofetz Chaim]] there adds in his [[Mishna Berurah]] on the words “'''''that Judith fed''''',” “''She was the daughter of Yochanan, the Kohen Gadol. There was a decree that every espoused bride should submit to the dignitary first before the consummation of her marriage. She fed cheese to the head of the oppressors in order to intoxicate him and cut his head and they all fled.''”&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mishna Berurah]]'' 670:2:10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative spellings ==
[[Image:Hanukkah.png|thumb|150px|Spelling variations due to transliteration of Hebrew ''Chet Nun Vav Kaf Hey'']]
In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the word Hanukkah is written '''{{lang|he|חנֻכה}}''' or '''{{lang|he|חנוכה}}''' (Ḥǎnukkâh). It is most commonly transliterated to English as ''Chanukah'' or ''Hanukkah'', the former because the sound represented by &quot;CH&quot; ({{IPA|[χ]}}, similar to the [[Scots language|Scottish]] pronunciation of &quot;[[loch]]&quot;) does not exist in the English language. Furthermore, the letter &quot;[[heth|chet]]&quot; ('''{{lang|he|ח}}'''), which is the first letter in the Hebrew spelling, is pronounced differently in modern Hebrew ([[voiceless uvular fricative]]) than in classical Hebrew ([[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]]), and neither of those sounds is unambiguously representable in English spelling. Moreover, the 'kaf' consonant is [[geminate]] in classical (but not modern) Hebrew. Adapting the classical Hebrew pronunciation with the geminate and pharyngeal Ḥeth can lead to the spelling &quot;Hanukkah&quot;; while adapting the modern Hebrew pronunciation with no gemination and uvular Ḥeth leads to the spelling &quot;Chanukah&quot;.

In ''Simple''(6,74) ''English''(7,74) ''Gematria''(8,74) there are two codes being dealt with: [1] the number of letters in a word, name, or phrase is significant, i.e. Hanukkah(8)/Chanukah(8) and ''Passover''(8) are each an eight-day(8) festival(8) and [2] the sum of the most basic letter-number substitution is significant using ''the key''(74) of A=1...Z=26, i.e. Jewish=74 Hanukkah=75 Menorah=74.

==Hanukkah in the White House==
[[File:Truman receives menorah.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Harry S. Truman]] in the [[Oval Office]], receiving a Hanukkah Menorah as a gift from the Prime Minister of Israel, [[David Ben-Gurion]] (center). To the right is [[Abba Eban]], the Ambassador of Israel to the United States.]]{{Main|White House Hanukkah Party}}The United States has a history of recognizing and celebrating Hanukkah in a number of ways, from menorah lighting ceremonies to a 1996 postage stamp, jointly issued with Israel, to special receptions in the White House (although the United States has not had any Jewish presidents).

One of the earliest links with the White House occurred in 1951, when Israeli Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] presented United States President [[Harry Truman]] with a Hanukkah Menorah. But it was not until 1979 that a sitting president, [[Jimmy Carter]] took part in a public Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony on the [[National Mall]], followed by the first Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony in the [[White House]] itself, led by President [[Bill Clinton]].

In 2001, President [[George W. Bush]] held an official Hanukkah reception in the White House in conjunction with the candle-lighting ceremony, and since then this ceremony has become an annual tradition attended by Jewish leaders from around the country. In 2008, George Bush linked the occasion to the 1951 gift by using that menorah for the ceremony, with a grandson of Ben-Gurion and a grandson of Truman lighting the candles.

==Green Hanukkah==
Some Jews in North America and Israel have taken up environmental concerns in relation to Hanukkah's &quot;miracle of the oil&quot;, emphasizing reflection on [[energy conservation]] and [[North American energy independence|energy independence]]. An example of this is the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life's renewable energy campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theshalomcenter.org/node/1315 Shalom Center on Hannukah and the environment]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1195546797524&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Jerusalem Post: Green Hanukkia' campaign sparks ire]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coejl.org/climatechange/CFLceremony.php Coalition on Environment and Jewish Life (COEJL): Green Hannukah ceremony]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Hanukkah==
[[Christopher Hitchens]] has referred to Hanukkah as a celebration of the &quot;triumph of tribal Jewish backwardness&quot; and an &quot;explicit celebration of the original victory of bloody-minded faith over enlightenment and reason.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hitchens&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2179045/|title=Bah, Hanukkah|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Hitchens|date=12-03-07|accessdate=03-16-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Pukirev ner brak.jpg|thumb|Orthodox betrothal depicted by [[Vasily Vladimirovich Pukirev]], 1862.]]

'''[[Christian]] views on [[marriage]]''' typically regard it as instituted and ordained by [[God in Christianity|God]] for the lifelong relationship between one [[man]] as husband and one [[woman]] as wife, and is to be &quot;held in honour  among all....&quot;{{bibleref2c|Heb|13:4}}

Civil laws recognize marriage as having social and political status. Christian theology affirms the [[secular]] status of marriage, but additionally views it from a moral and religious perspective that transcends all social interests. 

While marriage is honored among Christians and throughout the Bible, it is not seen as necessary for everyone. Single people who either have chosen to remain unmarried or who have lost their spouse for some reason are neither incomplete in Christ nor personal failures. There is no suggestion that [[Jesus]] was ever married.

[[Divorce]] or dissolution of marriage is generally seen from a Christian perspective as less than the ideal, with specific opinions ranging from it being universally wrong to the notion that it sometimes is inevitable.

The [[Bible]] holds that [[Christian views on marriage#The New Testament and sexual conduct|sex is reserved for marriage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Staggs&quot; /&gt; It says that sex outside of marriage is the sin of adultery (for the married person) if ''either'' sexual participant is married to another person. Voluntary sexual intercourse between persons not married to each other is considered the sin of fornication. 

Ideas about roles and responsibilities of the husband and wife is the long-held male-dominant/female-submission view.

A small but growing number of Christian denominations conduct [[gay marriage|weddings between same sex couples]] where it is civilly legal. A few others perform ceremonies to bless same sex unions without recognising them as marriage. 
== Biblical foundations ==

Christians believe that marriage is considered in its ideal according to the purpose of God. At the heart of God's design for marriage is companionship and intimacy. According to Genesis, marriage was instituted by God in the Garden of Eden.

{{quotation|The Lord God said, &quot;It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper  suitable for him&quot;...and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and  closed up the place with flesh.

Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib&lt;sup&gt;or &quot;side&quot;&lt;/sup&gt; he had taken out of the man, and  he brought her to the man. The man said, &quot;This is now bone of my bones and flesh  of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man.&quot; For  this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.|{{Bibleref2|Genesis|2:18,21-24|NIV}}}}

The biblical picture of marriage expands into something much broader, with the husband and wife relationship illustrating the relationship between Christ and the church. 

It is also considered in its actual occurrence, sometimes involving failure. Therefore, the Bible speaks on the subject of divorce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Staggs&quot; /&gt; The New Testament recognizes a place for singleness. Salvation within Christianity is not dependent on the continuation of a biological lineage.&lt;ref name=&quot;EOC&quot; /&gt;

=== Old Testament ===

Christians regard the foundational principle of the lifelong union of a man and a woman to have been first articulated biblically in the [[Book of Genesis]].

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 146.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Rembrandt's depiction of Samson's marriage feast]]

The [[Old Testament]] describes a number of marriages, some of the best known being [[Adam]] and [[Eve]],{{Bibleref2c|Gen|2:15–3:13}} [[Abraham]] and [[Sarah]],{{Bibleref2c-nb|Gen|17:1–8,15-22}} {{Bibleref2c-nb|Gen|21:1–7}} [[Isaac]] and [[Rebekah]],{{Bibleref2c-nb|Gen|24:24–67}} Jacob and Rachel,{{Bibleref2c-nb|Gen|29:1–30}} [[Boaz]] and [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]],{{Bibleref2c|Ruth|2:1–13}} {{Bibleref2c-nb|Ruth|4:1–17}} [[David]] and [[Abigail]],{{Bibleref2c|1Sam|25:14–42|NIV|1 Sam 25:14–42}} and [[Hosea]] and [[Gomer (wife of Hosea)|Gomer]].{{Bibleref2c|Hosea|1,3}} [[Polygyny]], or men having multiple wives at once, is one of the most common marital arrangements represented in the Old Testament,&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot;&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=marriage|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=M&amp;artid=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet scholars doubt that it was common among average Israelites because of the wealth needed to practice it.&lt;ref&gt;Gene McAfee  [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t120.e0669 &quot;Sex&quot;]  The Oxford Companion to the Bible. Bruce M. Metzger and Michael D. Coogan, eds. Oxford University Press Inc. 1993. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 19 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Betrothal (''[[erusin]]''), which is merely a binding promise to get married, is distinct from marriage itself (''[[nissuin|nissu'in]]''), with the time between these events varying substantially.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot;&gt;{{EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=Marriage|section=Manius-Mash}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a wife was regarded as property in biblical times, the betrothal (''erusin'') was effected simply by purchasing her from her father (or [[parental guardian|guardian]]);&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt; the girl’s consent is not explicitly required by any biblical law.&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt; Like the adjacent Arabic culture ([[Pre-Islamic Arabia|in the pre-Islamic period]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[William Robertson Smith]], ''Kinship and Marriage in early Arabia'', (1885), 81&lt;/ref&gt; the act of marriage appears mainly to have consisted of the groom fetching the bride, although among the [[Israelites]] (unlike the Arabs) the procession was a festive occasion, accompanied by music, dancing, and lights.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt; To celebrate the marriage, week-long feasts were sometimes held.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt;

In biblical times, a wife was regarded as [[chattel]], belonging to her husband.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt; The descriptions of the bible suggest that she would be expected to perform tasks such as spinning, sewing, weaving, manufacture of clothing, fetching of water, baking of bread, and [[animal husbandry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Genesis|29:9}}; {{bibleref2|Exodus|2:16}};{{Bibleref2|1|Samuel|2:19||1 Samuel 2:19}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Sam|8:13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, wives were usually looked after with care, and [[bigamy|bigamous]] men were expected to ensure that they give their first wife food, clothing, and sexual activity.{{bibleref2c|Ex|21:10}}

Since a wife was regarded as property, her husband was originally free to divorce her for any reason, at any time.&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt; A divorced couple were permitted to get back together unless the wife had married someone else after her divorce.{{bibleref2c|Deut|24:2–4}}

=== Jesus and the Gospels ===

[[File:Christian-Marriage-Symbol.jpg|thumb|150x|Sometimes used as a [[symbol]] for Christian marriage: Two gold wedding rings interlinked with the Greek letters ''[[Chi (letter)|chi]]'' (X) and ''[[Rho (letter)|rho]]'' (P)—the first two letters in the Greek word for &quot;Christ&quot; (see [[Labarum]])]]

{{Quotation|Have you not read that at the beginning the Creator &quot;made them male and female,&quot; and said, &quot;For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh&quot;? So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate.|{{Bibleref2|Matthew|19:4–6||Matthew 19:4–6; also Mk 10:7–9}}}}

In both Matthew and Mark, Jesus appealed to God's will in creation. He builds upon the narrative in {{Bibleref2|Genesis|1:27}} and {{Bibleref2-nb|Genesis|5:2}} where male and female are created together and for one another. Thus Jesus takes a firm stand on the permanence of marriage in the original will of God. This corresponds closely with the position of the Pharisee school of thought led by [[Shammai]], at the start of the first millennium,&lt;ref name=&quot;Git910&quot;&gt;''[[Gittin]]'' 9:10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sotah]]'' ([[Palestinian Talmud]] only), 1:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sotah'' (Palestinian Talmud only), 1:16b&lt;/ref&gt; with which Jesus would have been familiar. By contrast, Judaism subsequently took the opposite view, espoused by [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]], the leader of the other major Pharisee school of thought at the time; in Hillel's view, men were allowed to divorce their wives for any reason.&lt;ref name=&quot;Git910&quot; /&gt;

Where there was failure in the marriage, Jesus found husband and wife equally responsible. The two are joined together by God so that &quot;they are no longer two, but one.&quot; He brought together two passages from Genesis, reinforcing the basic position on marriage found in Jewish scripture. Thus, he implicitly emphasized that it is God-made (&quot;God has joined together&quot;), &quot;male and female,&quot; lifelong (&quot;let no one separate&quot;), and monogamous (&quot;a man...his wife&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Stagg, Frank]]. ''New Testament Theology.'' Broadman Press, 1962. ISBN 0-8054-1613-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jesus]] used the image of marriage and the family to teach the basics about the kingdom of God. He inaugurated his ministry by blessing the [[Marriage at Cana|wedding feast at Cana]]. In the [[Sermon on the Mount]] he set forth a new commandment concerning marriage, teaching that lustful looking constitutes adultery. He also superseded a Mosaic Law allowing divorce with his teaching that &quot;…anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{Bibleref2|Matthew|5:32}}, {{Bibleref2|Matthew|19:19}}, {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:11}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|16:18}}. Similar Pauline teachings in {{Bibleref2|1cor|7:10–11|ESV|1&amp;nbsp;Corinthians 7:10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no evidence that Jesus himself ever married, and considerable evidence that he remained single. In contrast to Judaism and many other traditions,&lt;ref name=&quot;EOC&quot;&gt;Fahlbusch, Erwin and Geoffrey Bromiley. ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity.&quot; Brill Academic Publishers (November 2000). ISBN 9004116958.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.283}} he taught that there is a place for voluntary singleness in Christian service. He believed marriage could be a distraction from an urgent mission.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong,Karen. ''The Gospel according to women: Christianity's creation of the sex war in the west,'' Anchor Books, 1991. ISBN 978-0385240796&lt;/ref&gt; 

He believed he was living in a time of crisis and urgency where the Kingdom of God would be established where there would be no marriage nor giving in marriage. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;I tell you the truth,&quot; Jesus said to them, &quot;no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life.&quot;|{{bibleref2|Luke|18:29–30}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== New Testament beyond the Gospels ===

The [[Saint Paul|Apostle Paul]] quoted passages from Genesis almost verbatim in two of his New Testament books. He used marriage not only to describe the kingdom of God, as Jesus had done, but to define also the nature of the 1st century Christian church. His [[theology|theological view]] was a Christian development of the [[Old Testament]] parallel between marriage and the relationship between God and [[Israel]]. He analogized the church as a bride and Christ as the bridegroom─drawing parallels between Christian marriage and the relationship between Christ and the [[Christian Church|Church]].

[[Image:PaulT.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Saint Paul Writing His Epistles'', 16th century.]]

Both Jesus and Paul seem to provide &quot;exceptions&quot; to marriage as being its ideal according to the purpose of God because of extraordinary circumstances (&quot;because of the impending crisis&quot;), see also [[Pauline privilege]]. Their concerns were that marriage might be a distraction from the work of discipleship.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio, Julie Hanlon. ''A Christian Theology of Marriage and Family.'' Paulist Press, 2003. ISBN 0809141183.&lt;/ref&gt;

It remains unclear if Paul was even himself married. Some scholars have speculated that he may have been a widower since he was a [[Pharisees|Pharisee]] and member of the [[Sanhedrin]], positions in which the social norm of the day required the men to be married. But it's just as likely that he never married at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams&quot;&gt;Adams, Jay E. ''Marriage, Divorce, and Remarriage in the Bible,'' Zondervan, 1986, ISBN 0310511119&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, Paul acknowledges the mutuality of marital relations, and recognises that his own singleness is &quot;a particular gift from God&quot; that others may not necessarily have. &quot;Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.&quot;{{Bibleref2c|1Co|7:8||1&amp;nbsp;Cor 7:8}}

=== The New Testament and sexual conduct===

The New Testament holds that sex is reserved for marriage, according to classicist [[Evelyn Stagg]] and New Testament scholar [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Staggs&quot; /&gt; They maintain that the New Testament teaches that sex outside of marriage is a sin of [[adultery]] if either sexual participant is married, otherwise the sin of [[Porneia|fornication]] if both sexual participants are unmarried. An imperative given in 1&amp;nbsp;Corinthians says, &quot;Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins people commit are outside their bodies, but those who sin  sexually sin against their own bodies.&quot;{{Bibleref2c|1Co|6:18|TNIV|1 Cor 6:18}} Those who are sexually immoral or adulterers are listed in {{Bibleref2|1Cor|6:9|NIV|1&amp;nbsp;Corinthians 6:9}} in a list of &quot;wrongdoers who...will not inherit the kingdom of God.&quot; {{Bibleref2|Galatians|5:19}} and {{Bibleref2|1Cor|7:2|NIV|1&amp;nbsp;Corinthians 7:2}} also address ''fornication''. The ''Apostolic Decree'' of the [[Council of Jerusalem]] also includes a prohibition of ''fornication''.

== Marriage and early Church Fathers ==

Building on the example of Jesus and Paul, [[Christianity in the 1st century|first-century Christians]] placed less value on the family, and rather saw [[celibacy]] and freedom from family ties as a preferable state. 

[[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers|Nicene Fathers]] such as [[Augustine]] believed that marriage was a sacrament because it was a symbol used by Paul to express Christ's love of the Church. However, there was also an apocalyptic dimension in his teaching, and he was clear that if everybody stopped marrying and having children that would be an admirable thing; it would mean that the [[Kingdom of God]] would return all the sooner and the [[End times|world would come to an end]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong&quot;&gt;Armstrong, Karen. ''Gospel According to Women.'' Anchor Books, 1991. ISBN 978-0385240796&lt;/ref&gt; Such a view reflects the [[Manichaean]] past of Augustine.

Both [[Tertullian]] and Gregory of Nyssa were church fathers who were married. They each stressed that the happiness of marriage was ultimately rooted in misery. They saw marriage as a state of bondage that could only be cured by celibacy. They wrote that at the very least, the virgin woman could expect release from the &quot;governance of a husband and the chains of children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Scholer, David M.''Women in early Christianity.''

Garland Publishing, 1993. ISBN 9780815310747&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.151}} [[Tertullian]] argued that marriage &quot;consists essentially in fornication.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. &quot;An Exhortation to Chastity.&quot; ''ANF,'' v. 4, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Church Fathers|Fathers of the Church]] advocated celibacy and virginity as preferable alternatives to marriage. [[Jerome]] wrote: &quot;It is not disparaging wedlock to prefer virginity. No one can make a comparison between two things if one is good and the other evil.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter 22.{{clarify|date=February 2011}}&lt;!-- What source is this? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; St. [[John Chrysostom]] wrote: &quot;...virginity is better than marriage, however good.... Celibacy is...an imitation of the angels. Therefore, virginity is as much more honorable than marriage, as the angel is higher than man. But why do I say angel? Christ, Himself, is the glory of virginity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;St. John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on First Corinthians, NPNF, s. 1, v. 12, pp. 248–262&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyprian]], Bishop of Carthage, said that the first commandment given to men was to increase and multiply, but now that the earth was full there was no need to continue this process of multiplication.&lt;ref&gt;St. Cyprian, &quot;Of the Discipline and Advantage of Chastity,&quot; ''ANF,'' v. 5, p.1251.&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of marriage was reflected in the lack of any formal [[liturgy]] formulated for marriage in the [[Early Christianity|early Church]]. No special ceremonial was devised to celebrate Christian marriage—despite the fact that the Church had produced liturgies to celebrate the [[Eucharist]], [[Baptism]] and [[Confirmation]]. It was not important for a couple to have their nuptials blessed by a [[priest]]. People could marry by mutual agreement in the presence of witnesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong&quot; /&gt;

At first, the old Roman pagan rite was used by Christians, although modified superficially. The first detailed account of a Christian wedding in the West dates from the [[Christianity in the 9th century|9th century]]. This system, known as Spousals, persisted after the [[Reformation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong&quot; /&gt;

== View of Catholic Church ==
{{Main|Catholic marriage}}
[[Image:Pietro Longhi 007.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Catholic couple at their Holy Matrimony or marriage. In the [[Latin rite|Latin rite of the Catholic Church]], during the celebration the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] imposes his [[stole (vestment)|liturgical stole]] upon the couple's hands, as a sign to confirm the marriage bond.]]

The [[Catholic Church]] teaches that God Himself is the author of the sacred institution of marriage, which is His way of showing love for those He created. Marriage is a divine institution that can never be broken, even if the husband or wife legally divorce in the civil courts; as long as they are both alive, the Church considers them bound together by God.  Holy Matrimony is another name for sacramental marriage.

Marriage is intended to be a faithful, exclusive, lifelong union of a man and a woman. Committing themselves completely to each other, a Catholic husband and wife strive to sanctify each other, bring children into the world, and educate them in the Catholic way of life. Man and woman, although created differently from each other, complement each other. This complementarity draws them together in a mutually loving union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|editor=[[Vatican Publishing House|Libreria Editrice Vaticana]]|accessdate=2009-07-22|pages=1602–1605|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P51.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The valid marriage of baptized Christians is one of the seven [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Catholic sacraments]]. The sacrament of marriage is the only sacrament that a priest does not administer directly; a priest, however, is the chief witnesses of the husband and wife's administration of the sacrament to each other at the wedding ceremony in a Catholic church.

The Catholic Church views that Christ Himself established the sacrament of marriage at the [[Marriage at Cana|wedding feast of Cana]]; therefore, since it is a divine institution, neither the Church nor state can alter the basic meaning and structure of marriage. Husband and wife give themselves totally to each other in a union that lasts until death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|editor=[[Vatican Publishing House|Libreria Editrice Vaticana]]|accessdate=2009-07-22|page=1643|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P55.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Arberesh Byzantine Catholic wedding.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Arbëreshë]] [[Albanians|Albanian]] couple during marriage in an [[Italo-Greek Catholic Church]] rite.]]

[[Priest]]s are to remember that marriage is part of God's natural law and to support the couple if they do choose to marry. Today it is common for Catholics to enter into a &quot;mixed marriage&quot; between a Catholic and a baptized non-Catholic. Couples entering into a mixed marriage are usually allowed to marry in a Catholic church provided their decision is of their own accord and they intend to remain together for life, to be faithful to each other, and to have children which are brought up in the Catholic faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|editor=[[Vatican Publishing House|Libreria Editrice Vaticana]]|accessdate=2009-07-22|pages=1633–1637|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P53.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lokajski - Ślub powstańczej pary (1944).jpg|thumb|left|160px|During the [[Warsaw Uprising]] (1944), a [[Poles|Polish]] couple, members of an [[Armia Krajowa]] resistance group, are married in a secret Catholic chapel in a street in [[Warsaw]].]]

In Catholicism, marriage has two ends:  the good of the spouses themselves, and the procreation and education of children (1983 code of canon law, c.1055; 1994 catechism, par.2363).  Hence &quot;entering marriage with the intention of never having children is a grave wrong and more than likely grounds for an [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulment]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, P. &quot;Sacrament of Holy Matrimony.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is normal procedure for a priest to ask the prospective bride and groom about their plans to have children before officiating at their wedding. The Catholic Church may refuse to marry anyone unwilling to have children, since procreation by &quot;the marriage act&quot; is a fundamental part of marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;humanae_vitae&quot;&gt;[[Pope Paul VI]].&quot;Humanæ Vitæ.&quot; 1968-7-25. Accessed: 2009-7-22&lt;/ref&gt; Thus usage of any form of [[contraception]], [[in vitro fertilization]], or [[birth control]] besides [[Natural Family Planning]] is a grave offense against the sanctity of marriage and ultimately against God.&lt;ref name=&quot;humanae_vitae&quot; /&gt;

Like all Mysteries, Orthodox marriage is more than just a celebration of something which already exists: it is the creation of something new, the imparting to the couple of the [[Divine grace|grace]] which transforms them from a 'couple' into husband and wife within the [[Body of Christ]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Grabbe&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Wedding ring Louvre AC924.jpg|left|thumb|Byzantine [[wedding ring]], depicting Christ uniting the bride and groom, 7th century, [[niello]]ed gold ([[Louvre|Musée du Louvre]]).]]

Marriage is an [[icon]] (image) of the relationship between Jesus and the Church. This is somewhat akin to the Old Testament [[prophet]]s' use of marriage as an analogy to describe the relationship between God and Israel. Marriage is the simplest, most basic unity of the church: a [[wikt:congregation|congregation]] where &quot;two or three are gathered together in Jesus' name.&quot;{{bibleref2c|Mt|18:20|KJV}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Grabbe&quot; /&gt; The home is considered a consecrated space (the ritual for the Blessing of a House is based upon that of the Consecration of a Church), and the husband and wife are considered the [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]] of that congregation. However, they do not &quot;perform&quot; the Sacraments in the [[house church]]; they &quot;live&quot; the Sacrament of Marriage. Because marriage is considered to be a [[pilgrimage]] wherein the couple walk side by side toward the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]], marriage to a non-Orthodox partner is discouraged, though it may be permitted.

Unlike Western Christianity, Eastern Christians do not consider the sacramental aspect of the marriage to be conferred by the couple themselves. Rather, the marriage is conferred by the action of the [[Holy Spirit]] acting through the priest. Furthermore, no one besides a bishop or priest—not even a [[deacon]]—may perform the Sacred Mystery.

The external sign of the marriage is the placing of wedding [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]] upon the heads of the couple, and their sharing in a &quot;Common Cup&quot; of wine. Once crowned, the couple walk a circle three times in a ceremonial &quot;dance&quot; in the middle of the church, while the choir intones a joyous three-part antiphonal hymn, &quot;Dance, [[Isaiah]]&quot;

The sharing of the Common Cup symbolizes the transformation of their union from a common marriage into a sacred union. The wedding is usually performed after the [[Divine Liturgy]] at which the couple receives [[Holy Communion]]. Traditionally, the wedding couple would wear their wedding crowns for eight days, and there is a special prayer said by the priest at the removal of the crowns.

Divorce is discouraged. Sometimes out of ''[[economia]]'' (mercy) a marriage may be dissolved if there is no hope whatever for a marriage to fulfill even a semblance of its intended sacramental character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grabbe&quot; /&gt; The standard formula for remarriage is that the Orthodox Church joyfully blesses the first marriage, merely performs the second, barely tolerates the third, and invariably forbids the fourth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hapgood&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last =Hapgoood|first =Isabel F.|year =1922|Publication-date=1975|title =Service Book of the Holy Orthodox-Catholic Apostolic Church|edition=2nd|pages =291–305, 604–605|place =Englewood, N.J.|publisher =Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:07Thessaloniki Agia Sophia09.jpg|thumb|Orthodox Church prepared for a wedding ([[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Hagia Sophia]], [[Thessaloniki]].)]]

[[Early church]] texts forbid marriage between an Orthodox Christian and a [[Heresy|heretic]] or [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]] (which would include all non-Orthodox Christians). Traditional Orthodox Christians forbid [[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]s with other denominations. More liberal ones perform them, provided that the couple formally commit themselves to rearing their children in the Orthodox faith.

All people are called to celibacy—human beings are all born into [[virginity]], and Orthodox Christians are expected by [[Sacred Tradition]] to remain in that state unless they are called into marriage and that call is sanctified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grabbe&quot;&gt;Gregory (Grabbe), Bishop. ''The Sacramental Life: An Orthodox Christian Perspective.'' Liberty, Tenn: St. John of Kronstadt Press, 1986
&lt;/ref&gt; The church blesses two paths on the journey to salvation: [[monasticism]] and marriage. Mere celibacy, without the sanctification of monasticism, can fall into selfishness and tends to be regarded with disfavour by the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grabbe&quot; /&gt;

Orthodox priests who serve in [[parish]]es are usually married. They must marry prior to their ordination. If they marry after they are ordained they are not permitted to continue performing sacraments. If their wife dies, they are forbidden to remarry; if they do, they may no longer serve as a priest. A married man may be ordained as a priest or deacon. However, a priest or deacon is not permitted to enter into matrimony after ordination. Bishops must always be monks and are thus celibate. However, if a married priest is widowed, he may receive monastic tonsure and thus become eligible for the episcopate.

The Eastern Orthodox Church believes that marriage is an eternal union of spouses, but in Heaven there will not be a procreative bond of marriage.

== View of the Oriental Orthodox Church ==

The [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]] hold views almost identical to those of the [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]]. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] allows second marriages only in cases of adultery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/coptic-pope-resists-court-ruling-divorce-remarriage Coptic Pope resists court ruling on divorce, remarriage | Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt].

=== Purposes ===

Essentially all [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations hold marriage to be ordained by God for the union between a man and a woman. They see the primary purpose of this union to be to glorify&lt;ref&gt;Praise, honor{{clarify|date=February 2011}}&lt;!-- What is the source here? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; God by demonstrating his love to the world. Other purposes of marriage include intimate companionship, rearing children and mutual support for both husband and wife to fulfill their life callings. Protestants generally approve of [[birth control]] and consider marital sexual pleasure to be a gift of God. While condoning [[divorce]] only under limited circumstances, most Protestant churches allow for divorce and remarriage.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio, Julie Hanlon. ''A Christian Theology of Marriage and Family,'' Paulist Press, 2003. ISBN 0809141183.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservative Christianity|Conservative]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]] take a stricter view of the nature of [[marriage]]. They consider marriage a solemn covenant between wife, husband and [[God]]. Most view sexual relations as appropriate only within a marriage. Divorce is permissible, if at all, only in very specific circumstances (for example, sexual immorality or abandonment by the non-believer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gotquestions.org/grounds-for-divorce.html|title=What are Biblical grounds for divorce?}}, gotquestions.org (Bible Questions Answered), Got Questions Ministries&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gotquestions.org/abuse-divorce.html|title=Is abuse an acceptable reason for divorce?}}, gotquestions.org (Bible Questions Answered), Got Questions Ministries&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roles and responsibilities in Marriage ===

Roles and responsibilities of husband and wives now vary considerably on a continuum between the long-held male dominant/female submission view and a growing shift toward equality (without sameness)&lt;ref&gt;Steil, Janice M. ''Marital Equality: Its Relationship to the Well-Being of Husbands and Wives.'' Sage. 1997. ISBN 0-8039-5251-1&lt;/ref&gt; of the woman and the man.&lt;ref&gt;Throckmorton, Anne. [http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=3654 &quot;The Lives of Wives: Their Changing Roles.&quot;] University of Virginia, January 9, 2008. Accessed 11 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable debate among many Christians today—not just Protestants—whether equality of husband and wife or male headship is the biblically ordained view, and even if it is biblically permissible. The divergent opinions fall into two main groups: [[Complementarianism|Complementarians]] (who call for husband-headship and wife-submission) and [[Christian Egalitarianism|Christian Egalitarians]] (who believe in full partnership equality in which couples can discover and negotiate roles and responsibilities in marriage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2004/august/8.55.html |title=Editor's Bookshelf: Creating Husbands and Fathers |accessdate=2007–02–11 |last=Neff |first=David |date=2004–08–01 |work=Christianity Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Complementarian view ====
{{See also|Complementarianism|Christian views about women}}

The [[Complementarianism|Complementarian]] (also known as Traditionalist or Hierarchical) view of marriage maintains that male leadership is biblically required in marriage. Complementarians generally believe that the husband and wife are of equal worth before God, since both are created in God's image, but that husbands and wives have different functions and responsibilities in marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbmw.org/Danvers Core Beliefs]. [[Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood|CBMW]]. Retrieved on 2011-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, the husband has the God-given responsibility to provide for, protect, and lead his family. Wives are expected to respect their husbands' authority and submit to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;BFM2000&quot;&gt;[http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp ''The 2000 Baptist Faith and Message,''] [[Southern Baptist Convention]], 2000 revision&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Complementarian authors caution that a wife's submission should never cause her to &quot;follow her husband into sin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Piper, John and Grudem, Wayne (eds.) ''[[Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood]]: A Response to Evangelical Feminism.'' Wheaton, IL: Crossway Books, 1991, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The Complementarian view of Christian marriage has been articulated and defended by several evangelical leaders in what is called the [[Danvers Statement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Danvers&quot; /&gt; Their understanding of the necessity for gender-based roles and authority structure in marriage is based on their interpretation of various scriptures: {{bibleref2|Eph.|5:21–33}}, {{bibleref2|Col.|3:18–19}}, {{bibleref2|Tit.|2:3–5}}, {{bibleref2|1Pet|3:1–7||1 Pet. 3:1–7}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Danvers&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbmw.org/Resources/Articles/The-Danvers-Statement ''The Danvers Statement.''] Prepared by several evangelical leaders at a [[Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood]] (CBMW) meeting in Danvers, Massachusetts, December 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more detailed statement of the Complementarian view of marriage appears in Southern Baptist Convention's ''[[Baptist Faith and Message]] (2000)'':

{{quotation|The husband and wife are of equal worth before God, since both are created in God's image. The marriage relationship models the way God relates to his people. A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the church. He has the God-given responsibility to provide for, to protect, and to lead his family. A wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as the church willingly submits to the headship of Christ. She, being in the image of God as is her husband and thus equal to him, has the God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as his helper in managing the household and nurturing the next generation.|'''Article XVIII. The Family.''' [[Baptist Faith and Message]] 2000}}

Many complementarians also interpret Scripture as forbidding women from holding positions of authority in the religious and/or political worlds.&lt;ref name=&quot;BFM2000&quot; /&gt;

==== The Egalitarian View ====
{{See also|Christian egalitarianism|Christian views about women}}

Christian Egalitarians believe that ''full partnership'' in an equal marriage is the most biblical view. As persons, husband and wife are of equal value. There is no priority of one spouse over the other. In truth, they are one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Staggs&quot; /&gt; Bible scholar [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]] and Classicist [[Evelyn Stagg]] write that husband-wife equality produces the most intimate, wholesome and mutually fulfilling marriages. They conclude that the Apostle Paul's statement sometimes called the &quot;Magna Carta of Humanity&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jewett, Paul K. ''Man As Male and Female: A Study in Sexual Relationships from a Theological Point of View.'' Eerdmans, 1990, p. 142. ISBN 978-0802815972&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded in {{bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}} applies to all Christian relationships, including Christian marriage: &quot;There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is ''neither male nor female'': for you are all ''one'' in Christ Jesus.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Christians for Biblical Equality]]{{Nonspecific|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian egalitarian theologians also find it significant that the &quot;two becoming one&quot; concept, first cited in {{bibleref2|Gen.|2:24}}, was quoted by Jesus in his teachings on marriage.{{bibleref2c|Matt.|19:4–6}} {{bibleref2c|Mk.|10:7–9}} In those passages he reemphasized the concept by adding to the Genesis passage these words: &quot;So, they are no longer two, but one&quot; (NIV). The Apostle Paul cited the Genesis 2:24 passage.{{bibleref2c|Eph.|5:30–32}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Staggs&quot;&gt;Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. ''Woman in the World of Jesus.'' Philadelphia: Westminster, 1978. ISBN 0-664-24195-6&lt;/ref&gt;

A New Testament passage that has long been interpreted to require a male priority in marriage are these verses: &quot;Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord,&quot; and &quot;the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church….&quot;{{bibleref2c|Eph.|5:22–24}} Both [[Christian Egalitarianism|Christian Egalitarians]] and [[Complementarianism|Complementarians]] agree that the Apostle Paul wrote that the &quot;husband is head…&quot; and &quot;wives, submit…,&quot; and that he was divinely inspired to write what he wrote, but the two groups diverge in their interpretation of this passage.

* [[Complementarianism|Complementarians]] understand &quot;head&quot; to mean &quot;leader&quot; and &quot;authority figure&quot; like the ''head'' of an organization being its president or chief executive officer.&lt;ref&gt;Grudem, Wayne. [http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:wZSw-mG-XN4J:www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/kephale.pdf+kephale&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a “The Meaning Of Kephalē (“Head”): An Evaluation Of New Evidence, Real And Alleged,”] ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society'' 44:1 (March 2001) pp. 25–65.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christian Egalitarianism|Christian Egalitarians]] consider this understanding to be contrary to the teachings and example of Jesus Christ. Therefore, they believe more attention needs to be given to discerning (1)&amp;nbsp;what Paul actually ''meant'' when he penned those instructions, (2)&amp;nbsp;to what extent his gender-based guidance was intended for an abusive 1st century culture in which women were considered disposable entities, chattel (property of husband) and permanently minors legally and to what extent he was prescribing a hierarchical relationship in which wives must be under husband authority for all people in all times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Staggs&quot; /&gt;

Much has been written concerning the meaning of &quot;head&quot; in the [[New Testament]]. The word used for &quot;head,&quot; transliterated from Greek, is ''kephalē''—which means ''the anatomical head of a body.'' Today's English word &quot;cephalic&quot; ({{IPA-en|səˈfælɨk|}} {{USdict|sə&amp;middot;făl&amp;prime;&amp;middot;ĭk}}) means &quot;Of or relating to the head; or located on, in, or near the head.&quot; In the New Testament, a thorough concordance search shows that the second most frequent use of &quot;head&quot; ''(kephalē)'', after &quot;the structure that connects to our neck and sits atop our bodies,&quot; is the metaphorical sense of &quot;source.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kroeger, Catherine Clark. &quot;Toward an Understanding of Ancient Conceptions of 'Head'.&quot; ''Priscilla Papers,'' Volume 20:3, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Alan F. &quot;A Meta-Study of the Debate over the Meaning of 'Head' (Kephale) in Paul's Writings.&quot;] ''Priscilla Papers, Volume 20:4, Autumn 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hebrew thought throughout the Old Testament, primarily because of the law of ''primogeniture''—the right of the firstborn to preside over the affairs of the family&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia.'' [http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/P/PRIMOGENITURE/ &quot;Primogeniture.&quot;]  Accessed 11 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; it was very important to determine who came first in birth order. Therefore, Paul and other rabbis pointed to the Genesis record,{{bibleref2c|Gen|2:22}} &quot;the L&lt;SMALL&gt;ORD&lt;/SMALL&gt; God made a woman from the rib&lt;ref&gt;Meaning of Heb. word translated &quot;rib&quot; unclear. Lit. &quot;side&quot; according to TNIV translation.{{Nonspecific|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had taken out of the man,&quot; making it clear that the male was the first-created (first &quot;born&quot;) and therefore perpetually entitled to special rights and privileges under the primogeniture doctrine. The wife's submission is seen in the context of Paul's injunction{{bibleref2c|Eph.|5:21}} for all Christians to submit to one another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Staggs&quot; /&gt;

A straightforward reading of {{bibleref2|Matthew|20:25–26||Matthew 20:25–26a}}, {{bibleref2|Mark|10:42}}, and {{bibleref2|Luke|22:25}} suggests that Jesus even ''forbids'' any hierarchy of relationships in Christian relationships: &quot;You know that the rulers of the Gentiles ''lord it over'' them, and their high officials ''exercise authority'' over them. Not so with you!&quot; While &quot;lord it over&quot; implies abusive leadership, his words &quot;exercise authority&quot; have no connotation of abuse of authority.'''&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Clive, Steve Moyise. ''Jesus and the Gospels.'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006. ISBN 0567040739&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views of Non-Trinitarian denominations ==

[[Image:Phil and Marlene.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A [[Celestial Marriage]] must be performed in an [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS temple]].]]

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (&quot;LDS Church&quot;; see also [[Mormon]]), &quot;[[Celestial Marriage]]&quot; is a sacred [[covenant (religion)|covenant]] between a man, a woman and [[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|God]] performed by a [[priesthood (Mormonism)|priesthood]] authority in the [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] of the Church. Eternal Marriage is legally recognized, but unlike other civil marriages, Eternal Marriage is intended to continue into the [[afterlife]] after the [[resurrection]] if the man and woman do not break their covenants. Eternally married couples are often referred to as being &quot;[[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealed]]&quot; to each other. Sealed couples who keep their covenants are also promised to have their posterity sealed to them in the after life. Thus, the slogan of the LDS Church: &quot;families are forever.&quot; The LDS Church encourages its members to be in good standing with it so that they may marry in the temple. &quot;Cancellation of a sealing,&quot; sometimes incorrectly called a &quot;temple divorce,&quot; is uncommon and is granted only by the highest authority in the Church. Civil divorce and marriage outside the temple is somewhat of a stigma in the [[Latter-day Saint]] culture although currently the Church itself directs its local leaders not to advise members about divorce one way or another.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mormon view of divorce.&quot;{{clarify|date=February 2011}}&lt;!-- What is this source? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[New Church]] (or [[Swedenborgianism]]) teaches that married love (sometime translated ''conjugal love'') is &quot;the precious jewel of human life and the repository of the Christian religion&quot; because the love shared between a husband and a wife is the source of all peace and joy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Married Love''.&quot;  see ''Married Love'' 457{{clarify|date=February 2011}}&lt;!-- What is this source? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When a husband and wife work together to become [[angels]] in [[heaven]], their marriage continues uninterrupted even after the death of their bodies, living together in heaven to eternity. [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] claimed to have spoken to [[angels]] who had been married for thousands of years. Those who are never married on earth will find a spouse in heaven.&lt;!-- please insert other denominational views here --&gt;

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] view marriage to be a permanent arrangement with the only possible exception being adultery. Divorce is strongly discouraged even when adultery is committed since the wronged spouse is free to forgive the unfaithful one. There are provisions for a domestic separation in the event of &quot;failure to provide for one's household&quot; and domestic violence, or spiritual resistance on the part of a partner. Even in such situations though divorce would be considered grounds for loss of privileges in the congregation. Re-marrying after death or a proper divorce is permitted. Marriage is the only situation where any type of sexual interaction is acceptable, and even then certain restrictions apply to acts such as oral and anal sex. Married persons who are known to commit such acts may in fact lose privileges in the congregation as they are supposed to be setting a good example to the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Watchtower]] 9/15/2006, 3/15/1983, 11/1/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Same sex marriage ==
{{Main|Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches}}

A small but growing number of Protestant denominations such as the [[United Church of Canada]] and some non-trinitarian denominations, perform [[same sex marriage|weddings between same sex couples]]. Other churches perform ceremonies blessing same sex unions, but do not refer to them as marriages. The Roman Catholic Church does not perform or recognise same-sex marriage. Whether to bless same-sex marriages and unions is a matter of debate within some denominations.

In [[object-oriented programming]], a '''class''' is a construct that is used as a [[blueprint]] to create [[Instance (computer science)|instance]]s of the class (''class instances'', ''class objects'', ''instance objects'' or just ''[[Object (object-oriented programming)|object]]s''). A class defines constituent members which enable class instances to have ''state'' and ''behavior''. Data field members (''member variables'' or ''instance variables'') enable a class object to maintain state. Other kinds of members, especially ''[[Method (computer science)|method]]s'', enable a class object's behavior. Class instances are of the [[data type|type]] of the associated class. For example, an instance of the class &quot;Fruit&quot; (a &quot;Fruit&quot; object) would be of the type &quot;Fruit&quot;. A class usually represents a noun, such as a person, place or (possibly quite abstract) thing. Programming languages that include classes as a programming construct subtly differ in their support for various class-related features. Most support various forms of class [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]]. Many languages also support advanced [[Information hiding|encapsulation]] control features, such as access specifiers.
{{TOC right}}
== Design ==

=== Basic ===
Basic class design involves only one class which is not dependent on any other classes.

==== Member accessibility ====         
{{See|Information hiding}}

Many languages support the concept of '''information hiding''' and '''encapsulation''', typically with '''access specifiers''' for class members. Access specifiers specify constraints on who can access which class members. Some access specifiers may also control how classes inherit such constraints. Their primary purpose is to separate the interface of a class from its implementation.

A common set of access specifiers that many object-oriented languages support is &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Omar|first=Aldawud|title=Dr|url=http://www.hostitwise.com/java/oop_user_defined_classes_java.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; :

* '''Private''' (or ''class-private'') restricts the access to the class itself. Only methods that are part of the same class can access private members.
* '''Protected''' (or ''class-protected'') allows the class itself and all its subclasses to access the member.
* '''Public''' means that any code can access the member by its name.

Note that although many languages support the above access specifiers, the semantics of them may subtly differ in each.

A common usage of access specifiers is to separate the internal data (structure)s of a class from its interface; that is, the internal data structures are private. Public [[accessor method]]s can be used to inspect or alter such private data. The various object-oriented programming languages enforce this to various degrees. For example, the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] language does not allow client code to access the private data of a class at all, whereas in languages like [[Objective-C]] or [[Perl]] client code can do whatever it wants. In [[C++]] language, private methods are visible but not accessible in the interface; however, they are commonly made invisible by explicitly declaring fully abstract classes that represent the interfaces of the class.

Access specifiers do not necessarily control '''visibility''', in that even private members may be visible to client code. In some languages, an inaccessible but visible member may be referred to at run-time (e.g. pointer to it can be returned from member functions), but all attempts to use it by referring to the name of the member from client code will be prevented by the type checker. Object-oriented design uses the access specifiers in conjunction with careful design of public method implementations to enforce class invariants. Access specifiers are intended to protect against accidental use of members by clients, but are not suitable for run-time protection of object's data.

Some languages, such as [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], support '''instance-private''' and '''instance-protected''' access specifiers in lieu of (or in addition to) class-private and class-protected, respectively. They differ in that they restrict access based on the instance itself, rather than the instance's class.

In addition, some languages, such as C++, support a mechanism where a function explicitly declared as ''friend'' of the class may access the members designated as private or protected.

==== Structural ====
[[File:oop-uml-class-example.png|frame|right|[[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] notation for classes]]

Along with having an interface, a class contains a description of structure of [[Data (computing)|data]] stored in the instances of the class. The data is partitioned into '''attributes''' (or ''properties'', ''fields'', ''data members''). Going back to the television set example, the myriad attributes, such as size and whether it supports color, together comprise its structure. A class represents the full description of a television, including its attributes (structure) and buttons (interface).

The [[state (computer science)|state]] of an instance's data is stored in some resource, such as memory or a file. The storage is assumed to be located in a specific location, such that it is possible to access the instance through [[reference (computer science)|reference]]s to the [[identity (object-oriented programming)|identity]] of the instances. However, the actual storage location associated with an instance may change with time. In such situations, the identity of the object does not change. The state is encapsulated and every access to the state occurs through methods of the class.

In most languages, the structures as defined by the class determine how the memory used by its instances will be laid out. This technique is known as the ''cookie-cutter model''. The alternative to the cookie-cutter model is the model of [[Python (programming language)|Python]], wherein objects are structured as associative key-value containers. In such models, objects that are instances of the same class could contain different instance variables, as state can be dynamically added to the object. This may resemble [[prototype-based languages]] in some ways, but it is not equivalent.

A class also describes a set of [[class invariant|invariant]]s that are preserved by every method in the class. An invariant is a constraint on the state of an object that should be satisfied by every object of the class. The main purpose of the invariants is to establish what objects belong to the class. An invariant is what distinguishes [[data type]]s and classes from each other; that is, a class does not allow use of all possible values for the state of the object, and instead allows only those values that are well-defined by the semantics of the intended use of the data type. The set of supported (public) methods often implicitly establishes an invariant. Some programming languages support specification of invariants as part of the definition of the class, and enforce them through the type system. [[#Information hiding and encapsulation|Encapsulation]] of state is necessary for being able to enforce the invariants of the class.

Some languages allow an implementation of a class to specify [[constructor (computer science)|constructor]] (or ''initializer'') and [[destructor (computer science)|destructor]] (or ''finalizer'') methods that specify how instances of the class are created and destroyed, respectively. A constructor that takes arguments can be used to create an instance from passed-in data. The main purpose of a constructor is to establish the invariant of the class, failing if the invariant isn't valid. The main purpose of a destructor is to destroy the identity of the instance, invalidating any references in the process. Constructors and destructors are often used to reserve and release, respectively, resources associated with the object. In some languages, a destructor can return a value which can then be used to obtain a public representation (transfer encoding) of an instance of a class and simultaneously destroy the copy of the instance stored in current thread's memory.

A class may also contain ''static attributes'' or ''class attributes'', which contain data that are specific to the class yet are common to all instances of the class. If the class itself is treated as an instance of a hypothetical [[metaclass]], static attributes and static methods would be instance attributes and instance methods of that metaclass.

==== Behavioral ====
{{Main|Interface (computer science)|Method (computer science)}}

Note: the term &quot;interface&quot; here isn't referring to a [[Interface (Java)|Java interface]], although the two are closely related. &lt;!-- This section used to contain info on Java interfaces. If you wish to view it (to, say, move to another page), the last revision before the removal of this info is http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Class_(computer_science)&amp;oldid=165562113 --&gt;

Objects define their interaction with the outside world through the '''methods''' that they expose. A method, or ''instance method'', is a [[subroutine]] (function) with a special property that it has access to data stored in an object (instance). Methods that manipulate the data of the object and perform tasks are sometimes described as [[behavior]]. All objects belong to a class.

Methods form the object's '''interface''' with the outside world; the buttons on the front of your television set, for example, are the interface between you and the electrical wiring on the other side of its plastic casing. You press the &quot;power&quot; button to toggle the television on and off. In this example, the television is the instance, each method is represented by a button, and all the buttons together comprise the interface. In its most common form, an interface is a specification of a group of related methods without any associated implementation of the methods.

Every class '''implements''' (or ''realizes'') an interface by providing [[#Structure of a class|structure]] (i.e. data and state) and method implementations (i.e. providing code that specifies how methods work). There is a distinction between the definition of an interface and the implementation of that interface. In most languages, this line is usually blurred, because a class declaration both defines and implements an interface. Some languages, however, provide features that help separate interface and implementation. For example, an [[#Abstract classes|abstract class]] can define an interface without providing implementation.

Interfaces may also be defined to include a set of auxiliary functions called ''static methods'' or ''class methods''. Static methods, like instance methods, are exclusively associated with the class. They differ from instance methods in that they do not work with instances of the class; that is, static methods neither require an instance of the class nor can they access the data of such an instance. For example, getting the total number of televisions in existence could be a static method of the television class. This method is clearly associated with the class, yet is outside the domain of each individual instance of the class. Another example is a static method that finds a particular instance out of the set of all television objects.

Languages that support class inheritance also allow classes to inherit interfaces from the classes that they are derived from. In languages that support [[#Information hiding and encapsulation|access specifiers]], the interface of a class is considered to be the set of public members of the class, including both methods and attributes (via implicit [[Mutator method|getter and setter methods]]); any private members or internal data structures are not intended to be depended on by client code and thus are not part of the interface.

The object-oriented programming methodology is designed in such a way that the operations of any interface of a class are usually chosen to be independent of each other. It results in a [[client–server]] (or layered) design where servers do not depend in any way on the clients. An interface places no requirements for clients to invoke the operations of one interface in any particular order. This approach has the benefit that client code can assume that the operations of an interface are available for use whenever the client holds a valid reference to the object.

=== Advanced ===
In addition to the design of basic classes that are not dependent on other classes, more advanced class design based upon multiple inter-dependent classes is possible and common. The two primary (if not traditional and still fundamental, rather than &quot;advanced&quot;) class design techniques are ''composition'' and ''derivation''. Composition of classes is an embedding of one or more classes in another class -- an inclusive or contained relationship between classes commonly known as a '''[[has-a]]''' relationship where the embedded class is said to be part of the enclosing class. Derivation of a class (''derived class'' or ''child class'' or ''subclass'') from one or more other classes (''base classes'' or ''parent classes'' or ''superclass'') is commonly known as an '''[[is-a]]''' relationship.

==== Composition ====
For example, a class 'Car' could be composed of (i.e., contain) a class 'Engine'. Therefore, a Car '''has an''' Engine. 

Composition is often implemented in programming languages by allocating the data storage of instances of the enclosing class to contain a representation of instances of the embedded class.

==== Derivation ====
For example, a class 'Button' could be derived from a class 'Control'. Therefore, a Button '''is a''' Control. Subclasses usually consist of several kinds of modifications (customizations) to their respective superclasses and are therefore ''specializations'' of their superclasses: addition of new instance variables, addition of new methods and [[method overriding|overriding]] of existing methods to support the new instance variables.

== Categories ==
There are many categories of classes depending on modifiers. Note that these categories do not necessarily categorize classes into distinct partitions. For example, while it is impossible to have a class that is both abstract and concrete, a sealed class is implicitly a concrete class, and it may be possible to have an abstract partial class.

=== Concrete ===
One common (if not modern) definition of '''concrete class''' is a class that can be [[Instantiation (computer science)|instantiated]]. (In &quot;Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms&quot;, James Coplien defines &quot;concrete class&quot; as a class that has implicitly generated or explicitly defined special member functions which enable a class object to behave as do built-in types. These &quot;concrete classes&quot;, then, adhere to the &quot;Orthodox Canonical Form&quot;. Many developers who first learned the term as such, way back then, still primarily use it that way). This contrasts with abstract classes as described below.

=== Abstract ===
{{anchor|Abstract_and_concrete_classes}}
{{Main|Abstract type}}

An '''abstract class''', or ''abstract base class'' (ABC), is a class that cannot be instantiated. Such a class is only meaningful if the language supports inheritance. An abstract class is designed ''only'' as a parent class from which child classes may be derived. Abstract classes are often used to represent [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstract]] concepts or entities. The incomplete features of the abstract class are then shared by a group of subclasses which add different variations of the missing pieces.

Abstract classes are superclasses which contain [[abstract method]]s and are defined such that concrete subclasses are to extend them by implementing the methods. The behaviors defined by such a class are &quot;generic&quot; and much of the class will be undefined and unimplemented. Before a class derived from an abstract class can become concrete, i.e. a class that can be instantiated, it must implement particular methods for all the abstract methods of its parent classes.

When specifying an abstract class, the programmer is referring to a class which has elements that are meant to be implemented by inheritance. The abstraction of the class methods to be implemented by the subclasses is meant to simplify [[software development]]. This also enables the programmer to focus on planning and design.

Most object oriented programming languages allow the programmer to specify which classes are considered abstract and will not allow these to be instantiated. For example, in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], the keyword ''abstract'' is used. In [[C++]], an abstract class is a class having at least one abstract method (a pure virtual function in C++ parlance).

Some languages, notably Java and C#, additionally support a variant of abstract classes called an [[Interface (Java)|interface]]. Such a class can only contain abstract publicly accessible methods. In this way, they are closely related - but not equivalent - to the abstract concept of [[#Interfaces and methods|interfaces]] described in this article.

=== Non-subclassable ===
Some languages also support non-subclassable classes as a language feature. These classes can not be used as a base classes (this annotation conflicts with abstract classes).

Non-subclassable classes are primarily used to avoid derivation of classes not built for inheritance, they may also trigger specific or runtime optimizations.

=== Local and inner ===
In some languages, classes can be declared in [[Scope (programming)|scopes]] other than the global scope. There are various types of such classes.

One common type is an '''[[inner class]]''', which is a class defined within another class. Since it involves two classes, this can also be treated as another type of class association. The methods of an inner class can access static methods of the enclosing class(es). An inner class is typically not associated with instances of the enclosing class, i.e. an inner class is not instantiated along with its enclosing class. Depending on language, it may or may not be possible to refer to the class from outside the enclosing class. A related concept is ''inner types'' (a.k.a. ''inner data type'', ''nested type''), which is a generalization of the concept of inner classes. [[C++]] is an example of a language that supports both inner classes and inner types (via ''[[typedef]]'' declarations).

Another type is a '''local class''', which is a class defined within a procedure or function. This limits references to the class name to within the scope where the class is declared. Depending on the semantic rules of the language, there may be additional restrictions on local classes compared non-local ones. One common restriction is to disallow local class methods to access local variables of the enclosing function. For example, in C++, a local class may refer to static variables declared within its enclosing function, but may not access the function's automatic variables.

=== Named versus anonymous ===
In most languages, a class is bound to a name or identifier upon definition. However, some languages allow classes to be defined without names. Such a class is called an '''anonymous class''' (analogous to named vs. [[anonymous function]]s).

=== Metaclasses ===
{{Main|Metaclass}}

'''Metaclasses''' are classes whose instances are classes. A metaclass describes a common structure of a collection of classes. A metaclass can implement a [[design pattern (computer science)|design pattern]] or describe a shorthand for particular kinds of classes. Metaclasses are often used to describe [[software framework|framework]]s.

In some languages such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] or [[Smalltalk]], a class is also an object; thus each class is an instance of the unique metaclass, which is built in the language. For example, in [[Objective-C]], each object and class is an instance of NSObject. The [[Common Lisp Object System]] (CLOS) provides [[Metaobject|metaobject protocols]] (MOPs) to implement those classes and metaclasses.

=== Partial ===
{{Main|Partial class}}

'''Partial classes''' are classes that can be split over multiple definitions (typically over multiple files), making it easier to deal with classes mixing auto-generated and manually written code. Partial classes are merged at compile-time, making no difference to the output.

Partial classes have existed in [[Smalltalk]] under the name of ''Class Extensions'' for considerable time. With the arrival of the [[.NET Framework|.NET framework 2]], [[Microsoft]] introduced partial classes, supported in both [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] 2.0 and [[Visual Basic .NET|Visual Basic 2005]].

== Benefits ==
Computer programs usually model aspects of some real or abstract world (the [[Domain-driven design|Domain]]). Because each class models a concept, classes provide a more natural way to create such models. Each class in the model represents a noun in the domain, and the methods of the class represent verbs that may apply to that noun (Verbs can also be modeled as classes, see [[Command_pattern|Command Pattern]]). For example in a typical business system, various aspects of the business are modeled, using such classes as ''Customer'', ''Product'', ''Worker'', ''Invoice'', ''Job'', etc. An ''Invoice'' may have methods like ''Create'', ''Print'' or ''Send'', a ''Job'' may be ''Performed'' or ''Canceled'', etc. Once the system can model aspects of the business accurately, it can provide users of the system with useful information about those aspects. Classes allow a clear correspondence ([[map (mathematics)|mapping]]) between the model and the domain, making it easier to design, build, modify and understand these models. Classes provide some control over the often challenging complexity of such models.

Classes can accelerate development by reducing redundant program code, [[Software testing|testing]] and [[Software bug|bug]] [[Debugging|fixing]]. If a class has been thoroughly tested and is known to be a 'solid work', it is usually true that using or extending the well-tested class will reduce the number of bugs - as compared to the use of freshly developed or ad hoc code - in the final output. In addition, efficient class reuse means that many bugs need to be fixed in only one place when problems are discovered.

Another reason for using classes is to simplify the relationships of interrelated data. Rather than writing code to repeatedly call a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) [[Window (computing)|window]] drawing subroutine on the terminal screen (as would be typical for [[structured programming]]), it is more intuitive. With classes, GUI items that are similar to windows (such as dialog boxes) can simply inherit most of their functionality and data structures from the [[window class]]. The programmer then need only add code to the dialog class that is unique to its operation. Indeed, GUIs are a very common and useful application of classes, and GUI programming is generally much easier with a good class framework.

== Run-time representation ==
As a data type, a class is usually considered as a compile-time construct. A language may also support [[prototype]] or [[Factory method pattern|factory]] [[metaobject]]s that represent run-time information about classes, or even represent metadata that provides access to [[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]] facilities and ability to manipulate data structure formats at run-time. Many languages distinguish this kind of [[run-time type information]] about classes from a class on the basis that the information is not needed at run-time. Some dynamic languages do not make strict distinctions between run-time and compile-time constructs, and therefore may not distinguish between metaobjects and classes.

For example: if Human is a [[metaobject]] representing the class Person, then instances of class Person can be created by using the facilities of the Human [[metaobject]].

== Object-orientation &lt;!-- Most material probably belongs in an OO article --&gt; ==
=== Object lifetime ===
The instances of embedded classes have shorter or same [[Object lifetime|lifetime]] than the lifetime of the instances of the enclosing class. 

=== Inheritance &lt;!-- some of this applies but most belongs in an OO article --&gt;===
{{Main|Inheritance (computer science)|Superclass (computer science)|Subclass (computer science)}}

Conceptually, a superclass should be considered as a common part of its subclasses. This factoring of commonality is one mechanism for providing [[Code reuse|reuse]]. Thus, extending a superclass by modifying the existing class is also likely to narrow its applicability in various situations. In object-oriented design, careful balance between applicability and functionality of superclasses should be considered. Subclassing is different from [[subtyping]] in that subtyping deals with common behaviour whereas subclassing is concerned with common structure.

Some programming languages (for example [[C++]]) allow [[multiple inheritance]] - they allow a child class to have more than one parent class. This technique has been criticized by some for its unnecessary complexity and being difficult to implement efficiently, though some projects have certainly benefited from its use. [[Java (programming language)|Java]], for example has no multiple inheritance, as its designers felt that it would add unnecessary complexity. Java instead allows inheriting from multiple [[pure abstract class]]es (called interfaces in Java).

Sub- and superclasses are considered to exist within a [[hierarchy (object-oriented programming)|hierarchy]] defined by the inheritance relationship. If multiple inheritance is allowed, this hierarchy is a [[directed acyclic graph]] (or DAG for short), otherwise it is a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]]. The hierarchy has classes as nodes and inheritance relationships as links. The levels of this hierarchy are called [[Layer (object-oriented design)|layers]] or [[level of abstraction|levels of abstraction]]. Classes in the same level are more likely to be [[association (object-oriented programming)|associated]] than classes in different levels.

There are two slightly different points of view as to whether subclasses of the same class are required to be disjoint. Sometimes, subclasses of a particular class are considered to be completely disjoint. That is, every instance of a class has exactly one ''most-derived class'', which is a subclass of every class that the instance has. This view does not allow dynamic change of object's class, as objects are assumed to be created with a fixed most-derived class. The basis for not allowing changes to object's class is that the class is a compile-time type, which does not usually change at runtime, and [[Polymorphism in object-oriented programming|polymorphism]] is utilized for any dynamic change to the object's behavior, so this ability is not necessary. And design that does not need to perform changes to object's type will be more robust and easy-to-use from the point of view of the users of the class.

From another point of view, subclasses are not required to be disjoint. Then there is no concept of a most-derived class, and all types in the inheritance hierarchy that are types of the instance are considered to be equally types of the instance. This view is based on a dynamic classification of objects, such that an object may change its class at runtime. Then object's class is considered to be its ''current'' structure, but changes to it are allowed. The basis for allowing changes to object's class is a perceived inconvenience caused by replacing an instance with another instance of a different type, since this would require change of all references to the original instance to be changed to refer to the new instance. When changing the object's class, references to the existing instances do not need to be replaced with references to new instances when the class of the object changes. However, this ability is not readily available in all programming languages. This analysis depends on the proposition that dynamic changes to object structure are common. This may or may not be the case in practice.

==== Languages without inheritance ====
Although class-based languages are commonly assumed to support inheritance, inheritance is not an intrinsic aspect of the concept of classes. There are languages that support classes yet do not support inheritance. Examples are earlier versions of [[Visual Basic]]. These languages, sometimes called &quot;[[object-based languages]]&quot;, do not provide the structural benefits of statically type-checked interfaces for objects. This is because in object-based languages, it is possible to use and extend data structures and attach methods to them at run-time. This precludes the compiler or interpreter being able to check the type information specified in the source code as the type is built dynamically and not defined statically. Most of these languages allow for ''instance behaviour'' and complex ''operational polymorphism'' (see [[dynamic dispatch]] and [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]).

== Object-oriented analysis &lt;!-- belongs in an Object-Oriented Analysis article--&gt; == 
have {{Main|Association (object-oriented programming)}}&lt;!--consider moving a bunch of stuff here to this page...--&gt;

In [[object-oriented analysis]] and in [[Unified Modelling Language|UML]], an '''association''' between two classes is a type of a link between the corresponding objects. A (two-way) association between classes A and B describes a relationship between each object of class A and some objects of class B, and vice versa. Associations are often named with a verb, such as &quot;subscribes-to&quot;.

An association role type describes the role type of an instance of a class when the instance participates in an association. An association role type is related to each end of the association. A role describes an instance of a class from the point of view of a situation in which the instance participates in the association. Role types are collections of role (instance)s grouped by their similar properties. For example, a &quot;subscriber&quot; role type describes the property common to instances of the class &quot;Person&quot; when they participate in a &quot;subscribes-to&quot; relationship with the class &quot;Magazine&quot;. Also, a &quot;Magazine&quot; has the &quot;subscribed magazine&quot; role type when the subscribers subscribe-to it.

Association role multiplicity describes how many instances correspond to each instance of the other class(es) of the association. Common multiplicities are &quot;0..1&quot;, &quot;1..1&quot;, &quot;1..*&quot; and &quot;0..*&quot;, where the &quot;*&quot; specifies any number of instances.

There are some special kinds of associations between classes.

'''Color blindness''' or '''[[color vision]] deficiency''' is the decreased ability to perceive differences between some of the [[color]]s that others can distinguish. It is most often of [[gene]]tic nature, but may also occur because of some [[Human eye|eye]], [[nerve]], or [[Human brain|brain]] damage, or exposure to certain [[chemical]]s. The English chemist [[John Dalton]] published the first [[science|scientific]] paper on this subject in 1798, &quot;Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;dalton&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dalton | first1 = J | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1798 | title = Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours: with observations | url = | journal = Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 28–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after the realization of his own color blindness. Because of Dalton's work, the condition was often called '''daltonism''', although this term is now used for a type of color blindness called [[#Red–green color blindness|deuteranopia]].

Color blindness is usually classed as a mild [[disability]], but in certain situations, color blind individuals have an advantage over those with normal color vision. There are some studies which conclude that color blind individuals are better at penetrating certain color [[camouflage]]s and it has been suggested that this may be the [[evolution]]ary explanation for the surprisingly high frequency of congenital red–green color blindness.&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morgan MJ, Adam A, Mollon JD |title=Dichromats detect colour-camouflaged objects that are not detected by trichromats |journal=Proc.

==Background==
{{Main|Trichromatic color vision}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}

The average human [[retina]] contains two kinds of light cells: the [[rod cell]]s ([[Scotopic vision|active in low light]]) and the [[cone cell]]s ([[Photopic vision|active in normal daylight]]). Normally, there are three kinds of cones, each containing a different pigment, which are activated when the pigments absorb light. The [[spectral sensitivity|spectral sensitivities]] of the cones differ; one is maximally sensitive to short wavelengths, one to medium wavelengths, and the third to long wavelengths, with their peak sensitivities in the blue, yellowish-green, and yellow regions of the spectrum, respectively. The absorption spectra of all three systems cover the visible spectrum. These receptors are often called S cones, M cones, and L cones, for short, medium, and long wavelength; but they are also often referred to as blue cones, green cones, and red cones, respectively.

Although these receptors are often referred to as &quot;blue, green, and red&quot; receptors, this terminology is not very accurate, especially as the &quot;red&quot; receptor actually has its peak sensitivity in the yellow region. The sensitivity of normal color vision actually depends on the overlap between the absorption spectra of the three systems: different colors are recognized when the different types of cone are stimulated to different degrees. Red light, for example, stimulates the long wavelength cones much more than either of the others, and reducing the wavelength causes the other two cone systems to be increasingly stimulated, causing a gradual change in hue.

Many of the genes involved in color vision are on the [[X chromosome]], making color blindness more common in males than in females because males have only one X chromosome, while females have two. Because this is an X-linked trait about 1% of women have a 4th color cone and can be considered [[Tetrachromacy|tetrachromats]] although it is not clear that this provides an advantage in color discrimination.

:*Anomalous [[trichromacy]] is a common type of inherited color vision deficiency, occurring when one of the three cone pigments is altered in its spectral sensitivity.

::*Deuteranomaly, caused by a similar shift in the green retinal receptors, is by far the most common type of color vision deficiency, mildly affecting red–green hue discrimination in 5% of males. It is hereditary and sex-linked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassin&quot;/&gt;

===By clinical appearance===

Based on clinical appearance, color blindness may be described as total or partial. Total color blindness is much less common than partial color blindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/lightandcolor/humanvisionhome.html|title=Human Vision and Color Perception|publisher=[[Florida State University]]|author=Spring, Kenneth R.|coauthors=Matthew J.

==Causes==
===Evolutionary arguments===
{{cleanup|section|date=September 2009}}

Any recessive genetic characteristic that persists at a level as high as 5% is generally regarded as possibly having some advantage over the long term.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} At one time the U.S. Army found that color blind people could spot &quot;[[camouflage]]&quot; colors that fooled those with normal color vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toledo-bend.com/colorblind/aboutcb.asp|title=About Color Blindness (Color Vision Deficiency) :Clinical information about color blindness|last=Waggoner|first=Terrace L.|work=Colors for the Color Blind|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2011}} Humans have a higher percentage of color blindness than [[macaque monkey]]s according to recent research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Onishi A, Koike S, Ida M, ''et al.'' |title=Dichromatism in macaque monkeys |journal=Nature |volume=402 |issue=6758 |pages=139–40 |year=1999 |month=November |pmid=10647004 |doi=10.1038/45963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible advantage might result from the presence of a [[tetrachromacy|tetrachromic]] female. Owing to X-chromosome inactivation, females who are [[Zygosity|heterozygous]] for anomalous trichromacy ought to have at least four types of cone in their retinae. It is possible that this affords them an extra dimension of color vision, by analogy to [[New World monkey]]s where heterozygous females gain trichromacy in a basically dichromatic species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0042-6989(93)90143-K |author=Jordan G, Mollon JD |title=A study of women heterozygous for colour deficiencies |journal=Vision Res. |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=1495–508 |year=1993 |month=July |pmid=8351822 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0042-6989(93)90143-K}}&lt;/br&gt;

===Genetics===

Color blindness can be inherited. It is most commonly inherited from mutations on the [[X chromosome]] but the mapping of the human genome has shown there are many causative mutations – mutations capable of causing color blindness originate from at least 19 different chromosomes and 56 different genes (as shown online at the [[Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man]] (OMIM) database at [[Johns Hopkins University]]).

Some of the inherited diseases known to cause color blindness are:

*[[cone dystrophy]]
*[[cone-rod dystrophy]]
*[[achromatopsia]] (aka rod monochromatism, aka stationary cone dystrophy, aka cone dysfunction syndrome)
*[[blue cone monochromatism]],
*[[Leber's congenital amaurosis]].
*[[retinitis pigmentosa]] (initially affects rods but can later progress to cones and therefore color blindness)

Inherited color blindness can be congenital (from birth), or it can commence in childhood or adulthood. Depending on the mutation, it can be stationary, that is, remain the same throughout a person's lifetime, or progressive. As progressive phenotypes involve deterioration of the retina and other parts of the eye, certain forms of color blindness can progress to legal blindness, i.e., an acuity of 6/60 or worse, and often leave a person with complete blindness.

Color blindness always pertains to the cone photoreceptors in retinas, as the cones are capable of detecting the color frequencies of light.

About 8 percent of males, but only 0.5 percent of females, are color blind in some way or another, whether it is one color, a color combination, or another mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Color Vision: From Genes to Perception|last=Sharpe|first=LT|coauthors=Stockman A, Jägle H, Nathans J| editor=Gegenfurtner KR, Sharpe LT |chapter=Opsin genes, cone photopigments, color vision and color blindness|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]| year=1999|isbn=9780521004398|url=http://books.google.com/?id=4zQMQLLVkFYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;colblindor&quot;&gt;http://www.colblindor.com/2006/04/28/colorblind-population/&lt;/ref&gt; The reason males are at a greater risk of inheriting an X linked mutation is that males only have one X chromosome (XY, with the Y chromosome carrying altogether different genes than the X chromosome), and females have two (XX); if a woman inherits a normal X chromosome in addition to the one that carries the mutation, she will not display the mutation. Men do not have a second X chromosome to override the chromosome that carries the mutation. If 5% of variants of a given gene are defective, the probability of a single copy being defective is 5%, but the probability that two copies are both defective is 0.05 &amp;times; 0.05 = 0.0025, or just 0.25%.

===Other causes===

Other causes of color blindness include brain or retinal damage caused by [[shaken baby syndrome]], accidents and other trauma which produce swelling of the brain in the occipital lobe, and damage to the retina caused by exposure to [[ultraviolet light]]. Most ultraviolet light damage is caused during childhood and this form of retinal degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in the world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Damage often presents itself later on in life.

Color blindness may also present itself in the spectrum of degenerative diseases of the eye, such as age-related [[macular degeneration]], and as part of the retinal damage caused by [[diabetes]].

===Types===

There are many types of color blindness. The most common are red–green [[Heredity|hereditary]] photoreceptor disorders, but it is also possible to acquire color blindness through damage to the retina, optic nerve, or higher brain areas. Higher brain areas implicated in color processing include the parvocellular pathway of the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] of the [[thalamus]], and [[visual area V4]] of the [[visual cortex]]. Acquired color blindness is generally unlike the more typical genetic disorders. For example, it is possible to acquire color blindness only in a portion of the visual field but maintain normal color vision elsewhere. Some forms of acquired color blindness are reversible. Transient color blindness also occurs (very rarely) in the [[aura (symptom)|aura]] of some [[migraine]] sufferers. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

The different kinds of inherited color blindness result from partial or complete loss of function of one or more of the different cone systems. When one cone system is compromised, [[dichromat|dichromacy]] results. The most frequent forms of human color blindness result from problems with either the middle or long wavelength sensitive cone systems, and involve difficulties in discriminating reds, yellows, and greens from one another. They are collectively referred to as &quot;red–green color blindness&quot;, though the term is an over-simplification and is somewhat misleading. Other forms of color blindness are much more rare. They include problems in discriminating blues from yellows, and the rarest forms of all, complete color blindness or ''[[monochromacy]]'', where one cannot distinguish any color from [[gray (color)|grey]], as in a [[black-and-white]] movie or photograph.

===Congenital===

Congenital color vision deficiencies are subdivided based on the number of primary hues needed to match a given sample in the [[visible spectrum]].

====Monochromacy====

[[Monochromacy]] is the condition of possessing only a single channel for conveying information about color.&lt;ref name=&quot;Byrne&quot;&gt;Byrne A, Hilbert D. [http://tigger.uic.edu/~hilbert/Glossary.html &quot;A Glossary of Color Science.&quot;] Originally published in ''Readings on Color, Volume 2: The Science of Color.'' ([[MIT Press]], 1997). Retrieved November 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Monochromats possess a complete inability to distinguish any colors and perceive only variations in brightness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Byrne&quot;/&gt; It occurs in two primary forms:
# '''[[Rod monochromacy]]''', frequently called ''achromatopsia'', where the retina contains no cone cells, so that in addition to the absence of color discrimination, vision in lights of normal intensity is difficult. While normally rare, achromatopsia is very common on the island of [[Pingelap]], a part of the [[Pohnpei]] state, [[Federated States of Micronesia]], where it is called ''maskun'': about 10% of the population there has it, and 30% are unaffected carriers. The island was devastated by a storm in the 18th century, and one of the few male survivors carried a gene for achromatopsia; the population is now several thousand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eye-disease.info/achromatopsia.php {{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Cone monochromacy]]''' is the condition of having both rods and cones, but only a single kind of cone. A cone monochromat can have good pattern vision at normal daylight levels, but will not be able to distinguish hues. ''' Blue cone monochromacy (X chromosome)''' is caused by a complete absence of L and M cones (red and green). It is encoded at the same place as red–green color blindness on the X chromosome. Peak spectral sensitivities are in the blue region of the visible spectrum (near 440&amp;nbsp;nm). People with this condition generally show [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] (&quot;jiggling eyes&quot;), photophobia (light sensitivity), reduced [[visual acuity]], and [[myopia]] (nearsightedness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weiss AH, Biersdorf WR |title=Blue cone monochromatism |journal=J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=218–23 |year=1989 |pmid=2795409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Visual acuity usually falls to the 20/50 to 20/400 range.

====Dichromacy====

Protanopes, deuteranopes, and tritanopes are dichromats; that is, they can match any color they see with some mixture of just two spectral lights (whereas normally humans are [[trichromat]]s and require three lights). These individuals normally know they have a color vision problem and it can affect their lives on a daily basis. Protanopes and deuteranopes see no perceptible difference between red, orange, yellow, and green. All these colors, that seem so different to the normal viewer, appear to be the same color for this two percent of the population. The terms protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia come from Greek, and literally mean &quot;inability to see (''anopia'') with the first (''prot-''), second (''deuter-''), or third (''trit-'') [cone]&quot;, respectively.

Only official tests administered in person are reliable for diagnosis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This image contains the number 37, but someone who is protanopic may not be able to see it.]]

* '''Protanopia''' (1% of males): Lacking the long-wavelength sensitive retinal cones, those with this condition are unable to distinguish between colors in the green–yellow–red section of the spectrum. They have a neutral point at a greenish wavelength around 492 [[nanometre|nm]] – that is, they cannot discriminate light of this wavelength from white. For the protanope, the brightness of red, orange, and yellow are much reduced compared to normal. This dimming can be so pronounced that reds may be confused with black or dark gray, and red traffic lights may appear to be extinguished. They may learn to distinguish reds from yellows and from greens primarily on the basis of their apparent brightness or lightness, not on any perceptible hue difference. Violet, lavender, and purple are indistinguishable from various shades of blue because their reddish components are so dimmed as to be invisible. for example, pink flowers, reflecting both red light and blue light, may appear just blue to the protanope. Very few people have been found who have one normal eye and one protanopic eye. These ''unilateral dichromats'' report that with only their protanopic eye open, they see wavelengths below the neutral point as blue and those above it as yellow. This is a rare form of color blindness.

[[Image:Colorblind4.png|thumb|'''Test for deuteranopia'''&lt;ref group=Note name=&quot;tests&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This image shows a number 49, but someone who is deuteranopic may not be able to see it.]]

* '''Deuteranopia''' (1% of males): Lacking the medium-wavelength cones, those affected are again unable to distinguish between colors in the green–yellow–red section of the spectrum. Their neutral point is at a slightly longer wavelength, 498&amp;nbsp;nm. The deuteranope suffers the same hue discrimination problems as the protanope, but without the abnormal dimming. Similarly, violet, lavender, purple, and blue, seem to be too many names to use logically for hues that all look alike to him. This is one of the rarer forms of colorblindness making up about 1% of the male population, also known as ''Daltonism'' after [[John Dalton (scientist)|John Dalton]]. (Dalton's diagnosis was confirmed as deuteranopia in 1995, some 150 years after his death, by [[DNA]] analysis of his preserved eyeball.) Deuteranopic unilateral dichromats report that with only their deuteranopic eye open, they see wavelengths below the neutral point as blue and those above it as yellow.&lt;ref&gt;

* '''Tritanopia''' (less than 1% of males and females): Lacking the short-wavelength cones, those affected are unable to distinguish colors along the blue–yellow dimension. This form of color blindness is not sex-linked.

====Anomalous trichromacy====

Those with protanomaly, deuteranomaly, or tritanomaly are trichromats, but the color matches they make differ from the normal. They are called anomalous trichromats. In order to match a given spectral yellow light, protanomalous observers need more red light in a red/green mixture than a normal observer, and deuteranomalous observers need more green. From a practical standpoint though, many protanomalous and deuteranomalous people have very little difficulty carrying out tasks that require normal color vision. Some may not even be aware that their color perception is in any way different from normal.

Protanomaly and deuteranomaly can be diagnosed using an instrument called an [[anomaloscope]], which mixes spectral red and green lights in variable proportions, for comparison with a fixed spectral yellow. If this is done in front of a large audience of males, as the proportion of red is increased from a low value, first a small proportion of the audience will declare a match, while most will see the mixed light as greenish; these are the deuteranomalous observers. Next, as more red is added the majority will say that a match has been achieved. Finally, as yet more red is added, the remaining, protanomalous, observers will declare a match at a point where normal observers will see the mixed light as definitely reddish.
* '''Protanomaly''' (1% of males, 0.01% of females):&lt;ref name=&quot;KallColor&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://webvision.med.utah.edu/KallColor.html#deficiencies | title = Psychophysics of Vision: The Perception of Color | author = Kalloniatis, Michael and Luu, Charles | accessdate = 2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having a mutated form of the long-wavelength (red) pigment, whose peak sensitivity is at a shorter wavelength than in the normal retina, protanomalous individuals are less sensitive to red light than normal. This means that they are less able to discriminate colors, and they do not see mixed lights as having the same colors as normal observers. They also suffer from a darkening of the red end of the spectrum. This causes reds to reduce in intensity to the point where they can be mistaken for black. Protanomaly is a fairly rare form of color blindness, making up about 1% of the male population. Both protanomaly and deuteranomaly are carried on the X chromosome.
* '''Deuteranomaly''' (most common — 6% of males, 0.4% of females):&lt;ref name=&quot;KallColor&quot;/&gt; Having a mutated form of the medium-wavelength (green) pigment. The medium-wavelength pigment is shifted towards the red end of the spectrum resulting in a reduction in sensitivity to the green area of the spectrum. Unlike protanomaly the intensity of colors is unchanged. This is the most common form of color blindness, making up about 6% of the male population. The deuteranomalous person is considered &quot;green weak&quot;. For example, in the evening, dark green cars appear to be black to Deuteranomalous people. Similar to the protanomates, deuteranomates are poor at discriminating small differences in [[hue]]s in the red, orange, yellow, green region of the spectrum. They make errors in the naming of hues in this region because the hues appear somewhat shifted towards red. One very important difference between deuteranomalous individuals and protanomalous individuals is deuteranomalous individuals do ''not'' have the loss of &quot;brightness&quot; problem.

===Total color blindness===

''[[Achromatopsia]]'' is strictly defined as the inability to see color. Although the term may refer to acquired disorders such as [[color agnosia]] and [[cerebral achromatopsia]], it typically refers to congenital color vision disorders (i.e. more frequently [[rod monochromacy]] and less frequently [[cone monochromacy]]).&lt;ref name=blom&gt;

In color agnosia and cerebral achromatopsia, a person cannot perceive colors even though the eyes are capable of distinguishing them. Some sources do not consider these to be true color blindness, because the failure is of perception, not of vision. They are forms of [[visual agnosia]].&lt;ref name=blom/&gt;

===Red–green color blindness===

[[Image:XlinkRecessive.jpg|thumb|X-linked recessive inheritance]]

Those with protanopia, deuteranopia, protanomaly, and deuteranomaly have difficulty with discriminating red and green hues.
It is [[sex-linked]]: genetic red–green color blindness affects males much more often than females, because the [[gene]]s for the red and green color receptors are located on the X [[chromosome]], of which males have only one and females have two. Females (46, XX) are red–green color blind only if ''both'' their X chromosomes are defective with a similar deficiency, whereas males (46, XY) are color blind if their single X chromosome is defective.

The gene for red–green color blindness is transmitted from a color blind male to all his daughters who are [[Zygosity|heterozygote]] carriers and are usually unaffected. In turn, a carrier woman has a fifty percent chance of passing on a mutated X chromosome region to each of her male offspring. The sons of an affected male will not inherit the trait from him, since they receive his Y chromosome and not his (defective) X chromosome. Should an affected male have children with a carrier or colorblind woman, their daughters may be colorblind by inheriting an affected X chromosome from each parent.

Because one X chromosome is [[Barr body|inactivated]] at random in each cell during a woman's development, it is possible for her to have four different cone types, as when a carrier of protanomaly has a child with a deuteranomalic man. Denoting the normal vision alleles by P and D and the anomalous by p and d, the carrier is PD pD and the man is Pd. The daughter is either PD Pd or pD Pd. Suppose she is pD Pd. Each cell in her body expresses either her mother's chromosome pD or her father's Pd. Thus her red–green sensing will involve both the normal and the anomalous pigments for both colors. Such females are [[tetrachromats]], since they require a mixture of four spectral lights to match an arbitrary light.

===Blue–yellow color blindness===

Those with tritanopia and tritanomaly have difficulty discriminating blueish versus yellowish hues.

Color blindness involving the inactivation of the short-wavelength sensitive cone system (whose absorption spectrum peaks in the bluish-violet) is called '''tritanopia''' or, loosely, blue–yellow color blindness. The tritanopes neutral point occurs near a yellowish 570&amp;nbsp;nm; green is perceived at shorter wavelengths and red at longer wavelengths. Mutation of the short-wavelength sensitive cones is called '''tritanomaly'''. Tritanopia is equally distributed among males and females. Jeremy H. Nathans (with the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]]) proved that the gene coding for the blue receptor lies on chromosome 7, which is shared equally by males and females. Therefore it is not sex-linked. This gene does not have any neighbor whose DNA sequence is similar. Blue color blindness is caused by a simple mutation in this gene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard Hughes Medical Institute&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hhmi.org/senses/b130.html | publisher = Howard Hughes Medical Institute | title = Seeing, Hearing and Smelling the World, a Report for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute | accessdate=2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viewers with [[dichromacy]] or anomalous [[trichromacy]] may read it as &quot;21&quot;, and viewers with [[achromatopsia]] may not see numbers.]]
[[Image:Ishihara compare 1.jpg|right|thumb|An Ishihara test image as seen by subjects with normal color vision and by those with a variety of color deficiencies]]

The [[Ishihara color test]], which consists of a series of pictures of colored spots, is the test most often used to diagnose red–green color deficiencies.
A figure (usually one or more [[Arabic numerals|Arabic digits]]) is embedded in the picture as a number of spots in a slightly different color, and can be seen with normal color vision, but not with a particular color defect.
The full set of tests has a variety of figure/background color combinations, and enable diagnosis of which particular visual defect is present.
The anomaloscope, described above, is also used in diagnosing anomalous trichromacy.

Because the Ishihara color test contains only numerals, it may not be useful in diagnosing young children, who have not yet learned to use numerals. In the interest of identifying these problems early on in life, alternative color vision tests were developed using only symbols (square, circle, car).

Besides the Ishihara color test, the US Navy and US Army also allow testing with the [[Farnsworth Lantern Test]]. This test allows 30% of color deficient individuals, whose deficiency is not too severe, to pass.

Most clinical tests are designed to be fast, simple, and effective at identifying broad categories of color blindness. In academic studies of color blindness, on the other hand, there is more interest in developing flexible tests to collect thorough datasets, identify [[copunctal point]]s, and measure [[just noticeable difference]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Toufeeq A |title=Specifying colours for colour vision testing using computer graphics |journal=Eye (Lond) |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=1001–5 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15192692 |doi=10.1038/sj.eye.6701378 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==

There is generally no treatment to cure color deficiencies. However, certain types of tinted filters and contact lenses may help an individual to better distinguish different colors. Optometrists can supply a singular red-tint contact lens to wear on the non-dominant eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4998817.html|title=Patent application for contact lens for correction of color blindness|last=Zeltzer, |first=Harry I.|date=March 1991|work=freepatentsonline.com|publisher=FreePatentsOnline.com|accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may enable the wearer to pass some color blindness tests, but they have little practical use. The effect of wearing such a device is akin to wearing red/blue 3D glasses and can take some time getting used to as certain wavelengths can &quot;jump&quot; out and be overly represented{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}. Additionally, [[computer software]] and cybernetic devices have been developed to assist those with visual color difficulties such as an [[eyeborg]], a &quot;cybernetic eye&quot; that allows individuals with color blindness to hear sounds representing colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/news_features/2005/eyeborg.shtml|title=Seeing things in a different light|last=Anon|date=19 January 2005|work=BBC Devon features|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[GNOME]] [[desktop environment]] provides colorblind accessibility using the gnome-mag and the libcolorblind software. Using a gnome applet, the user may switch a color filter on and off choosing from a set of possible color transformations that will displace the colors in order to disambiguate them. The software enables, for instance, a color blind person to see the numbers in the Ishihara test.

In September 2009, the journal [[Nature]] reported that researchers at the [[University of Washington]] and [[University of Florida]] were able to give trichromatic vision to [[squirrel monkeys]], which normally have only dichromatic vision, using [[gene therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dolgin E |date=2009-09-16 |title=Colour blindness corrected by gene therapy |journal=Nature News |doi=10.1038/news.2009.921 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090916/full/news.2009.921.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==

Color blindness affects a significant number of people, although exact proportions vary among groups. In Australia, for example, it occurs in about 8 percent of males and only about 0.4 percent of females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Colour_blindness | publisher = Better Health Channel | title = Colour blindness | accessdate = 2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isolated communities with a restricted gene pool sometimes produce high proportions of color blindness, including the less usual types. Examples include rural [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], and some of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] islands. In the United States, about 7 percent of the male population – or about 10.5 million men – and 0.4 percent of the female population either cannot distinguish red from green, or see red and green differently from how others do (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard Hughes Medical Institute&quot;/&gt; It has been found that more than 95 percent of all variations in human color vision involve the red and green receptors in male eyes. It is very rare for males or females to be &quot;blind&quot; to the blue end of the spectrum.

==Society and culture==
===Design implications of color blindness===

[[Color code]]s present particular problems for those with color deficiences as they are often difficult or impossible for them to perceive.

Good [[graphic design]] avoids using color coding or using color contrasts alone to express information; this not only helps color blind people, but also aids understanding by normally sighted people.

Designers need to take into account that color-blindness is highly sensitive to differences in material. For example, a red–green colorblind person who is incapable of distinguishing colors on a map printed on paper may have no such difficulty when viewing the map on a computer screen or television. In addition, some color blind people find it easier to distinguish problem colors on artificial materials, such as plastic or in acrylic paints, than on natural materials, such as paper or wood. Third, for some color blind people, color can only be distinguished if there is a sufficient &quot;mass&quot; of color: thin lines might appear black while a thicker line of the same color can be perceived as having color.

When the need to process visual information as rapidly as possible arises, for example in an emergency situation, the visual system may operate only in shades of gray, with the extra information load in adding color being dropped.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} This is an important possibility to consider when designing, for example, emergency brake handles or emergency phones.

===Occupations===

Color blindness may make it difficult or impossible for a person to engage in certain occupations. Persons with color blindness may be legally or practically barred from occupations in which color perception is an essential part of the job (''e.g.,'' mixing paint colors), or in which color perception is important for safety (''e.g.,'' operating vehicles in response to color-coded signals). This occupational safety principle originates from the Lagerlunda train crash of 1875 in Sweden. Following the crash, Professor [[Alarik Frithiof Holmgren]], a physiologist, investigated and concluded that the color blindness of the engineer (who had died) had caused the crash. Professor Holmgren then created the first test using different-colored skeins to exclude people from jobs in the transportation industry on the basis of color blindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1475-1313.1986.tb01155.x |author=Vingrys AJ, Cole BL |title=Origins of colour vision standards within the transport industry |journal=Ophthalmic Physiol Opt |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=369–75 |year=1986 |pmid=3306566 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Driving motor vehicles===

Some countries (for example, [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]) have refused to grant individuals with color blindness driving licenses.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} In Romania, there is an ongoing campaign to remove the legal restrictions that prohibit colorblind citizens from getting drivers' licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://discromat.wordpress.com/2007/08/15/time-out/ | title = Petition to European Union on Colorblind’s condition in Romania | accessdate = 2007-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual justification for such restrictions is that drivers of motor vehicles must be able to recognize color-coded signals, such as [[traffic lights]] or warning lights.

===Piloting aircraft===

While many aspects of aviation depend on color coding, only a few of them are critical enough to be interfered with by some milder types of color blindness. Some examples include color-gun signaling of aircraft that have lost radio communication, color-coded glide-path indications on runways, and the like. Some jurisdictions restrict the issuance of pilot credentials to persons who suffer from color blindness for this reason. Restrictions may be partial, allowing color-blind persons to obtain certification but with restrictions, or total, in which case color-blind persons are not permitted to obtain piloting credentials at all.

In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] requires that pilots be tested for normal color vision as part of the medical certification that is prerequisite to obtaining a pilot's license. If testing reveals color blindness, the applicant may be issued a license with restrictions, such as no night flying and no flying by color signals&amp;mdash;such a restriction effectively prevents a pilot from working for an airline. The government allows several types of tests, including medical standard tests (''e.g.,'' the [[Shinobu Ishihara|Ishihara]], [[Israel Dvorine|Dvorine]], and others) and specialized tests oriented specifically to the needs of aviation. If an applicant fails the standard tests, he or she will receive a restriction on their medical certificate that states- &quot;Not valid for night flying or by color signal control.&quot; He/she may apply to the FAA to take a specialized test, administered by the FAA. Typically, this test is the &quot;color vision light gun test.&quot; For this test an FAA inspector will meet the pilot at an airport with an operating control tower, and the color signal light gun will be shone at the pilot from the tower, and he or she must identify the color. If he passes, he may be issued a waiver, which states that the color vision test is no longer required during medical examinations. He will then receive a new medical certificate with the restriction removed. This was once a Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA), but the SODA was dropped, and converted to a simple waiver (letter) early in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/app_process/exam_tech/item52/amd/ | title = Aerospace Medical Dispositions — Color vision | accessdate = 2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in 2009 carried out by the [[City University of London]]'s Applied Vision Research Centre, sponsored by the UK's [[Civil Aviation Authority]] and the US Federal Aviation Administration, has established a more accurate assessment of colour deficiencies in pilot applicants' red–green and yellow–blue colour range which could lead to a 35% reduction in the number of prospective pilots who fail to meet the minimum medical threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/05/29/327137/colour-blindness-research-could-clear-more-pilots-to-fly-uk.html|title=Colour-blindness research could clear more pilots to fly: UK CAA |last=Warburton|first=Simon|date=29 May 2009|work=Air transport|publisher=Reed Business Information|accessdate=29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===

Inability to distinguish color does not necessarily preclude the ability to become a celebrated artist. The expressionist painter [[Clifton Pugh]], three-time winner of Australia's [[Archibald Prize]], on biographical, gene inheritance and other grounds has been identified as a protanope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cole BL, Harris RW |title=Colour blindness does not preclude fame as an artist: celebrated Australian artist Clifton Pugh was a protanope |journal=Clin Exp Optom |volume=92 |issue=5 |pages=421–8 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19515095 |doi=10.1111/j.1444-0938.2009.00384.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19th century French artist [[Charles Méryon]] became successful by concentrating on [[etching]] rather than painting after he was diagnosed as having a red–green deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/charles-m-ryon|title=Charles Meryon|last=Anon|work=Art Encyclopedia. The Concise Grove Dictionary of Art.|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misconceptions and compensations==

[[Image:Braeburn GrannySmith dichromat sim.jpg|right|thumb|190px|Simulation of the normal (above) and dichromatic (below) perception of red and green apples.]]

Color blindness is not the swapping of colors by the observer&amp;nbsp;— grass is never red, and stop signs are never green. The color impaired do not learn to call red &quot;green&quot; and vice versa. However, dichromats often confuse red and green items. For example, they may find it difficult to distinguish a [[Braeburn]] apple from a [[Granny Smith]] and in some cases, the red and green of a traffic light without other clues (for example,, shape or location). The vision of dichromats may also be compared to images produced by a color printer that has run out of the ink in one of its three color cartridges (for protanopes and deuteranopes, the red cartridge, and for tritanopes, the yellow cartridge).

Dichromats tend to learn to use texture and shape clues and so are often able to penetrate camouflage that has been designed to deceive individuals with color-normal vision.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan&quot;/&gt;

Traffic light colors are confusing to some dichromats as there is insufficient apparent difference between the red/amber traffic lights, and that of sodium street lamps; also the green can be confused with a grubby white lamp. This is a risk factor on high-speed undulating roads where angular cues can't be used. British Rail color lamp signals use more easily identifiable colors: the red is really blood red, the amber is quite yellow and the green is a bluish color. Most British road traffic lights are mounted vertically on a black rectangle with a white border (forming a &quot;sighting board&quot;) and so dichromats simply look for the position of the light within the rectangle&amp;nbsp;— top, middle or bottom. In the Eastern provinces of Canada horizontally-mounted traffic lights are generally differentiated by shape to facilitate identification for those with color blindness.[[Image:Colourblind traffic signal.JPG|right|thumb|190px|Horizontal traffic light in Halifax, NS Canada]]

Color blindness very rarely means complete monochromatism. In almost all cases, color blind people retain blue–yellow discrimination, and most color-blind individuals are anomalous trichromats rather than complete dichromats. In practice this means that they often retain a limited discrimination along the red–green axis of color space, although their ability to separate colors in this dimension is severely reduced.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2010}}
'''Computer security ''' is a branch of computer technology known as [[information security]] as applied to [[computer]]s and networks. The objective of computer security includes protection of information and property from theft, corruption, or natural disaster, while allowing the information and property to remain accessible and productive to its intended users.  The term computer system security means the collective processes and mechanisms by which sensitive and valuable information and services are protected from publication, tampering or collapse by unauthorized activities or untrustworthy individuals and unplanned events respectively. The strategies and methodologies of computer security often differ from most other computer technologies because of its somewhat elusive objective of preventing unwanted computer behavior instead of enabling wanted computer behavior.

== Security by design ==
{{Main|Security by design}}
The technologies of computer security are based on [[logic]]. As security is not necessarily the primary goal of most computer applications, designing a program with security in mind often imposes restrictions on that program's behavior.

There are 4 approaches to [[security]] in [[computing]], sometimes a combination of approaches is valid:
#Trust all the software to abide by a security policy but the software is not trustworthy (this is [[computer insecurity]]).
#Trust all the software to abide by a security policy and the software is validated as trustworthy (by tedious branch and path analysis for example).
#Trust no software but enforce a security policy with [[protection mechanism|mechanisms]] that are not trustworthy (again this is [[computer insecurity]]).
#Trust no software but enforce a security policy with trustworthy hardware mechanisms.

Many systems have unintentionally resulted in the first possibility. Since approach two is expensive and non-deterministic, its use is very limited. Approaches one and three lead to failure. Because approach number four is often based on hardware mechanisms and avoids abstractions and a multiplicity of degrees of freedom, it is more practical. Combinations of approaches two and four are often used in a layered architecture with thin layers of two and thick layers of four.

There are various strategies and techniques used to design security systems. However, there are few, if any, effective strategies to enhance security after design. One technique enforces the [[principle of least privilege]] to great extent, where an entity has only the privileges that are needed for its function. That way even if an [[attacker]] gains access to one part of the system, fine-grained security ensures that it is just as difficult for them to access the rest.

Furthermore, by breaking the system up into smaller components, the complexity of individual components is reduced, opening up the possibility of using techniques such as [[automated theorem proving]] to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystems. This enables a [[closed form solution]] to security that works well when only a single well-characterized property can be isolated as critical, and that property is also assessable to math. Not surprisingly, it is impractical for generalized correctness, which probably cannot even be defined, much less proven. Where formal correctness proofs are not possible, rigorous use of [[code review]] and [[unit testing]] represent a best-effort approach to make modules secure.

The design should use &quot;[[Defense in depth (computing)|defense in depth]]&quot;, where more than one subsystem needs to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it holds. Defense in depth works when the breaching of one security measure does not provide a platform to facilitate subverting another. Also, the cascading principle acknowledges that several low hurdles does not make a high hurdle. So cascading several weak mechanisms does not provide the safety of a single stronger mechanism.

Subsystems should default to secure settings, and wherever possible should be designed to &quot;fail secure&quot; rather than &quot;fail insecure&quot; (see [[fail-safe]] for the equivalent in safety engineering). Ideally, a secure system should require a deliberate, conscious, knowledgeable and free decision on the part of legitimate authorities in order to make it insecure.

In addition, security should not be an all or nothing issue. The designers and operators of systems should assume that security breaches are inevitable.
Full [[audit trail]]s should be kept of system activity, so that when a security breach occurs, the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined. Storing audit trails remotely, where they can only be appended to, can keep intruders from covering their tracks. Finally, [[full disclosure]] helps to ensure that when bugs are found the &quot;[[vulnerability (computing)|window of vulnerability]]&quot; is kept as short as possible.

== Security architecture ==
{{Main|Security architecture}}
Security Architecture can be defined as the design artifacts that describe how the security controls (security countermeasures) are positioned, and how they relate to the overall information technology architecture. These controls serve the purpose to maintain the system's quality attributes, among them [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], [[availability]], [[accountability]] and [[assurance]].&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensecurityarchitecture.com Definitions: IT Security Architecture]. SecurityArchitecture.org, Jan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hardware mechanisms that protect computers and data ==
Hardware based or assisted computer security offers an alternative to software-only computer security. Devices such as [[dongle]]s may be considered more secure due to the physical access required in order to be compromised{{or|date=December 2010}}.

== Secure operating systems ==
{{Main|Secure operating systems}}
One use of the term computer security refers to technology to implement a secure [[operating system]]. Much of this technology is based on science developed in the 1980s and used to produce what may be some of the most impenetrable operating systems ever. Though still valid, the technology is in limited use today, primarily because it imposes some changes to system management and also because it is not widely understood. Such ultra-strong secure operating systems are based on [[operating system kernel]] technology that can guarantee that certain security policies are absolutely enforced in an operating environment. An example of such a [[Computer security policy]] is the [[Bell-LaPadula model]]. The strategy is based on a coupling of special [[microprocessor]] hardware features, often involving the [[memory management unit]], to a special correctly implemented operating system kernel. This forms the foundation for a secure operating system which, if certain critical parts are designed and implemented correctly, can ensure the absolute impossibility of penetration by hostile elements. This capability is enabled because the configuration not only imposes a security policy, but in theory completely protects itself from corruption. Ordinary operating systems, on the other hand, lack the features that assure this maximal level of security. The design methodology to produce such secure systems is precise, deterministic and logical.

Systems designed with such methodology represent the state of the art{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}&lt;!--WHAT ART?--&gt; of computer security although products using such security are not widely known. In sharp contrast to most kinds of software, they meet specifications with verifiable certainty comparable to specifications for size, weight and power. Secure operating systems designed this way are used primarily to protect national security information, military secrets, and the data of international financial institutions. These are very powerful security tools and very few secure operating systems have been certified at the highest level ([[Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria|Orange Book]] A-1) to operate over the range of &quot;Top Secret&quot; to &quot;unclassified&quot; (including Honeywell SCOMP, USAF SACDIN, NSA Blacker and Boeing MLS LAN.) The assurance of security depends not only on the soundness of the design strategy, but also on the assurance of correctness of the implementation, and therefore there are degrees of security strength defined for COMPUSEC. The [[Common Criteria]] quantifies security strength of products in terms of two components, security functionality and assurance level (such as EAL levels), and these are specified in a [[Protection Profile]] for requirements and a [[Security Target]] for product descriptions. None of these ultra-high assurance secure general purpose operating systems have been produced for decades or certified under Common Criteria.

In USA parlance, the term High Assurance usually suggests the system has the right security functions that are implemented robustly enough to protect DoD and DoE classified information. Medium assurance suggests it can protect less valuable information, such as income tax information. Secure operating systems designed to meet medium robustness levels of security functionality and assurance have seen wider use within both government and commercial markets. Medium robust systems may provide the same security functions as high assurance secure operating systems but do so at a lower assurance level (such as Common Criteria levels EAL4 or EAL5). Lower levels mean we can be less certain that the security functions are implemented flawlessly, and therefore less dependable. These systems are found in use on web servers, guards, database servers, and management hosts and are used not only to protect the data stored on these systems but also to provide a high level of protection for network connections and routing services.

== Secure coding ==
{{Main|Secure coding}}
If the operating environment is not based on a secure operating system capable of maintaining a domain for its own execution, and capable of protecting application code from malicious subversion, and capable of protecting the system from subverted code, then high degrees of security are understandably not possible. While such secure operating systems are possible and have been implemented, most commercial systems fall in a 'low security' category because they rely on features not supported by secure operating systems (like portability, and others). In low security operating environments, applications must be relied on to participate in their own protection. There are 'best effort' secure coding practices that can be followed to make an application more resistant to malicious subversion.

In commercial environments, the majority of software subversion [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] result from a few known kinds of coding defects. Common software defects include [[buffer overflows]], [[format string vulnerabilities]], [[integer overflow]], and [[Code injection|code/command injection]]. It is to be immediately noted that all of the foregoing are specific instances of a general class of attacks, where situations in which putative &quot;data&quot; actually contains implicit or explicit, executable instructions are cleverly exploited.

Some common languages such as C and C++ are vulnerable to all of these defects (see [http://www.cert.org/books/secure-coding Seacord, ''&quot;Secure Coding in C and C++&quot;'']). Other languages, such as Java, are more resistant to some of these defects, but are still prone to code/command injection and other software defects which facilitate subversion.

Recently another bad coding practice has come under scrutiny; [[dangling pointer]]s. The first known exploit for this particular problem was presented in July 2007. Before this publication the problem was known but considered to be academic and not practically exploitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid14_gci1265116,00.html New hacking technique exploits common programming error]. SearchSecurity.com, July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, there is no theoretical model of &quot;secure coding&quot; practices, nor is one practically achievable, insofar as the variety of mechanisms are too wide and the manners in which they can be exploited are too variegated. It is interesting to note, however, that such vulnerabilities often arise from archaic philosophies in which computers were assumed to be narrowly disseminated entities used by a chosen few, all of whom were likely highly educated, solidly trained academics with naught but the goodness of mankind in mind. Thus, it was considered quite harmless if, for (fictitious) example, a FORMAT string in a FORTRAN program could contain the J format specifier to mean &quot;shut down system after printing.&quot; After all, who would use such a feature but a well-intentioned system programmer? It was simply beyond conception that software could be deployed in a destructive fashion.

It is worth noting that, in some languages, the distinction between code (ideally, read-only) and data (generally read/write) is blurred. In LISP, particularly, there is no distinction whatsoever between code and data, both taking the same form: an S-expression can be code, or data, or both, and the &quot;user&quot; of a LISP program who manages to insert an executable LAMBDA segment into putative &quot;data&quot; can achieve arbitrarily general and dangerous functionality. Even something as &quot;modern&quot; as Perl offers the eval() function, which enables one to generate Perl code and submit it to the interpreter, disguised as string data.

== Capabilities and access control lists ==
{{Main|Access control list|Capability (computers)}}
Within computer systems, two security models capable of enforcing privilege separation are [[access control list]]s (ACLs) and [[capability-based security]]. The semantics of ACLs have been proven to be insecure in many situations, for example,, the [[confused deputy problem]]. It has also been shown that the promise of ACLs of giving access to an object to only one person can never be guaranteed in practice. Both of these problems are resolved by capabilities. This does not mean practical flaws exist in all ACL-based systems, but only that the designers of certain utilities must take responsibility to ensure that they do not introduce flaws.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Capabilities have been mostly restricted to research [[operating system]]s and commercial OSs still use ACLs. Capabilities can, however, also be implemented at the language level, leading to a style of programming that is essentially a refinement of standard object-oriented design. An open source project in the area is the [[E programming language|E language]].

First the Plessey [[System 250]] and then Cambridge [[CAP computer]] demonstrated the use of capabilities, both in hardware and software, in the 1970s. A reason for the lack of adoption of capabilities may be that ACLs appeared to offer a 'quick fix' for security without pervasive redesign of the operating system and hardware.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The most secure computers are those not connected to the Internet and shielded from any interference. In the real world, the most security comes from [[operating system]]s where [[security]] is not an add-on.

== Applications ==
Computer security is critical in almost any technology-driven industry which operates on computer systems. Computer security can also be referred to as computer safety. The issues of computer based systems and addressing their countless vulnerabilities are an integral part of maintaining an operational industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAA Computer Security&quot;&gt;J. C. Willemssen, &quot;FAA Computer Security&quot;. GAO/T-AIMD-00-330. Presented at Committee on Science, House of Representatives, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cloud computing security ===

Security in the cloud is challenging{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}, due to varied degree of security features and management schemes within the cloud entitites. In this connection one logical protocol base need to evolve so that the entire gamet of components operates synchronously and securely{{or|date=December 2010}}.

=== Aviation ===
The aviation industry is especially important when analyzing computer security because the involved risks include human life, expensive equipment, cargo, and transportation infrastructure. Security can be compromised by hardware and software malpractice, human error, and faulty operating environments. Threats that exploit computer vulnerabilities can stem from sabotage, espionage, industrial competition, terrorist attack, mechanical malfunction, and human error.&lt;ref name =&quot;Computer Security in Aviation&quot;&gt;P. G. Neumann, &quot;Computer Security in Aviation,&quot; presented at International Conference on Aviation Safety and Security in the 21st Century, White House Commission on Safety and Security, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The consequences of a successful deliberate or inadvertent misuse of a computer system in the aviation industry range from loss of confidentiality to loss of system integrity, which may lead to more serious concerns such as data theft or loss, network and [[air traffic control]] outages, which in turn can lead to airport closures, loss of aircraft, loss of passenger life. [[Military]] systems that control munitions can pose an even greater risk.

A proper attack does not need to be very high tech or well funded; for a power outage at an airport alone can cause repercussions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;J. Zellan, Aviation Security. Hauppauge, NY: Nova Science, 2003, pp. 65–70.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the easiest and, arguably, the most difficult to trace security vulnerabilities is achievable by transmitting unauthorized communications over specific radio frequencies. These transmissions may spoof air traffic controllers or simply disrupt communications altogether. These incidents are very common, having altered flight courses of commercial aircraft and caused panic and confusion in the past.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Controlling aircraft over oceans is especially dangerous because radar surveillance only extends 175 to 225 miles offshore. Beyond the radar's sight controllers must rely on periodic radio communications with a third party.

Lightning, power fluctuations, surges, [[brown-out]]s, blown fuses, and various other power outages instantly disable all computer systems, since they are dependent on an electrical source. Other accidental and intentional faults have caused significant disruption of safety critical systems throughout the last few decades and dependence on reliable communication and electrical power only jeopardizes computer safety.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In 1994, over a hundred intrusions were made by unidentified crackers into the Rome Laboratory, the US Air Force's main command and research facility. Using [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]] viruses, hackers were able to obtain unrestricted access to Rome's networking systems and remove traces of their activities. The intruders were able to obtain classified files, such as air tasking order systems data and furthermore able to penetrate connected networks of [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s Goddard Space Flight Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, some Defense contractors, and other private sector organizations, by posing as

== Terminology ==
{{cleanup|section|date=November 2010}}
The following terms used in engineering secure systems are explained below.
* [[Authentication]] techniques can be used to ensure that communication end-points are who they say they are.
* [[Automated theorem proving]] and other verification tools can enable critical algorithms and code used in secure systems to be mathematically proven to meet their specifications.
* [[Capability (computers)|Capability]] and [[access control list]] techniques can be used to ensure privilege separation and mandatory access control. [[Computer_security#Capabilities_vs._ACLs|This section]] discusses their use.
* [[Chain of trust]] techniques can be used to attempt to ensure that all software loaded has been certified as authentic by the system's designers.
* [[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] techniques can be used to defend data in transit between systems, reducing the probability that data exchanged between systems can be intercepted or modified.
* [[Firewall (computing)|Firewall]]s can provide some protection from online intrusion.

* A [[Microkernel#Microkernel|microkernel]] is a carefully crafted, deliberately small corpus of software that underlies the operating system ''per se'' and is used solely to provide very low-level, very precisely defined primitives upon which an operating system can be developed. A simple example with considerable didactic value is the early '90s GEMSOS (Gemini Computers), which provided extremely low-level primitives, such as &quot;segment&quot; management, atop which an operating system could be built. The theory (in the case of &quot;segments&quot;) was that&amp;mdash;rather than have the operating system itself worry about mandatory access separation by means of military-style labeling&amp;mdash;it is safer if a low-level, independently scrutinized module can be charged '''solely''' with the management of individually labeled segments, be they memory &quot;segments&quot; or file system &quot;segments&quot; or executable text &quot;segments.&quot; If software below the visibility of the operating system is (as in this case) charged with labeling, there is no theoretically viable means for a clever hacker to subvert the labeling scheme, since the operating system ''per se'' does '''not''' provide mechanisms for interfering with labeling: the operating system is, essentially, a client (an &quot;application,&quot; arguably) atop the microkernel and, as such, subject to its restrictions.

* Endpoint Security software helps networks to prevent data theft and virus infection through portable storage devices, such as USB drives.

''Some of the following items may belong to the [[computer insecurity]] article:''
&lt;div id=&quot;unpatched&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- the previous div tag is needed by some articles that link to that part of the article --&gt;

* Access [[authorization]] restricts access to a computer to group of users through the use of [[authentication]] systems. These systems can protect either the whole computer – such as through an interactive [[logon]] screen – or individual services, such as an [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server. There are many methods for identifying and authenticating users, such as [[password]]s, [[identification card]]s, and, more recently, [[smart card]]s and [[biometric]] systems.
* [[Anti-virus software]] consists of computer programs that attempt to identify, thwart and eliminate [[computer viruses]] and other malicious software ([[malware]]).
* [[Application software|Applications]] with known security flaws should not be run. Either leave it turned off until it can be patched or otherwise fixed, or delete it and replace it with some other application. Publicly known flaws are the main entry used by [[Computer worm|worms]] to automatically break into a system and then spread to other systems connected to it. The security website [[Secunia]] provides a search tool for unpatched known flaws in popular products.
* [[Backup]]s are a way of securing information; they are another copy of all the important computer files kept in another location. These files are kept on hard disks, [[CD-R]]s, [[CD-RW]]s, and [[Magnetic tape data storage|tapes]]. Suggested locations for backups are a fireproof, waterproof, and heat proof safe, or in a separate, offsite location than that in which the original files are contained. Some individuals and companies also keep their backups in [[safe deposit box]]es inside [[bank vault]]s. There is also a fourth option, which involves using one of the [[file hosting service]]s that backs up files over the [[Internet]] for both business and individuals.
** Backups are also important for reasons other than security. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or tornadoes, may strike the building where the computer is located. The building can be on fire, or an explosion may occur. There needs to be a recent backup at an alternate secure location, in case of such kind of disaster. Further, it is recommended that the alternate location be placed where the same disaster would not affect both locations. Examples of alternate disaster recovery sites being compromised by the same disaster that affected the primary site include having had a primary site in [[World Trade Center]] I and the recovery site in [[7 World Trade Center]], both of which were destroyed in the [[9/11]] attack, and having one's primary site and recovery site in the same coastal region, which leads to both being vulnerable to hurricane damage (for example, primary site in New Orleans and recovery site in [[Jefferson Parish]], both of which were hit by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005). The backup media should be moved between the geographic sites in a secure manner, in order to prevent them from being stolen.
[[File:Encryption - decryption.svg|thumb|300px|[[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] techniques involve transforming information, scrambling it so it becomes unreadable during transmission. The intended recipient can unscramble the message, but eavesdroppers cannot.]]
* [[Encryption]] is used to protect the message from the eyes of others. [[Cryptography|Cryptographically]] secure [[cipher]]s are designed to make any practical attempt of [[cryptanalysis|breaking]] infeasible. [[symmetric-key algorithm|Symmetric-key]] ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using [[shared key]]s, and [[public-key encryption]] using [[digital certificate]]s can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance.
* [[Firewall (networking)|Firewalls]] are systems which help protect computers and computer networks from attack and subsequent intrusion by restricting the network traffic which can pass through them, based on a set of system administrator defined rules.
* [[Honeypot (computing)|Honey pots]] are computers that are either intentionally or unintentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers. They can be used to catch crackers or fix vulnerabilities.
* [[Intrusion-detection system]]s can scan a network for people that are on the network but who should not be there or are doing things that they should not be doing, for example trying a lot of passwords to gain access to the network.
* [[Ping]]ing The ping application can be used by potential crackers to find if an IP address is reachable. If a cracker finds a computer, they can try a port scan to detect and attack services on that computer.
* [[Social engineering (computer security)|Social engineering]] awareness keeps employees aware of the dangers of social engineering and/or having a policy in place to prevent social engineering can reduce successful breaches of the network and servers.
* [[File Integrity Monitor]]s are tools used to detect changes in the integrity of systems and files.

'''Chris Cunningham''' is an [[England|English]] [[music video]] [[film director]] and [[video artist]]. He was born in [[Reading, Berkshire]] in 1970 and grew up in [[Lakenheath]], [[Suffolk]].

The video collection ''[[Directors Label#Volume 2: The Work of Director Chris Cunningham|The Work of Director Chris Cunningham]]'' was released in November 2004 as part of the [[Directors Label]] set. This DVD includes selected highlights from 1995–2000.

== Early work ==

After seeing Cunningham's work on the 1994 film version of ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'', [[Stanley Kubrick]] head hunted Cunningham&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.director-file.com/cunningham/pr06.html |title=Dazed &amp; Confused&amp;nbsp;— Interview with Chris Cunningham |publisher=Director-file.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-30}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; to design and supervise animatronic tests of the central robot child character in his version of the film ''[[A.I. (film)|A.I.]]'' Cunningham worked for over a year on the film ''[[A.I. (film)|A.I.]]'', before leaving to pursue a career as a director.

Earlier work in film included model making, prosthetic make-up and concept illustrations for ''[[Hardware (film)|Hardware]]'' and ''[[Dust Devil (1993 film)|Dust Devil]]'' with director [[Richard Stanley (film director)|Richard Stanley]], as well as ''[[Nightbreed]]''. In 1990–1992 he contributed the occasional cover painting and strip for ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'', working under the pseudonym Chris Halls, the surname of his stepfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2000adonline.com/?zone=droid&amp;page=profiles&amp;choice=CHRISH |title=droid zone |publisher=2000AD Online |date= |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music videos ==

Cunningham has had close ties to [[Warp Records]] since his first production for [[Autechre]]. Videos for [[Aphex Twin]]'s &quot;[[Come to Daddy]]&quot; and &quot;[[Windowlicker]]&quot; are perhaps his best known. His video for [[Björk]]'s &quot;[[All Is Full of Love]]&quot; won multiple awards, including an [[MTV]] music video award for Breakthrough Video and was nominated for a [[Grammy]] for Best Short Form Music Video. It was also the first ever music video to win a Gold Pencil at the [[D&amp;AD]] Awards. It can still be seen at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. His video for [[Aphex Twin]]'s &quot;[[Windowlicker]]&quot; was nominated for the &quot;Best Video&quot; award at the Brit Awards 2000. He also directed [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s &quot;[[Frozen (song)|Frozen]]&quot; video which became an international hit and won the award for &quot;Best Special Effects&quot; at the 1998 MTV Music Video Awards.
'.

== Video art ==

His video installation ''[[Flex (film)|Flex]]'' was first shown in 2000 at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], and subsequently at the [[Anthony d'Offay]] Gallery and other art galleries. ''Flex'' was commissioned by the [[Anthony d'Offay]] Gallery for the [[Apocalypse: Beauty &amp; Horror in Contemporary Art]] exhibition curated by [[Norman Rosenthal]] and Max Wigram at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 2000.

The Anthony d'Offay Gallery also commissioned ''[[Monkey Drummer]]'', a 2½ minute piece intended for exhibition as a companion to ''Flex'' at the 2000 ''Apocalypse'' exhibition at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], however the piece was not finished in time. In it an [[automaton]] with nine appendages and the head of a monkey plays the drums to &quot;Mt Saint Michel + Saint Michaels Mount&quot;, the 10th track on [[Aphex Twin]]'s 2001 album ''[[drukqs]]''.  ''Monkey Drummer'' debuted as part of Cunningham's installation at the 49th International Exhibition of Art at the 2001 [[Venice Biennale]], which consisted of a loop of ''Monkey Drummer'', ''Flex'', and his video for [[Björk]]'s &quot;[[All Is Full of Love]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.director-file.com/cunningham/monkey.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, an excerpt from ''Flex'' was shown in the [[Barbican]]'s exhibition [[Seduced: Art and Sex from Antiquity to Now]] curated by [[Martin Kemp (art historian)|Martin Kemp]], [[Marina Wallace]] and [[Joanne Bernstein]]. alongside other pieces by [[Bacon]], [[Klimt]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Rodin]] and [[Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Seduced,_Art_and_Sex_from_Antiquity_to_Now |title=Seduced, Art and Sex from Antiquity to Now&amp;nbsp;— The Art and Popular Culture Encyclopedia |publisher=Artandpopularculture.com |date=2009-07-18 |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Short films ==

In 2005, Cunningham released the short film ''[[Rubber Johnny]]'' as a DVD accompanied by a book of photographs and drawings. ''Rubber Johnny'', a six-minute experimental short film cut to a soundtrack by [[Aphex Twin]], remixed by Cunningham was shot between 2001 and 2004. Shot on DV night-vision, it was made in Cunningham's own time as a home movie of sorts, and took three and half years of weekends to complete. [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] called it &quot;like a Looney Tunes short for a generation raised on video nasties and rave music&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3642759/Cheap-but-never-cheerful.html | title = Cheap but never cheerful | work = [[Telegraph.co.uk]] | first = Chris | last = Campion | date = 28 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period Cunningham also made another short film for [[Warp Films]], Spectral Musicians, which remains unreleased. The short film was edited to music by [[Squarepusher]], [[My Fucking Sound]], from the album [[Go Plastic]] and a piece called [[Mutilation Colony]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=13:06 |url=http://www.no-future.com/erutufon/showthread.php?t=7237 |title=Squarepusher interview&amp;nbsp;— erutufon |publisher=nofuture |date=2004-03-03 |accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was written especially for the short and was released on the EP [[Do You Know Squarepusher]].

== Commercials ==

Cunningham has directed a handful of commercials for companies including [[Gucci]], [[PlayStation]], [[Levis]], [[Telecom Italia]], [[Nissan]] and [[Orange (brand)|Orange]].

== Music production ==

In 2004/2005, Cunningham took a sabbatical from filmmaking to learn about music production and recording and develop his own music projects.

In December 2007 Cunningham produced two tracks, &quot;Three Decades&quot; and &quot;Primary Colours&quot;, for ''[[Primary Colours (album)|Primary Colours]]'', the second album by [[The Horrors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://drownedinsound.com/news/3050246 | title = Chris Cunningham to make production debut on new Horrors album | work = [[Drowned in Sound]] | first =  Kev | last = Kharas | date = 14 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2008, due to scheduling conflicts with his feature film script writing he couldn't work on the rest of the album which was subsequently recorded by [[Geoff Barrow]] from [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]].

In 2008, he produced and arranged a new version of 'I Feel Love' for the [[Gucci]] commercial that he also directed. He travelled to Nashville to work with [[Donna Summer]] to record a brand new vocal for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dazeddigital.com/Fashion/article/2978/1/ | title = Chris Cunningham Feels Love for Gucci's Flora | work = Dazed Digital | first = Stephen | last = Whelan | date = 15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Chris Cunningham Live'' ==

In 2005, Cunningham played a 45 minute audio visual piece performed live in Tokyo and Osaka in front of 30,000+ fans over the two nights at Japan’s premier electronic music event [[Electraglide]]. These performances evolved into ''[[Chris Cunningham Live]]'', a 55 minute long performance piece combining original and remixed music and film. It features remixed, unreleased and brand new videos and music dynamically edited together into a new live piece spread over three screens. The sound accompanying these images includes Cunningham’s first publicly performed compositions interspersed with his remixes of other artist’s work. ''Chris Cunningham Live'' debuted as one of the headline attractions at [[Warp 20]] in Paris on May 8, 2009 with other performances scheduled at festivals in UK, and a number of European cities later in the year.

== Photography ==

Cunningham has created photography and cover artwork for various people including [[Bjork]]'s &quot;[[All Is Full of Love]]&quot;, [[Aphex Twin]]'s &quot;[[Windowlicker]]&quot; and &quot;[[Come to Daddy]]&quot;.

In 2008, Cunningham produced a fashion shoot for ''[[Dazed &amp; Confused (magazine)|Dazed &amp; Confused]]'' using [[Grace Jones]] as a model to create &quot;Nubian versions&quot; of Rubber Johnny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/ArtsAndCulture/article/1273/1/Chris_Cunningham_Photographs_Grace_Jones_for_DC |title=Grace Jones photoshoot for Dazed and Confused |publisher=Dazeddigital.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview for BBC's &quot;The Culture Show&quot;, it was suggested that the collaboration may expand into a video project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=las_RQI5pn4 |title=Grace Jones Culture Show interview which covers the D&amp;C shoot |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, Cunningham followed on with another photoshoot for ''[[Vice Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viceland.com/int/v15n10/htdocs/chris-cunningham-137.php |title=Chris Cunningham Photoshoot for Vice Magazine |publisher=Viceland.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Neuromancer''==

In 2000, Cunningham and cyberpunk author [[William Gibson]] began work on the script for Gibson's 1984 novel ''[[Neuromancer]]''. However, because ''Neuromancer'' was due to be a big budget studio film, it is rumoured that Cunningham pulled out due to being a first time director without final cut approval.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} He also felt that too much of the original book's ideas had been cannibalised by other recent films.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

On November 18, 2004, in the FAQ on the William Gibson Board, Gibson was asked:

{{quote|Q: Is it true there's a movie of ''Neuromancer'' in the works?

A: Perpetually, it seems, and going on a quarter of a century now. The most recently rumoured version, to have been directed by Chris Cunningham, is now definitely not happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://williamgibsonboard.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/273109857/m/624109857 |title=Here's the FAQ&amp;nbsp;— Topic Powered by Eve Community |publisher=Williamgibsonboard.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an August 1999 ''[[Spike Magazine]]'' interview, Gibson stated &quot;He (Chris) was brought to my attention by someone else. We were told, third-hand, that he was extremely chary of the Hollywood process, and wouldn't return calls. But someone else told us that ''Neuromancer'' had been his ''Wind In The Willows'', that he'd read it when he was a kid. I went to London and we met.&quot; Gibson is also quoted in the article as saying &quot;Chris is my own 100 per cent personal choice...My only choice. The only person I've met who I thought might have a hope in hell of doing it right. I went back to see him in London just after he'd finished the Bjork video, and I sat on a couch beside this dead sex little Bjork robot, except it was wearing Aphex Twin's head. We talked.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spikemagazine.com/0899williamgibson.php |title=William Gibson : All Tomorrow’s Parties : Waiting For The Man |publisher=Spikemagazine.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is rumoured that the character of [[Damien Pease]] in Gibson's 2003 novel ''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]'' was based on Cunningham, with the character's apartment featuring a female robot which had appeared in one of Cunningham's videos.

Development funding was in place for Cunningham to direct and co-write his first feature film for [[Warp Films]], to whom he was at the time committed &quot;for all future full-length film projects.&quot; He has since left Warp Films to set up his own production company 'CC Co' to produce his films independently.

In [[Greek mythology]], a '''centaur''' (from {{lang-grc|'''''Κένταυροι'''''}} – Kéntauroi) or '''hippocentaur'''&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Hippocentaur&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Hippocentaur&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.definitions.net/definition/hippocentaur&lt;/ref&gt; is a member of a composite race of creatures, part [[human]] and part [[horse]]. In early [[Attica|Attic]] and [[Boeotia]]n [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase-paintings]], as on the ''[[kantharos]]'' (''illustrated below left''), they are depicted with the hindquarters of a horse attached to them; in later renderings centaurs are given the torso of a human joined at the waist to the horse's [[withers]], where the horse's neck would be.

This half-human and half-animal composition has led many writers to treat them as [[liminal being]]s, caught between the two natures, embodied in contrasted myths, both as the embodiment of untamed nature, as in their battle with the [[Lapith]]s, or conversely as teachers, like [[Chiron]].

The centaurs were usually said to have been born of [[Ixion]] and [[Nephele]] (the cloud made in the image of [[Hera]]). Another version, however, makes them children of a certain [[Centaurus (Greek mythology)|Centaurus]], who mated with the [[Magnesia Prefecture|Magnesia]]n mares. This Centaurus was either himself the son of Ixion and Nephele (inserting an additional generation) or of [[Apollo]] and [[Stilbe]], daughter of the river god [[Peneus]]. In the later version of the story his twin brother was [[Lapithus]], ancestor of the [[Lapith]]s, thus making the two warring peoples cousins.

Centaurs were said to have inhabited the region of Magnesia and Mount [[Pelion]] in [[Thessaly]], the [[Foloi oak forest]] in [[Elis]], and the Malean peninsula in southern [[Laconia]].

Centaurs continued to figure in literary forms of [[Roman mythology]]. A pair of them draw the chariot of [[Constantine I|Constantine the Great]] and his family in the [[Great Cameo of Constantine]] (''c''314-16), which embodies wholly pagan imagery.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Cameo of Constantine, formerly in the collection of [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and now in the Geld en Bankmuseum, Utrecht, is illustrated, for instance, in Paul Stephenson, ''Constantine, Roman Emperor, Christian Victor'', 2010:fig. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centauromachy==
[[File:Centauromachy Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2640.jpg|thumb|Centauromachy. Tondo of an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]], ca. 480 BC. Staatliche Antikensammlungen, Munich, Germany.]]
The Centaurs are best known for their fight with the [[Lapith]]s, caused by their attempt to carry off [[Hippodamia (wife of Pirithous)|Hippodamia]] and the rest of the Lapith women, on the day of her marriage to [[Pirithous]], king of the Lapithae, himself the son of Ixion. The strife among these cousins is a metaphor for the conflict between the lower appetites and civilized behavior in humankind. [[Theseus]], a hero and founder of cities, who happened to be present, threw the balance in favour of the right order of things, and assisted Pirithous. The Centaurs were driven off or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Theseus,'' 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' xii. 210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]]iv. 69, 70&lt;/ref&gt; Another Lapith hero, [[Caeneus]], who was invulnerable to weapons, was beaten into the earth by Centaurs wielding rocks and the branches of trees. Centaurs are thought of in many Greek myths as wild as untamed horses. Like the [[Titanomachy]], the defeat of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s by the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]], the contests with the Centaurs typify the struggle between civilization and barbarism.

[[Image:Theseus_and_Centaur.jpg|thumb|Theseus Defeats the Centaur (1805-1819) by [[Antonio Canova]] (1857-1822), [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], [[Vienna]].]]

The Centauromachy is most famously portrayed in the [[Parthenon]] [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]] by [[Phidias]] and a Renaissance-era sculpture by [[Battle of the Centaurs (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo]].

==Earliest representations==
The tentative identification of two fragmentary Mycenaean terracotta figures as centaurs,  among the extensive Mycenaean pottery found at [[Ugarit]], suggests a [[Bronze Age]] origin for these creatures of myth.&lt;ref&gt;Ione Mylonas Shear, &quot;Mycenaean Centaurs at Ugarit&quot; ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''122''' (2002:147–153); but see the interpretation relating them to &quot;abbreviated group&quot; figures at the [[Temple of Aphaea|Bronze-Age sanctuary of Aphaia]] and elsewhere, presented by Korinna Pilafidis-Williams, &quot;No Mycenaean Centaurs Yet&quot;, ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''124''' (2004), p. 165, which concludes &quot;we had perhaps do best not to raise hopes of a continuity of images across the divide between the Bronze Age and the historical period.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; A painted terracotta centaur was found in the &quot;Hero's tomb&quot; at [[Lefkandi]], and by the Geometric period, centaurs figure among the first representational figures painted on Greek pottery. An often-published Geometric period bronze of a warrior face-to-face with a centaur is at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;It is illustrated, for example, in John Boardman, Jasper Griffin and Oswyn Murray, ''Greece and the Hellenistic World'' (Oxford History of the Classical World) 1988, vol. I p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of origin==
[[File:Centaur nymph Marqueste Tuileries.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Centaur carrying off a [[nymph]] by [[Laurent Marqueste]], marble, 1892, [[Tuileries Garden]], [[Paris]].]]

The most common theory holds that the idea of centaurs came from the first reaction of a non-riding culture, as in the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Aegean Sea|Aegean world]], to nomads who were mounted on horses. The theory suggests that such riders would appear as half-man, half-animal ([[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] reported that the [[Aztec]]s had this misapprehension about Spanish cavalrymen).&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Chase, ''Mexico: A Study of Two Americas'', Chapter IV ([http://xroads.virginia.edu/~Hyper2/chase/ch04.html University of Virginia Hypertext]). Retrieved 24 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Domestication of the horse|Horse taming and horseback culture]] arose first in the southern [[steppe]] grasslands of [[Central Asia]], perhaps approximately in modern [[Kazakhstan]].

The Lapith tribe of Thessaly, who were the kinsmen of the Centaurs in myth, were described as the inventors of horse-back riding by Greek writers. The Thessalian tribes also claimed their horse breeds were descended from the centaurs.

Of the various Classical Greek authors who mentioned centaurs, [[Pindar]] was the first who describes undoubtedly a combined monster.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...that strange race was born, like to both parents, their mother’s form below, above their sire’s.&quot; (''Second Pythian Ode'').&lt;/ref&gt; Previous authors ([[Homer]]) only uses words such as ''pheres'' (cf. ''theres'', &quot;beasts&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;For example, Homer ''Iliad'' i. 268, ii. 743. Compare the Hesiodic ''[[The Shield of Heracles]]'', 104.&lt;/ref&gt; that could also mean ordinary savage men riding ordinary horses. However, contemporaneous representations of hybrid centaurs can be found in [[Archaic period in Greece|archaic]] [[Greek art]].

[[Lucretius]] in his first century BC philosophical poem ''[[On the Nature of Things]]'' denied the existence of centaurs based on their differing rate of growth. He states that at three years old horses are in the prime of their life while at three humans are still little more than babies, making hybrid animals impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, ''On the Nature of Things'', book V, translated by William Ellery Leonard, 1916 ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Lucr.+5.878 The Perseus Project].) Retrieved 27 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Graves]] (relying on the work of [[Georges Dumezil]]&lt;ref&gt;Dumezil, ''Le Probleme des Centaures''  (Paris 1929) and ''Mitra-Varuna: An essay on two Indo-European representations of sovereignty'' (1948. tr. 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; argued for tracing the centaurs back to the Indian [[gandharva]]), speculated that the centaurs were a dimly remembered, pre-Hellenic fraternal earth cult who had the horse as a [[totem]].&lt;ref&gt;Graves, ''The Greek Myths'', 1960 § 81.4; § 102 &quot;Centaurs&quot;; § 126.3;.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar theory was incorporated into [[Mary Renault]]'s ''[[The Bull from the Sea]].'' [[Kinnara Kingdom|Kinnaras]], another half-man half-horse mythical creature from the [[Indian epic poetry|Indian mythology]], appeared in various ancient texts, arts as well as sculptures from all around India. It is shown as a horse with the torso of a man in place of where the horse's head has to be, that is similar to a Greek centaur.&lt;ref&gt;Devdutt Pattanaik, “Indian mythology : tales, symbols, and rituals from the heart of the Subcontinent” (Rochester, USA 2003)  P.74. : ISBN 0-89281-870-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Krishna Murthy, “Mythical Animals in Indian Art” (New Delhi, India 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Greek word ''kentauros'' is generally regarded as of obscure origin.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Scobie, &quot;The Origins of 'Centaurs'&quot; ''Folklore'' '''89'''.2 (1978:142–147); Scobie quotes [[Martin P. Nilsson]], ''Geschichte der griechischen Religion'', 1955, &quot;Die Etymologie und die Deutung der Ursprungs sind unsicher und mögen auf sich beruhen&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The  [[etymology]] from ''ken – tauros'', &quot;piercing bull-stickers&quot; was a [[euhemerus|Euhemerist]] suggestion in [[Palaephatus]]' rationalizing text on Greek mythology, ''On Incredible Tales'' (Περὶ ἀπίστων): mounted archers from a village called ''[[Nephele]]'' eliminating a herd of bulls that were the scourge of Ixion's kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Scobie 1978:142.&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible related etymology can be &quot;bull-slayer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Hislop]], in his polemic ''[[The Two Babylons]]: Papal Worship Revealed to be the Worship of Nimrod and His Wife''. (1853, revised 1858) theorized that the word is derived from the [[Semitic]] [[Kohen]] and &quot;tor&quot; (to go round) via [[phonetics|phonetic shift]] the less prominent [[consonant]]s being lost over time, with it developing into '''K'''h'''en''' '''Tor''' or ''Ken-Tor'', and being transliterated phonetically into [[Ionic Greek|Ionian]] as ''Kentaur'', but this is not accepted by any modern philologist.&lt;/ref&gt; Some {{Who|date=March 2009}} say that the Greeks took the constellation of [[Centaurus]], and also its name &quot;piercing bull&quot;, from [[Mesopotamia]], where it symbolized the god [[Baal]] who represents rain and fertility, fighting with and ''piercing'' with his horns the demon [[Mot (Semitic god)|Mot]] who represents the summer drought. In Greece, the constellation of Centaurus was noted by  [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] in the fourth century BC and by [[Aratus]] in the third century. 

==Female centaurs==

[[File:Grape harvest Abbatiale Mozac 2007 06 30.jpg|thumb|Centaurs harvest grapes on a 12th-century capital from the [[Mozac Abbey]] in the [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]]]]

Though female centaurs, called [[Kentaurides]], are not mentioned in early Greek literature and art, they do appear occasionally in later antiquity. A [[Macedon]]ian mosaic of the 4th century BC&lt;ref&gt;Pella Archaeological Museum&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the earliest examples of the Centauress in art. [[Ovid]]&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 12. 210 ff., the name Hylonome is Greek so Ovid may have drawn her story from an earlier Greek writer&lt;/ref&gt; also mentions a centauress named [[Hylonome]] who committed suicide when her husband [[Cyllarus]] was killed in the war with the Lapiths.

In a description of a painting in [[Naples|Neapolis]], the Greek rhetorician [[Philostratus III|Philostratus the Elder]] describes them as sisters and wives of the male centaurs who live on Mount Pelion with their children.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;How beautiful the Centaurides are, even where they are horses; for some grow out of white mares, others are attached to chestnut mares, and the coats of others are dappled, but they glisten like those of horses that are well cared for. There is also a white female Centaur that grows out of a black mare, and the very opposition of the colours helps to produce the united beauty of the whole.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Philostratus the Elder, ''Imagines'' 2. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea, or possibility, of female centaurs was certainly known in early modern times, as evidenced by Shakespeare's ''[[King Lear]]'', Act IV, Scene vi, ln.124–125:
&quot;Down from the waist they're centaurs, / Though women all above&quot;

In the Disney animated film ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]'', during the [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Pastoral Symphony]], some of the main characters are female centaurs. However, the Disney studio called them &quot;Centaurettes&quot; instead of Kentaurides.

==Persistence in the medieval world==

[[File:Bova1860.jpg|thumb|left|Prince Bova fights ''Polkan'' in an 1860 Russian [[lubok]]]]

Centaurs preserved a [[Dionysus|Dionysian]] connection in the 12th century [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] carved [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of [[Mozac Abbey]] in the [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]], where other capitals depict harvesters, boys riding goats (a further Dionysiac theme) and [[griffin]]s guarding the [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] that held the wine.

Centaurs are shown on a number of [[Pictish]] carved stones from north-east [[Scotland]], erected in the 8th–9th centuries AD (e.g., at [[Meigle]], [[Perthshire]]).  Though outside the limits of the [[Roman Empire]], these depictions appear to be derived from Classical prototypes.

Jerome's version of the ''Life'' of St [[Anthony the Great]], the hermit monk of Egypt, written by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], was widely disseminated in the Middle Ages; it relates Anthony's encounter with a centaur, who challenged the saint but was forced to admit that the old gods had been overthrown. The episode was often depicted; notably, in the ''The Meeting of St Anthony Abbot and St Paul the Hermit'' by [[Stefano di Giovanni|Stefano di Giovanni called &quot;Sassetta&quot;]],&lt;ref&gt;[[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, DC: [http://www.wga.hu/support/viewer/z.html illustration]&lt;/ref&gt; of two episodic depictions in a single panel of the [[Anthony the Great|hermit Anthony]]'s travel to greet the hermit Paul, one is his encounter along the pathway with the demonic figure of a centaur in a wood.

A centaur-like half-human half-equine creature called ''[[Polkan]]'' appeared in [[Russia]]n [[folk]] [[art]], and [[lubok]] prints of the 17th–19th centuries. Polkan is originally based on ''Pulicane'', a half-dog from [[Andrea da Barberino]]'s poem «I Reali di Francia», which was once popular in Slavonic world in prosaic translations.

The [[John C. Hodges library at The University of Tennessee]] hosts a permanent exhibit of a &quot;Centaur from [[Volos]]&quot;, in its library. The exhibit, made by combining a study human skeleton with the skeleton of a [[Shetland pony]] is entitled &quot;Do you believe in Centaurs?&quot; and was meant to mislead students in order to make them more critically aware, according to the exhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://notes.utk.edu/bio/unistudy.nsf/0/22d591ecc61a2cca85256efd00631d45?OpenDocument| volume=97| issue= 7 or 8| month= August 26| year= 2004| title=Library hails centaur’s 10th anniversary| first=Maggie| last=Anderson| accessdate=2006-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A centaur is one of the symbols associated with both the [[Iota Phi Theta]] and the [[Delta Lambda Phi]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternities]]. Whereas centaurs in Greek mythology were generally symbolic of chaos and unbridled passions, Delta Lambda Phi's centaur is modeled after Chiron and represents [[honour|honor]], [[moderation]] and tempered [[masculinity]].

Similarly, [[C.S. Lewis]]' centaurs from his popular ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series are depicted as wisest and noblest of creatures. They are gifted at stargazing, prophecy, healing, and warfare, a fierce and valiant race always faithful to the High King [[Aslan]] the Lion. Lewis generally used the species to inspire awe in his readers. (For full article, see [[Narnian Centaurs]].)

The 1975 solo album ''[[Ride a Rock Horse]]'' by [[Roger Daltrey]] of [[The Who]] portrays him as a centaur on the album cover. The cover photography is by Graham Hughes.

[[Philip Jose Farmer]]'s ''[[World of Tiers]]'' series (1965) includes centaurs, called Half-Horses or Hoi Kentauroi. His creations address several of the metabolic problems of such creatures—how could the human mouth and nose intake sufficient air to sustain both itself and the horse body and, similarly, how could the human ingest sufficient food to sustain both parts.

In [[Erich Kissing]]'s contemporary paintings he depicts himself and others in hedonistic centaur form.

In J.K. Rowling's ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, centaurs live in the Forbidden Forest close to Hogwarts. Although different from those seen in Narnia. They live in societies called herds and are skilled at archery, healing and astrology. Although film depictions include very animalistic facial features, the reaction of the Hogwarts girls to Firenze suggests a more classical appearance.

[[Brandon Mull]]'s ''[[Fablehaven]]'' series features Centaurs that live in an area called Grunhold. The Centaurs are portrayed as a proud, elitist group of beings that consider themselves superior to all other creatures. The fourth book also has a variation on the species called an Alcetaur, which is part man, part moose.

[[P. C. Cast]]'s Partholon series includes numerous centaur characters, including the protagonist, Brighid, of ''Brighid's Quest''.

In [[Eoin Colfer]]'s ''[[Artemis Fowl (series)|Artemis Fowl]]'' series, centuars are paranoid and smart.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chemotaxis''' is the phenomenon in which somatic cells, [[bacteria]], and other single-cell or [[multicellular]] organisms direct their movements according to certain chemicals in their environment. This is important for bacteria to find food (for example, [[glucose]]) by swimming towards the highest concentration of food molecules, or to flee from [[poison]]s (for example, [[phenol]]). In multicellular organisms, chemotaxis is critical to early development (e.g. movement of [[sperm]] towards the egg during [[fertilization]]) and subsequent phases of development (e.g. migration of [[neuron]]s or [[lymphocyte]]s) as well as in normal function. In addition, it has been recognized that mechanisms that allow chemotaxis in animals can be subverted during [[cancer]] [[metastasis]].

Chemotaxis is called ''positive'' if movement is in the direction of a higher concentration of the chemical in question, and ''negative'' if the direction is opposite.

==History of chemotaxis research==
[[Image:ChtxHist2.png|float|right|450px|Milestones in chemotaxis research]]

[[Neutrophils]] are the body's first line of defense against bacterial infections. After leaving nearby blood vessels, these cells recognize chemicals produced by bacteria in a cut or scratch and migrate &quot;toward the smell&quot;. The above neutrophils were placed in a gradient of [[fMLP]] (N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine), a peptide chain produced by some bacteria. Although migration of cells was detected from the early days of the development of microscopy ([[Leeuwenhoek]]), erudite description of chemotaxis was first made by [[Theodor Wilhelm Engelmann|T W. Engelmann]] (1881) and [[Wilhelm Pfeffer|W.F. Pfeffer]] (1884) in bacteria and [[Herbert Spencer Jennings|H.S. Jennings]] (1906) in [[ciliate]]s. The Nobel Prize laureate [[Élie Metchnikoff|I. Metchnikoff]] also contributed to the study of the field with investigations of the process as an initial step of [[phagocytosis]]. The significance of chemotaxis in biology and clinical pathology was widely accepted in the 1930s. The most fundamental definitions belonging to the phenomenon were also drafted by this time. The most important aspects in quality control of [[chemotaxis assay]]s were described by [[Henry Harris (scientist)|H. Harris]] in the 1950s. In the 1960s and 1970s, the revolution of modern cell biology and biochemistry provided a series of novel techniques which became available to investigate the migratory responder cells and subcellular fractions responsible for chemotactic activity. The pioneering works of [[Julius Adler (biochemist)|J. Adler]] represented a significant turning point in understanding the whole process of intracellular signal transduction of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Julius Adler and Wung-Wai Tso | title=Decision-Making in Bacteria: Chemotactic Response of Escherichia Coli to Conflicting Stimuli | journal=Science | year=1974 | volume=184 | pages=1292–4|pmid=4598187 | doi=10.1126/science.184.4143.1292 | issue=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemoattractants and chemorepellents==
[[Image:Chtx-AttrRep-en.png|float|right|250 px]]

Chemoattractants and chemorepellents are [[inorganic]] or [[organic compound|organic]] substances possessing chemotaxis-inducer effect in motile cells. Effects of chemoattractants are elicited via described or hypothetic chemotaxis [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], the chemoattractant moiety of a [[ligand]] is target cell specific and concentration dependent. Most frequently investigated chemoattractants are [[formyl]] [[peptide]]s and [[chemokine]]s. Responses to chemorepellents result in axial swimming and they are considered a basic [[motility|motile]] phenomena in [[bacteria]]. The most frequently investigated chemorepellents are [[inorganic]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, [[amino acids]] and some [[chemokine]]s.

== Bacterial chemotaxis ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Random walk]] --&gt;
Some [[bacteria]], such as ''[[E. coli]]'', have several [[flagellum|flagella]] per cell (4–10 typically). These can rotate in two ways :
# Counter-clockwise rotation aligns the flagella into a single rotating bundle, causing the bacterium to swim in a straight line.
# Clockwise rotation breaks the flagella bundle apart such that each flagellum points in a different direction, causing the bacterium to tumble in place.
The directions of rotation are given for an observer outside the cell looking down the flagella toward the cell.
[[Image:ChtxCCW CW.png|right|350 px|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;border:none&quot;&gt;Correlation of swimming behaviour and flagellar rotation&lt;/div&gt;]]

===Behavior===
The overall movement of a bacterium is the result of alternating tumble and swim phases. If one watches a bacterium swimming in a uniform environment, its movement will look like a [[random walk]] with relatively straight swims interrupted by random tumbles that reorient the bacterium. Bacteria such as ''[[E. coli]]'' are unable to choose the direction in which they swim, and are unable to swim in a straight line for more than a few seconds due to rotational [[diffusion]]. In other words, bacteria &quot;forget&quot; the direction in which they are going. By repeatedly evaluating their course, and adjusting if they are moving in the wrong direction, bacteria can direct their motion to find favorable locations with high concentrations of attractants (usually food) and avoid repellents (usually poisons).

In the presence of a chemical [[gradient]] bacteria will chemotax, or direct their overall motion based on the gradient. If the bacterium senses that it is moving in the correct direction (toward attractant/away from repellent), it will keep swimming in a straight line for a longer time before tumbling. If it is moving in the wrong direction, it will tumble sooner and try a new direction at random. In other words, bacteria like ''[[E. coli]]'' use temporal sensing to decide whether life is getting better or worse. In this way, it finds the location with the highest concentration of attractant (usually the source) quite well. Even under very high concentrations, it can still distinguish very small differences in concentration. Fleeing from a repellent works with the same efficiency.

This purposeful [[biased random walk (biochemistry)|random walk]] is a result of simply choosing between two methods of random movement; namely tumbling and straight swimming. In fact, chemotactic responses such as ''forgetting'' direction and ''choosing'' movements resemble the decision-making abilities of higher life-forms with brains that process sensory data.

The helical nature of the individual flagellar filament is critical for this movement to occur. As such, the protein that makes up the flagellar filament, [[flagellin]], is quite similar among all flagellated bacteria. Vertebrates seem to have taken advantage of this fact by possessing an immune receptor ([[TLR]]5) designed to recognize this conserved protein.

As in many instances in biology, there are bacteria that do not follow this rule. Many bacteria, such as ''Vibrio'', are monoflagellated and have a single flagellum at one pole of the cell. Their method of chemotaxis is different. Others possess a single flagellum that is kept inside the cell wall. These bacteria move by spinning the whole cell, which is shaped like a corkscrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Howard C. Berg | title=E. coli ''in motion''| journal=Springer-Verlag, NY. | year=2003 | volume=ISBN 0-387-00888-8 | isbn=0387008888 | publisher=Springer | location=New York
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signal transduction===
Chemical gradients are sensed through multiple [[transmembrane receptor]]s, called methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), which vary in the molecules that they detect. These receptors may bind attractants or repellents directly or indirectly through interaction with proteins of [[periplasmatic space]]. The signals from these receptors are transmitted across the [[plasma membrane]] into the [[cytosol]], where ''[[Che proteins]]'' are activated. The Che proteins alter the tumbling frequency, and alter the receptors.
[[Image:ChtxAspRec.png|right|350 px|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;border:none&quot;&gt;Domain structure of chemotaxis receptor for Asp&lt;/div&gt;]]

====Flagellum regulation====
The proteins CheW and CheA bind to the receptor. The activation of the receptor by an external stimulus causes [[phosphorylation|autophosphorylation]] in the histidine kinase, CheA, at a single highly conserved histidine residue. CheA in turn transfers phosphoryl groups to conserved aspartate residues in the response regulators CheB and CheY [ note: CheA is a histidine kinase and it does not actively transfer the phosphoryl group. The response regulator CheB takes the phosphoryl group from CheA]. This mechanism of signal transduction is called a [[two-component regulatory system|two-component system]] and is a common form of signal transduction in bacteria. CheY induces tumbling by interacting with the flagellar switch protein FliM, inducing a change from counter-clockwise to clockwise rotation of the flagellum. Change in the rotation state of a single flagellum can disrupt the entire flagella bundle and cause a tumble.

====Receptor regulation====
CheB, when activated by CheA, acts as a [[demethylase|methylesterase]], removing methyl groups from [[glutamate]] residues on the [[cytosol]]ic side of the receptor. It works antagonistically with CheR, a methyl[[transferase]], which adds methyl residues to the same glutamate residues. If the level of an attractant remains high, the level of phosphorylation of CheA (and therefore CheY and CheB) will remain low, the cell will swim smoothly, and the level of methylation of the MCPs will increase (because CheB-P is not present to demethylate). However, the MCPs no longer respond to the attractant when they are fully methylated. Therefore, even though the level of attractant might remain high, the level of CheA-P (and CheB-P) increases and the cell begins to tumble. However, now the MCPs can be demethylated by CheB-P, and when this happens, the receptors can once again respond to attractants. The situation is the opposite with regard to repellants (fully methylated MCPs respond best to repellants, while least methylated MCPs respond worst to repellents). This regulation allows the bacterium to 'remember' chemical concentrations from the recent past, a few seconds, and compare them to those it is currently experiencing, thus 'know' whether it is traveling up or down a gradient. Although the methylation system accounts for the wide range of sensitivity &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Bernardo A. Mello and Yuhai Tu | title=Effects of Adaptation in Maintaining High Sensitivity over a Wide Range of Backgrounds for Escherichia coli Chemotaxis | journal=Biophysical Journal | year=2007 | volume=92 | pages=2329–2337|pmid= 17208965 | pmc=1864821| doi=10.1529/biophysj.106.097808 | issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that bacteria have to chemical gradients, other mechanisms are involved in increasing the absolute value of the sensitivity on a given background.

==Eukaryotic chemotaxis==
The mechanism by which [[eukaryotic]] cells chemotax is quite different from that in bacteria; however, sensing of chemical gradients is still a crucial step in the process. Due to their size, prokaryotes cannot detect effective concentration gradients, therefore these cells scan and evaluate their environment by a constant swimming (consecutive steps of straight swims and tumbles). In contrast to prokaryotes, the size of eukaryotic cells allows for the possibility of detecting gradients, which results in a dynamic and polarized distribution of receptors. Induction of these receptors by chemoattractants or chemorepellents results in migration towards or away from the chemotactic substance.

[[Image:Chtxbaceukkl1.png|right|350 px|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;border:none&quot;&gt;Difference of gradient sensing in prokaryotes and eukaryotes&lt;/div&gt;]]

Levels of receptors, intracellular signalling pathways and the effector mechanisms all represent diverse, eukaryotic type components. In eukaryotic unicellular cells, ameboid movement and cilium or the eukaryotic flagellum are the main effectors (e.g. [[Amoeba]] or [[Tetrahymena]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Anna Bagorda, Carole A. Parent| title=Eukaryotic chemotaxis at a glance| journal=J. Cell Science | year=2008 | volume=121 | pages=2621–4 | doi=10.1242/jcs.018077 | pmid=18685153 | issue=Pt 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Laszlo Kohidai| title=Chemotaxis: the proper physiological response to evaluate phylogeny of signal molecules| journal=Acta Biol Hung| year=1999 | volume=50 | pages=375–94 |pmid=10735174 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some eukaryotic cells of higher vertebrate origin, such as [[immune system|immune cells]] also move to where they need to be. Besides immune competent cells ([[granulocyte]], [[monocyte]], [[lymphocyte]]) a large group of cells - considered previously to be fixed into tissues - are also motile in special physiological (e.g. [[mast cell]], [[fibroblast]], [[endothelial cells]])or pathological conditions (e.g. [[metastases]]). Chemotaxis has high significance in the early phases of [[embryogenesis]] as development of [[germ layers]] is guided by gradients of signal molecules.

===Motility===
Unlike motility in bacterial chemotaxis, the mechanism by which eukaryotic cells physically move is unclear. There appear to be mechanisms by which an external chemotactic gradient is sensed and turned into an intracellular [[PIP3]] gradient, which results in a gradient and the activation of a signaling pathway, culminating in the [[polymerisation]] of [[actin]] filaments. The growing distal end of actin filaments develops connections with the internal surface of the plasma membrane via different sets of peptides and results in the formation of [[pseudopods]].
[[Cilium|Cilia]] of eukaryotic cells can also produce chemotaxis; in this case it is mainly a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dependent induction of the [[microtubule|microtubular]] system of the [[basal body]] and the beat of the 9+2 microtubules within cilia. The orchestrated beating of hundreds of cilia is synchronized by a submembranous system built between basal bodies.
The details of the signaling pathways are still not totally clear.

====Chemotaxis related migratory responses====
Although chemotaxis is the most frequently studied form of migration there are several other forms of locomotion in the cellular level.
* ''[[Chemokinesis]]'' is also induced by molecules of the liquid phase of the surrounding environment; however, the response elicited is a not vectorial, random taxis. Neither amplitude nor frequency of motion has characteristic, directional components as this behaviour provides more scanning of the environment than migration between two distinct points.
* In ''[[haptotaxis]]'' the [[gradient]] of the chemoattractant is expressed or bound on a surface, in contrast to the classical model of chemotaxis, in which the gradient develops in a soluble fluid. The most common biologically active haptotactic surface is the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM); the presence of bound [[ligands]] is responsible for induction of transendothelial migration and [[angiogenesis]].
* ''Necrotaxis'' embodies a special type of chemotaxis when the chemoattractant molecules are released from [[necrosis|necrotic]] or [[apoptosis|apoptotic]] cells. Depending on the chemical character of released substances, necrotaxis can accumulate or repel cells, which underlines the pathophysiological significance of this phenomenon.
[[Image:Chtxphenomen1.png|center|400 px|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;border:none&quot;&gt;Chemotaxis related migratory responses&lt;/div&gt;]]

===Receptors===
For the most part, eukaryotic cells sense the presence of chemotactic stimuli through the use of 7-transmembrane (or serpentine) heterotrimeric [[G protein|G-protein]] coupled receptors. This class of receptors is huge, representing a significant portion of the [[genome]]. Some members of this gene superfamily are used in eyesight (rhodopsins) as well as in olfaction (smelling).
The main classes of professional chemotaxis receptors are triggered by formyl peptides - [[formyl peptide receptor]]s (FPR), [[chemokines]] - [[chemokine receptor]]s (CCR or CXCR) and [[leukotrienes]] - [[leukotriene receptor]]s (BLT); however, induction of a wide set of membrane receptors (e.g. [[amino acids]], [[insulin]], vasoactive peptides) also elicit migration of the cell.

====Chemotactic selection====
While some chemotaxis receptors are expressed in the surface membrane with long-term characteristics as they are determined genetically, others have short-term dynamics as they are assembled ''ad hoc'' in the presence of the ligand. The diverse features of the chemotaxis receptors and ligands allows for the possibility of selecting chemotactic responder cells with a simple chemotaxis assay. By [[chemotactic selection]] we can determine whether a still uncharacterized molecule acts via the long- or the short-term receptor pathway.
The term ''chemotactic selection'' is also used to designate a technique which separates eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells according to their chemotactic responsiveness to selector ligands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Laszlo Kohidai and Gyorgy Csaba | title=Chemotaxis and chemotactic selection induced with cytokines (IL-8, RANTES and TNF alpha) in the unicellular Tetrahymena pyriformis. | journal=Cytokine | year=1988 | volume=10 | pages=481–6|pmid=9702410 | doi=10.1006/cyto.1997.0328 | issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:chtxsel.png|center|300 px|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;border:none&quot;&gt;Chemotactic selection&lt;/div&gt;]]

===Chemotactic ligands===
The number of molecules capable of eliciting chemotactic responses is relatively high, and we can distinguish primary and secondary chemotactic molecules. The main groups of the primary ligands are as follows:
* ''Formyl peptides'' are di-, tri-, tetrapeptides of bacterial origin (see formyl group on the N terminus of the peptide). They are released from bacteria in vivo or after decomposition of the cell. A typical member of this group is the N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF or fMLP in references). The bacterial origin fMLF as a key component of inflammation has characteristic chemoattractant effects in neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes.
* ''Complement 3a ([[C3 (complement)|C3a]]) and complement 5a ([[C5a]])'' are intermediate products of complement cascade. Their synthesis is joined to the three alternative pathways (classical, lectin dependent and alternative) of complement activation by a convertase enzyme. The main target cells of these derivaties are neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes as well.
* ''[[Chemokines]]'' belong to a special class of [[cytokines]]. Their groups (C, CC, CXC, CX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C chemokines) represent not only structurally related molecules with a special arrangement of disulfide bridges, but their target cell specificity is also diverse: CC chemokines act on monocytes (e.g. [[RANTES]]), CXC chemokines are neutrophil granulocyte specific (e.g. [[IL-8]]).
[[Image:chtxChemokineStruct.png|center|400 px|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;border:none&quot;&gt;Structure of chemokine classes&lt;/div&gt;]]
Investigations of the three-dimensional structures of chemokines proved that a characteristic composition of beta-sheets and an alpha helix provides expression of sequences required for interaction with the chemokine receptors. Formation of dimers and their increased biological acitvity was demonstrated by crystallography of several chemokines e.g. IL-8.
[[Image:chtxChemkinStr2.png|center|350 px|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;border:none&quot;&gt;Three dimensional structure of chemokines&lt;/div&gt;]]
* ''[[Leukotrienes]]'' belong to the group [[eicosanoids]]. They are significant lipid mediators of the arachidonic acid cascade converted by 5-lipoxigenase. Their predominant member is leukotriene B4 (LTB4) which elicits adhesion, chemotaxis and aggregation of leukocytes. The characteristic chemoattractant effect of LTB4 is induced via G-protein linked seven-transmembrane spanning leukotriene receptors which are highly expressed in [[inflammation]] and [[allergy]].

====Chemotactic range fitting (CRF)====
Chemotactic responses elicited by the ligand-receptor interactions are distinguished generally upon the optimal effective concentration(s) of the ligand. Nevertheless, correlation of the amplitude elicited and ratio of the responder cells compared to the total number are also characteristic features of the chemotactic signaling. Investigations of ligand families (e.g. amino acids or oligo peptides) proved that there is a fitting of ranges (amplitudes; number of responder cells) and chemotactic activities: chemoattractant moiety is accompanied by wide ranges, while chemorepellent character by narrow ranges.
[[Image:chtxCRF2.png|center|350 px|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;border:none&quot;&gt;Chemotactic range fitting&lt;/div&gt;]]

==Clinical significance==
A changed migratory potential of cells has relatively high importance in the development of several clinical symptoms and syndromes.
Altered chemotactic activity of extracellular (e.g. ''[[Escherichia coli]]'') or intracellular (e.g. ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'') pathogens itself represents a significant clinical target. Modification of endogenous chemotactic ability of these microorganisms by pharmaceutical agents can decrease or inhibit the ratio of infections or spreading of infectious diseases.
Apart from infections, there are some other diseases where impaired chemotaxis is the primary etiological factor, as in [[Chediak-Higashi syndrome]] where giant intracellular vesicles inhibit normal migration of cells.

==Mathematical models==
Several mathematical models of chemotaxis were developed depending on the type of
* migration (e.g. basic differences of bacterial swimming, movement of unicellular eukaryotes with [[cilia]]/[[flagellum]] and [[ameboid]] migration);
* physico-chemical characteristics of the chemicals (e.g. [[diffusion]]) working as ligands;
* biological characteristics of the ligands (attractant, neutral and repellent molecules;
* assay systems applied to evaluate chemotaxis (see incubation times, development and stability of concentration gradients);
* other environmental effects possessing direct or indirect influence on the migration (lighting, temperature, magnetic fields etc.)

Although interactions of the factors listed above make the behavior of the solutions of mathematical models of chemotaxis rather complex, it is possible to describe the basic phenomenon of chemotaxis-driven motion in a straightforward way.
Indeed, let us denote with &lt;math&gt; \varphi&lt;/math&gt; the spatially non-uniform concentration of the chemo-attractant and with &lt;math&gt;\nabla \varphi&lt;/math&gt; its gradient. Then the chemotactic cellular flow (also called current) &lt;math&gt; J &lt;/math&gt; that is generated by the chemotaxis is linked to the above gradient by the law: &lt;math&gt; J = \chi C \nabla\varphi &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; is the spatial density of the cells and &lt;math&gt; \chi &lt;/math&gt; is the so-called ’Chemotactic coefficient’. However, note that in many cases &lt;math&gt; \chi &lt;/math&gt; is not constant: it is, instead, a decreasing function of the concentration of the chemo-attractant &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt; \chi(\varphi) &lt;/math&gt;.

==In the mirror of publications==
Research of cell migration–as it was shown in the chapter ’History of chemotaxis research’–requires complementary application of classic and modern techniques. The field provides the possibility to present novel and valuable data in the basic research as well as in applied sciences. In the last 20–25 years, due to the factors mentioned above, there was an increase in number of [[publication]]s dealing with itself the phenomenon chemotaxis. Nevertheless, other publications written in [[genetics]], [[biochemistry]], cell-physiology, [[pathology]] and clinical sciences could also incorporate data about migration or especially the chemotaxis of cells. A curiosity of migration research is that among several works investigating taxes (e.g.[[thermotaxis]], [[geotaxis]], [[phototaxis]]) chemotaxis research shows a significantly high ratio, which point to the underlined importance of chemotaxis research both in [[biology]] and [[medicine]].
[[Image:Chtx-Publ-en.png|center|450 px|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;border:none&quot;&gt;Chemotactic range fitting&lt;/div&gt;]]

==Measurement of chemotaxis==
{{main|Chemotaxis assay}}
A wide range of techniques is available to evaluate chemotactic activity of cells or the chemoattractant and chemorepellent character of ligands.
The basic requirements of the measurement are as follows:
* concentration gradients can develop relatively fast and persist for a long time in the system
* chemotactic and chemokinetic activities are distinguished
* migration of cells is free towards and away on the axis of the concentration gradient
* detected responses are the results of active migration of cells

Despite the fact that an ideal [[chemotaxis assay]] is still not available, there are several protocols and pieces of equipment which offer good correspondence with the conditions described above. The most commonly used are summarised in the table below:

Cheshire's area is {{convert|2343|km2|sqmi|0}} and its population is just over a million.  Apart from the large towns along the [[River Mersey]] and the historic city of Chester, it is mostly rural, with a number of small towns and villages that support an agricultural industry.

==History==
{{Main|History of Cheshire|Timeline of Cheshire history}}

===Toponymy===
Cheshire's name was originally derived from an early name for Chester, and was first recorded as ''Legeceasterscir'' in the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicles]],&lt;ref name=vch-vol1-p237&gt;Harris, B. E. and Thacker, A. T. (1987). p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning ''the shire of the city of legions''.&lt;ref name=crosby-p31&gt;Crosby, A. (1996). page 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the name first appears in 980, it is thought that the county was created by [[Edward the Elder]] around 920.&lt;ref name=crosby-p31/&gt; In the [[Domesday Book]], Chester was recorded as having the name ''Cestrescir'' (Chestershire), derived from the name for Chester at the time.&lt;ref name=vch-vol1-p237/&gt; A series of changes that occurred as English itself changed, together with some simplifications and [[elision]], resulted in the name Cheshire, as it occurs today.

Because of the historically close links with the land bordering Cheshire to the west, which became [[Wales]], there is a history of interaction between Cheshire and Wales. The Domesday Book records Cheshire as having two complete [[Hundreds of Cheshire|Hundreds]] (Atiscross and Exestan) that later became entirely part of Wales. Additionally, another large portion of the Duddestan Hundred later became known as [[Maelor Saesneg]] when it was transferred to Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, B.E. and Thacker, A.T. (1987). pp. 340–341.&lt;/ref&gt; For this and other reasons, the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name for Cheshire (''Swydd Gaerlleon'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geiriadur.net/atebion.php?PHPSESSID=6629e0a737dd330fd4fecaf52d21efd7&amp;uni=y&amp;prefLang=en&amp;term=Swydd+Gaerlleon&amp;direction=we&amp;whichpart=exact&amp;type=noun Welsh dictionary entry for Cheshire.] www.geriadur.net website (''Welsh-English / English-Welsh On-line Dictionary''  ). Department of Welsh, University of Wales, Lampeter. Retrieval Date: 21 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; is sometimes used within Wales and by Welsh speakers.

===Administrative history===

After the Norman conquest of 1066 by William I, dissent and resistance continued for many years after the invasion. In Cheshire in 1069 local resistance was finally overcome, and draconian measures were taken to impress the native Saxons with the futility of future resistance. Earl Edwin of Mercia along with other major landowners were made examples of, their properties confiscated and redistributed amongst Norman barons. King William created one of his barons, Hugh d'Avranches (nicknamed Hugh Lupus, or 'wolf') as Earl of Chester, ruling virtually autonomously in William's name and with his full authority, and Cheshire was thereby declared a County Palatine.

Cheshire in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' (1086) was recorded as a larger county than it is today. It included two  [[hundred (division)|hundred]]s, [[Atiscross]] and [[Exestan]], that later became part of [[Wales]]. At the time of the ''Domesday Book'', it also included as part of Duddestan Hundred the area of land later known as [[Maelor Saesneg]] (which used to be a detached part of [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]]) in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davies | first = R. | title = The Age of Conquest: Wales 1063–1415 | year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area between the [[Mersey]] and [[River Ribble|Ribble]] (referred to in the Domesday Book as &quot;Inter Ripam et Mersam&quot;) formed part of the returns for Cheshire.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan (1978). pp.269c–301c,d.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sylvesterp14&gt;Sylvester (1980). p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this has been interpreted to mean that at that time south Lancashire was part of Cheshire,&lt;ref name=sylvesterp14/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roffe (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; more exhaustive research indicates that the boundary between Cheshire and what was to become Lancashire remained the [[River Mersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Thacker (1987) write on page 252: {{quotation|Certainly there were links between Cheshire and south Lancashire before 1000, when [[Wulfric Spot]] held lands in both territories. Wulfric's estates remained grouped together after his death, when they were left to his brother Aelfhelm, and indeed there still seems to have been some kind of connexion in 1086, when south Lancashire was surveyed together with Cheshire by the Domesday commissioners. Nevertheless, the two territories do seem to have been distinguished from one another in some way and it is not certain that the shire-moot and the reeves referred to in the south Lancashire section of Domesday were the Cheshire ones.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips and Phillips (2002); pp. 26–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, A. (1996) writes on page 31: {{quotation|The Domesday Survey (1086) included south Lancashire with Cheshire for convenience, but the Mersey, the name of which means 'boundary river' is known to have divided the kingdoms of Northumbria and Mercia and there is no doubt that this was the real boundary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With minor variations in spelling across sources, the complete list of [[hundreds of Cheshire]] at this time are: Atiscross, Bochelau, Chester, Dudestan, Exestan, Hamestan, Middlewich, Riseton, Roelau, Tunendune, Warmundestrou and Wilaveston.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, B. E., and Thacker, A. T. (1987); pages 340–341.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1182 the land north of the Mersey became administered as part of the new county of [[Lancashire]], thus resolving any uncertainty about the county in which the land &quot;Inter Ripam et Mersam&quot; was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = George | first = D. | title = Lancashire | year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the years, the ten hundreds consolidated and changed names to leave just seven—Broxton, Bucklow, Eddisbury, Macclesfield, Nantwich, Northwich and Wirral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cheshire ancient divisions |work=Vision of Britain website |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10193850 |accessdate=2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1397 the county had lands in the march of Wales added to its territory, and was promoted to the rank of principality. This was because of the support the men of the county had given to King Richard II, in particular by his standing armed force of about 500 men called the &quot;Cheshire Guard&quot;. As a result the King's title was changed to &quot;King of England and France, Lord of Ireland, and Prince of Chester&quot;. No other English county has been honoured in this way, although it lost the distinction on Richard's fall in 1399.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, R. R. 'Richard II and the Principality of Chester' in ''The Reign of Richard II: Essays in Honour of May McKisack'', ed. F. R. H. Du Boulay and Caroline Baron (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the Local Government Act 1972, which came into effect on 1 April 1974, some areas in the north-west became part of the metropolitan counties of [[Greater Manchester]] and [[Merseyside]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jones | first= B. et al. | title=Politics UK | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Stockport]] (previously a county borough), [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]], [[Dukinfield]] and [[Stalybridge]] in the north-east became part of Greater Manchester. Much of the [[Wirral Peninsula]] in the north-west, including the county boroughs of Birkenhead and Wallasey, joined Merseyside. At the same time the [[Tintwistle Rural District]] was transferred to [[Derbyshire]]. The area of Lancashire south of the Merseyside/Greater Manchester area, including [[Widnes]] and the county borough of [[Warrington]], was added to the new non-metropolitan county of Cheshire.&lt;ref name = &quot;fipqxl&quot;&gt;Local Government Act 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Halton (borough)|Halton]] and [[Warrington]] became unitary authorities independent of Cheshire County Council on 1 April 1998, but remain part of Cheshire for ceremonial purposes and also for fire and policing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The Cheshire (Boroughs of Halton and Warrington) (Structural Change) Order 1996 | work = Office of Public Sector Information | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1996/Uksi_19961863_en_1.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A referendum for a further local government reform connected with an elected [[regional assemblies in England|regional assembly]] was planned for 2004, but was abandoned – see [[Northern England referendum, 2004]].

As part of the [[2009 structural changes to local government in England|local government restructuring]] in April 2009, [[Cheshire County Council]] and the Cheshire districts were abolished and replaced by two new unitary authorities, [[Cheshire East]] and [[Cheshire West and Chester]]. The existing unitary authorities of [[Halton (borough)|Halton]] and [[Warrington]] were not affected by the change.

As part of a 2002 marketing campaign, the plant conservation charity [[Plantlife]] chose the [[Cardamine pratensis|cuckooflower]] as the [[county flower]].

===Buildings and structures===
[[File:46 &amp; 48 High Street, Nantwich.JPG|thumb|left|Black-and-white timbered buildings on Nantwich High Street]]

Examples include [[Maiden Castle, Cheshire|Maiden Castle]] on [[Bickerton Hill]], [[Helsby]] Hillfort and Woodhouse Hillfort at [[Frodsham]]. The Roman fortress and walls of [[Chester]], perhaps the earliest building works in Cheshire remaining above ground, are constructed from purple-grey sandstone.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOE&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/ |title=Images of England |publisher=Images of England |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinctive local red sandstone has been used for many monumental and ecclesiastical buildings throughout the county: for example, the medieval [[Beeston Castle]], [[Chester Cathedral]] and numerous parish churches. Occasional residential and industrial buildings, such as [http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&amp;id=436671 Helsby Station], [[Helsby]] (1849), are also in this sandstone.

Many surviving buildings from the 15th to 17th centuries are timbered, particularly in the southern part of the county. Notable examples include the moated manor house [[Little Moreton Hall]], dating from around 1450, and many commercial and residential buildings in Chester, [[Nantwich]] and surrounding villages.

Early brick buildings include [[Peover Hall]] near [[Macclesfield]] (1585), [http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&amp;id=405179 Tattenhall Hall] (pre-1622) and [http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&amp;id=470351 Pied Bull Hotel] in Chester (17th century). From the 18th century, orange, red or brown brick became the predominant building material used in Cheshire, although earlier buildings are often faced or dressed with stone. Examples from the Victorian period onwards often employ distinctive brick detailing, such as brick patterning and ornate chimney stacks and gables. Notable examples include [[Arley Hall]] near [[Northwich]], [[Willington Hall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&amp;id=55781 |title=Detailed Record |publisher=Imagesofengland.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; near Chester (both by Nantwich architect [[George Latham (architect)|George Latham]]) and [http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&amp;id=469751 Overleigh Lodge], Chester. From the Victorian era, brick buildings often incorporate timberwork in a mock Tudor style, and this hybrid style has been used in some modern residential developments in the county. Industrial buildings, such as the Macclesfield silk mills (for example,  [http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&amp;id=390900 Waters Green New Mill]), are also usually in brick.

{{Main|Geology of Cheshire}}

Cheshire covers a boulder clay plain separating the hills of [[North Wales]] and the [[Peak District]] of [[Derbyshire]] (the area is also known as the [[Cheshire Plain|Cheshire Gap]]). This was formed following the retreat of [[ice age]] glaciers which left the area dotted with [[kettle hole]]s, locally referred to as meres. The bedrock of this region is almost entirely [[Triassic]] [[sandstone]], outcrops of which have long been quarried, notably at [[Runcorn]], providing the distinctive red stone for [[Liverpool Cathedral]] and [[Chester Cathedral]].

The eastern half of the county is Upper Triassic Mercia Mudstone laid down with large [[table salt|salt]] deposits which were mined for hundreds of years around [[Northwich]]. Separating this area from Lower Triassic Sherwood Sandstone to the west is a prominent sandstone ridge known as the [[Mid Cheshire Ridge]]. A {{convert|55|km|mi|0|sing=on}} footpath,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/countryside/Walking/ ]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sandstone Trail]], follows this ridge from [[Frodsham]] to [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]] passing [[Delamere Forest]], [[Beeston Castle]] and earlier [[Iron Age]] forts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandstonetrail.co.uk/ |title=Walking Cheshire's Sandstone Trail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
===Population===

Based on the Census of 2001, the overall population of Cheshire is 673,781, of which 51.3% of the population were male and 48.7% were female. Of those aged between 0–14 years, 51.5% were male and 48.4% were female; and of those aged over 75 years, 62.9% were female and 37.1% were male.

The population density of Cheshire is 32 people per km², lower than the North West average of 42 people/km² and the England and Wales average of 38 people/km². Ellesmere Port and Neston has a greater urban density than the rest of the county with 92 people/km².&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Census 2001 – Population | work = Cheshire Census Consortium | url = http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/2BA86039-3905-4E03-B2CC-1A56FF239192/0/Population.pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070605061912/http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/2BA86039-3905-4E03-B2CC-1A56FF239192/0/Population.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheshire is a ceremonial county.  This means that although there is no county-wide elected local authority, Cheshire has a [[Lord Lieutenant]] and [[High Sheriff of Cheshire|High Sheriff]] for ceremonial purposes under the [[Lieutenancies Act 1997]].

Local government functions apart from the Police and Fire/Rescue services are carried out by four smaller unitary authorities: [[Cheshire East]], [[Cheshire West and Chester]], [[Halton (borough)|Halton]], and [[Warrington]].

Policing and fire and rescue services are still provided across the County as a whole, but by unelected bodies.  The [[Cheshire Constabulary|Cheshire Police Authority]] and [[Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service|Cheshire Fire Authority]] consist of members of the four councils.

===Transition from the previous (1974) arrangement===

From 1 April 1974 the area under the control of the county council was divided into eight local government districts; [[Chester (district)|Chester]], [[Congleton (borough)|Congleton]], [[Crewe and Nantwich]], [[Ellesmere Port and Neston]], [[Halton (borough)|Halton]], [[Macclesfield (borough)|Macclesfield]], [[Vale Royal]] and [[Warrington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10032957 Vision of Britain] – Divisions of Cheshire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/Council/districtcouncils.htm Cheshire County Council] – Map of Cheshire districts&lt;/ref&gt; [[Halton (borough)|Halton]] (which includes the towns of [[Runcorn]] and [[Widnes]]) and [[Warrington]] became [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire | work =Cheshire County Council | url = http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/aboutcheshire/lord.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070203042519/http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/aboutcheshire/lord.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining districts and the county were abolished as part of local government restructuring on 1 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/uksi_20080634_en_1 |title=Cheshire (Structural Changes) Order 2008 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Halton and Warrington boroughs were not affected by the 2009 restructuring.

On 25 July 2007, the Secretary of State [[Hazel Blears]] announced she was 'minded' to split Cheshire into two new unitary authorities, [[Cheshire West and Chester]], and [[Cheshire East]]. She confirmed she had not changed her mind on 19 December 2007 and therefore the proposal to split two-tier Cheshire into two would proceed.

Cheshire County Council leader Paul Findlow, who attempted High Court legal action against the proposal, claimed that splitting Cheshire would only disrupt excellent services while increasing living costs for all. A widespread sentiment that this decision was taken by the [[European Union]] long ago has often been portrayed via angered letters from Cheshire residents to local papers. On 31 January 2008 ''The Standard'', Cheshire &amp; district newspaper, announced that the legal action had been dropped. Members against the proposal were advised that they may be unable to persuade the court that the decision of Hazel Blears was &quot;manifestly absurd&quot;.

The Cheshire West and Chester unitary authority covers the area formerly occupied by the City of Chester and the boroughs of Ellesmere Port and Neston and Vale Royal; Cheshire East now covers the area formerly occupied by the boroughs of Congleton, Crewe and Nantwich, and Macclesfield. The changes were implemented on 1 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/6916055.stm |title=BBC News, 25 July 2007 – County split into two authorities |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-07-25 |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Cheshire (Structural Changes) Order 2008 | work = Office of Public Sector Information | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/uksi_20080634_en_1 | accessdate = 2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Congleton|Congleton Borough Council]] pursued an appeal against the judicial review it lost in October 2007. The appeal was dismissed on 4&amp;nbsp;March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Unitary legal fight over in 60 seconds | work = LocalGov.co.uk | url = http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;ID=64451 | accessdate = 2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy and industry==
{{Main|Economy of Cheshire}}
Cheshire has a diverse economy with significant sectors including agriculture, automotive, bio-technology, chemical, financial services, food and drink, ICT, and tourism. The county is famous for the production of [[Cheshire cheese]], [[Salt in Cheshire|salt]] and silk.

[[File:Cheshire Cattle.JPG|thumb|Cattle farming in the county]]
A mainly rural county, Cheshire has a high concentration of villages. Agriculture is generally based on the dairy trade, and cattle are the predominant livestock. Land use given to agriculture has fluctuated somewhat, and in 2005 totalled 1558&amp;nbsp;km² over 4,609 holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Agricultural Holdings – Land and Employment – Cheshire – 2002 to 2005| work = Cheshire County Council | url = http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/8AC07978-47FE-4BA6-8063-39F5AFB0978D/0/EcE3.pdf | accessdate = 2007-06-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070605061926/http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/8AC07978-47FE-4BA6-8063-39F5AFB0978D/0/EcE3.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on holdings by EC farm type in 2005, 8.51&amp;nbsp;km² was allocated to dairy farming, with another 11.78&amp;nbsp;km² allocated to cattle and sheep.

The chemical industry in Cheshire was founded in [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times, with the [[Salt in Cheshire|mining of salt]] in Middlewich and Northwich. Salt is still mined in the area by [[British Salt]]. The salt mining has led to a continued chemical industry around Northwich, with [[Brunner Mond]] based in the town. Other chemical companies, including [[Ineos]] (formerly [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]]), have plants at [[Runcorn]]. The [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] [[Stanlow Refinery]] is at Ellesmere Port. The oil refinery has operated since 1924 and has a capacity of 12&amp;nbsp;million tonnes per year.

Crewe was once the centre of the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|British railway industry]], and remains a major railway junction. The [[Crewe Works|Crewe railway works]], built in 1840, employed 20,000 people at its peak, although the workforce is now less than 1,000. Crewe is also the home of [[Bentley]] cars. Also within Cheshire are manufacturing plants for [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] and [[Vauxhall Motors]] in Ellesmere Port. The county also has an aircraft industry, with the [[BAE Systems]] facility at [[Woodford Aerodrome]], part of BAE System's Military Air Solutions division. The facility designed and constructed [[Avro Lancaster]] and [[Avro Vulcan]] bombers and the [[Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod]]. On the Cheshire border with [[Flintshire]] is the [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] aircraft factory, more recently associated with [[Airbus]].

Tourism in Cheshire from within the UK and overseas continues to perform strongly. Over 8&amp;nbsp;million nights of accommodation (both UK and overseas) and over 2.8&amp;nbsp;million visits to Cheshire were recorded during 2003.&lt;ref name = &quot;ygcyzn&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Cheshire Economy (page 64)| work = Cheshire County Council | url = http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/5F4B2042-1BCB-4F74-B53B-6EE65E28372E/0/CheshireEconomy.pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070605061855/http://www.cheshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/5F4B2042-1BCB-4F74-B53B-6EE65E28372E/0/CheshireEconomy.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of 2003, there were 22,020 VAT-registered enterprises in Cheshire, an increase of 7% since 1998, many in the business services (31.9%) and wholesale/retail (21.7%) sectors. Between 2002 and 2003 the number of businesses grew in four sectors: public administration and other services (6.0%), hotels and restaurants (5.1%), construction (1.7%), and business services (1.0%).&lt;ref name = &quot;ygcyzn&quot;/&gt;  The county saw the largest proportional reduction between 2001 and 2002 in employment in the energy and Water sector and there was also a significant reduction in the manufacturing sector. The largest growth during this period was in the other services and distribution, hotels and retail sectors.&lt;ref name = &quot;ygcyzn&quot;/&gt;

Cheshire is considered to be an affluent county. Due to Cheshire's proximity to the cities of [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]], [[counter urbanisation]] is common. Cheshire West has a fairly large proportion of residents who work in Liverpool, while Cheshire East falls within Manchester's sphere of influence.

==Education==
''See also: [[List of schools in Cheshire East]]; [[List of schools in Cheshire West and Chester]]; [[List of schools in Halton]]; [[List of schools in Warrington]]

All four [[Local Education Authority|local education authorities]] in Cheshire operate only comprehensive state school systems. When [[Altrincham]] and [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]] were moved from Cheshire to [[Metropolitan Borough of Trafford|Trafford]] in 1974, they took some former Cheshire selective schools. Today, there are two universities based in the county, the [[University of Chester]] and the [[Crewe]] campus of [[Manchester Metropolitan University]].

==Culture, media and sport==
Cheshire has two league [[association football|football]] teams, namely League Two [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] and [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]]. [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] were also a League Two team until they were relegated to the [[Conference National]] in April 2009 and later dissolved. A [[Chester F.C.|new club]] was formed in 2010 and will play in the [[Northern Premier League Division One North]].

Cheshire also is represented in the highest level basketball league in the UK, the [[British Basketball League|BBL]], by the [[Cheshire Jets]], formerly Chester Jets.

[[Warrington Wolves]] are the premier [[Rugby League]] team in Cheshire and play in the [[Super League]]. [[Widnes Vikings]] are currently in [[National League One]]. There are also numerous junior clubs in the county, including Chester Gladiators.

[[Cheshire County Cricket Club]] is one of the [[Minor counties of English and Welsh cricket|minor county cricket clubs]].

The county has also been home to many notable sportsmen and athletes, including footballers [[Dean Ashton]], [[Djibril Cissé]], [[Peter Crouch]], [[Seth Johnson]], [[Michael Owen]] and [[Wayne Rooney]]. Other local athletes have included cricketer [[Ian Botham]], marathon runner [[Paula Radcliffe]], Great Britain Olympic oarsman [[Matthew Langridge]], [[Shirley Strong]], and mountaineer [[George Mallory]], who died in 1924 on [[Mount Everest]].

Each May, Europe's largest motorcycle event, the [[Thundersprint]], is held in [[Northwich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thundersprint.com/first_timers_guide.html | title=The Thundersprint |  accessdate=2011-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The county has produced several notable musicians, including popular artists [[John Mayall]] ([[John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnmayall.com/bio.html John Mayall biographical details.] www.johnmayall.com website. Retrieval Date: 21 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Astbury]] ([[The Cult]]), [[Tim Burgess]] ([[Charlatans UK|Charlatans]]) and [[Ian Curtis]] ([[Joy Division]]). Concert pianist [[Stephen Hough]], singer [[Thea Gilmore]] and her producer husband [[Nigel Stonier]] also reside in Cheshire. The county has also been home to several writers, including [[Hall Caine]] (1853–1931), popular romantic novelist and playwright; [[Alan Garner]]; Victorian novelist [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], whose novel ''[[Cranford (novel)|Cranford]]'' features her home town of [[Knutsford]]; and most famously [[Charles Lutwidge Dodgson|Lewis Carroll]], born and raised in [[Daresbury]], hence the [[Cheshire cat]]. Artists from the county include ceramic artist [[Emma Bossons]] and sculptor and photographer [[Andy Goldsworthy]]. Actors from Cheshire include [[Daniel Craig]], the 6th [[James Bond]]; [[Dame Wendy Hiller]]; and [[Lewis McGibbon]], best known for his role in ''[[Millions]]''.

Local radio stations in the county include [[Dee 106.3]], [[Heart Wrexham|Heart]] and [[Wrexham and Chester Gold|Gold]] for Chester and West Cheshire, [[Silk FM]] for the east of the county, [[Signal 1]] for the south, [[Wire FM]] for Warrington, [[Wish FM]], which covers Widnes, and community station [[Cheshire FM]], which covers central Cheshire. The BBC covers the west with [[BBC Radio Merseyside]], the north and east with [[BBC Radio Manchester]] and the south with [[BBC Radio Stoke]]. There were plans to launch BBC Radio Cheshire, but those were shelved in 2007 after a lower than expected BBC licence fee settlement.

===Settlements===
{{Main|List of places in Cheshire}}
The county is home to some of the most affluent areas of England, including [[Alderley Edge]], [[Wilmslow]], [[Prestbury, Cheshire|Prestbury]], [[Tarporley]] and [[Knutsford]], named in 2006 as the most expensive place to buy a house in the north of England. The former Cheshire town of [[Altrincham]] was in second place. The area is sometimes referred to as [[Golden Triangle (Cheshire)|The Golden Triangle]] on account of the area in and around the above mentioned towns and villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Why Cheshire fat cats smile| work = Times Online| url = http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/buying_and_selling/article1087249.ece | accessdate = 2006-03-06 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''county town''' is the 'capital' of a [[county]] in the [[United Kingdom]] or [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].  County towns are usually the location of administrative or judicial functions, or established over time as the ''de facto'' main town of a county.  The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration is based (see [[County town#County Halls|County halls]] below). In fact, many county towns are no longer part of &quot;their&quot; administrative county e.g. [[Nottingham]] is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of [[Nottinghamshire]]. Many county towns are in fact [[city status in the United Kingdom|cities]], but all are referred to as county towns irrespective of whether city status is held or not.

# Between 1536 and 1974, Monmouthshire was included by successive English and later, British, governments within England for some administrative and legal purposes.  Always regarded culturally and ecclesiastically as part of Wales, particularly by the Welsh, since 1974 when new local government legislation was introduced it has unequivocally been within that country. The county is named after Monmouth, but the Sheriff's county court was held alternately in Monmouth and Newport.

== County towns post the late 19th century reforms==
With the creation of elected [[county council]]s in 1889 the location of administrative headquarters in some cases moved away from the traditional county town. Furthermore, in 1965 and 1974 there were major administrative boundary changes in [[England and Wales]] and [[administrative county|administrative counties]] were replaced with new [[metropolitan county|metropolitan]] and [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan counties]].  The boundaries underwent more major alterations between 1995 and 1998 to create [[Unitary Authority|unitary authorities]] and some of the ancient counties and county towns were restored for administrative purposes.  (Note: not all headquarters are or were called County Halls or Shire Halls e.g.: Cumbria County Council's HQ is called ''The Courts'').  Before 1974 many of the county halls were located in towns and cities that had the status of a [[county borough]] i.e.: a borough outside of the county council's jurisdiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Constitutional history of Canada}}
The '''Constitution of Canada''' ('''La Constitution du Canada''' in [[French language|French]]) is the supreme law in [[Canada]]; the country's [[constitution]] is an amalgamation of codified [[Act of Parliament|act]]s and [[uncodified constitution|uncodified]] traditions and [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]s. It outlines Canada's [[system of government]], as well as the [[civil rights]] of all Canadian citizens and those in Canada.  Interpretation of the Constitution is called [[Canadian constitutional law]].

The composition of the Constitution of Canada is defined in subsection 52(2) of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]] as consisting of the [[Canada Act 1982]] (including the Constitution Act, 1982), all acts and orders referred to in the schedule (including the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], formerly the British North America Act), and any amendments to these documents.&lt;ref&gt;See [[list of Canadian constitutional documents]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] held that the list is not exhaustive and includes unwritten components as well.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly)|New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia]]'' [1993] 1 S.C.R. 319&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Constitution==
{{Main|Constitutional history of Canada}}
The first semblance of a Constitution for Canada was the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]]. The Act renamed the northeasterly portion of the former French Province of [[New France]].  The newly British “Province of Quebec” was roughly coextensive with the lower third of contemporary Quebec.  The Proclamation, which established an appointed colonial government, was the “de facto” constitution of Quebec until 1774, when the British Parliament passed the [[Quebec Act]], which expanded the province’s boundaries to the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi rivers]], which was one of the grievances listed in the United States [[Declaration of Independence]].  Significantly, the Quebec Act also replaced the French criminal law presumption of ‘guilty until proven innocent’ with the English criminal law presumption of ‘innocent until proven guilty’; but the French code or civil law system was retained for non-criminal matters.
[[Image:Fathers of Confederation LAC c001855.jpg|thumb|left|300px|right|A painting depicting negotiations that would lead to the enactment of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]]]]
The [[Treaty of Paris of 1783]] ended the [[American War for Independence]] and sent a wave of British loyalist refugees northward to Quebec and Nova Scotia.  In 1784, the two provinces were divided.  Nova Scotia,  Cape Breton Island (rejoined to Nova Scotia in 1820), Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick; while Quebec was split into Lower Canada (southerly Quebec) and Upper Canada (southerly through lower northern Ontario and all or parts of Michigan until 1796, 1818 and 1847).

The winter of 1837-38 saw rebellion in both of the Canadas, with the result they were rejoined as the Province of United Canada in 1841.  This was reversed by the [[British North America Act]] in 1867 which established the Dominion of Canada.

Initially, on 1 July 1867, there were four provinces in confederation as “One dominion under the name of Canada”:  [[Canada West]] (former [[Upper Canada]]; now, [[Ontario]]), [[Canada East]] (former [[Lower Canada]]; now, [[Quebec]]), [[Nova Scotia]], and [[New Brunswick]].  Title to the [[Northwest Territories]] was transferred by the [[Hudson’s Bay Company]] in 1868, and the Province of [[Manitoba]] was the first created out of it, and the first province created by Ottawa instead of London, in 1870.  [[British Columbia]] joined confederation in 1871, followed by Prince Edward Island in 1873.  [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] were created by Ottawa in 1905, followed by the [[Yukon Territory]] in 1912.  The [[Dominion of Newfoundland]], Britain’s oldest colony in the Americas, joined Canada as a [[Province of Newfoundland and Labrador|Province]] in 1949.  [[Nunavut Territory]] was created in 1999.

An [[Empire Conference]] in 1931 that included the leaders of all dominions, and representatives from India (which then included Burma, Bangladesh and Pakistan) produced the [[Statute of Westminster]].  The Statute, an essential transitory step from “[[British Empire]]” to “[[Commonwealth of Nations]]”, provided that all existing dominions became fully independent of the United Kingdom upon its ratification by the dominion legislatures (for Canada and Australia, the federal legislatures only); and all new dominions would be fully independent upon the grant of dominion status.  There were two exceptions – Newfoundland and Canada.

Newfoundland never ratified the Statute, so that it was still subject to imperial authority when its entire system of government and economy collapsed utterly in the mid-1930s.  Canada did ratify the Statute, but had requested an exception because the Canadian federal and provincial governments could not agree on an amending formula for the Canadian Constitution.  It would be another 50 years before this was achieved.  In the interim, the British Parliament periodically passed enabling acts with respect to amendments to Canada’s Constitution; this was never anything but a [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/prb0004-e.htm |title=INTERNATIONAL TREATIES: CANADIAN PRACTICE |first=Daniel |last=Dupras |date=3 |month=April |year=2000 |work=Depository Services Program |publisher=Public Works and Government Services Canada |accessdate=17 December 2010 |quote=&quot;In 1931, under the Statute of Westminster, Canada and a number of other British dominions, acquired full independence(4) and with it authority to act internationally with all the attributes of a sovereign state.  Full power over foreign affairs was thus conferred on Canada and section 132 of the Constitution Act, 1867 became obsolete.&quot; Footnote 4:&quot;Except with respect to amendments to Canada’s Constitution, which remained under the British Parliament’s jurisdiction until 1982.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The patriation of the Canadian Constitution was achieved in 1982 when the British and Canadian parliaments passed parallel acts – the '''[[Canada Act 1982|Canada Act, 1982]]''' ([UK] 1982, c.11) in London, and the '''[[Constitution Act 1982]]''' in Ottawa.  Thereafter, the United Kingdom was formally absolved of any remaining responsibility for, or jurisdiction over, Canada; and Canada became responsible for her own destiny.  In a formal ceremony on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, the Queen signed both acts into law on April 17, 1982.

The Canada Act/Constitution Act included the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].  Prior to the Charter, there were various statutes which protected an assortment of civil rights and obligations, but nothing was enshrined in the Constitution until 1982.  The Charter has thus placed a strong focus upon individual and collective rights of the people of Canada.

Enactment of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms has also fundamentally changed much of Canadian constitutional law.  Before the Charter, civil rights and liberties had no solid constitutional protection in Canada.  Whenever one level of government passed a law that seemed oppressive to civil rights and liberties, Canadian constitutional lawyers had to argue creatively, such as by saying that the oppressive law violates division of federal and provincial powers or by citing some other technical flaw that had little to do with the concept of civil rights and liberties.  Even the [[Magna Carta]], which does have constitutional status in Canada, was occasionally called into service in legal argument.  {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}{{Dubious|date=November 2010}}  Since 1982, however, the arguments have been easier to make, because lawyers have been able to cite the relevant sections of the constitution rather than rely upon legal abstraction.

The Act also codified many previously oral constitutional conventions, and has made amendment of the Constitution significantly more difficult.  Previously, the Canadian federal constitution could be amended by solitary act of the Canadian or British parliaments, by formal or informal agreement between the federal and provincial governments, or even simply by adoption as ordinary custom of an oral convention or unwritten tradition that was perceived to be the best way to do something — or just the way things had always worked. For example, Canada has had a [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] since 1867, but there is no mention of the office in the Constitution until as late as 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloorstreet.com/200block/sconst82.htm#5  CONSTITUTION ACT, 1982, PART II, Section 35.1(a) and (b)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[PART IV.I, Section 37.1 (1), (2), (3) (Later Repealed)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/law/icl/ca02000_.html#S049_  PART V, Section 49]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there remains no legal definition as to what a Prime Minister specifically is. Since the Act, amendments must now conform to certain specified provisions in the written portion of the Canadian Constitution (see [[Amendments to the Constitution of Canada|amendment formula]]).

==Constitution Act, 1867==
{{Main|Constitution Act, 1867}}
This was an Act of the British Parliament, originally called the British North America Act 1867,
that created the Dominion of Canada out of three separate provinces in [[British North America]] ([[Province of Canada]], [[New Brunswick]], and [[Nova Scotia]]) and allowed for subsequent provinces and colonies to join this union in the future. It outlined Canada's system of government, which combines Britain's Westminster model of parliamentary government with division of sovereignty ([[Canadian federalism|federalism]]). Although it is the first of 20 ''[[British North America Acts]]'', it is still the most famous of these and is understood to be the document of Canadian Confederation (i.e. union of provinces and colonies in British North America). With the patriation of the Constitution in 1982, this Act was renamed ''Constitution Act, 1867''. In recent years, the 1867 document has mainly served as the basis on which the division of powers between the provinces and federal government have been analyzed.

==Constitution Act, 1982==
{{Main|Constitution Act, 1982}}
Endorsed by all provinces, except by the [[Quebec]] government led by [[René Lévesque]], this was the formal Canadian Act of Parliament that achieved full and final political independence from the [[United Kingdom]].  Part V of this Act established an amending formula for the Canadian Constitution, the lack of which (due to more than 50 years of disagreement between the federal and provincial governments) was the only reason Canada's constitutional amendments still required approval by the British Parliament after ratification of the [[Statute of Westminster]] in 1931.

More importantly, Part I of the Act is the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] which outlines the civil rights and liberties of every citizen in Canada, such as freedom of expression, of religion, and of mobility.  Part II addresses the rights of Canada's Aboriginal people.

In UK, the parallel act passed simultaneously by the British Parliament was called the [[Canada Act 1982]]&lt;!-- NOTE: Acts of the UK Parliament don't use a comma between &quot;Act&quot; and date --&gt;.  As a bilingual act of parliament, the Canada Act 1982 has the distinction of being the only legislation in French that has been passed by an English or British Parliament since Norman French ceased to be the language of government in England.

===Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms===
{{Main|Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms}}
As noted above, this is Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982. The Charter is the constitutional guarantee of collective and individual rights. It is a relatively short document and written in plain language in order to ensure accessibility to the average citizen. It is said that it is the part of the constitution that has the greatest impact on [[Canadians]]' day-to-day lives, and has been the fastest developing area of constitutional law for many years. Only applies to government and government actions with the intention to prevent government from creating laws that are unconstitutional.

===Amending formula===
{{Main|Amendments to the Constitution of Canada}}
With the Constitution Act, 1982, amendments to the constitution must be done in accordance with Part V of the Constitution Act, 1982 which provides for five different amending formulas. Amendments can be brought forward under section 46(1) by any province or either level of the federal government. The general formula is set out in section 38(1), known as the &quot;7/50 formula&quot;, requires: (a) assent from both the House of Commons and the Senate; (b) the approval of two-thirds of the provincial legislatures (at least seven provinces), representing at least 50% of the population (effectively, this would include at least Quebec or Ontario, as they are the most populous provinces). This formula specifically applies to amendments related to the proportionate representation in Parliament, powers, selection, and composition of the Senate, the Supreme Court and the addition of provinces or territories.
The other amendment formulas are for exceptional cases as provided by in the Act:
*In the case of an amendment related to the [[Monarchy in Canada|Office of the Queen]], the use of either official language (subject to section 43), the amending formula, or the composition of the Supreme Court, the amendment must be adopted by unanimous consent of all the provinces in accordance with section 41.
*However, in the case of an amendment related to provincial boundaries or the use of an official language within a province alone, the amendment must be passed by the legislatures affected by the amendment (section 43).
*In the case of an amendment that affects the federal government alone, the amendment does not need approval of the provinces (section 44). The same applies to amendments affecting the provincial government alone (section 45).

===Vandalism of the proclamation paper===
In 1983, Peter Greyson, an art student, entered Ottawa's National Archives (known today as [[Library and Archives Canada]]) and poured red paint over a copy of the proclamation of the 1982 constitutional amendment. He said he was displeased with the federal government's decision to allow U.S. missile testing in Canada, and had wanted to &quot;graphically illustrate to Canadians&quot; how wrong he believed the government to be. A grapefruit-sized stain remains on the original document; restoration specialists opted to leave most of the paint intact, fearing that removal attempts would merely cause further damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-73-331-1747-10/on_this_day/politics_economy/greyson_protest | work=CBC News | title=Missile Protestor defaces Constitution - &quot;On This Day&quot; - CBC Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of the Constitution==
{{See|List of Canadian constitutional documents}}

There are three general methods of constitutional entrenchment:

* 1. Specific mention as a constitutional document in section 52(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982, such as the Constitution Act, 1867.
* 2. Constitutional entrenchment of an otherwise statutory English, British, or Canadian document because of subject matter provisions in the amending formula of the Constitution Act, 1982, such as provisions with regard to the monarchy in the English [[Bill of Rights 1689]] or the [[Act of Settlement 1701]]. English and British statutes are part of Canadian law because of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, section 129 of the Constitution Act, 1867, and the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. Those laws then became entrenched when the amending formula was made part of the constitution.
* 3. Reference by an entrenched document, such as the Preamble of the Constitution Act, 1867's entrenchment of written and unwritten principles from the constitution of the United Kingdom or the [[Constitution Act, 1982]]'s reference of the [[Proclamation of 1763]].

===Unwritten sources===
The existence of an unwritten constitution was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in ''[[Reference re Secession of Quebec]]''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“''The Constitution is more than a written text. It embraces the entire global system of rules and principles which govern the exercise of constitutional authority. A superficial reading of selected provisions of the written constitutional enactment, without more, may be misleadin
