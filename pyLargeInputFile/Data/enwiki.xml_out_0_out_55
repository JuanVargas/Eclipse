The defining feature of a black hole is the appearance of an event horizon—a boundary in [[spacetime]] through which matter and light can only pass inward towards the mass of the black hole. Nothing, not even light, can escape from inside the event horizon. The event horizon is referred to as such because if an event occurs within the boundary, information from that event cannot reach an outside observer, making it impossible to determine if such an event occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|2007|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As predicted by general relativity, the presence of a large mass deforms spacetime in such a way that the paths taken by particles bend towards the mass.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} At the event horizon of a black hole, this deformation becomes so strong that there are no paths that lead away from the black hole.

To a distant observer, clocks near a black hole appear to tick more slowly than those further away from the black hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this effect, known as [[gravitational time dilation]], an object falling into a black hole appears to slow down as it approaches the event horizon, taking an infinite time to reach it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, all processes on this object slow down causing emitted light to appear redder and dimmer, an effect known as [[gravitational redshift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, at a point just before it reaches the event horizon, the falling object becomes so dim that it can no longer be seen.

On the other hand, an observer falling into a black hole does not notice any of these effects as he crosses the event horizon. According to his own clock, he crosses the event horizon after a finite time, although he is unable to determine exactly when he crosses it, as it is impossible to determine the location of the event horizon from local observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape of the event horizon of a black hole is always approximately spherical.{{#tag:ref|This is true only for 4-dimensional spacetimes. In higher dimensions more complicated horizon topologies like a [[black ring]] are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Singularity===
{{Main|Gravitational singularity}}
At the center of a black hole as described by general relativity lies a [[gravitational singularity]], a region where the spacetime curvature becomes infinite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a non-rotating black hole this region takes the shape of a single point and for a [[rotating black hole]] it is smeared out to form a [[ring singularity]] lying in the plane of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|pp=264–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases the singular region has zero volume. It can also be shown that the singular region contains all the mass of the black hole solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singular region can thus be thought of as having infinite [[mass density|density]].

An observer falling into a Schwarzschild black hole (i.e. non-rotating and no charges) cannot avoid being carried into the singularity, once they cross the event horizon. They can prolong the experience by accelerating away to slow their descent, but only up to a point; after attaining a certain ideal velocity, it is best to [[free fall]] the rest of the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In the case of a charged (Reissner–Nordström) or rotating (Kerr) black hole it is possible to avoid the singularity. Extending these solutions as far as possible reveals the hypothetical possibility of exiting the black hole into a different spacetime with the black hole acting as a [[wormhole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|pp=257–259 and 265–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of traveling to another universe is however only theoretical, since any perturbation will destroy this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The appearance of singularities in general relativity is commonly perceived as signaling the breakdown of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wald|1984|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; This breakdown, however, is expected; it occurs in a situation where [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effects should describe these actions due to the extremely high density and therefore particle interactions.

It is generally expected that a theory of [[quantum gravity]] will feature black holes without singularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Photon sphere===
{{Main|Photon sphere}}
The photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness such that [[photon]]s moving along [[tangent]]s to the sphere will be trapped in a circular orbit. For non-rotating black holes, the photon sphere has a radius 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius. The orbits are [[instability|dynamically unstable]], hence any small perturbation (such as a particle of infalling matter) will grow over time, either setting it on an outward trajectory escaping the black hole or on an inward spiral eventually crossing the event horizon.

While light can still escape from inside the photon sphere, any light that crosses the photon sphere on an inbound trajectory will be captured by the black hole. Hence any light reaching an outside observer from inside the photon sphere must have been emitted by objects inside the photon sphere but still outside of the event horizon.

Other [[compact object]]s, such as [[neutron stars]], can also have photon spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Ergosphere===
{{Main|Ergosphere}}
[[File:Ergosphere.svg|thumb|right|ergosphere of a rotating black hole|The ergosphere is an oblate spheroid region outside of the event horizon, where objects cannot remain stationary.]]
Rotating black holes are surrounded by a region of spacetime in which it is impossible to stand still, called the ergosphere. This is the result of a process known as [[frame-dragging]]; general relativity predicts that any rotating mass will tend to slightly &quot;drag&quot; along the spacetime immediately surrounding it. Any object near the rotating mass will tend to start moving in the direction of rotation. For a rotating black hole this effect becomes so strong near the event horizon that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light in the opposite direction to just stand still.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|loc=Ch. 6.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ergosphere of a black hole is bounded by the (outer) event horizon on the inside and an [[oblate spheroid]], which coincides with the event horizon at the poles and is noticeably wider around the equator. The outer boundary is sometimes called the ''ergosurface''.

Objects and radiation can escape normally from the ergosphere. Through the [[Penrose process]], objects can emerge from the ergosphere with more energy than they entered. This energy is taken from the rotational energy of the black hole causing it to slow down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|loc=Ch. 6.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation and evolution==
Considering the exotic nature of black holes, it may be natural to question if such bizarre objects could exist in nature or to suggest that they are merely pathological solutions to Einstein's equations. Einstein himself wrongly thought that black holes would not form, because he held that the angular momentum of collapsing particles would stabilize their motion at some radius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Once an event horizon forms, Penrose proved that a singularity will form somewhere inside it.&lt;ref name=penrose1965/&gt; Shortly afterwards, Hawking showed that many cosmological solutions describing the [[Big Bang]] have singularities without scalar fields or other exotic matter (see [[Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems]]). The [[Kerr solution]], the [[no-hair theorem]] and the laws of [[black hole thermodynamics]] showed that the physical properties of black holes were simple and comprehensible, making them respectable subjects for research.&lt;ref name=HawkingPenrose1970&gt;{{Cite journal

|bibcode = 1970RSPSA.314..529H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary formation process for black holes is expected to be the [[gravitational collapse]] of heavy objects such as stars, but there are also more exotic processes that can lead to the production of black holes.

===Gravitational collapse===
{{Main|Gravitational collapse}}
Gravitational collapse occurs when an object's internal [[pressure]] is insufficient to resist the object's own gravity. For stars this usually occurs either because a star has too little &quot;fuel&quot; left to maintain its temperature through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], or because a star that would have been stable receives extra matter in a way that does not raise its core temperature. In either case the star's temperature is no longer high enough to prevent it from collapsing under its own weight (the [[ideal gas law]] explains the connection between pressure, temperature, and volume).&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll5.8&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|loc=Section 5.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collapse may be stopped by the [[degeneracy pressure]] of the star's constituents, condensing the matter in an exotic [[Degenerate matter|denser state]]. The result is one of the various types of [[compact star]]. Which type of compact star is formed depends on the mass of the remnant—the matter left over after changes triggered by the collapse (such as [[supernova]] or pulsations leading to a [[planetary nebula]]) have blown away the outer layers. Note that this can be substantially less than the original star—remnants exceeding 5 solar masses are produced by stars that were over 20 solar masses before the collapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll5.8&quot;/&gt;

If the mass of the remnant exceeds about 3–4 solar masses (the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]]&lt;ref name=&quot;OV1939&quot;/&gt;)—either because the original star was very heavy or because the remnant collected additional mass through accretion of matter—even the degeneracy pressure of [[neutrons]] is insufficient to stop the collapse. After this, no known mechanism (except possibly quark degeneracy pressure, see [[quark star]]) is powerful enough to stop the collapse and the object will inevitably collapse to a black hole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll5.8&quot;/&gt;

This gravitational collapse of heavy stars is assumed to be responsible for the formation of [[stellar mass black hole]]s. [[Star formation]] in the young universe may have resulted in very heavy stars, which upon their collapse would have produced black holes of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; solar masses. These heavy black holes could be the seeds of the supermassive black holes found in the centers of most galaxies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReesVolonteri&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

While most of the energy released during gravitational collapse is emitted very quickly, an outside observer does not actually see the end of this process. Even though the collapse takes a finite amount of time from the [[frame of reference|reference frame]] of infalling matter, a distant observer sees the infalling material slow and halt just above the event horizon, due to [[gravitational time dilation]]. Light from the collapsing material takes longer and longer to reach the observer, with the light emitted just before the event horizon forms delayed an infinite amount of time. Thus the external observer never sees the formation of the event horizon; instead, the collapsing material seems to become dimmer and increasingly red-shifted, eventually fading away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Primordial black holes in the Big Bang====
Gravitational collapse requires great densities. In the current epoch of the universe these high densities are only found in stars, but in the early universe shortly after the [[big bang]] densities were much greater, possibly allowing for the creation of black holes. The high density alone is not enough to allow the formation of black holes since a uniform mass distribution will not allow the mass to bunch up. In order for [[primordial black holes]] to form in such a dense medium, there must be initial density perturbations that can then grow under their own gravity. Different models for the early universe vary widely in their predictions of the size of these perturbations. Various models predict the creation of black holes, ranging from a [[Planck mass]] to hundreds of thousands of solar masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===High-energy collisions===
[[File:CMS Higgs-event.jpg|thumb|right|A simulated event in the CMS detector, a collision in which a micro black hole may be created.]]
Gravitational collapse is not the only process that could create black holes. In principle, black holes could also be created in [[high-energy physics|high-energy]] collisions that create sufficient density. However, to date, no such events have ever been detected either directly or indirectly as a deficiency of the mass balance in [[particle accelerator]] experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Growth===
Once a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing additional matter. Any black hole will continually absorb gas and [[interstellar dust]] from its direct surroundings and omnipresent [[cosmic background radiation]]. This is the primary process through which supermassive black holes seem to have grown.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReesVolonteri&quot;/&gt; A similar process has been suggested for the formation of [[intermediate-mass black hole]]s in [[globular cluster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Another possibility is for a black hole to merge with other objects such as stars or even other black holes.

A stellar black hole of one solar mass has a Hawking temperature of about 100 [[nanokelvin]]s. This is far less than the 2.7 K temperature of the [[cosmic microwave background]]. Stellar mass (and larger) black holes receive more mass from the cosmic microwave background than they emit through Hawking radiation and will thus grow instead of shrink. To have a Hawking temperature larger than 2.7 K (and be able to evaporate), a black hole needs to be lighter than the [[Moon]] (and therefore a diameter of less than a tenth of a millimeter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A black hole the weight of a car (~10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt; m) would only take a nanosecond to evaporate, during which time it would briefly have a luminosity more than 200 times that of the sun.

==Observational evidence==
By their very nature, black holes do not directly emit any signals other than the hypothetical Hawking radiation; since the Hawking radiation for an astrophysical black hole is predicted to be very weak, this makes it impossible to directly detect astrophysical black holes from the Earth. A possible exception to the Hawking radiation being weak is the last stage of the evaporation of light (primordial) black holes; searches for such flashes in the past has proven unsuccessful and provides stringent limits on the possibility of existence of light primordial black holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Due to [[conservation of angular momentum]], gas falling into the [[gravitational well]] created by a massive object will typically form a disc-like structure around the object.

This process of accretion is one of the most efficient energy producing process known; up to 40% of the rest mass of the accreted material can be emitted in radiation.&lt;ref name=McClintockRemillard2006/&gt; (In nuclear fusion only about 0.7% of the rest mass will be emitted as energy.) In many cases, accretion discs are accompanied by [[relativistic jets]] emitted along the poles, which carry away much of the energy. The mechanism for the creation of these jets is currently not well understood.

As such many of the universe's more energetic phenomena have been attributed to the accretion of matter on black holes.

===X-ray binaries===
{{See also|X-ray binary}}

[[X-ray binaries]] are [[binary star]] systems that are luminous in the [[X-ray]] part of the spectrum. These X-ray emissions are generally thought to be caused by one of the component stars being a compact object accreting matter from the other (regular) star. The presence of an ordinary star in such a system provides a unique opportunity for studying the central object and determining if it might be a black hole.

[[File:Accretion Disk Binary System.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Artist impression of a binary system with an accretion disk around a compact object being fed by material from the companion star.]]

If such a system emits signals that can be directly traced back to the compact object, it cannot be a black hole. The absence of such a signal does, however, not exclude the possibility that the compact object is a neutron star. By studying the companion star it is often possible to obtain the orbital parameters of the system and obtain an estimate for the mass of the compact object. If this is much larger than the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (that is, the maximum mass a neutron star can have before collapsing) then the object cannot be a neutron star and is generally expected to be a black hole.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMS1999&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some doubt, however, remained due to the uncertainties resultant from the companion star being much heavier than the candidate black hole.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMS1999&quot;/&gt; Currently, better candidates for black holes are found in a class of X-ray binaries called soft X-ray transients.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMS1999&quot;/&gt; In this class of system the companion star is relatively low mass allowing for more accurate estimates in the black hole mass. Moreover, these systems are only active in X-ray for several months once every 10–50 years. During the period of low X-ray emission (called quiescence), the accretion disc is extremely faint allowing for detailed observation of the companion star during this period. One of the best such candidates is [[V404 Cyg]].

====Quiescence and advection-dominated accretion flow====
The faintness of the accretion disc during quiescence is thought to be caused by the flow entering a mode called an [[advection-dominated accretion flow]] (ADAF). In this mode, almost all the energy generated by friction in the disc is swept along with the flow instead of radiated away. If this model is correct, then it forms strong qualitative evidence for the presence of an event horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Quasi-periodic oscillations====
{{main|Quasi-periodic oscillations}}

The X-ray emission from accretion disks sometimes flickers at certain frequencies. These signals are called [[quasi-periodic oscillations]] and are thought to be caused by material moving along the inner edge of the accretion disk (the innermost stable circular orbit). As such their frequency is linked to the mass of the compact object. They can thus be used as an alternative way to determine the mass of potential black holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

===Gravitational lensing===

The deformation of spacetime around a massive object causes light rays to be deflected much like light passing through an optic [[Lens (optics)|lens]].

However, it has never been directly observed for a black hole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valerio&quot;/&gt; One possibility for observing gravitational lensing by a black hole would be to observe stars in orbit around the black hole. There are several candidates for such an observation in orbit around [[Sagittarius A*]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Valerio&quot;&gt;{{cite arxiv

However, it can be shown from general arguments in general relativity that any such object will have a maximum mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMS1999&quot;/&gt;

Since the average density of a black hole inside its Schwarzschild radius is inversely proportional to the square of its mass, supermassive black holes are much less dense than stellar black holes (the average density of a 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; solar mass black hole is comparable to that of water).&lt;ref name=&quot;CMS1999&quot;/&gt; Consequently, the physics of matter forming a supermassive black hole is much better understood and the possible alternative explanations for supermassive black hole observations are much more mundane. For example, a supermassive black hole could be modelled by a large cluster of very dark objects. However, typically such alternatives are not stable enough to explain the supermassive black hole candidates.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMS1999&quot;/&gt;

The evidence for stellar and supermassive black holes implies that in order for black holes not to form, general relativity must fail as a theory of gravity, perhaps due to the onset of [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] corrections. A much anticipated feature of a theory of quantum gravity is that it will not feature singularities or event horizons (and thus no black holes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1971, Hawking showed under general conditions&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In particular, he assumed that all matter satisfies the [[weak energy condition]].&lt;/ref&gt; that the total area of the event horizons of any collection of classical black holes can never decrease, even if they collide and merge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This result, now known as the [[second law of black hole mechanics]], is remarkably similar to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which states that the total [[entropy]] of a system can never decrease. As with classical objects at [[absolute zero]] temperature, it was assumed that black holes had zero entropy. If this were the case, the second law of thermodynamics would be violated by entropy-laden matter entering a black hole, resulting in a decrease of the total entropy of the universe. Therefore, Bekenstein proposed that a black hole should have an entropy, and that it should be proportional to its horizon area.&lt;ref name=&quot;wald99&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

The link with the laws of thermodynamics was further strengthened by Hawking's discovery that [[quantum field theory]] predicts that a black hole radiates [[blackbody radiation]] at a constant temperature. This seemingly causes a violation of the second law of black hole mechanics, since the radiation will carry away energy from the black hole causing it to shrink. The radiation, however also carries away entropy, and it can be proven under general assumptions that the sum of the entropy of the matter surrounding a black hole and one quarter of the area of the horizon as measured in [[Planck units]] is in fact always increasing. This allows the formulation of the [[first law of black hole mechanics]] as an analogue of the [[first law of thermodynamics]], with the mass acting as energy, the surface gravity as temperature and the area as entropy.&lt;ref name=&quot;wald99&quot;/&gt;

One puzzling feature is that the entropy of a black hole scales with its area rather than with its volume, since entropy is normally an [[extensive quantity]] that scales linearly with the volume of the system. This odd property led [[Gerard 't Hooft]] and [[Leonard Susskind]] to propose the [[holographic principle]], which suggests that anything that happens in volume of spacetime can be described by data on the boundary of that volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Although general relativity can be used to perform a semi-classical calculation of black hole entropy, this situation is theoretically unsatisfying. In [[statistical mechanics]], entropy is understood as counting the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have the same macroscopic qualities (such as [[mass]], [[Charge (physics)|charge]], [[pressure]], etc.). Without a satisfactory theory of [[quantum gravity]], one cannot perform such a computation for black holes. Some progress has been made in various approaches to quantum gravity. In 1995, [[Andrew Strominger]] and [[Cumrun Vafa]] showed that counting the microstates of a specific [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] black hole in [[string theory]] reproduced the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Black hole unitarity===
{{Main|Black hole information paradox}}
{{unsolved|physics|Is [[physical information]] lost in black holes?}}
An open question in fundamental physics is the so-called information loss paradox, or [[black hole information paradox|black hole unitarity]] paradox. Classically, the laws of physics are the same run forward or in reverse ([[T-symmetry]]). [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] dictates conservation of phase space volume, which can be thought of as &quot;conservation of information&quot;, so there is some problem even in classical physics. In quantum mechanics, this corresponds to a vital property called [[unitarity (physics)|unitarity]], which has to do with the conservation of probability (it can also be thought of as a conservation of quantum phase space volume as expressed by the [[density matrix]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;PlayDice000&quot;&gt;{{cite web

{{Nuclear physics}} 

In [[nuclear physics]], '''beta decay''' is a type of [[radioactive decay]] in which a [[beta particle]] (an [[electron]] or a [[positron]]) is emitted. In the case of electron emission, it is referred to as ''beta minus'' ({{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}}), while in the case of a [[positron emission]] as ''beta plus'' ({{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}}).  In electron emission, an [[electron antineutrino]] is also emitted, while positron emission is accompanied by an [[electron neutrino]]. Beta decay is mediated by the [[weak force]].

Emitted beta particles have a continuous [[kinetic energy]] spectrum, ranging from 0 to the maximal available energy (''[[Q value (nuclear science)|Q]]''), which depends on the parent and daughter nuclear states that participate in the decay. A typical ''Q'' is around 1 MeV, but it can range from a few keV to a few tens of MeV. Since the [[Mass-energy equivalence|equivalence of energy]] of the [[rest mass]] of electron is 511 keV, the most energetic beta particles are [[ultrarelativistic]], with speeds very close to the [[speed of light]].

Sometimes [[electron capture]] decay is included as a type of beta decay (and is referred to as &quot;inverse beta decay&quot;), because the basic process, mediated by the [[weak force]] is the same. However, no beta particle is emitted, but only an electron neutrino. Instead of beta-plus emission, an inner atomic electron is captured by a proton in the nucleus. This type of decay is therefore analogous to positron emission (and also happens, as an alternative decay route, in all positron-emitters). However, the route of electron capture is the ''only'' type of decay that is allowed in proton-rich nuclides that ''do not'' have sufficient energy to emit a positron (and neutrino). These may still reach a lower energy state, by the equivalent process of electron-capture and neutrino-emission.

== {{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}} decay ==

In {{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}} decay, the [[weak interaction]] converts a [[neutron]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Neutron}}) into a [[proton]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Proton}}) while emitting an electron ({{SubatomicParticle|Electron|link=yes}}) and an [[electron antineutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino}}):

&lt;math&gt;
n \rightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu_e}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--:{| border=&quot;0&quot;
|- style=&quot;height:2em;&quot;
|{{SubatomicParticle|Neutron|link=yes}}&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;||{{SubatomicParticle|Proton|link=yes}}&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbspSubatomicParticle|Electron Antineutrino|link=yes}}
|}--&gt;

At the [[fundamental particle|fundamental]] level (as depicted in the [[Feynman diagram]] below), this is due to the conversion of a [[down quark]] to an [[up quark]] by emission of a [[W boson|{{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} boson]]; the {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} boson subsequently decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Beta-minus Decay.svg|{{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}} decay in an [[atomic nucleus]]. The intermediate emission of a virtual [[W boson|{{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} boson]] is omitted.
Image:Beta Negative Decay.svg|The [[Feynman diagram]] for {{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}} decay of a [[neutron]] into a [[proton]], [[electron]], and [[electron antineutrino]] via an intermediate [[W boson|{{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} boson]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

{{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}} decay generally occurs in neutron rich nuclei.

== {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}} decay ==
{{see also|Positron emission}}
In {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}} decay, energy is used to convert a proton into a neutron, while emitting a [[positron]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Positron}}) and an [[electron neutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Electron Neutrino}}):

&lt;!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.11 by SkyLined]]
energy + p -&gt; n + e+ + ve
--&gt;:{| border=&quot;0&quot;
|- style=&quot;height:2em;&quot;
|energy&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||{{SubatomicParticle|Proton}}&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;||{{SubatomicParticle|Neutron}}&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||{{SubatomicParticle|Positron}}&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||{{SubatomicParticle|Electron Neutrino}}
|}

So, unlike {{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}} decay cannot occur in isolation, because it requires energy, the [[mass]] of the neutron being greater than the mass of the proton. {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}} decay can only happen inside nuclei when the value of the [[binding energy]] of the mother nucleus is less than that of the daughter nucleus. The difference between these energies goes into the reaction of converting a proton into a neutron, a positron and a neutrino and into the kinetic energy of these particles.
{{clr}}

== Electron capture (K-capture)==
{{Main|Electron capture}}
In all the cases where {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}} decay is allowed energetically (and the proton is a part of a nucleus with electron shells), it is accompanied by the [[electron capture]] process, when an atomic electron is captured by a nucleus with the emission of a neutrino:

&lt;!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.11 by SkyLined]]
energy + p + e- -&gt; n + ve
--&gt;:{| border=&quot;0&quot;
|- style=&quot;height:2em;&quot;
|energy&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||{{SubatomicParticle|Proton}}&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||{{SubatomicParticle|Electron}}&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;||{{SubatomicParticle|Neutron}}&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||{{SubatomicParticle|Electron Neutrino}}
|}

However, in proton-rich nuclei where the energy difference between initial and final states is less than 2''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}} decay is not energetically possible, and electron capture is the sole decay mode.

This decay is also called K-capture, because the 'inner most' electron of an atom belongs to the K-shell of the [[electronic configuration]] of the atom and this has the highest probability to interact with the nucleus.

[There is an analogous process possible in theory in antimatter: antiproton-rich antimatter radioisotopes isotopes might decay via an analogous process of positron capture, but in practice, no such complex antimatter nuclides have either been discovered or artificially constructed.]

== Nuclear transmutation ==
[[File:Table isotopes en.svg|250px|right]]
If the proton and neutron are part of an [[atomic nucleus]], these decay processes [[Nuclear transmutation|transmute]] one chemical element into another. For example:

&lt;!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.11 by SkyLined]]
Cs-137 _ _  -&gt; Ba-137 + e- + !ve (beta_minus_decay)

|}

Beta decay does not change the number of [[nucleon]]s, ''A'', in the nucleus but changes only its [[electric charge|charge]], ''Z''. Thus the set of all [[nuclide]]s with the same ''A'' can be introduced; these [[isobar (nuclide)|''isobaric'' nuclides]] may turn into each other via beta decay. Among them, several nuclides (at least one) are beta stable, because they present local minima of the [[mass excess]]: if such a nucleus has (''A'', ''Z'') numbers, the neighbour nuclei (''A'', ''Z''&amp;minus;1) and (''A'', ''Z''+1) have higher mass excess and can beta decay into (''A'', ''Z''), but not vice versa. For all odd mass numbers ''A'' the global minimum is also the unique local minimum. For even ''A'', there are up to three different beta-stable isobars experimentally known; for example, {{Nuclide2|zirconium|96}}, {{Nuclide2|Molybdenum|96}}, and {{Nuclide2|Ruthenium|96}} are all beta-stable, though the first one can undergo a very rare double beta decay (see below)&lt;!-- and the last also!! but who cares this very special A=96 behaviour HERE?--&gt;. There are about 355 known [[beta-decay stable isobars|beta-decay stable nuclides]] total.

A beta-stable nucleus may undergo other kinds of radioactive decay ([[alpha decay]], for example). In nature, most isotopes are beta stable, but a few exceptions exist with [[half life|half-lives]] so long that they have not had enough time to decay since the moment of their [[nucleosynthesis]]. One example is {{Nuclide2|link=yes|Potassium|40}}, which undergoes all three types of beta decay ({{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}} and electron capture) with a half life of {{val|1.277|e=9}} years.

== Double beta decay ==
{{main|Double beta decay}}

Some nuclei can undergo '''double beta decay''' (ββ decay) where the charge of the nucleus changes by two units. Double beta decay is difficult to study in most practically interesting cases, because both β decay and ββ decay are possible, with probability favoring β decay; the rarer ββ decay process is masked by these events. Thus, ββ decay is usually studied only for beta stable nuclei. Like single beta decay, double beta decay does not change ''A''; thus, at least one of the nuclides with some given ''A'' has to be stable with regard to both single and double beta decay.

Beta decay can be considered as a [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation]] as described in quantum mechanics, and thus follows [[Fermi's Golden Rule]].

==Bound-state β&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; decay==
For fully ionized atoms (bare nuclei), it is possible for electrons to be emitted from the nucleus into low-lying atomic bound states (orbitals). This can not occur for neutral atoms whose low-lying bound states are already filled.

The phenomenon was first observed for &lt;sup&gt;163&lt;/sup&gt;Dy&lt;sup&gt;66+&lt;/sup&gt; in 1992 by Jung et al. of the Darmstadt Heavy-Ion Research group. Although neutral &lt;sup&gt;163&lt;/sup&gt;Dy is a stable isotope, the fully ionized &lt;sup&gt;163&lt;/sup&gt;Dy&lt;sup&gt;66+&lt;/sup&gt; undergoes β decay into the K and L shells with a half-life of 47 days.&lt;ref&gt;M. Jung et al., Phys. Rev. Letts. 69, 2164 (1992) First observation of bound-state beta minus decay.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possibility is that a fully ionized atom undergoes greatly accelerated β decay, as observed for &lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Re by Bosch et al., also at Darmstadt. Neutral &lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Re does undergo β decay with a half life of 42 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years, but for fully ionized &lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Re&lt;sup&gt;75+&lt;/sup&gt; this is shortened by a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; to only 32.9 years.&lt;ref&gt;F. Bosch et al., Phys. Rev. Letts. 77, 5190 (1996) Observation of bound-state beta minus decay of fully ionized &lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Re: &lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Re-&lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Os Cosmochronometry&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison the variation of decay rates of other nuclear processes due to chemical environment is less than 1%. (See [[Radioactive decay#Changing decay rates]])

==Kurie plot== &lt;!-- Note: Kurie is correct (see References below); no relation to the Curies --&gt;
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

A '''Kurie plot''' (also known as a '''Fermi-Kurie plot''') is a graph used in studying beta decay developed by [[Franz N. D. Kurie]], in which the square root of the number of beta particles whose momenta (or energy) lie within a certain narrow range, divided by a function worked out by Fermi, is plotted against beta-particle energy; it is a straight line for allowed transitions and some forbidden transitions, in accord with the Fermi beta-decay theory.
Linear regression of a Fermi-Kurie Plot can help determining the maximum energy imparted to the electron/positron by determining the energy-axis(x-axis) intercept. This graph helps us to know a better way of understanding of emission of beta particle.

==History==
===Discovery and characterization of {{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}} decay===
Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by [[Henri Becquerel]] in uranium, and subsequently observed by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] in thorium and in the new elements polonium and radium.
In 1899 [[Ernest Rutherford]] separated radioactive emissions into two types: alpha and beta (now beta minus), based on penetration of objects and ability to cause ionization. Alpha rays could be stopped by thin sheets of paper or aluminum, whereas beta rays could penetrate several millimetres of aluminum. (In 1900 [[Paul Villard]] identified [[gamma ray]]s as a third, still more penetrating type of radiation.)

In 1900 Becquerel measured the ratio of electric charge to mass (e/m) for beta particles by the method of [[J.J. Thomson]] used to study cathode rays and identify the electron. He found that e/m for a beta particle is the same as for Thomson’s electron, and therefore suggested that the beta particle is in fact an electron. 

In 1901 Rutherford and [[Frederick Soddy]] showed that alpha and beta radioactivity involves the [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of atoms into atoms of other chemical elements. In 1913, after the products of more radioactive decays were known, Soddy and [[Kazimierz Fajans]] independently proposed their [[Radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy|radioactive displacement law]], which states that beta (i.e. {{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}}) emission from one element produces another element one place to the right in the periodic table, while alpha emission produces an element two places to the left.

===Neutrinos in beta decay===

Historically, the study of beta decay provided the first physical evidence of the [[neutrino]]. In 1911 [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Hahn]] performed an experiment that showed that the energies of electrons emitted by beta decay had a continuous rather than discrete spectrum.  This was in apparent contradiction to the [[law of conservation of energy]], as it appeared that energy was lost in the beta decay process.  A second problem was that the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of the [[Nitrogen-14]] atom was 1, in contradiction to the Rutherford prediction of ½.

In 1920-1927, [[Charles Drummond Ellis]] (along with [[James Chadwick]] and colleagues) established clearly that the beta decay spectrum is really continuous, ending all controversies.

In a famous letter written in 1930 [[Wolfgang Pauli]] suggested that in addition to electrons and protons atoms also contained an extremely light neutral particle which he called the neutron.  He suggested that this &quot;neutron&quot; was also emitted during beta decay and had simply not yet been observed.  In 1931 [[Enrico Fermi]] renamed Pauli's &quot;neutron&quot; to neutrino, and in 1934 Fermi published a very successful [[Fermi's interaction|model of beta decay]] in which neutrinos were produced.

===Other types of beta decay===
In 1934 [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie|Frédéric]] and [[Irène Joliot-Curie]] bombarded aluminum with alpha particles to effect the nuclear reaction &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He + &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al → &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;P + n, and observed that the product isotope &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;P emits a positron identical to those found in cosmic rays by [[Carl David Anderson]] in 1932. This was the first example of {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}} decay, which they termed artificial radioactivity since &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;P is a short-lived nuclide which does not exist in nature.

The theory of electron capture was first discussed by [[Gian-Carlo Wick]] in a 1934 paper, and then developed by [[Hideki Yukawa]] and others.  K-electron capture was first observed in 1937 by [[Luis Alvarez]], in the nuclide &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;V.&lt;ref name=k&gt;pp. 11–12, K-Electron Capture by Nuclei, Emilio Segré, chapter 3 in ''Discovering Alvarez: selected works of Luis W.

'''Blitzkrieg''' ([[German language|German]], &quot;lightning war&quot;; {{Audio|De-blitzkrieg.ogg|listen}}) is an [[anglicized]] word&lt;ref&gt;Fanning 1997, p. 283-287.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes 2001, p. 135&quot;&gt;Holmes 2001, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris 1995, p. 337-338&quot;&gt;Harris 1995, p. 337-338.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Fanning contends that the word was not the invention of western journalists, but existed in different forms in a variety of languages. He asserts it was not used by German military theorists or by the German Army prior to 1939. In the thousands of military journals produced in Germany between 1933-39, the word is mentioned only once in two different papers. In English and other languages apart from German, the phrase had been used since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Fanning 1997, pp. 283-287.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Richard Holmes]] contends that the word was anglicized and did not enter into popular/widespread usage until used by journalists, where he asserts it was first coined. Holmes asserts there was no &quot;coherent doctrine&quot; or a &quot;unifying concept of blitzkrieg&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes 2001, p. 135&quot;/&gt; Harris notes that it was the British who coined the phrase first, to describe the German successes in Poland. The German popular press did not use the word until later. [[Heinz Guderian]] noted that it was a word coined by the Allies; &quot;as a result of the successes of our rapid campaigns our enemies (emphasis added) coined the word 'Blitzkrieg'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris 1995, p. 337-338&quot;/&gt; Harris concludes, &quot;Blitzkrieg seems to have gained popularity as a piece of journalistic sensationalism - a buzz-word with which to label the spectacular early successes of the Germans in the Second World War. In the West it seems first to have been applied to the Polish campaign of September 1939 and was later attached to the Norwegian and Western campaigns of 1940, to the Balkan campaign of 1941, to some of the North African campaigns, and to the early stages of the attack on Russia, but most enduringly to the bombing campaign against Great Britain (especially London), which is still popularly known as the ’Blitz’.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harris 1995, pp. 338-339.&lt;/ref&gt; German Historian Karl-Heinz Frieser disputes that the word ''originated'' through British journalism. He points to the word and its mention in two articles prior to 1939. However, he does accept the word only gained publicity through journalism. He notes that the British press were first to do this on 25 September 1939, but also points to the extensive use of the word by the German press in 1940, after the fall of France in 1940, some nine months later.&lt;ref&gt;Frieser 1995, p. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; |group=&quot;Notes&quot;}} describing all-mechanized [[force concentration]] of tanks, infantry, artillery and air power, concentrating overwhelming force at high speed to break through enemy lines, and, once the latter is broken, proceeding without regard to its flank. Through constant motion, the blitzkrieg attempts to keep its enemy off-balance, making it difficult to respond effectively at any given point before the front has already moved on.

During the [[interwar period]], aircraft and tank technologies matured and were combined with systematic application of the German tactics of infiltration and bypassing of enemy strong points.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, ''The Mask of Command'' p.260&lt;/ref&gt; When Germany [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded Poland in 1939]], Western journalists adopted the term blitzkrieg to describe this form of armoured warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan 1989, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Blitzkrieg operations were very effective during the campaigns of 1939 - 1941. These operations were dependent on surprise penetrations (e.g. the penetration of the [[Ardennes]] forest region), general enemy unpreparedness and an inability to react swiftly enough to the attacker's offensive operations. During the [[Battle of France]], the French, who made attempts to re-form defensive lines along rivers, were constantly frustrated when German forces arrived there first and pressed on.&lt;ref&gt;Shirer, William, ''The Collapse of the Third Republic: An Inquiry into the Fall of France in 1940'', Ch.29&amp;ndash;31, &quot;The Fall of France I, II, (and) III&quot; for a (partially eye-witnessed) account of the strategic and tactical success in the [[Battle of France]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Only later, during the [[invasion of the Soviet Union]], would the flaws of blitzkrieg come to be realized. In [[France]] and [[Poland]] the foot-bound infantry had been, at most, a few hours behind the armored spearheads. In the vast open Soviet [[steppe]] delays of hours would become days, allowing the Soviet forces to gather at points far behind the lines and thereby give their infantry enough time to set up defensive positions.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan 1989, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] for instance, the Soviet forces formed up hundreds of kilometers from the German breakout point. The Germans as well as the Allies, both in the West and the Soviet Union, would eventually realize the failings of blitzkrieg warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Naveh 1997, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics since the 1970s have questioned the existence of blitzkrieg as a coherent military doctrine or strategy. Many academic historians hold blitzkrieg itself to be a myth. Others continue to use the word to describe German strategy and doctrine throughout the Second World War ([[Blitzkrieg#Controversy|see controversy section]]).

==Definition==
===Common interpretation===
The classic interpretation of blitzkrieg is that of German [[Military tactics|tactical]] and [[Military operation|operation]]al methodology in the first half of the [[Second World War]] that was often hailed as a new method of warfare. The word, meaning &quot;lightning war&quot;, in its strategic means is associated with a series of quick and decisive short battles to deliver a knockout blow to an enemy state before it could fully mobilize. The tactical meaning of blitzkrieg involves a coordinated military effort by tanks, mobilized infantry, artillery and aircraft, to create an overwhelming local superiority in combat power, to overwhelm an enemy and break through its lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keegan 2005, p. 109&quot;&gt;Keegan 2005, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris 1995, p. 334-336&lt;/ref&gt; Blitzkrieg as used by Germany had considerable psychological, or as some writers call, &quot;terror&quot; elements, such as the noise-making propellers on the [[Junkers Ju 87]] dive-bombers to affect the morale of enemy forces.{{#tag:ref|Nothing appeared in Luftwaffe 'doctrine' stipulating &quot;terror&quot; as a major operational factor. The method of &quot;terror&quot;, was denied to German aerial operations (and strategic bombing methods) by the Luftwaffe field manual ''The Conduct of Air Operations'', Regulation 16, issued in 1935. [[James Corum]] covers the subjectcm cxnb in ''The Roots of Blitzkrieg: Hans von Seeckt and German Military Reform''&lt;ref&gt;Corum 2002, pp. 167-169.&lt;/ref&gt; In other work, ''The Luftwaffe: Creating the Operational Air War, 1918-1940'', Corum goes into greater detail. Regulation 16 denied &quot;terror&quot; operations against civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Corum 1997, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Corum does state that it was not until 1942 when indiscriminate &quot;terror&quot; operations, in which terror and civilian casualties become the primary target, took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corum 1997, p. 7&quot;&gt;Corum 1997, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; As far as the Ju 87 is concerned, it is thought the sirens were suggested to the Junkers company by [[Ernst Udet]] to undermine the morale of enemy forces&lt;ref&gt;Griehl 201, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;Notes&quot;}} The devices were largely removed when the enemy became used to the noise, after the [[Battle of France]] in 1940, bombs sometimes having whistles attached instead.&lt;ref&gt;Griehl 2001, pp. 31, 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; It is also common for writers to include psychological tactics behind the line, using [[Fifth columnists]] to spread rumours and untruths among the civil population in the theatre of operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keegan 2005, p. 109&quot;/&gt;

===Academic study===
The origins of the term blitzkrieg are obscure. It was never used in the title of a military doctrine or handbook of the German army or air force.&lt;ref&gt;Frieser 2005, pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
It seems rarely to have been used in the German military press before 1939. Recent research conducted at the German military historical
institute at Freiburg has found only two military articles from the 1930s in which it is employed. Neither article advocates any radically new military doctrine or approach to war. Both use the term simply to mean a swift strategic knockout. The first, published in 1935, deals primarily with food (and to a lesser extent with raw material) supplies in wartime. The term blitzkrieg is here employed with reference to Germany’s efforts to win a quick victory in the [[First World War]] and is not associated with the use of armoured or mechanized forces or with airpower. The argument is that Germany must develop self-sufficiency in food supplies because it might again prove impossible to deal a swift knockout to her enemies and a protracted total war might prove unavoidable. The second article, published in 1938, states that launching a swift strategic knockout has great attractions for Germany but appears to accept that such a knockout will be very difficult to achieve by land attack under modern conditions (especially in view of the existence of systems of [[fortification]] like the [[Maginot Line]]) unless an exceptionally high degree of surprise is achieved. The author vaguely suggests that a massive strategic air attack might hold out better prospects, but that topic is not explored in any detail.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 1995, pp. 336–337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another relatively early use of the term in a German-language work was in a book by Fritz Sternberg, a [[Jewish]] [[Marxist]] political economist who was a refugee from the ''Third Reich''. Entitled ''Die Deutsche Kriegsstärke'' (German War Strength), it was published in [[Paris]] in 1939. It had been preceded by an English-language edition of 1938 called Germany and a Lightning War. The German edition uses the term blitzkrieg. The book’s argument is that Germany is not prepared economically for a long war but might win a lightning war. It does not treat in any detail operational and tactical matters, and does not suggest that the German armed forces have evolved a radically new operational method. It offers scant clues as to how German lightning pei victories might be won.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 1995, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roots of German military methods==
During the First World War, on the Western front, the two sides had been locked in a trench war, where kill zones by overlapping fire of machine guns and barbed wire prevented either side from breaking through. The British introduced the tank as invulnerable to machine gun fire, and able to cross trenches and breach barbed wire, to lead men across the battlefield. The British had been able to penetrate German lines this way, but not enough tanks were made before the war ended. The Germans had therefore first-hand experience of the potential of tanks to change the battlefield. Where the allied armies were slow to deploy and study the tank in the inter-war years, the German army was very eager to study and master this new technology.

===Development of German tactical methods===
German operational theories began to evolve immediately after Germany's defeat in the First World War. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] limited any German Army to a maximum of 100,000 men, making impossible the deployment of massed [[troops]] which had characterized German strategy before the War. Although the [[German General Staff]] was also abolished by the treaty, it nevertheless continued to exist as the [[Truppenamt]] or &quot;Troop Office&quot;, supposedly only an administrative body. Committees of veteran staff officers were formed within the Truppenamt to evaluate 57 issues of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Corum 1997, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Their reports led to doctrinal and training publications, which became the standard procedures by the time of the Second World War. The Reichswehr was influenced by its analysis of pre-war German military thought, in particular the infiltration tactics which at the end of the war had seen some breakthroughs in the Western Front's trench war, and the maneuver warfare which dominated the [[Eastern Front (WWI)|Eastern Front]].

===Return to Prussian and 19th Century methodology===
German military history had previously been influenced by [[Carl von Clausewitz]], [[Alfred von Schlieffen]] and [[Helmuth Graf von Moltke|von Moltke the Elder]], who were proponents of maneuver, mass, and envelopment.  During and after the First World War, these concepts were further developed by generals, such as [[Oskar von Hutier]] and the Reichswehr. Following the First World War, these concepts were modified by the Reichswehr. The German army Chief of Staff, [[Hans von Seeckt]], moved doctrine away from what he argued was an excessive focus on encirclement towards one based on speed.&lt;ref&gt;Corum 1997, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his command, a modern update of the doctrinal system called ''[[Bewegungskrieg]]'' (&quot;maneuver warfare&quot;) and its associated leadership system called ''[[Auftragstaktik]]'' (&quot;mission tactics&quot;; i.e., units are assigned missions; local commanders decide how to achieve those missions) was developed, which was a critical advantage and a major reason for the success of blitzkrieg. This concept was abandoned in January 1942. The ''OKW'' believed it too risky to allow German Corps and [[Army Group]]s to be operated and commanded independently by one field commander.

The German leadership had also been criticized for failing to understand the technical advances of the First World War, having given [[History of the tank|tank production]] the lowest priority and having conducted no studies of the [[machine gun]] prior to that war.&lt;ref&gt;Corum 1992, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, German officers attended [[technical school]]s during this period of rebuilding after the war. The infiltration tactics developed by the German Army during the First World War became the basis for later tactics. German infantry had advanced in small, decentralized groups which bypassed resistance in favour of advancing at weak points and attacking rear-area communications. This was aided by coordinated artillery and air bombardments, and followed by larger infantry forces with heavy guns, which destroyed centers of resistance. These concepts formed the basis of the Wehrmacht's tactics during the Second World War.

On the Eastern Front of World War I, where combat did not bog down into trench warfare, German and Russian armies fought a war of maneuver over thousands of miles, giving the German leadership unique experience which the trench-bound Western Allies did not have.&lt;ref&gt;Corum 1992, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of operations in the East led to the conclusion that small and coordinated forces possessed more combat worth than large, uncoordinated forces.

==Differing views==
During this period, all the war's major combatants developed mechanized force theories. However, the official doctrines of the Western Allies differed substantially from those of the Reichswehr. British, French, and American doctrines broadly favoured a more deliberate set-piece battle, using mechanized forces to maintain the impetus and momentum of an offensive. There was less emphasis on combined arms, deep penetration or concentration. In short, their philosophy was not too different from that which they had at the end of World War I. Although early Reichswehr periodicals contained many translated works from Allied sources, they were rarely adopted. Technical advances in foreign countries were, however, observed and used in part by the Weapons Office of the Reichswehr. Foreign doctrines are widely considered to have had little serious influence.&lt;ref&gt;Argued by Corum, Edwards, and House. This is not to include theories which were not adopted as actual doctrine, on which there are varied views.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
British theorists [[J.F.C. Fuller]] and Captain [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] have often been associated with the development of blitzkrieg, though this is a matter of controversy. During World War I, Fuller had been a staff officer attached to the newly-developed tank force. He later developed plans for massive, independent tank operations and was subsequently studied by the German military.

Although the British Army's lessons were mainly drawn from the infantry and artillery offensives on the Western Front in late 1918, one &quot;sideshow&quot; theatre had witnessed operations that involved some aspects of what would later become blitzkrieg. In Palestine, General [[Edmund Allenby]] had used cavalry to seize railway and communication centers deep in the enemy rear during the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] in September 1918, while aircraft disrupted enemy lines of communication and headquarters. These methods had induced &quot;strategic paralysis&quot; among the defending [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops and led to their rapid and complete collapse. Although Liddell Hart highlighted the importance of Allenby's &quot;indirect approach&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liddell Hart|first=B. H.|authorlink=B. H. Liddell Hart|title=History of the First World War|publisher=Pan Books|location=London|isbn=9780330233545|page=436}}&lt;/ref&gt; the British Army's establishment preferred to publicise the anachronistic success of Allenby's cavalry for several years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/caj/documents/vol_07/iss_1/caj_vol7.1_06_e.pdf Canadian Army publication, p.7]&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
French doctrine in the mid-war years was defense-oriented. Colonel [[Charles de Gaulle]] was a known advocate of concentration of armor and airplanes. His opinions were expressed in his book, ''Vers l'Armée de Métier'' (Towards the Professional Army). Like von Seeckt, he concluded that France could no longer maintain the huge armies of conscripts and reservists with which World War I had been fought, and sought to use tanks, mechanized forces and aircraft to allow a smaller number of highly trained soldiers to have greater impact in battle. His views little endeared him to the French high command, but are claimed by some to have influenced [[Heinz Guderian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1890-1940-la-genese/un-officier-non-conformiste/analyses/charles-de-gaulle-au-sgdn-1931-1937.php |title=1890–1940 : un officier non-conformiste |work=www.charles-de-gaulle.org |language=French |accessdate=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
In 1916, General [[Alexei Brusilov]] had used infiltration tactics and surprise during the [[Brusilov Offensive]]. Later, Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], one of the most prominent officers of the [[Red Army]] of the [[Soviet Union]] during the inter-war years, developed the concept of [[deep operations]] from his experiences of the [[Polish-Soviet War]]. These concepts would guide Red Army doctrine throughout World War II. Realising the limitations of infantry and cavalry, Tukhachevsky was an advocate of mechanized formations, and the large-scale industrialization required. However, Robert Watt states that blitzkrieg holds little in common with Soviet deep battle.&lt;ref&gt;Watt 2008, pp. 677-678.&lt;/ref&gt; H P Wilmott has noted that deep battle contains two critical differences - it advocated the idea of total war, not limited operations and it also rejected the idea of the decisive battle in favour of several large scale and simultaneous offensives.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmott 2002, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reichswehr and the Red Army collaborated in [[military exercise|war games]] and tests in [[Kazan]] and [[Lipetsk]] beginning in 1926. Set within the Soviet Union, these two centers were used to field test aircraft and armored vehicles up to the battalion level, as well as housing aerial and armored warfare schools through which officers were rotated. This was done in the Soviet Union, in secret, to evade the Treaty of Versailles's occupational agent, the [[Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control|Inter-Allied Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Roger, ''Panzer, a Revolution in Warfare: 1939–1945'', p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===

After becoming head of state in 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] ignored the Versailles Treaty provisions. A command for armored forces was created within the German Wehrmacht; the ''[[Panzerwaffe]]'', as it came to be known later. The Luftwaffe, the German air force, was established, and development begun on ground-attack aircraft and doctrines. Hitler was a strong supporter of this new strategy. He read Guderian's book [[Achtung - Panzer!]] and upon observing armored field exercises at [[Kummersdorf]] he remarked “That is what I want—and that is what I will have.”&lt;ref&gt;Guderian, Heinz; ''Panzer Leader'', p.46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Roger, ''Panzer, a Revolution in Warfare: 1939–1945'', p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guderian's armored concept===
[[File:GuGuderian.jpg|thumb|upright|Heinz Guderian]]
[[Heinz Guderian]]  was probably the first to fully develop and advocate the principles associated with blitzkrieg. He summarized combined-arms tactics as the way to get the mobile and motorized armored divisions to work together and support each other in order to achieve decisive success. In his book, [[Panzer Leader (book)|''Panzer Leader'']], he wrote:

{{quote|In this year,  1929, I became convinced that tanks working on their own or in conjunction with infantry could never achieve decisive importance. My historical studies, the exercises carried out in England and our own experience with mock-ups had persuaded me that the tanks would never be able to produce their full effect until the other weapons on whose support they must inevitably rely were brought up to their standard of speed and of cross-country performance. In such formation of all arms, the tanks must play primary role, the other weapons beings subordinated to the requirements of the armor. It would be wrong to include tanks in infantry divisions; what was needed were armored divisions which would include all the supporting arms needed to allow the tanks to fight with full effect.&lt;ref&gt;Guderian, Heinz; ''Panzer Leader'', p.13&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Guderian believed that developments in technology were required to support the theory; especially equipping armored divisions —  tanks foremost, with wireless communications. Guderian insisted in 1933 to the high command that every tank in the German armored force must be equipped with radio.&lt;ref&gt;Guderian, Heinz; ''Panzer Leader'', p.20&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the war, only the German army was thus equipped with all tanks having radio. This proved critical in early tank battles where German tank commanders could maneuver their tanks in better organized ways than the Allies. Later all allied armies would copy this innovation.

===Spanish Civil War===
German volunteers first used armor in live field conditions during the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936. Armor commitment consisted of Panzer Battalion 88, a force built around three companies of [[Panzer I]] tanks that functioned as a training cadre for Nationalists. The Luftwaffe deployed squadrons of [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[dive bomber]]s, and [[Military transport aircraft|transport aircraft]] as the ''[[Condor Legion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Roger; ''Panzer, a Revolution in Warfare: 1939–1945'', p.145.&lt;/ref&gt; Guderian said that the tank deployment was “on too small a scale to allow accurate assessments to be made.”&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Roger; ''Panzer, a Revolution in Warfare: 1939–1945'', p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; The true test of his “armored idea” would have to wait for the Second World War. However, the ''Luftwaffe'' also provided volunteers to Spain to test both tactics and aircraft in combat, including the first combat use of the ''[[Junkers Ju 87|Stuka]]''.

During the war, the ''Condor Legion'' undertook the bombing of Guernica which had a tremendous psychological effect on the populations of Europe. The results were exaggerated, and the [[Western Allies]] concluded that the &quot;city-busting&quot; techniques were now a part of the German way in war. The targets of the German aircraft were actually the rail lines and bridges. But lacking the ability to hit them with accuracy (only three or four Ju 87s saw action in Spain), a method of [[carpet bombing]] was chosen resulting in heavy civilian casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Corum 2007, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of operations ==
=== Schwerpunkt ===
The Germans referred to a ''Schwerpunkt'' (focal point and also known as ''Schwerpunktprinzip'' or concentration principle) in the planning of operations; it was a center of gravity or point of maximum effort, where a decisive action could be achieved. Ground, mechanized and tactical air forces were concentrated at this point of maximum effort whenever possible. By local success at the ''Schwerpunkt'', a small force achieved a breakthrough and gained advantages by fighting in the enemy's rear. It is summarized by Guderian as “Klotzen nicht kleckern!” (literally means &quot;strike concentrated, not dispersed).&lt;ref name=&quot;Frieser 2005, pp. 156–157&quot;&gt;Frieser 2005, pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve a breakout, armoured forces would attack the enemy's defensive line directly, supported by motorized infantry, artillery fire and aerial bombardment in order to create a breach in the enemy's line. Through this breach the tanks and motorised units could break through without the traditional encumbrance of the slow logistics of infantry on foot.
In this, the opening phase of an operation, air forces sought to gain superiority over enemy air forces by attacking aircraft on the ground, bombing their airfields, and seeking to destroy them in air to air combat.
The principle of ''Schwerpunkt'' enabled the attacker to win numerical superiority at the point of the main effort, which in turn gave the attacker [[Military tactics|tactical]] and [[operational]] superiority even though the attacker may be numerically and [[Strategy|strategically]] inferior along the entire front.&lt;ref&gt;Frieser 2005, pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pursuit ===
Having achieved a breakthrough into the enemy's rear areas, German forces attempted to paralyze the enemy's ability to react. Moving faster than enemy forces, mobile forces exploited weaknesses and acted before opposing forces could formulate a response.
Central to this is the [[decision cycle]]. Every decision made by German or opposing forces required time to gather information, make a decision, disseminate orders to subordinates, and then implement this decision through action. Through superior mobility and faster decision-making cycles, mobile forces could take action on a situation sooner than the forces opposing them.

[[Directive control]] was a fast and flexible method of command. Rather than receiving an explicit order, a commander would be told of his superior's intent and the role which his unit was to fill in this concept. The exact method of execution was then a matter for the low-level commander to determine as best fit the situation. Staff burden was reduced at the top and spread among commands more knowledgeable about their own situation. In addition, the encouragement of initiative at all levels aided implementation. As a result, significant decisions could be effected quickly and either verbally or with written orders a few pages in length.&lt;ref&gt;Frieser 2005, pp. 344–346.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Destruction of pockets of resistance ===
An operation's final phase, was the destruction of the [[pocket (military)|pocket]]s which were [[envelop]]ed by the initial stages of an operation. The ''Kesselschlacht'', (&quot;cauldron battle&quot;),&lt;!--[http://translate.google.co.uk/?hl=en&amp;tab=wT#en|de|cauldron] another translation for kessel is kettle but German does not have two distinct words for this -- think of &quot;pot&quot; in English there are big pots small pots etc, in German &quot;großer Kessel&quot; is cauldron and Wasserkessel is a kettle, the most useful translation or the metaphor, and the one usually used is cauldron--&gt; was a concentric attack on encircled forces earlier bypassed by the ''Schwerpunkt'' attack(s). It was here that most losses were inflicted upon the enemy, primarily through the capture of prisoners and weapons. During the initial phases of [[Operation Barbarossa|Barbarossa]], massive encirclements netted nearly 3,500,000 Soviet prisoners along with masses of equipment.{{#tag:ref|Some 58 percent of prisoners died through neglect, starvation, or other causes associated with [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs]]&lt;ref&gt;Glantz and House 1995, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;Notes&quot;}}&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, John; ''The Mask of Command'', p.265&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of Air Power===
In this regard, [[close air support]] was provided in the form of the dive-bomber and [[medium bomber]]. They would support the focal point of attack from the air. German successes are closely related to the extent to which the German ''Luftwaffe'' was able to control the air war in early campaigns in Europe and the Soviet Union. However, the ''Luftwaffe'' was a broadly based force with no constricting central doctrine, other than its resources should be used generally to support national strategy. It was flexible and it was able to carry out both operational-tactical, and strategic bombing effectively. Flexibility was the ''Luftwaffe's'' strength in 1939-1941. Paradoxically, from that period onward it became its weakness. While Allied Air Forces were tied to the support of the Army, the ''Luftwaffe'' deployed its resources in a more general, operational way. It switched from [[air superiority]] missions, to medium-range interdiction, to strategic strikes, to close support duties depending on the need of the ground forces. In fact, far from it being a dedicated panzer spearhead arm, less than 15 percent of the Luftwaffe was designed for close support of the army in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley 1998, pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations and countermeasures ==
=== Environment ===
The concepts associated with the term blitzkrieg – deep penetrations by armor, large encirclements, and combined arms attacks – were largely dependent upon terrain and weather conditions. Where the ability for rapid movement across “tank country” was not possible, armored penetrations were often avoided or resulted in failure. Terrain would ideally be flat, firm, unobstructed by natural barriers or fortifications, and interspersed with roads and railways. If it was instead hilly, wooded, marshy, or urban, armour would be vulnerable to infantry in close-quarters combat and unable to break out at full speed. Additionally, units could be halted by mud ([[thaw (weather)|thawing]] along the Eastern Front regularly slowed both sides) or extreme snow. Armour, motorised and aerial support was also naturally dependent on weather.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2001, p. 602.&lt;/ref&gt;
It should however be noted that the disadvantages of such terrain could be nullified if surprise was achieved over the enemy by an attack through such terrain. During the Battle of France, the German blitzkrieg-style attack on France went through the Ardennes. There is little doubt that the hilly, heavily-wooded Ardennes could have been relatively easily defended by the Allies, even against the bulk of the German armored units. However, precisely because the French thought the Ardennes as unsuitable for massive troop movement, particularly for tanks, they were left with only light defences which were quickly overrun by the Wehrmacht. The Germans quickly advanced through the forest, knocking down the trees the French thought would impede this tactic.&lt;ref&gt;Frieser 2005, pp. 137-144.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air superiority ===
[[File:Hawker Typhoon ExCC.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A British designed single engine ground attack aircraft equipped with cannon and rockets|The [[Hawker Typhoon]] posed a serious threat to German armour and motor vehicles during the [[Battle of Normandy]] in 1944.]]
Allied [[air superiority]] became a significant hindrance to German operations during the later years of the war. Early German successes enjoyed air superiority with unencumbered movement of ground forces, close air support, and aerial reconnaissance. However, the Western Allies' air-to-ground aircraft were so greatly feared out of proportion to their actual tactical success, that following the lead up to Operation Overlord German vehicle crews showed reluctance to move en masse during daylight. Indeed, the final German blitzkrieg operation in the west, [[Operation Wacht am Rhein]], was planned to take place during poor weather which grounded Allied aircraft. Under these conditions however, it was difficult for German commanders to employ the “armored idea” to its envisioned potential.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1974, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Counter-tactics ===
Blitzkrieg is very vulnerable to an enemy that puts a great emphasis on [[anti-tank|anti-tank warfare]] and on anti-aircraft weaponry, especially if the side employing blitzkrieg is unprepared.
During the [[Battle of France]] in 1940, [[Charles de Gaulle|De Gaulle's]] [[4th Armoured Division (France)|4th Armoured Division]] and elements of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]]'s 1st Army Tank Brigade both made probing attacks on the German flank, actually pushing into the rear of the advancing armored columns at times. This may have been a reason for Hitler to call a halt to the German advance. Those attacks combined with [[Maxime Weygand]]'s [[Hedgehog tactic]] would become the major basis for responding to blitzkrieg attacks in the future: deployment in depth, permitting enemy forces to bypass defensive concentrations, reliance on anti-tank guns, strong force employment on the flanks of the enemy attack, followed by counter-attacks at the base to destroy the enemy advance in detail. Holding the flanks or “shoulders” of a penetration was essential to channeling the enemy attack, and artillery, properly employed at the shoulders, could take a heavy toll of attackers. While Allied forces in 1940 lacked the experience to successfully develop these strategies, resulting in France's capitulation with heavy losses, they characterized later Allied operations. For example, at the [[Battle of Kursk]] the [[Red Army]] employed a combination of defense in great depth, extensive minefields, and tenacious defense of breakthrough shoulders. In this way they depleted German combat power even as German forces advanced.&lt;ref&gt;Homes 2001, pp. 245-247.&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 1944 at Mortain, stout defense and counterattacks against the German flanks by American and Canadian forces closed the [[Falaise pocket]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2001, p. 293-294.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ardennes, a combination of hedgehog defense at [[Battle of Bastogne|Bastogne]], [[Battle of St. Vith|St Vith]] and other locations, and a counterattack by [[George S. Patton|Patton's]] [[Third United States Army|3rd U.S. Army]] were employed.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2001, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Logistics ===
Although effective in quick campaigns against Poland and France, mobile operations could not be sustained by Germany in later years. Strategies based on maneuver have the inherent danger of the attacking force overextending its [[supply line]]s, and can be defeated by a determined foe who is willing and able to sacrifice territory for time in which to regroup and rearm, as the Soviets did on the Eastern Front (as opposed to, for example, the Dutch who had no territory to sacrifice). Tank and vehicle production was a constant problem for Germany; indeed, late in the war many panzer &quot;divisions&quot; had no more than a few dozen tanks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Simpkin]], ''Race to the Swift: Thoughts on Twenty-First Century Warfare'', (London: Brassey's, 2000), p.34&lt;/ref&gt; As the end of the war approached, Germany also experienced critical shortages in [[fuel]] and [[ammunition]] stocks as a result of Anglo-American [[strategic bombing]] and blockade. Although production of ''Luftwaffe'' fighter aircraft continued, they would be unable to fly for lack of fuel. What fuel there was went to panzer divisions, and even then they were not able to operate normally. Of those [[Tiger I|Tiger]] tanks lost against the United States Army, nearly half of them were abandoned for lack of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Charles |last=Winchester |title=Advancing Backwards: The Demodernization of the German Army in World War 2 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |url=http://www.ospreypublishing.com/articles/world_war_2/demodernization_german_army_in_world_war_/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations==
=== Poland, 1939 ===
[[File:Poland2.jpg|thumb|right|350px|alt=A map of Poland showing the German invasion from east Germany, East Prussia and German-occupied Czechoslovakia in September 1939|In Poland, fast moving armies encircled Polish forces (blue circles), but the blitzkrieg idea never really took hold – artillery and infantry forces acted in time-honoured fashion to crush these pockets.]]

{{Main|Invasion of Poland}}

Despite the term blitzkrieg being coined by journalists during the Invasion of Poland of 1939, historians Mathew Cooper and J. P Harris generally hold that German operations during it were more consistent with more traditional methods. The Wehrmacht's strategy was more in line with ''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]n,'' or a focus on envelopment to create pockets in broad-front annihilation. Panzer forces were dispersed among the three German concentrations&lt;ref&gt;Harris 1995, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt; without strong emphasis on independent use, being used to create or destroy close pockets of [[Polish Army|Polish forces]] and seize operational-depth terrain in support of the largely un-motorized infantry which followed.

While early German tanks, Stuka dive-bombers and concentrated forces were used in the Polish campaign, the majority of the battle was conventional infantry and artillery based warfare and most Luftwaffe action was independent of the ground campaign. Matthew Cooper wrote that

{{quote|[t]hroughout the Polish Campaign, the employment of the mechanized units revealed the idea that they were intended solely to ease the advance and to support the activities of the infantry....Thus, any strategic exploitation of the armored idea was still-born. The paralysis of command and the breakdown of morale were not made the ultimate aim of the ... German ground and air forces, and were only incidental by-products of the traditional maneuvers of rapid encirclement and of the supporting activities of the flying artillery of the Luftwaffe, both of which had as their purpose the physical destruction of the enemy troops. Such was the ''Vernichtungsgedanke'' of the Polish campaign.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;Cooper, Matthew. ''The German Army 1939–1945: Its Political and Military Failure''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[John Ellis]] explained that “...there is considerable justice in Matthew Cooper's assertion that the panzer divisions were not given the kind of ''strategic'' mission that was to characterize authentic armored blitzkrieg, and were almost always closely subordinated to the various mass infantry armies.”&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, John. ''[[Brute Force (book)|Brute Force]]'' (Viking Penguin, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Zaloga]] states: “Whilst Western accounts of the September campaign have stressed the shock value of the panzers and Stuka attacks, they have tended to underestimate the punishing effect of German artillery on Polish units. Mobile and available in significant quantity, artillery shattered as many units as any other branch of the Wehrmacht.”&lt;ref&gt;Zaloga, Steven and Majej. ''The Polish Campaign 1939'' (Hippocrene Books, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western Europe, 1940 ===
[[File:16May-21May Battle of Belgium.PNG|thumb|350px|German advances during the Battle of Belgium]]

{{Main|Battle of the Netherlands|Battle of Belgium|Battle of France}}
The German invasion of France, with subsidiary attacks on [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], consisted of two phases, Operation Yellow  (''[[Fall Gelb]]'') and Operation Red (''[[Fall Rot]]''). Yellow opened with a feint conducted against the Netherlands and Belgium by two armored corps and [[paratrooper]]s. The Germans had massed the bulk of their armored force in Panzer Group von Kleist, which attacked through the comparatively unguarded sector of the [[Ardennes]] and achieved a breakthrough at the [[Battle of Sedan (1940)|Battle of Sedan]] with air support.&lt;ref&gt;Frieser 2005, pp. 145–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group raced to the coast of the [[English Channel]] at Abbeville, thus isolating the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]], [[Belgian Army]], and some divisions of the [[French Army]] in northern France. The armored and motorized units under Guderian and Rommel initially advanced far beyond the following divisions, and indeed far in excess of that with which German high command was initially comfortable. When the German motorized forces were met with a counterattack at [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Arras]], British tanks with heavy armour (Matilda I &amp; IIs) created a brief panic in the German High Command. The armored and motorized forces were halted, by Hitler, outside the port city of [[Dunkirk]], which was being used to evacuate the Allied forces. [[Hermann Göring]] had promised the Luftwaffe would complete the destruction of the encircled armies, but aerial operations did not prevent the evacuation of the majority of Allied troops (which the British named [[Operation Dynamo]]); some 330,000 French and British were saved.&lt;ref&gt;Frieser 2005, pp. 291–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, Yellow succeeded beyond what most people had expected, despite the fact that the Allies had 4,000 armored vehicles and the Germans 2,200, and the Allied tanks were often superior in armour and caliber of cannon.&lt;ref&gt;Guderian, Heinz; ''Panzer Leader'', p.94&lt;/ref&gt; The British used tanks in their pre-blitzkrieg 'traditional' role of assisting infantry and dispersed across the whole army so there was not concentration of tanks, while the blitzkrieg method of concentrating tanks, even less in number and less capable in ability, led to victorious success.

[[File:4June-12June Battle of France.PNG|thumb|350px|German advances during the Battle of France]]

This left the French armies much reduced in strength (although not demoralized), and without much of their own armour and heavy equipment. Operation Red then began with a triple-pronged panzer attack. The XV Panzer Corps attacked towards [[Brest, France|Brest]], XIV Panzer Corps attacked east of Paris, towards [[Lyon]], and Guderian's XIX Panzer Corps completed the encirclement of the [[Maginot Line]]. The defending forces were hard pressed to organize any sort of counter-attack. The French forces were continually ordered to form new lines along rivers, often arriving to find the German forces had already passed them. When Colonel de Gaulle did organize a counter-attack with superior French tanks, he did not have the air support to gain the upper hand and had to retreat.

Ultimately, the French army and nation collapsed after barely two months of mobile operations, in contrast to the four years of trench warfare of the First World War. The French president of the Ministerial Council, Reynaud, attributed the collapse in a speech on 21 May 1940:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The truth is that our classic conception of the conduct of war has come up against a new conception. At the basis of this...there is not only the massive use of heavy armored divisions or cooperation between them and airplanes, but the creation of disorder in the enemy's rear by means of parachute raids.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In actual fact, the German army had not used paratroop attacks in France. The one major paratrooper attack was used earlier in Holland to capture a bridge and a number of small-scale glider-landings were conducted in Belgium to capture terrain dominating bottle-necks on planned routes of advance prior to the arrival of the main ground forces (the most renowned being the landing on the Belgian border-fort of Eben-Emael). The real cause for the fall of France was the blitzkrieg method of warfare.

=== Soviet Union: the Eastern Front: 1941–44 ===
[[File:Defensive pincers in battle of Volkhov.png|thumb|right|250px|alt=Map depicting Allied breakthroughs of the German line. The German armour is held back and committed to seal the breakthrough|After 1941–42, armored formations were increasingly used as a mobile reserve against Allied breakthroughs. The black arrows depict armored counter-attacks.]]
Use of armored forces was crucial for both sides on the Eastern Front. [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1941, involved a number of breakthroughs and encirclements by motorized forces. Its stated goal was “to destroy the Russian forces deployed in the West and to prevent their escape into the wide-open spaces of Russia.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Clark]], ''Barbarossa: The Russian-German Conflict, 1941–45'', New York: Quill, 1965, p.78&lt;/ref&gt; A key factor was the surprise attack which included the near annihilation of the total Soviet airforce by simultaneous attacks on airfields. On the ground, four giant panzer armies encircled surprised and disorganized Soviet forces, followed by marching infantry which completed the encirclement and defeated the trapped forces. The first year of the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]] offensive can generally be considered to have had the last successful major mobile operation for the German army.

After Germany's failure to destroy the Soviets before the winter of 1941, the strategic failure above the German tactical superiority became apparent. Although the German invasion successfully conquered large areas of Soviet territory, the overall strategic effects were more limited. The Red Army was able to regroup far to the rear of the main battle line, and eventually defeat the German forces for the first time in the [[Battle of Moscow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Frieser 2005, p. 351.&quot;&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1942, when Germany launched another offensive in the southern [[USSR]] against [[Stalingrad]] and the [[Caucasus]], the Soviets again lost tremendous amounts of territory, only to counter-attack once more during winter. German gains were ultimately limited by [[Hitler]] diverting forces from the attack on Stalingrad itself and seeking to pursue a drive to the Caucasus oilfields simultaneously as opposed to subsequently as the original plan had envisaged. Even so, the ''Wehrmacht'' was becoming overstretched. By winning operationally, strategically it could not keep up the momentum as the superiority of the Soviet Union's industrial base and economy began to take effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frieser 2005, p. 351.&quot;&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1943 the ''Wehrmacht'' launched another combined forces offensive operation - ''Zitadelle'' (Citadel) - against the Soviet salient at [[Kursk]]. Soviet defensive tactics were by now hugely improved, particularly in terms of artillery and effective use of air support. All the same the [[Battle of Kursk]] was marked by the Soviet switch to offence and the use of the revived doctrine of deep operations. For the first time the blitzkrieg was defeated in summer and the opposing forces were able to mount their own, successful, counter operation.&lt;ref&gt;Glantz &amp; House 1995, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the summer of 1944 the reversal of fortune was complete and [[Operation Bagration]] saw Soviet forces inflict crushing defeats on Germany through the aggressive use of armour, infantry and air power in combined strategic assault, known as [[deep operations]].

=== Western Front, 1944–45 ===
As the war progressed, Allied armies began using combined arms formations and deep penetration strategies that Germany had used in the opening years of the war. Many Allied operations in the Western Desert and on the Eastern Front relied on massive concentrations of firepower to establish breakthroughs by fast-moving armored units. These artillery-based tactics were also decisive in Western Front operations after [[Operation Overlord]] and both the British Commonwealth and American armies developed flexible and powerful systems for utilizing artillery support. What the Soviets lacked in flexibility, they made up for in number of multiple rocket launchers, cannon and mortar tubes. The Germans never achieved the kind of fire concentrations their enemies were capable of by 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan 2005, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Allied landings at [[Normandy Landings|Normandy]], Germany made attempts to overwhelm the landing force with armored attacks, but these failed for lack of co-ordination and Allied air superiority. The most notable attempt to use deep penetration operations in Normandy was at [[Operation Luttich|Mortain]], which exacerbated the German position in the already-forming [[Falaise Pocket]] and assisted in the ultimate destruction of German forces in Normandy. The Mortain counter-attack was effectively destroyed by U.S. 12th Army Group with little effect on its own offensive operations.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan 2005, pp. 632-633.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany's last offensive on its Western front, [[Battle of the Bulge|Operation Wacht am Rhein]], was an offensive launched towards the vital port of [[Antwerp]] in December 1944. Launched in poor weather against a thinly-held Allied sector, it achieved surprise and initial success as Allied air power was stymied by cloud cover. However, stubborn pockets of defence in key locations throughout the Ardennes, the lack of serviceable roads, and poor German logistics planning caused delays. Allied forces deployed to the flanks of the German penetration, and as soon as the skies cleared, Allied aircraft were again able to attack motorized columns. The stubborn defense by US units and German weakness led to a defeat for the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2001, pp. 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The origins of blitzkrieg are in some doubt: if it existed, who contributed to it, whether it was part of German war strategy in 1933 - 1939.

There has been a great deal of debate about whether blitzkrieg existed as a coherent military strategy. Many historians now hold the position that blitzkrieg was not a military theory, and the campaigns conducted by the German military in 1939 to [[circa]], 1942 (with the exception of ''[[Operation Barbarossa]]'') were improvised invasions put together and modified at the last moment and therefore was not a proper military strategy.
In the past blitzkrieg has also been hailed as a [[Revolution in Military Affairs]] (RMA). In recent years a large number of writers and historians have come to the conclusion it was not a new form of warfare invented by the German military, but an old method of pursuing decisive battles using new technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citino 2005, p. 311&quot;&gt;Citino 2005, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategic intent===
There is disagreement on whether Germany had designed its war plans around blitzkrieg. The popular view can be summarized in an essay published in 1965, the then [[Captain (land)|Captain]] Robert O’Neill, Professor of the History of War at the [[Oxford University]]. Writing on ''Doctrine and Training in the German Army 1919–1939'', O’Neill stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What makes this story worth telling is the development of one idea: the blitzkrieg. The German Army had a greater grasp of the effects of technology on the battlefield, and went on to develop a new form of warfare by which its rivals when it came to the test were hopelessly outclassed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some historians were prepared to go even further, claiming that blitzkrieg was not merely an operational doctrine of the German armed forces but a strategic concept on which the leadership of the ''[[Third Reich]]'' based its strategic and economic planning.
Those who made the ''Third Reich’s'' military plans and organized its war economy appear rarely, if ever, to have employed the term blitzkrieg in official documents. The idea that the German army operated on a &quot;blitzkrieg doctrine&quot; was vigorously attacked in the late 1970s by [[Matthew Cooper]]. The concept of a blitzkrieg ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' was challenged by [[Richard Overy]] in the late 1970s and by Williamson Murray in the mid-1980s. The thesis that the ''Third Reich'' went to war on the basis of &quot;blitzkrieg economics&quot; was attacked by Richard Overy in the 1980s and Historian George Raudzens highlighted the many, somewhat conflicting, senses in which historians have used the word. Yet not only does the notion of a German blitzkrieg concept or doctrine survive in popular consciousness and popular literature, it persists with many professional historians. Academic monographs continue to appear which purport to explore the &quot;evolution&quot; or &quot;roots&quot; of blitzkrieg, (such as [[James Corum]]'s ''The Roots of Blitzkrieg: Hans von Seeckt and German Military Reform'').&lt;ref&gt;Harris 1995, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''The Blitzkrieg Legend'', German historian [[Karl-Heinz Frieser]] referred to the notion of 'Blitzkrieg' as &quot;a world wide delusion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt; Frieser, in agreement with Overy, Cooper and others that reject the existence of a blitzkrieg doctrine, argues that after the failure of the [[Schlieffen Plan]] in 1914, the German Army came to the conclusion decisive battles could not be executed on a strategic level. This meant the idea of one early large scale offensive could not bring about a knockout blow. Frieser argues that the OKW had intended to avoid the decisive battle concepts of its predecessors and planned for a long all out war of attrition. It was only after the hastily improvised plan for the invasion of Western Europe in 1940 and its successful conclusion, which led the German General Staff to believe that decisive battles were not obsolete. It was only after the [[Battle of France]] German thinking reverted to the possibility of a blitzkrieg method for the [[Balkan Campaign]] and ''[[Operation Barbarossa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 349 - 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctrine===

The position of some academic literature regards blitzkrieg as a myth. The notion that the Third ''Reich'' developed a blitzkrieg strategy to achieve its total aims has been widely attacked.

Historians [[Shimon Naveh]] and [[Richard Overy]] reject the idea that blitzkrieg was a military doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Naveh 1997, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Naveh states, &quot;The striking feature of the blitzkrieg concept is the complete absence of a coherent theory which should have served as the general cognitive basis for the actual conduct of operations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Naveh 1997, pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Naveh described it as an &quot;ad hoc solution&quot; to operational dangers, thrown together at the last moment.&lt;ref&gt;Naveh 1997, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Overy also rejected the idea that Hitler and the Nazi regime ever intended a blitzkrieg war. The suggestion that the German state intentionally streamlined its economy to carry out its grand strategy in a series of short campaigns in the near future was false.&lt;ref&gt;Overy 1995, pp. 233–234.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact Hitler intended to start an unlimited war, at a much later date than 1939. But the ''Third Reich's'' [[foreign policy]] had forced the Nazi state into war before it had fully prepared.&lt;ref&gt;Overy 1995, pp. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's, and the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'s'' planning attitudes during the 1930s do not reflect a blitzkrieg method, but the exact opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Overy 1995, pp. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian J. P Harris has pointed out that the Germans never used the word ''blitzkrieg''. It was never used in any German military field manual, either in the Army or the Air Force. It first appeared in September 1939, by a ''Times'' newspaper reporter. Harris also rejects that German military thinking developed any kind of blitzkrieg mentality.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 1995, pp. 333–336.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book the ''Blitzkrieg Legend'', German historian [[Karl-Heinz Frieser]] also shares [[Adam Tooze]]' (in his work ''[[The Wages of Destruction|The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Tooze 2006, pp. 371-373.&lt;/ref&gt; Overy's and Naveh's concerns over the myth of the blitzkrieg economic and strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Frieser 2005, pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover Frieser states that surviving German economists and members of the German General Staff have denied Germany went to war based on a blitzkrieg strategy.

===Economy===
The German armament industry did not fully mobilize until 1944, and this has led to some historians in the 1960s, particularly Alan Milward, to develop a theory of blitzkrieg economics. Milward argued the German Reich could not fight a long war, so it deliberately refrained from arming in depth, to arming in breadth, to enable it to win a series of quick victories. Milward alleged an economy positioned between a full war economy and a peacetime economy.&lt;ref&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris 1995, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Overy 1995, p. 260&quot;&gt;Overy 1995, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the blitzkrieg economic was to allow the German people to enjoy high living standards in the event of hostilities, and avoiding economic hardships suffered during the First World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Overy 1995, p. 260&quot;/&gt;

Overy states that blitzkrieg as a &quot;coherent military and economic concept has proven a difficult strategy to defend in light of the evidence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Overy 1995, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Milward's theory was completely contrary to Hitler's and German planners' intentions. It was their fear of the spectre of 1914 that emerged victorious in the conflict of goals between armament in breadth for a short war and armament in depth for a feared long war. The Germans were aware of the error of the First World War, and rejected the concept of orientating its economy geared to fighting only a short war. Hitler proclaimed to rely on surprise alone was &quot;criminal&quot;, and that &quot;we have to prepare for a long war along with surprise attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frieser 2005, p. 26&quot;&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the winter of 1939–40, Hitler decreased the size of the fighting manpower in order to return as many skilled workers to the factories as was possible. It was realised that the war would be decided in the factories, not a quick-decision &quot;Panzer operation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frieser 2005, p. 26&quot;&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1930s, Hitler had ordered rearmament program that cannot be considered limited.&lt;ref&gt;Overy 1995, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1937 Hitler had indicated that most of the armament projects would be completed by 1943–45.&lt;ref name=&quot;Overy 1995, p. 195&quot;&gt;Overy 1995, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The rearmament of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' was to have been completed in 1949, the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' rearmament program was to have been completed in 1942 with a force capable of carrying out [[strategic bombing]] using [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frieser 2005, p. 29&quot;&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction and training of motorised forces and a full mobilisation of the rail networks would not begin until 1943 and 1944 respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frieser 2005, p. 29&quot;&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
Hitler needed to avoid war until these projects were complete. Hitler's misjudgements in 1939 forced him into war before he was able to complete rearmament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Overy 1995, p. 195&quot;&gt;Overy 1995, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, [[Albert Speer]] pointed out that the German economy achieved greater armaments output, not because of diversions of capacity from civilian to military industry, but through streamlining of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Overy 1995, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Overy pointed out some 23 percent of German output was military by 1939. Between 1937-1939 70 percent of investment capital went into in rubber, synthetic fuel development, aircraft and ship building industries. Hermann Göring had consistently stated the task of the [[Four Year Plan]] was to rearm Germany for total war. Adolf Hitler's correspondence with his economists also reveals that his intent was to wage war in 1943-1945 when the resources of central Europe had been absorbed into the ''Third Reich''.&lt;ref&gt;Overy 1995, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

Living standards were not high in the late 1930s. Consumption of consumer goods had fallen from 71 percent in 1928 to 59 percent in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Overy 1995, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; The demands of the war economy reduced the amount of spending in non-military sectors to satisfy the demand for the armed forces. On 9 September the Head of the ''Reich Defence Council'', Goring called for complete &quot;employment&quot; of living and fighting power of the national economy for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Overy 1995, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; Overy presents this as evidence that a &quot;blitzkrieg economy&quot; did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Overy 1995, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Tooze]] supports Overy. Tooze explains that the German economy was planning for a long war. The expenditure for this war was extensive and put the economy under severe strain. The German leadership were concerned less with how to balance the civilian economy and the needs of civilian consumption, but rather to figure out how to best prepare the economy for total war.&lt;ref&gt;Tooze 2002, p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; Once war had begun, Hitler urged his economic experts to abandon caution and expend all available resources on the war effort. The expansion plans only gradually gained momentum in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Tooze 2002, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Tooze maintained the huge armament plans in the pre-war period did not indicate any clear sighted blitzkrieg economy or strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Tooze 2002, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heer===
There is the argument that the Heer (the German army) itself was not ready for blitzkrieg at the start of the war. The blitzkrieg method called for a young, highly skilled mechanized army. In 1939–40, 45 percent of the army was 40 years old, and 50 percent of all the soldiers had just a few weeks training.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frieser 2005, p. 29&quot;&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  The German Army, contrary to what the blitzkrieg legend suggests, was not fully motorised. The German Army could muster only 120,000 vehicles compared to the 300,000 of the [[French Army]]. The British also had an &quot;enviable&quot; contingent of motorised forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frieser 2005, p. 29&quot;&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, &quot;the image of the German 'Blitzkrieg' army is a figment of propaganda imagination&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frieser 2005, p. 29&quot;&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; During the First World War the German army used horses for logistics, 1.4 million of them, in the 1939–45 war it used 2.7 million horses. Moreover just 10 percent of the Army was motorised in 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frieser 2005, p. 29&quot;&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Half of the German divisions available in 1940 were combat ready,&lt;ref name=&quot;Frieser 2005, p. 29&quot;&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; often being more poorly equipped than the British and French Armies, as well as the German Army of 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frieser 2005, p. 30&quot;&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the spring, 1940, the German army was semi-modern.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frieser 2005, p. 30&quot;&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of the best equipped and &quot;elite divisions were offset by many second and third rate divisions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frieser 2005, p. 30&quot;&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the few motorised and Panzer Divisions, ninety percent of the German Army was not a blitzkrieg army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frieser 2005, p. 30&quot;&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued by John Mosier that, while the French soldiers in 1940 were better trained than German soldiers, as were the Americans later, and the German army was the least mechanized of the major armies, its leadership cadres were both larger and superior and their high standards of leadership were the primary reason for the successes of the German army in World War Two as it had been in World War One.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mosier 2003, pp. 284-288&quot;&gt;Mosier 2003, pp. 284-287.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luftwaffe doctrine===
[[James Corum]] states a prevalent myth about the ''Luftwaffe'' and its blitzkrieg operations is that it had a doctrine of [[terror bombing]], in which civilians were deliberately targeted in order to break the will or aid the collapse of an enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corum, James 2007&quot;&gt;Corum, James. ''The Luftwaffe: The Operational Air War, 1918–1940''. University of Kansas Press. 2007. ISBN 0-7006-0836-2&lt;/ref&gt; After the bombing of Guernica in 1937 and of Rotterdam in 1940, it was commonly assumed that terror bombing was a part of ''Luftwaffe'' doctrine. During the interwar period the ''Luftwaffe'' leadership rejected the concept of terror bombing, and confined the air arms use to battlefield support of [[interdiction]] operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corum, James 2007&quot; /&gt;
{{quote|The vital industries and transportation centers that would be targeted for shutdown were valid military targets. Civilians were not to be targeted directly, but the breakdown of production would affect their morale and will to fight. German legal scholars of the 1930s carefully worked out guidelines for what type of bombing was permissible under international law. While direct attacks against civilians were ruled out as &quot;terror bombing&quot;, the concept of the attacking the vital war industries- and probable heavy civilian casualties and breakdown of civilian morale-was ruled as acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;James Corum 1997, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Corum continues; [[General]] [[Walther Wever (general)|Walther Wever]] compiled a doctrine known as ''The Conduct of the Aerial War''. This document, which the ''Luftwaffe'' adopted,  rejected [[Giulio Douhet]]'s theory of terror bombing. Terror bombing was deemed to be &quot;counter-productive&quot;, increasing rather than destroying the enemies will to resist.&lt;ref&gt;Corum 1997, pp. 143–144.&lt;/ref&gt; Such bombing campaigns were regarded as diversion from the ''Luftwaffe's'' main operations; destruction of the enemy armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;Corum 1997, pp. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; The bombings of Guernica, Rotterdam and Warsaw were tactical missions in support of military operations and were not intended as strategic terror attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corum 1997, p. 7&quot;/&gt;

J.P. Harris states that most Luftwaffe leaders from Goering through the general staff believed as did their counterparts in Britain and the United States that strategic bombing was the chief mission of the air force and that given such a role, the Luftwaffe would win the next war and that:
{{quote|Nearly all lectures concerned the strategic uses of airpower; virtually none discussed tactical co-operation with the Army. Similarly in the military journals, emphasis centred on ’strategic’ bombing. The prestigious Militärwissenschaftliche Rundeschau, the War Ministry’s journal, which was founded in 1936, published a number of theoretical pieces on future developments in air warfare. Nearly all discussed the use of strategic airpower, some emphasising that aspect of air warfare to the exclusion of others. One author commented that European military powers were increasingly making the bomber force the heart of their airpower. The manoeuvrability and technical capability of the next generation of bombers would be ’as unstoppable as the flight of a shell.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 1995, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Luftwaffe did end up with an air force consisting mainly of relatively short-range aircraft, but this does not prove that the German air force was solely interested in ’tactical’ bombing. It happened because the German aircraft industry lacked the experience to build a long-range bomber fleet quickly, and because Hitler was insistent on the very rapid creation of a numerically large force. It is also significant that Germany’s position in the centre of Europe to a large extent obviated the need to make a clear distinction between bombers suitable only for ’tactical’ and those necessary for strategic purposes in the early stages of a likely future war.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 1995, pp. 346–347.&lt;/ref&gt;

===J.F.C. Fuller and B. H. Liddell Hart===
British theorists [[J.F.C. Fuller]] and Captain [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] have often been associated with the development of blitzkrieg, though this is a matter of controversy. In recent years historians have uncovered that Liddell Hart distorted and falsified facts to make it appear as if his ideas were adopted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Naveh 1997, p. 108&quot;&gt;Naveh 1997, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war Liddell Hart imposed his own perceptions, after the event, claiming that the mobile tank warfare practiced by the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' was a result of his influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Naveh 1997, p. 108&quot; /&gt; Blitzkrieg itself is not an official doctrine and historians in recent times have come to the conclusion it did not exist as such:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was the opposite of a doctrine. Blitzkrieg consisted of an avalanche of actions that were sorted out less by design and more by success. In hindsight—and with some help from Liddell Hart—this torrent of action was squeezed into something it never was: an operational design.&lt;ref&gt;Naveh 1997, pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paret 1986, p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By &quot;manipulation and contrivance, Liddell Hart distorted the actual circumstances of the blitzkrieg formation and he obscured its origins. Through his indoctrinated idealization of an ostentatious concept he reinforced the myth of blitzkrieg&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Naveh 1997, pp. 108–109&quot;&gt;Naveh 1997, pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; By imposing, retrospectively, his own perceptions of mobile warfare upon the shallow concept of blitzkrieg, he &quot;created a theoretical imbroglio that has taken 40 years to unravel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Naveh 1997, pp. 108–109&quot;/&gt; The early 1950s literature transformed blitzkrieg into a historical military doctrine, which carried the signature of Liddell Hart and [[Heinz Guderian]]. The main evidence of Liddell Hart's deceit and &quot;tendentious&quot; report of history can be found in his letters to the German Generals [[Erich von Manstein]] and Heinz Guderian, as well as relatives and associates of [[Erwin Rommel]]. Liddell Hart, in letters to Guderian, &quot;imposed his own fabricated version of blitzkrieg on the latter and compelled him to proclaim it as original formula&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Naveh 1997, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danchev 1998, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Kenneth Macksey]] found Liddell Hart's original letters to Guderian, in the General's papers, requesting that Guderian give him credit for &quot;impressing him&quot; with his ideas of armoured warfare. When Liddell Hart was questioned about this in 1968, and the discrepancy between the English and German editions of Guderian's memoirs, &quot;he gave a conveniently unhelpful though strictly truthful reply. ('There is nothing about the matter in my file of correspondence with Guderian himself except...that I thanked him...for what he said in that additional paragraph'.)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Danchev 1998, pp. 235–239.&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War I, Fuller had been a staff officer attached to the newly-developed tank force. He later developed plans for massive, independent tank operations, which he claimed was subsequently studied by the German military. It is variously argued that Fuller's wartime plans and post-war writings were an inspiration, or that his readership was low and German experiences during the war received more attention. The Germans' view of themselves as the losers of the war may be linked to the senior and experienced officers' undertaking a thorough review, studying, and rewriting of all their Army doctrine and training manuals. The UK's response was much weaker.&lt;ref&gt;Corum, James S. ''The Roots of Blitzkrieg: Hans von Seeckt and German Military Reform'', p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Fuller and Liddell Hart were &quot;outsiders&quot;: Liddell Hart was unable to serve as an active soldier because of ill-health, and Fuller's abrasive personality resulted in his premature retirement in 1933. Their views therefore had limited impact within the British Army's official hierarchy. The British War Office did permit the formation of an [[Experimental Mechanized Force]] on 1 May 1927, composed of tanks, lorried infantry, [[Birch gun|self propelled artillery]] and motorized engineers, but financial constraints prevented the experiment from being extended.

===Innovation===
It has been argued that blitzkrieg was not new. The Germans did not invent something called blitzkrieg in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citino 2005, p. 311&quot;&gt;Citino 2005, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frieser 2005, pp. 326–328.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather the German concept of wars of movement and concentrated force were seen in wars of [[Prussia]] and the [[Unification of Germany|German wars of unification]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Citino 2005, p. 311&quot;&gt;Citino 2005, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; The first European general to introduce rapid movement, concentrated power and integrated military effort was Swedish King Gustav II Adolfus during the 30 year war. The appearance of the aircraft and tank in the First World War, often hailed as a revolution in military affairs (RMA), offered the German military a chance to get back to the traditional war of movement as practiced by [[Moltke the Elder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Citino 2005, p. 311&quot;&gt;Citino 2005, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;
The so called &quot;blitzkrieg campaigns&quot; of 1939 – circa 1942, were well within that operational context.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citino 2005, p. 311&quot;&gt;Citino 2005, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of war, the German army had no radically new theory of war named Blitzkrieg or otherwise. The operational thinking of the German army had not changed significantly since the First World War or since the late 19th century. J. P. Harris and [[Robert M. Citino]] point out that the Germans had always had a marked preference for short, decisive campaigns – but were unable to achieve short-order victories in First World War conditions. The transformation from the stalemate of the First World War into tremendous initial operational and strategic success in the Second, was partly the employment of a relatively small number of mechanized divisions, most importantly the Panzer divisions, and the support of an exceptionally powerful [[air force]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris 1995, pp. 344–345.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guderian===
Generally Heinz Guderian is attributed as creating the military doctrine later described as blitzkrieg. Some have recently expressed doubt to how much the theory was his. Following Germany's military reforms of the 1920s, Heinz Guderian emerged as a strong proponent of mechanized forces. Within the Inspectorate of Transport Troops, Guderian and colleagues performed theoretical and field exercise work. Guderian claimed there was opposition from many officers who gave primacy to the infantry or simply doubted the usefulness of the tank. Among them, Guderian claimed, was Chief of the General Staff [[Ludwig Beck]] (1935–38), who he alleged was skeptical that armored forces could be decisive. This claim has been disputed by later historians. For example, [[James Corum]] stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Guderian expressed a hearty contempt for General Ludwig Beck, chief of the General Staff from 1935 to 1938, whom he characterized as hostile to ideas of modern mechanized warfare: [Corum quoting Guderian] &quot;He [Beck] was a paralyzing element wherever he appeared....[S]ignificantly of his way of thought was his much-boosted method of fighting which he called delaying defense&quot;. This is a crude caricature of a highly competent general who authored Army Regulation 300 (Troop Leadership) in 1933, the primary tactical manual of the German Army in World War II, and under whose direction the first three panzer divisions were created in 1935, the largest such force in the world of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Corum 1992, pp. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another misconception, enhanced by Guderian's own account, that he was the sole creater of German tactical and operational methodology is also misleading. Between 1922 and 1928 Guderian wrote very few articles of barely more than a page or two concerning military movement. Guderian's ''Achtung Panzer!'' (1937) relied heavily on other theorists such as Ludwig Ritter von Eimannsberger, whose major book, ''The Tank War'' (''Der Kampfwagenkrieg'') (1934) gained a wide audience in the German Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corum 1992, p. 139&quot;&gt;Corum 1992, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theorist, Ernst Volckheim, was also used by Guderian, and wrote a huge amount on tank and combined arms tactics, and is not acknowledged by Guderian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corum 1992, p. 139&quot; /&gt;

Guderian's leadership was supported, fostered and institutionalized by his supporters in the Reichswehr General Staff system, which worked the Army to greater and greater levels of capability through massive and systematic Movement Warfare war games in the 1930s.

Guderian argued that the tank was the decisive weapon of war. &quot;If the tanks succeed, then victory follows&quot;, he wrote. In an article addressed to critics of tank warfare, he wrote &quot;until our critics can produce some new and better method of making a successful land attack other than self-massacre, we shall continue to maintain our beliefs that tanks—properly employed, needless to say—are today the best means available for land attack.&quot; Addressing the faster rate at which defenders could reinforce an area than attackers could penetrate it during the First World War, Guderian wrote that &quot;since reserve forces will now be motorized, the building up of new defensive fronts is easier than it used to be; the chances of an offensive based on the timetable of artillery and infantry co-operation are, as a result, even slighter today than they were in the last war.&quot; He continued, &quot;We believe that by attacking with tanks we can achieve a higher rate of movement than has been hitherto obtainable, and—what is perhaps even more important—that we can keep moving once a breakthrough has been made.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guderian's remarks are from an unnamed article published in the National Union of German Officers, 15 October 1937 as quoted in ''Panzer Leader'', pp.39–46. Italics removed — the quoted sections are all italics in the original.&lt;/ref&gt; Guderian additionally required that tactical [[radio]]s be widely used to facilitate co-ordination and command by having one installed in all tanks.

'''''The Beano''''' is a British children's [[comic book|comic]], published by [[D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd|D.C. Thomson &amp; Co]] and is arguably their most successful.

The comic first appeared on 30 July 1938,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lollipopanimation.com/php/The_Beano_art.php&lt;/ref&gt; and was published weekly. During the [[Second World War]], ''The Beano'' and ''[[The Dandy]]'' were published on alternating weeks due to paper and ink [[rationing]]. D. C. Thomson's other publications also suffered, with the ''[[Oor Wullie]]'' and ''[[The Broons]]'' annuals falling victim to  paper and ink shortages. Paper and ink supplies were fully restored shortly after the end of hostilities and weekly publication of ''The Beano'' and ''The Dandy'' resumed in 1949. In September 2009, the Beano's 3,500th issue was published.&lt;ref&gt;http://forbiddenplanet.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/beano3500.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Beano'' is currently edited by [[Alan Digby]], who replaced Euan Kerr in summer 2006. Euan Kerr subsequently edited the ''[[BeanoMAX]]'', a version of the Beano for older readers. He has since left however, leaving Alan in charge of both [[comics]].

Its iconic characters such as [[Dennis the Menace (UK)|Dennis the Menace]], [[Roger the Dodger]], [[Minnie the Minx]], [[The Bash Street Kids]], [[Calamity James]], [[Ivy the Terrible]] and [[Billy Whizz]] have become known to generations of British children. Earlier generations will remember other notable characters which have been phased out, such as  [[Biffo the Bear]] and [[Big Eggo]]. Some old characters have made a return, like [[Lord Snooty]] and [[Little Plum]].

The comics were also distributed in some of Britain's colonies or former colonies. As they were sent by sea mail, they would go on sale some weeks after the date shown on the cover.

==Strips==
{{further|[[List of Beano comic strips]]}}
A number of strips in the comic have run for a very long time. The top five longest running Beano comic strips are, in ascending order, Dennis the Menace, Minnie the Minx, Bash Street Kids, Roger, the Dodger then the last holder of the title before Dennis, Lord Snooty.
Dennis the Menace's famous 'red and black' jersey had formed the colours of a few of the ''Beano'' characters' clothes (Minnie the Minx has the same although the placement of the stripes is a bit different, Ball Boy's the was a vertical red and black, Roger the Dodger has a chessboard design top and Danny (from the Bash Street Kids) has a similar cap) but the have changed for Minnie and Ball Boy (Minnie at one point had a red and yellow top and Ball Boy's strip now being black and blue).

There are frequent  [[fictional crossover]]s between ''Beano'' characters, with most of the characters living in the [[fictional]] [[Beanotown]]. Many of the comic strips in ''The Dandy'' are drawn by the same artists, and crossovers between the two comics also occur occasionally. Quite often, one comic will make a tongue-in-cheek jibe at the other (e.g., a character meeting an elderly lady, and stating that she's &quot;older than the jokes in ''The Dandy''&quot;). In the strips, it is expressed that the two towns are rivals with each other and before ''The Dandy'' did a drastic format change they had an embassy in Beanotown which many of the town's citizens attempted to overrun, but failed (the embassy had no existence in ''The Beano''). This rivalry inspired the spin-off computer game ''[[Beanotown Racing]]'', in which various characters from both comics could be raced around points in Beanotown, including the Embassy. The game was given a large amount of advance publicity in the comics, with story lines often revolving how the characters each acquired his/her vehicle.

The [[Bash Street Kids]] Adventures written and drawn by [[Kev F Sutherland]] since 2004 have featured parodies of famous comic strip images, including [[Amazing Fantasy]]'s first [[Spider-Man]] cover, [[Action Comics]]' first [[Superman]] cover, and most recently the cover of [[X Men]] #100. Sutherland created the rival schools to Bash Street, Posh Street and St Asbo's. He also revived old characters from the archives including [[Biffo the Bear]], [[The Dandy#Dandy Characters|Keyhole Kate]], [[Pansy Potter]] The Strongman's Daughter, and [[Topper (comics)#Strips|Desert Island Dick]].

==History==

In 1921, D. C. Thomson had first entered the field of boys' story papers with ''[[Adventure (D.C. Thomson)|Adventure]]''. The success of this paper led to five further publications, ''[[The Rover (comics)|The Rover]]'' and ''[[The Wizard (comic)|The Wizard]]'' in 1922, ''[[The Vanguard (comic)|The Vanguard]]'' in 1924, ''[[Skipper (comic)|The Skipper]]'' in 1930 and ''[[Hotspur (comic)|The Hotspur]]'' in 1933. Although ''The Vanguard'' folded in 1926, the others were a great triumph and became known as &quot;The Big Five&quot;; they ended Amalgamated Press's near-monopoly of the British comic industry.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McAleer, ''Popular Reading and Publishing in Britain 1914–1950'', Oxford: Clarendon, 1992, ISBN 0-19-820329-2, pp. 167-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another success was the ''Fun Section'' of D. C. Thomson's Scottish weekly newspaper ''[[The Sunday Post]]'', which included the two strips [[Oor Wullie]] and [[The Broons]] by lead artist [[Dudley Watkins]], as well as other funnies and various puzzles and adventure stories. This gave R. D. Low, the head of children's publications at D. C. Thomson at the time, the idea to create another Big Five, this time of comics intended for both boys and girls and consisting mainly of 'funnies' and more lighthearted adventure and text stories.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Brown, ''The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature'' volume 3: ''Modern transformations: New Identities (from 1918)'', Edinburgh University Press, 2007, ISBN 978-0-7486-2482-9, [http://books.google.com/books?id=mP2kap9YfK4C&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=R.+D.+Low+Beano+Dandy+Magic&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LSNRTNvOM4fGsAO1pdC2AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=In%201935%2C%20managing%20editor%20RD%20Low%20informed%20comic%20artist%20Dudley%20Watkins%20that%20he%20planned%20to%20introduce%20two%20new&amp;f=false p. 205].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these publications, ''The Dandy'', commenced in 1937 and was followed by ''The Beano'' on 26 July 1938. A third paper, ''[[The Magic Comic]]'', aimed at a slightly younger audience, followed in July 1939, but ceased publication in early 1941, due to paper rationing. Wartime shortages also prevented the New Big Five project from being completed.

''The Beano'' comic takes its name from the [[English language|English]] word ''beano'' which can be loosely interpreted as ''a good time''.&lt;ref&gt;For further discussion of the origin of this word, see [http://www.bicycle-beano.co.uk/beano.html The Meaning Of Beano]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of ''The Beano'' was dated 30 July 1938,&lt;ref name=issuedates&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/britishcomics/comics.html Issue dates of British comics], page retrieved 30 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the 3000th issue was published in January 2000.&lt;ref name=guardian1&gt;Mark Oliver, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,451808,00.html &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;], ''The Guardian'', Wednesday 14 March 2001, retrieved 30 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There are only 12 known copies of the first issue in existence, and only 5 known copies of the second issue (not including facsimiles).  The first issue's cover could be found on the back of issue 2000.

A copy of this first issue sold for £12,100 on 16 March 2004, which was at the time thought to be the highest price ever paid for a British comic at an [[auction]].&lt;ref name=firstissueprice&gt;[http://www.ibooknet.co.uk/archive/news_april04.htm#£12,000 £12,000 Record Beano], page retrieved 30 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The current highest price is £20,350,&lt;ref name=highestsaleprice&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3638160.stm &quot;Dandy comic sold for record price&quot;], page retrieved 05 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; which was paid for the first issue of ''The Dandy'' on 7 September 2004. ''The Beano'' is now the longest-running weekly comic, since ''The Dandy'' became a fortnightly comic in 2007.

''The Beano'' is so popular that it had its own section of the [[Chessington World of Adventures]] theme park, &quot;Beanoland&quot;. This opened in 2000 and survived for a [[decade]] before sponsorship was eventually lost. Most of the major Beanoland attractions remain in operation today but have been rethemed as &quot;Wild Asia&quot;.

===Editors===
The original editor was George Moonie, 1938–1959, followed by Harold Cramond, 1959-84. Euan Kerr was editor from 1984 until he handed over to Alan Digby in early 2006. Alan had been ''Beano'' Chief Sub Editor when Euan first became editor, and later edited ''[[Beezer|The Beezer]]''.  Euan has returned to edit ''BeanoMAX'' as of issue 2 (see below). Following the retirement of Euan Kerr, Alan Digby is now Editor-in-Chief of both titles.

Recently, (28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; February 2011) there has been news that Digby has retired leaving [[Michael Stirling]] as the new editor of the Beano.

==Spin-off Comics==
===Comic Libraries===
{{Main|Fun Size Comics}}
Since 1982 the comic, along with ''The Dandy'', has also run &quot;Comic Library&quot; titles. Released monthly, these titles are a feature length (usually about 64 page) adventure, featuring a character from the comic itself. They are available in A5 size only. In 1998, these were replaced by the ''[[Fun Size Comics|Fun Size Beano]]''. Fun Size Comics were discontinued in late 2010.

===Beano Specials===
The comic also ran A4-sized [[Beano Specials]] in the early 1990s, which later were renamed [[Beano Superstars]]. These were similar to the Comic Library series. The last few issues were printed versions of episodes from the 1996-1998 [[Dennis the Menace &amp; Gnasher (1996 TV series)|Dennis and Gnasher animated TV series]].
A ''Beano Poster Comic'' series was also printed in the early 1990s.

The Beano Specials returned in 2003, and were now published seasonally. The issues were numbered, and the first one was a Dennis and Friends special, the last a Christmas reprint special. These were replaced by BeanoMAX in early 2007.

===BeanoMAX===
{{Main|BeanoMAX}}
On 15 February 2007, the first issue of a monthly comic entitled BeanoMAX was published. The sister comic features many of the same characters, however the stories in BeanoMAX are written in a longer format meant for 10-13 year olds. The first issue was a [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] special featuring assorted [[celebrity]] guests.

===Plug===
{{main|Plug (comics)}}

''Plug'' was a comic based on the eponymous character from [[The Bash Street Kids]] that began with issue dated 24 September 1977, and is notable for being the first comic to make use of [[rotogravure]] printing. The magazine similar in style to I.P.C's ''Krazy'' which had started the previous year. It contained uncharacteristically outlandish material for D C. Thomson, as well as later including celebrity appearances in the comic.

The comic revealed Plug's full name to be Percival Proudfoot Plugsley and also gave him a pet monkey by the name of Chumkee. Plug's strip was mostly drawn by [[Vic Neill]] but other artists, including [[Dave Gudgeon]] drew some later strips. Other strips included ''Antchester United'', ''Violent Elizabeth'', ''Eebagoom'', ''Hugh's Zoo'' and ''D'ye Ken John Squeal and his Hopeless Hounds''.

The venture was unsuccessful, in part because the comic cost 9p, with the ''Beano'' at the time only costing 4p and most of its rivals priced similarly. It merged with ''[[The Beezer]]'' on 24 February 1979.

===Dennis and Gnasher===
The brand new ''Dennis and Gnasher'' was launched separately from ''The Beano'' in September 2009.

Dennis and Gnasher got their own TV series on [[CBBC]] from 7 September 2009 to accompany the comic's new look. This was their second, having also had one in 1996, which ran for two series on CBBC, [[The Children's Channel]], and [[Fox Kids]].

Dennis and Gnasher were presenting their own radio show on [[Fun Kids]] from 5 September 2009.

==Revamps==
The ''Beano'''s first major revamp was in the 50th birthday issue of 1988, when the page number was increased, the comic had a wider paper style, and more colour was used throughout.

Another occurred in 1993, when the whole comic was now printed in full colour, along with some new strips such as the Numskulls, which had been moved from ''The Beezer''.

No major revamps happened from then until 1998, when Dennis' baby sister Bea was born. The logo was rounded and embossed (but later flattened in February 1999), and there were 8 extra pages. Computers were starting to be used for articles and speech bubbles, rather than the usual hand drawn ones.

Since April 2007, ''The Beano'' has had five revamps to help it keep up to date.&lt;br&gt;
The first occurred on 7 April 2007. The logo was made to appear to be jumping out, and was embossed using [[Photoshop]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. The website address was looped inside the &quot;O&quot;. This logo had been used in the Beano Club for one issue in 2006.

Also in this issue, there was a record number of uncredited [[reprints]], with the likes of [[Ivy the Terrible]], [[Calamity James]], [[Les Pretend]], [[The Riot Squad (Beano)|The Riot Squad]] and [[Fred's Bed]] now being reprinted. In certain areas of the UK, such as [[Lancashire]], the price was increased to 99p, while elsewhere it remained as 85p.

The second happened on 27 October. The logo was still Photoshop-embossed, but was now back to the rounded style which it had from 1999 to 2006. It was quite similar to the original rounded logo from 1998, which was flattened the following year.&lt;br&gt;
The number of reprint pages was cut from 4 to 2, but more started to appear after about a month. Two new strips were also added, [[Johnny Bean from Happy Bunny Green]] and [[London B412]]. The price increased to 99p across the whole UK.

The third was the least major revamp. The background was changed from one colour behind the logo and another behind the Dennis strip to one single colour or a pattern, such as red and black stripes. New fonts were being used on the front cover, and the &quot;Pocket money price&quot; logo had been changed to a large &quot;WOW! 99p&quot; which was usually placed in the top corners. No new strips were added this time, but the amount of reprints went up to 5, sometimes lowering back to 4 per week, and an extra [[Dennis the Menace (UK)|Dennis]] strip was added on the inside back two pages.

The fourth revamp, which happened with the issue dated 18 October 2008 had been the most major revamp to date. There was a return of [[Billy the Cat and Katie|Billy the Cat]] inside, as well as a new [[Super School]] strip by [[Lew Stringer]]. The price rose to £1.25 per issue. Different characters appear on the 'O' each week in a cleaner tidier embossed logo. New headline fonts were introduced (CCZoinks), the balloon font was also changed to Cloudsplitter by [[Blambot]]. But the main change was the paper style, which had finally changed from [[newsprint]] to a [[gloss]], much in the style of the inside pages of companion papers [[Dandy Xtreme]] and [[BeanoMAX]]. The only difference between these paper styles is the front cover, which is thicker on the Dandy Xtreme and BeanoMAX, but the same as the pages throughout in the weekly Beano.

Now printed by BGP, The Beano is now in an A4 format. A mild revision of style accompanies this with balloon font changed to CCTimeSaleLower, an upper and lower case font and a much larger Beano logo on the cover. The font CCZoinks appears to have less prominence with CreativeBlockBold taking centre stage. The Beano Club has now been changed to Beano VIP with a more online presence. The paper is still glossy, but the paper stock gives it a matt feel. A mass improvement on previous paper stock.

==Gnashional Menace Day and the 70th birthday==
As a celebration, in partnership with the [[CLIC Sargent]] charity, 2 August 2008 was Gnashional Menace Day, where children were sponsored to behave like Dennis. The anniversary was also celebrated with a 40-page issue (instead of 32 pages; the 60th birthday issue also had extra pages, 48 instead of 24) guest edited by [[Wallace and Gromit]] creator [[Nick Park]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jul/21/pressandpublishing.animation Gromit creator revels in having a bash at the Beano], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 21 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; price £1.50 [http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1492902.ece] (not 99p: this has also happened to The Dandy on one occasion, see [[Dandy Xtreme#One_issue_price_hikes_and_confusions|here]]) and an issue of [[Classics from the Comics]] devoted to the Beano. There is also a special 64-page book available, ''The Beano Special Collectors Edition: 70 Years of Fun'', giving a brief history of the comic. In the Beano's home city of Dundee, a special exhibition was held at the [[University of Dundee]] featuring original artwork and other memorabilia loaned from D.C. Thomson - it ran until 20 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dundee.ac.uk/museum/beano.htm happy Birthday Beano!], the University of Dundee Museum Collections&lt;/ref&gt; In London the Cartoon Museum showed the exhibition ''Beano and Dandy Birthday Bash!'' from 30 July to 2 November 2008, featuring original artwork from all eight decades of both 'The Beano' and 'The Dandy', including work by [[Dudley D. Watkins]], David Law, [[Leo Baxendale]] and Ken Reid as well as David Sutherland and many contemporary artists. There were events for children throughout August.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartoonmuseum.org Cartoon Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bees''' are flying [[insect]]s closely related to [[wasp]]s and [[ant]]s, and are known for their role in [[pollination]] and for producing [[honey]] and [[beeswax]]. Bees are a [[monophyly|monophyletic]] lineage within the superfamily '''[[Apoidea]]''', presently classified by the unranked taxon name '''Anthophila'''. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven to nine recognized families,&lt;ref name=&quot;Danforthetal2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Danforth BN, Sipes S, Fang J, Brady SG |title=The history of early bee diversification based on five genes plus morphology |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=103 |issue=41 |pages=15118–23 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17015826 |pmc=1586180 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0604033103 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though many are undescribed and the actual number is probably higher.  They are found on every continent except [[Antarctica]], in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated [[flowering plant]]s.

Bees are adapted for feeding on [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] and [[pollen]], the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for [[protein]] and other nutrients.  Most pollen is used as food for [[larva]]e.

Bees have a long [[proboscis]] (a complex &quot;tongue&quot;) that enables them to obtain the nectar from [[flower]]s. They have [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] almost universally made up of 13 segments in males and 12 in females, as is typical for the superfamily. Bees all have two pairs of [[insect wing|wings]], the hind pair being the smaller of the two; in a very few species, one sex or caste has relatively short wings that make flight difficult or impossible, but none are wingless.

The smallest bee is ''Trigona minima'', a [[stingless bee]] whose workers are about 2.1&amp;nbsp;mm (5/64&quot;) long. The largest bee in the world is ''[[Megachile pluto]]'', a [[leafcutter bee]] whose females can attain a length of 39&amp;nbsp;mm (1.5&quot;). Members of the family [[Halictidae]], or sweat bees, are the most common type of bee in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], though they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies.

The best-known bee species is the [[European honey bee]], which, as its name suggests, produces [[honey]], as do a few other types of bee. Human management of this species is known as [[beekeeping]] or apiculture.

Bees are the favorite meal of ''Merops apiaster'', the [[bee-eater|bee-eater bird]]. Other common predators are [[kingbird]]s, [[mockingbird]]s, [[beewolf|beewolves]], and [[dragonfly|dragonflies]].

== Pollination ==
{{see also|List of crop plants pollinated by bees}}

Bees play an important role in [[pollination|pollinating]] [[flowering plant]]s, and are the major type of [[pollinator]] in [[ecosystem]]s that contain flowering plants. Bees either focus on gathering nectar or on gathering pollen depending on demand, especially in social species. Bees gathering nectar may accomplish pollination, but bees that are deliberately gathering pollen are more efficient pollinators. It is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on insect pollination, most of which is accomplished by bees, especially the domesticated [[European honey bee]]. [[pollination management|Contract pollination]] has overtaken the role of honey production for [[beekeeper]]s in many countries. [[Monoculture]] and the massive [[pollinator decline|decline]] of many bee species (both wild and domesticated) have increasingly caused honey bee keepers to become [[Seasonal human migration|migratory]] so that bees can be concentrated in seasonally varying high-demand areas of pollination.

[[File:Bees Collecting Pollen 2004-08-14.jpg|250px|right|thumb|upright|[[Honey bee]] (''[[Apis mellifera]]'') collecting pollen]]

Most bees are fuzzy and carry an [[electrostatic]] charge, which aids in the adherence of pollen. Female bees periodically stop foraging and groom themselves to pack the pollen into the [[scopa (biology)|scopa]], which is on the legs in most bees, and on the ventral [[abdomen]] on others, and modified into specialized [[pollen basket]]s on the legs of honey bees and their relatives. Many bees are opportunistic foragers, and will gather pollen from a variety of plants, while others are [[oligolectic]], gathering pollen from only one or a few types of plant. A small number of plants produce nutritious floral oils rather than pollen, which are gathered and used by oligolectic bees. One small subgroup of [[stingless bee]]s, called &quot;[[vulture bee]]s,&quot; is specialized to feed on [[carrion]], and these are the only bees that do not use plant products as food. Pollen and nectar are usually combined together to form a &quot;provision mass&quot;, which is often soupy, but can be firm. It is formed into various shapes (typically [[spheroid]]), and stored in a small chamber (a &quot;cell&quot;), with the egg deposited on the mass. The cell is typically sealed after the egg is laid, and the adult and larva never interact directly (a system called &quot;[[mass provisioning]]&quot;).

In [[New Zealand]] scientists discovered that three genera of native bees have evolved to open flower buds of the native mistletoe ''Peraxilla tetrapetala''. The buds cannot open themselves but are visited by birds such as the [[Tui (bird)|tui]] and [[New Zealand Bellbird|bellbird]] which twist the top of the ripe bud. That action releases a mechanism which causes the petals to suddenly spring open, giving access to the nectar and pollen. However, when observing the native bees in the [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] province in the [[South Island]], the scientists were astonished to see the bees biting the top off the buds, then pushing with their legs, occasionally popping open the buds to allow the bees to harvest the nectar and pollen, and therefore aid in the pollination of the mistletoe which is in decline in New Zealand. Nowhere else in the world have bees demonstrated ability to open explosive bird-adapted flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nzsm.spis.co.nz/article1699.htm|publisher=New Zealand Science Monthly|title=Native Bees With New Tricks|accessdate=16 June 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visiting flowers can be a dangerous occupation.  Many [[assassin bug]]s and [[crab spider]]s hide in flowers to capture unwary bees.  Other bees are lost to birds in flight. [[Insecticide]]s used on blooming plants kill many bees, both by direct poisoning and by contamination of their food supply.  A honey bee [[queen bee|queen]] may lay 2000 eggs per day during spring buildup, but she also must lay 1000 to 1500 eggs per day during the foraging season, mostly to replace daily casualties, most of which are workers dying of old age.  Among solitary and primitively social bees, however, lifetime reproduction is among the lowest of all insects, as it is common for females of such species to produce fewer than 25 offspring.

The population value of bees depends partly on the individual efficiency of the bees, but also on the population itself. Thus while [[bumblebee]]s have been found to be about ten times more efficient pollinators on [[cucurbitaceae|cucurbits]], the total efficiency of a colony of honey bees is much greater due to greater numbers.  Likewise during early spring orchard blossoms, bumblebee populations are limited to only a few queens, and thus are not significant pollinators of early fruit.

=== Pollinator decline ===

[[File:HoneyBeeAnatomy.png|thumb|left|[[Morphology (biology)|Morphology]] of a female [[honey bee]]]]

From 1972 to 2006, there was a dramatic reduction in the number of [[feral]] honey bees in the US, which are now almost absent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watanabe&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author = Watanabe, M.|title = Pollination worries rise as honey bees decline|journal = Science|volume = 265|issue = 5176|page = 1170|year = 1994|doi =10.1126/science.265.5176.1170|pmid=17787573}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time there was a significant though somewhat gradual decline in the number of colonies maintained by beekeepers. This decline includes the cumulative losses from all factors, such as [[urbanization]], pesticide use, [[Acarapis woodi|tracheal]] and ''[[Varroa]]'' mites, and commercial [[beekeeper]]s' retiring and going out of business. However, in late 2006 and early 2007 the rate of attrition reached new proportions, and the term [[colony collapse disorder]] was coined to describe the sudden disappearances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Penn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = Honey Bee Die-Off Alarms Beekeepers, Crop Growers and Researchers|url = http://www.aginfo.psu.edu/News/07Jan/HoneyBees.htm|publisher = Pennsylvania State University College of Agricultural Sciences|date = 2007-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After several years of research and concern, a team of scientists headed by Jerry Bromenshenk published a paper in October 2010 saying that a new DNA-based virus, invertebrate iridescent virus or IIV6, and the fungus ''[[Nosema ceranae]]'' were found in every killed colony the group studied. In their study they found that neither agent alone seemed deadly, but a combination of the virus and ''Nosema ceraneae'' was always 100% fatal. Bromenshenk said it is not yet clear whether one condition weakens the bees enough to be finished off by the second, or whether they somehow compound the other’s destructive power. &quot;They're co-factors, that’s all we can say at the moment. They’re both present in all these collapsed colonies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/science/07bees.html &quot;Scientists and Soldiers Solve a Bee Mystery&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2010/10/08/news/honey_bees_ny_times.fortune/index.htm &quot;What a scientist didn't tell the New York Times about his study on bee deaths&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013181 | title=Iridovirus and Microsporidian Linked to Honey Bee Colony Decline | author=Jerry J.

Apart from colony collapse disorder, many of the losses outside the US have also been attributed to other causes. Pesticides used to treat seeds, such as [[Clothianidin]] and [[Imidacloprid]], have been considered prime suspects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bvl.bund.de/cln_027/nn_494194/sid_21CE29DF5AC1275D84F229CF48887965/DE/08__PresseInfothek/01__InfosFuerPresse/01__PI__und__HGI/PSM/2008/PI__BVL__verpflichtet__Bayer__zu_20Poncho__monitoring.html__nnn=true German Consumer Protection Agency Bulletin] June 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other species of bees such as [[mason bee]]s are increasingly cultured and used to meet the agricultural pollination need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gardening.wsu.edu/library/inse006/inse006.htm Mason bee from Everything.About]. Retrieved 10 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Native pollinators include bumblebees and solitary bees, which often survive in refuges in wild areas away from agricultural spraying, but may still be poisoned in massive spray programs for [[mosquito]]es, [[gypsy moth]]s, or other insect [[Pest (animal)|pests]]. Although pesticide use remains a concern, the major problem for wild pollinator populations is the loss of the flower-rich habitat on which they depend for food. Throughout the northern hemisphere, the last 70 or so years have seen an intensification of agricultural systems, which has decreased the abundance and diversity of [[Wildflower|wild flowers]].

Legislation such as the UK's [[Bees Act 1980]] is designed to stop the decline of bees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Bees+Act&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1507973&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1507973&amp;filesize=17676 |title=Statute Law UK |accessdate=2009-01-20 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=1980 |month=March |work= |publisher=Crown Copyright |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution ==

Bees, like [[ants]], are a specialized form of [[wasp]]. The ancestors of bees were wasps in the family [[Crabronidae]], and therefore [[predator]]s of other insects. The switch from insect prey to pollen may have resulted from the consumption of prey insects which were flower visitors and were partially covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larvae. This same [[evolution]]ary scenario has also occurred within the [[vespoidea|vespoid]] wasps, where the group known as &quot;[[pollen wasp]]s&quot; also evolved from predatory ancestors. Up until recently, the oldest non-compression bee fossil had been ''Cretotrigona prisca'' in New Jersey amber and of [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous age]], a [[Meliponini|meliponine]]. A recently reported bee fossil, of the genus ''[[Melittosphex]]'', is considered ''&quot;an extinct lineage of pollen-collecting Apoidea [[Cladistics|sister]] to the modern bees&quot;'', and dates from the [[early Cretaceous]] (~100 mya).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poinar GO, Danforth BN |title=A fossil bee from Early Cretaceous Burmese amber |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5799 |page=614 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17068254 |doi=10.1126/science.1134103 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derived features of its morphology ([[apomorphy|&quot;apomorphies&quot;]]) place it clearly within the bees, but it retains two unmodified ancestral traits ([[plesiomorphy|&quot;plesiomorphies&quot;]]) of the legs (two mid-tibial spurs, and a slender hind basitarsus), indicative of its transitional status.

The earliest animal-pollinated flowers were pollinated by insects such as [[beetle]]s, so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established before bees first appeared. The novelty is that bees are ''specialized'' as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination, and are generally more efficient at the task than any other pollinating insect such as beetles, [[fly|flies]], [[butterfly|butterflies]] and pollen wasps. The appearance of such floral specialists is believed to have driven the [[adaptive radiation]] of the [[angiosperm]]s, and, in turn, the bees themselves.

Among living bee groups, the &quot;short-tongued&quot; bee family [[Colletidae]] has traditionally been considered the most &quot;primitive&quot;, and [[Cladistics|sister taxon]] to the remainder of the bees. In the 21st century, however, some researchers have claimed that the [[Dasypodaidae]] is the basal group, the short, wasp-like [[Insect mouthparts|mouthparts]] of colletids being the result of [[convergent evolution]], rather than indicative of a [[plesiomorphy|plesiomorphic]] condition.&lt;ref name=Danforthetal2006/&gt; This subject is still under debate, and the phylogenetic relationships among bee families are poorly understood.

== Eusocial and semisocial bees ==

[[File:Bee swarm on fallen tree03.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[honey bee]] swarm]]

Bees may be solitary or may live in various types of communities. The most advanced of these are [[eusocial]] colonies&lt;ref name=&quot;pnas3054932&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Engel|first=Michael S.|date=2001-02-13|title=Monophyly and Extensive Extinction of Advanced Eusocial Bees: Insights from an Unexpected Eocene Diversity|journal=PNAS|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|volume=98|issue=4|pages=1661–1664|doi=10.1073/pnas.041600198|pmid=11172007|pmc=29313|jstor=3054932}}&lt;/ref&gt; found among the honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees. Sociality, of several different types, is believed to have evolved separately many times within the bees.

In some species, groups of cohabiting females may be sisters, and if there is a [[Division of labour|division of labor]] within the group, then they are considered [[semisocial]].

If, in addition to a division of labor, the group consists of a mother and her daughters, then the group is called eusocial. The mother is considered the &quot;queen&quot; and the daughters are &quot;workers&quot;.  These castes may be purely behavioral alternatives, in which case the system is considered &quot;primitively eusocial&quot; (similar to many [[paper wasp]]s), and if the castes are morphologically discrete, then the system is &quot;highly eusocial&quot;.

There are many more species of primitively eusocial bees than highly eusocial bees, but they have rarely been studied. The biology of most such species is almost completely unknown. The vast majority are in the family [[Halictidae]], or &quot;sweat bees&quot;. Colonies are typically small, with a dozen or fewer workers, on average. The only physical difference between queens and workers is average size, if they differ at all. Most species have a single season colony cycle, even in the tropics, and only mated females (future queens, or &quot;gynes&quot;) hibernate (called [[diapause]]). A few species have long active seasons and attain colony sizes in the hundreds. The [[orchid bee]]s include a number of primitively eusocial species with similar biology. Certain species of [[Allodapini|allodapine]] bees (relatives of [[carpenter bee]]s) also have primitively eusocial colonies, with unusual levels of interaction between the adult bees and the developing brood. This is &quot;[[progressive provisioning]]&quot;; a larva's food is supplied gradually as it develops. This system is also seen in honey bees and some bumblebees.

Highly eusocial bees live in colonies. Each colony has a single [[Queen (bee)|queen]], many [[worker bee|workers]] and, at certain stages in the colony cycle, [[drone (bee)|drones]]. When humans provide the nest, it is called a [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]. Honey bee hives can contain up to 40,000 bees at their annual peak, which occurs in the spring, but usually have fewer.

=== Bumblebees ===
{{Main|Bumblebee}}

[[Bumblebee]]s (''Bombus terrestris'', ''Bombus pratorum'', et al.) are eusocial in a manner quite similar to the eusocial [[Vespidae]] such as [[hornet]]s. The queen initiates a nest on her own (unlike queens of honey bees and stingless bees which start nests via [[swarm]]s in the company of a large worker force). Bumblebee colonies typically have from 50 to 200 bees at peak population, which occurs in mid to late summer. Nest architecture is simple, limited by the size of the nest cavity (pre-existing), and colonies are rarely [[wiktionary:perennial|perennial]]. Bumblebee queens sometimes seek winter safety in honey bee hives, where they are sometimes found dead in the spring by [[beekeeper]]s, presumably stung to death by the honey bees. It is unknown whether any survive winter in such an environment.

Bumblebees are one of the more important wild pollinators, but have declined significantly in recent decades. In the UK, 2 species have become nationally extinct during the last 75 years while others have been placed on the UK Biodiversity Action Plan as priority species in recognition of the need for conservation action. In 2006 a new charity, the [[Bumblebee Conservation Trust]], was established in order to coordinate efforts to conserve remaining populations through conservation and education.

=== Stingless bees ===
{{Main|Stingless bee}}

[[Stingless bee]]s are very diverse in behavior, but all are highly [[eusocial]]. They practise mass provisioning, complex nest architecture, and perennial colonies.

=== Honey bees ===

{{Main|Honey bee}}

The true honey bees (genus ''[[Apis (genus)|Apis]]'') have arguably the most complex [[social behavior]] among the bees. The [[European honey bee|European (or Western) honey bee]], ''Apis mellifera'', is the best known bee species and one of the best known of all insects.

=== Africanized honey bee ===
{{Main|Africanized bee}}

Africanized bees, also called killer bees, are a hybrid strain of ''[[Apis mellifera]]'' derived from experiments by [[Warwick Estevam Kerr]] to cross European and African honey bees. Several queen bees escaped from his laboratory in [[South America]] and have spread throughout the Americas. Africanized honey bees are more defensive than European honey bees.

== Solitary and communal bees ==

Most other bees, including familiar species of bee such as the [[Eastern carpenter bee]] (''Xylocopa virginica''), [[alfalfa leafcutter bee]] (''Megachile rotundata''), [[orchard mason bee]] (''Osmia lignaria'') and the [[hornfaced bee]] (''Osmia cornifrons'') are solitary in the sense that every female is fertile, and typically inhabits a nest she constructs herself. There are no ''worker'' bees for these species. Solitary bees typically produce neither honey nor [[beeswax]]. They are immune from [[acarine]] and ''[[Varroa]]'' [[mite]]s, but have their own unique [[parasite]]s, pests and [[disease]]s (see also [[diseases of the honey bee]]).

Solitary bees are important pollinators, and pollen is gathered for provisioning the nest with food for their brood. Often it is mixed with nectar to form a paste-like consistency. Some solitary bees have very advanced types of pollen-carrying structures on their bodies. A very few species of solitary bees are being increasingly cultured for commercial pollination.

[[File:Anthidium February 2008-1.jpg|left|thumb|A solitary bee, ''[[Anthidium florentinum]]'' (family [[Megachilidae]]), visiting ''[[Lantana]]'']]

Solitary bees are often [[oligolege]]s, in that they only gather pollen from one or a few species/genera of plants (unlike honey bees and bumblebees which are generalists). No known bees are nectar specialists; many oligolectic bees will visit multiple plants for nectar, but there are no bees which visit only one plant for nectar while also gathering pollen from many different sources. Specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of pollen, and male orchid bees, which gather aromatic compounds from [[orchid]]s (one of the only cases where male bees are effective pollinators). In a very few cases only one species of bee can effectively pollinate a [[plant]] species, and some plants are [[endangered species|endangered]] at least in part because their pollinator is dying off. There is, however, a pronounced tendency for oligolectic bees to be associated with common, widespread plants which are visited by multiple pollinators (e.g., there are some 40 oligoleges associated with [[Larrea tridentata|creosote bush]] in the US desert southwest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hurd, P.D. Jr., Linsley, E.G. |year=1975 |title=The principal ''[[Larrea]]'' bees of the southwestern United States. |journal=Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology |volume=193 |pages=1–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar pattern is seen in [[sunflower]]s, [[Aster (genus)|asters]], [[mesquite]], etc.)

Solitary bees create nests in hollow [[Phragmites|reeds]] or twigs, holes in [[wood]], or, most commonly, in tunnels in the ground. The female typically creates a compartment (a &quot;cell&quot;) with an egg and some provisions for the resulting larva, then seals it off. A nest may consist of numerous cells. When the nest is in wood, usually the last (those closer to the entrance) contain eggs that will become males. The adult does not provide care for the brood once the egg is laid, and usually dies after making one or more nests. The males typically emerge first and are ready for mating when the females emerge. Providing nest boxes for solitary bees is increasingly popular for [[gardener]]s. Solitary bees are either stingless or very unlikely to sting (only in self defense, if ever).

While solitary females each make individual nests, some species are gregarious, preferring to make nests near others of the same species, giving the appearance to the casual observer that they are social. Large groups of solitary bee nests are called ''aggregations'', to distinguish them from [[colony (biology)|colonies]].

In some species, multiple females share a common nest, but each makes and provisions her own cells independently. This type of group is called &quot;communal&quot; and is not uncommon. The primary advantage appears to be that a nest entrance is easier to defend from predators and parasites when there are multiple females using that same entrance on a regular basis.

== Cleptoparasitic bees ==
[[File:Bumblebee January 2008-4.jpg|thumb|''Bombus vestalis'', a cuckoo bee parasite of the bumblebee [[Bombus terrestris]] ]]

[[cleptoparasite|Cleptoparasitic]] bees, commonly called &quot;[[cuckoo bee]]s&quot; because their behavior is similar to [[cuckoo]] birds, occur in several bee families, though the name is technically best applied to the [[apidae|apid]] subfamily [[Nomadinae]]. Females of these bees lack pollen collecting structures (the [[scopa (biology)|scopa]]) and do not construct their own nests. They typically enter the nests of pollen collecting species, and lay their eggs in cells provisioned by the host bee. When the cuckoo bee larva hatches it consumes the host larva's pollen ball, and if the female cleptoparasite has not already done so, kills and eats the host larva. In a few cases where the hosts are social species, the cleptoparasite remains in the host nest and lays many eggs, sometimes even killing the host queen and replacing her.

Many cleptoparasitic bees are closely related to, and resemble, their hosts in looks and size, (i.e., the ''[[Bombus]]'' subgenus ''Psithyrus'', which are parasitic bumblebees that infiltrate nests of species in other subgenera of ''[[Bombus]]''). This common pattern gave rise to the ecological principle known as &quot;[[Emery's Rule]]&quot;. Others parasitize bees in different families, like ''[[Townsendiella]]'', a [[nomadinae|nomadine]] [[apidae|apid]], one species of which is a cleptoparasite of the [[Dasypodaidae|dasypodaid]] genus ''[[Hesperapis]]'', while the other species in the same genus attack [[halictidae|halictid]] bees.

== Nocturnal bees ==

Four bee families ([[Andrenidae]], [[Colletidae]], [[Halictidae]], and [[Apidae]]) contain some species that are [[crepuscular]] (these may be either the [[vespertine (biology)|vespertine]] or [[matinal]] type). These bees have greatly enlarged [[ocellus|ocelli]], which are extremely sensitive to light and dark, though incapable of forming images. Many are pollinators of flowers that themselves are [[crepuscular]], such as [[Oenothera|evening primroses]], and some live in desert habitats where daytime temperatures are extremely high.

== Flight ==

[[File:Apis mellifera flying.jpg|thumb|Bee in mid air flight carrying pollen in [[pollen basket]]]]

In his 1934 French book ''Le vol des insectes'', M. Magnan wrote that he and a M. [[Saint-Lague]] had applied the equations of [[air resistance]] to [[bumblebee]]s and found that their flight could not be explained by fixed-wing calculations, but that &quot;One shouldn't be surprised that the results of the calculations don't square with reality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, Jay ''The Barmaid's Brain'', Aurum Press, 2001, pp. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to a common misconception that bees &quot;violate aerodynamic theory&quot;, but in fact it merely confirms that bees do not engage in fixed-wing flight, and that their flight is explained by other mechanics, such as those used by helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cecil Adams |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1076/is-it-aerodynamically-impossible-for-bumblebees-to-fly |title=Is it aerodynamically impossible for bumblebees to fly? |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=1990-05-04 |accessdate=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 Charlie Ellington at [[Cambridge University]] showed that vortices created by many insects’ wings and non-linear effects were a vital source of lift;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn8382-secrets-of-bee-flight-revealed.html Secrets of bee flight revealed], Phillips, Helen. 28 November 2005. Retrieved 2007-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; [[vortex|vortices]] and non-linear phenomena are notoriously difficult areas of [[hydrodynamics]], which has made for slow progress in theoretical understanding of [[insect flight]].

In 2005, Michael Dickinson and his [[Caltech]] colleagues studied [[Western honey bee|honey bee]] flight with the assistance of high-speed [[cinematography]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newscientist.com/data/images/ns/av/dn8382.avi&lt;/ref&gt; and a giant robotic mock-up of a bee wing.&lt;ref name=caltech&gt;[http://mr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12772.html Deciphering the Mystery of Bee Flight] Caltech Media Relations. Nov. 29, 2005. Retrieved 2007, [[April 7|4-7]].&lt;/ref&gt; Their analysis revealed that sufficient lift was generated by &quot;the unconventional combination of short, choppy wing strokes, a rapid rotation of the wing as it flops over and reverses direction, and a very fast wing-beat frequency&quot;. Wing-beat frequency normally increases as size decreases, but as the bee's wing beat covers such a small [[arc (geometry)|arc]], it flaps approximately 230 times per second, faster than a [[Drosophilidae|fruitfly]] (200 times per second) which is 80 times smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Douglas L. Altshuler, William B. Dickson, Jason T. Vance, Stephen P. Roberts, and Michael H. Dickinson|title=Short-amplitude high-frequency wing strokes determine the aerodynamics of honeybee flight|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.|volume=102|issue=50|pages=18213–18218|year=2005|doi=10.1073/pnas.0506590102|pmid=16330767|pmc=1312389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bees and humans ==
[[File:Botoktawon.jpg|thumb|Bee larvae as food in [[Java]]]]

Bees figure prominently in [[Bee (mythology)|mythology]] and have been used by political theorists as a model for human [[society]]. Journalist Bee Wilson states that the image of a community of honey bees &quot;occurs from ancient to modern times, in [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]; in [[Virgil]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]; in [[Erasmus]] and [[Shakespeare]]; [[Tolstoy]], as well as by social theorists [[Bernard Mandeville]] and [[Karl Marx]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Bee|year=2004|title=The Hive: The Story Of The Honeybee|location=London, Great Britain|publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)]]|isbn=0719565987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the honey bee's painful sting and the stereotype of insects as pests, bees are generally held in high regard. This is most likely due to their usefulness as pollinators and as producers of honey, their social nature, and their reputation for diligence. Bees are one of the few insects regularly used on [[Advertising|advertisements]], being used to illustrate honey and foods made with honey (such as [[Honey Nut Cheerios]]).

In [[ancient Egypt]], the bee was seen to symbolize the lands of [[Lower Egypt]], with the [[Pharaoh]] being referred to as &quot;He of [[Cyperaceae|Sedge]] and Bee&quot; (the sedge representing [[Upper Egypt]]).

In [[North America]], [[yellowjacket]]s and [[hornet]]s, especially when encountered as flying pests, are often misidentified as bees, despite numerous differences between them.

Although a [[bee sting]] can be deadly to those with allergies, virtually all bee species are non-aggressive if undisturbed and many cannot sting at all. Humans are often a greater danger to bees, as bees can be affected or even harmed by encounters with toxic chemicals in the environment (see also [[bees and toxic chemicals]]).

In [[Indonesia]] bee larvae are eaten as a companion to [[rice]], after being mixed with shredded [[coconut]] &quot;meat&quot;, wrapped in [[banana]] leaves, and steamed.

The '''Basques''' ({{lang-eu|euskaldunak}}, {{lang-es|vascos}}, {{lang-fr|basques}}) as an [[ethnic group]], primarily inhabit an area traditionally known as the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] ({{lang-eu|Euskal Herria}}), a region that is located around the western end of the [[Pyrenees]] on the coast of the [[Bay of Biscay]] and straddles parts of north-central Spain and south-western France.

The Basques are known in the local languages as:
*''Euskaldunak'' (&quot;Basque speakers&quot;, also used loosely to describe all ethnic Basques), ''euskal herritarrak'' (&quot;natives of the Basque Country&quot;) or ''euskotarrak'' (&quot;natives of the Basque Country&quot;, an often mentioned but rarely used neologism) in [[Basque language|Basque]]
*''Vascos'' in Spanish
*''Basques'' in French
*''Bascos'' in [[Gascon language|Gascon]]

==Etymology of the word ''Basque''==
The English word ''Basque'' comes from French ''Basque'' (pronounced {{IPA|/bask/}}), which itself comes from [[Gascon language|Gascon]] ''Basco'' (pronounced {{IPA|/ˈbasku/}}) and Spanish ''Vasco'' {{Citation needed|reason=from both?|date=July 2009}} (pronounced {{IPA|/ˈbasko/}}). These, in turn, come from [[Latin]] ''Vasco'' (pronounced {{IPA|/wasko/}}), plural ''Vascones'' (see History section below). The Latin [[labial-velar approximant]] /w/ generally [[betacism|evolved into]] the [[bilabial]]s /b/ and /β̞/ in Gascon and Spanish, probably under the influence of Basque and [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]], a language related to old Basque and spoken in [[Gascony]] in [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] (similarly the Latin /w/ evolved into /v/ in [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and other languages). This explains the Roman [[pun]] at the expense of the Aquitanians (ancestors of the Gascons): ''Beati Hispani quibus vivere bibere est'', which translates as &quot;Blessed (are the) [[Spaniards]], for whom to live is to drink.&quot;{{Citation needed|reason=latin is known by many even today: how can we date this 'pun'?|date=August 2009}}

[[Image:Barscunes transparent.png|thumb|left|Barscunes coin, Roman period]]
Several coins from the 1st and 2nd centuries BC found in the Basque Country bear the inscription ''barscunes''. The place where they were minted is not certain but is thought to be somewhere near [[Pamplona]] in the heartland of the area that historians believe was inhabited by the ''Vascones''. Some scholars have suggested a Celtic etymology based on ''bhar-s-'', meaning &quot;summit&quot;, &quot;point&quot; or &quot;leaves&quot;, according to which ''barscunes'' may have meant &quot;the mountain people&quot;, &quot;the tall ones&quot; or &quot;the proud ones&quot;, while others have posited a relationship to a [[proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]] root ''*bar-'' meaning &quot;border&quot;, &quot;frontier&quot;, &quot;march&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/130014?idi=en&amp;clave=130014&amp;op=4&amp;primR=1&amp;regs=10&amp;EIKVOGEN=Barscunes&amp;pos=4&amp;epi=120849#mrc1 |title=Vascones - el nombre (Auñamendi Encyclopedia) |publisher=Euskomedia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Basque, Basques call themselves ''euskaldunak'', singular ''euskaldun'', formed from ''euskal-'' (i.e. &quot;Basque (language)&quot;) and ''-dun'' (i.e. &quot;one who has&quot;); ''euskaldun'' literally means a Basque speaker. Not all Basques are Basque-speakers, and not all Basque speakers are Basques; foreigners who have learned Basque can also be called ''euskaldunak''. Therefore the [[neologism]] ''euskotar'', plural ''euskotarrak'', was coined in the 19th century to mean an ethnically Basque person whether Basque-speaking or not. These Basque words are all derived from ''euskara'', the Basque name for the Basque language.

Alfonso Irigoyen claimed that the word ''euskara'' comes from an ancient Basque verb ''enautsi'' &quot;to say&quot; (cf. modern Basque ''esan'') and the suffix ''-(k)ara'' (&quot;way (of doing something)&quot;). Thus ''euskara'' would literally mean &quot;way of saying&quot;, &quot;way of speaking&quot;. One item of evidence in favour of this hypothesis is found in the Spanish book ''Compendio Historial'', written in 1571 by the Basque writer [[Esteban de Garibay]], who records the name of the Basque language as &quot;''enusquera''&quot;. It may be however a writing mistake.
{{IPA notice}}
In the 19th century, the Basque nationalist activist [[Sabino Arana]] posited an original root ''euzko'' which, he thought, came from ''eguzkiko'' (&quot;of the sun&quot; on the assumption of an original [[Solar deity|solar religion]]). On the basis of this putative root Arana proposed the name [[Basque Country (greater region)|Euzkadi]] for an independent Basque nation, composed by seven basque historical territories. Arana's neologism Euzkadi, in the regularized spelling Euskadi, is still widely used in both Basque and Spanish, since it is now the official name of the [[Autonomous Community]] of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].

It has also been suggested that the root of ''eusk-'' may be linked to the Aquitanian tribe of the [[Auch|Ausci]].

==History==
{{Main|History of the Basque people|Origin of the Basques}}

Since the Basque language is unrelated to Indo-European, it is often thought that they represent the people or culture who occupied Europe before the spread of Indo-European languages there.

It is thought that Basques are a remnant of the early inhabitants of Western Europe, specifically those of the Franco-Cantabrian region. Basque tribes were already mentioned in Roman times by Strabo and Pliny, including the [[Vascones]], [[Novempopulania|the Aquitani]] and others. There is enough evidence to support that at that time and later they spoke old varieties of the Basque language (see: [[Aquitanian language]]).

In the Early Middle Ages (up to 9-10th centuries) the territory between the [[Ebro]] and [[Garonne]] rivers was known as [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], a blur ethnic area and polity struggling to fend off the pressure of the Iberian [[Visigothic]] kingdom and Muslim rule on the south and the [[Franks|Frankish]] push on the north. A Basque presence is cited on the southern banks of the Loire river too (7-8th centuries). By the turn of the millennium, after Muslim invasions and Frankish expansion under Charlemagne, the territory of Vasconia (to become [[Gascony]]) fragmented into different feudal regions, for example, the viscountcies of [[Soule]] and [[Labourd]] out of former tribal systems and minor realms ([[County of Vasconia]]), while south of the Pyrenees the [[Kingdom of Castile]], [[Kingdom of Pamplona]] and the Pyrenean counties of [[County of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Sobrarbe]], [[Ribagorza]] and [[Pallars]] (later merged into the [[Kingdom of Aragon]]) arose as the main regional powers with Basque population in the ninth century.

The Kingdom of Pamplona (a central Basque realm), later known as [[Navarre]], experienced feudalization and was subjected to the influences of its vaster Aragonese, Castilian and French neighbours, with Castile annexing [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|key western territories]] of it in the 11th and the twelfth century, so depriving the kingdom of a direct way out to the ocean. Eventually [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|the bulk of the realm would fall]] to the thrust of Spanish troops from 1512 to 1521 after a civil war. [[Lower Navarre|The Navarrese territory north of the Pyrenees]] remaining out of Spanish rule would end up being formally absorbed to France in 1620.

Nevertheless the Basque provinces enjoyed a great deal of self-government until the French Revolution in the [[Iparralde|North]] and the civil wars named [[Carlist Wars]] in the [[Southern Basque Country|South]] when the Basques supported heir apparent Carlos and his descendants to the cry of &quot;God, Fatherland, King&quot; (Charters abolished). Since then, despite the current limited self-governing status of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] and Navarre as settled by the Spanish Constitution, a significant part of Basque society is still attempting higher degrees of self-empowerment (see [[Basque nationalism]]), sometimes by acts of violence.

==Geography==
===Political and administrative divisions===
The Basque region is divided into at least three administrative units, namely the [[Basque Autonomous Community]] and [[Navarre]] in Spain, and the [[Arrondissements of France|arrondissement]] of [[Bayonne]] and the [[cantons of France|cantons]] of [[Mauléon-Licharre]] and [[Tardets-Sorholus]] in the ''[[département]]'' of [[Pyrénées Atlantiques]], France.

The autonomous community (a concept established in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]) known as ''Euskal Autonomia Erkidegoa'' or EAE in Basque and as ''Comunidad Autónoma Vasca'' or CAV in Spanish (in English: ''Basque Autonomous Community'' or BAC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.euskadi.net/euskalterm/ |title=See EUSKALTERM, the Basque Public Term Bank, maintained by the Basque Government for these and other terms and their common translations |publisher=.euskadi.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is made up of the three Spanish provinces of [[Álava]], [[Biscay]] and [[Gipuzkoa]]. The corresponding Basque names of these territories are ''Araba'', ''Bizkaia'' and ''Gipuzkoa'', and their Spanish names are ''Álava'', ''Vizcaya'' and ''Guipúzcoa''.

The BAC only includes three of the seven provinces of the currently called historical territories. It is sometimes referred to simply as &quot;the Basque Country&quot; (or ''Euskadi'') by writers and public agencies only considering those three western provinces, but also on occasions merely as a convenient abbreviation when this does not lead to confusion in the context. Others reject this usage as inaccurate and are careful to specify the BAC (or an equivalent expression such as &quot;the three provinces&quot;, up to 1978 referred to as &quot;Provincias Vascongadas&quot; in Spanish) when referring to this entity or region. Likewise, terms such as &quot;the Basque Government&quot; for &quot;the government of the BAC&quot; are commonly though not universally employed. In particular in common usage the French term ''Pays Basque'' (&quot;Basque Country&quot;), in the absence of further qualification, refers either to the whole [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] (&quot;Euskal Herria&quot; in Basque), or not infrequently to the [[Northern Basque Country|northern (or &quot;French&quot;) Basque Country]] specifically.

Under Spain's present constitution, Navarre (''Nafarroa'' in present-day Basque, ''Navarra'' historically in Spanish) constitutes a separate entity, called in present-day Basque ''Nafarroako Foru Erkidegoa'', in Spanish ''Comunidad Foral de Navarra'' (the autonomous community of Navarre). The government of this autonomous community is the Government of Navarre. Note that in historical contexts Navarre may refer to a wider area, and that the present-day northern Basque province of [[Lower Navarre]] may also be referred to as (part of) ''Nafarroa'', while the term &quot;High Navarre&quot; (''Nafarroa Garaia'' in Basque, ''Alta Navarra'' in Spanish) is also encountered as a way of referring to the territory of the present-day autonomous community.

There are three other historic provinces parts of the Basque Country: [[Labourd]], [[Lower Navarre]] and [[Soule]] (''Lapurdi, Nafarroa Beherea'' and ''Zuberoa'' in Basque; ''Labourd, Basse-Navarre'' and ''Soule'' in French), devoid of official status within France's present-day political and administrative territorial organization, and only minor political support to the Basque nationalists. A large number of regional and local nationalist and non-nationalist representatives has waged a campaign for years advocating for the creation of a separate Basque [[département]], while these demands have gone unheard by the French administration.

===Population, main cities and languages===
There are 2,123,000 people living in the Basque Autonomous Community (279,000 in Alava, 1,160,000 in Biscay and 684,000 in Gipuzkoa). The most important cities in this region, which serve as the provinces' administrative centers, are [[Bilbao]] (in Biscay), [[San Sebastián]] (in Gipuzkoa) and [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] (in Álava). The official languages are Basque and Spanish. Knowledge of Spanish is compulsory according to the Spanish Constitution (article no. 3), and knowledge and usage of Basque is a right according to the Statute of Autonomy (article no. 6), so only knowledge of Spanish is virtually universal. Knowledge of Basque, after declining for many years during [[Spain under Franco|Franco's dictatorship]] owing to official persecution, is again on the rise due to favourable official language policies and popular support. Currently about 33 percent of the BAC's population speaks Basque.

Navarre has a population of 601,000; its administrative capital and main city, also regarded by many nationalist Basques as the Basques' historical capital, is Pamplona (''Iruñea'' in modern Basque). Although Spanish and Basque are official languages in this autonomous community, Basque language rights are only recognised by current legislation and language policy in the province's northern region, where most Basque-speaking Navarrese are concentrated.

Approximately a quarter of a million people live in the part of claimed [[French Basque Country]]. Basque-speakers refer to this as &quot;Iparralde&quot; ( Basque for ''North''), and therefore to the Spanish provinces as &quot;Hegoalde&quot; (''South''). Much of this population lives in or near the Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz (BAB) urban belt on the coast (in Basque these are ''Baiona, Angelu'' and ''Miarritze''). The Basque language, which was traditionally spoken by most of the region's population outside the BAB urban zone, is today losing ground to French at a fast rate. Associated with the northern Basque Country's lack of self-government within the French state is the absence of official status for the Basque language throughout this region.

==The Basque diaspora==
{{Main|Basque diaspora}}
Large numbers of Basques have left the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] for other parts of the world in different historical periods, often for economic or political reasons. Basques are often employed in sheepherding and ranching, maritime fisheries and merchants around the world. Millions of Basque descendants (see [[Basque American]]) live in North America (the United States and Mexico; Canada mainly in the provinces of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Quebec]]), Latin America (in all 23 countries), [[Southern Africa]] and Australia.

[[Miguel de Unamuno]] said: &quot;There are at least two things that clearly can be attributed to Basques: the [[Society of Jesus]] and the [[Republic of Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;«La Compañía de Jesús y la República de Chile son las dos grandes hazañas del pueblo vascongado», solía decir don Miguel de Unamuno&quot;. Miguel de Unamuno used to say &quot;The Company of Jesus and the Republic of Chile are the two great achievements of the Basque people.&quot; [http://www.filosofia.org/hem/194/alf/ez2302a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Louis Thayer Ojeda estimates that during the 17th and 18th centuries fully 45% of all immigrants in [[History of Chile|Chile]] were Basques.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Douglass, Jon Bilbao (2005). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=8KzfK1QwxDIC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Amerikanuak: Basques in the New World]''&quot;. [[University of Nevada Press]]. p.81. ISBN 0874176255&lt;/ref&gt; Over 4.5 million [[Basque Chilean|Basque descendants]] live in [[Chile]] and were a major influence in the country's [[cultural]] and [[economic]] development.

A large wave of Basques emigrated to Latin America and substantial numbers settled elsewhere in North (the U.S.) and Latin America, particularly in [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]], where Basque place names are to be found, such as New Biscay, now [[Durango]] (Mexico), [[Biscayne Bay]], [[Jalapa, Jalapa|Jalapa]] (Guatemala), Aguerreberry or Aguereberry Point in the United States, and the ''[[Nuevo Santander]]'' region of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basqueed.org/BEO%20Basque%20Culture%20Day%202007.htm |title=Basque Culture Day |publisher=Basqueed.org |date=2007-10-06 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain|Nueva Vizcaya]] was the first province in the north of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (Mexico) to be explored and settled by the Spanish. It consisted mostly of the area which is today the states of Chihuahua and Durango.

In Mexico most Basques are concentrated in the cities of [[Monterrey]], [[Saltillo]], [[Reynosa]], [[Camargo, Chihuahua|Camargo]], and the states of [[Jalisco]], [[Durango]], [[Nuevo León]], [[Tamaulipas]], and [[Coahuila]]. The Basques were important in the mining industry, many were ranchers and vaqueros ([[cowboy]]s), and the rest opened small shops in major cities like [[Mexico City]], [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]] and [[Puebla]]. In Guatemala most Basques have been concentrated in [[Jalapa Department|Jalapa]] for six generations now, while some have immigrated to the city of [[Guatemala City|Guatemala]].

The largest of several important Basque communities in the United States is in the area around [[Boise, Idaho]], home to the Basque Museum and Cultural Center, host to a Basque festival every year, as well as a festival for the entire Basque diaspora every five years. [[Reno, Nevada]], where the Center for Basque Studies and the Basque Studies Library are located in the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]], is another significant nucleus of Basque population. In [[Elko, Nevada]] there is an annual Basque festival that celebrates the dance, cuisine and cultures of the Basque peoples of Spanish, French and Mexican nationalities arrived to [[Nevada]] since the late 19th century.

[[California]] is a major concentration of Basques in the United States, most notably in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] between [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]]. The city of Bakersfield itself has a large Basque community and the city boasts several Basque restaurants.

There also exists a history of Basque culture in [[Chino, California]]. In Chino, there are two annual Basque festivals that celebrate the dance, cuisine, and culture of the peoples, and the surrounding area of [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]] has many Basque descendants. They are mostly descendants of settlers from Spain and Mexico. These Basques in California are grouped in the ethnic group known as ''[[Californio]]s''.

In [[South Texas]] along the Mexican-Texan border of the [[Rio Grande Valley]], many people are of Basque heritage or have Basque surnames. Along this area are many ranches given to colonial Spanish settlers from Basque Country to [[New Spain]] which still exist today. They are mostly descendants of settlers from Spain and Mexico, with a number from other parts of Hispanic America. These Basques in south Texas are grouped in the ethnic group known as ''[[Tejano]]s''.

Basques of European Spanish-French and Latin American nationalities also settled throughout the western U.S. in states like [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]], [[Oregon]] and [[Washington state]].

There are also many Basques and people of Basque ancestry living outside their homeland in Spain, France and other European countries. [[Image:Nortasun.png|Classification of population according to cultural identity|thumb|right|300px]]

==Culture==
===Language===
{{Main|Basque language}}
The identifying language of the Basques is called Basque or ''Euskara'', spoken today by 25%-30%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eke.org/euskara/soziolinguistika |title=Sociolinguistics |publisher=Eke.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the region's population. An idea of the central place of the ethnic terms in Basque nationalist politicians is given by the fact that, in Basque, Basques identify themselves by the term ''euskaldun'' and their country as ''Euskal Herria'', literally &quot;Basque speaker&quot; and &quot;Country of the Basque Language&quot; respectively. The language has been made a political issue by official Spanish and French policies restricting its use either historically or currently; however, this has not stopped the teaching, speaking, writing and cultivating of this increasingly vibrant minority language. It is important to remember that the sense of Basque identity tied to the local language does not exist in isolation. It is juxtaposed with an equally strong sense of national identity tied with the use of the Spanish and [[French language]]s among other Basques. As with many European states, a regional identity, be it linguistically derived or otherwise, is not mutually exclusive with the broader national one.

As a result of state language promotion, school policies, the impact of mass media, and the effects of migration, today virtually all Basques (except for some children below school age) speak the official language of their state (Spanish or French). Therefore, there are extremely few Basque monoglots: essentially all Basque speakers are bilingual on both sides of the border. This reality, coupled with the fact that Spanish or French is also typically the first language of citizens from other regions (that often feel no need to learn Basque), maintains the dominance of the state tongues of both France and Spain. Recent Basque Government policies aim to change this pattern, as they are viewed as potential threats against mainstream usage of the minority tongue.&lt;ref&gt;X. Aierdi Urraza, [http://www.euskara.euskadi.net/r59-3693/en/contenidos/informacion/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07/en_integraz/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07.html Routes to linguistic and cultural integration for immigrants in the Basque Autonomous Community]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Basque language is thought to be a [[genetic (linguistics)|genetic]] [[language isolate]]. Thus Basque contrasts with other European languages, almost all of which belong to the large [[Indo-European language family]]. Another peculiarity of Basque is that it has been spoken continuously ''in situ'', in and around its present territorial location, for longer than other modern European languages, which have all been introduced in historical or prehistorical times through population migrations or other processes of cultural transmission.&lt;ref name = &quot;kosvtz&quot;&gt;[[Larry Trask|TRASK, Robert Lawrence]]: History of Basque. New York/London: Routledge, 1996. ISBN 0-415-13116-2{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, popular stereotypes characterizing Basque as &quot;the oldest language in Europe&quot; and &quot;unique among the world's languages&quot; may be misunderstood and lead to erroneous assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Moreno Cabrera, [http://www.euskara.euskadi.net/r59-3693/en/contenidos/informacion/artik12_1_aurreiritziak_06_10/en_aurreiri/artik12_1_aurreiritziak_06_10.html Misconceptions about Basque]&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, Basque has remained in constant contact with neighboring languages in its western European surroundings, with which it has come to share numerous lexical items and typological features; it is therefore misleading to exaggerate the &quot;outlandish&quot; character of Basque. Basque is also a modern language, and nowadays firmly established as a written and printed medium, also used in present-day forms of publication and communication, as well as a language spoken and used in a very wide range of social and cultural contexts, styles, and registers.

===Land and inheritance===
Basques have a close attachment to their home (''etxe(a)'' 'house, home'), especially when this consists of the traditional self-sufficient, family-run farm or ''[[baserri]](a)''. Home in this context is synonymous with family roots. Old ''baserri'' names, themselves typically expressing short-range geographical orientations or other locally meaningful identifying features, have transmuted into modern [[Basque surnames]], thereby providing even Basques whose families may have left the land generations ago with an important link to their rural family origins: ''Bengoetxea'' &quot;the house of further down&quot;, ''Goikoetxea'' &quot;the house above&quot;, ''Landaburu'' &quot;top of the field&quot;, ''Errekondo'' &quot;next to the stream&quot;, ''Elizalde'' &quot;by the church&quot;, ''Mendizabal'' &quot;wide hill&quot;, ''Usetxe'' &quot;house of birds&quot; ''Ibarretxe'' &quot;house in the valley&quot;, ''Etxeberria'' &quot;the new house&quot;, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[[Koldo Mitxelena|MITXELENA, Koldo]], ''Apellidos vascos'' (fifth edition), San Sebastián: Txertoa, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

A widespread belief that Basque society was originally [[matriarchal]] seems to conflict with the clearly [[patrilinear]] character of known family inheritance structures. There have been attempts to reconcile these points by assuming that the latter represents an innovation. In any case, the social position of women in both traditional and modern Basque society is somewhat better than in neighbouring cultures, and women have a substantial influence in decisions about the domestic economy. In the past, some women participated in collective magical ceremonies, and were key participants in a rich folklore, today largely forgotten.

In contrast to surrounding regions, ancient Basque inheritance patterns, recognised in the [[fueros]], favour survival of the unity of inherited land holdings which generally fall to a single male heir, usually the oldest son. This system forced the other siblings to find other sources of sustenance, and before the advent of industrialisation resulted in the emigration of many rural Basques to Spain, France or the Americas. This system, harsh by modern standards, was no doubt responsible for sending out into the world a great many enterprising personalities of Basque origin, from Spanish [[conquistador]]s such as [[Lope de Aguirre]], Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, to saints of the Catholic Church such as [[Francis Xavier]].

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Basque cuisine}}
[[Basque cuisine]] is at the heart of Basque culture, influenced by the neighboring communities and the excellent produce from the sea and the land. A twentieth-century feature of Basque culture is the phenomenon of [[gastronomical society|gastronomical societies]] (called [[txoko]] in Basque), food clubs where men gather to cook and enjoy their own food. Until recently, women were only allowed one day in the year. Cider houses ([[Sagardotegi]]ak) are popular restaurants in Gipuzkoa open for a few months while the cider is in season.

===Cultural production===
Despite [[ETA]] and the crisis of heavy industries, the Basque economic condition has recovered remarkably in recent years, emerging from the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] regime with a revitalized language and culture. The Basque language is expanding geographically led by large increases in the major urban centers of Pamplona, Bilbao, and Bayonne, where only a few decades ago the Basque language had all but disappeared.

===Music===
{{Main|Basque music}}

===Religion===
Traditionally Basques have been mostly [[Roman Catholic]]s. In the 19th century and well into the 20th, Basques as a group remained notably devout and churchgoing. In recent years church attendance has fallen off, as in most of Western Europe. The region has been a source of missionaries like [[Francis Xavier]] and [[Michel Garicoïts]]. [[Ignatius Loyola]], founder of the [[Society of Jesus]], was a Basque. 17th C. [[California]] [[Franciscan]] [[Fermín Lasuén]] was born in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]]. Lasuén was the successor to Franciscan Padre [[Junipero Serra]] and founded 9 of the 21 extant [[California Missions]] along the coast.

A sprout of [[Protestantism]] in the continental Basque Country produced the first translation of the new Testament into Basque by [[Joanes Leizarraga]]. After [[Henry IV of France|the king of Navarre]] converted to Catholicism to be king of France, Protestantism almost disappeared.

[[Bayonne, France|Bayonne]] held a Jewish community composed mainly of [[Sephardi Jews]] fleeing from the [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s. There were also important Jewish and [[Muslim]] communities in [[Navarre]] before the Castilian invasion of 1512-21.

Nowadays only slightly more than 50% of Basques profess some kind of belief in [[God]], while the rest are either [[agnostic]] or [[atheist]]. The number of religious skeptics increases noticeably for the younger generations, while the older ones are more religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eitb.com/argazki/forum_re/caracterizacion.pdf |title=Opinion poll on religion by GIZAKER|publisher= [[EITB]] the Basque Country's public broadcast service. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pre-Christian religion and mythology====
[[Image:Amboto.jpg|thumb|[[Anboto]] mountain is one of sites where [[Mari (goddess)|Mari]] was believed to dwell]]
{{Main|Basque mythology}}
Christianisation of the Basque Country has been the topic of some discussion. There are broadly speaking two views. According to one, Christianity arrived in the Basque Country during the 4th and 5th century but according to the other, it did not take place until the 12th and 13th century. The main issue lies in the different interpretations of what is considered Christianisation. Early traces of Christianity can be found in the major urban areas from the 4th century onwards, a bishopric from 589 in Pamplona and three hermit cave concentrations (two in Álava, one in Navarre) were in use from the 6th century onwards. In this sense, Christianity arrived &quot;early&quot;.

Pre-Christian belief seems to have focused on a goddess called [[Mari (goddess)|Mari]]. A number of place-names contain her name and would suggest these places were related to worship of her such as ''[[Anbotoko Mari]]'' who appears to have been related to the weather. According to one tradition, she traveled every seven years between a cave on Mount [[Anboto]] and one on another mountain (the stories vary); the weather would be wet when she was in Anboto, dry when she was in [[Aloña]], or [[Supelegor]], or [[Gorbea]]. One of her names, ''Mari Urraca'' possibly ties here to a historical Navarrese princess of the 11th and 12th century, with other legends giving her a brother or cousin who was a Roman Catholic priest. So far the discussions about whether the name Mari is original and just happened to coincide closely with the Christian name María or if Mari is an early Basque attempt to give a Christian veneer to pagan worship have remained speculative.

Mari's consort is [[Sugaar]]. This [[chthonic]] couple seem to bear the superior ethical power and also the power of creation and destruction. It's said that when they gathered in the high caves of the sacred peaks, they engendered the storms. These meetings typically happened on Friday nights, the day of historical [[Akelarre (witchcraft)|akelarre]] or [[coven]]. Mari was said to reside in Mount [[Anboto]]; periodically she crossed the skies as a bright light to reach her other home at mount [[Txindoki]].

Legends also speak of many and abundant genies, like ''[[jentilak]]'' (equivalent to [[giant (mythology)|giant]]s), ''lamiak'' (equivalent to [[nymph]]s), ''[[mairu]]ak'' (builders of the cromlechs or stone circles, literally [[Moors]]), ''iratxoak'' ([[imp]]s), ''[[sorginak]]'' ([[witch]]es, priestess of Mari), and so on. [[Basajaun]] is a Basque version of the [[Woodwose]]. There is a [[trickster]] named ''[[San Martin Txiki]]'' (&quot;St Martin the Lesser&quot;).

It has been shown that some of these stories have entered Basque culture in recent centuries or as part of Roman ''[[superstition]]''. It is unclear whether [[neolithic]] stone structures called [[dolmen]]s have a religious significance or were built to house animals or resting shepherds. Some of the dolmens and [[cromlech]]s are burial sites serving as well as border markers.

The ''jentilak'' ('[[Giant (mythology)|Giants]]'), on the other hand, are a legendary people which explains the disappearance of a people of [[Stone Age]] culture that used to live in the high lands and with no knowledge of the iron. Many legends about them tell that they were bigger and taller, with a great force, but were displaced by the ''ferrons'', or workers of ironworks foundries, until their total fade-out. They were pagans, but one of them, [[Olentzero]], accepted Christianity and became a sort of Basque [[Santa Claus]]. They gave name to several toponyms, as ''[[Jentilbaratza]]''.

===Society===
Historically, Basque society can be described as being somewhat at odds with Roman and later Western European societal norms.

[[Strabo]]'s account of the north of Spain in his ''[[Geographica]]'' makes a mention of 'a sort of woman-rule - not at all a mark of civilization' (Hadington 1992), a first mention of the - for the period - unusual position of women. &quot;Women could inherit and control property as well as officiate in churches. Combined with the issue of lingering pagan beliefs, this enraged the leaders of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], perhaps leading to [[Logroño trials|one of its most savage witch-burnings]] in the Basque town of [[Logroño]] in 1610&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hadingham&quot;&gt;Hadingham 1992. Note that [[Logroño]] is not a Basque town, but it was the see of the [[diocese|diocesis]] covering [[Zugarramurdi]] in 1610. The [[Spanish Inquisition]] rarely acted against witches, devoting most of its attention to [[Juidaizers]], [[Morisco]]s and Protestants.&lt;/ref&gt;

This preference for female dominance existed well into the twentieth century: &quot;...[[matrilineal]] inheritance laws, and agricultural work performed by women continued in Basque country until the early twentieth century. For more than a century, scholars have widely discussed the high status of Basque women in law codes, as well as their positions as judges, inheritors, and arbitrators through pre-Roman, medieval, and modern times. The system of laws governing succession in the French Basque region reflected total equality between the sexes. Up until the eve of the French Revolution, the Basque woman was truly ‘the mistress of the house,’ hereditary guardian, and head of the lineage&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;treilo&quot;&gt;Gimbutas, M. ''The Living Goddesses'' University of California Press: 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[kingdom of Navarre]] did adopt feudalism, most Basques also possessed unusual social institutions different from those of feudal Europe. Some aspects of this include the [[elizate]] tradition where local house-owners met in front of the church to elect a representative to send to the ''juntas'' and ''[[Juntas Generales]]'' (such as the ''Juntas Generales de Vizcaya'' or ''Guipúzcoa'') which administered much larger areas. Another example was the fact that in the medieval period most land was owned by the farmers, not the Church or a king.&lt;ref name = &quot;kosvtz&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;oprmay&quot;&gt;Collins, R. ''The Basques'' Blackwell: 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports in the Basque Country==
===Pilota===
{{Main|Basque pelota}}
The great family of ball games has its unique offspring among Basque ball games, known generically as [[pilota]] (Spanish: ''pelota''). Some variants have been exported to the United States and [[Macau]] under the name of [[Jai Alai]].

===Rural sports===

[[Image:20060122 barrenak gora.jpg|thumb|250px|''Barrenatzaileak'' in [[Barakaldo]].]]
{{Main|Basque rural sports}}
There are several sports derived by Basques from everyday chores. Heavy workers were challenged and bets placed upon them. Examples are:
*''[[estropadak]]'' rowing regattas: from fishermen activities.
*''[[Basque rural sports#Sokatira (tug-of-war)|sokatira]]'': tug-of-war.
*''[[Harrijasotzaileak|harri jasoketa]]'': stone-lifting, from quarry works.
*''[[aizkolaritza]]'' and ''[[Basque rural sports#Trontza (sawing)|trontzalaritza]]'': wood-chopping and log sawing.
*''[[Basque rural sports#Sega jokoa (scything)|sega jokoa]]'': cutting grass with a [[scythe]].
*''[[Basque rural sports#Giza-abere probak (dragging games)|Giza-abere probak]]'': stone block pulling, from construction works:
**''[[idi probak]]'' with teams of oxen.
**''asto probak'' with donkeys.
**''zaldi probak'' with horses.
**''gizon probak'' with human teams.
*''[[Basque rural sports#Txinga eramatea (weight carrying)|txinga eramatea]]'': carrying of weights, one in each hand, representing milk canisters.
*''[[Basque rural sports#Ahari topeka (ram fighting)|aharai topaketa]]: ram fights.
*''[[Basque rural sports#Harri zulaketa (hole drilling)|harri zulaketa]]'' competitions: drilling stone blocks with a metal bar, only in the former mining areas of West Biscay.
*[[Basque rural sports#Txakur probak (sheepdog trials)|Basque sheepdog trials]] competitions.

===Bull runs and bullock games===
The [[encierro]] (bull run) in [[Pamplona]]'s [[festival|fiesta]]s ''[[San Fermín|Sanfermines]]'' started as a transport of bulls to the ring. These encierros, as well as other bull and [[Cattle|bullock]] related activities are not exclusive to Pamplona but are traditional in many towns and villages of the Basque country.

===Football===
{{Main|Basque Country national football team}}
The largest symbol of Basque identity in football is [[Athletic Bilbao]]. While there are other clubs within the Spanish Basque country, such as [[Real Sociedad]], Bilbao's [[cantera]] policy has meant the club refuses to sign any non-Basque players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=2&amp;b=1&amp;c=1&amp;d=0&amp;idi=2 |title='&amp;#39;Athletic Club sporting philosophy'&amp;#39; |publisher=Athletic-club.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CA Osasuna]], from the neighbouring autonomous community of [[Navarre]], is the only club in [[La Liga]] that has a Basque name (''osasuna'' means &quot;health&quot;).

===Rugby Union===
[[Rugby union]] is a popular sport among French Basques, with major clubs [[Biarritz Olympique]] and [[Aviron Bayonnais]] traditional powerhouses in the premier division of French Rugby (the [[Top 14]]). Biarritz regularly play [[Heineken Cup]] matches, especially knockout matches, at [[Estadio Anoeta]] in [[San Sebastián|San Sebastian]]. Games between the Basque clubs and Catalan club [[USA Perpignan]] are always hard fought.

===Professional Cycling===
Cycling is popular and the [[Euskaltel-Euskadi]] professional cycling team participates in the UCI Pro Tour division. Known for their orange tops, their fans are famous for lining the most famous Pyrenean climbs in the Tour de France, in support of their compatriots.

Each April the weeklong [[Tour of the Basque Country]] showcases the beautiful rolling Basque countryside.

==Politics==
{{Main|Basque Country (greater region)}}
While there is no independent Basque state, Spain's [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of the Basque Country, made up of the provinces of Álava (Araba), Vizcaya (Bizkaia) and Guipúzcoa (Gipuzkoa), is primarily a historical consequence and an answer to the wide autonomy claim of the residents.

Navarre has a separate statute of autonomy, also based on the historical medieval [[fuero]]s. Until recently, Basque only survived in the Northern part of Navarre in the areas designated as Basque speaking or mixed in Navarrese law. Questions of political, linguistic and ethnic allegiance and identity are highly complex in Navarre. Politically some Basque nationalists would like to integrate with the Autonomous Basque Community but this currently is not the view of the majority of the people of Navarre.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The [[Northern Basque Country]] today does not exist as a formal political entity and is officially simply part of the French [[department (country subdivision)|department]] of [[Pyrénées Atlantiques]], centered in [[Béarn]]. In recent years the number of mayors of the region supporting the creation of a separate Basque department has grown to 63,87%{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. So far, their attempts have been unsuccessful.

==Political conflicts==
===Language===
{{Main|Basque language}}

Both Spanish and French governments have, at times, tried to suppress Basque [[natural language|linguistic]] and cultural identity. The [[French Republics (disambiguation)|French Republics]], the epitome of the [[nation-state]], have a long history of attempting the complete cultural absorption of ethnic minority groups. Spain has, at most points in its history, granted some degree of linguistic, cultural, and even political autonomy to its Basques, but under the [[Spain under Franco|regime of Francisco Franco]], the Spanish government reversed the advances of Basque nationalism, as it had fought in the opposite side of the [[Spanish Civil War]]: cultural activity in Basque was limited to folkloric issues and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

Today, the Basque Country within Spain enjoys an extensive cultural and political autonomy. The majority of schools under the jurisdiction of the [[Basque education system]] use Basque as the primary medium of teaching. However, the situation is more delicate in the North, where lack of autonomy and monolingual public schooling in French exert great pressure on the Basque language.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

However, in Navarre, Basque has been declared an endangered language, since the conservative government of ''[[Unión del Pueblo Navarro]]'' opposes Basque nationalism and symbols of Basqueness, highlighting Navarre's own autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Resolution of the General Assembly of the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages, 13 September 2003 (Helsinki), on the situation of the Basque language in the Autonomous Community of Navarre. Reported in MERCATOR Butlleti 55: &quot;Speakers of a regional or minority language should have the right to use their language in private and public life. Contrary to these principles, local authorities from Iruña/Pamplona (capital city of the Autonomous Community of [[Navarre]] in Spain) have been implementing a series of reforms to the Autonomous Community legislation limiting the use of the Basque language. Basque is the only endangered language in the Autonomous Community of Navarre...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Basque is also spoken by immigrants in the major cities of Spain and France, in [[Australia]], in many parts of [[Latin America]], and in the [[United States]], especially in Nevada, Idaho and California.&lt;ref&gt;[[Larry Trask|TRASK, Robert Lawrence]] (1997), ''The history of Basque'', Routledge, [http://books.google.es/books?id=OiemTo_t5r8C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Nevada,+Idaho+California+basque-speakers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4YWwosuCXy&amp;sig=QrOCCYECkfkNXOvlSKDc6jDI4GY&amp;hl=eu&amp;ei=iym5TZLFHsmW8QPzs6FB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Nevada%2C%20Idaho%20California%20basque-speakers&amp;f=false p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political status and violence===
Since its articulation by Sabino Arana in the late 19th century, the more radical currents of [[Basque nationalism]] have demanded the right of [[self-determination]] and even [[independence]]. Within the Basque country, that this element of Basque politics is often in balance with the conception of the Basque Country as just another part of the Spanish state, a view more commonly espoused on the right of the political spectrum. In contrast, the desire for greater autonomy and/or independence is particularly common among [[left-wing politics|leftist]] Basque nationalists. The right of self-determination was asserted by the [[Basque Parliament]] in 2002 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eitb24.com/portal/eitb24/noticia/en/politics/pp-and-pse-voted-against-basque-parliament-adopts-resolution-on-s?itemId=B24_18787&amp;cl=%2Feitb24%2Fpolitica&amp;idioma=en EITB: ''Basque parliament adopts resolution on self-determination'']&lt;/ref&gt;
Since self-determination is not recognized in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], a wide majority of Basques abstained (55%) and some even voted against it (23.5%) in the referendum of December 6 of that year. However, it was approved by clear [[majority]] at the Spanish level (87%). The derived autonomous regimes for the (Western) Basque Country was approved in a later referendum but the autonomy of Navarre (''amejoramiento del fuero'': &quot;improvement of the charter&quot;) was never subject to a referendum but only approved by the Navarrese Cortes (parliament).

==Classification==
As with their language, the Basques are clearly a distinct ethnic group in their region. They notably regard themselves as culturally and especially linguistically distinct from their surrounding neighbours. Some Basques, especially in Spain, are strongly nationalist, identifying far more firmly as Basques than as citizens of any existing state. Others are not, feeling as much Basque as Spanish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Euskobarómetro&quot;&gt;[[Euskobarómetro]] series, ''[http://www.ehu.es/cpvweb/pags_directas/euskobarometroFR.html Evolución de la identidad nacional subjetiva de los vascos, 1981-2006]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}''. &quot;As Basque as Spanish&quot; shows 33% of the citizens of the Basque Autonomous Community in late 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Basques regard designation as an &quot;ethnic minority&quot; as incomplete, favouring instead the definition as a nation.

In modern times, as a European people living in a highly industrialized area, cultural differences from the rest of Europe are inevitably blurred, although a conscious cultural identity as a people or nation remains very strong, as does an identification with their homeland, even among many Basques who have emigrated to other parts of Spain or France, or to other parts of the world.

The strongest distinction between the Basques and their traditional neighbours is linguistic. Surrounded by [[Romance languages|Romance-language]] speakers, the Basques traditionally spoke (and many still speak) a language that was not only non-Romance but non-Indo-European. Although the evidence is open to question, the prevailing belief among Basques, and forming part of their national identity, is that their language has continuity with the people who were in this region not merely in pre-Roman times, but in pre-Celtic times, quite possibly before the great invasions of Europe by Asian tribes.

==Genetics==

Although they are genetically distinctive in some ways, the Basques are still very typically West European in terms of their Y-DNA and mtDNA sequences, and in terms of some other genetic [[Locus (genetics)|loci]]. These same sequences are widespread throughout the western half of Europe, especially along the western fringe of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www3.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html Atlas of the Human Journey - The Genographic Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dupanloup2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pericic |first1=M. |last2=Lauc |first2=LB |last3=Klarić |first3=IM |last4=Rootsi |first4=S |last5=Janićijevic |first5=B |last6=Rudan |first6=I |last7=Terzić |first7=R |last8=Colak |first8=I |last9=Kvesić |first9=A |title=High-Resolution Phylogenetic Analysis of Southeastern Europe Traces Major Episodes of Paternal Gene Flow Among Slavic Populations |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=1964–75 |year=2005 |pmid=15944443 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msi185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However that study done by Balaresque and others.(2009) had many biases and more recent studies have proven that Subclades of R1b1b2 might have originated on Western Europe during the Holocene before the Neolithic Expansion. According to Myres and others.(2010): &quot;The coalescent estimate for the Y-STR network tree of 245 M269*+L23(xM412) chromosomes is 10 270±1680 years Before Present (BP)&quot; Clearly predating the Neolithic Expansion from Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Myres |first1=Natalie M |last2=Rootsi |first2=Siiri |last3=Lin |first3=Alice A |last4=Järve |first4=Mari |last5=King |first5=Roy J |last6=Kutuev |first6=Ildus |last7=Cabrera |first7=Vicente M |last8=Khusnutdinova |first8=Elza K |last9=Pshenichnov |first9=Andrey |title=A major Y-chromosome haplogroup R1b Holocene era founder effect in Central and Western Europe |journal=European Journal of Human Genetics |year=2010 |doi=10.1038/ejhg.2010.146 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=95–101 |pmid=20736979 |pmc=3039512}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study done by Cruciani and others. (2010) has also confirmed that there is a clear dichotomy between the Western-Eastern branches of R1b1b2, and many scientist now consider that R1b1b2 might have in fact originated in southeastern Europe in the Upper Paleolithic time, expanding from there to Western Europe and Anatolia. According to Cruciani and others. (2010):{{quote|The overall frequency pattern of theR1b1b2 sub-haplogroups here analyzed is compatible with several scenarios, including mutation surfing on the wave of advance of an expanding population and/or local bottlenecks and re-expansion from refuge areas.

The majority (58.7%) of R1b1b2 chromosomes from Europe were found to be ancestral for both U106 and U152 (paragroup R1b1b2*) and showed a frequency cline from western to eastern Europe. Further studies are needed to refine the R1b1b2 phylogeny and fully disclose the micro-evolutionary events underlying the present frequency distribution of R1b1b2 sub-haplogroups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cruciani |first1=Fulvio |last2=Trombetta |first2=Beniamino |last3=Antonelli |first3=Cheyenne |last4=Pascone |first4=Roberto |last5=Valesini |first5=Guido |last6=Scalzi |first6=Valentina |last7=Vona |first7=Giuseppe |last8=Melegh |first8=Bela |last9=Zagradisnik |first9=Boris |title=Strong intra- and inter-continental differentiation revealed by Y chromosome SNPs M269, U106 and U152 |journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics |year=2010 |doi=10.1016/j.fsigen.2010.07.006 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=e49–e52}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In regards to the presence of R1b1b2(R-M269) in Basque and other Western Europeans a more recent study states:{{quote|A recent network analysis of the R-M269 Y chromosome lineage has purportedly corroborated Neolithic expansion from Anatolia, the site of diffusion of agriculture. However, the data are still controversial and the analyses so far performed are prone to a number of biases. In the present study we show that the addition of a single marker, DYSA7.2, dramatically changes the shape of the R-M269 network into a topology showing a clear Western-Eastern dichotomy not consistent with a radial diffusion of people from the Middle East. We have also assessed other Y-chromosome haplogroups proposed to be markers of the Neolithic diffusion of farmers and compared their intra-lineage variation — defined by short tandem repeats (STRs) — in Anatolia and in Sardinia, the only Western population where these lineages are present at appreciable frequencies and where there is substantial archaeological and genetic evidence of pre-Neolithic human occupation. The data indicate that Sardinia does not contain a subset of the variability present in Anatolia and that the shared variability between these populations is best explained by an earlier, pre-Neolithic dispersal of haplogroups from a common ancestral gene pool. Overall, these results are consistent with the cultural diffusion and do not support the demic model of agriculture diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morelli |first1=Laura |last2=Contu |first2=Daniela |last3=Santoni |first3=Federico |last4=Whalen |first4=Michael B. |last5=Francalacci |first5=Paolo |last6=Cucca |first6=Francesco |last7=Lalueza-Fox |first7=Carles |title=A Comparison of Y-Chromosome Variation in Sardinia and Anatolia is More Consistent with Cultural Rather than Demic Diffusion of Agriculture |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=e10419 |year=2010 |pmid=20454687 |pmc=2861676 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010419 |editor1-last=Lalueza-Fox |editor1-first=Carles}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Autosomal genetic studies confirm that Basques have a very close relationship with other [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]], especially with [[Spaniard]]s, who have a common genetic identity of over 70% with Basques.&lt;ref name=Dupanloup2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dupanloup |first1=I. |last2=Bertorelle |first2=G |last3=Chikhi |first3=L |last4=Barbujani |first4=G |title=Estimating the Impact of Prehistoric Admixture on the Genome of Europeans |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=1361–72 |year=2004 |pmid=15044595 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msh135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, according to a Europe-wide study, the main components in the European genomes appear to derive from ancestors whose features were similar to those of modern Basques and [[Near East]]erners, with average values greater than 35% for both these parental populations, regardless of whether or not molecular information is taken into account. The lowest degree of both Basque and Near Eastern admixture is found in Finland, whereas the highest values are, respectively, 70% &quot;Basque&quot; in Spain and more than 60% &quot;[[Near East]]ern&quot; in the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/7/1361/T3.expansion |title=Table 3: Weighted Average Across Loci, and Standard Deviations (SD), of the Estimated Contributions of 4 Parental Populations to European Populations}} from: {{cite journal |last1=Dupanloup |first1=I. |last2=Bertorelle |first2=G |last3=Chikhi |first3=L |last4=Barbujani |first4=G |title=Estimating the Impact of Prehistoric Admixture on the Genome of Europeans |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=1361–72 |year=2004 |pmid=15044595 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msh135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the development of modern [[genetics]] based on [[DNA sequencing]], Basques were noted as having the highest global apportion of the [[Rhesus factor|Rh]] blood type (35% phenotypically, 60% genetically). Additionally, the Basque population has virtually no [[ABO blood group system|B blood type]], nor the related AB type. These differences are thought to reflect their long history of isolation, as well as times during which the Basque population contracted, allowing [[genetic drift]] to dramatically influence genetic makeup. The history of isolation reflected in gene frequencies has presumably also been key to the retention of the distinctive Basque language. In fact, in accordance with other genetic studies, a recent genetic piece of research from 2007 claims: &quot;The Spanish and Basque groups are the furthest away from other continental groups (with more diversity within the same genetic groups) which is consistent with the suggestions that the Iberian peninsula holds the most ancient West European genetic ancestry.&quot;

Since the Basques speak a non-Indo-European language and have the highest proportion of the [[Rh negative]] blood type of all the peoples of the world, they were widely considered to be a genetically isolated population, preserving the genes of European Paleolithic hunter-gatherers, until recent genetic studies found that modern Basques have a common ancestry with other Western Europeans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Santos Alonso 2005&quot;/&gt;

A study done in May, 2010 has shown homogeneity of Spanish and French Basques, and confirmed their genomic distinctiveness from other European populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rodríguez-Ezpeleta |first1=Naiara |last2=Álvarez-Busto |first2=Jon |last3=Imaz |first3=Liher |last4=Regueiro |first4=María |last5=Azcárate |first5=María Nerea |last6=Bilbao |first6=Roberto |last7=Iriondo |first7=Mikel |last8=Gil |first8=Ana |last9=Estonba |first9=Andone |title=High-density SNP genotyping detects homogeneity of Spanish and French Basques, and confirms their genomic distinctiveness from other European populations |journal=Human Genetics |volume=128 |issue=1 |pages=113–7 |year=2010 |pmid=20443121 |doi=10.1007/s00439-010-0833-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bookkeeping''' is the recording of financial transactions. Transactions include sales, purchases, income, and payments by an individual or organization. Bookkeeping is usually performed by a bookkeeper. Bookkeeping should not be confused with [[accountancy|accounting]]. The accounting process is usually performed by an [[accountant]]. The accountant creates reports from the recorded financial transactions recorded by the bookkeeper and files forms with government agencies. There are some common methods of bookkeeping such as the [[Single-entry bookkeeping system]] and the [[Double-entry bookkeeping system]]. But while these systems may be seen as &quot;real&quot; bookkeeping, any process that involves the recording of financial transactions is a bookkeeping process.

A bookkeeper (or book-keeper), also known as an accounting clerk or accounting technician, is a person who records the day-to-day financial transactions of an organization. A bookkeeper is usually responsible for writing the &quot;daybooks.&quot; The daybooks consist of purchases, sales, receipts, and payments. The bookkeeper is responsible for ensuring all transactions are recorded in the correct day book, suppliers ledger, customer ledger and general ledger. The bookkeeper brings the books to the [[trial balance]] stage. An accountant may prepare the [[income statement]] and [[balance sheet]] using the trial balance and ledgers prepared by the bookkeeper

== Bookkeeping systems ==
Two common bookkeeping systems used by businesses and other organizations are the [[single-entry bookkeeping system]] and the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]]. Single-entry bookkeeping uses only income and expense [[Account (accountancy)|account]]s, recorded primarily in a revenue and expense journal. Single-entry bookkeeping is adequate for many small businesses. Double-entry bookkeeping requires posting (recording) each transaction twice, using [[debits and credits]].

===Single-entry system===
The primary bookkeeping record in single-entry bookkeeping is the cash book, which is similar to a checking (cheque) account register but allocates the income and expenses to various income and expense accounts. Separate account records are maintained for petty cash, accounts payable and receivable, and other relevant transactions such as [[inventory]] and travel expenses. These days, single entry bookkeeping can be done with DIY bookkeeping software to speed up manual calculations.

===Double-entry system===
{{main|double-entry bookkeeping system}}
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Please remember that this is a summary of the topic covered in the article on double-entry bookkeeping. --&gt;

==Daybooks==
A daybook is a descriptive and chronological (diary-like) record of day-to-day [[financial transactions]] also called a ''book of original entry''. The daybook's details must be entered formally into journals to enable posting to ledgers. Daybooks include:

*Sales daybook, for recording all the sales invoices.
*Sales credits daybook, for recording all the sales credit notes.
*Purchases daybook, for recording all the purchase invoices.
*Purchases credits daybook, for recording all the purchase credit notes.
*Cash daybook, usually known as the cash book, for recording all money received as well as money paid out. It may be split into two daybooks: receipts daybook for money received in, and payments daybook for money paid out.

==Petty cash book==
A [[petty cash]] book is a record of small value purchases usually controlled by [[imprest system]]. Items such as [[coffee]], [[tea]], birthday cards for employees, a few dollars if you're short on postage, are listed down in the [[petty cash]] book.

==Journals==
A [[Journal entry|journal]] is a formal and chronological record of [[financial transactions]] before their values are accounted for in the general ledger as [[debits and credits]]. A company can maintain one journal for all transactions, or keep several journals based on similar activity (i.e. sales, cash receipts, revenue, etc.) making transactions easier to summarize and reference later. For every [[debits and credits|debit]] journal entry recorded there must be an equivalent [[debits and credits|credit]] journal entry to maintain a balanced accounting equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Haber | first = Jeffry | title = Accounting Demystified | publisher = AMACOM | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 0814407900 | page = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ledgers==
A [[ledger]] is a record of [[Account (accountancy)|accounts]].  These accounts are recorded separately showing their beginning/ending [[Balance (accounting)|balance]]. A journal lists [[financial transactions]] in chronological order without showing their balance but showing how much is going to be charged in each account.  A ledger takes each [[financial transactions]] from the journal and records them into the corresponding account for every transaction listed.  The ledger also sums up the total of every account which is transferred into the [[balance sheet]] and [[income statement]]. There are 3 different kinds of ledgers that deal with book-keeping. Ledgers include:
*Sales ledger, which deals mostly with the Accounts Receivable account.  This ledger consists of the financial transactions made by customers to the business.
*Purchase ledger is a ledger that goes hand and hand with the Accounts Payable account.  This is the purchasing transaction a company does.
*General ledger representing the original 5 main accounts: [[assets]], [[liabilities]], [[Equity (finance)|equity]], [[income]], and [[expenses]]

==Chart of accounts==
A [[chart of accounts]] is a list of the [[Account (accountancy)|accounts]] codes that can be identified with numeric, alphabetical, or alphanumeric codes allowing the account to be located in the general ledger.

==Computerized bookkeeping==
Computerized bookkeeping removes many of the paper &quot;books&quot; that are used to record transactions and usually enforces [[double-entry bookkeeping system|double entry bookkeeping]].

==Online bookkeeping==
Online bookkeeping, or remote bookkeeping, allows source documents and data to reside in web-based applications which allow remote access for bookkeepers and accountants. All entries made into the online software are recorded and stored in a remote location. The online software can be accessed from any location in the world and permit the bookkeeper or data entry person to work from any location with a suitable data communications link.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Bezier curve.svg|thumb|right|300px|Cubic Bézier curve]]
A '''Bézier curve''' is a [[parametric curve]] frequently used in [[computer graphics]] and related fields.  Generalizations of Bézier curves to higher [[dimension]]s are called [[Bézier surface]]s, of which the [[Bézier triangle]] is a special case.

In [[vector graphics]], Bézier curves are used to model smooth curves that can be scaled indefinitely. &quot;Paths,&quot; as they are commonly referred to in image manipulation programs,&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Image manipulation programs such as [[Inkscape]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], and [[GIMP]].&lt;/ref&gt; are combinations of linked Bézier curves. Paths are not bound by the limits of [[rasterized image]]s and are intuitive to modify. Bézier curves are also used in [[animation]] as a tool to control motion.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;In animation applications such as [[Adobe Flash]], [[Adobe After Effects]], [[Microsoft Expression Blend]], [[Blender (software)|Blender]], [[Autodesk Maya]] and [[Autodesk 3ds max]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Bézier curves are also used in the time domain, particularly in animation and interface design, e.g., a Bézier curve can be used to specify the velocity over time of an object such as an icon moving from A to B, rather than simply moving at a fixed number of pixels per step. When animators or [[Graphical user interface|interface]] designers talk about the &quot;physics&quot; or &quot;feel&quot; of an operation, they may be referring to the particular Bézier curve used to control the velocity over time of the move in question.

Bézier curves were widely publicized in 1962 by the [[France|French]] engineer [[Pierre Bézier]], who used them to design [[automobile]] bodies.  The curves were first developed in 1959 by [[Paul de Casteljau]] using [[de Casteljau's algorithm]], a [[numerical stability|numerically stable]] method to evaluate Bézier curves.

==Applications==
===Computer graphics===

[[Image:Bézier curve in Adobe Illustrator CS2.png|left|thumb|Bézier path in [[Adobe Illustrator]]]]
Bézier curves are widely used in computer graphics to model smooth curves. As the curve is completely contained in the [[convex hull]] of its control points, the points can be graphically displayed and used to manipulate the curve intuitively. [[Affine transformation]]s such as [[translation (geometry)|translation]], and [[rotation]] can be applied on the curve by applying the respective transform on the control points of the curve.

Quadratic and cubic Bézier curves are most common; higher degree curves are more expensive to evaluate. When more complex shapes are needed, low order Bézier curves are patched together. This is commonly referred to as a &quot;path&quot; in [[vector graphics]] standards (like [[SVG]]) and vector graphics programs (like [[Adobe Illustrator]] and [[Inkscape]]). To guarantee smoothness, the control point at which two curves meet must be on the line between the two control points on either side.

The simplest method for scan converting ([[Rasterisation|rasterizing]]) a Bézier curve is to evaluate it at many closely spaced points and scan convert the approximating sequence of line segments. However, this does not guarantee that the rasterized output looks sufficiently smooth, because the points may be spaced too far apart. Conversely it may generate too many points in areas where the curve is close to linear. A common adaptive method is recursive subdivision, in which a curve's control points are checked to see if the curve approximates a line segment to within a small tolerance. If not, the curve is subdivided parametrically into two segments, 0 ≤ ''t'' ≤ 0.5 and 0.5 ≤ ''t'' ≤ 1, and the same procedure is applied recursively to each half. There are also forward differencing methods, but great care must be taken to analyse error propagation. Analytical methods where a [[Spline (mathematics)|spline]] is intersected with each scan line involve finding roots of cubic polynomials (for cubic splines) and dealing with multiple roots, so they are not often used in practice.

===Animation===
In animation applications, such as [[Adobe Flash]] and [[Synfig]], Bézier curves are used to outline, for example, movement. Users outline the wanted path in Bézier curves, and the application creates the needed frames for the object to move along the path.
For 3D animation Bézier curves are often used to define 3D paths as well as 2D curves for keyframe interpolation.

===Fonts===
[[TrueType]] fonts use [[Bézier spline]]s composed of quadratic Bézier curves.

Modern imaging systems like [[PostScript]], [[Asymptote (vector graphics language)|Asymptote]] and [[Metafont]] use [[Bézier spline]]s composed of cubic Bézier curves for drawing curved shapes. The &quot;smooth curve&quot; feature of charts in [[Microsoft Excel]] also use this algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xlrotor.com/resources/files.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examination of cases==
===Linear Bézier curves===
Given points '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, a linear Bézier curve is simply a [[straight line]] between those two points. The curve is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}(t)=\mathbf{P}_0 + t(\mathbf{P}_1-\mathbf{P}_0)=(1-t)\mathbf{P}_0 + t\mathbf{P}_1 \mbox{ , } t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;
and is equivalent to [[linear interpolation]].

===Quadratic Bézier curves===
A quadratic Bézier curve is the path traced by the function '''B'''(''t''), given points '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}(t) = (1 - t)^{2}\mathbf{P}_0 + 2(1 - t)t\mathbf{P}_1 + t^{2}\mathbf{P}_2 \mbox{ , } t \in [0,1].&lt;/math&gt;

It departs from '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the direction of '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then bends to arrive at '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the direction from '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  In other words, the tangents in '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; both pass through '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This is directly seen from the derivative of the Bézier curve:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}'(t) = 2 (1 - t) (\mathbf{P}_1 - \mathbf{P}_0) + 2 t (\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

A quadratic Bézier curve is also a [[parabola|parabolic]] segment.

===Cubic Bézier curves===
Four points '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the plane or in three-dimensional space define a cubic Bézier curve.
The curve starts at '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; going toward '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and arrives at '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coming from the direction of '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Usually, it will not pass through '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; these points are only there to provide directional information. The distance between '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; determines &quot;how long&quot; the curve moves into direction '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; before turning towards '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

The [[Parametric equation|parametric]] form of the curve is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}(t)=(1-t)^3\mathbf{P}_0+3(1-t)^2t\mathbf{P}_1+3(1-t)t^2\mathbf{P}_2+t^3\mathbf{P}_3 \mbox{ , } t \in [0,1].&lt;/math&gt;

For some choices of '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the curve may intersect itself, or contain a cusp.

==Generalization==
The Bézier curve of degree ''n'' can be generalized as follows. Given points '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,..., '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the Bézier curve is

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{B}(t) &amp; = \sum_{i=0}^n {n\choose i}(1-t)^{n-i}t^i\mathbf{P}_i \\
&amp; = (1-t)^n\mathbf{P}_0 + {n\choose 1}(1-t)^{n-1}t\mathbf{P}_1 + \cdots \\
&amp; {} \quad \cdots + {n\choose n-1}(1-t)t^{n-1}\mathbf{P}_{n-1} + t^n\mathbf{P}_n,\quad t \in [0,1],
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle {n \choose i}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[binomial coefficient]].

For example, for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{B}(t) &amp; = (1-t)^5\mathbf{P}_0 + 5t(1-t)^4\mathbf{P}_1 + 10t^2(1-t)^3 \mathbf{P}_2 \\
&amp; {} \quad + 10t^3 (1-t)^2 \mathbf{P}_3 + 5t^4(1-t) \mathbf{P}_4 + t^5 \mathbf{P}_5,\quad t \in [0,1].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This formula can be expressed recursively as follows:
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{P}_0\mathbf{P}_1\ldots\mathbf{P}_n}&lt;/math&gt; denote the Bézier curve determined by the points '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;'''P'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  Then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}(t) = \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{P}_0\mathbf{P}_1\ldots\mathbf{P}_n}(t) = (1-t)\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{P}_0\mathbf{P}_1\ldots\mathbf{P}_{n-1}}(t) + t\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{P}_1\mathbf{P}_2\ldots\mathbf{P}_n}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the degree-''n'' Bézier curve is a [[linear interpolation]] between two degree-(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) Bézier curves.

===Terminology===
Some terminology is associated with these parametric curves. We have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}(t) = \sum_{i=0}^n \mathbf{b}_{i,n}(t)\mathbf{P}_i,\quad t\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;

where the polynomials

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}_{i,n}(t) = {n\choose i} t^i (1-t)^{n-i},\quad i=0,\ldots n&lt;/math&gt;

are known as [[Bernstein polynomial|Bernstein basis polynomials]] of degree ''n'', defining ''t''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''t'')&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.  The [[binomial coefficient]], &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle {n \choose i}&lt;/math&gt;, has the alternative notation,

:&lt;math&gt;^n\mathbf{C}_i = {n \choose i} = \frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

The points '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are called ''control points'' for the Bézier curve. The [[polygon]] formed by connecting the Bézier points
with [[line (mathematics)|lines]], starting with '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and finishing with '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, is called the ''Bézier polygon'' (or ''control polygon''). The [[convex hull]] of the Bézier polygon contains the Bézier curve.

*The curve begins at '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ends at '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;; this is the so-called ''endpoint interpolation'' property.
*The curve is a straight line if and only if all the control points are [[Incidence (geometry)#Collinearity|collinear]].
* The start (end) of the curve is [[tangent]] to the first (last) section of the Bézier polygon.
* A curve can be split at any point into two subcurves, or into arbitrarily many subcurves, each of which is also a Bézier curve.
* Some curves that seem simple, such as the [[circle]], cannot be described exactly by a Bézier or [[piecewise]] Bézier curve; though a four-piece cubic Bézier curve can approximate a circle, with a maximum radial error of less than one part in a thousand, when each inner control point (or offline point) is the distance &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{4\left(\sqrt {2}-1\right)}{3}&lt;/math&gt; horizontally or vertically from an outer control point on a unit circle.  More generally, an ''n''-piece cubic Bézier curve can approximate a circle, when each inner control point is the distance &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{4}{3}\tan(t/4)&lt;/math&gt; from an outer control point on a unit circle, where ''t'' is 360/''n'' degrees, and ''n'' &gt; 2.
* The curve at a fixed offset from a given Bézier curve, often called an ''offset curve'' (lying &quot;parallel&quot; to the original curve, like the offset between rails in a [[railroad track]]), cannot be exactly formed by a Bézier curve (except in some trivial cases). However, there are [[heuristic]] methods that usually give an adequate approximation for practical purposes. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
*Every quadratic Bézier curve is also a cubic Bézier curve, and more generally, every degree ''n'' Bézier curve is also a degree ''m'' curve for any ''m'' &gt; ''n''. In detail, a degree ''n'' curve with control points '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, …, '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent (including the parametrization) to the degree ''n'' + 1 curve with control points '''P''''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, …, '''P''''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf P'_k=\tfrac{k}{n+1}\mathbf P_{k-1}+\left(1-\tfrac{k}{n+1}\right)\mathbf P_k&lt;/math&gt;.

==Constructing Bézier curves==
===Linear curves===

The ''t'' in the function for a linear Bézier curve can be thought of as describing how far '''B'''(''t'') is from '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. For example when ''t=0.25'', '''B'''(''t'') is one quarter of the way from point '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. As ''t'' varies from 0 to 1, '''B'''(''t'') describes a straight line from '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Quadratic curves===
For quadratic Bézier curves one can construct intermediate points '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; such that as ''t'' varies from 0 to 1:
* Point '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; varies from '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and describes a linear Bézier curve.
* Point '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; varies from '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and describes a linear Bézier curve.
* Point '''B'''(''t'') varies from '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and describes a quadratic Bézier curve.

===Higher-order curves===
For higher-order curves one needs correspondingly more intermediate points. For cubic curves one can construct intermediate points '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,  '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that describe linear Bézier curves, and points '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that describe quadratic Bézier curves:

For fourth-order curves one can construct intermediate points '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,  '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that describe linear Bézier curves, points '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that describe quadratic Bézier curves, and points '''S'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; '''S'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that describe cubic Bézier curves:

==Degree elevation==
A Bézier curve of degree ''n'' can be converted into a Bézier curve of degree ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 '''with the same shape'''. This is useful if software supports Bézier curves only of specific degree. For example, you can draw a quadratic Bézier curve with [[Cairo (graphics)|Cairo]], which supports only cubic Bézier curves.

To do degree elevation, we use equality &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}(t) = (1-t)\mathbf{B}(t) + t\mathbf{B}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Each component &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}_{i,n}(t)\mathbf{P}_i&lt;/math&gt; is multiplied by (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''t'') or&amp;nbsp;''t'', thus increasing a degree by one. Here is the example of increasing degree from 2 to&amp;nbsp;3.

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; {} \quad (1 - t)^{2}\mathbf{P}_0 + 2(1 - t)t\mathbf{P}_1 + t^{2}\mathbf{P}_2 \\
&amp; = (1 - t)^{3}\mathbf{P}_0 + (1 - t)^{2}t\mathbf{P}_0 + 2(1 - t)^{2}t\mathbf{P}_1 \\
&amp; {} \qquad + 2(1 - t)t^{2}\mathbf{P}_1 + (1 - t)t^{2}\mathbf{P}_2 + t^{3}\mathbf{P}_2 \\
&amp; = (1 - t)^{3}\mathbf{P}_0
+ 3(1 - t)^{2}t\frac{\mathbf{P}_0 + 2\mathbf{P}_1}{3}
+ 3(1 - t)t^{2}\frac{2\mathbf{P}_1 + \mathbf{P}_2}{3}
+ t^{3}\mathbf{P}_2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For arbitrary ''n'' we use equalities

:&lt;math&gt;{n+1 \choose i}(1-t)\mathbf{b}_{i,n} = {n \choose i} \mathbf{b}_{i,n+1},
\quad (1-t)\mathbf{b}_{i,n} = \frac{n+1-i}{n+1} \mathbf{b}_{i,n+1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{n+1 \choose i+1} t\mathbf{b}_{i,n} = {n \choose i} \mathbf{b}_{i+1,n+1},
\quad t\mathbf{b}_{i,n} = \frac{i+1}{n+1} \mathbf{b}_{i+1,n+1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{B}(t) &amp; = (1-t)\sum_{i=0}^n \mathbf{b}_{i,n}(t)\mathbf{P}_i
+ t\sum_{i=0}^n \mathbf{b}_{i,n}(t)\mathbf{P}_i \\
&amp; = \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{n+1-i}{n+1}\mathbf{b}_{i,n+1}(t)\mathbf{P}_i
+ \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{i+1}{n+1}\mathbf{b}_{i+1,n+1}(t)\mathbf{P}_i \\
&amp; = \sum_{i=0}^{n+1} \left(\frac{i}{n+1}\mathbf{P}_{i-1} + \frac{n+1-i}{n+1}\mathbf{P}_i\right) \mathbf{b}_{i,n+1}(t)
= \sum_{i=0}^{n+1} \mathbf{b}_{i,n+1}(t)\mathbf{P'}_i
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

introducing arbitrary &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}_{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore new control points are &lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P'}_i = \frac{i}{n+1}\mathbf{P}_{i-1} + \frac{n+1-i}{n+1}\mathbf{P}_i,\quad i=0,\ldots, n+1.&lt;/math&gt;

==Polynomial form==
Sometimes it is desirable to express the Bézier curve as a [[polynomial]] instead of a sum of less straightforward [[Bernstein polynomial]]s. Application of the [[binomial theorem]] to the definition of the curve followed by some rearrangement will yield:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{B}(t) = \sum_{j = 0}^n {t^j \mathbf{C}_j}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{C}_j = \frac{n!}{(n - j)!} \sum_{i = 0}^j \frac{(-1)^{i + j} \mathbf{P}_i}{i! (j - i)!} =
\prod_{m = 0}^{j - 1} (n - m) \sum_{i = 0}^j \frac{(-1)^{i + j} \mathbf{P}_i}{i! (j - i)!}
.&lt;/math&gt;

This could be practical if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}_j&lt;/math&gt; can be computed prior to many evaluations of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}(t)&lt;/math&gt;; however one should use caution as high order curves may lack [[numeric stability]] ([[de Casteljau's algorithm]] should be used if this occurs). Note that the [[empty product]] is 1.

==Rational Bézier curves==
[[Image:Rational Bezier curve-conic sections.svg|thumb|Sections of conic sections represented exactly by rational Bézier curves]]
The rational Bézier curve adds adjustable weights to provide closer approximations to arbitrary shapes. The numerator is a weighted Bernstein-form Bézier curve and the denominator is a weighted sum of [[Bernstein polynomial]]s. Rational Bézier curves can, among other uses, be used to represent segments of [[conic section]]s exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2000/AGraphHCI/SMEG/node5.html|title=Some Mathematical Elements of Graphics: Rational B-splines|author=Neil Dodgson|date=2000-09-25|accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given ''n'' + 1 control points '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, the rational Bézier curve can be described by:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{B}(t) =
\frac{
\sum_{i=0}^n b_{i,n}(t) \mathbf{P}_{i}w_i
}
{
\sum_{i=0}^n b_{i,n}(t) w_i
}
&lt;/math&gt;
or simply
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{B}(t) =
\frac{
\sum_{i=0}^n {n \choose i} t^i (1-t)^{n-i}\mathbf{P}_{i}w_i
}
{
\sum_{i=0}^n {n \choose i} t^i (1-t)^{n-i}w_i
}.
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], especially [[functional analysis]], a '''Banach algebra''', named after [[Stefan Banach]], is an [[associative algebra]] ''A'' over the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers which at the same time is also a [[Banach space]]. The algebra multiplication and the Banach space norm are required to be related by the following inequality:
:&lt;math&gt; \forall x, y \in A : \|x \, y\| \ \leq  \|x \| \, \| y\| &lt;/math&gt;
(i.e., the norm of the product is less than or equal to the product of the norms).
This ensures that the multiplication operation is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]].

If in the above we relax [[Banach space]] to [[normed space]] the analogous structure is called a '''normed algebra'''.

A Banach algebra is called &quot;unital&quot; if it has an [[identity element]] for the multiplication whose norm is 1, and &quot;commutative&quot; if its multiplication is [[commutative]].
Any Banach algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (whether it has an [[identity element]] or not) can be embedded isometrically into a unital Banach algebra &lt;math&gt;A_e&lt;/math&gt; so as to form a closed ideal of &lt;math&gt;A_e&lt;/math&gt;. Often one assumes a priori that the algebra under consideration is unital: for one can develop much of the theory by considering &lt;math&gt;A_e&lt;/math&gt; and then applying the outcome in the original algebra. However, this is not the case all the time. For example, one cannot define all the trigonometric functions in a Banach algebra without identity.

The theory of real Banach algebras can be very different from the theory of complex Banach algebras. For example, the [[Spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] of an element of a complex Banach algebra can never be empty, whereas in a real Banach algebra it could be empty for some elements.

Banach algebras can also be defined over fields of [[p-adic number]]s. This is part of [[p-adic analysis]].

== Examples ==
The prototypical example of a Banach algebra is &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt;, the space of (complex-valued) continuous functions on a locally compact (Hausdorff) space that vanish at infinity. &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; is unital if and only if ''X'' is compact. The complex conjugation being an involution, &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; is in fact a C*-algebra. More generally, every C*-algebra is a Banach algebra.

* The set of real (or complex) numbers is a Banach algebra with norm given by the [[absolute value]].
* The set of all real or complex ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] becomes a [[unital algebra|unital]] Banach algebra if we equip it with a sub-multiplicative [[matrix norm]].
* Take the Banach space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;  (or '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) with norm ||''x''|| = max |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;| and define multiplication componentwise: (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).
* The [[quaternion]]s form a 4-dimensional real Banach algebra, with the norm being given by the absolute value of quaternions.
* The algebra of all bounded real- or complex-valued functions defined on some set (with pointwise multiplication and the [[supremum]] norm) is a unital Banach algebra.
* The algebra of all bounded [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] real- or complex-valued functions on some [[locally compact space]] (again with pointwise operations and supremum norm) is a Banach algebra.
* The algebra of all [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[linear transformation|linear]] operators on a Banach space E (with functional composition as multiplication and the [[operator norm]] as norm) is a unital Banach algebra. The set of all compact operators on E is a closed ideal in this algebra.
* If ''G'' is a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]] and μ its [[Haar measure]], then the Banach space L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'') of all μ-integrable functions on ''G'' becomes a Banach algebra under the [[convolution]] ''xy''(''g'') = ∫ ''x''(''h'') ''y''(''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''g'') dμ(''h'') for ''x'', ''y'' in L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'').
* [[Uniform algebra]]: A Banach algebra that is a subalgebra of C(X) with the supremum norm and that contains the constants and separates the points of X (which must be a compact Hausdorff space).
* [[Uniform algebra|Natural Banach function algebra]]: A uniform algebra whose all characters are evaluations at points of X.
* [[C*-algebra]]: A Banach algebra that is a closed *-subalgebra of the algebra of bounded operators on some [[Hilbert space]].
* [[Measure algebra]]: A Banach algebra consisting of all [[Radon measure]]s on some [[locally compact group]], where the product of two measures is given by [[convolution]].

== Properties ==
Several [[list of functions|elementary functions]] which are defined via [[power series]] may be defined in any unital Banach algebra; examples include the [[exponential function]] and the [[trigonometric function]]s, and more generally any [[entire function]]. (In particular, the exponential map can be used to define [[abstract index group]]s.) The formula for the [[geometric series]] remains valid in general unital Banach algebras. The [[binomial theorem]] also holds for two commuting elements of a Banach algebra.

The set of [[invertible element]]s in any unital Banach algebra is an [[open set]], and the inversion operation on this set is continuous, (and hence homeomorphism) so that it forms a [[topological group]] under multiplication.

If a Banach algebra has unit '''1''', then '''1''' cannot be a commutator; i.e., &lt;math&gt;xy - yx \ne \mathbf{1}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;thinsp; for any ''x'', ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''A''.

The various algebras of functions given in the examples above have very different properties from standard examples of algebras such as the reals. For example:

* Every real Banach algebra which is a [[division algebra]] is isomorphic to the reals, the complexes, or the quaternions. Hence, the only complex Banach algebra which is a division algebra is the complexes. (This is known as the [[Gelfand-Mazur theorem]].)

* Every unital real Banach algebra with no [[zero divisor]]s, and in which every [[principal ideal]] is [[closed set|closed]], is isomorphic to the reals, the complexes, or the quaternions.

* Every commutative real unital [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] Banach algebra with no zero divisors is isomorphic to the real or complex numbers.

* Every commutative real unital Noetherian Banach algebra (possibly having zero divisors) is finite-dimensional.

* Permanently singular elements in Banach algebras are [[topological divisior of zero|topological divisors of zero]], ''i.e.'', considering extensions ''B'' of Banach algebras ''A'' some elements that are singular in the given algebra ''A'' have a multiplicative inverse element in a Banach algebra extension ''B''.  Topological divisors of zero in ''A'' are permanently singular in all Banach extension ''B'' of&amp;nbsp;''A''.

== Spectral theory ==
{{main|Spectral theory}}

Unital Banach algebras over the complex field provide a general setting to study spectral theory. The ''spectrum'' of an element ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''A'', denoted by &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x)&lt;/math&gt;, consists of all those complex [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s ''λ'' such that ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''λ'''''1''' is not invertible in ''A''.  The spectrum of any element ''x'' is a closed subset of the closed disc in '''C''' with radius ||''x''|| and center 0, and thus is  [[Compact space|compact]]. Moreover, the spectrum &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x)&lt;/math&gt; of an element ''x'' is [[non-empty]] and satisfies the [[spectral radius]] formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\sup \{ |\lambda| : \lambda \in \sigma(x) \} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \|x^n\|^{1/n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Given ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''A'', the [[holomorphic functional calculus]] allows to define ''ƒ''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;∈ ''A'' for any function ''ƒ'' [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] in a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x).&lt;/math&gt;  Furthermore, the spectral mapping theorem holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(f(x)) = f(\sigma(x)).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Takesaki, Theory of Operator Algebras I. Proposition 2.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Banach algebra ''A'' is the algebra L(''X'') of bounded linear operators on a complex Banach space ''X''&amp;thinsp; (e.g., the algebra of square matrices), the notion of the spectrum in ''A'' coincides with the usual one in the operator theory. For ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin; ''C''(''X'') (with a compact Hausdorff space&amp;nbsp;''X''), one sees that:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(f) = \{ f(t) : t \in X \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The norm of a normal element ''x'' of a C*-algebra coincides with its spectral radius.  This generalizes an analogous fact for normal operators.

Let ''A''&amp;thinsp; be a complex unital Banach algebra in which every non-zero element ''x'' is invertible (a division algebra).  For every ''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin; ''A'', there is ''λ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin; '''C''' such that
''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''λ'''''1''' is not invertible (because the spectrum of ''a'' is not empty) hence ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''λ'''''1'''&amp;nbsp;:  this algebra ''A'' is naturally isomorphic to '''C''' (the complex case of the Gelfand-Mazur theorem).

== Ideals and characters ==
Let ''A''&amp;thinsp; be a unital ''commutative'' Banach algebra over '''C'''. Since ''A'' is then a commutative ring with unit, every non-invertible element of ''A'' belongs to some maximal ideal of ''A''. Since a maximal ideal &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt; in ''A'' is closed, &lt;math&gt;A / \mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt; is a Banach algebra that is a field, and it follows from the Gelfand-Mazur theorem that there is a bijection between the set of all maximal ideals of ''A'' and the set &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt; of all nonzero homomorphisms from ''A''&amp;thinsp; to '''C'''. The set &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt; is called the &quot;[[structure space]]&quot; or &quot;character space&quot; of ''A'', and its members &quot;characters.&quot;

A character ''&amp;chi;'' is a linear functional on ''A'' which is at the same time multiplicative, ''χ''(''a''&amp;nbsp;''b'')&amp;nbsp;= ''χ''(''a'')&amp;nbsp;''&amp;chi;''(''b''), and satisfies ''χ''('''1''')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.  Every character is automatically continuous from ''A''&amp;thinsp; to '''C''', since the kernel of a character is a maximal ideal, which is closed. Moreover, the norm (''i.e.'', operator norm) of a character is one. Equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence on ''A'' (''i.e.'', the topology induced by the weak-* topology of&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;), the character space&amp;thinsp; &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a Hausdorff compact space.

For any ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈ ''A'',

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(x) = \sigma(\hat x)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat x&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gelfand representation]] of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; defined as follows:  &lt;math&gt;\hat x&lt;/math&gt; is the continuous function from &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt; to '''C''' given by &lt;math&gt;\hat x(\chi) = \chi(x).&lt;/math&gt;&amp;thinsp;  The spectrum of &lt;math&gt;\hat x,&lt;/math&gt; in the formula above, is the spectrum as element of the algebra&amp;thinsp; &lt;math&gt;C(\Delta(A))&lt;/math&gt;&amp;thinsp; of complex continuous functions on the compact space&amp;thinsp; &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A).&lt;/math&gt;&amp;thinsp; Explicitly, &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\hat x) = \{ \chi(x) : \chi \in \Delta(A) \}&lt;/math&gt;.

As an algebra, a unital commutative Banach algebra is [[semisimple algebra|semisimple]] (i.e., its [[Jacobson radical]] is zero) if and only if its Gelfand representation has trivial kernel. An important example of such an algebra is a commutative C*-algebra. In fact, when ''A'' is a commutative unital C*-algebra, the Gelfand representation is then an isometric *-isomorphism between ''A'' and &lt;math&gt;C(\Delta(A))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Proof: Since every element of a commutative C*-algebra is normal, the Gelfand representation is isometric; in particular, it is injective and its image is closed. But the image of the Gelfand representation is dense by the [[Stone-Weierstrass theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boris Leonidovich Pasternak''' ({{lang-ru|Бори́с Леони́дович Пастерна́к}}) (10 February 1890 – 30 May 1960) was a [[Nobel Prize]]-winning Russian and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] poet of [[Jewish people|Jewish]] descent, novelist and translator of [[Goethe]] and [[Shakespeare]]. In Russia, Pasternak is most celebrated as a poet. ''My Sister Life'', written in 1917, is  one of the most influential collections of poetry published in the [[Russian language]] in the 20th century. In the West he is best known for his epic novel ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'', a tragedy whose events span the last period of the [[Russian Empire]] and the early days of the [[Soviet Union]]. It was first translated and published in [[Italy]] in 1957.

==Early life==
Pasternak was born in Moscow on 10 February, (Gregorian), 1890 (Julian 29 January) into a wealthy and assimilated [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian-Jewish]] family.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Pasternak.html Boris Leonidovich Pasternak&lt;/ref&gt; His father was the famous artist, [[Leonid Pasternak]], professor at the [[Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture|Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture]], and his mother was [[Rosa Kaufman|Rosa (Raitza) Kaufman]], a concert pianist. Pasternak was brought up in a highly cosmopolitan and intellectual atmosphere: family friends and regular visitors to his childhood home included pianist and composer [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], composer and mystic [[Alexander Scriabin]], existentialist [[Lev Shestov]], poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], and writer [[Leo Tolstoy]]. Pasternak aspired first to be a composer, turned next to philosophy and then eventually to writing as his vocation.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sister My Life&quot; Boris Pasternak. Translated by C. Flayderman. Introduction by Robert Payne. Washington Square Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[image:Pasternak boris alex.jpg|thumb|250px|Boris (left) with his brother]]

Inspired by his neighbour [[Alexander Scriabin]], Pasternak resolved to become a composer and entered the [[Moscow Conservatory]]. In 1910 he abruptly left the conservatory for the [[University of Marburg]], where he studied under [[Neo-Kantian]] philosophers [[Hermann Cohen]] and [[Nicolai Hartmann]]. Although invited to become a scholar, he decided against making philosophy a profession and returned to Moscow in 1914. His first poetry collection, influenced by [[Alexander Blok]] and the [[Russian Futurists]], was published later the same year.

Pasternak's early verse cleverly dissimulates his preoccupation with [[Kant]]'s ideas. Its fabric includes striking alliterations, wild rhythmic combinations, day-to-day vocabulary, and hidden allusions to his favourite poets such as [[Rilke]], [[Lermontov]] and German Romantic poets.

During [[World War I]], he taught and worked at a chemical factory in [[Vsevolodovo-Vilve]] near [[Perm]], which undoubtedly provided him with material for ''Dr. Zhivago'' many years later. Unlike many of his relatives and friends, Pasternak did not leave Russia after the revolution. Instead, he was fascinated with the new ideas and possibilities that revolution brought to life.

==''My Sister Life''==
Pasternak spent the summer of 1917 living in the steppe country near [[Saratov]], where he fell in love. This passion resulted in the collection ''My Sister Life'', which he wrote over a period of three months, but was too embarrassed to publish for four years because of its novel style. When it finally was published in 1921, the book revolutionised Russian poetry. It made Pasternak the model for younger poets, and decisively changed the poetry of [[Osip Mandelshtam]], [[Marina Tsvetayeva]] and others.

Following ''My Sister Life'', Pasternak produced some hermetic pieces of uneven quality, including his masterpiece, the lyric cycle ''Rupture'' (1921). Authors such as [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Andrey Bely]], [[Anna Akhmatova]] and [[Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov|Vladimir Nabokov]] applauded Pasternak's poems as works of pure, unbridled inspiration. In the late 1920s, he also participated in the much celebrated tripartite correspondence with [[Rilke]] and [[Tsvetayeva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bayley|first=John|title=Big Three|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/5268|journal=[[The New York Review of Books]]| volume= 32|date= 5 December 1985|accessdate=28 September 2007|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ascension of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1929, Pasternak increasingly felt that his colourful style was at odds with the dictator's demand for [[Socialist Realism]]. He attempted to make his poetry more comprehensible to the censors by reworking his earlier pieces and starting two lengthy poems on the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Revolution]]. He also turned to prose and wrote several autobiographical stories, notably ''The Childhood of Luvers'' and ''Safe Conduct''.

==''Second Birth''==
[[Image:Mayakovsky Pasternak.jpg|thumb|250px|Pasternak (second from left) with friends including [[Lilya Brik]], [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] (third from left) and [[Mayakovsky]] (centre).]]
[[Image:Chukovski Pasternak.jpg|thumb|275px|Boris Pasternak (in the foreground) and [[Korney Chukovsky]] at the first Congress of the [[USSR Union of Writers|Soviet Union of Writers]] in 1934.]]
By 1932, Pasternak had strikingly reshaped his style to make it acceptable to the Soviet public and printed the new collection of poems aptly titled ''The Second Birth''. Although its Caucasian pieces were as brilliant as the earlier efforts, the book alienated the core of Pasternak's refined audience abroad, which was largely composed of [[anti-communist]] [[White emigres]]. He simplified his style and language even further for his next collection of verse, ''Early Trains'' (1943), which prompted his former patron, [[Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov|Vladimir Nabokov]], to mock Pasternak as a &quot;weeping Bolshevik&quot; and &quot;[[Emily Dickinson]] in trousers.&quot;

During the great purges of the later 1930s, Pasternak became increasingly disillusioned with Marxist ideals. He remained a close friend of [[Anna Akhmatova]], as well as [[Osip Mandelstam]]. Reluctant to conform to [[Socialist Realism]], Pasternak turned to translation. His work soon included [[William Shakespeare]] (''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[King Lear]]''), [[Goethe]] (''[[Faust]]''), [[Rilke]] (''Requiem für eine Freundin''), [[Paul Verlaine]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n poets. Pasternak's translations of Shakespeare remain very popular with the Russian public because of their colloquial, modernised dialogues, but critics accused him of &quot;pasternakizing&quot; the English playwright.

Although Pasternak was widely panned for excessive subjectivism, [[Joseph Stalin]] is said to have crossed Pasternak's name off an execution list during the 1930s Purges. According to Stalin's biographer, [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;He recognized that [[Osip Mandelstam|Mandelstam]], Pasternak, and [[Mikhail Bulgakov|Bulgakov]] were geniuses, but their work was suppressed. Yet he could tolerate whimsical maestros: Bulgakov and Pasternak were never arrested. But woe betide anyone, genius or hack, who insulted the person or policy of Stalin -- for the two were synonymous.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], ''Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar'', page 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Doctor Zhivago''==
Several years before the start of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Pasternak and his wife settled in [[Peredelkino]], a village for writers several miles from Moscow. He was filled with a love of life that gave his poetry a hopeful tone. This is reflected in the name of his autobiographical hero Zhivago, derived from the Russian word for ''live''. The character of Zhivago's [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], Lara Antipova, has long been rumored to have been modeled on his mistress, [[Olga Ivinskaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Today in Literary History|url=http://archive.salon.com/books/today/2002/05/30/may30/index.html|work=[[Salon.com|Salon]]|date= 30 May 2002|accessdate=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the elder of his sisters stated that on a visit to her in Germany in the late 1930s, Pasternak told her of the nascent character of Lara, years before he met Ivinskaya in 1946.

After the death of Joseph Stalin on March 5, 1953, Pasternak was unimpressed by [[Khrushchev thaw]]. He confided in Ivinskaya, &quot;For so long we were ruled over by a madman and a murderer -- and now by a fool and a pig. The madman had his occasional flights of fancy, he had an intuitive feeling for certain things, despite his wild obscurantism. Now we are ruled over by mediocrities...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Olga Ivinskaya, ''A Captive of Time: My Years with Pasternak'', [[Doubleday and Company]], 1978. Page 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivinskaya further recalled, &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;At this period, B[oris] L[eonidovich] was reading [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' in the [[English language|English]] original and he hugely enjoyed this merciless satire about a society of animals which mutiny against their human masters, and then gradually revert to a wretched caricature of their original condition. The animals were presided over by a fat hog who vividly reminded B[oris]  L[eonidovich] of our head of state. Sometimes he said laughingly that [[Khrushchev]] put his collar around the wrong part of his anatomy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya, ''A Captive of Time'', page 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After his own novel was denied publication by the Soviet State, Pasternak arranged for ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' to be smuggled abroad by Sir [[Isaiah Berlin]]. In 1957, the novel was printed by the multi-billionaire Italian publisher, [[Giangiacomo Feltrinelli]]. To the outrage of the [[Politburo]], the novel became an instant sensation throughout the non-Communist world. As retaliation for his role in ''Doctor Zhivago'''s publication, Feltrinelli was expelled in disgrace from the [[Italian Communist Party]].

Between 1958 and 1959, the [[English language]] edition spent 26 weeks at the top of ''[[The New York Times]]''' bestseller list. Although none of his Soviet critics had the chance to read the proscribed novel, several officials of the Writer's Union publicly demanded, &quot;kick the pig out of our kitchen-garden,&quot; i.e., expel Pasternak from the USSR. This led to a humorous Russian saying, &quot;I did not read Pasternak, but I condemn him&quot;.

==Nobel Prize==

[[Image:1990 CPA 6257.jpg|thumb|100px|Boris Pasternak, Nobel stamp, USSR]]
Pasternak was named the winner of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1958. 

Boris Pasternak first accepted the award, but was later caused by the authorities of his country to decline the prize.  On 25 October, two days after hearing that he had won, Pasternak sent the following telegram to the [[Swedish Academy]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Immensely thankful, touched, proud, astonished, abashed.&lt;ref name=&quot;timesonline-292690&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, four days later came another telegram:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Considering the meaning this award has been given in the society to which I belong, I must refuse it. Please do not take offense at my voluntary rejection.&lt;ref name=&quot;timesonline-292690&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Swedish Academy announced:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This refusal, of course, in no way alters the validity of the award. There remains only for the Academy, however, to announce with regret that the presentation of the Prize cannot take place.&lt;ref name=nobel_lectures&gt;

}})
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pasternak had declined under intense pressure from Soviet authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;timesonline-292690&quot; /&gt; In spite of his turning down the award, Soviet officials soured on Pasternak, and he was threatened at the very least with expulsion. In response, Pasternak wrote to Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Leaving the motherland will equal death for me. I am tied to Russia by birth, by life and work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Pasternak.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In addition, the Prime Minister of India,  [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], may also have spoken with Khrushchev about this,&lt;ref name=Stallworthy&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pasternak was not exiled or imprisoned.

Despite this, a famous [[Bill Mauldin]] cartoon at the time showed Pasternak and another prisoner in the [[GULAG]], splitting trees in the snow. In the caption, Pasternak says, &quot;I won the Nobel Prize for literature. What was your crime?&quot; The cartoon won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/swann/mauldin/mauldin-intro.html Bill Mauldin Beyond Willie and Joe] (Library of Congress)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[Image:Pasternak grave landscape.png|thumb|275px|Boris Pasternak's grave in Peredelkino in October 1983.]]

Pasternak's post-''Zhivago'' poetry probes the universal questions of love, immortality, and reconciliation with God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoover.org/hila/exhibits/3243901.html Hostage of Eternity: Boris Pasternak] (Hoover Institution)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/april28/pasternak-428.html Conference set on Doctor Zhivago writer] (Stanford Report, 28 April 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pasternak died of [[lung cancer]] on 30 May 1960.
Despite only a small notice appearing in the ''Literary Gazette'',{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} thousands of people traveled from Moscow to his funeral in Peredelkino. &quot;Volunteers carried his open coffin to his burial place and those who were present (including the poet [[Andrey Voznesensky]]) recited from memory the banned poem 'Hamlet'.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stallworthy/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[image:Pasternak original stamp.jpg|thumb|USSR, 4 [[kopeck]] stamp, 1990]]
The poet and [[Bard (Soviet Union)|bard]] [[Alexander Galich]] wrote a politically charged song dedicated to Pasternak's memory.

His father's Nobel medal was ultimately presented to Yevgeny Pasternak in Stockholm during the Nobel week of December 1989.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://english.pravda.ru/society/showbiz/18-12-2003/4383-pasternak-0/ Boris Pasternak: The Nobel Prize. Son's memoirs.] (Pravda, 18 December 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; At the ceremony, acclaimed cellist [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] performed a [[Bach]] serenade in honor of his deceased countryman.

In 1988, after decades of circulating in [[Samizdat]], ''Doctor Zhivago'' was finally published in the author's homeland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazines.russ.ru/novyi_mi/soder/80-89.html Contents] of [[Novy Mir]] magazines {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''[[The Times]]'' revealed that the British intelligence service, or [[MI6]], and the American [[CIA]] had collaborated to ensure that Pasternak's novel was submitted in accordance with the [[Nobel Committee]]'s regulations. This was done because it was known that a Nobel Prize for Pasternak would seriously harm the international credibility of the [[Soviet Union]]. In the fall of 1958, British and American operatives intercepted and photographed a manuscript of the novel and secretly printed a small number of books in the [[Russian language]]. These were submitted to the Nobel Committee's surprised judges just ahead of the deadline.&lt;ref name=&quot;timesonline-292690&quot;&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article1292690.ece How the CIA won Zhivago a Nobel]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/26/AR2007012601758.html The Plot Thickens A New Book Promises an Intriguing Twist to the Epic Tale of 'Doctor Zhivago']&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yevgeny Pasternak, however, his father was completely unaware of the involvement of Western intelligence services in ensuring his Nobel victory. Yevgeny further declared that the [[Nobel Prize]] caused his father nothing but severe grief and harassment at the hands of the Soviet State.

The Pasternak family papers are stored at the [[Hoover Institution]] Archives, [[Stanford University]]. They contain correspondence, drafts of ''[[Doctor Zhivago]]'' and other writings, photographs, and other material, of Boris Pasternak and other family members.

Several of Pasternak's relations moved to [[Lithuania]] after the [[October Revolution]] and there are 4 direct descendants left there. A [[cousin]]'s family is buried in [[Rokantiškės]] cemetery, in [[Vilnius]].

Yet another cousin, the Polish-Jewish poet [[Leon Pasternak]], a devote communist who was imprisoned in Poland because of his revolutionary poems at the [[Bereza Kartuska detention camp]] in 1934,
fled to the USSR at the beginning of WW2, were he joined the Red Army. He wrote the lyrics to some of the most exhilarating marches, and fought in the division of the Polish army against the Nazis.

Another relative of Boris, a much older namesake of
Leon Pasternak, emigrated at about 1890 from Odessa to Zurich, were he became a Mathematics professor in the Polytechnic. His daughter Eliza
is the mother of the famous Bulgarian composer  
[[Pancho Vladigerov]].

===Cultural influence===
A [[minor planet]] [[3508 Pasternak]], discovered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina]] in 1980 is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Schmadel| first = Lutz D.| coauthors =| title = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names| pages = 294| edition = 5th| year = 2003| publisher = Springer Verlag| location = New York| url = http://books.google.com/books?q=3508+Pasternak+1980+DO5| isbn = 3540002383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russian-American]] singer and songwriter [[Regina Spektor]] recited a verse from &quot;Black Spring&quot;, a 1912 poem by Pasternak in her song &quot;Apres Moi&quot; from her album ''[[Begin to Hope]]''.

==Adaptations==
The first [[Doctor Zhivago (1965 film)|screen adaptation]] of ''Doctor Zhivago'', adapted by [[Robert Bolt]] and directed by [[David Lean]], appeared in 1965. The film, which toured in the [[roadshow]] tradition, starred [[Omar Sharif]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], and [[Julie Christie]]. Concentrating on the [[love triangle]] aspects of the novel, it quickly became a worldwide blockbuster, but was unavailable in Russia until [[Perestroika]].

In 2002, the novel was adapted as a [[Doctor Zhivago (TV serial)|television miniseries]]. Directed by Giacomo Campiotti, the serial starred [[Hans Matheson]], [[Alexandra Maria Lara]] and [[Keira Knightley]].

The Russian TV version of 2006, directed by [[Alexander Proshkin]] and starring [[Oleg Menshikov]] as Zhivago, is considered more faithful to Pasternak's novel than David Lean's 1965 film.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Pascal's triangle 5.svg|right|thumb|200px|The binomial coefficients can be arranged to form [[Pascal's triangle]].]]
In [[mathematics]], '''binomial coefficients''' are a family of positive [[integer]]s that occur  as [[coefficient]]s in the [[binomial theorem]]. They are indexed by two nonnegative integers; the binomial coefficient indexed by ''n'' and ''k'' is usually written &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk &lt;/math&gt;, and it is the [[coefficient]] of the ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; term in the [[polynomial expansion]] of the [[binomial]] [[exponentiation|power]] (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Arranging binomial coefficients into rows for successive values of ''n'', and in which  ''k'' ranges from 0 to ''n'', gives a triangular array called [[Pascal's triangle]].

This family of numbers also arises in many other areas than algebra, notably in [[combinatorics]]. For any set containing ''n'' elements, the number of distinct ''k''-element [[subset]]s of it that can be formed (the ''k''-[[combination]]s of its elements) is given by the binomial coefficient &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt; is often read as &quot;''n'' choose ''k''&quot;. The properties of binomial coefficients have led to extending the meaning of the symbol &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt; beyond the basic case where ''n'' and ''k'' are nonnegative integers with {{nowrap|''k'' ≤ ''n''}}; such expressions are then still called binomial coefficients.

The notation &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt; was introduced by [[Andreas von Ettingshausen]] in 1826,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Higham|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the numbers were already known centuries before that (see [[Pascal's triangle]]). The earliest known detailed discussion of binomial coefficients is in a tenth-century commentary, due to [[Halayudha]], on an ancient [[Hindu]] classic, [[Pingala]]'s chandaḥśāstra.  In about 1150, the Hindu mathematician [[Bhaskaracharya]] gave a very clear exposition of binomial coefficients in his book [[Lilavati]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lilavati]] Section 6, Chapter 4 (see {{harvtxt|Knuth|1997}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative notations include C(''n'', ''k''), &lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C^{k}_{n}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C^{n}_{k}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Shilov|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; in all of which the C stands for ''[[combination]]s'' or ''choices''.

== Definition and interpretations ==

For [[natural number]]s (taken to include 0) ''n'' and ''k'', the binomial coefficient &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as the [[coefficient]] of the [[monomial]] ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; in the expansion of {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The same coefficient also occurs (if {{nowrap|''k'' ≤ ''n''}}) in the [[binomial formula]]
:&lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk x^{n-k}y^k&lt;/math&gt;
(valid for any elements ''x'',''y'' of a [[commutative ring]]),
which explains the name &quot;binomial coefficient&quot;.

Another occurrence of this number is in combinatorics, where it gives the number of ways, disregarding order, that ''k'' objects can be chosen from among ''n'' objects; more formally, the number of ''k''-element subsets (or ''k''-[[combination]]s) of an ''n''-element set. This number can be seen as equal to the one of the first definition, independently of any of the formulas below to compute it: if in each of the ''n'' factors of the power {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} one temporarily labels the term ''X'' with an index ''i'' (running from 1 to ''n''), then each subset of ''k'' indices gives after expansion a contribution ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, and the coefficient of that monomial in the result will be the number of such subsets. This shows in particular that &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number for any natural numbers ''n'' and ''k''. There are many other combinatorial interpretations of binomial coefficients (counting problems for which the answer is given by a binomial coefficient expression), for instance the number of words formed of ''n'' [[bit]]s (digits 0 or 1) whose sum is ''k'' is given by &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt;, while the number of ways to write &lt;math&gt;k=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n&lt;/math&gt; where every ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a nonnegative integer is given by &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n+k-1}k&lt;/math&gt;. Most of these interpretations are easily seen to be equivalent to counting ''k''-combinations.

== Computing the value of binomial coefficients ==

Several methods exist to compute the value of &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt; without actually expanding a binomial power or counting ''k''-combinations.

=== Recursive formula ===

One has a [[recursion|recursive]] formula for binomial coefficients

:&lt;math&gt;  \binom nk = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}k \quad \mbox{for all integers }n,k&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt;

with initial values

:&lt;math&gt;\binom n0 = 1 \quad \mbox{for all } n \in \N,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\binom 0k = 0 \quad \mbox{for all integers } k&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

The formula follows either from tracing the contributions to ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; in {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;(1 + ''X'')}}, or by counting ''k''-combinations of {{nowrap|{1, 2, ..., ''n''}}} that contain ''n'' and that do not contain ''n'' separately.
It follows easily that  &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk=0&lt;/math&gt; when ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'', and &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nn=1&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n'', so the recursion can stop when reaching such cases. This recursive formula then allows the construction of [[Pascal's triangle]].

=== Multiplicative formula ===

A more efficient method to compute individual binomial coefficients is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\binom nk = \frac{n^{\underline k}}{k!} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-(k-1))}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots 1}=\prod_{i=1}^k \frac{n-(k-i)}{i},&lt;/math&gt;

where the numerator of the first fraction is expressed as a [[falling factorial power]].
This formula is easiest to understand for the combinatorial interpretation of binomial coefficients.
The numerator gives the number of ways to select a sequence of ''k'' distinct objects, retaining the order of selection, from a set of ''n'' objects. The denominator counts the number of distinct sequences that define the same ''k''-combination when order is disregarded.

=== Factorial formula ===

Finally there is a formula using [[factorial]]s that is easy to remember:

:&lt;math&gt; \binom nk = \frac{n!}{k!\,(n-k)!} \quad \mbox{for }\ 0\leq k\leq n.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n''! denotes the factorial of ''n''. This formula follows from the multiplicative formula above by multiplying numerator and denominator by {{nowrap|(''n'' − ''k'')!}}; as a consequence it involves many factors common to numerator and denominator. It is less practical for explicit computation unless common factors are first canceled (in particular since factorial values grow very rapidly). The formula does exhibit a symmetry that is less evident from the multiplicative formula (though it is from the definitions)

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \binom nk = \binom n{n-k} \quad \mbox{for }\ 0\leq k\leq n.&lt;/math&gt;|1}}

=== Generalization and connection to the binomial series ===

The multiplicative formula allows the definition of binomial coefficients to be extended&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harv|Graham|Knuth|Patashnik|1994}}, which also defines &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Alternative generalizations, such as to [[#Two real or complex valued arguments|two real or complex valued arguments]] using the [[Gamma function]] assign nonzero values to &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, but this causes most binomial coefficient identities to fail, and thus is not widely used majority of definitions.  One such choice of nonzero values leads to the aesthetically pleasing &quot;Pascal windmill&quot; in Hilton, Holton and Pedersen, ''Mathematical reflections: in a room with many mirrors'', Springer, 1997, but causes even [[Pascal's identity]] to fail (at the origin).&lt;/ref&gt; by replacing ''n'' by an arbitrary number ''α'' (negative, real, complex) or even an element of any [[commutative ring]] in which all positive integers are invertible:
:&lt;math&gt;\binom \alpha k = \frac{\alpha^{\underline k}}{k!} = \frac{\alpha(\alpha-1)(\alpha-2)\cdots(\alpha-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots 1}
  \quad\mbox{for } k\in\N \mbox{ and arbitrary } \alpha.
&lt;/math&gt;

With this definition one has a generalization of the binomial formula (with one of the variables set to 1), which justifies still calling the &lt;math&gt;\tbinom\alpha k&lt;/math&gt; binomial coefficients:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; (1+X)^\alpha = \sum_{k=0}^\infty {\alpha \choose k} X^k.&lt;/math&gt;|2}}

This formula is valid for all complex numbers ''α'' and ''X'' with |''X''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1. It can also be interpreted as an identity of [[formal power series]] in ''X'', where it actually can serve as definition of arbitrary powers of series with constant coefficient equal to&amp;nbsp;1; the point is that with this definition all identities hold that one expects for [[exponentiation]], notably

:&lt;math&gt;(1+X)^\alpha(1+X)^\beta=(1+X)^{\alpha+\beta} \quad\mbox{and}\quad ((1+X)^\alpha)^\beta=(1+X)^{\alpha\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''α'' is a nonnegative integer ''n'', then all terms with ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'' are zero, and the infinite series becomes a finite sum, thereby recovering the binomial formula. However for other values of ''α'', including negative integers and rational numbers, the series is really infinite.

== Pascal's triangle ==
[[Image:Pascal's triangle - 1000th row.png|150px|right|thumb|1000th row of Pascal's triangle, arranged vertically, with grey-scale representations of decimal digits of the coefficients, right-aligned. The left boundary of the image corresponds roughly to the graph of the logarithm of the binomial coefficients, and illustrates that they form a [[logarithmically concave sequence|log-concave sequence]].]]

{{Main|Pascal's rule}}
{{Main|Pascal's triangle}}

[[Pascal's rule]] is the important [[recurrence relation]]
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; {n \choose k} +  {n \choose k+1} = {n+1 \choose k+1},&lt;/math&gt;|3}}
which can be used to prove by [[mathematical induction]] that &lt;math&gt; \tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number for all ''n'' and ''k'', (equivalent to the statement that k! divides the product of k consecutive integers),  a fact that is not immediately obvious from [[#Definition|formula (1)]].

Pascal's rule also gives rise to [[Pascal's triangle]]:

Row number ''n'' contains the numbers &lt;math&gt; \tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt; for ''k'' = 0,…,''n''. It is constructed by starting with ones at the outside and then always adding two adjacent numbers and writing the sum directly underneath. This method allows the quick calculation of binomial coefficients without the need for fractions or multiplications. For instance, by looking at row number 5 of the triangle, one can quickly read off that
:(''x'' + ''y'')&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = '''1''' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + '''5''' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''y'' + '''10''' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + '''10''' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + '''5''' ''x'' ''y''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + '''1''' ''y''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.
The differences between elements on other diagonals are the elements in the previous diagonal, as a consequence of the recurrence relation ({{EquationNote|3}}) above.

== Combinatorics and statistics ==

Binomial coefficients are of importance in [[combinatorics]], because they provide ready formulas for certain frequent counting problems:
* There are &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt; ways to choose ''k'' elements from a set of ''n'' elements.  See [[Combination]].
* There are &lt;math&gt;\tbinom {n+k-1}k&lt;/math&gt; ways to choose ''k'' elements from a set of ''n'' if repetitions are allowed. See [[Multiset]].
* There are &lt;math&gt; \tbinom {n+k} k&lt;/math&gt; [[string (computer science)|strings]] containing ''k'' ones and ''n'' zeros.
* There are &lt;math&gt; \tbinom {n+1} k&lt;/math&gt; strings consisting of ''k'' ones and ''n'' zeros such that no two ones are adjacent. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muir|first=Thomas|title=Note on Selected Combinations|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|year=1902|url=http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=EN8vAAAAIAAJ&amp;output=reader&amp;pg=GBS.PA102}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The [[Catalan number]]s are &lt;math&gt;\frac {\tbinom{2n}n}{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[binomial distribution]] in [[statistics]] is &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \!.&lt;/math&gt;
* The formula for a [[Bézier curve]].

== Binomial coefficients as polynomials ==

For any nonnegative integer ''k'', the expression &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\binom{t}{k}}&lt;/math&gt; can be simplified and defined as a polynomial divided by ''k''!:

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{t}{k} =\frac{(t)_k}{k!}=\frac{(t)_k}{(k)_k}= \frac{t(t-1)(t-2)\cdots(t-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots(2)(1)};\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This presents a [[polynomial]] in ''t'' with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients.

As such, it can be evaluated at any real or complex number ''t'' to define binomial coefficients with such first arguments.
These &quot;generalized binomial coefficients&quot; appear in [[Binomial theorem#Newton's generalized binomial theorem|Newton's generalized binomial theorem]].

For each ''k'', the polynomial &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{t}{k}&lt;/math&gt; can be characterized as the unique degree ''k'' polynomial ''p''(''t'') satisfying ''p''(0) = ''p''(1) = ... = ''p''(''k'' &amp;minus; 1) = 0 and ''p''(''k'') = 1.

Its coefficients are expressible in terms of [[Stirling numbers of the first kind]], by definition of the latter:
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{t}{k} = \sum_{i=0}^k \frac{s_{k,i}}{k!} t^i.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{t}{k}&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated by [[logarithmic differentiation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \binom{t}{k} = \binom{t}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac{1}{t-i}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Binomial coefficients as a basis for the space of polynomials ===

Over any field containing [[rational number|'''Q''']], each polynomial ''p''(''t'') of degree at most ''d'' is uniquely expressible as a linear combination &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^d a_k \binom{t}{k}&lt;/math&gt;.
The coefficient ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[finite difference|''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; difference]] of the sequence ''p''(0), ''p''(1), …, ''p''(''k'').
Explicitly,&lt;ref&gt;This can be seen as a discrete analog of [[Taylor's theorem]]. It is closely related to [[Newton's polynomial]]. Alternating sums of this form may be expressed as the [[Nörlund–Rice integral]].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;a_k = \sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^{k-i} \binom{k}{i} p(i).&lt;/math&gt;|3.5}}

=== Integer-valued polynomials ===

Each polynomial &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{t}{k}&lt;/math&gt; is integer-valued: it takes integer values at integer inputs.
(One way to prove this is by induction on ''k'', using [[Pascal's identity]].)
Therefore any integer linear combination of binomial coefficient polynomials is integer-valued too.
Conversely, ({{EquationNote|3.5}}) shows that any integer-valued polynomial is an integer linear combination of these binomial coefficient polynomials.
More generally, for any subring ''R'' of a characteristic 0 field ''K'', a polynomial in ''K''[t] takes values in ''R'' at all integers if and only if it is an ''R''-linear combination of binomial coefficient polynomials.

=== Example ===
The integer-valued polynomial 3''t''(3''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)/2 can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;9\tbinom{t}{2} + 6 \tbinom{t}{1} + 0\tbinom{t}{0}.\ &lt;/math&gt;

== Identities involving binomial coefficients ==

The factorial formula facilitates relating nearby binomial coefficients.  For instance, if ''k'' is a positive integer and ''n'' is arbitrary, then
:&lt;math&gt; \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n}{k} \binom{n-1}{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;
and, with a little more work,
:&lt;math&gt;\binom {n-1}{k} - \binom{n-1}{k-1} = \frac{n-2k}{n} \binom{n}{k}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Powers of -1 ===

A special binomial coefficient is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\binom{-1}{k}}&lt;/math&gt;; it equals powers of -1:

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{-1}{k} =\frac{(-1)^{\underline{k}}}{k!}= \frac{(-1)(-2)(-3)\cdots(-(k-1))(-k)}{k(k-1)\cdots(3)(2)(1)} = (-1)^k\,.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Series involving binomial coefficients ===

The formula 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^n \tbinom n k = 2^n&lt;/math&gt;|5}}
is obtained from ({{EquationNote|2}}) using ''x'' = 1.  This is equivalent to saying that the elements in one row of Pascal's triangle always add up to two raised to an integer power. A combinatorial interpretation of this fact involving [[double counting (proof technique)|double counting]] is given by counting subsets of size 0, size 1, size 2, and so on up to size ''n'' of a set ''S'' of ''n'' elements. Since we count the number of subsets of size ''i'' for 0 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n'', this sum must be equal to the number of subsets of ''S'', which is known to be 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  That is, Equation&amp;nbsp;5 is a statement that the [[power set]] for a finite set with ''n'' elements has size 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The formulas
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n k \tbinom n k = n 2^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;|6a}}
and
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n k^2 \tbinom n k = (n + n^2)2^{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;|6b}}
follow from ({{EquationNote|2}}), after [[derivative|differentiating]]   with respect to ''x'' (twice in the latter)  and then substituting ''x'' = 1.

The [[Chu-Vandermonde identity]], which holds for any complex-values ''m'' and ''n'' and any non-negative integer ''k'', is
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sum_{j=0}^k \tbinom m j \tbinom{n-m}{k-j} = \tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt;|7a}}
and can be found by examination of the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^k&lt;/math&gt; in the expansion of (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'')&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; = (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; using equation ({{EquationNote|2}}).  When ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, equation ({{EquationNote|7a}}) reduces to equation ({{EquationNote|3}}).

A similar looking formula, which applies for any integers ''j'', ''k'', and ''n'' satisfying 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'', is
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^n \tbinom m j \tbinom {n-m}{k-j}= \tbinom {n+1}{k+1}\,,&lt;/math&gt;|7b}}
and can be found by examination of the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; in the expansion of &lt;math&gt;x\left(\tfrac{x^{j}}{(1-x)^{j+1}}\right) \left(\tfrac{x^{k-j}}{(1-x)^{k-j+1}}\right) = \tfrac{x^{k+1}}{(1-x)^{k+2}}&lt;/math&gt;
using &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{x^l}{(1-x)^{l+1}} = \sum_{p=0}^\infty \tbinom p l x^p\,.&lt;/math&gt;
When ''j''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'', equation ({{EquationNote|7b}}) gives
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^n \tbinom m k = \tbinom {n+1}{k+1}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

From expansion ({{EquationNote|7a}}) using ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''m'', ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m'', and ({{EquationNote|1}}), one finds
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sum_{j=0}^m \tbinom m j ^2 = \tbinom {2m} m.&lt;/math&gt;|8}}

Let ''F''(''n'') denote the ''n''-th [[Fibonacci number]]. 
We obtain a formula about the diagonals of Pascal's triangle
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor} \tbinom {n-k} k = F(n+1).&lt;/math&gt;|9}}

This can be proved by [[mathematical induction|induction]] using ({{EquationNote|3}}) or by [[Zeckendorf's theorem|Zeckendorf's representation]] (Just note that the lhs gives the number of subsets of {''F''(2),...,''F''(''n'')} without consecutive members, which also form all the numbers below ''F''(''n''+1)).

Also using ({{EquationNote|3}}) and induction, one can show that
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sum_{j=k}^n \tbinom j k = \tbinom {n+1}{k+1}.&lt;/math&gt;|10}}

Again by ({{EquationNote|3}}) and induction, one can show that for ''k'' = 0, ... , ''n''&amp;minus;1
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^j\tbinom n j = (-1)^k\tbinom {n-1}k&lt;/math&gt;|11}}

as well as
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j\tbinom n j = 0&lt;/math&gt;|12}}

which is itself a special case of the result from the theory of [[finite differences]] that for any polynomial ''P''(''x'') of degree less than ''n'',{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j\tbinom n j P(j) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;|13a}}
Differentiating ({{EquationNote|2}}) ''k'' times and setting ''x'' = &amp;minus;1 yields this for
&lt;math&gt;P(x)=x(x-1)\cdots(x-k+1)&lt;/math&gt;,
when 0 ≤ ''k'' &lt; ''n'',
and the general case follows by taking linear combinations of these.

When ''P''(''x'') is of degree less than or equal to ''n'',

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j\tbinom n j P(n-j) = n!a_n&lt;/math&gt;|13b}}

where &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of degree ''n'' in ''P''(''x'').

More generally for ({{EquationNote|13b}}),

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j\tbinom n j P(m+(n-j)d) = d^n n! a_n&lt;/math&gt;|13c}}
where ''m'' and ''d'' are complex numbers. This follows immediately applying ({{EquationNote|13b}}) to the polynomial ''Q(x):=P(m + dx)'' instead of ''P(x)'', and observing that ''Q(x)'' has still degree less than or equal to ''n'', and that its coefficient of degree ''n'' is ''d&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The [[infinite series]]
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=m}^\infty \frac 1 {\binom j k}=\frac k{(k-1)\binom{m-1}{k-1}}&lt;/math&gt;|14}}
is convergent for ''k'' ≥ 2. This formula is used in the analysis of the [[German tank problem]].
It is equivalent to the formula for the finite sum
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=m}^{M-1}\frac 1 {k\binom j k}=\frac 1{(k-1)\binom{m-1}{k-1}}-\frac 1{(k-1)\binom{M-1}{k-1}}&lt;/math&gt;
which is proved for ''M''&gt;''m'' by [[mathematical induction|induction]] on ''M''.

Using ({{EquationNote|8}}) one can derive
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{n}{i\binom{n}{i}^2}=\frac{n}{2}\binom{2n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;|15}}
and
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^n{i^2\binom{n}{i}^2}=n^2 \binom{2n-2}{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;|16}}

=== Identities with combinatorial proofs ===

Many identities involving binomial coefficients can be proved by [[combinatorial proof|combinatorial means]]. For example, the following identity for nonnegative integers &lt;math&gt;{n} \geq {q}&lt;/math&gt; (which reduces to (6) when &lt;math&gt;q=1&lt;/math&gt;): 

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=q}^n \tbinom n k \tbinom k q = 2^{n-q}\tbinom n q&lt;/math&gt;|16b}}

can be given a [[double counting (proof technique)|double counting proof]] as follows. The left side counts the number of ways of selecting a subset of &lt;math&gt;[n]&lt;/math&gt; of at least ''q'' elements, and marking ''q'' elements among those selected. The right side counts the same parameter, because there are &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n q&lt;/math&gt; ways of choosing a set of ''q'' marks and they occur in all subsets that additionally contain some subset of the remaining elements, of which there are &lt;math&gt;2^{n-q}.&lt;/math&gt; 

The recursion formula

:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}&lt;/math&gt;

where both sides count the number of k-element subsets of  {1, 2, . . . , n} with the right hand side ﬁrst grouping them into those that contain element n and those that do not. 

The identity ({{EquationNote|8}}) also has a combinatorial proof. The identity reads

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n \tbinom n k ^2 = \tbinom {2n} n.&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose you have &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt; empty squares arranged in a row and you want to mark (select) ''n'' of them. There are &lt;math&gt;\tbinom {2n}n&lt;/math&gt; ways to do this. On the other hand, you may select your ''n'' squares by selecting ''k'' squares from among the first ''n'' and &lt;math&gt;n-k&lt;/math&gt; squares from the remaining ''n'' squares. This gives
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n\tbinom  n k\tbinom n{n-k} = \tbinom {2n} n.&lt;/math&gt;
Now apply (4) to get the result.

==== Sum of coefficients row ====
{{See also|Combination#Number of k-combinations for all k}}

The number of ''k''-[[Combination#Number of k-combinations for all k|combinations]] for all ''k'', &lt;math&gt;\sum_{0\leq{k}\leq{n}}\binom nk = 2^n&lt;/math&gt;, is the sum of the ''n''th row (counting from 0) of the binomial coefficients. These combinations are enumerated by the 1 digits of the set of [[base 2]] numbers counting from 0 to &lt;math&gt;2^n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, where each digit position is an item from the set of ''n''.

=== Continuous identities ===
Certain trigonometric integrals have values expressible in terms of
binomial coefficients:

For &lt;math&gt;\textstyle m, n \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle m, n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \cos((2m-n)x)\cos^n x\ dx = \frac{\pi}{2^{n-1}} \binom{n}{m} 
&lt;/math&gt;|17}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin((2m-n)x)\sin^n x\ dx = \left \{
\begin{array}{cc}
(-1)^{m+(n+1)/2} \frac{\pi}{2^{n-1}} \binom{n}{m} &amp; n \mbox{ odd} \\
0 &amp; \mbox{otherwise} \\
\end{array} \right.&lt;/math&gt;|18}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \cos((2m-n)x)\sin^n x\ dx = \left \{
\begin{array}{cc}
(-1)^{m+(n+1)/2} \frac{\pi}{2^{n-1}} \binom{n}{m} &amp; n \mbox{ even} \\
0 &amp; \mbox{otherwise} \\
\end{array} \right.&lt;/math&gt;|19}}

These can be proved by using [[Euler's formula]] to convert [[trigonometric functions]] to complex exponentials, expanding using the binomial theorem, and integrating term by term.

== Generating functions ==
=== Ordinary generating functions ===

For a fixed ''n'', the [[ordinary generating function]] of the sequence &lt;math&gt;{n\choose 0},\;{n\choose 1},\;{n\choose 2},\;\ldots&lt;/math&gt; is:
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_k {n\choose k} x^k = (1+x)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

For a fixed ''k'',  the ordinary generating function of the sequence &lt;math&gt;{0\choose k},\;{1\choose k},\;{2\choose k},\;\ldots&lt;/math&gt; is:
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_n {n\choose k} y^n = \frac{y^k}{(1-y)^{k+1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[bivariate generating function]] of the binomial coefficients is:
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n,k} {n\choose k} x^k y^n = \frac{1}{1-y-xy}.&lt;/math&gt;

Another bivariate generating function of the binomial coefficients, which is symmetric, is:
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n,k} {n+k\choose k} x^k y^n = \frac{1}{1-x-y}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Exponential generating function ===

The [[exponential generating function|exponential bivariate generating function]] of the binomial coefficients is:
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n,k} \frac{1}{(n+k)!}{n+k\choose k} x^k y^n = e^{x+y}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Divisibility properties ==

In 1852, [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] proved that if ''m'' and ''n'' are nonnegative integers and ''p'' is a prime number, then the largest power of ''p'' dividing &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{m+n}{m}&lt;/math&gt; equals ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''c'' is the number of carries when ''m'' and ''n'' are added in base ''p''.
Equivalently, the exponent of a prime ''p'' in &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt;
equals the number of nonnegative integers ''j'' such that the [[fractional part]] of ''k''/''p''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt; is greater than the fractional part of ''n''/''p''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;.  It can be deduced from this that &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by ''n''/[[greatest common divisor|gcd]](''n'',''k'').

A somewhat surprising result by [[David Singmaster]] (1974) is that any integer divides [[almost all]] binomial coefficients. More precisely, fix an integer ''d'' and let ''f''(''N'') denote the number of binomial coefficients &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt; with ''n'' &lt; ''N'' such that ''d'' divides &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{N\to\infty} \frac{f(N)}{N(N+1)/2} = 1. &lt;/math&gt;
Since the number of binomial coefficients &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt; with ''n'' &lt; ''N'' is ''N''(''N''+1) / 2, this implies that the density of binomial coefficients divisible by ''d'' goes to 1.

Another fact:
An integer ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2 is prime if and only if
all the intermediate binomial coefficients
:&lt;math&gt; \binom n 1, \binom n 2, \ldots, \binom n{n-1} &lt;/math&gt;
are divisible by ''n''.

Proof:
When ''p'' is prime, ''p'' divides
:&lt;math&gt; \binom p k = \frac{p \cdot (p-1) \cdots (p-k+1)}{k \cdot (k-1) \cdots 1} &lt;/math&gt; for all 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''
because it is a natural number and the numerator has a prime factor ''p'' but the denominator does not have a prime factor ''p''.

When ''n'' is composite, let ''p'' be the smallest prime factor of ''n'' and let ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;n/p. Then 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n'' and
:&lt;math&gt; \binom n p = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\cdot\ldots\cdot(n-p+1)}{p!}=\frac{k(n-1)(n-2)\cdot\ldots\cdot(n-p+1)}{(p-1)!}\not\equiv 0 \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;
otherwise the numerator ''k''(''n''&amp;minus;1)(''n''&amp;minus;2)&amp;times;...&amp;times;(''n''&amp;minus;''p''+1) has to be divisible by ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;times;''p'', this can only be the case when (''n''&amp;minus;1)(''n''&amp;minus;2)&amp;times;...&amp;times;(''n''&amp;minus;''p''+1) is divisible by ''p''. But ''n'' is divisible by ''p'', so ''p'' does not divide ''n''&amp;minus;1, ''n''&amp;minus;2, ..., ''n''&amp;minus;''p''+1 and because ''p'' is prime, we know that ''p'' does not divide (''n''&amp;minus;1)(''n''&amp;minus;2)&amp;times;...&amp;times;(''n''&amp;minus;''p''+1) and so the numerator cannot be divisible by ''n''.

== Bounds and asymptotic formulas ==

The following bounds for &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt; hold:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{n}{k}\right)^k \le {n \choose k}  \le \frac{n^k}{k!} \le \left(\frac{n\cdot e}{k}\right)^k.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Stirling's approximation]] yields the bounds:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}{2n \choose n} \ge 2^{2n-1}&lt;/math&gt; and, in general, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}{mn \choose n} \ge \frac{m^{m(n-1)+1}}{(m-1)^{(m-1)(n-1)}}&lt;/math&gt; for ''m''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1,

and the approximation

: &lt;math&gt; {2n \choose n} \sim \frac{4^n}{\sqrt{\pi n}}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n\rightarrow\infty\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The infinite product formula (cf. [[Gamma_function#Alternative_definitions|Gamma function, alternative definition]])
:&lt;math&gt;(-1)^k {z \choose k}= {-z+k-1 \choose k} = \frac{1}{\Gamma(-z)} \frac{1}{(k+1)^{z+1}} \prod_{j=k+1} \frac{(1+\frac{1}{j})^{-z-1}}{1-\frac{z+1}{j}}&lt;/math&gt;
yields the asymptotic formulas 
:&lt;math&gt;{z \choose k} \approx \frac{(-1)^k}{\Gamma(-z) k^{z+1}} \qquad  \mathrm{and}  \qquad {z+k \choose k} = \frac{k^z}{\Gamma(z+1)}\left( 1+\frac{z(z+1)}{2k}+\mathcal{O}\left(k^{-2}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
as &lt;math&gt;k \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

This asymptotic behaviour is contained in the approximation 
:&lt;math&gt;{z+k \choose k}\approx \frac{e^{z(H_k-\gamma)}}{\Gamma(z+1)}&lt;/math&gt;
as well. (Here &lt;math&gt;H_k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''k''-th [[harmonic number]] and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]]).

The sum of binomial coefficients can be bounded by a term exponential in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and the binary entropy of the largest &lt;math&gt;n/k&lt;/math&gt; that occurs. More precisely, for &lt;math&gt;n\geq 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\epsilon&lt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, it holds
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor\epsilon n\rfloor} {n \choose k} \leq 2^{H(\epsilon) \cdot n},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;H(\epsilon)=-\epsilon\cdot \log \epsilon - (1-\epsilon)\cdot \log (1-\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[binary entropy function|binary entropy]] of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. {{harvtxt |Flum|Grohe|2006| p=427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple and rough upper bound for the sum of binomial coefficients is given by the formula below (not difficult to prove)
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^k {n \choose i} \leq (n+1)^k&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==
===Generalization to multinomials===
Binomial coefficients can be generalized to '''multinomial coefficients'''.
They are defined to be the number:
:&lt;math&gt;{n\choose k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_r} =\frac{n!}{k_1!k_2!\cdots k_r!}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^rk_i=n.&lt;/math&gt;

While the binomial coefficients represent the coefficients of (''x''+''y'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the multinomial coefficients
represent the coefficients of the polynomial
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_r)^n.\ &lt;/math&gt;
See [[multinomial theorem]].  The case ''r'' = 2 gives binomial coefficients:
:&lt;math&gt;{n\choose k_1,k_2}={n\choose k_1, n-k_1}={n\choose k_1}= {n\choose k_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The combinatorial interpretation of multinomial coefficients is distribution of ''n'' distinguishable elements over ''r'' (distinguishable) containers, each containing exactly ''k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' elements, where ''i'' is the index of the container.

Multinomial coefficients have many properties similar to these of binomial coefficients, for example the recurrence relation:
:&lt;math&gt;{n\choose k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_r} ={n-1\choose k_1-1,k_2,\ldots,k_r}+{n-1\choose k_1,k_2-1,\ldots,k_r}+\ldots+{n-1\choose k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_r-1}&lt;/math&gt;
and symmetry:
:&lt;math&gt;{n\choose k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_r} ={n\choose k_{\sigma_1},k_{\sigma_2},\ldots,k_{\sigma_r}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_i)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[permutation]] of (1,2,...,''r'').

=== Generalization to negative integers ===
If &lt;math&gt;k \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then 
&lt;math&gt; {n \choose k} = \frac{n(n-1) \dots (n-k+1)}{1 \cdot 2  \cdots k}= (-1)^k {-n+k-1 \choose k}&lt;/math&gt; extends to all &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Taylor series ===

Using [[Stirling numbers of the first kind]] the [[Taylor series|series expansion]] around any arbitrarily chosen point &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} {z \choose k} = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{i=0}^k z^i s_{k,i}&amp;=\sum_{i=0}^k (z- z_0)^i \sum_{j=i}^k {z_0 \choose j-i} \frac{s_{k+i-j,i}}{(k+i-j)!} \\ &amp;=\sum_{i=0}^k (z-z_0)^i \sum_{j=i}^k z_0^{j-i} {j \choose i} \frac{s_{k,j}}{k!}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Binomial coefficient with n=1/2 ===

The definition of the binomial coefficients can be extended to the case where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is real and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is integer.

In particular, the following identity holds for any non-negative integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; :
:&lt;math&gt;{{1/2}\choose{k}}={{2k+1}\choose{k}}\frac{(-1)^{k+1}(k+1)}{2^{2k}(2k-1)(2k+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

This shows up when expanding &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1+x}&lt;/math&gt; into a power series using the Newton binomial series :
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1+x}=\sum_{k\geqslant0}{\tbinom{1/2}{k}}x^k&lt;/math&gt;

=== Identity for the product of binomial coefficients ===

One can express the product of binomial coefficients as a linear combination of binomial coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt; {z \choose m} {z\choose n} = \sum_{k=0}^m {m+n-k\choose k,m-k,n-k} {z\choose m+n-k}&lt;/math&gt;

where the connection coefficients are [[Multinomial theorem|multinomial coefficients]]. In terms of labelled combinatorial objects, the connection coefficients represent the number of ways to assign ''m+n-k'' labels to a pair of labelled combinatorial objects&amp;mdash;of weight ''m'' and ''n'' respectively&amp;mdash;that have had their first ''k'' labels identified, or glued together to get a new labelled combinatorial object of weight ''m+n-k''. (That is, to separate the labels into three portions to apply to the glued part, the unglued part of the first object, and the unglued part of the second object.) In this regard, binomial coefficients are to exponential generating series what [[falling factorial]]s are to ordinary generating series.

=== Partial Fraction Decomposition ===

The [[partial fraction decomposition]] of the inverse is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{{z \choose n}}= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-i} {n \choose i} \frac{n-i}{z-i}, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{{z+n \choose n}}= \sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^{i-1} {n \choose i} \frac{i}{z+i}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Newton's binomial series ===
Newton's [[binomial series]], named after [[Sir Isaac Newton]], is one of the simplest [[Newton series]]:

:&lt;math&gt; (1+z)^{\alpha} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{\alpha\choose n}z^n = 1+{\alpha\choose1}z+{\alpha\choose 2}z^2+\cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

The identity can be obtained by showing that both sides satisfy the [[differential equation]] (1+''z'') ''f'''(''z'') = α ''f''(''z'').
 	
The [[radius of convergence]] of this series is 1.  An alternative expression is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(1-z)^{\alpha+1}} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{n+\alpha \choose n}z^n&lt;/math&gt;

where the identity 

:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k} = (-1)^k {k-n-1 \choose k}&lt;/math&gt;

is applied.

=== Two real or complex valued arguments ===
The binomial coefficient is generalized to two real or complex valued arguments using the [[gamma function]] or [[beta function]] via 
:&lt;math&gt;{x \choose y}= \frac{\Gamma(x+1)}{\Gamma(y+1) \Gamma(x-y+1)}= \frac{1}{(x+1) \Beta(x-y+1,y+1)}.&lt;/math&gt;
This definition inherits these following additional properties from &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;{x \choose y}= \frac{\sin (y \pi)}{\sin(x \pi)} {-y-1 \choose -x-1}= \frac{\sin((x-y) \pi)}{\sin (x \pi)} {y-x-1 \choose y};&lt;/math&gt;
moreover,
:&lt;math&gt;{x \choose y} \cdot {y \choose x}= \frac{\sin((x-y) \pi)}{(x-y) \pi}.&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting function has been little-studied, apparently first being graphed in {{Harv|Fowler|1996}}. Notably, many binomial identities fail: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{{n \choose m} = {n \choose n-m}}&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{{-n \choose m} = {-n \choose -n-m}}&lt;/math&gt; for ''n'' positive (so &lt;math&gt;-n&lt;/math&gt; negative). The behavior is quite complex, and markedly different in various octants (that is, with respect to the ''x'' and ''y'' axes and the line &lt;math&gt;y=x&lt;/math&gt;), with the behavior for negative ''x'' having singularities at negative integer values and a checkerboard of positive and negative regions:

=== Generalization to ''q''-series ===

The binomial coefficient has a [[q-analog]] generalization known as the [[Gaussian binomial coefficient]].

=== Generalization to infinite cardinals ===

The definition of the binomial coefficient can be generalized to [[Cardinal Number|infinite cardinals]] by defining:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha \choose \beta} = | \{ B \subseteq A : |B| = \beta \} |&lt;/math&gt;

where A is some set with [[cardinality]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. One can show that the generalized binomial coefficient is well-defined, in the sense that no matter what set we choose to represent the cardinal number &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\alpha \choose \beta}&lt;/math&gt; will remain the same. For finite cardinals, this definition coincides with the standard definition of the binomial coefficient.

Assuming the [[Axiom of Choice]], one can show that &lt;math&gt;{\alpha \choose \alpha} = 2^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; for any infinite cardinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

==Binomial coefficient in programming languages==
The notation &lt;math&gt; {n \choose k} &lt;/math&gt; is convenient in handwriting but inconvenient for [[typewriter]]s and [[computer terminal]]s. Many [[programming language]]s do not offer a standard [[subroutine]] for computing the binomial coefficient, but for example the [[J programming language]] uses the exclamation mark:  k ! n .

Naive implementations of the factorial formula, such as the following snippet in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def binomialCoefficient(n, k):
    from math import factorial
    return factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

are very slow and are uselessly calculating factorials of very high numbers (in languages as [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]] they suffer from overflow errors because of this reason). A direct implementation of the multiplicative formula works well:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def binomialCoefficient(n, k):
    if k &gt; n - k: # take advantage of symmetry
        k = n - k
    c = 1
    for i in range(k):
        c = c * (n - i)
        c = c / (i + 1)
    return c
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The example mentioned above can be also written in functional style. The following Scheme example uses recursive definition
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k+1} = \frac{n-k}{k+1} {n \choose k} &lt;/math&gt;
Rational arithmetic can be easily avoided using integer division
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k+1} = \left[(n-k) {n \choose k}\right] \div (k+1) &lt;/math&gt;
The following implementation uses all these ideas
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;scheme&quot;&gt;
(define (binomial n k)
;; Helper function to compute C(n,k) via forward recursion
  (define (binomial-iter n k i prev)
    (if (&gt;= i k)
      prev
     (binomial-iter n k (+ i 1) (/ (* (- n i) prev) (+ i 1)))))
;; Use symmetry property C(n,k)=C(n, n-k)
  (if (&lt; k (-  n k))
    (binomial-iter n k 0 1)
    (binomial-iter n (- n k) 0 1)))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Another way to compute the binomial coefficient when using large numbers is to recognize that

:&lt;math&gt;
  {n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \frac{\Gamma(n+1)}{\Gamma(k+1)\Gamma(n-k+1)} = \exp(\ln\Gamma(n+1)-\ln\Gamma(k+1)-\ln\Gamma(n-k+1)).&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;ln\Gamma(n)&lt;/math&gt; is a special function that is easily computed and is standard in some programming languages such as using ''log_gamma'' in [[Maxima (software)|Maxima]], ''LogGamma'' in [[Mathematica]], or ''gammaln'' in [[MATLAB]]. Roundoff error may cause the returned value to not be an integer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bill Holbrook''' (born 1958) is an American [[comic strip]] &amp; [[webcomic]] writer and artist. Born in [[Los Angeles]] in 1958, Holbrook grew up in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], and began drawing at an early age.

Holbrook majored in Illustration and Visual Design at [[Auburn University]] in [[Alabama]]. During his college career, he served as the Art Director of the student newspaper, where he produced a weekly comic strip, as well as drawing the paper's editorial cartoons and being published regularly in the ''[[Huntsville Times]]'' and the ''[[Monroe Journal|Monroe (Ala.) Journal]]''. After graduation in 1980, he joined the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'' as an editorial staff artist. 

During a 1982 visit to relatives on the West Coast, Holbrook met legendary ''[[Peanuts]]'' creator, [[Charles Schulz]]. Following his advice and encouragement, Holbrook created a strip in the fall of that year about a college graduate working in a run-down diner. It did not stir syndicate interest, but what he learned on the strip helped him create his first winner, ''On the Fastrack''.

Eleven days before ''Fastrack'' made its syndicated debut on March 19, 1984, Holbrook met Teri Peitso on a blind date. They were married on [[Pearl Harbor Day]], 1985. They have two daughters, Chandler and Haviland. Peitso-Holbrook, whose novels were nominated for Edgar and Agatha Awards, is currently an assistant professor in literacy education at [[Georgia State University]]. The family lives in the [[Atlanta]] area.

In October 1989, Holbrook launched his second strip, ''Safe Havens'', and his third strip, ''Kevin &amp; Kell'' was begun in September 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onthefastrack.com/artist.html|title=On the Fastrack by Bill Holbrook - About|accessdate=2010-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comic strips==
Holbrook currently draws three strips:

* ''[[On the Fastrack]]'' - About the misadventures at Fastrack, Inc., ''On the Fastrack'' has been distributed by [[King Features Syndicate]] since 1984. It now appears in 75 newspapers nationwide.

* ''[[Safe Havens]]'' - Initially about a day care center, this strip evolved into the adventures of Samantha Argus and her friends and is now syndicated nationally to over 50 newspapers.

* ''[[Kevin and Kell]]'' - Originally an [[webcomic|online-only strip]] but now also published in the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', ''Kevin and Kell'' centers on the mixed marriage between a rabbit, Kevin  and a grey wolf, Kell Dewclaw. The plot revolves around species-related humor, satire, and interpersonal conflict.

He also provided artwork for a story written by [[Ben Bova]] and [[Rob Balder]]:
* ''[http://duelinthesomme.com/ Duel In The Somme]'' - A strip about a romantic rivalry between a computer-simulation designer and his boss.

=== Crossovers ===
As of May 2010, characters from ''On the Fastrack'' and ''Safe Havens'' are appearing in both strips.

==Work style==
Every week he writes the story line for the next three weeks for one of his strips and draws the next three weeks' worth of strips for another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comixtalk.com/ten_questions_with_bill_holbrook_of_kevin_and_kell|title=Ten Questions with Bill Holbrook of Kevin and Kell|publisher=Comixtalk|month=October | year=2004|accessdate=2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geusz|first=Phil|url=http://www.anthrozine.com/itvw/itv.holbrook.html|title=Guess who's coming to dinner?

==Personal life==
===Background===
Campbell was born in [[Royal Oak, Michigan|Royal Oak]], [[Michigan]], the son of Joanne Louise ([[married and maiden names|née]] Pickens), a homemaker, and Charles Newton Campbell, an amateur actor and traveling billboard inspector. He has an older brother, Don, and an older half-brother, Michael Rendine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800051843/bio Bruce Campbell Biography – Yahoo! Movies]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Campbell's first wife was Christine Deveau, whom he married in 1983. They had two children, Rebecca and Andy, before their divorce in 1989. Campbell currently lives in [[Jacksonville, Oregon|Jacksonville]], [[Oregon]], with his second wife, costume designer [[Ida Gearon]], whom he met in the set of the movie ''[[Mindwarp (film)|Mindwarp]]''.

==Career==
===Early years===
[[File:Bruce Campbell .jpg|thumb|right|Campbell signing a VHS copy of ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' at a fan meet-and-greet]]
Bruce Campbell began acting as a teenager and soon began making small [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] movies with friends. After meeting [[Sam Raimi]] in [[Wylie E. Groves High School]], the two became very good friends and started making movies together. Campbell would go on to attend [[Western Michigan University]] while he continued to work on his acting career. Campbell and Raimi collaborated on a 30-minute Super 8 version of the first ''Evil Dead'' film, titled ''Within the Woods'', which was initially used to attract investors.

===Major film roles===
A few years later, Campbell and Raimi got together with other family and friends and began work on ''[[The Evil Dead]]''. Campbell starred and worked behind the camera, receiving a &quot;co-executive producer&quot; credit. Raimi wrote, directed and edited, while fellow Michigander [[Robert Tapert|Rob Tapert]] was producer. 

Following an endorsement by horror writer [[Stephen King]], the film slowly began to receive distribution. Four years following its original release, it became the number one movie in the UK. It then received distribution in the U.S., spawning two [[sequel]]s: ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' and ''[[Army of Darkness]]''. The first two films in the series are considered horror classics and are credited with spawning the &quot;horror comedy&quot; genre.

He has appeared in many of Raimi's films outside of the ''Evil Dead'' series, notably including all the ''[[Spider-Man]]'' [[Spider-Man in film|film series]]. Bruce Campbell also joined the cast in Raimi's ''[[Darkman]]'' and ''[[The Quick and the Dead (1995 film)|The Quick and the Dead]]'', though having no actual screen time in the latter film's theatrical cut.

Campbell often takes on quirky roles, such as [[Elvis Presley]] in the film ''[[Bubba Ho-tep]]'', and appears in B-Movies and stared in ''[[My Name Is Bruce]]''. Along with ''Bubba Ho-tep'', he also played a supporting role in ''[[Sky High (2005 film)]]'',  He also was featured in the [[Jim Carrey]] drama ''[[The Majestic (film)|The Majestic]]''. Campbell also had a key supporting role in the [[Coen Brothers]] film ''[[The Hudsucker Proxy]]''. 

Other roles for Campbell included the [[Michael Crichton]] adaptation ''[[Congo (film)|Congo]]'', in the ''[[McHale's Navy (film)|McHale's Navy]]'' and the remake of [[John Carpenter]]'s sequel to his classic film [[Escape From New York]], ''[[Escape From L.A.]]''  Campbell was also the star of the ''[[Maniac Cop]]'' B-Movie franchise.

Campbell had a starring voice role in the hit film [[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|2009 animated adaptation]] of the children's book ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]''.

In January 2010, he stated in an interview that his new film project is called ''Bruce vs. Frankenstein''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35405/bruce-campbell-vs-frankenstein-gimme-some-stitches-baby|title=Bruce Campbell Vs. Frankenstein! Gimme Some Stitches, Baby!}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is directed and produced by his friend Mike Richardson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/43676|title=Listen up, screwheads! Bruce Campbell has a message for ya'!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television roles===
Outside of film, Campbell has appeared in a number of television series. He starred in ''[[The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.]]'' a boisterous science fiction comedy western created by [[Jeffrey Boam]] and [[Carlton Cuse]] that ran for one season. He played a lawyer turned bounty hunter who was trying to hunt down John Bly, the man who killed his father. He starred in the television series ''[[Jack of All Trades (TV series)|Jack of All Trades]]'', set on a fictional island, occupied by the French in 1801. Campbell was also credited as co-executive producer, among others. The show was directed by [[Eric Gruendemann]], and was produced by various people, including [[Sam Raimi]]. The show aired for two seasons, from 2000 to 2001. He had a recurring role as &quot;Bill Church Jr.&quot; on ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''.

In 1996–1997, Campbell was a recurring guest star on the show ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' as Ed Billik, who becomes Ellen's boss when she sells her bookstore in season four. He is also known for his supporting role as the [[recurring character]] [[Autolycus]] (&quot;the King of Thieves&quot;) on both ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]'' and ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'', which reunited him with producer Rob Tapert. Campbell played ''Hercules''/''Xena'' series producer Tapert in two episodes of ''Hercules'' set in the present. He directed a number of episodes of ''Hercules'' and ''Xena'', including the ''Hercules'' series finale.  Campbell also landed the lead role of race car driver Hank Cooper in the Disney [[television film|made-for-television]] [[remake]] of ''[[The Love Bug (1997 film)|The Love Bug]]''.

Campbell made a critically acclaimed dramatic guest role as a grief-stricken detective seeking revenge for his father's murder in a two-part episode of ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]''. Campbell later played the part of a bigamous demon in ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode, &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;. He also starred as Agent Jackman in the episode &quot;[[Witch Way Now?]]&quot; of the WB series ''[[Charmed]]'', as well as playing an FBI agent in an episode of the short-lived series ''[[American Gothic (TV series)|American Gothic]]'' titled &quot;Meet the Beetles&quot;.

Campbell currently stars on the television series ''[[Burn Notice]]'', which has aired since 2007 on [[USA Network]]. He portrays [[Sam Axe]], a beer-chugging, [[womanizing]] former [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] now working as an unlicensed [[private investigator]] and occasional [[mercenary]] with his old friend [[Michael Westen]], the show's main character. During Comic-Con 2010, it was revealed that Campbell would be the star of a ''Burn Notice'' made-for- television [[prequel]] focusing on Sam's Navy SEAL career, entitled ''[[Burn Notice: The Fall of Sam Axe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2010/07/burn-notice.html The Chicago Tribune]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice acting===
Campbell is featured as a voice actor in several video game titles. He provides the voice of Ash in the three games based on the ''Evil Dead'' film series; [[Evil Dead: Hail to the King]], [[Evil Dead: A Fistful of Boomstick]] and [[Evil Dead: Regeneration]]. As well as titles such as ''[[Pitfall 3D: Beyond the Jungle]]'', ''[[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|Spider-Man: The Movie]]'', ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]''. 

He provided the voice of main character [[Jake Logan]] in the PC title, ''[[Tachyon: The Fringe]]'', the voice of main character Jake Burton in the PlayStation game ''[[Broken Helix]]'' and the voice of Magnanimous in ''[[Megas XLR]]''. Campbell voiced the pulp adventurer [[Lobster Johnson]] in ''[[Hellboy: The Science of Evil]]'' and has done voice-over work for the Codemaster's game ''[[Heist (video game)|Hei$t]]'', a game which was announced on the 28 January 2010 to have been &quot;terminated&quot;.  Most recently he provided the voice of The Mayor in the 2009 film ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs]]'' He is scheduled to voice Rod &quot;Torque&quot; Redline in ''[[Cars 2]]''

===Writing===
====Autobiography====
[[Image:If Chins Could Kill Cover.jpg|right|thumb|100px|If Chins Could Kill]]
In addition to acting and occasionally directing, Campbell has become a writer, including authoring an [[autobiography]], ''If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor''. The autobiography was a successful [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/07/08/bsp/besthardnonfiction.html | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paperback version of the book adds a chapter about the reaction of fans at book signings. &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Whenever I do mainstream stuff, I think they're pseudo-interested, but they're still interested in seeing weirdo, offbeat stuff. And that's what I'm attracted to.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''If Chins Could Kill...'' was published in 2002 and follows Campbell's career to date as an actor in low-budget films and television, providing his insight into &quot;Blue-Collar Hollywood&quot;.

====Comedy====
Campbell has also written a book titled ''[[Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way]]'', a comical novel featuring himself as the main character struggling to make it into the world of [[A-list]] movies.

A '''boy band''' (or '''boyband''') is loosely defined as a [[popular music]] act consisting of only male [[singing|singers]]. The members are expected to [[dance]] as well as [[singing|sing]], usually giving highly [[choreography|choreographed]] performances. More often than not, boy band members do not play [[musical instrument]]s, either in recording sessions or on stage, and only sing and dance. However, exceptions do exist. In many cases boy bands are brought together by a producer through an audition process, although many of them form on their own. 

Some such bands can evolve out of church choral or [[Gospel music]] groups, but are often created by [[talent manager]]s or [[record producer]]s who hold auditions. Due to this and their general commercial orientation towards an audience of [[preteen]]s, [[teenybopper]]s, or [[teens]], the term may be used with negative connotations in [[music journalism]]. Boy bands are similar in concept to [[girl group]]s.

==History==
===Early history===
The earliest form of boy band music took place in the late 19th century with the use of a capella [[Barbershop quartets]]. They were usually a group of males and sing in four part harmonies. The popularity of Barbershop quartets had been prominent into the earlier part of the 20th century. A revival of the male vocal group took place in the late 1940s and 1950s with the use of [[Doo-wop]] music. Doo wop was a predecessor to the previous boy bands and they sung about topics such as love and other themes used in pop music. The earliest traces of boy bands were in the mid 1950s and the term boy band was not used. The Ink Spots was one of the first boy bands. The term boy band was not established until the late 1980s. Before that times they were called male vocal groups or hep harmony singing groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://didyouknow.org/boybands/&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
[[Image:Jackson-5-concert.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Jackson 5]] became an iconic [[R&amp;B]] boy band.]]
The earliest predecessors of the boy band genre were groups such as [[The Osmonds]], [[The Jackson 5]], and [[The Monkees]], which helped form the template for boy bands. While [[The Monkees]] were a manufactured act who featured members with distinct (albeit fictional) personality types, [[The Jackson 5]] were a family group that established many musical conventions that boy bands follow. For instance, their music featured [[close harmony|close harmonies]] from [[soul music]] and catchy pop hooks influenced as much as they were [[Motown]] acts like [[The Supremes]]. All members of the band sang, which is a common convention of boy band, as opposed to having a front man and the rest on instruments. This is effectively so that no one person dominated the stage. Even so, the members conveniently fitted into the convention of having stereotypical personality types ([[Michael Jackson]] being the &quot;[[cute]] one&quot;, to give an obvious example).

Although not a manufactured band, [[The Beatles]] set a precedent for boy bands to follow both in terms of marketing to young girls and certain aesthetic and musical conventions. The merchandising, whether it was films like ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' or novelty goods were possibly the first aimed at a certain demographic on a large scale for a group. This made them a proto-type for boy bands, such as [[The Jackson 5]] and [[The Monkees]]. Musical conventions that boy bands adopted from The Beatles were less their technical proficiency as musicians and more the catchy pop hooks, melodies and harmonies combined with their marketability. Their marketability was based the idea that there was something for everyone, whether it is the music or the personality of [[John Lennon]] or [[Paul McCartney]] or their [[sex appeal]].

The Beatles were more directly an influence on boy bands that use rock band instrumentation. The precedent for this was when TV Producers [[Bert Schneider]] and [[Bob Rafelson]] got four members to perform catchy pop tunes while also acting in a television series. The [[Monkees]] are often considered as the original pioneers among boy bands. Formed in 1965 under the supervision of [[Don Kirshner]], the group became dissatisfied with Kirshner's control and became independent two years later, and worked on their own up to 1970.

===1970s and 1980s===
Although the term &quot;boy band&quot; is mostly associated with groups from the 1990s onwards, other antecedents (apart from those already mentioned) exist throughout the history of pop music. The genre has been copied into languages and cultures other than the Anglo-American. There is a popular Russian boy band [[Ivanushki International]]. The Puerto Rican boy band [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], appealing to young [[Latina]] audiences, was founded in 1977. Menudo had a convention unique among boy bands: when a member turned 16, became too tall, or their voice changed, they were ejected and replaced. Members of Menudo were generally aged 12–14.

In the U.S., the [[Cleveland]]-based [[power pop]] group [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]] was generally interpreted as a &quot;teen act&quot;, although all the band members played their own music. [[Vocalist]] [[Eric Carmen]] later commented, &quot;You’d have a thousand screaming girls in the front of the stage and then ten very serious rock critics in the back of the room going, ‘Uh-huh, I think we understand this.’ And unfortunately the great mass of pot-smoking 18 year-olds that bought albums and made you a substantial commodity in the great marketing world of records never took to us. It was not hip for people to like us, because their little sister liked us.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Knopper, Steve. &quot;Raspberries.&quot; Contemporary Musicians. Gale Research Inc. 2004. Encyclopedia.com. 26 Dec. 2009 [http://www.encyclopedia.com encyclopedia.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
Although the term &quot;boy band&quot; did not exist until the 1990s, Boston group [[New Edition]] is credited for starting the boy band trend in the 1980s. [[Maurice Starr]] was influenced by New Edition and popularised it with his [[Mentorship|protégé]] [[New Kids on the Block]], the first commercially successful modern boy band. Starr's idea was to take the traditional template from the R&amp;B genre (in this case his teenage band [[New Edition]]) and apply it to a pop genre. Some managers in Europe created their own acts, beginning with [[Nigel Martin-Smith]]'s [[Take That]] in the [[UK]], followed by [[Louis Walsh]] and bands like [[East 17]], which by the late 1990s ran their course and split up. With the emergence of [[britpop]] and the commercial co-option of [[indie rock]], many boy bands were ridiculed by the British music press as having no artistic credibility.

Boy bands were prominent in the 1990s as well , but they did not explode until 1997. In the mid-1990s, most boy bands were African American and had R&amp;B and gospel elements, such as the group [[All-4-One|All 4 One]] and [[Boyz II Men]]. Although they had success on the Billboard charts, they had targeted more of an adult audience and were not marketed for youth.

One of the most successful boy band managers was [[Lou Pearlman]], who founded commercially successful acts such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] and [['N Sync]], although he was later convicted of unrelated fraud incidents. In the UK, producer [[Simon Cowell]] (noted in the U.S. for the American Idol/Pop Idol franchise) is also known for having managed boyband [[Westlife]], which was created by Louis Walsh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.yahoo.com/x-factor/judges/louis-walsh.html |title=Press Association - Louis Walsh Profile |publisher=Uk.tv.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted by a former boy band member [[Ronan Keating]] of [[Boyzone]].

===2000s===
[[Image:JonasBrothers.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Jonas Brothers]] are described as pop boy band]]
With the continued success of [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[*NSYNC]], groups like [[O-Town (band)|O-Town]] and [[98 Degrees]] gained quick popularity. International boy bands would also occasionally spring up, such as the [[Moldova]]n band [[O-Zone]] (better known today as an [[Numa numa|Internet meme]]).

Since 2001, the dominance of traditional boy bands on pop charts began to fade, although Gil Kaufman of [[MTV.com|MTV]] has described &quot;new boy bands&quot; that are &quot;more likely to resemble [[Good Charlotte]], [[Simple Plan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mtv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/b/boy_bands/050207/index.jhtml|title=The New Boy Bands|accessdate=November 8, 2007|publisher=MTV|year=2007|author=Gil Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Finland|Finnish]] rock band [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]] have been described by some, and even suggested by vocalist [[Ville Valo]]&lt;ref name=absolute_pictures&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepictures.com/news.php?id=5587|title=News | Valo: &quot;Him Could Be a Boyband&quot;|accessdate=May 7, 2011|publisher=Absolute Pictures: Your Daily Dose of Music|date=December 10, 2007|accessdate=May 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be a boy band, despite their slightly darker imagery. This view became increasingly popular around the time of their international breakthrough album, [[Razorblade Romance]], stemming from the amount of lyrics revolving around [[romance (love)|romance]], as well as the band members' on-stage personas and tendencies to jokingly interact with one another during shows.

Some bands typically labeled as 'boy bands' have achieved larger success because their members create and play their own songs, trying to keep a level of musical performance up to their image. [[Boston]]-based [[power pop]] group [[The Click Five]] is a recent example.&lt;ref name=take-five&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2005/08/07/take_five/|title=Take Five|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=August 7, 2005|accessdate=December 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[US5]], [[Lexington Bridge (band)|Lexington Bridge]] and [[JLS]] are examples of successful boy bands in Europe

Boy bands are still popular in Eastern Asia with successful groups such as South Korea's [[Super Junior]], [[TVXQ]], [[Big Bang (Korean band)|BIGBANG]], [[2PM]], [[Shinee|SHINee]], [[SS501]],  [[B2ST|BEAST/B2ST]], [[U-KISS]],[[MBLAQ]] and [[F.T. Island]]; members of the latter play instruments rather than dance. While Japan's [[Arashi]], [[SMAP]], [[V6]], [[Tokio (band)|Tokio]], [[KinKi Kids]], [[KAT-TUN]], [[NEWS]], [[Kanjani 8]], and [[Hey! Say! JUMP]] top the [[Oricon]] charts.

In 2001 a new all-male Japanese pop band and dance group boyband hailing from Japan called EXILE, debuted under Avex Group's label [[Rhythm Zone]] with 14 members, putting them on par with [[Super Junior]] as the largest boy bands in the world. [[Jonas Brothers]] had popularity during 2008 selling over 180,000 copies on albums

==Key factors of the concept==
Seen as important to a &quot;boy band&quot; group's commercial success is the group's [[Reputation|image]], carefully controlled by managing all aspects of the group's dress, promotional materials (which are frequently supplied to [[teen magazine]]s), and [[music video]]s. Typically, each member of the group will have some distinguishing feature and be portrayed as having a particular personality stereotype, such as &quot;the baby,&quot; &quot;the bad boy,&quot; or &quot;the nice boy.&quot; While managing the portrayal of popular musicians is as old as [[popular music]], the particular pigeonholing of band members is a defining characteristic of boy and girl bands.

In most cases, their music is written, arranged and produced by a producer who works with the band at all times and controls the group's sound - if necessary, to the point of hiring [[session singers]] to record guide vocals for each member of the group to sing individually if the members cannot harmonize well together. However, for clarity of each voice, recording each voice individually is most commonly the norm with most modern vocal groups.

A typical boy band performance features elaborately [[choreography|choreographed]] dancing, with the members taking turns singing and/or rapping. Boy bands generally do not compose or produce their own material, unless the members lobby hard enough for creative control (for example, [[The Monkees]], The Fukui Boys, and [['N Sync]]). It is not uncommon to find extra songs on the album written by one or more of the band members, however their producers rarely use these as singles. UK boyband [[Five (band)|Five]] wrote almost all their own songs. 

The key factor of a boy band is being trendy. This means that the band conforms to the most recent fashion and musical trends in the popular music scene. As of 2008, boy bands are more likely to be imitating [[pop punk]] acts like [[Blink 182]], as well as the corresponding &quot;[[emo]]/[[pop punk]]&quot; fashion, but some imitate 1960s surf and [[garage rock]] revivalist acts like [[The Horrors]] {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} or post-punk revivalists like [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}, as it is the current trend.

==Music genres==
Although most boy bands consist of [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] or [[pop music|pop]] influences, other [[music genre]]s, most notably [[country music]] and [[folk music]], are also represented. [[South 65]] and [[Marshall Dyllon]], for example, were both considered country music boy bands, as was to a lesser extent [[Rascal Flatts]]. [[Il Divo]], created by [[Simon Cowell]] in 2004, are a band that perform [[Operatic pop]], and in several (mainly Italian) languages. Since then operatic/classical boy bands have become quite popular and common, especially in the UK. Since 2001 there has been some crossover with [[power pop]] and [[pop punk]] from bands that play live instruments. For example, as of 2008, boy bands are often influenced by [[pop punk]], [[post-grunge]], 1960s [[garage rock]] {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}, [[post punk revival]]ists, [[power pop]] (a perennial genre) and [[dance-punk]] {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.  Just recently some boy bands decided to go back to their original doo-wop roots, most notably, [[The Overtones]].

==Criticism==
Since the 1990s, bands such as [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[LFO (group)|LFO]] have disliked the term &quot;boy band&quot; and have preferred to be known as a &quot;Male Vocal Group&quot;. Boy bands have been accused by the music press of emphasizing the appearance and marketing of the group above the quality of music, deliberately trying to appeal to a [[pre-teen]] audience and for conforming to trends instead of being original.Such criticisms can become extremely scathing. Boy bands are often seen as being short lived, though some acts such as [[The Jackson 5]], [[New Kids On The Block]], the [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Boyzone]], [[Westlife]] and [[Take That]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6480113.ece Times Online: Why are Take That's fans so loyal?]&lt;/ref&gt; have sustained lasting careers, and in some cases, successful comebacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filipinocultured.blogspot.com/2008/05/new-kids-on-block-on-today-show.html New Kids On The Block Today Show Videos]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]], a '''B-tree''' is a [[tree data structure]] that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic [[Amortized analysis|amortized time]]. The B-tree is a generalization of a [[binary search tree]] in that a node can have more than two children.  {{Harv|Comer|p=123}}  Unlike [[self-balancing binary search tree]]s, the B-tree is optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data. It is commonly used in [[database]]s and [[filesystem]]s.

[[File:B-tree.svg|thumb|400px|right|A B-tree of order 2 {{Harv|Bayer|McCreight|1972}} or order 5 {{Harv|Knuth|1997}}.]]

== Overview ==

In B-trees, internal ([[Leaf node|non-leaf]]) nodes can have a variable number of child nodes within some pre-defined range. When data is inserted or removed from a node, its number of child nodes changes. In order to maintain the pre-defined range, internal nodes may be joined or split. Because a range of child nodes is permitted, B-trees do not need re-balancing as frequently as other [[self-balancing binary search tree|self-balancing search tree]]s, but may waste some space, since nodes are not entirely full. The lower and upper bounds on the number of child nodes are typically fixed for a particular implementation. For example, in a 2-3 B-tree (often simply referred to as a '''[[2-3 tree]]'''), each internal node may have only 2 or 3 child nodes.

Each internal node of a B-tree will contain a number of keys. Usually, the number of keys is chosen to vary between &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2d&lt;/math&gt;. In practice, the keys take up the most space in a node. The factor of 2 will guarantee that nodes can be split or combined.  If an internal node has &lt;math&gt;2d&lt;/math&gt; keys, then adding a key to that node can be accomplished by splitting the &lt;math&gt;2d&lt;/math&gt; key node into two &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; key nodes and adding the key to the parent node.  Each split node has the required minimum number of keys.  Similarly, if an internal node and its neighbor each have &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; keys, then a key may be deleted from the internal node by combining with its neighbor. Deleting the key would make the internal node have &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt; keys; joining the neighbor would add &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; keys plus one more key brought down from the neighbor's parent. The result is an entirely full node of &lt;math&gt;2d&lt;/math&gt; keys.

The number of branches (or child nodes) from a node will be one more than the number of keys stored in the node.  In a 2-3 B-tree, the internal nodes will store either one key (with two child nodes) or two keys (with three child nodes).  A B-tree is sometimes described with the parameters &lt;math&gt;(d+1)&lt;/math&gt; — &lt;math&gt;(2d+1)&lt;/math&gt; or simply with the highest branching order, &lt;math&gt;(2d+1)&lt;/math&gt;.

A B-tree is kept balanced by requiring that all [[leaf node]]s are at the same depth. This depth will increase slowly as elements are added to the tree, but an increase in the overall depth is infrequent, and results in all leaf nodes being one more node further away from the root.

B-trees have substantial advantages over alternative implementations when node access times far exceed access times within nodes.  This usually occurs when the nodes are in [[secondary storage]] such as [[hard drive|disk drives]].  By maximizing the number of [[child node]]s within each [[internal node]], the height of the tree decreases and the number of expensive node accesses is reduced. In addition, rebalancing the tree occurs less often. The maximum number of child nodes depends on the information that must be stored for each child node and the size of a full [[Block size (data storage and transmission)|disk block]] or an analogous size in secondary storage. While 2-3 B-trees are easier to explain, practical B-trees using secondary storage want a large number of child nodes to improve performance.

===Variants===
The term '''B-tree''' may refer to a                   specific design or it may refer to a general class of designs.  In the narrow sense, a B-tree stores keys in its internal nodes but need not store those keys in the records at the leaves.  The general class includes variations such as the [[B+ tree|B&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-tree]] and the [[B*-tree|B&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;-tree]].
*In the B&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-tree, copies of the keys are stored in the internal nodes; the keys and records are stored in leaves; in addition, a leaf node may include a pointer to the next leaf node to speed sequential access.{{Harv|Comer|p=129}}
*The B&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;-tree balances more neighboring internal nodes to keep the internal nodes more densely packed.{{Harv|Comer|p=129}} For example, a non-root node of a B-tree must be at least half full, but a non-root node of a B&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;-tree must be at least two-thirds full.
*Counted B-trees store, with each pointer within the tree, the number of nodes in the subtree below that pointer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/algorithms/cbtree.html Counted B-Trees], retrieved 2010-01-25&lt;/ref&gt; This allows rapid searches for the Nth record in key order, or counting the number of records between any two records, and various other related operations.

===Etymology unknown===
[[Rudolf Bayer]] and [[Edward M. McCreight|Ed McCreight]] invented the B-tree while working at [[Boeing|Boeing Research Labs]] in 1971 {{Harv|Bayer|McCreight|1972}}, but they did not explain what, if anything, the ''B'' stands for. [[Douglas Comer]] explains:
:The origin of &quot;B-tree&quot; has never been explained by the authors.  As we shall see, &quot;balanced,&quot; &quot;broad,&quot; or &quot;bushy&quot; might apply. Others suggest that the &quot;B&quot; stands for Boeing. Because of his contributions, however, it seems appropriate to think of B-trees as &quot;Bayer&quot;-trees. {{Harv|Comer|1979|p=123 footnote 1}}

Donald Knuth speculates on the etymology of B-trees in his May, 1980 lecture on the topic &quot;CS144C classroom lecture about disk storage and B-trees&quot;, suggesting the &quot;B&quot; may have originated from Boeing or from Bayer's name. [http://scpd.stanford.edu/knuth/index.jsp Knuth's video lectures from Stanford]

== The database problem ==
=== Time to search a sorted file ===

Usually, sorting and searching algorithms have been characterized by the number of comparison operations that must be performed using [[Big O notation|order notation]]. A [[binary search]] of a sorted table with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; records, for example, can be done in &lt;math&gt;O(\log_2 N)&lt;/math&gt; comparisons.  If the table had 1,000,000 records, then a specific record could be located with about 20 comparisons: &lt;math&gt;\log_2 1,000,000 = 19.931... &lt;/math&gt;. 

Large databases have historically been kept on disk drives. The time to read a record on a disk drive can dominate the time needed to compare keys once the record is available. The time to read a record from a disk drive involves a [[seek time]] and a rotational delay.  The seek time may be 0 to 20 or more milliseconds, and the rotational delay averages about half the rotation period. For a 7200 RPM drive, the rotation period is 8.33 milliseconds. For a drive such as the Seagate ST3500320NS, the track-to-track seek time is 0.8 milliseconds and the average reading seek time is 8.5 milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;Seagate Technology LLC, Product Manual: Barracuda ES.2 Serial ATA, Rev. F., publication 100468393, 2008 [http://www.seagate.com/staticfiles/support/disc/manuals/NL35%20Series%20&amp;%20BC%20ES%20Series/Barracuda%20ES.2%20Series/100468393f.pdf], page 6&lt;/ref&gt; For simplicity, assume reading from disk takes about 10 milliseconds.

Naively, then, the time to locate one record out of a million would take 20 disk reads times 10 milliseconds per disk read, which is 0.2 seconds.

The time won't be that bad because individual records are grouped together in a disk '''block'''.  A disk block might be 16 kilobytes. If each record is 160 bytes, then 100 records could be stored in each block.  The disk read time above was actually for an entire block.  Once the disk head is in position, one or more disk blocks can be read with little delay.  With 100 records per block, the last 6 or so comparisons don't need to do any disk reads—the comparisons are all within the last disk block read.

To speed the search further, the first 13 to 14 comparisons (which each required a disk access) must be sped up.

=== An index speeds the search ===

A significant improvement can be made with an [[Index (database)|index]]. In the example above, initial disk reads narrowed the search range by a factor of two.  That can be improved substantially by creating an auxiliary index that contains the first record in each disk block (sometimes called a [[Index (database)#Sparse index|sparse index]]).  This auxiliary index would be 1% of the size of the original database, but it can be searched more quickly.  Finding an entry in the auxiliary index would tell us which block to search in the main database; after searching the auxiliary index, we would have to search only that one block of the main database—at a cost of one more disk read.  The index would hold 10,000 entries, so it would take at most 14 comparisons. Like the main database, the last 6 or so comparisons in the aux index would be on the same disk block.  The index could be searched in about 8 disk reads, and the desired record could be accessed in 9 disk reads.

The trick of creating an auxiliary index can be repeated to make an auxiliary index to the auxiliary index.  That would make an aux-aux index that would need only 100 entries and would fit in one disk block.

Instead of reading 14 disk blocks to find the desired record, we only need to read 3 blocks.  Reading and searching the first (and only) block of the aux-aux index identifies the relevant block in aux-index. Reading and searching that aux-index block identifies the relevant block in the main database. Instead of 150 milliseconds, we need only 30 milliseconds to get the record.

The auxiliary indices have turned the search problem from a binary search requiring roughly &lt;math&gt;\log_2 N&lt;/math&gt; disk reads to one requiring only &lt;math&gt;\log_b N&lt;/math&gt; disk reads where &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the blocking factor (the number of entries per block: &lt;math&gt;b = 100&lt;/math&gt; entries per block; &lt;math&gt;log_b 1,000,000 = 3&lt;/math&gt; reads).

In practice, if the main database is being frequently searched, the aux-aux index and much of the aux index may reside in a [[page cache|disk cache]], so they would not incur a disk read.

=== Insertions and deletions cause trouble ===

If the database does not change, then compiling the index is simple to do, and the index need never be changed.  If there are changes, then managing the database and its index becomes more complicated.

Deleting records from a database doesn't cause much trouble.  The index can stay the same, and the record can just be marked as deleted.  The database stays in sorted order.  If there are a lot of deletions, then the searching and storage become less efficient.

Insertions are a disaster in a sorted sequential file because room for the inserted record must be made. Inserting a record before the first record in the file requires shifting all of the records down one. Such an operation is just too expensive to be practical.

A trick is to leave some space lying around to be used for insertions.  Instead of densely storing all the records in a block, the block can have some free space to allow for subsequent insertions.  Those records would be marked as if they were &quot;deleted&quot; records.

Now, both insertions and deletions are fast as long as space is available on a block.  If an insertion won't fit on the block, then some free space on some nearby block must be found and the auxiliary indices adjusted. The hope is enough space is nearby that a lot of blocks do not need to be reorganized. Alternatively, some out-of-sequence disk blocks may be used.

=== The B-tree uses all those ideas ===

The B-tree uses all the above ideas.  It keeps the records in sorted order so they may be sequentially traversed.  It uses a hierarchical index to minimize the number of disk reads.  The index is elegantly adjusted with a recursive algorithm.  The B-tree uses partially full blocks to speed insertions and deletions.  In addition, a B-tree minimizes waste by making sure the interior nodes are at least 1/2 full.  A B-tree can handle an arbitrary number of insertions and deletions.

== Technical description ==
=== Terminology ===

The terminology used for B-trees is inconsistent in the literature:

:Unfortunately, the literature on B-trees is not uniform in its use of terms relating to B-Trees. {{Harv|Folk|Zoellick|1992|p=362}}

{{Harvtxt|Bayer|McCreight|1972}}, {{Harvtxt|Comer|1979}}, and others define the '''order''' of B-tree as the minimum number of keys in a non-root node.  {{Harvtxt|Folk|Zoellick|1992}} points out that terminology is ambiguous because the maximum number of keys is not clear.  An order 3 B-tree might hold a maximum of 6 keys or a maximum of 7 keys.  {{Harvtxt|Knuth|1993b}} avoids the problem by defining the '''order''' to be maximum number of children (which is one more than the maximum number of keys).

The term '''leaf''' is also inconsistent.  {{Harvtxt|Bayer|McCreight|1972}} considered the leaf level to be the lowest level of keys, but {{Harvtxt|Knuth|1993b}} considered the leaf level to be one level below the lowest keys.  {{Harv|Folk|Zoellick|1992|p=363}}  There are many possible implementation choices.  In some designs, the leaves may hold the entire data record; in other designs, the leaves may only hold pointers to the data record.  Those choices are not fundamental to the idea of a B-tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bayer|McCreight|1972}} avoided the issue by saying an index element is a (physically adjacent) pair of &lt;math&gt;(x, a)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the key, and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is some associated information.  The associated information might be a pointer to a record or records in a random access, but what it was didn't really matter.  {{Harvtxt|Bayer|McCreight|1972}} states, &quot;For this paper the associated information is of no further interest.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also unfortunate choices like using the variable &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; to represent the number of children when &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; could be confused with the number of keys.

For simplicity, most authors assume there are a fixed number of keys that fit in a node. The basic assumption is the key size is fixed and the node size is fixed. In practice, variable length keys may be employed.  {{Harv|Folk|Zoellick|1992|p=379}}

=== Definition ===
According to Knuth's definition, a B-tree of order ''m'' (the maximum number of children for each node) is a tree which satisfies the following properties:
# Every node has at most ''m'' children.
# Every node (except root) has at least {{frac|''m''|2}} children.
# The root has at least two children if it is not a leaf node.
# All leaves appear in the same level, and carry information.
# A non-leaf node with ''k'' children contains ''k''−1 keys.

Each internal node's elements act as separation values which divide its [[subtree]]s. For example, if an internal node has three child nodes (or subtrees) then it must have two separation values or elements ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. All values in the leftmost subtree will be less than ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; , all values in the middle subtree will be between ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and all values in the rightmost subtree will be greater than ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Internal nodes in a B-tree – nodes which are not leaf nodes – are usually represented as an ordered set of elements and child pointers. Every internal node contains a '''maximum''' of ''U'' children and – other than the root – a '''minimum''' of ''L'' children.  For all internal nodes other than the root, the number of elements is one less than the number of child pointers; the number of elements is between ''L''−1 and ''U''−1.  The number ''U'' must be either 2''L'' or 2''L''−1; thus each internal node is at least half full.  This relationship between ''U'' and ''L'' implies that two half-full nodes can be joined to make a legal node,  and one full node can be split into two legal nodes (if there is room to push one element up into the parent).  These properties make it possible to delete and insert new values into a B-tree and adjust the tree to preserve the B-tree properties.

Leaf nodes have the same restriction on the number of elements, but have no children, and no child pointers.

The root node still has the upper limit on the number of children, but has no lower limit. For example, when there are fewer than ''L''−1 elements in the entire tree, the root will be the only node in the tree, and it will have no children at all.

A B-tree of depth ''n''+1 can hold about ''U'' times as many items as a B-tree of depth ''n'', but the cost of search, insert, and delete operations grows with the depth of the tree. As with any balanced tree, the cost grows much more slowly than the number of elements.

Some balanced trees store values only at the leaf nodes, and so have different kinds of nodes for leaf nodes and internal nodes. B-trees keep values in every node in the tree, and may use the same structure for all nodes. However, since leaf nodes never have children, a specialized structure for leaf nodes in B-trees will improve performance.

==Best case and worst case heights==
The best case height of a B-Tree is:
: &lt;math&gt;\log_{m} n.\ &lt;/math&gt;
The worst case height of a B-Tree is:
: &lt;math&gt;\log_{m/2}n\ &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum number of children a node can have.

'''Warning''': the discussion below uses &quot;element&quot;, &quot;value&quot;, &quot;key&quot;, &quot;separator&quot;, and &quot;separation value&quot; to mean essentially the same thing.  The terms are not clearly defined.  There are some subtle issues at the root and leaves.

=== Search ===
Searching is similar to searching a [[binary search tree]]. Starting at the root, the tree is recursively traversed from top to bottom.  At each level, the search chooses the child pointer (subtree) whose separation values are on either side of the search value.

[[Binary search]] is typically (but not necessarily) used within nodes to find the separation values and child tree of interest.

=== Insertion ===

[[Image:B tree insertion example.png|thumb|A B Tree insertion example with each iteration.]]

All insertions start at a leaf node. To insert a new element

Search the tree to find the leaf node where the new element should be added.  Insert the new element into that node with the following steps:

# If the node contains fewer than the maximum legal number of elements, then there is room for the new element. Insert the new element in the node, keeping the node's elements ordered.
# Otherwise the node is full, so evenly split it into two nodes.
## A single median is chosen from among the leaf's elements and the new element.
## Values less than the median are put in the new left node and values greater than the median are put in the new right node, with the median acting as a separation value.
## Insert the separation value in the node's parent, which may cause it to be split, and so on. If the node has no parent (i.e., the node was the root), create a new root above this node (increasing the height of the tree).

If the splitting goes all the way up to the root, it creates a new root with a single separator value and two children, which is why the lower bound on the size of internal nodes does not apply to the root.  The maximum number of elements per node is ''U''−1.  When a node is split, one element moves to the parent, but one element is added.  So, it must be possible to divide the maximum number ''U''−1 of elements into two legal nodes.  If this number is odd, then ''U''=2''L'' and one of the new nodes contains (''U''−2)/2 = ''L''−1 elements, and hence is a legal node, and the other contains one more element, and hence it is legal too. If ''U''−1 is even, then ''U''=2''L''−1, so there are 2''L''−2 elements in the node.  Half of this number is ''L''−1, which is the minimum number of elements allowed per node.  

An improved algorithm supports a single pass down the tree from the root to the node where the insertion will take place, splitting any full nodes encountered on the way.  This prevents the need to recall the parent nodes into memory, which may be expensive if the nodes are on secondary storage.  However, to use this improved algorithm, we must be able to send one element to the parent and split the remaining ''U''−2 elements into two legal nodes, without adding a new element.  This requires ''U'' = 2''L'' rather than ''U'' = 2''L''−1, which accounts for why some textbooks impose this requirement in defining B-trees.

=== Deletion ===

There are two popular strategies for deletion from a B-Tree.

* locate and delete the item, then restructure the tree to regain its invariants
or
* do a single pass down the tree, but before entering (visiting) a node, restructure the tree so that once the key to be deleted is encountered, it can be deleted without triggering the need for any further restructuring

The algorithm below uses the former strategy. 

There are two special cases to consider when deleting an element: 
# the element in an internal node may be a separator for its child nodes
# deleting an element may put its node under the minimum number of elements and children.

Each of these cases will be dealt with in order.

==== Deletion from a leaf node ====
* Search for the value to delete.
* If the value is in a leaf node, it can simply be deleted from the node,
* If underflow happens, check siblings to either transfer a key or fuse the siblings together.
*if deletion happened from right child retrieve the max value of left child if there is no underflow in left child
*in vice-versa situation  retrieve the min element from right

==== Deletion from an internal node ====
Each element in an internal node acts as a separation value for two subtrees, and when such an element is deleted, two cases arise. In the first case, both of the two child nodes to the left and right of the deleted element have the minimum number of elements, namely ''L''−1.  They can then be joined into a single node with 2''L''−2 elements, a number which does not exceed ''U''−1 and so is a legal node. Unless it is known that this particular B-tree does not contain duplicate data, we must then also (recursively) delete the element in question from the new node.

In the second case, one of the two child nodes contains more than the minimum number of elements. Then a new separator for those subtrees must be found. Note that the largest element in the left subtree is still less than the separator. Likewise, the smallest element in the right subtree is the smallest element which is still greater than the separator. Both of those elements are in leaf nodes, and either can be the new separator for the two subtrees.

* If the value is in an internal node, choose a new separator (either the largest element in the left subtree or the smallest element in the right subtree), remove it from the leaf node it is in, and replace the element to be deleted with the new separator.
* This has deleted an element from a leaf node, and so is now equivalent to the previous case.

==== Rebalancing after deletion ====
If deleting an element from a leaf node has brought it under the minimum size, some elements must be redistributed to bring all nodes up to the minimum. In some cases the rearrangement will move the deficiency to the parent, and the redistribution must be applied iteratively up the tree, perhaps even to the root. Since the minimum element count doesn't apply to the root, making the root be the only deficient node is not a problem. The algorithm to rebalance the tree is as follows:{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

* If the right sibling has more than the minimum number of elements
** Add the separator to the end of the deficient node.
** Replace the separator in the parent with the first element of the right sibling.
** Append the first child of the right sibling as the last child of the deficient node
* Otherwise, if the left sibling has more than the minimum number of elements.
** Add the separator to the start of the deficient node.
** Replace the separator in the parent with the last element of the left sibling.
** Insert the last child of the left sibling as the first child of the deficient node
* If both immediate siblings have only the minimum number of elements
** Create a new node with all the elements from the deficient node, all the elements from one of its siblings, and the separator in the parent between the two combined sibling nodes.
** Remove the separator from the parent, and replace the two children it separated with the combined node.
** If that brings the number of elements in the parent under the minimum, repeat these steps with that deficient node, unless it is the root, since the root is permitted to be deficient.

The only other case to account for is when the root has no elements and one child.  In this case it is sufficient to replace it with its only child.

===Initial construction===

In applications, it is frequently useful to build a B-tree to represent a large existing collection of data and then update it incrementally using standard B-tree operations. In this case, the most efficient way to construct the initial B-tree is not to insert every element in the initial collection successively, but instead to construct the initial set of leaf nodes directly from the input, then build the internal nodes from these. This approach to B-tree construction is called [[bulkloading]]. Initially, every leaf but the last one has one extra element, which will be used to build the internal nodes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

For example, if the leaf nodes have maximum size 4 and the initial collection is the integers 1 through 24, we would initially construct 4 leaf nodes containing 5 values each and 1 which contains 4 values:

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|1||2||3||4||5
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|6||7||8||9||10
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|11||12||13||14||15
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|16||17||18||19||20
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|21||22||23||24
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

We build the next level up from the leaves by taking the last element from each leaf node except the last one. Again, each node except the last will contain one extra value. In the example, suppose the internal nodes contain at most 2 values (3 child pointers). Then the next level up of internal nodes would be:

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|5||10||15
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|20
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|1||2||3||4
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|6||7||8||9
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|11||12||13||14
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|16||17||18||19
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|21||22||23||24
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

This process is continued until we reach a level with only one node and it is not overfilled. In the example only the root level remains:

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|15
|}
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|5||10
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|20
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|1||2||3||4
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|6||7||8||9
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|11||12||13||14
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|16||17||18||19
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|21||22||23||24
|}
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== B-trees in filesystems ==

In addition to its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary block in a particular file.  The basic problem is turning the file block &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; address into a disk block (or perhaps to a [[cylinder-head-sector]]) address.

Some operating systems require the user to allocate the maximum size of the file when the file is created.  The file can then be allocated as contiguous disk blocks.  Converting to a disk block: the operating system just adds the file block address to the starting disk block of the file.  The scheme is simple, but the file cannot exceed its created size.

Other operating systems allow a file to grow.  The resulting disk blocks may not be contiguous, so mapping logical blocks to physical blocks is more involved.

[[MS-DOS]], for example, used a simple [[File Allocation Table]] (FAT).  The FAT has an entry for each disk block,&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;For FAT, what is called a &quot;disk block&quot; here is what the FAT documentation calls a &quot;cluster&quot;, which is fixed-size group of one or more contiguous whole physical disk [[Cylinder-head-sector|sectors]].  For the purposes of this discussion, a cluster has no significant difference from a physical sector.&lt;/ref&gt; and that entry identifies whether its block is used by a file and if so, which block (if any) is the next disk block of the same file.  So, the allocation of each file is represented as a [[linked list]] in the table.  In order to find the disk address of file block &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, the operating system (or disk utility) must sequentially follow the file's linked list in the FAT.  Worse, to find a free disk block, it must sequentially scan the FAT.  For MS-DOS, that was not a huge penalty because the disks and files were small and the FAT had few entries and relatively short file chains.  In the [[FAT12]] filesystem (used on floppy disks and early hard disks), there were no more than 4,080 &lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Two of these were reserved for special purposes, so only 4078 could actually represent disk blocks (clusters).&lt;/ref&gt; entries, and the FAT would usually be resident in memory.  As disks got bigger, the FAT architecture began to confront penalties.  On a large disk using FAT, it may be necessary to perform disk reads to learn the disk location of a file block to be read or written.

[[TOPS-20]] (and possibly [[TENEX]]) used a 0 to 2 level tree that has similarities to a B-Tree{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.  A disk block was 512 36-bit words.  If the file fit in a 512 (&lt;math&gt;2^9&lt;/math&gt;) word block, then the file directory would point to that physical disk block.  If the file fit in &lt;math&gt;2^{18}&lt;/math&gt; words, then the directory would point to an aux index; the 512 words of that index would either be NULL (the block isn't allocated) or point to the physical address of the block.  If the file fit in &lt;math&gt;2^{27}&lt;/math&gt; words, then the directory would point to a block holding an aux-aux index; each entry would either be NULL or point to an aux index.  Consequently, the physical disk block for a &lt;math&gt;2^{27}&lt;/math&gt; word file could be located in two disk reads and read on the third.

Apple's filesystem [[HFS+]], Microsoft's [[NTFS]]&lt;ref name=insidewin2kntfs&gt;{{cite web

===Access concurrency===
Lehman and Yao&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=319663&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;CFID=61777986&amp;CFTOKEN=74351190&lt;/ref&gt; showed that all read locks could be avoided (and thus concurrent access greatly improved) by linking the tree blocks at each level together with a &quot;next&quot; pointer. This results in a tree structure where both insertion and search operations descend from the root to the leaf. Write locks are only required as a tree block is modified. This maximizes access concurrency by multiple users, an important consideration for [[database]]s and/or other B-Tree based [[ISAM]] storage methods. The cost associated with this improvement is that empty pages cannot be removed from the btree during normal operations. (However, see &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA232287&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; for various strategies to implement node merging, and source code at.&lt;ref&gt;http://code.google.com/p/high-concurrency-btree/downloads/list&lt;/ref&gt;)

United States Patent 5283894, granted In 1994, appears to show a way to use a 'Meta Access Method' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5283894.html Lockless Concurrent B+Tree&lt;/ref&gt; to allow concurrent B+Tree access and modification without locks. The technique accesses the tree 'upwards' for both searches and updates by means of additional in-memory indexes that point at the blocks in each level in the block cache. No reorganization for deletes is needed and there are no 'next' pointers in each block as in Lehman and Yao.

[[File:British Museum Great Court roof.jpg|thumb|The centre of the museum was redeveloped in 2001 to become the [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court|Great Court]], surrounding the original [[British Museum Reading Room|Reading Room]].]]

The '''British Museum''' is a [[museum]] of human history and culture in London. Its collections, which number more than seven million objects,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/museum_in_london.aspx |title=British Museum website |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; are amongst the largest and most comprehensive in the world and originate from all continents, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}}

The British Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the physician and scientist [[Hans Sloane|Sir Hans Sloane]]. The museum first opened to the public on 15 January 1759 in [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]] in [[Bloomsbury]], on the site of the current museum building. Its expansion over the following two and a half centuries was largely a result of an expanding British colonial footprint and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, the first being the [[Natural History Museum|British Museum (Natural History)]] in [[South Kensington]] in 1887. Some objects in the collection, most notably the [[Elgin Marbles]] from the [[Parthenon]], are the objects of intense controversy and of calls for restitution to their countries of origin.

Until 1997, when the [[British Library]] (previously centred on the [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]]) moved to a new site, the British Museum was unique in that it housed both a national museum of [[antiquities]] and a [[national library]] in the same building. The museum is a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], and as with all other national museums in the [[United Kingdom]] it charges no admission fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/visiting/admission_and_opening_times.aspx |title=Admission and opening times |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002 the [[Director of the British Museum|director of the museum]] has been [[Neil MacGregor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1682270.stm | work=BBC News | title=National man for British Museum | date=29 November 2001 | accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
===Sir Hans Sloane, founder of the British Museum===
[[File:Sir Hans Sloane, an engraving from a portrait by T. Murray.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[Hans Sloane]]]]

Although principally a museum of cultural art objects and [[Ancient history|antiquities]] today, the British Museum was founded as a &quot;universal museum&quot;. Its foundations lie in the will of the physician and naturalist [[Hans Sloane|Sir Hans Sloane]] (1660–1753). During the course of his lifetime Sloane gathered an enviable [[cabinet of curiosities|collection of curiosities]] and, not wishing to see his collection broken up after death, he bequeathed it to [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]], for the nation, for the princely sum of £20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fathom.com/course/21701728/session1.html |title=Creating a Great Museum: Early Collectors and The British Museum |publisher=Fathom.com |date= |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, Sloane’s collection consisted of around 71,000 objects of all kinds&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/history/general_history.aspx |title=General history |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including some 40,000 printed books, 7,000 [[manuscript]]s, extensive natural history specimens including 337 volumes of dried plants, [[Old master print|prints]] and drawings including those by [[Albrecht Dürer]] and antiquities from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], the [[Ancient Near East|Ancient Near]] and [[East Asia|Far East]] and the [[History of the Americas|Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;Gavin R de Beer, Sir Hans Sloane and the British Museum (London, 1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation (1753)===
On 7 June 1753, King George II gave his formal assent to the [[Act of Parliament]] which established the British Museum.{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland, 1701 to 1800|The Foundation Act]], added two other libraries to the Sloane collection. The [[Cotton library|Cottonian Library]], assembled by [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Sir Robert Cotton]], dated back to [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] times and the [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Harleian library]], the collection of the [[Earl of Oxford|Earls of Oxford]]. They were joined in 1757 by the Royal Library, assembled by various [[British monarchy|British monarchs]]. Together these four &quot;foundation collections&quot; included many of the most treasured books now in the British Library&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Charles Long (1823), BMCE115/3,10. Scrapbooks and illustrations of the Museum. (Wilson, David, M.) (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, pg 346&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] and the sole surviving copy of ''[[Beowulf]]''.{{Ref_label|C|c|none}}

The British Museum was the first of a new kind of museum – national, belonging to neither church nor king, freely open to the public and aiming to collect everything. Sloane's collection, whilst including a vast miscellany of objects, tended to reflect his scientific interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bmimages.com/preview.asp?image=00032676001&amp;imagex=90&amp;searchnum=0001 |title=The British Museum Images |publisher=Bmimages.com |date= |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of the [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Cotton]] and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Harley manuscripts]] introduced a literary and [[antiquarian]] element and meant that the British Museum now became both national museum and library.&lt;ref name=&quot;world and its people&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

===Cabinet of curiosities (1753-78)===
[[File:The North Prospect of Mountague House JamesSimonc1715.jpg|thumb|right|[[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]]]]

The body of trustees decided on a converted 17th-century mansion, [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], as a location for the museum, which it bought from the [[Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu|Montagu family]] for £20,000. The Trustees rejected Buckingham House, on the site now occupied by [[Buckingham Palace]], on the grounds of cost and the unsuitability of its location.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, pg 25&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref_label|D|d|none}}

With the acquisition of Montagu House the first exhibition galleries and [[Library|reading room]] for scholars opened on 15 January 1759.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=33121&amp;amid=30262261 The British Museum Opened], History Today&lt;/ref&gt; In 1757 King George II gave the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Old Royal Library]] and with it the right to a copy of every book published in the country, thereby ensuring that the Museum's library would expand indefinitely. The predominance of natural history, books and manuscripts began to lessen when in 1772 the Museum acquired its first antiquities of note; [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]'s collection of [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]]. During the few years after its foundation the British Museum received several further gifts, including the [[Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts]] and [[David Garrick]]'s library of 1,000 printed plays, but yet contained few ancient [[relic]]s recognisable to visitors of the modern museum.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

===Indolence and energy (1778-1800)===
From 1778 a display of objects from the [[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]]s brought back from the round-the-world voyages of Captain [[James Cook]] and the travels of other explorers fascinated visitors with a glimpse of previously unknown lands. The bequest of a collection of books, [[engraved gem]]s, coins, prints and drawings by [[Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode]] in 1800 did much to raise the Museum's reputation; but Montagu House became increasingly crowded and decrepit and it was apparent that it would be unable to cope with further expansion.&lt;ref&gt;BMCE1/5, 1175 (13 May 1820). Minutes of General Meeting of the Trustees, 1754-63. (Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History, pg 78)&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum’s first notable addition towards its collection of antiquities, since its foundation, was by Sir [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|William Hamilton]] (1730–1803), British Ambassador to [[Naples]], who sold his collection of Greek and Roman artefacts to the museum in 1784 together with a number of other antiquities and natural history specimens. A list of donations to the Museum, dated 31 January 1784 refers to the Hamilton bequest of a &quot;Colossal Foot of an [[Apollo]] in Marble&quot;. It was one of two antiquities of Hamilton's collection drawn for him by Francesco Progenie, a pupil of Pietro Fabris, who also contributed a number of drawings of Mount Vesuvius sent by Hamilton to the [[Royal Society]] in [[London]].

===Growth and change (1800-25)===
[[File:Rosetta Stone International Congress of Orientalists ILN 1874.jpg|thumb|The [[Rosetta Stone]] on display in the British Museum in 1874]]

In the early 19th century the foundations for the extensive collection of sculpture began to be laid and Greek, Roman and Egyptian artefacts dominated the antiquities displays. After the defeat of the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1799|French Campaign]] in the [[Battle of the Nile]], in 1801, the British Museum acquired more Egyptian sculpture and in 1802 [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] presented the [[Rosetta Stone]] – key to the deciphering of hieroglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;''Wondrous Curiosities - Ancient Egypt at the British Museum'', pg 66-72 (Stephanie Moser, 2006, ISBN 0226542092)&lt;/ref&gt; Gifts and purchases from [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]], British [[Consul General]] in Egypt, beginning with the [[Younger Memnon|Colossal bust of Ramesses II]] in 1818, laid the foundations of the collection of Egyptian Monumental Sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;''The Story of the British Museum'', pg 24 (Marjorie Caygill, 2003, ISBN 0714127728)&lt;/ref&gt; Many Greek sculptures followed, notably the first purpose-built exhibition space, the [[Charles Towneley|Charles Towneley collection]], much of it Roman Sculpture, in 1805. In 1806, [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin]], ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1799 to 1803 removed the large collection of marble sculptures from the [[Parthenon]], on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] in [[Athens]] and transferred them to the UK. In 1816 these masterpieces of western art, were acquired by The British Museum by Act of Parliament and deposited in the museum thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;The British Museum - The Elgin Marbles, pg 85 (B.F.Cook, 2005, ISBN 0714121347&lt;/ref&gt; The collections were supplemented by the [[Bassae]] frieze from [[Phigalia|Phigaleia]], [[Greece]] in 1815. The Ancient Near Eastern collection also had its beginnings in 1825 with the purchase of [[Assyria]]n and [[Babylonia]]n antiquities from the widow of [[Claudius James Rich]].&lt;ref&gt;The British Museum - Assyrian Sculpture, pg 6-7 (Julian Reade, 2004, ISBN 071412141X)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 a Buildings Committee was set up to plan for expansion of the museum, and further highlighted by the donation in 1822 of the [[King's Library]], personal library of King George III's, comprising 65,000 volumes, 19,000 [[pamphlet]]s, maps, charts and [[Topographic map|topographical drawing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/collections/early/georgeiii.html King's Library]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architect, [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]], was asked to draw up plans for an eastern extension to the Museum &quot;...&amp;nbsp;for the reception of the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library]], and a Picture Gallery over it ...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, pg 79&lt;/ref&gt; and put forward plans for today's quadrangular building, much of which can be seen today. The dilapidated Old [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]] was demolished and work on the [[King's Library]] Gallery began in 1823. The extension, the East Wing, was completed by 1831. However, following the founding of the [[National Gallery, London]] in 1824,{{Ref_label|E|e|none}} the proposed Picture Gallery was no longer needed, and the space on the upper floor was given over to the [[Natural history|Natural History]] collections.&lt;ref&gt;The Story of the British Museum, pg 25 (Marjorie Caygill, 2003, ISBN 0714127728)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The largest building site in Europe (1825-50)===
[[File:P8282318.1.JPG|thumb|right|Left to Right: [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], Townley Gallery and [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]]'s west wing under construction (July 1828)]]
[[File:Image-The Grenville Library (1875).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Thomas Grenville|Grenville]] Library, (1875)]]
The Museum became a construction site as [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]]'s grand [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] building gradually arose. The [[King's Library]], on the ground floor of the East Wing, was handed over in 1827, and was described as one of the finest rooms in [[London]] although it was not fully open to the general public until 1857, however, special openings were arranged during [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851. In spite of dirt and disruption the collections grew, outpacing the new building.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

;Archaeological excavations

In 1840 the Museum became involved in its first overseas [[excavation (archeology)|excavation]]s, [[Charles Fellows]]'s expedition to [[Xanthos]], in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], whence came remains of the tombs of the rulers of ancient [[Lycia]], among them the [[Nereid Monument|Nereid]] and [[Tomb of Payava|Payava]] monuments. In 1857 [[Charles Thomas Newton|Charles Newton]] was to discover the 4th-century BC [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum of Halikarnassos]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World|Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. In the 1840s and 1850s the Museum supported excavations in [[Assyria]] by [[Austen Henry Layard|A.H. Layard]] and others at sites such as [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]]. Of particular interest to curators was the eventual discovery of [[Ashurbanipal]]'s great library of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]], which helped to make the Museum a focus for [[Assyriology|Assyrian studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Reade, Julian (2004). Assyrian Sculpture. London: The British Museum Press, pg 16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Grenville|Sir Thomas Grenville]] (1755–1846), a Trustee of The British Museum from 1830, assembled a fine library of 20,240 volumes, which he left to the Museum in his will. The books arrived in January 1847 in twenty-one horse-drawn vans. The only vacant space for this large library was a room originally intended for manuscripts, between the Front Entrance Hall and the Manuscript Saloon. The books remained here until the British Library moved to [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] in 1998.

===Collecting from the wider world (1850-75)===
The opening of the forecourt in 1852 marked the completion of [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]]'s 1823 plan, but already adjustments were having to be made to cope with the unforeseen growth of the collections. Infill galleries were constructed for [[Assyria]]n sculptures and [[Sydney Smirke]]'s [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]], with space for a million books, opened in 1857. Because of continued pressure on space the decision was taken to move natural history to a new building in [[South Kensington]], which would later become the [[Natural History Museum|British Museum of Natural History]].

Roughly contemporary with the construction of the new building was the career of a man sometimes called the &quot;second founder&quot; of the British Museum, the Italian librarian [[Anthony Panizzi]]. Under his supervision, the British Museum Library (now the [[British Library]]) quintupled in size and became a well-organised institution worthy of being called a national library, the largest library in the world after the [[National Library of Paris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;world and its people&quot;/&gt; The [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] at the centre of Smirke's design proved to be a waste of valuable space and was filled at Panizzi's request by a circular Reading Room of cast iron, designed by Smirke's brother, Sydney Smirke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Until the mid-19th century, the Museum's collections were relatively circumscribed but, in 1851, with the appointment to the staff of [[Augustus Wollaston Franks]] to curate the collections, the Museum began for the first time to collect British and European medieval antiquities, [[prehistory]], branching out into Asia and diversifying its holdings of [[ethnography]]. Overseas excavations continued and [[John Turtle Wood]] discovered the remains of the 4th century BC [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus|Ephesos]], another [[Seven Wonders of the World|Wonder of the Ancient World]].&lt;ref&gt;South from Ephesus - An Escape From The Tyranny Of Western Art, pg 33-34,(Brian Sewell, 2002, ISBN 1903933161)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholarship and legacies (1875-1900)===
The natural history collections were an integral part of the British Museum until their removal to the new British Museum of Natural History, now the [[Natural History Museum]], in 1887. With the departure and the completion of the new White Wing (fronting Montague Street) in 1884, more space was available for antiquities and [[ethnography]] and the library could further expand. This was a time of innovation as electric lighting was introduced in the Reading Room and exhibition galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In 1882 the Museum was involved in the establishment of the independent [[Egypt Exploration Fund]] (now Society) the first British body to carry out research in Egypt. A bequest from Miss Emma Turner in 1892 financed excavations in Cyprus. In 1897 the death of the great collector and curator, [[Augustus Wollaston Franks|A.W. Franks]], was followed by an immense bequest of 3,300 [[Ring (finger)|finger rings]], 153 drinking vessels, 512 pieces of continental porcelain, 1,500 [[netsuke]], 850 [[inro]], over 30,000 [[bookplates]] and miscellaneous items of jewellery and plate, among them the [[Oxus Treasure]].&lt;ref&gt;Caygill, Marjorie (2006). The British Museum: 250 Years. London: The British Museum Press, pg 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898 [[Ferdinand James von Rothschild|Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild]] bequeathed the glittering contents from his New Smoking Room at [[Waddesdon Manor]] as the '''Waddesdon Bequest'''. This consisted of almost 300 pieces of ''objets d'art et de vertu'' which included exquisite examples of jewellery, plate, enamel, carvings, glass and [[maiolica]], among them the [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]], probably created in the 1390s in Paris for [[John, Duke of Berry]].  The collection was in the tradition of a [[schatzkammer]] or treasure house such as those formed by the [[Renaissance]] princes of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;rothschild&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title =Creating a Great Museum: Early Collectors and The British Museum|first=Marjorie|last=Caygill|publisher =Fathom.com|url=http://www.fathom.com/course/21701728/session4.html|accessdate = 13 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baron Ferdinand's will was most specific, and failure to observe the terms would make it void, the collection should be
{{quote|placed in a special room to be called the Waddesdon Bequest Room separate and apart from the other contents of the Museum and thenceforth for ever thereafter, keep the same in such room or in some other room to be substituted for it.&lt;ref name=&quot;rothschild&quot;/&gt;}}  These terms are still observed, and the collection occupies room 45.

===New century, new building (1900-25)===
[[File:England; London - The British Museum, Archive King Edward VII's Galleries ~ North Wing (1914).2.jpg|thumb|Opening of The White Wing, [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII's]] Galleries (1914)]]
By the last years of the 19th century, The British Museum's collections had increased so much that the Museum building was no longer big enough for them. In 1895 the trustees purchased the 69 houses surrounding the Museum with the intention of demolishing them and building around the West, North and East sides of the Museum. The first stage was the construction of the northern wing beginning 1906.

All the while, the collections kept growing. Emily Torday collected in Central Africa, [[Marc Aurel Stein|Aurel Stein]] in Central Asia, [[David George Hogarth|D.G. Hogarth]], [[Leonard Woolley]] and [[T. E. Lawrence]] excavated at [[Carchemish]]. In 1918, because of the threat of wartime bombing, some objects were evacuated to a Postal Tube Railway at Holborn, the [[National Library of Wales|National Library of Wales (Aberystwyth)]] and a country house near [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]]. On the return of antiquities from wartime storage in 1919 some objects were found to have deteriorated. A temporary conservation laboratory was set up in May 1920 and became a permanent department in 1931. It is today the oldest in continuous existence.&lt;ref&gt;Permanent establishment of the Research Laboratory (now the oldest such establishment in continuous existence) {{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/visit/datelist.html |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 the British Museum welcomed over one million visitors.

===Disruption and reconstruction (1925-50)===
New [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] floors were constructed and book stacks rebuilt in an attempt to cope with the flood of books. In 1931 the art dealer [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Sir Joseph Duveen]] offered funds to build a gallery for the [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon sculptures]]. Designed by the American architect [[John Russell Pope]], it was completed in 1938. The appearance of the exhibition galleries began to change as dark Victorian reds gave way to modern pastel shades.{{Ref_label|F|f|none}} However, in August 1939, due to the imminence of war and the likelihood of air-raids the Parthenon Sculptures along with Museum's most valued collections were dispersed to secure basements, [[country house]]s, [[Aldwych tube station]], the [[National Library of Wales]] and a quarry. The evacuation was timely, for in 1940 the Duveen Gallery was severely damaged by bombing.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, B.F. (2005). The Elgin Marbles. London: The British Museum Press, pg 92&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum continued to collect from all countries and all centuries: among the most spectacular additions were the 2600 BC [[Mesopotamia]]n treasure from [[Ur]], discovered during [[Leonard Woolley|Leonard Woolley's]] 1922–34 excavations. Gold, silver and [[garnet]] grave goods from the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] ship burial at [[Sutton Hoo]] (1939) and late Roman silver tableware from [[Mildenhall Treasure|Mildenhall]], [[Suffolk]] (1946). The immediate [[post-war]] years were taken up with the return of the collections from protection and the restoration of the museum after the [[The Blitz|blitz]]. Work also began on restoring the damaged Duveen Gallery.

===A new public face (1950-75)===

[[File:TeacherBritishMuseum.jpg|thumb |thumb|A [[teacher]] and young pupils at The British Museum [[Duveen Gallery]]]]

In 1953 the Museum celebrated its [[200 (number)|bicentenary]]. Many changes followed: the first full time in house designer and publications officer were appointed in 1964, A [[The British Museum Friends|Friends]] organization was set up in 1968, an Education Service established in 1970 and publishing house in 1973. In 1963 a new Act of Parliament introduced administrative reforms. It became easier to lend objects, the [[constitution]] of the [[Board of Trustees]] changed and the [[Natural History Museum]] became fully independent. By 1959 the Coins and Medals office suite, completely destroyed during the war, was rebuilt and re-opened, attention turned towards the gallery work with new tastes in design leading to the remodelling of [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke's]] Classical and Near Eastern galleries.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, pg 270&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 the Duveen Gallery was finally restored and the Parthenon Sculptures were moved back into it, once again at the heart of the museum.{{Ref_label|G|g|none}}

By the 1970s the Museum was again expanding. More services for the public were introduced; visitor numbers soared, with the temporary exhibition &quot;Treasures of [[Tutankhamun]]&quot; in 1972, attracting 1,694,117 visitors, the most successful in British history. In the same year the Act of Parliament establishing the British Library was passed, separating the collection of [[manuscripts]] and printed books from the British Museum. This left the Museum with antiquities; coins, medals and paper money; prints &amp; drawings; and [[ethnography]]. A pressing problem was finding space for additions to the library which now required an extra 1 1/4 miles of shelving each year. The Government suggested a site at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] for the new British Library but the books did not leave the museum until 1997.

===The Great Court emerges (1975-2000)===
The departure of the British Library to a new site at St Pancras, finally achieved in 1998, provided the space needed for the books. It also created the opportunity to redevelop the vacant space in [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke's]] 19th-century central quadrangle into the [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court]] – the largest covered square in Europe – which opened in 2000.

The ethnography collections, which had been housed in the short-lived [[Museum of Mankind]] at 6 Burlington Gardens from 1970, were returned to new purpose-built galleries.

The Museum again readjusted its collecting policies as interest in &quot;modern&quot; objects: prints, drawings, medals and the decorative arts reawakened. Ethnographical fieldwork was carried out in places as diverse as [[New Guinea]], [[Madagascar]], [[Romania]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Indonesia]] and there were excavations in the [[Near East]], Egypt, Sudan and the UK. The [[Weston family|Weston]] Gallery of Roman Britain, opened in 1997, displayed a number of recently discovered [[hoard]]s which demonstrated the richness of what had been considered an unimportant part of the Roman Empire. The Museum turned increasingly towards private funds for buildings, acquisitions and other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, pg 327&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Museum today===
Today it no longer houses collections of [[natural history]], and the books and manuscripts it once held now form part of the independent British Library. The Museum nevertheless preserves its universality in its collections of artefacts representing the cultures of the world, ancient and modern. The original 1753 collection has grown to over thirteen million objects at the British Museum, 70 million at the [[Natural History Museum]] and 150 million at the British Library.

The [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]], which was designed by the architect [[Sydney Smirke]], opened in 1857. For almost 150 years researchers came here to consult the Museum's vast library. The Reading Room closed in 1997 when the national library (the British Library) moved to a new building at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]]. Today it has been transformed into the Walter and Leonore [[Annenberg Foundation|Annenberg]] Centre.

With the bookstacks in the central courtyard of the museum empty, the process of demolition for [[Lord Foster]]'s glass-roofed [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court|Great Court]] could begin. The Great Court, opened in 2000, while undoubtedly improving circulation around the museum, was criticised for having a lack of exhibition space at a time when the museum was in serious financial difficulties and many galleries were closed to the public. At the same time the African and Oceanic collections that had been temporarily housed in 6 Burlington Gardens were given a new gallery in the North Wing funded by the [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|Sainsbury]] family - with the donation valued at £25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/africa/room_25_africa.aspx |title=Room 25: Africa |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
{{See also|Director of the British Museum}}

In technical terms, the British Museum is a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] through a three-year funding agreement. Its head is the Director. The British Museum was run from its inception by a 'Principal Librarian' (when the book collections were still part of the Museum), a role that was renamed 'Director and Principal Librarian' in 1898, and 'Director' in 1973 (on the separation of the British Library).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/the_museum/about_us/management_and_governance/directors.aspx |title=Directors |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A board of 25 [[trustee]]s (with the Director as their [[Chief accounting officer|accounting officer]] for the purposes of reporting to Government) is responsible for the general management and control of the Museum, in accordance with the British Museum Act of 1963 and the Museums and Galleries Act of 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/the_museum/about_us/management_and_governance/museum_governance.aspx |title=Museum governance |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 1963 Act, it was chaired by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the [[Lord Chancellor]] and the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. The board was formed on the Museum's inception to [[trust law|hold its collections in trust]] for the nation without actually owning them themselves, and now fulfil a mainly advisory role. Trustee appointments are governed by the regulatory framework set out in the code of practice on public appointments issued by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. For a list of current trustees, see here.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/the_museum/about_us/management_and_governance/trustees.aspx |title=Trustees |publisher=British Museum |date= |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==
[[File:British museum entrance.jpg|thumb|The entrance to the museum]]
The [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] façade facing Great Russell Street is a characteristic building of Sir [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]], with 44 columns in the [[Ionic order]] {{convert|45|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, closely based on those of the temple of [[Athena|Athena Polias]] at [[Priene]] in [[Asia Minor]]. The [[pediment]] over the main entrance is decorated by sculptures by Sir [[Richard Westmacott]] depicting ''The Progress of Civilisation'', consisting of fifteen [[Allegory|allegorical]] figures, installed in 1852.

The construction commenced around the courtyard with the East Wing ([[King's Library|The King's Library]]) in 1823–1828, followed by the North Wing in 1833–1838, which originally housed among other galleries a reading room, now the Wellcome Gallery. Work was also progressing on the northern half of the West Wing (The Egyptian Sculpture Gallery) 1826–1831, with [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]] demolished in 1842 to make room for the final part of the West Wing, completed in 1846, and the South Wing with its great colonnade, initiated in 1843 and completed in 1847, when the Front Hall and Great Staircase were opened to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Building the British Museum, Marjorie Caygill &amp; Christopher Date 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  The Museum is faced with [[Portland stone]], but the perimeter walls and other parts of the building were built using [[Haytor]] granite from Dartmoor in South Devon, transported via the unique [[Haytor Granite Tramway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.es.ucl.ac.uk/department/collections/RockRoom/building.htm |title=Building London |publisher=Es.ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BM; 'MF' RM1 - The King's Library, Enlightenment 1 'Discovering the world in the 18th Century ~ View South.jpg|The [[King's Library]]|thumb|left]]

In 1846 Robert Smirke was replaced as the Museum's architect by his brother [[Sydney Smirke]], whose major addition was the [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]] 1854–1857; at {{convert|140|ft|m|abbr=off}} in diameter it was then the second widest dome in the world, the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]] being slightly wider.

The next major addition was the White Wing 1882–1884 added behind the eastern end of the South Front, the architect being Sir [[John Taylor (architect)|John Taylor]].

In 1895, Parliament gave the Museum Trustees a loan of £200,000 to purchase from the Duke of Bedford all 69 houses which backed onto the Museum building in the five surrounding streets - Great Russell Street, Montague Street, Montague Place, Bedford Square and Bloomsbury Street.&lt;ref&gt;Title deed of the 'perimeter properties' of The British Museum, BM Archives CA TD&lt;/ref&gt; The Trustees planned to demolish these houses and to build around the West, North and East sides of the Museum new galleries that would completely fill the block on which the Museum stands. The architect Sir [[John James Burnet]] was petitioned to put forward ambitious long-term plans to extend the building on all three sides. Most of the houses in Montague Place were knocked down a few years after the sale. Of this grand plan only the Edward VII galleries in the centre of the North Front were ever constructed, these were built 1906-14 to the design by J.J. Burnet, and opened by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] in 1914. They now house the Museum's collections of Prints and Drawings and Oriental Antiquities. There was not enough money to put up more new buildings, and so the houses in the other streets are nearly all still standing.
[[File:BM; Archives - Impression of the proposed extension.jpg|thumb|left|Proposed British Museum Extension, 1906]]

The [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Duveen]] Gallery, sited to the west of the Egyptian, Greek &amp; Assyrian sculpture galleries, was designed to house the Elgin Marbles by the American [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] architect [[John Russell Pope]]. Although completed in 1938, it was hit by a bomb in 1940 and remained semi-derelict for 22 years, before reopening in 1962. Other areas damaged during [[World War II]] bombing included: in September 1940 two unexploded bombs hit the Edward VII galleries, the King's Library received a direct hit from a high explosive bomb, incendiaries fell on the dome of the Round Reading Room but did little damage; on the night of 10 to 11 May 1941 several incendiaries fell on the south west corner of the Museum, destroying the book stack and 150,000 books in the courtyard and the galleries around the top of the Great Staircase – this damage was not fully repaired until the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;pages 65-66, Building the British Museum, Marjorie Caygill &amp; Christopher Date 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:British Museum - Great Court.JPG|thumb|upright|The British Museum, Great Court]]

The [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] Great Court is a covered square at the centre of the British Museum designed by the engineers [[Buro Happold]] and the architects [[Foster and Partners]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman Foster and the British Museum, Norman Foster, Deyan Sudjic &amp; Spencer de Grey 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Court opened in December 2000 and is the largest covered square in Europe. The roof is a glass and steel construction with 1,656 uniquely shaped panes of glass. At the centre of the Great Court is the Reading Room vacated by the British Library, its functions now moved to St Pancras. The Reading Room is open to any member of the public who wishes to read there.

Today, the British Museum has grown to become one of the largest Museums in the world, covering an area of over 75,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of exhibition space, showcasing approximately 50,000 items from its collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taiwanheadlines.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=60974&amp;CtNode=10 |title=British Museum feels privileged to put exhibition in Taiwan |author=Jennifer Huang and Deborah Kuo |date=January 31, 2007 |work=Taiwan Headlines |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan) |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are nearly one hundred galleries open to the public, representing {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=off}} of exhibition space, although the less popular ones have restricted opening times. However, the lack of a large temporary exhibition space has led to the £100 million World Conservation and Exhibition Centre to provide one and to concentrate all the Museum's conservation facilities into one Conservation Centre. This project was announced in July 2007, with the architects [[Richard Rogers|Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners]]. It was granted planning permission in December 2009 and is expected for completion by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan===
[[File:England; London - The British Museum, Egypt Egyptian Sculpture ~ Colossal granite head of Amenhotep III (Room 4).2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The British Museum, Room 4 - [[Colossal red granite statue of Amenhotep III]] (1350 BC)]]

The British Museum houses the world's largest and most comprehensive collection of [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquities]] outside the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]]. A collection of immense importance for its range and quality, it includes objects of all periods from virtually every site of importance in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the [[History of Sudan|Sudan]]. Together they illustrate every aspect of the cultures of the [[Nile|Nile Valley]] (including [[Nubia]]), from the [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic]] [[Neolithic]] period (c. 10,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]]) through to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic (Christian)]] times (12th century [[Anno Domini|AD]]), a time-span over 11,000 years.

[[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquities]] have formed part of the British Museum collection ever since its foundation in 1753 after receiving 160 Egyptian objects&lt;ref&gt;Reported in the list of Sloane's collection given to his executors in 1753. Reproduced in MacGregor (1994a:29)&lt;/ref&gt; from Sir [[Hans Sloane]]. After the defeat of the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1799|French]] forces under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1801, the Egyptian antiquities collected were confiscated by the [[British army]] and presented to the British Museum in 1803. These works, which included the famed [[Rosetta Stone]], were the first important group of large sculptures to be acquired by the Museum. Thereafter, the UK appointed [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]] as [[Consul general|consul]] in [[Egypt]] who amassed a huge collection of antiquities. Most of the antiquities Salt collected were purchased by the British Museum and the [[Musée du Louvre]]. By 1866 the collection consisted of some 10,000 objects. Antiquities from excavations started to come to the Museum in the later 19th century as a result of the work of the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] under the efforts of [[E. A. Wallis Budge|E.A. Wallis Budge]]. The collection stood at 57,000 objects by 1924. Active support by the Museum for excavations in Egypt continued to result in useful acquisitions throughout the 20th century until changes in antiquities laws in Egypt led to the suspension of policies allowing finds to be exported. The size of the Egyptian collections now stands at over 110,000 objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/spencer.htm |title=A British Museum Egyptologist's View: The Return of Egyptian Antiquities is Not an Issue |publisher=Touregypt.net |date= |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn 2001 the eight million objects forming the Museum's permanent collection were further expanded by the addition of six million objects from the Wendorf Collection of [[Predynastic Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[History of Sudan|Sudanese]] [[Prehistory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/aes/aesnot.html |title=Ancient Egypt and Sudan |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were donated by Professor Fred Wendorf of [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Texas]], and comprise the entire collection of artefacts and environmental remains from his excavations between 1963 and 1997. They are in the care of the Department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan.
[[File:SFEC BritMus Egypt 002.JPG|thumb|260px|Perennial favourites; a group of coffins for [[Mummy|mummies]]]]

The seven permanent Egyptian galleries at the British Museum, which include its largest exhibition space (Room 4, for monumental sculpture), can display only 4% of its Egyptian holdings. The second-floor galleries have a selection of the Museum's collection of 140 [[Mummy|mummies]] and coffins, the largest outside [[Egyptian Museum|Cairo]]. A high proportion of the collection comes from [[tombs]] or contexts associated with the cult of the dead, and it is these pieces, in particular the mummies, that remain among the most eagerly sought after exhibits by visitors to the Museum.

Key highlights of the collections include:

*The [[Rosetta Stone]] (196 BC)
*The [[Battlefield Palette]], (circa ~3500 to 3000 BC).
*Limestone statue of a husband and wife (1300 BC)
*Colossal bust of [[Ramesses II]], the &quot;[[Memnon (mythology)|Younger Memnon]]&quot; (1250 BC)

===Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities===

The Department of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Antiquities of the British Museum has one of the world's largest and most comprehensive collections of antiquities from the [[Classical antiquity|Classical world]], with over 100,000 objects. These mostly range in date from the beginning of the [[Bronze Age|Greek Bronze Age]] (about 3200BC) to the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I]] in the 4th century AD, with some [[Paganism|pagan]] survivals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The [[Cyclades|Cycladic]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] cultures are represented, and the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] collection includes important sculpture from the [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens]], as well as elements of two of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], the [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum at Halikarnassos]] and the [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus|Ephesos]].

The Department also houses one of the widest-ranging collections of [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] antiquities and extensive groups of material from [[Ancient history of Cyprus|Cyprus]]. The collections of ancient jewellery and bronzes, [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]] and [[Glass|Roman glass]] and silver are particularly important.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Formerly the Department of the Ancient Near East, the Department recently{{when|date=January 2011}} became the Department of the Middle East when the collections from the Islamic world were moved from the Department of Asia into this department.

With approximately 330,000 objects&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/middle_east/research.aspx British Museum - Research]&lt;/ref&gt; in the collection, the British Museum has the greatest collection of [[Mesopotamia]]n antiquities outside [[Iraq]]. The holdings of [[Assyria]]n, [[Babylonia]]n and [[Sumer]]ian antiquities are among the most comprehensive in the world.

The collections represent the civilisations of the ancient Near East and its adjacent areas. These include [[Mesopotamia]], [[Persian Empire|Persia]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Anatolia]], the [[Caucasus]], parts of [[Central Asia]], [[Syria]], [[Palestine]] and [[Phoenicia]]n settlements in the western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] from the [[Prehistory|prehistoric period]] until the beginning of [[Islam]] in the 7th century. The collection includes six iconic [[Lamassu|winged human-headed statues]] from [[Nimrud]] and [[Khorsabad]]. Stone [[bas-relief]]s, including the famous Royal Lion Hunt relief's (Room 10), that were found in the palaces of the Assyrian kings at [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]]. The [[Library of Ashurbanipal|Royal Library of Ashurbanipal]] at Nineveh and [[Sumer]]ian treasures found in Royal Cemetery's at [[Ur Kasdim|Ur of the Chaldees]].

The earliest [[Mesopotamian]] objects to enter collections purchased by the British Museum in 1772 from [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]. The Museum also acquired at this early date a number of sculptures from [[Persepolis]]. The next significant addition (in 1825) was from the collection of [[Claudius James Rich]]. The collection was dramatically enlarged by the excavations of [[Austen Henry Layard|A. H. Layard]] at the [[Assyria]]n sites of [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]] between 1845–1851.

At Nimrud, Layard discovered the North-West Palace of [[Ashurnasirpal II]], as well as three other palaces and various temples. He also opened in the Palace of [[Sennacherib]] at Nineveh with 'no less than seventy-one halls'. As a result a large numbers of [[Lamassu]]'s, bas-reliefs, [[Stele|stelae]], including the [[Black Obelisk]] of [[Shalmaneser III]] were brought to the British Museum. Layard's work was continued by his assistant, [[Hormuzd Rassam]] and in 1852–1854 he went on to discover the North Palace of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh with many magnificent reliefs, including the famous Royal Lion Hunt scenes. He also discovered the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|Royal Library of Ashurbanipal]], a large collection of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] of enormous importance. [[William Loftus|W. K. Loftus]] excavated in Nimrud between 1850–1855 and found a remarkable hoard of [[Ivory carving|ivories]] in the Burnt Palace. Between 1878–1882 Rassam greatly improved the Museum's holdings with exquisite objects including the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] from [[Babylon]], the bronze gates from [[Balawat]], and a fine collection of [[Urartian]] bronzes. Rassam collected thousands of cuneiform tablets, today with the acquisition of further tablets in the 20th century, the collection now numbers around 130,000 pieces. In the 20th century excavations were carried out at [[Carchemish]], [[Turkey]], between 1911–1914 and in 1920 by [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] and [[Leonard Woolley]], the latter assisted by [[T. E. Lawrence]]. The Mesopotamian collections were greatly augmented by excavations in southern [[Iraq]] after the [[First World War]]. From [[Ubaid period|Tell al-Ubaid]] in 1919 and 1923–1924, directed by [[Henry Hall (Egyptologist)|H. R. Hall]] came the bronze furnishings of a [[Sumer]]ian temple, including life-sized lions and a panel featuring the lion-headed eagle Indugud. Woolley went onto to excavate [[Ur]] between 1922–1934, discovering the 'Royal Cemeteries' of the 3rd millennium BC. Some of the masterpieces include the '[[Standard of Ur]]', the 'Ram in a Thicket', the '[[Royal Game of Ur]]', and two bull-headed [[lyres]].

Although the collections centre on Mesopotamia most of the surrounding areas are well-represented. The [[Achaemenid]] collection was enhanced with the addition of the [[Oxus Treasure]] in 1897, by acquisition from the German scholar [[Ernst Herzfeld]], and then by the work of [[Marc Aurel Stein|Sir Aurel Stein]]. From [[Palmyra]] there is a large collection of nearly forty funerary busts, acquired in the 19th century. A group of stone [[reliefs]] from the excavations of [[Max von Oppenheim]] at [[Tell Halaf]], purchased in 1920. More excavated material from the excavations of [[Max Mallowan]] at [[Chagar Bazar]] and [[Tell Brak]] in 1935–1938, and from Woolley at [[Alalakh]] in the years just before and after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The collection of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] material was strengthened with the acquisition in 1980 of around 17,000 objects found at [[Lachish]] by the Wellcome-Marston expedition of 1932–1938.

A representative selection, including the most important pieces, are on display in 13 galleries and total some 4500 objects. The remainder form the study collection which ranges in size from beads to large sculptures. They include approximately 130,000 [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] from Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/middle_east/history_of_the_collection.aspx |title=History of the Collection: Middle East |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum's collection of Islamic art, including archaeological material, numbers about 40,000 objects,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/pm_partner.php?id=Mus01;uk&amp;type=museum&amp;theme=ISL&amp; |title=MWNF - Museum With No Frontiers |publisher=Discoverislamicart.org |date= |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the largest of its kind in the world. As such, it contains a broad range of Islamic pottery, paintings, tiles, metalwork, glass, seals, and inscriptions.

[[File:Michelangelo Epifania.jpg|thumb|upright|The British Museum, Room 90 - [[Epifania (Michelangelo drawing)|Michelangelo's Epifania]] - his only surviving large scale [[cartoon]].]]
The Department of [[Old master print|Prints]] and [[Drawing]]s holds the national collection of [[Western art history|Western]] Prints and Drawings. It ranks as one of the largest and best [[print room]] collections in existence alongside the [[Albertina, Vienna|Albertina]] in [[Vienna]], the Paris collections and the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]]. The holdings are easily accessible to the general public in the Study Room, unlike many such collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/prints_and_drawings/facilities_and_services/study_room.aspx |title=Study room page |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Department also has its own exhibition gallery in Room 90, where the displays and exhibitions change several times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/prints_and_drawings/galleries.aspx |title=Prints and Drawings galleries |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its foundation in 1808 the Prints and Drawings collection has grown to international renown as one of the richest and most representative collections in the world. There are approximately 50,000 drawings and over two million prints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/prints_and_drawings.aspx |title=Prints and Drawings |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of drawings covers the period from the 14th century to the present, and includes many works of the highest quality by the leading artists of the [[Western art history|European schools]]. The collection of prints covers the tradition of fine [[printmaking]] from its beginnings in the 15th century up to the present, with near complete holdings of most of the great names before the 19th century.

There are magnificent groups of drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], (including [[Epifania (Michelangelo drawing)|his only surviving full-scale cartoon)]], [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]] (a collection of 138 drawings is one of the finest in existence), [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]] and [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], and largely complete collections of the works of all the great printmakers including [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]] (99 [[engraving]]s, 6 [[etching]]s and most of his 346 [[woodcut]]s), Rembrandt and [[Francisco Goya|Goya]]. More than 30,000 British drawings and [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] include important examples of work by [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]], [[Paul Sandby|Sandby]], [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]], [[Thomas Girtin|Girtin]], [[John Constable|Constable]], [[John Sell Cotman|Cotman]], [[David Cox (artist)|Cox]], [[James Gillray|Gillray]], [[Thomas Rowlandson|Rowlandson]] and [[George Cruikshank|Cruikshank]], as well as all the great [[Victorian era|Victorians]]. There are about a million British prints including more than 20,000 [[satire]]s and outstanding collections of works by [[William Blake]] and [[Thomas Bewick]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

[[File:Wellcome Trust Gallery + Living &amp; Dying (Room 24).jpg|thumb| The British Museum, Room 24 - The [[Wellcome Trust]] Gallery with [[Hoa Hakananai'a]] in the centre]]

The Sainsbury African Galleries display 600 objects from the greatest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the Museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life.

Highlights of the African collection include the [[Benin Bronzes]], a magnificent brass head of a Yoruba ruler from Ife, Nigeria; Asante goldwork from Ghana and the Torday collection of Central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry.

The Americas collection mainly consists of 19th and 20th century items although the [[Inca]], [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and other early cultures are well represented; collecting of modern artefacts is ongoing.

===Department of Coins and Medals===
The British Museum is home to one of the world's finest [[Numismatics|numismatic]] collections, comprising about a million objects. The collection spans the entire history of coinage from its origins in the 7th century BC to the present day. There are approximately 9,000 coins, medals and banknotes on display around the British Museum. More than half of these can be found in the HSBC Money Gallery (Gallery 68), while the remainder form part of the permanent displays throughout the Museum. Items from the full collection can be seen by the general public in the Study Room by appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/coins_and_medals/facilities_and_services/study_room.aspx |title=Coins and Medals Study Room |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Department of Conservation and Scientific Research===
This department was founded in 1920. Conservation has six specialist areas: ceramics &amp; glass; metals; organic material (including textiles); stone, wall paintings and mosaics; Eastern pictorial art and Western pictorial art. The science department&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/science/index.html Thebritishmuseum.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; has and continues to develop techniques to date artefacts, analyse and identify the materials used in their manufacture, to identify the place an artefact originated and the techniques used in their creation. The department also publishes its findings and discoveries.

===Libraries and Archives===
This department covers all levels of education, from casual visitors, schools, degree level and beyond. The Museum's various libraries hold in excess of 350,000 books, journals and pamphlets covering all areas of the museum's collection. Also the general Museum archives which date from its foundation in 1753 are overseen by this department; the individual departments have their own separate archives covering their various areas of responsibility.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Controversy==
[[File:Elgin Marbles east pediment.jpg|thumb|right|A few of the [[Elgin Marbles]] (also known as the [[Parthenon Marbles]]) from the East [[Pediment]] of the [[Parthenon]].]]

It is a point of controversy whether museums should be allowed to possess artefacts taken from other countries, and the British Museum is a notable target for criticism. The [[Elgin Marbles]], [[Benin Bronzes]] and the [[Rosetta Stone]] are among the most disputed objects in its collections, and organisations have been formed demanding the return of these artefacts to their native countries of [[Greece]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Egypt]] respectively.

The British Museum has refused to return these artefacts, stating that the &quot;restitutionist premise, that whatever was made in a country must return to an original geographical site, would empty both the British Museum and the other great museums of the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/gr/andart.html |title=Greek and Roman Antiquities |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum has also argued that the British Museum Act of 1963 legally prevents any object from leaving its collection once it has entered it. Nevertheless, it has returned items such as the [[Tasmanian Ashes]] after a 20 year long battle with Australia.&lt;ref name = &quot;ktixsj&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|author=CBC Arts |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/03/26/aboriginal-ashes.html |title=Arts - British Museum returns aboriginal ashes to Tasmania |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=26 March 2006 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Museum continues to assert that it is an appropriate custodian and has an inalienable right to its disputed artefacts under [[British law]].

==Notes==
&lt;div class=&quot;references-small&quot;&gt;

'''a.''' {{Note_label|A|a|none}} Sculptures and applied art are in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the British Museum houses earlier art, non-Western art, prints and drawings, and art of a later date is at [[Tate Modern]]. The National Gallery, holds the National Collection of Western European Art, with [[Tate Britain]] deposited with British Art from 1500.

'''b.''' {{Note_label|B|b|none}} By the Act of Parliament it received a name - the British Museum. The origin of the name is not known; the word 'British' had some resonance nationally at this period, so soon after the Jacobite rebellion of 1745; it must be assumed that the Museum was christened in this light.&lt;ref&gt;The question of the use of the term 'British' at this period has recently received some attention, e.g. Colley (1992), 85ff. There never has been a serious attempt to change the Museum's name.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''c.''' {{Note_label|C|c|none}} The estimated footage of the various libraries as reported to the Trustees has been summarised by Harris (1998), 3,6: Sloane 4,600, Harley 1,700, Cotton 384, Edwards 576, The Royal Library 1,890.

'''d.''' {{Note_label|D|d|none}} This was perhaps rather unfortunate as the title to the house was complicated by the fact that part of the building had been erected on leasehold property (the Crown lease of which ran out in 1771); perhaps that is why [[George III]] paid such a modest price (nominally £28,000) for what was to become Buckingham Palace. See Colvin ''et'' al. (1976), 134.

'''e.''' {{Note_label|E|e|none}} Understanding of the foundation of the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] is complicated by the fact that there is no documented history of the institution. At first the National Gallery functioned effectively as part of the British Museum, to which the [[Trustees]] transferred most of their most important pictures (ex. portraits). Full control was handed over to the National Gallery in 1868, after the [[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1840-1859|Act of Parliament of 1856]] established the Gallery as an independent body.

'''f.''' {{Note_label|F|f|none}} Ashmole, the Keeper of the Greek and Roman Antiquities appreciated the original top-lighting of these galleries and removed the Victorian colour scheme, commenting:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The old Elgin Gallery was painted a deep terracotta red, which, though in some ways satisfactory, diminished its apparent size, and was apt to produce a depressing effect on the visitor. It was decided to experiment with lighter colours, and the walls of the large room were painted with what was, at its first application, a pure cold white, but which after a year's exposure had unfortunately yellowed. The small Elgin Room was painted with pure white tinted with prussian blue, and the Room of the metopes was painted with pure white tinted with cobalt blue and black; it was necessary, for practical reasons, to colour all the dadoes a darker colour&lt;ref&gt;Quoted Ashmole (1994), 125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''g.''' {{Note_label|G|g|none}} Ashmole had never liked the Duveen Gallery:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is, I suppose, not positively bad, but it could have been infinitely better. It is pretentious, in that it uses the ancient Marbles to decorate itself. This is a long outmoded idea, and the exact opposite of what a sculpture gallery should do. And, although it incorporates them, it is out of scale, and tends to dwarf them with its bogus Doric features, including those columns, supporting almost nothing which would have made an ancient Greek artist architect wince. The source of daylight is too high above the sculptures, a fault that is only concealed by the amount of reflection from the pinkish marble walls. These are too similar in colour to the marbles...These half-dozen elementary errors were pointed out by everyone in the Museum, and by many scholars outside, when the building was projected.&lt;ref&gt;Ashmole (1994), 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was not until the 1980s that the installation, of a lighting scheme removed his greatest criticism of the building.

'''h.''' {{Note_label|H|h|none}} The Cairo Museum has 150,000 artefacts, with leading collections reposited at the Musee du Louvre (60,000), Petrie Museum (80,000), The Metropolitan Museum of art (36,000), University of Pennsylvania (42,000), Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (40,000), Museo Egizio, Turin (32,500 objects).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Pascal's triangle 5.svg|right|thumb|200px|The [[binomial coefficients]] appear as the entries of [[Pascal's triangle]].]]
In [[elementary algebra]], the '''binomial theorem''' describes the algebraic expansion of [[exponentiation|powers]] of a [[binomial]]. According to the theorem, it is possible to expand the power (''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; into a [[sum]] involving terms of the form ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;, where the exponents ''b'' and ''c'' are [[nonnegative integer]]s with {{nowrap|''b'' + ''c'' {{=}} ''n''}}, and the [[coefficient]] ''a'' of each term is a specific [[positive integer]] depending on ''n'' and ''b''. When an exponent is zero, the corresponding power is usually omitted from the term. For example,

:&lt;math&gt;(x+y)^4 \;=\; x^4 \,+\, 4 x^3y \,+\, 6 x^2 y^2 \,+\, 4 x y^3 \,+\, y^4.&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficient ''a'' in the term of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt; is known as the [[binomial coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nb&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nc&lt;/math&gt; (the two have the same value). These coefficients for varying ''n'' and ''b'' can be arranged to form [[Pascal's triangle]]. These numbers also arise in [[combinatorics]], where &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nb&lt;/math&gt; gives the number of different [[combinations]] of ''b'' [[element (mathematics)|elements]] that can be chosen from an ''n''-element [[set (mathematics)|set]].

==History==
This formula and the triangular arrangement of the binomial coefficients are often attributed to [[Blaise Pascal]], who described them in the 17th century, but they were known to many mathematicians who preceded him. The 4th century B.C. [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Euclid]] mentioned the special case of the binomial theorem for exponent&amp;nbsp;2&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BinomialTheorem.html Binomial Theorem]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/2305028 The Story of the Binomial Theorem, by J. L. Coolidge], ''The American Mathematical Monthly'' '''56''':3 (1949), pp. 147–157&lt;/ref&gt; as did the 3rd century B.C. [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematician]] [[Pingala]] to higher orders.  A more general binomial theorem and the so-called &quot;[[Pascal's triangle]]&quot; were known in the 10th-century A.D. to Indian mathematician [[Halayudha]] and [[Islamic mathematics|Persian mathematician]] [[Al-Karaji]],&lt;ref name=Karaji&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Karaji|title=Abu Bekr ibn Muhammad ibn al-Husayn Al-Karaji}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 13th century to [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese mathematician]] [[Yang Hui]], who all derived similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Karaji also provided a [[mathematical proof]] of both the binomial theorem and Pascal's triangle, using [[mathematical induction]].&lt;ref name=Karaji/&gt;

==Statement of the theorem==
According to the theorem, it is possible to expand any power of ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'' into a sum of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
(x+y)^n = {n \choose 0}x^n y^0 + {n \choose 1}x^{n-1}y^1 + {n \choose 2}x^{n-2}y^2 + \cdots + {n \choose n-1}x^1 y^{n-1} + {n \choose n}x^0 y^n, \quad(1)
&lt;/math&gt;

where each &lt;math&gt; \tbinom nk &lt;/math&gt; is a specific positive integer known as [[binomial coefficient]]. This formula is also referred to as the '''Binomial Formula''' or the '''Binomial Identity'''. Using [[Capital-sigma notation|summation notation]], it can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}x^{n-k}y^k. =  \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}x^{k}y^{n-k}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The final expression follows from the previous one by the symmetry of ''x'' and ''y'' in the first expression, and by comparison it follows that the sequence of binomial coefficients in the formula is symmetrical.

A variant of the binomial formula is obtained by [[substitution (algebra)|substituting]] 1 for ''x'' and ''x'' for ''y'', so that it involves only a single [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]].  In this form, the formula reads

:&lt;math&gt;(1+x)^n = {n \choose 0}x^0 + {n \choose 1}x^1 + {n \choose 2}x^2 +  \cdots + {n \choose {n-1}}x^{n-1} + {n \choose n}x^n,&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

:&lt;math&gt;(1+x)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}x^k.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
[[Image:Pascal triangle small.png|thumb|right|300px|Pascal's triangle]]
The most basic example of the binomial theorem is the formula for the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'':

:&lt;math&gt;(x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2.\!&lt;/math&gt;

The binomial coefficients 1, 2, 1 appearing in this expansion correspond to the third row of Pascal's triangle.  The coefficients of higher powers of ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'' correspond to later rows of the triangle:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(x+y)^3 &amp; = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3, \\[8pt]
(x+y)^4 &amp; = x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4, \\[8pt]
(x+y)^5 &amp; = x^5 + 5x^4y + 10x^3y^2 + 10x^2y^3 + 5xy^4 + y^5, \\[8pt]
(x+y)^6 &amp; = x^6 + 6x^5y + 15x^4y^2 + 20x^3y^3 + 15x^2y^4 + 6xy^5 + y^6, \\[8pt]
(x+y)^7 &amp; = x^7 + 7x^6y + 21x^5y^2 + 35x^4y^3 + 35x^3y^4 + 21x^2y^5 + 7xy^6 + y^7.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that 
#the powers of x go down until it reaches 0 (none of x),starting value is n (the n in &lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n.)
&lt;/math&gt;
#the powers of y go up from 0 (none of y)until it reaches n (also the n in &lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n.)
&lt;/math&gt;
#the nth row of the Pascal's Triangle will be the coefficients of the expanded binomial.(Note that the top is row 0.)

The binomial theorem can be applied to the powers of any binomial.  For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(x+2)^3 &amp;= x^3 + 3x^2(2) + 3x(2)^2 + 2^3 \\
&amp;= x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For a binomial involving subtraction, the theorem can be applied as long as the [[additive inverse|opposite]] of the second term is used.  This has the effect of changing the sign of every other term in the expansion:
:&lt;math&gt;(x-y)^3 = x^3 - 3x^2y + 3xy^2 - y^3.\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Geometrical explanation===
[[Image:BinomialTheorem.png|right|315px]]
For positive values of ''a'' and ''b'', the binomial theorem with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 is the geometrically evident fact that a square of side {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b''}} can be cut into a square of side ''a'', a square of side ''b'', and two rectangles with sides ''a'' and ''b''. With ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, the theorem states that a cube of side {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b''}} can be cut into a cube of side ''a'', a cube of side ''b'', three ''a''&amp;times;''a''&amp;times;''b'' rectangular boxes, and three ''a''&amp;times;''b''&amp;times;''b'' rectangular boxes.

In [[calculus]], this picture also gives a geometric proof of the [[derivative]] &lt;math&gt;(x^n)'=nx^{n-1}:&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;barth2004&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Barth|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; if one sets &lt;math&gt;a=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=\Delta x,&lt;/math&gt; interpreting ''b'' as an infinitesimal change in ''a,'' then this picture shows the infinitesimal change in the volume of an ''n''-dimensional [[hypercube]], &lt;math&gt;(x+\Delta x)^n,&lt;/math&gt; where the coefficient of the linear term (in &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;) is &lt;math&gt;nx^{n-1},&lt;/math&gt; the area of the ''n'' faces, each of dimension &lt;math&gt;(n-1):&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(x+\Delta x)^n = x^n + nx^{n-1}\Delta x + \tbinom{n}{2}x^{n-2}(\Delta x)^2 + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;
Substituting this into the [[definition of the derivative]] via a [[difference quotient]] and taking limits means that the higher order terms – &lt;math&gt;(\Delta x)^2&lt;/math&gt; and higher – become negligible, and yields the formula &lt;math&gt;(x^n)'=nx^{n-1},&lt;/math&gt; interpreted as
:&quot;the infinitesimal change in volume of an ''n''-cube as side length varies is the area of ''n'' of its &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional faces&quot;.
If one integrates this picture, which corresponds to applying the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], one obtains [[Cavalieri's quadrature formula]], the integral &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int x^{n-1}\,dx = \tfrac{1}{n} x^n}&lt;/math&gt; – see [[Cavalieri's quadrature formula#Proof|proof of Cavalieri's quadrature formula]] for details.&lt;ref name=&quot;barth2004&quot; /&gt;

==The binomial coefficients==
{{main|Binomial coefficient}}
The coefficients that appear in the binomial expansion are called '''binomial coefficients'''.  These are usually written &lt;math&gt; \tbinom nk &lt;/math&gt;, and pronounced “''n'' choose ''k''”.

===Formulas===
The coefficient of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!\,(n-k)!}&lt;/math&gt;,

which is defined in terms of the [[factorial]] function ''n''!.  Equivalently, this formula can be written

:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k} = \frac{n (n-1) \cdots (n-k+1)}{k (k-1) \cdots 1} = \prod_{\ell=1}^k \frac{n-\ell+1}{\ell}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''k'' factors in both the numerator and denominator of the [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]].  Note that, although this formula involves a fraction, the binomial coefficient &lt;math&gt; \tbinom nk &lt;/math&gt; is actually an [[integer]].

===Combinatorial interpretation===
The binomial coefficient &lt;math&gt; \tbinom nk &lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as the number of ways to choose ''k'' elements from an ''n''-element set.  This is related to binomials for the following reason: if we write (''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as a [[Product (mathematics)|product]]
:&lt;math&gt;(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)\cdots(x+y),&lt;/math&gt;
then, according to the [[distributive law]], there will be one term in the expansion for each choice of either ''x'' or ''y'' from each of the binomials of the product.  For example, there will only be one term ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to choosing '''x'' from each binomial.  However, there will be several terms of the form ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, one for each way of choosing exactly two binomials to contribute a ''y''.  Therefore, after [[combining like terms]], the coefficient of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; will be equal to the number of ways to choose exactly 2 elements from an ''n''-element set.

==Proofs==
===Combinatorial proof===
====Example====
The coefficient of ''xy''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(x+y)^3 &amp;= (x+y)(x+y)(x+y) \\
&amp;= xxx + xxy + xyx + \underline{xyy} + yxx + \underline{yxy} + \underline{yyx} + yyy \\
&amp;= x^3 + 3x^2y + \underline{3xy^2} + y^3.
\end{align} \, &lt;/math&gt;

equals &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{3}{2}=3&lt;/math&gt; because there are three ''x'',''y'' strings of length 3 with exactly two ''y'''s, namely,

:&lt;math&gt;xyy, \; yxy, \; yyx,&lt;/math&gt;

corresponding to the three 2-element subsets of {&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;}, namely,

:&lt;math&gt;\{2,3\},\;\{1,3\},\;\{1,2\}, &lt;/math&gt;

where each subset specifies the positions of the ''y'' in a corresponding string.

====General case====
Expanding (''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; yields the sum of the 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; products of the form ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; where each ''e''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is ''x'' or&amp;nbsp;''y''.  Rearranging factors shows that each product equals ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; for some ''k'' between 0 and&amp;nbsp;''n''. For a given ''k'', the following are proved equal in succession:
*the number of copies of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; in the expansion
*the number of ''n''-character ''x'',''y'' strings having ''y'' in exactly ''k'' positions
*the number of ''k''-element subsets of {&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''}
*&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k}&lt;/math&gt; (this is either by definition, or by a short combinatorial argument if one is defining &lt;math&gt;{n \choose k}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{k!\,(n-k)!}&lt;/math&gt;).
This proves the binomial theorem.

===Inductive proof===
[[mathematical induction|Induction]] yields another proof of the binomial theorem&amp;nbsp;(1).  When ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, both sides equal 1, since ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 for all ''x'' and &lt;math&gt;\binom{0}{0}=1&lt;/math&gt;.
Now suppose that (1) holds for a given ''n''; we will prove it for ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.
For ''j'',&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0, let [''ƒ''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')]&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the coefficient of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; in the polynomial ''ƒ''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'').
By the inductive hypothesis, (''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a polynomial in ''x'' and ''y'' such that [(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt; if ''j''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n'', and 0 otherwise.
The identity

:&lt;math&gt; (x+y)^{n+1} = x(x+y)^n + y(x+y)^n, \, &lt;/math&gt;

shows that (''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; also is a polynomial in ''x'' and ''y'', and

:&lt;math&gt; [(x+y)^{n+1}]_{jk} = [(x+y)^n]_{j-1,k} + [(x+y)^n]_{j,k-1}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

If ''j''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, then (''j''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n'' and ''j''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n'', so the right hand side is

:&lt;math&gt; \binom{n}{k} + \binom{n}{k-1} = \binom{n+1}{k},&lt;/math&gt;

by [[Pascal's identity]].  On the other hand, if ''j''&amp;nbsp;+''k''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, then (''j''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''n'' and ''j''&amp;nbsp;+(''k''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''n'', so we get 0&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  Thus

:&lt;math&gt;(x+y)^{n+1} = \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} \binom{n+1}{k} x^{n+1-k} y^k,&lt;/math&gt;

which is the inductive hypothesis with ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 substituted for ''n'' and so completes the inductive step.

==Generalizations==
===Newton's generalized binomial theorem===
{{main|Binomial series}}
Around 1665, [[Isaac Newton]] generalized the formula to allow real exponents other than nonnegative integers, and in fact it can be generalized further, to complex exponents. In this generalization, the finite sum is replaced by an [[infinite series]]. In order to do this one needs to give meaning to binomial coefficients with an arbitrary upper index, which cannot be done using the above formula with factorials; however factoring out (''n''−''k'')! from numerator and denominator in that formula, and replacing ''n'' by ''r'' which now stands for an arbitrary number, one can define

:&lt;math&gt;{r \choose k}=\frac{r\,(r-1) \cdots (r-k+1)}{k!} =\frac{(r)_k}{k!},&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--
This is not the same as  \frac{r!}{k!\,(r−k)!}. Factorials are typically only defined on natural number arguments, but even if you are using factorials generalized (e.g. by the \Gamma function) to non-integer values, they are still undefined on the negative integers. To get the usual binomial theorem as a special case of this so-called generalization, we had better define the binomial coefficient when ''r'' is an integer, but in that case ''r''−''k'' will be a negative integer for sufficiently large ''k'', so one cannot use any formula involving the factorial &lt;math&gt;(r−k)!&lt;/math&gt;.

This negative comment about &quot;not the same as…&quot; seems to be needed.  People keep coming along and completing this formula with this expression involving factorials, missing the point of this section.
--&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;(\cdot)_k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Pochhammer symbol]] here standing for a [[falling factorial]].  Then, if ''x'' and ''y'' are real numbers with |''x''|&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;|''y''|,&lt;ref name=convergence&gt;This is to guarantee convergence.  Depending on ''r'', the series may also converge sometimes when |''x''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|''y''|.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''r'' is any [[complex number]], one has

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(x+y)^r &amp; =\sum_{k=0}^\infty {r \choose k} x^{r-k} y^k \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad(2) \\
&amp; = x^r + r x^{r-1} y + \frac{r(r-1)}{2!} x^{r-2} y^2 + \frac{r(r-1)(r-2)}{3!} x^{r-3} y^3 + \cdots.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
When ''r'' is a nonnegative integer, the binomial coefficients for ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''r'' are zero, so (2) specializes to (1), and there are at most ''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 nonzero terms.  For other values of ''r'', the series (2) has infinitely many nonzero terms, at least if ''x'' and ''y'' are nonzero.

This is important when one is working with infinite series and would like to represent them in terms of [[generalized hypergeometric function]]s.

Taking ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''s'' leads to a useful but non-obvious formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(1-x)^s} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty {s+k-1 \choose k} x^k \equiv \sum_{k=0}^\infty {s+k-1 \choose s-1} x^k.&lt;/math&gt;

Further specializing to ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 yields the [[Geometric series#Formula|geometric series formula]].

====Generalizations====
Formula (2) can be generalized to the case where ''x'' and ''y'' are [[complex numbers]].  For this version, one should assume |''x''|&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;|''y''|&lt;ref name=convergence/&gt; and define the powers of ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'' and ''x'' using a [[holomorphic]] [[complex logarithm|branch of log]] defined on an open disk of radius |''x''| centered at ''x''.

Formula (2) is valid also for elements ''x'' and ''y'' of a [[Banach algebra]] as long as ''xy''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''yx'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;is invertible, and&amp;nbsp;||''y/x''||&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.

===The multinomial theorem===
{{main|Multinomial theorem}}
The binomial theorem can be generalized to include powers of sums with more than two terms.  The general version is

:&lt;math&gt;(x_1 + x_2  + \cdots + x_m)^n
 = \sum_{k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m} {n \choose k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m}
  x_1^{k_1} x_2^{k_2} \cdots x_m^{k_m}. &lt;/math&gt;

where the summation is taken over all sequences of nonnegative integer indices ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; such that the sum of all ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is&amp;nbsp;''n''. (For each term in the expansion, the exponents must add up to&amp;nbsp;''n'').  The coefficients &lt;math&gt; \tbinom n{k_1,\cdots,k_n} &lt;/math&gt; are known as multinomial coefficients, and can be computed by the formula

:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m}
 = \frac{n!}{k_1!\, k_2! \cdots k_m!}.&lt;/math&gt;

Combinatorially, the multinomial coefficient &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n{k_1,\cdots,k_n}&lt;/math&gt; counts the number of different ways to [[Partition of a set|partition]] an ''n''-element set into [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] [[subset]]s of sizes ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Applications==
===Multiple angle identities===
For the [[complex numbers]] the binomial theorem can be combined with [[De Moivre's formula]] to yield [[List of trigonometric identities#Multiple-angle formulae|multiple-angle formulas]] for the [[sine]] and [[cosine]].  According to De Moivre's formula,
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\left(nx\right)+i\sin\left(nx\right) = \left(\cos x+i\sin x\right)^n.\,&lt;/math&gt;
Using the binomial theorem, the expression on the right can be expanded, and then the real and imaginary parts can be taken to yield formulas for cos(''nx'') and sin(''nx'').  For example, since
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\cos x+i\sin x\right)^2 = \cos^2 x + 2i \cos x \sin x - \sin^2 x,&lt;/math&gt;
De Moivre's formula tells us that
:&lt;math&gt;\cos(2x) = \cos^2 x - \sin^2 x \quad\text{and}\quad\sin(2x) = 2 \cos x \sin x,&lt;/math&gt;
which are the usual double-angle identities.  Similarly, since
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\cos x+i\sin x\right)^3 = \cos^3 x + 3i \cos^2 x \sin x - 3 \cos x \sin^2 x - i \sin^3 x,&lt;/math&gt;
De Moivre's formula yields
:&lt;math&gt;\cos(3x) = \cos^3 x - 3 \cos x \sin^2 x \quad\text{and}\quad \sin(3x) = 3\cos^2 x \sin x - \sin^3 x.&lt;/math&gt;
In general,
:&lt;math&gt;\cos(nx) = \sum_{k\text{ even}} (-1)^{k/2} {n \choose k}\cos^{n-k} x \sin^k x&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(nx) = \sum_{k\text{ odd}} (-1)^{(k-1)/2} {n \choose k}\cos^{n-k} x \sin^k x.&lt;/math&gt;

===Series for e===
The [[e (mathematical constant)|number ''e'']] is often defined by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;e = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the binomial theorem to this expression yields the usual [[infinite series]] for ''e''.  In particular:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n = 1 + {n \choose 1}\frac{1}{n} + {n \choose 2}\frac{1}{n^2} + {n \choose 3}\frac{1}{n^3} + \cdots + {n \choose n}\frac{1}{n^n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The ''k''th term of this sum is

:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k}\frac{1}{n^k} \;=\; \frac{1}{k!}\cdot\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}{n^k}&lt;/math&gt;

As ''n''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞, the rational expression on the right approaches one, and therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} {n \choose k}\frac{1}{n^k} = \frac{1}{k!}.&lt;/math&gt;

This indicates that ''e'' can be written as a series:

:&lt;math&gt;e = \frac{1}{0!} + \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} + \frac{1}{3!} + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

Indeed, since each term of the binomial expansion is an [[Monotonic function|increasing function]] of ''n'', it follows from the [[monotone convergence theorem]] for series that the sum of this infinite series is equal to&amp;nbsp;''e''.

==The binomial theorem in abstract algebra==

Formula (1) is valid more generally for any elements ''x'' and ''y'' of a [[semiring]] satisfying ''xy''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''yx''.  The [[theorem]] is true even more generally:  [[alternativity]] suffices in place of [[associativity]].

The binomial theorem can be stated by saying that the [[polynomial sequence]] {&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''x'',&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;} is of [[binomial type]].

'''Boxing Day''' is a [[bank holiday|bank]] or [[public holiday]] that occurs on 26 December, or the first or second weekday after [[Christmas Day]], depending on national or regional laws. It is observed in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]] and some other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]]. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], it is recognized as [[St Stephen's Day]] or the Day of the Wren ({{Lang-ga|Lá an Dreoilín}}). In [[South Africa]], Boxing Day was renamed Day of Goodwill in 1994. Historically, it was celebrated as The Second Day of Christmas (''2. Weihnachtsfeiertag'') in former [[GDR|East Germany]]. 

Although the same legislation – the [[Bank Holidays Act 1871]] – originally established the bank holidays throughout the UK, the day after Christmas was defined as Boxing Day in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], and the feast day of [[St. Stephen's Day|St Stephen]] in Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Directgov&quot;/&gt; A 'substitute bank holiday in place of 26 December' is only possible in [[Northern Ireland]], reflecting the legal difference in that St. Stephen's Day does not automatically shift to the Monday in the same way as Boxing Day.

In [[Canada]], Boxing Day is listed in the [[Canada Labour Code]] as an optional holiday. Only the province of [[Ontario]] has made it a statutory holiday where all workers receive time off with pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutoryholidays.com/ |title=Statutory holidays in Canada both national and provincial |publisher=Statutoryholidays.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The exact etymology of the term &quot;boxing&quot; is unclear and there are several competing theories, none of which is definitive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/boxingday.asp Boxing Day]. [[Snopes.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition has long included giving money and other gifts to those who were needy and in service positions. The European tradition has been dated to the Middle Ages, but the exact origin is unknown and there are some claims that it goes back to the late Roman/early Christian era; metal boxes placed outside churches were used to collect special offerings tied to the Feast of Saint Stephen.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 2003, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, it is a custom for tradesmen to collect &quot;Christmas boxes&quot; of money or presents on the first weekday after Christmas as thanks for good service throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica, 1953 &quot;Boxing day&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This is mentioned in Samuel Pepys' diary entry for 19 December 1663;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1663/12/19/ |title=Saturday 19 December 1663 (Pepys' Diary) |publisher=Pepysdiary.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This custom is linked to an older English tradition: in exchange for ensuring that wealthy landowners' Christmases ran smoothly, their servants were allowed to take the 26th off to visit their families. The employers gave each servant a box containing gifts and bonuses (and sometimes leftover food).

==Date==
Boxing Day is a secular holiday that is traditionally celebrated on 26 December, the day after [[Christmas Day]], which is also [[St. Stephen's Day]], a religious holiday.&lt;ref&gt;''American Heritage Dictionary'', Fourth Edition - 'Boxing Day'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/11_november/17/radio4_sun26.shtml |title=BBC Radio 4 schedule, 03 December 2004 |date = 17 November 2004 |accessdate = 17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when 26 December falls on a Sunday, Boxing Day in many places is moved to 27 December. In the UK, where Boxing Day is a [[bank holiday]], if Boxing Day falls on a Saturday, a substitute bank holiday is given on the following Monday, but if Boxing Day falls on a Sunday &amp;ndash; which means that Christmas Day, another bank holiday, fell on a Saturday &amp;ndash; then the [[Statutory Holiday]] for Christmas is moved to Monday 27 December and the Statutory Holiday for Boxing Day is moved to Tuesday 28 December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Directgov&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Bank Holidays and British Summertime |author = Directgov |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/LivingintheUK/DG_073741 |date= |accessdate = 17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In Scotland, Boxing Day has been specified as an additional bank holiday since 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/46377/pages/9343 |title=London Gazette, 18 October 1974 |publisher=London-gazette.co.uk |date=1974-10-18 |accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Royal Proclamation]] under the [[Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/bank-holidays/FAQs Scottish Government website - bank holidays]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ireland]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; when it was part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the [[Bank Holidays Act 1871]] established the feast day of St Stephen as a non-movable public holiday on 26 December. Since the [[Irish War of Independence]], the name &quot;Boxing Day&quot; is used only by the authorities in Northern Ireland, which remains part of the UK. There, Boxing Day is a movable public holiday in line with the rest of the UK.

In the Australian state of [[South Australia]], 26 December is a public holiday known as [[Proclamation Day]] and Boxing Day is not normally a public holiday.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.safework.sa.gov.au/show_page.jsp?id=2483&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Canadian]] provinces, Boxing Day is a statutory holiday&lt;ref name=&quot;Manitoba&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.mb.ca/labour/standards/doc,gen-holidays-after-april-30-07,factsheet.html#q13 |title = Fact Sheet |author = Manitoba Employment Standards Branch |date = 27 November 2009 |accessdate = 17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is always celebrated on 26 December. In Canadian provinces where Boxing Day is a statutory holiday, and it falls on a Saturday or Sunday, compensation days are given in the following week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manitoba&quot;/&gt;

==Shopping==

It is a time where shops have sales, often with dramatic price decreases. For many merchants, Boxing Day has become the day of the year with the greatest revenue. In the UK in 2009 it was estimated that up to 12 million shoppers appeared at the sales (a rise of almost 20% compared to 2008, although this was also affected by the fact that the [[VAT]] would revert to 17.5% from 1 January).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8432144.stm |title=Boxing Day sales attract 'record' number of shoppers |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-12-28 |accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[retailer]]s open very early (typically 5&amp;nbsp;am or even earlier) and offer [[doorbuster]] deals and [[loss leader]]s to draw people to their stores. It is not uncommon for long queues to form early in the morning of 26 December, hours before the opening of shops holding the big sales, especially at [[Big-box store|big-box]] [[consumer electronics]] retailers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctv.ca&quot;/&gt; Many stores have a limited quantity of big draw or deeply discounted items.&lt;ref name=&quot;toronto.ctv.ca&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20071213/boxing_day_071213?hub=EdmontonHome |title = How to become a Boxing Day shopping pro |date = 25 December 2007 |author = Ashleigh Patterson |accessdate = 17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, many choose to stay home and avoid the hectic shopping experience. The local media often cover the event, mentioning how early the shoppers began queueing up, providing video of shoppers queueing and later leaving with their purchased items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20071226/Boxing_Day_071226/20071226?hub=Canada |title=Boxing Day begins with early rush of bargain hunters |author = toronto.ctv.ca |date = 26 December 2007 |accessdate = 17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boxing Day sales have the potential for customer stampedes, injuries and even fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/11/28/2008-11-28_worker_dies_at_long_island_walmart_after.html |title = Worker dies at Long Island Wal-Mart after being trampled in Black Friday stampede |authors= Joe Gould, Clare Trapasso and Rich Schapiro |date = 28 November 2008 |accessdate= 17 December 2009 | location=New York | work=Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many retailers have implemented practices aimed at controlling large numbers of shoppers, most whom are typically irate due to the cold (or, in Australia and New Zealand, hot) weather, and anxious for bargains. They may limit entrances, restrict the number of patrons in a store at a time, provide tickets to people at the head of the queue to guarantee them a hot ticket item, and canvass queued-up shoppers to inform them of inventory limitations.&lt;ref name=&quot;toronto.ctv.ca&quot;/&gt;

In recent years, retailers have expanded deals to &quot;[[Boxing Week]].&quot; While Boxing Day is 26 December, many retailers who hold ''Boxing Day Sales'' will run the sales for several days before or after 26 December, often up to [[New Year's Eve]]. Notably, in [[Late 2000s recession|the recession of late 2008]], a record number of retailers were holding early promotions due to a weak economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20081221/Shopping_Deals_081222/20081221?hub=TopStories |title = Boxing Day comes early as shoppers search for deals |author = CTV.ca News Staff |date = 21 December 2008 |accessdate = 17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's Boxing Day has often been compared with the American [[Super Saturday]], the Saturday before Christmas. In 2009, a number of major Canadian retailers had their own Black Friday promotions to discourage shoppers from crossing the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2009/11/27/consumer-black-friday.html |author = CBC News |title=Canadian retailers try their own Black Friday |date = 27 November 2009 |accessdate = 17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas of Canada, particularly in [[Atlantic Canada]] and parts of [[Northern Ontario]] (including [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city.sault-ste-marie.on.ca/newsitem.aspx?ID=641 |title=Advisory - Boxing Day |author=www.city.sault-ste-marie.on.ca |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;), most retailers are prohibited from opening on Boxing Day, either by provincial law or municipal [[bylaw]]. In these areas, sales otherwise scheduled for 26 December are moved to the 27th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soonews.ca/viewarticle.php?id=15342 |title=Boxing Day, The Debate Continues |author=soonews.ca |date=2007-12-22 |accessdate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5hAtdtyDSIeYttaUmCcZLT_bGhGzg |title=Boxing Day madness: shoppers descend on stores looking for deals |author=The Canadian Press |date=2009-12-26 |accessdate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland, since 1902, most stores remain closed on St. Stephen's Day, as with Christmas Day. In 2009, some stores decided to open on this day, breaking a 107-year-old tradition. Some stores have also started their [[January sales]] on this day.

===Cyber Boxing Day===
The online version of Boxing Day has been referred to as &quot;Cyber Boxing Day&quot;. In the UK in 2008, Boxing Day was the busiest online shopping day of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imrg.org/8025741F0065E9B8/%28httpPressReleases%29/2947A86A04A12E2180257694003BB487?OpenDocument |title = Many retailers’ sales to start on Christmas Eve. |date = 22 December 2009 |author = IMRG |accessdate = 22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, many retailers with both online and [[High Street]] stores launched their online sales on [[Christmas Eve]] and their High Street sales on Boxing Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/6858609/Boxing-Day-sales-start-on-Christmas-Eve.html |title = Boxing Day sales start on Christmas Eve. |date = 22 December 2009 |author = Telegraph |accessdate = 22 December 2009 | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
[[File:Keswick Boxing Day hunt 1962.jpg|thumb|287px|Traditional Boxing day hunt meet in Keswick (England) 1962]]

The association of Boxing Day with sport in early village celebrations has led to the [[folk etymology]] that Boxing Day traditionally is associated with [[boxing]], although the word ''box'' can mean a gift or gratuity, especially one given at Christmas, especially in Britain. In African Commonwealth nations, particularly, Ghana, Uganda, Malawi, Zambia, and Tanzania, prize fighting contests are held on Boxing Day.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news|title=Season's Beatings: 'Boxing Day' Takes a Pugilistic Turn|first=Joel|last=Millman|work=Wall Street Journal|date=December 26, 2009|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has also been followed for decades in [[Guyana]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland it is traditional for the [[Premier League]], [[Scottish Premier League]] and [[Irish Premier League]] respectively, as well as the lower divisions and [[Rugby Football]] leagues, to hold a full programme of [[association football|football]] and Rugby matches on Boxing Day. Traditionally, matches on Boxing Day are played against local rivals. This was originally to avoid teams and their fans having to travel a long distance to an away game on the day after Christmas Day. It also makes the day an important one in the sporting calendar.

In horse racing, there is the [[King George VI Chase]] at [[Kempton Park Racecourse]] in [[Surrey]]. It is the second most prestigious [[National Hunt racing|chase]] in England, after the [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]]. 

Boxing Day is a popular day in the UK and US for mounted fox hunters. Despite fox hunting being banned by the [[Hunting Act 2004|Hunting Act]] in 2004, Boxing Day remains the biggest hunt of the year for most hunts in the UK by use of scent drag trails instead of live game.

Australia holds the first day of the [[Boxing Day Test]] in Melbourne at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] and the start to the [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]].

The [[IIHF World U20 Championship]] (ice hockey) typically begins on 26 December. In Canada, the tournament is one of the largest sporting events of the year, often drawing comparisons to the [[Super Bowl]] in the US.

The [[NHL]] tends to have close to a full slate of games (11 were played in 2010), following the league-wide days off given for [[Christmas Eve]] and [[Christmas Day]].

The [[Spengler Cup]] (ice hockey) also begins on 26 December in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]], and includes [[HC Davos]], [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]], and other top European Hockey teams.

'''Balochistan''' ([[Balochi language|Balochi]], {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|بلوچستان}}}}, [[Brahui language|Brahui]]: ''Balocistán'') is the largest province (by area) of [[Pakistan]], constituting approximately 44% of the total land mass of Pakistan. According to the 1998 census, Balochistan had a population of roughly 6.6 million.&lt;ref name=census1998&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/fbs/publications/yearbook2008/Population/16-5.pdf|title=Population, Area and Density by Region/Province|year=1998|publisher=Federal Bureau of Statistics, Government of Pakistan|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Its neighbouring regions are [[Iran]] to the west; [[Afghanistan]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] to the north; and [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]] to the east. To the south lies the [[Arabian Sea]]. The main languages in the province are [[Balochi language|Balochi]], [[Brahui language|Brahui]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]].&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/50834/Balochistan|title=Balochistān|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2009|accessdate=December 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provincial capital is [[Quetta]] and [[Gwadar]] is the developing port city .&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; Balochistan is rich in mineral resources; it is the second major supplier of natural gas in Pakistan.

==Geography and climate==
Balochistan is located at the south-eastern edge of the [[Iranian plateau]]. It strategically bridges the [[Middle East]] and [[Southwest Asia]] to [[Central Asia]] and [[South Asia]], and forms the closest oceanic frontage for the land-locked countries of Central Asia.
[[File:Astola Island.jpg|thumb|left|Astola Island]]
In terms of geographical size, Balochistan is the largest of the five provinces of Pakistan at [[1 E+11 m²|347,190]] [[Square kilometre|km²]] (134,051&amp;nbsp;mi²), which composes approximately 44% of the total land area of Pakistan. The [[population density]] is very low due to the mountainous terrain and scarcity of water. The southern region is known as [[Makran]]. The central region is known as [[Kalat District|Kalat]].

The [[Sulaiman Mountains]] dominate the northeast corner and the [[Bolan Pass]] is a natural route into Afghanistan towards [[Kandahar]], used as a passageway during the British campaigns to Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Bolan Pass - Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the province south of the Quetta region is sparse desert terrain with pockets of towns mostly near rivers and streams.
[[File:Hanna Lake, Quetta.JPG|thumb|left|[[Hanna Lake]] on 29 January 2004]]
The capital, Quetta, is located in the most densely populated district in the northeast of the province. It is situated in a river valley near the border with Afghanistan, with a road to Kandahar in the northwest.

Very cold winters and hot summers characterise the climate of the upper highlands. Winters of the lower highlands vary from extremely cold in [[Ziarat]], [[Quetta]], [[Kalat, Pakistan|Kalat]], Muslim Baagh and Khanozai the northern districts to mild conditions closer to the Makran coast. Summers are hot and dry, especially the arid zones of Chaghai and Kharan districts. The plain areas are also very hot in summer with temperatures rising as high as {{convert|50|C|F}}.The highest record breaking temperature of {{convert|53|C|F}} has been recorded in [[Sibi]] on 26 May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pakmet.com.pk/latest%20news/Latest%20News.html&lt;/ref&gt; Previously {{convert|52|C|F}} has been recorded in sibi. Other hot areas includes, [[Turbat]], and [[Dalbandin]]. Winters are mild on the plains with the temperature never falling below the freezing point. The desert climate is characterised by hot and very arid conditions. Occasionally strong windstorms make these areas very inhospitable.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Baloch people|}}

==Society and culture==

Balochistani culture is primarily tribal, deeply patriarchal and conservative. Baloch society is dominated by tribal chieftains called [[Mir (title)|Mir]]s, [[Sardar]]s and [[Nawab]]s, who are the ruling elite of Balochistan and have been criticized for blocking the educational development and empowerment of the Baloch people {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}{{Weasel-inline|date=May 2009}} lest the status quo be challenged.

[[Honor killing]]s are commonplace&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4678530.ece |title=Three teenagers buried alive in 'honour killings'|accessdate=2008-09-05|work=Times Online| location= London |date=2008-09-05| first=Zahid|last=Hussain}}&lt;/ref&gt; but still discouraged by the majority of the population{{Citation needed | date = July 2009}}. In one recent incident in August 2008, the [[Asian Human Rights Commission]] reported that five women (including three teenagers) in a remote village had been beaten, shot and buried alive in a ditch for the crime of seeking to choose their own husbands. One of the tribesmen involved was the younger brother of a provincial minister from the ruling Pakistan People's Party, and local police therefore refused to take any action.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahrc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrchk.net/ua/mainfile.php/2008/2969 | title = Pakistan: Five women buried alive, allegedly by the brother of a minister|accessdate=2008-08-11|work=Asian Human Rights Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After human rights activists brought the case to national and international attention, [[Israr Ullah Zehri]] of the [[Balochistan National Party]], who represents Balochistan in the Pakistani Parliament, defended the killings and asked his fellow legislators not to make a fuss about the incident. He told Parliament, &quot;These are centuries-old traditions, and I will continue to defend them.  Only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid.&quot; But many Baloch literate oppose these practices. According to majority of Baloch, the person or tribe head should be brought to the court and must be punished. Many Baloch or Balochis have denied the fact that ''Karo Kari'' is part of Balochi culture. They claim it was a nomadic cultural practice which was stopped many years ago, but because of poor administration by the Pakistani government and to demilitarize the Baloch, such acts are now taking place.&lt;ref name = &quot;telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/2660881/Pakistani-women-buried-alive-for-choosing-husbands.html|title=Pakistani women buried alive 'for choosing husbands'|accessdate=2008-09-01| work=Telegraph| location=London| date= 2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Balochistan was the site of the earliest known farming settlements in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], the earliest of which was [[Mehrgarh]] dated at 6500 BCE. Balochistan in [[Pashto]] is known as '''Godar'' which was hellenized to [[Gedrosia]] due to the fact that the Greeks derived the names of these [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] lands from the [[Bactrian]] language. The Balochi people referred to their own land as ''Moka'' or ''Maka'', a word which later became ''Makran''. The word ''Balochistan'' is derived from the [[Persian language]] and was originally termed to mean &quot;ignorant&quot;. However, with the spread of the [[Persian language]], the name ''Balochistan'' seems to have stuck. Balochistan was seemingly always sparsely populated by various tribes of [[Iranic]] origin for centuries following the decline of the nearby [[Harappa]]-[[Mohenjo-daro]] civilization to the east. The spread of the [[Balochi]] language led to the eventual decline in the numbers of [[Brahui]] the original [[Arachosian]] tribes of the region.
[[File:Picbaloochi.jpg|thumb|230px|A Baloch [[shepherd]], from a 1900 photo]]
The [[Baloch people|Baloch]] began to arrive from their original homeland in the northwest [[Zagros Mountains]], in [[Syria]], [[Anatolia]] and [[Iran]], claiming to be an offshoot of the [[Medes]] and the [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] who would mainly populate the western end of the [[Iranian plateau]]. Under influence of [[Islam]], many Baloch—like their neighbors the [[Pashtuns]]—believed that their origins were [[Semitic]] and not [[Indo-European]] [[Iran]]ic. This stands contrary to linguistic and historical evidence. The Baloch claim that they left their original homeland in far northwestern [[Zagros Mountains]] around [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]] at some point in the 1st millennium CE and moved to Balochistan.&lt;ref&gt;M. Longworth Dames, Balochi Folklore, ''Folklore'', Vol. 13, No. 3 (Sep. 29, 1902), pp. 252-274&lt;/ref&gt; They are considered to be an [[Iran]]ic group that has absorbed some [[Semitic]] genes and cultural traits. The great [[Persian language|Persian]] epic of [[Shahnama]] does record the Baloch in the [[Qazvin]]-[[Zanjan]] region of [[Persia]] in the 6th century AD, when they were engaged in battle by the Persian king [[Chosroes I]] [[Anoshervan]], apparently at the exact time when the Baloch were making their long distance trek from their old homeland in northwestern [[Iranian Plateau]] to the current one, in southeastern parts of the region known today as [[Balochistan]]. The immigrating Baloch tribes eventually absorbed all the local people in [[Makran]], southern [[Sistan]] and the [[Barahui]] country, becaming a sizeable group to rival in size the other [[Iran]]ic group in the region, the [[Pashtuns]]. 

The large district and tribe of Belijan/Beluchan still exist in northwest Zagros, stetching from just east of [[Sivas]], south toward  [[Aleppo]]. The current inhabitants and the tribe identify themselves as [[Kurds]]—the cultural and linguistic cousins of the modern Baloch.

In the 7th century, the region was divided into two parts: the south was made part of the [[Kermān Province]] of the [[Persian Empire]] and the north became part of the Persian province [[Sistan]]. In early 644, the [[Islamic]] [[Caliph]], [[Umar]], sent Suhail ibn Adi from [[Busra]] to conquer the Kerman region of Iran. He was then made governor of that region. From Kerman, he conquered the western [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] region, near the Persian frontiers.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Aseer, Vol. 3, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; South-western Balochistan was conquered during the campaign in Sistan the same year.

During the reign of [[Caliph Uthman]] in 652, Balochistan was reconquered during the counter-revolt in [[Kerman]], under the command of Majasha Ibn Masood. This was first time western Balochistan became directly controlled by the [[Caliphate]] and paid taxes on agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Futuh al-Buldan]], p. 384 incomplete citation, needs edition statement to identify the page&lt;/ref&gt; In those days western Balochistan was included in the dominion of Kerman. In 654, Abdulrehman ibn Samrah, governor of Sistan, sent an Islamic army to crush a revolt in [[Zaranj]], which is now in southern [[Afghanistan]]. After conquering Zaranj, a column of the army pushed north, conquering [[Kabul]] and [[Ghazni]], in the [[Hindu Kush]] mountain range, while another column moved through [[Quetta District|North-western]] Balochistan and conquered the area up to the ancient city of ''Dawar'' and ''Qandabil'' ([[Bolan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tabqat ibn Saad, Vol. 8, p. 471&lt;/ref&gt; By 654, the whole of what is now the Balochistan [[province]] of [[Pakistan]] was controlled by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], except for the well-defended mountain town of ''QaiQan'' which is now [[Kalat, Pakistan|Kalat]]. However, this town was later conquered during the reign of Caliph [[Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Futuh al-Buldan]], p. 386 incomplete citation, needs edition statement to identify the page&lt;/ref&gt; Abdulrehman ibn Samrah made Zaranj his provincial capital and remained governor of these conquered areas from 654 to 656, until Uthman was murdered.

During the [[Caliphate]] of [[Ali]], a region of Balochistan, [[Makran]], again revolted. Due to [[civil war]] in the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Islamic empire]], Ali was unable to deal with these areas until 660, when he sent a large force, under the command of Haris ibn Marah Abdi, towards Makran and Sind. Haris ibn Marah Abdi arrived in Makran and conquered it by force, and then moved northward to [[Quetta District|north-eastern]] Balochistan and reconquered ''Qandabil'' ([[Bolan]]). Finally, he moved south and conquered Kalat after a fierce battle.&lt;ref&gt;Rashidun Caliphate and Hind, by Qazi Azher Mubarek Puri, published by Takhliqat , [[Lahore]] [[Pakistan]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 663, during the reign of [[Umayyad]] [[Caliph]] [[Muawiyah I]], [[Muslims]] lost control of [[Quetta District|North-eastern]] Balochistan and [[Kalat]] when Haris ibn Marah and large part of his army died in battle against a revolt in [[Kalat]].&lt;ref&gt;Tarikh al Khulfa, Vol. 1, pp. 214-215, 229&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim forces later regained control of the area during [[Umayyad]] reign. It also remained a part of the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliphate]].

In the 15th century, [[Mir Chakar Khan Rind]] became the first king of Balochistan. Subsequently, Balochistan was dominated by the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], who controlled all of Persia and Afghanistan. The [[Mughal Empire]] also controlled some parts of the area. When Nadir Shah won the allegiance of the rulers of Balochistan, he ceded [[Kalhora]], one of the [[Sindh]] territories of [[Sibi]]-Kachi to the Khan of Kalat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/letters-to-the-editor/baloch-national-identity-in-karachi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v3f6/v3f6a030.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://panhwar.org/Article26.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The successor of Nadir Shah and founder of the Afghan Empire, [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], also won the allegiance of that area's rulers. Most of the area would eventually revert to local Baloch control, however, parts of the northern regions would continue to be dominated by Pashtun tribes.
[[File:Quetta4m.jpg|thumb|left|Quetta cantonment, 1889.]]
During the period of the [[British Raj]], there were four [[Princely State]]s in Balochistan: [[Makran (princely state)|Makran]], [[Kharan (princely state)|Kharan]], [[Las Bela (princely state)|Las Bela]] and [[Kalat (princely state)|Kalat]]. In 1876, Sir [[Robert Sandeman]] made a treaty with the Khan of Kalat and brought his territories (including [[Kharan]], [[Makran]], and [[Las Bela]]) under [[British Raj|British]] suzerainty. After the [[Second Afghan War]] was ended by the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] in May 1879, the [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan|Afghan Emir]] ceded the districts of [[Quetta District|Quetta]], [[Pishin District|Pishin]], [[Sibi District|Sibi]], [[Harnai District|Harnai]], and [[Thal Chotiali]] to the British. In 1883, the British took control of the [[Bolan Pass]], southeast of Quetta, from the [[Khan of Kalat]]. In 1887, some of the areas of Balochistan were declared British territory. In 1893, Sir [[Mortimer Durand]] negotiated an agreement with the [[Amir]] of Afghanistan, [[Abdur Rahman Khan]], to fix the [[Durand Line]] running from [[Chitral]] to Balochistan as the boundary between the [[Emirate of Afghanistan]] and the [[British Raj|British]].

Two devastating earthquakes occurred in Balochistan during the British colonial rule: The [[1935 Balochistan Earthquake]], which devastated [[Quetta]], and the [[1945 Balochistan Earthquake]], which, with its epicentre in the [[Makran]] region, was felt in other regions of [[South Asia]].

After independence from the British, Balochistan, like much of Pakistan, has experienced development. However, due to its sparse population, it has developed at a much slower rate than other parts of Pakistan. This has led to the [[Balochistan conflict|conflict in Balochistan]].

==Government==
{{Main|Government of Balochistan, Pakistan|Districts of Pakistan}}
In common with the other provinces of Pakistan, Balochistan has a parliamentary form of government. The ceremonial head of the province is the [[Governor of Balochistan (Pakistan)|Governor]], who is appointed by the [[President of Pakistan]] on the advice of the provincial [[Chief Minister of Balochistan|Chief Minister]]. The chief executive of the province is the Chief Minister who is normally the leader of the largest party or alliance in the provincial assembly. The [[unicameral]] [[Provincial Assembly of Balochistan]] comprises 65 seats of which 4% are reserved for non-Muslims and 16% for women only. The judicial branch of government is carried out by the [[Balochistan High Court]], based in Quetta, and headed by a Chief Justice. For administrative purposes, the province is subdivided into 30 districts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.balochistan.gov.pk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=49| title=Districts| publisher=Government of Balochistan| accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Makran1.jpg|thumb|[[Makran Coastal Highway]]]]
Balochistan's share of the national economy has historically ranged between 3.7% to 4.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spdc.org.pk/pubs/nps/nps5.pdf|title=Provincial Accounts of Pakistan: Methodology and Estimates 1973-2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1972, Balochistan's economy has grown in size by 2.7 times.&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PAKISTANEXTN/Resources/293051-1241610364594/6097548-1257441952102/balochistaneconomicreportvol2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The economy of the province is largely based upon the production of natural gas, coal and minerals. Outside [[Quetta]], the infrastructure of the province is gradually developing but still lags far behind other parts of Pakistan. Tourism remains limited but has increased due to the exotic appeal of the province. Limited farming in the east as well as fishing along the [[Arabian Sea]] coastline are other forms of income and sustenance for the local populations. Due to the tribal lifestyle of many Baloch and Brahui, animal husbandry is important, as are trading bazaars found throughout the province.
[[File:Gwadar Beach.jpg|thumb|left|Fishing boats in Gwadar East Bay with the Koh-e-Mehdi Hills in the background]]
Though the province remains largely underdeveloped, there are currently several major development projects in progress in Balochistan, including the construction of a new deep sea port at the strategically important town of [[Gwadar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pakboi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakboi.gov.pk/News_Event/Gawadar.html|title=Gawader|accessdate=2006-11-19|work=Pakistan Board of Investment |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061002105003/http://www.pakboi.gov.pk/News_Event/Gawadar.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The port is projected to be the hub of an energy and trade corridor to and from China and the Central Asian republics.

Further west is the [[Mirani Dam]]&lt;ref name=&quot;mirani&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nespak.com.pk/services/viewpic.asp?sector=2&amp;id=4|title=[[Mirani Dam]] Project|accessdate=2006-11-19|work=National Engineering Services Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt; multipurpose project, on the [[Dasht River]], {{convert|50|km}} west of [[Turbat]] in the [[Makran Division]]. It will provide dependable irrigation supplies for the development of agriculture and add more than 35,000&amp;nbsp;km² of arable land. There is also Chinese involvement in the nearby [[Saindak]] gold and copper mining project.

One of the world's largest copper deposits (and its matrix-associated residual gold) have been found at [[Reko Diq]] in the [[Chagai District]] of Balochistan. Reko Diq is a giant mining project in [[Chaghi]]. The main license (EL5) is held jointly by the Government of Balochistan (25%), Antofagasta Minerals (37.5%) and Barrick Gold (37.5%). The deposits at Reko Diq are hoped to be even bigger than those of [[Sarcheshmeh]] in Iran and [[Escondida]] in Chile (presently, the second and the third largest proven deposits of copper in the world).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

BHP Billiton, the world's largest copper mining company, began the project in cooperation with the Australian firm Tethyan, entering into a joint venture with the Balochistan government. The potential annual copper production has been estimated to be 900,000 to 2.2 million tons.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The deposits seem to be largely of [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] rock nature.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Education==
{{Further|[[List of schools in Pakistan#Balochistan|List of schools in Balochistan]]}}

Balochistan's notable institutions of higher learning include: [[Balochistan University of Engineering and Technology]] ([[Khuzdar]]), [[Balochistan University of Information Technology Engineering and Management Sciences]] ([[Quetta]]), [[Bolan Medical College]] (Quetta), [[Iqra University]] (Quetta), [[Sardar Bahadur Khan Women University]] (Quetta), [[Tameer-e-Nau Public College, Quetta]], and [[University of Balochistan]] (Quetta).

Balochistan has the lowest [[List of Pakistani Districts by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]] of all the provinces of Pakistan at 0.556.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spdc.org.pk/pubs/rr/rr73.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Balochistan's rural areas have one of the lowest literacy rates in Pakistan; around 90% of rural females in Balochistan are illiterate. Almost all the districts of Balochistan have a literacy rate below 50% and some are below 35%. The districts with the lowest literacy rate are [[Musakhel District|Musakhel]] (14%), [[Nasirabad District|Nasirabad]] (15%), [[Kohlu District|Kohlu]] (17%), [[Jhal Magsi District|Jhal Magsi]] (17%), [[Kharan District|Kharan]] (19%), [[Awaran District|Awaran]] (20%), [[Bolan District|Bolan]] (21%), [[Killa Saifullah District|Killa Saifullah]] (24%) and [[Jafarabad District|Jafarabad]] (25%).&lt;ref name=lit/&gt;

However, Balochistan's overall literacy has improved significantly over the past 30 years, as shown in the table below.

'''William Magear&lt;!--NOT &quot;MARCY&quot;--&gt; Tweed''' (April 3, 1823 – April 12, 1878) &amp;ndash; sometimes erroneously referred to as '''William Marcy Tweed''' (see [[#Middle name|below]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/610865/William-Magear-Tweed|title=William Magear Tweed (American politician) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=2009-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and widely known as '''&quot;Boss&quot; Tweed''' &amp;ndash; was an American [[politician]] most notable for being the &quot;boss&quot; of [[Tammany Hall]], the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] [[political machine]] that played a major role in the [[politics]] of 19th century [[New York City]] and [[New York|State]]. At the height of his influence, Tweed was the third-largest landowner in [[New York City]], a director of the [[Erie Railway]], the [[Tenth National Bank]], and the New-York Printing Company, as well as proprietor of the [[Metropolitan Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Tweed was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1852, and the New York County Board of Supervisors in 1858, the year he became the &quot;Grand [[Sachem]]&quot; of Tammany Hall.  He was also elected to the [[New York State Senate]] in 1867, but Tweed's greatest influence came from being an appointed member of a number of boards and commissions, his control over political patronage in New York City through Tammany, and his ability to ensure the loyalty of voters through jobs he could create and dispense on city-related projects.

Tweed was convicted for stealing an amount estimated by an aldermen's  committee in 1877 at between $25 million and $45 million from [[New York City]] taxpayers through [[political corruption]], although later estimates ranged as high as $200 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;gotham&quot;&gt;[http://www.gothamgazette.com/article//20050704/202/1467 &quot;Boss Tweed&quot;], ''Gotham Gazette'', New York, 4 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Based on the inflation or devaluation rate of the dollar since 1870 of 2.7%, $25-$200 million is between $1 and $8 billion 2010 dollars&lt;/ref&gt; He died in the [[Ludlow Street Jail]].

==Early life==
Tweed was born April 3, 1823 at 1 Cherry Street,&lt;ref name=encnyc&gt;Share, Allen J. &quot;Tweed, William M(agear) 'Boss'&quot; in {{cite enc-nyc}}, p.1205-1206&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]]. Son of a third-generation [[Ulster-Scots|Scottish-Irish]] chair-maker, Tweed grew up on Cherry Street.  At the age of 11, he left school to learn his father's trade, and then became an apprentice to a saddler.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt; He also studied to be a [[bookkeeping|bookkeeper]] and worked as a brushmaker for a company he had invested in, before eventually joining in the family business in 1852.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt; In 1844, he married Mary Jane C. Skaden, and lived with her family on Madison Street for two years.

[[File:Americus Engine Co No 6 Soiree crop.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Ticket to a 1859 &quot;soiree&quot; to benefit Tweed's Americus Engine Co.]]

Tweed became a member of the [[Odd Fellows]] and the [[Freemasonry|Masons]], and joined a volunteer fire company, Engine No. 12.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt; In 1848, at the invitation of state assemblyman John J. Reilly, he and some friends organized the Americus Fire Company No. 6, also known as the &quot;Big Six&quot;, as a [[volunteer fireman|volunteer fire company]], which took as its symbol a snarling red [[Bengal tiger]], a symbol which remained associated with Tweed and Tammany Hall for many years.&lt;ref name= encnyc /&gt;  At the time, volunteer fire companies competed vigorously with each other; some were connected with street gangs and had strong ethnic ties to various immigrant communities.  The competition could be so fierce that buildings would sometimes burn down while the fire companies fought each other.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, pp.654, 724, 823&lt;/ref&gt; Tweed became known for his ax-wielding violence, and was soon elected the Big Six foreman. Pressure from Alfred Carlson, the chief engineer, got him thrown out of the crew, but fire companies were also recruiting grounds for political parties at the time, and Tweed's exploits came to the attention of the Democratic politicians who ran the Seventh Ward, who put him up for Alderman in 1850, when Tweed was 26.  He lost that election to the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate, but ran again the next year and won, garnering his first political position.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.823&lt;/ref&gt;

Tweed was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1852, but his two year term was undistinguished.&lt;ref name=gotham837&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.837&lt;/ref&gt;  In an attempt by Republican reformers in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], the state capital, to control the Democratic-dominated New York City government, the power of the New York County Board of Supervisors was beefed up.  The board had 12 members, six appointed by the mayor and six elected, and in 1858 Tweed was appointed to the board, which became his first vehicle for large-scale [[Graft (politics)|graft]]; Tweed and other supervisors forced vendors to pay a 15% overcharge to their &quot;ring&quot; in order to do business with the city.&lt;ref name=gotham837 /&gt;  By 1853, Tweed was running the seventh ward for Tammany.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt;

Although he was not trained as a lawyer, Tweed's friend George Barnard certified him as an attorney, and Tweed opened a law office on Duane Street.  He ran for [[sheriff]] in 1861 and was defeated, but became the chairman of the Democratic General Committee shortly after the election, and was then chosen to be the head of Tammany's general committee in January 1863.  Several months later, in April, he became &quot;Grand Sachem&quot;, and began to be referred to as &quot;Boss&quot;, especially after he tightened his hold on power by creating a small executive committee to run the club.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt; Tweed then took steps to increase his income: he used his law firm to extort money, which was then disguised as legal services; he had himself appointed deputy street commissioner &amp;ndash; a position with considerable access to city contractors and funding; he bought the New-York Printing Company, which became the city's official printer, and the city's stationery supplier, the Manufacturing Stationers' Company, and had both companies begin to overcharge for their goods and services.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt; He also started to form what became known as the &quot;Tweed Ring&quot;, by having his friends appointed to office: George Barnard became recorder; [[Peter B. Sweeny]] the [[district attorney]]; and Richard Connolly the county clerk.&lt;ref name=gotham837 /&gt;

[[File:Boss Tweed, Thomas Nast.jpg|thumb|right|225px||[[Thomas Nast]] depicts Tweed in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'']]

With his new position and wealth came a change in style: Tweed began to favor wearing a large diamond in his shirtfront &amp;ndash; a habit that [[Thomas Nast]] used to great effect in his attacks on Tweed in [[Harper's Weekly]] beginning in 1869 &amp;ndash; and he bought a brownstone to live in at 41 West 36th Street, then a very fashionable area.  He invested his now considerable illegal income in real estate, so that by the late 1860s he ranked among the biggest landowners in New York City.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt;

Tweed was elected to the [[New York State Senate]] in 1867, where he helped financiers [[Jay Gould]] and [[Big Jim Fisk]] take control of the [[Erie Railroad]] from [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] by arranging for legislation that legitimized fake Erie stock certificates that Gould and Fisk had issued. In return, Tweed received a large block of stock and was made a director of the company.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt;

==Corruption==
After the election of 1869, Tweed took control of the New York City government.  His protégé, [[John Hoffman]], the former mayor of the city, won election as governor, and Tweed garnered the support of good government reformers like [[Peter Cooper]] and the [[Union League Club]], by proposing a new city charter which returned power to City Hall at the expense of the Republican-inspired state commissions.  The new charter passed, thanks in part to $600,000 in bribes Tweed paid to Republicans, and was signed into law by Hoffman in 1870.  Mandated new elections allowed Tammany to take over the city's Common Council when they won all fifteen aldermanic contests.&lt;ref name=gotham927&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, pp.927-928&lt;/ref&gt;

The new charter put control of the city's finances in the hands of a Board of Supervisors, which consisted of Tweed, who was the commissioner of public works, and mayor [[A. Oakley Hall]] and comptroller Richard B Connolly, both Tammany men.  Hall also appointed other Tweed associates to high offices &amp;ndash; such as [[Peter B. Sweeny]], who took over the Department of Public Parks&lt;ref name=gotham927 /&gt; &amp;ndash; providing the Tweed Ring with even firmer control of the New York City government&lt;ref&gt;Paine, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; and enabling them to defraud the taxpayers of many more millions of dollars. In the words of [[Albert Bigelow Paine]], &quot;their methods were curiously simple and primitive. There were no skilful manipulations of figures, making detection difficult ... Connolly, as Controller, had charge of the books, and declined to show them. With his fellows, he also 'controlled' the courts and most of the bar.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paine, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Contractors working for the city &amp;ndash; &quot;Ring favorites, most of them &amp;ndash; were told to multiply the amount of each bill by five, or ten, or a hundred, after which, with Mayor Hall's 'O. K.' and Connolly's indorsement, it was paid ... through a go-between, who cashed the check, settled the original bill and divided the remainder ... between Tweed, Sweeny, Connolly and Hall&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the construction cost of the [[Tweed Courthouse|New York County Courthouse]], begun in 1861, grew to nearly $13 million &amp;ndash; about $178 million in today's dollars, and nearly twice the cost of the [[Alaska Purchase]] in 1867.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Steven|last=Mintz|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=211|title=Digital History |publisher=Digitalhistory.uh.edu|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;A carpenter was paid $360,751 (roughly $4.9 million today) for one month's labor in a building with very little woodwork ... a plasterer got $133,187 ($1.82 million) for two days' work&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalhistory&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Tammany Ring, Nast crop.jpg|thumb|left|375px|Nast depicts the Tweed Ring: &quot;Who stole the people's money?&quot; / &quot;'Twas him.&quot;]]

Tweed and his friends also garned huge profits from the development of the Upper East Side, especially [[Yorkville, Manhattan|Yorkville]] and [[Harlem]]. They would buy up undeveloped property, then use the resources of the city to improve the area &amp;ndash; for instance by installing pipes to bring in water from the [[Croton Aqueduct]] &amp;ndash; thus increasing the value of the land, after which they sold and took their profits.  The focus on the east side also slowed down the development of the west side, the [[topography]] of which made it more expensive to improve.  The ring also took their usual percentage of padded contracts, as well as raking off money from property taxes. Despite the corruption of Tweed and Tammany Hall, they did accomplish the development of upper Manhattan, though at the cost of tripling the city's bond debt to almost $90 million dollars.&lt;ref name=gotham929&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, pp.929-931&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Tweed era, the proposal to build a suspension bridge between New York and [[Brooklyn]], then an independent city, was floated by Brooklyn-boosters, who saw the ferry connections as a bottleneck to the Brooklyn's further development.  In order to ensure that the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] project would go forward, State Senator [[Henry Cruse Murphy]] approached Tweed to find out whether New York's aldermen would approve the proposal. Tweed's response was that $60,000 for the aldermen would close the deal, and contractor [[William C. Kingsley]] put up the cash, which was delivered in a [[carpetbag]].  Tweed and two other from Tammany also received over half the private stock of the Bridge Company, the charter of which specified that only private stockholders had voting rights, so that even though the cities of Brooklyn and Manhattan put up most of the money, they essentially had no control over the project.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, pp.934-935&lt;/ref&gt;

Tweed bought a mansion on [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] and [[43rd Street (Manhattan)|43rd Street]], and stabled his horses, carriages and sleighs on [[40th Street (Manhattan)|40th Street]].  By 1871, he was a member of the board of directors of not only the Erie Railroad and the Brooklyn Bridge Company, but also the Third Avenue Railway Company and the Harlem Gas Light Company.  He was president of the Guardian Savings Banks and he and his confederates set up the Tenth National Bank to better control their fortunes.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt;

==Scandal==
Tweed's downfall came in the wake of the [[Orange riots|Orange riot of 1871]], which came after Tammany Hall banned a parade of Irish Protestants celebrating an historical victory against Catholicism, because of a riot the year before in which eight people died when a crowd of Irish laborers attacked the paraders.  Under strong pressure from the newspapers and the Protestant elite of the city, Tammany reversed course, and the march was allowed to proceed, with protection from [[NYPD|city policemen]] and [[New York State National Guard|state militia]].  The result was an even larger riot in which over 60 people were killed and more than 150 injured.

Although Tammany's electoral power base was largely centered in the Irish immigrant population, it also needed the city's elite to acquiesce in its rule, and this was conditional on the machine's ability to control the actions of their people, but the July riot showed that this capability was not nearly as strong as had been supposed.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, pp.1003-1008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boss Tweed, Nast.jpg|thumb|right|237px|Nast shows Tweed's source of power: control of the ballot box. &quot;As long as I count the Votes, what are you going to do about it?&quot;]]

Tweed had for months been under attack from the ''[[New York Times]]'' and [[Thomas Nast]], the cartoonist from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' &amp;ndash; regarding Nast's cartoons, Tweed reportedly said, &quot;Stop them damned pictures. I don't care so much what the papers say about me. My constituents don't know how to read, but they can't help seeing them damned pictures!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bruce Jackson |url=http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~bjackson/lazio.html |title=lazio |publisher=Acsu.buffalo.edu |date=2000-11-02 |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; but their campaign had only limited success in gaining traction. They were able to force an examination of the city's books, but the blue-ribbon commission of six businessmen appointed by Mayor [[Abraham Oakley Hall]], a Tammany man, which included [[John Jacob Astor III]], banker [[Moses Taylor]] and others who benefited from Tammany's actions, found that the books had been &quot;faithfully kept&quot;, letting the air out of the effort to dethrone Tweed.&lt;ref name=g1008&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, pp.1008-1011&lt;/ref&gt;

The response to the Orange riot changed everything, and only days afterwards the ''Times''/Nast campaign began to garner popular support.&lt;ref name=g1008 /&gt; More importantly, the ''Times'' started to receive inside information from County Sheriff James O'Brien, whose support for Tweed had fluctuated during Tammany's reign. O'Brien had tried to [[blackmail]] Tammany by threatening to expose the ring's [[embezzlement]] to the press, and when this failed he provided the evidence he had collected to the ''Times''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellis347-8&quot;&gt;Ellis, pp. 347&amp;ndash;348.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, county auditor Matthew J. O'Rourke supplied additional details to the ''Times'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellis347-8&quot; /&gt; which was reportedly offered $5 million to not publish the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Times'' also obtained the accounts of the recently-deceased James Watson, who was the Tweed Ring's bookkeeper, and these were published daily, culminating in a special four-page supplement on July 29 headlined &quot;Gigantic Frauds of the Ring Exposed&quot;.&lt;ref name=g1008 /&gt; In August, Tweed began to transfer ownership in his real-estate empire and other investments to his family members.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt;

The exposes provoked an international crisis of confidence in New York City's finances, and, in particular, in its ability to repay its debts.  European investors were heavily positioned in the city's bonds and were already nervous about its management &amp;ndash; only the reputations of the underwriters were preventing a run on the city's securities.  New York's financial and business community knew that if the city's credit was to collapse, it could potentially bring down every bank in the city with it.&lt;ref name=g1008 /&gt; 

Thus, the city's elite met at [[Cooper Union]] in September to discuss political reform: but for the first time, the conversation included not only the usual reformers, but also [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] bigwigs such as [[Samuel J. Tilden]], who had been thrust aside during Tammany's elevation.  Although some at the meeting advocated lynching Tweed, the general consensus was that the &quot;wisest and best citizens&quot; should take over the governance of the city and attempt to restore investor confidence.  The result was the formation of the Executive Committee of Citizens and Taxpayers for Financial Reform of the City (also known as &quot;the Committee of Seventy&quot;), which attacked Tammany by cutting off the city's funding. Property owners refused to pay their municipal taxes, and a judge &amp;ndash; Tweed's old friend George Barnard, no less &amp;ndash; enjoined the city Comptroller from issuing bonds or spending money.  Unpaid workers turned against Tweed, marching ''en masse'' to City Hall demanding to be paid.  Tweed doled out some funds from his own purse &amp;ndash; $50,000 &amp;ndash; but it wasn't sufficient to alleviate the crisis, and Tammany began to lose its essential base.&lt;ref name=g1008 /&gt;

Shortly thereafter, the Comptroller resigned, appointing [[Andrew Haskell Green]], an associate of Tilden's, as his replacement.  Green loosened the purse strings again, allowing city departments not under Tammany control to borrow money to operate.  Green and Tilden had the city's records closely examined, and discovered money that went directly from city contractors into Tweed's pocket.  The following day, they had Tweed arrested.&lt;ref name=g1008 /&gt;

==Imprisonment, escape, and death==
Tweed was released on $1 million bail, and Tammany set to work to recover its position through the ballot box.  Tweed was re-elected to the state senate in November 1871, due to his personal popularity and largesse in his district, but in general Tammany did not do well, and the members of the Tweed Ring began to flee the jurisdiction, many going overseas.  Tweed was re-arrested, forced to resign his city positions, and was replaced as Tammany's leader.  Once again, he was released on bail &amp;ndash; $8 million this time &amp;ndash; but Tweed's supporters, such as [[Jay Gould]], felt the repercussions of his fall from power.&lt;ref name=g1008 /&gt;

Tweed's first trial, in January 1873, ended with a hung jury, but his retrial in November resulted in convictions on 204 of 220 counts, a fine of $12,750&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt; and a prison sentence of twelve years. Tweed served a year before the sentence was overturned, but was then hit with a civil suit by New York State attempting to recover $6 million in embezzled funds.  Unable to put up the $3 million bail, Tweed was locked up in the [[Ludlow Street Jail]], although he was allowed home visits. On one of these, Tweed escaped and fled to Spain, where he worked as a common seaman on a Spanish ship.&lt;ref name=g1008 /&gt; The U.S. government discovered his whereabouts and arranged for his arrest as soon as he reached the Spanish border; he was recognized from Nast's political cartoons. He was turned over to an American warship,&lt;ref name=g1008 /&gt; which delivered him to authorities in New York City on November 23, 1876, and he was returned to prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=T000440 |title=Tweed, William Marcy, (1823 - 1878)  |publisher=bioguide.congress.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Desperate and broken, Tweed now agreed to testify about the inner workings of his corrupt Ring to a special committee set up by the Board of Alderman,&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt; in return for his release, but after he did so, Tilden, now governor of New York, refused to abide by the agreement, and Tweed remained incarcerated. He died in the Ludlow Street Jail on April 12, 1878 from severe [[pneumonia]], and was buried in the [[Brooklyn]] [[Green-Wood Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Mayor [[Smith Ely]] would not allow the flag at City Hall to be flown at half staff.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt;

==Contributions==
In studies of Tweed and the Tammany Hall organization, historians have emphasized the thievery and conspiratorial nature of Boss Tweed, but along with lining his own pocket, and those of his friends and allies, Tammany and Tweed did substantially beneficial things which helped the development of New York City.

Tweed recognized that the support of his constituency was necessary for him to remain in power, and as a consequence he used the machinery of the city's government to provide numerous social services, including building more orphanages, almshouses and public baths.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt; Tweed also fought for the [[New York State Legislature]] to donate to private charities of all religious denominations, subsidize [[Catholic schools]] and hospitals, and keep the [[King James Bible]] available in schools. From 1869 to 1871, under Tweed's influence, the state of New York spent more on charities than for the entire time period from 1852 to 1868 combined&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Tweed also pushed through funding for a teachers college and prohibition of [[corporal punishment]] in schools, as well as salary increases for school teachers. Certain aspects of Tammany Hall's activities &amp;ndash; such as aid to the sick and unemployed, and advocacy for tenants and workers &amp;ndash; foreshadowed [[Labor history of the United States|later developments in the U.S. labor movement]] and [[United States Social Security|Social Security]].

During Tweed's regime, Broadway was widened between [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] and [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]], land was secured for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and the [[Upper East Side]] and [[Upper West Side]] were developed and provided the necessary infrastructure &amp;ndash; all to the benefit of the purses of the Tweed Ring, but also, ultimately, to the benefit of the people of the city.

Tweed himself wanted no particular recognition of his achievements, such as they were. When it was proposed, in March 1871, when he was at the height of his power, that a statue be erected in his honor, he declared: &quot;Statues are not elected to living men ... I claim to be a live man, and hope (Divine Providence permitting) to survive in all my vigor, politically and physically, some years to come.&quot;&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt; One of Tweed's unwanted legacies is that he has become &quot;the archetype of the bloated, rapacious, corrupt city boss.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt;

==Middle name==
Tweed never signed his name with anything other than a plain &quot;M.&quot;, and his middle name is often mistakenly listed, even by otherwise reputable sources, as &quot;Marcy&quot;, rather than &quot;Magear&quot;, but Tweed's son's name was William Magear Tweed, Jr.  The confusion is almost certainly because of a Thomas Nast cartoon with a picture of Tweed, supplemented with a quote from [[William L.

* In the 1945 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''Up In Central Park'', a [[musical comedy]] with music by [[Sigmund Romberg]], the role of Boss Tweed was played by [[Noah Beery, Sr.]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=1669 ''Up In Central Park'' (1945)] on [[Internet Broadway Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was then played by Malcolm Lee Beggs for a revival in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=473592 ''Up In Central Park'' (1947)] on [[Internet Broadway Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Up in Central Park|1948 film version]], Tweed is played by [[Vincent Price]].
* On the 1963-1964 [[CBS]] TV series ''The Great Adventure'', which presented one hour dramatizations of the lives of historical figures, [[Edward Andrews]] portrayed Tweed in the episode &quot;The Man Who Stole New York City&quot;, which aired on December 13, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0592454|The Great Adventure: The Man Who Stole New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]]'s 1977 science-fiction novel ''[[The Ophiuchi Hotline]]'', a crooked politician in the 27th Century human settlement on the Moon takes up the name &quot;Boss Tweed&quot; in deliberate emulation of the 19th Century politician, and even names his lunar headquarters &quot;Tammany Hall&quot;.
*[[Philip Bosco]] played Tweed in the 1986 [[TV movie]] ''Liberty''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004562/ &quot;Characters: Boss Tweed&quot;] on IMDB&lt;/ref&gt;
* The  2002 film ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' has Tweed, played by [[Jim Broadbent]], as a major supporting character. Both Tammany Hall and the type of corruption Tweed was known for are prominent in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021220/REVIEWS/212200304/1023|title=Gangs of New York|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=2002-12-20|publisher= suntimes.com|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tweed is portrayed as a defender of the rights of minorities and helper of those in need in [[Pete Hamill]]'s 2003 novel ''Forever''.
*In the [[Elseworlds]] miniseries ''Green Lantern: Evil's Might'', Tweed and Tammany Hall are featured as two of the main villains. This depiction of Tweed even goes as far as to mention Thomas Nast's political cartoons.
* Tweed is found in the Seventh Circle of Hell in the 2007 film version of ''[[Dante's Inferno (2007 film)|Dante's Inferno]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Balsall Heath''' is a [[working class]], [[inner-city]] area of [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. It is home to a diverse cultural mix including [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Arabs]], [[British African-Caribbean community|Afro-Caribbean]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[India]]n, [[Pakistan]]i, [[Kashmir]]i, and is the home of the [[Balti Triangle]], a collection of Asian [[Balti (food)|Balti]] restaurants and sweet centres.

==History==
[[Image:Balsallheath.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Balsall Heath, circa 1890.]]
[[Image:Balsall Heath Baths and Library.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Public Library and Baths, Balsall Heath|Balsall Heath Baths and Library]].]]
Balsall Heath was agricultural land between [[Moseley]] village and the city of Birmingham until the 1850s when expansion along Moseley Road joined the two. The area was originally part of the [[Worcestershire]] parish of [[King's Norton]], and was added to the [[county borough]] of Birmingham in [[Warwickshire]] on October 1, 1891.

During negotiations in the previous year it had been promised a public baths, to be built by the City of Birmingham Baths Department, and a free library, to be constructed by the Free Libraries Committee. In 1895 the library was opened on Moseley Road and in 1907 [[Public Library and Baths, Balsall Heath|Balsall Heath Baths]] were opened in an adjoining building.  The small lake (''Lady Pool'' on old maps) at the end of Ladypool Road was also filled-in to create a park. In 1900, the area became home to the city's [[College of Art, Balsall Heath|College of Art]]. 

Balsall Heath initially had a reasonably affluent population, which can still be seen in the dilapidated grandeur of some of the larger houses. A railway station on Brighton Road (on the Birmingham to [[Bristol]] line) led to further expansion, and the end of the 19th century saw a proliferation of high-density small [[terraced house]]s.  

A [[Muslim]] community was started in June 1940 when two [[Yemen]]is purchased an artisan cottage on Mary Street. They went on to establish the first mosque in the city. With the [[mosque]] being located in the area, more Muslim immigrants began to move into private lodgings in Balsall Heath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Abner Cohen|title=Urban Ethnicity|pages=96|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415329825}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Balsall Heath remained a respectable working-class suburb until the 1950s when [[street prostitution]] first appeared. Property values fell, attracting Birmingham's poorer immigrants. By the 1970s the area was notorious for [[robbery|street robberies]] and [[drug dealing]]. Prostitutes also sat semi-naked in the windows of houses on Cheddar Road, openly touting for trade.

By 1980, many of Balsall Heath's houses were in a dilapidated condition, and some were still without bathrooms or indoor toilets. The local authority considered demolishing these properties but chose to refurbish them as part of an [[Urban Renewal]] scheme. Most of these Victorian terraces still exist and characterize the area today. The area's traditional 'brick' pavements were replaced at this time by the more modern and conventional paving slabs.

Balsall Heath's low rents also attracted a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] student population. Its proximity to the [[University of Birmingham]], the city centre and the ‘trendy’ area of [[Moseley]] were also contributing factors. There was little conflict between the students and locals despite their vastly differing lifestyles. However a knife-incident in 1991 led to an article in [[Redbrick (Newspaper)|Redbrick]] warning students not to live in the area.

In September 1992, a report was published encouraging the formation of a zone of tolerance towards prostitution in Balsall Heath. This was opposed by a local police inspector and by residents. The following year Samo Paull, a woman working as a prostitute, was abducted from Balsall Heath and murdered.  In 1994, local residents began to organize street patrols forcing the prostitutes and street criminals out of the area. These patrols had the qualified support of the police but were regarded as [[vigilante]]s by some. During this time the [[Sisters of Charity]], a Christian organisation, offered outreach support to the prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vicky Randall|coauthors=Georgina Waylen|title=Gender, Politics and the State|pages=97–98|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=041516401X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The area subsequently enjoyed a slow revival. House prices are now similar to those in other inner-city areas, while the crime rate is amongst the lowest. Property developers were also confident enough to convert the former Robinson's warehouse on Moseley Road into up-market [[Apartment|flats]], something that would have been incredible ten years earlier.

In July 2005 Balsall Heath was hit by a [[Birmingham Tornado (UK)|tornado]], which devastated many buildings around Church Road and Ladypool Road. Birmingham City Council offered loans to those who were unable to repair their properties, and the area has now made a full recovery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Old &amp; New Buildings in Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|210px|Bunge &amp; Born's Buenos Aires headquarters (''left'').]]
'''Bunge y Born''' was a [[multinational corporation]] based in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], whose diverse interests included [[food processing]] and international trade in [[Cereal|grain]]s and [[oilseed]]s. It is now known as [[Bunge Limited]].

==History==
Bunge &amp; Born was founded in 1884 by Ernesto Bunge, a [[German Argentine]] whose uncle, Carl Bunge, had been Consul General in Argentina for both the [[Netherlands]] and [[Prussia]], and his brother-in-law, Jorge Born, who was recently arrived from [[Antwerp]]. The company superseded the Bunge Company founded in [[Amsterdam]] by Johann Bunge, in 1818. Following the purchase of 60,000 hectares (150,000 acres) of prime [[pampas]] wheat fields, Bunge &amp; Born established ''Centenera'', their first food processing plant, in 1899. They had one of the largest wheat mills in the country built on a [[Puerto Madero]] lot in 1902, and with it, established ''[[Molinos Río de la Plata]]'' (later a leader in the local retail foods market).&lt;ref name=educ&gt;[http://www.educ.ar/educar/site/educar/kbee:/educar/content/portal-content/taxonomia-recursos/recurso/ec264d95-fe4d-4ca0-91a9-56f79f08e909.recurso/943ae22b-4e52-49f0-97f3-b7ed2ddd0762/soc-poli-6.pdf educ.ar - Procesos económicos en la Argentina: el caso de Bunge y Born {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company started Argentina's first [[burlap]] bag manufacturer, following which they successfully lobbied government policy makers for [[protectionism|protective tariffs]] on the then-critical commercial staple. They established a mortgage bank, the ''Banco Hipotecario Franco Argentino'', and  a subsidiary in [[Brazil]] in 1905, and by 1910, they reportedly controlled 80% of Argentine cereal exports (Argentina was, by then, the world's third-largest grain exporter).&lt;ref&gt;Rock, David. ''Argentina: 1516-1982. University of California Press, 1987. p.172&lt;/ref&gt;  They later established paint manufacturer ''Alba'' (1925), chemical and fertilizer maker ''Compañía Química'', and textile maker ''Grafa'' (1932), among others; by the late 1920s, the company's annual export receipts alone reached US$300 million.&lt;ref name=educ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indec.mecon.ar/nuevaweb/cuadros/19/anuario_com_ext_2007.pdf INDEC: Comercio exterior {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The company inaugurated its [[Neo-gothic architecture|neo-gothic]] Buenos Aires headquarters on [[Leandro Alem Avenue]], designed by local architect Pablo Naeff, in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.ciudadbaires.com.ar/proy-cat/0701350.html|title=Inmueble sito en 25 de Mayo 501|publisher=Ciudad Baires}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bunge &amp; Born's near-monopoly on cereal and flour exports ended with populist President [[Juan Perón]]'s 1946 establishment of the [[IAPI]], a state agricultural purchasing and export agent.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Argentina''. London: Scarecrow Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The company responded by extending its reach into the country fast-growing retail processed foods market, and though its prominence as the nation's chief exporter was partly restored by Perón's 1955 ouster and the IAPI's liquidation, its focus remained domestic over the next three decades. A privately-held company, Bunge &amp; Born did not release periodical financial statements, though it reported US$2 billion in gross receipts in 1962; by then, it had become a leader in [[commodity futures]] trading, operating 110 offices worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Week''. October 19, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bunge, Born, Hirsch, Engels and De La Tour families remained the company's chief stock-holders, and by extension, leaders in the domestic textile, paint, chemical, fertilizer, and food processing industries.&lt;ref name=euro&gt;[http://salsa.babson.edu/Pages/Articles/99-01%20EM%20Bunge.htm ''Euromoney'': Decline of an Argentine dynasty. January 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; On September 19, 1974, however, the consortium was shaken by the kidnapping of siblings Jorge and Juan Born by the far-left terrorist group, [[Montoneros]]. The Born brothers were kept in a known [[SIDE|Argentine State Intelligence]] safehouse for nine months until their June 1975 release, something made possible without public suspicion of outside involvement by the agency's numerous contacts inside the Montoneros (including the leader, Mario Firmenich). Freed for a US$60 million ransom (the largest on record at that time), the ordeal triggered the company headquarters' relocation to [[São Paolo]], Brazil, and contributed to the [[March 1976 coup]].&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Martin. ''Dossier Secreto''. Westview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retaining their Argentine interests (44 companies, by the 1980s), the families continued to suffer from ongoing disputes, and in 1987, CEO Mario Hirsch died suddenly. The election of [[Carlos Menem]] to the Argentine Presidency in May 1989, however, resulted in an agreement between the President-elect and Jorge Born that gave the company partial control over national economic policy. Bunge &amp; Born provided the Menem government with its first two economy ministers, and the combination of large rate increases on public services (around 500%), a simplified exchange rate and a massive, mandatory wage hike led to a sharp economic turnaround between July and November 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/07/business/international-report-inflation-unites-peronists-and-argentine-business.html?pagewanted=all ''New York Times'': Inflation Unites Peronists and Argentine Business]&lt;/ref&gt; This foray into government policy making, however, ended in a new currency crisis that December and the failure (compounded by the company's lackluster business performance) resulted in Born's 1991 ouster from the board; he was replaced by Chief Operations Officer [[Octavio Caraballo]].&lt;ref name=euro/&gt;

Beset by the rift between Jorge Born and his brother, Juan, the prior unity between the shareholders disintegrated as Caraballo struggled to modernize the company. Family frictions intensified when Jorge Born formed a business partnership with one of his former kidnappers, erstwhile Montonero strategist [[Rodolfo Galimberti]].&lt;ref name=euro/&gt;

==Bunge International==
The company was converted into the [[Bermuda]]-registered [[Bunge International]] in 1994, retaining the Bunge y Born name only in Argentina. Bunge remained a privately-held company of 180 shareholders (including the longtime controlling family interests) and divested itself in 1998 of almost all its retail foods interests in favor of a greater role in international [[agribusiness]] and commodity markets; by then the company's gross annual turnover had reached US$13 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/economico/98-05-31/o-00401e.htm ''Clarín'': La retirada final del grupo Bunge &amp; Born {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Bunge ultimately went [[public company|public]] on the [[NYSE]] in 2001, becoming ''Bunge Limited''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bunge.com/about-bunge/timeline.html Bunge timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&quot;The Big Apple&quot;''' is a nickname for [[New York City]]. It was first popularized in the 1920s by [[John J. Fitz Gerald]], a sports writer for the ''New York Morning Telegraph''. Its popularity since the 1970s is due to a promotional campaign by the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, known now as [[NYC &amp; Company]].

{{wiktionary}}

Although the history of ''the Big Apple'' was once thought a mystery,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_382.html Why is New York called the Big Apple?], [[The Straight Dope]] February 18, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; research over the past two decades, primarily by amateur etymologist [[Barry Popik]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/ The Big Apple]. This web site, owned and maintained by Barry Popik, contains updated information reflecting research by Popik and others and includes the text of significant examples.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gerald Cohen of [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Cohen, ''Origin of New York City's Nickname &quot;The Big Apple&quot;'' (1991), ISBN 3631437870.&lt;/ref&gt; has provided a reasonably clear picture of the term's history. Previously, there were a number of false etymologies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/category/C10/ False Etymologies].&lt;/ref&gt; of which the most ridiculous was the claim that the term derived from a New York brothel whose madam was known as Eve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/19971010010804/http://www.salwen.com/apple.html Why Is New York City Called &quot;The Big Apple&quot;?] [[Internet Archive#Wayback Machine|Wayback Machine]] archive of earlier version of web page.&lt;/ref&gt; This was subsequently exposed as a hoax&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_whore_hoax_1800s/ Big Apple Whore Hoax (1800s!)].&lt;/ref&gt; and has been replaced on the source web site with more accurate information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salwen.com/apple.html Why Is New York City Called &quot;The Big Apple&quot;?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest citation for &quot;big apple&quot; is the 1909 book ''The Wayfarer in New York,'' by [[Edward Martin]], writing: &quot;Kansas is apt to see in New York a greedy city. . . . It inclines to think that '''the big apple''' gets a disproportionate share of the national sap&quot; (emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | first = William | last = Safire | authorlink = William Safire | title = Big Applesource | journal = [[The New York Times Magazine]] | date = September 17, 2000 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/17/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-9-17-00-on-language-slurvian.html?pagewanted=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | first = William | last = Safire | authorlink = William Safire | title = The Right Word in the Right Place at the Right Time | year = 2004 | page = [http://books.google.com/books?id=blcCxBWVdzgC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=big%20apple p. 23]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Safire]] considered this the coinage, but the Random House Dictionary of American Slang considers the usage &quot;metaphorical or perhaps proverbial, rather than a concrete example of the later slang term&quot;, and Popik likewise does not consider this the coinage.

''The Big Apple'' was first popularized as a reference to New York City by John J. Fitz Gerald in a number of ''New York Morning Telegraph'' articles in the 1920s in reference to New York horse-racing. The earliest of these was a casual reference on May 3, 1921:

&lt;blockquote&gt;J. P. Smith, with Tippity Witchet and others of the L. T.

Fitz Gerald referred to the &quot;big apple&quot; frequently thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/numerous_1920s_big_apple_citations_in_the_new_york_morning_telegraph/ Numerous 1920s “Big Apple” citations in the New York Morning Telegraph].&lt;/ref&gt; He explained his use in a February 18, 1924, column under the headline &quot;Around the Big Apple&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Big Apple. The dream of every lad that ever threw a leg over a thoroughbred and the goal of all horsemen. There's only one Big Apple. That's New York.

Two dusky stable hands were leading a pair of thoroughbred around the &quot;cooling rings&quot; of adjoining stables at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans and engaging in desultory conversation.

&quot;Where y'all goin' from here?&quot; queried one.

&quot;From here we're headin' for The Big Apple,&quot; proudly replied the other.

&quot;Well, you'd better fatten up them skinners or all you'll get from the apple will be the core,&quot; was the quick rejoinder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/first_big_apple_explanation_february_18_1924/ First “Big Apple” explanation: February 18, 1924]. See also the original article [http://www.barrypopik.com/images/FitzGerald1.gif image].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fitz Gerald's reference to the &quot;dusky&quot; stable hands suggests the term's origin may lie in [[African-American]] culture. Support for this is found in the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'', an African-American newspaper that had a national circulation. “Ragtime” Billy Tucker, a vaudeville/ragtime performer and writer for the ''Defender'', there used &quot;big apple&quot; to refer to New York in a non-horse-racing context on September 16, 1922:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I trust your trip to 'the big apple' (New York) was a huge success and only wish that I had been able to make it with you.&lt;ref name=&quot;linguistlist_antedating_1920vaudeville&quot;&gt;[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0801D&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R9794 &quot;Big Apple&quot; antedating]; [http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/1920s_vaudeville_ragtime_big_apple_citations/ 1920s Vaudeville/Ragtime “Big Apple” Citations].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The same writer had earlier used &quot;Big Apple&quot; as a reference to a different city, Los Angeles.  This example, from May 15, 1920, is the earliest known use of &quot;Big Apple&quot; to refer to any city. It is possible that the writer simply understood &quot;Big Apple&quot; as an appropriate nickname for any large city:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Pal, Tony: No, Ragtime Billy Tucker hasn't dropped completely out of existence, but is still in the 'Big Apple', Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;linguistlist_antedating_1920vaudeville&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the late 1920s, New York writers other than Fitz Gerald were starting to use &quot;Big Apple&quot; and were using it outside of a horse-racing context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/1920s_non_horseracing_big_apple_citations/ 1920s Non-Horseracing “Big Apple” Citations].&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Big Apple&quot; was a popular song&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_song_by_bob_emmerich/ “Big Apple” song by Bob Emmerich].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Big Apple (dance)|dance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_in_the_1930s_two_clubs_plus_song_and_dance/ “Big Apple” in the 1930s (Two clubs, plus song and dance)].&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1930s.  [[Walter Winchell]] and other writers continued to use the name in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_in_the_1940s_1950s/ “Big Apple” in the 1940s-1950s].&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, &quot;the Big Apple&quot; was known only as an old name for New York.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Vonnegut, ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' 265 (1969; Delta Trade Paperbacks ed. 1999) (&quot;That's what they used to call New York&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, however, the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau (now NYC &amp; Company, the official marketing and tourism organization for New York City),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycvisit.com/content/index.cfm?pagePkey=20 About NYC and Company].&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of its president, Charles Gillett, began promoting &quot;the Big Apple&quot; for the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_1970s_revival_charlie_gillett_and_lew_rudin/ Big Apple 1970s Revival: Charlie Gillett and Lew Rudin].&lt;/ref&gt; It has remained popular since then.&lt;ref name=voa&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.voanews.com/a-23-2009-12-24-voa2-84659432.html|title=Words and Their Stories: Nicknames for New York City|date=2010-02-23|work=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor [[Rudolph W. Giuliani]] in 1997 signed legislation designating the southwest corner of West [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]] and Broadway, the corner on which John J. Fitz Gerald lived from 1934 to 1963, as &quot;Big Apple Corner.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/om/html/97/sp082-97.html Mayor's Press Office, Release No. 082-97, Mayor Giuliani Signs Legislation Creating &quot;Big Apple Corner&quot; in Manhattan (Feb. 12, 1997)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York Mets]] have featured a &quot;Home Run Apple&quot; that rises whenever a Mets player hits a home run. It has become a symbol of the Mets baseball team, recognized throughout the league as an iconic feature of the Mets' stadiums. It first appeared in [[Shea Stadium]], and the original can still be seen on display in [[Citi Field]], in the Jackie Robinson Rotunda. Citifield now uses a new apple, one that is nearly four times the size of the original.

'''Thomas P. &quot;Boston&quot; Corbett''' (1832 – [[Death in absentia|presumed dead]] 1894) was the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union Army]] soldier who shot and killed [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s assassin, [[John Wilkes Booth]].  He disappeared after 1888, but circumstantial evidence suggests that he died in the [[Great Hinckley Fire]] in 1894, although this remains impossible to substantiate.

==Early life==
Corbett was born in London, England. His family emigrated to New York City. He became a [[hatter]] in [[Troy, New York]]. It has been suggested that the fumes of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] used in the hatter's trade caused Corbett's later mental problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Dale L. |coauthors=Jakes, John|title=Legends and Lies: Great Mysteries of the American West|publisher=Macmillan|year=1998|page=159|isbn=0-312-86848-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family and &quot;rebirth&quot;===
Corbett married, but his wife died in childbirth. Following her death, he moved to [[Boston]], and continued working as a hatter. He joined the Methodist Episcopal Church and changed his name to Boston, the name of the city where he was converted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harper's Weekly, May 13, 1865&quot;&gt;Harper's Weekly, May&amp;nbsp;13, 1865&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to imitate [[Jesus]], he began to wear his hair very long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kauffman|first=Michael W. |title=American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies|publisher=Random House|year=2004|page=310|isbn=0-375-50785-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July&amp;nbsp;16, 1858, in order to avoid the temptation of prostitutes, Corbett [[castration|castrated]] himself with a pair of scissors. He then ate a meal and went to a prayer meeting, before going for medical treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swanson329&quot;&gt;Swanson, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
===Enlistment in the Union army===
[[File:Sergent Boston Corbett, 16th N.Y. Cav. Who shot J. Wilkes Booth, April 26, 1865. (2719965829).jpg|thumb|upright|Sgt. Boston Corbett, Union Army.]]
In April 1861, early in the [[American Civil War]], Corbett enlisted as a private in Company I of the 12 Regiment New York Militia. He was discharged in August, at the end of the regiment's 3 month enlistment. Corbett re-enlisted in September 1863 as a private in Company L, 16th New York Cavalry Regiment. Captured by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] Colonel [[John S. Mosby]]'s men at [[Culpeper, Virginia]] on June&amp;nbsp;24, 1864, Corbett was held prisoner at [[Andersonville prison]] for five months, when he was [[Prisoner exchange|exchanged]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harper's Weekly, May 13, 1865&quot;/&gt; On his return to his company, he was promoted to sergeant. Corbett would later testify for the prosecution in the trial of the commandant of Andersonville, Captain [[Henry Wirz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chamlee|first=Roy Z. |coauthors=Chamlee, Roy Z., Jr.|title=Lincoln's Assassins: A Complete Account of Their Capture, Trial, and Punishment|publisher=McFarland|year=1989|page=289|isbn=0-899-50420-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chipman|first=Norton Parker |title=The Horrors of Andersonville Rebel Prison: Trial of Henry Wirz, the Andersonville Jailer; Jefferson Davis' Defense of Andersonville Prison Fully Refuted|publisher=Bancroft Co.|year=1891|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pursuit of John Wilkes Booth===
[[File:John Wilkes Booth wanted poster new.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wanted poster]] for [[John Wilkes Booth]], [[John Surratt]], and [[David Herold]] (1865)]]

Corbett was a member of the 16th New York Cavalry Regiment sent, on April 24, 1865, to apprehend [[John Wilkes Booth]], the assassin of Abraham Lincoln, who was still at large. Two days later the regiment surrounded Booth and his accomplice, [[David Herold]], in a tobacco barn on the [[Virginia]] farm of Richard Garrett. The barn was set on fire in an attempt to force them out into the open. Herold surrendered, but Booth remained inside. Corbett was positioned near a large crack in the barn wall. He saw Booth moving about inside and shot him with his [[Colt revolver]] despite [[Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]'s orders that Booth should be taken alive. Booth was struck in the neck, the bullet severing his [[spinal cord]], and he died a little more than three hours later.
[[File:boston corbett.jpg|thumb|right|Boston Corbett]]
Corbett was immediately arrested for violation of his orders, but Stanton later had the charges dropped. Stanton remarked, &quot;The rebel is dead. The patriot lives.&quot; Corbett received his share of the reward money, amounting to $1,653.84.&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

In his official statement, Corbett claimed he shot Booth because he thought Lincoln's assassin was preparing to use his weapons. This was contradicted by the other witnesses. When asked later why he did it, Corbett answered that &quot;Providence directed me&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swanson340&quot;&gt;Swanson, p. 340&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corbett's later years==
===Immediate post-war life===
After his discharge from the army in August 1865, Corbett went back to work as a hatter, first in Boston, later in [[Connecticut]], and by 1870 in [[New Jersey]]. His life was marked by increasingly erratic behavior. In 1875, he threatened several men with a pistol at a soldier's reunion in [[Caldwell, Ohio]]. In 1878, he moved to [[Concordia, Kansas]].

===Madness===
In 1887, because of his fame as Booth's killer, Corbett was appointed assistant doorkeeper of the [[Kansas House of Representatives]] in [[Topeka]]. One day he overheard a conversation in which the legislature's opening prayer was mocked. He jumped to his feet and brandished a revolver. No one was hurt, but Corbett was arrested and sent to the Topeka Asylum for the Insane. On May&amp;nbsp;26, 1888, he escaped from the asylum. He went to [[Neodesha, Kansas]], and stayed briefly with Richard Thatcher, whom he had met when they were both prisoners of war. When he left, he told Thatcher he was going to Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Byron Berkeley |title=Abraham Lincoln and Boston Corbett: With Personal Recollections of Each; John Wilkes Booth and Jefferson Davis, a True Story of Their Capture|publisher=B.B. Johnson|year=1914|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His &quot;madness&quot; may have been the result of exposure to [[mercury (element)|mercury]], an element commonly used in hat manufacturing.  It is so well known for this side effect that it has given rise to the expression &quot;[[mad as a hatter]]&quot;.

===Presumed fate===
Rather than going to Mexico, Corbett is believed to have settled in a cabin he built in the forests near [[Hinckley, Minnesota]]. He is thought to have died in the [[Great Hinckley Fire]] of September&amp;nbsp;1, 1894. Although there is no proof, the name &quot;Thomas Corbett&quot; does appear on the list of dead and missing.&lt;ref name=Herald&gt;''Lincoln Herald, Volume 86'', Lincoln Memorial University Press., 1984, pp 152–155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kubicek&gt;Kubicek, Earl C, &quot;The Case of the Mad Hatter&quot;, ''Lincoln herald, Volume 83'', Lincoln Memorial University Press, 1981, pp 708–719&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorials===
In 1958, Boy Scout Troop 31 of [[Concordia, Kansas]] built a roadside monument to Boston Corbett. It is on Key Road in Concordia. A small sign also was placed to mark the dug hole where Corbett for a time had lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/16178|title=He Killed Lincoln's Killer, Then Lived In A Hole|accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Berber sub-languages''' (native name: ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖⵜ ''Tamazight'' {{IPA-tam|tæmæˈzɪɣt], [θæmæˈzɪɣθ|}}) are the indigenous sub-languages of [[North Africa]] west of the Nile. The Berber group is assigned by linguists to the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] [[language family]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Richard J., chapter ''Afroasiatic'' in Heine, Bernd &amp; Nurse, Derek, editors, ''African Languages: An Introduction'' Cambridge 2000. ISBN 0-521-66629-5. The expression (page 74) that Afroasiatic is &quot;the least controversial of the four phyla of languages proposed by Greenberg for the African continent&quot; suggests at least some controversy about this proposed relationship between Berber and the Semitic languages.&lt;/ref&gt; A relatively sparse population speaking a group of closely related and similar [[language]]s and [[dialect]]s extends across the [[Atlas Mountains]], the [[Sahara]], and the northern part of the [[Sahel]] in [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Niger]], [[Mali]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], and the [[Siwa Oasis]] area of [[Egypt]]. There is a movement among speakers of the closely related [[Northern Berber sub-languages]] to unite them into a single [[standard language]].

The name Tamazight, which traditionally referred specifically to standard Tamazight of (Middle Atlas Tamazight and Grand High Atlas Tamazight) Morocco, and is also used by the native speakers of [[Riff language|Riff]] (Tarifit), is being increasingly used for this Standard Berber, or even for Berber as a whole. Its usage is less consistent in some areas like the [[Kabylia]] where locals call their language ''Taqbaylit'' rather than ''Tamazight''. Due to the rising Berber cultural and political activism and its recent prominence in the North African media, the popularity of the term Tamazight made it known and recognizable by virtually every citizen in North Africa, including non-Berber speakers.

Among the notable varieties of Berber are Central Morocco Tamazight, Riff, [[Shilha language|Shilha]] (Tashelhiyt), [[Kabyle language|Kabylian]] (Taqbaylit), and the [[Tuareg sub-languages|Tuareg dialect chain]]. The Berber sub-languages have had a written tradition, on and off, for over 2,000 years, although the tradition has been frequently disrupted by various invasions. It was first written in the [[Tifinagh]] alphabet, still used by the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]; the oldest dated inscription is from about 200 BC. Later, between about 1000 AD and 1500 AD, it was written in the [[Arabic alphabet]]; since the 20th century, it has often been written in the [[Latin alphabet]], especially among the [[Kabyle people|Kabylians]].

A modernized form of the [[Tifinagh]] alphabet was made official in [[Morocco]] in 2003, and a similar one is sparsely used in [[Algeria]]. The [[Berber Latin alphabet]] is preferred by Moroccan Berber writers and is still predominant in Algeria (although unofficially). [[Mali]] and [[Niger]] recognized the Berber Latin alphabet and customized it to the Tuareg phonological system. However, traditional Tifinagh is still used in those countries. Both Tifinagh and Latin scripts are being increasingly used in Morocco and parts of Algeria, while the Arabic script has been abandoned by Berber writers.

==Terminology==
{{Incubator|code=rif|rif/Tasna Tamezwarut}}
{{Incubator|code= ber/Tamzwarut}}
{{InterWiki|code=kab|Kabyle language}}

The term ''Berber'' has been used in [[Europe]] since at least the 17th century, and is still used today. It was borrowed from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] designation for these populations, البربر, ''al-Barbar'', see [[Berber (name)]].

The term '''Tamazight''' traditionally referred specifically to the [[Central Morocco Tamazight]] dialect, but it has recently{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} gained ground over ''Berber'', particularly to refer to [[Northern Berber sub-languages]], just as &quot;[[Amazigh]]&quot; is used to refer to a native Berber speaker. Etymologically, it means &quot;language of the free&quot; or &quot;of the noblemen&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Traditionally, the term &quot;tamazight&quot; (in various forms: &quot;thamazighth&quot;, &quot;tamasheq&quot;, &quot;tamajeq&quot;, &quot;tamahaq&quot;) was used by many Berber groups to refer to the language they spoke, including the Middle Atlas, the [[Rif people|Rif]], [[Sened language|Sened]] in [[Tunisia]], and the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]].
However, other terms were used by other groups; for instance, many parts of western Algeria called their language &quot;taznatit&quot; or [[Zenata|Zenati]], while the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]]s called theirs &quot;thaqvaylith&quot;, the inhabitants of [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] &quot;tasiwit&quot;, and the [[Zenaga]]. In Tunisia, the local Berber sub-languages are usually referred to as &quot;Shelha&quot;. ?? &quot;Tuddhungiya&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rosettaproject.org/live/search/showpages?ethnocode=ZEN&amp;doctype=detail&amp;version=0&amp;scale=six&lt;/ref&gt;
The Zenata of the Rif also used to their language &quot;Zenatia&quot; specifically to distinguish it from the &quot;Tamazight&quot; spoken by the rest of the Rif.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

One group, the [[Linguasphere Observatory]], has attempted to introduce the [[neologism]] &quot;Tamazic sub-languages&quot; to refer to the Berber sub-languages.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Origin==
{{main|Proto-Berber}}
Berber is a member of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language family]].
Its grouping within that family is uncertain.

Since modern Berber sub-languages are relatively homogeneous, the date of the [[Proto-Berber]] language from which the modern group is derived was probably comparatively recent, comparable to the age of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] or [[Romance languages|Romance]] families.
By contrast, the split of the group from the other Afro-Asiatic sub-phyla is much earlier, and is sometimes associated with the Mesolithic [[Capsian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;
Louali, N., Philippson, G., 2003, &quot;Les Protoméditerranéens Capsiens sont-ils des protoberbères ? Interrogations de linguiste.&quot;, GALF (Groupement des Anthropologues de Langue Française), Marrakech,, 22-25 septembre 2003.[http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/equipes/index.asp?Action=Edit&amp;Langue=EN&amp;Equipe=3%20%20&amp;Page=Action&amp;ActionNum=26]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==
{{Main|Berber orthography}}
There are a number of different scripts with which Berber sub-languages may be written. The choice of writing system is often based on politics rather than practical considerations.

==Status==
After independence, all the [[Maghreb]] countries to varying degrees pursued a policy of [[Arabization]], aimed partly at displacing [[French language|French]] from its colonial position as the dominant language of education and literacy. Under this policy the use of the Amazigh / Berber sub-languages was suppressed or even banned. This state of affairs has been contested by Berbers in Morocco and Algeria—especially [[Kabylie]]—and is now being addressed in both countries by introducing the Berber language in some schools and by recognizing Berber as a &quot;[[national language]]&quot; in Algeria,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} - [http://www.apn-dz.org/apn/french/constitution96/loi02_03.htm « Loi n° 02-03 portent révision constitutionnelle »], adopted on April 10, 2002, allotting in particular to &quot;Tamazight&quot; the status of national language.&lt;/ref&gt; though not as an [[official language|official]] one. No such measures have been taken in the other Maghreb countries. In [[Mali]] and [[Niger]], there are a few schools that teach partially in [[Tamasheq sub-languages|Tamasheq]].

==Population==
&lt;!-- NOTE: this section is intended only for estimates backed up by a referenced academic or academic organization. Many sites (eg&lt;ref&gt;http://www.libyamazigh.org/&lt;/ref&gt; for Libya) make claims about population backed up neither by data nor by academic reputation.--&gt;

The exact population of Berber speakers is hard to ascertain, since most North African countries do not record language data in their censuses. The [[Ethnologue]] provides a useful academic starting point; however, its bibliographic references are inadequate, and it rates its own accuracy at only B-C for the area. Early colonial censuses may provide better documented figures for some countries; however, these are also very much out of date.

:&quot;Few census figures are available; all countries (Algeria and Morocco included) do not count Berber lsub-anguages. The 1972 Niger census reported Tuareg, with other languages, at 127,000 speakers. Population shifts in location and number, effects of urbanization and education in other languages, etc., make estimates difficult. In 1952 A. Basset (LLB.4) estimated the number of Berberophones at 5,500,000. Between 1968 and 1978 estimates ranged from eight to thirteen million (as reported by Galand, LELB 56, pp. 107, 123-25); Voegelin and Voegelin (1977, p. 297) call eight million a conservative estimate. In 2006, S. Chaker estimated that the Berberophone populations of Kabylie and the three Moroccan groups numbered more than one million each; and that in Algeria, 12,650,000, or one out of three Algerians, speak a Berber language (Chaker 1984, pp. 8-9).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isp.msu.edu/AfrLang/Berber-root.html&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Morocco]]''': In 1952, André Basset (&quot;La langue berbère&quot;, ''Handbook of African Languages'', Part I, Oxford) estimated that a &quot;small majority&quot; of Morocco's population spoke Berber. The 1960 census estimated that 34% of Moroccans spoke Berber, including bi-, tri-, and quadrilinguals. In 2000, [[Karl Prasse]] cited &quot;more than half&quot; in an interview conducted by Brahim Karada at Tawalt.com. According to the Ethnologue (by deduction from its Moroccan Arabic figures), the Berber-speaking population should be estimated at 35% or around 10.5 million speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/14/show_country.asp?name=Morocco The Ethnologe, Languages of Morocco]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the figures it gives for individual languages only add up to 7.5 million, divided into three dialects:
**[[Riff language|Riff]]: 1.5 million (1991)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/14/show_language.asp?code=RIF The Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Shilha language|Shilha]]: 3 million (1998)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=shi The Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Central Morocco Tamazight]]: 3 million (1998)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=tzm The Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[INALCO]] estimates the figure of Middle-Atlas speakers at 4-5 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inalco.fr/crb/crb_2/fiches_dialectes/tamazight.htm INALCO]&lt;/ref&gt;
**INALCO estimates the figure of Shilha speakers at 8 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inalco.fr/crb/crb_2/fiches_dialectes/chleuh.htm INALCO]&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey included in the official Moroccan census of 2004 and published by several Moroccan newspapers gave the following figures: 34% of people in rural regions spoke a Berber language and 21% in urban zones did, the national average would be 28.4% or 8.52 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bladi.net/9229-marocain-berbere.html Bladinet]&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible, however, that the survey asked for the language &quot;used in daily life&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://cfieljadida2009.blogvie.com/2008/12/11/les-derniers-chiffres-du-recensement-28-de-la-population-parlent-une-langue-amazighe/ Al Bayane Newspaper, 10/07/2005]&lt;/ref&gt; which would result of course in figures clearly lower than those of native speakers, as the language is not recognized for official purposes and many Berbers who live in an Arabic-speaking environment cannot use it in daily life; also the use of Berber in public was frowned upon until the 1990s and might affect the result of the survey{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}.

Adding up the population (according to the official census of 2004) of the Berber-speaking regions as shown on a 1973 [[Languages of Morocco|map of the CIA]] results in at least 10 million speakers, not counting the numerous Berber population which lives outside these regions in the bigger cities.

[[Mohamed Chafik]] claims 80% of Moroccans are Berbers. It is not clear, however, whether he means &quot;speakers of Berber sub-languages&quot; or &quot;people of Berber descent&quot;.

The division of Moroccan Berber dialects in three groups, as used by The Ethnologue is common in linguistic publications, but is significantly complicated by local usage: thus Shilha is sub-divided into Shilha of the Dra valley, Tasusit (the language of the Souss) and several other (mountain)-dialects. Moreover, linguistic boundaries are blurred, such that certain dialects cannot accurately be described as either Central Morocco Tamazight (spoken in the Central and eastern Atlas area) or Shilha.

*'''[[Algeria]]''': In 1906, the total population speaking Berber sub-languages in Algeria (excluding the thinly populated Sahara) was estimated at 1,305,730 out of 4,447,149, i.e. 29%. (Doutté &amp; Gautier, ''Enquête sur la dispersion de la langue berbère en Algérie, faite par l'ordre de M. le Gouverneur Général'', Alger 1913.) The 1911 census, however, found 1,084,702 speakers out of 4,740,526, i.e. 23%; Doutté &amp; Gautier suggest that this was the result of a serious undercounting of [[Shawiya language|Shawiya]] in areas of widespread [[bilingualism]]. A trend was noted for Berber groups surrounded by Arabic (as in [[Blida]]) to adopt Arabic, while Arabic speakers surrounded by Berber (as in Sikh ou Meddour near [[Tizi-Ouzou]]) tended to adopt Berber. In 1952, André Basset estimated that about a third of Algeria's population spoke Berber. The Algerian census of 1966 found 2,297,997 out of 12,096,347 Algerians, or 19%, to speak &quot;Berber&quot;. In 1980, [[Salem Chaker]] estimated that &quot;in Algeria, 3,650,000, or one out of five Algerians, speak a Berber language&quot; (Chaker 1984, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9). According to the Ethnologue [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=DZ], more recent estimates include 14% (corresponding to the total figures it gives for each Berber language added together, 4 million) and (by deduction from its Algerian Arabic figures) 29% (Hunter 1996). Most of these are accounted for by two dialects (percentages based on historical population data from appropriate dates [http://www.populstat.info/Africa/algeriac.htm]):
**[[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]: 2,540,000 = 9% (Ethnologue, 1995) - 6,000,000 = 20% (Ethnologue, 1998). Total for all countries (Ethnologue): 3,126,000. (Needless to say, the latter two figures, though cited by the same source, are mutually contradictory.) Mainly in Algiers, Bejaia, Tizi-Ouzou, Setif and Boumerdes.
**[[Shawiya language|Shawiya]]: 1.4 million (Ethnologue, 1993), equivalent to 5% of the population. Mainly in Batna, Khenchela, Sétif, Souk Ahras, Oum-El-Bouaghi, Tebessa.
:A third group, despite a very small population, accounts for most of the area speaking Berber:
:*[[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] 25,000 in Algeria (Ethnologue, 1987), mainly in the Ahaggar mountains of the Sahara. Most Tuareg live in Mali and Niger (see below).
*'''[[Tunisia]]''': Basset (1952) estimated about 1%, as did Penchoen (1968). According to the Ethnologue, there are only 26,000 speakers (1998) of a Berber language it calls &quot;Djerbi&quot; , but which Tunisians call &quot;Shelha&quot;, in Tunisia, all in the south around [[Djerba]] and [[Matmata]]. The more northerly enclave of [[Sened (town)|Sened]] apparently no longer speaks Berber. This would make 0.3% of the population.
*'''[[Libya]]''': According to the Ethnologue (by deduction from its combined Libyan Arabic and Egyptian Arabic figures) the non-Arabic-speaking population, most of which would be Berber, is estimated at 4% (1991, 1996). However, the individual language figures it gives add up to 162,000, i.e. about 3%. This is mostly accounted for by languages:
**[[Nafusi language]] in Zuwarah and Jabal Nafusa: 141,000 (1998).
**Tahaggart [[Tuareg sub-languages|Tuareg]] of [[Ghat]]: 17,000 (Johnstone 1993).
*'''[[Egypt]]''': The oasis of [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] near the Libyan border speaks a Berber language; according to the Ethnologue, there are 5,000 speakers there (1995). Its population in 1907 was 3884 (according to the 1911 [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]); the claimed lack of increase seems surprising.
*'''[[Mauritania]]''': According to the Ethnologue, only 200-300 speakers of [[Zenaga]] remain (1998). It also mentions [[Tamasheq]], but does not provide a population figure for it. Most non-Arabic speakers in Mauritania speak [[Niger-Congo languages]].
*'''[[Mali]]''': The Ethnologue counts 440,000 [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] (1991) speaking:
::[[Tamasheq]]: 250,000
::[[Tamajaq]]: 190,000
*'''[[Niger]]''': The Ethnologue counts 720,000 [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] (1998) speaking:
::[[Tawallamat Tamajaq]]: 450,000
::[[Tayart Tamajeq]]: 250,000
::[[Tamahaq language]]: 20,000
*'''[[Burkina Faso]]''': The Ethnologue counts 20,000 - 30,000 [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] ([[SIL International|SIL]] 1991), speaking [[Kidal Tamasheq]]. However the Ethnologue is very inaccurate here appearing to miss the largest group of Tamasheq in Burkina in the province of Oudalan. The Tamasheq speaking population of Burkina is nearer to 100,000 (2005), with around 70,000 Tamasheq speakers in the province of Oudalan, the rest mainly in Seno, Soum, Yagha, Yatenga and Kadiogo provinces. About 10% of Burkina Tamasheq speak a version of the Tawallamat dialect.
*'''[[Nigeria]]''': The Ethnologue notes the presence of &quot;few&quot; [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], speaking [[Tawallamat Tamajaq]].
*'''[[France]]''': The Ethnologue lists 860,000 speakers for Riffian and 537,000 speakers for Kabyle, 150,000 for [[Central Morocco Tamazight]], and no figures for Shilha. For the rest of Europe, it has no figures.
*'''[[Spain]]''': A majority of [[Melilla]]'s 80,000 inhabitants, and a minority of [[Ceuta]]'s inhabitants, speak Berber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/document/berber/an/i1/i1.html#1&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Israel]]''': Around two thousand mostly elderly [[Morocco|Moroccan]]-born Israelis of [[Berber Jews|Berber Jewish]] descent use [[Judeo-Berber]] dialects (as opposed to Moroccan Jews who trace descent from [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking [[Sephardi Jews]] [[Alhambra decree|expelled from Spain]], or Arabic-speaking Moroccan Jews).

Thus, judging by the not necessarily reliable Ethnologue, the total number of speakers of Berbersub-  languages in the [[Maghreb]] proper appears to lie anywhere between 16 and 25 million, depending on which estimate is accepted; if we take Basset's estimate, it could be as high as 30 million. The vast majority are concentrated in Morocco and Algeria. The Tuareg of the [[Sahel]] add another million or so.

==Grammar==

[[Noun]]s in the Berber sub-languages vary in [[Grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine versus feminine), in number (singular versus plural) and in state (free state versus construct state). In the case of the masculine, nouns generally begin with one of the three vowels of Berber, ''a'', ''u'' or ''i'' (in standardised orthography, ''e'' represents a schwa [ə] inserted for reasons of pronunciation):
::afus &quot;hand&quot;
::argaz &quot;man&quot;
::udem &quot;face&quot;
::ul &quot;heart&quot;
::ixef &quot;head&quot;
::iles &quot;tongue&quot;

While the masculine is unmarked, the feminine (also used to form [[diminutive]]s and [[singulative]]s, like an ear of wheat) is marked with the [[circumfix]] ''t...t''. Feminine plural takes a prefix ''t...'' :
::afus → tafust
::udem → tudemt
::ixef → tixeft
::ifassen → tifassin

Berber sub-languages have two types of [[Grammatical number|number]]: singular and [[plural]], of which only the latter is marked. Plural has three forms according to the type of nouns. The first, &quot;regular&quot; type is known as the &quot;external plural&quot;; it consists in changing the initial vowel of the noun, and adding a [[suffix]] ''-n'':
::afus → ifassen &quot;hands&quot;
::argaz → irgazen &quot;men&quot;
::ixef → ixfawen &quot;heads&quot;
::ul → ulawen &quot;hearts&quot;
The second form of the plural is known as the &quot;broken plural&quot;. It involves only a change in the vowels of the word:
::adrar → idurar &quot;mountain&quot;
::agadir → igudar &quot;wall / castle&quot;
::abaghus → ibughas &quot;monkey&quot;
The third type of plural is a mixed form: it combines a change of vowels with the suffix ''-n'':&lt;!--Sorry I can't see the difference with the first type! --&gt;
::izi → izan &quot;(the) fly&quot;
::azur → izuran &quot;root&quot;
::iziker → izakaren &quot;rope&quot;

Berber sub-languages also have two types of states or [[grammatical case|cases]] of the [[noun]], organized [[Ergative case|ergatively]]: one is unmarked, while the other serves for the subject of a transitive verb and the object of a preposition, among other contexts. The former is often called ''free state'', the latter ''construct state''. The construct state of the noun derives from the free state through one of the following rules:
The first involves a vowel alternation, whereby the vowel ''a'' becomes ''u'' :
::argaz → urgaz
::amghar → umghar
::adrar → udrar
The second involves the loss of the initial vowel, in the case of some feminine nouns:
::tamghart → temghart &quot;woman / mature woman&quot;
::tamdint → temdint &quot;town&quot;
::tarbat → terbat &quot;girl&quot;
The third involves the addition of a semi-vowel (''w'' or ''y'') word-initially:
::asif → '''w'''asif &quot;river&quot;
::aḍu → '''w'''aḍu &quot;wind&quot;
::iles → '''y'''iles &quot;tongue&quot;
::uccen → '''w'''uccen &quot;wolf&quot;
Finally, some nouns do not change for free state:
::taddart → taddart &quot;house / village&quot;
::tuccent → tuccent &quot;female wolf&quot;

The following table gives the forms for the noun ''amghar'' &quot;old man / leader&quot;:

==Subclassification==
[[Image:Berber-map.png|right|450px|thumb|Modern Berber sub-Languages]]
Subclassification of the Berber sub-languages is made difficult by their mutual closeness; [[Maarten Kossmann]] (1999) describes it as two [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]], [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]] and [[Tuareg sub-languages|Tuareg]], and a few peripheral languages, spoken in isolated pockets largely surrounded by [[Arabic language|Arabic]], that fall outside these continua, namely [[Zenaga]] and the [[Libya]]n and [[Egypt]]ian varieties. Within Northern Berber, however, he recognizes a break in the continuum between [[Zenati sub-languages]] and their non-Zenati neighbors; and in the east, he recognizes a division between [[Ghadames language|Ghadames]] and [[Awjila language|Awjila]] on the one hand and [[Sokna language|Sokna]] ([[Al Fuqahā', Libya|Al Fuqahā']]), [[Siwa language|Siwa]], and [[Nafusi language|Djebel Nefusa]] on the other. The implied tree is:

*[[Nafusi language|Nafusi]]-[[Siwi language|Siwi]] languages (including Sokna)
*[[Ghadames language|Ghadames]]-[[Awjila language|Awjila]] languages
*[[Northern Berber sub-languages]]
**[[Zenati sub-languages]] (including Riff)
**[[Kabyle language]]
**[[Atlas sub-languages]]
*[[Tuareg sub-languages]]
*[[Zenaga sub-language]]

There is so little data available on [[Guanche language|Guanche]] that any classification is necessarily uncertain; however, it is almost universally acknowledged as Afro-Asiatic on the basis of the surviving glosses, and widely suspected to be Berber. Much the same can be said of the language, sometimes called &quot;Numidian&quot;, used in the Libyan or Libyco-Berber inscriptions around the turn of the Common Era, whose alphabet is the ancestor of [[Tifinagh]].

The Ethnologue, mostly following Aikhenvald and Militarev (1991), treats the eastern varieties differently:
*[[Guanche language|Guanche]]
*[[Eastern Berber languages]]
**[[Siwi language|Siwi]]
**[[Awjila-Sokna languages]]
*[[Northern Berber languages]]
**[[Zenati languages|Zenati]] (including Riff,Figuig, Nafusi, and Ghadames)
**[[Kabyle language]]
**[[Chenoua language]]
**[[Atlas languages]]
*[[Tuareg languages]]
*[[Zenaga language]]

==Influence on other languages==

The Berber languages have influenced Maghrib Arabic dialects, such as [[Moroccan Arabic]]. Their influence is also seen in some languages in subsaharan Africa. F.W.H.Migeod &lt;ref&gt;Migeod, F.W.H., ''The Languages of West Africa''. Kegan, Paul, Trench &amp; Trübner, London 1913. pages 232, 233.&lt;/ref&gt; pointed to strong resemblances between Berber and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] in such words and phrases as these: Berber: '''ya mut'''; Hausa ''ya mutu'' (he died); Berber: '''obanis'''; Hausa ''obansa'' (his father); Berber: '''a bat'''; Hausa ''ya bata'' (he was lost); Berber: '''eghare'''; Hausa ''ya kirra'' (he called). In addition he notes that the genitive in both languages is formed with '''n''' = &quot;of&quot;.

'''Bankruptcy''' or '''insolvency''' is a legal status of a person or an organisation that cannot repay the debts it owes to its [[creditors]]. Creditors may file a bankruptcy petition against a business or corporate [[debtor]] (&quot;involuntary bankruptcy&quot;) in an effort to recoup a portion of what they are owed or initiate a [[restructuring]]. In the majority of cases, however, bankruptcy is initiated by the debtor (a &quot;voluntary bankruptcy&quot; that is filed by the [[Insolvency|insolvent]] individual or organisation).  An involuntary bankruptcy petition may not be filed against an individual consumer debtor who is not engaged in business.

The word bankruptcy is formed from the ancient [[Latin]] ''bancus'' (a bench or table), and ''ruptus'' (broken). A &quot;[[bank]]&quot; originally referred to a bench, which the first [[banker]]s had in the public places, in markets, fairs, etc. on which they tolled their money, wrote their [[Negotiable instrument|bills of exchange]], etc. Hence, when a banker failed, he broke his bank, to advertise to the public that the person to whom the bank belonged was no longer in a condition to continue his business. As this practice was very frequent in [[Italy]], it is said the term bankrupt is derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''banca rotta'', broken bank (''see e.g. [[Ponte Vecchio]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=iqE9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of bankruptcy law}}
In [[Ancient Greece]], bankruptcy did not exist. If a man owed and he could not pay, he and his wife, children or servants were forced into &quot;[[debt slavery]]&quot;, until the creditor recouped losses via their [[Manual labour|physical labour]]. Many city-states in ancient Greece limited debt slavery to a period of five years and debt slaves had protection of life and limb, which regular slaves did not enjoy. However, servants of the debtor could be retained beyond that [[time limit|deadline]] by the creditor and were often forced to serve their new lord for a lifetime, usually under significantly harsher conditions.

In the [[Torah]], or [[Old Testament]], every seventh year is decreed by [[613 Commandments|Mosaic Law]] as a [[Sabbatical year]] wherein the release of all debts that are owed by members of the community is [[Mandate (theology)|mandate]]d, but not of &quot;foreigners&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0515.htm#1 Deuteronomy 15:1–3]&lt;/ref&gt; The seventh Sabbatical year, or forty-ninth year, is then followed by another Sabbatical year known as the [[Jubilee (Biblical)|Year of Jubilee]] wherein the release of all debts is mandated, for fellow community members and foreigners alike, and the release of all debt-slaves is also mandated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0325.htm#8 Leviticus 25:8–54]&lt;/ref&gt; The Year of Jubilee is announced in advance on the [[Day of Atonement]], or the tenth day of the seventh [[Hebrew calendar|Biblical month]], in the forty-ninth year by the blowing of trumpets throughout the land of Israel.

In [[Islamic]] teaching, according to the [[Qur'an]], an insolvent person was deemed to be allowed time to be able to pay out his debt. This is recorded in the Qur'an's second chapter ([[Sura]] [[Al-Baqara]]), Verse 280, which notes: &quot;And if someone is in hardship, then let there be postponement until a time of ease. But if you give from your right as charity, then it is better for you, if you only knew.&quot;

Bankruptcy is also documented in [[East Asia]]. According to [[al-Maqrizi]], the [[Yassa]] of [[Genghis Khan]] contained a provision that mandated the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for anyone who became bankrupt three times. [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] had to declare four state bankruptcies in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. Spain became the first [[sovereign nation]] in history to declare bankruptcy.

==Modern law and debt restructuring==
The principal focus of modern insolvency legislation and business [[debt restructuring]] practices no longer rests on the elimination of insolvent entities but on the remodeling of the financial and organisational structure of debtors experiencing [[financial distress]] so as to permit the rehabilitation and continuation of their business.

For private households, it is argued to be insufficient to merely dismiss debts after a certain period. It is important to assess the underlying problems and to minimise the risk of financial distress to re-occur. It has been stressed that debt advice, a supervised rehabilitation period, financial education and social help to find sources of income and to manage household expenditures better need to be equally provided during this period of rehabilitation (Reifner ''et al.'', 2003; Gerhardt, 2009; Frade, 2010). In most EU Member States, debt discharge is conditioned by a partial payment obligation and by a number of requirements concerning the debtor’s behavior. In the United States (US), discharge is conditioned to a lesser extent. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the spectrum is broad in the EU, with the UK coming closest to the US system (Reifner ''et al.'', 2003; Gerhardt, 2009; Frade, 2010). Other Member States do not provide the option of a debt discharge. Spain, for example, passed a bankruptcy law (ley concursal) in 2003 which provides for debt settlement plans that can result in a reduction of the debt (maximally half of the amount) or an extension of the payment period of maximally five years (Gerhardt, 2009); nevertheless, it does not foresee debt discharge.&lt;ref&gt;Dubois &amp; Anderson (2010) Managing household debts: Social service provision in the EU. Working paper. Dublin: European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.  http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/socialprotection/householdebts.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fraud==
Bankruptcy [[fraud]] is a [[white-collar crime]]. While difficult to generalise across jurisdictions, common criminal acts under bankruptcy statutes typically involve concealment of assets, concealment or destruction of documents, conflicts of interest, fraudulent claims, false statements or declarations, and [[Fee fixing scandal|fee fixing]] or redistribution arrangements. Falsifications on bankruptcy forms often constitute [[perjury]]. Multiple filings are not in and of themselves criminal, but they may violate provisions of bankruptcy law. In the U.S., bankruptcy fraud statutes are particularly focused on the [[Mens rea|mental state]] of particular actions.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 140 Cong. Rec. S14, 461 (daily ed. Oct. 6, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 18 U.S.C. sec 152. http://trac.syr.edu/laws/18USC152.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Bankruptcy fraud is a [[federal crime]] in the United States.

Bankruptcy fraud should be distinguished from ''[[strategic bankruptcy]]'', which is not a [[crime|criminal]] act, but may work against the filer.

All assets must be disclosed in bankruptcy schedules whether or not the debtor believes the asset has a [[net value]].  This is because once a bankruptcy petition is filed, it is for the creditors, not the debtor to decide whether a particular asset has value.  The future ramifications of omitting assets from schedules can be quite serious for the offending debtor.  A closed bankruptcy may be reopened by motion of a creditor or the U.S. trustee if a debtor attempts to later assert ownership of such an &quot;unscheduled asset&quot; after being discharged of all debt in the bankruptcy.  The trustee may then seize the asset and liquidate it for the benefit of the (formerly discharged) creditors.  Whether or not a concealment of such an asset should also be considered for prosecution as fraud and/or [[perjury]] would then be at the discretion of the judge and/or U.S. Trustee.

==In individual countries==
=== Australia===
The ''Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Commonwealth)'' is the legislation that governs bankruptcy in [[Australia]]. Only individuals can become bankrupt; insolvent companies go into [[liquidation]] or administration (see [[administration (insolvency)]]). There are three &quot;parts&quot; of the act under which the vast majority of &quot;acts of bankruptcy&quot; fall. Part IV (Full Bankruptcy), Part IX Debt Agreements and Part X Personal Insolvency Agreements. Agreements refer specifically to arrangements between creditors and debtors, whereas Part IV relates to full bankruptcy and is generally synonymous with &quot;bankruptcy&quot;.

A person or debtor can declare himself or herself bankrupt by lodging a debtor's petition with the Official Receiver, which is the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (ITSA). A person can also be made bankrupt after a creditor's petition results in the making of a [[Sequestration (law)|sequestration order]] in the [[Federal Magistrates Court]]. To declare bankruptcy or for a creditors petition to be lodged, a minimum debt of $5,000 is required.

All bankrupts are required to lodge a Statement of Affairs document with ITSA, which includes important information about their assets and liabilities. A bankruptcy cannot be annulled until this document has been lodged.

Ordinarily, a Part IV bankruptcy lasts three years from the filing of the Statement of Affairs with ITSA. In the case of a debtor's petition, the Statement of Affairs is filed with the petition and the three year period commences immediately. However, in the case of a creditor's petition, the Statement of Affairs will rarely be filed on the same day the court order is made. If the bankrupt fails to lodge the document within a certain period of time, he or she can be prosecuted and fined.

A Bankruptcy Trustee (in most cases this is the Official Receiver) is appointed to deal with all matters regarding the administration of the bankrupt estate. The Trustee's job includes notifying creditors of the estate and dealing with creditor inquiries; ensuring that the bankrupt complies with his or her obligations under the ''Bankruptcy Act''; investigating the bankrupt's financial affairs; realising funds to which the estate is entitled under the ''Bankruptcy Act'' and distributing dividends to creditors if sufficient funds become available.

For the duration of their bankruptcy, all bankrupts have certain restrictions placed upon them under the Act. For example, a bankrupt must obtain the permission of his or her trustee to travel overseas. Failure to do so may result in the bankrupt being stopped at the airport by the Australian Federal Police. Additionally, a bankrupt is required to provide his or her Trustee with details of income and assets. If the bankrupt does not comply with the Trustee's request to provide details of income, the Trustee may have grounds to lodge an Objection to Discharge, which has the effect of extending the bankruptcy for a further five years.

The realisation of funds usually comes from two main sources: the bankrupt's assets and the bankrupt's wages. There are certain assets that are protected, referred to as &quot;protected assets&quot;. These include household furniture and appliances, tools of the trade and vehicles up to a certain value. All other assets of value will be sold. If a house or car is above a certain value, the bankrupt can buy the interest back from the estate in order to keep the asset. If the bankrupt does not do this, the interest vests in the estate and the trustee is able to take possession of the asset and sell it.

The bankrupt will have to pay income contributions if his or her income is above a certain threshold. The threshold is indexed biannually in March and September, and varies according to the number of dependents the bankrupt has. The income contributions liability is calculated by halving the amount of income that exceeds the threshold. If the bankrupt fails to pay the contributions due, the Trustee can issue a notice to garnishee the bankrupt's wages. If that is not possible, the Trustee may lodge an Objection to Discharge, effectively extending the bankruptcy for a further five years.

Bankruptcies can be annulled prior to the expiration of the normal three year period if all debts are paid out in full. Sometimes a bankrupt may be able to raise enough funds to make an Offer of Composition to creditors, which would have the effect of paying the creditors some of the money they are owed. If the creditors accept the offer, the bankruptcy can be annulled after the funds are received.

After the bankruptcy is annulled or the bankrupt has been automatically discharged, the bankrupt's credit report status will be shown as &quot;discharged bankrupt&quot; for some years. The number of years varies depending on the company issuing the report, but the report will eventually cease to record that information.

Certain limited information on Bankruptcy Law in Australia can be found at the ITSA web site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsa.gov.au/ ITSA]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
{{Cleanup|section|date=June 2009}}
In Brazil, the Bankruptcy Law (11.101/05) disciplines judicial or extrajudicial recuperation &amp; Bankruptcy and is only applicable to private companies, except for financial institutions, credit cooperatives, consortia, entity of supplementary schemes, societies operating health care plan, society of capitalisation and other entities legally treated as issues. This is not applicable to public companies.

Current law covers three legal proceedings. The first one is bankruptcy itself (&quot;Falência&quot;). Bankruptcy is the judicial liquidation procedure for an insolvent merchant that promotes the removal of the debtor from its activities, aiming to preserve and optimise productive use of assets, assets and productive resources, including intangible assets, of the company. The final goal of bankruptcy is to liquidate company assets and debtors payment.

The second one concerns Judicial Recuperation (&quot;Recuperação Judicial&quot;). Its goal is to allow the overcoming of the economic-financial crisis situation of the debtor, in order to allow the continuation of the source producer, the employment of workers and the interests of creditors, promoting, thus, the preservation of the company, its social function and stimulate the economic activity. It's a judiciary procedure required by the debtor who exercice its activities more than 2 years and have to be approval by the judge.

The Extrajudicial Recuperation (&quot;Recuperação Extrajudicial&quot;) is a private negotiation that involves creditors and debtors and, as the judicial recuperation, also have to be approved by Judiciary power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2004-2006/2005/Lei/L11101.htm BRAZIL. Law 11,105/05.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main|Bankruptcy in Canada}}
Bankruptcy in Canada is set out by [[Canadian law|federal law]], in the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada)|Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]] and is applicable to businesses and individuals. The office of the [[Superintendent of Bankruptcy]], a [[federal government of Canada|federal agency]], is responsible for ensuring that bankruptcies are administered in a fair and orderly manner. [[Trustee in bankruptcy|Trustees in bankruptcy]] administer bankruptcy estates.

Bankruptcy is filed when a person or a company becomes insolvent and cannot pay their debts as they become due.

====Duties of trustees====
Some of the duties of the trustee in bankruptcy are to:

* Review the file for any fraudulent preferences or reviewable transactions
* Chair meetings of creditors
* Sell any non-exempt assets
* Object to the bankrupt's discharge
* Distribute funds to creditors

====Creditors' meetings====
Creditors become involved by attending creditors' meetings.  The [[trustee]] calls the first meeting of creditors for the following purposes:

* To consider the affairs of the bankrupt
* To affirm the appointment of the trustee or substitute another in place thereof
* To appoint inspectors
* To give such directions to the trustee as the creditors may see fit with reference to the administration of the estate.

====Consumer proposals in Canada====
In Canada, a person can file a consumer proposal as an alternative to bankruptcy. A consumer proposal is a negotiated settlement between a debtor and their creditors.

A typical proposal would involve a debtor making monthly payments for a maximum of five years, with the funds distributed to their creditors.  Even though most proposals call for payments of less than the full amount of the debt owing, in most cases, the creditors will accept the deal, because if they do not, the next alternative may be personal bankruptcy, where the creditors will get even less money. The creditors have 45 days to accept or reject the consumer proposal. Once the proposal is accepted the debtor makes the payments to the Proposal Administrator each month (or as otherwise stipulated in their proposal), and the creditors are prevented from taking any further legal or collection action. If the proposal is rejected, the debtor is returned to his prior insolvent state and may have no alternative but to declare personal bankruptcy.

A consumer proposal can only be made by a debtor with debts to a maximum of $250,000 (not including the mortgage on their principal residence). If debts are greater than $250,000, the proposal must be filed under Division 1 of Part III of the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada)|Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]. The assistance of a Proposal Administrator is required.  A Proposal Administrator is generally a licensed [[trustee]] in bankruptcy, although the [[Superintendent of Bankruptcy]] may appoint other people to serve as administrators.

In 2006, there were 98,450 personal insolvency filings in Canada: 79,218 bankruptcies and 19,232 consumer proposals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/en/br01702e.html &quot;Insolvency in Canada in 2006&quot;]: Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy ([[Industry Canada]]).  Retrieved 2007-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{Main|China bankruptcy law}}
{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}

===India===
India does not have a clear law on corporate bankruptcy even though individual bankruptcy laws have been in existence since 1874. The current law in force was enacted in 1920 called Provincial Insolvency Act.

Legal meaning of the terms bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation and dissolution are contested in the Indian legal system. There is no regulation or statute legislated upon bankruptcy which denotes a condition of inability to meet a demand of a creditor as is common in many other jurisdictions.

Winding up of companies is in the jurisdiction of the Courts which can take a decade even after the Company has actually been declared
insolvent. On the other hand, supervisory restructuring at the behest of The Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction is generally undertaken using receivership by a Public Finance Institution.

===Japan===
See [[Dirty thirty (Japan)]]

===The Netherlands===
The Dutch bankruptcy law is governed by the Dutch Bankruptcy Code (&quot;Faillissementswet&quot;). The code covers three separate legal proceedings. The first is the bankruptcy (&quot;Faillissement&quot;). The goal of the bankruptcy is the liquidation of the assets of the company. The bankruptcy applies to individuals and companies. The second legal proceeding in the Faillissementswet is the &quot;Surseance&quot;. The Surseance only applies to companies. Its goal is to reach an agreement with the creditors of the company. The third proceeding is the &quot;Schuldsanering&quot;. This proceeding is designed for individuals only.

===Switzerland===
{{Main|Insolvency law of Switzerland}}
Under [[Switzerland|Swiss]] law, bankruptcy can be a consequence of [[insolvency]]. It is a court-ordered form of debt enforcement proceedings that applies, in general, to registered commercial entities only. In a bankruptcy, all assets of the debtor are liquidated under the administration of the creditors, although the law provides for debt restructuring options similar to those under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, bankruptcy (Swedish: konkurs) is a process that may involve a company or individual. A creditor or the company itself can apply for bankruptcy. An external bankruptcy manager will take over the company or the assests of the person, trying to sell as much as possible. A person or a company in bankruptcy can not access its assets (with some exceptions). It is common for companies in Sweden to reduce their debts through bankruptcy. The owner, or a new owner, starts a new company that buys the important assets including the name from the old company, which is left behind with its debts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The formal bankruptcy process is rarely carried out for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skatteverket.se/konkurs/vadarkonkurs.4.14db52b102ed4e5fe380002973.html Konkurs – Vad är konkurs? {{sv}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Creditors can claim money through the [[Enforcement Administration (Sweden)|Enforcement Administration]] anyway, and creditors do not usually benefit from the bankruptcy of individuals because there are costs of a bankruptcy manager which has priority. Unpaid debts remain after bankruptcy for individuals. People who are deeply in debt can obtain a debt arrangement procedure (Swedish:skuldsanering). On application, they obtain a payment plan under which they pay as much as they can for five years, and then all remaining debts are canceled. The debts must not have come from crime victim compensation and the deptor must not be forbidden to run a company (usually happens because of tax fraud). This process was introduced in 2006. Before that, all unpaid debts remained during the life of a person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fattiga.se/news.php?item.51.6 Evighetsgäldenärer, synpunkter från Skatteverket 2004 Skatteverkets skrivelse 041229 {{sv}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The most common reasons for personal insolvency in Sweden are illness, unemployment, divorce or company bankruptcy, not reckless spending.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insolvens.se/&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|UK insolvency law|Bankruptcy in the United Kingdom|Liquidation|Administration (insolvency)}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], bankruptcy (in a strict legal sense) relates only to individuals (including [[Sole Trader Insolvency|sole proprietors]]) and [[partnerships]]. Companies and other [[corporations]] enter into differently-named legal insolvency procedures: [[liquidation]] and [[administration (law)|administration]] ([[administration order]] and [[administrative receivership]]). However, the term 'bankruptcy' is often used when referring to companies in the media and in general conversation. Bankruptcy in Scotland is referred to as [[sequestration (law)|sequestration]]. To apply for your own bankruptcy in Scotland you must have more than £1500 of debt.

A [[trustee in bankruptcy]] must be either an [[Official Receiver]] (a civil servant) or a licensed [[insolvency practitioner]]. Current law in England and Wales derives in large part from the [[Insolvency Act 1986]].  Following the introduction of the [[Enterprise Act 2002]], a UK bankruptcy will now normally last no longer than 12 months and may be less, if the Official Receiver files in court a certificate that his investigations are complete. It was expected that the UK Government's liberalisation of the UK bankruptcy regime would increase the number of bankruptcy cases; the Insolvency Service statistics appear to bear this out:

After the increase in 2005 and 2006 the figures have remained stable.

====Bankruptcy and Pensions in the UK====
The UK bankruptcy law was changed in May 2000, effective May 29, 2000. Debtors may now retain occupational [[pensions]] while in bankruptcy, except in rare cases.

===United States===
{{Main|Bankruptcy in the United States}}

Bankruptcy in the United States is a matter placed under [[United States federal law|Federal jurisdiction]] by the [[United States Constitution]] (in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 4), which allows [[United States Congress|Congress]] to enact &quot;uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States.&quot; The Congress has enacted [[statute law]] governing bankruptcy, primarily in the form of the '''Bankruptcy Code''', located at Title 11 of the [[United States Code]]. Federal law is amplified by state law in some places where Federal law fails to speak or expressly defers to state law.

While bankruptcy cases are always filed in [[United States Bankruptcy Court]] (an adjunct to the [[U.S. District Courts]]), bankruptcy cases, particularly with respect to the validity of claims and exemptions, are often dependent upon State law. State law therefore plays a major role in many bankruptcy cases, and it is often not possible to generalise bankruptcy law across state lines.

Generally, a debtor declares bankruptcy to obtain relief from debt, and this is accomplished either through a discharge of the debt or through a restructuring of the debt.  Generally, when a debtor files a voluntary petition, his or her bankruptcy case commences.

====Chapters====
There are six types of bankruptcy under the [[Bankruptcy Code]], located at Title 11 of the [[United States Code]]:
*[[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]]: basic liquidation for individuals and businesses; also known as straight bankruptcy; it is the simplest and quickest form of bankruptcy available
*[[Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 9]]: municipal bankruptcy; a federal mechanism for the resolution of municipal debts
*[[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]]: rehabilitation or reorganisation, used primarily by business debtors, but sometimes by individuals with substantial debts and assets; known as corporate bankruptcy, it is a form of corporate financial reorganisation which typically allows companies to continue to function while they follow debt repayment plans
*[[Chapter 12, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 12]]: rehabilitation for family farmers and fishermen;
*[[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]]: rehabilitation with a payment plan for individuals with a regular source of income; enables individuals with regular income to develop a plan to repay all or part of their debts; also known as Wage Earner Bankruptcy
*[[Chapter 15, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 15]]: ancillary and other international cases;  provides a mechanism for dealing with bankruptcy debtors and helps foreign debtors to clear debts.

The most common types of personal bankruptcy for individuals are Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. As much as 65% of all U.S. consumer bankruptcy filings are Chapter 7 cases. Corporations and other business forms file under Chapters 7 or 11.

In Chapter 7, a debtor surrenders his or her non-exempt property to a bankruptcy trustee who then liquidates the property and distributes the proceeds to the debtor's unsecured creditors.  In exchange, the debtor is entitled to a discharge of some debt; however, the debtor will not be granted a discharge if he or she is guilty of certain types of inappropriate behavior (e.g. concealing records relating to financial condition) and certain debts (e.g. spousal and child support, student loans, some taxes) will not be discharged even though the debtor is generally discharged from his or her debt.  Many individuals in financial distress own only exempt property (e.g. clothes, household goods, an older car) and will not have to surrender any property to the trustee.  The amount of property that a debtor may exempt varies from state to state.  Chapter 7 relief is available only once in any eight year period.  Generally, the rights of secured creditors to their collateral continues even though their debt is discharged. For example, absent some arrangement by a debtor to surrender a car or &quot;reaffirm&quot; a debt, the creditor with a [[security interest]] in the debtor's car may repossess the car even if the debt to the creditor is discharged.

The 2005 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code introduced the &quot;means test&quot; for eligibility for chapter 7. An individual who fails the means test will have his or her chapter 7 case dismissed or may have to convert his or her case to a case under chapter 13.

Generally, a trustee will sell most of the debtor’s assets to pay off creditors.  However, certain assets of the debtor are protected to some extent.  For example, Social Security payments, unemployment compensation, and limited values of your equity in a home, car, or truck, household goods and appliances, trade tools, and books are protected. However, these exemptions vary from state to state.  

In Chapter 13, the debtor retains ownership and possession of all of his or her assets, but must devote some portion of his or her future income to repaying creditors, generally over a period of three to five years.  The amount of payment and the period of the repayment plan depend upon a variety of factors, including the value of the debtor's property and the amount of a debtor's income and expenses.  Secured creditors may be entitled to greater payment than unsecured creditors.

Relief under Chapter 13 is available only to individuals with regular income whose debts do not exceed prescribed limits.  If you are an individual or a sole proprietor, you are allowed to file for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to repay all or part of your debts.  Under this chapter, you can propose a repayment plan in which to pay your creditors over three to five years.  If your monthly income is less than the state's median income, your plan will be for three years unless the court finds &quot;just cause&quot; to extend the plan for a longer period. If your monthly income is greater than your state's median income, the plan must generally be for five years. A plan cannot exceed the five-year limitation.

In contrast to Chapter 7, the debtor in Chapter 13 may keep all of his or her property, whether or not exempt.  If the plan appears feasible and if the debtor complies with all the other requirements, the bankruptcy court will typically confirm the plan and the debtor and creditors will be bound by its terms.  Creditors have no say in the formulation of the plan other than to object to the plan, if appropriate, on the grounds that it does not comply with one of the Code's statutory requirements.  Generally, the payments are made to a trustee who in turn disburses the funds in accordance with the terms of the confirmed plan.

When the debtor completes payments pursuant to the terms of the plan, the court will formally grant the debtor a discharge of the debts provided for in the plan.  However, if the debtor fails to make the agreed upon payments or fails to seek or gain court approval of a modified plan, a bankruptcy court will often dismiss the case on the motion of the trustee.  Pursuant to the dismissal, creditors will typically resume pursuit of state law remedies to the extent a debt remains unpaid.

In Chapter 11, the debtor retains ownership and control of its assets and is re-termed a ''debtor in possession'' (&quot;DIP&quot;). The debtor in possession runs the day to day operations of the business while creditors and the debtor work with the Bankruptcy Court in order to negotiate and complete a plan. Upon meeting certain requirements (''e.g.'' fairness among creditors, priority of certain creditors) creditors are permitted to vote on the proposed plan. If a plan is confirmed the debtor will continue to operate and pay its debts under the terms of the confirmed plan. If a specified majority of creditors do not vote to confirm a plan, additional requirements may be imposed by the court in order to confirm the plan.

Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 are the efficient bankruptcy chapters often used by most individuals. The chapters which almost always apply to consumer debtors are chapter 7, known as a &quot;straight bankruptcy&quot;, and chapter 13, which involves an affordable plan of repayment. An important feature applicable to all types of bankruptcy filings is the automatic stay. The automatic stay means that the mere request for bankruptcy protection automatically stops and brings to a grinding halt most lawsuits, repossessions, foreclosures, evictions, garnishments, attachments, utility shut-offs, and debt collection activity.

====Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA)====
{{Main|Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act}}
The [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act]] of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (April 20, 2005) (&quot;BAPCPA&quot;), substantially amended the Bankruptcy Code.  Many provisions of BAPCPA were forcefully advocated by consumer lenders and were just as forcefully opposed by many consumer advocates, bankruptcy academics, bankruptcy judges, and bankruptcy lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=1381 &quot;Hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Bankruptcy Reform&quot;], 109th Cong. February 10, 2005.  Retrieved July 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The enactment of BAPCPA followed nearly eight years of debate in Congress. Most of the law's provisions became effective on October 17, 2005.  Upon signing the bill, then President Bush stated:

{{quote|Under the new law, Americans who have the ability to pay will be required to pay back at least a portion of their debts. Those who fall behind their state's median income will not be required to pay back their debts. The new law will also make it more difficult for serial filers to abuse the most generous bankruptcy protections. Debtors seeking to erase all debts will now have to wait eight years from their last bankruptcy before they can file again. The law will also allow us to clamp down on bankruptcy mills that make their money by advising abusers on how to game the system.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release, White House, [http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/04/20050420-5.html &quot;President Signs Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention, Consumer Protection Act&quot;] (April 20, 2005).  Retrieved July 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among its many changes to consumer bankruptcy law, BAPCPA enacted a &quot;means test&quot;, which was intended to make it more difficult for a significant number of financially distressed individual debtors whose debts are primarily consumer debts to qualify for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The &quot;means test&quot; is employed in cases where an individual with primarily consumer debts has more than the average annual income for a household of equivalent size, computed over a 180 day period prior to filing.  If the individual must &quot;take&quot; the &quot;means test&quot;, their average monthly income over this 180 day period is reduced by a series of allowances for living expenses and secured debt payments in a very complex calculation that may or may not accurately reflect that individual's actual monthly budget. If the results of the means test show no disposable income(or in some cases a very small amount) then the individual qualifies for Chapter 7 relief.  If a debtor does not qualify for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, either because of the Means Test or because Chapter 7 does not provide a permanent solution to delinquent payments for secured debts, such as mortgages or vehicle loans, the debtor may still seek relief under Chapter 13 of the Code.  A Chapter 13 plan often does not require repayment to general unsecured debts,  such as credit cards or medical bills.

BAPCPA also requires individuals seeking bankruptcy relief to undertake [[credit counseling]] with approved counseling agencies prior to filing a bankruptcy petition and to undertake education in personal financial management from approved agencies prior to being granted a discharge of debts under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13.  Some studies of the operation of the credit counseling requirement suggest that it provides little benefit to debtors who receive the counseling because the only realistic option for many is to seek relief under the Bankruptcy Code.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Europe in general===
{{Ref improve section|date=May 2007}}
During 2004, the number of insolvencies reached all time highs in many European countries. In [[France]], company insolvencies rose by more than 4%, in [[Austria]] by more than 10%, and in [[Greece]] by more than 20%. The increase in the number of insolvencies, however, does not indicate the total financial impact of insolvencies in each country because there is no indication of the size of each case. An increase in the number of bankruptcy cases does not necessarily entail an increase in bad debt write-off rates for the economy as a whole.

Bankruptcy statistics are also a trailing indicator. There is a time delay between financial difficulties and bankruptcy. In most cases, several months or even years pass between the financial problems and the start of bankruptcy proceedings. Legal, tax, and cultural issues may further distort bankruptcy figures, especially when comparing on an international basis. Two examples:

* In [[Austria]], more than half of all potential bankruptcy proceedings in 2004 were not opened, due to insufficient funding.
* In [[Spain]], it is not economically profitable to open insolvency/bankruptcy proceedings against certain types of businesses, and therefore the number of insolvencies is quite low. For comparison: In [[France]], more than 40,000 insolvency proceedings were opened in 2004, but under 600 were opened in Spain.  At the same time the average bad debt write-off rate in France was 1.3% compared to Spain with 2.6%.

The insolvency numbers for private individuals also do not show the whole picture. Only a fraction of heavily indebted households will decide to file for insolvency. Two of the main reasons for this are the stigma of declaring themselves insolvent and the potential business disadvantage.

'''Blissymbols''' or '''Blissymbolics''' were conceived of as an [[ideographic]] [[writing system]] consisting of several hundred basic [[symbol]]s, each representing a concept, which can be composed together to generate new symbols that represent new concepts. Blissymbols differ from most of the world's major writing systems in that the characters do not correspond at all to the sounds of any [[spoken language]]. In this it is like other similar [[constructed language]]s such as [[Zlango]], [[Isotype (picture language)|Isotype]], or [[Characteristica universalis]].

==Overview==
They were invented by [[Charles K. Bliss]] (1897–1985) after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Bliss wanted to create an easy-to-learn [[international auxiliary language]] to allow [[communication]] between people who do not speak the same language. He was inspired by [[Chinese character]]s (which are actually [[logogram]]s rather than [[ideogram]]s), with which Bliss became familiar while in the [[Shanghai Ghetto]] as a refugee from [[Nazism|Nazi]] anti-semitic persecution. His system ''World Writing'' was explained in his work ''Semantography'' (1949). This work laid out the language structure and vocabulary for his utopian vision of easy communication, but it failed to gain popularity.

However, since the 1960s, Blissymbols have become popular as a method of [[augmentative and alternative communication]] (AAC) for non-speaking people with [[cerebral palsy]] or other disorders, for whom it can be impossible to otherwise communicate with spoken language. However, Bliss did not approve of his language being used as an AAC; he sued the celebral palsy centers who employed it in this way, and they settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;Arika Okrent, ''In the land of invented languages''. pp. 175-176.&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners of Blissymbolics (that is, speech and language therapists and users) maintain that some users who have learned to communicate with Blissymbolics find it easier to learn to read and write traditional orthography in the local spoken language than do users who did not know Blissymbolics.

Whether Blissymbolics constitutes an unspoken language, whatever its practical utility may be, is a controversial question.  Some linguists, such as [[John DeFrancis]] (''The Chinese Language'' 1984, ''Visible Speech'' 1989) and [[J. Marshall Unger]] (''Ideogram'' 2004) have argued that genuine ideographic writing systems with the same capacities as [[natural language]]s do not exist.

== Examples ==
An example sentence in Blissymbolics is,

[[Image:Bliss_cinema.png|&quot;I want to go to the cinema.&quot; in blissymbols]]

which means &quot;I want to go to the cinema.&quot; This example shows several features of Blissymbolics:
* The pronoun &quot;I&quot; is formed of the symbol for &quot;person&quot; and the number 1 (the first person). Using the number 2 would give the symbol for singular &quot;You&quot;; adding the plural indicator (a small cross at the top) would produce the pronouns &quot;We&quot; and plural &quot;You&quot;.
* The symbol for &quot;to want&quot; contains the heart which symbolizes feeling and the verb indicator at the top.
* The symbol for &quot;to go&quot; is composed of the leg symbol and the verb indicator.
* The symbol for &quot;movie theater&quot; is composed of the symbols for &quot;house&quot; and &quot;film&quot;; &quot;film&quot; in turn is composed of &quot;camera&quot; and the arrow.

Another sentence (not in the standardized Blissymbols used with disabled users): 

[[File:Wantwar.JPG]]

which means &quot;If they want war then that is what they shall have.&quot;
* A small box stands for &quot;thing&quot;; the box with a question mark stands for &quot;what&quot;.
* The final symbol shows the future indicator on top, to turn &quot;have&quot; into &quot;shall have&quot;.

== Maintenance of the language and of the script ==
[[File:Blissymbols Bliss.png|frame|The symbol for &quot;Blissymbols&quot; combines symbols for &quot;world&quot; and &quot;writing&quot;.]]
Blissymbolics was first used in 1971 to help children at the Ontario Crippled Children’s Centre (OCCC, now the [[Bloorview Kids Rehab]]) in [[Toronto]], Canada. Since it was important that the children see consistent pictures, OCCC had a draftsman named Jim Grice draw the symbols. Both Charles K. Bliss and Margrit Beesley at the OCCC worked with Grice to ensure consistency. In 1975, a new organization named Blissymbolics Communication Foundation directed by Shirley McNaughton led this effort. Over the years, this organization changed its name to Blissymbolics Communication Institute, [[Easter Seal]] Communication Institute, and ultimately to Blissymbolics Communication International (BCI).

Blissymbolics Communication International is an international group of people who act as an authority regarding the [[standardization]] of the Blissymbolics language. It has taken responsibility for any extensions of the Blissymbolics language as well as any maintenance needed for the language. BCI has coordinated usage of the language since 1971 for augmentative and alternative communication. BCI received a licence and copyright through legal agreements with Charles K. Bliss in 1975 and 1982.  Limiting the count of Bliss-characters (there are currently about 900) is very useful to help the user community. It also helps when implementing Blissymbolics using technology such as computers.

== International standardization of the language and of the script ==
In 1991, BCI published a ''Blissymbol Reference Guide'' (Wood, Star, Reich) containing 2300 vocabulary items and detailed more precise rules for the graphic design of characters and created a first set of approved ''Bliss-words'' for general use. The Standards council of Canada then sponsored, on January 21, 1993, the registration of an encoded character set for use in ISO/IEC 2022, in the ISO-IR international registry of coded character sets. Due to the size of the set, a two-byte encoding was used, where a limited set of approved 2304 Bliss-words were encoded lexically (many of them being composed with other base conceptual Bliss-characters that are included in this set).

After many years of requests, the Blissymbolic language was finally approved as an encoded language into the [[ISO 639-2]] standard, with code &lt;tt&gt;zbl&lt;/tt&gt;. This code was also included in [[ISO 639-3]] when it was published.

The Blissymbolics script was also assigned the standard code &lt;tt&gt;Blis&lt;/tt&gt; in the registry for [[ISO 15924]] script codes.

It is expected that this Blissymbolics script will be included in the repertoire of the [[Universal Character Set]] (UCS) and encoded for use with the [[ISO/IEC 10646]] and [[Unicode]] standards. An early proposal for encoding was posted by [[Michael Everson]], suggesting that BCI remain involved as an authoritative source of information in the standardization process for the encoding of Bliss-characters in the UCS, to cooperate with the Unicode Technical Committee (UTC) and the ISO Working Group in charge of maintenance of the ISO/IEC 10646 international standard.

The proposed encoding does not use the lexical encoding model that was used in the existing ISO-IR/169 registered character set, but instead applies the Unicode and ISO character-glyph model to the ''Bliss-character'' model already adopted by BCI, since this would significantly reduce the number of needed characters, but also because the precise graphical design of Blissymbolics (including their layout to create Bliss-words and sentences) permits this. Another reason is that Bliss-characters can now be used in a creative way to create many new arbitrary concepts, by surrounding the invented words with special Bliss indicators (similar to punctuation), something which was not possible in the ISO-IR/169 encoding and that would have required much more maintenance work and not permitted easy development of the language with supporting fonts.

During this standardization and unification work, BCI revised some of its graphical rules and made minor corrections to its reference guides, in order to comply with the future character-glyph model wanted by Unicode and ISO TC members. Due to the reform of methods used in BCI when designing and accepting new characters, very few new Bliss-characters have been added to its repertoire, which still contains about 900 characters. However, at the end of 2009, the Blissymbolic script is still not encoded in the UCS.

Some questions are still unanswered, such as the inclusion in the BCI repertoire of some characters (currently about 24) that are already encoded in the UCS (like digits, punctuation signs, spaces and some markers), but whose unification may cause problems due to the very strict graphical layouts required by the published Bliss reference guides (which would not accept the glyph variations allowed in existing compliant Unicode-encoded fonts).

In addition, the character metrics use a specific layout where the usual baseline is not used, and the ideographic em-square is not relevant for Bliss character designs, that use additional &quot;earth line&quot; and &quot;sky line&quot; to define the composition square which is centered between the ascender and descender lines, themselves centered in a higher space for indicators (drawn above the ascenders or below descenders, but still within a space delimited by high and low indicator lines, and with a required leading space above and below the indicator lines.  

However, some fonts supporting the BCI repertoire are available and usable with texts encoded with private-use assignments (PUA) within the UCS; specific graphic font formats have also been developed and used. But for text interchange, only the private BCI encoding based on ISO-IR/169 registration (extended and maintained internally by BCI since then) is available, that require specific software to decode and render them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], '''Bessel functions''', first defined by the [[mathematician]] [[Daniel Bernoulli]] and generalized by [[Friedrich Bessel]], are [[Canonical#Mathematics|canonical]] solutions ''y''(''x'') of Bessel's [[differential equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;x^2 \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + x \frac{dy}{dx} + (x^2 - \alpha^2)y = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for an arbitrary real or complex number α (the ''order'' of the Bessel function); the most common and important cases are for α an [[integer]] or [[half-integer]].

Although α and &amp;minus;α produce the same differential equation, it is conventional to define different Bessel functions for these two orders (e.g., so that the Bessel functions are mostly smooth functions of α). Bessel functions are also known as '''cylinder functions''' or '''cylindrical harmonics''' because they are found in the solution to [[Laplace's equation]] in [[cylindrical coordinates]].

==Applications of Bessel function==
Bessel's equation arises when finding separable solutions to [[Laplace's equation]] and the [[Helmholtz equation]] in cylindrical or [[spherical coordinates]]. Bessel functions are therefore especially important for many problems of [[wave propagation]] and static potentials. In solving problems in cylindrical coordinate systems, one obtains Bessel functions of integer order (α = ''n''); in spherical problems, one obtains half-integer orders (α = ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;½). For example:
* [[Electromagnetic radiation|Electromagnetic waves]] in a cylindrical [[waveguide]]
* [[Conduction (heat)|Heat conduction]] in a cylindrical object
* Modes of vibration of a thin circular (or annular) [[artificial membrane]] (such as a [[drum]] or other [[membranophone]])
* Diffusion problems on a lattice
* Solutions to the radial [[Schrödinger equation]] (in spherical and cylindrical coordinates) for a free particle
* Solving for patterns of acoustical radiation

Bessel functions also have useful properties for other problems, such as signal processing (e.g., see [[FM synthesis]], [[Kaiser window]], or [[Bessel filter]]).

==Definitions==
Since this is a second-order differential equation, there must be two [[linearly independent]] solutions.  Depending upon the circumstances, however, various formulations of these solutions are convenient, and the different variations are described below.

===Bessel functions of the first kind : ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;/sub&gt;===
Bessel functions of the first kind, denoted as ''J''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), are solutions of Bessel's differential equation that are finite at the origin (''x'' = 0) for integer &amp;alpha;, and diverge as ''x'' approaches zero for negative non-integer &amp;alpha;. The solution type (e.g., integer or non-integer) and normalization of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') are defined by its [[Bessel function#Properties|properties]] below. It is possible to define the function by its [[Taylor series]] expansion around ''x'' = 0:&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_360.htm p. 360, 9.1.10].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; J_\alpha(x) = \sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^m}{m! \, \Gamma(m+\alpha+1)} {\left(\tfrac{1}{2}x\right)}^{2m+\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;

where Γ(''z'') is the [[gamma function]], a generalization of the [[factorial]] function to non-integer values. The graphs of Bessel functions look roughly like oscillating sine or cosine functions that decay proportionally to 1/√''x'' (see also their asymptotic forms below), although their roots are not generally periodic, except asymptotically for large ''x''. (The Taylor series indicates that &amp;minus;''J''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is the derivative of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), much like &amp;minus;sin&amp;nbsp;''x'' is the derivative of cos&amp;nbsp;''x''; more generally, the derivative of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') can be expressed in terms of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;plusmn;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') by the identities [[Bessel function#Properties|below]].)

[[Image:Bessel Functions (1st Kind, n=0,1,2).svg|thumb|300px|right|Plot of Bessel function of the first kind, J&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;(x), for integer orders &amp;alpha;=0,1,2.]]

For non-integer α, the functions ''J''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') and ''J''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') are linearly independent, and are therefore the two solutions of the differential equation. On the other hand, for integer order α, the following relationship is valid (note that the Gamma function becomes infinite for negative integer arguments):&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_358.htm p. 358, 9.1.5].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;J_{-n}(x) = (-1)^n J_{n}(x).\,&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the two solutions are no longer linearly independent. In this case, the second linearly independent solution is then found to be the Bessel function of the second kind, as discussed below.

====Bessel's integrals====
Another definition of the Bessel function, for integer values of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, is possible using an integral representation:

:&lt;math&gt;J_n(x) = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^\pi \cos (n \tau - x \sin \tau) \,\mathrm{d}\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

Another integral representation is:

:&lt;math&gt;J_n (x) = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi e^{-\mathrm{i}\,(n \tau - x \sin \tau)} \,\mathrm{d}\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

This was the approach that Bessel used, and from this definition he derived several properties of the function. The definition may be extended to non-integer orders by the addition of another term

:&lt;math&gt;J_\alpha(x) =
   \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^\pi \cos(\alpha\tau- x \sin\tau)\,d\tau

 - \frac{\sin(\alpha\pi)}{\pi} \int_0^\infty
          e^{-x \sinh(t) - \alpha t} \, dt. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.ohio-state.edu/~gerlach/math/BVtypset/node122.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbi.dk/~polesen/borel/node15.html&lt;/ref&gt;

or for &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; -\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;
  J_\alpha(x)= \frac{1}{2^{\alpha-1}\Gamma(\alpha + \frac{1}{2}) \sqrt{\pi}\, x^\alpha} \int_0^x (x^2-\tau^2)^{\alpha-1/2}\cos \tau \, d\tau.
&lt;/math&gt;

====Relation to hypergeometric series====
The Bessel functions can be expressed in terms of the [[generalized hypergeometric series]] as
:&lt;math&gt;J_\alpha(x)=\frac{(x/2)^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)}  \;_0F_1 (\alpha+1; -\tfrac{1}{4}x^2).&lt;/math&gt;
This expression is related to the development of Bessel functions in terms of the [[Bessel–Clifford function]].

====Relation to Laguerre polynomials====
In terms of the [[Laguerre polynomials]] &lt;math&gt;L_k&lt;/math&gt; and arbitrarily chosen parameter &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the Bessel function can be expressed as&lt;ref&gt;Szegö, G. Orthogonal Polynomials, 4th ed. Providence, RI: Amer. Math. Soc., 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{J_\alpha(x)}{\left( \frac{x}{2}\right)^\alpha}= \frac{e^{-t}}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)} \sum_{k=0} \frac{L_k^{(\alpha)}\left( \frac{x^2}{4 t}\right)}{{k+ \alpha \choose k}} \frac{t^k}{k!}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Bessel functions of the second kind : ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;===
The Bessel functions of the second kind, denoted by ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), are solutions of the Bessel differential equation. They have a singularity at the origin (''x'' = 0).

[[Image:Bessel Functions (2nd Kind, n=0,1,2).svg|thumb|300px|right|Plot of Bessel function of the second kind, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), for integer orders &amp;alpha; = 0, 1, 2.]]

''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is sometimes also called the '''Neumann function''', and is occasionally denoted instead by ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'').  For non-integer α, it is related to ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') by:

:&lt;math&gt;Y_\alpha(x) = \frac{J_\alpha(x) \cos(\alpha\pi) - J_{-\alpha}(x)}{\sin(\alpha\pi)}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of integer order ''n'', the function is defined by taking the limit as a non-integer α tends to 'n':

:&lt;math&gt;Y_n(x) = \lim_{\alpha \to n} Y_\alpha(x),&lt;/math&gt;

which has the result (in integral form)

:&lt;math&gt;Y_n(x) =
   \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^\pi \sin(x \sin\theta - n\theta) \, d\theta

 - \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^\infty
          \left[ e^{n t} + (-1)^n e^{-n t} \right]
          e^{-x \sinh t} \, dt. &lt;/math&gt;

''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is necessary as the second linearly independent solution of the Bessel's equation when ''α'' is an integer. But ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') has more meaning than that. It can be considered as a 'natural' partner of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''). See also the subsection on Hankel functions below.

When α is an integer, moreover, as was similarly the case for the functions of the first kind, the following relationship is valid:

:&lt;math&gt;Y_{-n}(x) = (-1)^n Y_n(x).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Both ''J''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') and ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') are [[holomorphic function]]s of ''x'' on  the [[complex plane]] cut along the negative real axis.  When α is an integer, the Bessel functions ''J'' are [[entire function]]s of ''x''.  If ''x'' is held fixed, then the Bessel functions are entire functions of α.

===Hankel functions: ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;===
Another important formulation of the two linearly independent solutions to Bessel's equation are the '''Hankel functions''' ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''), defined by:&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_358.htm p. 358, 9.1.3, 9.1.4].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H_\alpha^{(1)}(x) = J_\alpha(x) + i Y_\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H_\alpha^{(2)}(x) = J_\alpha(x) - i Y_\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]]. These linear combinations are also known as '''Bessel functions of the third kind'''; they are two linearly independent solutions of Bessel's differential equation. They are named after [[Hermann Hankel]].

The importance of Hankel functions of the first and second kind lies
more in theoretical development rather than in application. These forms of linear combination satisfy numerous simple-looking properties, like asymptotic formulae or integral representations. Here, 'simple' means  an appearance of the factor of the form &lt;math&gt;e^{if(x)}&lt;/math&gt;. The Bessel function of the second kind then can be thought to naturally appear as the imaginary part of the Hankel functions.

The Hankel functions are used to express outward- and inward-propagating cylindrical wave solutions of the cylindrical wave equation, respectively (or vice versa, depending on the [[sign convention]] for the [[frequency]]).

Using the previous relationships they can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;H_\alpha^{(1)} (x) = \frac{J_{-\alpha} (x) - e^{-\alpha \pi i} J_\alpha (x)}{i \sin (\alpha \pi)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H_\alpha^{(2)} (x) = \frac{J_{-\alpha} (x) - e^{\alpha \pi i} J_\alpha (x)}{- i \sin (\alpha \pi)}&lt;/math&gt;

if ''α'' is an integer, the limit has to be calculated. The following relationships are valid, whether ''α'' is an integer or not:&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_358.htm p. 358, 9.1.6].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H_{-\alpha}^{(1)} (x)= e^{\alpha \pi i} H_\alpha^{(1)} (x) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H_{-\alpha}^{(2)} (x)= e^{-\alpha \pi i} H_\alpha^{(2)} (x). &lt;/math&gt;

The Hankel functions admit the following integral representations (useful in the calculus of the [[propagator]] of the [[Klein–Gordon]] field):&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_360.htm p. 360, 9.1.25].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H_\alpha^{(1)} (x)= \frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2} \alpha\pi i}}{\pi i}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{ix\cosh t - \alpha t} \, dt. &lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;H_\alpha^{(2)} (x)= -\frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2} \alpha\pi i}}{\pi i}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-ix\cosh t - \alpha t} \, dt. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Modified Bessel functions : ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;===&lt;!-- [[K-distribution]] links to this section. --&gt;
The Bessel functions are valid even for [[complex number|complex]] arguments ''x'', and an important special case is that of a purely imaginary argument.  In this case, the solutions to the Bessel equation are called the '''modified Bessel functions''' (or occasionally the '''hyperbolic Bessel functions''') of the first and second kind, and are defined by any of these equivalent alternatives:&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_375.htm p. 375, 9.6.2, 9.6.10, 9.6.11].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I_\alpha(x) = i^{-\alpha} J_\alpha(ix) =\sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{1}{m! \Gamma(m+\alpha+1)}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^{2m+\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;K_\alpha(x) = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{I_{-\alpha} (x) - I_\alpha (x)}{\sin (\alpha \pi)} = \frac{\pi}{2} i^{\alpha+1} H_\alpha^{(1)}(ix) = -\frac{\pi}{2} i^{\alpha+1} e^{-i \pi \alpha} H_\alpha^{(2)}(-ix).&lt;/math&gt;

There exist many integral representations of these functions. The following for ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), is useful for the calculus of the [[Feynman propagator]] in field theory:

:&lt;math&gt;K_\alpha(x) = \frac{1}{2} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\alpha\pi i} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-ix\sinh t -\alpha t} \, dt &lt;/math&gt;

These are chosen to be real-valued for real and positive arguments ''x''. The series expansion for ''I&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') is thus similar to that for ''J&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''), but without the alternating (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; factor.

''I&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') and ''K&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') are the two linearly independent solutions to the modified Bessel's equation:&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_374.htm p. 374, 9.6.1].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + x \frac{dy}{dx} - (x^2 + \alpha^2)y = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike the ordinary Bessel functions, which are oscillating as functions of a real argument, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; are [[exponential growth|exponentially growing]] and [[exponential decay|decaying]] functions, respectively.  Like the ordinary Bessel function ''J''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;, the function ''I''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; goes to zero at ''x'' = 0 for α &gt; 0 and is finite at ''x'' = 0 for α = 0.  Analogously, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; diverges at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

===Spherical Bessel functions: ''j''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;===

When solving the [[Helmholtz equation]] in spherical coordinates by separation of variables, the radial equation has the form:

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + 2x \frac{dy}{dx} + [x^2 - n(n+1)]y = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The two linearly independent solutions to this equation are called the '''spherical Bessel functions''' ''j''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and are related to the ordinary Bessel functions  ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; by:&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_437.htm p. 437, 10.1.1].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;j_{n}(x) = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2x}} J_{n+1/2}(x),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y_{n}(x) = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2x}} Y_{n+1/2}(x) = (-1)^{n+1} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2x}} J_{-n-1/2}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y_n&lt;/math&gt; is also denoted &lt;math&gt;n_n&lt;/math&gt; or [[Eta (letter)|η]]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;; some authors call these functions the '''spherical Neumann functions'''.

The spherical Bessel functions can also be written as (Rayleigh's Formulas):&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_439.htm p. 439, 10.1.25, 10.1.26];&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;j_n(x) = (-x)^n \left(\frac{1}{x}\frac{d}{dx}\right)^n\,\frac{\sin x}{x} ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_n(x) = -(-x)^n \left(\frac{1}{x}\frac{d}{dx}\right)^n\,\frac{\cos x}{x}.&lt;/math&gt;

The first spherical Bessel function &lt;math&gt;j_0(x)&lt;/math&gt; is also known as the (unnormalized) [[sinc function]]. The first few spherical Bessel functions are:
:&lt;math&gt;j_0(x)=\frac{\sin x} {x}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;j_1(x)=\frac{\sin x} {x^2}- \frac{\cos x} {x}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;j_2(x)=\left(\frac{3} {x^2} - 1 \right)\frac{\sin x}{x} - \frac{3\cos x} {x^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_438.htm p. 438, 10.1.11].&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;j_3(x)=\left(\frac{15}{x^3} - \frac{6}{x} \right)\frac{\sin x}{x} -\left(\frac{15}{x^2} - 1\right) \frac{\cos x} {x},&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;y_0(x)=-j_{-1}(x)=-\,\frac{\cos x} {x}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_1(x)=j_{-2}(x)=-\,\frac{\cos x} {x^2}- \frac{\sin x} {x}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_2(x)=-j_{-3}(x)=\left(-\,\frac{3}{x^2}+1 \right)\frac{\cos x}{x}- \frac{3 \sin x} {x^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_438.htm p. 438, 10.1.12];&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_{3}\left( x\right)=j_{-4}(x) =\left( -\frac{15}{x^{3}}+\frac{6}{x}\right) \frac{\cos
x}{x}-\left( \frac{15}{x^{2}}-1\right) \frac{\sin x}{x};&lt;/math&gt;

The general identity is
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
J_{n+\frac 1 2}(x)=\sqrt{\frac 2 {\pi x}}\sum_{i=0}^\frac {n+1} 2 (-1)^{n-i} &amp; \left[ \sin(x) \left(\frac 2 x\right)^{n-2i} \frac {(n-i)!}{i!} {-\frac 1 2 -i \choose n-2i} \right. \\
&amp; \left.{} - \cos(x) \left(\frac 2 x\right)^{n+1-2i} \frac {(n-i)!}{i!} i {-\frac 1 2 -i \choose n-2i+1}\right].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Generating function====
The spherical Bessel functions have the generating functions &lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_439.htm p. 439, 10.1.39].&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {z} \cos \sqrt{z^2 - 2zt}= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{t^n}{n!} j_{n-1}(z), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {z} \sin \sqrt{z^2 + 2zt}= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-t)^n}{n!} y_{n-1}(z) .&lt;/math&gt;

====Differential relations====
In the following &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; is any of &lt;math&gt;j_n, y_n, h_n^{(1)}, h_n^{(2)}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n=0,\pm 1,\pm 2,\dots&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{1}{z}\frac{d}{dz}\right)^m\left(z^{n+1}f_n(z)\right)=z^{(n-m)+1}f_{(n-m)}(z).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_439.htm p. 439, 10.1.23].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spherical Hankel functions : ''h''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;===
There are also spherical analogues of the Hankel functions:

:&lt;math&gt;h_n^{(1)}(x) = j_n(x) + i y_n(x) \, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;h_n^{(2)}(x) = j_n(x) - i y_n(x). \, &lt;/math&gt;

In fact, there are simple closed-form expressions for the Bessel functions of [[half-integer]] order in terms of the standard [[trigonometric function]]s, and therefore for the spherical Bessel functions.  In particular, for non-negative integers ''n'':

:&lt;math&gt;h_n^{(1)}(x) = (-i)^{n+1} \frac{e^{ix}}{x} \sum_{m=0}^n \frac{i^m}{m!(2x)^m} \frac{(n+m)!}{(n-m)!}&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;h_n^{(2)}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex-conjugate of this (for real &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;). It follows, for example, that &lt;math&gt;j_0(x) = \sin(x)/x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_0(x) = -\cos(x)/x&lt;/math&gt;, and so on.

===Riccati&amp;ndash;Bessel functions: ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;xi;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;zeta;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;===
Riccati&amp;ndash;Bessel functions only slightly differ from spherical Bessel functions:

:&lt;math&gt;S_n(x)=x j_n(x)=\sqrt{\pi x/2} \, J_{n+1/2}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_n(x)=-x y_n(x)=-\sqrt{\pi x/2} \, Y_{n+1/2}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\xi_n(x) = x h_n^{(1)}(x)=\sqrt{\pi x/2} \, H_{n+1/2}^{(1)}(x)=S_n(x)-iC_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_n(x)=x h_n^{(2)}(x)=\sqrt{\pi x/2} \, H_{n+1/2}^{(2)}(x)=S_n(x)+iC_n(x).&lt;/math&gt;

They satisfy the differential equation:

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + [x^2 - n (n+1)] y = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This differential equation, and the Riccati&amp;ndash;Bessel solutions, arises in the problem of scattering of electromagnetic waves by a sphere, known as [[Mie scattering]] after the first published solution by Mie (1908). See e.g., Du (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Hong Du, &quot;Mie-scattering calculation,&quot; ''Applied Optics'' '''43''' (9), 1951&amp;ndash;1956 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; for recent developments and references.

Following [[Peter Debye|Debye]] (1909), the notation &lt;math&gt;\psi_n,\chi_n&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes used instead of
&lt;math&gt;S_n,C_n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Asymptotic forms==
The Bessel functions have the following [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] forms for non-negative α.  For small arguments &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; x \ll \sqrt{\alpha + 1}&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains:&lt;ref name=&quot;Arfken &amp; Weber&quot;&gt;Arfken &amp; Weber.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;J_\alpha(x) \approx \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)} \left( \frac{x}{2} \right) ^\alpha &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Y_\alpha(x) \approx \begin{cases}
  \frac{2}{\pi} \left[ \ln (x/2) + \gamma \right]  &amp; \text{if } \alpha=0 \\ \\
  -\frac{\Gamma(\alpha)}{\pi} \left( \frac{2}{x} \right) ^\alpha &amp; \text{if } \alpha &gt; 0
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]] (0.5772...) and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[gamma function]]. For large arguments &lt;math&gt;x \gg |\alpha^2 - 1/4|&lt;/math&gt;, they become:&lt;ref name=&quot;Arfken &amp; Weber&quot; /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;J_\alpha(x)\approx \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi x}}
        \cos \left( x-\frac{\alpha\pi}{2} - \frac{\pi}{4} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Y_\alpha(x) \approx \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi x}}
        \sin \left( x-\frac{\alpha\pi}{2} - \frac{\pi}{4} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

(For α=1/2 these formulas are exact; see the spherical Bessel functions above.) Asymptotic forms for the other types of Bessel function follow straightforwardly from the above relations.  For example, for large &lt;math&gt;x \gg |\alpha^2 - 1/4|&lt;/math&gt;, the modified Bessel functions become:

:&lt;math&gt;I_\alpha(x) \approx \frac{e^x}{\sqrt{2\pi x}} \left(1+ \frac{(1-2 \alpha)(1+2\alpha)}{8x}+ \cdots \right) ,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;K_\alpha(x) \approx \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2x}} e^{-x}.&lt;/math&gt;

while for small arguments &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; x \ll \sqrt{\alpha + 1}&lt;/math&gt;, they become:

:&lt;math&gt;I_\alpha(x) \approx \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)} \left( \frac{x}{2} \right) ^\alpha &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;K_\alpha(x) \approx \begin{cases}
  - \ln (x/2) - \gamma   &amp; \text{if } \alpha=0 \\ \\
  \frac{\Gamma(\alpha)}{2} \left( \frac{2}{x} \right) ^\alpha &amp; \text{if } \alpha &gt; 0.
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bessel function]] --&gt;
For integer order α = ''n'', ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is often defined via a [[Laurent series]] for a generating function:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{(x/2)(t-1/t)} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty J_n(x) t^n,&lt;/math&gt;

an approach used by [[P. A. Hansen]] in 1843.  (This can be generalized to non-integer order by [[Methods of contour integration|contour integration]] or other methods.)  Another important relation for integer orders is the ''[[Jacobi–Anger expansion]]'':

:&lt;math&gt;e^{iz \cos \phi} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty i^n J_n(z) e^{in\phi},&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;e^{iz \sin \phi} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty J_n(z) e^{in\phi},&lt;/math&gt;

which is used to expand a [[plane wave]] as a sum of cylindrical waves, or to find the [[Fourier series]] of a tone-modulated [[Frequency modulation|FM]] signal.

More generally, a series
:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=a_0^\nu J_\nu (z)+ 2 \cdot \sum_{k=1} a_k^\nu J_{\nu+k}(z)&lt;/math&gt;
is called Neumann expansion of ''ƒ''. The coefficients for &lt;math&gt;\nu=0&lt;/math&gt; have the explicit form

: &lt;math&gt;a_k^0=\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{|z|=c} f(z) O_k(z) \, \mathrm d z,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;O_k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Neumann polynomial|Neumann's polynomial]].&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_363.htm p. 363, 9.1.82] ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Selected functions admit the special representation
:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=\sum_{k=0} a_k^\nu J_{\nu+2k}(z)&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;a_k^\nu=2(\nu+2k) \int_0^\infty f(z) \frac{J_{\nu+2k}(z)}z  \mathrm d z&lt;/math&gt;
due to the orthogonality relation &lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty J_\alpha(z) J_\beta(z) \frac {\mathrm d z} z= \frac 2 \pi \frac{\sin\left(\frac \pi 2 (\alpha-\beta)  \right)}{\alpha^2 -\beta^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if ''ƒ'' has a branch-point near the origin of such a nature that &lt;math&gt;f(z)= \sum_{k=0} a_k J_{\nu+k}(z),&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal L \left\{\sum_{k=0} a_k J_{\nu+k} \right\}(s)= \frac 1 \sqrt{1+s^2} \sum_{k=0} \frac{a_k}{(s+\sqrt{1+s^2})^{\nu+k}}&lt;/math&gt; or

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0} a_k \xi^{\nu+k}= \frac{1+\xi^2}{2\xi} \mathcal L \{f \} \left( \frac{1-\xi^2}{2\xi} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L \{f \}&lt;/math&gt; is ''ƒ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Laplace transform]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Mlk3FrNoEVoC&amp;lpg=PA522&amp;ots=SOShEJmay6&amp;dq=bessel%20neumann%20series&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA536#v=onepage&amp;q=bessel%20neumann%20series&amp;f=false E. T. Whittaker, G. N. Watson, A course in modern Analysis p. 536]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to define the Bessel functions is the Poisson representation formula and the Mehler-Sonine formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}J_\nu(z) &amp;= \frac{ (\frac{z}{2})^\nu }{ \Gamma(\nu + \frac{1}{2} ) \sqrt{\pi} } \int_{-1}^{1} e^{izs}(1 - s^2)^{\nu - \frac{1}{2} } ds, \\
&amp;=\frac 2{{\left(\frac z 2\right)}^\nu\cdot \sqrt{\pi} \cdot \Gamma\left(\frac 1 2-\nu\right)} \int_1^\infty  \frac{\sin(z u)}{(u^2-1)^{\nu+\frac 1 2}} d u,\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&amp;nu;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1/2 and ''z'' is a complex number.&lt;ref&gt;
I.S. Gradshteyn (И.С. Градштейн), I.M. Ryzhik (И.М. Рыжик); Alan Jeffrey, Daniel Zwillinger, editors. ''Table of Integrals, Series, and Products'', seventh edition. Academic Press, 2007. ISBN 978-0-12-373637-6. Equation 8.411.10&lt;/ref&gt; This formula is useful especially when working with [[Fourier transforms]].

The functions ''J''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt; all satisfy the [[recurrence relation]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2\alpha}{x} Z_\alpha(x) = Z_{\alpha-1}(x) + Z_{\alpha+1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; 2\frac{dZ_\alpha}{dx} = Z_{\alpha-1}(x) - Z_{\alpha+1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z'' denotes ''J'', ''Y'', ''H''&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;, or ''H''&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;.  (These two identities are often combined, e.g. added or subtracted, to yield various other relations.) In this way, for example, one can compute Bessel functions of higher orders (or higher derivatives) given the values at lower orders (or lower derivatives).  In particular, it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{d}{x dx} \right)^m \left[ x^\alpha Z_{\alpha} (x) \right] = x^{\alpha - m} Z_{\alpha - m} (x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{d}{x dx} \right)^m \left[ \frac{Z_\alpha (x)}{x^\alpha} \right] = (-1)^m \frac{Z_{\alpha + m} (x)}{x^{\alpha + m}}.&lt;/math&gt;

''Modified'' Bessel functions follow similar relations :

:&lt;math&gt;e^{(x/2)(t+1/t)} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty I_n(x) t^n,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;e^{z \cos \theta} = I_0(z) + 2\sum_{n=1}^\infty  I_n(z) \cos(n\theta),&lt;/math&gt;

The recurrence relation reads

:&lt;math&gt;C_{\alpha-1}(x) - C_{\alpha+1}(x) = \frac{2\alpha}{x} C_\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_{\alpha-1}(x) + C_{\alpha+1}(x) = 2\frac{dC_\alpha}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; denotes ''I''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; or  ''e''&lt;sup&gt;απ''i''&lt;/sup&gt;''K''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;. These recurrence relations are useful for discrete diffusion problems.

Because Bessel's equation becomes [[Hermitian]] (self-adjoint) if it is divided by ''x'', the solutions must satisfy an orthogonality relationship for appropriate boundary conditions.  In particular, it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 x J_\alpha(x u_{\alpha,m}) J_\alpha(x u_{\alpha,n}) dx
= \frac{\delta_{m,n}}{2} [J_{\alpha+1}(u_{\alpha,m})]^2
= \frac{\delta_{m,n}}{2} [J_{\alpha}'(u_{\alpha,m})]^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1, δ&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]], and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;α,m&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''m''-th [[root of a function|zero]] of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'').  This orthogonality relation can then be used to extract the coefficients in the [[Fourier–Bessel series]], where a function is expanded in the basis of the functions ''J''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'' ''u''&lt;sub&gt;α,m&lt;/sub&gt;) for fixed α and varying ''m''.

An analogous relationship for the spherical Bessel functions follows immediately:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 x^2 j_\alpha(x u_{\alpha,m}) j_\alpha(x u_{\alpha,n}) dx
= \frac{\delta_{m,n}}{2} [j_{\alpha+1}(u_{\alpha,m})]^2&lt;/math&gt;

Another orthogonality relation is the ''closure equation'':

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty x J_\alpha(ux) J_\alpha(vx) dx = \frac{1}{u} \delta(u - v)&lt;/math&gt;

for ''α''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1/2 and where δ is the [[Dirac delta function]]. This property is used to construct an arbitrary function from a series of Bessel functions by means of the [[Hankel transform]]. For the spherical Bessel functions the orthogonality relation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty x^2 j_\alpha(ux) j_\alpha(vx) dx = \frac{\pi}{2u^2} \delta(u - v)&lt;/math&gt;

for ''α''&amp;nbsp;&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1.

Another important property of Bessel's equations, which follows from [[Abel's identity]], involves the [[Wronskian]] of the solutions:

:&lt;math&gt;A_\alpha(x) \frac{dB_\alpha}{dx} - \frac{dA_\alpha}{dx} B_\alpha(x) = \frac{C_\alpha}{x},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; are any two solutions of Bessel's equation, and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is a constant independent of ''x'' (which depends on α and on the particular Bessel functions considered).  For example, if ''A''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; = ''J''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''C''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is 2/π.  This also holds for the modified Bessel functions; for example, if ''A''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; = ''I''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''C''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1.

(There are a large number of other known integrals and identities that are not reproduced here, but which can be found in the references.)

==Multiplication theorem==
The Bessel functions obey a [[multiplication theorem]]

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda^{-\nu} J_\nu (\lambda z) =
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!}
\left(\frac{(1-\lambda^2)z}{2}\right)^n
J_{\nu+n}(z)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; may be taken as arbitrary complex numbers. A similar form may be given for &lt;math&gt;Y_\nu(z)&lt;/math&gt; and ''etc.''&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_363.htm p. 363, 9.1.74].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bourget's hypothesis==
Bessel himself originally proved that for non-negative integers ''n'', the equation ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 has an infinite number of solutions in ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;F. Bessel, ''Untersuchung des Theils der planetarischen Störungen'', Berlin Abhandlungen (1824), article 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the functions ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') are plotted on the same graph, though, none of the zeros seem to coincide for different values of ''n'' except for the zero at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  This phenomenon is known as '''Bourget's hypothesis''' after the nineteenth century French mathematician who studied Bessel functions.  Specifically it states that for any integers ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 and ''m''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, the functions ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') and ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') have no common zeros other than the one at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  The theorem was proved by Siegel in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 484–5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brahui''' (Urdu:براہوی) or '''Brahvi''' (براوی) is a [[Dravidian language]] spoken by [[Brahui people]] of [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iran]]. It is isolated from the nearest Dravidian-speaking neighbour population by a distance of more than {{convert|1500|km}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parkin37&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Parkin|1989|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Brahui is spoken in the southwest region of [[Pakistan]], as well as regions of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iran]] which border Pakistan; however, many members of the ethnic group [[language attrition|no longer speak]] Brahui, but have [[language shift|shifted]] to [[Balochi language|Balochi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Parkin37&quot;/&gt; The 2005 edition of [[Ethnologue]] reports that there are some 2.2 million speakers; 90% of those live in Pakistan, mainly in the [[Kalat District|Kalat]] region of Balochistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ethnologue&quot;/&gt;

==Classification==
Brahui belongs, with [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]] (Oraon) and [[Malto]], to the northern subfamily of the Dravidian family of languages. It has been influenced by the [[Iranian languages]] spoken in the area, especially [[Balochi language|Balochi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emeneau|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

Brahui language is seen as a recent migrant language to its present region. Scholars accept that Brahui could only have migrated to Balochistan from [[central India]] after 1000 CE. The absence of any older Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui supports this hypothesis. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, Balochi, is a western [[Iranian language]] like [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], and moved to the area from the west only around 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Witzel|1998|p=1}}, which cites {{harvnb|Elfenbein|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar places the migration аs late as the 13th or 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sergent|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} However, few scholars hypothesised that Brahui is a remnant of a formerly widespread Dravidian language family that is believed to have been reduced or replaced during the influx of Iranian/Indo-Aryan languages upon their arrival in South Asia. It has been hypothesised that Brahui might be a remnant of the language spoken in the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Dialects==
[[Kalat]], [[Jhalawan]], and [[Sarawan]], with [[Kalat]] as the standard dialect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ethnologue&quot;/&gt;

==Orthography==
Brahui is the only [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]] which has not been written in a [[Brahmic family of scripts|Brahmi]]-based script in the recent past; instead, it is written in the [[Arabic script]]. More recently, a Roman-based orthography has been developed by the Brahui Language Board of the [[University of Balochistan]] in Quetta.

{{See also|List of endangered languages in Asia}}
According to a 2009 [[UNESCO]] report, Brahui is one of the 27 [[languages of Pakistan]] that are facing the [[endangered language|danger]] of [[extinct language|extinction]]. They classify it in &quot;unsafe&quot; status, the least endangered level out of the five levels of concern (Unsafe, Definitely Endangered, Severely Endangered, Critically Endangered, and Extinct).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moseley|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
Haftaí Talár recently became the first ever daily newspaper in Brahui language.  It uses the new Roman orthography, and is &quot;an attempt to standardize and develop Brahui language to meet the requirements of modern political, social and scientific discourse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.talarpub.tk/|publisher=Talár Publications|title=Haftaí Talár|accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Ricketson Tucker''' (April 17, 1854&amp;nbsp;– June 22, 1939) was a proponent of [[Anarchism in the United States|American]] [[individualist anarchism]] (which he called &quot;unterrified [[Jeffersonianism]]&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Daniel (2010-01-01) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/jan/01/00044/ A Fistful of Dynamite], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt; in the 19th century, and editor and publisher of the individualist anarchist periodical ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''.

==Summary==
Tucker says that he became an anarchist at the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;Symes, Lillian and Clement, Travers. Rebel America: The Story of Social Revolt in the United States. Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers. 1934. p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker's contribution to American individualist anarchism was as much through his [[publishing]] as his own writing. Tucker was the first to translate into English [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]]'s ''[[What is Property?]]'' and [[Max Stirner]]'s ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]''&amp;nbsp;— which Tucker claimed was his proudest accomplishment. In editing and publishing the anarchist periodical ''[[Liberty (19th century magazine)|Liberty]]'', he published the original work of [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], [[Joshua K. Ingalls]], [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Auberon Herbert]], [[Victor Yarros]], and [[Lillian Harman]], daughter of the free love anarchist [[Moses Harman]], as well as his own writing. He also published such items as [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s first original article to appear in the United States and the first American translated excerpts of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. In ''Liberty'', Tucker both filtered and integrated the theories of such European thinkers as [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]; the economic and legal theories of the American individualists [[Lysander Spooner]], [[William B. Greene]] and [[Josiah Warren]]; and the writings of the [[Freethought|free thought]] and [[free love]] movements in opposition to [[religious]]ly based [[legislation]] and prohibitions on non-invasive behavior. Through these influences Tucker produced a rigorous system of philosophical or [[individualist anarchism]] that he called ''Anarchistic-Socialism'', arguing that ''&quot;[the] most perfect Socialism is possible only on the condition of the most perfect individualism.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;cited by Peter Marshall, Demanding the Impossible, p. 390&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian of American individualist anarchism, Frank Brooks, it is easy to misunderstand Tucker's claim of &quot;socialism.&quot; Before Marxists established a hegemony over definitions of &quot;socialism, &quot;the term socialism was a broad concept.&quot; Tucker (as well as most of the writers and readers in Liberty) understood &quot;socialism&quot; to refer to any of various theories and demands aimed to solve &quot;[[the labor problem]]&quot; through radical changes in the capitalist economy; descriptions of the problem, explanations of it causes, and proposed solutions (for example,, abolition of private property, cooperatives, state-ownership, and so on.) varied among &quot;socialist&quot; philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Frank H. 1994. The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty (1881-1908). Transaction Publishers. p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker said socialism was the claim that &quot;labor should be put in possession of its own,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin. [http://fair-use.org/benjamin-tucker/instead-of-a-book/state-socialism-and-anarchism#art1p1 &quot;State Socialism and Anarchism,&quot; ¶ 1].&lt;/ref&gt; holding that what &quot;state socialism&quot; and &quot;anarchistic socialism&quot; had in common was the [[labor theory of value]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown. Susan Love. 1997. The Free Market as Salvation from Government. In Meanings of the Market: The Free Market in Western Culture. p. 107. Berg Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; However, &quot;Instead of asserting, as did socialist anarchists, that common ownership was the key to eroding differences of economic power,&quot; and appealing to social solidarity, Tucker's individualist anarchism advocated distribution of property in an undistorted natural market as a mediator of egoistic impulses and a source of social stability.&lt;ref&gt;Freeden, Michael. 1996. Ideologies and Political Theory: A Conceptual Approach. p. 276. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although Tucker described his views as &quot;Anarchistic Socialism,&quot; Freeden and some other scholars do not consider Tucker a socialist anarchist because he supports private control over the means of production as opposed to socialized or community control. Tucker, Benjamin: [http://fair-use.org/benjamin-tucker/instead-of-a-book/should-labor-be-paid-or-not &quot;Should Labor be Paid or Not?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker said, ''&quot;the fact that one class of men are dependent for their living upon the sale of their labour, while another class of men are relieved of the necessity of labour by being legally privileged to sell something that is not labour. . . . And to such a state of things I am as much opposed as any one. But the minute you remove privilege. . . every man will be a labourer exchanging with fellow-labourers . . . What Anarchistic-Socialism aims to abolish is usury . . . it wants to deprive capital of its reward.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;[Instead of a Book, p. 404]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tucker first favored a natural rights philosophy where an individual had a right to own the fruits of his labor, then abandoned it in favor of &quot;egoism&quot; influenced by [[Max Stirner]], where he then believed that only the &quot;right of might&quot; exists until overridden by contract.

He objected to all forms of communism, believing that even a stateless communist society must encroach upon the liberty of individuals who were in it.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, Charles A. Anarchism in the United States. Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol 6, No 1, January 1945, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; He &quot;denounced [[Karl Marx|Marx]] as the representative of 'the principle of authority which we live to combat.' He thought [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] the superior theorist and the real champion of freedom. 'Marx would nationalize the productive and distributive forces; Proudhon would individualize and associate them.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheldon Richman|Richman, Sheldon]], [http://www.amconmag.com/blog/libertarian-left/ Libertarian Left], ''[[The American Conservative]]'' (March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Four Monopolies==
Tucker argued that the poor condition of American workers resulted from four [[legal monopoly|legal monopolies]] based in authority:
# the money monopoly,
# the land monopoly,
# [[tariff]]s, and
# [[patent]]s.

His focus for several decades became the state's economic control of how trade could take place, and what [[currency]] counted as legitimate. He saw interest and profit as a form of exploitation made possible by the [[banking]] monopoly, which was in turn maintained through coercion and invasion. Any such interest and profit, Tucker called &quot;[[usury]]&quot; and he saw it as the basis for the oppression of the workers. In his words, ''&quot;interest is theft, Rent Robbery, and Profit Only Another Name for Plunder.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Martin Blatt, Benjamin R. Tucker and the Champions of Liberty, Coughlin, Hamilton and Sullivan (eds.), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker believed that usury was immoral, however, he upheld the right for all people to engage in immoral contracts. &quot;Liberty, therefore, must defend the right of individuals to make contracts involving usury, rum, marriage, prostitution, and many other things which are believed to be wrong in principle and opposed to human well-being. The right to do wrong involves the essence of all rights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin R. Tucker, &quot;Right and Individual Rights,&quot; Liberty I (January 7, 1882): 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

He asserted that anarchism is meaningless &quot;unless it includes the liberty of the individual to control his product or whatever his product has brought him through exchange in a free market&amp;nbsp;— that is, private property.&quot; He acknowledged that &quot;anything is a product upon which human labor has been expended,&quot; but would not recognize full property rights to labored-upon land: &quot;It should be noted, however, that in the case of land, or of any other material the supply of which is so limited that all cannot hold it in unlimited quantities, Anarchism undertakes to protect no titles except such as are based upon actual occupancy and use.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin, [http://fair-use.org/benjamin-tucker/instead-of-a-book/more-questions#art14n1 &quot;Instead of a Book&quot;, page 61, footnote.]&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker opposed title to land that was not in use, arguing that an individual would have to use land continually in order to retain exclusive right to it. If this practice is not followed, he believed it results in a &quot;land monopoly.&quot;

Tucker also opposed state protection of the banking monopoly, the requirement that one must obtain a charter to engage in the business of banking. He hoped to raise wages by deregulating the banking industry, reasoning that competition in banking would drive down interest rates and stimulate entrepreneurship. Tucker believed this would decrease the proportion of individuals seeking employment and therefore wages would be driven up by competing employers. &quot;Thus, the same blow that strikes interest down will send wages up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://praxeology.net/BT-SSA.htm] Libertarian Heritage No. 23. ISSN 0959-566X ISBN 1-85637-549-8, Libertarian Alliance, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not oppose individuals being employed by others, but due to his interpretation of the [[labor theory of value]], he believed that in the present economy individuals do not receive a wage that fully compensates them for their labor. He wrote that if the four &quot;monopolies&quot; were ended, &quot;it will make no difference whether men work for themselves, or are employed, or employ others. In any case they can get nothing but that wages for their labor which free competition determines.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin. [http://fair-use.org/benjamin-tucker/instead-of-a-book/solutions-of-the-labor-problem#e164p24 &quot;Solutions of the Labor Problem,&quot; in ''Instead of a Book'', p. 475].&lt;/ref&gt;

Tucker opposed [[protectionism]], believing that tariffs cause high prices by preventing national producers from having to compete with foreign competitors. He believed that [[free trade]] would help keep prices low and therefore would assist laborers in receiving their &quot;natural wage.&quot; Tucker did not believe in a right to intellectual property in the form of patents, on the grounds that patents and copyrights protect something which cannot rightfully be held as property. In [http://praxeology.net/BT-AIC.htm &quot;The Attitude of Anarchism toward Industrial Combinations,&quot;] he wrote that the basis for property is &quot;the fact that it is impossible in the nature of things for concrete objects to be used in different places at the same time.&quot; Property in concrete things is &quot;socially necessary.&quot; &quot;[S]ince successful society rests on individual initiative, [it is necessary] to protect the individual creator in the use of his concrete creations by forbidding others to use them without his consent.&quot; Because ideas are not concrete things, they cannot be held and protected as property. Ideas ''can'' be used in different places at the same time, and so their use should not be restricted by patents.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin: [http://praxeology.net/BT-AIC.htm The Attitude of Anarchism toward Industrial Combinations]&lt;/ref&gt; This was a source of conflict with the philosophy of fellow individualist [[Lysander Spooner]] who saw ideas as the product of &quot;intellectual labor&quot; and therefore private property.&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander. [http://lysanderspooner.org/intellect/contents.htm The Law of Intellectual Property: or an essay on the right of authors and inventors to a perpetual property in their ideas.], Chapter 1, Section VI.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Victor Yarros]]: {{quote|He [Tucker] opposed savagely any and all reform movements that had paternalistic aims and looked to the state for aid and fulfillment...For the same reason, consistent, unrelenting opposition to compulsion, he combated &quot;populism,&quot; &quot;greenbackism,&quot; the single-tax movement, and all forms of socialism and communism. He denounced and exposed [[Johann Most]], the editor of ''Freiheit'', the anarchist-communist organ. The end, he declared, could never justify the means, if the means were intrinsically immoral&amp;nbsp;— and force, by whomsoever used, was immoral except as a means of preventing or punishing aggression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yarros&quot; /&gt;}} Tucker rejected the legislative programs of labor unions, laws imposing a short day, minimum wage laws, forcing businesses to provide insurance to employees, and compulsory pension systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yarros&quot;/&gt; He believed instead that strikes should be composed by free workers rather than by bureaucratic union officials and organizations. He argued, ''&quot;strikes, whenever and wherever inaugurated, deserve encouragement from all the friends of labour. . . They show that people are beginning to know their rights, and knowing, dare to maintain them.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Tucker, Liberty, 15/4/1881&lt;/ref&gt; and furthermore, ''&quot;as an awakening agent, as an agitating force, the beneficent influence of a strike is immeasurable. . . with our present economic system almost every strike is just. For what is justice in production and distribution? That labour, which creates all, shall have all.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Tucker, Liberty, #19, 1882&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker envisioned an individualist anarchist society as ''&quot;each man reaping the fruits of his labour and no man able to live in idleness on an income from capital....become[ing] a great hive of Anarchistic workers, prosperous and free individuals [combining] to carry on their production and distribution on the cost principle.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;The Individualist Anarchists, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a bureaucratic organization of workers organized into rank and file unions. However, he did hold a genuine appreciation for labor unions (which he called ''&quot;trades-union socialism&quot;'') and saw it as ''&quot;an intelligent and self-governing socialism&quot;'' saying, ''&quot;[they] promise the coming substitution of industrial socialism for usurping legislative mobism.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;The Individualist Anarchists, pp. 283-284&lt;/ref&gt;

Tucker's concept of the four monopolies has recently been discussed by [[Kevin Carson]] in his book Studies in Mutualist Political Economy. Carson incorporates the idea into his thesis that the exploitation of labor is only possible due to state intervention, however, he argues that Tucker failed to notice a fifth form of privilege: transportation subsidies.
{{quote|One form of contemporary government intervention that Tucker almost entirely ignored was transportation subsidies. This seems odd at first glance, since &quot;internal improvements&quot; had been a controversial issue throughout the nineteenth century, and were a central part of the mercantilist agenda of the Whigs and the Gilded Age GOP. Indeed, Lincoln has announced the beginning of his career with a &quot;short but sweet&quot; embrace of Henry Clay's program: a national bank, a high tariff, and internal improvements. This neglect, however, was in keeping with Tucker's inclination. He was concerned with privilege primarily as it promoted monopoly profits through unfair exchange at the individual level, and not as it affected the overall structure of production. The kind of government intervention that James O'Connor was later to write about, that promoted accumulation and concentration by directly subsidizing the operating costs of big business, largely escaped his notice.}}
Carson believes that Tucker's four monopolies and transportation subsidies created the foundation for the [[state monopoly capitalism|monopoly capitalism]] and [[military-industrial complex]] of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/id72.html Kevin Carson.

Tucker did not have a Utopian vision of anarchy where individuals would not coerce others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yarros&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Victor Yarros]]| title = Philosophical Anarchism: Its Rise, Decline, and Eclipse| year=1936 | journal = [[The American Journal of Sociology]]|volume=41|issue=4|pages = 470–483| doi = 10.1086/217188}}&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated that liberty and property be defended by private institutions. Opposing the monopoly of the state in providing security, he advocated a free market of competing defense providers, saying &quot;defense is a service like any other service; ... it is labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;On Picket Duty.&quot; Liberty. July 30, 1887; 4, 26. p4.&lt;/ref&gt; He said that anarchism &quot;does not exclude prisons, officials, military, or other symbols of force. It merely demands that non-invasive men shall not be made the victims of such force. Anarchism is not the reign of love, but the reign of justice. It does not signify the abolition of force-symbols but the application of force to real invaders.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin. ''Liberty'' October 19, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker expressed that the market-based providers of security would offer protection of land that was being used, and would not offer assistance to those attempting to collect rent:''&quot;The land for the people' . . . means the protection by . . . voluntary associations for the maintenance of justice . . . of all people who desire to cultivate land in possession of whatever land they personally cultivate . . . and the positive refusal of the protecting power to lend its aid to the collection of any rent, whatsoever.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;quoted by Martin Blatt, Benjamin R. Tucker and the Champions of Liberty, Coughlin, Hamilton and Sullivan (eds.), p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embrace of &quot;egoism&quot;==
Tucker abandoned natural rights doctrine and became a proponent of what is known as &quot;Egoism.&quot; This led to a split in American Individualism between the growing number of Egoists and the contemporary Spoonerian &quot;[[Natural Law]]yers&quot;. Tucker came to hold the position that no rights exist until they are created by contract. This led him to controversial positions such as claiming that infants had no rights and were the property of their parents, because they did not have the ability to contract. He said that a person who physically tries to stop a mother from throwing her &quot;baby into the fire&quot; should be punished for violating her property rights. He said that children would shed their status as property when they became old enough to contract &quot;to buy or sell a house&quot; for example, noting that the precocity varies by age and would be determined by a jury in the case of a complaint.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy. 2003. The Debates of Liberty. Lexington Books. pp. 77-79&lt;/ref&gt;

He also came to believe that aggression towards others was justifiable if doing so led to a greater decrease in &quot;aggregate pain&quot; than refraining from doing so. He said:

{{quote|the ultimate end of human endeavor is the minimum of pain. We aim to decrease invasion only because, as a rule, invasion increases the total of pain (meaning, of course, pain suffered by the ego, whether directly or through sympathy with others). But it is precisely my contention that this rule, despite the immense importance which I place upon it, is not absolute; that, on the contrary, there are exceptional cases where invasion--that is, coercion of the non-invasive--lessens the aggregate pain. Therefore coercion of the non-invasive, when justifiable at all, is to be justified on the ground that it secures, not a minimum of invasion, but a minimum of pain. . . . [T]o me [it is] axiomatic--that the ultimate end is the minimum of pain &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Land Tenure Again.&quot; Liberty. October 19, 1895; 11, 12; p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tucker now said that there were only two rights, &quot;the right of might&quot; and &quot;the right of contract.&quot; He also said, after converting to Egoist individualism that ownership in land is legitimately transferred through force unless contracted otherwise. In 1892, he said &quot;In times past...it was my habit to talk glibly of the right of man to land. It was a bad habit, and I long ago sloughed it off. Man's only right to land is his might over it. If his neighbor is mightier than he and takes the land from him, then the land is his neighbor's, until the latter is dispossessed by one mightier still.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin R. Tucker, &quot;Response to 'Rights,' by William Hansen,&quot; ''Liberty'', December 31, 1892; 9, 18;
pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; However, he said he believed that individuals would come to the realization that &quot;[[law of equal liberty|equal liberty]]&quot; and &quot;occupancy and use&quot; doctrines were &quot;generally trustworthy guiding principle of action,&quot; and, as a result, they would likely find it in their interests to contract with each other to refrain from infringing upon equal liberty and from protecting land that was not in use.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin R. Tucker, &quot;The Two Conceptions of Equal Freedom,&quot; ''Liberty'', April 6, 1895; 10, 24; pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Though he believed that non-invasion, and &quot;occupancy and use as the title to land&quot; were general rules that people would find in their own interests to create through contract, he said that these rules &quot;must be sometimes trodden underfoot.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, &quot;Land Tenure Again&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late life==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
In 1908, a fire destroyed Tucker's uninsured printing equipment and his 30-year stock of books and pamphlets. Tucker's lover, Pearl Johnson&amp;nbsp;— 25 years his junior&amp;nbsp;— was pregnant with their daughter, Oriole Tucker. Six weeks after Oriole's birth, Tucker closed both ''Liberty'' and the book shop and retired with his family to France. In 1913, he came out of retirement for two years to contribute articles and letters to ''[[The New Freewoman]]'' which he called &quot;the most important publication in existence.&quot;

Late in life, Tucker became much more pessimistic about the prospects for anarchism. In 1926, [[Vanguard Press]] published a selection of his writings entitled ''Individual Liberty'', in which Tucker added [http://praxeology.net/BT-SSA.htm#SSA.37 a postscript] to [http://praxeology.net/BT-SSA.htm &quot;State Socialism and Anarchism&quot;], which stated &quot;Forty years ago, when the foregoing essay was written, the denial of competition had not yet effected the enormous concentration of wealth that now so gravely threatens social order. It was not yet too late to stem the current of accumulation by a reversal of the policy of monopoly. The Anarchistic remedy was still applicable.&quot; But, Tucker argued, &quot;Today the way is not so clear. The four monopolies, unhindered, have made possible the modern development of the trust, and the trust is now a monster which I fear, even the freest banking, could it be instituted, would be unable to destroy. ... If this be true, then monopoly, which can be controlled permanently only for economic forces, has passed for the moment beyond their reach, and must be grappled with for a time solely by forces political or revolutionary. Until measures of forcible confiscation, through the State or in defiance of it, shall have abolished the concentrations that monopoly has created, the economic solution proposed by Anarchism and outlined in the forgoing pages&amp;nbsp;– ''and there is no other solution''&amp;nbsp;– will remain a thing to be taught to the rising generation, that conditions may be favorable to its application after the great leveling. But education is a slow process, and may not come too quickly. Anarchists who endeavor to hasten it by joining in the propaganda of State Socialism or revolution make a sad mistake indeed. They help to so force the march of events that the people will not have time to find out, by the study of their experience, that their troubles have been due to the rejection of competition.&quot;

By 1930, Tucker had concluded that centralization and advancing technology had doomed both anarchy and civilization. &quot;The matter of my famous 'Postscript' now sinks into insignificance; the insurmountable obstacle to the realization of Anarchy is no longer the power of the trusts, but the indisputable fact that our civilization is in its death throes. We may last a couple of centuries yet; on the other hand, a decade may precipitate our finish. ... The ''dark'' ages sure enough. The Monster, Mechanism, is devouring mankind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Clarence Lee Swartz, July 22, 1930. In Joseph Ishill (ed.), ''Free Vistas: A Libertarian Outlook on Life and Letters'', II, 300–301. Quoted in James J. Martin, ''Men Against the State'', 1953:260.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to James Martin, when referring to the world scene of the mid-1930s in private correspondence, Tucker wrote: &quot;[[Capitalism]] is at least tolerable, which cannot be said of [[Socialism]] or [[Communism]]&quot; and went on to observe that, &quot;under any of these regimes a sufficiently shrewd man can feather his nest.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Martin, Men Against the State, 1970:275, quoting from the Baskette Collection (1933-1935)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Love Brown]] claims that this unpublished, private letter, which does not distinguish between the anarchist socialism Tucker advocated and the state socialism he criticized, served in &quot;providing the shift further illuminated in the 1970s by [[anarcho-capitalists]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Susan Brown]], The Free Market as Salvation from Government, Meanings of the Market: The Free Market in Western Culture, page 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Tucker died in [[Monaco]] in 1939, in the company of his family. His daughter, Oriole, reported, &quot;Father's attitude towards communism never changed one whit, nor about religion.... In his last months he called in the French housekeeper. 'I want her,' he said, 'to be a witness that on my death bed I'm not recanting. I do not believe in God!&quot;&lt;ref name=oriole&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Avrich|title=Anarchist Voices|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1996|isbn=0-691-04494-5|chapter=Oriole Tucker Riché|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Berkeley DB''' (BDB) is a [[computer software]] [[Library (computing)|library]] that provides a high-performance [[embedded database]] for key/value data.  Berkeley DB is a programmatic software library written in [[C (programming language)|C]] with API bindings for [[C++]], [[PHP]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Tcl]], [[Smalltalk]], and most other [[programming language]]s. BDB stores arbitrary key/data pairs as byte arrays, and supports multiple data items for a single key. Berkeley DB is not a relational database.&lt;ref&gt;http://doc.gnu-darwin.org/intro/dbisnot.html&lt;/ref&gt; BDB can support thousands of simultaneous threads of control or concurrent processes manipulating databases as large as 256 terabytes, on a wide variety of [[operating system]]s including most [[Unix-like]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] systems, and [[real-time operating system]]s. '''Berkeley DB''' is also used as the common name for three distinct products; Oracle Berkeley DB, Berkeley DB Java Edition, and Berkeley DB XML.  These three products all share a common ancestry and are currently under active development at [[Oracle Corporation]].

== Origin ==
Berkeley DB originated at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] as part of the transition (1986 to 1994) from 4.3[[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] to 4.4BSD and of the effort to remove AT&amp;T-encumbered code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Olson |first1=Michael A. |last2=Bostic |first2=Keith |last3=Seltzer |first3=Margot |title=Berkeley DB |booktitle=Proc. FREENIX Track, USENIX Annual Tech. Conf. |year=1999 |url=http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix99/full_papers/olson/olson.pdf |accessdate=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first code, due to Seltzer and Yigit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Seltzer |first1=Margot |last2=Yigit |first2=Ozan |title=A New Hashing Package for UNIX |booktitle=Proc. USENIX Winter Tech. Conf. |year=1991 |url=http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/margo/papers/usenix91/paper.ps |accessdate=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to create a disk hash table that performed better than any of the existing [[Dbm]] libraries. In 1996 [[Netscape]] requested that the authors of Berkeley DB improve and extend the library, then at version 1.86, to suit Netscape's requirements for an [[LDAP]] server&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Brunelli |first=Mark |url=http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid39_gci1071880,00.html |title=A Berkeley DB primer |journal=Enterprise Linux News |date=March 28, 2005 |accessdate=December 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for use in the [[Netscape (web browser)|Netscape browser]]. That request led to the creation of [[Sleepycat Software]]. This company was acquired by [[Oracle Corporation]] in February 2006, which continues to develop and sell Berkeley DB.

Since its initial release, Berkeley DB has gone through various versions.  Each major release cycle has introduced a single new major feature generally layering on top of the earlier features to add functionality to the product.  The 1.x releases focused on managing key/value data storage and are referred to as &quot;Data Store&quot; (DS).  The 2.x releases added a locking system enabling concurrent access to data.  This is what is known as &quot;Concurrent Data Store&quot; (CDS).  The 3.x releases added a logging system for transactions and recovery, called &quot;Transactional Data Store&quot; (TDS).  The 4.x releases added the ability to replicate log records and create a distributed highly available single-master multi-replica database.  This is called the &quot;High Availability&quot; (HA) feature set.  Berkeley DB's evolution has sometimes led to minor API changes or log format changes, but very rarely have database formats changed.  Berkeley DB HA supports online upgrades from one version to the next by maintaining the ability to read and apply the prior release's log records.

The [[FreeBSD]] and [[OpenBSD]] operating system continue to use Berkeley DB 1.8x for compatibility reasons;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=db&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+7.1-RELEASE&amp;format=html |title=db(3) |accessdate=April 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linux-based operating systems commonly include several versions to accommodate for applications still using older interfaces/files.

Berkeley DB is redistributed under the [[Sleepycat license|Sleepycat Public License]], which is an [[Open Source Initiative|OSI]]-approved [[open source license]] as well as an [[Free Software Foundation|FSF]]-approved [[free software licence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensource.org/licenses/sleepycat.php |title=The Sleepycat License | publisher=[[Open Source Initiative]] |date=October 31, 2006 |accessdate=December 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/index_html#GPLCompatibleLicenses |title=Licenses |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] |date=December 10, 2008 |accessdate=December 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product ships with complete source code, build script, test suite, and documentation. The code quality and general utility along with the licensing terms have led to its use in a multitude of [[free and open source software]]. Those who do not wish to abide by the terms of the Sleepycat Public License have the option of purchasing another [[proprietary software license|proprietary license]] for redistribution from [[Oracle Corporation]]. This technique is called [[Dual license|dual licensing]].

Berkeley DB includes compatibility interfaces for some historic Unix database libraries: [[dbm]], [[ndbm]] and hsearch (a [[UNIX System V|System V]] library for creating in-memory [[hash table]]s).

==Architecture==
Berkeley DB has an architecture notably simpler than that of other database systems like [[Microsoft SQL Server]] and [[Oracle database|Oracle]]. For example, like [[SQLite]], it does not provide support for network access — programs access the database using in-process [[Application programming interface|API]] calls. Oracle added support for SQL in 11g R2 release based on the popular SQLite API by including a version of SQLite in Berkeley DB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter / Gregory Burd: @humanications We didn't r ...|url=http://twitter.com/gregburd/statuses/10979336891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, as is common with SQLite, there is now 3rd Party support for PL/SQL in Berkeley DB through [[StepSqlite|Metatranz StepSqlite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Berkeley DB FAQ|url=http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/berkeleydb/db-faq-095848.html#DoesBerkeleyDBsupportPLSQL|publisher=[[Oracle Corporation]] |quote=Does Berkeley DB support PL/SQL? |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A program accessing the database is free to decide how the data is to be stored in a record. Berkeley DB puts no constraints on the record's data. The record and its key can both be up to four gigabytes long.

Despite having a simple architecture, Berkeley DB supports many advanced database features such as [[ACID]] [[Database transaction|transactions]], fine-grained [[Lock (computer science)|locking]], hot [[backup]]s and [[replication (computer science)|replication]].

==Editions==
The name '''Berkeley DB''' encompasses three different products:

# Berkeley DB
# Berkeley DB Java Edition
# Berkeley DB XML

Each edition has separate database libraries, despite the common branding. The first is the traditional Berkeley DB, written in C.

Berkeley DB Java Edition (JE) is a pure Java database. Its design resembles that of Berkeley DB without replicating it exactly, and has a feature set that includes many of those found in the traditional Berkeley DB and others that are specific to the Java Edition. Since it is written in pure Java, no native code is required. It has a log structured storage architecture, which gives it different performance and concurrency characteristics. Three APIs are available—a Direct Persistence Layer which is &quot;Plain Old Java Objects&quot; (POJO); one which is based on the Java Collections Framework (an object persistence approach); and one based on the traditional Berkeley DB API.  The Berkeley DB Java Edition High Availability option (Replication) is available.  Note that traditional Berkeley DB also supports a Java API, but it does so via [[Java Native Interface|JNI]] and thus requires an installed native library.

The Berkeley DB XML database specializes in the storage of XML documents, supporting [[XQuery]] via [[XQilla]]. It is implemented as an additional layer on top of (a legacy version of) Berkeley DB and the [[Xerces]] library. DB XML is written in C++ and supports multiple language bindings, including C++, Java (via JNI), [[Perl]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

==Programs that use Berkeley DB==
Berkeley DB provides the underlying storage and retrieval system of several [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] servers, database systems, and many other proprietary and free/open source applications. Notable software that use Berkeley DB for data storage include:

In [[computer science]], '''satisfiability''' (often written in all capitals or abbreviated '''SAT''') is the problem of determining if the variables of a given [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] formula can be assigned in such a way as to make the formula evaluate to TRUE.  Equally important is to determine whether no such assignments exist, which would imply that the function expressed by the formula is identically FALSE for all possible variable assignments. In this latter case, we would say that the function is unsatisfiable; otherwise it is satisfiable. To emphasize the binary nature of this problem, it is frequently referred to as ''Boolean'' or ''propositional satisfiability''.

SAT was the first known example of an [[NP-complete]] problem.  That briefly means that there is no known algorithm that efficiently solves all instances of SAT, and it is generally believed (see [[P versus NP problem]]) that no such algorithm can exist.  Further, a wide range of other naturally-occurring decision and optimization problems can be transformed into instances of SAT.  A class of algorithms called [[SAT solver]]s can efficiently solve a large enough subset of SAT instances to be useful in various practical areas such as [[circuit design]] and [[automatic theorem proving]], by solving SAT instances made by transforming problems that arise in those areas.  Extending the capabilities of SAT solving algorithms is an ongoing area of progress.  However, no current such methods can efficiently solve ''all'' SAT instances.

==Basic definitions, terminology and applications==
In [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], the '''satisfiability problem''' ('''SAT''') is a [[decision problem]], whose instance is a Boolean expression written using only AND, OR, NOT, variables, and parentheses. The question is: given the expression, is there some assignment of ''TRUE'' and ''FALSE'' values to the variables that will make the entire expression true? A formula of [[propositional logic]] is said to be ''satisfiable'' if [[logical value]]s can be assigned to its [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] in a way that makes the formula true. The Boolean satisfiability problem is [[NP-complete]]. The propositional satisfiability problem (PSAT), which decides whether a given [[propositional formula]] is satisfiable, is of central importance in various areas of [[computer science]], including [[theoretical computer science]], [[algorithmics]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[hardware design]], [[electronic design automation]], and [[hardware verification|verification]].

A '''literal''' is either a variable or the negation of a variable (the negation of an expression can be reduced to negated variables by [[De Morgan's laws]]). For example, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{x_1}&lt;/math&gt; is a '''positive literal''' and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{not(x_2)}&lt;/math&gt; is a '''negative literal'''.

A '''clause''' is a [[disjunction]] of literals. For example, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{x_1 \or not(x_2)}&lt;/math&gt; is a clause (read as &quot;x-sub-one or not x-sub-2&quot;).

There are several special cases of the Boolean satisfiability problem in which the formulae are required to be [[Logical conjunction|conjunctions]] of clauses (i.e. formulae in [[conjunctive normal form]]). Determining the satisfiability of a formula in conjunctive normal form where each clause is limited to at most three literals is NP-complete; this problem is called &quot;3SAT&quot;, &quot;3CNFSAT&quot;, or &quot;3-satisfiability&quot;. Determining the satisfiability of a formula in which each clause is limited to at most two literals is [[NL-complete]]; this problem is called &quot;[[2SAT]]&quot;. Determining the satisfiability of a formula in which each clause is a [[Horn clause]] (i.e. it contains at most one positive literal) is [[P-complete]]; this problem is called [[Horn-satisfiability]].

The [[Cook–Levin theorem]] states that the Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete, and in fact, this was the first decision problem proved to be NP-complete. However, beyond this theoretical significance, efficient and scalable algorithms for SAT that were developed over the last decade have contributed to dramatic advances in our ability to automatically solve problem instances involving tens of thousands of variables and millions of constraints. Examples of such problems in electronic design automation (EDA) include [[formal equivalence checking]], [[model checking]], [[formal verification]] of [[microprocessor|pipelined microprocessors]], [[automatic test pattern generation]], [[routing (electronic design automation)|routing]] of [[FPGA]]s, and so on. A SAT-solving engine is now considered to be an essential component in the EDA toolbox.

==Complexity and restricted versions==
===NP-completeness===
SAT was the first known [[NP-complete]] problem, as proved by [[Stephen Cook]] in 1971 (see [[Cook–Levin theorem|Cook's theorem]] for the proof). Until that time, the concept of an NP-complete problem did not even exist. The problem remains '''NP'''-complete even if all expressions are written in ''[[conjunctive normal form]]'' with 3 variables per clause (3-CNF), yielding the '''3SAT''' problem. This means the expression has the form:
:(''x''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; OR ''x''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; OR ''x''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;) AND
:(''x''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; OR ''x''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; OR ''x''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;) AND
:(''x''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt; OR ''x''&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt; OR ''x''&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;) AND ...
where each ''x'' is a variable or a negation of a variable, and each variable can appear multiple times in the expression.

A useful property of Cook's reduction is that it preserves the number of accepting answers. For example, if a graph has 17 valid 3-colorings, the SAT formula produced by the reduction will have 17 satisfying assignments.

NP-completeness only refers to the run-time of the worst case instances.  Many of the instances that occur in practical applications can be solved much more quickly.  See [[#Runtime behavior|runtime behavior]] below.

SAT is easier if the formulas are restricted to those in [[disjunctive normal form]], that is, they are disjunction (OR) of terms, where each term is a conjunction (AND) of literals (possibly negated variables). Such a formula is indeed satisfiable if and only if at least one of its terms is satisfiable, and a term is satisfiable if and only if it does not contain both ''x'' and NOT ''x'' for some variable ''x''. This can be checked in polynomial time.

===2-satisfiability===
{{Main|2-satisfiability}}
SAT is also easier if the number of literals in a clause is limited to 2, in which case the problem is called 2SAT. This problem can also be solved in polynomial time, and in fact is complete for the class [[NL (complexity)|NL]]. Similarly, if we limit the number of literals per clause to 2 and change the AND operations to [[Exclusive or|XOR]] operations, the result is ''exclusive-or 2-satisfiability'', a problem complete for [[SL (complexity)|SL]] = [[L (complexity)|L]].

One of the most important restrictions of SAT is HORNSAT, where the formula is a conjunction of [[Horn clause]]s. This problem is solved by the polynomial-time [[Horn-satisfiability]] algorithm, and is in fact [[P-complete]]. It can be seen as [[P (complexity)|P's]] version of the Boolean satisfiability problem.

Provided that the [[P = NP problem|complexity classes P and NP are not equal]], none of these restrictions are NP-complete, unlike SAT. The assumption that P and NP are not equal is [[Unsolved problems of mathematics#Millennium Prize Problems|currently not proven]].

===3-satisfiability===
3-satisfiability is a special case of [[k-satisfiability|''k''-satisfiability]] (''k''-SAT) or simply satisfiability (SAT), when each clause contains exactly ''k'' = 3 literals. It was one of [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]].

Here is an example, where ¬ indicates [[negation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;E = (x_1 \vee \neg x_2 \vee \neg x_3) \wedge (x_1 \vee x_2 \vee x_4)&lt;/math&gt;
E has two clauses (denoted by parentheses), four variables (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and ''k''=3 (three literals per clause).

To solve this instance of the decision problem we must determine whether there is a [[truth value]] (TRUE or FALSE) we can assign to each of the literals (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) such that the entire expression is TRUE. In this instance, there is such an assignment (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = TRUE, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = TRUE, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=TRUE, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;=TRUE), so the answer to this instance is YES. This is one of many possible assignments, with for instance, any set of assignments including ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = TRUE being sufficient. If there were no such assignment(s), the answer would be NO.

3-SAT is [[NP-complete]] and it is used as a starting point for proving that other problems are also [[NP-hard]]. This is done by [[polynomial-time reduction]] from 3-SAT to the other problem. An example of a problem where this method has been used is the [[Clique problem]]. 3-SAT can be further restricted to [[One-in-three 3SAT]], where we ask if ''exactly'' one of the variables in each clause is true, rather than ''at least'' one.  This restriction remains NP-complete.

There is a simple randomized algorithm due to {{harvtxt|Schöning|1999}} that runs in time &lt;math&gt;(4/3)^n&lt;/math&gt; where n is the number of clauses and succeeds with high probability to correctly decide 3-Sat.
The [[exponential time hypothesis]] is that no algorithm can solve 3-Sat in time &lt;math&gt;\exp(o(n))&lt;/math&gt;.

===Horn-satisfiability===
{{Main|Horn-satisfiability}}
A clause is Horn if it contains at most one positive literal. Such clauses are of interest because they are able to express [[Entailment|implication]] of one variable from a set of other variables. Indeed, one such clause &lt;math&gt;\neg x_1 \vee \cdots \vee \neg x_n \vee y&lt;/math&gt; can be rewritten as &lt;math&gt;x_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge x_n \rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt;, that is, if &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; are all true, then ''y'' needs to be true as well.

The problem of deciding whether a set of Horn clauses is satisfiable is in P. This problem can indeed be solved by a single step of the [[Unit propagation]], which produces the single minimal (w.r.t. the set of literal assigned to true) model of the set of Horn clauses.

A generalization of the class of Horn formulae is that of renamable-Horn formulae, which is the set of formulae that can be placed in Horn form by replacing some variables with their respective negation. Checking the existence of such a replacement can be done in linear time; therefore, the satisfiability of such formulae is in P as it can be solved by first performing this replacement and then checking the satisfiability of the resulting Horn formula.

===XOR-satisfiability===

Another special case are problems where each clause only contains [[exclusive or]] operators. Because the exclusive or operation is equivalent to addition on a [[Galois field]] of size 2 (see also [[modular arithmetic]]), the clauses can be viewed as a [[system of linear equations]] and corresponding methods such as [[Gaussian elimination]] can be used to find the solution.

===Schaefer's dichotomy theorem===
{{Main|Schaefer's dichotomy theorem}}
The restrictions above (CNF, 2CNF, 3CNF, Horn) bound the considered formulae to be conjunction of subformulae; each restriction states a specific form for all subformulae: for example, only binary clauses can be subformulae in 2CNF.

Schaefer's dichotomy theorem states that, for any restriction to Boolean operators that can be used to form these subformulae, the corresponding satisfiability problem is in P or NP-complete.  The membership in P of the satisfiability of 2CNF and Horn formulae are special cases of this theorem.

==Runtime behavior==
As mentioned briefly above, though the problem is NP-complete, many practical instances can be solved much more quickly.  Many practical problems are actually &quot;easy&quot;, so the SAT solver can easily find a solution, or prove that none exists, relatively quickly, even though the instance has thousands of variables and tens of thousands of constraints.  Other much smaller problems exhibit run-times that are exponential in the problem size, and rapidly become impractical.  Unfortunately, there is no reliable way to tell the difficulty of the problem without trying it.  Therefore, almost all SAT solvers include time-outs, so they will terminate even if they cannot find a solution.  Finally, different SAT solvers will find different instances easy or hard, and some excel at proving unsatisfiability, and others at finding solutions.  All of these behaviors can be seen in the SAT solving contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satcompetition.org/ |title=The international SAT Competitions web page|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extensions of SAT==
An extension that has gained significant popularity since 2003 is [[Satisfiability modulo theories]] (SMT) that can enrich CNF formulas with linear constraints, arrays, all-different constraints, uninterpreted functions, etc.
Such extensions typically remain NP-complete, but very efficient solvers are now available that can handle many such kinds
of constraints.

The satisfiability problem becomes more difficult (PSPACE-complete) if we extend our logic to include [[second-order Boolean]]s, allowing ''[[quantifier]]s'' such as &quot;for all&quot; and &quot;there exists&quot; that bind the Boolean variables. An example of such an expression would be:
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x\left(\exists y\left(\exists z\left((x \lor y \lor z) \land (\lnot x \lor \lnot y \lor \lnot z)\right)\right)\right).&lt;/math&gt;
SAT itself uses only &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; quantifiers. If we allow only &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; quantifiers, it becomes the [[Co-NP-complete]] [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] problem. If we allow both, the problem is called the [[quantified Boolean formula problem]] (QBF), which can be shown to be [[PSPACE-complete]]. It is widely believed that PSPACE-complete problems are strictly harder than any problem in NP, although this has not yet been proved.

A number of variants deal with the number of variable assignments making the formula true. Ordinary SAT asks if there is at least one such assignment. MAJSAT, which asks if the majority of all assignments make the formula true, is complete for [[PP (complexity)|PP]], a probabilistic class. The problem of how many variable assignments satisfy a formula, not a decision problem, is in [[Sharp-P|#P]]. UNIQUE-SAT or USAT is the problem of determining whether a formula known to have either zero or one satisfying assignments has zero or has one. Although this problem seems easier, [[Valiant-Vazirani theorem|it has been shown]] that if there is a practical ([[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|randomized polynomial-time]]) algorithm to solve this problem, then all problems in [[NP (complexity class)|NP]] can be solved just as easily.

The [[maximum satisfiability problem]], an [[FNP (complexity)|FNP]] generalization of SAT, asks for the maximum number of clauses which can be satisfied by any assignment. It has efficient [[approximation algorithm]]s, but is NP-hard to solve exactly. Worse still, it is [[APX]]-complete, meaning there is no [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]] (PTAS) for this problem unless P=NP.

==NP-Complete Solutions in SAT==

Theorem (Karp-Lipton-Sipser): If NP ⊆ P/poly then PH = Σp2.

Note if NP ⊆ P/poly then SAT has a polynomial-size circuit family.

Namely, for some c &gt; 0 there is a sequence of circuits W1,W2,W3,..., where Wn is a circuit of size nk deciding satisfiability of all Boolean formulas whose encoding size is ≤ n.

Of course, NP ⊆ P/poly merely implies the existence of such a family; there may be no easy way to construct the circuits.

==Lemma (Self-reducibility of SAT)==

There is a polynomial-time computable function h such that if {Wn}n≥1 is a circuit family that solves SAT, then for all Boolean formula ϕ:ϕ ∈ SAT iff h (ϕ, W|ϕ|) is a satisfying assignment for ϕ. (1)

Proof: The main idea is to use the circuit to generate a satisfying assignment as follows.

Ask the circuit if ϕ is satisfiable.

If so, ask it if ϕ(x1 = T) (i.e., ϕ with the first variable assigned True) is satisfiable.

The circuit’s answer allows us to reduce the size of the formula. If the circuit says no, we can conclude ϕ(x1 = F) is true, and have thus reduced the number of variables by 1. If the circuit says yes, we can substitute x1 = T and again reduced the number of variables by 1.

Continuing this way, we can generate a satisfying assignment. This proves the Lemma. (Aside: The formal name for the above property of SAT is downward self-reducibility. All NP-complete languages have this property.)QED

Now we prove the Theorem.

We show NP ⊆ P/poly implies Πp2 ⊆ Σp2. Let L ∈ Πp2. Then there is a language L1 ∈ NP and c &gt; 0 such that L = {x ∈ {0, 1}∗: ∀ y, |y|≤|x|c, (x, y) ∈ L1}. (2)

Since L1 ∈ NP, there is a polynomial-time reduction, say g, from L1 to SAT.

Thus ∀ z ∈ {0,1}∗: z ∈ L1 iff g(z) ∈ SAT.

Suppose further that d &gt; 0 is such that |g(z)|≤|z|d.

Now we can rewrite (2) asL = {x ∈ {0,1}∗: ∀ y,|y|≤|x|c1, g(x, y) ∈ SAT}.

Note that |g(x, y)| ≤ (|x| + |y|)d.

Let us simplify this as |x|cd.

Thus if Wn≥1 is a nk-sized circuit family for SAT, then by 1) we have L = {x : ∀ y,|y|≤|x|c1, h(g(x, y), W|x|cd ) is a satisfying assignment for g(x, y)}.

Now we are almost done.

Even though there may be no way for us to construct the circuit for SAT, we can just try to “guess” it.

Namely, an input x is in L iff ∃W, a circuit with |x|cd inputs and size |x|cdk such that ∀ y, |y|≤|x|c1, h(g(x, y), W) is a satisfying assignment for g(x, y).

Since h is computable in polynomial time, we have thus shown L ∈ Σp2. QED1 [http://groups.google.com/group/sci.math/browse_thread/thread/0e6b38c83b02e3c8#]

==Algorithms for solving SAT==
There are two classes of high-performance [[algorithms]] for solving instances of SAT in practice: modern variants of the [[DPLL algorithm]], such as [[Chaff algorithm|Chaff]], [[GRASP (SAT solver)|GRASP]] or [http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/sat/march_dl.php march]; and [[stochastic local search algorithm|stochastic]] [[Local search (constraint satisfaction)|local search]] algorithms, such as [[WalkSAT]].

A DPLL SAT solver employs a systematic backtracking search procedure to explore the (exponentially-sized) space of variable assignments looking for satisfying assignments. The basic search procedure was proposed in two seminal papers in the early 60s (see references below) and is now commonly referred to as the [[Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland algorithm]] (“DPLL” or “DLL”). Theoretically, exponential lower bounds have been proved for the DPLL family of algorithms.

Modern SAT solvers (developed in the last ten years) come in two flavors: &quot;conflict-driven&quot; and &quot;look-ahead&quot;. Conflict-driven solvers augment the basic DPLL search algorithm with efficient conflict analysis, clause learning, non-[[chronological backtracking]] (aka [[backjumping]]), as well as &quot;two-watched-literals&quot; unit propagation, adaptive branching, and random restarts. These &quot;extras&quot; to the basic systematic search have been empirically shown to be essential for handling the large SAT instances that arise in [[Electronic Design Automation]] (EDA). Look-ahead solvers have especially strengthened reductions (going beyond unit-clause propagation) and the heuristics, and they are generally stronger than conflict-driven solvers on hard instances (while conflict-driven solvers can be much better on large instances which actually have an easy instance inside).

Modern SAT solvers are also having significant impact on the fields of software verification, constraint solving in artificial intelligence, and operations research, among others. Powerful solvers are readily available as [[free and open source software]]. In particular, the conflict-driven [http://minisat.se/ MiniSAT], which was relatively successful at the [http://www.satcompetition.org/ 2005 SAT competition], only has about 600 lines of code. An example for look-ahead solvers is [http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/sat/march_dl.php march_dl], which won a prize at the [http://www.satcompetition.org/ 2007 SAT competition].

[[Genetic algorithm]]s and other  general-purpose stochastic local search methods are also being used to solve SAT problems, especially when there is no or limited knowledge of the specific structure of the problem instances to be solved. Certain types of large random satisfiable instances of SAT can be solved by [[survey propagation]] (SP). Particularly in [[hardware design]] and [[hardware verification|verification]] applications, satisfiability and other logical properties of a given propositional formula are sometimes decided based on a representation of the formula as a [[binary decision diagram]] (BDD).

Propositional satisfiability has various generalisations, including satisfiability for [[quantified Boolean formula problem]], for [[first-order predicate calculus|first]]- and [[second-order logic]], [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s, [[0-1 integer programming]], and [[maximum satisfiability problem]].

Many other decision problems, such as [[graph coloring]] problems, [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning problems]], and [[Scheduling algorithm|scheduling problems]], can be easily encoded into SAT.

A '''Bohemian''' is a resident of the former [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], either in a narrow sense as the region of [[Bohemia|Bohemia proper]] or in a wider meaning as the whole country, now known as the [[Czech Republic]]. The word &quot;Bohemian&quot; used to denote the [[Czech people]] as well as the [[Czech language]] before the word &quot;Czech&quot; became prevalent in English.

== Origin and usage ==
The name &quot;Bohemia&quot; derives from the [[Latin]] term for the [[Celt]]ic tribe inhabiting that area, the [[Boii]], who were called ''Boiohaemum'' in the early Middle Ages. The word &quot;Bohemian&quot; was never used by the local Czech ([[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]) population. {{citation needed|date=March 2011}} In [[Czech language|Czech]], the region since the early Different Ages has been called only ''Čechy'' (&quot;Bohemia&quot;) or ''Království české'' (&quot;Bohemian Kingdom&quot;), and its mainly Czech-speaking inhabitants were called ''Čechové'' (in modern Czech ''Češi''). 

In most other European vernaculars and in Latin (as ''Bohemi''), the word &quot;Bohemian&quot; or a derivate was used. If the Czech ethnic origin was to be stressed, combinations like &quot;Bohemian of Bohemian language&quot;(''Čech českého jazyka''), &quot;a real Bohemian&quot; (''pravý Čech'') etc. were used.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

It was not until the 19th century that other European languages began to use the word &quot;Czechs&quot; (in English &amp;ndash; ''Tschechen'' in [[German Language|German]], ''Tchèques'' in [[French Language|French]]) in a deliberate (and successful) attempt to distinguish between Bohemian Slavs and other inhabitants of Bohemia (mostly [[Ethnic Germans|Germans]]). Currently, the word &quot;Bohemians&quot; is sometimes used when speaking about persons from Bohemia of non-Czech or mixed ethnic origin, especially before the year 1918, when the Kingdom of Bohemia ceased to exist; also when there is need to distinguish between inhabitants of the western part (Bohemia proper) of Czechia, and the eastern ([[Moravia]]) or the north-eastern part ([[Czech Silesia|Silesia]]).

== Other uses ==
The term &quot;Bohemian&quot; as related to [[Bohemianism]] – i.e., describing the nontraditional lifestyles of marginalized and impoverished [[artist]]s, [[writer]]s, [[musician]]s, and [[actor]]s in major European cities – emerged in France in the early 19th century when artists and creators began to concentrate in the lower-rent, lower class gypsy neighbourhoods. The term bohémien was a common term for the [[Romani people]] of France, who had reached Western Europe via Bohemia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

'''Bob Jones University''' ('''BJU''') is a [[private university|private]], non-denominational [[Protestant]] university in [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]], [[South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=vii.}};{{cite book | author = Dalhouse, Mark Taylor | title = An Island in the Lake of Fire: Bob Jones University, Fundamentalism &amp; the Separatist Movement | publisher = University of Georgia Press | year = 1996 | pages = 1–2}}: &quot;The flourishing status of an institution committed to a militant theological and cultural conservatism marks Bob Jones University as worthy of note for observers of American religion.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The university was founded in 1927 by [[Bob Jones, Sr.]] (1883–1968), an [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and contemporary of [[Billy Sunday]]. The current president of the university, [[Stephen Jones (BJU)|Stephen Jones]], is the great-grandson of the founder and the fourth member of the Jones family to serve as president. 

Since 2005 BJU has been accredited by the [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]], an accrediting organization recognized by the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;accreditation&quot;&gt;&quot;Accreditation under TRACS will enable our graduates to realize the benefits of accreditation without compromise to the University's Bible-based philosophy and practices. We waited many years to seek accreditation,&quot; said President Stephen Jones, &quot;and went forward only when we were confident we could attain it without losing our independence.&quot;[http://www.tracs.org/ TRACS website]; [http://www.bju.edu/accreditation.html Press release announcing accreditation]; [http://www.greenvilleonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061118/OPINION/611180306/1008 ''Greenville News'' editorial on BJU accreditation]; [http://www.tracs.org/about.htm TRACS website].&lt;/ref&gt; The university enrolls approximately 4,000 students representing every state and fifty foreign countries. It employs a staff of 1,450, offers undergraduate degrees in over a hundred majors, and conducts precollege education from pre-kindergarten through high school.&lt;ref&gt;''Greenville News'', 20 September 2006, 9A. In 2006 there were approximately 1,600 pre-college students.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the University estimated the number of its graduates at 35,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eternity 2008&quot;&gt;&quot;Investing in Lives for Eternity&quot;, BJU Advancement brochure (2008), 6, Bob Jones University Archives, Mack Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statement and creed==
===Mission statement===

&lt;blockquote&gt;Within the cultural and academic soil of liberal arts education, Bob Jones University exists to grow Christlike character that is Scripturally disciplined; others-serving; God-loving; Christ-proclaiming; and focused Above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bju.edu/academics/edpurpose.html|title=BJU Statement of Christian Education|last=Horton|first=Ron|publisher=BJU.edu|accessdate=2008-05-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080413040042/http://www.bju.edu/academics/edpurpose.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Creed===
&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe in the inspiration of the [[Bible]] (both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and the [[New Testament]]s); the [[Creationism|creation]] of man by the direct act of [[God]]; the incarnation and virgin birth of our Lord and Saviour, [[Jesus]] Christ; His identification as the Son of God; His vicarious atonement for the [[sin]]s of mankind by the shedding of His blood on the cross; the [[resurrection]] of His body from the tomb; His power to save men from sin; the new birth through the regeneration by the [[Holy Spirit]]; and the gift of eternal life by the grace of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bju.edu/about/creed/|title=University Creed|publisher=BJU|accessdate=2008-05-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080215165323/http://www.bju.edu/about/creed/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The creed was written in 1927 by journalist and prohibitionist [[Samuel W. Small|Sam Small]]. Students and faculty recite it at chapel services four days a week.

==History==
[[File:Bob Jones, Sr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Bob Jones, Sr.]], founder of Bob Jones University]]
[[File:Lynn Haven FL Jones College mnmt01.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial plaque at the site of Bob Jones College, [[Lynn Haven, Florida]].]]
Established in 1927 near [[Panama City, Florida|Panama City]], on the Florida panhandle, Bob Jones College moved to [[Cleveland, Tennessee]] in 1933, and to its present campus in [[Greenville, South Carolina]] in 1947, where it became Bob Jones University.&lt;ref&gt;On the move to Greenville see, [[John A. Matzko|John Matzko]], &quot;'This Is It, Isn't It, Brother Stone?' The Move of Bob Jones University from Cleveland, Tennessee, to Greenville, 1946-47,&quot; ''South Carolina Historical Magazine'', 108 (July 2007), 235-256. The former Cleveland campus currently serves as the home of [[Lee University]], an institution supported by the [[Church of God (Cleveland)|Church of God]].&lt;/ref&gt; There have been four presidents: Bob Jones, Sr., 1927–1947; [[Bob Jones, Jr.]], 1947–1971; [[Bob Jones III]], 1971–2005; and [[Stephen Jones (BJU)|Stephen Jones]], 2005 to the present.

From its inception, BJU has been located in the South &quot;but has never had a predominantly southern constituency.&quot; In 2006, the state with the largest number of students enrolled was South Carolina, but many of these were married students who had moved from other parts of the country to attend the University. Other states with large representations in the student body are Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Dalhouse, Mark Taylor | title = An Island in the Lake of Fire: Bob Jones University, Fundamentalism &amp; the Separatist Movement | publisher = University of Georgia Press | year = 1996 | pages = 148–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
The university consists of seven colleges and schools that offer more than 125 undergraduate majors, including fourteen associate degree programs. Although BJU has an unranked and untenured faculty, most University employees consider their positions as much ministries as jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|publisher=BJU Press|year=1997|pages=251–252}}{{cite book | author = Wright, Melton | title = Fortress of Faith: The Story of Bob Jones University | publisher = BJU Press | year = 1984 | pages = 194}}: &quot;Bob Jones University has a scholarly, dedicated faculty who regard teaching as not just a profession but as a Christian calling.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for retiring professors to have served the University for thirty, forty, and even occasionally, fifty years, a circumstance that has contributed to the stability and conservatism of an institution of higher learning that has virtually no endowment and at which faculty salaries are &quot;sacrificial.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Voice of the Alumni'' [publication of the BJU Alumni Association], 1996-2006. In 1993, the CFO Roy Barton said that teachers' salaries were kept as &quot;low as possible in order to offer affordable higher education to Christians.&quot; Barton said he could name &quot;dozens of people who work here for half or a third of what they could be earning on the outside, but they are here because of a desire to be part of the ministry of training young people.&quot; ''Greenville News'', April 18, 1993, &quot;Upstate Business,&quot; 11. In the same ''Greenville News'' issue, Bob Jones III said, &quot;Everyone here is like a missionary.&quot; (10)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
[[Image:BJUSeminary.JPG|thumb|right|Bob Jones University Seminary]]
The School of Religion includes majors for both men and women, although only men (approximately 500 per year) train as ministerial students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/academics/sr/undergrad/divb/ BJU School of Religion Division of Bible]; [http://www.bju.edu/academics/sr/undergrad/divps/ BJU School of Religion Division of Practical Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these students go on to a [[seminary]] after completing their undergraduate degree. Others take ministry positions straight from college, and rising juniors participate in a church internship program to prepare them for the pastoral ministry. In 1995 there were 1,290 BJU graduates serving as senior or associate pastors in fundamentalist churches across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Dalhouse, Mark Taylor | title = An Island in the Lake of Fire: Bob Jones University, Fundamentalism &amp; the Separatist Movement | pages = 148–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university encourages [[church planting]] in areas of the United States where few fundamentalist churches exist, and it has provided financial and logistical assistance to ministerial graduates in starting more than a hundred new churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/resources/cplanting/ BJU website on church planting]&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Jones III has also encouraged non-ministerial students to put their career plans on hold for two or three years to provide lay leadership in small fundamentalist churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=270–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students of various majors participate in Missions Advance (formerly Mission Prayer Band), an organization that prays for missionaries and attempts to stimulate campus interest in world evangelism.&lt;ref name=&quot;studentlife&quot;&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/campus/life/orgs.html BJU Student Life]; ''Collegian'', 24 (February 4, 2011), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; During summers and Christmas breaks, approximately 150 students participate in teams that use their musical, language, trade, and aviation skills to promote Christian missions around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eternity 2008&quot;/&gt;

Although formally a separate organization, Gospel Fellowship Association Missions is the mission board of BJU and is one of the largest fundamentalist mission boards in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfamissions.org/ GFA Missions website]&lt;/ref&gt; Through its &quot;Timothy Fund,&quot; the university also sponsors international students who are training for the ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/giving/students.html BJU website]; &quot;Timothy program offers foreign students Bible training,&quot; [http://www.bju.edu/collegian/index.php?issue=70&amp;article=679 ''Collegian'', April 12, 2007].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fine Arts===
The Division of Fine Arts has the largest faculty of the university's six undergraduate schools.&lt;ref&gt;Of the approximately 350 faculty members listed in the 2007-08 catalog, about a hundred, or roughly 30% taught in the Division of Fine Arts. ''Bob Jones University Catalog, 2007-08'', 341-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Each year the university presents an [[opera]] in the spring semester and Shakespearean plays in both the fall and spring semesters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/campus/fa/cod/ Concert, opera, &amp; drama series,
