==Services==
===Radio===
{{Main|ABC Radio and Regional Content}}
The ABC operates 46 local radio stations, in addition to four national networks and international service [[Radio Australia]]. In addition, [[DiG|DiG Radio]] launched on digital platforms in 2002, currently offering three separate stations.

[[ABC Local Radio]] is the Corporation's flagship radio station in each broadcast area. There are 46 individual stations, each with a similar format consisting of locally presented light entertainment, news, talk back, music, sport and interviews, in addition to some national programming such as ''AM'', ''PM'', ''[[The World Today]]'', sporting events and ''Nightlife''.

[[ABC Radio National]] broadcasts more than 60 special interest programs per week covering a range of topics including music, comedy, book readings, radio dramas, poetry, science, health, the arts, religion, social history and current affairs.

[[ABC NewsRadio]] is a rolling news service, previously known as the [[Parliamentary and News Network]]. The service was established to broadcast federal parliamentary sittings, to relieve the local ABC radio network from this intermittent task, and to provide a news service at other times. The network broadcasts news on a 24/7 format with updates on the quarter-hour. Much of its news content is produced by the ABC itself, however many programs are relayed from the [[BBC World Service]], [[National Public Radio|NPR]], [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Radio Netherlands]] and [[CNN Radio]].

[[ABC Classic FM]] was the ABC's first FM radio service. It was originally known simply as &quot;ABC FM&quot;, and for a short time&lt;!--rather, &quot;until [year] as--&gt; &quot;ABC Fine Music&quot;. Its format borrowed heavily from community stations that eventually founded the Fine Music Network, as well as [[BBC Radio 3]].

[[Triple J]] is the national youth radio network, and broadcasts contemporary alternative and independent music; it is targeted at people aged 18–35. While the network plays music from around the world, it has a strong focus on local artists. Triple J was formerly known as &quot;Double Jay&quot; when it launched in Sydney on 19 January 1975.

===Television===
{{Main|ABC Television}}

Within Australia, the ABC operates four channels. [[ABC1]], the Corporation's original television service, receives the bulk of funding for television and shows first-run comedy, drama, documentaries, and [[ABC News and Current Affairs|news and current affairs]]. In each [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] a local [[ABC News (Australia)|news bulletin]] is shown at 7.00&amp;nbsp;p.m. nightly.

In 2001 [[ABC Television|ABC TV]] launched its digital service.

[[ABC2]], launched in 2005, is a [[digital television in Australia|digital-only]] channel that shows repeated programs from ABC1, as well as some original content including news programs, children's shows, animation, and music shows.

In September 2007, the [[Australian government]] announced a proposal to launch a new digital-only children's channel, to be named [[ABC3]].&lt;ref name=&quot;abc3&quot;&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; An ABC3 channel appeared on television receivers in 2008, as a place holder for the future ABC3 channel. ABC3 was considered by the [[Australia 2020 Summit]] and given as one of the recommendations to the Government. In April 2009, the Government's official response to the Summit approved the idea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New children's channel for ABC |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/04/22/2549866.htm |date=22 April 2009 |accessdate= 12 May 2009| publisher=[[ABC News and Current Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 2009–10 Commonwealth Budget $67&amp;nbsp;million was allocated towards ABC3 as part of the Government's $167&amp;nbsp;million funding increase to the ABC. The channel launched in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ABC Funding Boost 2009–2012 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=12 May 2009 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/media/s2568522.htm |accessdate=12 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the ABC announced its intention to launch Australia's first free-to-air news dedicated channel. [[ABC News 24]] replaced the former [[ABC HD (Australia)|ABC High Definition]] simulcast of [[ABC1]] and commenced broadcasting at 7:30pm ([[AEST]]) 5:30 ([[AWST]]) on Thursday, 22 July 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;broadcastdate1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/13/2952551.htm|work = Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date = 13 July 2010|accessdate =13 July 2010|title = ABC to launch 24hr news channel next week}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tsrannouncement&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title = ABC News 24 will launch on Thursday 22 July | work = The Spy Report | publisher = Media Spy | date = 13 July 2010 | url = http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/07/13/abc-news-24-will-launch-on-thursday-22-july/ | accessdate = 13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online===
{{Main|ABC Innovation}}
An experimental Multimedia Unit was established in 1995, charged with developing policy for the ABC's work in web publishing.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-90s&quot; /&gt; This unit continued until 2000, when the New Media division was formed, bringing together the ABC's online output as a division similar to Television or Radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-00s&quot; /&gt; The division had over a million pages of material published by late 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-00s&quot; /&gt;

In 2001 the New Media division became New Media and Digital Services, reflecting the broader remit to develop content for digital platforms such as [[digital television]]. In addition to ABC Online, the division also had responsibility over the ABC's two digital television services, [[Fly TV]] and the [[ABC Kids Channel]], until their closure in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005 the division oversaw the launch of ABC2, a [[free-to-air]] digital television channel, in effect a replacement for ABC Kids and Fly.

In conjunction with the ABC's radio division, New Media and Digital Services implemented the ABC's first [[podcasts]] in December 2004. By mid-2006 the ABC had become an international leader in podcasting with over fifty podcast programs delivering hundreds of thousands of downloads per week,&lt;ref name=&quot;podcasting&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In February 2007, the New Media &amp; Digital Services division was dissolved and divided up amongst other areas of the ABC. It was replaced by a new Innovations area, to manage ABC Online and investigate new technologies for the ABC.&lt;ref name=&quot;innovation&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===International===
[[Australia Network]], formerly ABC Asia Pacific, is an international satellite television service operated by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, funded by advertising and grants from the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]. Aimed at the Asia-Pacific region, the service broadcasts a mixture of English language programming, including general entertainment, sport, and current affairs.

[[ABC Radio Australia]] is an international shortwave, satellite and internet radio service with transmissions aimed at [[East Asia]] and the [[Pacific Islands]], although its signals are also audible in many other parts of the world. It features programs in various languages spoken in these regions, including [[Putonghua|Mandarin]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and [[Tok Pisin]].

Radio Australia bulletins are also carried on [[WRN Broadcast]], available via satellite in Europe and North America.

===Commercial===
{{Main|ABC Commercial}}
ABC Commercial is the division of the ABC responsible for pursuing new sources of revenue for the Corporation.&lt;ref name=&quot;innovation&quot; /&gt; It is composed of ABC Retail, ABC Consumer Publishing and Content Sales, as well as ABC Resource Hire. ABC retail outlets were established in 1974. All profits from the sale of consumer product and production services return to the Corporation to reinvest in program-making.&lt;ref name=&quot;consumerpub&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this purpose, the ABC established broadcasting orchestras in each state, and in some centres also employed choruses and dance bands.  This became known as the ABC Concert Music Division, which was controlled by the Federal Director of Music – the first of whom was [[William G. James|W. G. James]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Sametz:  Play On, ABC Books, Sydney, 1992; p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;
There are currently six state symphony orchestras:
* [[Adelaide Symphony Orchestra]]
* [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]]
* [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]]
* [[Queensland Symphony Orchestra]]
* [[Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra]]
* [[West Australian Symphony Orchestra]]

The orchestras were corporatised in the 1990s&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-90s&quot; /&gt; but remain under ABC ownership, co-ordinated by [[Symphony Australia]].

== The 'wavelength' logo==
[[File:ABCTV1975.svg|thumb|right|110px|The &quot;wavelength&quot;, or &quot;worm&quot; logo was used 1 January 1975–2001 and on the website until early 2002.]]
The ABC ‘wavelength’ logo is one of the most recognisable logos in [[Australia]]. In the early years of television, the ABC had been using [[Lissajous]] figures as fillers between programs. In July [[1963]], the ABC conducted a staff competition to create a new logo for use on television, stationery, publications, microphone badges and ABC vehicles. &lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-50s60s&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=AusTVHistory: Australian Broadcasting Corporation 1950s–1960s |url=http://www.austvhistory.com/abc/index.htm |publisher=Aus TV History |author=Brooklyn Ross-Hulands |accessdate=4 October 2007 |archiveurl = http://replay.web.archive.org/20081007030333/http://www.austvhistory.com/abc/index.htm |archivedate = October 7, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Memoirs of a Space Engineer – about Doug Rickard | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 19 October 2000 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/slab/memoirs/about.htm | accessdate = 30 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1965]], ABC graphics designer, Bill Kennard, who had been experimenting with telerecording of the [[cathode ray oscilloscope]] displays, submitted a design which was part of the waveform of an oscilloscope. The letters A-B-C were added to the wavelength design and it was adopted as the ABC's official logo. Mr Kennard was presented with 25 pounds for his design.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-50s60s&quot;/&gt;

Since its original introduction in 1965, it has been updated several times, including with the introduction of colour television in 1975. The line was thickened to feature colour in the logo. The 1975 logo is the longest-running logo, with a lifespan of 26 years. In 2001, with the introduction of digital television in Australia, ABC Television adopted a modified version of the logo, featuring a silver 3D look and losing the 'over and under' design. However, despite the launch of this logo, the 1975 logo is still used by the corporation. In July 2002, to celebrate ABC's 70th anniversary, the corporation adopted a new logo across all media. This new logo still used the silver 3D colour, but reverted to its 'over and under' design. The 2002 logo is still in use today.

'''Alexandria''' ({{lang-ar|الإسكندرية}} {{transl|ar|''Al Iskandariyya''}}, [[Coptic language|Coptic]]: {{Coptic|Ⲣⲁⲕⲟⲧⲉ}} ''{{Unicode|Rakotə}}'', {{lang-el|Αλεξάνδρεια}} ''Alexándria'', {{lang-grc|Ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ κατ' Αἴγυπτον}} ''Alexandreia e kat Aigypton'', [[Egyptian Arabic]]: اسكندريه {{IPA-arz|eskendeˈrejːæ|}}) is the second-largest city of [[Egypt]], with a population of 4.1 million, extending about {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}} along the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the north central part of the country; it is also the largest city lying directly on the Mediterranean coast. It is Egypt's largest seaport, serving approximately 80% of Egypt's imports and exports. Alexandria is also an important tourist resort. It is home to the ''[[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]'' (the new [[Library of Alexandria]]). It is an important industrial centre because of its [[natural gas]] and [[Pipeline transport|oil pipeline]]s from [[Suez]].

Alexandria was founded around a small [[Ancient Egypt|pharaonic]] town ''c.'' 331 BCE by [[Alexander the Great]]. It remained Egypt's capital for nearly a thousand years, until the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] in CE 641, when a new capital was founded at [[Fustat]] (Fustat was later absorbed into [[Cairo]]). Alexandria was known because of its [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] (''Pharos''), one of the ''[[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]''; its library (the largest library in the ancient world); and the [[Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa]], one of the [[Wonders of the Middle Ages|Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages]]. Ongoing [[maritime archaeology]] in the harbor of Alexandria, which began in 1994, is revealing details of Alexandria both before the arrival of Alexander, when a city named [[Rhacotis]] existed there, and during the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].

From the late 19th century, Alexandria became a major centre of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centres in the world, both because it profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the [[Red Sea]], and the lucrative trade in [[Egyptian cotton]].

Alexandria was founded by [[Alexander the Great]] in April 331 BCE as {{polytonic|Ἀλεξάνδρεια}} (''Alexándreia''). Alexander's [[Architecture|chief architect]] for the project was [[Dinocrates]]. Alexandria was intended to supersede [[Naucratis]] as a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] center in Egypt, and to be the link between Greece and the rich [[Nile|Nile Valley]]. An Egyptian city, [[Rhacotis|Rhakotis]], already existed on the shore, and later gave its name to Alexandria in the [[Egyptian language]] (Egyptian '''*Raˁ-Ḳāṭit''', written ''rˁ-ḳṭy.t'', 'That which is built up'). It continued to exist as the Egyptian quarter of the city. A few months after the foundation, Alexander left Egypt and never returned to his city. After Alexander's departure, his viceroy, [[Cleomenes of Naucratis|Cleomenes]], continued the expansion. Following a struggle with the other successors of Alexander, his general [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] succeeded in bringing Alexander's body to Alexandria.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Although Cleomenes was mainly in charge of overseeing Alexandria's continuous development, the ''Heptastadion'' and the mainland quarters seem to have been primarily Ptolemaic work. Inheriting the trade of ruined [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and becoming the centre of the new commerce between Europe and the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian]] and Indian East, the city grew in less than a generation to be larger than [[Carthage]]. In a century, Alexandria had become the largest city in the world and, for some centuries more, was second only to Rome. It became the main Greek city of Egypt, with an extraordinary mix of [[Greeks]] from many cities and backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Erskine |journal=Culture and Power in Ptolemaic Egypt: the Museum and Library of Alexandria |title=Greece &amp; Rome, 2nd Ser., |volume= 42 |issue= 1  |month=April | date=1995-04 | author=Erskine, Andrew |pages=pp 38–48 [42] |quote=One effect of the newly created Hellenistic kingdoms was the imposition of Greek cities occupied by Greeks on an alien landscape. In Egypt, there was a native Egyptian population with its own culture, history, and traditions. The Greeks who came to Egypt, to the court or to live in Alexandria, were separated from their original cultures. Alexandria was the main Greek city of Egypt and within it there was an extraordinary mix of Greeks from many cities and backgrounds.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alexandria was not only a centre of [[Hellenistic period|Hellenism]], but was also home to the largest Jewish community in the world. The [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], was produced there. The early Ptolemies kept it in order and fostered the development of its museum into the leading Hellenistic center of learning ([[Library of Alexandria]]), but were careful to maintain the distinction of its population's three largest ethnicities: Greek, Jewish, and [[Egyptians|Egyptian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Culture and Power in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] p. 42-43&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Erskine |journal=Culture and Power in Ptolemaic Egypt: the Museum and Library of Alexandria |title=Greece &amp; Rome, 2nd Ser., |volume= 42 |issue= 1  |month=April | year=1995 | date=1994-04 | author=Erskine, Andrew |pages=pp 38–48 [42–43] |quote=The Ptolemaic emphasis on Greek culture establishes the Greeks of Egypt with an identity for themselves. […] But the emphasis on Greek culture does even more than this – these are Greeks ruling in a foreign land. The more Greeks can indulge in their own culture, the more they can exclude non-Greeks, in other words Egyptians, the subjects whose land has been taken over. The assertion of Greek culture serves to enforce Egyptian subjection. So the presence in Alexandria of two institutions devoted to the preservation and study of Greek culture acts as a powerful symbol of Egyptian exclusion and subjection. Texts from other cultures could be kept in the library, but only once they had been translated, that is to say Hellenized.&lt;br /&gt;[…] A reading of Alexandrian poetry might easily give the impression that Egyptians did not exist at all; indeed Egypt itself is hardly mentioned except for the Nile and the Nile flood, […] This omission of the Egypt and Egyptians from poetry masks a fundamental insecurity. It is no coincidence that one of the few poetic references to Egyptians presents them as muggers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this division arose much of the later turbulence, which began to manifest itself under [[Ptolemy IV Philopator|Ptolemy Philopater]] who reigned from 221–204 BCE. The reign of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]] from 144–116 BCE was marked by purges and civil warfare.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The city passed formally under Roman jurisdiction in 80 BCE, according to the will of [[Ptolemy X Alexander I|Ptolemy Alexander]], but only after it had been under Roman influence for more than a hundred years. It was captured by [[Julius Caesar]] in 47 BCE during a Roman intervention in the domestic civil war between king [[Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator|Ptolemy XIII]] and his advisers, and the fabled queen [[Cleopatra Selene II|Cleopatra VII]]. It was finally captured by [[Augustus|Octavian]], future [[emperor]] Augustus on 1 August 30 BCE, with the name of the month later being changed to ''August'' to commemorate his victory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In CE 115, large parts of Alexandria were destroyed during the [[Kitos War]], which gave [[Hadrian]] and his architect, [[Decriannus]], an opportunity to rebuild it. In 215, the [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Caracalla]] visited the city and, because of some insulting [[satire]]s that the inhabitants had directed at him, abruptly commanded his troops to [[Capital punishment|put to death]] all youths capable of bearing arms. On 21 July 365, Alexandria was devastated by a [[tsunami]] ([[365 Crete earthquake]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Ammianus Marcellinus, 26.10.15-19&quot;&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ammianus_26_book26.htm#C9 &quot;Res Gestae&quot;, 26.10.15-19]&lt;/ref&gt; an event still annually commemorated 17 hundred years later  as a &quot;day of horror.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stiros, Stathis C.: “The CE 365 Crete earthquake and possible seismic clustering during the fourth to sixth centuries CE in the Eastern Mediterranean: a review of historical and archaeological data”, ''Journal of Structural Geology'', Vol. 23 (2001), pp. 545-562 (549 &amp; 557)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 4th century, persecution of [[Paganism|pagans]] by newly Christian Romans had reached new levels of intensity. In 391, the Patriarch [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus]] destroyed all pagan temples in Alexandria under orders from Emperor [[Theodosius I]]. The [[Brucheum]] and Jewish quarters were desolate in the 5th century. On the mainland, life seemed to have centred in the vicinity of the ''Serapeum'' and ''[[Caesareum]]'', both of which became [[Christian Church|Christian churches]]. The ''[[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]]'' and ''Heptastadium'' quarters, however, remained populous and were left intact.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In 619, Alexandria [[Sassanid conquest of Egypt|fell]] to the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persians]]. Although the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Heraclius]] recovered it in 629, in 641 the Arabs under the general [['Amr ibn al-'As|Amr ibn al-As]] captured it during the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], after a siege that lasted 14 months.

Alexandria figured prominently in the [[military operation]]s of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria|expedition to Egypt]] in 1798. French troops stormed the town on 2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory over the French at the [[Battle of Alexandria (1801)|Battle of Alexandria]] on 21 March 1801, following which they besieged the town, which fell to them on 2 September 1801. [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammed Ali]], the Ottoman Governor of Egypt, began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810, and by 1850, Alexandria had returned to something akin to its former glory.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Modern&quot;{{cite |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C0111760/modern.htm |accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1882, the city came under bombardment from British naval forces and was occupied. In July 1954, the city was a target of an Israeli bombing campaign that later became known as the [[Lavon Affair]]. On October 26, 1954, Alexandria's [[Mansheyya Square]] was the site of a failed [[Assassination|assassination attempt]] on [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted Thornton, &quot;Nasser Assassination Attempt, October 26, 1954,&quot; Middle East History Database{{cite |url=http://www.nmhtthornton.com/mehistorydatabase/nasser_assassination_attempt.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Layout of the ancient city===
Greek Alexandria was divided into three regions:
;Brucheum
:the Royal or Greek quarter, forming the most magnificent portion of the city. In [[Outline of ancient Rome|Roman times]] Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter, making four regions in all. The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets, each of which had an attendant subterranean canal;
;The Jewish quarter
:forming the northeast portion of the city;
;Rhakotis
:The old city of [[Rhacotis|Rhakotis]] that had been absorbed into Alexandria.  It was occupied chiefly by Egyptians. (from [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''Rakotə'' &quot;Alexandria&quot;).

Two main streets, lined with [[colonnade]]s and said to have been each about {{convert|60|m|ft}} wide, intersected in the center of the city, close to the point where the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his [[Mausoleum]]) rose. This point is very near the present [[mosque]] of [[Nebi Daniel]]; and the line of the great East–West &quot;Canopic&quot; street, only slightly diverged from that of the modern Boulevard de Rosette (now Sharia Fouad). Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.

Alexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a [[mole (architecture)|mole]] nearly a mile long (1260 m) and called the ''Heptastadion'' (&quot;seven stadia&quot;—a ''[[stadium]]'' was a Greek [[unit of length]] measuring approximately 180&amp;nbsp;m). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where the &quot;Moon Gate&quot; rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern &quot;Ras al-Tiin&quot; quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tiin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbor, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbor.

In [[Strabo]]'s time, (latter half of 1st century BCE) the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbor.

#The [[Palace|Royal Palaces]], filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias, which shut in the Great Harbor on the east. Lochias (the modern Pharillon) has almost entirely disappeared into the sea, together with the palaces, the &quot;Private Port,&quot; and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land [[subsidence]] here, as throughout the northeast coast of Africa.
#The Great Theater, on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by Caesar as a fortress, where he withstood a siege from the city mob after the [[battle of Pharsalus]]
#The [[Poseidon]], or [[Greek temple|Temple]] of the Sea God, close to the theater
#The Timonium built by [[Mark Antony|Marc Antony]]
#The Emporium (Exchange)
#The Apostases (Magazines)
#The Navalia (Docks), lying west of the Timonium, along the seafront as far as the mole
#Behind the Emporium rose the Great Caesareum, by which stood the two great [[obelisk]]s, which become known as “[[Cleopatra's Needle]]s,” and were transported to New York City and London. This temple became, in time, the Patriarchal Church, though some ancient remains of the temple have been discovered. The actual Caesareum, the parts not eroded by the waves, lies under the houses lining the new seawall.
#The [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|Gymnasium]] and the [[Palaestra]] are both inland, near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town; sites unknown.
#The Temple of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]; site unknown.
#The Mausolea of Alexander (Soma) and the Ptolemies in one ring-fence, near the point of intersection of the two main streets.
#The [[Musaeum]] with its famous [[Library of Alexandria|Library]] and theater in the same region; site unknown.
#The [[Serapeum]], the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells us that this stood in the west of the city; and recent discoveries go far as to place it near “Pompey's Pillar,” which was an independent monument erected to commemorate [[Diocletian]]'s siege of the city.

[[File:AlexandriaMap1.jpg|thumb|200px|Location of Alexandria on the map of [[Egypt]]]]

The names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is little information as to their actual position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|The Great Lighthouse]], one of the [[Wonders of the World|Seven Wonders of the World]], reputed to be 138&amp;nbsp;meters (450&amp;nbsp;ft) high, was situated. The first [[Ptolemy]] began the project, and the second Ptolemy ([[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]) completed it, at a total cost of 800&amp;nbsp;[[Talent (measurement)|talent]]s. It took 12&amp;nbsp;years to complete and served as a [[prototype]] for all later [[lighthouse]]s in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder, after the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]].  A temple of [[Hephaestus]] also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole.

In the 1st century, the population of Alexandria contained over 180,000 adult male citizens (from a papyrus dated 32&amp;nbsp;CE), in addition to a large number of freedmen, women, children, and slaves. Estimates of the total population range from 500,000 to over 1,000,000, making it one of the largest cities ever built before the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the largest pre-industrial city that was not an imperial capital.

==Ancient remains==
[[File:Alex Sawary.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman [[Pompey's Pillar (column)|Pompey's Pillar]]]]

Due to the constant presence of war in Alexandria in ancient times, very little of the ancient city has survived into the present day. Much of the royal and civic quarters sank beneath the harbor due to [[earthquake]] [[subsidence]], and the rest has been built over in modern times.

&quot;[[Pompey's Pillar (column)|Pompey's Pillar]]&quot;, a [[Roman triumphal column]], is one of the best-known [[ancient monument]]s still standing in Alexandria today. It is located on Alexandria's ancient [[acropolis]]—a modest hill located adjacent to the city's Arab [[cemetery]]—and was originally part of a temple colonnade. Including its [[pedestal]], it is 30&amp;nbsp;m (99&amp;nbsp;ft) high; the shaft is of polished red granite, 2.7 meters in diameter at the base, tapering to 2.4 meters at the top. The shaft is {{convert|88|ft|m}} high made out of a single piece of granite. This would be 132 [[Cubic metre|cubic meters]] or approximately 396 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://touregypt.net/featurestories/sarapeiona.htm |title=The Sarapeion, including Pompay's Pillar In Alexandria, Egypt |publisher=Touregypt.net |date= |accessdate=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Egyptian pyramids|The Pyramids]] and Sphinx by Desmond Stewart and editors of the Newsweek Book Division 1971 p. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt; Pompey's Pillar may have been erected using the same methods that were used to erect the ancient [[obelisk]]s. [[Ancient Rome|The Romans]] had cranes but they were not strong enough to lift something this heavy. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehrner conducted several [[Obelisks#Obelisk erecting experiments|obelisk erecting experiments]] including a successful attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk in 1999. This followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a 25-ton obelisk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html |title=NOVA Online &amp;#124; Mysteries of the Nile &amp;#124; 27 August 1999: The Third Attempt |publisher=Pbs.org |date=27 August 1999 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Time–Life|Time Life]] Lost Civilizations series: Ramses II: Magnificence on the Nile (1993)p. 56-57&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was plundered and demolished in the 4th century when a bishop decreed that Paganism must be eradicated. &quot;Pompey's Pillar&quot; is a [[misnomer]], as it has nothing to do with [[Pompey]], having been erected in 293 for [[Diocletian]], possibly in memory of the rebellion of [[Domitius Domitianus]]. Beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the Serapeum, where the mysteries of the god [[Serapis]] were enacted, and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient Library. In more recent years, a lot of ancient artifacts have been discovered from the surrounding sea, mostly pieces of old pottery.

Alexandria's [[catacombs]], known as ''[[Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa|Kom al-Shoqafa]]'', are a short distance southwest of the pillar, consist of a multi-level labyrinth, reached via a large [[Stairway|spiral staircase]], and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars, statues, and other [[syncretism|syncretic]] Romano-Egyptian [[Religious symbolism|religious symbols]], burial niches, and [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], as well as a large Roman-style banquet room, where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased. The catacombs were long forgotten by the citizens until they were discovered by accident in the 1800s.

The most extensive ancient excavation currently being conducted in Alexandria is known as ''Kom al-Dikka''. It has revealed the ancient city's well-preserved theater, and the remains of its [[Thermae|Roman-era baths]].

==Antiquities==

Persistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] Society, and by many individuals, notably Greeks proud of a city which is one of the glories of their national history.

The past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered; [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] made tentative researches on behalf of the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898–1899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.

Since the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. [[Cleopatra VII]]'s royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tidal waves, leading to gradual [[subsidence]] in the 4th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underwaterdiscovery.org/Sitemap/Project/Alexandria/Default.aspx |title=Fgs Project Alexandria |publisher=Underwaterdiscovery.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This underwater section, containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist [[Franck Goddio]] and his [[underwater archaeology|team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/203470.stm |title=Divers probe underwater palace |publisher=BBC News |date=28 October 1998 |accessdate=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It raised a noted head of [[Caesarion]]. These are being opened up to tourists, to some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/940333.stm |title=New underwater tourist attraction in Egypt |publisher=BBC News |date=24 September 2000 |accessdate=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spaces that are most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest, where it is practically impossible to get below the Roman [[stratum|strata]].

The most important results were those achieved by Dr. G. Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighborhood of “Pompey's Pillar”, where there is a good deal of open ground. Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense [[catacombs]] and ''columbaria'' have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.

The objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in [[Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa|Kom al-Shoqqafa]] (Roman) and Ras al-Tiin (painted).

The German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of ''Kom al-Dikka'', which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea, or a Roman fortress.

The making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered. The wealth underground is doubtlessly immense; but despite all efforts, there is not much for antiquarians to see in Alexandria outside the museum and the neighborhood of “Pompey's Pillar”.

===Christianity===
After Rome, Alexandria was considered the major seat of [[Christianity]] in the world. The [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope of Alexandria]] was the second ''among equals'', second only to the bishop of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]], the capital of the [[Roman Empire]] until 430. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Church of Alexandria]] had jurisdiction over the entire continent of Africa. After the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in AD 451, the Church of Alexandria was split between the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]] and the [[Melkite]]s. The Miaphysites went on to constitute what is known today as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. The Melkites went on the constitute what is known today as the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. In the 19th century, [[Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries converted some of the adherents of the Orthodox churches to their respective faiths.

Today, the patriarchal seat of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church is [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral (Alexandria)|Saint Mark Cathedral]] in Ramleh. The most important Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria include [[Cyril of Alexandria|Pope Cyril I]] Church in Cleopatra, [[Saint George]]s Church in Sporting, [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] &amp; [[Pope Peter of Alexandria|Pope Peter I]] Church in Sidi Bishr, [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Saint Mary]] Church in Assafra, Saint Mary Church in Gianaclis, [[Saint Menas|Saint Mina]] Church in Fleming, Saint Mina Church in Mandara, and [[St. Takla Haymanot's Church (Alexandria)|Saint Takla Haymanot's Church]] in Ibrahimeya.

The most important [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] churches in Alexandria are Saint Anargyri Church, Church of the [[Annunciation]], [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Anthony]] Church, [[Gabriel|Archangels Gabriel]] &amp; [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] Church, Saint Catherine Church, Cathedral of the [[Dormition of the Theotokos|Dormition]] in Mansheya, Church of the Dormition, [[Elijah|Prophet Elijah]] Church, Saint Georges Church, Church of the [[Immaculate Conception]] in Ibrahemeya, [[Saint Joseph]] Church in Fleming, [[Joseph of Arimathea|Saint Joseph of Arimathea]] Church, Saint Mark &amp; [[Nectarios of Aegina|Saint Nectarios]] Chapel in [[Ramla|Ramleh]], [[Saint Nicholas]] Church, [[Paraskevi of Rome|Saint Paraskevi]] Church, [[Saint Sava]] Cathedral in Ramleh, and [[Theodore of Amasea|Saint Theodore]] Chapel. In communion with the Greek Orthodox Church is the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] church of [[Alexander Nevsky|Saint Alexander Nevsky]] in Alexandria, which serves the Russian speaking community in the city.

Churches that follow the Latin Catholic rite include Saint Catherine Church in Mansheya and Church of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in Cleopatra.

The Saint Mark Church in [[Shatby]], found as part of [[Collège Saint Marc, Alexandria|Collège Saint Marc]] is multi-denominational and hold liturgies according to Latin Catholic, [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]] and Coptic Orthodox rites.

===Judaism===
Alexandria's once-flourishing Jewish community is now almost extinct after the Arab nationalist movement spurred most to leave for [[Israel]], [[France]], [[Brazil]] and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s. The community once numbered 50,000 but is now estimated at below 50.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/12/20/2742246/egypt-plans-to-restore-alexandrias-historic-synagogue Egypt to restore Alexandria’s historic synagogue], (December 20, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The most important [[synagogue]] in Alexandria is the [[Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue (Alexandria)|Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue]].

==Education==
[[File:College saint marc.jpg|thumb|[[Collège Saint Marc, Alexandria|Collège Saint Marc]]]]

===Colleges and universities===
Alexandria has a number of higher education institutions. [[Alexandria University]] is a public university that follows the Egyptian system of higher education. Many of its faculties are internationally renowned, most notably its [[Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University|Faculty of Engineering]]. In addition, the [[Arab Academy for Science and Technology and Maritime Transport]] is a semi-private educational institution that offers courses for  high school , undergraduate level, and postgraduate students. It is considered the most reputable university in Egypt after the AUC [[American University in Cairo]] because of its worldwide recognition from (board of engineers at UK &amp; ABET in USA). [[Senghor University|Université Senghor]] is a private French university that focuses on the teaching of humanities, politics and international relations, which mainly targets students from the African continent. Other institutions of higher education in Alexandria include [[Alexandria Higher Institute of Engineering and Technology|Alexandria Institute of Technology (AIT)]] and [[Pharos University in Alexandria]].

===Schools===
[[File:ISJA.jpg|thumb|[[Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide]]]]
[[File:Lycee Francais d'Alexandrie 2001.JPG|thumb|[[Lycée Al-Horreya, Alexandria]]]]

Alexandria has a long history of foreign educational institutions. The first foreign schools date to the early 19th century, when French missionaries began establishing French charitable schools to educate the Egyptians. Today, the most important French schools in Alexandria run by [[Catholic]] missionaries include [[Collège de la Mère de Dieu]], Collège Notre Dame de Sion, [[Collège Saint Marc, Alexandria|Collège Saint Marc]], Ecoles des Soeurs Franciscaines (four different schools), Ecole Gérard, Ecole Saint Gabriel, Ecole Saint-Vincent de Paul, Ecole saint joseph , Ecole Sainte Catherine, and Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide. As a reaction to the establishment of French religious institutions, a secular (laic) mission established Lycée el-Horreya, which initially followed a French system of education, but is currently a public school run by the Egyptian government. The only school in Alexandria that completely follows the French educational system is Ecole Champollion. It is usually frequented by the children of French expatriates and diplomats in Alexandria.

English schools in Alexandria are fewer in number and more recently established, in comparison with the French schools. The most important English language schools in the city include Riada American school which is one of the most prestigious schools in Alexandria, Alexandria Language School,Alexandria American School, British School of Alexandria, Egyptian American School, Modern American School, Taymour English School (TES), Sacred Heart Girls' School (SHS), [[Schutz American School, Alexandria|Schutz American School]], [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]], &lt;br /&gt;[[Manar English Girls School|El Manar Language School for Girls]] (M.for example,S) previously called (Scottish School for Girls), [[Kaumeya Language School]] (KLS), [[El Nasr Boys' School]] (EBS), and [[El Nasr Girls' College]] (EGC). Most of these schools have been nationalized during the era of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]], and are currently Egyptian public schools run by the Egyptian ministry of education.

The only German school in Alexandria is the Deutsche Schule der Borromärinnen (DSB of Saint Charles Borromé).

The [[Montessori]] educational system was first introduced in Alexandria in 2009 at [[Alexandria Montessori]].

N.B: The most notable public schools in Alexandria include , AlAbasseia High School, Gamal Abdel Nasser High School and [[EL Manar English language School for girls]].

===Airports===
Alexandria is served by [[Borg El Arab Airport|Borg al Arab Airport]] located about 25&amp;nbsp;km away from city centre.

In March 2010, the former airport, [[Alexandria International Airport (Egypt)|Alexandria International Airport]] was closed to commercial operations with all airlines operating out of Borg al Arab Airport where a brand new terminal was completed in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | title = A new gateway for Alexandria  | newspaper = [[Al-Ahram Weekly]]  | url = http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/954/sk1.htm  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The International coastal road. (Alexandria - [[Port Said]])
* [[Cairo–Alexandria desert road|The Desert road]]. (Alexandria - Cairo /220&amp;nbsp;km 6-8 lanes, mostly lit)
* The Agricultural road. (Alexandria - Cairo)
* The Circular road. ''the turnpike''
* Ta'ameer Road &quot;Mehwar El-Ta'ameer&quot; - (Alexandria - North Coast)

===Train===
Alexandria's intracity [[commuter rail]] system extends from Misr Station (Alexandria's primary intercity [[train station|railway station]]) to [[Abu Qir]], parallel to the [[Alexandria Tram|tram line]]. The commuter line's [[locomotives]] operate on [[diesel locomotive|diesel]], as opposed to the [[railway electrification system#Overhead systems|overhead-electric]] tram.

Alexandria plays host to two intercity rail stations: the aforementioned [[Misr Station]] (in the older Manshia district in the western part of the city) and [[Sidi Gaber Station]] (in the district of Sidi Gaber in the center of the eastern expansion in which most Alexandrines reside), both of which also serve the commuter rail line. Intercity passenger service is operated by [[Egyptian National Railways]].

===Tram===
{{Main|Alexandria Tram}}

An extensive tramway network was built in 1860 and is the oldest in Africa.

===Buses===
Public [[bus]]es are operated by Alexandria Governorate's Agency for Public Passenger Transport.

Modern [[air conditioned]] red [[double-decker bus]]es run the length of the Couriche. [[Fare]] (any distance) is 3 L.E. ([[Egyptian Pound]]) ([[£]]0.33), (0.39[[€]]), ([[$]]0.52) ([[January]] 2011).

===Taxis and minibuses===
{{see also|Taxicabs by country#Egypt}}
Taxis in Alexandria sport a yellow-and-black [[livery]] and are widely available. While Egyptian law requires all cabs to carry [[taximeter|meters]], these generally do not work and fares must be negotiated with the driver on either departure or arrival.

The [[minibus]] [[share taxi]] system, or ''[[Share_taxi#Mashr.C5.AB.60_.28Egypt.29|mashrū`]]'' operates along well-known traffic arteries. The routes can be identified by both their endpoints and the route between them:
* Corniche routes:
** Mandara-Bahari
** Mandara-Manshia
** Assafra-Bahari
** Assafra-Manshia
** Al-Sa'aa-Manshia
* Abu Qir routes
** Mandara-El Mahata (i.e. Misr Station)
** Abu Qir-El Mahata
** Victoria-El Mahata
** Mandara-Victoria
* Interior routes
** Cabo-Bahari
** Manshia-El Awayid
** Manshia-Al Mouqif Al Gadid (the New Bus Station)

The route is generally written in Arabic on the side of the vehicle, although some drivers change their route without changing the paint. Some drivers also drive only a segment of a route rather than the whole path; such drivers generally stop at a point known as a major hub of the transportation system (for example, Victoria) to allow riders to transfer to another car or to another mode of transport.

Fare is generally L.E. 1.25 to travel the whole route. Shorter trips may have a lower fare, depending on the driver and the length of the trip.

===Port===
{{Main|Alexandria Port}}

The [[port]] is divided into:

*The Eastern Harbour
*The Western Harbour

==Culture==
===Libraries===
[[File:Poseidon and the Bibliotheca Alexandrina.jpg|thumb|left| The [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]]]
[[File:BA night over.jpg|thumb|The Bibliotheca Alexandrina, a modern project based on reviving the ancient [[Library of Alexandria]].]]
The Royal Library of Alexandria in Alexandria, [[Egypt]], was once the largest [[library]] in the world. It is generally thought to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BCE, during the reign of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II of Egypt]]. It was likely created after his father had built what would become the first part of the Library complex, the temple of the [[Muse]]s—the [[Musaeum|Museion]], Greek ''Μουσείον'' (from which the [[modern English]] word ''[[museum#Etymology|museum]]'' is derived).

It has been reasonably established that the Library, or parts of the collection, were destroyed by fire on a number of occasions (library fires were common and replacement of handwritten manuscripts was very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming). To this day the details of the destruction (or destructions) remain a lively source of controversy. The [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] was inaugurated in 2003 near the site of the old Library.

===Theaters===
* [[Alexandria Opera House]], where Classical Music, Arabic Music, Opera and Ballet are performed.

* The Cavafy museum
* The Alexandria National Museum was inaugurated 31 December 2003. It is located in a restored Italian style palace in Tariq Al-Horreya Street (former Rue Fouad), near the centre of the city. It contains about 1,800 artifacts that narrate the story of Alexandria and [[Egypt]]. Most of these pieces came from other Egyptian museums.
The museum is housed in the old Al-Saad Bassili Pasha Palace, who was one of the wealthiest wood merchants in Alexandria. Construction on the site was first undertaken in 1926.

===Related words===

* '''''al-Iskandariyya(h)''''' (الإسكندرية) (noun) (formal): Refers to the city of &quot;Alexandria&quot;, used in formal texts and speech. Its [[Egyptian Arabic]] equivalent is '''''Eskenderreya''''' or '''''Iskindereyya(h)'''''. ''Iskandariyya(h)'' and ''Eskendereyya(h)'' are different in pronunciation, though they have the same [[spelling]] when written in Arabic. In [[Modern Standard Arabic]], ''Iskandariyya(h)'' always takes the [[Article (grammar)|definite article]] ''al-'', whereas in Egyptian Arabic, ''Eskendereyya(h)'' either never takes  ''al-'' or it does but is then [[elision|elided]] into the main word, depending on one's linguistic opinion; the effect, however, is the same. The optional ''h'' at the end of both of them is called a ''[[Tāʾ marbūṭa|ta' marbuta]]'' which is not usually pronounced, but is always written.

* &quot;'''Alex'''&quot; (noun): Natives of both Alexandria and Cairo who have a certain knowledge of English refer to Alexandria as &quot;Alex&quot;, especially informally.

* '''''Eskandarany''''' (اسكندراني): The adjectival form in Egyptian Arabic, meaning &quot;from Alexandria&quot; or &quot;native Alexandrian&quot; (masc.). The feminine form of ''Eskandarany'' is '''''Eskandaraneyya(h)''''' (اسكندرانية)). The plural form is also ''Eskandaraneyya(h)''. Its equivalent in Modern Standard Arabic is '''''Iskandariyy''''' (إسكندري), plural ''Iskandarīūn'' (إسكندريون).

===Sports===
[[File:GD-EG-Alex-Stade002.JPG|thumb|[[Alexandria Stadium]]]]

The main sport that interests Alexandrians is football, as is the case in the rest of Egypt and Africa. [[Alexandria Stadium]] is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in Alexandria, [[Egypt]].  It is currently used mostly for football matches, and was used for the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|2006 African Cup of Nations]]. The stadium is the oldest stadium in Egypt and Africa, being built in 1929. The stadium holds 20,000 people.
Alexandria was one of three cities that participated in hosting the [[Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations]] in January 2006, which [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] won. Sea sports such as [[surfing]], [[Personal water craft|jet-skiing]] and [[water polo]] are practised on a lower scale.

Alexandria has four [[stadium]]s:
*[[Borg El Arab Stadium]]
*[[Harras El-Hedoud Stadium]]
*[[Alexandria Stadium]]
*El-Krom Stadium
Other less popular sports like tennis and [[squash (sport)|squash]] are usually played in private [[Social club|social]] and [[sports club]]s, like:

===Literature===

Two writers loom large over the modern literature of Alexandria: [[C.P. Cavafy]], the Alexandria-born Greek poet, and the Indian-born Briton [[Lawrence Durrell]], author of ''[[The Alexandria Quartet]]''. Cavafy incorporated Greek history and mythology and his homosexuality into his poetry. Durrell used the cosmopolitan city as a landscape to explore human desires. Of Arabic novels set in Alexandria [[Naguib Mahfouz]]'s ''[[Miramar (novel)|Miramar]]'' is the best known. In the 2000s writers such as [[Jon Courtenay Grimwood]], [[Ki Longfellow]], and Keith Miller have used Alexandria as a setting for [[speculative fiction]].

'''Alexandria''' is a city in [[Monroe Township, Madison County, Indiana|Monroe Township]], [[Madison County, Indiana]], United States. It is about {{convert|46|mi|km}} northeast of [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]]. It is part of the [[Anderson, Indiana]] [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Its population, as of 2010 is 5,145.

Alexandria is served by the Norfolk &amp; Southern Railway with a connector which allows rail traffic to flow smoothly between lines servicing east–west and north–south destinations. In the city are a Carnegie library and Beulah Park of 24 acres (97,000 m²) &amp; home of the Madison County &quot;4H Fair&quot;. The city is located in rich farm country, which produces corn, soybeans, and tomatoes; and is in the [[Indiana]] natural gas region, to which fact it owed its growth as a manufacturing centre. It was one of the principal seats of the glass
industry in Indiana – plate glass, lamp chimneys, mirrors, &amp;c., were once manufactured here. Charles Corydon Hall, a New England engineer, arrived in Alexandria to help manage a steel mill just as its natural gas supply was exhausted around the turn of the 19th century.  Hall stayed to invent the first successful mineral-fiber insulation and built a company to produce it.  For some decades the banner of the local newspaper featured the verse &quot;Alexandria, Indiana/Home of the Rock Wool/Not on the Nile/But just as worthwhile.&quot;  The municipality owns and operates the water-works as well as the city schools. Alexandria was founded in 1836 and was chartered as a city in 1893.

Alexandria is also known as &quot;Small Town USA&quot; and holds an annual festival to honor this heritage.
Famous residents include [[Bill and Gloria Gaither]], winners of five Grammys. Gaither Studios is a very busy recording center for different types of music.  It is especially known for producing Gospel music.

Alexandria is home to what is lauded by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the world's largest ball of paint.  It is also the home of a community band which draws musicians from several neighboring communities.

'''Alexandria''' is a [[city]] in and the [[parish seat]] of [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana]], United States.{{GR|6}} It lies on the south bank of the [[Red River (Mississippi watershed)|Red River]] in almost the exact geographic center of the state. It is the principal city of the [[Alexandria, Louisiana metropolitan area|Alexandria metropolitan area]] (population 147,000) which encompasses all of Rapides and [[Grant Parish, Louisiana|Grant]] parishes. Its neighboring city is [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]]. In mid-2008, the population was 50,236, according to an official estimate by the College of Business Population Estimates Program at [[Louisiana Tech University]].

== History ==
The city of Alexandria, located along the Red River, was originally home to a community supporting activities of the adjacent Spanish outpost of Post du Rapides. The area developed as an assemblage of traders and merchants in the agricultural lands bordering the mostly unsettled areas to the north, and providing a link from the south to the [[Old San Antonio Road|El Camino Real]] and then larger settlement of [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]].

[[Alexander Fulton (Louisiana)|Alexander Fulton]], a [[business]]man from [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]], near [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], received a land grant from Spain in 1785, and the first organized settlement was made at some point in the [[1790s]]. In 1805, Fulton and business partner Thomas Harris Maddox laid out the town plan and named the town in Fulton's honor. That same year Fulton was appointed [[coroner]] in Rapides Parish by [[Louisiana Territory|territorial]] [[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[William C.C. Claiborne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site23.php|title=Fulton, Alexander|publisher=lahistory.org ([[Louisiana Historical Association]])|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandria was incorporated as a town in 1819 and received a [[city charter]] in 1832.&lt;ref name=&quot;citysite&quot;&gt;[http://cityofalexandriala.com/community/coahistory/government.htm Community]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Civil War in Alexandria===

In the spring of 1863, Alexandria was occupied by Union forces under the command of [[Admiral]] [[David Dixon Porter]] and General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]. Porter arrived with his gunboats on May 7. Later in the day Banks reached Alexandria with his [[cavalry]], whose members had marched 25 miles to reach the city. According to the [[historian]] [[John D. Winters]] of Louisiana Tech University, Porter disliked Banks but nevertheless turned over Alexandria to Banks and then departed to rejoin [[U.S. Grant]] at the ongoing siege of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], [[Mississippi]]. Banks posted guards and declared [[martial law]]. Porter left behind the gunboat ''Lafayette'' in Alexandria and posted the ''Pittsburg'' on the [[Black River (Louisiana)|Black River]] to the northeast.&lt;ref&gt;[[John D. Winters]], ''The Civil War in Louisiana'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1963, ISBN 0-8071-0834-0, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, Admiral Porter, back in the area, and General Banks quarreled over possession of Louisiana [[cotton]]. Porter seized three hundred bales of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cotton from various warehouses in Alexandria and stamped it &quot;U.S.N. prize&quot;, referring to the [[United States Navy]]. Porter sent his sailors into the country to search for unginned cotton. After the crop was located, it was brought to Alexandria to be ginned and baled. The sailors also seized [[molasses]] and [[wool]]. Winters writes that Porter &quot;took all cotton wherever he found it, cotton belonging to the Confederate government, cotton belonging to the 'rebels,' and cotton belonging to 'loyal' citizens.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Winters, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

Winters continues: &quot;Banks was furious with Porter when he learned that the admiral was scouring the interior for cotton. Since he had no authority to stop Porter's speculative activities, Banks could only try to beat him to the remaining cotton. Army wagons were sent out in large numbers to collect the cotton. Thousands of bales were brought in by the troops and stored for future shipment. Jealous of the abundant transportation facilities of the army, unprincipled navy men stole army wagons and teams at night, repainted the wagons, and branded the mules with navy initials, and dove deep in the country in search of cotton. . . . &quot;&lt;ref&gt;Winters, pp. 331-332&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal army made itself as comfortable as possible during its long stay in Alexandria. Winters writes that &quot;lumber and tools were foraged, and the men busied themselves by building wooden tent floors, benches, and furniture. . . . Alexandria [was enclosed] with a zigzag line of fortifications.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Winters, pp. 366-367&lt;/ref&gt; While Banks remained in Alexandria in the spring of 1864, Porter was temporarily trapped north of the city because of the low level of the Red River, four feet instead of the needed seven feet to accommodate gunboats.&lt;ref&gt;Winters, pp. 367-369&lt;/ref&gt;

Confederate citizens as a whole were most fearful of the Union. According to Winters, &quot;most [Confederates] had never before seen a Yankee soldier [and] expected the worse from the invader. . . . 'Some cried, some cursed, some whined; and some overcome with fear, hid themselves in the woods, leaving everything to the tender mercies of the army.' Negroes were responsible for much of the plunder and pillage. Negro camp followers and officers' servants roamed the plantations and small farms without hindrance, bringing in their booty to camps each afternoon. . . . &quot;&lt;ref&gt;Winters, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 13, 1864, when the Union decided to abandon Alexandria, the city was set afire despite General Banks' order to the contrary. Winters reports that &quot;burning and plundering&quot; by two Union corps, who set fire to a store on Front Street. Then &quot;a strong wind spread the flames rapidly from one building to the next.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Winters, pp. 373-374&lt;/ref&gt; Banks later claimed that the fire &quot;broke out in the attic of one of the buildings on the [[levee]] inhabited by either soldiers or refugees.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winters, p. 374&quot;&gt;Winters, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; Winters reports that &quot;pandemonium reigned; frightened cows bellowed and charged through the flaming streets; squawking chickens with scorched wings tried to fly out of danger. Hundreds of women, children, and old people ran through the streets, trying to carry a few of their belongings to safety. When the heat became unbearable, they dropped their loads and fled to the levee. Thieves ran from house to house and even along the levee taking whatever they wanted from the shocked people. By noon the most congested parts of town were destroyed. An attempt to blow up a church in the path of the fire only succeeded in helping to spread the flames. . . . &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winters, p. 374&quot;/&gt;

Alexandria faced the overwhelming task of rebuilding with a year of the war remaining. Prices became exorbitant; butter cost $10 a pound, bacon $5 a pound, flour $3 a pound, and a bushel of meal $10. Many of the helpless lived in the forest without food, shelter, or clothing, subsisting on [[blackberry|blackberries]]. All clothing was homespun, and shoes were mostly made of cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Winters, pp. 386-387&lt;/ref&gt; While Admiral Porter expressed sympathy for the suffering Alexandria residents, he declared the &quot;burning of Alexandria a fit termination of the unfortunate Red River expedition.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winters, p. 374&quot;/&gt;

== Geography and climate ==
Alexandria is located at {{Coord|31|17|34|N|92|27|33|W|}}{{GR|1}} and has an elevation of {{convert|75|ft|1}}{{GR|3}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|27.0|sqmi|km2|1}}. 26.4 square miles (68.4&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.6 square miles (1.5&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (2.15%) is water.

[[Image:AlexandriaRitaDamage.jpg|thumb|200px|Alexandria gas station awning damaged by [[Hurricane Rita]]]]

Alexandria is on a level plain in the center of the Louisiana [[Longleaf Pine]] [[forest]]s, in which pine is interspersed with various [[hardwood]]s. A number of small [[bayou]]s, such as Bayou Rapides, Bayou Roberts, and Hynson Bayou, meander throughout the city. In the immediate vicinity of the city, [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[alfalfa]], and garden vegetables are cultivated. The climate is [[humid subtropical]] with some continental influence in the winter. Summers are hot and humid, and winters are mild, with occasional cold snaps. The area receives plentiful rainfall year-round, and snowfalls are rare. Tropical storms and hurricanes do impact Alexandria from time to time, but rarely cause severe damage, unlike areas closer to the coast. In September 2005 [[Hurricane Rita]] affected Alexandria and surrounding areas, causing widespread power outages and damaging the roofs of some structures. The most recent hurricane, Gustav, caused widespread flooding, knocked over trees and power lines leading to power outages, and damaged structures. Some low-lying Alexandria neighborhoods experienced substantial flooding from Gustav with several feet of water in houses.

[[Image:Emmanuel Baptist Church, Alexandria, LA IMG 1165.JPG|right|200px|thumb|Large Emmanuel [[Baptist]] Church on Jackson Street in downtown Alexandria]]

Like many other Southern cities, the largest single religious denomination in the Alexandria area is [[Southern Baptist]]. Large congregations include [[Emmanuel Baptist Church (Alexandria, Louisiana)|Emmanuel Baptist Church]] downtown on Jackson Street and Calvary Baptist off Jackson Street Extension. A significant Roman Catholic population is also  present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/Metro/0220_2000.asp The Association of Religion Data Archives | Maps &amp; Reports]&lt;/ref&gt; This is due in part to the large Catholic [[Cajun|Acadian]] French population which resides in and around Alexandria, many from neighboring [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana|Avoyelles Parish]]. Alexandria is the headquarters for the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Alexandria in Louisiana|Diocese of Alexandria, Louisiana]], which is headed by [[Ronald Paul Herzog|Bishop Ronald Herzog]]

Furthermore, Alexandria has a small Jewish community consisting of two synagogues: Gemiluth Chassodim (Reform) and B'nai Israel (Conservative).

=== Annual cultural events and festivals ===
==== Mardi Gras ====
As Alexandria is at the cusp of [[Cajun]] culture's extension to the north, the city recognizes [[Mardi Gras]] as an official holiday. The annual Mardi Gras parade – occurring on the Sunday before Mardi Gras – on Texas Avenue is a major cultural festivity in the area. Boasted as a true family oriented event, parade goers can enjoy over 20 New Orleans style floats, high school and college marching bands, as well as appearances by local celebrities. In addition to the main Sunday parade, a children's parade takes place downtown on the Saturday before Mardi Gras and another parade known as the Krewe of Provine Parade occurs on [[Fat Tuesday]] itself down Coliseum Boulevard.

Across the street is the [[Bentley Hotel|Hotel Bentley]], built in 1908 by lumberman and local eccentric Joseph A. Bentley. The Bentley enjoyed its heyday during the 1940s and 50s, when top brass military officials like [[General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] enjoyed their accommodations for extended periods. The Bentley, which was closed on December 12, 2004, was once one of only two four-star hotels in Louisiana.

== Government and politics ==
=== Local government ===
==== History ====

Following the Civil War, all public records in Alexandria had been destroyed. On September 29, 1868, the city was granted a new charter with a government consisting of a Mayor, Treasurer, and Justice of the Peace. Nine aldermen represented the four wards of the city – two from each ward and one elected at-large.

In 1912, the [[Lawrason Act]] established Alexandria municipal government in a strong mayor format, where the mayor was also the Commissioner of Public Health and Safety (Police, Fire, Sanitation). There were separate Commissioners of Streets and Parks and Finance and Utilities, elected citywide. The last to hold those positions, which ended in 1977, were Mayor [[John K. Snyder]] (1922–1993), Malcolm P. Hebert, Sr. (1926–2006), and [[Arnold Jack Rosenthal]] (1923–2010), respectively.

==== Today ====
Alexandria has a mayoral-council system of government.  The Mayor serves as the executive branch of the local government. The current Mayor – [[Jacques Roy]] – was elected to office in November 2006, succeeding long-time mayor [[Ned Randolph|Edward Gordon &quot;Ned&quot; Randolph, Jr.]] Randolph had succeeded John K. Snyder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcpr&amp;rqsdta=11070640 Louisiana Secretary of State Official Parish Election Results for Election Date: 11/07/06]&lt;/ref&gt;

The City Council serves as the legislative branch. The five districts of the city are represented on the Council; in addition there are two council members elected to serve as at-large representatives of the city.

The Alexandria  Court has a limited jurisdiction, consisting of the citizens of Wards 1, 2 and 8 in [[Rapides Parish]]. Within those boundaries the court has the power to hear and decide both criminal and civil cases, rule in civil cases and hand down judgment for punishment in criminal cases.

=== Area politics ===

Overall, the people of the Alexandria area tend to be [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]]. Even though the majority typically elects Republicans in national elections, they vote for Democrats in local elections, many of which are not contested by the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}.

=== United States Congressional district ===
From 1913 to 1993, Alexandria served as the seat of [[Louisiana's 8th congressional district|Louisiana's Eighth Congressional district]].  A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] seat, it was held by the [[Huey P. Long|Long family]] for nearly half of its existence, from 1953 to 1987, broken only by the two terms of [[Harold B. McSween]] and three terms of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Clyde Holloway]] of [[Forest Hill, Louisiana|Forest Hill]]. The seat was removed after the 1990 census indicated Louisiana no longer had the population to support it. The district was split among the [[Louisiana's 4th congressional district|Fourth]], [[Louisiana's 5th congressional district|Fifth]] and [[Louisiana's 6th congressional district|Sixth Congressional districts]]. Alexandria is now in the Fifth district and has been represented since 2003 by [[Rodney Alexander]], a Democrat-turned-Republican.

== Education ==
=== Colleges and universities ===

[[Image:LSUA sign in Alexandria, LA IMG 1149.JPG|200px|right|thumb|[[Louisiana State University at Alexandria]] off [[U.S. Highway 71]] south]]

[[Image:Louisiana College entrance gate IMG 1093.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Entrance to [[Baptist]]-affiliated [[Louisiana College]] in Pineville]]

Situated south of the city, [[Louisiana State University at Alexandria]] (or LSUA) is a regional campus of the state's flagship university system, [[Louisiana State University]].  From its establishment in 1959, the campus offered only two-year degrees; students seeking baccalaureate degrees had to commute or move to the main campus in [[Baton Rouge]] in order to gain a four-year degree.  After 1976, students could either commute or telecommute in order to attend upper level courses, including graduate classes.  In 2002, following approval by the Louisiana State University Board of Supervisors and the [[Louisiana]] [[Board of Regents]] the Louisiana Legislature passed legislation allowing LSUA to offer baccalaureate degrees.

A four-year degree is also attainable through [[Southern Baptist]]-affiliated [[Louisiana College]] in Pineville, founded in 1906.

Alexandria also has one of the Region 6 Louisiana Technical College campuses.

=== High schools ===

[[Image:Menard High School, Alexandria, LA IMG 1158.JPG|200px|right|thumb|[[Holy Savior Menard Central High School]] on [[Louisiana Highway 28]] West]]

Alexandria has three public high schools: [[Bolton High School (Louisiana)|Bolton High School]], [[Alexandria Senior High School]], and [[Peabody Magnet High School]]. In addition, there are two private high schools: the Roman Catholic [[Holy Savior Menard Central High School]], and Grace Christian.

The [[Renaissance Home for Youth]] west of Alexandria is a haven for youthful offenders who live in a group-home setting as an alternative to [[reform school]] or adult jail. Since the facility opened in 1973, nearly 12 thousand young people have lived at the home in search of rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://renaissancehome.org/history/|title=Renaissance: Our History|publisher=renaissancehome.org|accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==
=== Roads ===
Alexandria serves as the crossroads of [[Louisiana]]. To reach either [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] or [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]] from the southern portion of the state, the easiest method of travel takes the driver through Alexandria.  Likewise, if a visitor is to head from the northern portion of the state to the [[Cajun]] portions of the state ([[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]] and [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]]), or the greater metropolitan areas of either [[Baton Rouge]] or [[New Orleans]], the easiest method of travel involves driving down [[Interstate 49]] through Alexandria.

In addition to [[I-49]], travelers can follow Louisiana 1 up to Alexandria from Baton Rouge and points south.  Also, Highway 167 could be taken from Opelousas north to Monroe, crossing through Alexandria at one of the few bridges over the [[Red River (Mississippi watershed)|Red River]] in central Louisiana.  Highways 165 and 71 also link Alexandria and points south with the northern portion of the state via the OK Allen bridge.

=== Bridges ===
Three road bridges cross the Red River in the Alexandria area.  They are:

*The '''Purple Heart Memorial Bridge'''. Part of the Alexandria-Pineville Expressway (also referred to as the Cottingham Expressway), it connects [[Interstate 49]] to Highway 167 by crossing the Red River from downtown Alexandria to [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]]. It replaced the Fulton Street Bridge and has six lanes of traffic.  Designed by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LADOTD), the bridge cost $15.9 million in federal and state funds. The northbound portion was completed in 1995, the southbound in 1998.

[[Image:Jackson St. bridge.JPG|thumb|200px|Jackson Street Bridge]]

*The '''U.S. 165 Business Bridge''' (alternatively, the '''Gillis Long Bridge''', the '''Red River Bridge''' or the '''Jackson Street Bridge''') connecting downtown Pineville with the business district in Alexandria. It is a two-lane vertical-lift bridge with a sidewalk/bikepath on either side. The bridge is named after U.S. Representative Gillis Long, who represented Louisiana's Eighth Congressional District. It was built in 1985 to replace the '''Murray Street Bridge'''.
*The '''Oscar K. Allen Bridge''' connecting Highway 165/71 on both sides of the [[Red River (Mississippi watershed)|Red River]]. It is a two-lane K-truss type bridge, named after Governor [[Oscar K. Allen]]. It was built in 1936 to connect Alexandria to the (former) Fort Buhlow.

Former bridges include:
*The '''Murray Street Bridge'''.  One of the first bridges in Alexandria.  A two-lane steel truss swing bridge, it decayed over time, finally being demolished in 1983.  The approach on the Alexandria side was turned into a river overlook as part of the Alexandria Levee Park.
*The '''Fulton Street Bridge'''.  Named after Fulton Street which it connected with Highway 167. Technically part of the Alexandria-Pineville Expressway, it was a four-lane steel vertical-lift bridge.  It was demolished in 1994 to make way for the Purple Heart Memorial Bridge.

There are two railroad bridges over the Red River in Alexandria. One is located near the Buhlow area north of the OK Allen bridge. The other is south of the Purple Heart Memorial Bridge.

=== Mass transit ===
Regional mass transit is handled by '''ATRANS''' (Alexandria Transportation Authority).

For those leaving or arriving at the city by bus, [[Greyhound Lines]] has a terminal downtown.

=== Airports ===
Alexandria is served by the [[Alexandria International Airport (Louisiana)|Alexandria International Airport]] and the [[Esler Regional Airport]] in Pineville.

=== Rail ===
Alexandria does not have a commuter rail system.  The [[Kansas City Southern Railway|Kansas City Southern]] and the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad|Missouri Pacific]] operated train stations in the area in the early part of the 20th century but these have since closed.

'''Alexandria Troas''' (&quot;Alexandria of the [[Troad]]&quot;, modern {{lang-tr|Eski Stambul}}) is an ancient [[Hellenistic civilization|Greek]] city situated on the [[Aegean Sea]] near the northern tip of [[Turkey]]'s western coast, a little south of [[Tenedos]] (modern [[Bozcaada]]). It is located in the modern Turkish province of [[Çanakkale Province|Çanakkale]]. The site sprawls over an estimated {{convert|400|ha|sigfig=1}}; among the few structures still extant today are a ruined bath and gymnasium complex&lt;ref name=&quot;Freely&quot;&gt;[[John Freely]] (2003). ''The Aegean Coast of Turkey''. Redhouse Press, Istanbul, pp.3-8.&lt;/ref&gt; and a recently uncovered stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs&quot;/&gt;

==History==
===Hellenistic===
According to [[Strabo]], this site was first called '''Sigeia''';&lt;ref name=&quot;Freely&quot;/&gt; around 306 BC [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]] refounded the city as the much-expanded '''Antigonia Troas''' by settling the people of five other towns in Sigeia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lendering&quot;&gt;Jona Lendering (2006). [http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexandria/alexandria_troas.html Alexandria in Troas] (from Livius.org). Retrieved 2010-4-15.&lt;/ref&gt; including the once influential city of [[Neandria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewett&quot;&gt;Robert Jewett (2005). [http://www.philipharland.com/travel/TravelJewettTroas.pdf The Troas Project: Investigating Maritime and Land Routes to Clarify the Role of Alexandria Troas in Commerce and Religion.] Retrieved 2010-4-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In its early years, Troas was a port city that supplied the [[Dorians]] with resources and trade. The city was conquered by the [[Helladic]] people and was nearly destroyed. It was rebuilt early in the next century and the name was changed by [[Lysimachus]] to Alexandria Troas, in memory of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander III]] [[Macedon|of Macedon]] ([[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] merely states that the name changed from Antigonia to Alexandria&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Naturalis Historia'' 5:124.&lt;/ref&gt;). As the chief port of north-west Asia Minor, the place prospered greatly in Roman times, becoming a &quot;free and autonomous city&quot; as early as 188 BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lendering&quot;/&gt; and the existing remains sufficiently attest its former importance. In its heyday, the city may have had a population of about 100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewett&quot;/&gt; [[Strabo]] mentions that a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] was created at the location in the reign of [[Augustus]], named '''Colonia Alexandria Augusta Troas''' (called simply '''Troas''' during this period). Augustus, [[Hadrian]] and the rich grammarian [[Herodes Atticus]] contributed greatly to its embellishment; the aqueduct still preserved is due to the latter. [[Constantine I|Constantine]] considered making Troas the capital of the [[Roman Empire]].

===Roman===
In Roman times, it was a significant port for travelling between [[Anatolia]] and Europe. [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] [[Tarsus (city)|of Tarsus]] sailed for Europe for the first time from Alexandria Troas&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul the Apostle|Paul of Tarsus]]. ''[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]'' 16:8-11.&lt;/ref&gt; and returned there from Europe (it was there that the episode of the raising of [[Eutychus]] later occurred&lt;ref&gt;''[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]'' 20:5-12.&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Ignatius of Antioch]] also paused at this city before continuing to his martyrdom at Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ignatius of Antioch]]. ''Ad Philad''. 11:2; ''Ad Smyrn''. 12:1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine===
Several of its later [[bishop]]s are known: Marinus in 325; Niconius in 344; Sylvanus at the beginning of the 5th century; Pionius in 451; Leo in 787; Peter, friend of the [[Ignatius I of Constantinople|Patriarch Ignatius]], and adversary to Michael, in the ninth century. In the 10th century Troas is given as a suffragan of [[Cyzicus]] and distinct from the famous [[Troy]] ([[Heinrich Gelzer]], ''Ungedruckte ... Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum'', 552; ''[[Georgii Cyprii descriptio orbis romani]]'', 64); it is not known when the city was destroyed and the diocese disappeared. The city remains a [[titular see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], ''Troadensis''; the seat is vacant following the resignation of the last bishop in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Cheney (1996-2010).

===Ottoman===
[[Karesi|Karası Turkmens]] settled in the area of the Troad in the 14th century. Their ''[[Anatolian Turkish Beyliks|beylik]]'' was conquered by the Ottomans in 1336. The ruins of Alexandria Troas came to be known among the Turks as ''Eski Stambul'', the &quot;Old City&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freely&quot;/&gt; The site's stones were much plundered for building material (for example [[Mehmed IV]] took columns to adorn his [[Yeni Valide Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]]). As of the mid-18th century the site served as &quot;a lurking place for bandetti&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Chandler. ''Travels in Asia Minor, 1764-65.'' Quoted in Freely, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
By 1911 the site had been overgrown with [[List of Quercus species|vallonea oaks]] and much plundered, but the circuit of the old walls could still be traced, and in several places they were fairly well preserved. They had a circumference of about ten kilometres, and were fortified with towers at regular intervals. Remains of an ancient bath and gymnasium complex can be found within this area; this building is locally known as ''Bal Saray'' (Honey Palace) and was originally endowed by Herodes Atticus in the year 135.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freely&quot;/&gt; [[Trajan]] built an aqueduct which can still be traced. The harbour had two large basins, now almost choked with sand. It is the subject of a recent study by German archaeologists who are digging and surveying at the site. Their excavation has uncovered the remains of a large stadium dating to about 100 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs&quot;&gt;Gina Jacobs (2010).

'''Alexandria''' (''Cathair Alastair'' in Gaelic) is a town in [[West Dunbartonshire]], [[Scotland]]. The town is situated on the [[River Leven, Dunbartonshire|River Leven]], four miles (6 km) north-west of [[Dumbarton]].

[[File:Alexandria, Smollett Fountain - geograph.org.uk - 141466.jpg|thumb|left|Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire]]
As of 2001, the population of the town is 13,444. It is the largest town in the [[Vale of Leven]], the others being [[Balloch, Dunbartonshire|Balloch]], [[Renton, Scotland|Renton]], [[Jamestown, Dunbartonshire|Jamestown]] and [[Bonhill]]; their combined population is over 20,000.

The town's traditional industry, most importantly cotton manufacturing, bleaching and printing, have been phased out. The town was redeveloped in the 1970s with a new town centre layout and traffic system. Local landmarks include the Christie Park, the Fountain (a traffic junction in the town centre, although there has not been a working fountain there for some years),
Lomond Galleries, a former factory with an impressive dome and an even more impressive marble entrance hall and staircase. It was originally built for the Argyll car works. (A carving above the main door is of one such car). After the car factory decline, it was used by the M.O.D. for [[torpedo]] manufacture (which were test fired in [[Loch Long]]) and then in the early 1970s was the scene of the [[Plessey]] sit-in. The town had the curious distinction of having the only unemployment benefit office in Britain with the insignia of King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom]] above the door, until the building was closed and redeveloped as housing, but the insignia was retained. It is also reputed to be the only UK town with a railway station and a [[public house|pub]] in the middle of a roundabout.   [[A. J. Cronin]]'s paternal grandparents owned a pub in Bridge Street.

Alexandria sits on the former [[A82 road|A82]] main road between Glasgow and [[Loch Lomond]]. There are regular bus services on the route and the town has a [[Alexandria railway station|train station]] on the rail line between [[Balloch railway station|Balloch]] and [[Glasgow Queen Street railway station|Glasgow Queen Street]].

'''Alexandria''' ({{IPA-ro|alekˈsandri.a|-|Ro-Alexandria.ogg}}) is the capital city of the [[Teleorman County]], [[Romania]]. It is located south-west of [[Bucharest]], towards the Bulgarian border. The city is situated on the [[Vedea]] River. The city has 58,651 inhabitants.

==Alexandria in 1900==
Its population in 1900 was 1,675.  Its chief trade is in grain, dispatched by rail to the Danubian port of [[Zimnicea]], or by river to [[Giurgiu]].  Alexandria was named after its founder, [[Alexandru II Ghica]], prince of Romania from 1834 to 1842.

      <comment>Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/24.0.252.76|24.0.252.76]] ([[User talk:24.0.252.76|talk]]); The other way was much better, displaying better parallelism between the arithmetic and geometric means. ([[WP:TW|TW]])</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM)''' of two positive [[real number]]s {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} is defined as follows:

First compute the [[arithmetic mean]] of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} and call it {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Next compute the [[geometric mean]] of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} and call it {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}; this is the [[square root]] of the product {{math|''xy''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;a_1 = \tfrac{1}{2}(x + y)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g_1 = \sqrt{xy}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then iterate this operation with {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} taking the place of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} taking the place of {{math|''y''}}. In this way, two [[sequence]]s {{math|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|(''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are defined:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+1} = \tfrac{1}{2}(a_n + g_n)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g_{n+1} = \sqrt{a_n g_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

These two sequences [[limit of a sequence|converge]] to the same number, which is the '''arithmetic-geometric mean''' of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}; it is denoted by {{math|M(''x'', ''y'')}}, or sometimes by {{math|agm(''x'', ''y'')}}.

This can be used for algorithmic purposes as in the [[AGM method]].

==Example==
To find the arithmetic-geometric mean of {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 24}} and {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 6}}, first calculate their arithmetic mean and geometric mean, thus:

:&lt;math&gt;a_1=\tfrac12(24+6)=15,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g_1=\sqrt{24 \times 6}=12,&lt;/math&gt;

and then iterate as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;a_2=\tfrac12(15+12)=13.5,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g_2=\sqrt{15 \times 12}=13.41640786500\dots,&lt;/math&gt;

etc.

The first four iterations give the following values:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! {{math|''n''}}
! {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}
! {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}
|-
| 0
| 24
| 6
|-
| 1
| 15
| 12
|-
| 2
| 13.5
| 13.41640786500...
|-
| 3
| 13.45820393250...
| 13.45813903099...
|-
| 4
| 13.45817148175...
| 13.45817148171...
|}

The arithmetic-geometric mean of 24 and 6 is the common limit of these two sequences, which is approximately 13.45817148173.

==Properties==
The geometric mean of two positive numbers is never bigger than the arithmetic mean (see [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]]); as a consequence, {{math|(''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is an increasing sequence, {{math|(''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is a decreasing sequence, and {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ M(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') ≤ ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. These are strict inequalities if {{math|''x'' ≠ ''y''}}.

{{math|M(''x'', ''y'')}} is thus a number between the geometric and arithmetic mean of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}; in particular it is between {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}.

If {{math|''r'' ≥ 0}}, then {{math|M(''rx'',''ry'') {{=}} ''r''M(''x'',''y'')}}.

There is an integral-form expression for {{math|M(''x'',''y'')}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\Mu(x,y) = \frac{\pi}{4} (x + y) \; / \; K\!\left[\left( \frac{x - y}{x + y} \right)^2 \right] &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''K''(''m'')}} is the [[elliptic integral|complete elliptic integral of the first kind]]:

:&lt;math&gt;K(m)=\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{d\theta}{\sqrt{1-m\sin^2(\theta)}} &lt;/math&gt;

Indeed, since the arithmetic-geometric process converges so quickly, it provides an effective way to compute elliptic integrals via this formula.

The reciprocal of the arithmetic-geometric mean of 1 and the [[square root of 2]] is called [[Gauss's constant]].

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\Mu(1, \sqrt{2})} = G = 0.8346268\dots&lt;/math&gt;

named after [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].

The [[geometric-harmonic mean]] can be calculated by an analogous method, using sequences of geometric and [[harmonic mean|harmonic]] means.  The arithmetic-harmonic mean can be similarly defined, but takes the same value as the [[geometric mean]].

==Proof of existence==
From [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]] we can conclude that:

:&lt;math&gt;g_i\leqslant a_i&lt;/math&gt;

and thus

:&lt;math&gt;g_{i+1}=\sqrt{g_i\cdot a_i}\geqslant \sqrt{g_i\cdot g_i}=g_i&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the sequence {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is nondecreasing. 

Furthermore, it is easy to see that it is also bounded above by the larger of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} (which follows from the fact that both arithmetic and geometric means of two numbers both lie between them).  Thus by the [[monotone convergence theorem]] the sequence is convergent, so there exists a {{math|''g''}} such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to \infty}g_n=g&lt;/math&gt;

However, we can also see that:

:&lt;math&gt;a_i=\frac{g_{i+1}^2}{g_i}&lt;/math&gt;

and so:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to \infty}a_n=\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{g_{n+1}^2}{g_{n}}=\frac{g^2}{g}=g&lt;/math&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Akira Toriyama'''|鳥山 明|Toriyama Akira|born April 5, 1955, in [[Kiyosu, Aichi (town)|Kiyosu]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], Japan&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;&gt;[http://www.anime3000.com/information/creators/toriyama.html Anime 3000 Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;}} is a widely known and acclaimed [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[mangaka|manga artist]] and [[game artist]] known mostly for his creation of ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' in 1984. It is difficult to pinpoint the source of Toriyama's artwork inspiration. He admires [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s ''[[Astro Boy]]'' and was impressed by [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', which he remembers for the great art.&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;/&gt; [[Jackie Chan]]'s early movies had a noticeable influence on Toriyama's stories.&lt;ref name=&quot;AkiraToriyamaInterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.homepagez.com/dragonballaf/inter.htm | title=Akira Toriyama Interview | accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interestingly he also influenced the other famous mangakas like Yoshihiro Togashi, Eiichiro Oda, Masashi Kishimoto, Hiro Mashima and Tite Kubo the writer of [[Hunter X Hunter]], [[One Piece]], [[Naruto]], [[Fairy Tail]] and [[Bleach]] respectively.

== Biography ==
He debuted in 1979 with the story ''Wonder Island'', published in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', and first gained popularity for the [[anime]] and [[manga]] series ''[[Dr. Slump]]'', originally serialized weekly in ''Shōnen Jump'' from 1980 to 1984. In 1982, he won the [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for ''Dr. Slump'' for best ''[[shōnen manga|shōnen]]'' or ''[[shōjo manga]]'' series of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShogakukanAward&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://comics.shogakukan.co.jp/mangasho/rist.html | title=小学館漫画賞: 歴代受賞者 | publisher=[[Shogakukan]] | language=Japanese | accessdate=2007-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Toriyama was responsible for developing ''Dragon Ball'' which was initially serialized in ''Weekly Shōnen Jump''. It became an instant accomplishment—primarily selling over 35,000,000 copies in Japan, ''Dragon Ball'' eventually became a record-breaking best seller with over 120,000,000 copies sold.&lt;ref name=&quot;-&quot;&gt;[http://www.shonenjump.com/whatisjump/jumpartist/jumpart_toriyama.php ''Shonen Jump'']&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the Japanese fame, the series was equally successful internationally as well, including in [[Europe]] (1988), [[Canada]] (1996) and [[North America]].      

Toriyama is mostly acknowledged for his major hit ''Dragon Ball''. This work was one of the linchpins for what is accepted as the Golden Age of ''Jump''. Its success encouraged Toriyama to continue working on ''Dragon Ball'' from 1984 to 1995. During that 11-year period, he produced 519 chapters, collected into 42 volumes. Each volume has an average of 200 pages. Moreover, the benefit of the manga led to three anime adaptations, [[List of Dragon Ball films|numerous feature-length animated movies]], [[List of Dragon Ball video games|several video games]], and mega-merchandising. Though Toriyama had been planning to end ''Dragon Ball'' for a long time, his editors agreed to let him end the manga so he could &quot;take some new steps in life,&quot; as he put it.&lt;ref name=&quot;26-244&quot;&gt;Referenced in ''Dragon Ball'' manga, volume 26, page 244 — ISBN 1-4215-0636-X&lt;/ref&gt; The third anime adaptation, ''Dragon Ball GT'', was not based on his manga; however, Toriyama was still involved in the project by supervising its production, although in a limited way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfavoritegames.com/dragonball-z/info/AkiraToriyama.htm Akira Toriyama] at http://www.myfavoritegames.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dragon Ball'' anime, including installments that followed, spawned over 500 episodes made in Japan, and are produced and licensed for North America and [[Australia]] by [[FUNimation Entertainment|FUNimation]].

Toriyama's clean line and design sense led to jobs designing characters for the phenomenally popular ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series of [[console role-playing game|role-playing game]]s (formerly called ''Dragon Warrior'' in North America). Toriyama has also served as the character designer for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] RPG ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'', the [[fighting game]] ''[[Tobal No. 1]]'' for the [[PlayStation]] (as well as its sequel, ''[[Tobal 2]]'', released only in Japan), and the [[Mistwalker]] [[Xbox 360]] exclusive RPG ''[[Blue Dragon]]''. 

His works after ''Dragon Ball'' tend to be short (100-200 page) stories, including ''[[Cowa!]]'', ''[[Kajika]]'', and ''[[Sand Land]]'', as well as one-shots, like ''[[Neko Majin]]''.

Toriyama worked on a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] called ''Cross Epoch'', in cooperation with ''[[One Piece]]'' creator [[Eiichiro Oda]]. The story is a short [[Intercompany crossover|crossover]] that presents characters from both ''One Piece'' and ''Dragon Ball'' respectively.

Toriyama's studio is called &quot;Bird Studio&quot;, which is a play on his name, &quot;tori&quot; meaning &quot;bird&quot;. Toriyama does almost all of the work in ''Bird Studio''; his assistant does mostly backgrounds. The studio has not been very active over the last few years and has only done occasional one-shots.

In an interview conducted in 2007 with ''Shōnen Jump'', Toriyama revealed that he does not consider what is to occur in proceeding chapters of his stories.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]'': Oct. 2007 issue, page 360&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Toriyama was commissioned by [[Avex Trax]] to draw a portrait of Japanese singer, [[Ayumi Hamasaki]], it was printed on the CD of her single &quot;[[Rule/Sparkle]]&quot;.

== ''Blue Dragon'' ==
Toriyama announced that his help with the making of the [[Blue Dragon#Manga and anime|''Blue Dragon'' anime]] may very well be his final assistance in [[anime]]. In his own words, he said: 
{{quote|The offer to direct an animated version of ''Blue Dragon'' came in February of last year [2006]. [[Studio Pierrot]] approached me regarding it. I knew that Sakaguchi had been working on assembling staff to produce a game, although at the time ''Blue Dragon'' hadn't yet been formally announced. According to the materials, it was to be a fantasy world like ''[[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]'', with a detailed world view and story.
This may be my final anime, I'm a little worried (about it). There's incredible pressure, but at the same time, there's a sense of accomplishment — that it's worth doing. ''Blue Dragon'' will be a masterpiece, not simply because I'm working hard on it, but because the staff is expecting nothing less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/blue-dragon/blue-dragon-toriyamas-final-anime-247955.php|title=Blue Dragon, Toriyama's Final Anime?|author=Brian Ashcraft|publisher=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Blue Dragon'' began airing on [[TV Tokyo]] on April 7, 2007, featuring a different vocal cast than that used for the game. It is scheduled for 51 episodes. On April 16, 2007, [[Viz Media]] secured the license for the anime adaptation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-04-16/viz-media-acquires-blue-dragon-anime|title=Anime News Network: Viz Media Acquires Blue Dragon Anime|accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was originally set be released in both North America and Europe later on in the year, but that did not happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-04-16/viz-media-licensor-for-blue-dragon-anime|title=Anime News Network:  Viz Media Named Master Licensor for Blue Dragon Anime|accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anime premiered in the [[United States]], on [[Cartoon Network (United States)|Cartoon Network]], on March 28, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schedule.cartoonnetwork.com/xmlServices/ScheduleServices?methodName=mainSchedule|title=Cartoon Network's Schedule|accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ursa Major2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Book plate by Sydney Hall depicting Ursa Major's stars]]

'''Epsilon Ursae Majoris''' (ε UMa, ε Ursae Majoris) is the brightest [[star]] in the [[constellation]] [[Ursa Major]] (despite its [[Bayer designation]] being merely &quot;epsilon&quot;), and at [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 1.76 is the [[list of brightest stars|thirty-first brightest star]] in the sky.  It has the traditional name '''Alioth''' (from the Arabic word ''alyat''&amp;mdash;fat tail of a sheep). 

It is known as 北斗五 (the Fifth Star of the Northern Dipper) or 玉衡 (the Star of Jade Sighting-tube) in Chinese.

It is the star in the tail of the bear closest to its body, and thus the star in the handle of the [[Big Dipper]] closest to the bowl. It is also a member of the large and diffuse [[Ursa Major moving group]]. Historically, the star was frequently used in [[celestial navigation]] in the maritime trade, because it is listed as one of the 57 [[navigational stars]].{{ref label|1728|1|^}}

==Peculiarities==

According to ''[[Hipparcos]]'', Alioth is 81 [[light year]]s (25 [[parsec]]s) from [[Earth]]. Its [[spectral type]] is A0p; the &quot;p&quot; stands for ''peculiar'', as the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of its light is characteristic of an [[Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variable]]. Alioth, as a representative of this type, may harbor two interacting processes. First, the star's strong [[magnetic field]] separating different elements in the star's [[hydrogen]] 'fuel'. In addition, a rotation axis at an angle to the magnetic axis may be spinning different bands of magnetically-sorted elements into the line of sight between Alioth and the Earth. The intervening elements react differently at different frequencies of light as they whip in and out of view, causing Alioth to have very strange [[spectral line]]s that fluctuate over a period of 5.1 days. 

With Alioth, the rotational and magnetic axes are at almost 90 degrees to one another. Darker (denser) regions of [[chromium]] form a band at right angles to the equator.

A recent study suggests Alioth's 5.1-day variation may be due to a substellar object of about 14.7 Jupiter masses in an eccentric orbit (e=0.5) with an average separation of 0.055 [[astronomical unit]]s.

Alioth has a relatively weak magnetic field, 15 times weaker than α CVn, but it is still 100 times stronger than that of the Earth.

==Alioth in Military==
[[USS Allioth (AK-109)]] is once of [[United States]] navy ship.

The '''Amiga 500''', also known as the '''A500''' (or its code name 'Rock Lobster'), was the first “low-end” [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[Amiga]] [[16-bit|16]]/[[32-bit]] [[multimedia]] home/[[personal computer]]. It was announced at the winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in January [[1987]], at the same time as the high-end [[Amiga 2000]], and competed directly against the [[Atari ST|Atari 520ST]]. Before Amiga 500 was shipped Commodore suggested that the list price of the Amiga 500 was 595.95 [[United States dollar|USD]] without a monitor. At delivery in 1987, Commodore announced that the Amiga 500 would carry a 699 USD list price.

The Amiga 500 represented a return to Commodore's roots, being sold in the same mass retail outlets as the [[Commodore 64]] to which it was a spiritual successor, as opposed to the computer store-only [[Amiga 1000]].

The original Amiga 500 proved to be Commodore’s best-selling Amiga model, enjoying particular success in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigau.com/aig/sales.html amigau.com - Commodore-Amiga Sales Figures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although popular with hobbyists, arguably its most widespread use was as a gaming machine, where its advanced graphics and sound for the time were of significant benefit.

== Releases ==

In October 1989, the Amiga 500 dropped its price from 499 [[Pound sterling|GBP]] to 399 GBP and was bundled with the ''Batman Pack'' in the United Kingdom. This price drop helped Commodore to sell more than 1 million Amiga 500s in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/a500batman.html A500 Batman Bundle]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1991, an enhanced model known as the [[Amiga 500+]] replaced the standard Amiga 500 in some markets, it was bundled with the ''Cartoon Classics'' pack in the United Kingdom at 399 GBP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/cartoon.html Cartoon Classics Bundles]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amiga 500 series was discontinued in mid-1992 replaced by the similarly specified and priced [[Amiga 600]], although this new machine had originally been intended as a much cheaper budget model, which would have been the A300. In late 1992, Commodore released the “next-generation” [[Amiga 1200]], a machine closer in concept to the original Amiga 500, but featuring significant technical improvements. Despite this, neither the A1200 nor the A600 replicated the commercial success of its predecessor as, by this time, the market was definitively shifting from the [[home computer]] platforms of the past to commodity [[Wintel]] [[IBM PC compatible|PCs]] and the new &quot;low-cost&quot; [[Macintosh Classic]], [[Macintosh LC|LC]] and [[IIsi]] models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/commodore.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical description ==

Like its predecessor, the Amiga 500 uses a [[Motorola 68000]] microprocessor running at 7.15909 [[MHz]] in the [[NTSC]] version or 7.09379&amp;nbsp;MHz in the [[PAL]] version. While the 68000 is a 32-bit chip internally, it has a 16-bit data bus and 24-bit address bus, providing a maximum of 16 [[megabyte|MB]] [[address space]]. Also like the Amiga 1000, the 500 uses the [[Original Amiga chipset|OCS]] chipset. Graphics can be of arbitrary dimensions, resolution and colour depth, even on the same screen. Without using overscan, the graphics can be 320 or 640 pixels wide by 200 (NTSC standard) /256 (PAL standard) or 400 (NTSC [[Interlaced video|interlace]])/512 (PAL [[Interlaced video|interlace]] mode) pixels tall. Overscan mode enabled 704 x 484 resolution in NTSC machines.&lt;ref name=&quot;displaysize&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Peck|first1 = Robert|last2 = Deyl|first2 = Susan|last3 = Miner|first3 = Jay|last4 = Raymond|first4 = Chris|title = Amiga hardware reference manual|publisher = [[Addison Wesley]]|year = 1986|month = September|page = 72|isbn = 0-201-11077-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Planar (computer graphics)|Planar]] graphics are used, with up to 5 bitplanes (4 in hires), allowing 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 colour screens, from a palette of 4096 colours. Two special graphics modes were also included: Extra HalfBrite, which used a 6th bitplane as a mask that halved the brightness of any colour seen, and [[Hold And Modify]] (HAM), which allowed all 4096 colours on screen at once.&lt;ref name=&quot;bitplanes&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Peck|first1 = Robert|last2 = Deyl|first2 = Susan|last3 = Miner|first3 = Jay|last4 = Raymond|first4 = Chris|title = Amiga hardware reference manual|publisher = [[Addison Wesley]]|year = 1986|month = September|page = 37|isbn = 0-201-11077-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later revisions of the chipset made [[PAL]]/[[NTSC]] mode switchable in software. Sound is 4 hardware-mixed channels of 8-bit PCM sound at up to {{nowrap|28 kHz}}. The hardware channels had independent volumes (65 levels) and sampling rates, and mixed down to two fully left and fully right stereo outputs. Each channel is designated another channel for which it can optionally modulate both volume and frequency using its own output. A software controllable low-pass audio filter is also included. The machine came standard with 512 [[kilobyte|kB]] of [[Chip RAM]] and  [[AmigaOS]] 1.2 or 1.3. One double-density [[floppy disk drive]] is included, which is completely programmable and thus can read 720 kB [[IBM PC]] disks, 880 kB standard Amiga disks, and up to 984 kB with custom formatting (such as Klaus Deppich’s [http://aminet.net/package/disk/misc/Diskspr3 diskspare.device]). Breaking with the Amiga 1000, and in keeping with the home computer tradition established by the VIC-20 and C64, the Amiga 500 had its keyboard integrated with the CPU unit, although the floppy disk drive is also integrated, unlike the 8-bit models. The 500 used the standard Amiga two-button mouse.

Despite the lack of [[Amiga Zorro II|Amiga 2000-compatible internal expansion slots]], there are many ports and expansion options. There are two [[Atari 2600]] [[D-subminiature|DE9M]] sockets for [[joystick]]s or [[Mouse (computing)|mice]], stereo audio ([[RCA connector]]s 1&amp;nbsp;V [[Peak-to-peak|p-p]]). There is a floppy drive port for daisy-chaining up to 3 extra floppy disk drives via an DB23F connector.&lt;ref name = &quot;gbwxgm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Hi Res Version, Rear of Amiga 500 - 122K|url=http://amigahardware.mariomisic.de/download_photos/a500_4_big.jpg}} 070728 amigahardware.mariomisic.de&lt;/ref&gt; The then-standard [[RS-232]] serial port (DB25M) and [[Centronics]] [[parallel port]] (DB25F) is also included. The power supply is ({{nowrap|+5 V}} , {{nowrap|+/-12 V}}).&lt;ref name = &quot;itgehi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Amiga 500/600/1200 Power Connector|url=http://www.ntrautanen.fi/computers/hardware/misc/a500_power.htm}} 070808 ntrautanen.fi&lt;/ref&gt;
The Amiga 500's graphics are output in analogue [[RGB color model|RGB]] {{nowrap|50 [[hertz|Hz]]}} [[PAL]] and {{nowrap|60 Hz}} [[NTSC]] video output, provided on an Amiga-specific DB23M video connector. It can drive video with {{nowrap|15,750 Hz}} [[Synchronization|HSync]] for standard Amiga video modes but this is not compatible with most VGA monitors. A [[Multisync monitor]] is required for some higher resolutions. This connection can also be [[genlock]]ed to an external video signal. An [[RF modulator|RF adapter]] was bundled with the machine to provide output on regular [[television]]s. Monochrome video is available via an [[RCA connector]]. There is a [[Zorro II]] bus expansion on the left side behind a plastic cover and a trapdoor slot under the machine, for RAM expansion and [[real-time clock]].

Somewhat unusually for a budget machine, all chips are socketed rather than [[Through-hole technology|through-hole]] soldered&lt;!-- smd not widely in use at the time! http://www.flickr.com/photos/nike6/2261086708/--&gt; so if the casing is opened up (voiding the warranty), they can be replaced by hand. The CPU can be upgraded to a [[Motorola 68010|68010]] directly or to a [[Motorola 68020|68020]], [[Motorola 68030|68030]] or [[Motorola 68040|68040]] via the side expansion slot. The Chip RAM can be upgraded to {{nowrap|1 [[megabyte|MB]]}} directly on the motherboard, provided a [[Fat Agnus]] chip is also installed to support it. In fact, all the custom chips can be upgraded to the [[Extended chip set|ECS]] chipset. 512 kB of “Slow RAM” or “Trapdoor RAM” can be added via the trapdoor expansion. Such upgrades usually also included a battery-backed clock. If further expansion is desired, up to 8 MB of “Fast RAM” can be added via the side expansion slot. Hard drive and other peripherals can also be added via the side expansion slot. So many options vying for one expansion slot can have made for difficult choices, but several companies provided combined CPU, memory and hard drive upgrades, or provided a pass-through expansion slot so multiple devices can be chained.  Expansions are configured automatically by [[AutoConfig]] software, so multiple pieces of hardware did not conflict with each other. The Amiga is [[plug and play]].

== Technical specifications ==
[[Image:Amiga 1.3 and disks.jpg|thumb|right|The standard Amiga 500 requires floppies to boot]]
* [[Original Amiga chipset|OCS]] (1.2 &amp; 1.3 models) or [[Amiga Enhanced Chip Set|ECS]] (500+ 2.04 models) chipset. Later revisions of the chipset made [[PAL]]/[[NTSC]] mode switchable in software.
** Graphics can be of arbitrary dimensions, resolution and colour depth, even on the same screen.
** Without using overscan, the graphics can be 320 or 640 pixels wide by 200/256 or 400/512 pixels tall.
** [[Planar (computer graphics)|Planar]] graphics are used, with up to 5 bitplanes (4 in hires), allowing 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 colour screens, from a palette of 4096 colours. Two special graphics modes where also included: Extra HalfBrite, which used a 6th bitplane as a mask that halved the brightness of any colour seen, and [[Hold And Modify]] (HAM), which allowed all 4096 colours on screen at once.
** [[Rhett Anderson]] developed the so called ''Sliced HAM'' or ''SHM'' mode, which was a standard 32-color mode, but used the [[Original_Amiga_chipset#Copper|Copper]] (part of the Agnus chip which could change hardware registers at given screen positions) to reprogram the color palette registers at each scanline. The advantage of SHM files was the ability to display all 4096 colors while eliminating the color blur of HAM compression.
** Sound is 4 hardware-mixed channels of 8-bit sound at up to {{nowrap|28 kHz}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Amiga 500|work=OldComputers.com| url=http://www.old-computers.com/MUSEUM/computer.asp?c=65&amp;st=1| accessdate=December 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardware channels had independent volumes (65 levels) and sampling rates, and mixed down to two fully left and fully right stereo outputs. A software controllable low-pass audio filter is also included.
* 512 [[kilobyte|kB]] of [[Chip RAM]].
* [[AmigaOS]] 1.2 or 1.3
* One double-density [[floppy disk drive]] is buillt in, which is completely programmable and thus can read {{nowrap|720 kB}} [[IBM PC]] disks, {{nowrap|880 kB}} standard Amiga disks, and up to {{nowrap|984 kB}} with custom formatting (such as Klaus Deppich’s [http://aminet.net/package/disk/misc/Diskspr3 diskspare.device]). Uses {{nowrap|300 rpm}} and {{nowrap|250 kbit/s}}.
* Built in keyboard.
* A two-button mouse is included.

* A standard [[RS-232]] serial port (DB25M).
* A [[parallel port]] (DB25F).
* Power inlet ({{nowrap|+5 V}} , {{nowrap|+/-12 V}}).&lt;ref name = &quot;itgehi&quot;/&gt;
* Analogue [[RGB]] 50 [[hertz|Hz]] [[PAL]] and {{nowrap|60 Hz}} [[NTSC]] video output, provided on an Amiga-specific [[DB23]]M [[Amiga video connector|video connector]]. Can drive video with {{nowrap|15,750 Hz}} [[Synchronization|HSync]] for standard Amiga video modes. This is not compatible with most [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] monitors. A [[Multisync monitor]] is required for some higher resolutions. This connection can also be [[genlock]]ed to an external video signal. An [[RF modulator|RF adapter]] (A520) was bundled with the machine to provide output on regular [[television]]s. A digital 16 colour Red-Green-Blue-Intensity signal is available too on the same connector.
* Monochrome video via an [[RCA connector]].
* [[Zorro II]] bus expansion on the left side behind a plastic cover.

* Likewise, all the custom chips can be upgraded to the [[Extended chip set|ECS]] chipset.
* 512 kB of “Slow RAM” or “Trapdoor RAM” can be added via the trapdoor expansion. Such upgrades usually also included a battery-backed clock.
* Up to 8 MB of “Fast RAM” can be added via the side expansion slot.
* Hard drive and other peripherals can be added via the side expansion slot.
* Several companies provided combined CPU, memory and hard drive upgrades, or provided chainable expansions, as there is only one side expansion slot.
* Expansions are configured automatically by [[AutoConfig]] software, so multiple pieces of hardware did not conflict with each other.

The '''A1000''', or  [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[Amiga]] 1000, was Commodore's initial Amiga [[personal computer]], introduced on July 23, 1985 at the [[Lincoln Center]] in [[New York City]]. 
Machines began shipping in September with a base configuration of 256 kB of [[Random access memory|RAM]] at the retail price of 1,295 USD. A {{convert|13|in|mm|adj=on}} analog [[RGB]] monitor was available for around 300 USD bringing the price of a complete Amiga system to 1,595 USD. Before the release of the [[Amiga 500]] and [[Amiga 2000|A2000]] models in 1987, the A1000 was simply called '''Amiga'''. 

In the US, the A1000 was marketed as '''The Amiga from Commodore''', however the Commodore logo was omitted from the casing. Additionally the Amiga 1000 was exclusively sold in computer stores, rather than the various non computer-dedicated department and toy stores the [[VIC20]] and [[Commodore 64]] were retailed in. These measures were an effort to avoid Commodore's &quot;toy-store&quot; computer image created during the [[Jack Tramiel|Tramiel]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=technology&amp;res=9A01EFDC1038F93AA1575BC0A962948260&amp;scp=5&amp;sq=amiga&amp;st=nyt | title = Amiga's High-Tech Gamble | accessdate = 2008-04-11 | first = Susan | last = Chira | work = New York Times, August 29, 1984 | date=1984-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Starfire | first=Brian | title=Commodore in tough market with new personal computer | newspaper=The Evening Independent (Dallas Morning News) | date=September 13, 1985| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19850913&amp;id=5-cLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZFkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5279,3001216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The A1000 had a number of characteristics that distinguished it from later Amigas: It was the only model to feature the short-lived Amiga &quot;checkmark&quot; logo on its case; the case was elevated slightly to give a storage area for the keyboard when not in use (a &quot;keyboard garage&quot;); and the inside of the case was engraved with the signatures of the Amiga designers, including [[Jay Miner]], and the paw print of his dog Mitchy. The A1000's case was designed by [[Howard Stolz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/classes/ism101/Winter05/abstracts/week1.html | title=ISM 101 Seminar: 13 January 2005 | work=USCS Engineering | accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Senior Industrial Designer at Commodore, Stolz was the mechanical lead and primary interface with [[Sanyo]] in Japan, the contract manufacturer for the A1000 casing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/howardstolz | title=Howard Stolz profile | work=Howard Stolz LinkedIn profile | accessdate=2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[AmigaOS]] was rather [[computer bug|buggy]] at the time of the A1000's release, the OS was not placed in ROM. Instead, the A1000 included a [[daughterboard]] with 256&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of RAM, dubbed the &quot;Writable Control Store&quot; (WCS), into which the core of the operating system was loaded from floppy disk (this portion of the operating system was known as the &quot;Kickstart&quot;). The WCS was write-protected after loading, and system resets did not require a reload of the WCS. In Europe the WCS was often referred to as WOM (Write Once Memory) rather than the more conventional ROM (Read Only Memory).

Many A1000 owners remained attached to their machines long after newer models rendered the units technically obsolete, and it attracted numerous aftermarket upgrades. Many CPU upgrades that plugged into the [[Motorola 68000]] socket functioned in the A1000. Additionally, a line of products called the ''Rejuvenator'' series allowed the use of newer chipsets in the A1000, and an [[Australia]]n-designed replacement A1000 motherboard called ''The Phoenix'' utilized the same chipset as the A3000 and added an A2000-compatible video slot and onboard [[SCSI]] controller.

In 2006 [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] rated the Amiga 1000 as the 7th greatest PC of all time [http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,126692-page,8-c,systems/article.html]. In 2007 it was rated by the same magazine as the 37th best tech product of all time [http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,130207-page,9-c,technology/article.html]. In 1994, as Commodore filed for bankruptcy, [[Byte magazine]] called the Amiga 1000 &quot;the first [[multimedia computer]]... so far ahead of its time that almost nobody--including Commodore's marketing department--could fully articulate what it was all about.&quot;[http://www.byte.com/art/9408/sec14/art1.htm]

==Technical information==
The Amiga 1000 had a 7.15909&amp;nbsp;MHz 68000 CPU (7.09&amp;nbsp;MHz for [[PAL]] machines). This is precisely double the 3.58&amp;nbsp;MHz NTSC color carrier frequency, and was needed by the Amiga chipset when outputting [[NTSC]] video. All frequencies in the Amiga 1000 are derived from this frequency as it simplified [[glue logic]] and allowed the Amiga 1000 to make do with a single cheap mass-produced [[crystal oscillator|crystal]].  The chipset was also designed to synchronize all operations so the hardware always ran in 100% real-time without any wait-state delays.

Though most units were sold with an analog [[RGB]] monitor, the A1000 also had a built-in [[composite video]] output which allowed the computer to be connected directly to a [[TV]] or [[VCR]]. 

A direct replacement of the standard 7&amp;nbsp;MHz 68000 CPU with a [[68010]] CPU is possible, with the 68010 executes instructions slightly faster than the 68000, however the conversion also introduces a small degree of software incompatibility.  An Expansion card, plugging into the CPU socket, became available that has both the original 68000 and a faster 14&amp;nbsp;MHz 68020/68881 and built-in memory that's mostly compatible and can be switched back to the 68000 for 100% compatibility.  A similar 33&amp;nbsp;MHz 68030/68882 accelerator board was also available. For the 68020 boards most had a socket for the removed 68000 to be plugged into, the 68030 cards usually had a 68000 already on board.  Expansion box options were also available including a Zorro-I bus expander which gave you two Zorro-II slots.

==The two versions of the A1000==
There were two versions of the Amiga 1000. The first one was sold only in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], had a [[NTSC]] display and lacked the [[Halfbrite mode|EHB video mode]] which all other models of the Amiga had. Later units of this version would had the EHB mode built in. The second one had a [[PAL]] display and the EHB video mode, and was built in [[Germany]].

[[File:Asymptote02.png|right|thumb|200px|A curve intersecting an asymptote infinitely many times.]]
In [[analytic geometry]], an '''asymptote''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|æ|s|ɪ|m|p|t|oʊ|t}}) of a [[curve]] is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as they tend to infinity. Some sources include the requirement that the curve may not cross the line infinitely often, but this is unusual for modern authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rowdy.mscd.edu/~talmanl/PDFs/APCalculus/OnAsymptotes.pdf &quot;Asymptotes&quot; by Louis A. Talman]&lt;/ref&gt; In some contexts, such as [[algebraic geometry]], an asymptote is defined as a line which is [[tangent]] to a curve at infinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An elementary treatise on the differential calculus|chapter=Asymptotes|first=Benjamin|last=Williamson|url=http://books.google.com/?id=znsXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=241|year=1899}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Jeffrey|last=Nunemacher|title=Asymptotes, Cubic Curves, and the Projective Plane|journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=72|issue=3|year=1999|pages=183–192|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2690881|doi=10.2307/2690881}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word asymptote is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]]  ''asymptotos'' which means &quot;not falling together,&quot; from ἀ [[abessive case|priv.]] + σύν &quot;together&quot; + πτωτ-ός &quot;fallen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', second edition, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced by [[Apollonius of Perga]] in his work on [[conic sections]], but in contrast to its modern meaning, he used it to mean any line that does not intersect the given curve.&lt;ref&gt;D.E. Smith, ''History of Mathematics, vol 2'' Dover (1958) p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; 

For curves given by the graph of a function {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'')}}, there are potentially three kinds of asymptotes: ''horizontal'', ''vertical'' and ''oblique'' asymptotes.  Horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as ''x'' tends to {{nowrap|+&amp;infin; or &amp;minus;&amp;infin;.}}  Vertical asymptotes are vertical lines near which the function grows without bound.

More generally, one curve is a ''curvilinear asymptote'' of another (as opposed to a ''linear asymptote'') if the distance between the two curves tends to zero as they tend to infinity, although usually the term ''asymptote'' by itself is reserved for linear asymptotes.  Asymptotes convey much of the information about the behavior of curves ''in the large'', and determining the asymptotes of a function is an important step in sketching its graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Apostol | first1=Tom M. | author1-link=Tom M. Apostol | title=Calculus, Vol. 1: One-Variable Calculus with an Introduction to Linear Algebra | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | location=New York | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0-471-00005-1 | year=1967}}, §4.18.&lt;/ref&gt;  The study of asymptotes of functions, construed in a broad sense, forms a part of the subject of [[asymptotic analysis]].

==A simple example==
[[File:Hyperbola one over x.svg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\tfrac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; graphed on [[Cartesian coordinates]]. The ''x'' and ''y''-axes are the asymptotes.]]
The idea that a curve may come arbitrarily close to a line without actually becoming the same may seem counter to everyday experience. The representations of a line and a curve as marks on a piece of paper or as pixels on a computer screen have a positive width. So if they were to be extended far enough they would seem to merge together, at least as far as the eye could discern. But these are physical representations of the corresponding mathematical entities; the line and the curve are idealized concepts whose width is 0 (see [[Line (geometry)|Line]]). Therefore the understanding of the idea of an asymptote requires an effort of reason rather than experience.

Consider the graph of the equation ''y''=1/''x'' shown to the right. The coordinates of the points on the curve are of the form (''x'',&amp;nbsp;1/''x'') where ''x'' is a number other than 0. For example, the graph contains the points (1,&amp;nbsp;1), (2,&amp;nbsp;0.5), (5,&amp;nbsp;0.2), (10,&amp;nbsp;0.1), …. As the values of ''x'' become larger and larger, say 100, 1000, 10,000 …, putting them far to the right of the illustration, the corresponding values of ''y'', .01, .001, .0001, …, become infinitesimal relative to the scale shown. But no matter how large ''x'' becomes, its reciprocal 1/''x'' is never 0, so the curve never actually touches the ''x''-axis. Similarly, as the values of ''x'' become smaller and smaller, say .01, .001, .0001, …, making them infinitesimal relative to the scale shown, the corresponding values of ''y'', 100, 1000, 10,000 …, become larger and larger. So the curve extends farther and farther upward as it comes closer and closer to the ''y''-axis. Thus, both the ''x'' and ''y''-axes are asymptotes of the curve. These ideas are part of the basis of concept of a [[Limit of a function|limit]] in mathematics, and this connection is explained more fully below.&lt;ref&gt;Reference for section: [http://books.google.com/books?id=HTwi2M37rQAC&amp;pg=PA541 &quot;Asymptote&quot;] [[Penny Cyclopædia|''The Penny Cyclopædia'']] vol. 2, The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (1841) Charles Knight and Co., London p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asymptotes of functions==
The asymptotes most commonly encountered in the study of [[calculus]] are of curves of the form {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'')}}. These can be computed using [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and classified into ''horizontal'', ''vertical'' and ''oblique'' asymptotes depending on its orientation. Horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as ''x'' tends to +∞ or &amp;minus;∞. As the name indicate they are parallel to the ''x''-axis. Vertical asymptotes are vertical lines (perpendicular to the ''x''-axis) near which the function grows without bound. Oblique asymptotes are diagonal lines so that the difference between the curve and the line approaches 0 as ''x'' tends to +∞ or &amp;minus;∞. More general type of asymptotes can be defined in this case.

===Vertical asymptotes===
The line ''x'' = ''a'' is a ''vertical asymptote'' of the graph of the function {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'')}} &lt;!-- Some confusion as to notation, commenting out for now
if : &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} f(x)=\infty,&lt;/math&gt; or more generally, --&gt; if at least one of the following statements is true:

# &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a^{-}} f(x)=\pm\infty&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a^{+}} f(x)=\pm\infty.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- 
For example, if ƒ(''x'') = ''x''/(''x''-1), the numerator approaches 1 and the denominator approaches 0 as ''x'' approaches 1. So 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x}{x-1}=\infty&lt;/math&gt;
and the curve has a vertical asymptote of ''x''=1. --&gt;

The function ''ƒ''(''x'') may or may not be defined at ''a'', and its precise value at the point ''x'' = ''a'' does not affect the asymptote.  For example, for the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{x} &amp; \mbox{if } x &gt; 0, \\ 5 &amp; \mbox{if  } x \le 0. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

has a limit of +∞ as {{nowrap|''x'' &amp;rarr; 0&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ''ƒ''(''x'') has the vertical asymptote  {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 0}}, even though ''ƒ''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5. The graph of this function does intersect the vertical asymptote once, at (0,5). It is impossible for the graph of a function to intersect a vertical asymptote (or a vertical line in general) in more than one point.

===Horizontal asymptotes===
[[File:Asymptote03.png|right|frame|The graph of a function can have two horizontal asymptotes. An example of such a function would be &lt;math&gt;y=\arctan(x).&lt;/math&gt;]]

''Horizontal asymptotes'' are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as {{nowrap|''x'' &amp;rarr; ±&amp;infin;}}.  The horizontal line ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'' is a horizontal asymptote of the function ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''(''x'') if
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}f(x)=c&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to +\infty} f(x) = c.&lt;/math&gt;
In the first case, ''ƒ''(''x'') has ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'' as asymptote when ''x'' tends to &amp;minus;∞, and in the second that ''ƒ''(''x'') has ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'' as an asymptote as ''x'' tends to +∞

For example the arctangent function satisfies 

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}\arctan(x)=-\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\arctan(x)=\pi/2.&lt;/math&gt;

So the line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = &amp;minus;&amp;pi;/2}} is a horizontal tangent for the arctangent when ''x'' tends to &amp;minus;∞, and {{nowrap|1=''y'' = &amp;pi;/2}} is a horizontal tangent for the arctangent when ''x'' tends to +∞.

Functions may lack horizontal asymptotes on either or both sides, or may have one horizontal asymptote that is the same in both directions. For example, the function {{nowrap|1=ƒ(''x'') = 1/(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1)}} has a horizontal asymptote at ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 when ''x'' tends both to &amp;minus;∞ and +∞ because, respectively,

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to -\infty}\frac{1}{x^2+1}=\lim_{x\to +\infty}\frac{1}{x^2+1}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Oblique asymptotes===
[[File:1-over-x-plus-x.svg|right|thumb|220px|In the graph of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x+\tfrac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;, the ''y''-axis (''x'' = 0) and the line ''y''= ''x'' are both asymptotes.]]
When a linear asymptote is not parallel to the ''x''- or ''y''-axis, it is called an ''oblique asymptote'' or ''slant asymptote''. A function ''f''(''x'') is asymptotic to the straight line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} (''m''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0) if

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to +\infty}\left[ f(x)-(mx+n)\right] = 0 \, \mbox{ or } \lim_{x \to -\infty}\left[ f(x)-(mx+n)\right] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In the first case the line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} is an oblique asymptote of ''ƒ''(''x'') when ''x'' tends to +∞, and in the second case the line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} is an oblique asymptote of ''ƒ(x)'' when ''x'' tends to &amp;minus;∞

An example is ƒ(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;minus;1/''x'', which has the oblique asymptote ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'' (''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) as seen in the limits
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\left[f(x)-x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\left[\frac{x^2-1}{x}-x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\left[(x-\frac{1}{x})-x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}-\frac{1}{x}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

== Elementary methods for identifying asymptotes ==
Asymptotes of many elementary functions can be found without the explicit use of limits (although the derivations of such methods typically use limits).

===General computation of oblique asymptotes for functions===

The oblique asymptote, for the function ''f''(''x''), will be given by the equation ''y''=''mx''+''n''. The value for ''m'' is computed first and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;m\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\lim_{x\rightarrow a}f(x)/x&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is either &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;=\infty&lt;/math&gt; depending on the case being studied. It is good practice to treat the two cases separately. If this limit doesn't exist then there is no oblique asymptote in that direction.

Having ''m'' then the value for ''n'' can be computed by

:&lt;math&gt;n\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\lim_{x\rightarrow a}(f(x)-mx)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' should be the same value used before. If this limit fails to exist then there is no oblique asymptote in that direction, even should limit defining ''m'' exist. Otherwise {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} is the oblique asymptote of ''ƒ''(''x'') as ''x'' tends to ''a''.

For example, the function {{nowrap|1=''&amp;fnof;''(''x'') = (2''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 3''x'' + 1)/''x''}} has

:&lt;math&gt;m=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}f(x)/x=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\frac{2x^2+3x+1}{x^2}=2&lt;/math&gt; and then
:&lt;math&gt;n=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}(f(x)-mx)=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\left(\frac{2x^2+3x+1}{x}-2x\right)=3&lt;/math&gt;

so that {{nowrap|1=''y'' = 2''x'' + 3}} is the asymptote of ''ƒ''(''x'') when ''x'' tends to +∞. The function {{nowrap|1=''&amp;fnof;''(''x'') = ln ''x''}} has

:&lt;math&gt;m=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}f(x)/x=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\frac{\ln x}{x}=0&lt;/math&gt; and then

:&lt;math&gt;n=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}(f(x)-mx)=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\ln x&lt;/math&gt;, which does not exist.

So {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ln ''x''}} does not have an asymptote when ''x'' tends to +∞.

=== Asymptotes for rational functions ===
A [[rational function]] has at most one horizontal asymptote or oblique (slant) asymptote, and possibly many vertical asymptotes.

The [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] of the numerator and degree of the denominator determine whether or not there are any horizontal or oblique asymptotes. The cases are tabulated below, where deg(numerator) is the degree of the numerator, and deg(denominator) is the degree of the denominator.

The vertical asymptotes occur only when the denominator is zero (If both the numerator and denominator are zero, the multiplicities of the zero are compared). For example, the following function has vertical asymptotes at ''x'' = 0, and ''x'' = 1, but not at ''x'' = 2.
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{x^2-5x+6}{x^3-3x^2+2x}=\frac{(x-2)(x-3)}{x(x-1)(x-2)}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Oblique asymptotes of rational functions ====
[[File:SlantAsymptoteError.svg|right|thumb|320px|Black: the graph of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=(x^2+x+1)/(x+1)&lt;/math&gt;. Red: the asymptote &lt;math&gt;y=x&lt;/math&gt;. Green: difference between the graph and its asymptote for &lt;math&gt;x=1,2,3,4,5,6&lt;/math&gt;]]

When the numerator of a rational function has degree exactly one greater than the denominator, the function has an oblique (slant) asymptote. The asymptote is the polynomial term after [[Polynomial long division|dividing]] the numerator and denominator. This phenomenon occurs because when dividing the fraction, there will be a linear term, and a remainder. For example, consider the function 
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{x^2+x+1}{x+1}=x+\frac{1}{x+1}&lt;/math&gt;
shown to the right. As the value of ''x'' increases, ''f'' approaches the asymptote ''y'' = ''x''. This is because the other term, ''y'' = 1/(''x''+1) becomes smaller.

If the degree of the numerator is more than 1 larger than the degree of the denominator, and the denominator does not divide the numerator, there will be a nonzero remainder that goes to zero as ''x'' increases, but the quotient will not be linear, and the function does not have an oblique asymptote.

=== Transformations of known functions ===
If a known function has an asymptote (such as ''y''=0 for ''f''(x)=''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;), then the translations of it also have an asymptote.
* If ''x''=''a'' is a vertical asymptote of ''f''(''x''), then ''x''=''a''+''h'' is a vertical asymptote of ''f''(''x''-''h'')
* If ''y''=''c'' is a horizontal asymptote of ''f''(''x''), then ''y''=''c''+''k'' is a horizontal asymptote of ''f''(''x'')+''k''

If a known function has an asymptote, then the [[Homothetic transformation|scaling]] of the function also have an asymptote.

* If ''y''=''ax''+''b'' is an asymptote of ''f''(''x''), then ''y''=''cax''+''cb'' is an asymptote of ''cf''(''x'')
For example, ''f''(''x'')=''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''-1&lt;/sup&gt;+2 has horizontal asymptote ''y''=0+2=2, and no vertical or oblique asymptotes.

== General definition ==
[[File:Graph of sect csct.svg|right|thumb|200px|(sec(t), cosec(t)), or x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (xy)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with 2 horizontal and 2 vertical asymptotes.]] 

Let {{nowrap|''A'' : (''a'',''b'') &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} be a [[parametric curve|parametric]] plane curve, in coordinates ''A''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''(''t''),''y''(''t'')).  Suppose that the curve tends to infinity, that is: 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\rightarrow b}(x^2(t)+y^2(t))=\infty.&lt;/math&gt;
A line ℓ is an asymptote of ''A'' if the distance from the point ''A''(''t'') to ℓ tends to zero as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''b''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Pogorelov | first1=A. V. | title=Differential geometry | publisher=P. Noordhoff N. V. | location=Groningen | series=Translated from the first Russian ed. by L. F. Boron | id={{MathSciNet | id = 0114163}} | year=1959}}, §8.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the upper right branch of the curve ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''x'' can be defined parametrically as ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t'', ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''t'' (where ''t''&gt;0). First, ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞ as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞ and the distance from the curve to the ''x''-axis is 1/''t'' which approaches 0 as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞. Therefore the ''x''-axis is an asymptote of the curve. Also, ''y''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞ as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0 from the right, and the distance between the curve and the ''y''-axis is ''t'' which approaches 0 as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0. So the ''y''-axis is also an asymptote. A similar argument shows that the lower left branch of the curve also has the same two lines as asymptotes.

Although the definition here uses a parameterization of the curve, the notion of asymptote does not depend on the parameterization. In fact, if the equation of the line is &lt;math&gt;ax+by+c=0&lt;/math&gt; then the distance from the point ''A''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''(''t''),''y''(''t'')) to the line is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{|ax(t)+by(t)+c|}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
if γ(''t'') is a change of parameterization then the distance becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{|ax(\gamma(t))+by(\gamma(t))+c|}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
which tends to zero simultaneously as the previous expression.

An important case is when the curve is the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of a [[real function]] (a function of one real variable and returning real values). The graph of the function ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''(''x'') is the set of points of the plane with coordinates (''x'',''ƒ''(''x'')). For this, a parameterization is
:&lt;math&gt;t\mapsto (t,f(t)).&lt;/math&gt;
This parameterization is to be considered over the open intervals (''a'',''b''), where ''a'' can be &amp;minus;∞ and ''b'' can be +∞.

An asymptote can be either vertical or non-vertical (oblique or horizontal). In the first case its equation is ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'', for some real number ''c''. The non-vertical case has equation {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}}, where ''m'' and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers. All three types of asymptotes can be present at the same time in specific examples.  Unlike asymptotes for curves that are graphs of functions, a general curve may have more than two non-vertical asymptotes, and may cross its vertical asymptotes more than once.

==Curvilinear asymptotes==
[[File:nonlinear asymptote.svg|right|thumb|200px|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2''x''+3 is a parabolic asymptote to (''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+2''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+3''x''+4)/''x'']]
Let {{nowrap|''A'' : (''a'',''b'') &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} be a parametric plane curve, in coordinates ''A''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''(''t''),''y''(''t'')), and ''B'' be another (unparameterized) curve. Suppose, as before, that the curve ''A'' tends to infinity. The curve ''B'' is a curvilinear asymptote of ''A'' if the shortest of the distance from the point ''A''(''t'') to a point on ''B'' tends to zero as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''b''.  Sometimes ''B'' is simply referred to as an asymptote of ''A'', when there is no risk of confusion with linear asymptotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Fowler|first=R. H.|title=The elementary differential geometry of plane curves|publisher=Cambridge, University Press|year=1920|url=http://www.archive.org/details/elementarydiffer00fowlrich|isbn=0486442772}}, p. 89ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the function
:&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{x^3+2x^2+3x+4}{x}&lt;/math&gt;
has a curvilinear asymptote {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''x'' + 3}}, which is known as a ''parabolic asymptote'' because it is a [[parabola]] rather than a straight line.&lt;ref&gt;William Nicholson, ''The British enciclopaedia, or dictionary of arts and sciences; comprising an accurate and popular view of the present improved state of human knowledge'', Vol. 5, 1809&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asymptotes and curve sketching==
The notion of asymptote is related to procedures of [[curve sketching]]. An asymptote serves as a guide line that serves to show the behavior of the curve towards infinity.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, P. ''An elementary treatise on curve tracing'' (1918) [http://www.archive.org/details/elementarytreati00fros online]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to get better approximations of the curve, asymptotes that are general curves have also been used &lt;ref&gt;Fowler, R. H. ''The elementary differential geometry of plane curves'' Cambridge, University Press, 1920, pp 89ff.([http://www.archive.org/details/elementarydiffer00fowlrich online at archive.org])&lt;/ref&gt; although the term asymptotic curve seems to be preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, P. ''An elementary treatise on curve tracing'', 1918, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algebraic curves==
[[File:Folium Of Descartes.svg|thumb|right|A [[cubic curve]], [[Folium of descartes|the folium of Descartes]] (solid) with a single real asymptote (dashed).]]
The asymptotes of an [[algebraic curve]] in the [[affine space|affine plane]] are the lines that are tangent to the projectivized curve through a point at infinity.  Asymptotes are often considered only for real curves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Coolidge | first1=Julian Lowell | title=A treatise on algebraic plane curves | publisher=[[Dover Publications]] | location=New York | id={{MathSciNet | id = 0120551}} | year=1959 | isbn=0486495760}}, pp. 40&amp;ndash;44.&lt;/ref&gt; although they also make sense when defined in this way for curves over an arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Kunz | first1=Ernst | title=Introduction to plane algebraic curves | publisher=Birkhäuser Boston | location=Boston, MA | isbn=978-0-8176-4381-2; 978-0-8176-4381-2 | id={{MathSciNet | id = 2156630}} | year=2005}}, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;  

A plane curve of degree ''n'' intersects its asymptote at most at ''n''&amp;minus;2 other points, by [[Bezout's theorem]], as the intersection at infinity is of multiplicity at least two.  For a [[conic]], there are a pair of lines that do not intersect the conic at any complex point: these are the two asymptotes of the conic.

A plane algebraic curve is defined by an equation of the form ''P''(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 where ''P'' is a polynomial of degree ''n''
:&lt;math&gt;P(x,y) = P_n(x,y) + P_{n-1}(x,y) + \cdots + P_1(x,y) + P_0&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous]] of degree ''k''.  Vanishing of the linear factors of the highest degree term ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; defines the asymptotes of the curve: if {{nowrap|1=''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''y'') = (''ax'' &amp;minus; ''by'') ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''y'')}}, then the line
:&lt;math&gt;ax-by = t_0&lt;/math&gt;
is an asymptote, where ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is chosen so that the curve and line meet at infinity.  Over the complex numbers, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; splits into linear factors, each of which defines an asymptote.  However, over the reals, not only may ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; fail to split, but also if a linear factor has multiplicity greater than one, the resulting asymptote may be entirely spurious.  For example, the curve {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = 0}} has no real points in the finite plane, but its highest order term gives the asymptote ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 with multiplicity 4.

==Other uses of the term==
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
The hyperbolas
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;
have asymptotes 
:&lt;math&gt;y=\pm\frac{b}{a}x.&lt;/math&gt;
The equation for the union of these two lines is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=0.&lt;/math&gt;
{{col-2}}
Similarly, the [[hyperboloid]]s
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}-\frac{z^2}{c^2}=\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;
are said to have the ''asymptotic cone''&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=YMU0AAAAMAAJ L.P. Siceloff, G. Wentworth, D.E. Smith ''Analytic geometry'' (1922) p. 271]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=fGg4AAAAMAAJ P. Frost ''Solid geometry'' (1875)] This has a more general treatment of asymptotic surfaces.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}-\frac{z^2}{c^2}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The distance between the hyperboloid and cone approaches 0 as the distance from the origin approaches infinity.

''Operating Systems: Design and Implementation'' and MINIX&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minix3.org/ The MINIX 3 Operating System&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; were [[Linus Torvalds]]' inspiration for the [[Linux]] kernel. In his autobiography ''[[Just For Fun]]'', Torvalds describes it as &quot;the book that launched me to new heights&quot;.

His books have been translated into many languages including Arabic, Basque, Bulgarian, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mexican Spanish, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/home/faq.html Andrew S. Tanenbaum's FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; They have appeared in over 120 editions and are used at universities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications Andrew S. Tanenbaum - Publications&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amsterdam Compiler Kit==
The [[Amsterdam Compiler Kit]] is a toolkit for producing portable compilers. It was started sometime before 1981,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications/ Andrew S. Tanenbaum - Publications, Colloquia section]&lt;/ref&gt; and Andrew Tanenbaum was the architect from the start until version 5.5.

==MINIX==
In 1987, Tanenbaum wrote a clone of [[UNIX]], called [[MINIX]] (MIni-uNIX), for the [[IBM PC]]. It was targeted at students and others who wanted to learn how an operating system worked. Consequently, he wrote a book&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0131429388 Amazon.com: Operating Systems Design and Implementation (3rd Edition) (Prentice Hall Software Series): Andrew S Tanenbaum, Albert S Woodhull: Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that listed the source code in an appendix and described it in detail in the text. The source code itself was available on a set of floppy disks. Within three months, a [[USENET]] newsgroup, comp.os.minix,&lt;ref&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/topics&lt;/ref&gt; had sprung up with over 40,000 subscribers discussing and improving the system. One of these subscribers was a Finnish student named [[Linus Torvalds]] who began adding new features to MINIX and tailoring it to his own needs. On October 5, 1991, Torvalds announced his own ([[POSIX]] like) kernel, called [[Linux]], which originally used the MINIX file system but is not based on MINIX code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/ Some notes on the &quot;Who wrote Linux&quot; Kerfuffle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although MINIX and Linux have diverged, MINIX continues to be developed, now as a production system as well as an educational one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2006-04/openpdfs/herder.pdf USENIX April 06&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The focus is on building a highly modular, reliable, and secure, operating system. The system is based on a [[microkernel]], with only 5000 lines of code&lt;ref&gt;http://www.few.vu.nl/~ast/&lt;/ref&gt; running in kernel mode. The rest of the operating system runs as a number of independent processes in user mode, including processes for the file system, process manager, and each device driver. The system continuously monitors each of these processes, and when a failure is detected is often capable of automatically replacing the failed process without a reboot, without disturbing running programs, and without the user even noticing. [[MINIX 3]], as the current version is called, is available under the [[BSD license]] for free at [http://www.minix3.org www.minix3.org].

==Research projects==
Tanenbaum has also been involved in numerous other research projects in the areas of operating systems, distributed systems, and ubiquitous computing, often as supervisor of Ph.D. students or a [[postdoctoral researcher]]. These projects include:
* [[Amoeba distributed operating system|Amoeba]]
* [http://www.cs.vu.nl/globe/ Globe]
* [http://www.cs.vu.nl/~guido/mansion/ Mansion]
* [http://www.cs.vu.nl/orca/ Orca]
* [http://www.few.vu.nl/~leendert/paramecium.html Paramecium]
* [[RFID Guardian]]
* [[Turtle F2F]]

==Ph.D. students==
Tanenbaum has had a number of Ph.D. students who themselves have gone on to become famous computer science researchers.
These include
[[Henri Bal]], a professor at the [[Vrije Universiteit]] in [[Amsterdam]];
[[Frans Kaashoek]], a professor at [[MIT]];
[[Sape Mullender]], a researcher at [[Bell Labs]];
[[Robbert van Renesse]], a professor at [[Cornell University]];
[[Leendert van Doorn]], a fellow at the [[AMD]] Corporation;
and
[[Werner Vogels]], the Chief Technology Officer at [[Amazon.com]].

==Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging==
In the early 1990s, the Dutch government began setting up a number of thematically oriented research schools that spanned multiple universities. These schools were intended to bring professors and Ph.D. students from different Dutch (and later, foreign) universities together to help them cooperate and enhance their research. Tanenbaum was one of the cofounders and first Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging (ASCI). This school initially consisted of nearly 200 faculty members and Ph.D. students from the [[Vrije Universiteit]], [[University of Amsterdam]], [[Delft University of Technology]], and [[Leiden University]] working in the areas of advanced computer systems, especially parallel computing, and image analysis and processing. Tanenbaum remained Dean for 12 years, until 2005, when he was awarded an Academy Professorship by the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]], at which time he became a full-time research professor. ASCI has since grown to include researchers from nearly a dozen universities in The Netherlands, Belgium, and France. ASCI offers Ph.D. level courses, has an annual conference, and runs various workshops every year.

==Electoral-vote.com==
In 2004 Tanenbaum created [[Electoral-vote.com]], a web site analyzing [[opinion polls]] for the [[2004 U.S. Presidential Election]], using them to project the outcome in the [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]]. He stated that he created the site as an American who &quot;knows first hand what the world thinks of America and it is not a pretty picture at the moment. I want people to think of America as the land of freedom and democracy, not the land of arrogance and blind revenge. I want to be proud of America again.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EVFAQ&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20041102014915/www.electoral-vote.com/info/votemaster-faq.html The Votemaster FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The site provided a color-coded map, updated each day with projections for each state's electoral votes. Through most of the campaign period Tanenbaum kept his identity secret, referring to himself as &quot;the Votemaster&quot; and acknowledging only that he personally preferred [[John Kerry]]. A libertarian who supports the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]], he revealed his identity on November 1, 2004, the day prior to the election, also stating his reasons and qualifications for running the website.&lt;ref name=&quot;EVFAQ&quot; /&gt; Through the site he covered the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], correctly predicting the winner of all 33 Senate races that year.

In 2008 he tracked the presidential, Senate, and House races. For the presidential election, he got every state right except for Indiana, which he said McCain would win by 2% (Obama won by 1%) and Missouri, which he said was too close to call (McCain won by 0.1%). He correctly predicted all the winners in the Senate races except for Minnesota, where he predicted a 1% win by [[Norm Coleman]].
After 7 months of legal battling, [[Al Franken]] won this race by 312 votes (0.01%).

'''Ariane 5''' is an [[expendable launch system]] used to deliver payloads into [[geostationary transfer orbit]] (GTO) or [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO). Ariane 5 [[rocket]]s are manufactured under the authority of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and the [[Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales]] (CNES).  [[Astrium]], an EADS company, is the prime contractor for the vehicles, leading a consortium of sub-contractors. Ariane 5 is operated and marketed by [[Arianespace]] as part of the [[Ariane (rocket)|''Ariane'']] programme. Astrium builds the rockets in [[Europe]] and Arianespace launches them from the [[Guiana Space Centre]] in [[French Guiana]].

Ariane 5 succeeded [[Ariane 4]], but was not derived from it directly. Ariane 5 has been refined since the first launch in successive versions, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;G+&quot;, &quot;GS&quot;, &quot;ECA&quot;, and most recently, &quot;ES&quot;.  ESA originally designed Ariane 5 to launch the manned mini shuttle [[Hermes (shuttle)|Hermes]], and thus intended it to be &quot;[[Human-rating certification|human rated]]&quot; from the beginning.

Two satellites can be mounted using a SYLDA carrier (''SYstème de Lancement Double Ariane''). Three main satellites are possible depending on size using SPELTRA (''Structure Porteuse Externe Lancement TRiple Ariane''). Up to eight secondary payloads, usually small experiment packages or [[miniaturized satellite|minisatellites]], can be carried with an ASAP (''Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads'') platform.

By mid 2007, Arianespace has ordered a total of 99 Ariane 5 launchers from Astrium. The first batch ordered in 1995 consisted of 14 launchers, while the second—P2—batch ordered in 1999 consisted of 20 launchers. A third—PA—batch consisting of 25 ECA and 5 ES launchers was ordered in 2004. The latest batch ordered in mid 2007 consist of another 35 ECA launchers.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web|url=http://www.arianespace.com/site/launcher/launcher_milestones.html |title=
Ariane 5 milestones |year=2008 |publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through these orders, the Ariane 5 will be the workhorse of Arianespace at least through 2015.

==Vehicle Description==
[[File:Cut drawing of an Ariane 5 ECA EN.svg|thumb|left|150px|Cut drawing of an Ariane 5 ECA]]
[[Image:Moteur-Vulcain.jpg|thumb|left|''Vulcain'' engine|150px]]

===Cryogenic main stage===
Ariane 5’s [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] H158 main stage (H173 for Ariane 5 ECA) is called the EPC (''Étage Principal Cryotechnique'' - Cryotechnic Main Stage). It consists of a large tank 30.5 metres high with two compartments, one for 130 [[tonne]]s of [[liquid oxygen]] and one for 25 [[tonne]]s of [[liquid hydrogen]], and a [[Vulcain]] engine at the base with thrust of 115 [[tonne-force|tonnes-force]] (1.13 [[meganewton]]s). This part of the first stage weighs about 15 tonnes when empty.

===Solid boosters===
Attached to the sides are two [[solid rocket booster]]s (SRBs or EAPs from the French ''Étages d’Accélération à Poudre''), P238 (P241 for Ariane 5 ECA), each weighing about 277 tonnes full. Each delivers a thrust of about 630 tonnes-force ({{nowrap|6.2 MN}}). These SRBs are usually allowed to sink to the bottom of the ocean, but like the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]]s they can be recovered with parachutes, and this is occasionally done for post-flight analysis. (Unlike Space Shuttle SRBs Ariane 5 boosters are not reused.) The most recent attempt was for the first Ariane 5 ECA mission. One of the two boosters was successfully recovered and returned to the Guiana Space Center for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.france-science.org/spip.php?article399#3-ARIANE-5-ECA-BOOSTER-RECOVERED |title=France in Space #387 |publisher=Office of Science and Technology Embassy of France in the USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that mission, the last such recovery and testing was done in 2003.

The French [[M51 (missile)|M51]] [[SLBM]] shares a substantial amount of technology with these boosters.

In March 2000 the [[nose cone]] of an Ariane 5 booster washed ashore on the [[South Texas]] coast, and was recovered by [[Beachcombing|beachcombers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-59699394.html |title=NASA confirms French nose cone found |publisher=UPI |date=March 2, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second stage===
The second stage is on top of the main stage and below the payload. The Ariane 5G used the EPS (''Étage à Propergols Stockables'' - Storable Propellant Stage), which is fueled by [[monomethylhydrazine]] (MMH) and [[nitrogen tetroxide]], whereas the Ariane 5 ECA uses the ESC (''Étage Supérieur Cryotechnique'' - Cryogenic Upper Stage), which is fueled by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.

The EPS upper stage is capable of re-ignition, which has been demonstrated twice. The first demonstration occurred during flight V26, which was launched on 5 October 2007. This was purely to test the engine, and occurred after the payloads had been deployed. The first operational use of restart capability as part of a mission, came on 9 March 2008, when two burns were made to deploy the first [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] into a circular parking orbit.

===Fairing===
The payload and all upper stages are covered at launch by a fairing, which splits off once sufficient altitude has been reached (typically above 150&amp;nbsp;km). Ariane 5G+ used and Ariane 5 GS and ES use an improved EPS upper stage.

==Variants==
* The original version is dubbed Ariane 5 '''G''' (Generic) with a launch mass of 737 tonnes. Its payload capability to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) was initially specified as {{convert|5970|kg|abbr=on}}, but was increased after the qualification flights to {{convert|6200|kg|abbr=on}}.

* The Ariane 5 '''G+''' had an improved second stage, with a GTO capacity of {{convert|6950|kg|abbr=on}} for a single payload. It flew three times in 2004.

* It was replaced in 2005 by the Ariane 5 '''GS''', with the same EAP boosters as the ECA and ES variants and a first stage based on the later Evolution EPC, but with the original tank volumes and a Vulcain 1B engine. The GS was introduced following the failure of the first Ariane 5 ECA flight - since all the vehicles then in production were ECA versions, it was decided to modify some of them to use the original Vulcain engine while the failure was investigated. It can carry a single payload of {{convert|6100|kg|abbr=on}} to GTO. The last of 6 Ariane 5 GS rockets was launched in 2009.

* The Ariane 5 '''ECA''' (''Evolution Cryotechnique type A'') has a GTO launch capacity of {{convert|10000|kg|abbr=on}} for dual payloads or {{convert|10500|kg|abbr=on}} for a single payload. This variant uses a new Vulcain 2 first-stage engine, and an ESC-A (''Etage Supérieur Cryogénique''-A) second stage, powered by an [[HM-7B]] engine, weighing {{convert|2100|kg|abbr=on}} and carrying {{convert|14000|kg|abbr=on}} of cryogenic [[Spacecraft propulsion|propellant]]. The second stage was previously used as the third stage of Ariane 4; in ECA use, the tanks are modified to shorten stage length. The revised Vulcain has a longer, more efficient nozzle with more efficient flow cycle and denser propellant ratio. The new ratio demanded length modifications to the first-stage tanks. Also, the solid EAP casings have been lightened with new welds, and packed with more propellant. The ESC-A cryogenic second stage does not improve the performance to Low Earth orbit compared to Ariane 5G, and for this reason the Ariane 5 ECA will not be used to launch the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] (ATV).

* The Ariane 5 '''ES''' (''Evolution Storable'') is used to launch the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] (ATV) into a 260&amp;nbsp;km circular low Earth orbit inclined at 51.6°.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/ATV/infokit/english/05_ATVLauncher.pdf |title=Ariane 5 ES ATV |publisher=ESA |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes all the performance improvements of Ariane 5 '''ECA''' on EPC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Launchers_Home/SEMD763VQUD_2.html ESA launchers glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; (''Etage Principal Cryogénique''—main stage) and EAP (''Etage d'Accélération à Poudre''—solid rocket booster) stages while the second stage is the EPS (''Etage à Propergols Stockable'') used on Ariane 5 '''GS''' variants. It is estimated that the Ariane 5 '''ES''' can put up to {{convert|21000|kg|abbr=on}} in LEO. The first such launch occurred at 04:03 [[GMT]] on 9 March 2008.

==Future developments==
[[Image:Ariane 5 (maquette).jpg|thumb|right]]

===Ariane 5 ECB===
Ariane 5 '''ECB''' was planned to have an ESC-B upper stage using a new [[Vinci (rocket engine)|Vinci]] [[expander cycle (rocket)|expander cycle]] type engine. The GTO capacity was to increase to {{nowrap|12,000 kg}}, but ECB was put on hold due to budget cuts.

At an ESA conference (December 2005) in Berlin there was no decision to restart or cancel the program, meaning it is currently on hold. The Vinci engine, which is designed to power the Ariane 5 ECB upper stage, is still being developed, though at a slower pace. At the ESA's Council of Ministers 25–26 November 2008 there was an agreement for the funding of a modernized second stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dlr.de/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1/86_read-14434/ |title=ESA's Council of Ministers decides the future of European space exploration}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On December 21, 2009 EADS Astrium was awarded a €200 million contract to develop the ECB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0912/21ariane/ |title=
ESA signs contract for Ariane 5 rocket enhancements }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the HM7-B engine, which is not capable of engine restarting, the Vinci engine is capable to do as such for up to five times, allowing increased flexibility, from additional payload capacity to possible direct-to-[[geosynchronous orbit]] (GSO) missions. The first successful test firing of this campaign took place on 27 May 2010, while the first flight test of the Vinci engine is not expected until 2016 or 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snecma.com/spip.php?article2414&amp;lang=en|title=First test of Vinci M3 engine a success!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solid propellant stage===
Work on the Ariane 5 EAP motors have been continued in the [[Vega (launcher)|Vega]] programme.
The Vega 1st stage engine—the P80 engine—is a shorter derivation of the EAP. The P80 booster casing is made of filament wound graphite epoxy, much lighter than the current stainless steel casing. A new composite steerable nozzle has been developed while new thermal insulation material and a narrower throat improve the expansion ratio and subsequently the overall performance. Additionally, the nozzle now has electromechanical actuators which have replaced the heavier hydraulic ones used for thrust vector control.

These developments will probably later make their way back into the Ariane programme.&lt;ref&gt;

Successful firing of Vega’s first-stage motor in Kourou |date=November 30, 2006 |publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incorporation of the ESC-B with the improvements to the solid motor casing and an uprated Vulcain engine would deliver {{convert|27000|kg}} to LEO. This would be developed for any lunar missions but the performance of such a design may not be possible if the higher Max-Q for the launch of this rocket poses a constraint on the mass delivered to orbit.&lt;ref name = &quot;ariane upgrades&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

==Notable launches==
[[Image:Ariane 5 10 2007.ogg|thumb|Launch of the 34th Ariane 5 at [[Guiana Space Centre|Kourou]].]]

Ariane 5's first test flight ([[Ariane 5 Flight 501]]) on 4 June 1996 failed, with the rocket self-destructing 37 seconds after launch because of a malfunction in the control software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/software/coolapps/news/2005/11/69355?currentPage=2 Wired.com: &quot;History's Worst Software Bugs&quot;] ''(Retrieved 3 September 2009)''&lt;/ref&gt; A data conversion from 64-[[bit]] [[floating point]] value to 16-bit [[Signedness|signed]] [[integer]] value to be stored in a variable representing horizontal bias caused a processor trap (operand error)&lt;ref name=&quot;esamultimedia.esa.int&quot;&gt;Ariane 5 Flight 501 Failure, Report by the Inquiry Board http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/esa-x-1819eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; because the floating point value was too large to be represented by a 16-bit signed integer. The software was originally written for the Ariane 4 where efficiency considerations (the computer running the software had an 80% maximum workload requirement&lt;ref name=&quot;esamultimedia.esa.int&quot;/&gt;) led to 4 variables being protected with a handler while 3 others, including the horizontal bias variable, were left unprotected because it was thought that they were &quot;physically limited or that there was a large margin of error&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;esamultimedia.esa.int&quot;/&gt; The software, written in [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], was included in the Ariane 5 through the reuse of an entire Ariane 4 subsystem despite the fact that the particular software containing the bug, which was just a part of the subsystem, was not required by the Ariane 5 because it has a different preparation sequence&lt;ref name=&quot;esamultimedia.esa.int&quot;/&gt; than the Ariane 4.

The second test flight (L502, on 30 October 1997) was a partial failure. The Vulcain nozzle caused a roll problem, leading to premature shutdown of the core stage. The upper stage operated successfully but could not reach the intended orbit.

A subsequent test flight (L503, on 21 October 1998) proved successful and the first commercial launch (L504) occurred on 10 December 1999 with the launch of the [[XMM-Newton]] X-ray observatory satellite.

Another partial failure occurred on 12 July 2001, with the delivery of two satellites into an incorrect orbit, at only half the height of the intended GTO. The ESA [[Artemis (satellite)|Artemis]] [[telecommunications satellite]] was able to reach its intended orbit on 31 January 2003, through the use of its experimental [[ion propulsion]] system.

The next launch did not occur until 1 March 2002, when the [[Envisat]] [[environmental satellite]] successfully reached an orbit {{nowrap|800 km}} above the Earth in the 11th launch. At {{nowrap|8111 kg}}, it was the heaviest single payload until the launch of the first ATV on March 9, 2008 (~9000&amp;nbsp;kg).

The first launch of the ECA variant on 11 December 2002 ended in failure when a main booster problem caused the rocket to veer off-course, forcing its self-destruction three minutes into the flight. Its payload of two communications satellites (Stentor and [[Hot Bird]] 7), valued at about EUR 630 million, was lost in the ocean. The fault was determined to have been caused by a leak in coolant pipes allowing the nozzle to overheat. After this failure, Arianespace SA delayed the expected January 2003 launch for the [[Rosetta space probe|Rosetta]] mission to 26 February 2004, but this was again delayed to early March 2004 due to a minor fault in the foam that protects the cryogenic tanks on the Ariane 5. As of November 2010, the failure of the first ECA launch was the last failure of an Ariane 5; since then, all subsequent launches have been successful, with 40 consecutive successes that stretch back to 9 April 2003 with the launch of [[INSAT-3A]] and [[Galaxy 12]] satellites.

On 27 September 2003 the last Ariane 5 G boosted three satellites (including the first European lunar probe, [[SMART-1]]), in Flight 162. On 18 July 2004 an Ariane 5 G+ boosted what was at the time the heaviest telecommunication satellite ever, [[Anik (satellite)|Anik]] F2, weighing almost {{nowrap|6,000 kg}}.

The first successful launch of the Ariane 5 ECA took place on 12 February 2005. The payload consisted of the XTAR-EUR military communications satellite, a 'SLOSHSAT' small scientific satellite and a MaqSat B2 payload simulator. The launch had been originally scheduled for October 2004, but additional testing and the military requiring a launch at that time (of an [[Helios 2A]] observation satellite) delayed the attempt.

On 11 August 2005, the first Ariane 5GS (featuring the Ariane 5 ECA's improved solid motors) boosted Thaïcom-4/iPStar-1, the heaviest telecommunications satellite to date at {{nowrap|6,505 kg}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/ipstar-1.htm Gunter's Space Page - Information on Launch vehicles, Satellites, Space Shuttle and Astronautics]&lt;/ref&gt; into orbit.

On 16 November 2005, the third Ariane 5 ECA launch (the second successful ECA launch) took place. It carried a dual payload consisting of [[SPACEWAY-2|Spaceway-F2]] for [[DirecTV]] and Telkom-2 for PT Telekomunikasi of Indonesia. This was the rocket's heaviest dual payload to date, at more than {{nowrap|8,000 kg}}.

On 27 May 2006, an Ariane 5 ECA rocket set a new commercial payload lifting record of 8.2 tonnes. The dual-payload consisted of the Thaicom 5 and Satmex 6 satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5024352.stm |title=Ariane lifts record dual payload |date=May 27, 2006 |publisher=BBC NEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 May 2007 the Ariane 5 ECA set another new commercial record, lifting into transfer orbit the [[Astra 1L]] and Galaxy 17 communication satellites with a combined weight of 8.6 tonnes, and a total payload weight of 9.4 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMOPTU681F_index_0.html |title=Ariane 5 – second launch of six in 2007 |date=May 5, 2007 |publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt; This record was again broken by another Ariane 5 ECA, launching the [[Skynet 5B]] and [[Star One C1]] satellites, on 11 November 2007. The total payload weight for this launch was {{nowrap|9,535 kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM9V953R8F_index_0.html |title=Ariane 5 – fifth launch of six in 2007 |date=November 11, 2007 |publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 2008, the first Ariane 5 ES-ATV was launched to deliver the first [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]] called ''[[Jules Verne ATV|Jules Verne]]'' to the [[International Space Station]]. The ATV was the heaviest payload ever launched by a European rocket, providing supplies to the space station with necessary propellant, water, air and dry cargo. This was the first operational Ariane mission which involved an engine restart in the upper stage. (The ES-ATV Aestus EPS upper stage was restartable while the ECA HM7-B engine was not.)

On 1 July 2009, an Ariane 5 ECA launched [[TerreStar-1]], the largest commercial telecommunication satellite ever built.

On 28 October 2010, an Ariane 5 ECA launched [[Eutelsat]]'s [[Eutelsat W3B|W3B]] (part of its [[W Series]] of satellites) and [[Broadcasting Satellite System Corporation]] (B-SAT)'s [[BSAT-3b]] satellites into orbit. However, the W3B satellite failed to operate shortly after the successful launch and was written off as a total loss due to an oxidizer leak in the satellite's main propulsion system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Eutelsat Communications |date=29 October 2010 |language= |title=EUTELSAT STATEMENT on LOSS OF W3B SATELLITE |url=http://www.eutelsat.com/news/compress/en/2010/html/PR4810W3Bloss-post-launch/PR4810W3Bloss-post-launch.html |accessdate=30 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BSAT-3b satellite, however, is operating normally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2010/1104-SS-bsatOK.html |title=All Systems Are Nominal Aboard Lockheed Martin Bsat-3b Satellite Following Oct. 28 Launch |date=2010-11-04 |publisher=Lockheed Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commodore International|Commodore]] '''[[Amiga]] 500 Plus'''&lt;ref&gt;The case badge reads &quot;Commodore A-500 Plus&quot;[http://www.abc80.net/pics/a500_plus1.jpg], with &quot;Amiga&quot; embossed elsewhere. However, as with the Amiga range in general, Commodore do not appear to have been overly concerned with naming consistency, the [http://www.amigau.com/aig/bundles/a500plus_box.html packaging] being one example of this.&lt;/ref&gt; (often '''A500 Plus''' or simply '''A500+''') is an enhanced version of the original [[Amiga 500]] computer. It was notable for introducing new versions of [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] and [[AmigaOS|Workbench]], and for some minor improvements in the custom chips, known as the [[Enhanced Chip Set]] (or ECS).

== Introduction ==

The A500+ was released in several markets (including many [[Europe]]an countries), but was never sold officially in the [[United States|U.S.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.amiga.hardware/browse_thread/thread/febef3c8e99dd24e/193cd363b655ebcb?q=%22a500+plus%22+%22sold+in%22&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#193cd363b655ebcb]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although officially introduced in 1992, some Amiga 500 Plus units had already been sold (masquerading as Amiga 500 models, and with no prior announcement) during late 1991. It has been speculated that Commodore had already sold out the remaining stocks of Amiga 500s, before the run up to the profitable Christmas sales period. In order to make enough A500s before Christmas, Commodore used stocks of the new 8A revision motherboards destined for the A500+. Many users were unaware that they were purchasing anything other than a standard Amiga 500. Although the Amiga 500+ was an improvement to the Amiga 500, it was minor. It was discontinued and replaced by the [[Amiga 600]] in summer 1992, making it the shortest lived Amiga model

== Reason for design ==

Commodore created the A500+ for a couple of reasons. The first was cost reduction; minor changes were made to the motherboard to make it cheaper to produce. It was also so that Commodore could introduce the new version of the [[AmigaOS|Amiga Operating system]], 2.04.

== Compatibility problems ==

Due to the new Kickstart, quite a few popular games (such as [[SWIV]], [[Treasure Island Dizzy]] and [[Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge]]) failed to work on the Amiga 500+, and some people took them back to dealers demanding an original Kickstart 1.3 Amiga 500. This problem was solved by third-parties who produced Kickstart [[Read-only memory|ROM]] [[switching boards]], that could allow the Amiga 500+ to be downgraded to Kickstart 1.2 or 1.3. It also encouraged game developers to use better programming habits, which was important since Commodore already had plans for the introduction of the next-generation [[Amiga 1200]] computer. A program, Relokick, was also released (and included with an issue of CU Amiga) which loaded a [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] 1.3 ROM image into memory and booted the machine into Kickstart 1.3, allowing incompatible software to run.

== Technical specifications ==
* [[Motorola 68000]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] running at {{nowrap|7.09 MHz}} (PAL) / {{nowrap|7.16 MHz}} (NTSC), like its predecessor.
* 1 MB of [[Chip RAM]] (Very early versions came with 512 KiB)
* Kickstart 2.04 (v37.175)
* Workbench 37.67 (release 2.04)
* Built in battery backed RTC (Real Time Clock)
* Full [[Enhanced Chip Set|ECS]] Chipset including new version of the [[MOS Technology Agnus|Agnus]] chip and [[Original Amiga chipset#Denise|Denise]] chip.

      <text xml:space="preserve">
In a [[computer]]'s central processing unit ([[central processing unit|CPU]]), an '''accumulator''' is a [[processor register|register]] in which intermediate [[arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic and logic]] results are stored. Without a register like an accumulator, it would be necessary to write the result of each calculation (addition, multiplication, shift, etc.) to [[primary storage|main memory]], perhaps only to be read right back again for use in the next operation. Access to main memory is slower than access to a register like the accumulator because the technology used for the large main memory is slower (but cheaper) than that used for a register.

The canonical example for accumulator use is summing a list of numbers. The accumulator is initially set to zero, then each number in turn is added to the value in the accumulator.  Only when all numbers have been added is the result held in the accumulator written to main memory or to another, non-accumulator, CPU register.

An '''accumulator machine''', also called a [[Instruction_set_architecture#Number_of_operands|1-operand machine]], or a CPU with ''accumulator-based architecture'', is a kind of CPU in which—although it may have several registers—the CPU always stores the results of most calculations in one special register—typically called &quot;the&quot; accumulator of that CPU.
Historically almost all early computers were accumulator machines; and many [[microcontroller]]s still popular as of 2010 (such as the [[68HC12]], the [[PICmicro]], the [[8051]] and several others) are basically accumulator machines.

Modern CPUs are typically 2-operand or 3-operand machines—the additional operands specify which one of many [[general purpose register]]s (also called &quot;general purpose accumulators&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/overview.jsp?code=DRMCRHC16OV&amp;srch=1 |title=HC16 Overview |publisher=Freescale.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-22}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are used as the source and destination for calculations. These CPUs are not considered &quot;accumulator machines&quot;.

The characteristic which distinguishes one register as being the accumulator of a [[computer architecture]] is that the accumulator (if the architecture were to have one) would be used as an ''implicit'' [[operand]] for arithmetic [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]]s.  For instance, a CPU might have an instruction like:

      ADD ''[[memory address|memaddress]]''

This instruction would add the value read from the memory location at ''memaddress'' to the value from the accumulator, placing the result in the accumulator.  The accumulator is not identified in the instruction by a register number; it is [[addressing_mode#Implicit|implicit]] in the instruction and no other register can be specified in the instruction.  Some architectures use a particular register as an accumulator in some instructions, but other instructions use register numbers for explicit operand specification.

== History of the computer accumulator ==
Historical convention dedicates a register to &quot;the accumulator&quot;, an &quot;arithmetic organ&quot; that literally accumulates its number during a sequence of arithmetic operations:

:&quot;The first part of our arithmetic organ ... should be a parallel storage organ which can receive a number and add it to the one already in it, which is also able to clear its contents and which can store what it contains. We will call such an organ an Accumulator. It is quite conventional in principle in past and present computing machines of the most varied types, e.g. desk multipliers, standard IBM counters, more modern relay machines, the ENIAC&quot; (Goldstine and von Neumann, 1946; p. 98 in Bell and Newell 1971).

Just a few of the instructions are, for example (with some modern interpretation):
* Clear accumulator and add number from memory location x
* Clear accumulator and subtract number from memory location x
* Add number copied from memory location x to the contents of the accumulator
* Subtract number copied from memory location x from the contents of the accumulator
* Clear accumulator and shift contents of register into accumulator

No convention exists regarding the names for operations from registers to accumulator and from accumulator to registers. Tradition (e.g. [[Donald Knuth]]'s (1973) hypothetical [[MIX]] computer), for example, uses two instructions called LOAD ACCUMULATOR from memory/register (e.g. &quot;LDA r&quot;) and STORE ACCUMULATOR in register/memory (e.g. &quot;STA r&quot;). Knuth's model has many other instructions as well.

== Notable Accumulator-based computers ==

The 12-bit [[PDP-8]] was one of the first minicomputers to use accumulators, and inspired many later machines.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The PDP-8 had but one accumulator. The [[HP 2100]] and [[Data General Nova]] had 2 and 4 accumulators. The Nova was created when this follow-on to the PDP-8 was rejected in favor of what would become the [[PDP-11]]. The Nova provided four accumulators, AC0-AC3, although AC2 and AC3 could also be used to provide offset addresses, tending towards more generality of usage for the registers. The [[PDP-11]] introduced a more contemporary model of general registers, numbered R0-R7 or more, adopted by most later CISC and RISC machines.

Early 4-bit and 8-bit microprocessors such as the [[4004]], [[8008]] and numerous others, typically had single accumulators. The [[8051]] microcontroller has two, a primary accumulator and a secondary accumulator, where the second is used by instructions only when multiplying (MUL AB) or dividing (DIV AB); the former splits the 16-bit result between the two 8-bit accumulators, whereas the latter stores the quotient on the primary accumulator A and the remainder in the secondary accumulator B. As a direct descendent of the 8008, the [[8080]], and the [[8086]], the modern ubiquitous [[Intel x86]] processors still uses the primary accumulator EAX and the secondary accumulator EDX for multiplication and division of large numbers. For instance, MUL ECX will multiply the 32-bit registers ECX and EAX and split the 64-bit result between EAX and EDX. However, MUL and DIV are special cases, other arithmetic-logical instructions (ADD, SUB, CMP, AND, OR, XOR, TEST) may specify any of the eight registers EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, ESP, EBP, ESI, EDI as the accumulator (i.e. left operand and destination); x86 is thus a fairly general register architecture, despite being based on an accumulator model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Irvine |first= Kip R. |title= Assembly Language for Intel-Based Computers |year= 2007 |edition= 5th edition |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-238310-1 |pages=633, 622}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 64-bit extension of x86, [[x86-64]], has been further generalized to 14 instead of 6 general registers.

Arrested in Pakistan in March 2002, he has been in US custody for more than eight years, four-and-a-half of them spent incommunicado in [[solitary confinement]] in undisclosed locations. He was subjected to the technique of [[waterboarding]] and has allegedly been subjected to numerous other interrogation techniques. These techniques, include forced nudity, [[sleep deprivation]], confinement in small dark boxes, deprivation of solid food, cold temperatures, [[stress positions]], and physical assaults. Videotapes of some of his interrogations are believed to be amongst those [[2005 CIA interrogation tapes destruction|destroyed by the CIA in 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/TheLaw/story?id=4244423&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2010/03/15/abu-zubaydahs-torture-diary/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.democracynow.org/2009/3/30/headlines&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.propublica.org/article/do-cia-cables-show-doctors-monitoring-torture-528&lt;/ref&gt;

He is now in the Guantanamo Bay Detention Centre in Cuba. Sections of the Pakistani media had reported at that time that Abu Zubaidah, a Palestinian, had studied computer science in Pune before crossing over into Pakistan and joining Al Qaeda.

Elzahabi told the ''Globe and Mail'' that Abu Zubaydah had served under him when he was a squad commander during the war against the Soviets.  Elzahabi said that after the Soviet ouster Elzahabi worked as an instructor at Khalden.

==Early activities==
By 1999, the U.S. Government was attempting to run surveillance on Abu Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;PressTrustIndia&quot;&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-4648752_ITM ''Pak leadership under Sharif offered to try to capture Osama'' The Press Trust of India Ltd. Through Asia Pulse. March 28, 2004] (Access My Library Link, requires free membership)&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2000, United States officials were reporting that Abu Zubaydah was a &quot;senior bin Laden official&quot;, the &quot;former head of Egypt-based Islamic Jihad&quot;, a &quot;trusted aide&quot; to bin Laden with &quot;growing power,&quot; who had &quot;played a key role in the East Africa embassy attacks.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DavidVise&quot;&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-513940.html David A. Vise and Lorraine Adams, ''Bin Laden Weakened, Officials Say'' The Washington Post. March 11, 2000] (Highbeam News Database Link, requires free membership)&lt;/ref&gt; None of these allegations have been corroborated at this point, however.

Internationally Abu Zubaydah was convicted in absentia by a Jordanian court for his alleged role in plots to bomb U.S. and Israeli targets in Jordan.&lt;ref name=&quot;JamalHalaby&quot;&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-26114220.html Jamal Halaby, ''Arabs of Terror Linked to bin Laden'' AP News Online] (Highbeam News Database Link, requires free membership)&lt;/ref&gt; A senior Middle East security official stated Abu Zubaydah had directed the Jordanian cell and was part of “bin Laden’s inner circle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TraineesInTerror&quot;&gt;[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000305&amp;slug=4008236 ''Trainees in Terror'' The Seattle Times, Sunday, March 5, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August, 2001 a classified FBI report entitled “Bin Laden determined to strike in U.S.”, which would not become public until much later, stated that the foiled millennium bomber, [[Ahmed Ressam]], had confessed that Abu Zubaydah had not only encouraged him to blow up the Los Angeles airport, but had facilitated his mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;BinLadenReport&quot;&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/10/august6.memo/index.html ''Transcript: Bin Laden determined to Strike in US'' CNN.com, Saturday April 10, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; The report also claims Abu Zubaydah was planning his own attack on the U.S.&lt;ref name=BinLadenReport/&gt; An unclassified FBI report also stated that Ahmed Ressam attempted to buy a laptop for Abu Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;ElaineGanley&quot;&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-80592999.html Elaine Ganley, ''Terror Plot Took Typical Path'' AP Online, December 19, 2001] (Highbeam News Database Link, requires free membership)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all of these supposed connections, when Ahmed Ressam went to trial in December 2001 federal prosecutors did not attempt to link him to Abu Zubaydah, and did not use any of this supposed evidence in its case.&lt;ref name=ElaineGanley/&gt; He also recanted his confessions after the trial saying he was coerced into giving them.

==Capture==

It is unclear how the Government found Abu Zubaydah. U.S. officials claimed he was tracked down after making a phone call to al-Qaeda leaders in Yemen.&lt;ref name=&quot;TedBridis&quot;&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-52457420.html Ted Bridis ''U.S. Will Seek Death Penalty In Spy Case'' The Columbian, April 20, 2002] (Highbeam News Database Link, requires free membership)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has been questioned by a CIA official who stated that the U.S. paid $10 million to the Pakistani government, who had in turn bribed the information on his whereabouts from a local driver in [[Faisalabad]].&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt; Pakistani intelligence discovered that he was traveling in disguise as a [[burka]]-clad woman.&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt; Saudi Arabian officials claimed Abu Zubaydah was captured after intelligence gleaned during an interrogation by their GSS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nowaf Obaid&quot;&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-404238.html Nowaf Obaid, ''The Saudis’ Fight Too: We’re on the same side in the war on terror'' The Washington Post, December 26, 2002] (Highbeam News Database Link, requires free membership)&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported in 2008 that [[Deuce Martinez]], a CIA analyst, had played an integral role in narrowing down Abu Zubaydah’s supposed hideouts to the 14 targeted by the joint raids.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScottShaneInside9/11Mastermind&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/washington/22ksm.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1 Scott Shane, ''Inside a 9/11 mastermind’s interrogation'' New York Times, June 22, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[pocket litter]] supposedly contained two [[bank card]]s which showed he had access to Saudi and Kuwaiti bank accounts, which was considered rare since most al-Qaeda members used the preferred untraceable [[hawala]] banking.&lt;ref name=&quot;risen&quot;/&gt; According to [[James Risen]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;It is not clear whether an investigation of the cards simply fell through the cracks, or whether they were ignored because no one wanted to know the answers about connections between al Qaeda and important figures in the Middle East -- particularly in Saudi Arabia.&quot; One of Risen's sources chalks up the failure to investigate the cards to incompetence rather than foul play: &quot;The cards were sent back to Washington and were never fully exploited. I think nobody ever looked at them because of incompetence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;risen&quot;/&gt; When American investigators finally did get around to looking into the cards, they worked with &quot;a Muslim financier with a questionable past, and with connections to the Afghan Taliban, al Qaeda, and Saudi intelligence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;risen&quot;/&gt; He reported back that &quot;Saudi intelligence officials had seized all of the records related to the card from the Saudi financial institution in question; the records then disappeared. There was no longer any way to trace the money that had gone into the account.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;risen&quot;/&gt;

Abu  Zubaydah was interrogated by two separate interrogation teams, one from  the FBI and one from the CIA.

Many of the interrogation techniques used against Abu Zubaydah, including waterboarding, cold cell, long-time standing, and sleep deprivation were previously considered illegal under U.S. and international law and treaties at the time of Abu Zubaydah’s capture.&lt;ref name=&quot;EnforcedDisappearance&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WalterPincusWaterboarding&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/04/AR2006100402005.html Walter Pincus, ''Waterboarding Historically Controversial'' The Washington Post, October 5, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the United States had prosecuted Japanese military officials after World War II and American soldiers after the Vietnam War for waterboarding.&lt;ref name=&quot;WalterPincusWaterboarding&quot;/&gt; Since 1930, the United States had defined sleep deprivation as an illegal form of torture.&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt; Many other techniques developed by the CIA constitute inhuman and degrading treatment and torture under the United Nations Convention against Torture and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;EnforcedDisappearance&quot;/&gt;

===International Committee of the Red Cross report===
The International Committee of the Red Cross concluded a report on the treatment of 14 high-value detainees in February 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt; The report would be made public April 7, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACLUICRC&quot;&gt;[http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/39296prs20090407.html ''Full ICRC Report Further Underscores Extent of Torture And Abuse By U.S. Officials'' ACLU, April 4, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The report is composed of interviews with the detainees, although the ICRC stated &quot;[t]he ICRC wishes to underscore that the consistency of the detailed allegations provided separately by each of the fourteen [detainees] adds particular weight to the information provided.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt; The ICRC outlined twelve interrogation techniques suffocation by water (waterboarding), prolonged stress standing position, beatings by use of a collar, beating and kicking, confinement in a box, prolonged nudity, sleep deprivation, exposure to cold temperature, prolonged shackling, threats of ill-treatment, forced shaving, and deprivation/restricted provision of solid food.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt; Of the 12 interrogation techniques, only Abu Zubaydah was subjected to all of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt;

Abu Zubaydah was the only one of the fourteen detainees to be put into close confinement.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt; This would be corroborated, in part, by one of the Torture Memos written by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel, which noted &quot;[i]n OMS's view, however, cramped confinement &quot;ha[s] not proved particularly effective&quot; because it provides &quot;a safehaven offering respite from interrogation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;May302005BradburyMemo&quot;&gt;[http://luxmedia.vo.llnwd.net/o10/clients/aclu/olc_05302005_bradbury.pdf Steven Bradbury ''Memoradnum for John A.

The May 10, 2005 torture memo stated that no more than 60 applications of water could be conducted in a 30 day period. However, that number applied only to those applications of &quot;ten seconds or more.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;May102005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; A U.S. official with knowledge of the interrogation program reported to Fox News that many of the applications lasted &quot;a matter of seconds&quot; and it was these less than ten second applications &quot;that created the huge numbers.&quot; He further stated that &quot;[a]ll of those individual pours were scrupulously counted by the CIA, according to the memos, to abide by the procedures set up for the waterboardings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JosephAbrams&quot;&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/28/despite-reports-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-waterboarded-times Joseph Abrams ''Despite Reports, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Was Not Waterboarded 183 Times'' Fox News, April 28, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the May 10, 2005 torture memo reported that the Department of Justice, Inspector General report noted that &lt;blockquote&gt; [T]he waterboard technique… was different from the technique described in the DoJ opinion and used in the SERE training. The difference was in the manner in which the detainee’s breathing was obstructed. At the SERE school and in the DoJ opinion the subject’s airflow is disrupted by the firm application of a damp cloth over the air passage; the interrogator applies a small amount of water to the cloth in a controlled manner. By contrast, the Agency interrogator… applied large volumes of water to a cloth that covered the detainee’s mouth and nose. One of the psychologists/interrogators acknowledged that the Agency’s use of the technique is different from that used in SERE training because it is ‘for real’ and is ‘more poignant and convincing.’” The Inspector General further reported that “OMS contends that the expertise of the SERE psychologist/interrogator on the waterboard was probably misrepresented at the time, as the SERE waterboard experience is so different from the subsequent Agency usage as to make it almost irrelevant. Consequently, according to OMS, there was no a prior reason to believe that applying the waterboard with the frequency and intensity with which it was used by the psychologist/interrogators was either efficacious or medically safe.&lt;ref name=&quot;May102005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Inspector General also noted that the use of waterboarding was discontinued in every armed services branch except the Navy SERE training &quot;because of its dramatic effect on the students who were subjects.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;May102005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; The CIA Office of Medical Services contradicted this conclusion, however, stating that “[w]hile SERE trainers believe that trainees are unable to maintain psychological resistance to the waterboard our experience was otherwise. Some subjects unquestionably can withstand a large number of applications, with no immediately discernible cumulative impact beyond their strong aversion to the experience.”&lt;ref name=&quot;May102005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; The memo also noted that at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Douglas Johnson, Executive Director of the Center for Victims of Torture, testified that some U.S. military personnel who have undergone waterboard training have apparently stated “that it’s taken them 15 years of therapy to get over it&quot;, although his claim has not substantiated.&lt;ref name=&quot;May102005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; Despite the conflicting information the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel approved all of the tactics listed above.&lt;ref name=&quot;May102005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt;

Several people who have subjected themselves to controlled waterboarding have stated that it is torture.&lt;ref name=&quot;JoshWhite&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/08/AR2007110802150.html Josh White ''Waterboarding Is Torture, Says Ex-Navy Instructor'' The Washington Post, November 9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RichardMezo&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/08/AR2008020803156.html?sub-AR Richard E.

It was instantaneous... and I don't want to say this: absolutely torture.&quot;&lt;ref name=RachelWeiner/&gt;

Malcolm Wrightson Nance, an instructor at the Navy’s SERE school in California testified before congress that waterboarding “is an overwhelming experience that induces horror and triggers frantic survival instincts. As the event unfolded, I was fully conscious of what was happening: I was being tortured.”&lt;ref name=&quot;JoshWhite&quot;/&gt; Nance further testified that waterboarding is “[N]ot simulated anything. It’s slow motion suffocation with enough time to contemplate the inevitability of blackout and expiration.”&lt;ref name=&quot;JoshWhite&quot;/&gt; Richard E. Mezo, who was waterboarded during training to become a Navy flight crewmember described waterboarding as an act that is “indeed torture” which is “real drowning that simulates death.”&lt;ref name=&quot;RichardMezo&quot;/&gt; The experience was so horrific, Mezo stated that “Pulling out my fingernails or even cutting off a finger would have been preferable.”&lt;ref name=&quot;RichardMezo&quot;/&gt; Henri Alleg, who was waterboarded by the French during the Algerian War, wrote that “a terrible agony, that of death itself, took possession of me.”&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredMcCoy&quot;/&gt;

Abu Zubaydah said of his experience:&lt;blockquote&gt; I struggled against the straps, trying to breathe, but it was hopeless. I thought I was going to die.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; During his waterboarding Abu Zubaydah lost control of his bladder and would later admit to the ICRC that &quot;[s]ince then I still lose control of my urine when under stress.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt;

Some politicians and administration officials, including Richard Armitage, the former Deputy Secretary of State, Mike McConnell, the former National Intelligence Directorate, Tom Ridge, the former Homeland Security Secretary, and former Republican Presidential Candidate John McCain, have also declared it unequivocal torture.&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AmyGoodman&quot;&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2008/7/18/the_dark_side_jane_mayer_on Amy Goodman ''The Dark Side: Jane Mayer on the Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals, Interview Transcript'' Democracy Now, July 18, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Senator John McCain stated “It is not a complicated procedure.

In the Spring of 2002, immediately following Abu Zubaydah’s capture, top US Government officials including Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, George Tenet, Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, and John Ashcroft discussed at length whether or not the CIA could legally use harsh techniques against Abu Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkMazetti&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/washington/25detain.html Mark Mazzetti ''Bush Aides Linked to Talks on Interrogations'' New York Times, September 24, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BushAwareInterrogations&quot;&gt;[http://abclocal.go.com/kfsn/story?section=news/national_world&amp;id=6076727 ''Bush aware of advisers’ interrogation talks'' ABC News, April 11, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Condoleezza Rice specifically mentioned the SERE program during the meeting stating “I recall being told that U.S. military personnel were subjected to training to certain physical and psychological interrogation techniques…”&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkMazetti&quot;/&gt; In addition, in 2002 and 2003, several Democratic congressional leaders were briefed on the proposed “enhanced interrogation techniques.”&lt;ref name=&quot;WarrickAndEggen&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/08/AR2007120801664.html?hpid=topnews Joby Warrick and Dan Eggen ''Hill Briefed on Waterboarding in 2002'' The Washington Post, December 9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; These congressional leaders included Nancy Pelosi, the future Speaker of the House, and Representative Jane Harman.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarrickAndEggen&quot;/&gt; Congressional officials have stated that the attitude in the briefings ranged from “quiet acquiescence, if not downright support.”&lt;ref name=&quot;WarrickAndEggen&quot;/&gt; The documents show that top U.S. Officials were intimately involved in the discussion and approval of the harsher interrogation techniques used on Abu Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkMazetti&quot;/&gt; Condoleezza Rice ultimately told the CIA the harsher interrogation tactics were acceptable,&lt;ref name=&quot;RiceOkayedWaterboarding&quot;&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/22/timeline-released-senate-shows-condoleezza-rice-okd-waterboarding/ ''As Bush Adviser, Rice Gave OK to Waterboard'' Fox News, April 22, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SenateReportRice&quot;&gt;''Senate Report: Rice, Cheney OK'd CIA use of waterboarding'' CNN, April 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and Dick Cheney stated &quot;I signed off on it; so did others.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SenateReportRice&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JasonLeopold&quot;&gt;[http://www.atlanticfreepress.com/news/1/6983--cheney-admits-he-signed-off-on-waterboarding-of-three-guantanamo-prisoners.html Jason Leopold ''Cheney Admits He 'Signed Off' on Waterboarding of Three Guantanamo Prisoners'' Atlantic Free Press, December 29, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; During the discussions John Ashcroft is reported as saying “Why are we talking about this in the White House?

===The torture memos===
{{main|Torture Memos}}
In 2009, President Obama released four Justice Department memos which outlined the procedures CIA operatives wished to use on Abu Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;ObamaReleasesBushTortureMemos&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/16/torture-memos-bush-administration Ewen MacAskill ''Obama releases Bush torture memos'' The Guardian, April 16, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MazettiAndShaneInterrogationMemos&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/us/politics/17detain.html Mark Mazetti and Scott Shane ''Interrogation Memos Detail Harsh Tactics by the C.I.A.''

====Opposition within the Bush Administration====
The memos were opposed by members of the White House and Congress. Within the White House Philip Zelikow, a top advisor to Condoleezza Rice, opposed the new, harsher interrogation techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhilipZelikow&quot;&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30369127/ ''Rachel Maddow Interview of Philip Zelikow, Transcript'' MSNBC, April 23, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reading the August 1, 2002 memo which justified the torture, Zelikow authored his own memo contesting the Justice Department's conclusions, since he believed they were legally incorrect.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhilipZelikow&quot;/&gt; The Bush Administration attempted to collect all of the copies of Zelikow's memo and destroy them.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanNewsweek&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PhilipZelikow&quot;/&gt; In addition, military advisors to the CIA declared the proposed tactics as torture thirteen times within two pages in a memo regarding the techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAIgnored&quot;&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5221190/CIA-ignored-warnings-from-US-soldiers-that-torture-and-extreme-stress-would-not-work.html Philip Sherwell and Leonard Doyle ''CIA ignored warnings from US soldiers that torture and extreme stress would not work'' The Telegraph, April 25, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The memo was written one month before the torture memos were drafted and the interrogation techniques were used against Abu Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAIgnored&quot;/&gt;

In Congress, House Representative Jane Harman, who was briefed on the proposed enhanced interrogation techniques in 2002, was the sole member of Congress to object.&lt;ref name=&quot;TopMembersOk&quot;&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,316256,00.html ''Report: Top Members of Congress Were OK With Waterboarding in 2002'' Fox News, December 9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Former CIA Inspector General, John Helgerson, drafted a report in 2004 which reportedly condemns not only the legality of the torture memos, but also the effectiveness of the torture techniques used.&lt;ref name=&quot;JaneMayerCIA&quot;&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2009/06/cia-interrogations-disclosure.html Jane Mayer ''Jane Mayer: C.I.A.

Sawyer]], a seminal case on the powers of the Executive in times of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOJReportYoo&quot;/&gt; In addition, Jack Goldsmith, the former head of the Office of Legal Counsel who withdrew the torture memos before resigning, stated he was &quot;astonished&quot; by the &quot;deeply flawed&quot; and &quot;sloppily reasoned&quot; legal analysis in the memos.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOJReportYoo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DOJTortureReport&quot;&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/184801 Michael Isikoff ''A Torture Report Could Spell Big Trouble For Bush Lawyers'' Newsweek, February 14, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; David Luban, a law professor at Georgetown Law School, testified before Congress on May 13, 2009 that the memos were &quot;an ethical train wreck&quot; and had been drafted to &quot;reverse engineer&quot; a defense for illegal actions already committed.&lt;ref name=&quot;BobbyGhosh&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1898125,00.html Bobby Ghosh ''Partisan Passions Dominate Interrogation Hearings'' Time, May 13, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The memo contemplated ten techniques the interrogators wanted to use: &quot;(1) attention grasp, (2) walling, (3) facial hold, (4) facial slap (insult slap), (5) cramped confinement, (6) wall standing, (7) stress positions, (8) sleep deprivation, (9) insects placed in a confinement box, and (10) the waterboard.”&lt;ref name=&quot;August2002BybeeMemo&quot;/&gt; Many of the techniques were, until then, generally considered illegal.&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EnforcedDisappearance&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WalterPincusWaterboarding&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AmyGoodman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkMazetti&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;August02TortureMemoReleased&quot;/&gt; Many other techniques developed by the CIA constituted inhumane and degrading treatment and torture under the United Nations Convention against Torture and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;EnforcedDisappearance&quot;/&gt;

According to a psychological evaluation conducted of Abu Zubaydah upon his capture, the memo alleges that Abu Zubaydah:

*Quickly rose from very low level mujahedin to third or fourth man in al Qaeda
*Served as Usama Bin Laden’s senior lieutenant
*Managed a network of training camps
*Was instrumental in the training of operatives for al Qaeda, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and other terrorist elements inside Pakistan and Afghanistan
*Acted as the Deputy Camp Commander for al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan, personally approving entry and graduation of all trainees during 1999-2000
*Approved all individuals going in and out of Afghanistan to the training camps from 1996–1999
*No one went in and out of Peshawar, Pakistan without his knowledge and approval
*Acted as al Qaeda’s coordinator of external contacts and foreign communications
*Acted as al Qaeda’s counter-intelligence officer and had been trusted to find spies within the organization
*Was involved in every major terrorist operation carried out by al Qaeda
*Was a planner for the Millennium plot to attack U.S. and Israeli targets during the Millennium celebrations in Jordan
*Served as a planner for the Paris Embassy plot in 2001
*Was one of the planners of 9/11
*Engaged in planning future terrorist attacks against U.S. interests
*Wrote al Qaeda’s manual on resistance techniques&lt;ref name=&quot;August2002BybeeMemo&quot;/&gt;

====May 10, 2005 memo====
Another subsequent memo addressed the legality of additional interrogation techniques such as nudity, dietary manipulation, abdominal slap, water dousing, and water flicking.&lt;ref name=&quot;May102005BradburyMemo&quot;&gt;[http://luxmedia.vo.llnwd.net/o10/clients/aclu/olc_05102005_bradbury46pg.pdf Steven Bradbury ''Memorandum for John A.

In any given day that waterboarding occurs interrogators may use no more than two “sessions”, with a “session” defined as the time that the detainee is strapped to the board, and that a session can last no more than 2 hours.

====May 10, 2005 memo (combined interrogation techniques)====
Another memo penned on May 10, 2005 authorized the use of the above outlined individual techniques in conjunction with one another, but stressed the importance of constant vigilance on the part of medical observers to ensure the techniques did not cause &quot;severe physical or mental pain.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;May102005BradburyCombinedMemo&quot;&gt;[http://luxmedia.vo.llnwd.net/o10/clients/aclu/olc_05102005_bradbury20pg.pdf Steven Bradbury ''Memorandum For John A.

====May 30, 2005 memo====
The final memo mentioned Abu Zubaydah several times and claimed that due to the increased interrogation techniques Zubaydah also &quot;provided significant information on two operatives, [including] Jose Padilla[,] who planned to build and detonate a 'dirty bomb' in the Washington DC area.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;May302005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; This claim is heavily disputed, however, by Ali Soufan the FBI interrogator who first interrogated Abu Zubaydah following his capture, and other intelligence officials.&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanOpEd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanNewsweek&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanTestimony&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MazettiAndJohnston&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/washington/09zubaydah.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world&amp;oref=slogin Mark Mazzetti and David Johnston ''Inquiry Begins Into Destruction of Tapes'' New York Times, December 9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Soufan, when asked by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse during a Congressional hearing if the memo was incorrect, testified that it was.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkBenjamin&quot;&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/05/14/torture/ Mark Benjamin ''Soufan: CIA torture actually hindered our intelligence gathering'' Salon, May 14, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the memo itself noted that not all of the waterboarding sessions were necessary for Abu Zubaydah, since the on-scene interrogation team determined he had stopped producing actionable intelligence.&lt;ref name=&quot;May302005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; The memo reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is not to say that the interrogation program has worked perfectly. According to the IG Report, the CIA, at least initially, could not always distinguish detainees who had information but were successfully resisting interrogation from those who did not actually have the information. See IG Report at 83-85. On at least one occasion, this may have resulted in what might be deemed in retrospect to have been the unnecessary use of enhanced techniques. On that occasion, although the on-scene interrogation team judged Abu Zubaydah to be compliant, elements within CIA Headquarters still believed he was withholding information. See id at 84. At the direction of CIA Headquarters interrogators therefore used the waterboard one more time on Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;May302005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===U.S. officials defend interrogation techniques===
Dennis C. Blair, President Obama's new director of national intelligence wrote in a memo to his staff in April 2009 that &quot;high value information came from interrogations in which [enhanced interrogation] methods were used.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ScottShaneEffectiveness&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/us/politics/23detain.html?_r=1&amp;th&amp;emc=th Scott Shane ''Interrogations' Effectiveness May Prove Elusive'' New York Times, April 22, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Former Vice-President, Dick Cheney claims there are memos in existence which show the success of the enhanced interrogation techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;CheneyCallsForRelease&quot;&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/20/cheney-calls-release-memos-showing-results-interrogation-efforts-1862515294/ ''Cheney Calls for Release of Memos Showing Results of Interrogation Efforts'' April 20, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Cheney stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I haven't talked about it, but I know specifically of reports that I read, that I saw, that lay out what we learned through the interrogation process and what the consequences were for the country I've now formally asked the CIA to take steps to declassify those memos so we can lay them out there and the American people have a chance to see what we obtained and what we learned and how good the intelligence was.&lt;ref name=CheneyCallsForRelease/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally, four successive CIA directors echoed these sentiments, with the most recent, Michael V. Hayden, stating that he believed the methods &quot;got the maximum amount of information&quot; from prisoners, specifically Abu Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScottShaneEffectiveness&quot;/&gt; As noted, however, the belief that enhanced interrogation techniques were necessary to get actionable intel from Abu Zubaydah has been heavily contested. John McLaughlin, former acting CIA director, stated in 2006 &quot;I totally disagree with the view that the capture of Abu Zubaydah was unimportant. Abu Zubaydah was woven through all of the intelligence prior to 9/11 that signaled a major attack was coming, and his capture yielded a great deal of important information.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SuskindBlitzer&quot;&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0606/20/sitroom.02.html ''Transcript for THE SITUATION ROOM with Wolf Blitzer'' CNN, June 20, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir, former [[Director of Central Intelligence|CIA Director]] [[George Tenet]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A published report in 2006 contended that Abu Zubaydah was mentally unstable and that the administration had overstated his importance. Baloney. Abu Zubaydah had been at the crossroads of many al-Qa'ida operations and was in position to - and did - share critical information with his interrogators. Apparently, the source of the rumor that Abu Zubaydah was unbalanced was his personal diary, in which he adopted various personas. From that shaky perch, some junior Freudians leapt to the conclusion that Zubaydah had multiple personalities. In fact, Agency psychiatrists eventually determined that in his diary he was using a sophisticated literary device to express himself. And, boy, did he express himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeorgeTenet&quot;&gt;George Tenet ''At the Center of the Storm: My years at the CIA'' HarperCollins, April 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The changing depiction of Abu Zubaydah==
When Abu Zubaydah was captured, the Bush Administration believed he was an unparalleled source of intelligence on al-Qaeda and terrorism plots. Abu Zubaydah was touted as the biggest catch of the War on Terror until the capture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.&lt;ref name=&quot;9/11MastermindNabbed&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/02/terror/main542459.shtml ''Alleged 9-11 Mastermind Nabbed'' CBS News, March 1, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after Abu Zubaydah’s capture the director of the FBI stated Abu Zubaydah’s capture would help deter future attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsSummary&quot;&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE5DB1E3AF937A35757C0A9649C8B63 ''NEWS SUMMARY: Arrest May Deter Attacks'' New York Times, April 4, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer stated Abu Zubaydah could provide a treasure-trove of information about al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsRecap&quot;/&gt; Donald Rumsfeld echoed these sentiments claiming Abu Zubaydah was “a man who knows of additional attacks”, who has “trained people to do this”, and was a big fish who had a fountain of knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;RumsfeldTranscript040302&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=3390 Donald Rumsfeld ''News Transcript'' Department of Defense, April 3, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. government accounts of Abu Zubaydah's importance===
After Abu Zubaydah's capture, officials from the U.S. Government spoke out publicly about Abu Zubaydah's supposed role in al-Qaeda. However, as would later be reported in 2009, the U.S. Government's depiction of Abu Zubaydah was overly inflated and he was, as Justice Department Officials stated, &quot;[t]he above ground support...

Numerous anonymous U.S. officials have also made allegations against Abu Zubaydah in the press, including:

While Abu Zubaydah would provide important intelligence on the War on Terror, his value as an intel source was greatly inflated, much like his role in the global terror network.

Despite all of these allegations the U.S. Government has not officially charged Abu Zubaydah with any crimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;CurrentChargeSheets&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissions.html Department of Defense Military Commissions Cases Website, April 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploitation of Abu Zubaydah's perceived value===
President Bush personally used Abu Zubaydah’s perceived “value” as a detainee to justify the use of the CIA's harsher interrogation techniques&lt;ref name=&quot;Bush092006Speech&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/06/washington/06bush_transcript.html?pagewanted=all ''George W.

In a speech in 2006, President Bush claimed that Abu Zubaydah initially revealed useful intelligence, including information that allegedly helped foil a terrorist attack on American soil, but that Abu Zubaydah became uncooperative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bush092006Speech&quot;/&gt; It was only then, he reported, that an “alternative set of procedures” was used on Abu Zubaydah in order to gain valuable intelligence and were “safe and lawful.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Bush092006Speech&quot;/&gt; He also stated that Abu Zubaydah had received training in how to resist interrogation, and thus more aggressive techniques were mandated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bush092006Speech&quot;/&gt; These claims directly conflict with the reports of the original F.B.I. agents tasked with interrogating Abu Zubaydah who had been receiving crucial pieces of information from him without the use of harsher techniques,&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanOpEd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanNewsweek&quot;/&gt; as well as other government officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;FinnAndWarrick&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesProfileZubaydah&quot;&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/z/abu_zubaydah/index.html ''Abu Zubaydah'' New York Times, April 20, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Iraq War====
The U.S. Government used questionable intel from Abu Zubaydah in order to justify the invasion of Iraq. U.S. officials stated that the allegations that Iraq and al-Qaeda were linked in the training of people on chemical weapons came from Abu Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;HutchesonAndKuhnhenn&quot;&gt;[http://www2.jsonline.com/news/nat/sep02/83149.asp Ron Hutcheson and James Kuhnhenn ''Iraq deal with Congress nears, Bush says'' Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, September 26, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BushSaysIraq&quot;&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7430560_ITM ''Bush Says He and Congress Will Band Together on Iraq; Capitol Hill Still Sour'' Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News, September 27, 2002] (Access My Library Link, requires free membership)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TorturedLie&quot;&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/andrew_sullivan/article6168270.ece Andrew Sullivan ''One tortured lie: that's all it took for war'' The Sunday Times, April 26, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The officials noted there was no independent verification of his claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;HutchesonAndKuhnhenn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BushSaysIraq&quot;/&gt; The U.S. Government included statements made by Abu Zubaydah in regards to al Qaeda’s ability to obtain a dirty bomb in its attempts to show a link between Iraq and al Qaeda.&lt;ref name=&quot;FritzUmbach&quot;&gt;[http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/04/13/document_dump/ Fritz Umbach ''Bush’s bogus document dump'' The Salon, April 13, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Senate Intelligence Committee report Abu Zubaydah also “indicated that he had heard that an important al Qaeda associate, Abu Musab al Zarqawi, and others had good relationships with Iraqi intelligence.”&lt;ref name=&quot;StephenHayes&quot;&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/803czhfn.asp?pg=2 Stephen F.

In the Senate Armed Services Committee report on the abuses of detainees, it was revealed that pressure from the Bush administration was applied to interrogators to find a link between Iraq and Al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name=&quot;BanalityOfBush&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/opinion/26rich.html Frank Rich ''The Banality of Bush White House Evil'' The New York Times, April 25, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Major Paul Burney, a psychiatrist with the United States Army, reported that &quot;while we were [at Guantanamo] a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between Al Qaeda and Iraq and we were not being successful.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BanalityOfBush&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmedServicesDetaineeReport&quot;&gt;[http://armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Detainee%20Report%20Final_April%2022%202009.pdf Senate Armed Services Committee ''Inquiry Into the Treatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody'' Senate Armed Services Committee, November 20, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that higher-ups for more &quot;frustrated&quot; and applied &quot;more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BanalityOfBush&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmedServicesDetaineeReport&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EdBrayton&quot;&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2009/05/the_lies_on_torture_just_keep.php Ed Brayton ''The Lies on Torture Just Keep Coming'' Science Blogs, May 4, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Colonel Lawrence B. Wilkerson, the former chief of staff for former Secretary of State Colin Powell has stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Likewise, what I have learned is that as the administration authorized harsh interrogation in April and May of 2002--well before the Justice Department had rendered any legal opinion--its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at pre-empting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al-Qa'ida.

So furious was this effort that on one particular detainee, even when the interrogation team had reported to Cheney's office that their detainee &quot;was compliant&quot; (meaning the team recommended no more torture), the VP's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods. The detainee had not revealed any al-Qa'ida-Baghdad contacts yet. This ceased only after Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, under waterboarding in Egypt, &quot;revealed&quot; such contacts. Of course later we learned that al-Libi revealed these contacts only to get the torture to stop.&lt;ref name=ArmedServicesDetaineeReport/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====The Military Commissions Act====
President Bush also asked Congress in a speech in September 2006 to formulate special rules in order to try Abu Zubaydah via military commission in Guantanamo Bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarrenRichey&quot;&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0915/p01s02-usju.html?s=widep Warren Richey ''‘Alternative’ CIA tactics complicate Padilla case'' Christian Science Monitor, September 15, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in late April 2002 less than one month after Abu Zubaydah’s capture, Justice Department officials stated Abu Zubaydah “is a near-ideal candidate for a tribunal trial.”&lt;ref name=&quot;NeilALewis&quot;&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E2DE103FF932A15757C0A9649C8B63 Neail A.

Bush'' CNN, September 20, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Government has yet to try Abu Zubaydah by military commission, article 3 court, or in any other capacity.

====The Bush Administration's domestic spying program====
In addition to justifying the use of presently illegal torture techniques, the Bush administration used Abu Zubaydah’s capture as justification to accelerate its domestic spying program to allow quick action on the phone numbers and addresses seized during Abu Zubaydah’s capture.&lt;ref name=&quot;RisenAndLichtblau&quot;&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/12/16/news/spy.php?page=2 James Risen and Eric Lichtblau ''Bush altered rules on spying'' International Herald Tribune, December 17, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Inexplicably the NSA expanded its surveillance beyond the numbers seized during Abu Zubaydah’s capture.&lt;ref name=&quot;AzizHug&quot;&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-26038899_ITM Aziz Huq ''Who’s watching whom?''

In 2004 media coverage of Abu Zubaydah began listing him as a “disappeared” prisoner claiming he had no access to the International Red Cross.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReedBrody&quot;&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/11/opinion/edbrody.php Reed Brody ''Prisoners who disappear'' International Herald Tribune, October 12, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, U.S. officials claim the CIA was growing uncomfortable keeping Abu Zubaydah in indefinite custody.&lt;ref name=&quot;JehlAndJohnstonAndLewis&quot;&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-105455175.html Douglas Jehl, David Johnston, and Neil A. Lewis ''CIA called uncomfortable with role on war prisoners Holding terror suspects raises concerns'' International Herald Tribune, February 16, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 18 months later Abu Zubaydah and the other high value detainees who had been in secret CIA custody were transferred to Guantanamo Bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;BartonGellman&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/19/AR2006061901211.html Barton Gellman ''The Shadow War, In a Surprising New Light'' Washington Post, June 20, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

After his transfer the CIA denied access to Abu Zubaydah even to the Department of Justice's Inspector General who was investigating the United States' treatment of its detainees.&lt;ref name=&quot;EmmaSchwartz&quot;&gt;[http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/2008/05/20/justice-dept-inspector-general-claims-cia-hampered-its-investigation.html Emma Schwartz ''Justice Dept. Inspector General Claims CIA Hampered its Investigation'' US News &amp; World Report, May 20, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to U.S. officials quoted in Ron Suskind’s book, President Bush allegedly told CIA director George Tenet “I said [Abu Zubaydah] was important. You’re not going to let me lose face on this, are you?”&lt;ref name=&quot;BartonGellman&quot;/&gt; Tenet replied “No sir, Mr. President.”&lt;ref name=&quot;BartonGellman&quot;/&gt;

===U.S. government admits Abu Zubaydah was never a member of al Qaeda===
Top officials in the U.S. government refused to believe Abu Zubaydah was not the operative they believed him to be.&lt;ref name=&quot;FinnAndWarrick&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;May302005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; The May 30, 2005 Department of Justice memo noted that while on-scene interrogators believed Abu Zubaydah no longer had any information to disclose, CIA Headquarters ordered additional waterboarding.&lt;ref name=&quot;May302005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; The interrogators believed the waterboarding was &quot;unnecessary.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;May302005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; Orders for the additional waterboarding likely came from Dick Cheney directly.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmedServicesDetaineeReport&quot;/&gt; Additionally, the Bush White House and CIA officials couldn't believe Abu Zubaydah didn't have additional information.&lt;ref name=&quot;FinnAndWarrick&quot;/&gt; One official stated the pressure from upper levels of government was &quot;tremendous,&quot; and that &quot;[t]hey couldn't stand the idea that there wasn't anything new.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FinnAndWarrick&quot;/&gt; The official said, &quot;[t]hey'd say, 'You aren't working hard enough.' There was both a disbelief in what he was saying and also a desire for retribution - a feeling that 'He's going to talk, and if he doesn't talk, we'll do whatever.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FinnAndWarrick&quot;/&gt;

However, in September 2009, the United States Government finally admitted, during Abu Zubaydah's habeas corpus petition, that Abu Zubaydah had never been a member of al-Qaeda, nor involved in the attacks on the African embassies in 1998, or the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;GovernmentWithdrawsCharges&quot;/&gt; The motion, filed by the United States Government, states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Evidence indicating that Petitioner is not a member of al-Qaida or had ideological differences with al-Qaida is not inconsistent with the factual allegations made in the Government's factual return, because the Government has not contended in this proceeding that Petitioner was a member of al-Qaida or otherwise formally identified with al-Qaida. Pg. 35, 36
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Respondent [The United States Government] does not contend that Petitioner [Abu Zubaydah] was a &quot;member&quot; of al-Qaida in the sense of having sworn a &lt;u&gt;bayat&lt;/u&gt; (allegiance) or having otherwise satisfied any formal criteria that either Petitioner [Abu Zubaydah] or al-Qaida may have considered necessary for inclusion in al-Qaida. Nor is the Government detaining Petitioner [Abu Zubaydah] based on any allegation that Petitioner [Abu Zubaydah] views himself as part of al-Qaida as a matter of subjective personal conscience, ideology, or worldview. Pg. 36
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Government has not contended in this proceeding that Petitioner [Abu Zubaydah] had any direct role in or advance knowledge of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Pg. 82
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For example, for purposes of this proceeding the Government has not contended that Petitioner [Abu Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executing either the 1998 embassy bombings... or the attacks on September 11, 2001. Pg. 34
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Charge sheet discrepancies====
In 2005, the U.S. Government charged several detainees at Guantanamo Bay and ordered them to stand trial in Military Commission Tribunals.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchivedChargeSheets&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsarchives.html ''Department of Defense Website: Archived Charge Sheets'' Department of Defense]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the ten detainees charged, four of them, Binyam Mohamed, Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi, Sufyian Barhoumi, and Jabrad Said bin Al-Qahtani referenced Abu Zubaydah in their charge sheets.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlQahtani2005ChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Nov2005/d20051104qahtani.pdf ''Jabran Said bin Al-Qahtani 2005 Charge Sheet'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlSharbi2005ChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Nov2005/d20051104sharbi.pdf ''Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi 2005 Charge Sheet'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barhoumi2005ChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Nov2005/d20051104barhoumi.pdf ''Sufyian Barhoumi 2005 Charge Sheet'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Binyam2005ChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Nov2005/d20051104muhammad.pdf ''Binyam Mohamed 2005 Charge Sheet'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the four detainees, Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi, Sufyian Barhoumi, and Jabran Said bin Al-Qahtani, had identical 2005 charge sheets and referenced Abu Zubaydah in six different paragraphs.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlQahtani2005ChargeSheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlSharbi2005ChargeSheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barhoumi2005ChargeSheet&quot;/&gt; The fourth detainee, Binyam Mohamed, referenced Abu Zubaydah five times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Binyam2005ChargeSheet&quot;/&gt;

In 2006, before the U.S. Government could hold a trial of the four detainees in a Military Commission Tribunal, the Supreme Court struck down the Tribunals as unconstitutional in Hamdan v. Bush.&lt;ref name=&quot;JosephMarguliesGuantanamo&quot;&gt;Joseph Margulies ''Guantanamo and the Abuse of Presidential Power'' Simon &amp; Schuster, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SuzanneGoldberg&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jun/30/usa.guantanamo Suzanne Goldenberg ''Supreme Court Rejects Bush Terror Powers'' The Guardian, June 30, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Government responded by amending the tribunals, although they were forced to recharge Binyam Mohamed, Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi, Sufyian Barhoumi, and Jabran Said bin Al-Qahtani in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;CurrentChargeSheets&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissions.html ''Department of Defense Military Commissions Website'' Department of Defense]&lt;/ref&gt;

The new 2008 charge sheets contained almost identical charges against each of the four detainees, as were found in their 2005 charge sheets.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlQahtani2008ChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/d20080529Qahtani.pdf ''Jabran Said bin Al-Qahtani 2008 Sworn Charges'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlSharbi2008ChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/d20080529Sharbi.pdf ''Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi’s 2008 Sworn Charges'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barhoumi2008ChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/d20080529Sufyian.pdf ''Sufyian Barhoumi’s 2008 Sworn Charges'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Binyam2008ChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Mohamed%20-%20sworn0603.pdf ''Binyam Mohamed 2008 Sworn Charges'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Abu Zubaydah’s name was entirely removed from each detainee’s charge sheet.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlQahtani2008ChargeSheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlSharbi2008ChargeSheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barhoumi2008ChargeSheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Binyam2008ChargeSheet&quot;/&gt; On October 21, 2008, all charges were dropped against the four men.&lt;ref name=&quot;JaneSutton&quot;&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE49K65120081021?sp=true Jane Sutton ''U.S. drops charges against 5 Guantanamo captives'' Reuters, October 21, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GuantanamoJudgeDefies&quot;&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/30/nation/na-guantanamo-judge30?pg=1 Carol J. Williams ''Guantanamo judge defies Obama'' Los Angeles Times, January 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Binyam Mohamed was released from Guantanamo Bay on February 20, 2009 despite his alleged connections to Abu Zubaydah, and thus has been removed from the Department of Defense Military Commissions Page.&lt;ref name=&quot;CurrentChargeSheets&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCProfileBinyam&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7906381.stm ''Profile: Binyam Mohamed'' BBC News, February 23, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the alleged emir of [[Khalden Camp]], [[Noor Uthman Muhammed]], was charged in 2008 with conspiring with Abu Zubaydah against the United States. However, the charges against Noor Uthman Muhammed were also completely dropped on October 21, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;JaneSutton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GuantanamoJudgeDefies&quot;/&gt; The U.S. Government recharged Noor Uthman Muhammed on December 22, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;NoorUthmanCurrentCharges&quot;/&gt; Abu Zubaydah's name is not found in any of the charges even though he was a facilitator for Noor Uthman Muhammed's Khalden Camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;NoorUthmanCurrentCharges&quot;/&gt;

Abu Zubaydah’s name is also not mentioned in any other detainee’s charge sheets, not even Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, the admitted mastermind of the 9/11 attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;CurrentChargeSheets&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EdPilkington&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/mar/15/alqaida.september11 Ed Pilkington '''I was responsible for 9/11, from A to Z' - a confession from Guantánamo Bay'' The Guardian, March 15, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Government has also failed to charge Abu Zubadyah, even though they have charged other high ranking al-Qaeda members, such as Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, who has been in custody less time than Abu Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;CurrentChargeSheets&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KSMCharges&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/d20080509Mohammed.pdf ''Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Charge Sheet'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the U.S. Government recharged two of the men, Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi and Jabran Said bin Al-Qahtani.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlSharbiCurrentChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/alSharbi.pdf ''Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi 2009 Charge Sheet'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlQahtaniCurrentChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/alQahtanisworn.pdf ''Jabran Said bin Al-Qahtani 2009 Charge Sheet'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Sufyian Barhoumi has not been recharged.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarhoumiChargesPage&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsBarhoumi.html ''Sufyian Barhoumi Military Commissions Page'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 charge sheet of al Sharbi reincorporates Abu Zubaydah in three paragraphs, while the 2009 charge sheet of Al-Qahtani reincorporated Abu Zubaydah in four paragraphs.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlSharbiCurrentChargeSheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlQahtaniCurrentChargeSheet&quot;/&gt; Unlike the 2005 charge sheets, which are archived on the Department of Defense website, Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi's 2008 Charge Sheet has been removed from his page.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlSharbiChargesPage&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsSharbi.html ''Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi Military Commissions Page'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

====International cases involving Abu Zubaydah====
Several individuals being held or tried internationally, who have been connected by the U.S. Government to Abu Zubaydah, have had their charges dropped, been released, or received other relief from their handlers.

=====Abousofian Abdelrazik=====
[[Abousofian Abdelrazik]] was alleged by the State Department to be closely associated with Abu Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;BradFoss&quot;&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-16119183_ITM Brad Foss ''State Department moves against Sudanese-Canadian for alleged terror ties'' The America’s Intelligence Wire, July 26, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Canada asked the United Nations to remove Abousfian Abdelrazik from its terrorism watch-list.&lt;ref name=&quot;PaulKoringOttawa&quot;&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080502.SUDAN02/TPStory/Front&amp;ord=123654973&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true Paul Koring ''Ottawa wants terrorism suspect taken off watch list'' Globe and Mail, February 5, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In June, 2009, Canada agreed to repatriate Abousfian Abdelrazik from Sudan where he has been stranded since 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;MichaelComte&quot;&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hUaf3TZSzmnZORHAtaID8uB1DNnw Michael Comte ''Canada will repatriate man said linked to Al-Qaeda'' AFP, June 18, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mohamed Harkat=====
Abu Zubaydah supposedly knew [[Mohamed Harkat]] “since the early 90’s”&lt;ref name=&quot;PeterCheney&quot;&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/front/RTGAM/20021218/wxalge1218/Front/homeBN/breakingnews Peter Cheney ''Bin Laden lieutenant identified suspect in Canada'' The Globe and Mail, December 18, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed Harkat ran a guest house in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;CanadaCourtUpholds&quot;&gt;''Court upholds Harkat’s security certificate'' CTV News, March 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Mohamed Harkat’s attorney sought access to Abu Zubaydah for testimony relating to Harkat’s trial, but the US refused to respond to his requests.&lt;ref name=&quot;HarkatLawyer&quot;&gt;[http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Canada/2007/08/26/4448108.html ''Lawyer for accused terrorist seeks access to Guantanamo detainee'' Edmonton Sun, August 26, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ahmed Ressam and the Millennium Plot====
In April 2001, Ahmed Ressam was convicted of plotting to detonate a bomb at the Los Angeles International Airport.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBSAhmedRessam&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/trail/inside/cron.html ''Amhed Ressam’s Millennium Plot'' PBS]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RessamTestimony&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/trail/inside/testimony.html ''Ahmed Ressam's Testimony at Mokhtar Haouari's Trial'' PBS]&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmed Ressam had previously trained at the Khalden camp before coming to the United States to undertake his mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;CsrtAbuZubaydahVerbatimTranscript&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PBSAhmedRessam&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RessamTestimony&quot;/&gt; Abu Zubaydah admits in his CSRT testimony that he recommended to the leader of Khalden Camp that Ahmed Ressam be allowed to train there.&lt;ref name=&quot;CsrtAbuZubaydahVerbatimTranscript&quot;/&gt; Abu Zubaydah further testified that he facilitated Ahmed Ressam’s travel to the camp as well as to Algeria once Ressam’s training was complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;CsrtAbuZubaydahVerbatimTranscript&quot;/&gt; The U.S. Government alleges, in Abu Zubaydah’s summary of evidence, that Ahmed Ressam identified Abu Zubaydah as the leader of the Khalden camp and an associate of Usama Bin Laden “equal to and not subordinate to UBL.”&lt;ref name=&quot;AbuZubaydahSummaryOfEvidence&quot;&gt;[http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/csrt_arb/000784-000819.pdf ''Abu Zubaydah Summary of Evidence'' Department of Defense]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Government further alleges that Ahmed Ressam stated that Abu Zubaydah had “known of Ahmed Ressam’s operation, although not specifically the date and exact target” and that Abu Zubaydah wanted Ressam to acquire “fraudulently-obtained Canadian passports” for himself and five others, in order to facilitate their travel into the United States to “possibly bomb several cities.”&lt;ref name=&quot;AbuZubaydahSummaryOfEvidence&quot;/&gt;

Abu Zubaydah admits he attempted to procure Canadian passports for Ahmed Ressam and other trainees, but not for &quot;terrorist-related activities.”.&lt;ref name=&quot;CsrtAbuZubaydahVerbatimTranscript&quot;/&gt; Abu Zubaydah denies ever having participated in the planning of the Millennium Plot or encouraging Ahmed Ressam to attack American targets or civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;CsrtAbuZubaydahVerbatimTranscript&quot;/&gt; The U.S. Government has not produced any further evidence of Abu Zubaydah’s alleged role in the Millennium Plot, nor was this connection even mentioned in Ahmed Ressam's criminal trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;RessamCaseDocs&quot;&gt;Ressam Case Documents, Accessed via PACER, December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Ressam's confessions were only brought up during his sentencing in an attempt to mitigate the sentence he would receive, and he later recanted them.&lt;ref name=&quot;RessamCaseDocs&quot;/&gt;

===Abu Zubaydah's mental health===
Some people contest Abu Zubaydah's mental health. Ron Suskind noted in his book, &lt;u&gt;The One Percent Doctrine&lt;/u&gt;, that Zubaydah turned out to be mentally ill, keeping a diary &quot;in the voice of three people: Hani 1, Hani 2, and Hani 3&quot; -- a boy, a young man and a middle-aged alter ego.&lt;ref name=&quot;SuskindOnePercent&quot;/&gt; Abu Zubaydah's diaries spanned ten years and recorded in numbing detail &quot;what he ate, or wore, or trifling things [people] said.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EggenPincusFBICIADebate&quot;/&gt; Dan Coleman, then the FBI's top al-Qaeda analyst, told a senior bureau official, &quot;This guy is insane, certifiable, split personality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SuskindOnePercent&quot;/&gt; According to Suskind, this judgment was &quot;echoed at the top of CIA and was briefed to the President and Vice President.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SuskindOnePercent&quot;/&gt; Dan Coleman, the FBI's senior expert on al Qaeda, echoed many of Suskind's sentiments in an interview with the Washington Post. Coleman stated Zubaydah was a &quot;safehouse keeper&quot; with mental problems, who &quot;claimed to know more about al-Qaeda and its inner workings than he really did.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EggenPincusFBICIADebate&quot;/&gt; Abu Zubaydah's co-counsel, Joseph Margulies, wrote in an OpEd in the LA Times that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Partly as a result of injuries he suffered while he was fighting the communists in Afghanistan, partly as a result of how those injuries were exacerbated by the CIA and partly as a result of his extended isolation, Abu Zubaydah's mental grasp is slipping away. Today, he suffers blinding headaches and has permanent brain damage. He has an excruciating sensitivity to sounds, hearing what others do not. The slightest noise drives him nearly insane. In the last two years alone, he has experienced about 200 seizures. Already, he cannot picture his mother's face or recall his father's name. Gradually, his past, like his future, eludes him.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarguliesZubaydah&quot;&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-margulies30-2009apr30,0,3309097.story Joseph Margulies ''Abu Zubaydah's suffering'' Los Angeles Times, April 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Tables generales aritmetique MG 2108.jpg|thumb|Arithmetic tables for children, Lausanne, 1835]]'''Arithmetic''' or '''arithmetics''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word ''ἀριθμός'' = number) is the oldest and most elementary branch of [[mathematics]], used by almost everyone, for tasks ranging from simple day-to-day counting to advanced [[science]] and [[business]] calculations. It involves the study of [[quantity]], especially as the result of combining [[number]]s. In common usage, it refers to the simpler properties when using the traditional [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] of [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] with smaller values of numbers. Professional [[mathematician]]s sometimes use the term ''(higher) arithmetic''&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Davenport|Davenport, Harold]], ''The Higher Arithmetic: An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers'' (7th ed.), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1999, ISBN 0-521-63446-6&lt;/ref&gt; when referring to more advanced results related to [[number theory]], but this should not be confused with [[elementary arithmetic]].

==History==
The prehistory of arithmetic is limited to a very small number of small artifacts which may indicate conception of addition and subtraction, the best-known being the [[Ishango bone]] from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|central Africa]], dating from somewhere between 20,000 and 18,000 BC although its interpretation is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudman|first=Peter Strom|title=How Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years|year=20007|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1591024774|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest written records indicate the [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptians]] and [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]] used all the elementary arithmetic operations as early as 2000 BC. These artifacts do not always reveal the specific process used for solving problems, but the characteristics of the particular [[numeral system]] strongly influence the complexity of the methods. The hieroglyphic system for [[Egyptian numerals]], like the later [[Roman numerals]], descended from [[tally marks]] used for counting. In both cases, this origin resulted in values that used a [[decimal]] base but did not include [[positional notation]]. Although addition was generally straightforward, multiplication in [[Roman arithmetic]] required the assistance of a [[counting board]] to obtain the results.

Early number systems that included positional notation were not decimal, including the [[sexagesimal]] (base 60) system for [[Babylonian numerals]] and the [[vigesimal]](base 20) system that defined [[Maya numerals]]. Because of this place-value concept, the ability to reuse the same digits for different values contributed to simpler and more efficient methods of calculation.

The continuous historical development of modern arithmetic starts with the [[Hellenistic civilization]] of ancient Greece, although it originated much later than the Babylonian and Egyptian examples. Prior to the works of [[Euclid]] around 300 BC, [[Greek mathematics|Greek studies in mathematics]] overlapped with philosophical and mystical beliefs. For example, [[Nicomachus]] summarized the viewpoint of the earlier [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] approach to numbers, and their relationships to each other, in his ''[[Introduction to Arithmetic]]''.

[[Greek numerals]], derived from the hieratic Egyptian system, also lacked positional notation, and therefore imposed the same complexity on the basic operations of arithmetic. For example, the ancient mathematician [[Archimedes]] devoted his entire work ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'' merely to devising a notation for a certain large integer.

The gradual development of [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]] independently devised the place-value concept and positional notation, which combined the simpler methods for computations with a decimal base and the use of a digit representing [[0 (number)|zero]]. This allowed the system to consistently represent both large and small integers. This approach eventually replaced all other systems. In the early 6th century AD, the Indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] incorporated an existing version of this system in his work, and experimented with different notations. In the 7th century, [[Brahmagupta]] established the use of zero as a separate number and determined the results for multiplication, division, addition and subtraction of zero and all other numbers, except for the result of [[division by zero]]. His contemporary, the [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] bishop Severus Sebokht described the excellence of this system as &quot;...valuable methods of calculation which surpass description&quot;.  The Arabs also learned this new method and called it ''hesab''.

Although the [[Codex Vigilanus]] described an early form of Arabic numerals (omitting zero) by 976 AD, [[Fibonacci]] was primarily responsible for spreading their use throughout Europe after the publication of his book ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' in 1202. He considered the significance of this &quot;new&quot; representation of numbers, which he styled the &quot;Method of the Indians&quot; (Latin ''Modus Indorum''), so fundamental that all related mathematical foundations, including the results of [[Pythagoras]] and the [[algorism]] describing the methods for performing actual calculations, were &quot;almost a mistake&quot; in comparison.

In the [[Middle Ages]], arithmetic was one of the seven [[liberal arts]] taught in universities.

The flourishing of [[algebra]] in the [[medieval]] [[Islamic]] world and in [[Renaissance]] [[Europe]] was an outgrowth of the enormous simplification of [[computation]] through [[decimal]] notation.

Various types of tools exist to assist in numeric calculations. Examples include [[slide rule]]s (for multiplication, division, and trigonometry) and [[nomogram|nomographs]] in addition to the electrical [[calculator]].

==Decimal arithmetic==

Although '''decimal notation''' may conceptually describe any numerals from a system with a decimal base, it is commonly used exclusively for the written forms of numbers with [[Arabic numerals]] as the basic digits, especially when the numeral includes a [[decimal separator]] preceding a sequence of these digits to represent a [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional part]] of the number. In this common usage, the written form of the number implies the existence of [[positional notation]]. For example, 507.36 denotes 5 hundreds (10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), plus 0 tens (10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), plus 7 units (10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;), plus 3 tenths (10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;) plus 6 hundredths (10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  The conception of zero as a number comparable to the other basic digits, and the corresponding definition of multiplication and addition with zero, is an essential part of this notation.

[[Algorism]] comprises all of the rules for performing arithmetic computations using this type of written numeral. For example, addition produces the sum of two arbitrary numbers. The result is calculated by the repeated addition of single digits from each number that occupies the same position, proceeding from right to left. An addition table with ten rows and ten columns displays all possible values for each sum. If an individual sum exceeds the value nine, the result is represented with two digits. The rightmost digit is the value for the current position, and the result for the subsequent addition of the digits to the left increases by the value of the second (leftmost) digit, which is always one. This adjustment is termed a ''carry'' of the value one.

The process for multiplying two arbitrary numbers is similar to the process for addition. A multiplication table with ten rows and ten columns lists the results for each pair of digits. If an individual product of a pair of digits exceeds nine, the ''carry'' adjustment increases the result of any subsequent multiplication from digits to the left by a value equal to the second (leftmost) digit, which is any value from one to eight (9&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;9&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;81). Additional steps define the final result.

Similar techniques exist for subtraction and division.

The creation of a correct process for multiplication relies on the relationship between values of adjacent digits. The value for any single digit in a numeral depends on its position. Also, each position to the left represents a value ten times larger than the position to the right. In mathematical terms, the [[exponentiation|exponent]] for the [[radix|base]] of ten increases by one (to the left) or decreases by one (to the right). Therefore, the value for any arbitrary digit is multiplied by a value of the form 10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with [[integer]]&amp;nbsp;''n''. The list of values corresponding to all possible positions for a single digit is written as&amp;nbsp;{...,&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;10,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...}.

Repeated multiplication of any value in this list by ten produces another value in the list. In mathematical terminology, this characteristic is defined as [[closure (mathematics)|closure]], and the previous list is described as '''closed under multiplication'''.
It is the basis for correctly finding the results of multiplication using the previous technique. This outcome is one example of the uses of [[number theory]].

==Arithmetic operations==
The basic arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, although this subject also includes more advanced operations, such as manipulations of [[percentage]]s, [[square root]]s, exponentiation, and [[logarithm|logarithmic functions]].  Arithmetic is performed according to an [[order of operations]]. Any set of objects upon which all four arithmetic operations (except division by zero) can be performed, and where these four operations obey the usual laws, is called a [[Field mathematics|field]].

===Addition (+)===
{{main|Addition}}
Addition is the basic operation of arithmetic. In its simplest form, addition combines two numbers, the ''addends'' or ''[[term (mathematics)|terms]]'', into a single number, the ''sum'' of the numbers.

Adding more than two numbers can be viewed as repeated addition; this procedure is known as [[summation]] and includes ways to add infinitely many numbers in an [[series (mathematics)|infinite series]]; repeated addition of the number [[1 (number)|one]] is the most basic form of [[counting]].

Addition is [[commutative]] and [[associative]] so the order the terms are added in does not matter.  The [[identity element]] of addition (the [[additive identity]]) is 0, that is, adding zero to any number yields that same number.  Also, the [[inverse element]] of addition (the [[additive inverse]]) is the opposite of any number, that is, adding the opposite of any number to the number itself yields the additive identity,&amp;nbsp;0.  For example, the opposite of 7 is −7, so {{Maths|7 + (−7) {{=}} 0}}.

Addition can be given geometrically as follows:

:If ''a'' and ''b'' are the lengths of two sticks, then if we place the sticks one after the other, the length of the stick thus formed is {{Maths|''a'' + ''b''}}.

===Subtraction (−)===
{{Main|Subtraction}}

Subtraction is the opposite of addition.  Subtraction finds the ''difference'' between two numbers, the ''minuend''  minus the ''subtrahend''.  If the minuend is larger than the subtrahend, the difference is positive; if the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend, the difference is negative; if they are equal, the difference is zero.

Subtraction is neither commutative nor associative.  For that reason, it is often helpful to look at subtraction as addition of the minuend and the opposite of the subtrahend, that is {{Maths|''a'' − ''b'' {{=}} ''a'' + (−''b'')}}. When written as a sum, all the properties of addition hold.

There are several methods for calculating results, some of which are particularly advantageous to machine calculation. For example, digital computers employ the method of [[two's complement]]. Of great importance is the counting up method by which change is made. Suppose an amount ''P'' is given to pay the required amount ''Q'', with ''P'' greater than ''Q''. Rather than performing the subtraction {{Maths|''P'' − ''Q''}} and counting out that amount in change, money is counted out starting at ''Q'' and continuing until reaching ''P''. Although the amount counted out must equal the result of the subtraction {{Maths|''P'' − ''Q''}}, the subtraction was never really done and the value of {{Maths|''P'' − ''Q''}} might still be unknown to the change-maker.

{{See also|Method of complements}}

===Multiplication (× or ·)===
{{main|Multiplication}}

Multiplication is the second basic operation of arithmetic. Multiplication also combines two numbers into a single number, the ''product''. The two original numbers are called the ''multiplier'' and the ''multiplicand'', sometimes both simply called ''factors''.

Multiplication is best viewed as a scaling operation. If the real numbers are imagined as lying in a line, multiplication by a number, say &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, greater than 1 is the same as stretching everything away from zero uniformly, in such a way that the number 1 itself is stretched to where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; was. Similarly, multiplying by a number less than 1 can be imagined as squeezing towards zero. (Again, in such a way that 1 goes to the multiplicand.)

Multiplication is commutative and associative; further it is [[Distributivity|distributive]] over addition and subtraction.  The [[multiplicative identity]] is 1, that is, multiplying any number by 1 yields that same number.  Also, the [[multiplicative inverse]] is the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of any number (except zero; zero is the only number without a multiplicative inverse), that is, multiplying the reciprocal of any number by the number itself yields the multiplicative identity.

The product of ''a'' and ''b'' is written as ''a''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''b'' or ''a''&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;''b''.  When ''a'' or ''b'' are expressions not written simply with digits, it is also written by simple juxtaposition:&amp;nbsp;''ab''.  In computer programming languages and software packages in which one can only use characters normally found on a keyboard, it is often written with an asterisk:&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;''b''.

===Division (÷ or /)===
{{main|Division (mathematics)}}
Division is essentially the opposite of multiplication.  Division finds the ''quotient'' of two numbers, the ''dividend'' divided by the ''divisor''.  Any dividend [[Division by zero|divided by zero]] is undefined. For positive numbers, if the dividend is larger than the divisor, the quotient is greater than one, otherwise it is less than one (a similar rule applies for negative numbers).  The quotient multiplied by the divisor always yields the dividend.

Division is neither commutative nor associative.  As it is helpful to look at subtraction as addition, it is helpful to look at division as multiplication of the dividend times the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the divisor, that is ''a''&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;.  When written as a product, it obeys all the properties of multiplication.

==Number theory==
{{main|Number theory}}
The term ''arithmetic'' also refers to number theory. This includes the properties of integers related to [[prime number|primality]], [[divisibility]], and the [[Diophantine equations|solution of equations in integers]], as well as modern research that is an outgrowth of this study. It is in this context that one runs across the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] and [[arithmetic function]]s. ''A Course in Arithmetic'' by [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] reflects this usage, as do such phrases as ''first order arithmetic'' or ''arithmetical algebraic geometry''. Number theory is also referred to as ''the higher arithmetic'', as in the title of [[Harold Davenport|Harold Davenport's]] book on the subject.

==Arithmetic in education==
[[Primary education]] in mathematics often places a strong focus on algorithms for the arithmetic of [[natural number]]s, [[integer]]s, [[rational number]]s ([[fraction]]s), and [[real number]]s (using the decimal place-value system).  This study is sometimes known as algorism.

The difficulty and unmotivated appearance of these algorithms has long led educators to question this curriculum, advocating the early teaching of more central and intuitive mathematical ideas.  One notable movement in this direction was the [[New Math]] of the 1960s and 1970s, which attempted to teach arithmetic in the spirit of axiomatic development from set theory, an echo of the prevailing trend in higher mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathematicallycorrect.com/glossary.htm Mathematically Correct: Glossary of Terms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andersonville''' is a city in [[Sumter County, Georgia|Sumter County]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], United States. The population was 331 at the 2000 census (174 in 1910). It is located in the southwest part of the state, about {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of [[Macon, Georgia]] on the [[Central of Georgia]] [[railroad]]. During the [[American Civil War]], it was the site of a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] which is now [[Andersonville National Historic Site]].

Andersonville is part of the [[Americus, Georgia|Americus]] [[Americus micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

==Geography==
Andersonville is located at {{Coord|32|11|49|N|84|8|30|W|type:city}} (32.197008, −84.141701){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 1.3&amp;nbsp;square miles (3.4&amp;nbsp;km²), all of it land.

== History ==
The little hamlet of Anderson was named for Mr. John Anderson who was a Director in the South Western Railroad at the time it was extended from Oglethorpe to Americus in 1853.  It was known as Anderson Station until the post office was established in November 1855 and the government changed the name of the station from “Anderson” to “Andersonville” in order to avoid confusion with the Post office in Anderson, South Carolina.
The Town of Andersonville, served as Supply Depot during the time of the prison,and it included a post office, a depot, a blacksmith shop and stable, a couple of general stores, two saloons, a school, a Methodist church and about a dozen houses. (Ben Dykes, who owned the land on which the prison was built, was both depot agent and postmaster.)
Until the establishment of the prison, the area was entirely dependent on agriculture, and, after the close of the prison, the town continued economically dependent on agriculture. The town changed very little over the years, until 1968 when the mining of kaolin, bauxitic kaolin, and bauxite was undertaken in a big way by Mu1coa, Mullite Company of America which turned {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} of scrub oak wilderness into a massive mining and refining operation and now ships more than 2000 tons of refined ore from Andersonville each week.
In 1974, long time Mayor, Lewis Easterlin and a group of concerned citizens decided to promote tourism in the town by turning the clock back on the town and make it look much as it did during the American Civil War. Now today Andersonville, Georgia welcomes tourists from all over the world who come for the history, museums, and to step back in time.

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 331 people, 124 households, and 86 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 254.1 people per square mile (98.3/km²). There were 142 housing units at an average density of 109.0 per square mile (42.2/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 65.26% white and 34.74% African American. 1.21% of the population were [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]].

The average household size was 2.67 and the average family size was 3.21.

In the city the population was spread out with 27.8% under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 31.4% from 25 to 44, 19.3% from 45 to 64, and 12.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females there were 105.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.5 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $29,107, and the median income for a family was $30,972. Males had a median income of $26,591 versus $20,000 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $15,168.

The '''Agra Canal''' is an important [[India]]n [[irrigation]] work which starts from [[Okhla]] in [[Delhi]]. The Agra canal originates from [[Okhla]] barrage, downstream of Nizamuddin bridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irrigation.up.nic.in/achievements.htm Agra Canal Modernization Project]&lt;/ref&gt; It opened in 1874.

In the beginning, it was available for navigation, in [[Delhi]], erstwhile [[Gurgaon]], [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] and [[Agra District|Agra]] Districts, and [[Bharatpur District|Bharatpur]] State. Later, navigation was stopped in 1904 and the canal has since then, been exclusively used for irrigation purposes only. At present the canal does not flow in district Gurgaon, but only in [[Faridabad]], which was earlier a part of Gurgaon.

The [[Canal]] receives its water from the [[Yamuna River]] at [[Okhla]], about 10 KM to the south of [[New Delhi]]. The weir across the [[Yamuna]] was the first attempted in [[Upper India]] upon a foundation of fine sand; it is about 800-yard long, and rises seven-feet above the summer level of the river.

From [[Okhla]] the canal follows the high land between the Khari-Nadi and the [[Yamuna]] and finally joins the Banganga river about {{nowrap|20 miles}} below Agra. Navigable branches connect the canal with [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] and [[Agra]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Agra Canal|Agra Canal]] {{1911}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Yatsushiro Sea.png|thumb|right|250px|The Yatsushiro Sea and surroundings]]
'''Amakusa''' (天草) is a series of islands belonging to [[Japan]], the biggest of which, Shimoshima Island, is 26½ miles long and 13½ in extreme width, situated about 32°20'N, 130°E, on the west of [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] (formerly the province of [[Higo province|Higo]] on the island of [[Kyūshū]]), from which it is separated by the [[Yatsushiro Sea]]. It is served by [[Amakusa Airfield]], and is connected to the mainland by the [[Five Bridges of Amakusa]].

It has no high [[mountain]]s, but its surface is very [[hill]]y—four of the peaks rise to a height over {{convert|1500|ft|m}}—the population resorts to the [[terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] system of [[cultivation]] with remarkable success.

A number of the heads of the [[Christianity|Christians]] [[capital punishment|executed]] in connection with the [[Shimabara rebellion]] in 1637-1638 were buried on this island.  Amakusa produces a little [[coal]] and fine [[kaolin]], which was largely used in former times by the [[pottery|potters]] of [[Hirado]] and [[Satsuma Province|Satsuma]]. Hidenoshin Koyama, who built [[Thomas Blake Glover]]'s House in [[Glover Garden]] came from this island.

Now '''[[Amakusa District, Kumamoto]]''' is a [[district (Japan)|district]] and '''[[Amakusa, Kumamoto]]''' is a [[cities of Japan|city]] in [[Kumamoto prefecture|Kumamoto]].

An '''afterglow''' is a broad high arch of whitish or rosy light appearing in the [[sky]] due to very fine particles of [[dust]] suspended in the high regions of the [[earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. An afterglow may appear above the highest [[cloud]]s in the hour of deepening [[twilight]], or [[reflection (optics)|reflected]] from the high [[snow]]fields in [[mountain]] regions long after [[sunset]]. The particles produce a [[scattering]] effect upon the component parts of [[white]] [[light]].  

After the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa|eruption]] of the [[volcano]] [[Krakatoa]] in 1883, a remarkable series of red [[sunset]]s appeared worldwide. These were due to an enormous amount of exceedingly fine dust blown to a great height by the volcano's explosion, and then globally diffused by the high atmospheric currents. [[Edvard Munch]]'s painting ''[[The Scream]]'' possibly depicts an afterglow during this period.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ammonius Grammaticus''' is the supposed author of a treatise titled ''Peri homoíōn kai diaphórōn léxeōn'' (περὶ ὁμοίων καὶ διαφόρων λέξεων, ''On the Differences of Synonymous Expressions''), of whom nothing is known.  

He was formerly identified with an [[Egypt]]ian priest who, after the destruction of the pagan temple at [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]] (389), fled to [[Constantinople]], where he became the tutor of the ecclesiastical historian [[Socrates Scholasticus|Socrates]].  But it seems more probable 
that the real author was [[Herennius Philo]] of Byblus, who was born during the reign of [[Nero]] and lived till the reign of [[Hadrian]], and that the treatise in its present form is a revision prepared by a later Byzantine editor, whose name may have been Ammonius.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2008}}

In [[mathematics]], particularly [[abstract algebra]], an '''algebraic closure''' of a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' is an [[algebraic extension]] of ''K'' that is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]].  It is one of many [[closure (mathematics)|closures]] in mathematics.

Using [[Zorn's lemma]], it can be shown that every field has an algebraic closure,&lt;ref&gt;M. F. Atiyah and I. G. Macdonald (1969). ''Introduction to commutative algebra''. Addison-Wesley publishing Company. pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the algebraic closure of a field ''K'' is unique [[up to]] an [[isomorphism]] that [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixes]] every member of ''K''. Because of this essential uniqueness, we often speak of ''the'' algebraic closure of ''K'', rather than ''an'' algebraic closure of ''K''.

The algebraic closure of a field ''K'' can be thought of as the largest algebraic extension of ''K''.
To see this, note that if ''L'' is any algebraic extension of ''K'', then the algebraic closure of ''L'' is also an algebraic closure of ''K'', and so ''L'' is contained within the algebraic closure of ''K''.
The algebraic closure of ''K'' is also the smallest algebraically closed field containing ''K'',
because if ''M'' is any algebraically closed field containing ''K'', then the elements of ''M'' which are [[algebraic extension|algebraic over]] ''K'' form an algebraic closure of ''K''.

The algebraic closure of a field ''K'' has the same [[cardinal number|cardinality]] as ''K'' if ''K'' is infinite, and is [[countably infinite]] if ''K'' is finite.

==Examples==
*The [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] states that the algebraic closure of the field of [[real number]]s is the field of [[complex number]]s.

*The algebraic closure of the field of [[rational number]]s is the field of [[algebraic number]]s.

*There are many countable algebraically closed fields within the complex numbers, and strictly containing the field of algebraic numbers; these are the algebraic closures of transcendental extensions of the rational numbers, e.g. the algebraic closure of '''Q'''(π).

*For a [[finite field]] of [[prime number|prime]] order ''p'', the algebraic closure is a [[countably infinite]] field which contains a copy of the field of order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for each positive [[integer]] ''n'' (and is in fact the union of these copies).

*See also [[Puiseux expansion]].

==Separable closure==
An algebraic closure ''K&lt;sup&gt;alg&lt;/sup&gt;'' of ''K'' contains a unique [[separable extension]] ''K&lt;sup&gt;sep&lt;/sup&gt;'' of ''K'' containing all (algebraic) [[separable extension]]s of ''K'' within ''K&lt;sup&gt;alg&lt;/sup&gt;''.  This subextension is called a '''separable closure''' of ''K''. Since a separable extension of a separable extension is again separable, there are no finite separable extensions of ''K&lt;sup&gt;sep&lt;/sup&gt;'', of degree &gt; 1. Saying this another way, ''K'' is contained in a ''separably-closed'' algebraic extension field. It is essentially unique ([[up to]] isomorphism).

For ''K'' a [[perfect field]], it is the full algebraic closure.  In general, the [[absolute Galois group]] of ''K'' is the Galois group of ''K&lt;sup&gt;sep&lt;/sup&gt;'' over ''K''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Advanced power management''' ('''APM''') is an [[Application programming interface|API]] developed by [[Intel]] and [[Microsoft]] and released in 1992&lt;ref name=&quot;APM_spec_V12&quot; /&gt; which enables an [[operating system]] running an IBM-compatible [[personal computer]] to work with the [[BIOS]] (part of the computer's [[firmware]]) to achieve [[power management]].

Revision 1.2 was the last version of the APM specification, released in 1996. [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] is intended as the successor to APM. Microsoft dropped support for APM in [[Windows Vista]]. The [[Linux|Linux Kernel]] still supports APM as of 2.6.39-rc2, but is considering dropping support for it in 2.6.40.

==Overview==
APM uses a layered approach to manage devices. APM-aware applications (which include device drivers) talk to an OS-specific APM driver. This driver communicates to the APM-aware BIOS, which controls the hardware. There is the ability to opt-out of APM control on a device-by-device basis, which can be used if a driver wants to communicate directly with a hardware device.
&lt;gallery&gt;Image:APM-Layers.gif|The layers in APM.&lt;/gallery&gt;

Communication occurs both ways; power management events are sent from the BIOS to the APM driver, and the APM driver sends information and requests to the BIOS via function calls. In this way the APM driver is an intermediary between the BIOS and the operating system.

Power management happens in two ways; through the above mentioned function calls from the APM driver to the BIOS requesting power state changes, and automatically based on device activity.

== Power management events ==
There are 12 power events (such as standby, suspend and resume requests, and low battery notifications), plus [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]-defined events, that can be sent from the APM BIOS to the operating system. The APM driver regularly [[Polling (computer science)|polls]] for event change notifications.

==APM functions==
There are 21 APM function calls defined that the APM driver can use to query power management statuses, or request power state transitions. Example function calls include letting the BIOS know about current CPU usage (the BIOS may respond to such a call by placing the CPU in a low-power state, or returning it to its full-power state), retrieving the current power state of a device, or requesting a power state change.

==Power states==
The APM specification defines system power states and device power states.

===System power states===
APM defines five power states for the computer system:
* Full On: The computer is powered on, and no devices are in a power saving mode.
* APM Enabled: The computer is powered on, and APM is controlling device power management as needed.
* APM Standby: Most devices are in their low-power state, the CPU is slowed or stopped, and the system state is saved. The computer can be returned to its former state quickly (in response to activity such as the user pressing a key on the keyboard).
* APM Suspend: Most devices are powered off, but the system state is saved. The computer can be returned to its former state, but takes a relatively long time. (Hibernation is a special form of the APM Suspend state).
* Off: The computer is turned off.

===Device power states===
APM also defines power states that APM-aware hardware can implement. There is no requirement that an APM-aware device implement all states.

The four states are:
* Device On: The device is in full power mode.
* Device Power Managed: The device is still powered on, but some functions may not be available, or may have reduced performance.
* Device Low Power: The device is not working. Power is maintained so that the device may be 'woken up'.
* Device Off: The device is powered off.

==CPU==
The CPU core (defined in APM as the CPU clock, [[cache]], [[Front side bus|system bus]] and system timers) is treated specially in APM, as it is the last device to be powered down, and the first device to be powered back up. The CPU core is always controlled through the APM BIOS (there is no option to control it through a driver). Drivers can use APM function calls to notify the BIOS about CPU usage, but it is up to the BIOS to act on this information; a driver cannot directly tell the CPU to go into a power saving state.

&lt;!--[[File:200 belgische franc.jpg|right|thumb|Adolphe Sax on the old 200 Belgian Franc notes]]--&gt;
'''Antoine-Joseph &quot;Adolphe&quot; Sax''' (6 November 1814 – c. 4 February 1894&lt;ref&gt;Many sources give alternative dates for Sax's death, mainly 3 February and 7 February.  A sign at Sax's grave in Montmartre says 7 February, for example.  However, 4 February appears in ''[[Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians]]'' (8th ed., [[Nicolas Slonimsky]]); and in both the first and second editions of the [[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]].&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[musical instrument]] designer and [[musician]] who played the [[flute]] and [[clarinet]], and is best known for having invented the [[saxophone]].

==Biography==
Adolphe Sax was born in [[Dinant]] in [[Wallonia]], Belgium. His father, [[Charles-Joseph Sax]], was an instrument designer himself, who made several changes to the design of the [[horn (instrument)|horn]]. Adolphe began to make his own instruments at an early age, entering two of his [[flute]]s and a [[clarinet]] into a competition at the age of fifteen. He subsequently studied those two instruments at the Royal School of Singing in [[Brussels]].

Having left the school, Sax began to experiment with new instrument designs, while his father continued to produce conventional instruments to bring money into the household. Adolphe's first important invention was an improvement of the [[bass clarinet]] design which he patented at the age of twenty-four.

In 1841, Sax relocated permanently to [[Paris]] and began work on a new set of instruments which were exhibited there in 1844. These were valved [[Bugle (instrument)|bugles]], and although he had not invented the instrument itself, his examples were so much more successful than those of his rivals that they became known as [[saxhorn]]s. They range in approximately seven different sizes, and paved the path to the creation of the [[flugelhorn]]. Today, they are widely used in [[concert band]]s and sometimes in [[orchestra]]s.  The saxhorn also laid the groundwork for the modern [[euphonium]].

Sax also developed the ''[[saxotromba]]'' family, valved brass instruments with narrower bore than the saxhorns, in 1845, though they survived only briefly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Saxhorn instruments spread rapidly throughout the world. The saxhorn valves were accepted as state of the art and are still largely unchanged today. The advances made by Adolphe Sax were soon followed by the [[Brass band (British style)|British brass band]] movement which exclusively adopted the saxhorn range.  The Jedforest Instrumental Band formed in 1854 within the [[Scottish Borders]] a decade after saxhorn models became available.

The period around 1840 saw Sax inventing the ''clarinette-bourdon'', an early (and unsuccessful) design of [[contrabass clarinet]].  Most significantly, at this time he developed the instrument for which he is now best known, the [[saxophone]], patented in 1846. The saxophone was invented for use in both orchestras and concert bands.  [[Composer]] [[Hector Berlioz]] wrote approvingly of the new instrument in 1842. By 1846 Sax had designed, on paper, a full range of saxophones (from [[Sopranino saxophone|sopranino]] to [[Subcontrabass saxophone|subcontrabass]]). Although they never became standard orchestral instruments, the saxophones made his reputation, and secured him a job teaching at the [[Paris Conservatoire]] from 1867.

Sax continued to make instruments later in life, as well as presiding over a new saxophone class at the Paris Conservatoire. However, rival instrument makers attacked the legitimacy of his patents and mounted a long campaign of litigation against Sax and his company, driving him into bankruptcy twice (in 1856 and 1873).

Sax suffered from lip cancer between 1853 and 1858 but made a full recovery. He died in 1894 in Paris and was interred in section 5 (Avenue de Montebello) at the [[Cimetière de Montmartre]] in [[Paris]].

In [[phonetics]], '''aspiration''' is the strong burst of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]] that accompanies either the release or, in the case of [[preaspiration]], the closure of some [[obstruent]]s. To feel or see the difference between aspirated and unaspirated sounds, one can put a hand or a lit candle in front of one's mouth, and say ''pin'' ({{IPA|[pʰɪn]}}) and then ''bin'' ({{IPA|[bɪn]}}). One should either feel a puff of air or see a flicker of the candle flame with ''pin'' that one does not get with ''bin''. In most dialects of English, the  initial consonant is aspirated in ''pin'' and unaspirated in ''bin''.

The [[diacritic]] for aspiration in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) is a superscript &quot;h&quot;, {{IPA|[ʰ]}} . [[Tenuis consonant|Unaspirated consonants]] are not normally marked explicitly, but there is a diacritic for '''non-aspiration''' in the [[Extensions to the IPA]], the superscript [[equal sign]], {{IPA|[⁼]}}.

== Description ==

[[Voiceless]] consonants are produced with the [[vocal cords]] open and voiced consonants are produced when the vocal folds are fractionally closed. Voiceless aspiration occurs when the vocal cords remain open after a consonant is released. An easy way to measure this is by noting the consonant's [[voice onset time]], as the voicing of a following vowel cannot begin until the vocal cords close.

== Usage patterns ==

[[English language|English]] [[voiceless]] [[stop consonant]]s are aspirated for most native speakers when they are word-initial or begin a [[stressed syllable]], as in ''pen'', ''ten'', ''Ken''. They are unaspirated for almost all speakers when immediately following word-initial s, as in ''spun'', ''stun'', ''skunk''. After s elsewhere in a word they are normally unaspirated as well, except when the cluster is heteromorphemic and the stop belongs to an unbound morpheme; compare {{IPA|dis[t]end}} vs. {{IPA|dis[tʰ]aste}}. Word-final voiceless stops optionally aspirate.

Aspirated consonants are not always followed by vowels or other voiced sounds; indeed, in [[Eastern Armenian language|Eastern Armenian]], aspiration is contrastive even at the ends of words. For example compare: {{IPA|bard͡z}} ''pillow'', with {{IPA|bart͡s⁼}} ''difficult'' and {{IPA|bart͡sʰ}} ''high''.

In many languages, such as the [[Chinese language]]s, [[Indo-Aryan languages]] (from [[Sanskrit]]), [[Dravidian languages]] (i.e. under the influence of [[Sanskrit]].), [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Thai language|Thai]], and [[Ancient Greek]], {{IPA|[p⁼ t⁼ k⁼]}} ''etc.'' and {{IPA|[pʰ tʰ kʰ]}} ''etc.'' are different [[phoneme]]s altogether.

[[Alemannic German|Alemannic German dialects]] have unaspirated {{IPA|[p⁼ t⁼ k⁼]}} as well as aspirated {{IPA|[pʰ tʰ kʰ]}}; the latter series are usually viewed as [[consonant cluster]]s. In [[Danish language|Danish]] and most southern varieties of [[German language|German]], the &quot;[[Fortis and lenis|lenis]]&quot; consonants transcribed for historical reasons as {{IPA|‹b d ɡ›}} are distinguished from their &quot;[[Fortis and lenis|fortis]]&quot; counterparts {{IPA|‹p t k›}} mainly in their lack of aspiration.

[[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] have '''[[Preaspiration|pre-aspirated]]''' {{IPA|[ʰp ʰt ʰk]}}; some scholars interpret these as consonant clusters as well. Preaspirated stops also occur in some [[Sami languages]]; e.g. in [[Skolt Sami]] the unvoiced stop phonemes {{IPA|p}}, {{IPA|t}}, {{IPA|c}}, {{IPA|k}} are pronounced preaspirated ({{IPA|ʰp}}, {{IPA|ʰt}} {{IPA|ʰc}} {{IPA|ʰk}}) when they occur in medial or final position.

A commonly stated [[linguistic universal]] is that languages contrasting aspiration will also feature either the [[voiceless glottal fricative|voiceless]] or [[voiced glottal fricative]] {{IPA|/h/}}, {{IPA|/ɦ/}}.

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] are examples of languages that do not have aspirated consonants.

There are degrees of aspiration. Armenian and Cantonese have aspiration that lasts about as long as English aspirated stops, as well as unaspirated stops like Spanish. Korean has lightly aspirated stops that fall between the Armenian and Cantonese unaspirated and aspirated stops, as well as strongly aspirated stops whose aspiration lasts longer than that of Armenian or Cantonese. (See [[voice onset time]].) An old IPA symbol for light aspiration was {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;ʻ&amp;nbsp;]}} (that is, like a rotated ejective symbol), but this is no longer commonly used. There is no specific symbol for strong aspiration, but {{IPA|[ʰ]}} can be iconically doubled for, say, Korean {{IPA|*[kʻ&amp;nbsp;]}} vs. {{IPA|*[kʰʰ]}}. Note however that Korean is nearly universally transcribed as {{IPA|[k]}} vs. {{IPA|[kʰ]}}, with the details of voice onset time given numerically. 

Aspiration also varies with [[place of articulation]]. Spanish /p t k/, for example, have voice onset times (VOTs) of about 5, 10, and 30 milliseconds, whereas English /p t k/ have VOTs of about 60, 70, and 80 ms. Korean has been measured at 20, 25, and 50 ms for {{IPA|/p t k/}} and 90, 95, and 125 for {{IPA|/pʰ tʰ kʰ/}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.

== Usage of {{IPA|[ʰ]}} ==

The word 'aspiration' and the aspiration symbol is sometimes used with voiced stops, such as {{IPA|[dʰ]}}. However, such &quot;voiced aspiration&quot;, also known as [[breathy voice|''breathy voice'' or ''murmur'']], is less ambiguously transcribed with dedicated diacritics, either {{IPA|[d̤]}} or {{IPA|[dʱ]}}. (Some linguists restrict the subscript diacritic {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;̤]}} to [[sonorant]]s, such as [[vowel]]s and [[nasal consonant]]s, which are murmured throughout their duration, and use the superscript {{IPA|[ʱ]}} for the murmured release of obstruents.) When murmur is included under the term aspiration, as is common in Indo-Aryan linguistics, &quot;voiceless aspiration&quot; is called just that to avoid ambiguity.

'''Arteriovenous malformation''' or '''AVM''' is an abnormal connection between [[veins]] and [[arteries]], usually [[congenital disorder|congenital]]. This pathology is widely known because of its occurrence in the central nervous system, but can appear in any location.

The genetic transmission patterns of AVM, if any, are unknown. AVM is not generally thought to be an inherited disorder, unless in the context of a specific hereditary [[syndrome]].

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of AVM vary according to the location of the malformation. Roughly 88% &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/avms/detail_avms.htm#102083052 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]&lt;/ref&gt; of people affected with AVM are asymptomatic; often the malformation is discovered as part of an [[autopsy]] or during treatment of an unrelated disorder (called in medicine &quot;an incidental finding&quot;); in rare cases its expansion or a micro-bleed from an AVM in the brain can cause epilepsy, deficit or pain.

The most general symptoms of a cerebral AVM include [[headache]] and [[epilepsy]], with more specific symptoms occurring that normally depend on the location of the malformation and the individual. Such possible symptoms include:&lt;ref name=NINDS&gt;{{NINDS|avms|Arteriovenous Malformation Information Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Difficulties with movement or coordination, including [[muscle weakness]] and even [[paralysis]];
* [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] (dizziness);
* Difficulties of speech ([[dysarthria]]) and communication, such as [[aphasia]];
* Difficulties with everyday activities, such as [[apraxia]];
* Abnormal sensations (numbness, tingling, or spontaneous [[pain]]);
* Memory and thought-related problems, such as [[confusion]], [[dementia]] or [[hallucination]]s.

==Pathophysiology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
Arteriovenous malformations, also known as AVMs, are deficiencies of the cardiovascular system. In a normal functioning human body, arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the rest of the body, and veins return oxygen-depleted blood to the lungs and heart. An AVM interferes with this cyclical process. Instead of the gradual transition through the capillaries from arteries to veins that is typical of normal functioning vasculature, AVMs cause direct associations of the arteries and veins. AVMs can cause intense pain and lead to serious medical problems. Although AVMs are often associated with the brain and spinal cord, they can develop in any part of the body. 

Arteries and veins are part of the [[Circulatory system|human cardiovascular system]]. Normally, the arteries in the vascular system carry oxygen-rich blood, except in the case of the pulmonary artery. Structurally, arteries divide and sub-divide repeatedly, eventually forming a sponge-like [[capillary bed]]. Blood moves through the [[Capillary|capillaries]], giving up oxygen and taking up waste products, including [[Carbon dioxide|{{co2}}]], from the surrounding cells. Capillaries in turn successively join together to form veins that carry blood away. The heart acts to pump blood through arteries and uptake the venous blood.

An AVM lacks the dampening effect of capillaries on the blood flow; it also causes the surrounding area to be deprived of the functions of the capillaries - removal of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and delivery of nutrients to the cells. The resulting tangle of blood vessels, often called a ''nidus'' (Latin for &quot;nest&quot;) has no capillaries and abnormally direct connections between high-pressure arteries and low-pressure veins. It can be extremely fragile and prone to bleeding. The resultant sign, audible via stethoscope, is a rhythmic, whooshing sound caused by excessively rapid blood flow through the arteries and veins. It has been given the term &quot;bruit&quot;, French for noise. On some occasions a patient with a brain AVM may become aware of the noise, which can compromise hearing and interfere with sleep in addition to causing psychological distress.

==Diagnosis==
AVMs can occur in various parts of the body

AVMs may occur in isolation or as a part of another disease (for example, [[Von Hippel-Lindau disease]] or [[hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia]]).

AVMs have been shown to be associated with [[Aortic Stenosis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12912718&lt;/ref&gt;

Bleeding from an AVM can be devastating, particularly in the brain. It can cause severe and often fatal [[stroke]]s. If a cerebral AVM is detected before a stroke occurs, usually the arteries feeding blood into the nidus can be closed off to avert the danger. &lt;!-- The cerebral arteriovenous malformation article states that benefits of such intervention have not been proven to outweigh risk; ongoing study mentioned below. --&gt;
&lt;!-- == Screening == --&gt;

== Treatment ==
Treatment can be symptomatic, or it can involve surgery or radiation therapy.&lt;ref name=NINDS/&gt;
Embolization, that is, cutting off the blood supply to the AVM with coils or particles or [[glue]] introduced by a radiographically guided catheter, can be used in addition to either, but is rarely successful in isolation except for in smaller AVMs.
&lt;!-- == Prognosis == --&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
An estimated 300,000 [[United States|Americans]] have AVMs, of whom 12% (approximately 36,000) will exhibit symptoms of greatly varying severity.&lt;ref name=NINDS/&gt;
&lt;!-- == History == --&gt;

== Society and culture ==
*On December 13, 2006, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Tim Johnson (Politician)|Tim Johnson]] was diagnosed with AVM and treated at [[George Washington University]] Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16199440/ &quot;Sen. Johnson recovering after brain surgery&quot;], AP, December 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cases in fiction===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
*The plot of [[William Finn|William Finn's]] 1998 Off-Broadway musical ''[[A New Brain]]'' revolves around the main character's battle with AVM.
*The character [[Nate Fisher]] on the HBO television show ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' suffers from AVM.
*A patient with AVM appeared in an episode of the series [[House (TV series)|''House'']] entitled &quot;[[DNR (House episode)|DNR]]&quot; as well as in a fictional British medical show called [[Harley Street (TV series)|''Harley Street'']].
*The protagonist of [[Robert J. Sawyer]]'s novel ''[[Mindscan]]'' suffers from an AVM that threatens to reduce him to a permanent vegetative state.
*In an episode of TNT's ''[[HawthoRNe]]'' entitled &quot;The Sense of Belonging&quot; patient Amy Johnson suffers from this disorder, as well as an unspecified congenital heart defect.
*In an episode of ''[[Royal Pains]]'' entitled &quot;In Vino Veritas&quot; a winemaker had a past case of AVM. It was originally hypothesized to be the cause of her continual headaches.
*In the eighth episode of the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' entitled &quot;[[Save Me (Grey's Anatomy)|Save Me]]&quot;, a male patient Cable is diagnosed with AVM and purports to have [[psychic]] powers.

== Research directions ==
Despite many years of research, the central question of whether to treat AVMs has not been answered. All treatments, whether involving surgery, radiation, or drugs, have risks and side-effects. Therefore it might be better in some cases to avoid treatment altogether and simply accept a small risk of coming to harm from the AVM itself. This question is currently being addressed in clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cliniclog.com/arterio-venous_malformations.php Research trials in arterio-venous malformations; Rustam Al-Shahi Salman]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atlanta''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ə|t|ˈ|l|æ|n|t|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|æ|t|ˈ|l|æ|n|t|ə}}, locally {{IPAc-en|æ|t|ˈ|l|æ|n|ə}}) is the [[capital (political)|capital]]  and most populous city in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. According to the 2010 census, Atlanta's population is 420,003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn97.html US Census Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], with 5,268,860 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proximityone.com/metros0010.htm|title=Metropolitan Area Population &amp; Housing Patterns: 2000-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the third largest in the [[Southern United States]] and the [[table of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas|ninth largest in the country]]. The [[table of United States Combined Statistical Areas|Atlanta Combined Statistical Area]], a larger [[trade]] area, has a population approaching six million and is the largest in the Southeast.

==History of Atlanta==
{{Main|History of Atlanta|Atlanta in the Civil War}}

Prior to the arrival of European Americans in north Georgia, [[Creek (people)|Creek]] and [[Cherokee Indian]]s inhabited the area.&lt;ref&gt;http://chieftainstrail.com/&lt;/ref&gt; A Creek village located where [[Peachtree Creek]] flows into the Chattahoochee River, [[Standing Peachtree]] or Standing Pitch Tree, was the closest Indian settlement to what is now Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atlanta.net/visitors/folklore.html&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of the systematic removal of Native Americans from northern Georgia from 1802 to 1825,&lt;ref&gt;http://ngeorgia.com/history/indianla.html&lt;/ref&gt; the Creek ceded the area that is now Metro Atlanta in 1821.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?path=/CitiesCounties/Counties&amp;id=h-2335 New Georgia Encyclopedia, &quot;Fulton County&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; White settlers arrived in 1822, and nearby [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur]] was founded the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1403 New Georgia Encyclopedia, &quot;DeKalb County&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1836, the [[Georgia General Assembly]] voted to build the [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]] in order to provide a link between the port of [[Savannah]] and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].&lt;ref name=W&amp;ARR&gt;{{cite web | title = Creation of the Western and Atlantic Railroad | work = About North Georgia | publisher = Golden Ink | url = http://ngeorgia.com/railroads/warr01.html | accessdate = 2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial route was to run from Chattanooga to a spot called simply &quot;Terminus,&quot; located east of the Chattahoochee River, which would eventually be linked to the [[Georgia Railroad]] from Augusta and the [[Macon and Western Railroad]], which ran from Macon to Savannah. An engineer was chosen to recommend the location of the terminus. Once he surveyed various possible routes, he drove a stake (the “[[zero milepost]]”) into the ground in what is now [[Five Points (Atlanta)|Five Points]]. A year later, the area around the railroad terminus had developed into a settlement, first known as &quot;Terminus&quot; and then Thrasherville, for [[John Thrasher]], a local merchant who built homes and a [[general store]] in the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/gahistmarkers/thrashervillehistmarker.htm Thrasherville State Historical Marker], retrieved on 2009-11-13.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1842, the settlement had six buildings and 30 residents and the town was renamed &quot;Marthasville&quot;.&lt;ref name=shorthistory&gt;{{cite web | title = A Short History of Atlanta: 1782–1859 | publisher = CITY-DIRECTORY, Inc. | date = 2007-09-22 | url = http://www.city-book.com/Overview/history/history1.htm | accessdate = 2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chief Engineer of the Georgia Railroad, [[J.

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the nexus of multiple railroads in Atlanta made the city a hub for the distribution of military supplies. In 1864, following the capture of Chattanooga, the [[Union Army]] moved southward and began its [[Atlanta campaign|invasion of north Georgia]]. The region now covered by Metropolitan Atlanta was the location of several major army [[battle]]s, including [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain|Kennesaw Mountain]], [[Battle of Peachtree Creek|Peachtree Creek]], [[Battle of Jonesborough|Jonesborough]] (now [[Jonesboro, GA|Jonesboro]]), and the [[Battle of Atlanta]]. On September 1, 1864, following a four-month-long siege of the city by the [[Union Army]] under the command of General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[John Bell Hood]] made the decision to retreat from Atlanta. General Hood ordered that all public buildings and possible assets to the Union Army be destroyed. On the next day, Mayor [[James Calhoun]] surrendered Atlanta to the Union Army, and on September 7, General Sherman ordered the city's civilian population to evacuate. On November 11, 1864, in preparation of the Union Army's [[Sherman's March to the Sea|march to Savannah]], Sherman ordered for Atlanta to be burned to the ground, sparing only the city's churches and hospitals.&lt;ref name=shorthistory2&gt;{{cite web | title = A Short History of Atlanta: 1860–1864 | publisher = CITY-DIRECTORY, Inc. | date=  2007-09-22 | url = http://www.city-book.com/Overview/history/history2.htm | accessdate = 2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] ended in 1865, Atlanta was gradually rebuilt. From 1867 until 1888, [[U.S. Army]] soldiers occupied the [[Fort McPherson|McPherson Barracks]] in southern Atlanta to ensure that the [[reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]] reforms were carried out. 
[[File:Battle of Atlanta.png|thumb|left|[[Battle of Atlanta]] during US Civil War, 1864]]
In 1868, the [[Georgia state capital|Georgia State Capital]] was moved from [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]] to Atlanta due to the city's superior [[rail transportation]] network, making Atlanta the fifth location of the capital of the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|State of Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Jackson | first = Edwin L. | title = The Story of Georgia's Capitols and Capital Cities | publisher = Carl Vinson Institute of Government, University of Georgia | url = http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/capital.htm#anchor671763 | accessdate = 2007-11-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071009145856/http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/capital.htm#anchor671763 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederate [[Old soldiers' home|Soldiers' Home]] was built to house disabled and elderly Georgia veterans from 1901 to 1941.&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Rosenburg, ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27683131 Living Monuments: Confederate Soldier's Homes in the New South]'' (Chapel Hill, N.C.: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1993), 215 and 218, says that the Georgia Dept. of Archives and History, Atlanta, has applications for admission, Board of Trustees letters received, minutes, and reports, hospital record book, invoices, list of persons subscribing contributions, payrolls, record of miscellaneous functions, record of admissions, discharges and deaths, record of donations, register of inmates, George N. Saussey Diary, and visitors register, and the Atlanta Historical Society, Atlanta, has a Confederate veterans file.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry W. Grady]], the editor of the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'' [[newspaper]], promoted Atlanta to potential investors as a city of the &quot;New South&quot;, one to be built on a modern economy, less reliant on [[agriculture]]. As a focal point of this change, the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (its future name) was established in Atlanta in 1885 (with its first classes held in October 1888).

Increased racial tensions, the result of a media-fueled hysteria over alleged sexual assaults on white women by black men, led to the [[Atlanta Race Riot]] of 1906, which left at least 27 people dead&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1906atlantaraceriot.org/|title=Atlanta Race Riot | publisher= The Coalition to Remember the 1906 Atlanta Race Riot |accessdate=2006-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 70 injured.
[[File:Peachtree1907.jpg|thumb|right|upright|In 1907, Peachtree Street, the main street of Atlanta, was busy with streetcars and automobiles.]]
On May 21, 1917, the [[Great Atlanta Fire of 1917|Great Atlanta Fire]] destroyed 1,938 buildings, mostly wooden, in what is now the [[Old Fourth Ward]]. The fire resulted in 10,000 people becoming homeless. Only one person died, a woman who died of a heart attack at seeing her home in ashes.

On December 15, 1939, Atlanta hosted the [[film premiere]] of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', the epic film based on the best-selling novel by Atlanta's [[Margaret Mitchell]]. Several stars of the film, including  [[Clark Gable]], [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Olivia de Havilland]],  and its legendary [[film producer|producer]], [[David O. Selznick]], attended the gala event, which was held at Loew's Grand Theatre, now demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngeorgia.com/ang/Atlanta_Premiere_of_Gone_With_The_Wind |title=Atlanta Premiere of Gone With The Wind |publisher=Ngeorgia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reception was held at the [[Georgian Terrace Hotel]], which still exists.

During [[World War II]], manufacturing industries such as the [[Bell Aircraft Company]]'s large factory in the northwestern suburb of Marietta, a massive growth in railroad traffic—and the manufacture of [[railroad car]]s—for the war effort, and great growth at [[Ft. McClellan]], [[Fort Gillem]] (est. 1941), and [[Dobbins Air Force Base|Rickenbacker Field]] forced a large growth in the population and economy of Atlanta. Shortly after the war, the federal [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] was founded in Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Commemorating CDC's 60th Anniversary | work = CDC Website | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) | url = http://www.cdc.gov/about/history/60th.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the city's newly-constructed freeway system enabled middle class Atlantans to relocate to from the city to the suburbs. As a result, the city began to make up an ever smaller proportion of the metropolitan area's population, decreasing from 31% in 1960 to 9% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.demographia.com/db-atl1960.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  

During the 1960s, Atlanta was a major organizing center of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]], with Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Ralph David Abernathy]], and students from Atlanta's historically Black colleges and [[university|universities]] playing major roles in the movement's leadership. In 1961, Atlanta Mayor [[Ivan Allen Jr.]] became one of the few Southern white mayors to support desegregation of his city's public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Hornsby| first = Alton| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Black Public Education in Atlanta, Georgia, 1954–1973: From Segregation to Segregation| journal = The Journal of Negro History| volume = 76| issue = 1| pages = 21–47| publisher = Association for the Study of African-American Life and History, Inc.| date = Winter–Autumn, 1991| id = ISSN 00222992}}&lt;/ref&gt; While minimal compared to other cities, Atlanta was not completely free of racial strife. After forced-housing patterns were outlawed, violence, intimidation and organized political pressure was used in some white neighborhoods to discourage blacks from buying homes there. However, such efforts proved futile as real estate agents began engaging in [[blockbusting]], encouraging white homeowners to sell at rock-bottom prices so that the agents could re-sell the homes to blacks at a large profit. The resulting [[white flight]] mostly affected Atlanta's western and southern neighborhoods, many of them transitioning to majority black by the 1970s.&lt;ref name=kruse&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=c5763Zgu4_oC&amp;lpg=PP1 White flight: Atlanta and the making of modern conservatism By Kevin Michael Kruse]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, the city attempted to thwart blockbusting by erecting road barriers in [[Cascade Heights]], countering the efforts of civic and business leaders to foster Atlanta as the &quot;city too busy to hate.&quot;&lt;ref name=kruse/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874660,00.html &quot;The South: Divided City&quot;, Time magazine, 1961-01-18]&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans became a majority in the city by 1970, and exercised new-found political influence by electing Atlanta's first black mayor, [[Maynard Jackson]], in 1973. However, suburbanization, rising prices, a booming economy, and new migrants have decreased the black percentage of the city from a high of 69% in 1980 to 54% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000 to 2010, Atlanta gained 22,763 white residents, while it lost 28,795 black residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-031106&quot;&gt;{{cite news | publisher=The New York Times | first=Shaila | last=Dewan | date=March 11, 2006 | title=Gentrification Changing Face of New Atlanta | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/11/national/11atlanta.html?ei=5090&amp;en=bf1cb813a14f4341&amp;ex=1299733200&amp;adxnnl=0&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1142054955-6bzVsYXnlCDNwbMJEoswIg&amp;pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Atlanta was selected as the site for the [[1996 Summer Olympic Games]]. Following the [[Bids for the 1996 Summer Olympics|announcement]], Atlanta undertook several major construction projects to improve the city's parks, sports facilities, and transportation. Atlanta became the third American city to host the [[Summer Olympics]]. The games themselves were marred by numerous organizational inefficiencies, as well as the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

During the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], Atlanta completed its transformation into a cosmopolitan city, becoming well known for its robust cultural offerings. Much of the city's change in the last decade was been driven by young, college-educated professionals who have moved into Atlanta by the thousands, seeking a lifestyle rich in cultural variety, diversity, and excitement. From 2000 to 2009, the [[Intown Atlanta|tree-mile radius]] surrounding [[Downtown Atlanta]] gained 9,722 residents aged 25 to 34 holding at least a four-year degree, an increase of 61% and the sixth-largest such increase in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-04-01-1Ayoungrestless01_ST_N.htm?sms_ss=twitter&amp;at_xt=4d959a9cc8ce3e5c,0 | work=USA Today | title=Urban centers draw more young, educated adults | date=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Atlanta is on the leading edge of a national trend: while the same growth has occurred in dozens of other American cities, the change was twice as strong in Atlanta as it was nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/young-professionals-lead-surge-907440.html&lt;/ref&gt; As the city's new residents transformed communities long in decline into neighborhoods of choice, Atlanta's cultural offerings expanded to meet their increased demand. A total of 45 restaurants have opened Downtown since 2008. The [[High Museum of Art]] doubled in size and launched partnerships with major institutions such as [[Musée du Louvre|the Louvre]] and [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Museum of Modern Art]]. In 2007, the [[Alliance Theatre]] won a [[Tony Award]], placing it among the nation's [[Regional Theatre Tony Award|leading performing arts venues]]. The once-industrial [[West Midtown|Westside]] is now home to warehouse lofts, start-up companies, and buzzed-about restaurants.&lt;ref name=&quot;online.wsj.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704415104576250962970106874.html?mod=WSJ_hp_MIDDLETopMiniLeadStory | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Timothy W. | last=Martin | title=The New New South | date=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topography===
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|132.4|sqmi|1}}. {{convert|131.7|sqmi|1}} of it is land and {{convert|0.7|sqmi|1}} of it is water. The total area is 0.54% water. At about {{convert|1050|ft|m|0}} above mean sea level the airport is at {{convert|1010|ft|m|0}}, Atlanta sits atop a [[ridge]] south of the [[Chattahoochee River]].

The [[Eastern Continental Divide]] line enters Atlanta from the south, proceeding to the downtown area. From downtown, the divide line runs eastward along DeKalb Avenue and the [[CSX]] rail lines through Decatur.&lt;ref name=divide&gt;{{cite web | last = Yeazel | first = Jack | title = Eastern Continental Divide in Georgia | date= 2007-03-23 | url = http://www.gpsinformation.org/jack/Divide/Divide.html | accessdate = 2007-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainwater that falls on the south and east side runs eventually into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], while rainwater on the north and west side of the divide runs into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]&lt;ref name=divide/&gt; via the [[Chattahoochee River]]. That river is part of the [[ACF River Basin]], and from which Atlanta and many of its neighbors draw most of their water. Being at the far northwestern edge of the city, much of the river's natural habitat is still preserved, in part by the [[Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area]]. Downstream however, excessive water use during droughts and pollution during floods has been a source of contention and legal battles with neighboring states [[Alabama]] and [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Florida, Alabama, Georgia water sharing | publisher = WaterWebster | date = | url = http://www.waterwebster.com/FloridaAlabamaGeorgia.htm | format = news archive | accessdate = 2007-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fact Sheet&amp;nbsp;– Interstate Water Conflicts: Georgia&amp;nbsp;— Alabama&amp;nbsp;— Florida | publisher = Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce | date = | url = http://www.metroatlantachamber.com/macoc/initiatives/img/tri-statefactsheet.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-07-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061031192854/http://www.metroatlantachamber.com/macoc/initiatives/img/tri-statefactsheet.pdf |archivedate = October 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:AtlantaSnow.jpg|thumb|Atlanta's [[Piedmont Park]], with a blanket of winter snow.]] Atlanta has a [[humid subtropical climate]], &lt;!--Please see discussion about Koppen system--&gt;(Cfa) according to the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification]], with hot, humid summers and mild winters that are occasionally cold by the standards of the southern United States. January averages {{convert|42.7|°F|1}}, with temperatures in the suburbs slightly cooler. Warm, maritime air can bring springlike highs while strong Arctic air masses can push lows into the teens (&amp;minus;11 to &amp;minus;7 °C). High temperatures in July average {{convert|89|°F|1}} but occasionally exceed {{convert|100|°F}}. Atlanta's high mean elevation distinguishes it from most other southern and eastern cities, and contributes to a more temperate climate than is found in areas farther south.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2207&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!-- speculation? ---&gt;
&lt;!-- Atlanta has a more temperate climate than other southern cities of the same latitude due to its relatively high elevation of {{convert|1050|ft|m}} above sea level. ---&gt;

Typical of the southeastern U.S., Atlanta receives abundant rainfall, which is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year, though spring and early fall are markedly drier. Average annual rainfall is {{convert|50.2|in|sigfig=3}}. Temperatures at or above {{convert|90|F|0}} occur more than 40 days per year; overnight freezing can be expected over 45 days, but high temperatures that do not climb above the freezing mark are rare.&lt;ref name = NCDC /&gt; Snow is not seen every year and averages {{convert|2.5|in|cm|1}} annually.

On March 14, 2008, an [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF2]] [[tornado]] hit downtown Atlanta with winds up to {{convert|135|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The tornado caused damage to [[Philips Arena]], the [[Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel]], the [[Georgia Dome]], [[Centennial Olympic Park]], the [[CNN Center]], and the [[Georgia World Congress Center]]. It also damaged the nearby neighborhoods of Vine City to the west and [[Cabbagetown (Atlanta)|Cabbagetown]], and [[Fulton Bag and Cotton Mills]] to the east.

===Tree canopy===
[[File:ATL HQ.JPG|thumb|[[Atlanta Plaza]] skyscraper surrounded by trees, a common sight in the city]]
Atlanta has a reputation as a &quot;city in a forest&quot; or a &quot;city of trees&quot; due to its abundance of trees, unique among major cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;publicbroadcasting.net&quot;&gt;http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wabe/news.newsmain/article/0/6/1619579/Science/Atlanta%27s.tree.canopy.at.risk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/atlanta/0002010001.html|title=Introduction to Atlanta | publisher= Wiley Publishing, Inc. | work= Frommer's |accessdate=2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.atlantamagazine.com/article.php?id=207 |title= City Observed: Power Plants |accessdate=2007-09-28 |last= Warhop |first= Bill |work= Atlanta |publisher= Atlanta Magazine |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070607192757/http://www.atlantamagazine.com/article.php?id=207 |archivedate= 2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;10best.com&quot;&gt;http://www.10best.com/destinations/georgia/atlanta/&lt;/ref&gt; The city's [[Peachtree Street|main street]] is named after a [[Peach|tree]], and beyond the Downtown, Midtown, and Buckhead business districts, the skyline gives way to a dense canopy of woods that spreads into the suburbs. The nickname is factually accurate, as the city's tree coverage percentage is at 36%, the highest out of all major American cities, and above the national average of 27%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deeproot.com/blog/blog-entries/tree-cover-how-does-your-city-measure-up&lt;/ref&gt; Atlanta's tree coverage does not go unnoticed—it was the main reason cited by ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' in naming Atlanta a &quot;Place of a Lifetime&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.ajc.com/inside-access/2009/09/17/atlanta-a-national-geographic-traveler-place-of-a-lifetime/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;For a sprawling city with the nation’s ninth-largest metro area, Atlanta is surprisingly lush with trees—[[magnolia]]s, [[Cornus (genus)|dogwoods]], [[Pine|Southern pines]], and magnificent [[oak]]s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/city-guides/atlanta-georgia/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The city's lush tree canopy, which filters out pollutants and cools sidewalks and buildings, has increasingly been under assault from man and nature due to heavy rains, drought, aged forests, new pests, and urban construction. A 2001 study found that Atlanta's heavy tree cover declined from 48% in 1974 to 38% in 1996. This loss of tree canopy resulted in a 33% increase in stormwater runoff and a loss of 11 million pounds of pollutants removed annually, a value of approximately $28 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treenextdoor.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=148&amp;Itemid=179&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a historic [[drought]] in the late [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], Atlanta lost trees at an unprecedented rate. For example, [[Piedmont Park]] lost about a dozen large, historic trees in 2009, compared to two or three during normal years. Although many of Atlanta's trees are between 80&amp;ndash;100 years old and thus reaching the end of their normal lifespan, the drought accelerated their demise by shrinking the trees' roots. Fortunately, the problem is being addressed by community organizations and city government.&lt;ref name=&quot;publicbroadcasting.net&quot;/&gt; [[Trees Atlanta]], a non-profit organization founded in 1985, has planted and distributed over 75,000 shade trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = Trees Atlanta | url = http://www.treesatlanta.org/aboutus.html | accessdate = 2007-09-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070922033545/http://www.treesatlanta.org/aboutus.html |archivedate = September 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlanta's city government awarded $130,000 in grants to neighborhood groups to plant trees.&lt;ref name=&quot;publicbroadcasting.net&quot;/&gt;

Being a city of trees encourages outdoor activity, and thanks to a perpetually mild climate, nature is a constant guest in Atlanta. The city is home to the [[Atlanta Dogwood Festival]], an annual arts and crafts festival held one weekend during early April, when the native [[Cornus (genus)|dogwoods]] are in bloom. Downtown's [[Centennial Olympic Park]] is the start and finish of the [[Georgia Marathon]], which courses through central Atlanta and Decatur suburbs, business sections and major schools of higher learning like [[Georgia State University]], [[Agnes Scott College]], [[Emory University]] and [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]].

===Parks, gardens, and trails===
Ever-popular [[Piedmont Park]] and the quieter [[Grant Park (Atlanta)|Grant Park]] call to athletes and loungers throughout the week.&lt;ref name=&quot;10best.com&quot;/&gt; The [[Atlanta Botanical Garden]] is home to the [[Atlanta Botanical Garden#Canopy Walk|Canopy Walk]], a 600-foot elevated walkway ambling 40 feet from the ground through a 15-acre forest of mature hardwoods, and the only canopy-level pathway of its kind in the United States. 

The [[BeltLine]] is a former rail corridor that forms a 22-mile loop around Atlanta's central neighborhoods and has been acquired as public space. Most of the corridor is already open as a rough walking path, and it is to be developed into trails with the eventual addition of transit. A trail is already built near the [[West End (Atlanta)|West End]] neighborhood and one is underway from [[Piedmont Park]] near Midtown, south to [[Inman Park]]. [[BeltLine]] projects will increase Atlanta's park space by 40%,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beltline.org/Implementation/ParksandGreenspace/tabid/1736/Default.aspx Atlanta BeltLine]&lt;/ref&gt; including two new parks: [[Historic Fourth Ward Park]], now open, and [[Westside Park]].

PATH maintains a network of biking and walking trails in Metro Atlanta including one that passes along the [[Carter Center]] and through [[Freedom Park]].

===Architecture===
[[File:1 Symphony Tower.jpg|thumb|Midtown boasts various modern and post-modern architectural styles]]
{{Main|Architecture of Atlanta}}
Atlanta's skyline is punctuated with highrise and midrise buildings of modern and postmodern vintage. Its tallest landmark—the [[Bank of America Plaza (Atlanta)|Bank of America Plaza]]—is the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|42nd-tallest building in the world]] at {{convert|1023|ft|m|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001338.html|title=World's Tallest Buildings | publisher= Infoplease |accessdate=2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the tallest building in the United States outside of [[Chicago]] and [[New York City]] and the tallest building in any U.S. state capital.

Unlike many other Southern cities such as [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]], and [[New Orleans]], Atlanta chose not to retain its historic Old South architectural characteristics. Instead, Atlanta viewed itself as the leading city of a progressive &quot;New South&quot; and opted for expressive modern structures.&lt;ref&gt;Craig (1995), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Atlanta's skyline includes works by most major U.S. firms and some of the more prominent architects of the 20th century, including [[Michael Graves]], [[Richard Meier]], [[Marcel Breuer]], [[Renzo Piano]], Pickard Chilton, and locally based internationally known Mack Scogin and Merrill Elam Architects. 

Atlanta's most notable hometown architect may be [[John Portman]] whose creation of the atrium hotel beginning with the [[Hyatt Regency Atlanta]]—one of the tallest buildings in Atlanta at the time of its completion in 1967&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlantaregency.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/index.jsp Hyatt Regency Atlanta].&lt;/ref&gt;—made a significant mark on hospitality architecture. Through his work, Portman—a graduate of [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]]'s [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Architecture|College of Architecture]]—reshaped downtown Atlanta with his designs for the [[Atlanta Merchandise Mart]], [[Peachtree Center]], the [[Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel]], and [[SunTrust Plaza]].

===Neighborhoods===
{{Main|Neighborhoods of Atlanta}}
Atlanta fell victim to the urban flight that affected other major American cities in the 20th century, causing the decline of well-to-do [[Neighborhoods of Atlanta#east side|east side]] neighborhoods such as [[Inman Park]] and [[Candler Park]], typified by their [[American Craftsman|craftsman]] bungalows and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian mansions]]. In the 1970s, after neighborhood opposition blocked two [[Interstate 485 (Georgia)|freeways]] from being built through the east side, the area became the starting point for Atlanta's [[gentrification]] wave. By the early 1990s, the neighborhoods had transformed into shining examples of [[new urbanism|renewal]], and are now considered [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hip]], urban neighborhoods, appealing to young residents who wish to be in close proximity to entertainment, shopping and transportation options.

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, [[gentrification]] expanded into other parts of Atlanta, spreading into the historic [[streetcar suburb]]'s east of Downtown and Midtown, such as the [[Old Fourth Ward]], [[Kirkwood (Atlanta)|Kirkwood]], [[Cabbagetown (Atlanta)|Cabbagetown]], and the neighborhoods along the [[BeltLine]]. Older homes were renovated, new houses were constructed, and once-forgotten leafy, urban villages were rehabilitated. On the western side of the city, condos, apartments, and retail space were built into former warehouses spaces, quickly transforming once-industrial [[West Midtown]] into a shining model of [[smart growth]]. While the infill growth has slowed somewhat during the [[Late-2000s recession]], it still continues at a steady pace, expanding into areas such as [[Capitol View]], [[Peoplestown]], and [[Adair Park]].
[[File:Album 23 186.jpg|thumb|upright|High-rise residential units under construction in Midtown]]
The city's highrises are clustered in the three business districts of Atlanta—[[Downtown Atlanta|Downtown]], [[Midtown Atlanta|Midtown]], and [[Buckhead (Atlanta)|Buckhead]] (there are also two major suburban business districts, [[Perimeter Center]] to the north and [[Cumberland, Georgia|Cumberland]] to the northwest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bo/?id=101302|title=Districts and Zones of Atlanta | publisher=Emporis.com |accessdate=2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downtown contains the most office space in the metro area and is home to many government offices. Notable skyscrapers include the [[191 Peachtree Tower]], [[Westin Peachtree Plaza]], [[SunTrust Plaza]], [[Georgia-Pacific Tower]], and the buildings of [[Peachtree Center]]. 

[[Midtown Atlanta]], located north of Downtown, developed rapidly after the completion of [[One Atlantic Center]] in 1987. In addition to being a major employment center for the metro area, Midtown contains the offices of many of the region's law firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Southerland| first = Randy| title = What do Atlanta's big law firms see in Midtown?| publisher = Atlanta Business Chronicle| date = 2004-11-19| url = http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2004/11/22/focus10.html
| accessdate = 2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, former Mayor Franklin set in motion a plan to make the 14-block stretch of [[Peachtree Street]] in Midtown Atlanta (nicknamed &quot;Midtown Mile&quot;) a street-level luxury shopping destination to rival [[Beverly Hills]]' [[Rodeo Drive]] or [[Chicago]]'s [[Magnificent Mile]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midtownalliance.org/RET_Vision.htm|title=Expert: Peachtree Poised to Be Next Great Shopping Street | publisher= Midtown Alliance |accessdate=2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midtownalliance.org/RET_ICSC.html|title=Mayor to Retailers: Peachtree Is Open for Business | publisher= Midtown Alliance |accessdate=2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2011 these plans were rolled back to more modest levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/print-edition/2011/05/06/developers-launch-new-concept-for.html Douglas Sams, &quot;Developers launch new concept for Midtown Mile&quot;, May 6, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Buckhead (Atlanta)|Buckhead]], the city's uptown district, is eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) north of Downtown. Beginning as a wealthy suburban community with the construction of [[Lenox Square]] mall in the 1950s, the area has since developed into a major employment, commercial, and financial center. Immediately surrounding Buckhead's skyscrapers are wealthy neighborhoods of single-family homes. 

Southwestern Atlanta contains a number of suburbs popular with African-Americans, such as [[Collier Heights]], Cascade Heights and Peyton Forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Guerrero| first = Lucio| title = Lake Forest No. 3 on list of best homes for rich| work = Chicago Sun-Times online edition| publisher = Chicago Sun-Times| date = 2001-03-13| url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010313/ai_n13893847| accessdate = 2008-12-01}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlanta was in the midst of a construction and retail boom prior to the [[late-2000s recession]], with over 60 new highrise or midrise buildings either proposed or under construction in 2006.&lt;ref name=A-T-L&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanplanet.org/UP.Dynamic/atlanta.php|title=Growth in the A-T-L | publisher=UrbanPlanet Institute LLC |accessdate=2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in many cities, new development slowed drastically with the beginning of the Recession.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Atlanta}}
[[File:10 The High.jpg|thumb|left|The [[High Museum of Art]], a division of the [[Woodruff Arts Center]] in [[Midtown Atlanta]]]]
Atlanta, while very much in the South, has a culture that is no longer strictly [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern]]. This is due to the fact that in addition to a large population of migrants from other parts of the U.S., nearly three-quarters of a million [[Immigration to the United States|foreign-born people]] make Atlanta their home, accounting for 13 percent of the city's population and making Atlanta one of the most [[Multi-culturalism|multi-cultural]] cities in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajc.com/news/foreign-born-population-continues-780806.html&lt;/ref&gt; A random Atlantan is more likely to have been born in [[Bangalore]], [[Seoul]], or [[Indianapolis]] than in Atlanta. Thus, although traditional Southern culture is part of Atlanta's cultural fabric, it's mostly the backdrop to one of the nation's leading international cities. This unique cultural combination reveals itself at the [[High Museum of Art]], the bohemian shops of [[Little Five Points]], and the multi-cultural dining choices found along [[Buford Highway]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frommers.com/destinations/atlanta/0002010001.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entertainment and performing arts===
{{See also|Popular music artists from Atlanta|}}
[[File:Fox Theatre Atlanta.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta)|Fox Theatre]]]]
The classical music scene in the metropolitan Atlanta area includes the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]], [[Atlanta Opera]], [[Atlanta Ballet]], [[Gwinnett Ballet Theatre]], [[Atlanta Baroque Orchestra]], [[New Trinity Baroque]], the Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra, [[Georgia Boy Choir]] and the [[Atlanta Boy Choir]]. Classical musicians have included renowned conductors [[Robert Shaw (conductor)|Robert Shaw]] and the Atlanta Symphony's [[Robert Spano]].

The [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)|Fox Theatre]] is an historic landmark and one of the highest grossing venues in the world. The city also has a large collection of highly successful music venues of various sizes that host top and emerging touring acts. Popular local venues include [[the Tabernacle]], the [[Variety Playhouse]], [[The Masquerade (nightclub)|The Masquerade]], The Star Community Bar and [[the EARL]].

The city contains a flourishing theater community. Major Theater groups include the Tony Award-winning Alliance Theater (part of the Woodruff Arts Center), the internationally-known [[Center for Puppetry Arts]], Theatrical Outfit, Seven Stages Theater, The Horizon Theater Company, improv group Dad's Garage, Actor's Express, and the [[Shakespeare Tavern]].

Atlanta is also a major hub for the marching arts. The city is home of [[Spirit Drum and Bugle Corps]], who competes in [[Drum Corps International]], and both [[Alliance Drum and Bugle Corps]] and the [http://Corpsvets.org CorpsVets Drum and Bugle Corps], both of which participate in the [[Drum Corps Associates]] circuit.

Atlanta is the home of recording studios/companies [[So So Def Recordings]], [[Grand Hustle Records]], [[BME Recordings]], [[Block Entertainment]], [[Konvict Muzik]], and [[1017 Brick Squad]].

Future museums planned for the city include the National Health Museum, the College Football Hall of Fame, and the Center of Civil and Human Rights, all to be constructed in the emerging tourist district surrounding Centennial Olympic Park.

Due to Atlanta's mild climate, outdoor events and attractions are plentiful in the city. [[Piedmont Park]] hosts many of Atlanta's festivals and cultural events, including the annual [[Atlanta Dogwood Festival]] and [[Atlanta Pride]].&lt;ref name=piedmonthist&gt;{{cite web | title = Park History | publisher = Piedmont Park Conservancy | url = http://www.piedmontpark.org/history/history.html | accessdate = 2007-07-07 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070704150329/http://www.piedmontpark.org/history/history.html |archivedate = July 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atlanta Botanical Garden]] sits next to the park, home to the {{convert|600|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Atlanta Botanical Garden#Canopy Walk|Kendeda Canopy Walk]], a [[Skyway|skywalk]] that allows visitors to tour one of the city's last remaining urban forests ­from {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}}. The Canopy Walk is considered the only canopy-level pathway of its kind in the United States. [[Zoo Atlanta]], located in [[Grant Park (Atlanta)|Grant Park]], houses over 1,300 animals representing more than 220 species.

As the [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]], Atlanta is the site of most of Georgia's state government. The [[Georgia State Capitol]] building, located downtown, houses the offices of the [[Governor of Georgia|governor]], lieutenant governor and secretary of state, as well as the [[Georgia General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The [[Georgia Governor's Mansion|Governor's Mansion]] is located on [[Pace's Ferry|West Paces Ferry Road]], in a residential section of Buckhead. Atlanta is also home to [[Georgia Public Broadcasting]] headquarters, and is the county seat of Fulton County, with which it shares responsibility for the [[Atlanta-Fulton Public Library System]].

The city is divided into 25 [[neighborhood planning unit]]s or NPUs, which in turn are divided into [[Neighborhoods of Atlanta|242 officially defined neighborhoods]], some of which are traditional neighborhoods, while others are large districts containing multiple neighborhoods, such as Downtown and Midtown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantaga.gov/government/planning/neighborhoodlist.aspx City of Atlanta, &quot;Atlanta Neighborhoods&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crime===
{{Main|Crime in Atlanta}}

Crime in Atlanta has been consistently dropping. Between 2001 and 2009 the crime rate in Atlanta dropped by 40 percent, according to the FBI. Homicide fell 57 percent. Rape is down 72 percent. Violent crime overall is down 55 percent. Atlanta’s public safety improvement has occurred at more than twice the rate of the rest of the country. Crime is down across the country, but Atlanta’s improvement has far surpassed the national trend.  This relative improvement explains why Atlanta—after ranking in the top five highest crime cities for most of the previous three decades—now ranks 31st. Atlanta has lower crime than [[Salt Lake City]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] and [[Tacoma, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ajc.com/opinion/how-to-create-a-711260.html |title=How to create a safer Atlanta |first=David |last= Edwards |date=1 November 2010 |work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is served by the [[Atlanta Police Department]], which has an estimated 1,700 officers working in the force.

The city of Atlanta is seeing a unique and drastic demographic increase in its white population, and at a pace that outstrips the rest of the nation. The proportion of whites in the city's population, according to [[Brookings Institution]], grew faster between 2000 and 2006 than that of any other U.S. city. By 2010, Atlanta's white population had increased by 22,763 people. The white percentage increased from 31% in 2000, to 35% in 2006, to 38% in 2010, more than double the increase between 1990 and 2000. During the same time, the city's black poulation decreased by 28,795 people, shrinking from 61.4% of the city's population in 2000 to 54.0% in 2010. The demographic changes are due to an influx of whites into gentrifying [[Intown Atlanta|intown]] neighborhoods, such as [[East Atlanta]] and the [[Old Fourth Ward]], coupled with a movement of blacks into adjacent suburbs, such as [[Clayton County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;clatl.com&quot;&gt;[http://clatl.com/freshloaf/archives/2011/03/21/atlantas-census-numbers-reveal-dip-in-black-population-and-lots-of-people-who-mysteriously-vanished Thomas Wheatley, &quot;Atlanta's census numbers reveal dip in black population — and lots of people who mysteriously vanished&quot;, Creative Loafing, 2011-03-21]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clatl.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurwitt |first=Rob |url=http://www.governing.com/articles/0807atlanta.htm |title=Governing Magazine: Atlanta and the Urban Future, July 2008 |publisher=Governing.com |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2000 daytime population estimate by the Census Bureau,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/daytime/daytimepop.html| title=Estimated Daytime Population| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| accessdate=2006-04-02| date=December 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 250,000 more people commuted to Atlanta on any given workday, boosting the city's estimated daytime population to 676,431. This is an increase of 62.4% over Atlanta's resident population, making it the largest gain in daytime population in the country among cities with fewer than 500,000 residents.

According to census estimates, the city of Atlanta was the 13th fastest growing city in the nation, in terms of both percentage and numerical increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/013960.html |title=US Census Press Releases |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-04-05}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, the system has an active enrollment of 49,773 students, attending a total of 106 schools: including 58 elementary schools (three of which operate on a year-round calendar), 16 middle schools, 20 high schools, and 7 charter schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;APS&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | title = 2007–2008 APS Fast Facts  | publisher = Atlanta Public Schools  | url = http://www.atlanta.k12.ga.us/content/aps/FastFacts07.pdf  | accessdate = 2007-09-28 |format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071025055226/http://www.atlanta.k12.ga.us/content/aps/FastFacts07.pdf |archivedate = October 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school system also supports two alternative schools for middle and/or high school students, two single-sex academies, and an adult learning center.&lt;ref name=&quot;APS&quot;/&gt; The school system also owns and operates radio station [[WABE-FM]] 90.1, a [[National Public Radio]] affiliate, and [[Public Broadcasting Service]] television station WPBA 30.

==Transportation==
===Air===
[[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] {{airport codes|ATL|KATL}}, the world's busiest airport as measured by [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|passenger traffic]] and by [[World's busiest airports by traffic movements|aircraft traffic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jim|last=Tharpe|url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2007/01/04/0104airport.html|title=Atlanta airport still the &quot;busiest&quot;: Hartsfield-Jackson nips Chicago's O'hare for second year in a row|publisher=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=2007-01-04|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070106042352/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2007/01/04/0104airport.html|archivedate=2007-01-06 |accessdate=2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides air service between Atlanta and many national and international destinations. [[Delta Air Lines]] and [[AirTran Airways]] maintain their largest hubs at the airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=615 |title=Delta Invites Customers to Improve Their Handicap with New Service to Hilton Head, Expanded Service to Myrtle Beach |publisher=News.delta.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2009/08/31/story3.html |title=AirTran spreading its wings in Atlanta as Delta refocuses - Atlanta Business Chronicle: |publisher=Atlanta.bizjournals.com |date=2009-08-28 |accessdate=2010-04-05 |first=J. Scott |last=Trubey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situated {{nowrap|10 miles}} ({{nowrap|16 km}}) south of downtown, the airport covers most of the land inside a wedge formed by [[Interstate 75]], [[Interstate 85]], and [[Interstate 285]]. The MARTA rail system has a station in the airport terminal, and provides direct service to Downtown, Midtown, Buckhead, and Sandy Springs. The major [[general aviation]] airports near the city proper are [[DeKalb-Peachtree Airport]] {{airport codes|PDK|KPDK}} and [[Fulton County Airport (Georgia)|Brown Field]] {{airport codes|FTY|KFTY}}. See [[List of airports in the Atlanta area]] for a more complete listing.

===Highway===
With a comprehensive network of freeways that radiate out from the city, Atlantans rely on their cars as the dominant mode of transportation in the region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Atlanta: Smart Travel Tips  | work = Fodor's  | publisher = Fodor's Travel  | url = http://www.fodors.com/miniguides/mgresults.cfm?destination=atlanta@15&amp;cur_section=tra&amp;pg=2  | accessdate = 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlanta is mostly encircled by [[Interstate 285]], a [[beltway]] locally known as &quot;the Perimeter&quot; which has come to mark the boundary between the interior of the region and its surrounding [[suburb]]s.

Three major [[interstate highways]] converge in Atlanta; [[Interstate 20|I-20]] runs east to west across town, while I-75 runs from northwest to southeast, and I-85 runs from northeast to southwest.  The latter two combine to form the [[Downtown Connector]] (I-75/85) through the middle of the city.  The combined highway carries more than 340,000 vehicles per day.  The Connector is one of the ten most congested segments of interstate highway in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/2006/02/06/cx_bm_0207trafficslide_6.html?thisSpeed=6000| work=Worst City Choke Points | title= Atlanta, I-75 at I-85 | publisher=Forbes.com| accessdate=2006-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intersection of I-85 and I-285 in [[Doraville, Georgia|Doraville]]—officially called the [[Tom Moreland Interchange]], is known to most residents as [[Spaghetti Junction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/traffic/roadwords.html| work=AJC Online | title= Atlanta Road Lingo | publisher=Atlanta Journal-Constitution| accessdate=2006-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metropolitan Atlanta is approached by 13 freeways.  In addition to the aforementioned interstates, [[I-575]], [[Georgia 400]], [[Georgia 141]], [[Interstate 675 (Georgia)|I-675]], [[Georgia 316]], [[I-985]], Stone Mountain Freeway ([[US 78]]), and Langford Parkway (SR 166) all terminate just within or beyond the Perimeter, with the exception of Langford Parkway, limiting the transportation options in the central city.

This strong automotive reliance has resulted in heavy [[traffic]] and contributes to Atlanta's [[air pollution]], which has made Atlanta one of the more polluted cities in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Copeland  | first = Larry  | title = Atlanta pollution going nowhere  | work = USA TODAY  | publisher = Gannett Co. Inc  | date=  2001-01-31  | url = http://www.usatoday.com/weather/news/2001/2001-01-31-atlanta-pollution.htm  | accessdate = 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Clean Air Campaign]] was created in 1996 to help reduce pollution in metro Atlanta.

Around 2008 the Atlanta metro area has ranked at or near the top of the longest average commute times in the U.S. Also, the Atlanta metro area has ranked at or near the top for worst traffic in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Atlanta traffic the worst in America | url = http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2008/04/28/daily97.html | date=2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public transportation===
{{Main|Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|Streetcars in Atlanta|Commuter rail in Atlanta|Trolleybuses in Atlanta}}
[[File:MARTA - N3 Station.jpg|thumb|right|[[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority]] provides public transportation in Atlanta]]
Notwithstanding heavy automotive usage, Atlanta's [[rapid transit|subway]] system, operated by [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority]] (MARTA), is the [[List of United States Rapid Transit systems by Ridership|seventh busiest in the country]],&lt;ref name=APTA&gt;American Public Transportation Association, [http://www.apta.com/research/stats/ridership/riderep/documents/07q4hr.pdf Heavy Rail Transit Ridership Report], Fourth Quarter 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; while MARTA's bus system is the [[List of United States local bus agencies by ridership|14th largest in the country]].

Various proposals would bring [[Streetcars in Atlanta|streetcars back to Atlanta]]. The Downtown Connector route, now funded, will connect Centennial Olympic Park with [[Peachtree Center]] and the [[Martin Luther King, Jr., National Historic Site|MLK historic site]]. Other proposed routes include lines along the 22-mile [[Beltline (Atlanta)|Beltline]] around Atlanta's central neighborhoods, as well as on Peachtree Street, Ralph David Abernathy Blvd., North Ave., and 17th St.&lt;ref&gt;[[Streetcars in Atlanta]]&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals also exist for a [[commuter rail]] system, MARTA rail line extensions, [[light rail]] lines, [[bus rapid transit]], and more suburban express buses.&lt;ref&gt;http://dot.ga.gov/aboutGeorgiadot/Board/Documents/2010Presentations/September/Concept3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intercity rail===
Atlanta began as a railroad town and it still serves as a major rail junction, with several freight lines belonging to [[Norfolk Southern]] and [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] intersecting below street level in downtown. It is the home of major [[classification yard]]s for both railroads, Inman Yard on the NS and Tilford Yard on the CSX. Long-distance passenger service is provided by [[Amtrak]]'s [[Crescent (Amtrak)|Crescent train]], which connects Atlanta with many cities between New Orleans and New York. The [[Peachtree Station|Amtrak station]] is located several miles north of downtown—and it lacks a connection to the MARTA rail system. An ambitious, long-standing proposal would create a Multi-Modal Passenger Terminal downtown, adjacent to Philips Arena and the Five Points MARTA station, which would link, in a single facility, MARTA bus and rail, intercity bus services, proposed commuter rail services to other Georgia cities, and Amtrak.

==Surrounding municipalities==
{{Main|Metro Atlanta}}

The population of the Atlanta region spreads across a metropolitan area of {{convert|8376|sqmi|km2|0}}—a land area larger than that of [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MACOC-growth&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Atlanta MSA Growth Statistics | publisher = Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce | date= 05-2006 | url = http://www.metroatlantachamber.com/macoc/business/img/MSAGrowthStatsReport2006.pdf | accessdate = 2007-09-28 |format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927062537/http://www.metroatlantachamber.com/macoc/business/img/MSAGrowthStatsReport2006.pdf |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Georgia contains the second highest number of counties in the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = States, Counties, and Statistically Equivalent Entities | work = Geographic Areas Reference Manual | publisher = U.S. Department of Commerce | date= 11-1994 | url = http://www.census.gov/geo/www/GARM/Ch4GARM.pdf | accessdate = 2007-09-28 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; area residents live under a heavily decentralized collection of governments.

==International relations==
===Diplomatic missions===
{{See also|List of diplomatic missions in Atlanta}}
Atlanta, as the home of 24 general consulates, contains the seventh-highest concentration of diplomatic missions in the United States. Most of the diplomatic missions are located in [[Buckhead (Atlanta)|Buckhead]], [[Midtown Atlanta|Midtown]], or [[Peachtree Center]]. The city is also home to 36 honorary consulates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.georgia.org/BusinessInGeorgia/InternationalBusiness/Pages/Consulates.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, it was announced that Atlanta would be the host of the next Indian consulate, further proof of the city's expanding global reach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajc.com/news/indian-consulate-to-come-853688.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sister cities===

'''Axiology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:ἀξίᾱ|ἀξίᾱ]]}}, ''axiā'', &quot;value, worth&quot;; and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary: λόγος|-λόγος]]}}, ''[[wiktionary: logos|-logos]]'') is the philosophical study of [[value (ethics)|value]]. It is either the collective term for [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/axiology ''Random House Unabridged Dictionary'' Entry on Axiology.]&lt;/ref&gt;—philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of value—or the foundation for these fields, and thus similar to [[value theory]] and [[meta-ethics]]. The term was first used in the early 20th century by Paul Lapie, in 1902, and E. von Hartmann, in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel L. Hart. [http://www.jstor.org/pss/2105883 Axiology—Theory of Values]. ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Axiology studies mainly two kinds of values: [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]. Ethics investigates the concepts of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;good&quot; in individual and social conduct.  Aesthetics studies the concepts of &quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;harmony.&quot; '''Formal axiology,''' the attempt to lay out principles regarding value with [[mathematical rigor]], is exemplified by [[Robert S. Hartman]]'s [[Science of Value]].

&lt;!-- Please DO NOT alter the title to A Doll House; Wikipedia guidelines state that most-common title should be used. --&gt;
'''''A Doll's House''''' ({{lang-no|Et dukkehjem}}; also translated as ''A Doll House'') is a three-act play in [[prose]] by the [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]].&lt;ref&gt;The title of the play is most commonly translated as ''A Doll's House'', though some scholars use ''A Doll House''. [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] argues that the only significance in the alternative translation is the difference in the way the toy is named in Britain and the United States. [[Egil Törnqvist]] argues that the alternative &quot;simply sounds more idiomatic to Americans.&quot; See Simon (1991, 55), Törnqvist (1995, 54), and Worthen (2004, 666-691).&lt;/ref&gt; It premièred at the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, on 21 December 1879, having been published earlier that month.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 477).&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was controversial when first published, as it is sharply critical of 19th century marriage norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Krutch | first=Joseph Wood | coauthors= | title=&quot;Modernism&quot; in Modern Drama, A Definition and an Estimate | edition=First | location=Ithaca | pages=9 | publisher=Cornell University Press | year=1953 | oclc=176284}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Meyer]] argues that the play's theme is not [[women's rights]], but rather &quot;the need of every individual to find out the kind of person he or she really is and to strive to become that person.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 478).&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech given to the [[Norwegian Association for Women's Rights|Norwegian Women's Rights League]] in 1898, Ibsen insisted that he &quot;must disclaim the honor of having consciously worked for the women's rights movement,&quot; since he wrote &quot;without any conscious thought of making [[propaganda]],&quot; his task having been &quot;the ''description of humanity''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ibsen, &quot;Speech at the Festival of the Norwegian Women's Rights League, Christiana&quot;, 26 May 1898; in Dukore (1974, 563); see also Moi (2006, 229-230).&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish playwright [[August Strindberg]] attacked the play in his volume of short stories ''[[Getting Married (Strindberg)|Getting Married]]'' (1884).&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 476).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNESCO]] inscribed Ibsen's autographed manuscripts of ''A Doll's House'' on the [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2001, in recognition of their historical value.&lt;ref name=mow&gt;{{cite web|title= Henrik Ibsen: A Doll's House |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=23114&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | date=16 May 2008 |publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
===Act one===
''A Doll's House'' opens as Nora Helmer returns from Christmas shopping. Her husband Torvald comes out of his study to banter with her. They discuss how their finances will improve now that Torvald has a new job as a bank manager. Torvald expresses his horror of debt. Nora behaves childishly and he enjoys treating her like a child to be instructed and indulged.

Soon an old friend of Nora's, Christine Linde, arrives.  She is a childless widow who is moving back to the city. Her husband left her no money, so she has tried different kinds of work, and now hopes to find some work that is not too strenuous. Nora confides to Christine that she once secretly borrowed money from a disgraced lawyer, Nils Krogstad, to save Torvald's life when he was very ill, but she has not told him in order to protect his pride. She told everyone that the money came from her father, who died at about the same time. She has been repaying the debt from her housekeeping budget, and also from some work she got copying papers by hand, which she did secretly in her room, and took pride in her ability to earn money &quot;as if she were a man.&quot; Torvald's new job promises to finally liberate her from this debt.

Nora asks Torvald to give Christine a position as a secretary in the bank, and he agrees, as she has experience in bookkeeping. They leave the house together.

Krogstad arrives and tells Nora that he is worried he will be fired.  He asks her to help him keep his job and says that he will fight desperately to keep it. Nora is reluctant to commit to helping him, so Krogstad reveals that he knows she committed forgery on the [[Bond (finance)|bond]] she signed for her loan from him. As a woman, she needed an adult male co-signer, so she said she would have her father do so. However the signature is dated three days after his death, which suggests that it is a forgery. Nora admits that she did forge the signature, so as to spare her dying father further worry about her (she was pregnant, poor, and had a seriously ill husband). Krogstad explains that the forgery betrayed his trust and is also a serious crime. If he told others about it, her reputation would be ruined, as was his after a similar &quot;indiscretion,&quot; even though he was never prosecuted. He implies that what he did was in order to provide for his sick wife, who later died.

===Act two===
Christine arrives to help Nora repair a dress for a costume party she and Torvald are going to tomorrow. Then Torvald comes home from the bank and Nora pleads with him to reinstate Krogstad at the bank. She claims she is worried that Krogstad will publish libelous articles about Torvald and ruin his career. Torvald dismisses her fears and explains that although Krogstad is a good worker and seems to have turned his life around, he insists on firing him because Krogstad is not deferential enough to him in front of other bank personnel. Torvald goes into his study to do some work.

Next Dr. Rank, a family friend, arrives. Nora talks about asking him for a favor. Then he reveals that he has entered the terminal stage of [[tuberculosis]] of the spine (a contemporary euphemism for [[congenital syphilis]]), and that he has always been secretly in love with her. Nora tries to deny the first revelation and make light of it, but she is more disturbed by the second. She tries clumsily to tell him that she is not in love with him, but loves him dearly as a friend.

Desperate after being fired by Torvald, Krogstad arrives at the house. Nora gets Dr. Rank to go in to Torvald's study, so he does not see Krogstad.  When Krogstad comes in he declares he no longer cares about the remaining balance of Nora's loan, but that he will preserve the associated [[Bond (finance)|bond]] in order to blackmail Torvald into not only keeping him employed, but giving him a promotion. Nora explains that she has done her best to persuade her husband, but he refuses to change his mind. Krogstad informs Nora that he has written a letter detailing her crime (forging her father's signature of [[surety]] on the bond) and puts it in Torvald's mailbox, which is locked.

Nora tells Christine of her predicament. Christine says that she and Krogstad were in love before she married, and promises that she will try to convince him to relent.

Torvald comes in and tries to check his mail, but Nora distracts him by begging him to help her with the dance she has been rehearsing for the costume party, as she is so anxious about performing. She dances so badly and acts so worried that Torvald agrees to spend the whole evening coaching her. When the others go in to dinner, Nora stays behind for a few minutes and contemplates suicide to save her husband from the shame of the revelation of her crime, and more importantly to pre-empt any gallant gesture on his part to save her reputation.

===Act three===
{{Nora}}
Christine tells Krogstad that she only married her husband because she had no other means to support her sick mother and young siblings, and that she has returned to offer him her love again. She believes that he would not have stooped to unethical behavior if he had not been devastated by her abandonment and in dire financial straits. Krogstad is moved and offers to take back his letter to Torvald. However, Christine decides that Torvald should know the truth for the sake of his and Nora's marriage.

After literally dragging Nora home from the party, Torvald goes to check his mail, but is interrupted by Dr. Rank, who has followed them. Dr. Rank chats for a while so as to convey obliquely to Nora that this is a final goodbye, as he has determined that his death is near, but in general terms so that Torvald does not suspect what he is referring to. Dr. Rank leaves, and Torvald retrieves his letters. As he reads them Nora steels herself to take her life. Torvald confronts her with Krogstad's letter. Enraged, he declares that he is now completely in Krogstad's power—he must yield to Krogstad's demands and keep quiet about the whole affair. He berates Nora, calling her a dishonest and immoral woman and telling her she is unfit to raise their children. He says that from now on their marriage will be only a matter of appearances.

A maid enters, delivering a letter to Nora. Krogstad has returned the incriminating papers, saying that he regrets his actions. Torvald exults that he is saved as he burns the papers. He takes back his harsh words to his wife and tells her that he forgives her. Nora realizes that her husband is not the strong and gallant man she thought he was, and that he truly loves himself more than he does her.

Torvald explains that when a man has forgiven his wife it makes him love her all the more since it reminds him that she is totally dependent on him, like a child. He dismisses Nora's agonized choice made against her conscience for the sake of his health and her years of secret efforts to free them from the ensuing obligations and danger of loss of reputation, while preserving his peace of mind, as a mere mistake that she made owing to her foolishness, one of her most endearing feminine traits.

Nora tells Torvald that she is leaving him to live alone so she can find out who she is and what she believes and decide what to do with her life. She says she has been treated like a doll to play with, first by her father and then by him. Concerned for the family reputation, Torvald insists that she fulfill her duty as a wife and mother, but Nora says that her first duties are to herself, and she cannot be a good mother or wife without learning to be more than a plaything. She reveals that she had expected that he would want to sacrifice his reputation for hers, and that she had planned to kill herself to prevent him from doing so. She now realizes that Torvald is not at all the kind of person she had believed him to be, and that their marriage has been based on mutual fantasies and misunderstanding.

Torvald is unable to comprehend Nora's point of view, since it contradicts all that he had been taught about the female mind throughout his life. Furthermore, he is so narcissistic that it would be impossible for him to bear to understand how he appears to her, as selfish, hypocritical and more concerned with public reputation than with actual morality. Nora leaves her keys and wedding ring and as Torvald breaks down and begins to cry, baffled by what has happened, Nora leaves the house, slamming the door behind herself.

=== Alternative ending ===
It was felt by Ibsen's German agent that the original ending would not play well in German theatres; therefore, for the play's German debut, Ibsen was forced to write an alternative ending for it to be considered acceptable.&lt;ref name = altern&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ibsen.net/index.gan?id=11111794 |title=The alternative ending of A Doll's House |publisher=ibsen.net |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this ending, Nora is led to her children after having argued with Torvald. Seeing them, she collapses, and the curtain is brought down. Ibsen later called the ending a disgrace to the original play and referred to it as a 'barbaric outrage'.&lt;ref name = altern/&gt;

==Writing process and publication==
Ibsen started thinking about the play around May 1878, although he did not begin its first draft until a year later, having reflected on the themes and characters in the intervening period (he visualised its [[protagonist]], Nora, for instance, as having approached him one day wearing &quot;a blue woolen dress&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 463-467, 472).&lt;/ref&gt; He outlined his conception of the play as a &quot;modern [[tragedy]]&quot; in a note written in Rome on 19 October 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 466).&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;A woman cannot be herself in modern society,&quot; he argues, since it is &quot;an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ibsen, &quot;Notes for a Modern Tragedy&quot;; quoted by Meyer (1967, 466); see also Innes (2000, 79-81).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibsen sent a [[Foul papers|fair copy]] of the completed play to his publisher on 15 September 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 474).&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in [[Copenhagen]] on 4 December 1879, in an edition of 8,000 copies that sold out within a month; a second edition of 3,000 copies followed on 4 January 1880 and a third edition of 2,500 was issued on 8 March.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 475).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real-life basis===
''A Doll's House'' was based on the life of [[Laura Kieler]] (maiden name Laura Smith Petersen). She was a good friend of Ibsen. Much that happened between Nora and Torvald happened to Laura and her husband, Victor, with the most important exception being the forged signature that was the basis of Nora's loan. In real life, when Victor found out about Laura's secret loan, he divorced her and had her committed to an asylum. Two years later, she returned to her husband and children at his urging, and she went on to become a well-known Danish author, living to the age of 83. In the play, Nora left Torvald with head held high, though facing an uncertain future given the limitations women faced in the society of the time. Ibsen wrote A Doll's House at the point when Laura Kieler had been committed to the asylum, and the fate of this friend of the family shook him deeply, perhaps also because Laura had asked him to intervene at a crucial point in the scandal, which he did not feel able or willing to do. Instead, he turned this life situation into an aesthetically shaped, successful drama. Kieler eventually rebounded from the shame of the scandal and had her own successful writing career while remaining discontent with sole recognition as &quot;Ibsen's Nora&quot; years afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Törnqvist|first=Egil|authorlink=Egil Törnqvist|title=Ibsen, A doll's house|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-47866-9|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production history==
''A Doll's House'' received its world première on 21 December 1879 at the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, with [[Betty Hennings]] as Nora and [[Emil Poulsen]] as Torvald.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 477) and Moi (2006, 227, 230).&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the Norwegen newspaper ''Folkets Avis'', the critic [[Erik Bøgh]] admired Ibsen's originality and technical mastery: &quot;Not a single declamatory phrase, no high dramatics, no drop of blood, not even a tear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Meyer (1967, 477).&lt;/ref&gt; Every performance of its run was sold out.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 480).&lt;/ref&gt; Another production opened at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre|Royal Theatre]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, on 8 January 1880, while productions in [[Christiania]] (with [[Johanne Juell]] as Nora and [[Arnoldus Reimers]] as Torvald) and [[Bergen]] followed shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 479).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the actress [[Hedwig Raabe|Hedwig Niemann-Raabe]] refused to perform the play as written, declaring that &quot;''I'' would never leave ''my'' children!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 480).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the playwright's wishes were not protected by [[copyright]], Ibsen decided to avoid the danger of being re-written by a lesser dramatist by committing what he called a &quot;barbaric outrage&quot; on his play himself and giving it an alternative ending in which Nora did not leave.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 480-481).&lt;/ref&gt; A production of this version opened in [[Flensburg]] in February 1880.&lt;ref name=m481&gt;Meyer (1967, 481).&lt;/ref&gt; This version was also played in [[Hamburg]], [[Dresden]], [[Hanover]], and [[Berlin]], although, in the wake of protests and a lack of success, Niemann-Raabe eventually restored the original ending.&lt;ref name=m481/&gt; Another production of the original version, some rehearsals of which Ibsen attended, opened on 3 March 1880 at the [[Residenz Theatre]] in [[Munich]].&lt;ref name=m481/&gt;

The first British production opened on 7 June 1889, starring [[Janet Achurch]] as Nora.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibsen|first=Henrik|others=[[William Archer (critic)|William C. Archer]] translator|title=A Doll's House [Illustrated with photographs]|publisher=T Fisher Unwin|location=London|year=1889|oclc=29743002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achurch played Nora again for a 7-day run in 1897. Soon after its London première, Achurch brought the play to Australia in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 353).&lt;/ref&gt;

The play made its American première on Broadway at the [[Palmer's Theatre]] on 21 December 1889, starring [[Beatrice Cameron]] as Nora Helmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Opening Night Production Credits: A Doll's House (1889) | url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=5582 | work=The Internet Broadway Database| year=2008 | accessdate=18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first performed in France in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 479).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other productions in the United States include one in 1902 starring [[Mrs. Fiske|Minnie Maddern Fiske]] and a 1997 production starring [[Janet McTeer]] at [[Belasco Theater]], which received three [[Tony Awards]] and the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival|Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Play]].

A new translation by Zinnie Harris at the [[Donmar Warehouse]], starring [[Gillian Anderson]], [[Toby Stephens]], [[Anton Lesser]], [[Tara FitzGerald]] and [[Christopher Eccleston]] opened in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bassett|first=Kate|date=24 May 2009|title=The Donmar's new Ibsen isn't so much a clever interpretation as a bit of questionable rewriting|journal=[[The Independent]]|location=London|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/a-dolls-house-donmar-londonbrthe-observer-nt-cottesloe-londonbrgrasses-of-a-thousand-colours-royal-court-upstairs-london-1689909.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{or-section|date=February 2011}}
''A Doll's House'' criticises the traditional roles of men and women in 19th-century marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first= Ann R|title=Women in literature: reading through the lens of gender|editor=Fisher, Jerilyn;  Silber, Ellen S|publisher=Greenwood|location=Westport, CT|pages=99–101|chapter=The slammed door that still reverberates|isbn=978-0-313-31346-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; To many 19th-century Europeans, this was scandalous. Nothing was considered more holy than the covenant of marriage, and to portray it in such a way was completely unacceptable;&lt;ref name=&quot;JMcF&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=McFarlane|first=James|title=The Cambridge companion to Ibsen|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=1994|page=167|isbn=978-0-521-42321-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, a few more open-minded critics such as the Irish playwright [[George Bernard Shaw]] found Ibsen's willingness to examine society without prejudice exhilarating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffith |first=Gareth |title=Socialism and Superior Brains: Political Thought of Bernard Shaw|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1993|pages=164–165|isbn=978-0-415-12473-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the production's lead actress refused to play the part of Nora unless Ibsen changed the ending, which, under pressure, he eventually did.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro&quot; /&gt; In the alternative ending, Nora gives her husband another chance after he reminds her of her responsibility to their children. This ending proved unpopular and Ibsen later regretted his decision on the matter. Virtually all productions today, however, use the original ending, as do nearly all of the film versions of this play, including [[Dariush Mehrjui]]'s ''[[Sara (film)|Sara]]'' (the [[Argentina|Argentine]] version, made in 1943 and starring [[Delia Garcés]], does not; it also modernizes the story, setting it in the early 1940s).

Because of the radical departure from traditional behavior and theatrical convention involved in Nora's leaving home, her act of slamming the door as she leaves has come to represent the play itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Script into performance: a structuralist approach |first=Richard |last=Hornby |page=157 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dsNX6DTt7w8C&amp;pg=PA157 |year=1995 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ibsen, a doll's house |first=Egil |last=Törnqvist |page=150 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fc1z4O-Kvn4C&amp;pg=PA150 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; One critic noted, &quot;That slammed door reverberated across the roof of the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Lawrence S.|title=Culture &amp; Values, Volume II: A Survey of the Humanities with Readings|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|pages=492|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KiW8xOi0FvYC&amp;pg=PA492|first2=John J.|last2=Reich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the criticism is focused on Nora's self-discovery, but the other characters also have depth and value. The infected Dr. Rank and Nora both suffer from the irresponsibility of their fathers: Dr. Rank for the father who infected his family, Nora for the father she likely married to protect. Dr. Rank's disease becomes a metaphor for the poison infecting the Helmers' marriage and society at large. Mrs. Linde provides the model of a woman who has been forced to fend for and find herself – a self-aware, resourceful woman.

==Adaptations==
''A Doll's House'' has been adapted for several film releases including two in 1973: one directed by [[Joseph Losey]], starring [[Jane Fonda]], [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] and [[Trevor Howard]]; and one directed by [[Patrick Garland]] with stars [[Claire Bloom]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], and [[Ralph Richardson]].  In 1993, [[David Thacker]] directed, with stars [[Juliet Stevenson]], [[Trevor Eve]] and [[David Calder (actor)|David Calder]]. [[Dariush Mehrjui]]'s 1993 film ''[[Sara (film)|Sara]]'' is based on ''A Doll's House'', where ''Sara'', played by [[Niki Karimi]], is the ''Nora'' of Ibsen's play.

A version for American television [[A Doll's House (1959 film)|was made in 1959]], directed by [[George Schaefer (director)|George Schaefer]] and starring [[Julie Harris]], [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Hume Cronyn]], [[Eileen Heckart]] and [[Jason Robards]]. A 1938 US radio production starred [[Joan Crawford]] as Nora and [[Basil Rathbone]] as Torvald. A later US radio version by the Theatre Guild in 1947 featured Rathbone with [[Wendy Hiller]]and [[Catherine Rowan]], his co-star from a contemporary Broadway production.

The '''AIM-7 Sparrow''' is an American, medium-range [[semi-active radar homing]] [[air-to-air missile]] operated by the [[United States Air Force]], [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]], as well as various allied air forces and navies. Sparrow and its derivatives were the West's principal beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missile from the late 1950s until the 1990s. It remains in service, although it is being phased out in aviation applications in favor of the more advanced [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]]. The Self-Defence Forces of [[Japan]] also employ the Sparrow missile, though it is being phased out and replaced by the [[Mitsubishi AAM-4]]. NATO pilots use the [[brevity code]] '''[[Fox (code word)|Fox One]]''' in radio communication to signal launch of a Semi-Active Radar Homing Missile such as the Sparrow. 

The Sparrow was used as the basis for a [[surface-to-air missile]], the [[RIM-7 Sea Sparrow]], which is used by the United States Navy for air defense of its ships.

==Development==
===Sparrow I===
[[File:XF3D-1 AAM-N-2 NAN7-54.jpg|thumb|left|Sparrow I's during tests on a [[F3D Skyknight]] in the early 1950s]]

{{nowrap|The Sparrow emerged}} from a late-1940s [[United States Navy]] program to develop a guided rocket weapon for air-to-air use. In [[1947 in aviation|1947]] the Navy contracted [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] to build a [[beam riding]] version of a standard {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} [[HVAR]], the standard unguided aerial rocket, under  '''Project Hotshot'''. The weapon was initially dubbed '''KAS-1''', then '''AAM-2''', and, from [[1948 in aviation|1948]] on, '''AAM-N-2'''. The airframe was developed by [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. The diameter of the HVAR proved to be inadequate for the electronics, leading Douglas to expand the missile's airframe to {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} diameter. The prototype weapon began unpowered flight-tests in 1947, and made its first aerial interception in [[1952 in aviation|1952]].&lt;ref name=Designation_Systems/&gt;

After a protracted development cycle the initial '''AAM-N-2 ''Sparrow''''' entered service in [[1956 in aviation|1956]], carried by the [[F3H Demon|F3H-2M Demon]] and [[F7U Cutlass]] [[fighter aircraft]]. Compared to the modern versions, the Sparrow I was more [[Streamliner|streamlined]] and featured a bullet-shaped airframe with a long pointed nose.

Sparrow I was a limited and rather primitive weapon. The limitations of beam-riding guidance (which was slaved to an optical sight, requiring visual identification of the target) restricted the missile to visual-range attacks and made it essentially useless against a maneuvering target. Only about 2,000 rounds were produced to this standard.

===Sparrow II===
As early as 1950 Douglas examined equipping the Sparrow with an active radar seeker, initially known as '''XAAM-N-2a ''Sparrow II''''', the original retroactively becoming '''''Sparrow I'''''. In 1952 it was given the new code '''AAM-N-3'''. The active radar made the Sparrow II a &quot;fire and forget&quot; weapon, allowing several to be fired at separate targets at the same time.

By [[1955 in aviation|1955]] Douglas proposed going ahead with development, intending it to be the primary weapon for the [[F5D Skylancer]] [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]]. It was later selected, with some controversy, to be the primary weapon for the Canadian [[Avro Arrow]] supersonic interceptor, along with the new Astra fire-control system. For Canadian use and as a second source for US missiles, [[Canadair]] was selected to build the missiles in [[Quebec]].

However, the small size of the missile forebody and the K-band AN/APQ-64-radar limited performance, and it was never able to work in testing. After considerable development and test firings in the U.S. and Canada, Douglas abandoned development in 1956. Canadair continued development until the Arrow was cancelled in [[1958 in aviation|1958]].

===Sparrow X===
A subvariant of the Sparrow I armed with the same nuclear warhead as the [[AIR-2 Genie|MB-1 Genie]] was proposed in 1958, but was cancelled shortly thereafter.

===Sparrow III===
[[File:Sparrow III launch F3H-2M NAN2-59.jpg|thumb|upright|[[F3H Demon]] launching a Sparrow III in 1958]]

Concurrently with the development of the Sparrow I, in [[1951 in aviation|1951]], [[Raytheon]] began work on the [[semi-active radar homing]] version of Sparrow family of missiles, the '''AAM-N-6 ''Sparrow III'''''. The first of these weapons entered [[United States Navy]] service in [[1958 in aviation|1958]].

The '''AAM-N-6a''' was similar to the -6, but used a new [[Thiokol]] liquid-fuel rocket engine for improved performance. It also included changes to the guidance electronics to make it effective at higher closing speeds. The -6a was also selected to arm the Air Force's ''F-110A Spectre''([[F-4 Phantom]]) fighters in [[1962 in aviation|1962]], known to them as the '''AIM-101'''. It entered production in 1959, with 7500 being built.

Another upgrade reverted to a Rocketdyne solid-fuel motor for the '''AAM-N-6b''', which started production in [[1963 in aviation|1963]]. The new motor significantly increased maximum range to {{convert|35|km|mi}} for head-on attacks.

During this year the Navy and Air Force agreed on standardized naming conventions for their missiles. The Sparrows became the AIM-7 series. The original Sparrow I and aborted Sparrow II became the '''AIM-7A''' and '''AIM-7B''', despite both being out of service. The -6, -6a and -6B became the '''AIM-7C''', '''AIM-7D''' and '''AIM-7E''' respectively.

25,000 AIM-7Es were produced, and saw extensive use during the [[Vietnam War]], where its performance was generally considered disappointing. The mixed results were a combination of reliability problems (exacerbated by the tropical climate), limited pilot training in fighter-to-fighter combat, and restrictive rules of engagement that generally prohibited BVR (beyond visual range) engagements. The P&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; (kill probability) of the AIM-7E was less than 10%; US fighter pilots shot down  55 aircraft using the Sparrow.

In [[1969 in aviation|1969]] an improved version, the E-2, was introduced with clipped wings and various changes to the fusing. Considered a &quot;dogfight Sparrow&quot;, the AIM-7E-2 was intended to be used at shorter ranges where the missile was still travelling at high speeds, and in the head-on aspect, making it much more useful in the visual limitations imposed on the engagements. Even so, its kill rate was only 13% in actual combat in 1972, leading to a practice of ripple-firing all four at once in hopes of increasing kill probability. Its worst tendency was that of detonating prematurely, approximately a thousand feet in front of the launching aircraft, but it also had many motor failures, erratic flights, and fusing problems. An E-3 version included additional changes to the fusing, and an E-4 featured a modified seeker for use with the [[F-14 Tomcat]].

Improved versions of the AIM-7 were developed in the 1970s in an attempt to address the weapon's limitations. The '''AIM-7F''', which entered service in [[1976 in aviation|1976]], had a dual-stage rocket motor for longer range, [[solid-state electronics]] for greatly improved reliability, and a larger warhead. Even this version had room for improvement, leading [[British Aerospace]] and the Italian firm [[Selenia]] to develop advanced versions of Sparrow with better performance and improved electronics as the '''[[Skyflash]]''' and '''Selenia Aspide''', respectively.

The most common version of the Sparrow today, the '''AIM-7M''', entered service in [[1982 in aviation|1982]] and featured a new inverse monopulse seeker (matching the capabilities of Skyflash), active radar fuse, digital controls, improved [[electronic countermeasures|ECM]] resistance, and better low-altitude performance. It was used to good advantage in the 1991 [[Gulf War]], where it scored many USAF air-to-air kills; however its kill probability, overall, is still less than 40%.

The '''AIM-7P''' is similar in most ways to the M versions, and was primarily an upgrade program for existing M-series missiles. The main changes were to the software, improving low-level performance. A follow-on Block II upgrade added a new rear receiver allowing the missile to receive mid-course correction from the launching aircraft. Plans initially called for all M versions to be upgraded, but currently P's are being issued as required to replace M's lost or removed from the inventory.

The final version of the missile was to have been the '''AIM-7R''', which added an [[infrared]] seeker to an otherwise unchanged AIM-7P Block II. A general wind-down of the budget led to it being cancelled in 1997. 

Sparrow is now being phased out with the availability of the active-radar [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]], but is likely to remain in service for a number of years.

==Foreign versions==
===Canada===
As part of the [[Avro Arrow]] program, Canadair partnered with Douglas in the development of the Sparrow II (AIM-7B).  After Douglas dropped out of this program, [[Canadair]] continued on with it until the termination of the Arrow.

===Italy===
{{Main|Selenia Aspide}}

The Italian company Finmeccanica, Alenia Difesa licensed the AIM-7E Sparrow technology from US, and produced its own improved version called '''Aspide'''.

===UK===
{{Main|Skyflash}}

[[British Aerospace]] (BAe) licensed the AIM-7E2 technology in the 1970s, producing the '''Skyflash''' missile. Skyflash used a Marconi XJ521 monopulse Semi-Active seeker together with improvements to the electronics. It was powered by the Aerojet Mk52 mod 2 rocket engine (later by the Rocketdyne Mk38 mod 4). Skyflash entered service with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) on their [[F-4 Phantom II|Phantom FG.1/FGR.2]] in 1976, and later on the [[Panavia Tornado ADV|Tornado F3]]. The Skyflash was also exported to [[Sweden]] for use on their [[Viggen]] fighters.

An upgraded version with active radar seeker, called '''Active Sky Flash''' was proposed by BAe and [[Thomson-CSF]], but did not receive funding because the RAF opted for other missiles.&lt;ref&gt;http://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/row/skyflash.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Republic of China===
{{Main|PL-10}}

The LY-60/FD-60/PL-10 is a family of PRC missiles developed by the Shanghai Academy of Science and Technology, largely based on the Italian Aspide missile - itself a version of the Sparrow. There are four versions of the basic design, three of which are surface-to-air and one air-to-air.

==Design==
The Sparrow has four major sections: guidance section, [[warhead]], control, and rocket motor (currently the Hercules MK-58 solid-propellant rocket motor). It has a cylindrical body with four wings at mid-body and four tail fins. Although the external dimensions of the Sparrow remained relatively unchanged from model to model, the internal components of newer missiles represent major improvements, with vastly increased capabilities. The warhead is of the [[continuous-rod warhead|continuous-rod]] type.

As with other semi-active radar guided missiles, the missile does not generate radar signals, but instead homes in on reflected continuous-wave signals from the launch platform's radar. The receiver also senses the guidance radar to enable comparisons that enhance the missile's resistance to passive jamming.

==Principle of guidance (semi-active version)==
The launching aircraft will illuminate the target with its radar. In radars of the 1950s these were single target tracking devices using a [[Nutation|nutating]] horn as part of its antenna. This caused the beam to be swept in a small cone. Signal processing would be applied to determine the direction of maximum illumination and so develop a signal to steer the antenna toward the target. The missile detects the reflected signal from the target with a high gain antenna in a similar fashion and steers the entire missile toward closure with the target. The missile guidance also samples a portion of the illuminating signal via rearward pointing [[waveguide]]s. The comparison of these two signals enabled logic circuits to determine the true target reflection signal, even if the target were to eject radar-reflecting [[chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]].

The '''AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile''', or '''AMRAAM''' (pronounced am-ram), is a modern [[Beyond-visual-range missile|beyond visual range (BVR)]] [[air-to-air missile|air-to-air]] [[missile]] (AAM) capable of all weather day and night performance. Designed with the same form-factor as the previous generation of semi-active guided Sparrow missiles, it is a fire-and-forget missile with active guidance.  It is also commonly known as the '''Slammer''' in USAF service.  When an AMRAAM missile is being launched, [[NATO]] pilots use the [[brevity code]] '''[[Fox (code word)|Fox Three]]'''.

==Origins==
===AIM-7 Sparrow MRM===
The [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] medium range missile (MRM) was purchased by the US Navy from original developer [[Howard Hughes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_Aircraft#Howard_Hughes_Medical_Institute_sells_Hughes_Aircraft_Company
|title=Howard Hughes Medical Institute sells Hughes Aircraft Company
|accessdate=2010-10-05}}
&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1950s as its first operational air-to-air missile with &quot;beyond visual range&quot; (BVR) capability. With an effective range of about {{convert|12|mi|km}}, it was introduced as a radar [[beam riding]] missile and then improved to a [[semi-active radar homing|semi-active radar guided]] missile which would home in on reflections from a target illuminated by the radar of the launching aircraft. It was effective at visual to beyond visual range. The early beam riding versions of the Sparrow missiles were integrated onto the [[F3H Demon]] and [[F7U Cutlass]], but the definitive AIM-7 Sparrow was the primary weapon for the all-weather [[F-4 Phantom II]] fighter/interceptor, which lacked an internal gun in the US Navy, USMC and early USAF versions.  The F-4 mounted up to four AIM-7s carried in special recesses under the fuselage. 

Although designed for non-maneuvering targets such as bombers, due to poor performance against fighters over North Vietnam, these missiles were progressively improved until they proved highly effective in dogfights.  Together with the short range infrared guided [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], they replaced the [[AIM-4 Falcon]] IR and radar guided series for use in air combat by the USAF as well.  A disadvantage to semi-active homing was that only one target could be illuminated by the launch aircraft at a time; also, the launch aircraft had to remain pointed in the direction of the target (within the azimuth of the aircraft radar, up to 60 degrees off the nose on some systems), which could be difficult or dangerous in aerial combat.

===AIM-54 Phoenix LRM===
The US Navy later developed the [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] long range missile (LRM) for the fleet air defense mission. It was a large {{convert|1000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}} Mach 4 missile designed to counter [[cruise missile]]s and the bombers that launched them. Originally intended for the straight-wing [[F6D Missileer]] and then the navalized version of the [[F-111B#F-111B|F-111B]] it finally saw service with the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]], the only fighter capable of carrying such a heavy missile.  Phoenix was the first US [[fire-and-forget]] multiple launch radar-guided missile: one which used its own active guidance system to guide itself without help from the launch aircraft when it closed on its target. This gave a Tomcat with a six Phoenix load the unprecedented capability of tracking and destroying up to six targets as far as {{convert|100|mi|km|-1}} away.

The Phoenix could only be carried by the F-14, making the Tomcat the only US fighter with a multiple shot, fire-and-forget radar missile targets for beyond visual range. A full load of six Phoenix missiles weighed {{convert|6000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}}, and with the additional {{convert|2000|lb|kg}} of dedicated launcher, it was so heavy it exceeded a typical Vietnam-era bomb load; typically only one, two or four missiles were flown off the carrier, as a full load was too heavy to be brought back on board for landing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Although highly lauded in the press, its operational service with the US Navy was primarily as a deterrent, as its use was hampered by restrictive [[Rules of Engagement]] in such conflicts as Operations [[Desert Storm]], [[Southern Watch]] and [[Iraqi Freedom]].  The only reported combat successes were with Iranian Tomcats against Iraqi opponents. The US Navy retired its Phoenix capability in 2005 in light of availability of the AIM-120 AMRAAM on the [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and the pending retirement of the F-14 Tomcat from active US Navy service in late 2006.

===ACEVAL/AIMVAL===
The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] conducted an extensive evaluation of air combat tactics and missile technology from 1974-78 at [[Nellis AFB]] using the F-14 Tomcat and F-15 Eagle equipped with Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles as blue force and Aggressor F-5E aircraft equipped with [[AIM-9L]] [[all-aspect]] Sidewinders as the Red force. This [[Joint Test and Evaluaton]] (JT&amp;E) was designated [[ACEVAL/AIMVAL|Air Combat Evaluation / Air Intercept Missile Evaluation]] (ACEVAL/AIMVAL).{{citation needed|date=July 2010|reason=Dead link removed}} A principal finding was the necessity to produce illumination for the Sparrow until impact resulted in the Red Force being able to launch their all-aspect Sidewinders before impact thereby resulting in mutual kills. What was needed was Phoenix type multiple launch and terminal active capability in a Sparrow size airframe. This led to a [[Memorandum of Agreement]] (MOA) with European allies (principally the UK and Germany for development) for the US to develop an Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) with the USAF as lead service. The MOA also assigned responsibility for development of an Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile to the European team.

===Requirements===
[[File:CATM 120C AMRAAM p1230119.jpg|thumb|Surface-to-air mounting (shown: CATM-120C captive training variant)]]

By the 1990s, the reliability of the Sparrow had improved so much from the dismal days of Vietnam that it accounted for the largest number of aerial targets destroyed in [[Gulf War|Desert Storm]]. But while the USAF had passed on the Phoenix and their own similar [[AIM-47]]/[[YF-12]] to optimize dogfight performance, they still desired the Navy's multiple launch fire and forget capability for the F-15 and F-16. AMRAAM would need to be fitted on fighters as small as the F-16, and fit in the same spaces that were designed to fit the Sparrow since the Phantom. The European partners needed AMRAAM to be integrated on aircraft as small as the Sea Harrier. The US Navy needed AMRAAM to be carried on the F/A-18 Hornet and wanted capability for two to be carried on a launcher that normally carried one Sparrow to allow for more air-to-ground weapons.

AMRAAM would eventually be the primary weapon for the [[F-22 Raptor]] which needed to fit all its missiles in internal weapons bays like the old [[F-106 Delta Dart]]s in order to maintain a stealthy [[radar cross-section]]. The US Navy ultimately decided to retire its F-14 Tomcats and pass the Fleet Air Defense mission to the F/A-18C Hornets and F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, which needed even more advanced versions of AMRAAM to replace the Phoenix capability.

==Development==
AMRAAM was developed as the result of an agreement (the [[Family of Weapons]] MOA, no longer in effect by 1990), among the United States and several other [[NATO]] nations to develop air-to-air missiles and to share production technology.  Under this agreement the U.S. was to develop the next generation medium range missile (AMRAAM) and Europe would develop the next generation short range missile ([[ASRAAM]]). When the German ASRAAM seeker development ran into problems, the MOA was abrogated and this breakdown led to the U.S. developing [[AIM-9X Sidewinder]] and Germany the [[IRIS-T]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Although Europe initially adopted AMRAAM, an effort to develop the [[MBDA Meteor]], a competitor to AMRAAM, was begun. Eventually ASRAAM was developed solely by the UK with another source for its seeker. After protracted development, deployment of AMRAAM (AIM-120A) began in September 1991 with USAF F-15 Eagle squadrons. The US Navy followed suit in 1993 with the F/A-18C.

The eastern counterpart of AMRAAM is the very similar [[Russian Air Force|Russian]] [[Vympel R-77|AA-12 Adder]], commonly known in the west as &quot;AMRAAMski.&quot; Likewise, France began its own missile development with the [[MBDA MICA|MICA]] concept that used the same airframe for separate radar and IR guidance versions.

==Operational features summary==
AMRAAM has an all-weather, beyond-visual-range (BVR) capability. It improves the aerial combat capabilities of U.S. and allied aircraft to meet the future threat of enemy air-to-air weapons. AMRAAM serves as a follow-on to the AIM-7 Sparrow missile series. The new missile is faster, smaller, and lighter, and has improved capabilities against low-altitude targets. It also incorporates a datalink to guide the missile to a point where its active radar turns on and makes terminal intercept of the target. An inertial reference unit and micro-computer system makes the missile less dependent upon the fire-control system of the aircraft.

Once the missile closes in on the target, its [[active radar]] guides it to intercept. This feature, known as &quot;fire-and-forget&quot;, frees the aircrew from the need to further provide guidance, enabling the aircrew to aim and fire several missiles simultaneously at multiple targets and perform evasive maneuvers while the missiles guide themselves to the targets.

The missile also features the ability to &quot;Home on Jamming,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/aim-120.htm FAS Military Analysis Network: AIM-120 AMRAAM Slammer (Date: 14 April 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; giving it the ability to switch over from active radar homing to passive homing - homing on jamming signals from the target aircraft. Software on board the missile allows it to detect if it is being jammed, and guide on its target using the proper guidance system.

==Guidance system overview==
===Interception course stage===
[[File:F-14 carrying AMRAAM.jpg|thumb|[[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]] carrying an AMRAAM during a 1982 test]]

AMRAAM uses two-stage [[missile guidance|guidance]] when fired at long range. The aircraft passes data to the missile just before launch, giving it information about the location of the target aircraft from the launch point and its direction and speed. The missile uses this information to fly on an interception course to the target using its built in [[inertial navigation system]] (INS). This information is generally obtained using the launching aircraft's radar, although it could come from an [[infrared]] search and tracking system ([[IRST]]), from a [[Joint Tactical Information Distribution System|data link]] from another fighter aircraft, or from an [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]] aircraft. 

After launch, If the firing aircraft or surrogate continues to track the target, periodic updates—such as changes in the target's direction and speed—are sent from the launch aircraft to the missile, allowing the missile to adjust its course so that it is able to close to a self-homing distance where it will be close enough to &quot;catch&quot; the target aircraft in the ''basket'' (the missile's radar field of view in which it will be able to lock onto the target aircraft, unassisted by the launch aircraft).

Not all armed services using the AMRAAM have elected to purchase the mid-course update option, which limits AMRAAM's effectiveness in some scenarios. The [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] initially opted not to use mid-course update for its [[Panavia Tornado ADV|Tornado F3]] force, only to discover that without it, testing proved the AMRAAM was less effective in BVR engagements than the older [[semi-active radar homing]] [[Skyflash|BAE Skyflash]] weapon—the AIM-120's own radar is necessarily of limited range and power compared to that of the launch aircraft.

===Terminal stage and impact===
Once the missile closes to self-homing distance, it turns on its active radar seeker and searches for the target aircraft. If the target is in or near the expected location, the missile will find it and guide itself to the target from this point. At the point where an AMRAAM switches to autonomous self-guidance, the NATO [[brevity code]] &quot;Pitbull&quot; would be called out on the radio, just as &quot;Fox Three&quot; would be called out upon launch.

If the missile is fired at short range (typically visual range), it can use its active seeker just after launch, making the missile truly &quot;fire and forget&quot;.  The NATO brevity code &quot;Maddog&quot; is used in this situation.

==Kill probability and tactics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}

===General considerations===
Once in its terminal mode, the missile's advanced electronic counter countermeasures ([[ECCM]]) support and good maneuverability mean that the chance of it hitting or exploding close to the target is high (on the order of 90%{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}), as long as it has enough remaining energy to maneuver with the target if it is evasive. The [[probability of kill|kill probability]] (P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;) is determined by several factors, including aspect (head-on interception, side-on or tail-chase), altitude, the speed of the missile and the target, and how hard the target can turn. Typically, if the missile has sufficient energy during the terminal phase, which comes from being launched close enough to the target from an aircraft flying high and fast enough, it will have an excellent chance of success. This chance drops as the missile is fired at longer ranges as it runs out of overtake speed at long ranges, and if the target can force the missile to turn it might bleed off enough speed that it can no longer chase the target.

===Lower-capability targets===
This leads to two main engagement scenarios. If the target is not armed with any medium or long-range fire-and-forget weapons, the attacking aircraft need only get close enough to the target and launch the AMRAAM. In these scenarios, the AMRAAM has a high chance of hitting, especially against low-maneuverability targets. The launch distance depends upon whether the target is heading towards or away from the firing aircraft. In a head-on engagement, the missile can be launched at longer range, since the range will be closing fast. In this situation, even if the target turns around, it is unlikely it can speed up and fly away fast enough to avoid being overtaken and hit by the missile (as long as the missile is not released too early). It is also unlikely the enemy can outmaneuver the missile since the closure rate will be so great. In a tail-on engagement, the firing aircraft might have to close to between one-half and one-quarter maximum range (or maybe even closer for a very fast target) in order to give the missile sufficient energy to overtake the targets.

If the targets are armed with missiles, the fire-and-forget nature of the AMRAAM is valuable, enabling the launching aircraft to fire missiles at the target and subsequently take defensive actions. Even if the targets have longer-range [[semi-active radar homing]] ([[SARH]]) missiles, they will have to chase the launching aircraft in order for the missiles to track them, effectively flying right into the AMRAAM. If the target aircraft fires missiles and then turn and runs away, their own missiles will not be able to hit. Of course, if the target aircraft have long range missiles, even if they are not fire-and-forget, the fact that they force the launching aircraft to turn and run reduces the kill probability, since it is possible that without the mid-course updates the missiles will not find the target aircraft. However the chance of success is still good and compared to the relative impunity the launching aircraft enjoy, this gives the AMRAAM-equipped aircraft a decisive edge. If one or more missiles fail to hit, the AMRAAM-equipped aircraft can turn and re-engage, although they will be at a disadvantage compared to the chasing aircraft due to the speed they lose in the turn, and would have to be careful that they are not being tracked with [[SARH]] missiles.

===Similarly armed targets===
The other main engagement scenario is against other aircraft with fire-and-forget missiles like the [[Vympel R-77]] (NATO AA-12 &quot;Adder&quot;) — perhaps [[MiG-29]]s, [[Su-27]]s or similar. In this case engagement is very much down to teamwork and could be described as &quot;a game of chicken.&quot; Both flights of aircraft can fire their missiles at each other beyond visual range (BVR), but then face the problem that if they continue to track the target aircraft in order to provide mid-course updates for the missile's flight, they are also flying into their opponents' missiles. Although in this regard the [[R-77|RVV-AE]] (which is the missile's export name or [[R-77]] the official Russian Air force designation) does have an advantage as it has a greater range than the AMRAAM (when the AIM-120D is deployed the AMRAAM will have 30+ miles more range than the standard R-77{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} but much less than the ramjet powered R-77M and the Meteor missiles which will also enter service along with AIM-120D). This assumes of course that all aircraft will detect each other, however American fighters enjoy considerable current and future advantages in stealth, electronic warfare and offboard sensor support.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Variants and upgrades==
[[File:Aim 120 amraam missile 20040710 145603 1.4.jpg|thumb|An AIM-120 AMRAAM missile on display at the U.S. National Air and Space Museum]]

===Air-to-air missile versions===
There are currently three variants of AMRAAM, all in service with the [[United States Air Force]], [[USN]], and the United States Marine Corps. The AIM-120A is no longer in production and shares the enlarged wings and fins with the successor AIM-120B. The AIM-120C has smaller &quot;clipped&quot; aerosurfaces to enable internal carriage on the USAF [[F-22 Raptor]]. AIM-120B deliveries began in 1994, and AIM-120C deliveries began in 1996. 

The AIM-120C has been steadily upgraded since it was introduced. The AIM-120C-6 contained an improved fuse (Target Detection Device) compared to its predecessor. The AIM-120C-7 development began in 1998 and included improvements in homing and greater range (actual amount of improvement unspecified). It was successfully tested in 2003 and is currently being produced for both domestic and foreign customers. It helped the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] replace the [[F-14 Tomcat]]s with [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]s&amp;nbsp;– the loss of the F-14's long-range [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] missiles (already retired) can be partially offset with a longer-range AMRAAM, but note that the AMRAAM does not have the long range capability of the Phoenix missile. 

The AIM-120D is an upgraded version of the AMRAAM with improvements in almost all areas, including 50% greater range (than the already-extended range AIM-120C-7) and better guidance over its entire flight envelope yielding an improved kill probability ([[Probability of kill|PK]]). Raytheon recently began testing the D model; on August 5, 2008, the company reported that an AIM-120D launched from an [[F/A-18F Super Hornet]] passed within lethal distance of a QF-4 target drone at the [[White Sands Missile Range]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/micro_stories.pl?ACCT=149999&amp;TICK=RTN&amp;STORY=/www/story/08-05-2008/0004861926&amp;EDATE=Aug+5,+2008 Raytheon Press Release, August 5, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also plans for [[Raytheon]] to develop a [[ramjet]]-powered derivative of the AMRAAM, the Future Medium Range Air-Air Missile (FMRAAM). It is not known whether the FMRAAM will be produced since the target market, the British Ministry of Defence, has chosen the [[MBDA Meteor|Meteor missile]] over the FMRAAM for a [[BVR]] missile for the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] aircraft.

Raytheon is also working with the [[Missile Defense Agency]] to develop the [[Network Centric Airborne Defense Element]] (NCADE), an anti-ballistic missile derived from the AIM-120. This weapon will be equipped with a Ramjet engine and an IR seeker derived from the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|Sidewinder]] missile. In place of a proximity-fused warhead, the NCADE will use a kinetic energy hit-to-kill vehicle based on the one used in the Navy's [[RIM-161 Standard Missile 3]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/ncade-an-abm-amraam-03305/ Defense Industry Daily report, November 20, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

AMRAAM will continue to serve in the arsenal of the [[USAF]], the [[U.S. Navy]], and the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] until at least 2020 when the Joint Dual Role Air Dominance Missile ([[JDRADM]]) would potentially enter service.  The -120A and -120B models are currently nearing the end of their service life while the -120D variant has just entered full production.

===Ground-launched systems===
[[File:AIM-120 AMRAAM P6230147.JPG|thumb|Battery of four SL-AMRAAM on HMMWV]]

[[Raytheon]] successfully tested launching AMRAAM missiles from a five-missile carrier on a M1097 [[Humvee]].  This system will be known as the '''SLAMRAAM''' (Surface Launched (SL) and AMRAAM).  They receive their initial guidance information from a radar not mounted on the vehicle.  Since the missile is launched without the benefit of an aircraft's speed or high altitude, its range is considerably shorter. Raytheon is currently marketing an SL-AMRAAM EX, purported to be an extended range AMRAAM and bearing a resemblance to the ESSM ([[Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile]]).

The [[NASAMS|Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System]] (NASAMS), developed by [[Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace]], consists of a number of vehicle-pulled launch batteries (containing six AMRAAMs each) along with separate radar trucks and control station vehicles.

While still under evaluation for replacement of current US Army assets, the SL-AMRAAM has been deployed in several nations military forces, including Egypt.  The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has requested the purchasing of SL-AMRAAM as part of a larger 7 billion dollar foreign military sales package.  The sale would include 288 AMRAAM C-7 missiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=defense&amp;id=news/DSCA091108.xml&amp;headline=DSCA%20Announces%20Billions%20In%20Military%20Sales Aviation Week: DSCA Announces Billions In Military Sales]&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Army has test fired the SL-AMRAAM from a [[HIMARS]] artillery rocket launcher as a common launcher, as part of a move to switch to a larger and more survivable launch platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2009/MFC_032509_LockheedMartinsHIMARSLauncher.html HIMARS Launcher Successfully Fires Air Defense Missile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2010/09/10/Raytheon-Army-test-new-SLAMRAAM-platform/UPI-16391284134034/ Raytheon, Army test new SLAMRAAM platform]&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Guard Association of the United States has sent a letter asking for the United States Senate to stop the Army's plan to drop the SLAMRAAM program because without it there would be no path to modernize the Guard's [[AN/TWQ-1 Avenger]] Battalions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=4847002&amp;c=AME&amp;s=LAN U.S. Army Recommends SLAMRAAM Termination]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2011, Secretary of Defense [[Robert M. Gates]] announced that the U.S. Army has decided to terminate acquisition of the SLAMRAAM as part of a budget-cutting effort.&lt;ref&gt;http://richmedia.onset.freedom.com/nwfdn/lemv4s-7jsfgatestranscripts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
The AMRAAM was used for the first time on 27 December 1992, when a USAF [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16D]] shot down an [[Iraq]]i [[MiG-25]] that violated the southern no-fly-zone. Interestingly enough, this missile was returned from the flight line as defective a day earlier. AMRAAM gained a second victory in January 1993 when an Iraqi [[MiG-23]] was shot down by a USAF [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16C]]. 

The third combat use of the AMRAAM was in 1994, when a [[Republika Srpska Air Force]] [[Soko J-21 Jastreb|J-21 Jastreb]] aircraft was shot down by a USAF [[F-16|F-16C]] that was patrolling the UN-imposed no-fly-zone over [[Bosnia]]. In that engagement at least 3 other Serbian aircraft were shot down by USAF F-16C fighters using [[AIM-9]] missiles (see [[Banja Luka incident]] for more details). At that point three launches in combat resulted in three kills, resulting in the AMRAAM being informally named &quot;slammer&quot; in the second half of the 1990s. 

In 1998 and 1999 AMRAAMs were again fired by USAF [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]] fighters at [[Iraq]]i aircraft violating the No-Fly-Zone, but this time they failed to hit their targets. During the spring of 1999, AMRAAMs saw their main combat action during [[Operation Allied Force]], the [[Kosovo]] [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|bombing campaign]]. Six Serbian MiG-29 were shot down by NATO (4 USAF F-15C, 1 USAF F-16C, 1 Dutch F-16A MLU), all of them using AIM-120 missiles (the kill by the F-16C may have happened due to friendly fire, from [[SA-7 MANPAD]] fired by Serbian infantry).&lt;ref name=&quot;ausairpower.net&quot;&gt;[http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-Rus-BVR-AAM.html Air Power Australia: Technical Report APA-TR-2008-0301]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of mid 2008, the AIM-120 AMRAAM has shot down nine enemy aircraft (six [[MiG-29]], one [[MiG-25]], one [[MiG-23]], and one [[Soko J-21 Jastreb]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ausairpower.net&quot;/&gt;

The AMRAAM was also involved in a friendly-fire incident in 1994 when [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]] fighters patrolling the Southern No-Fly Zone [[1994 Black Hawk shootdown incident|inadvertently shot down]] a pair of [[U.S. Army]] [[UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]] helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/15/world/us-jets-over-iraq-attack-own-helicopters-in-error-all-26-on-board-are-killed.html |title=U.S. JETS OVER IRAQ ATTACK OWN HELICOPTERS IN ERROR; ALL 26 ON BOARD ARE KILLED |last=R.

An AIM-120C missile is clearly visible on the wreckage of the F15E which crashed due to mechanical failure near Benghazi on 22 March 2011 during [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]], the initial stage of the creation of the no-fly zone over Libya during the [[2011 Libyan uprising]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12816226&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign Sales==

In 2005, [[Chile]] received AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles from the [[United States Air Force]] as part of the Peace Puma Plan which [[Chilean Air Force]] also received 10 [[F-16|F-16D]] fighters as part of the plan. In 2009, Chile ordered another 100 AIM-120 C7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dsca.mil/PressReleases/36-b/2009/Chile_09-62.pdf |title=Chile – AIM-120C-7 AMRAAM Missiles |date=12 November 2009 |publisher=Defense Security Cooperation Agency |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 [[Poland]] received AIM-120C-5 missiles to arm its new [[F-16|F-16C/D Block 52+]] fighters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In early 2006 the [[Pakistan Air Force|Pakistan Air Force (PAF)]] ordered 500 AIM-120C-5 AMRAAM missiles as part of a $650 million F-16 ammunition deal to equip the PAF's [[F-16|F-16C/D Block 52+]] and [[F-16|F-16A/B MLU]] fighters. 

[[Pakistan Air Force]] get the first 3 F-16 Block 52+ on 3 July 2010 and 1st batch of AMRAAMs on 26 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/micro_stories.pl?ACCT=149999&amp;TICK=RTN&amp;STORY=/www/story/01-15-2007/0004505958&amp;EDATE=Jan+15,+2007 Raytheon Press Release, January 15, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the United States government agreed to sell 218 AIM-120C-7 missiles to Taiwan as part of a large arms sales package that also included 235 AGM-65G-2 Maverick missiles. Total value of the package, including launchers, maintenance, spare parts, support and training rounds, was estimated at around $421 million USD. This supplemented an earlier Taiwanese purchase of 120 AIM-120C-5 missiles a few years ago.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

2008 has brought announcements of new or additional sales to Singapore, Finland, Morocco and South Korea; in December 2010 the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] government requested 150 missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defpro.com/news/details/20859/|accessdate=2010-12-27|title=defence.professionals | defpro.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''AGM-88 High-speed [[Anti-radiation missile|Anti-Radiation Missile]]''' ('''HARM''') is a tactical, air-to-surface [[missile]] designed to home in on electronic transmissions coming from surface-to-air [[radar]] systems. It was originally developed by [[Texas Instruments]] (TI) as a replacement for the [[AGM-45 Shrike]] and [[AGM-78 Standard ARM]] system. Production was later taken over by [[Raytheon Corporation]] (RAYCO) when they purchased TI's defense business.

==Operation==
The AGM-88 can detect, attack and destroy a radar antenna or transmitter with minimal aircrew input. The proportional guidance system that homes in on enemy radar emissions has a fixed antenna and seeker head in the missile's nose. A smokeless, solid-propellant, [[dual-thrust]] [[rocket motor]] propels the missile at speeds over [[Mach number|Mach]] 2. HARM, a Navy-led program, was initially integrated onto the [[A-6 Intruder|A-6E]], [[A-7 Corsair II|A-7]] and [[F/A-18]] and later onto the [[EA-6B]]. RDT&amp;E for use on the F-14 was begun, but not completed. The Air Force introduced HARM on the [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4G]] [[Wild Weasel]] and later on specialized [[F-16]]s equipped with the [[HARM Targeting System]] (HTS).

==Deployment==
The HARM missile was approved for full production in March 1983 and deployed in late 1985 with [[VA-72]] and [[VA-46]] aboard the aircraft carrier [[USS America]]. It was soon used in combat; in March 1986 against a [[Libya]]n [[S-200 Angara/Vega/Dubna|SA-5]] site in the [[Gulf of Sidra]], and then [[Operation Eldorado Canyon]] in April. HARM was used extensively by the [[United States Navy]] and the [[United States Air Force]] for Operation Desert Storm during the [[Gulf War]] of 1991.

&quot;Magnum&quot; is spoken over the radio to announce the launch of an AGM-88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/usaf/docs/mcm3-1-a1.htm |title=Operational Brevity Words And Terminology |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Gulf War, if an aircraft was illuminated by enemy radar a bogus &quot;Magnum&quot; call on the radio was often enough to convince the operators to power down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lambeth | first = Benjamin | title = The Transformation of American Air Power | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-8014-3816-5 |page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This technique would also be employed in Serbia during air operations in 1999.

==Variants==
[[Image:AGM-88E HARM p1230047.jpg|left|thumb|AGM-88E.]]
The newest upgrade is a joint venture by the Italian Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense: the '''AGM-88E Advanced Anti Radiation Guided Missile''' ('''AARGM'''), produced by [[Alliant Techsystems]].

The AARGM will feature the latest software, enhanced capabilities intended to counter radar shutdown, passive radar and active millimeter wave seekers. It will be released in November 2010.

It will be initially integrated onto the FA-18C/D, FA-18E/F, EA-18G and Tornado ECR aircraft and later on the [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS152956+21-Jan-2009+PRN20090121 |title=ATK Awarded $55 Million Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile Low Rate Initial Production... |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2010-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gulf War friendly fire incident==
During the [[Gulf War]], the HARM was involved in a friendly fire incident when the pilot of an [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4G]] Wild Weasel escorting a [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] mistook the latter's tail gun radar for an Iraqi [[antiaircraft artillery|AAA]] site. (This was after the tail gunner of the B-52 had targeted the F-4G, mistaking it for an Iraqi [[MiG]]). The pilot launched the missile and then saw that the target was the B-52, which was hit. It survived with shrapnel damage to the tail. The B-52 was subsequently renamed &quot;In HARM’s Way&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steeljawscribe.com/2007/09/20/flightdeck-friday-project-valour-it The B-52 Stratofortress : steeljawscribe blog]{{Self-published inline|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:A-10 firing AGM-65.JPEG|thumb|[[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] firing off an AGM-65.]]
The '''AGM-65 Maverick''' is an [[air-to-ground missile|air-to-ground tactical missile]] (AGM) designed for close air support. It is effective against a wide range of [[Military tactic|tactical]] targets, including [[armor]], air defenses, [[ship]]s, ground transportation and fuel storage facilities.

Different models of the AGM-65 have used electro-optical, laser, and infra-red guidance systems. The AGM-65 has two types of [[warhead]]s: one has a contact [[fuze]] in the nose, the other has a heavyweight warhead fitted with a delayed-action fuze, which penetrates the target with its [[kinetic energy]] before detonating. The latter is most effective against large, hard targets. The propulsion system for both types is a [[solid-fuel rocket]] motor behind the warhead.

The Maverick missile is unable to lock onto targets on its own; it has to be given input by the pilot or [[Weapon Systems Officer]] (WSO). In an [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]], for example, the video feed from the seeker head is relayed to a screen in the cockpit, where the pilot can check the locked target of the missile before launch. A crosshair on the [[head-up display]] (HUD) is shifted by the pilot to set the approximate target while the missile will then automatically recognize and lock on to the target. Once the missile is launched, it requires no further assistance from the launch vehicle and tracks its target automatically. This makes it a [[fire-and-forget]] weapon.&lt;ref name=ds /&gt;

==Variants==
*'''Maverick A''' is the basic model and uses an electro-optical television guidance system.
*'''Maverick B''' is similar to the A model, although the B model added optical zooming to lock onto small or distant targets.
*'''Maverick C''' was to be a laser-guided variant for the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC). It was canceled before production, however its requirement was later met by the Maverick E.
*'''Maverick D''' replaced the electro-optical guidance with an [[imaging infrared]] system which doubled practical firing distance and allowed for use at night and during bad weather. A reduced smoke rocket engine was also introduced in this model. Achieved initial operation capability in 1983.
*'''Maverick E''' uses a laser designator guidance system optimized for fortified installations and heavier penetrating  blast-fragmentation warhead ({{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=off|disp=s}} vs. {{convert|125|lb|kg|abbr=off|disp=s}} in older models). Achieved IOC in 1985 and used mainly by USMC aviation.
*'''Maverick F''', designed specially for [[US Navy]], uses a modified Maverick D infrared guidance system optimized for tracking ships fitted onto Maverick-E body and warhead.
*'''Maverick G''' model essentially has the same guidance system as the D with some software modification that enables the pilot to track larger targets. The G model's major difference is its heavier penetrator warhead taken from Maverick E, compared to the D model's [[shaped charge|shaped-charge warhead]]. Completed tests in 1988.
*'''Maverick H''' model is an AGM-65B/D missile upgraded with a new [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) seeker better suited for desert environment.
*'''Maverick J''' model is a Navy AGM-65F missile upgraded with the new CCD seeker. However this conversion is not confirmed.
*'''Maverick K''' model is an AGM-65G upgraded with the CCD seeker, at least 1200, but possibly up to 2500, AGM-65G rounds are planned for conversion to AGM-65K standard.&lt;ref name=ds /&gt;

AGM-65 missiles were employed by [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]s and [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]]s during Operation [[Gulf War|Desert Storm]] in 1991 to attack armored targets. Mavericks played an important part in the destruction of [[Iraq]]'s military force. 

1st time that these missiles have ever been fired on a hostile vessel by a [[P-3 Orion]]:
U.S. Navy and coalition units came to aid of the Libyan people to engage Libyan Coast Guard vessel Vittoria in the port of Misrata, Libya, during the late evening of March 28.
Vittoria was engaged and fired upon by a U.S. Navy P-3C Maritime Patrol aircraft with AGM-65 Maverick missiles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eucom.mil/english/fullstory.asp?article=Navy-Firsts-Odyssey-Dawn&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''AIM-54 Phoenix''' is a radar-guided, long-range [[air-to-air missile|air-to-air]] [[missile]], carried in clusters of up to six missiles on [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14 Tomcats]], the only aircraft capable of launching it. The Phoenix was the [[United States]]' only long-range air-to-air missile. The weapons system based on Phoenix was the world's first to allow simultaneous guidance of missiles against multiple targets.

Both the missile and the aircraft was used by the [[United States Navy]] and are now retired, the AIM-54 Phoenix in 2004 and the F-14 in 2006. They were replaced by shorter-range [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]]s, employed on the [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]].

The weapon is currently used only by the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]].

==Background==
Since 1951, the Navy faced the initial threat from the [[Tupolev Tu-4|Tupolev Tu-4K 'Bull']] carrying&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=kGyc0NZEe_QC&amp;lpg=PT41&amp;dq=%22Tu-4K%22&amp;pg=PT41#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tu-4K%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; [[anti-ship missile]]s. Eventually, during the height of the Cold War, the threat would have actually expanded into regimental-size raids of [[Tu-16 Badger]] and [[Tu-22M Backfire]] bombers equipped with low-flying, long-range, high-speed, nuclear-armed cruise missiles and considerable [[Electronic Counter Measures]] (ECM) of various types.

The Navy sought for a long-range, long-endurance, little-maneuvering [[interceptor aircraft]] to defend [[carrier battle group]]s against the threat. Example of such was the projected [[F6D Missileer]]. The weapon needed for interceptor aircraft, the Bendix [[AAM-N-10 Eagle]], would be an air-to-air missile of the unprecedented range, comparing to contemporary [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] missiles. It would work together with [[Westinghouse AN/APQ-81]] radar.

==Development==
[[File:AIM-54A first test A-3A NAN11-66.jpg|thumb|left|An AIM-54A launched from the [[A-3 Skywarrior|NA-3A]]-testbed in 1966]]
The Missileer project was cancelled in December 1960, but in the early 1960s Navy made the next interceptor attempt with the [[General Dynamics/Grumman F-111B|F-111B]], and they needed a new missile design.

At the same time, [[USAF]] canceled the projects for their land-based high-speed interceptor aircraft, which left the capable [[AIM-47 Falcon]] missile at a quite advanced stage of development.

The AIM-54 Phoenix, developed for F-111B fleet air defense fighter, had an airframe with 4 cruciform fins that was a scaled-up version of the AIM-47.
One characteristic of the Missileer ancestry was that the radar sent it mid-course corrections, which allowed the fire control system to &quot;loft&quot; the missile up over the target into thinner air where it had better range.

The F-111B was canceled in 1968. Its weapons system, the AIM-54 working with the [[AWG-9 radar]], migrated to the new U.S. Navy fighter project, the VFX, which would became the F-14 Tomcat.

Later,{{clarify|date=March 2011}} the upgraded Phoenix, the AIM-54C, was developed to better counter projected threats from tactical anti-naval aircraft and cruise missiles, and its final upgrade included a re-programmable memory capability to keep pace with emerging ECM.

In contrast to the Navy, the USAF adopted neither the AIM-47 nor the AIM-54 operationally. Their [[F-15 Eagle]] had no similar capability—even the latest [[AIM-120 AMRAAM|AIM-120C-7 AMRAAM]] has a significantly lower range of {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=off|lk=off}}.

==Usage in comparison to other weapon systems==
The AIM-54/AWG-9 combination was the first to have multiple track capability (up to 24 targets) and launch (up to 6 Phoenixes can be launched nearly simultaneously); the large {{convert|1000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}} missile is equipped with a conventional warhead. The AWG-9 radar system carried by the F-111B and F-14 Tomcat was one of largest and most powerful ever fitted to a fighter.

On the F-14, the 4 missiles can be carried under the fuselage tunnel attached to special aerodynamic pallets, plus 2 under glove stations. A full load of 6 Phoenix missiles and the unique launch rails weigh in at over {{convert|8000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}}, about twice the weight of Sparrows, so it was more common to carry a mixed load of 4 Phoenix, 2 Sparrow and 2 Sidewinder missiles.

Before the introduction of the Phoenix missile, most other U.S. aircraft relied on the smaller, less-expensive [[AIM-7 Sparrow]]; classified as a Medium Range Missile (MRM). Guidance for the Sparrow required that the launching aircraft use its radar to continuously illuminate a single target for the missile's &quot;passive&quot; seeker to track, or guidance would be lost. This method meant the aircraft no longer had a search capability while supporting the launched Sparrow, effectively reducing situational awareness.

The Tomcat's [[AN/AWG-9|AWG-9]] radar was capable of tracking up to 24 targets in [[Track-While-Scan]] mode, with the AWG-9 selecting up to six priority targets for potential launch by the AIM-54. The pilot or [[Radar Intercept Officer]] (RIO) could then launch the AIM-54 Phoenix missiles when launch parameters were met. The large Tactical Information Display (TID) in the RIO's cockpit gave an unprecedented amount of information to the aircrew (the pilot had the ability to monitor the RIO's display) and, importantly, the AWG-9 could continually search and track multiple targets after Phoenix missiles were launched, thereby maintaining [[situational awareness]] of the battlespace.

Link-4 datalink capability allowed U.S. Navy Tomcats to share information with the [[E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C Hawkeye]] [[airborne early warning|AEW]] aircraft, and during [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Desert Shield]] in 1990, the Link-4A was introduced and allowed the Tomcats to have a fighter-to-fighter datalink capability, further enhancing overall situational awareness. The F-14D entered service with the JTIDS that brought the even better Link-16 datalink &quot;picture&quot; to the cockpit.

===Active guidance===
[[File:F-14A VF-1 launching AIM-54 Phoenix.JPEG|thumb|AIM-54 Phoenix seconds after launch (1991)]]
The Phoenix has several guidance modes and achieves its longest range by using mid-course updates from the F-14A/B AWG-9 radar (APG-71 radar in the F-14D) as it climbs to cruise between {{convert|80000|ft|m|-3|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100000|ft|m|-4|abbr=on}} at close to Mach 5. Phoenix uses its high altitude to gain gravitational potential energy, which is later converted into kinetic energy as the missile dives at high velocity towards its target. At around 11 miles from the target, the missile activates its own radar to provide terminal guidance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Directory&quot;&gt;[http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-54.html &quot;AIM-54&quot;]. (2004) Directory of U.S. Military Rockets and Missiles. Retrieved 28 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Minimum engagement range for the Phoenix is around 2 nautical miles; active homing would initiate upon launch at this distance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Directory&quot;/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:AIM-54 Phoenix cropped.jpg|thumb|left|An AIM-54 Phoenix being attached to an F-14 wing pylon. Note the forward wings have not been installed yet (2003)]]
The AIM-54 Phoenix was retired from USN service on September 30, 2004. F-14 Tomcats were retired on September 22, 2006. They were replaced by shorter-range [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]]s, employed on the [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]. Both the F-14 Tomcat and AIM-54 Phoenix missile continue in the service of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]], although the operational abilities of these aircraft and the missiles are questionable, since the United States refused to supply spare parts and maintenance after the 1979 revolution; except for a brief period during the [[Iran-Contra Affair]].

Despite the much-vaunted capabilities, the Phoenix was rarely used in combat, with only two confirmed launches and no confirmed targets destroyed in U.S. Navy service, though a large number of kills were claimed by Iranian F-14s during the [[Iran–Iraq War]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The USAF [[F-15 Eagle]] had responsibility for overland [[Combat Air Patrol]] (CAP) duties in [[Desert Storm]] in 1991, primarily because of the onboard F-15 [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] capabilities; the Tomcat did not have the requisite IFF capability mandated by the [[JFACC]] to satisfy the Rules of Engagement (ROE) in order to utilize the Phoenix capability at [[Beyond Visual Range]] (BVR). From an engineering and service standpoint, the Phoenix could be said to be a notable success. However, as the only surviving member of the Falcon missile family, it was not adopted by any other nation (besides [[Iran]]), any other U.S. armed service, or even supported by any other aircraft. It was heavy, large, expensive and not practical in close combat compared to the Sparrow or AMRAAM.

==Variants==
[[File:Phoenix missile at Grumman Memorial Park.jpg|thumb|An AIM-54A &quot;Phoenix&quot; missile on display at [[Grumman Memorial Park]] in New York.]]

;AIM-54A: The original version to become operational in 1974, also exported to Iran.

;AIM-54C: Improved version utilizing digital electronics, better able to counter [[cruise missile]]s. Superseded the AIM-54A from 1986.

;AIM-54 ECCM/[[Sealed round|Sealed]]: Further improved electronic counter-countermeasure capabilities, does not require coolant conditioning during captive flight. Used from 1988 onwards.

:Because the AIM-54 ECCM/Sealed receives no coolant, [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|Tomcats]] carrying this version of the missile may not exceed a certain airspeed.

There were also test, evaluation, ground training and captive air training versions of the missile; designated ATM-54, AEM-54, DATM-54A, and CATM-54. The flight versions had A and C versions. The DATM-54 was not made in a C version as there was no change in the ground handling characteristics.

==Iranian combat experiences with the AIM-54 Phoenix==
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2010}}
[[File:US F-14 painted like an Iranian fighter.jpg|thumb|An F-14A Tomcat fighter aircraft from the U.S. Navy &quot;Top Gun&quot; Fighter Weapons School, San Diego, painted like an Iranian fighter for [[Aggressor squadron|adversary training]].]]
There is very little information available regarding Iran's use of its 79 F-14A Tomcats (delivered prior to 1979) in most [[Western world|western]] outlets; the exception being a book released by [[Osprey Publishing]] titled ''&quot;Iranian F-14 Tomcats in Combat&quot;'' authored by Tom Cooper and Farzad Bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_452.shtml|title=Book: Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat|publisher=www.acig.org|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the research contained in the book was based on pilot interviews and though it may be the only book devoted to the topic of Iranian F-14s, it is not without its critics.{{Weasel-inline|date=December 2010}}

Reports vary on the use of the 285 missiles supplied to Iran,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0077.shtml|title=Iranian Air Force F-14|publisher=Aerospaceweb.org|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Iran–Iraq War]], from 1980-88. It is rumored{{by whom|date=December 2010}} that U.S. technical personnel sabotaged the aircraft and weapons before they left the country following the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]], making it impossible to fire the missile. However, the IRIAF was able to repair the sabotage and the damage only affected a limited number of planes; not the entire fleet. A considerable counterpoint to the sabotage rumors is the 80th F-14, ordered by Iran but never delivered due to the revolution, indicating there was no impediment to simply seizing Tomcats and missiles.

Some western sources{{which?|date=December 2010}} claim that it is unlikely that the Phoenix was used operationally. First, as difficult as the missile and fire control systems were to operate, Iran had hired many American technicians. Upon leaving, they took most of the knowledge about how to operate and maintain these complex weapon systems with them. Also, without a steady supply of engineering support from Hughes Aircraft Missile Systems Group and corresponding spares and upgrades, even a technically competent operator would have extreme difficulty fielding operational weapons.

Most informed sources{{which?|date=December 2010}} claim that the primary use of the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]] was as an [[airborne early warning]] aircraft, guarded by other fighters. However, Cooper claims that the IRIAF used the F-14 actively as a fighter-interceptor, and at times as an escort fighter with the AIM-54 scoring 60-70 kills. F-14s were often used to protect IRIAF tankers supporting strike packages into Iraq, and scanned over the border with their radars, often engaging detected Iraqi flights. Also, some F-14s were modified into specialized airborne early warning aircraft.

Supporters of these claims point to the fact that, in the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]], Iraqi fighter pilots consistently turned and fled as soon as American F-14 pilots turned on their fighters' very distinctive [[AN/AWG-9]] radars, which suggests that Iraqi pilots had learned to avoid the F-14. The counter-argument is that virtually all Iraqi fighters turned and fled when confronted, regardless of the type of aircraft facing them, although the Americans had much better success engaging Iraqi fighters with their [[F-15E Strike Eagle]]s in the same vicinity where Tomcats operated.

According to Cooper, the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force was able to keep its F-14 fighters and AIM-54 missiles in regular use during the whole of the Iran–Iraq War, though periodic lack of spares grounded at times large parts of the fleet. At worst, during late 1987, the stock of AIM-54 missiles was at its lowest, with less than 50 operational missiles available. The missiles needed fresh [[thermal batteries]] that could only be purchased from the USA. Iran managed finally, to find a clandestine buyer that supplied it with batteries - though those did cost up to $10,000 USD each. Iran did receive spares and parts for both the F-14s and AIM-54s from various sources during the Iran–Iraq War, and has received more spares after the conflict. Iran started a heavy industrial program to build spares for the planes and missiles, and although there are claims that it no longer relies on outside sources to keep its F-14s and AIM-54s operational, there is evidence that Iran continues to procure parts clandestinely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Theimer| first = Sharon | title = Iran Gets Army Gear in Pentagon Sale | url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/01/16/ap3334088.html | accessdate = 2007-01-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070119084031/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/01/16/ap3334088.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran claims to be working on building an equivalent missile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail/142412.html Iran eyes missile stronger than Phoenix]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lockheed AC-130''' [[gunship]] is a heavily-armed [[ground-attack aircraft]]. The basic airframe is manufactured by [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]], and [[Boeing]] is responsible for the conversion into a [[gunship]] and for aircraft support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boe_AC-130U&quot;&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/support/maintenance/special_ops/ac130u.html AC-130U Gunship page]. Boeing&lt;/ref&gt; It is a variant of the [[C-130 Hercules]] transport plane. The AC-130A Gunship II superseded the [[AC-47 Spooky|AC-47 Gunship I]] during the [[Vietnam War]].

The gunship's sole user is the [[United States Air Force]], which uses '''AC-130H Spectre''' and '''AC-130U Spooky''' variants.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF_factsht&quot;&gt;[http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=71 AC-130H/U Gunship fact sheet].

(Article was originally based on this.)&lt;/ref&gt; The AC-130H &quot;Spectre&quot; is powered by four [[Allison Engine Company|Allison]] [[Allison T56|T56-A-15]] [[turboprop]]s and is armed with two 20&amp;nbsp;mm [[M61 Vulcan]] cannons, one [[Bofors 40mm]] autocannon, and one 105&amp;nbsp;mm [[M102 howitzer|M102]] cannon. The upgraded AC-130U &quot;Spooky&quot; has a single 25&amp;nbsp;mm [[GAU-12 Equalizer]] in place of the Spectre's twin 20&amp;nbsp;mm cannons, as well as an improved fire control system and increased capacity for ammunition. It has a standard crew of twelve or thirteen airmen, including five officers (two pilots, a navigator, an electronic warfare officer, and a fire control officer) and enlisted personnel ([[flight engineer]], sensor operators, aerial gunners, and a loadmaster).

The US Air Force uses the AC-130 gunships for [[close air support]], [[air interdiction]], air missions, bombing raid, and force protection. Close air support roles include supporting ground troops, escorting [[convoy]]s, and flying urban operations. Air interdiction missions are conducted against planned targets and targets of opportunity. Force protection missions include [[Defense (military)|defending]] [[air base]]s and other facilities. AC-130U Spooky gunships are stationed at [[Hurlburt Field]] in Northwest [[Florida]] and the AC-130H models are stationed at [[Cannon AFB]], [[New Mexico]]. The gunship squadrons are part of the [[Air Force Special Operations Command]] (AFSOC), a component of the [[United States Special Operations Command]] (SOCOM).

==Development==
During the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] was selected to replace the [[Douglas AC-47 Spooky]] gunship (Project Gunship I) in order to improve mission endurance and increase capacity to carry munitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAF Nat Museum&quot;&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3216 AC-130A fact sheet].

In 1967, JC-130A USAF 54-1626 was selected for conversion into the prototype AC-130A gunship (Project Gunship II). The modifications were done at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] by the Aeronautical Systems Division. A direct view [[Night vision device|night vision telescope]] was installed in the forward door, an early [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) in the forward part of the left wheel well, and Gatling guns fixed facing down and aft along the left side. The [[Analog computer|analog]] [[fire control computer]] prototype was handcrafted by [[RAF]] Wing Commander Tom Pinkerton at the USAF Avionics Laboratory at Wright-Patterson AFB. Flight testing of the prototype was performed primarily at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], followed by further testing and modifications. By September 1967, the aircraft was certified ready for combat testing and was flown to [[Nha Trang Air Base]], [[South Vietnam]] for a 90 day test program.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAF Nat Museum&quot;/&gt;  The AC-130 was later supplemented by the [[Fairchild AC-119|AC-119 Shadow]] (Project Gunship III), which later proved underpowered.

Seven more aircraft were converted to the &quot;Plain Jane&quot; configuration like the AC-130 prototype in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3220 Lockheed AC-130A &quot;Plain Jane&quot;]. National Museum of the United States Air Force. Accessed on 5 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and one aircraft received the &quot;Surprise Package&quot; equipment in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3221 Lockheed AC-130A &quot;Surprise Package&quot;]. National Museum of the United States Air Force. Accessed on 5 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Surprise Package included the latest [[20 mm caliber|20&amp;nbsp;mm]] Gatling-style cannons and [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40 mm Bofors cannon]] but no 7.62&amp;nbsp;mm close support armament. Surprise Package served as a test bed for the avionic systems and armament for the AC-130E.

In 1970, ten more AC-130As were acquired under the &quot;Pave Pronto&quot; project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pave Pronto&quot;&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3222 Lockheed AC-130A &quot;PAVE Pronto&quot;]. National Museum of the United States Air Force. Accessed on 5 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1971, Surprise Package equipped AC-130s were converted to the Pave Pronto configuration and assumed their new nickname 'Thor'. Conversion of C-130Es into AC-130Es for the &quot;PAVE Spectre&quot; project followed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3224 Lockheed AC-130E &quot;PAVE Spectre&quot;].

Regardless of their project names the aircraft were more commonly referred to by the squadron's call sign 'Spectre'.

===Recent and planned upgrades===
In 2007, [[Air Force Special Operations Command]] (AFSOC) initiated a program to upgrade the armament of AC-130s. The test program planned for the 25&amp;nbsp;mm GAU-12/U and 40&amp;nbsp;mm Bofors cannon on the AC-130U gunships to be replaced with two [[30 mm caliber|30&amp;nbsp;mm]] Mk 44 [[Bushmaster II]] cannon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles2006/200610105842.asp |title=30 mm Everywhere |publisher= strategypage.com |date=1 October 2006 |author= Dunnigan, James }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Air Force modified four AC-130U gunships as test platforms for the Bushmasters. These were referred to as AC-130U Plus 4 or AC-130U+4. AFSOC, however, canceled its plans to install the new cannons on its fleet of AC-130Us. It has since removed the guns and re-installed the original 40&amp;nbsp;mm cannon and returned the planes to combat duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwfdailynews.com/share/profiles/?slid=52836bbc-64ad-c2d4-9dae-291a895b67d1&amp;plckController=PersonaBlog&amp;plckScript=personaScript&amp;plckElementId=personaDest&amp;plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3a52836bbc-64ad-c2d4-9dae-291a895b67d1Post%3a4d252120-6dcd-4132-b823-23038489868d&amp;sid=sitelife.nwfdailynews.com |title=Air Force Cancels 30mm Cannon Program For AC-130U Gunships |date=11 July 2008 |work=nwfdailynews }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brigadier General Bradley A. Heithold, AFSOC's director of plans, programs, requirements, and assessments, said on 11 August 2008 that the effort was canceled because of problems with the Bushmaster's accuracy in tests &quot;at the altitude we were employing it&quot;. There were also schedule considerations that drove the decision, he said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2008/October%202008/1008world.aspx &quot;Spooky Gun Swap Canceled&quot;]. Air Force Magazine, October 2008, Volume 91, Number 10, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also plans to possibly replace the [[M102 howitzer]] with a [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] [[M120 mortar|120&amp;nbsp;mm mortar]], and to give the AC-130 a standoff capability using either the [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] missile, the [[Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System]] (based on the [[Hydra 70]] rocket), or the [[GBU-44/B Viper Strike|Viper Strike]] [[glide bomb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2006garm/tuesday/elliot.pdf |title=Future AC-130 Gunship Integrated Weapons Systems |format=PDF |publisher=US DoD |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Air Force awarded [[L-3 Communications]] a $61 million contract to add weapons packages to eight [[Lockheed MC-130|MC-130W Combat Spear]] special-mission aircraft&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gov/contracts/contract.aspx?contractid=4371 DoD &quot;Contracts&quot;]. U.S. Department of Defense, 21 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; to give them a gunship-like attack capability. L-3 will provide weapons kits, named &quot;precision strike packages&quot;, for installation on the aircraft at Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, Georgia. MC-130Ws fitted with the weapons will be known as '''Dragon Spears'''. Air Force Special Operations Command is arming these aircraft to relieve the high operational demands on its regular AC-130 gunships until new AC-130Js enter the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Sirak, Micael.

The Air Force launched an initiative in 2011 to acquire 16 new gunships based on new-built [[MC-130J Combat Shadow II]] special operations tankers outfitted with a &quot;precision strike package&quot; to give them an attack capability. The Air Force is requesting $1.6 billion from Fiscal 2011 through 2015 for this recapitalization. These aircraft would increase the size of the Air Force's gunship fleet to 33 aircraft, a net increase of eight, after accounting for the planned retirement of eight aging AC-130Hs. The first aircraft would be bought in Fiscal 2012, followed by two in Fiscal 2013, five in Fiscal 2014, and the final eight in Fiscal 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Sirak, Micael.

==Design==
These heavily-armed aircraft incorporate side-firing weapons integrated with sophisticated sensors, navigation, and fire control systems to provide precision firepower or area-saturation fire with its varied armament. The AC-130 can spend long periods flying over their target area at night and in adverse weather. The sensor suite consists of a television sensor, [[infrared]] sensor, and [[radar]]. These sensors allow the gunship to visually or electronically identify friendly ground forces and targets in most weather conditions.

The AC-130U is equipped with the [[AN/APQ-180]], a [[synthetic aperture radar]] for long-range target detection and identification. The gunship's navigational devices include [[inertial navigation system]]s and a [[Global Positioning System]]. The AC-130U employs technologies developed in the 1990s which allow it to attack two targets simultaneously. It has twice the [[Ammunition|munitions]] capacity of the AC-130H.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boe_AC-130U&quot; /&gt; Although the AC-130U conducts some operations in daylight, most of its combat missions are conducted at night.&lt;ref&gt;Naylor, Sean.

[[File:AC-130U Sensor Operator.jpg|thumb|left|AC-130U sensor suite]]

During the Vietnam era, the various AC-130 versions following the Pave Pronto modifications were equipped with a [[magnetic anomaly detector]] (MAD) system called the Black Crow (AN/ASD-5), a highly sensitive passive device with a [[phased-array]] [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] located in the left-front nose [[radome]] that could pick up localized deviations in [[earth's magnetic field]] and is normally used to detect submerged [[submarine]]s. The Black Crow system on the AC-130A/E/H could detect the unshielded [[ignition coil]]s of North Vietnamese trucks hidden under the dense foliage of the jungle canopy along the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]]. It could also detect the signal from hand-held transmitters used by air controllers on the ground to identify and locate targets. The system was [[Master-slave (technology)|slaved]] into the targeting computer.

The AC-130H's unit cost is US$132.4 million, and the AC-130U's cost is US$190 million (fiscal 2001 dollars).&lt;ref name=&quot;AF_factsht&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Ac130 gunship.jpg|thumb|AC-130U Spooky]]

The PGM-38/U Enhanced 25&amp;nbsp;mm [[High explosive incendiary|High Explosive Incendiary]] (HEI) round was created to expand the AC-130U gunships' mission in standoff range and survivability for its 25&amp;nbsp;mm [[GAU-12 Equalizer|GAU-12/U]] gun system. This round is a combination of the existing PGU-25 HEI and a M758 fuse designated as FMU-151/B to meet the MIL-STD-1316. The FMU-151 has an improved arming delay with multi-sensitive range.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;PGU-38/U 25mm Ammunition&quot;, August 1993, Alliant Techsystems, Public Release, Case No. 93-S3040, E10630 8/93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
The AC-130 Gunship first arrived in South Vietnam on 21 September 1967 under the Gunship II program and began combat operations over [[Laos]] and South Vietnam that year. By 30 October 1968 enough AC-130 Gunship IIs arrived to form a squadron, the [[16th Special Operations Squadron]] (SOS) of the [[8th Tactical Fighter Wing]] (TFW), at [[Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base]], [[Thailand]]. By December 1968 most AC-130s were flown under [[F-4 Phantom II]] escort from the 497th Tactical Fighter Squadron, normally three Phantoms per Gunship. In late 1969, under the code name of &quot;Surprise Package&quot;, 56-0490 arrived with solid-state laser-illuminated low-light-level-TV with a companion YAG [[laser designator]], an improved [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) sensor, video recording for TV and FLIR, an [[inertial navigation system]], and a prototype [[digital]] [[fire control computer]]. Surprise Package was refitted with upgraded similar equipment in the summer of 1970, and then redeployed to Ubon RTAFB. AC-130s destroyed more than 10,000 trucks and participated in many crucial close air support missions in Vietnam. Six Spectres were lost to enemy fire.&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, Chris.

[[File:AC-130A pylon turn.jpg|thumb|right|AC-130A performs a left-hand [[pylon turn]]]]

In the late 1970s when the AC-130H fleet was first being modified for in-flight refueling capability, a demonstration mission was planned and flown from Hurlburt Field, Florida, non-stop, to conduct a 2-hour live-fire mission over Empire Firing Range in the Republic of Panama, then return home. This 13-hour mission with two in-flight refuelings from [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135]] tankers proved the validity of flying long-range missions outside the [[contiguous United States]] to attack targets then return to home base without intermediate stops.

AC-130s from both the [[4th Special Operations Squadron|4th]] and [[16th Special Operations Squadron|16th]] Special Operations Squadrons have been deployed in nearly every conflict the U.S. has been involved in, officially and unofficially, since the end of the Vietnam War.

In July 1979, AC-130H crews deployed to [[Howard Air Force Base]], [[Panama]], as a precaution against possible hostile actions against American personnel during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]. New time aloft and non-stop distance records were subsequently set by a 16th SOS 2-ship AC-130H formation flight that departed Hurlburt Field on 13 November 1979 and landed on 15 November at [[Andersen Air Force Base]], [[Guam]], a distance of {{convert|7200|nmi|km}} and 29 hours 43 minutes non-stop, refueling four times in-flight.&lt;ref&gt;this flight was documented in Lockheed records and in an article by pilot Lt Col Jim Lawrence in the June 1995 edition of AFSOC Night Flyer magazine&lt;/ref&gt; Refueling support for the Guam deployment was provided by KC-135 crews from the 305th Air Refueling Wing from [[Grissom AFB]], Indiana.

At Guam, AC-130H crews developed communications-out/lights-out refueling procedures for later employment by trial-and-error. This deployment with the 1 SOW/CC as Task Force commander was directed from the office of the CJCS for fear that Iranian militants could begin executing American Embassy personnel who had been [[Iran hostage crisis|taken hostage on 4 November]]. One early option considered AC-130H retaliatory punitive strikes deep within Iran. Later gunship flights exceeded the 1979 Hurlburt-to-Guam flight.

During [[Invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]] in [[Grenada]] in 1983, AC-130s suppressed enemy air defense systems and attacked ground forces enabling the assault of the [[Point Salines International Airport|Point Salines Airfield]] via [[airdrop]] and air-land of friendly forces. The AC-130 aircrew earned the [[William H. Tunner|Lieutenant General William H. Tunner]] Award for the mission. AC-130s also had a primary role during the [[United States invasion of Panama|Operation Just Cause]] in Panama in 1989 when they destroyed [[Military of Panama|Panama Defense Force]] headquarters and numerous command-and-control facilities. Aircrews earned the [[Mackay Trophy]] for the most meritorious flight of the year and the Tunner Award for their efforts.

[[File:DF-ST-89-00410.JPEG|thumb|left|Smoke visible from [[Gatling gun]] during twilight operations in 1988]]
During the [[Gulf War]] of 1990-91 (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm), AC-130s provided close air support and force protection (air base defense) for ground forces, and battlefield interdiction. The primary interdiction targets were early warning/[[Ground-controlled interception|ground control intercept]] (EW/GCI) sites along the southern border of [[Iraq]]. The first gunship to enter the [[Battle of Khafji]] helped stop a southbound Iraqi armored column on 29 January 1991. One day later three more gunships provided further aid to [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] participating in the operation. The gunships attacked Iraqi positions and columns moving south to reinforce their positions north of the city.

Despite the threat of [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs) and increasing visibility during the early morning hours of 31 January 1991, one AC-130H, AF Serial No. 69-6567, call-sign Spirit 03, opted to stay to continue to protect the Marines. A lone Iraqi with a [[Strela-2]] [[MANPAD]] shot Spirit 03 down, and all 14 crew members died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specialoperations.com/Memorial/spirit.html Spirit 03 and the Battle for Khafji]&lt;/ref&gt;

The military has used AC-130 gunships during the humanitarian operations in [[Somalia]] ([[Unified Task Force|Operation Restore Hope]] and [[Operation United Shield]]) in 1992-93, [[Operation Uphold Democracy]] in [[Haiti]] in 1994, and in the [[NATO]] missions in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Kosovo]] during the 1990s. AC-130s took part in [[Timeline of United States military operations#1991-1999|Operation Assured Response]] in [[Liberia]] in 1996 and in [[Operation Silver Wake]] in 1997, the evacuation of American [[non-combatants]] from [[Albania]].

[[File:AC-130 firing night.gif|thumb|right|Weapons fire during a night mission]]

The AC-130U model gunship set a new record for the longest sustained flight by any C-130 with a mission from the 22 October through the 24 October 1997, when two AC-130U gunships flew 36 hours nonstop from [[Hurlburt Field]], Florida to [[Taegu Air Base]] (Daegu), [[South Korea]] while being refueled seven times in the air by KC-135 tankers. This flight exceeded the previous record C-130 longest flight by over 6 hours, while the two U-model gunships took on 410,000&amp;nbsp;lb (186,000&amp;nbsp;kg) of fuel. Gunships also were part of the buildup of U.S. forces in 1998 to convince [[Iraq]] to comply with [[United Nations|UN]] weapons inspections.

===Recent operations===
The United States used gunships during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in Afghanistan (2001– ), and [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] in Iraq (2003–2010). In 2007 U.S. Special Operations forces used the AC-130 in attacks on suspected [[al-Qaeda]] militants in Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/01/08/somalia.strike/index.html &quot;Pentagon official: U.S. attacks al Qaeda suspects in Somalia&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6296971.stm &quot;US plane 'bombed Somalia targets'&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AC-130 Spectre.jpg|thumb|[[Nose art]] on AC-130A AF Serial No. 53-3129 at the USAF Armament Museum, Eglin AFB, Florida]]

One of the first seven AC-130A aircraft deployed to [[Vietnam]] was AF Serial No. 53-3129, named ''First Lady'' in November 1970. In addition to being the first AC-130, this aircraft was a conversion of the first production C-130. On 25 March 1971, it took an [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft artillery]] hit in the belly just aft of the nose gear wheel well over the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] in [[Laos]]. The 37&amp;nbsp;mm shell destroyed everything below the crew deck and barely missed striking two crew members. In 1975, after the conclusion of US involvement in the Vietnam war, it was transferred to the [[Air Force Reserve Command|Air Force Reserve]], where it served with the [[711th Special Operations Squadron]] of the [[919th Special Operations Wing]]. In 1980 the aircraft was upgraded from the original three-bladed propellers to the quieter four-bladed propellers and was eventually retired in late 1995. The retirement also marked an end to the [[Air Force Reserve Command]] flying the AC-130A. The aircraft now sits on display in the final Air Force Reserve Command configuration with grey paint, black markings, the four-bladed Hamilton Sunstrand 54H60-91 props at the [[Air Force Armament Museum]] at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], [[Florida]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gunships.org/birds.html List of AC-130 Gunships]. gunships.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gunships.org/1stlady.html &quot;First Lady&quot; retires, era ends]. gunships.org&lt;/ref&gt;

A second AC-130A, AF Serial No. 56-0509, named the ''Ultimate End'', was accepted by the Air Force on 28 February 1957, and modified to the AC-130A configuration on 27 July 1970. The aircraft participated in the Vietnam War and the [[Mayaguez incident|rescue]] of the [[SS Mayaguez]]. ''Ultimate End'' demonstrated the durability of the C-130 after surviving hits in five places by 37&amp;nbsp;mm anti-aircraft artillery on 12 December 1970, extensive left wing leading edge damage on 12 April 1971 and a 57&amp;nbsp;mm round damaging the belly and injuring one crewman on 4 March 1972. &quot;Ultimate End&quot; was reassigned to the [[Air Force Reserve]]'s [[919th Special Operations Wing]] at [[Eglin AFB]] Auxiliary Field #3 / [[Duke Field]] on 17 June 1975, where it continued in service until retired in the fall 1994 and transferred to [[Air Force Special Operations Command]]'s ''Heritage Air Park'' at [[Hurlburt Field]], FL. While assigned to the [[711th Special Operations Squadron]], ''Ultimate End'' served in Operations JUST CAUSE in Panama, [[DESERT STORM]] in Kuwait and Iraq, and UPHOLD DEMOCRACY in Haiti. After 36 years and seven months of service, 24 years as a gunship, ''Ultimate End'' retired from active service on 1 October 1994. It made its last flight from [[Duke Field]] to [[Hurlburt Field]] on 20 October 1994. The Spectre Association dedicated &quot;Ultimate End&quot; (which served with the 16 SOS in Vietnam) on 4 May 1995. Lt Col Michael Byers, then 16 SOS commander, represented the active-duty gunship force and Clyde Gowdy of the Spectre Association represented all Spectre personnel past and present for the unveiling of a monument at the aircraft and the dedication as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurlburt.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3423 AC-130A Spectre].

A third AC-130A, AF Serial No. 54-1630, is on display in the Cold War Gallery at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] at [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], Ohio.  Named ''Azrael'' ([[Azrael]], in the Koran, is the angel of death who severs the soul from the body), this aircraft figured prominently in the closing hours of Operation Desert Storm. On 26 February 1991, Coalition ground forces were driving the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait. With an [[Air Force Reserve]] crew called to active duty, Azrael was sent to the [[Highway of Death|Al Jahra highway]] (Highway 80) between [[Kuwait City]] and [[Basra]], Iraq, to intercept the convoys of tanks, trucks, buses, and cars fleeing the battle. Facing [[SA-6]] and [[SA-8]] surface-to-air missiles and 37&amp;nbsp;mm and 57&amp;nbsp;mm radar-guided anti-aircraft artillery the crew attacked and destroyed or disabled most of the convoys. ''Azrael'' was also assigned to the [[919th Special Operations Wing]] and retired to the museum in October 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=412 Lockheed AC-130A Spectre], [http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/071106-F-1234S-006.jpg image].

Another AC-130A, AF Serial No. 54-1626, the original prototype AC-130 named &quot;Gunship II&quot; is on display at the outdoor Air Park at the ''[[National Museum of the United States Air Force]]'' at [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3216 Lockheed AC-130A], [http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/051128-F-1234P-066.jpg image].

AC-130A USAF 54-1623, c/n 3010, named &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; served in Southeast Asia and later until being retired in 1997 to [[Dobbins AFB]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. To eventually go to the Lockheed museum at [[Marietta, Georgia]].  AC-130A USAF 54-1626, c/n 3013 served in Southeast Asia during 1967-1972, then to JC-130A test configuration.  Transferred to the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]], [[Dayton, Ohio]] in 1976.  Converted back to AC-130A configuration in late 1990s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[abstract algebra]], an '''alternative algebra''' is an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] in which multiplication need not be [[associative]], only [[alternativity|alternative]]. That is, one must have
*&lt;math&gt;x(xy) = (xx)y&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;(yx)x = y(xx)&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'' and ''y'' in the algebra. Every [[associative algebra]] is obviously alternative, but so too are some strictly [[Algebra over a field#Non-associative algebras|nonassociative algebras]] such as the [[octonion]]s. The [[sedenion]]s, on the other hand, are not alternative.

==The associator==

Alternative algebras are so named because they are precisely the algebras for which the [[associator]] is [[alternating form|alternating]]. The associator is a [[multilinear map|trilinear map]] given by
:&lt;math&gt;[x,y,z] = (xy)z - x(yz)&lt;/math&gt;
By definition a multilinear map is alternating if it vanishes whenever two of it arguments are equal. The left and right alternative identities for an algebra are equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;[x,x,y] = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[y,x,x] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Both of these identities together imply that the associator is totally [[skew-symmetric]]. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;[x_{\sigma(1)}, x_{\sigma(2)}, x_{\sigma(3)}] = \sgn(\sigma)[x_1,x_2,x_3]&lt;/math&gt;
for any [[permutation]] σ. It follows that
:&lt;math&gt;[x,y,x] = 0&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'' and ''y''. This is equivalent to the so-called [[flexible identity]]
:&lt;math&gt;(xy)x = x(yx).&lt;/math&gt;
The associator is therefore alternating. Conversely, any algebra whose associator is alternating is clearly alternative. By symmetry, any algebra which satisfies any two of:
*left alternative identity: &lt;math&gt;x(xy) = (xx)y&lt;/math&gt;
*right alternative identity: &lt;math&gt;(yx)x = y(xx)&lt;/math&gt;
*flexible identity: &lt;math&gt;(xy)x = x(yx).&lt;/math&gt;
is alternative and therefore satisfies all three identities.

An alternating associator is always totally skew-symmetric. The converse holds so long as the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the base field is not 2.

==Properties==

'''Artin's theorem''' states that in an alternative algebra the [[subalgebra]] generated by any two elements is [[associative]]. Conversely, any algebra for which this is true is clearly alternative. It follows that expressions involving only two variables can be written without parenthesis unambiguously in an alternative algebra. A generalization of Artin's theorem states that whenever three elements &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; in an alternative algebra associate (i.e. &lt;math&gt;[x,y,z] = 0&lt;/math&gt;) the subalgebra generated by those elements is associative.

A corollary of Artin's theorem is that alternative algebras are [[power-associative]], that is, the subalgebra generated by a single element is associative. The converse need not hold: the [[sedenion]]s are power-associative but not alternative.

The [[Moufang identities]]
*&lt;math&gt;a(x(ay)) = (axa)y&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;((xa)y)a = x(aya)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;(ax)(ya) = a(xy)a&lt;/math&gt;
hold in any alternative algebra.

In a unital alternative algebra, multiplicative inverses are unique whenever they exist. Moreover, for any invertible element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; one has
:&lt;math&gt;y = x^{-1}(xy).&lt;/math&gt;
This is equivalent to saying the associator &lt;math&gt;[x^{-1},x,y]&lt;/math&gt; vanishes for all such &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are invertible then &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; is also invertible with inverse &lt;math&gt;(xy)^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. The set of all invertible elements is therefore closed under multiplication and forms a [[Moufang loop]]. This ''loop of units'' in an alternative ring or algebra is analogous to the [[group of units]] in an associative ring or algebra.

==Applications==
The projective plane over any alternative division ring is a [[Moufang plane]].

In [[economics]] and [[finance]], '''arbitrage''' ({{IPA-en|ˈɑrbɨtrɑːʒ|IPA}}) is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more [[market]]s: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the [[market price]]s.  When used by academics, an arbitrage is a transaction that involves no negative [[cash flow]] at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state; in simple terms, it is the possibility of a risk-free profit at zero cost.

In principle and in academic use, an arbitrage is risk-free; in common use, as in [[statistical arbitrage]], it may refer to ''expected'' profit, though losses may occur, and in practice, there are always [[#Risks|risk]]s in arbitrage, some minor (such as fluctuation of prices decreasing profit margins), some major (such as devaluation of a currency or derivative). In academic use, an arbitrage involves taking advantage of differences in price of a ''single'' asset or ''identical'' cash-flows; in common use, it is also used to refer to differences between ''similar'' assets ([[relative value (economics)|relative value]] or [[convergence trade]]s), as in [[merger arbitrage]].

People who engage in arbitrage are called '''arbitrageurs''' ({{IPA-en|ˌɑrbɨtrɑːˈʒɜr|IPA}})—such as a bank or brokerage firm. The term is mainly applied to trading in [[financial instruments]], such as [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], [[stock]]s, [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], [[Commodity|commodities]] and [[Currency|currencies]].

== Arbitrage-free ==
If the market prices do not allow for profitable arbitrage, the prices are said to constitute an '''arbitrage equilibrium''' or '''arbitrage-free''' market. An arbitrage equilibrium is a precondition for a [[general equilibrium|general economic equilibrium]].  The assumption that there is no arbitrage is used in [[quantitative finance]] to calculate a unique [[risk neutral]] price for [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]].
  
==Conditions for arbitrage==
Arbitrage is possible when one of three conditions is met:

#The same asset does not trade at the same price on all markets (&quot;[[law of one price|the law of one price]]&quot;).
#Two assets with identical cash flows do not trade at the same price.
#An asset with a known price in the future does not today trade at its future price [[Discounting|discount]]ed at the [[risk-free interest rate]] (or, the asset does not have negligible costs of storage; as such, for example, this condition holds for grain but not for [[security (finance)|securities]]).

Arbitrage is not simply the act of buying a product in one market and selling it in another for a higher price at some later time. The transactions must occur ''simultaneously'' to avoid exposure to market risk, or the risk that prices may change on one market before both transactions are complete. In practical terms, this is generally only possible with securities and financial products which can be traded electronically, and even then, when each leg of the trade is executed the prices in the market may have moved.  Missing one of the legs of the trade (and subsequently having to trade it soon after at a worse price) is called 'execution risk' or more specifically 'leg risk'.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;As an arbitrage consists of at least two trades, the metaphor is of putting on a pair of pants, one leg (trade) at a time. The risk that one trade (leg) fails to execute is thus 'leg risk'.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the simplest example, any good sold in one market should sell for the same price in another. [[Merchant|Traders]] may, for example, find that the price of wheat is lower in agricultural regions than in cities, purchase the good, and transport it to another region to sell at a higher price. This type of price arbitrage is the most common, but this simple example ignores the cost of transport, storage, risk, and other factors. &quot;True&quot; arbitrage requires that there be no market risk involved. Where securities are traded on more than one exchange, arbitrage occurs by simultaneously buying in one and selling on the other.

See [[rational pricing]], particularly [[rational pricing#Arbitrage mechanics|arbitrage mechanics]], for further discussion.

Mathematically it is defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;P(V_t \geq 0) = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(V_t \neq 0) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_t&lt;/math&gt; means a portfolio at time t.

==Examples==
* Suppose that the [[exchange rate]]s (after taking out the fees for making the exchange) in London are £5 = $10 = ¥1000 and the exchange rates in Tokyo are ¥1000 = $12 = £6.  Converting ¥1000 to $12 in Tokyo and converting that $12 into ¥1200 in London, for a profit of ¥200, would be arbitrage.  In reality, this &quot;[[triangle arbitrage]]&quot; is so simple that it almost never occurs.  But more complicated foreign exchange arbitrages, such as the spot-forward arbitrage (see [[interest rate parity]]) are much more common.
*One example of arbitrage involves the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the Security Futures Exchange [[OneChicago, LLC|OneChicago (OCX)]]. When the price of a stock on the NYSE and its corresponding [[futures contract]] on  OCX are out of sync, one can buy the less expensive one and sell it to the more expensive market.  Because the differences between the prices are likely to be small (and not to last very long), this can only be done profitably with computers examining a large number of prices and automatically exercising a trade when the prices are far enough out of balance. The activity of other arbitrageurs can make this risky. Those with the fastest computers and the most expertise take advantage of series of small differences that would not be profitable if taken individually.
*Economists use the term &quot;global labor arbitrage&quot; to refer to the tendency of manufacturing jobs to flow towards whichever country has the lowest wages per unit output at present and has reached the minimum requisite level of political and economic development to support [[industrialization]].  At present, many such jobs appear to be flowing towards [[People's Republic of China|China]], though some which require command of English are going to [[India]] and the [[Philippines]]. In popular terms, this is referred to as [[offshoring]]. (Note that &quot;offshoring&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;outsourcing&quot;, which means &quot;to subcontract from an outside supplier or source&quot;, such as when a business outsources its bookkeeping to an accounting firm. Unlike offshoring, outsourcing always involves subcontracting jobs to a different company, and that company can be in the same country as the outsourcing company.)
*[[Arbitrage betting|Sports arbitrage]] – numerous [[internet]] [[bookmakers]] offer odds on the outcome of the same event.  Any given bookmaker will weight their odds so that no one [[customer]] can cover all outcomes at a profit against their books.  However, in order to remain competitive their margins are usually quite low.  Different bookmakers may offer different odds on the same outcome of a given event; by taking the best odds offered by each bookmaker, a customer can under some circumstances cover all possible outcomes of the event and lock a small risk-free profit, known as a [[Dutch book]]. This profit would typically be between 1% and 5% but can be much higher. One problem with sports arbitrage is that bookmakers sometimes make mistakes and this can lead to an invocation of the 'palpable error' rule, which most bookmakers invoke when they have made a mistake by offering or posting incorrect odds. As bookmakers become more proficient, the odds of making an 'arb' usually last for less than an hour and typically only a few minutes. Furthermore, huge bets on one side of the market also alert the bookies to correct the market.
*[[Exchange-traded fund]] arbitrage – Exchange Traded Funds allow authorized participants to exchange back and forth between shares in underlying securities held by the fund and shares in the fund itself, rather than allowing the buying and selling of shares in the ETF directly with the fund sponsor. ETFs trade in the open market, with prices set by market demand. An ETF may trade at a premium or discount to the value of the underlying assets. When a significant enough premium appears, an arbitrageur will buy the underlying securities, convert them to shares in the ETF, and sell them in the open market. When a discount appears, an arbitrageur will do the reverse. In this way, the arbitrageur makes a low-risk profit, while fulfilling a useful function in the ETF marketplace by keeping ETF prices in line with their underlying value.
* Some types of [[hedge fund]]s make use of a modified form of arbitrage to profit. Rather than exploiting price differences between identical assets, they will purchase and sell [[security (finance)|securities]], [[asset]]s and [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] with similar characteristics, and [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] any significant differences between the two assets. Any difference between the hedged positions represents any remaining risk (such as basis risk) plus profit; the belief is that there remains some difference which, even after hedging most risk, represents pure profit. For example, a fund may see that there is a substantial difference between U.S. dollar debt and local currency debt of a foreign country, and enter into a series of matching trades (including currency swaps) to arbitrage the difference, while simultaneously entering into [[credit default swap]]s to protect against [[country risk]] and other types of specific risk..

==Price convergence==
Arbitrage has the effect of causing prices in different markets to converge. As a result of arbitrage, the currency [[exchange rate]]s, the price of [[commodities]], and the price of securities in different markets tend to converge to the same prices, in all markets, in each category. The speed at which prices converge is a measure of market efficiency. Arbitrage tends to reduce [[price discrimination]] by encouraging people to buy an item where the price is low and resell it where the price is high, as long as the buyers are not prohibited from reselling and the transaction costs of buying, holding and reselling are small relative to the difference in prices in the different markets.

Arbitrage moves different currencies toward [[purchasing power parity]]. As an example, assume that a car purchased in the United States is cheaper than the same car in Canada. Canadians would buy their cars across the border to exploit the arbitrage condition. At the same time, Americans would buy US cars, transport them across the border, and sell them in Canada. Canadians would have to buy American Dollars to buy the cars, and Americans would have to sell the Canadian dollars they received in exchange for the exported cars. Both actions would increase demand for US Dollars, and supply of Canadian Dollars, and as a result, there would be an appreciation of the US Dollar. Eventually, if unchecked, this would make US cars more expensive for all buyers, and Canadian cars cheaper, until there is no longer an incentive to buy cars in the US and sell them in Canada.
More generally, international arbitrage opportunities in [[commodity|commodities]], goods, [[Security_(finance)|securities]] and [[currency|currencies]], on a grand scale, tend to change [[exchange rate]]s until the [[purchasing power]] is equal.

In reality, of course, one must consider taxes and the costs of travelling back and forth between the US and Canada. Also, the features built into the cars sold in the US are not exactly the same as the features built into the cars for sale in Canada, due, among other things, to the different emissions and other auto regulations in the two countries. In addition, our example assumes that no duties have to be paid on importing or exporting cars from the USA to Canada.
Similarly, most [[asset]]s exhibit (small) differences between countries, [[transaction cost]]s, taxes, and other costs provide an impediment to this kind of arbitrage.

Similarly, arbitrage affects the difference in interest rates paid on government bonds, issued by the various countries, given the expected depreciations in the currencies, relative to each other (see [[interest rate parity]]).

==Risks==
Arbitrage transactions in modern securities markets involve fairly low day-to-day risks, but can face extremely high risk in rare situations, particularly [[financial crises]], and can lead to [[bankruptcy]]. Formally, arbitrage transactions have [[negative skew]] – prices can get a small amount closer (but often no closer than 0), while they can get very far apart. The day-to-day risks are generally small because the transactions involve small differences in price, so an execution failure will generally cause a small loss (unless the trade is very big or the price moves rapidly). The rare case risks are extremely high because these small price differences are converted to large profits via [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] (borrowed money), and in the rare event of a large price move, this may yield a large loss.

The main day-to-day risk is that part of the transaction fails – execution risk. The main rare risks are counterparty risk and liquidity risk – that a counterparty to a large transaction or many transactions fails to pay, or that one is required to post [[margin (finance)|margin]] and does not have the money to do so. 

In the academic literature, the idea that seemingly very low risk arbitrage trades might not be fully exploited because of these risk factors and other considerations is often referred to as [[limits to arbitrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shleifer|first1=Andrei|first2=Robert|last2=Vishny|year=1997|title=The limits of arbitrage|journal=Journal of Finance|volume=52|pages=35–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xiong|first1=Wei|year=2001|title=Convergence trading with wealth effects|journal=Journal of Financial Economics|volume=62|pages=247–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kondor|first1=Peter|year=2009|title=Risk in Dynamic Arbitrage: Price Effects of Convergence Trading|journal=Journal of Finance|volume=64|issue=2|pages=638–658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Execution risk===
Generally it is impossible to close two or three transactions at the same instant; therefore, there is the possibility that when one part of the deal is closed, a quick shift in prices makes it impossible to close the other at a profitable price. However, this is not necessarily the case. Many exchanges and idbs allow multi legged trades (e.g. basis block trades on LIFFE). 

Competition in the marketplace can also create risks during arbitrage transactions.  As an example, if one was trying to profit from a price discrepancy between IBM on the NYSE and IBM on the London Stock Exchange, they may purchase a large number of shares on the NYSE and find that they cannot simultaneously sell on the LSE.  This leaves the arbitrageur in an unhedged risk position.

In the 1980s, [[risk arbitrage]] was common. In this form of [[speculation]], one trades a security that is clearly undervalued or overvalued, when it is seen that the wrong valuation is about to be corrected by events. The standard example is the stock of a company, undervalued in the stock market, which is about to be the object of a takeover bid; the price of the takeover will more truly reflect the value of the company, giving a large profit to those who bought at the current price&amp;mdash;if the merger goes through as predicted. Traditionally, arbitrage transactions in the securities markets involve high speed, high volume and low risk. At some moment a price difference exists, and the problem is to execute two or three balancing transactions while the difference persists (that is, before the other arbitrageurs act). When the transaction involves a delay of weeks or months, as above, it may entail considerable risk if borrowed money is used to magnify the reward through leverage.  One way of reducing the risk is through the [[Insider trading|illegal use of inside information]], and in fact risk arbitrage with regard to [[leveraged buyout]]s was associated with some of the famous financial scandals of the 1980s such as those involving [[Michael Milken]] and [[Ivan Boesky]].

===Mismatch===
{{details|Convergence trade}}
Another risk occurs if the items being bought and sold are not identical and the arbitrage is conducted under the assumption that the prices of the items are correlated or predictable; this is more narrowly referred to as a [[convergence trade]]. In the extreme case this is merger arbitrage, described below. In comparison to the classical quick arbitrage transaction, such an operation can produce disastrous losses.

===Counterparty risk===
As arbitrages generally involve ''future'' movements of cash, they are subject to [[counterparty risk]]: if a counterparty fails to fulfill their side of a transaction. This is a serious problem if one has either a single trade or many related trades with a single counterparty, whose failure thus poses a threat, or in the event of a financial crisis when many counterparties fail.  This hazard is serious because of the large quantities one must trade in order to make a profit on small price differences.

For example, if one purchases many risky bonds, then hedges them with [[Credit default swap|CDSes]], profiting from the difference between the bond spread and the CDS premium, in a financial crisis the bonds may default ''and'' the CDS writer/seller may itself fail, due to the stress of the crisis, causing the arbitrageur to face steep losses.

===Liquidity risk===
{{rquote|right|Markets can remain irrational a lot longer than you or I can remain solvent.|[[Gary Shilling]]}}
Arbitrage trades are necessarily synthetic, ''leveraged'' trades, as they involve a short position. If the assets used are not identical (so a price divergence makes the trade temporarily lose money), or the margin treatment is not identical, and the trader is accordingly required to post [[margin (finance)|margin]] (faces a [[margin call]]), the trader may run out of capital (if they run out of cash and cannot borrow more) and go bankrupt even though the trades may be expected to ultimately make money. In effect, arbitrage traders synthesize a [[put option]] on their ability to finance themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;bm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purearb.com/purearb/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/desco_market_insights_vol_1_no_1_20090313.pdf|format=pdf|title=The Basis Monster That Ate Wall Street|publisher=[[D. E. Shaw &amp; Co.]]|accessdate=February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prices may diverge during a financial crisis, often termed a &quot;[[flight to quality]]&quot;; these are precisely the times when it is hardest for leveraged investors to raise capital (due to overall capital constraints), and thus they will lack capital precisely when they need it most.&lt;ref name=&quot;bm&quot; /&gt;

==Types of arbitrage==
=== Merger arbitrage ===
Also called [[risk arbitrage]], merger arbitrage generally consists of buying the stock of a company that is the target of a [[takeover]] while [[Short (finance)|shorting]] the stock of the acquiring company.

Usually the market price of the target company is less than the price offered by the acquiring company.
The spread between these two prices depends mainly on the probability and the timing of the takeover being completed as well as the prevailing level of interest rates.

The bet in a merger arbitrage is that such a spread will eventually be zero, if and when the takeover is completed.  The risk is that the deal &quot;breaks&quot; and the spread massively widens.

===Municipal bond arbitrage===
Also called ''municipal bond relative value arbitrage'', ''municipal arbitrage'', or just ''muni arb'', this hedge fund strategy involves one of two approaches.

Generally, managers seek relative value opportunities by being both long and short municipal bonds with a duration-neutral book.  The relative value trades may be between different issuers, different bonds issued by the same entity, or capital structure trades referencing the same asset (in the case of revenue bonds).  Managers aim to capture the inefficiencies arising from the heavy participation of non-economic investors (i.e., high income &quot;buy and hold&quot; investors seeking tax-exempt income) as well as the &quot;crossover buying&quot; arising from corporations' or individuals' changing income tax situations (i.e., insurers switching their munis for corporates after a large loss as they can capture a higher after-tax yield by offsetting the taxable corporate income with underwriting losses).  There are additional inefficiencies arising from the highly fragmented nature of the municipal bond market which has two million outstanding issues and 50,000 issuers in contrast to the Treasury market which has 400 issues and a single issuer. 

Second, managers construct leveraged portfolios of AAA- or AA-rated tax-exempt municipal bonds with the duration risk hedged by [[Short selling|shorting]] the appropriate ratio of taxable corporate bonds.  These corporate equivalents are typically [[interest rate swaps]] referencing [[Libor#LIBOR-based derivatives|Libor]] or [[Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association|SIFMA]][http://www.investinginbonds.com/story.asp?id=351] [http://www.bondmarkets.com/story.asp?id=1157].  The arbitrage manifests itself in the form of a relatively cheap longer maturity municipal bond, which is a municipal bond that yields significantly more than 65% of a corresponding taxable corporate bond.  The steeper slope of the municipal [[yield curve]] allows participants to collect more after-tax income from the municipal bond portfolio than is spent on the interest rate swap; the carry is greater than the hedge expense.  Positive, tax-free carry from muni arb can reach into the double digits.  The bet in this municipal bond arbitrage is that, over a longer period of time, two similar instruments—municipal bonds and interest rate swaps—will correlate with each other; they are both very high quality credits, have the same maturity and are denominated in U.S. dollars.  Credit risk and duration risk are largely eliminated in this strategy.  However, basis risk arises from use of an imperfect hedge, which results in significant, but range-bound principal volatility.  The end goal is to limit this principal volatility, eliminating its relevance over time as the high, consistent, tax-free cash flow accumulates.  Since the inefficiency is related to government tax policy, and hence is structural in nature, it has not been arbitraged away.

Note, however, that many municipal bonds are callable, and that this imposes substantial additional risks to the strategy.

===Convertible bond arbitrage===
A [[convertible bond]] is a [[bond (finance)|bond]] that an investor can return to the issuing company in exchange for a predetermined number of shares in the company.

A convertible bond can be thought of as a [[corporate bond]] with a stock [[call option]] attached to it.

The price of a convertible bond is sensitive to three major factors:

*''[[interest rate]]''. When rates move higher, the bond part of a convertible bond tends to move lower, but the call option part of a convertible bond moves higher (and the aggregate tends to move lower).
*''stock price''. When the price of the stock the bond is convertible into moves higher, the price of the bond tends to rise.
*''[[credit spread (bond)|credit spread]]''. If the creditworthiness of the issuer deteriorates (e.g. [[credit rating agency|rating]] downgrade) and its credit spread widens, the bond price tends to move lower, but, in many cases, the call option part of the convertible bond moves higher (since credit spread correlates with volatility).

Given the complexity of the calculations involved and the convoluted structure that a convertible bond can have, an arbitrageur often relies on sophisticated quantitative models in order to identify bonds that are trading cheap versus their theoretical value.

[[Convertible arbitrage]] consists of buying a convertible bond and hedging two of the three factors in order to gain exposure to the third factor at a very attractive price.

For instance an arbitrageur would first buy a convertible bond, then sell [[fixed income]] [[securities]] or [[interest rate future]]s (to hedge the interest rate exposure) and buy some [[credit default swap|credit protection]] (to hedge the risk of credit deterioration).
Eventually what he'd be left with is something similar to a call option on the underlying stock, acquired at a very low price.
He could then make money either selling some of the more expensive options that are openly traded in the market or [[delta hedging]] his exposure to the underlying shares.

===Depository receipts===
A [[depository receipt]] is a security that is offered as a &quot;tracking stock&quot; on another foreign market. For instance a [[China|Chinese]] company wishing to raise more money may issue a depository receipt on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], as the amount of capital on the local exchanges is limited. These securities, known as ADRs ([[American Depositary Receipt]]) or GDRs ([[Global Depositary Receipt]]) depending on where they are issued, are typically considered &quot;foreign&quot; and therefore trade at a lower value when first released. However, they are exchangeable into the original security (known as [[fungibility]]) and actually have the same value. In this case there is a spread between the perceived value and real value, which can be extracted. Since the ADR is trading at a value lower than what it is worth, one can purchase the ADR and expect to make money as its value converges on the original. However there is a chance that the original stock will fall in value too, so by shorting it you can hedge that risk.

===Dual-listed companies===
A [[dual-listed company]] (DLC) structure involves two companies incorporated in different countries contractually agreeing to operate their businesses as if they were a single enterprise, while retaining their separate legal identity and existing stock exchange listings. In integrated and efficient financial markets, stock prices of the twin pair should move in lockstep. In practice, DLC share prices exhibit large deviations from theoretical parity. Arbitrage positions in DLCs can be set up by obtaining a long position in the relatively underpriced part of the DLC and a short position in the relatively overpriced part. Such arbitrage strategies start paying off as soon as the relative prices of the two DLC stocks converge toward theoretical parity. However, since there is no identifiable date at which DLC prices will converge, arbitrage positions sometimes have to be kept open for considerable periods of time. In the meantime, the price gap might widen. In these situations, arbitrageurs may receive [[margin call]]s, after which they would most likely be forced to liquidate part of the position at a highly unfavorable moment and suffer a loss. Arbitrage in DLCs may be profitable, but is also very risky, see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Jong|first1=A.|first2=L.|last2=Rosenthal|first3=M.A.|last3=van Dijk|year=2008|title=The Risk and Return of Arbitrage in Dual-Listed Companies|month=June|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=525282|accessdate=February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Background material is available at [http://mathijsavandijk.com/dual-listed-companies/].

A good illustration of the risk of DLC arbitrage is the position in [[Royal Dutch Shell]]—which had a DLC structure until 2005—by the hedge fund [[Long-Term Capital Management]] (LTCM, see also the discussion below). Lowenstein (2000) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowenstein|first1=R.|year=2000|title=When genius failed: The rise and fall of Long-Term Capital Management|publisher=Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes that LTCM established an arbitrage position in Royal Dutch Shell in the summer of 1997, when Royal Dutch traded at an 8 to 10 percent premium. In total $2.3 billion was invested, half of which long in Shell and the other half short in Royal Dutch (Lowenstein, p.&amp;nbsp;99). In the autumn of 1998 large defaults on Russian debt created significant losses for the hedge fund and LTCM had to unwind several positions. Lowenstein reports that the premium of Royal Dutch had increased to about 22 percent and LTCM had to close the position and incur a loss. According to Lowenstein (p.&amp;nbsp;234), LTCM lost $286 million in equity pairs trading and more than half of this loss is accounted for by the Royal Dutch Shell trade.

===Private to public equities===
The market prices for privately held companies are typically viewed from a return on investment perspective (such as 25%), whilst publicly held and or exchange listed companies trade on a Price to Earnings multiple (such as a P/E of 10, which equates to a 10% ROI).  Thus, if a publicly traded company specialises in the acquisition of privately held companies, from a per-share perspective there is a gain with every acquisition that falls within these guidelines.  Exempli gratia, [[Berkshire-Hathaway]].  A [[hedge fund]] that is an example of this type of arbitrage is [[Greenridge Capital]], which acts as an [[angel investor]] retaining equity in private companies which are in the process of becoming publicly traded, buying in the private market and later selling in the public market.  Private to public equities arbitrage is a term which can arguably be applied to [[investment banking]] in general.  Private markets to public markets differences may also help explain the overnight windfall gains enjoyed by principals of companies that just did an [[initial public offering]].

===Regulatory arbitrage===
{{details|Jurisdictional arbitrage}}
Regulatory arbitrage is where a regulated institution takes advantage of the difference between its real (or economic) [[risk]] and the regulatory position. For example, if a bank, operating under the [[Basel I]] accord, has to hold 8% capital against [[default risk]], but the real risk of default is lower, it is profitable to [[Securitization|securitise]] the loan, removing the low risk loan from its portfolio. On the other hand, if the real risk is higher than the regulatory risk then it is profitable to make that loan and hold on to it, provided it is priced appropriately.

This process can increase the overall riskiness of institutions under a risk insensitive regulatory regime, as described by [[Alan Greenspan]] in his October 1998 speech on [http://www.ny.frb.org/research/epr/98v04n3/9810gree.pdf The Role of Capital in Optimal Banking Supervision and Regulation].

Regulatory Arbitrage was used for the first time in 2005 when it was applied by Scott V. Simpson, a partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, to refer to a new defence tactic in hostile mergers and acquisitions where differing takeover regimes in deals involving multi-jurisdictions are exploited to the advantage of a target company under threat.

In economics, regulatory arbitrage (sometimes, tax arbitrage) may be used to refer to situations when a company can choose a nominal place of business with a regulatory, legal or tax regime with lower costs. For example, an [[insurance]] company may choose to locate in [[Bermuda]] due to preferential tax rates and policies for insurance companies. This can occur particularly where the business transaction has no obvious physical location: in the case of many financial products, it may be unclear &quot;where&quot; the transaction occurs.

Regulatory arbitrage can include restructuring a bank by outsourcing services such as IT. The outsourcing company takes over the installations, buying out the bank's assets and charges a periodic service fee back to the bank. This frees up cashflow usable for new lending by the bank. The bank will have higher IT costs, but counts on the multiplier effect of [[money creation]] and the interest rate spread to make it a profitable exercise.

Example:
Suppose the bank sells its IT installations for 40 million USD. With a reserve ratio of 10%, the bank can create 400 million USD in additional loans (there is a time lag, and the bank has to expect to recover the loaned money back into its books). The bank can often lend (and securitize the loan) to the IT services company to cover the acquisition cost of the IT installations. This can be at preferential rates, as the sole client using the IT installation is the bank. If the bank can generate 5% interest margin on the 400 million of new loans, the bank will increase interest revenues by 20 million. The IT services company is free to leverage their balance sheet as aggressively as they and their banker agree to. This is the reason behind the trend towards outsourcing in the financial sector. Without this money creation benefit, it is actually more expensive to outsource the IT operations as the outsourcing adds a layer of management and increases overhead.

===Telecom arbitrage===
{{main|International telecommunications routes}}

Telecom arbitrage companies allow phone users to make international calls for free through certain access numbers. Such services are offered in the United Kingdom; the telecommunication arbitrage companies get paid an interconnect charge by the UK mobile networks and then buy international routes at a lower cost. The calls are seen as free by the UK contract mobile phone customers since they are using up their allocated monthly minutes rather than paying for additional calls.

Such services were previously offered in the United States by companies such as FuturePhone.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2560255|accessdate=2008-12-23|title=Free International Calls! Just Dial ... Iowa|date=2006-10-13|author=Ned Potter}}&lt;/ref&gt; These services would operate in rural telephone exchanges, primarily in small towns in the state of Iowa. In these areas, the local telephone carriers are allowed to charge a high &quot;termination fee&quot; to the caller's carrier in order to fund the cost of providing service to the small and sparsely populated areas that they serve. However, FuturePhone (as well as other similar services) ceased operations upon legal challenges from AT&amp;T and other service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techdirt.com/articles/20070207/123022.shtml|accessdate=2008-12-23|title=Phone Call Arbitrage Is All Fun And Games (And Profit) Until AT&amp;T Hits You With A $2 Million Lawsuit|date=2007-02-07|author=Mike Masnick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical arbitrage===
{{main|Statistical arbitrage}}
[[Statistical arbitrage]] is an imbalance in expected nominal values.  A [[casino]] has a statistical arbitrage in every game of chance that it offers—referred to as the [[house advantage]], house edge, [[vigorish]] or house vigorish.

==The debacle of Long-Term Capital Management==
{{main|Long-Term Capital Management}}

[[Long-Term Capital Management]] (LTCM) lost 4.6 billion U.S. dollars in [[fixed income arbitrage]] in September 1998. LTCM had attempted to make money on the price difference between different [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]. For example, it would sell [[Treasury security|U.S. Treasury securities]] and buy Italian bond futures.  The concept was that because Italian bond futures had a less liquid market, in the short term Italian bond futures would have a higher return than U.S. bonds, but in the long term, the prices would converge.  Because the difference was small, a large amount of money had to be borrowed to make the buying and selling profitable.

The downfall in this system began on August 17, 1998, when [[Russia]] defaulted on its [[Russian ruble|ruble]] debt and domestic dollar debt.  Because the markets were already nervous due to the [[Asian financial crisis]], investors began selling non-U.S. treasury  debt and buying U.S. treasuries, which were considered a safe investment.  As a result the price on US treasuries began to increase and the return began decreasing because there were many buyers, and the return (yield) on other bonds began to increase because there were many sellers (i.e. the price of those bonds fell).  This caused the difference between the prices of U.S. treasuries and other bonds to increase, rather than to decrease as LTCM was expecting.  Eventually this caused LTCM to fold, and their creditors had to arrange a bail-out. More controversially, officials of the [[Federal Reserve]] assisted in the negotiations that led to this bail-out, on the grounds that so many companies and deals were intertwined with LTCM that if LTCM actually failed, they would as well, causing a collapse in confidence in the economic system.  Thus LTCM failed as a fixed income arbitrage fund, although it is unclear what sort of profit was realized by the banks that bailed LTCM out.

==Etymology==
&quot;Arbitrage&quot; is a French word and denotes a decision by an arbitrator or arbitration tribunal. (In modern French, &quot;''{{lang|fr|arbitre}}''&quot; usually means [[referee]] or [[umpire]].) In the sense used here it is first defined in 1704 by [[Mathieu de la Porte]] in his treatise &quot;{{lang|fr|La science des négocians et teneurs de livres}}&quot; as a consideration of different exchange rates to recognize the most profitable places of issuance and settlement for a bill of exchange (&quot;{{lang|fr|L'arbitrage est une combinaison que l’on fait de plusieurs changes, pour connoitre [connaître, ''in modern spelling''] quelle place est plus avantageuse pour tirer et remettre}}&quot;.)&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;Arbitrage&quot; in [http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/arbitrage Trésor de la Langue Française].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ACF Fiorentina''',&lt;ref name=&quot;fiorentina_society&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fiorentina_society_legacalcio&quot; /&gt; commonly referred to as simply '''Fiorentina''', is a professional [[Football in Italy|Italian football]] club from [[Florence]], Tuscany. Founded by a merger in 1926, Fiorentina have played at the top level of Italian football for the majority of their existence; only four clubs have played in more Serie A seasons. 

Fiorentina have won two [[List of Italian football champions|Italian Championships]], in [[Serie A 1955–56|1955–56]] and again in [[Serie A 1968–69|1968–69]], as well as winning six [[Coppa Italia]] trophies and one [[Italian Super Cup]]. On the [[UEFA|European stage]] Fiorentina won the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1960–61 European Cup Winners' Cup|1960–61]] and lost the final one year later, they finished runners-up in the [[1956–57 European Cup]] losing against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and also came close to winning the UEFA Cup, finishing as runners-up in the [[1989–90 UEFA Cup|1989–90]] season.

Since 1931 the club have played at the [[Stadio Artemio Franchi]], which currently has a capacity of 47,282. The stadium has used several names over the years and has undergone several renovations. Fiorentina are known widely by the nickname ''Viola'', a reference to their distinctive purple colours.

==History==
{{details|History of ACF Fiorentina}}

===Foundation to World War II===
[[Image:Entrata artemio franchi.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The monumental entrance of the stadium, the same as in 1931 except for the inscription]]
'''Associazione Calcio Fiorentina''' was founded in the autumn of 1926 by local noble and [[National Fascist Party]] member Luigi Ridolfi,&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Martin | first = Simon| title =Football and Fascism: The National Game Under Mussolini| publisher = Berg Publishers| url =http://books.google.com/books?id=LSOmTCa8g50C&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=fiorentina+Luigi+Ridolfi+fascist&amp;source=web&amp;ots=-TY6RPJtWP&amp;sig=plBjFJCYajFpO1RG3DF128PVB7E&amp;hl=en| isbn = 1-85973-705-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; who initiated the merger of two older Florentine clubs, [[C.S. Firenze|CS Firenze]] and [[P.G. Libertas|PG Libertas]]. The aim of the merger was to give Florence a strong club to rival those of the more dominant [[Italian Football Championship]] sides of the time from [[Northern Italy|North-West Italy]]. Also influential was the cultural revival and rediscovery of ''[[Calcio Fiorentino]]'', an ancestor of modern football that was played by members of the [[Medici]] family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;/&gt;

After a rough start and three seasons in lower leagues, Fiorentina reached Serie A in 1931. That same year saw the opening of the new stadium, originally named ''Giovanni Berta,'' after a prominent fascist but now known as ''[[Stadio Artemio Franchi (Florence)|Franchi]]''.  At the time the stadium was a masterpiece of engineering, and its inauguration was monumental. In order to be able to compete with the best teams in Italy, Fiorentina strengthened their team with some new players, notably the [[Uruguay]]an [[Pedro Petrone]], nicknamed ''el Artillero''. Despite enjoying a good season and finishing in fourth place, Fiorentina were relegated the following year, although they would return quickly to Serie A. In 1941 they won their first [[Coppa Italia]], but the team were unable to build on their success during the 1940s because of World War II and other troubles.

===First ''scudetto'' and '50–'60s===
[[Image:Fiorentina scudetto.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The first Italian champion Fiorentina]]
In 1950 Fiorentina started to achieve consistent top-five finishes in the domestic league. The team consisted of great players such as well-known goalkeeper [[Giuliano Sarti]], [[Sergio Cervato]], Francesco Rosella, [[Guido Gratton]], [[Giuseppe Chiappella]] and Aldo Scaramucci, but above all the attacking duo of Brazilian [[Júlio Botelho|Julinho]] and Argentinian [[Miguel Montuori]]. This team won Fiorentina's first ''[[scudetto]]'' (Italian championship) in [[Serie A 1955-56|1955–56]], 12 points ahead of second-place [[AC Milan|Milan]]. [[AC Milan|Milan]] beat Fiorentina to top spot the following year, but more significantly Fiorentina became the first Italian team to play in a [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] final, when a disputed penalty led to a 2–0 defeat at the hands of by [[Alfredo di Stéfano]]'s [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].
Fiorentina were runners-up again in the three subsequent seasons. In the [[Serie A 1960-61|1960–61]] season the club won the Coppa Italia again and was also successful in Europe, winning the first [[Cup Winners' Cup]] against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].

After several years of runner-up finishes, Fiorentina dropped away slightly in the 1960s, bouncing from 4th to 6th place, although the club won the Coppa Italia and the [[Mitropa Cup]] in 1966.

===Second ''scudetto'' and '70s===
[[Image:Antognoni.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Giancarlo Antognoni]], former captain of Fiorentina]]
While the 1960s did result in some trophies and good [[Serie A]] finishes for Fiorentina, nobody believed that the club could challenge for the title. The [[Serie A 1968-69|1968–69 season]] started with [[AC Milan|Milan]] as frontrunners, but on match day 7 they lost to [[Bologna FC|Bologna]] and were overtaken by [[Gigi Riva]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]].  Fiorentina, after an unimpressive start, then moved to the top of the [[Serie A]], but the first half of their season finished with a 2–2 draw against [[A.S. Varese 1910|Varese]], leaving Cagliari as outright league leader. The second half of the season was a three-way battle between the three contending teams, Milan, Cagliari and Fiorentina. [[AC Milan|Milan]] fell away, instead focusing their efforts on the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], and it seemed that Cagliari would retain top spot, but after losing against [[Juventus]], Fiorentina took over at the top. The team then won all of their remaining matches, beating rivals [[Juventus]] in [[Turin]] on the penultimate matchday to seal their second, and last, national title. In the European Cup competition the following year Fiorentina had some good results, including a win in the USSR against [[Dynamo Kyiv]], but they were eventually knocked out in the quarter finals after a 3–0 defeat in Glasgow to [[Celtic FC|Celtic]].

Viola players began the 1970s decade with ''Scudetto'' sewed on their breast, but the period was not especially fruitful for the team. After a 5th place finish in 1971, they finished in mid-table almost every year, even flirting with relegation in 1972 and 1978. The ''Viola'' did win the [[Anglo-Italian League Cup]] in 1974 and won the Coppa Italia again in 1975. The team consisted of young talents like Vincenzo Guerini and Moreno Roggi, who had the misfortune to suffer bad injuries, and above all [[Giancarlo Antognoni]], who would later become an idol to Fiorentina's fans.  The young average age of the players led to the team being called ''Fiorentina Ye-Ye''.

===Pontello era===
[[Image:Fiorentina-Circle-Logo.png|thumb|left|125px|The new team logo of the period]]
In 1980 Fiorentina was bought by Flavio Pontello, from a rich house-builder family. He quickly changed the team's anthem and logo, leading to some complaints by the fans, but he started to bring in high-quality players such as [[Francesco Graziani]] and [[Eraldo Pecci]] from [[Torino Calcio|Torino]], [[Daniel Bertoni]] from [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]], [[Daniele Massaro]] from [[AC Monza|Monza]] and a young [[Pietro Vierchowod]] from [[Sampdoria]]. The team was built around Giancarlo Antognoni, and in [[Serie A 1981-82]] Fiorentina were involved in an exciting duel with rival [[Juventus]]. After a bad injury to Antognoni, the league title was decided on the final day of the season, when Fiorentina were denied a goal against Cagliari and were unable to win. Juventus won the title with a disputed penalty, and the rivalry between the two teams erupted.

The following years were strange for Fiorentina, who vacillated between high finishes and relegation battles. Fiorentina also bought two interesting players, ''El Puntero'' [[Ramón Díaz]] and, most significantly, the young [[Roberto Baggio]].

In 1990 Fiorentina fought to avoid relegation right up until the final day of the season, but did reach the [[UEFA Cup]] final, where they again faced [[Juventus]]. The Turin team won the trophy, but Fiorentina's ''[[tifosi]]'' once again had real cause for complaint: the second leg of the final was played in [[Avellino]] (Fiorentina's home ground was suspended), a city with a lot of Juventus' fans, and [[Roberto Baggio]] was sold to the rival team on the day of the final.  Pontello, suffering from economic difficulties, was selling all the players and was forced to leave the club after serious riots in Florence's streets. The club was then acquired by the famous filmmaker [[Mario Cecchi Gori]].

===Cecchi Gori era: from Champions League to bankruptcy===
[[Image:Rui Costa.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Rui Costa]], one of the most prominent Fiorentina players of the 1990s]]
The first season under Cecchi Gori's ownership was one of stabilization, after which the new chairman started to sign some good players like [[Brian Laudrup]], [[Stefan Effenberg]], [[Francesco Baiano]] and, most importantly, [[Gabriel Batistuta]], who became an iconic player for the team during the 1990s. In 1993, however, [[Mario Cecchi Gori]] died and was succeeded as chairman by his son [[Vittorio Cecchi Gori]]. Despite a good start to the season, Vittorio Cecchi Gori fired the coach, [[Luigi Radice]],  after a defeat against [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1993/gennaio/04/Fiorentina_caduta_sugli_allori_co_0_9301043372.shtml From Corriere della Sera of 5 January 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced him with [[Aldo Agroppi]]. The results were dreadful: Fiorentina fell into the bottom half of the standings and were relegated on the last day of the season.

[[Claudio Ranieri]] was brought in as coach for the 1993–94 season, and that year Fiorentina dominated [[Serie B]] (second division). Upon their return to [[Serie A]], Ranieri put together a good team centred around new top scorer Batistuta, signing the young talent [[Manuel Rui Costa|Rui Costa]] from [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] and the new world champion Brazilian defender [[Márcio Roberto dos Santos|Márcio Santos]]. The former became an idol to Fiorentina fans, while the second disappointed and was sold after only a season.  Viola finished the season in 10th.

The following season Cecchi Gori bought other important players like [[Stefan Schwarz]]. The club again proved its mettle in cup competitions, winning the Coppa Italia against [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]], and finished joint 3rd in [[Serie A]]. In the summer, Fiorentina was the first non-national champion to win the [[Supercoppa Italiana]], defeating [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]] 2–1 at the [[San Siro]].

Fiorentina's 95–96 season was disappointing in the league, but they did reach the [[Cup Winners' Cup]] semi-final by beating [[Gloria Bistrita]], [[Sparta Prague]], and Benfica. The team lost the semi-final to the eventual winner of the competition, [[FC Barcelona]] (Away 1–1, Home 0–2). The season's main signings were [[Luis Oliveira|Luís Oliveira]] and [[Andrei Kanchelskis]], the latter of whom suffered a lot of injuries.

At the end of the season, Ranieri left Fiorentina for [[Valencia CF]], and Cecchi Gori appointed [[Alberto Malesani]]. Fiorentina played well but struggled against smaller teams, although they did manage to qualify for the [[UEFA Cup]]. Malesani left Fiorentina after only a season and was succeeded by [[Giovanni Trapattoni]]. With Trapattoni's expert guidance and Batistuta's goals, Fiorentina challenged for the title in [[Serie A 1998-99|1998–99]] but finished the season in third, earning them qualification for the [[UEFA Champions League]]. The following year was disappointing in [[Serie A]], but Viola played some historical matches in Champions League, beating [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 1–0 at the old [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 2–0 in [[Florence]]. They were ultimately eliminated in the second group stage.

At the end of the season Trapattoni left the club and was replaced by Turkish coach [[Fatih Terim]]. More significantly, however, Batistuta was sold to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], who eventually won the title the following year. Fiorentina played well in [[Serie A 2000-01|2000–01]] and stayed in the top half of [[Serie A]], despite the resignation of Terim and the arrival of [[Roberto Mancini]]. They also won the Coppa Italia for the sixth and last time.

2001 heralded major changes for Fiorentina, as the terrible state of the club's finances was revealed: they were unable to pay wages and had debts of around USD 50 million. The club's owner, [[Vittorio Cecchi Gori]], was able to raise some more money, but even this soon proved to be insufficient resources to sustain the club. Fiorentina were relegated at the end of the [[Serie A 2001-02|2001–02]] season and went into judicially controlled administration in June 2002. This form of [[bankruptcy]] (sports companies cannot exactly fail in this way in Italy, but they can suffer a similar procedure) meant that the club was refused a place in Serie B for the [[Serie A 2002-03|2002–03]] season, and as a result effectively ceased to exist.

===Della Valle era===
The club was promptly re-established in August 2002 as '''Associazione Calcio Fiorentina e Florentia Viola''' with shoe and leather entrepreneur Diego Della Valle as new owner, and was admitted into [[Serie C2]], the fourth tier of Italian football. The only player to remain at the club in its new incarnation was [[Angelo Di Livio]], whose commitment to club's cause further endeared him to the fans. Helped by Di Livio and 30-goal striker [[Christian Riganò]], the club won its [[Serie C2]] group with considerable ease, which would normally have led to a promotion to [[Serie C1]]. However, due to the bizarre [[Calcio_Catania#Decline_and_revival|''Caso Catania'']] (Catania Case) the club skipped [[Serie C1]] and was admitted into [[Serie B]], something that was only made possible by the [[Italian Football Federation]]'s decision to resolve the Catania situation by increasing the number of teams in [[Serie B]] from 20 to 24 and promoting Fiorentina for &quot;sports merits&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2003/h/sezioni/sport/calcio/calciomercato/ventiquattro/ventiquattro/ventiquattro.html |publisher=La Repubblica |language=Italian |title=Serie B a 24 squadre. C'è anche la Fiorentina |date=20 August 2003 |accessdate=4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2003 off-season, the club also bought back the right to use the Fiorentina name and the famous shirt design, and re-incorporated itself as '''ACF Fiorentina'''.

[[Image:Cesare Prandelli.JPG|thumb|200px|left|[[Cesare Prandelli]], the club's longest-serving manager (2005–2010)]]
The club's unusual double promotion was controversial, with some suggesting that Fiorentina did not deserve it. However, the club remained in [[Serie B]] and managed to finish the [[Serie B 2003-04|2003–04]] season in sixth place. This put the Viola in a two-legged [[Playoffs#Association football|playoff]] against [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] (the 15th-place finisher in [[Serie A]]) for a top-flight place during the next season. Fiorentina completed their remarkable comeback by winning the match 2–1 on aggregate, with both goals scored by [[Enrico Fantini]], to gain promotion back to [[Serie A]]. In their first season back in Italian football's top flight the club struggled to avoid relegation, only securing survival on the last day of the season and only avoiding a relegation playoff based on their head-to-head record against [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] and [[Parma F.C.|Parma]]. In 2005, Della Valle decided to appoint [[Pantaleo Corvino]] as new sports director.

[[Image:Giladrino Lazio Fiorentina.JPG|thumb|120px|[[Alberto Gilardino]] serves as the ''prima punta'' of the Tuscany-based outfit for the last few years.]]
In [[Serie A 2005-06|2005–06]], Fiorentina hired [[Cesare Prandelli]] as their new head coach and made several signings during the summer transfer market, most notably [[U.S. Città di Palermo|Palermo]]'s 20-goal striker [[Luca Toni]] and French goalkeeper [[Sébastien Frey]]. The combination of captain [[Dario Dainelli]] and [[Czech national football team|Czech international]] regular [[Tomáš Ujfaluši]] in defence, [[Cristian Brocchi]] as midfield ball winner, [[Martin Jorgensen]] on the wing, [[Stefano Fiore]] as playmaker and key marksman Toni, with Frey in goal, proved to be an outstanding force in [[Serie A]], giving them a fourth place finish with 74 points and qualifying the team for the third qualifying round of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. Toni scored 31 goals in just 34 appearances, the first player to pass the 30-goal mark since [[Antonio Valentin Angelillo]] in the [[Serie A 1958-59|1958–59]] season, for which he was awarded the [[European Golden Boot]].

On 14 July 2006, however, Fiorentina were relegated to Serie B due to their involvement in the [[2006 Serie A scandal|2006 Serie A match fixing scandal]] and given a 12-point penalty. The team was reinstated to the Serie A on appeal, but with a 19-point penalty for the 2006–07 season. The team's [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07|UEFA Champions League]] place was also rescinded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/5164194.stm|author=BBC|title=Italian trio relegated to Serie B | date=14 July 2006 | accessdate=1 January 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the start of the season Fiorentina's penalization was reduced from 19 points to 15 on appeal to the Italian courts.

Despite starting the 2006–07 season with a 15-point penalty, Fiorentina nevertheless managed to secure a place in the 2007–08 edition of the UEFA Cup. The combination of Toni and [[Adrian Mutu]] proved to be one of [[Serie A]]'s most proficient strike partnerships, scoring 31 goals between them.

While many doubted the potential of the ''Viola'' in the [[Serie A 2007-08|2007–08]] season due to Toni's departure, Fiorentina had a sensational start to the season and were tipped by [[Marcello Lippi]] and other prominent names in football as a surprise challenger for the ''[[Scudetto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=472919|publisher=Goal.com|title=Lippi Tips Fiorentina For Surprise Scudetto Challenge|date=11 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this form tailed off towards the middle of the season, with several disappointing losses in connection with a grievous family loss suffered by club manager Prandelli. The club reached the semi-final of the [[UEFA Cup 2007-08|UEFA Cup]], where they were ultimately defeated by [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] on penalties after two 0–0 ties. The season ended on a high note as Fiorentina defeated Torino 1–0 on the final day of the season to secure a [[UEFA Champions League]] spot at the expense of [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]]. That campaign ended in the group stages, however, with the club finishing third and securing a path to the [[UEFA Cup]] instead.

The 2008–09 season continued this success, a fourth place finish assuring Fiorentina's spot in 2010's Champions League playoffs. The ''Viola'' also took part to the [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League]], reaching the group phase after defeating [[Slavia Prague]] in the third qualifying round, but the club did not manage to qualify to the knockout rounds and was successively eliminated from the [[2008–09 UEFA Cup]] too. In contrast to their Champions League campaign, ''La Viola'' remained in the top tier of the domestic league.

A reversal of trends took place in the ongoing 2009–10 season, as the club saw a dip in their Serie A form, yet proved itself to be a surprise dark horse in Europe. Fiorentina started their domestic campaign strongly, trailing leaders [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter]] along with [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] earlier in the season, but steadily lost momentum and slipped to mid-table positions at the latter half of the season. In Europe, the team got past [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting]] in the qualifying rounds and drawn a tight group consisting of [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Debreceni VSC|Debrecen]]. Losing their first away fixture against Lyon, many dismissed their chances of getting through, but the Italians staged a comeback with winning all their remaining matches, which included defeating Liverpool home and away. The Viola qualified as group champions, but eventually succumbed to [[F.C. Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] due to away goals, in a controversial double encounter involving what was considered as poor refereeing. [[Tom Henning Øvrebø]], who led the first leg in Germany, was then lambasted by journalists and Italian footballing figures for his decisions, most notably allowing a [[Miroslav Klose]] offside goal (that eventually fired Bayern through the next round), calling into attention the possible implementation of video replays in football. Fiorentina also maintained a strong [[Coppa Italia]] campaign, reaching the semifinal before being defeated by the eventual winner Inter. The domestic season ended on a sour note as the Viola failed to reach a European position. During this period, on 24 September 2009, Andrea Della Valle resigned from his position as chairman of ACF Fiorentina, and announced all duties would be temporarily transferred to Mario Cognini, Fiorentina's vice president until a permanent position could be filled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Fiorentina/24-09-2009/della-valle-si-dimesso--501388850534.shtml|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|title=Fiorentina senza presidente Della Valle si è dimesso|date=24 September 2009 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October 2009, Andrea Della Valle stepped down as chairman. The position is now vacant.

In June 2010 the Viola bid farewell to long-time manager Prandelli (by then the longest-serving coach in the team's history), who was departing to coach the [[Italy National Football Team|national team]], with [[Calcio Catania|Catania]]'s young [[Siniša Mihajlović]] replacing him.

==Social identity==
===Badge===
[[Image:Fleur de lis of Florence.svg|thumb|100px|The badge used by Florentia Viola]]
The official emblem of the city of [[Florence]], a red [[fleur-de-lis]] on a white field, has been pivotal in the all-round symbolism of the club.

Over the course of the club's history they have had several badge changes, all of which incorporated Florence's [[fleur-de-lis]] in some way.&lt;ref name=&quot;logo&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.weltfussballarchiv.com/Vereinsprofilnew.php?ID=3001|publisher=Weltfussballarchiv.com|title=ACF Fiorentina|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first one was nothing more than the city's coat of arms, a white shield with the red fleur-de-lis inside. It was soon changed to a very stylized fleur-de-lis, always red, and sometimes even without the white field. The most common symbol, adopted for about twenty years, had been a white [[lozenge]] with the flower inside. During the season they were Italian champions, the lozenge disappeared and the flower was overlapped with the [[scudetto]].

The logo introduced by owner Flavio Pontello in 1980 was particularly distinct, consisting  of one half of the city of Florence's emblem and one half of the letter &quot;F&quot;, for Fiorentina. People disliked it when it was introduced, believing it was a commercial decision and, above all, because the symbol bore more of a resemblance to a [[halberd]] than a fleur-de-lis.&lt;ref name=&quot;logo&quot;/&gt;

Today's logo is a kite shaped double [[lozenge]] bordered in gold. The outer lozenge has a purple background with the letters &quot;AC&quot; in white and the letter &quot;F&quot; in red, standing for the club's name. The inner lozenge is white with a gold border and the red fleur-de-lis of Florence.&lt;ref name=&quot;logo&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.weltfussballarchiv.com/Vereinsprofil.php?ID=3001&amp;lang=en|publisher=Weltfussballarchiv.com|title=ACF Fiorentina|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This logo had been in use from 1992 to 2002, but after the financial crisis and resurrection of the club the new one couldn't use the same logo. Florence's ''[[comune]]'' instead granted Florentia Viola use of the stylized coat of arms used in other city documents. Diego Della Valle acquired the current logo the following year in a judicial auction for a fee of [[euro|€]]2.5 million, making it the most expensive logo in Italian football.

===Kit and colours===
When Fiorentina was founded in 1926, the players wore red and white halved shirts derived from the colour of the city emblem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.comuni-italiani.it/048/017/stemma.html|publisher=Comuni-Italiani|title=Stemma Comune di Firenze|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more well-known and highly distinctive purple kit was adopted in 1928 and has been used ever since, giving rise to the nickname ''La Viola'' (&quot;The Purple (team)&quot;). Tradition has it that Fiorentina got their purple kit by mistake after an accident washing the old red and white coloured kits in the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070222090943AAkaMg8|publisher=Yahoo.it|title=Perchè a Firenze hanno una maglia color viola, che in tutta Italia è il colore del lutto?|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The away kit has always been predominantly white, sometimes with purple and red elements, sometimes all-white. The shorts had been purple when the home kit was with white shorts. Fiorentina's third kit was first one in the 1995–96 season and it was all-red with purple borders and two [[lily|lilies]] on the shoulders. The red shirt has been the most worn 3rd shirt by Fiorentina, although they also wore rare yellow shirts ('97–'98, '99–'00 and '10–'11) and a sterling version, mostly in the [[Coppa Italia]], in 2000–01.

'''Afrobeat''' is a combination of traditional [[Yoruba music]], [[jazz]], [[highlife]], [[funk]] and [[chant]]ed vocals,&lt;ref name=&quot;rebel&quot;/&gt; fused with [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] and [[vocal]] styles, popularised in [[Africa]] in the 1970s. Its main creator was the [[Nigeria]]n multi-[[Musician|instrumentalist]] and [[bandleader]] [[Fela Kuti]], who gave it its name,&lt;ref name=&quot;rebel&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grass  |first1=Randall F. |last2= |first2= |year= |title=Fela Anikulapo-Kuti: The Art of an Afrobeat Rebel |journal=The Drama Review: TDR |publisher=MIT Press |volume=30 |issue= |pages=131–148 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1145717 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who used it to revolutionise musical structure as well as the political context in his native Nigeria. It was Kuti who coined the term &quot;afrobeat&quot; upon his return from a U.S. tour with his group Nigeria '70 (formerly Koola Lobitos). Afrobeat features [[chant]]s, [[call-and-response]] vocals, and complex, interacting rhythms.&lt;ref name=&quot;rebel&quot;/&gt;

The new sound hailed from a club that he established called the Afro-Shrine. Upon arriving in Nigeria, Kuti also changed the name of his group to [[Africa '70]]. The band maintained a five-year residency in the Afro-Shrine from 1970 to 1975 while afrobeat thrived among Nigerian youth. Afrobeat is now one of the most recognizable music genres in the world and has influenced as many Western musicians as it has African ones with its exuberant style and [[polyrhythm]]s.

==Origins==
Afrobeat originated from the southern part of [[Nigeria]] in the 1960s where Kuti experimented with many different forms of contemporary music of the time. Prevalent in his and Lagbaja's music are native African harmonies and rhythms, taking different elements and combining, modernizing and improvising upon them. [[Politics]] are essential to afrobeat, since founder Kuti used social criticism to pave the way for social change. His message can be described as confrontational and controversial, which can be related to the political climate of most of the African countries in the 1960s, many of which were dealing with political injustice and military corruption while recovering from the transition from colonial governments to self-determination. As the genre spread throughout the African continent many bands took up the style. The recordings of these bands and their songs were rarely heard or exported outside the originating countries but many can now be found on [[compilation album]]s and [[CD]]s from specialist record shops.

==Instrumentation==
Big band (15 to 30 pieces: Fela-era afrobeat) and energetic performances

*Lead vocals (may play sax/key solos as well)
*Chorus vocals (may include horn players)
*Rhythm guitar(s) (plays funk strumming pattern)
*[[Tenor guitar]] (plays a finger-picked [[ostinato]] groove)
*[[Bass guitar]]
*[[Drum set]], generally in the form [[polyrhythmic]] percussion
*[[Saxophone]](s)
*[[Trumpet]](s)
*[[Trombone]](s)
*[[Organ (music)|Organ]]/keyboards
*Rhythm [[conga]] #1
*Rhythm [[conga]] #2
*Solo (lead) [[conga]]
*[http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2414/2789/1600/Blog_akuba.jpg Akuba]: a set of 3 small stick-hit congas (play flourishes/solos, and ostinatos). Also mistakenly called &quot;[[gbedu]]&quot; (gbedu is the name of a large ceremonial drum).
*&quot;Sticks&quot;/[[claves]] (plays ostinato)
*[[Shekere]]

==Influence==
Many [[jazz]] musicians have been attracted to afrobeat. From [[Roy Ayers]] in the 1970s to [[Randy Weston]] in the 1990s, there have been collaborations which have resulted in albums such as ''Africa: Centre of the World'' by Roy Ayers, released on the [[Polydor Records|Polydore]] label in 1981. In 1994 [[Branford Marsalis]], the American jazz saxophonist, included samples of Fela's &quot;Beast of No Nation&quot; on his ''[[Buckshot LeFonque (album)|Buckshot LeFonque]]'' album. The new generation of [[Disc Jockey|DJs]] and musicians of the 2000s who have fallen in love with both Kuti's material and other rare releases have made compilations and [[remix]]es of these recordings, thus re-introducing the genre to new generations of listeners and fans of [[afropop]] and [[groove]].

Afrobeat has profoundly influenced important contemporary producers and musicians like [[Brian Eno]] and [[David Byrne]], who credit Fela Kuti as an essential muse. Both worked on [[Talking Heads]]' highly-acclaimed 1980 album ''[[Remain In Light]]'' which brought polyrhythmic afrobeat influences to Western music. More recently, the horn section of [[Antibalas]] have been guest musicians on [[TV On The Radio]]'s highly acclaimed 2008 album ''[[Dear Science]]'', as well as on British band [[Foals]]' 2008 album, ''[[Antidotes]]''. Some Afrobeat influence can also be found in the music of [[Vampire Weekend]] and [[Paul Simon]].

==Afrobeat musicians==
*[[Fela Kuti]]&lt;ref name=&quot;rebel&quot;/&gt;
*[[Sonny Okosun]]&lt;ref name=&quot;rebel&quot;/&gt;
*[[Tony Allen (musician)|Tony Allen]]&lt;ref name=&quot;rebel&quot;/&gt;

===Today===
There are several active afrobeat bands worldwide today. Afrobeat today is often mixed with other genres, such as [[hip hop]], [[makossa]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[yahoozee]] and galala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.analysisworldmusic.com/images/1aawmoikelomepaper.pdf|title=''Stylistic analysis of afrobeat music of Fela Anikulapo Kuti''|publisher=analysisworldmusic.com|accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[number theory]], an '''arithmetic''' (or '''arithmetical''') '''function''' is a real or complex valued [[Function (mathematics)|function]] ''ƒ''(''n'') defined on the set of [[natural number]]s (i.e. [[positive number|positive]] [[integer]]s) that &quot;expresses some arithmetical property of ''n''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, intro. to Ch. XVI&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an arithmetic function is the non-principal character (mod 4) defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \chi(n) =\left(\frac{-4}{n}\right)= \left\{\begin{array}{cl} 0 &amp; \mbox{if } n \mbox{ is even}, \\ 1 &amp; \mbox{if } n \equiv 1 \mod 4, \\ -1 &amp; \mbox{if } n \equiv 3 \mod 4.
\end{array}\right. &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; where &lt;math&gt;(\tfrac{-4}{n})\ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker symbol]].

To emphasize that they are being thought of as functions rather than sequences, values of an arithmetic function are usually denoted by ''a''(''n'') rather than ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

There is a larger class of number-theoretic functions that do not fit the above definition, e.g. the [[Prime counting function|prime-counting functions]]. This article provides links to functions of both classes.

==Notation==

&lt;math&gt;\sum_p f(p)\;&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\prod_p f(p)\;&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; mean that the sum or product is over all prime numbers:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_p f(p) = f(2) + f(3) + f(5) + \cdots&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\prod_p f(p)= f(2)f(3)f(5)\ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\sum_{p^k} f(p)\;&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\prod_{p^k} f(p)\;&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; mean that the sum or product is over all prime powers with strictly positive exponent (so 1  is not counted):

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{p^k} f(p) = f(2) + f(3) + f(4) +f(5) +f(7)+f(8)+f(9)+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d|n} f(d)\;&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\prod_{d|n} f(d)\;&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; mean that the sum or product is over all positive divisors of ''n'', including 1 and ''n''. E.g., if ''n'' = 12,

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{d|12} f(d) = f(1)f(2) f(3)  f(4)  f(6)  f(12).\ &lt;/math&gt;

The notations can be combined: &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\sum_{p|n} f(p)\;&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\prod_{p|n} f(p)\;&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; mean that the sum or product is over all prime divisors of ''n''. E.g., if ''n'' = 18,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{p|18} f(p) = f(2) + f(3),\ &lt;/math&gt;

and similarly &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\sum_{p^k|n} f(p^k)\;&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\prod_{p^k|n} f(p^k)\;&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; mean that the sum or product is over all prime powers dividing ''n''. E.g., if ''n'' = 24,

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{p^k|24} f(p^k) = f(2) f(3)  f(4) f(8).\ &lt;/math&gt;

== Multiplicative and additive functions ==

An arithmetic function ''a'' is

* '''completely additive''' if ''a''(''mn'') = ''a''(''m'') + ''a''(''n'') for all natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'';

* [[Completely multiplicative function|'''completely multiplicative''']] if ''a''(''mn'') = ''a''(''m'')''a''(''n'') for all natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'';

Two whole numbers ''m'' and ''n'' are called [[coprime]] if their [[greatest common divisor]] is 1; i.e., if there is no [[prime number]] that divides both of them.

Then an arithmetic function ''a'' is

* [[Additive function|'''additive''']] if ''a''(''mn'') = ''a''(''m'') + ''a''(''n'') for all coprime natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'';

* [[Multiplicative function|'''multiplicative''']] if ''a''(''mn'') = ''a''(''m'')''a''(''n'') for all coprime natural numbers ''m'' and ''n''.

==Ω(''n''), ω(''n''), ν&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')  - prime power decomposition ==

The [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] states that any positive integer ''n'' can be represented uniquely as a product of powers of primes: &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; n = p_1^{a_1}\ldots p_k^{a_k} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; where  ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ... &lt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are primes and the ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' are positive integers. (1 is given by the empty product.)

It is often convenient to write this as an infinite product over all the primes, where all but a finite number have a zero exponent. Define '''ν&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')''' as the exponent of the highest power of the prime ''p'' that divides ''n''. I.e. if ''p'' is one of the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; then ν&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, otherwise it is zero. Then

:&lt;Math&gt;n=\prod_p p^{\nu_p(n)}.&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of the above the functions ω and  Ω are defined by

:'''[[Prime factor|ω(''n'')]] = ''k''''',
:'''Ω(''n'') = a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; +    a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + a&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

To avoid repetition, whenever possible formulas for the functions listed in this article are given in terms of ''n'' and the corresponding ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ω, and Ω.

==Multiplicative functions==
===σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''), τ(''n''), ''d''(''n'') - divisor sums===

'''[[divisor function|σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')]]''' is the sum of the ''k''th powers of the positive divisors of ''n'', including 1 and ''n'', where ''k'' is a complex number.

'''σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')''', the sum of the (positive) divisors of ''n'', is usually denoted by '''σ(''n'')'''.

Since a positive number to the zero power is one, '''σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')''' is therefore the number of (positive) divisors of ''n''; it is usually denoted by '''''d''(''n'')''' or '''τ(''n'')''' (for the German ''Teiler'' = divisors).

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_k(n) = \prod_{i=1}^{\omega(n)} \frac{p_{i}^{(a_{i}+1)k}-1}{p_{i}^k-1}
=
\prod_{i=1}^{\omega(n)} (1 + p_{i}^k + p_{i}^{2k} + \cdots + p_{i}^{a_i k}).
&lt;/math&gt;

Setting ''k'' = 0 in the second product gives

:&lt;math&gt;\tau(n) = d(n) = (1 + a_{1})(1+a_{2})\ldots(1+a_{\omega(n)}).&lt;/math&gt;

===φ(''n'') - Euler totient function===

'''[[Euler totient function|φ(''n'')]]''', the Euler totient function, is the number of positive integers not greater than ''n'' that are coprime to ''n''.

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(n) = n \prod_{p|n} \left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)
=n \left(\frac{p_1 - 1}{p_1}\right)\left(\frac{p_2 - 1}{p_2}\right) \ldots \left(\frac{p_{\omega(n)} - 1}{p_{\omega(n)}}\right)
.&lt;/math&gt;

===μ(''n'') - Möbius function===

'''[[Möbius function|μ(''n'')]]''', the Möbius function, is important because of the [[Möbius inversion]] formula. See [[#Dirichlet convolution|Dirichlet convolution]], below.

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(n)=\begin{cases} (-1)^{\omega(n)}=(-1)^{\Omega(n)} &amp;\mbox{if }\; \omega(n) = \Omega(n)\\
0&amp;\mbox{if }\;\omega(n) \ne \Omega(n).\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

This implies that μ(1) = 1. (Because Ω(1) =  ω(1) = 0.)

===τ(''n'') - Ramanujan tau function===

'''[[Tau-function|τ(''n'')]]''', the Ramanujan tau function, is defined by its [[generating function]] identity:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n\geq 1}\tau(n)q^n=q\prod_{n\geq 1}(1-q^n)^{24}.&lt;/math&gt;

Although it is hard to say exactly what  &quot;arithmetical property of ''n''&quot; it &quot;expresses&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, ''Ramanujan'', § 10.2&lt;/ref&gt; (τ(''n'') is (2π)&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; times the ''n''th Fourier coefficient in the [[Modular_form#q-expansion|q-expansion]] of the [[Modular_discriminant#Modular_discriminant|modular discriminant]] function)&lt;ref&gt;Apostol, ''Modular Functions ...'', § 1.15, Ch. 4, and ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; it is included among the arithmetical functions because it is multiplicative and it occurs in identities involving certain σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') functions (because these are also coefficients in the expansion of [[modular form]]s).

===''c''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') - Ramanujan's sum ===

'''[[Ramanujan's sum|''c''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')]]''', Ramanujan's sum, is the sum of the ''n''th powers of the primitive ''q''th [[roots of unity]]:

:&lt;math&gt;c_q(n)=
\sum_{\stackrel{1\le a\le q}{ \gcd(a,q)=1}}
e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{a}{q} n}
.
&lt;/math&gt;

Even though it is defined as a sum of complex numbers (irrational for most values of ''q''), it is an integer. For a fixed value of ''n'' it is multiplicative in ''q'':

:'''If ''q'' and ''r'' are coprime''', &lt;math&gt;c_q(n)c_r(n)=c_{qr}(n).\;
&lt;/math&gt;

Many of the functions mentioned in this article have expansions as series involving these sums; see the article [[Ramanujan's sum]] for examples.

==Completely multiplicative functions==
===λ(''n'') - Liouville function===

'''[[Liouville function|λ(''n'')]]''', the Liouville function, is  defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda (n) = (-1)^{\Omega(n)}.\;&lt;/math&gt;

===χ(''n'') - characters===

All '''[[Dirichlet character]]s χ(''n'')''' are completely multiplicative; e.g. the non-principal character (mod 4) defined in the introduction, or the principal character (mod ''n'') defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \chi_0(k) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \mbox{if } \gcd(k,n) = 1, \\ 0 &amp; \mbox{if } \gcd(k,n) \ne 1.
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

==Additive functions==
===ω(''n'') - distinct prime divisors ===

'''ω(''n'')''', defined above as the number of distinct primes dividing ''n'', is additive

==Completely additive functions==
===Ω(''n'') - prime divisors===

'''[[Prime factor|Ω(''n'')]]''', defined above as the number of prime factors of ''n'' counted with multiplicities, is completely additive.

===ν&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') - prime power dividing ''n''===

For a fixed prime ''p'', '''ν&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')''', defined above as the exponent of the largest power of ''p'' dividing ''n'', is completely additive.

==Neither multiplicative nor additive==
===π(''x''), Π(''x''), θ(''x''), ψ(''x'') - prime count functions===
Unlike the other functions listed in this article, these are defined for non-negative real (not just integer) arguments. They are used in the statement and proof of the [[prime number theorem]].

'''[[prime counting function|π(''x'')]]''', the prime counting function, is the number of primes not exceeding ''x''.

:&lt;math&gt;\pi(x) = \sum_{p\le x}1
&lt;/math&gt;

A related function counts prime powers with weight 1 for primes, 1/2 for their squares, 1/3 for cubes, ...

:&lt;math&gt;\Pi(x) = \sum_{p^k\le x}\frac{1}{k}.
&lt;/math&gt;

'''[[Chebyshev function|θ(x)]]''' and '''ψ(x)''', the Chebyshev functions
are defined as sums of the natural logarithms of the primes not exceeding ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt;\vartheta(x)=\sum_{p\le x} \log p,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \psi(x) = \sum_{p^k\le x} \log p.&lt;/math&gt;

===Λ(''n'') - von Mangoldt function===

'''[[von Mangoldt function|Λ(''n'')]]''', the von Mangoldt function, is 0 unless the argument is a prime power, in which case it is the natural log of the prime:

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(n) = \begin{cases}\log p &amp;\mbox{if } n = 2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,13,16,\ldots=p^k \mbox{ is a prime power}\\
0&amp;\mbox{if } n=1,6,10,12,14,15,18,20,21,\dots \;\;\;\;\mbox{ is not a prime power}.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

===''p''(''n'') - partition function===
'''[[partition function (number theory)|''p''(''n'')]]''', the partition function, is the number of ways of representing ''n'' as a sum of positive integers, where two representations with the same summands in a different order are not counted as being different:

:&lt;math&gt;
p(n) = |\left\{ (a_1, a_2,\dots a_k): 0 &lt; a_1 \le a_2 \le \ldots \le a_k\; \and \;n=a_1+a_2+\cdots +a_k  \right\}|.
&lt;/math&gt;

===λ(''n'') - Carmichael function===

'''[[Carmichael function|λ(''n'')]]''', the Carmichael function, is the smallest positive number such that &lt;math&gt;a^{\lambda(n)}\equiv 1 \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; for all ''a'' coprime to ''n''. Equivalently, it is the [[least common multiple]] of the orders of the elements of the [[Multiplicative group of integers modulo n|multiplicative group of integers modulo ''n'']].

For powers of odd primes and for 2 and 4, λ(''n'') is equal to the Euler totient function of ''n''; for powers of 2 greater than 4 it is equal to one half of the Euler totient function of ''n'':

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda(n) =
\begin{cases}
\;\;\phi(n) &amp;\mbox{if }n = 2,3,4,5,7,9,11,13,17,19,23,25,27,\dots\\
\tfrac12\phi(n)&amp;\mbox{if }n=8,16,32,64,\dots
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

and for general ''n'' it is the least common multiple of λ of each of the prime power factors of ''n'':

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda(p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2} \dots p_{\omega(n)}^{a_{\omega(n)}}) = \operatorname{lcm}[\lambda(p_1^{a_1}),\;\lambda(p_2^{a_2}),\dots,\lambda(p_{\omega(n)}^{a_{\omega(n)}}) ].

&lt;/math&gt;

===''h''(''n'') - Class number===

'''[[Ideal class group|''h''(''n'')]]''', the class number function, is the order of the ideal class group of an algebraic extension of the rationals with [[discriminant]] ''n''. The notation is ambiguous, as there are in general many extensions with the same discriminant. See [[quadratic field]] and [[cyclotomic field]] for classical examples.

===''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') - Sum of ''k'' squares===

''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') is the number of ways ''n'' can be represented as the sum of ''k'' squares, where representations that differ only in the order of the summands or in the signs of the square roots are counted as different.

:&lt;math&gt;r_k(n) = |\{(a_1, a_2,\dots,a_k):n=a_1^2+a_2^2+\cdots+a_k^2\}|
&lt;/math&gt;

== Summation functions ==

Given an arithmetic function ''a(n)'', its '''summation function''' ''A(x)'' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt; A(x) := \sum_{n \le x} a(n) .&lt;/math&gt;
''A'' can be regarded as a function of a real variable. Given a positive integer ''m'', ''A'' is constant along [[open interval]]s ''m'' &lt; ''x'' &lt; ''m'' + 1, and has a [[Classification of discontinuities|jump discontinuity]] at each integer for which ''a(m)'' ≠ 0.

Since such functions are often represented by series and integrals, to achieve pointwise convergence it is usual to define the value at the discontinuities as the average of the values to the left and right:

:&lt;math&gt; A_0(m) := \frac12\left(\sum_{n &lt; m} a(n) +\sum_{n \le m} a(n)\right) = A(m) - \frac12 a(m) .&lt;/math&gt;

Individual values of arithmetic functions may fluctuate wildly - as in most of the above examples. Summation functions &quot;smooth out&quot; these fluctuations. In some cases it may be possible to find [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic behaviour]] for the summation function for large ''x''.

A classical example of this phenomenon&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, §§ 18.1–18.2&lt;/ref&gt; is given by ''d''(''n''), the number of divisors of ''n'':

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty}d(n) = 2
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{\log d(n) \log\log n}{\log n} = \log 2
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{d(1) + d(2)+ \cdots +d(n)}{\log(1) + \log(2)+ \cdots +\log(n)} = 1.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Dirichlet convolution ==

Given an arithmetic function ''a(n)'', let ''F&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(s)'', for complex ''s'', be the function defined by the corresponding [[Dirichlet series]] (where it [[Convergent series|converges]]):&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, § 17.6, show how the theory of generating functions can be constructed in a purely formal manner with no attention paid to convergence.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; F_a(s) := \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a(n)}{n^s} .&lt;/math&gt;
''F&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(s)'' is called a [[generating function]] of ''a(n)''. The simplest such series, corresponding to the constant function ''a''(''n'') = 1 for all ''n'', is ς(''s'') the [[Riemann zeta function]].

The generating function of the Möbius function is the inverse of the zeta function:

:&lt;math&gt;
\zeta(s)\,\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}=1, \;\;\mathfrak{R} \,s &gt;0.
&lt;/math&gt;

Consider two arithmetic functions ''a'' and ''b'' and their respective generating functions ''F&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(s)'' and ''F&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(s)''. The product ''F&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(s)F&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(s)'' can be computed as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; F_a(s)F_b(s) = \left( \sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\frac{a(m)}{m^s} \right)\left( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{b(n)}{n^s} \right) . &lt;/math&gt;

It is a straightforward exercise to show that if ''c''(''n'') is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; c(n) := \sum_{ij = n} a(i)b(j) = \sum_{i|n}a(i)b\left(\frac{n}{i}\right) , &lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;F_c(s) =F_a(s) F_b(s).\;
&lt;/math&gt;

This function ''c'' is called the [[Dirichlet convolution]] of ''a'' and ''b'', and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;a*b&lt;/math&gt;.

A particularly important case is convolution with the constant function ''a''(''n'') = 1 for all ''n'', corresponding to multiplying the generating function by the zeta function:

:&lt;math&gt;
g(n) = \sum_{d|n}f(d).\;
&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by the inverse of the zeta function gives the [[Möbius inversion]] formula:

:&lt;math&gt;
f(n) = \sum_{d|n}\mu\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)g(d).
&lt;/math&gt;

If ''f'' is multiplicative, then so is ''g''. If ''f'' is completely multiplicative, then ''g'' is multiplicative, but may or may not be completely multiplicative. The article [[Multiplicative_function#The_Dirichlet_convolution_of_two_multiplicative_functions_is_multiplicative|multiplicative function]] has a short proof.

==Relations among the functions==

There are a great many formulas connecting arithmetical functions with each other and with the other functions of analysis -  in fact, a large part of elementary and analytic number theory is a detailed study of these relations.

Here are a few examples:

===Dirichlet convolutions===

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{\delta\mid n}\mu(\delta)=
\sum_{\delta\mid n}\lambda\left(\frac{n}{\delta}\right)|\mu(\delta)|=
\begin{cases}
&amp;1\mbox{ if } n=1\\
&amp;0\mbox{ if } n\ne1.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; where λ is the Liouville function. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, Thm. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{\delta\mid n}\varphi(\delta)=

&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, Thm. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)=\sum_{\delta\mid n}\mu\left(\frac{n}{\delta}\right)\delta=n\sum_{\delta\mid n}\frac{\mu(\delta)}{\delta}.
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  Möbius inversion

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{\delta\mid n}\varphi(\delta)d\left(\frac{n}{\delta}\right)=
\sigma(n).
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, Thm. 288–290&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{\delta\mid n}|\mu(\delta)|=
2^{\omega(n)}.
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, Thm. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;|\mu(n)|=\sum_{\delta\mid n}\mu\left(\frac{n}{\delta}\right)2^{\omega(\delta)}.
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  Möbius inversion

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{\delta\mid n}2^{\omega(\delta)}=
d(n^2).
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

::&lt;math&gt;2^{\omega(n)}=\sum_{\delta\mid n}\mu\left(\frac{n}{\delta}\right)d(\delta^2).
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  Möbius inversion

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{\delta\mid n}d(\delta^2)=
d^2(n).
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

::&lt;math&gt;d(n^2)=\sum_{\delta\mid n}\mu\left(\frac{n}{\delta}\right)d^2(\delta).
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  Möbius inversion

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{\delta\mid n}d\left(\frac{n}{\delta}\right)2^{\omega(\delta)}=

&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{\delta\mid n}\lambda(\delta)=\begin{cases}
&amp;1\mbox{ if } n \mbox{ is a square }\\
&amp;0\mbox{ if } n \mbox{ is not  square.}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  where λ is the [[Liouville function]].

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{\delta\mid n}\Lambda(\delta)=
\log n.
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, Thm. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(n)=\sum_{\delta\mid n}\mu\left(\frac{n}{\delta}\right)\log(\delta).
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  Möbius inversion

===Sums of squares===

:&lt;math&gt;
\mbox{If }k \ge 4,\;\;\; r_k(n) &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ([[Lagrange's four-square theorem]]).

:&lt;math&gt;
r_2(n) = 4\sum_{d|n}\chi(d),\;&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; where χ is the non-principal character (mod 4) defined in the introduction.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, Thm. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
r_4(n) =
8 \sum_{\stackrel{d\,|\,n}{ 4\, \nmid \,d}}d =
8 (2+(-1)^n)\sum_{\stackrel{d\,|\,n}{ 2\, \nmid \,d}}d =
\begin{cases}
8\sigma(n)&amp;\mbox{if } n \mbox{ is odd }\\
24\sigma\left(\frac{n}{2^{\nu}}\right)&amp;\mbox{if } n \mbox{ is even }
\end{cases},
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; where '''ν = ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')'''. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, Thm. 386&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, ''Ramanujan'', eqs 9.1.2, 9.1.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koblitz, Ex. III.5.2&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
r_6(n) = 16 \sum_{d|n} \chi\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)d^2 - 4\sum_{d|n} \chi(d)d^2.
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hardy &amp; Wright, § 20.13&quot;&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, § 20.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Define the function '''σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'')''' as&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, ''Ramanujan'', § 9.7&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_k^*(n) = (-1)^{n}\sum_{d|n}(-1)^d d^k=
\begin{cases}
\sum_{d\,|\,n} d^k=\sigma_k(n)&amp;\mbox{if } n \mbox{ is odd }\\
\sum_{\stackrel{d\,|\,n}{ 2\, \mid \,d}}d^k -\sum_{\stackrel{d\,|\,n}{ 2\, \nmid \,d}}d^k&amp;\mbox{if } n \mbox{ is even}.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, if ''n'' is odd, '''σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'')''' is  the sum of the ''k''th powers of the divisors of ''n'', i.e. '''σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''),''' and if ''n'' is even it is the sum of the ''k''th  powers of the even divisors of ''n'' minus the sum of the ''k''th  powers of the odd divisors of ''n''.

:&lt;math&gt;
r_8(n) = 16\sigma_3^*(n).\;
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hardy &amp; Wright, § 20.13&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, ''Ramanujan'', § 9.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Adopt the convention that Ramanujan's '''τ(''x'') = 0 if ''x'' is not an integer.'''

:&lt;math&gt;
r_{24}(n) = \frac{16}{691}\sigma_{11}^*(n) + \frac{128}{691}\left\{
(-1)^{n-1}259\tau(n)-512\tau\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)\right\}
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, ''Ramanujan'', § 9.17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divisor sum convolutions===

Here &quot;convolution&quot; does not mean &quot;Dirichlet convolution&quot; but instead refers to the formula for the coefficients of the [[Power_series#Multiplication_and_division|product of two power series]]:

:&lt;math&gt;  \left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n\right)\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n x^n\right)
= \sum_{i=0}^\infty \sum_{j=0}^\infty  a_i b_j x^{i+j}
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\sum_{i=0}^n a_i b_{n-i}\right) x^n
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n x^n
.&lt;/math&gt;

The sequence &lt;math&gt;c_n = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i b_{n-i}\;&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[convolution]] or the [[Cauchy product]] of the seqences ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. See [[Eisenstein series]] for a discussion of the series and functional identities involved in these formulas.

{{Unreferenced|date=July 2010}}
'''ANSI C''' is the standard published by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) for the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]]. Software developers writing in C are encouraged to conform to the requirements in the document, as it encourages easily [[porting|portable]] code.

==History and outlook==
The first standard for C was published by ANSI. Although this document was subsequently adopted by [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and subsequent revisions published by ISO have been adopted by ANSI, the name ANSI C (rather than ISO C) is still more widely used. While some software developers use the term '''ISO C''', others are standards body–neutral and use '''Standard C'''.

===C89===
In 1983, the American National Standards Institute formed a committee, X3J11, to establish a standard specification of C. After a long and arduous process, the standard was completed in 1989 and ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 &quot;Programming Language C.&quot; This version of the language is often referred to as &quot;ANSI C&quot;, or sometimes &quot;C89&quot; (to distinguish it from C99).

===C90===
In 1990, the ANSI C standard (with a few minor modifications) {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} was adopted by the International Organization for Standardization  as ISO/IEC 9899:1990. This version is sometimes called C90. Therefore, the terms &quot;C89&quot; and &quot;C90&quot; refer to essentially the same language.

===C99===
{{Main|C99}}
In March 2000, ANSI adopted the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard. This standard is commonly referred to as C99, and it is the most recent standard for the C programming language.

===C1X===
{{Main|C1X}}
&quot;C1X&quot; is the unofficial name of the planned new [[Open standard|standard]] for the [[C programming language]]. It is intended to replace the existing C standard, informally known as [[C99]].

==Support from major compilers==
ANSI C is now supported by almost all the widely used compilers. Most of the C code being written nowadays is based on ANSI C. Any program written ''only'' in standard C and without any hardware dependent assumptions is virtually guaranteed to compile correctly on any [[system platform|platform]] with a conforming C implementation.  Without such precautions, most programs may compile only on a certain platform or with a particular compiler, due, for example, to the use of non-standard libraries, such as [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] libraries, or to the reliance on compiler- or platform-specific attributes such as the exact size of certain data types and byte [[endianness]].

===Compliance detectability===
To mitigate the differences between [[K&amp;R C]] and the ANSI C standard, the &lt;code&gt;__STDC__&lt;/code&gt; (&quot;standard c&quot;) macro can be used to split code into ANSI and K&amp;R sections.
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #if __STDC__
 extern int getopt(int, char * const *, const char *);
 #else
 extern int getopt();
 #endif
&lt;/source&gt;

It's better to use &quot;&lt;code&gt;#if __STDC__&lt;/code&gt;&quot; as above rather than &quot;&lt;code&gt;#ifdef __STDC__&lt;/code&gt;&quot; because some implementation may set &lt;code&gt;__STDC__&lt;/code&gt; to zero to indicate non-ANSI compliance. &quot;&lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt;&quot; will treat any identifiers that couldn't be replaced by a macro as zero (&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;). Thus even if the macro &quot;&lt;code&gt;__STDC__&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is not defined to signify non-ANSI compliance, &quot;&lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt;&quot; will work as shown.

In the above example, a prototype is used in a function declaration for ANSI compliant implementations, while an obsolescent non-prototype declaration is used otherwise. Those are still ANSI-compliant as of C99 and C90, but their use is discouraged.

==Compilers supporting ANSI C==
* [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]]
* [[Visual C++|Microsoft Visual C++]] (C90. A few features of C99)
* [[ARM Holdings|ARM]] RealView
* [[LCC (compiler)|LCC]]
* [[OpenWatcom]] (C89/90 and some C99)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Alien and Sedition Acts (1798).jpg|thumb|250px|upright|Text of the &quot;Alien Friends Act&quot;]]

The '''Alien and Sedition Acts''' were four bills passed in 1798 by the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] in the [[5th United States Congress]] during an undeclared naval war with France, later known as the [[Quasi-War]]. They were signed into law by President [[John Adams]]. Proponents claimed the acts were designed to protect the United States from [[enemy alien]]s, and to prevent [[Sedition|seditious]] attacks from weakening the government. The [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]], like later historians, denounced them as being both unconstitutional and designed to stifle criticism of the administration, and as infringing on the right of the states to act in these areas. They became a major political issue in the elections of 1798 and 1800.

== Acts ==
Four separate laws constituted what is commonly referred to as the &quot;'''Alien and Sedition Acts'''&quot;
#The '''[[Naturalization Act of 1798|Naturalization Act]]''' (officially '''An Act to Establish a Uniform Rule of Naturalization'''; ch. 54, {{USStat|1|566}}) extended the duration of residence required for aliens to become citizens of the United States from five years to fourteen years.
#The '''[[s:United States Statutes at Large/Volume 1/5th Congress/2nd Session/Chapter 58|Alien Act]]''' (officially '''An Act Concerning Aliens'''; ch. 58, {{USStat|1|570}}) authorized the president to deport any resident alien considered &quot;dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States.&quot; It was activated June 25, 1798, with a two year expiration date.
#The '''[[s:United States Statutes at Large/Volume 1/5th Congress/2nd Session/Chapter 66|Alien Enemies Act]]''' (officially '''An Act Respecting Alien Enemies'''; ch. 66, {{USStat|1|577}}) authorized the president to apprehend and deport resident aliens if their home countries were at war with the United States of America.  Enacted July 6, 1798, and providing no sunset provision, the act remains intact today as {{usc|50|21|24}}. At the time, war was considered likely between the U.S. and France.
#The '''[[s:United States Statutes at Large/Volume 1/5th Congress/2nd Session/Chapter 74|Sedition Act]]''' (officially '''An Act for the Punishment of Certain Crimes against the United States'''; ch. 74, {{USStat|1|596}}) made it a crime to publish &quot;false, scandalous, and malicious writing&quot; against the government or its officials. It was enacted July 14, 1798, with an expiration date of March 3, 1801 (the day before Adams' presidential term was to end).

==Allegations of unconstitutionality==

Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]] denounced the Sedition Act as invalid and a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[United States Bill of Rights]], which protected the right of [[free speech]], and a violation of the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Virginia_Resolutions_of_1798
|title=The Kentucky Resolutions of 1798}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,994570-2,00.html
|title=Thomas Jefferson: The Patriot Act of the 18th Century
|date=Jul 05, 2004
| work=Time
|first=Ishmael
|last=Reed
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jefferson also secretly drafted the  [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]] denouncing the federal legislation. These reflect the [[Compact theory|Compact Theory]], which holds that the United States is made up of a voluntary union of states that agree to cede some of their authority in order to join the union, but that the states do not, ultimately, surrender their sovereign rights.  Federalist-dominated state legislatures rejected Jefferson's position through resolutions either supporting the Acts or denying the ability of Virginia and Kentucky to circumvent them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Portal:Kentucky_and_Virginia_Resolutions Portal:Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alien and Sedition Acts were, however, never appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], whose right of [[Judicial review (law)|judicial review]] was not established until ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' in 1803. The Court in 1798 was composed entirely of Federalists, all appointed by Washington. Many of them, particularly [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Samuel Chase]], were openly hostile to the Federalists' opponents. Individual Supreme Court Justices, particularly Chase, sitting in [[Supreme Court of the United States|circuit]], heard many of the cases prosecuting opponents of the Federalists.

==Prosecutions==

Republican editors, a member of Congress, and  private individuals were targets of prosecution under the Sedition Act.   Twenty-five people were arrested. Of them, eleven were tried, one died awaiting trial, and ten were convicted of sedition, often in trials before openly partisan Federalist judges.

===Journalists===
[[Benjamin Franklin Bache (Journalist)|Benjamin Franklin Bache]], the grandson of [[Benjamin Franklin]], was editor of the ''Aurora'', a Republican newspaper. Bache had accused [[George Washington]] of incompetence and financial irregularities, and &quot;the blind, bald, crippled, toothless, querulous ADAMS&quot; of nepotism and monarchical ambition. The Adams administration did not wait for the passage of the Sedition Act but arrested Bache on common law libel charges on June 27, 1798, two weeks before the Act was signed by the President. Bache died of yellow fever in 1798 while awaiting trial.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John C. ''Crisis in Freedom: The Alien and Sedition Acts'' (New York: Little Brown and Company 1951) pp. 27-29, 65, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Thomson Callender]], a Scottish citizen, had been expelled from Great Britain for his political writings. Living first in Philadelphia, then seeking refuge close to Jefferson in Republican Virginia, he wrote a book entitled &quot;The Prospect Before Us&quot; (read and approved by Jefferson before publication) in which he called the Adams administration a &quot;continual tempest of malignant passions&quot; and the President a repulsive pedant, a gross hypocrite and an unprincipled oppressor&quot;. Callender, already residing in Virginia and writing for the ''Richmond Examiner'',  was indicted under the Sedition
